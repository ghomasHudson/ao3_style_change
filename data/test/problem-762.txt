“What do you mean?” I add a touch of a sneer into my voice, not wanting him to see inside me anymore.
Draco?” He sounds like a petulant child, and I laugh softly to myself. I sober up enough to explain the situation for the hundredth time.
“Well, it’s not totally perfect, I’m missing a couple, but I think I’ve got the majority worked out.” Potter sounds totally unaffected by this, but Draco is shocked he’s done it so fast. Maybe all those jeers about Potter being the stupid one of the Golden Trio were misplaced…
Harry’s heart stops, his chest bursting with fireworks at his first name falling off Draco’s lips. “Good morning, again,” Harry says with a chuckle.
“Please don’t make promises Harry. Promises never work out.” Now a tear really does fall, trickling down my left cheek.
Harry stops pacing and runs his hands through his bird's-nest of hair. It’s entirely possible that the Ferret is just annoyed that Harry got to sleep in the bed the previous night. He is rather stubborn after all, and can hold a grudge for way too long. Part for being Slytherin, he says. Harry shakes his head. It’s not at all useful or productive to be thinking about Malfoy when he isn’t even
Draco huffs a breath and lies down, lacing his fingers together to fight the still-present urge to reach for the other man.
Harry grins at him and turns the canvas slowly around. Draco is sure it’s the cottage as snow comes into view, blue and white blending perfectly together. He closes his eyes, trying not to make it too obvious. He can still salvage this, can still find a way around it.
Draco groans even louder, his hands clawing at Harry’s back and nails digging into his skin. Their lips brush, slow and steady but also fast and all-consuming. Harry pulls Draco closer, not wanting anything between them. He breathes him in, pulling away to rest their foreheads together. Draco pants, his eyes overridden with black and the silver al but swallowed.
Draco makes a tutting sound, moving his hands from Harry’s hair to his face. He cups it in his careful grip and turns Harry’s face to force him to look at him. When Harry summons the courage to open his eyes, he sees calm acceptance on Draco’s face. It’s not what he was expecting to find.
underground after all—they look very beautiful. To top it all off, there is an actual chandelier hanging overhead. It sends light to every corner of the room, nothing left untouched. It must be enchanted.
“Malfoy, it is also my assignment, and while I don’t care if I fail I know that you do. Besides, it’s interesting.” He shrugs and steps out of the doorway and further into the room.
“Would anyone like a cup of tea? Or something stronger?” Harry asks the room a while later. Night has long set in by this point, and a mug of coffee sounds like the only way I’m going to stay awake. I’m utterly exhausted, my body becoming sore and stiff from hours of disuse after hours of activity.
I always come to the same conclusion though. The two terrible excuses for men know I won’t leave. They know that I know that if I was to desert them, they would track me. Voldemort would employ thousands of Death Eaters to find me, and to bring me back to him to die at his hands. Hours of torture would occur, worsened because of my father. I would be considered a ‘traitor’. I have nothing wrong with that last bit, of course. But I wouldn’t want to leave my mother. She would surely be punished for my actions, and I couldn’t let that happen. I wouldn’t ever forgive myself.
Mother nods. “Yes, Lucius loved telling me all about it.” Her lips curl into a sneer of disgust. I’m sure that one day my parents loved each other, but those days ended when we were abused and tortured by his wand.
Ron calls out in what can only be described as frustration as he enters the room. He’s seen the books. Okay. Maybe Harry and I have gone a bit overboard with research, and maybe we have the equivalent of a small library strewn around, but it isn’t quite worth screaming over. Certainly, the piles of books on every surface are a bit daunting, but he isn’t going to be opening any of them past the index! A rush of guilt for Hermione and Harry jolts through me, but I push it down. I’ll help them after I tell them what my thoughts are, and it’s not like any of them actually complained. Hell, Hermione practically
Rashon was lovely, and he’d been very helpful. They’d filled out multiple pages with designs, and then cut it down to a couple. Blaise can then choose one or merge multiple together, creating a tattoo he’s ultimately happiest with. Draco thought that was brilliant.
“Time for a shower I think,” he announces, pushing Harry off him. Cleaning charms may remove the sweat and the sticky mess in his pants, but they can only do so much.
“Ok, so,” Harry begins, “what if someone discovered a flaw in the ground? Maybe it’s on a fault line or something, and small earthquakes became a problem. That would explain the cracking foundations.”
Draco doesn’t know when he’d thought of this new idea, but he can’t get it out of his head. It’s wedged there, stuck amongst his other thoughts. He’d tried to tell Potter, but the Saviour had rolled his eyes and said something about being irresponsible. Draco hadn’t liked that, so he’d snuck out to try it by himself. He absentmindedly strokes his wand in its holster around his waist as he pulls the second door the rest of the way open. It’s difficult to see inside the dark Cabinet, and the streetlamp is at the wrong angle to illuminate the interior. His wand slides from the holster easily, and when he casts his
Draco nods slowly, knowing there’s no point in arguing. Harry would just drag him along even if he refused. At least if he agrees, he’ll avoid upsetting Harry.
He’s a murderer. No, he hasn’t technically killed anyone, but he was going to. He’s played a part—no matter how small—in multiple people’s deaths. He hates himself for it. Every day he has to wake up and see his Mark, the proof of his mistakes and past. It would be so easy to blame his father, his own situation, but that’s not entirely true. He actually believed the things he was saying, the things he was thinking. His friends and coworkers disagree, saying that he only thought those things because he was raised to believe them. Draco isn’t sure. He can’t be sure of anything anymore, not when his past drowns out any possibility of a positive future. He feels off kilter, like he’s on a fishing boat in a five metre swell. Some days he doesn’t think twice about it all, accepting it and moving on. Other days he builds it into a chasm and finds himself spiralling down it.
Keeping up hope, he walks down the path through the centre of the village. There are many more shops, each displaying unique wares and interesting things to buy, but each is just as abandoned as the last. Draco feels a sense of unease come over his previously determined attitude. Not much would cause a village full of people to up and leave. He shudders and picks up the pace a little. He doesn’t want to be here for any longer than necessary. Even so, his eyes still roam over the buildings. There are some signs of life lingering around, despite years having passed since anyone lived here. Nothing obvious of course, just tiny details that most people would miss. Like a window that has lines etched into the glass—possibly from a child ages ago that was never fixed—or a table inside a shop with scratched legs. This village wasn’t created out of magic; there was a time people lived here. A time when it was bustling with life.
“Okay,” Draco responds without much thought. “Why are you telling me?” He adds when his brain leaves the pages of his book.
Harry gazed at Draco, who was lying down comfortably on his towel. He ran his hands up Draco’s back, rubbing the lotion in. He worked his hands up and down Draco’s warm skin, making sure to cover his entire back. Draco let out a contented sigh and shifted happily beneath Harry.
They’re so bright, like liquid silver in the sun. Harry could drown in his eyes, but he’d like to fuck him first. Long and hard, fast and loving.
Potter heaves a sigh. “Okay then.” He begins pacing up and down the courtyard, never straying too far away but never coming too close either. “Physical exam,” he says, face lighting up. “Maybe there’s something there we haven’t found yet, some easy way to string the magic back.”
“Quit your worrying,” Harry says, wrapping an arm around his shoulders as they walk. The gravel road crunches under their feet, and Draco finds himself focusing on that instead of on the building in front of them.
Harry pulls Draco’s pants off his long legs, throws them out of the way, and chases Draco’s cock. His hand wraps around it firmly, holding it still. He gazes at it for a second, eyes tracking a drop of precome that drips out of the slit. He growls, leaning forward to drag his tongue up from the base.
Draco carefully picks up his mug and turns to Potter. He’s watching him very carefully, almost as if he’d just observed a very rare sight. Draco rolls his eyes and takes a measured sip of his beverage. He turns a wince into a smirk when he burns his tongue. He always forgets to make it a
Potter and I have now stood up from the table we were sitting at, and have been pacing around the room for a couple of minutes. I’m following Potter as he paces around the room, pointing at where things should go, and writing everything he says down. I occasionally interrupt him, because “no Potter, the music should not be played from a jukebox hovering above everyone’s heads” and “Potter, putting a floating stream of pumpkins right in front of the entrance is not a good idea”. Every interruption I make, he scowls at me like I’m questioning Merlin himself.
“I’m going to guide you.” She accepts my reasoning, and I slowly start dicing the root. My hand gently moves up and down, making circles in the air before cutting. Once I’m halfway through one root, I remove my hand. She looks up at me and sees me nod quickly. She resumes her cutting and succeeds in making little slices of ginger root.
Harry pauses, something in Draco’s question irking him. “Why would I be worried?” He asks hesitantly.
Harry flops onto the couch innocently just as Draco leaves the bathroom, sauntering into the living room. Honestly, who actually
“What are you staring at?” Draco mumbles, as if knowing the answer already and slightly embarrassed by it.
Across said path and another patch of grass, there appears to be a bookshop. Harry’s thoughts immediately fly to Hermione, and he suppresses a smile. She would love it here, if there were still people about. There are plenty of unique shops, and the village has a real character to it that can’t be replicated. She would adore it, and she would spend hours in that bookstore. Sighing, he decides to boycott it. He can’t bear to think of her right now. Not when he’s hundreds, maybe thousands, of kilometres away and God knows where, while she’s no doubt in London, blissfully unaware that he’s missing. Except, does it really count as missing if he’s with someone else? In a picturesque location, with everything they need? Really, it just sounds like a holiday. But it’s not! Harry snarls to himself. It’s not a holiday, because he’s here against his will. In the Auror department, that counts as a missing persons case.
“So, Malfoy,” the Potions Professor starts, “I’ve asked you here to talk about your class work, and a favour I would like you to help me with.” My face sinks in surprise and he must’ve seen because he quickly stammers out, “All good things, of course.” I release a breath I didn’t know I was holding in, and take a seat opposite him on the obnoxiously pale orange ottoman.
close to it, but he’s missing something. One connection, he’s sure. It’s annoying, and he can’t place his finger on it.
“That said,” Parkinson cuts in, “I’m not too upset about it. You two have finally come to your senses,
Harry never backs down from a challenge. “Relax, I can see your hands grabbing the sheets, I’m not here to talk about
almost instantly. Harry grins, pulling out to the tip and sliding a second finger in. They move easily, testimony to how long Harry has spent on this. He pumps them quickly, speeding up immediately. Draco calls out a mix of curses and Harry’s name as he begins scissoring his fingers, stretching him out further. Eventually Draco’s hole is relaxed enough to accomodate three fingers, and Harry takes great delight in driving them forward into his warm body.
“But we already know,” Harry interjects. “It has to be the group I saw in the forest, doesn’t it? The colours match, they’re in the right place, and they said they’d intervene!”
“Oh! I forgot! I was going to tell you something,” Potter rushes, evidently trying to distract Draco from himself. “There’s a Vanishing Cabinet in a town on the other side of the forest. I was going to bring it up a few days ago but I kept forgetting.”
Potter laughs like a maniac. “You forgot. You’re not the only one living here, Malfoy. I sleep on the couch every night for fuck’s sake!”
“I know,” Draco murmurs, kissing him again. He closes his hand over the top of Harry’s, pressing them flat to his skin. It’s warm under Harry’s hand, alive. “But I’m okay.”
“What was that about?!” I shout at his hunched form. The only reply I receive is a grunt from behind his ginger hair. “What did I even do?! I haven’t spoken to you all year!”
Draco huffs but doesn’t push the point further: Harry does have a point. Theo has been telling him he should cut down, should find something else to wake him up. Draco never listens, he’s a wizard after all. If he gets sick from it they have potions and spells, he’ll be fine. It’s worth it to actually be able to move in the morning.
Draco blinks his eyes open, the darkness pressing against them and swallowing all thought. He’s hot, sweat beading on his skin. He feels out of place; he should be shivering, not sweating. Lifting his head, he tries to look around. Everything is dark, bathed in a lack of light. It’s like he’s been blind folded, everything shut out and incomprehensible. Everything, that is, except the body in front of him.
“Peter is really the one to ask,” I say, quickly drawing her attention away from myself and towards the man next to me.
Harry pushes his face into Draco’s groin, breathing him in again before pushing his fingers into the legs of his briefs. His fingers touch the smooth skin and Draco’s breath catches. Harry runs his hand along the leg holes, drawing moans and shaky exhales from Draco. He presses his nose into the gap, taking a deep breath.
friends too, did this! There’s no way he should look so happy. Yet he does, and Harry doesn’t know which reaction is right. He struggles with anger he hadn’t even realised he felt at the people he’s called friends for half his life. He’s been through a war with them! He thought they had his back!
“Malfoy and Potter seem quite close these days, don’t they?” A girl asks of her friend, and I roll my eyes. More like forced civility.
“Me either,” he confesses. His eyes flicker to me, an unreadable emotion carefully contained inside. My heart clenches, my palms growing sweaty. Harry looks like a god, even with his ruffled hair and his bloodied face. Bloodied face? I scan my eyes over him, trying to find where the red smudge has come from. Fixing them in a shallow cut on his cheek, I walk forward so I’m closer to him again. I reach my hand up and tentatively run my fingers over the cut. Harry visibly winces, his green eyes clouding over in what must be pain, and I hurriedly withdraw it. Harry’s face grows pink, and with his eyes still glossy he looks almost flustered. Ignoring the heat that is quick long pooling in my stomach, I drop my hand off his warm skin and step back again. I force my hands behind my back, grasping them firmly to stop them trying to reach for him again.
He watches as Draco froths the milk, melting chocolate, pouring them together and swirling them. They mix into a beautiful combination, and Harry is tempted to take it right now. But then Draco pulls out cream, marshmallows, and even more chocolate. He tops the milk with the cream, covers it in soft pink marshmallows, and grates chocolate over the whole thing. Harry licks his lips as Draco passes him a mug.
Harry pulls out, circling the muscle with a finger. Draco groans, his hands hitting Harry’s back. He pulls his head away from him, reaching his other hand out. Thankfully, Draco seems coherent enough to understand, pulling a bottle of lube from God-knows-where and practically throwing it into Harry’s hand. Harry pops the cap open, squeezes some out onto his fingers and Draco’s hole, and slides in to the first knuckle.
His hand reaches out for the blanket covered body, hoping it lands on a shoulder or something. He can’t see anything, and what he thinks is a shoulder could just as easily be a hip. Shaking his head, he rocks the body under his hand.
“Why a bath? I won’t be able to wash my hair properly.” He doesn’t bring up the charms that clean bath water out
The moon is in the centre of the sky as Potter and I make the walk to our Common Room. The halls are deserted and silent, everyone else long gone to bed. Each of us are carrying multiple books with the Curse of the Bogies mentioned somewhere within, making our journey there a lot slower than it needed to be. We pass paintings that grumble at us to dim our wands, and a couple of house elves glare at us, but we arrive at the suit of armour in one piece. Potter lifts his head to speak, but comes up short.
Draco turns his head and looks at the squirrel. It’s lying on the ground, not moving as it sticks in the mud. He feels awful for the poor thing, but also thinks it kind of had it coming. It ripped his skin for Merlin’s sake! And his shirt! Not that he really cares
The man is unquestionably fit, tan skin emphasising his rippling muscles. He looks like he works an active job, so maybe he’s an Auror? It doesn’t matter to Draco though. Wasting no time, he dances up behind the man. He runs his arms up the man’s bare back, grinning as they are pushed together. Feeling more confident, Draco brings them down to rest on the stranger’s hips and pulls him closer. They are nearly touching, practically no air left between them. Draco shuffles his own hips forward to rest on the man’s arse, the black leather trousers squeezing at his growing erection. His navy blue shirt is open at the front, meaning that his chest is pressing hotly against the man’s tan back.
The command, an echo of his own yesterday, sends Draco over the edge. He shakes, his back arching as he comes in his pants. Sparks fly through his body, tingling in his fingers and making his toes curl. His chest hits Harry’s, his feet pressing him even closer.
When he looks up at Potter it’s to see embarrassed eyes and reddening cheeks. “Sorry, I panicked.” His voice is quiet, the apology a murmur.
Draco rocks his hips up to meet Harry’s, his cock rubbing against the seam of his trousers and Harry’s own erection. Harry’s words send an electric shock through Draco’s body, as if fire is trailing over his skin.
It’s night, and eight year old me is sitting on the leather sofa next to my father. Mother is out shopping for presents, as it’s nearly Christmas, leaving us alone in the house. He tells me about special spells that can eavesdrop on specified areas, ones that can capture the scene like a memory in a pensive or a muggle camera. He said that those spells would be incriminating evidence if anyone ever tried to hurt us. Now though, the memory of the conversation is startling and the meaning is very, very obvious.
“I don’t know what will happen if Harry isn’t the only one in there. I am concerned for his safety in that regard.” I decide that’s a neutral way to put  it. A way that disguises my emotion by feigning nonchalance. I can see on her face that that doesn’t work.
“What on earth are they?” I inquire when I see her click the end of the Muggle quill and press it to the parchment.
The pansies are deep jewel tones, purple and blue spilling over a black background. He wasn’t sure about that, didn’t know how well the tones would carry on black. Turns out he had nothing to worry about. The yellow accents on the flowers bring out the lighting, and the white magic twines around it. It glistens, silvers and white and greys. These don’t glow in the dark, but they create another set of flowers entirely weaving between the painted ones. He’s really impressed with how well it turned out.
The few minutes of waiting for him to return with Mother are the worst in my life. It’s sheer torture, lying on my bed, excruciating pain shooting through my body. I try to centralise the pain, but there isn’t a center anymore. What used to only be between my collarbones, has expanded out over my entire back, like my bones are slowly deteriorating within my body. I realise just how weak—for lack of a better word—I really am. The knife closed tightly in my hand would do shit against an intruder. My wand lies uselessly next to me on the bed, not that I’m even able to cast anything. I sigh, hair flopping over my forehead.
Harry is an arrogant prick, and how Draco ever forgot that is beyond him. “I’m not using the same spell as yesterday, so you need to stand behind me.”
He’s immediately reminded of why he left. The living area is totally deserted, but there are dishes to do and things to clean up. Malfoy has clearly had a good time by himself this afternoon. Harry isn’t happy about it, but he tidies up and then prepares for bed. Bed, of course being the couch in the living room. At least it’s comfortable-ish. Out of all the couches in the world to be stuck on, this isn’t the worst. Still, he would much prefer to be sleeping on his bed. His bed at Grimmauld has heating charms to keep him warm throughout the long winter nights. He would do basically anything to get back to it, but for now he’s on the couch with Malfoy down the hall.
“I guess so,” Harry murmurs. “The last part, about freedom from my opinions about myself… That would be a relief.”
To be fair to himself, he wasn’t the one to scream the name of his age-long rival. Potter had shouted his name as loud as humanly possible before running to the edge of the hole. Although, now that he thinks about it, he had been the one to use a given name first. Potter had fallen into the hole, and Draco had been so excited to see another person he’d forgotten the nature of their relationship; meaning, there isn’t much of one at all.
Malfoy in. He doesn’t know what exactly the cottage will have, but he has to be able to find something. Deciding that since the chess board came from the bedroom, it would only make sense that there might be others there too, Harry jogs down the hallway and pushes into the room. His eyes immediately begin scanning the room for a game.
Surely they weren’t so fed up with his constant chatter about Draco that they felt the need to do this? How many laws have they broken purely to get him to shut up? At least ten, surely.
Harry closes his eyes, needing the darkness in order to think. “You’re telling me, you deliberately made it harder to communicate, so we’d have sex?”
preventing leaving. He doesn’t know why he can’t just Apparate out. The problem is, even if he did manage to find something, he wouldn’t have been to do anything about it. The wards are very tightly packed, he doubts a pin would fit between them. While his magic may be able to squeeze in, he wouldn’t have been able to see what he was doing. An expert must have put these up, he’s sure. But, if someone went to all the effort of assembling some top of the art wards, why did they abandon the cottage? Potter checked on Monday, no one has ever stayed here. It’s weird, and Draco tries not to think about it for too long.
Draco laughs as that was probably meant to be the incentive for them to get back quickly, but gets up and
“We?” Potter cocks his head smugly, like he just won the fucking lottery. Of course his attention got stuck on the one part of what Draco had said that could be twisted to mean something different.
Pansy considers this for a moment before answering. “I’ve seen you tired. You didn’t look like this. It’s something else, isn’t it? You can tell me, you know?” I shake my head in rejection, and watch as her eyes lose their light.
“While I was there I was a prisoner. Not a son, or an accomplice, or whatever you probably thought. I was kept in my bedroom all day, and the food was passed in and out in intervals. That was always the scraps of what they fed to their workers. Basically inedible by the time I got it.”
“I’ve called you here today to tell about your first responsibility as House Representatives.” McGonagall’s sentence answers none of our questions. That was quite obvious when I walked in and saw Potter, Bones, and Goldstein inside her office too. I shrug at Potter, and he rolls his eyes back at me.
“No need to be embarrassed, Malfoy,” Potter says, seemingly guessing where Draco’s thoughts were headed. “I get them too. I think we all do.”
Draco frowns and shifts over more before reopening his book. Now the only thing Potter can see is the inconspicuous cover—a starry sky and the title “Nearly Missed Opportunities” scrawled across it—and the top of Draco’s hair. He settles into reading once again, his attention to the room dissolving into nothing. The two men are in the middle of a very public argument, and the tension between them is crackling. They both desperately want to kiss the other, yet all they can do is yell.
“Look at us. Talking in the kitchen about our awkward lives like a couple of sad, middle-aged men.” Malfoy sounds sour, and Harry pulls his attention back in.
Harry wants to say yes, he wants to give in. Has it been long enough though? They’ve only been together for a couple of days, surely he should wait longer. But they’ve known each other for literally half their lives, and he’s liked Draco for
close to the fire. Harry can’t blame him. Happy to have finally discovered everything, he actually leaves this time, closing the bedroom door behind him.
This one is neatly labelled as ‘Mental Health and Self-Help’ and Harry quickly skips it and moves to another shelf. He already has Hermione on him about seeing a therapist, the last thing he needs is for a book to tell him too. Shaking his head, he impatiently walks back to Malfoy.
“Mother’s awake?!” I yell out too and rush to put on my dressing gown. Harry kisses my hairline swiftly and tugs me more firmly out of the door.
Malfoy sniffs and straightens his back, ignoring Harry in favour of peering into a bag shop Harry somehow missed the last time he was here. There’s a little leather wallet in the display window Malfoy’s looking at, and Harry gazes around the window too.
Harry’s first thought upon entering is that the people in this village must have been Rich, with a capital ‘R’. Despite looking humble and modest, this jeweller is anything but. And really, Harry must have expected it deep down. The whole point of jewellery stores is that they are shiny, beautiful, and expensive. Very expensive. This one is no different in nature, even if it looks almost antique in styling. The walls are wooden—not plaster or bricks, but actual wood—and there are beams running across the ceiling. He tries to ignore the cobwebs stretched over the wood, but he finds his eyes drawn to them. He hates spiders, ever since- ever since Second Year. The shop is filled with wall-to-wall glass cabinets, perfect for displaying glittering wares. Harry’s jaw drops as he spots a cabinet which still contains something. He makes his way around the room, looking into every glass window and finding each one very, very empty.
“My apologies, Miss Stinton,” Draco replies. There’s no use giving a reason— not that he has one anyway—because she’ll take it as an excuse regardless. Excuses are not looked upon well.
He watches with widening eyes as Harry takes a step closer. Harry’s thumb stops moving, resting against his skin. Draco feels his other hand press into his hip. It feels intimate, like a touch shared between lovers. His heart skips a beat, this time for the right reason.
Harry hums his response and walks over to the kitchen. He isn’t sure what he wants for breakfast, just that he wants it quickly. His eyes rove over the contents of the fridge and pantry. There’s not much there, and Harry finds himself wishing for Molly’s cooking. He craves something homemade by someone other than him, and even though Draco is cooking too, it’s not quite the same as a Weasley meal.
“I’m calling BS there.” Hermione sweeps her eyes over my face, as if she can read my every thought. “You know exactly what I mean.”
He carries the bowl of soup over to the couch and places it on the coffee table Malfoy had transfigured days ago. He then turns to wake Malfoy, but finds him already awake and watching Harry with an interesting expression on his face. The man doesn’t say anything though, simply holds his gloved hands out for the bowl. Harry swallows but does as told, and then moves away to sit on the table. Malfoy sits for a second before moving—pulling the atrocious and fluffy gloves further onto his hands, not off as Harry expected—taking the first mouthful of soup and practically moaning. Harry watches as he begins shoveling the soup into his mouth, and has to stand up. Malfoy doesn’t seem to notice, continuing to eat.
proud of it. Harry doesn’t need to know how much time it took or how much Draco wanted to rip his hair out while making it.
to—and starts cutting pieces of pancake off for himself. Potter huffs next to him but slides back into place, picking up his mug to try the coffee again. Draco watches from the corner of his eye as Potter drinks, trying not to make it too obvious as his eyes fix on Potter’s throat. Draco’s eyes go dark as his Adam’s apple bobs, and he hurriedly looks away. He blinks rapidly, trying futilely to clear his eyes of the lust boiling behind them. The last thing he needs is for Potter to catch it under there.
Draco dreams of Christmas with his mother. He dreams of sitting on a balcony in the Manor, with a tray of tea and cakes. She smiles at him, tells him to get over himself in the politest way possible. She takes his hand in hers, presses her mouth to, and puts it down to pat it. That’s the closest they ever get to affection or reassurance.
That’s another odd thing. I no longer feel like I want to shove his head in twenty-four/seven, but only eighteen/four. It’s a strange sensation, but at least I can now get up for food without worrying about him killing me. I spent countless hours going over the various scenarios in my mind. Would he use the Killing Curse? A more creative spell? A weapon? There’s no point pondering over this anymore though, as I no longer fear my death is coming from him. Instead, the constant pressure of the possibility of my father or an angry Dark Lord haunts me.
Draco was right. Waking up in the morning and not having Potter next to him anymore is gut wrenching. He doesn’t know why he feels as though his world has been torn apart, but here he is. Normally, sex would make him feel loose and light, ready to take on the gruelling work of the day. This morning is another story. Instead of being relaxed and energised, Draco feels weak and undone. Sex with Potter had been incredible, mind-numbing in a way no one else had ever been. But if he does it again, he’ll wake up like this; and there is no way he could stomach a repeat of this. Or, apparently, the alcohol he’d had last night.
—quite dirty. Sighing and puffing his cheeks out just because he can, Draco stands and makes his way to the bathroom. Even though he already showered this morning, there is absolutely nothing stopping him drawing himself a bath. He’s wanted a bath since the second he saw it on Monday, and any excuse to get in it will gladly be taken.
A day later and the bone-wings still weigh me down. The hideous jut of bone extending from my shoulder blades casts a grey tone to the rest of me. At least most of the blood and synovial fluid has washed off. None of my clothes sit on my back properly, and Potter has had to cut holes into them. He can seal them up again with a couple of charms, but it’s still an annoying and complicated process. And I’m becoming rather bored. Sitting at Grimmauld Place—as I’ve heard Potter call it—with nothing to do but stare at my family-tree tapestry and reread all of the books for the hundredth time.
We sit in comfortable silence for a while, our legs pressed next to each other. We swap occasional words to each other, noting down any new information we come across. It’s been a couple of hours when Potter suddenly jumps up in revelation.
I make my way to Mother, and my heart momentarily shatters. She looks so fragile, lying there. Her grey hair is fanned out on the soft white pillow, her eyes shut tight. I walk up and take my spot next to her. I reach out and take her sickly-pale hand into my own. My eyes burn and for a second I think I’m going to cry, but I don’t let myself. She isn’t gone. Not yet.
“Draco?!” Its Harry, calling me from downstairs. “Do you want to leave the house for a while? I’m going to The Burrow.”
percent accurate, but it’s definitely close. The forest behind it is outlined and has all the base colours, but he hasn’t finished the next layers or begun the details. The sky is empty canvas, the only sign of anything being there the faint pencil lines. Draco thinks there’s something beautiful and fitting about it, even though he desperately wants to finish it. He’d tried to too, it’s just once his hand begins shaking there’s not much he can do.
“I can see,” Malfoy laughs. Something flashes in his eyes as he takes in Harry’s sweater. “What the fuck are you wearing Potter?”
She looks surprised, but somewhat pleased. “Take a seat, I’ll bring someone out in a little while.” She goes back to reading, making no move to get anyone at all. Draco doesn’t comment on it though, certain she’ll figure something out eventually.
Harry pales, the world suddenly spinning. He swallows hard and looks away, not able to watch the smile drop off Draco’s face as he realises he’s overstepped.
“Says the man who was literally just kissing my arse,” Draco retorts, clearly beyond caring about Harry’s ‘rules’.
case and not one he has to solve just to get his life back to normal—he would call in an expert. Unfortunately, there are no means of which to contact anyone. Even if he doesn’t openly trust Potter’s investigating skills, he can’t be an Auror for nothing. If he says there aren’t any people nearby, it must be true.
Harry shakes his head with a smile, but when he looks at Draco he finds his eyes dark and his lips parted. There’s no way he can resist him now.
He groans as Draco somehow aligns his thigh to press into his cock. Harry sees stars at the pressure in just the right spot, his mouth slipping off the nipple. Draco rocks his thigh across him, rubbing circles until Harry’s panting with it. He pushes Draco away after a second though, forcing himself to wait. There’s time for that later. Now is for Draco.
Harry hums, smiling softly at Draco. He thinks he knows what he’s going to say, and he really wants to hear it.
Now Harry does actually laugh at me. I want to be offended, but I’m just so happy to see him laughing that I let it slide.
“Have you ever considered any real freedoms? Freedoms from the opinions of others… even the opinions of yourself?” Draco whispers the question to the body next to him one night. Something about the absurdity of lying next to Harry Potter still shocking Draco every night, and needing
; then again, maybe she’s just not looking for a relationship right now—and Blaise is just as single as he ever has been, so they end up spending quite a bit of time together. With everyone else around the table in long-term relationships, Harry would think they’d feel a bit left out. With the rate they talk to each other though, Harry doesn’t think that’s the case.
, and pulls a simple white mug from the cupboard. He prepares a hot chocolate, and treats himself with marshmallows, bright sprinkles, and an extra dribble of melted chocolate. Carefully carrying the drink, he walks back to the sofa and sits down. His hands burn where the mug touches his skin, and he groans as he breathes in the steam. Draco wraps his hands around the mug and holds it, not trusting himself to take a sip yet, even as the bright colours of the sprinkles call to him.
“Glad to hear it, Mr. Malfoy. Ten points to Slytherin! Anyway, ask the others, and those who want to set up will receive a message through the parchment I gave you in the first meeting.” I nod my head at her, before taking my leave through the grand double doors.
Harry puffs his cheeks out and then expels the air, running his hands through his hair. He has no idea where to start setting up a rainbow tree. His have always been dark green. They’ve also always been
Harry blows out a breath, his hair flying up and drifting back down again. “Yeah, that’s a good point.”
It turns out Malfoy’s not half bad, and that fact has Harry barely holding back growls of frustration. He’d thought he’d win by a landslide. That said, he
“Come on, Malfoy. You aren’t a bad person. If anything, you’re better than I am! You think things through, make connections I totally miss. You’re funny, nice, and okay, maybe sometimes you’re an arrogant prick, but the rest of the time you’re just… a person.” Harry takes a breath. Why the hell did he just say those things?
“Yes, I thought you might. It looks like we have a ton of research we need to get done, doesn’t it?” Harry pulls a face.
“I’m going to touch it,” he announces. “Prepare for a response.” While he may be willing to be injured, he would prefer to do it knowing he would be healed swiftly. Robards utters a grunt in response, the lazy bastard. If it was Potter touching it, he’d probably have him do it in St. Mungo’s! But no, it’s Draco, so he doesn’t care if he’s going to be blown to bits. He takes a step forward, mentally going through everything he should look for. His hand reaches up for the silver handle of the cabinet, and he wraps his hand around it. It’s bitterly cold beneath his palm, the metal blistering his skin. He doesn’t have long to complain about it though, because before he knows it, he’s falling through the sky.
Trying desperately to salvage my appearance I cast a few simple charms. I straighten out my hair, making it fall neatly to my scalp. After struggling with my complexion for a while, I give up and move to my eyes. The bags are covered with a glamour that takes all of my energy. I’m so tired from the spells that I pad back to my bed and gladly fall asleep. In my dreams, I question why I was worn out so quickly, but pass it off as being trapped in a room with no sun, limited food and water, and lack of new oxygen.
“Are you okay?” Draco had asked, rushing over to his not-quite-boyfriend and pulling him close. He’d cursed as he nearly stepped on broken glass, only then noticing the smashed bottles at their feet. Harry had shuddered beneath him, gasping for breath between the choked sobs. “I’ve got you Harry,” Draco had reassured him. He simultaneously wishes he hadn’t, and is glad he did.
Draco turns his wand in a slow circle, then waves it out into an arc. The same pattern as the spell used yesterday, but a beat faster. He never would have thought being an Unspeakable would mean being precise down to the
I look around for my wand and find it under my pillow. Using the hawthorn wood I cast a couple of half-hearted charms at the floor, trying to lift the stains. I give up when nothing happens, and instead cast spells to remove the smell of blood. Those work, so I tuck my wand into the pocket of the trousers I’m wearing. I search around for a shirt I can find, and scowl as the only one is the blood-soaked destroyed one. Sighing, I transfigure it into a new one. Although the charm is only temporary, it will give me something to wear before I can get something new.
“Okay,” Potter agrees and holds out his arm. Draco takes it in his and Apparates the both of them onto the front step of his house.
“Great,” Potter sighs. He casts some more fancy spells, and I watch, intrigued, as a net of blue settles over the room. It looks like a setting charm mixed with a pressure charm. The combination would make sure nothing within this room moves from its normal position, and pressure would be constantly applied to various surfaces of my room to prevent Father noticing my absence. It’s rather clever of Potter.
The pavements beneath his feet turn into dirt, and before he knows it, Harry is racing through the trees he so hates. He pushes branches out of the way, ducking to avoid being hit in the face. A couple of times he
the emerald eyes roaming over his chest. Even though Harry has already seen Draco naked, he feels utterly exposed. The only way around that, he reasons to himself, is to take in Harry too. So he does. He rakes his eyes all over Harry’s tanned chest, and reaches a single finger out to touch him.
“Glad to see none of you knew that would happen,” Slughorn chuckles. “Anyway, as you can see, the potion has become a sunshine yellow colour. This is quite appropriate, as yellow is often depicted as the happiest colour.” He surveys the room before gesturing for the Gryffindor in front of me to come forward.
“Sure you did. Sure you weren’t just wanking about Potter all morning,” he sneers. I roll my eyes and pack my bag for the day with the books I’ll need.
By the choked-off laugh Harry manages, Draco knows his mind is also on jokes. He rolls his eyes to himself, hoping Harry can’t see the small smile he’s trying to stamp down.
Had he never picked it back up? Surely not, surely he wouldn’t forget something so important as his wand. But clearly he had. Where is it though? Oh. The memory slots itself into his mind, and Draco feels like digging himself a grave. Or filling this one in, more like. It’s under one of the cushions on the sofa. Draco had put it there while he showered so that it would be safe. He does it all the time when he’s at his flat. So why did he forget it today? He sighs. That’s not important. What matters now is the fact that he’s stuck in a literal hole, with no way out and no way to contact the only other person anywhere near him. The walls are too tall and smooth, multiple meters high with no footholds. There is no getting out. Draco falls back onto his thighs and into despair.
“Come on, Potter,” he grunts as he pushes himself onto his haunches. He settles himself just behind Harry’s cock, legs in either side of his hips, allowing his own cock to touch Harry’s for a second. “How are we doing this?” He wants to pick something that works for Harry, as a ‘thank you’ for the exceptional rimming.
“Time out!” Harry’s voice fills the room an hour later, and I turn the lights up so everyone can see normally.
It’s cold, and Harry pulls his wand out to cast some warming charms. The magic rolls over him, and it feels like being submerged into a hot spring. He exhales as the warmth settles in, closing his eyes and tipping his head back. Sunlight hits his face in small, weak patches. He opens his eyes a bit and squints. The light is mostly blocked out here, but if he moved slightly off the track to the left, he’d be standing where it’s a bit stronger. Harry runs awkwardly over to the sunny spot, hands still in his pockets. He smiles as the sun hits his—very rugged up—body, and continues walking through the forest.
Draco accepts it with wide eyes. “I get something?” He asks quietly, and Harry just nods softly. He swallows hard, opening the paper with great care. A strip of dark pink wool falls out onto his hand. It’s so incredibly soft, and he holds it up to look at it. It’s a scarf; a long, soft, warm scarf in a colour that compliments his skin perfectly.
He lifts his hand, trailing a finger from the base to the head. Draco twitches under him, a groan falling from his lips. Harry grins and does it again, before wrapping his entire hand around it. He pumps once, twice. Slow, tight strokes, dragging across his skin. His thumb swipes through the slit and collects the precome, and he catches Draco’s gaze as he sucks it clean. Draco’s eyes roll and his head drops back, and Harry finally gives in to his urges.
Draco’s heart slows down, and he closes his eyes. When he opens them again, it’s to find himself in a ball on the sofa. He’s in the cottage with Harry, and none of what just happened was real.
Draco hums. “It does, but it works really well for seeing something’s magical core and where it’s been altered.”
“I think I’ll read it first, and then tell you the relevant parts for you to read first. Of course, you can read all of it if you’d like.”
Potter scoops the four bottles up as he passes the coins over. Parsons carefully counts them all out, smiling when he’s done. “Have a nice day,” he calls out as I’m being dragged out of the little shop. The day has quickly come to a close, the sun setting and streaking the sky with reds and pinks.
Draco shakes his head, launching himself at Harry. He slots their mouths together, fire shooting through his body. He pulls back just as quickly, taking the canvas from Harry’s surprise-slackened hands.
Harry shuffles back slowly, hoping not to draw any attention to himself. The universe always has other plans though, and all eyes immediately fix on him.
Potter rolls his eyes in return but follows Draco as he leads Potter to his office. Draco hadn’t even thought about the possibility that they would be working together today. Now that he thinks about it though, the odds were pretty stacked against him. They’re paired up quite a lot since Potter prefers to work with other people than with goblins. He shakes himself and forces his ears to tune in to Potter’s briefing.
Harry bites back his chuckle. He leans closer to the books and looks over the titles. There’s no genre label, and he tilts his head. “What type of books are they?”
“I guess I did,” I utter nervously. I can’t believe I allowed myself to do that. What if something had happened?
Draco chews the inside of his cheek. “Not really. That’s why I thought I should ask someone who knows what they’re doing.”
And she does. Two minutes later, a man covered in tats enters from the back of the shop. He immediately turns to the woman, and they speak in hushed tones for a little. Then he turns to Draco, summoning him into a private room with a leather chair and a terrifying machine.
Potter lets out a pained breath and looks at me like I’ve suddenly grown a second head. “Oh Draco.” he shakes his head and my gut twists. “I want to be friends. I don’t know why I want to be friends with an arrogant bastard, but I do. Okay?” I feel the room go warm and I swallow thickly.
“Now, this assignment requires you to work in pairs. You are to complete this research activity, and then create a short play demonstrating whatever defence you’ve studied.” She pauses, glancing around the room in anticipation.
“You don’t want me, Harry. There’s no way you do, you deserve better.” Draco’s voice is broken, like he truly believes what he’s saying. Harry knows he doesn’t, knows it’s brought on by nightmares and flashbacks, but it hurts just the same.
Draco flops back down onto the couch. “Real mature Harry!” He yells, face falling into his palms. He doesn’t want to cry, he doesn’t want to be driven to such an emotional downfall by
“Oh Merlin. How did I not think of this?!” He uses his wand to cast a Patronus Charm, before speaking to it carefully. He tells it to go and retrieve Granger for him, and to tell her to open the Common Room door to let him in. I notice that he doesn’t mention me, but I don’t care.
He’s not in love or whatever it is Alex and Pansy believe—but about the motive behind them being stuck here. Draco is positive that their friends somehow got together, abused their combined power and strength, and teleported them into the nether. Okay, not quite the nether, but as far away from London as possible. It’s an extreme length to go to to get him to act on his feelings.
“No need to be embarrassed about being hungry, Malfoy,” Harry says as he comes around to Draco’s side. He gestures for Draco to take the left, and together they lift it back into place. Draco resolutely keeps his mouth shut, not wanting to disclose his father’s impact, even all these years later.
friends got involved. Surely they wouldn’t have wanted anything to do with setting them up. Draco doesn’t exactly have the greatest track record with them. Unless… unless Harry has been pining after him as well, and they are just as sick of it as his friends are?
Swallowing hard and resisting the urge to dig his nails into the pads of his fingers, Draco reaches a hand out for the door. The handle is carved from mahogany, and it’s cold under his grasp. He turns it to the left and it clicks open, unlocked. Draco inhales the cool air slowly and pushes the door forward. It slides inside with no resistance, no sign of creaking. He crosses onto the landing, treading with measured steps. There could be anything inside. Abandoned villages often hold nasty secrets, and Draco doesn’t particularly want to awaken anything by walking around carelessly.
He beams at Draco, staring into his bright silver eyes as if they hold the key to the world. Harry supposes they do, in this case.
“Of course I didn’t! I’m bollocks at decisions and always choose the wrong option,” Harry argues in a whisper.
Harry spreads Draco’s cheeks further, watching his hole twitch in the cold air. He breathes hotly over it, preparing Draco for his touch. Then he leans forward, bending his head over it, and drags his tongue along Draco’s crevice in a smooth line. Draco cries out, whimpering at the slightest touch. Harry growls at how easily he falls apart, and starts licking him in earnest.
Draco swallows his mouthful, Harry’s eyes tracking the motion of his throat, and turns to face him. “What about, then?”
“Hurts,” I manage to moan out. Harry chuckles a bit, but then clearly thinks better as he stops instantly.
to get it because of the colours; a bottle of oatmeal all-natural body wash; a turquoise bar of soap in the shape of a wave; and a bottle of moisturiser with cocoa butter in it. Pansy talks his ears off about how good it is for her skin, so he didn’t think he could pass it up.
His stunningly green eyes are fixed on a spot on my lower back, burning holes through me. I try to follow his eyes, but I can’t quite see that part of me. Determined, I think about what he could be seeing. There’s nothing I can think of… Wait. My hand slaps onto my skin, blocking the mark from Potter’s eyes. He does not need to know about that.
Of course, thinking about Robards just makes Harry slightly annoyed. The man, who’s supposed to be his
“I am in the vent. Awaiting directions.” There is a pause before Harry adds, “Preferably in sketch format.”
Shaking his head at his decision, he scoops the animal up in both of his hands. It’s soaked through and freezing cold, and Draco’s heart clenches just a little bit. He walks over to the tap and struggles to turn it on with only one hand, before dunking the squirrel under the stream. It jumps and tries to wriggle out of his grasp, but Draco only tightens his grip. The clean water washes the mud away, but in the winter rain it burns Draco’s hand with the cold. He can’t imagine how it must feel for the tiny animal. Once the dirt is gone, Draco rushes to wrap it up in his coat. He’d taken it off to clean his arm hours ago and never put it back on, but now it’s the perfect place for the squirrel to warm up—even though it’s also been abused by the rain and won’t be able to be fixed. If anything, that makes it more perfect for the squirrel, since it can’t ruin the coat more than it already is.
“Open your eyes, dear,” she is saying now. “The world around us isn’t real anymore. Open your eyes.”
once upon a time, and here he is, just gawking at everything. Shaking his head, he files out of the jeweller and back onto the path.
I scrunch my nose up before slamming my book closed and standing. “If you need me I’ll be in my bedroom.”
Harry set down his towel a foot from Draco’s, and pulled a bottle of sun lotion out of his backpack.
“Excuse me if I don’t quite trust your spell work.” Apart from that, Draco has no idea when he could have tried to find something. He wasn’t even in the cottage yesterday!
After a second of silence, people start moving. There are warm hugs and stilted handshakes, and then everyone Disapparates with a series of loud pops. Only the leader hangs back, waving their wand around the forest. Harry watches with his hand over his mouth as the trees move. They shift along the ground, winding between each other and spreading out to cover the clearing. There is no trace of it at all, totally hidden by the trees. The circle is gone, and so is all evidence of their meeting. The person nods to themself and sheaths their wand in a holster. Then they turn into their own Apparition.
Draco goes about his life, even though he has been interrupted by the Golden Trip. Harry, however, breaks down.
Deciding that there is no point trying to Apparate again—since he tried on Monday and all he got was a distant laugh from Potter—he changes his tactic. Maybe, if he finds clues on how they got here in the first place, he might be able to reverse it. It’s worth a shot, at least. Stupid cursed objects. Why does he have to be plagued by them? Especially by Vanishing Cabinets. Ignoring that he
Harry pulls Draco to him, murmurs nonsense into his ear and runs his hand through silky blond hair. Draco is gorgeous, it’s a pity he doesn’t really see it himself.
you saw me reading that trashy romance novel.” He takes a breath. “There never could be anything more than friendship. She knew that too, and she still agreed. Sometimes I wonder why…” Draco trails off.
“Fayola’s a bit scary sometimes, isn’t she?” He jokes as they enter, directing Draco to sit in the chair.
Harry thrusts up, and Draco can feel every minute movement inside of him. He squeezes his muscles and Harry pants heavily, releasing a guttural sound that goes straight to Draco’s cock. Harry wraps his arms around Draco to hold him down on his chest, and starts rapidly thrusting his hips. Draco cries out as the pleasure builds, and Harry joins him. Longing to move again, Draco tries to make a noise of complaint, but it comes out much more like a moan. He decides to rock his hips so that his cock is brushing Harry’s stomach, and that helps some of his urges. The pressure on his cock is delicious, and the head is leaking precome everywhere. Harry pulls Draco closer, effectively trapping his cock in a tight and hot bubble. He grinds his hips down on both his cock and the one in his arse, and moans loudly.
Draco groans, not listening as he chases Harry’s mouth. When he doesn’t find it again, he opens his eyes. He blinks, surprised to see Harry looking at him.
Draco strips his clothes off, ignoring his now soft prick, and turns the taps on. He makes the water as hot as possible before stepping under the spray, tipping his head back and letting the water fall down his neck and chest. He wants to scrub it all away, wants to pretend like none of this ever happened. Harry will never forgive him for this.
Potter doesn’t seem the least bit deterred. “Brilliant!” He leans forward and traces the small cut with the tip of his finger. He hooks his short nails into it, and tries to pull. A compartment slides easily out, a small drawer. Inside sits a piece of leather, dyed purple and silver.
Draco takes a hesitant step towards his boyfriend, feeling the freezing water slide up his foot. He breathes in a sharp intake, but walks in further. The water is at his shin when he reaches Harry, who whips him into a comforting embrace. Harry’s head fits perfectly next to Draco’s, and they breathe each other in for a minute.
Malfoy scowls but drops it, choosing instead to talk about weird stories from his work. As an Unspeakable he sees some of the funniest and strangest things in the Wizarding World. Harry is kind of jealous.
He only shakes his head. “That’s not the saying,” he says. “What’s got your wand in a knot?” He adds when Malfoy looks up at Harry for the first time as he shuffles into the kitchen.
Pushing the word to the back of his mind, he continues the—very bad—conversation. “Do you think we’ll actually have to sleep here?” He asks, more to himself than Potter.
Draco makes a concentrated effort to keep his chin lifted. Even if he’s being torn apart by the image of his father reflected in the mirror, he can at least project calm indifference. The Malfoy mask is notorious for a reason. “I have no idea what you’re talking about.”
Harry thinks back to what they already know about the Cabinet. “We decided it was made by magic, not a person right? Could that impact it?”
“Robards,” he says with a quick nod. “I am here to collect the file on the Bound Spoon.” The case name sounds utterly pathetic, but Draco has had enough experience by now to know that his boss loves giving ridiculous titles. It’s meant to ‘make filing more fun’. Draco disagrees. Instead of it sounding like the centuries-old spoon holds ancient and deadly magic that could wipe out the population of London, it sounds like a rusted spoon that has rope tied firmly around the handle. Significantly less threatening, and infinitely more boring.
“Fine, now help me up.” His ears blush with the demand, but he’s too weak to stand up on his own and he still can’t get the bloody covers off of him. It’s amazing how fast his energy has drained.
Malfoy whirls always and stalks into the kitchen, signalling the end of the short argument. He’s now going to brood and be a nightmare for the rest of the day. Harry rolls his eyes, delighting in the childish nature of the action, and starts eating his breakfast. It tastes amazing, and Harry mentally pats himself on the back. Knowing how to cook has really come in handy, and if he tries hard enough he can forget the distant past. Forget the negative memories, and replace them with nice ones. Like cooking for his friends, and with Mrs Weasley. He hums to himself as he takes another bite.
“Maybe you should take a shower first. You look like a wreck,” Draco says, standing up and running his hands through his own hair.
next to a false accusation? How did he end up sharing his bed with Harry fucking Potter last night, when they were always bitter enemies? That’s when it hits him.
down. If Harry isn’t going to talk about this morning, he won’t either. “What is there?” He asks instead.
Draco shakes his head, eyes falling to the ground. “I don’t want to like you, Harry.” Harry feels a thrill go through him at his first name coming from Draco’s mouth. “I don’t want to- yet here I am.”
Draco’s forehead creases, not understanding. Potter sighs and nudges him, their shoulders bumping. The movement turns Draco around slightly, and he sees that they’ve somehow made it to the courtyard without him noticing.
Harry nods. “My parents had something like this, although I doubt it was a reindeer.” He hums for a while, thinking. “Probably an angel or something.”
“Nothing,” I reply. “Just that Gryffindors are known to not be the brightest.” I allow a smirk to cross my face.
you didn’t get a name!” Draco snaps. “Merlin help me, we have no leads whatsoever.” He sighs. “It should be fine to touch though.”
Draco swallows but nods, heart racing as he slides his finger into the opening. He pushes it away, looking into the wallet. Inside there is a £50 Muggle note, but that’s not what catches his eye. There’s a second inscription, this one written in black. It reads ‘
“Indeed,” Draco says slowly. “The spikes must be caused by a very fast rush of magic, sudden and very powerful. The slopes in the middle though… I don’t know what they could be.”
Harry Potter feels the same way as he does, but is choosing to ignore it rather than act on it. Draco is certain that there is no escaping this nightmare anymore. All chances of getting back to London are gone with Harry’s rejection, the careful set up has fallen to pieces. They all should have known this wouldn’t work.
“Actually,” Harry says, turning around to face him, “I was thinking we could go get something from one of the cafes? We never got lunch the other day so…”
Harry forces his eyes back to his own circle, the group of boys staring in horror at the bottle. Theodore Nott and Terry Boot. Harry bites back a shocked laugh. It had surprised absolutely no one when both these boys came out, but surprised
Potter’s eyes widen and he sits up in a rush, hands reaching for Draco. “Shit I’m so sorry, I didn’t think—”
Draco sharpens his eyes as much as he can after just waking up, turning his gaze into a glare. Harry quickly morphs his own expression to match, and Draco huffs a breath. It pains him to do this, all he wants is to throw Harry’s arm around his waist and go back to sleep. But he can’t. He can’t, and he needs to be firm with himself. Taking a deep breath, Draco extends his leg and kicks Harry’s shin. It’s not a painful kick, more of a strong shove.
“No,” Malfoy sighs. “You’re right. It’s never what I want, but what can I do? It’s my choice to go to bad clubs and try to take someone home. Of course I attract the wrong attention sometimes.”
The outburst makes someone else lunge at her, only stopped by others pulling them back. When the second person speaks, they’re revealed to be male. “I think you’ll find if you look a bit closer, that he actually has a
, that’s right—casts something that makes the witch crumble to the floor in a pile of flesh. He shakes his head to himself just as one of the wizards leaps up from next to Daniel. Diffindo is used for the second time today, and gets Daniel’s leg harshly. Blood cascades down Harry’s leg and to the ground; he falls less than three seconds later. His leg looks like it’s going to fall off, and I rush over to him.
When I finally kiss him again, I pour out all my feelings into it. Our lips once again dance, and his mouth feels perfect. Warm, accepting, sweet, strong. We forget the rain around us, and the other students up in the castle, and focus all our energy into the kiss. I never once thought I’d actually be kissing Potter…
“Yes yes, it’s very exciting. Well, as you all know today’s match is between Gryffindor and Slytherin. These two teams have been training very hard so far this term, and I’m sure through the holidays, even if you haven’t seen them.”
“Move aside,” Potter instructs. Draco does as he’s told without a second thought, and then instantly angers at that fact. Regardless, Potter’s raised his wand and is performing a series of detection spells. One of them chimes while a second puffs out a cloud of green steam. Steam, not smoke. There’s no smell to it and it vanishes very quickly, whereas coloured smoke always hangs around for a while.
Draco pads over to the kitchen—leaving Harry behind on the couch—and immediately takes the mug of coffee into his hands. Harry watches as he takes a sip, doesn’t burn his mouth like Harry always does, and steals a grape from the vine. He picks up the platter after spreading butter over the toast, carrying it over to the couch and sitting down. He’s much closer than necessary, his skin warm and inviting. Harry chews the inside of his mouth, restraining himself. He won’t touch Draco right now, not without them talking.
need to catch up on sleep, and maybe the Cabinet is slowly undoing the unease between them. But it’s still entirely possible that it’s just human nature to seek warmth when cold, and the only thing remotely warm was Potter. Draco doesn’t want to admit this to said man however, in case Potter starts piecing things together. Such as the fact that Draco actually quite liked the embrace. Liked the feeling of arms around him and a chest against his back. Maybe it’s not the Cabinet at all, and is just the natural product of them spending so much time together.
He wars with himself silently, his mind taking a different side than his body. His fingers itch with the need to track down Potter’s skin, tingle with the desire to feel Potter beneath him. His mind is more reasonable though. There’s no point touching something that can’t ever be, that Draco won’t ever be able to have. Potter would surely snap his hand off if he knew what Draco was thinking about. But that’s just it, isn’t it? Potter’s asleep, and Draco just woke up next to him.
“Fuck parchment!” Potter curses. Instead, he pulls out a small muggle notebook and what I think is a pen. “Muggles have it so much easier.”
Since, obviously, there is more than just one House in this room, the colours are shockingly neutral. Walls are covered in canvas white paint, and is decorated with light wooden tables, floor boards, and cabinets. Paintings are on every wall, all of them showing rolling fields or beaches at various stages of the day. Pale purple and blue sofas are spread throughout the diamond-shaped room. Fireplaces are already roaring, with people reading in the armchairs across from them.
A minute passes, dragging on into another, and another. Harry sits on his haunches, toes going numb where they’re pressed into the floor, and tries not to move. He’s pretty sure Draco has gone to sleep on his shoulder, and he doesn’t have the heart to move him. He looks so peaceful in sleep, a mile away from the uptight man he presents to the rest of the world. Harry likes it, quite a lot. His legs are going numb though, pins and needles creeping up his thighs.
Harry moves back to my side, so close our arms are nearly touching. “We need to inform the others,” he declares. “The second is
Harry unwraps the failed tinsel, parts of it flaking off and landing all over the floor. He starts looping it around the tree again, this time taking much more care about where it’s going. When he steps away much later, sweat beginning to bead on his forehead from holding his arms up so long, he grins. It’s well-placed and neat this time, the silver no longer looking like an explosion. He beams as he picks up a couple of ornaments, wondering which ones he should place where.
A lot of things have happened in these three weeks, and not all of them have been bad. He’s become much closer to Harry than he ever thought possible. They went to school together, worked together for three years, and throughout the entire time, he’s never spoken to Harry as much as he is now. No, now he can kiss him. Embrace him, cook for him, wrap his arms around his neck. Eventually, he’ll be able to sleep next to him, be able to wake up with him. He’s never been happier, and hopefully Harry feels the same way.
The list of offenders is now complete: Blaise, Pansy, Theodore, Weasley, Granger, Thomas, Finnigan, Lovegood, Longbottom, Robards, and Alex. Alex is, of course, Draco’s work partner. They’ll need to be having some serious words when he gets back to London.
Draco moans loudly, moving his hand to rest in Potter’s hair. It tickles slightly, but it surprisingly feels amazing. Almost intimate. Which isn’t something he wants from a hook up, but decides he’ll let it slide, considering who’s doing it. He feels his cock harden impossibly more, and his skin starts growing warm. Too warm. Potter is still moving his head along the scars, and Draco has to pull on his hair to get his attention.
He doesn’t know how to react, but as he crouched down and introduces himself, he can’t help thinking how marvellous it is.
“It’s actually rather clever of the committee, decorating the room with neutral colours save for the blue. No one would fight the Ravenclaws over a sofa, unlike any of the other houses.” I mutter to myself underneath my breath. I hate the feeling I get when
weren’t paying attention. Don’t worry, I’m not going to bore you all with this speech again. Instead, I’m now going to reveal who these four people will be.”
I don’t want to think about it. What does draw my attention though, is a dip in the sofa next to me. I look up and see Harry sitting there, so close to me I can see streaks of deeper green through his eyes. I’m captivated, before remembering where we are and what we are doing. I can’t allow something as small as my emotions get in the way of helping stop my father and the Dark Lord. But he is so close, and he smells like green apples.
“Well, I always question if the things being given to me are because I earned them, or if it’s just my name.”
Draco leans over the counter a bit to inspect the jewellery, playing his part the best he can with zero preparation.
found the village, he didn’t touch anything. Harry makes his way through the shops and down the path, approaching the courtyard at the end. The Vanishing Cabinet should still be there, and it could reveal something. Maybe Malfoy found the plaza first and ran when he saw the Cabinet? It’s entirely plausible given his history with them and the fact that it brought them here. But he’s also an Unspeakable… so you’d think he’d be too curious about it to leave.
Draco doesn’t say anything, just pulls his hand away and steps back. Harry aches at the loss of his touch but forces himself to stand up straight and be brave. He’s a Gryffindor, not a bloody Hufflepuff.
He waves a dismissive hand. “Nonsense. It’s been great chatting with you gentlemen.” He scoops the bracelets back up and moves them over to the cupboard they’d come from.
“Potter, calm down. Honestly, it’s fine,” Malfoy chides. But it isn’t fine, not to Harry. To Harry, it’s reliving a part of his life he wants to forget about. There’s no way Malfoy could know that though, is there? They aren’t exactly
Harry shakes his head in amazement and twists the handle to the left. It clicks open and pushes in easily, and Harry holds it open for Malfoy to walk in after him.
“So much indignation,” he teases. “Yet before you knew it was me, you seemed more than happy to grind against my arse.”
“Mr. Malfoy!” A piece of parchment hits the side of my head, and I whip around to throw it right back to the person who threw it. I never get the chance.
Malfoy’s hands—both hanging down by his side now—twitch, and it looks like he is stopping them from moving. Moving where? Harry wonders about the man in front of him. About how much he’s changed since the war. It no longer feels as stifling to be trapped in a cupboard with him; Malfoy wouldn’t hurt Harry. Harry opens his apparently-closed eyes and his breath catches. The walls around him seem to be much closer than they were earlier, and so is Malfoy. With only a hair’s breadth between them, Harry can see each and every pore on Malfoy’s nose. He can see the carefully disguised rings under his eyes, and if he allows his gaze to drop slightly, he can also see thin little lines around Malfoy’s permanently pursed lips. Except they aren’t pursed right now, not exactly. They are pressed tightly together, curled into each other like he’s preventing himself from speaking.
“Two weeks… until what?” Hermione asks, although the lack of shine in Harry’s eyes is enough for me to realise exactly what he is saying.
In the end, the hot chocolate competition didn’t get very far. Draco got into the kitchen, prepared to make a replica of the hot cocoa he had made the very first night he arrived, only even better somehow, only to discover that there were a total of
“Oh believe me, that didn’t go unnoticed.” I shuffle closer to Harry so I can see the book, and maybe also because he’s warm and I’m shivering.
“Harry dear!” Mrs Weasley cries as she opens the door. She immediately pulls Harry into a crushing hug, and Draco watches awkwardly as he melts into it.
“Good. I’m glad to see that Harry and Draco aren’t biting the other’s head off this time.” She smiles at us, and I feel something within me shift. I don’t like it.
He watches as Harry takes a deep breath in before reaching a hand out. Harry runs his fingers along the top edge, a faint blue colour that gives nothing away. He sucks in another breath and carefully holds onto the canvas, turning it around so he can see it.
Harry shrugs on the red hoodie Draco had taken from him a week ago. It hasn’t been washed, and the smell of Draco is strong. He melts into it and allows himself to be happy for a moment. This isn’t something he normally indulges in, so he breathes in and closes his eyes. Draco would kill him if he saw Harry right now, but the thought only makes Harry happier. His heart stutters and then beats quickly, his chest lighting up.
Harry smiles to himself but doesn’t stop running. He’s come so far, he’s not going to turn to look at Draco, no matter how beautiful he’ll look in the bright sun.
A few minutes later, they are sitting on the sofa, drinking out of the hideous mugs. Draco is shivering in the cold, but the drink warms him up from the inside out. He wraps a blanket tighter around himself, looping it over his shoulders and tugging it into place. Potter’s teeth chatter from the other end of the couch, and he absentmindedly shuffles closer to Draco. Draco takes another sip of his drink, hands wrapped around the mug and allowing it to warm his skin. He sighs as the steam rises onto his face and he feels the cold drift away.
“Fucking Merlin!” I retort. She makes me want to pull my hair out sometimes at how observant she is. “How on earth could you know that?”
When he focuses back in on the blond man, a coil of warmth flows through him and settles in his stomach. Malfoy is even closer now, their chests only a millimetre away. Once again, it would seem as if the walls have been pushed inwards.
Harry writes down everything he heard them say, theorising on what it could mean and what it could affect. He has multiple ideas, but none of them have enough backing to be at all conclusive. It isn’t enough to get them arrested, definitely not on terrorist charges. He groans and shoves the papers away. Normally, he’d stash them in a file so he doesn’t have to see them unless it’s absolutely necessary. Here and now though, he doesn’t have that ability. He could always try to Transfigure something… No, it’s not even worth trying. He’d probably explode the cottage and everything inside. Not worth it.
“…yes I know. We’re doing everything we can to make sure that doesn’t happen, and if it takes too long we will intervene.”
“Phase 2 is complete,” he announces. “I have shrunk myself to the size of a blade of grass, and will now progress into the house and to Phase 3.”
So it’s been a month... I hadn’t realised it had been that long... Regardless, here we are. Enjoy this part, and stay safe during quarantine and isolation Xx
heads pushed together makes Harry suck in a breath, but he refuses to think on it further. Thoughts like that don’t belong at the dining table with the other person asleep on the couch. He needs to concentrate on his food, not on his other… needs.
Draco smiles, slightly reassured. Just because Harry likes it doesn’t mean Blaise will, especially not with the amount of bias Harry now holds.
“Potter,” Draco states. Without sparing the man another thought, he turns and makes for the Floos again. Potter looks like he is about to break the silence and say something, and the image runs around Draco’s mind as the green flames run around his body.
Harry tugs him into the little bakery, and as the bell on the door chimes, Draco is enveloped in the smell of baking bread. He sighs and relaxes, his body losing its tension at the sight of rising dough under warm lights. There’s gingerbread men and tiny Christmas cakes in the display counter, and Draco catches Harry looking at them with something like envy. Why he’d be envious of something not even alive is beyond Draco, but he doesn’t comment.
Harry tugs me out of the room the second I’m clothed, closing the door behind us and not looking back. It’s strange. I assumed that he would want a bit of time to look around. To remember everything that’s happened here, to take time to say goodbye. Chances are we won’t come back here after today. I thought he would have wanted to grieve his godfather’s house, but apparently not.
“If I knew at some point I don’t remember now. It’s definitely in the first week though.” I recall something about it being planned for April, but having to be moved. I think. Replaying that to Granger, I watch as Potter stands and stretches. His muggle shirt lifts and a sliver of stomach is revealed above his jean’s waist. I tear my eyes away, but not before he notices. Fuck. I’ve become slightly addicted to seeing things like that in this past week. Just accidental clothing movement, each time revealing a little bit more skin than is usually visible. And he’s become quite good at catching me. At least he never brings it up.
Draco sinks back onto the sofa, falling into the cushions. He curls up in a ball, his eyes wide open. It’s hard to swallow so he doesn’t, he just lies there. Draco yawns, his body telling him to go to sleep even as his heart races at the idea. He doesn’t know what to do, doesn’t know what he
Harry isn’t supposed to come to Draco’s apartment without a reason. Not unless they want to shag everywhere and get nothing done. Yet he stood there, in the kitchen, head in his hands and bottle on the countertop.
“It didn’t,” Draco replies, moving so he’s next to Harry. “Nothing permanent that couldn’t be healed.”
“Hey, Harry!” It’s Weasley. I feel Harry turn to face him, and I do the same. When Weasley sees that I’m here, he frowns.
Harry still says nothing, his hand continuing to trail over Draco’s jaw. His face doesn’t convey pity or sadness, for which Draco is unconditionally thankful for.
“Draco,” Harry breathes. “You did it!” He tugs me close and plants his lips on mine. The kiss is lingering this time, long and full of emotion. His tongue prods my lips and I let him in, smiling through it. When we pull apart I’m out of breath and so happy it’s shameful. Or, it would be if I wasn’t too pleased to care.
Harry shakes his head, hiding a smile and standing up. “Do you want coffee? Or would you prefer sleeping a bit longer?”
into the pillow beneath his head, turning to nose at it. Harry gasps and then slaps a hand over his mouth. He swallows dryly and begins to creep away. He makes it into the hallway before realising that he’d left his papers there. Cursing, he tiptoes back into the living room.
What else can he do to warm up? He’s tried warming charms on both himself and the room at large, and neither had much of an affect. Harry yawns, his jaw clicking and eyes closing with the force of it. His teeth start chattering, and he realises he’s now cold
is behind this and it’s not just some big coincidence—doesn’t want to make it easy to get back. Standing up, Draco moves into the living area once again. It feels like all he’s done today is aimlessly wander around, even if he knows there is a purpose behind it. Clearing his head and willing himself to relax, he enters the living room. His eyes search for Potter on instinct, and is somewhat disappointed when he doesn’t see him. If he really listens though, he can hear him moving about in the bathroom still.
I feel a small bubble of joy well up in my chest, and I allow a grin to spread over my mouth. “Thank you Mother.”
“Malfoy!” A hand grabs at my arms, yanking them in front of me. “Don’t touch them!” I work out that it’s Potter instructing me, and I want to roll my eyes at him trying to save me. My only response—apart from my hands being held at my front and not clawing at my skin—is a growl of pain. I hear Potter say something, but I can’t discern what. Fortunately, I don’t have to think about too much because my wrists are bound in rope. He cast a fucking
The rest of the investigation went on uneventfully. The purple blob that Draco had pulled from Harry’s back turned out to be the only part of the curse that was removable. Any remaining physical curse was permanently stuck in the walls of the house. Since the investigation went on into the night, Draco was long gone when they decided it would be best to Bombarda the whole thing. Draco was instead waiting up next to Harry’s bed in St Mungos. Due to the severity of the curse that had shredded a line across Harry’s back, the MediWitch thought it best for Harry to stay overnight. She had easily spelled away the twisted white line that had been left when Draco first healed the injury, and then checked over everything. She had then complimented Draco on his work, and left them alone.
Harry nods. “How many more tests could we possibly try though? I feel like all we’ve done is run diagnostics.”
“What’s more to give you, Draco? A fourth finger?” Harry asks, teasing the muscle with his tongue. It twitches around his fingers, pulling a grunt from Harry.
I think that it’s finished. I can’t detect any more bone in me where it shouldn’t be, and my back feels utterly exposed. I’m about to snap at Potter to release my hands and face, but I can’t. I can’t because the world goes black, and my senses drop away.
Draco huffs. “Our friends are setting us up,” he says, unable to keep his voice from shaking. Warmth rushes to his cheeks in what he knows is a furious blush.
“What would you like today, gentlemen?” A teenage boy with purple hair and lots of freckles asks them.
Potter blinks at him and then glares. “Very funny Malfoy. I can see why you’re an Unspeakable with that attitude.”
Harry bends low to avoid a branch, sidestepping a large root in the ground. His feet fly over the obstacles with no input from his mind. He jumps over a log and a gaping hole in the ground, landing on the other side. His foot slips and he falls, arms supporting his entire body weight as his legs hang in the hole.
Draco makes his way, excruciatingly slowly, towards the sofa. He fixes his eyes on the blanket-covered lump sleeping there, knowing it’s Harry. The call of warmth and comfort is strong and it revives Draco’s brain just slightly. He finally makes it to the sofa, and reaches an arm out to shove Harry back further. Harry’s back hits the sofa cushion and he groans in his sleep, complaining at being pushed. Draco ignores it, lifting the blankets off Harry a bit so he can slide in as well. His own blankets fall off his shoulders and become a crumpled pile on the ground, but it’s okay.
“Good luck,” I say, praying that my voice doesn’t give away how scared I am for his safety. It trembles slightly, but beyond that it’s fine.
I don’t know when I started having urges like that. They have become a big part of my day though. Constantly wanting to touch the man near me, but not letting myself reach out. Constantly biting my tongue so I don’t let anything slip. It’s exhausting but thrilling at the exact same time. And I’m terrified. I know what it means. I’m not stupid. I
“Sorry, sorry,” he says at a much more dignified volume. “I found it!” He pushes the other books off the coffee table onto the floor, and opens his one flat.
Draco feels his cheeks burning, and fervently wishes that it doesn’t spread down his neck. “Yes, because I’m gay Potter. It’s not exactly a secret.” No such luck. At having the spotlight turned on himself, his skin heats all the way down to his shoulders.
The gathering at the Weasleys’ is a much more relaxed affair. Harry had persuaded him into jeans and a t-shirt—the pink one, which Harry apparently likes quite a bit—and had told him in no uncertain terms not to bother with a bottle of wine. Draco feels out of his depth approaching the Burrow, unsure of his welcome. What if they hate him? They probably
Draco nods yet again. “Yeah, but it doesn’t look that old. A peak this high with such a gentle rise is extremely rare, and can only be created from months of daily exposure. I’ve never seen anything like it.”
His eyes blink open, a sliver of light reflecting off the bright green of his iris. “Draco,” he returns, smiling softly. He looks at him like he is the answer to all of life’s mysteries, and Draco shifts at how exposed it makes him feel. How bare he is to Harry. He’d never change it though, not when he feels so comfortable with him as well.
And then there’s the Seekers. Potter and I are on opposite ends of the pitch, scouring the sky for a tiny, and deadly fast golden ball. Both of us are diving every so often, fooling the other into thinking we’ve found it. I rake my eyes in every direction, almost straining with the effort. That’s when I see movement out of the corner of my left eye. I instead turn my head to the right and take off in that direction. I can hear the Snitch’s wings beating next to my head, but I never look at it. I can now see Potter chasing after me, seeking the right to victory for his team. He pulls up behind me, and I can feel his gaze linger on my every move, looking for the ball. But I’m dragging him in the other direction, away from his sought after prize. And he’s falling for it. Thinking he’s so clever all the while making an utter fool of himself. I then grab the front of his broom from behind me and spin it around, sending the boy whirling to the ground. Turning my own broom the other way, I start to chase after the Snitch. The golden streak never leaves my sight, and I twist and turn around the other players. The crowd is cheering me on, and Slytherin is going to win. I reach forward with my right my hand, my left still on the broom, steadying it so I don’t fall. I make to grab the ball and pull it from the sky, but I come back with nothing. I stare at my hand and then the spot where the Snitch was, utterly confused. Then the crowd stands and starts cheering wildly again. I look around me and see Potter holding his hand up high. I can just make out a streak of gold in between his thumb and the palm of his hand. He faces me and an amused smile lights his face. That’s it. My broom drops from my hand, and I’m rushing to meet the ground.
His fingers trail over the skin on Draco’s shoulders, wrapping around to his neck. Draco groans, his head dropping to Harry’s shoulder. Harry smiles softly, his vision focusing in on Draco and blocking everything else out. Draco’s head snaps up when Harry’s hand curls around the back of his neck. He gazes at Harry, eyes dark with lust and want. It snaps Harry’s restraint, and he closes the gap between them.
The second Harry claps twice, the game commences. Light is immediately extinguished, and everyone runs off in the dark. I look around, squinting and willing my eyes to adjust to the lack of light as quickly as possible. The point of the game may be to test my skills, but I would also like to get used to being in darkness. I turn around, lazily walking in circles and keeping my ears peeled. A scuffle off to the left of me alerts me to another person close by. Determined, I dim the lights even further and creep off away from them. The person turns out to be Ron, his disgruntled slurs very distinct.
Upon closer inspection, Draco realises that Potter is only wearing the pair of sweatpants he’d had on yesterday. Draco shivers at the sight of him shirtless in nothing but sweatpants—the idiot must be freezing! He doesn’t really know why, but the realisation of Potter’s near-nakedness makes him feel even more off kilter. He pushes through the bedroom, trying to keep as quiet as possible. He arrives at the cupboard he’d found his clothes in—either an exact replica of his usual closet or his actual closet having been spelled here somehow—and tugs the doors open. They pull out with a soft swooshing sound across the rug, and Draco nervously looks over his shoulder. Potter is still sleeping, blissfully unaware of the intrusion. He flicks through the clothes before choosing a simple but crisp black button down and a pair of pale blue Muggle jeans.
“What is it? It smells amazing,” Draco says, placing his bookmark between the pages and setting it on the coffee table.
“Shouldn’t that make it perfect? Strength and endurance against the evil spirits?” I shake my head at him.
Miss Stinton walks back out into the corridor, and Draco’s eyes sweep over the room again. They immediately catch on someone he’d rather hoped he wouldn’t see this morning. His blood runs hot at the sight of a mop of black curls sitting atop a very familiar, tanned face. Emerald eyes stare back at him, a hint of mockery in them.
“Try one!” Potter offers him the bag. Draco is sorely tempted, but stubbornly shakes his head. “Oh come
“Fuck, Draco,” Harry exclaims as he sprints back to me. There is something clinking—glass?—next to me, and then the sound of a cap unscrewing. “So much blood,” he utters, panicked. Something soft and warm presses against my skin, right where it burns the most. The fabric is wet, covered in something that stings. Whimpers fall from my mouth, tears streaming down my face. Harry’s hand rubs my shoulder, helping me through silently. The fabric is removed, cold air rushing to replace it. Magic washes over me, quelling the pain slightly. My entire body tingles with it. Harry says something under his breath, and suddenly my skin feels dry. The blood has been Vanished.
, we, because we are working this case together,” Draco says. “What else could I possibly have meant?”
“Yeah,” Draco says, rubbing the back of his neck. “I wasn’t sure what to get you, and I know how much you like to write, so I thought…”
The second map doesn’t show paths and trails, only pinpoints people’s location. Harry’s own point on the map is blue, standing out stark against the red magic creating a three dimensional map in the air. He scans it, eyes quickly falling to a purple point a little ways off. Harry feels relief drain into his body as he realises Draco must be alone. His eyes follow the point as it moves, travelling steadily towards the courtyard. The bastard has found a faster route, and is hoping he’ll make it there before Harry.
“Hmm. It would seem so.” Potter looks ecstatic, clearly happy to be doing the decorating. Of course he’d like doing something like that. He looks over his shoulder at Bones and Goldstein, and my eyes follow. They are staring at each other like they’ve just been paired with Mordred himself. I can see the rage shimmering in the air, and am silently happy that I wasn’t paired with either of them.
Harry inclines his head in thanks and dashes into the bathroom, the shower starting up barely a second later.
The day they started drooping, I became terrified. I knew what had caused it, but I didn’t want to think about. Angels are rarely men. And when they are, they don’t usually survive for very long. My life up until now was, rather dangerous. I always thought that if the war hadn’t killed me, I would’ve eventually died from being an angel. I guess it’s both.
. Harry’s chest burns as he scrabbles to stand up, praying that his glasses haven’t shattered with the impact. He hits his head on the ceiling of the Cabinet, and realises they are, in fact, still in one.
He keeps the kiss slow, innocent and gentle. His hands find Draco’s on his own head, holding them securely and prying his fingers out of his hair. Draco whines as his hand is removed, but Harry allows to move it to the back of his neck. He seems to perk up at that, deepening the kiss.
deal with Malfoy this early. “Look Malfoy, you had a bath last night. There’s no way you're dirty already, and I haven’t showered properly since Monday. You can shower after me if you really must.”
that she was the leader he saw that day in the forest. He’s surprised she had it in her, but clearly her morals aren’t what Harry thought they were.
“Harry?” I ask as I turn to look at him for might be one of the last times. His hands are in balls by his sides, his face set. His mouth is pressed into a grim line of concentration, and I want to change that expression for even just a second. Taking a step closer to him, I lean in and whisper, “Thank you. For everything.” I turn my head and see that Hermione has completely turned away, giving us some privacy. On a whim, I wrap my arms around Harry and squeeze. It’s our third hug. I allow myself to rest my head next to his as his wrists lock behind my neck.
Harry paces into the water, reveling in the cool liquid now reaching the bottom of his thighs. He feels his boyfriend stiffen against him, and runs a hand down his exposed, pale, muscular back. The comforting action seems to help, as Draco relaxes again and opens his eyes. Harry meets his gaze, eyes lingering, before turning around to face the oncoming waves. He presses against Draco at his back, and sighs as he feels Draco’s arms wrap around his waist and chest.
Potter has moved along from the doorway, and appears to be about to rummage through the kitchen. Draco is about to reprimand him for stealing somebody else’s food, before remembering that Potter couldn’t detect anyone having ever used the cottage. He frowns. That’s rather strange, isn’t it? But then Potter cries out in glee and there is a lot of rustling. Draco looks up to see him opening a bag of weird, circular things. When Potter puts it in his mouth there is a very loud crunch, and he all but
Hermione rolls her dark eyes. “I know you two are dating. I’m fine with it and I want to be closer with you to show Harry that.”
“Do you have somewhere in mind?” Draco asks after a moment of silence. The snow from Monday has all but melted away, and all that’s left is a few puddles of water.
A stone flies at Harry, landing at his feet and thudding into the snow. Harry shouts something unintelligible at Draco, but there’s no response. He listens carefully, trying to pinpoint where Draco is behind him. There’s nothing, no sound to give away another person’s presence. He slows to a stop, turning his body fully to search for him.
When our lips finally meet, my eyes slide closed and I sigh heavily. We fit perfectly together. I slowly start to respond to his insistent kiss, marveling at how right this feels. How right we feel. Harry is the one that opens his mouth first, but I stop it there. Today is not the time to snog in a forest. He understands doesn’t try again, just allows his hands to rub circles on the small of my back. When we finally break apart, Harry is smiling a silly grin at me and I feel impossibly stupid.
Draco arrives about an hour later, hair flopping in his eyes and paint streaked down his hands and arms again. Harry’s heart clenches at how beautiful he looks splattered in colour, but tries to ignore him. Draco scoffs, which quickly becomes a laugh, and Harry looks up without having written a single word.
Their server is a middle aged woman with greying blond hair, tucked into a bun. She looks at them expectantly, notepad and pen ready to take down their order.
“Yep.” Draco berates himself for using such a common word. Potter is already influencing him, and it’s only been a very short while. Except, Draco doesn’t remember Potter using that word today… Damn it.
“How does she have so much energy?” Ron groans. I look at him, and for the first time I notice the beads of sweat rolling down his forehead and neck. When I flick my attention to Harry, I see him flushed and sweaty too, his normal mop of hair somehow worse than normal.
The class muffle their laughs quickly, and I turn towards Potter. I set my glaring gaze on the boy, but he just smirks right back at me. I roll my eyes at him and turn back to the front, where I begin to pay attention. I can’t let that happen again.
The atmosphere around him changes, the world becoming bright and colourful. Flashes of pink, blue, and yellow whirl past him. He’s reminded of sprinkles, or even gingerbread, before he thuds to the ground. It’s a soft thud, not followed by any screaming pain. That has to be a good thing, he thinks. Draco blinks his eyes open, and instantly wishes he never had. Snow, as far as the eye can see. But not just snow, no. The gods really
“You can sit down. I don’t want you falling because you’re dizzy and stubborn.” Potter sets his jaw and Draco knows he won’t budge.
“Ensure this match is quick and clean. Any serious injuries and the Captains, or someone else, are allowed to call a TimeOut. Otherwise, you play on.” Madam Hooch glances at all of us, daring us to say otherwise. She blows her whistle again, the balls are released, and the game commences.
A sleepy voice murmurs his name and Draco whips his head around, not paying attention to the cracking joints. Suddenly, everything comes flooding back. He’s on the sofa, wrapped up in blankets—and apparently, Potter.
“If it was my friends and Robards behind this, why would they set a trap for you? Why would there be a hole with a core identifier, purely for you to fall down?”
With one last, quick kiss, Harry tears off in the other direction. He throws a glance over his shoulder to look at Draco, winks, and continues running.
“What are you doing in England?” He murmurs to the bird as it lands next to him, knowing full well that it can’t hear him or understand.
“A week ago after we bought your potions, I sent Cynthia a letter. We agreed that Salazar Slytherin would be our password so she’d know it was us.”
Towards the end of class, Professor Falco announces that we will have an assignment due at the end of the term. The class predictably groans, and she stands at the front of the room with a gleam in her eye. Like she knows something we don’t.
He smiles, humming along as he sets about cleaning up. In theory, this is not something he should enjoy at all. It’s dirty and grimy, wet, and something a house-elf should do. That doesn’t change the fact that it’s warm water on a freezing day, and satisfying to make the unusable plates serve a purpose again. He supposes it’s related to his own history and the
Time passes, the banana long gone and the warming charms fading. Harry has walked through the forest all the way to the other side, only getting scared a couple of times—at one point he’d thought he was being followed, which he was, but it was by a squirrel and not a person. He gets to the part where the trees thin, and he pushes the branches aside to see the village once again. The same feeling of relief passes through him as he leaves the forest and walks onto open ground. The village is just as empty as usual, but it’s less unsettling now. Maybe he’s just become accustomed to the deserted buildings, but it’s not as off-putting as before.
“Do you want to try something else?” Malfoy asks, tucking his hair behind his ear in the way Harry’s become obsessed with.
Potter sighs heavily, his breath a loud huff in the near-silent cottage. Then, incredulously, he inches closer. At first, Draco thinks he imagined it. But then it happens again. Draco watches him, and Potter looks directly into his eyes, searching for something. Whatever he was looking for, he seems to find it. Without another word, he shuffles much closer, his body barely a few inches away.  Draco swallows, runs a hand through his mussed hair. Gathering his limited courage, he lifts his hips and moves down the sofa. He presses their thighs firmly together, and nearly groans at the warmth he finds there.
Harry needs an Auror partner. They’re supposed to calm you down, help you see rationally. That’s why every Auror is assigned one. Except he is alone, no one but the trees witnessing this break down. He runs on, his chest starting to burn with the need for oxygen. At last the sky becomes visible, a break in the forest. It could just be another clearing, but it looks like the end. The end of the forest and an entrance into daylight. He pushes harder, ignoring the pain in his throat and legs. Water and air can wait for safety.
Draco hurriedly slides the drawer closed again, just in time to block the blinding light from escaping. Harry blinks rapidly, trying to clear his eyes from the sudden light and then subsequent lack of. He pulls his wand out of his coat pocket and flicks it, lifting all of their bags and belongings into the air. Draco rushes back around to the front and grips Harry tightly. He’s nervous, terrified even. Harry doesn’t blame him; he is too.
As he thinks that through, he realises that’s not actually too bad an idea; just like Potter’s other ideas this morning. On the contrary, it sounds rather… pleasant. To fall asleep on top of someone else, to have their arms wrap around him and hold him close. Okay, maybe he’s a bit touch starved… He can deal with that later. Draco breathes deeply, slowing his own breathing and allowing himself to melt into the body next to him. He doesn’t care that it’s Potter, that this isn’t something he should be doing. He doesn’t think twice as his eyelids droop, heavy and tired. He doesn’t worry when he drifts off, darkness taking over his vision and dragging him into sleep.
It’s a bottle of his favourite cologne, which he’d just run out of before being whisked away. He smiles at her, thanking her while watching Harry open his own. It’s also a glass bottle, but instead of cologne it’s—
dizzy, so he hopes it has the same effect on Draco. He slides down further, taking more and more of Draco’s cock into his mouth. It’s warm and sensitive, and he’s pulling Draco apart. Harry moans around it, swirling his tongue over the skin in his mouth.
Life is getting worse. It’s harder and harder each day to tell myself that it will be okay. Two days ago, I was beaten into unconsciousness for arriving after my curfew. The wind had made it nearly impossible to fly, and I struggled the whole way to the Manor. Being the stubborn prat that I am, I was confident that I would make it back before 11pm. I shouldn’t have taken the risk.
Harry’s bedroom is an organised mess. There is a dark green wall directly opposite the door, which when Draco’s eyes focus turns out to be a vertical garden. His eyes scour the room for another brief second, and his attention catches on the bed. It’s massive, with gold and silver blankets. Draco doesn’t think he’s ever seen such a comfortable looking bed, but he doesn’t get to think of anything else before he’s being slammed back against the door. Harry pushes his hands onto either side of Draco’s head, desperately searching for Draco’s mouth. Draco rushes forward to meet him, and they both groan. Harry gently shoves Draco back to the door, and Draco understands that Harry wants to lead this. He has no qualms about that.
He looks at me, waiting for my confirmation for him to continue. When I nod, he rises onto his knees and away from my torso. His hands find my belt and rush to unfasten it. When it is out of the way, he sets his smouldering gaze on mine, and stares at me as he undoes my button. His fingers find my fly, and starts to unzip my jeans. His mouth latches onto my earlobe and nips at it, pulling it away from my face. Once they are undone, he moves his kisses to my neck, and starts sucking at the soft skin he finds. At the same time, he lets his hands pull my pants down around my thighs. This leaves my underwear for him to discard, and then my naked skin. I feel my body quiver in anticipation, seeing stars under Potter’s hands and mouth. I melt into his touch, but still manage to open my eyes when his hand runs along the elastic of my underwear. He lowers his hand and finds my bulging cock waiting for him. He palms it gently, moaning himself. He moves down me and slowly licks the cotton around my erection. I release an animalistic hiss and Potter looks up at me, delighted. While his mouth is busy, his hand are not, and they go to pull down my briefs. He slides them off my hips, and his mouth leaves a trail of kisses down my thighs. His hungry eyes tick to my cock, and they light up. He kisses his way back up to my crotch and breathes my scent in. His hands are now on either side of my sensitive skin, and I’m making quiet, mewling sounds. But as soon as his hand grabs around my throbbing erection, the scene wilts. It burns away until I’m left alone, in a silent, cold, stone room. Water is dripping in puddles on the floor. My hands twist in something I can’t see, and a scream is ripped from my throat.
He turns away, not able to take his reflection and the reminder of an event years ago. He hopes Harry doesn’t barge in this time. He doesn’t want to bleed, even if he deserves it.
Harry takes his mug back to the couch and picks up the book he’s yet to start still. He would have yesterday, but then they’d fallen down a spiral of suspecting their friends and trudging through forests, so he’d never gotten to it. He sips his coffee, burns his tongue, and places it down on the coffee table to cool a bit. He picks up his book and flips to the first page, starting to read.
Growing desperate when no one appears, Draco turns to the wall and begins to scrabble. His nails dig into the dirt, feet trying to lift off the ground. The wall is smooth, no footholds in sight. It’s metres tall too, Draco would have to be a seriously talented climber to make it to the top. Even if he managed to get a foot off the ground, he would be too tired to support himself. He’d no doubt slip off the wall the second he got off the ground. Sighing through his screams, he kicks up a frenzy. His shoes are coated in dust, dirt caking into them. He shouts again, voice going hoarse and throat beginning to burn. There’s nothing for it, he hasn’t made any progress. His feet are still on the ground.
Harry pushes Draco forward. “Draco here is looking for something, a bracelet I believe?” He asks, directing the question at Draco himself.
Harry shakes his head. It’s useless arguing that Draco couldn’t actually manage to kill anyone, or that it was his choice to follow Voldemort. He gets like this sometimes; so sure that he is that same, broken boy he was at seventeen, even a decade later.
The Ministry is devoid of life, silent, their reflections the only ones on black glass. It’s odd. Normally the Atrium would be bustling on a Saturday morning, all the weekend workers eager to get started for the day. There isn’t anyone here though, and that doesn’t sit right with me. It’s too simple. Way too easy.
A small hand brushes against Harry’s back, so subtle that Harry thinks he’s imagined it. It’s only when that same hand rests firmly against his robes that he realises that it’s very real. Malfoy is trying to ease Harry’s discomfort. A small noise escapes his throat, and the hand hesitantly rubs up and down. Harry feels sick to his stomach, and focuses his attention on the point of contact in order to keep grounded. Slowly but surely his breathing slows down, and when he can no longer feel his heart thumping in his chest he turns back around. Malfoy is right in front of him. So close Harry can see each individual eyelash. How has he never noticed how pretty Malfoy’s eyes are? The way the grey catches the limited light from their wands creates a shining silver, little flakes within that look like sunshine through glass. Harry forces his mouth shut, pressing his lips into a thin line to stop himself from talking.
Draco harrumphs loudly, knowing it’s true, before turning on his heel to leave the dance floor. When he looks back, Potter is staring at him and shrugging before turning to dance with someone else.
As their foreheads rest against each other, Harry becomes aware of everyone in the Room cheering. Everyone. Not just the guys he was playing with, but the girls and other guys as well. Harry sighs, but he can’t help the smile on his lips.
Harry smiles gently, before slowly bringing their lips together. This time, it isn’t passionate or hungry, but slow and sweet. As if he agrees with everything said in the darkened room, and wants Draco to understand that he will always be that chain.
He doesn’t enjoy it this morning. He can’t get the water to cooperate, staying glacial in the cold air. Harry tries to wash his hair, but he can’t bring himself to dunk his head under the freezing water. It’s only as he turns the two knobs off and the water slows to a trickle that he remembers he could have spelled it warm. Groaning, he rushes through drying himself off and getting dressed.
“Haha,” she says, face humourless. “The one where in half a month they want to scream bloody murder in the Unspeakables’ Department.”
Hermione fixes him with an odd look, and he knows there’s no way of avoiding a conversation. Or a telling off, really, no matter how many times she claims it’s not. Sighing, he forces his features into a neutral expression and chats with Ron about inconsequential things. The next Chudley Cannons game somehow comes up—despite Harry furtively trying to avoid it—and Ron grins as he explains to Harry just
me,” Harry says, eyebrow lifting. “I don’t want to move that quickly, and I’d like there to be some transition period.”
Voldemort is in the living room of Malfoy Manor, discussing what the next move will be. Father is listening intently, and I’ve been banished to my room, so it must be vital. Maybe there’s new information. Maybe they are planning another battle. I hope I’m not asked to participate. I never asked to be a part of this. I wish I wasn’t. Mother has grown increasingly concerned recently. She is the only confidant I have. The only person I can talk to. Her once beautiful hair has rapidly been turning grey and warn. The wrinkles riddling her skin are more pronounced than last year, and she is growing frail. I’m terrified of losing her, because that’s where I feel we’re heading.
” I joke. “I don’t call you Weasle… although I could.” I raise my eyebrows at that and Harry slaps my waist gently.
Harry draws our attention back to him, and when I glance in his direction he looks like he has a plan. A very detailed plan, I amend, now that I’ve noticed the glint in his green eyes.
Harry pulls Draco along with him, breaking into a run as they make their way out of sight and into the forest. He pauses, figuring out which way to go. Once he knows, he begins running again.  He doesn’t wait for Draco to catch his breath before, and he feels his face flush as he runs after him
Harry hums. The bread is perfectly golden, cheese melting out the middle. “They look delicious Draco.”
Draco scowls at him but puts the coffee down and races to get changed into actual clothes. He comes back a minute later in black trousers which hug his thighs, and a pale blue sweater. Harry’s eyes rake over him, and Draco feels his heart stutter. Even if Harry isn’t going to make a move anytime soon, Draco is certain something will happen eventually.
The dull thud grows more pronounced, and Draco sucks even harder. He pulls off for a second to lick hotly from the base to the tip, before fastening his mouth back in place.
He collapses onto Draco, crushing his legs and covering his own chest in sticky come. Harry doesn’t care though, pressing kisses all over Draco’s chest as he slowly pulls out.
the closest, warmest thing. Yeah, that must be it. Even so, it can’t happen. Draco can’t afford to allow himself to touch Potter.
Forcing my eyes closed and shutting the Healers out, I try to think about something that won’t cause me to panic. I think about the rough sheets I’m lying on, the bright white light that isn’t blocked out regardless of my eyes being closed, the bustle of people moving around in the corridor. None of them work. I try to think about Harry instead, think of the moments where it was just us. The times we paraded as boyfriends through London, the magical bookstore, the man behind the counter at the potion store, the nights we’ve spent in comfortable silence in the drawing room at Grimmauld. It warms my heart, yet at the same time it feels like a stab to the gut. Harry is bleeding in another room somewhere.
Potter has other ideas though, as he straddles Draco’s thighs with a devilish grin on his lips. He leans down and presses another kiss to Draco’s scars, before firmly grasping both of their cocks together in one hand.
Harry feels his face drain rapidly. Shit. He’d totally forgotten. “What’s the time?” He asks so quickly he’s sure the words were at least slightly jumbled up.
They turn to see where he’s gesturing and burst out laughing again. “It’s supposed to be a reference to
Harry knows that his childhood was shitty. He knows that he was abused, that being locked in a cupboard is neither normal nor acceptable. He knows that being forced to cook lavish meals at the age of six, but only receiving bread and water in return, was cruel. He knows this, but he still thinks Draco’s upbringing was worse.
of all people. But really, that isn’t fair. It was no doubt McGonagall who had paired them up. The Headmistress was the one who even came up with the idea of Eighth Year patrols, and she has been pushing for Interhouse Cooperation quite avidly… Yep, definitely McGonagall to blame here. Sighing deeply Harry storms out of the Great Hall, making sure to slam the door as loudly as possible on the way out. With some of his anger relieved in the delightful noise, he calms down enough to start working out where Malfoy could be. He would no doubt start near the Greenhouses, the methodical bugger, then he would work his way up. But when had he started? That would change his current position quite a lot. Filch said Malfoy arrived early, not surprising considering how he hates tardiness, but how early was
McGonagall furrows her brows, before replying, “I guess you can, if you would like. I just assumed none of you would want to set up.”
I scrub a hand down my face and groan. Something warm moves against my cheek and I’m instantly awake, reaching for my wand on the bedside table. But as my eyes adjust to the dark, I see that it’s Harry. Warmth rises up my face, a deep blush covering the skin.
“Yeah?” He asks, turning to me fully. When he sees my expression, concern takes over his features. “Is something wrong?”
He watches as the mistletoe keeps growing, protruding from the ceiling with a red ribbon tied around it.
It’s really quite interesting, what someone can learn just from watching them go about their lives. For example, Potter is always running his hands through his hair, scratching at his head. Always rubbing the back of his neck, as if it will somehow stop him feeling awkward or embarrassed. He does it quite a lot right now, always touching his head or neck. Draco doesn’t want to think about what that means. He doesn’t want to think too much about anything where Potter is concerned.
, and he already knew Malfoy was fit, but it still… irks him a little. Five years ago, he never would have done that.
I chuckle beneath my breath and tell her how to get there, as well as where the bathroom is in regards to the kitchen. She nods once more and makes her way down the hallway and then the stairs.
The leader—still standing in front of the others with hands on hips—calls for silence. To Harry’s surprise, they instantly drop the argument.
The trees end, the sun streaming through the clouds and reflecting off the snow. Harry covers his eyes, protecting them from the glare. He hadn’t registered it snowing overnight, but it obviously must have. Draco
I watch as they both turn away and walk along one of the rows near us. There is a black sign reading ‘Fantastical Creatures’ in white letters above the place they stop. Deciding that I don’t want to watch them contemplate books any more than I have to, I turn around and scan through the books. The section I’m in is labelled ‘Dark Proceedings’. I’m instantly reminded of my father and the reason why I’m here in the first place. A shiver races up my spine and I hurriedly move down the shelf. The new section is ‘Solving Inquiries’ and I sigh to myself in exasperation before reading through the titles. I’m so predictable. The only books I ever read are Auror novels, wizards trying to crack murder cases. It helps make me feel more in control, reading about people taking down men like the ones in the Manor.
“Technically it’s the basement, but the kitchen’s there too.” Potter has the sense to look sheepish at the fact that his kitchen is revolting and grimy, so I decide I’ll do as he wishes and look somewhere else.
Harry places the glass reindeer back on the edge of the fountain and stands up. He hauls Draco to his feet too—and when had Draco sat down in the first place?—and they make their way back to the cottage. There’s no doubt the first courtyard they found is a fake, they just need to know
Gathering his courage, he puts a hand on Draco’s shoulder. When it isn’t shrugged off, he grips hard and pulls Draco up to stand. Draco gasps, a sharp intake of breath. Harry looks into his eyes, waiting for a flicker of regret or worry. When that doesn’t come, he acts. Harry reaches forward and presses their lips together. It’s soft, gentle, and delicious. He pulls one hand up to the back of Draco’s head, threading his fingers in the shiny hair. Draco is still for a moment, before moaning and kissing back like his life depends on it. Harry loses the rest of the world for that moment, caught up in the sense of kissing Draco.
“Everyone needs to clear the area and wait outside of the wards that have been set up. New information reveals that the curse might still be active in this area.” Draco’s voice is firm and unnegotiable, a combination that he mastered ages ago. Nobody listens otherwise. Not to Draco.
Draco gets a spoon from the cutlery drawer and carries his breakfast to the dining table. It feels cramped and small without Harry’s presence, even though another person should make it feel tiny. It’s a sad spot for a table, pushed to the side wall with only two chairs. He sighs, but takes a seat. He wishes Harry were with him. Draco swallows hard, pushing the thought away. He’s literally down the hall, and will be back in no time.
Draco’s thoughts take a turn, and he is left remembering how he’d thrown himself at Potter and squeezed the life out of him. He was so relieved to see a face staring at him that he hadn’t cared about anything else for a long time afterwards. Now though, he realises that what at the time seemed to be him clutching at something warm and solid, was probably interpreted as a hug. And, it kind of was. Draco doesn’t
,” they explain, “but everyone who sees it just says it looks like a Grinch dick!” They laugh uncontrollably, shoulders shuddering with joy.
he finds his body. Maybe he hasn’t even noticed. Maybe, maybe he’s sitting on the sofa in the cottage, safe from the rain. He could be in front of the fire, warm and dry, forgetting about everything. Draco’s heart shrivels in jealousy. What he wouldn’t give to be there. To even just be out of the hole. He’d willingly walk all the way back to London if it meant he could be dry and level with the rest of the ground.
Harry quickly scans the room again, making sure none of their belongings are still strewn about, and once he’s satisfied, he races out of the bedroom and towards Draco. His breath catches as he rounds the corner and sees him though.
The sound of pots and pans rings in Draco’s ears, and he’s pulled from his trance. He’s splattered in paint yet again, his hands as pink as his shirt. There are spots of white on his black jeans, some seeping into the slits and onto his knees. He huffs at the mess he always seems to make when painting and stands up. He futilely swipes at the paint, finding it already dry. There’s no point in spelling any of it away either, since he’s just going to get more on himself later.
As Harry catches up to Malfoy, they fall into step swiftly and follow an invisible route through the castle. By the time they’ve reached the Fourth Floor, Harry is tired and irritable. There have been no students roaming the halls since he found Malfoy, making for a dull patrol. He would much rather be curled up in bed. Mind you, he wouldn’t have been asleep
“No! Did you decorate it?” Draco makes his way closer to Harry, taking in the rainbow tree from a distance.
Potter rocks back on his heels after a moment longer and walks back to the sofa. He catches Draco watching him and his eyes burn with something Draco can’t place. Draco looks away, eyes glancing at the fire cautiously.
This will be one of the last chapters. I’m thinking two more at the max, and probably an epilogue. Hope you enjoy!
Draco rushes through the corridors, twisting and turning and moving his gaze away from anyone else he happens to pass. The dark walls glow and he shakes his head, willing his vision to accustom to the light. By the time he gets into the correct room—and honestly, why wasn’t he told which room to go to—he’s out of breath and slightly flushed.
“What do you want?” Draco asks, launching himself at Harry and immediately sucking on his neck again. His hips grind into Harry’s, making his eyes fall shut and pulling a groan from him.
Hermione behind me tuts in annoyance, and I think I know why. I hear movement from where she is standing, and then she comes into view behind Harry. Her bushy hair sticks out from her head, obscured by Harry’s own. She moves forward so that she’s extremely close to him, and a trill of jealousy coils in my gut. She’s allowed to be so open with her affections, but if I make mine know he’ll surely reject them. I can’t allow myself to hope otherwise. Hermione turns his head and whispers something into Harry’s ear. His face instantly heats more than I previously thought possible, and he helplessly shakes his head. Hermione isn’t taking no for an answer, and spins him around to face her. She tries to murmur again, and again there’s a shake of a head. I stare at them, trying to figure out what they’re saying. But Hermione is clever, and has covered her mouth so I can’t lip read. This time when Harry moves, it’s a brief shrug of his shoulders. Hermione looks exasperated, but she drops it all the same.
Harry lies motionless behind him. Draco sighs and wriggles around, trying to encourage movement. He’s already much warmer, lying next to Harry and sharing body heat. But it’s not enough, and Harry isn’t getting the message. Draco needs him to actually hold him, to wrap him up.
Draco opens his eyes. It’s still dark, and when he turns to look out the window he finds the sky pitch black. What bloody time is it?! He slides his arms down the back of the sofa and searches around for his wand, finding it on the coffee table he’d Transfigured two days ago. Casting a Tempus and scowling when it returns as five am, Draco flops himself back down onto the sofa. There’s no sense in getting up so early, so he isn’t going to. As he pulls the blanket up over his shoulders again, he halts. Where did the blanket come from? He definitely hadn’t had it last night… He’d clearly fallen asleep on the sofa, but he couldn’t remember ever actually getting ready for bed. Normally he would have gone through an entire night routine, but he has no recollection of that from the previous night.
Harry’s mouth moves into a grin, and he slams his lips onto Draco’s in a fierce kiss. Draco’s breath catches in his throat but he returns it; for a moment.
“Fine, I’ll stop,” Harry gives in. He could never stand seeing Malfoy so visibly upset or temperamental. Not that he’d tell anyone; or that he really understands why himself.
Draco’s heart falls as she places it down. If it’s in the hallway, she’ll never see it again. It’s where she puts all the worthless art she’s given and doesn’t know what to do with. His heart clenches as the canvas falls over, the paint scuffing.
“It’s not your fault that you forgot about the Charms essay?” Hermione asks with a raised eyebrow that very clearly says she isn’t buying it.
He turns to Malfoy with a questioning look. Malfoy just shrugs. “It’s the same layout as the other one, I remembered the way.”
is a well known gay bar in Wizarding London. Despite everyone there knowing who he is and exactly what he has done, he can always find a way to forget the day. Whether that is drinking until he is stumbling home or losing himself in a stranger’s body, this club always works out. And today has been an especially hard one. Draco knows he isn’t the only man who has a challenging time sometimes. He does know though, that no one’s bad days are quite the same as his. No one else can say that they nearly killed people to save their own skin, or that they drugged multiple strangers, or that they let Death Eaters into Hogwarts… No matter how many people are telling him that he wasn’t a bad person, that he was just acting under duress, he can’t believe it. It’s a mindset, a dangerous one, but one that he takes comfort in all the same.
Draco seems to read his mind, reaching for his wand and vanishing Harry’s pyjamas and pants in one go. Cold hair hit his skin and he shivers, goosebumps rising to the surface. Draco instantly closes his mouth over Harry’s jaw, sucking on the spot he found earlier. Harry keens as his hand slips back between their bodies, skimming over his stomach. Draco drags his fingers through the line of hair beneath his navel, before dipping them down into pubic hair.
About an hour later Potter and I are through four books between us, and there have been about five sentences in total.
“What are you thinking about?” Potter asks, placing his stupid mug down on the coffee table and turning to face him.
“They has trackers on me. And in me. They always knew exactly where I was, and if I wasn’t back in the time limit I’d be cruelly beaten and isolated for days.” Granger’s eyebrows drawn down. “That kept me on schedule every time but once,” I chuckle cruelly.
Hermione smiles a small smile at him before turning back to Harry and I. “I can come back if you need me to, but…”
but at this point I can’t really find it in myself to care. My family is a group of self-serving arseholes, and it would probably be a good thing to wipe out the family line—excluding Mother and myself, of course. As long as I don't have to be the one to do it.
What he sees though, is Draco sitting up in bed reading. His book is one of the new ones he bought from the village, the cover a beautiful beach with ‘Merry Christmas’ written in the sand. The irony of Draco buying a Christmas romance while getting together with Harry isn’t lost on him. He frowns though, eyes moving down to his arms. If it isn’t Draco he’s holding… A pillow. A bloody pillow is in his arms. Harry sighs.
The man hums, eyes flicking over Draco’s face and then the many counters. “I don’t know if we sell anything like that…” he says after a second in thought. “I can have a look out the back if you’d like?”
“I did!” Harry snaps, hand running subconsciously through his hair. “I was so sure you were capable of change! Now though, I don’t know.”
Draco swallows, loud in the stillness. “Come on Potter. I’ll count down.” He shifts into a starting position—not a
He’s sweating even in the water, but he knows he can’t let the fever get the best of him. It’s not the worst he’s had, not by far, and he should be able to shake it off. First though, he
.” Draco’s voice falls into a murmur. He hates that the papers and gossip columns have kept his old allegiance so close to the surface of wizarding society, not even bothering to add an ‘ex’ in front of it.
The squirrel is soaked through and covered in leaves and mud, and Draco’s heart clenches. The little thing doesn’t deserve to be out in the rain, not like he himself does. It skitters around the hole, trying to jump out back onto the forest floor. When all attempts are fruitless, the squirrel gives up and tries to climb out instead. It spots the beginnings of the alcove Draco has been digging, and launches itself at it. The hole in the wall squelches as the animal lands in it, but it holds. Draco would have screamed if it hadn’t. The squirrel looks around from its vantage point, probably trying to find something else to jump off of.
else. A beach, perhaps? Unfortunately, his mind doesn’t seem to want to work for him. Images of Potter swimming, water trekking down his skin that’s shining in the sun, is all that plays behind his eyelids. He rapidly blinks them open.
“That’s what you’re worried about?” I can hear him laughing from the kitchen. My neck flushes as I realise how stupid that sounds out loud.
, making her moan. Hermione is quick to break it up, and the girls settle back down together, Pansy practically sitting in Lavender’s lap.
“Not quite. Someone needs to go debrief to McGonagall,” I remind them all. Goldstein groans and Harry sighs, clearly having forgotten.
“That was brilliant, Draco!” Hermione smiles, nudging Ron as she passes and murmuring something that sounds like ‘be nice, your eyes can be healed’.
Harry doesn’t make any noise, just runs his hand gently across Draco’s face and neck. His emerald eyes catch the softest light from the window, sparkling even in the dark. Draco knows he doesn’t have to continue, to elaborate, but something about the man next to makes him
Harry cheers and races back inside, grabbing a coat. Draco rolls his eyes at him, tells him to wait while he puts his things away, and floats the paints into the cottage. The brushes and palette clean automatically, the water evaporating from the glass. His paintings turn around so Harry can’t see them, and they float down the corridor into the bedroom.
Harry shakes his head on a soft laugh. “Of course they are,” he says, smiling. “Come on, pick a couple, and then we need to go.”
His feet seem to carry him there by themselves. Realising that most of the people in the Great Hall are watching him, he thinks that he might as well start his plan now. Refreshed with new purpose, Harry strides confidently up to the dais where the professors are eating. He climbs up to the platform and charms his voice louder so he doesn’t have to yell.
Harry leaves Malfoy to scan over the many books, and wanders across to a different section. This one seems to be dedicated to geography, and he barely hides his grimace. Geography was always his least favourite subject in Muggle school, so why anyone would want to read a book on it is lost to him. Then again, the books might include stunning pictures… Also might not, he reasons. Shrugging, he turns to face a different shelf.
His mother, Pansy, and Theo are all accounted for now. He only needs things for Blaise and of course, Harry. Draco discreetly shrinks the new bags and slips them into his pocket along with the jewellery and books, before taking off towards the tattoo parlour.
He finds Potter lying on the living room floor, furniture rearranged around him to create a clearing. He’s shirtless, and sweat trickles down his chest as he pulls himself up in a sit up. Draco’s mouth goes dry as their eyes lock, and Potter stares for a second before rolling back to the ground. Warmth rushes to Draco’s cheeks as he watches Potter workout, making no move to leave.
He sighs. He needs to talk to Malfoy about sleeping in the bed tonight. There’s no way on earth that Harry can spend another night on the couch. It’s only been two nights in a row, and his neck and back are already killing him. Harry should really talk to Malfoy about
I’m flown into an emergency room and quickly tucked into a bed. The MediWitch calls for another Healer, and a plump woman with grey waddles into view. She looks at my arm before rapidly speaking to the other woman. She grabs various potions off a trolley I hadn’t even realised was there, forcing them down my throat. I scrunch my nose up at the bitter taste and lumpy texture, but can’t bring myself to say anything about it. Wands are then drawn and swept over the cut. Most of their conversation isn’t understandable, and the things I recognise aren’t good. I don’t want to know how deep the cut is, how close it is to the humerus.
Draco feels a muscle in his jaw jump, and he forces himself to remain calm. Snapping and yelling won’t help. Pettiness, on the other hand…
“Then I’ll be able to know.” Harry fixes me with a confused glance, and I remember that I haven’t told him yet.
“Well, technically we are going in order to study ‘how butterbeer is like making potions’ or something,” he raises his voice an octave and signs air quotes with his fingers. Harry nods at Weasley and informs him that we are nearly done.
be at Hogwarts, but I’ve been pulled out for the remainder of Seventh Year. Potter isn’t there anyway, so I wouldn’t be doing much. Studies became quite boring Sixth Year, if I’m being honest.
I hum in agreement, and her hand traces lines towards the outside of my wing. She runs it down the outside arc, smoothing down feathers as she goes. Another hand joins in, and now I have hands on both of my wings. My left is definitely more sensitive, I realise as Mother gently caresses it. I nearly moan out loud, but catch myself in the last second. That would have been embarrassing.
Harry’s coat rustles in what Draco can only assume is a shrug. “Maybe they just decided they didn’t like the view.”
“What? Do you have plans for today or something?” It’s meant to come out as a drawl, but Draco doesn’t quite succeed. He hopes Potter misses it with his rapid moving and panicking.
Draco wakes up to something solid around his waist, to his chest pressed against something warm. He’s not cold for the first time in days, and it’s enough to make him sigh and snuggle in further. Whatever it is he’s wrapped in moves with him, shifting against his chest. Draco hums softly, his voice rough with sleep.
“Fettuccine Alfredo,” Harry answers, putting the remaining food into another bowl, covering it in cling wrap, and sliding it into the fridge.
“Don’t see why…” I murmur. Placing my book down onto the coffee table, I sit back down and glance up at the people in front of me for the first time.
“Potter?” He manages to say, his mouth not quite up to speed with his brain. Draco tries to get up, tries to wriggle out of the other man’s grasp, but he’s held tight.
He sets up in the same spot he did on Sunday, his paints and other things flying through the open front door and arranging themselves. Draco hears Harry snort from inside, but he flicks his wand again and the door closes and locks. Harry will
Taking a deep breath, I force myself to nod my head. While the majority of my pain is gone, some of it still remains - mainly the area directly next to my ‘wings’. Potter climbs onto the bed behind me, careful not to touch me anywhere. I hear him uncap the bottle, as well as the slosh of liquid as he draws some out with his wand. Usually you would place the injured part of your body into a little bowl and soak it, but since it’s my back it’s a little too big for that. And I guess my ‘wings’ would get in the way too. The tip of his holly wand presses into my bare skin, and a drip of cold liquid trickles down my back. I shiver as it spreads.
“You’re probably right,” Harry agreed. He walked over to the Dark walnut dining room, and shouldered on his backpack. Draco quirked an eyebrow at the excessive bag, and Harry shrugged at him.
“Are those mine?” He asks, eyes narrowed. He doesn’t really care—not at all, actually—but he doesn’t want Potter to know that.
“Draco,” he tests my name out, rolling it around in his mouth. He looks at me expectantly, and I realise that he wants me to say his name.
? He hadn’t thought Malfoy was dating anyone. He swallows, chest tight and sinking. “Who’s your partner?” He doesn’t think he wants to know the answer, but he doesn’t think he’ll be able to get past it without knowing.
So sorry this is a couple of days late! I had a rather shit and busy week. The next chapter is the last, so get ready for an ending! Xx
Eventually, Potter nudges him, shoulders bumping together gently. Draco is snapped out of his reverie.
“Excellent,” she murmurs, reaching across the table to pick up the closest one in the pile. They sit on a platter, lots of them, as if there were going to be more people.
He drags a single finger up Harry’s cock, making him jerk. Harry sees white spots behind his eyes, his vision blurring out. Draco’s finger slides through his precome, slipping around the head. Harry shudders. He wraps his hand around him, squeezing at the juncture where the shaft meets the head. Harry feels his blood pulse in his neck and cock, and he pushes his hips through the ring of Draco’s fingers.
, so lost in his thoughts as he was. “Going for a shower,” Draco snarls, almost daring him to deny that.
“Hello, Professor Parsons, this is Draidan.” Potter gestures to me. “He is the one in question today.” In question? Honestly, he really needs to learn how to phrase things more respectfully.
“It looks like a form of rapid aging…” he replies. “I’ve asked Hermione, I’m just waiting for her response. But I think it might be caused by the trauma of the Manor, mixed with her stress over your health.”
“I nearly drowned, Draco.” Harry pushed away this time, distancing himself as if he thought Draco would lash out. Draco has
“I’m lucky it’s still there, according to my MediWitches,” Harry says. “But I can’t feel it right now, so… okay?” He laughs softly.
He summons his notebook—which comes thumping out from the bedroom Draco is locked up in—and turns his wand into a pen. Once he has a clean page in front of him, he turns around on the couch and pulls his knees up. Using his thighs as a makeshift table, he scribbles out a messy heading and starts jotting down dot points. It’s important for him to summarise on paper before putting anything into a formal layout.
That was the year with the traitor Black escaping from Azkaban. The year with the stupid hypogriff breaking my arm. The year Granger punched me, and Potter laughed at me. Thankfully, that didn’t happen very often. My thoughts start straying back to life at Hogwarts, before the world turned a new head. Before my family started to repeatedly fulfill “tasks” and “assignments”. Before I had to seclude myself from my friends, the rest of Slytherin, and before I had to push myself to the extremes of my magical capabilities.
“No. It’s not that,” I say, clarifying. “Mind you, a new partner might be nice.” I can’t help but tack on a sarcastic note.
After the last three meetings of being dragged outside, Goldstein has decided that today he is staying inside.
Harry steps back and moves to the first cabinet, whipping his wand out. He casts an array of spells over the wood and glass, careful not to get anywhere near the jewellery. His brows draw down, and Draco wonders what he’s doing, unable to figure it out by the colour of the spell. Harry turns to the walls next, repeating the spells and lifting specks of blue and pink steam.
“A cupboard kind of… appeared? And inside it was that, and a few tubs of decorations.” Harry nods at the cupboard, and Draco’s eyebrows raise in surprise.
The third likely one is the dreaded Fire Angel from earlier. The boring one. To be fair though, it is actually kind of cool, sounding straight out of muggle fairy tales. Balls of fire, feathers that light up in the dark, and shooting flames from the eyes. I drag my gaze from Harry’s chicken-scratch of handwriting to the book. Alas, the skin around my eyes should have become thicker, and more leather-like in appearance than before my transformation. Double checking that my skin hasn’t actually changed, I find soft skin beneath my fingers. Sighing, I cross that one out too.
Harry takes a deep breath, his chest pressing into Draco’s back further. “Why are you here?” He asks, suspicion rising in his tone. “And why did you wake me up?”
Harry hums in delight as he looks at it; the sponge looks gorgeous, and the cream is so beautifully white. He knows Malfoy will love it, he just needs to get it to him. Harry slides two plates out of a cupboard and slices off a couple of pieces. He spells the Buche de Noel back to the fridge, and carries the plates to the living room.
“Here you go,” Harry says as he walks back to the bed. He’s holding a small parcel wrapped in paper, a white ribbon holding it in place. Draco doesn’t remember it from when he showed Harry the wrapping charm, which would explain why it’s kind of lumpy. How Harry managed that is beyond Draco, but then again, he’s never tried doing it by hand… He smiles at the prospect of Harry cursing and screaming as he wraps it for him though.
“Not that! I thought you were supposed to be clever Malfoy…” The last is mumbled, but I heard it none the less. “He has been spending all his free time with you! Turning us down because he has to ‘go study for DADA’ or ‘help Malfoy with the party’. I’m sick of it! I’m sick of you wasting his time!”
With that done, Draco walks around and looks for somewhere to buy bath things from. He passes the butcher, the baker, a home decorations shop that he doesn’t remember seeing before, and lots more. None of them will sell anything close to what he’s after. As he passes the grocer, he thinks ‘what the hell’ and turns into it. It was full of things last time he went shopping, so he might have some luck here. If not, it’s back to the drawing board for Pansy.
Harry shakes his head. “They aren’t entitled to your time, no.” He sips his wine. “That being said, you shouldn’t spend Christmas alone if you don’t have to.”
Harry pulls away, moving back to kiss Draco fiercely. He immediately slides his tongue into Draco’s mouth, between his lips. Draco moans, sucking it.
As he rifles through things, Harry finds all of the ingredients required for avocado and poached eggs on toast. Grinning at his luck of finding his favourite breakfast ingredients in an abandoned cottage, he gathers all of them up and lays them out.
I don’t reply, just shake my head and move his hand off me. “It’s not important.” I know I sound dismissive, but he can’t know. “Where’s the chicken?”
With that in mind, Draco rotates the piece of bread he’s roasting over the stove and comes up with a plan for the day. He
Draco’s eyes widen as he nods, summons two glasses, and immediately fills them up. He passes one to Harry, who grins at him in thanks, and carries his breakfast over to the dining table.
“Security, you know?” He murmurs, trying to soften his previous statement. He doesn’t know why he snapped, Harry hasn’t ever pushed for details he knows he can’t have.
Harry snarls at himself. He can’t think like that for multiple reasons. The first being that Draco does
“Very funny Draco,” he rolls his eyes. “It’s the first time I’ve seen Fred and George since their birthday two weeks ago, so I thought I would bring them something.”
“Nothing.” I shake my head. Thinking out loud now too? What is happening to me? Aside from the obvious bone-wing thing.
Harry steps back to the bed and pulls the sheets back. He rearranges a compliant Malfoy to lay under them, and then draws the covers up over his body. Malfoy looks almost normal like this—clean, fed, and at peace—except for the numerous cuts over his neck and face. Harry watches as Malfoy shuffles around and pulls the duvet up over his shoulder, before turning and leaving the room. He thinks he hears a muffled ‘goodnight’ behind him, but he isn’t sure.
Harry would roll his eyes at Malfoy’s sarcasm but he’s just too ecstatic about finding the man alive! He’s alive! “Ho-”
Draco scowls. It must have fallen out of his pocket while he was asleep. Not that he tells Potter that. No, he’ll just let the other man puzzle it out himself.
“Yep,” Harry says. “Not just that either; it was designed to only break for you. It had to sense everyone who came near the trap, and when it sensed you it caved in. I could have walked right over it and been fine.”
Harry’s face warms, and as he looks up he notices how close he is sitting to Malfoy. Strangely enough, he’s not overcome by the urge to move away. Instead, he wants to rest back into Malfoy’s touch, to fall asleep next to him again. He sighs, shakes his head, and forces himself to pull away. He’d had enough trouble convincing Malfoy that them falling asleep together was just because of the cold, if he practically drapes himself over the other man, he might be a bit less persuadable.
“Potter!” He exclaims, rising to his feet and basically jumping with excitement. This is a breakthrough, surely. Then again… the colours
Cheers erupt from the circle of girls, and Harry turns to find Pansy and Lavender snogging. He watches as Pansy gets her hands in Lavender’s hair and
“They will if you keep saying my name…” I murmur under my breath. He is correct, again. He’s doing that a lot lately. Mind you, that still doesn’t mean that I want to be here. I would much rather jump off a cliff than be spotted in public.
Malfoy blinks and comes back to himself, drawing himself up higher and standing straighter. “I’m going to cook dinner, do you want any?”
Draco turns back around and pulls out another canvas. He’s already planned out the painting for Theo, already sketched the pink flowers of the Theo azalea, but now he needs to paint it. Draco prepares his paints and brushes, wards the canvas in the necessary spells, and begins creating yet another work of art he’s going to give away.
Draco walks slowly towards Harry, his shoes tapping on the pavement. His hand lands on Harry’s shoulder, and he tries not to tense at the unexpected touch. It slides from his shoulder down his back, resting just above his waist.
I sigh again. “I really don’t know. I don’t think he would go to any of the other properties, for much the same reasons.”
“Draco, he doesn’t mean it like that.” Her voice is calm, reassuring. Exactly what I need but not what I want to hear. I would rather sink into the feeling of loneliness, at least that’s comforting.
Draco swallows hard, now absolutely positive that his wand is missing. “My wand,” he grits out. The last thing he wants is for Potter to take advantage of the situation and slit his throat. Granted, he doesn’t seem too thirsty for Draco’s blood these days, so it might not be too bad.
She takes that as an answer for right now, and begins pulling things out of her bag. A Muggle quill is thrown out, followed by weird parchment book
Harry makes his way into the bathroom, stripping his shirt off on the way. Something bumps into him, warm and solid. It flinches in surprise, and Harry realises it’s Malfoy himself. Malfoy, who just knocked into his bare chest in a dark hallway, and is now looking exceptionally… strange.
“What’s the time?” Potter’s voice is muffled, and when Draco looks over he discovers that he’s shoved his face into a pillow. Draco holds back a snort of laughter and answers the question, watching in great amusement as Potter stiffens and then flies upwards. “You’re not serious.”
I cut him off by leaping out of the bed, clutching at the long robes. He gapes as I rush to remove my hospital clothes and throw the black fabric over me. I pull the oversized hood on, letting it fall onto my head. Potter smiles for a second before realising what exactly we’re doing.
He sucks on it hard, his tongue licking over the skin and his teeth grazing it. Harry arches into it, moving his head to the side to give Draco better access. Stars burst behind his eyes as Draco finds a sensitive spot and digs into it. He’s relentless, licking and sucking until Harry thinks he might die. He’d probably like it too, dying from Draco’s mouth on him. Poetic justice.
He leaps up and starts pacing, his feet dragging behind him noisily and his hand gripping the wand in his pocket. He sends the cushions and his blanket back into order with a quick spell, straightening them out and making it look presentable. Harry may not be bothered to make his bed—or couch, in this case—but he isn’t so lazy as to not get his magic to do it for him. Unlike Ron. His heart clenches at the thought of his friend. It’s Thursday. He’d normally have seen him four times by now, each meeting at either the pub, or Hermione and Ron’s cozy little house. Harry sighs, running his hands through his hair. It sucks, being so far away from the people you care about and having no way of contacting them. Harry can only hope that they find a way out of this soon. If not Malfoy and him, then maybe Hermione might be able to help from the other side of this mess.
