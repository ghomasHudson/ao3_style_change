“What an embarrassment.” He looked at Pansy, who was also looking at the twins, although for different reasons. Her eyes held disapproval in them. He hummed in response, hoping she’d take it as agreement. Draco had long ago found ways to avoid speaking ill of his twins. It just didn’t feel right.
Harry was surprised to see Draco Malfoy staring right at him as he turned back towards them and was even more so at the blondes muttered thank you.
They wouldn’t understand, he knew. He’d caused too much harm to ever be forgiven. But he hoped they’d help him get out of Azkaban, if not for him, then for George. He still needed him, after all. And when he ceased to do so, well then, he’d be free to
“Isn’t it obvious?” He said, setting one arm on the blonde’s black and raising their clasped arms, as if they were to dance. “I am being an adequately  proper, preppy gentleman and am going to dance with you.” He said with an exaggerated upturn of his nose which mad him chuckle. And then... Then they were
The next few days, he saw even less of everyone as he barely left his room in order to read through his new books. He now understood a bit of what a panic attack was and why George had used a cold cloth on Draco’s face, the temperature contrast had shocked him out of his attack apparently. He read about other mind illnesses and was fascinated by it all. He made a decision to ask Andromeda for more books when he next saw her, but in the meantime, he memorised the different techniques that could help the blonde. Despite it making sense, he was annoyed when he read that whilst one technique may help one person, it didn’t ensure its infallibility, that everyone was to find their own method. He’d still try to guide the Slytherin through an attack were he to ever have another in Harry’s presence, he’d just have to try different ways until he found the right one.
"Over there, next to Fred." Harry heard astonished gasps coming from the crowd that had been watching the scene. He didn't dare meet the other Weasley's eyes. "Please, Harry. I'll... I'll explain, just help me move him. Please."
"He never wanted to be a Death Eater, he had no choice. He could have left afterward but he stayed instead to help us out." George continued. "I can't believe we let you do that Draco.
“My mother’s maiden name was Black. In terms of hierarchy, it’s above my father’s line as it is a Noble and most ancient house. If a grave offense had been committed, one that put the lineage of the Blacks in danger, for example, the House of Black would have the right to claim me as “theirs”. That would mean that I’d become a Black first and foremost, in name and in status. Magic would recognize me as a Black and would make everyone see me as such, too. Even if I could represent or speak for my father's line or inherit from him if no other child is born, I’d still be a Black. But that ship sailed with Sirius Black. There are my mother and Andromeda but the Blacks were extremely misogynistic so their magic won’t recognize them as Head of House. I guess Edward could put a claim for restitution when he is of age but it will be a while until that time comes.”
“Let me get this straight,” He said between laughs “You had a murderous, evil, wizard hunting you down, and you considered
"Don't be stupid, little one. You've still got me." Something about that didn't sit right with Harry, but he chose to ignore it.
“Fifth year… fifth year was a strange year. For one, Harry was losing support due to his “craziness” and to maintain that, the Dark…” He stopped himself before continuing. “
And no more words were said that night, because no more words were needed. They kissed and they laughed and they loved because they could and at least for that night alone no one could take that from them and both rejoiced in that moment not knowing that that peace would soon be ripped away from them forever.
“He was my godfather.” Sirius' face came to his mind and the hand around his heart squeezed a little tighter.
When second year came around, Draco was more subdued than ever. Lucius’s lessons had been almost daily and so there had been no reprieve from the pain, the torture. He hadn’t been able to heal yet, and his entire body ached and hurt when his clothes rubbed against any of the many burn’s cuts and bruises. At least his father had allowed him to heal the broken bones, the rest he was supposed to keep to “remember his place”. Draco behaved as expected when in public, he mocked the trio and made the degrading comment here and there, but any other time he was quiet, broken. Half the year went by and he barely took notice of anything, he was aware of the petrified students, but he couldn’t bring himself to care. He sort of hoped he’d be next. That Christmas break, he was instructed by his father to stay at school which was, to him, a gift from the heavens. He probably should be feeling guilty about his thoughts, he should love his family, right? At least he had one unlike Potter… and yet the only thing he felt was relief that he’d be able to stay away a little longer.
“You can’t.” Draco responded and his voice was but a whisper. He sounded defeated, utterly broken. Resigned. They both hated it.
“It’s not that easy. Being of a Noble and Ancient House and being the only heir, I can never renounce my name. It's sort of a failsafe to keep greedy government hands from our estate and money. Now that I’m of age, my father can’t even disown me, he would’ve had to do it before my 17th birthday or would be able to do it now if my mother births another child, which is highly unlikely. The only way to get rid of it would be if I was claimed as restitution by a Noble and Most Ancient house. But that is very unlikely as well.”
The twins hadn’t managed to estricate the story from him until days later and the fury that had ignited within them had been a sight to behold.
He had no strength left to fight those dark thoughts. Not anymore. While he was still at the Manor he had ignored that little voice that told him to end it all, to give up, to succumb into the soft arms of nothingness. No pain, no suffering, no
If Draco thought life at the manor had been bad before, he’d been sorely mistaken. The moment he’d seen Potter show up on the grounds with an unmoving Cedric, he’d known things would forever be changed. He just wasn’t aware of how much.
“Are you really? I find it that I am not surprised at all.” A dreamy voice said behind them. Luna’s blond curls were dirty and hung lifelessly around her face, but there was still that
did you say? Wonderful! Wonderful news indeed!” He said as he stood up quickly. “It was a great talk little one, but I have to leave, things to do, things to say, you know? I’ll see you around and yadda, yadda.” And with that, the ginger left, the grin still on his face and Draco stared after him feeling more confused that ever.
“When you are off age. Don’t stay under your fathers thumb, I know you think you have to, but you don’t.”
Malfoy's voice sounded angry, but it lacked the burn that Harry never realised it had had while they had fought in the past. "I didn't want to! I wanted to give up...
"Draco, Fred and I..." His voice broke at the mention of his brother's name. "We've been friends ever since your second year and..." He spared a look for the blonde as if considering whether he should speak the next words or not. He must have decided in favor because his next statement rocked Harry's world "Draco and Fred have been dating since the triwizard tournament."
"I... I don't mean to be rude or anything but... what is Malfoy doing here?" Hermione, ever the one to not stand an unsolved puzzle, finally asked what they had all been thinking. Malfoy clung tighter to George and buried his face in the other boy's chest, giving a simple nod to what Harry guessed had been a whispered question.
. She’s…. She’s all I have.” It seemed Harry wasn’t the only one distraught by seeing the boy like this. And that was what he was at that moment, wasn’t it? A boy, a child. They all were. They all should have been. But the war had made them grow up and left nothing but shattered pieces. Mrs. Weasley threw herself at the boy's feet and took his hands in hers.
The twins had been delighted by Draco’s new found passion in the kitchen and tried enthusiastically all dishes and sweets brought to them by their little one. They even discussed introducing a range of pastries that could be sold at the shop. Truffles that changed someone’s hair colour and cupcakes that made one sprout wings were one of the few ideas they began working on with Draco as the mastermind behind it all.
“In my defense, my exceptionally exceptional highness, the snoring part was a jest, I was actually talking about how loud you are in b… hmph!” A hand covered his mouth before he could finish at which everyone failed to keep it in anymore and started laughing out loud at the ridiculousness of it all. Despite sporting a very impressive red face, the blond didn’t seem to mind much as he saw everyone around him happy and even swiping tears from their eyes. It had been quite a while since any of them cried for reasons other than fright and pain and Harry welcomed that moment of peace with open arms.
“It’s just… He was there, unable to breathe and I couldn’t do anything I was just so… useless.” Harry murmured. Andromeda looked at him seriously, and in a calculating way, as if seizing him up then she said, “Wait for me a second” and left through the floo.
It had been in the summer before fourth year that Draco noticed for the first time. Two years had passed since his life was turned upside down by a pair of cheeky twins. Two years since life had taken pity on him and sent salvation in the form of Fred and George Weasley. The summers since had been worse than ever. Lucius has been furious at the going ons at Hogwarts in his second and third year. He’d had wanted the mudblood’s dead, and Sirius black silenced and buried three feet below the surface. Instead there was a basilisk carcass he couldn’t even get his hands on for profit, a once again victorious Harry Potter and an escaped Sirius Black that was nothing but a liability for his plans.
He ate his dinner without putting the book away, and by the time his plate was empty, he’d reached the last page. Harry closed the battered cover with a sigh and picked up the parchment he’d been scribbling on, listing all the spells he found. He’d give it to Severus the next day if he managed to sneak away from Gryffindor to his rooms unnoticed. His impatient side was eager to slip away now, but he had his meeting with Dumbledore tonight — and Draco, hopefully.
“Well, things were rather complicated, weren’t they? First, Sirius was on the run for a year and we could barely communicate with each other. Last year, we were slowly figuring things out, so we kept it all very private. I’m sorry for not telling you, Harry, but we weren’t sure how you’d take it—having grown up with Muggles you might have different views on homosexuality. Not to mention that the thought of your godfather and your former professor dating each other might have been…odd. And since everything was still on rather thin ice, we didn’t want to put that on you, in case it wouldn’t work out in the end after all.” Remus sighed heavily. “We had a lot to work through, but we were getting closer again, but now—”
“No, please, you don’t have to do that. Just look for the things you wanted to buy for yourselves. I really don’t need a lot,” he assured, but Draco’s mother dismissed it with a wave of her hand.
Reaching the headmaster’s quarters, he gave the password to the stone gargoyle and entered, finding Albus waiting for him expectantly.
“I’m glad you see your mistake, but I’m not the one you hurt with this, Severus,” Remus replied icily. It wasn’t entirely true, he
Sirona was in the middle of telling him about a hole in the wall somewhere in the common room, when the door opened and Ron came barging in.
“It was to be expected, we left nothing of importance behind and the house-elves can take care of themselves. They’ll avoid him, if they haven’t already left for one of the other Malfoy estates. But please, go on.”
Minerva nodded weakly, clearly still processing what Severus had just dropped on her without preamble.
He snorted. “No, Hermione, I didn’t go to the Slytherin dorms. In case you’ve forgotten, I have a room in Raven’s quarters.”
The Room of Requirement that Draco’s request had created wasn’t large, but it had enough space to pace back and forth between the desk it had provided for Draco to work on and the large four-poster bed — which Draco found awfully presumptuous of the room to have put there. He had asked for a place to meet Harry in, and the Room had provided a bed. A desk, yes, but a bed. Not a couch, not a bunch of armchairs, no, a bed. Not that he fundamentally disagreed with the implication of it, but still. Presumptuous.
Gratitude and stubborn petulance warred in Draco. “That’s not— I mean, thank you, really; I’d love to come for dinner with you two. But you understand that having dinner with my boyfriend and his father once in a while is not what I’m talking about. I want to spend time with Harry alone, talking, practising spells, reading, cuddling—none of which I’ll be able to do anymore once we leave Grimmauld Place.”
Severus just stared at him until Remus put the bar away with a shrug. What was it with that man’s obsession with chocolate? Why couldn’t he just focus on what Severus wanted to know and tell him already? When Remus returned his gaze to Severus, the smile had shrunk significantly and he had taken on a rather cautious look.
Harry felt himself blush and didn’t really know how to respond, until he finally settled on, “I’m glad.”
Harry scoffed, green eyes veiled with bitterness. “Wonderful, I always wanted to be remarkable at antagonising my boyfriend.”
me to be his father, I won’t turn my back on him again. I’m not saying I’ll be perfect, I’m expecting to make many, many mistakes, but none of them will involve abandoning him on purpose.”
Right, there was that. Somehow Harry had assumed Narcissa would’ve told Malfoy about that, but he had evidently been wrong.
On another note: I am officially done with NaNo! 50K words in a month, phew. Unfortunately for you that means my updates will slow down a bit again, since I'm not writing
Ron shot him a glare. “I still can’t believe you let McGonagall bully me into continuing Potions just because Slughorn’s standards are lower than Snape’s.”
“Looks like a whole lot of nothing,” Draco drawled as he got off the couch and sidled over to Harry, wrapping his arms around Harry’s chest from behind his chair. Harry sighed as he reflexively leaned into the touch. His insides still felt wrong, unstable, and his chest hurt.
Thus thoroughly distracted by his thoughts, he reached out to the bathroom door, only to flinch back at the last second. A flush crept up his neck as he remembered Remus lying in the bathtub, barely covered by white foam. Better to knock first. When there was no response, Severus opened the door and peered inside. Empty. Good.
James about her and Severus, and he’d forgiven her, perhaps even accepted it from the start. And he had named Harry his heir, despite him being Severus’ son.
“Our first memory is from a Mr Bob Ogden. At the time it occurred, Mr Ogden was working for the Ministry, more specifically the Department of Magical Law Enforcement or DMLE.”
Steps were coming closer, up the stairs. Draco’s heart sped up and he clenched his hands into fists.
“So, Draco; Potter,” said Pansy, and Draco’s heart plummeted. She couldn’t possibly have noticed anything, could she?! They hadn’t even interacted with each other apart from their staged fight at the gate!
For a time, he just lay there, soaking in the warmth of the water, surrounded by scented bubbles, not thinking much of anything. After a while, however, his thoughts caught up with him.
Harry laughed and some of the tension in the room abated. The twins promptly marched into the room—forcing Harry to quickly lift his shield charm while he was walking over to stand next to where Draco sat—followed by a much more cautious looking Weaslette, and took the three-seat couch to Draco’s right. Fleur Delacour seemed mildly confused, but entered without hesitation when one of the two Weasley brothers Draco didn’t know moved to join his siblings, her arm firmly linked with his as they settled next to Remus. So that’s how she’d ended up here, she was dating one of the older ones.
Harry looked up at him and smiled, causing Draco’s heart to stutter pathetically. Gods, he was so done for, how had this happened? His breath caught slightly when Harry signaled him to come over to him, but he complied immediately. Fortunately, the twins had turned most of their attention to his mother by now anyway. The thought was grating on Draco’s mind a little—his mother, talking to Fred and George Weasley about products for their joke shop.
Draco’s nerves fluttered. He had no idea how to play this. Approaching Potter directly was more than likely to end badly, and Draco wasn’t particularly good at expressing how he felt in the first place, especially when what he felt was so
, also known as a prism viper,” Severus explained. “Prism vipers have several magical abilities, one of them being rudimentary healing. Their skin is used in a variety of healing potions, some of which require fresh scales. Furthermore, its venom can be used in certain potions as well, although far fewer than the skin. This one is still practically a baby, so it—”
“Yeah, actually. He wanted me to get into trouble before the feast so he could give me Sirona, so Draco and I staged a fight. It worked out pretty flawlessly.” Harry grimaced. “Not that I particularly like fighting with Draco, but at least it worked.”
It had all turned out differently, of course. Lily and James were murdered, he’d lost them and Sirius
“I can fix that,” said Harry, already lifting his hand to fling a locking and silencing charm at the door.
Draco sure knows how to make an entrance, doesn’t he? Luckily Harry knows all the best hiding spots in Grimmauld Place now, and boy there are quite a few. Now let’s just hope he comes to face the world again sometime soon, but knowing how stubborn Harry can be, I wouldn’t count on it.
Not a particularly great first experience kissing a guy, though he shouldn’t have expected anything better, given the previous disaster with Cho.
“I’m afraid I don’t know where he is,” said Remus sadly, concern clear in his face. “He suddenly left the party yesterday and went to his room, I haven’t seen him since.”
In reality, he wasn’t sure how the Dark Lord would react if he didn’t show up until after the potion was done. An hour was a lot, especially during times in which the Dark Lord knew that Severus had no permanent responsibilities at Hogwarts. He could get away with a lot during term, but far less over summer, when the Dark Lord expected him to be at his disposal at all times, like any other Death Eater.
Ron nodded thoughtfully. “It would make sense, if they’re both heirlooms of You-Know-Who’s family. The question is what Dumbledore wants with them.”
“How would I know? I thought he looks like Black when I first saw him, but Lupin insists that that’s impossible. I don’t know who else Lily was close to around that time, we weren’t friends anymore.”
“Uhm, Professor Slughorn?” Ron piped up as they took their seats at the table with the Amortentia cauldron on it. “I haven’t got a textbook. I didn’t know until this morning that I’d be able to continue with Potions.”
Walburga positively beamed. “Why, of course, child, how could I refuse? I will watch over you day and night, my sweet Cissy. No filth will dare speak to you!”
“Never keep secrets from me again,” the Dark Lord hissed, before pushing him back onto the ground hard enough for his head to hit the stone floor with a bang.
“Do you know what’s wrong? Can you show me how to help you?” She turned to look at him now, letting go of his hand to reach up and touch his face instead.
Resting their foreheads together, they just held each other’s gaze for a moment, then Harry whispered, “What would I do without you?”
He noticed Harry the moment he entered the Great Hall, flanked by Hermione and Weasley. Gods, he looked delectable, even with his sodding school robes covering up the outfit underneath—Draco could see a hint of green which was always gorgeous on Harry. His mood, however, appeared to be somewhat sour, judging from the scowl on his face.
“Yes, sir,” Harry repeated. “But, sir— If I am as bad at Legilimency as I am at Occlumency, this could take me all year to learn.”
you were like him. It wasn’t just James Potter’s looks that Lily gave you with those charms, it was his entire being. You sounded like him, you moved like him, you behaved like him—you were virtually an exact copy of James Potter, down to the tiniest movements and habits. When I looked at you, I saw James’ face, the way he had looked when he bullied me. When I looked at you, I was reminded over and over that Lily had chosen him over myself.”
“You’re saying that as if we knew this for sure. May I remind you that we don’t?” snapped Severus. “Even though you all seem to have agreed on it, we don’t actually
He trailed off, giving Draco a somewhat sheepish look. Meanwhile Draco’s heart was doing its best to beat right out of his chest.
“Right, although maybe we can try for some polite conversation, you know, to warm them up to the idea slowly.”
Severus gestured his permission and got out of his chair. It would be impolite to stay seated if he could not offer a seat to his guest. Lupin closed the door behind him as he stepped into the room. He looked tired and worried.
“It always impressed me,” Remus said, making Severus jump a little, “how good you are at that. It looks so complicated, but you never even hesitate.”
“No, Severus. It is only proper to ask the head of the house for permission first. While I am eternally grateful for your efforts to get me out of the Manor, I can not accept staying here if Harry does not want me in his home.” She turned back to Harry, a small smirk creeping on her lips. “That is one reason why I took the portrait down. The other reason is simple: Aunt Walburga was a nasty woman and it was time that she was dealt with for good.”
“Thank you, sir,” replied Harry politely. There was a pause, and when Dumbledore said nothing, Harry went on, “If I may ask now, Professor, what exactly are those lessons going to be about?”
“Probably not, no,” Harry conceded, “but they’ll adjust with time, I hope. It’s not like that’s the most dramatic piece of news they’ll have to adjust to.” His tone had turned bitter and Draco reached up to put a hand on his cheek.
and inextricably connected to one’s soul.” He gave them all a grave look. “It can, however, be concealed. The process is difficult, but it is quite possible.”
“I do want to,” he whispered. “But…I don’t know how. I don’t know what to say, where to start.” He pulled away a little to look at Draco. “I’ve never really talked to anyone about this before, ever. Not even Ron and Hermione.“
“Severus, you can not give a deadly snake to a boy! This isn’t a pet!” she cried. “I won’t allow it!”
Lupin smiled fondly at the memories, then shook his head again. “It makes sense. Looks like you’ve beaten the statistical odds, Severus,” he said. “It’s either you or James, and we know for a fact that it isn’t James.”
, I struggle with a spell. Sure, there’s a sort of instinctive aspect to it, but that’s just additional to me. Harry is the opposite, he does everything by instinct and the knowing is additional. I’ve seen Remus try to teach him new spells, and whenever there was too much focus on technique or theory, it took him much longer until he got it. He does best if he just…
He didn’t run into his mother. No, of course not. He ran into Potter—quite literally—just as he reached their floor.
“He has taken over the Manor, Narcissa, permanently. He even crooned about how he was almost grateful that you disappeared because it practically gifted him a new residence, albeit at the price of not having Draco in his service to gain him entrance into Hogwarts. I’m sorry.”
“Twice, actually,” Remus added, his voice even softer than before. “Right after he said it the first time, he cast Rennervate on you and started breathing properly—or visibly—again, opened your eyes and looked at him, and then he said it again. After that you kinda went under again and Harry half-collapsed into a chair because his exhaustion probably caught up with him.”
“And what, pray tell, are you sorry for?” Draco asked, his voice confirming that he was definitely at least a little angry.
Snape watched him silently, looking oddly thoughtful. It made Harry feel decidedly awkward. He was used to Snape being snarky and downright nasty to him, this new, scrutinising attitude made him feel uneasy.
Harry felt a lump form in his throat. For some reason, he wanted to tell Draco everything, but at the same time he wasn’t sure he could. He
Her tone conveyed that arguing would be pointless, so Harry followed her without complaint. Maybe an afternoon snack wasn’t a bad idea— Harry realised that he had no idea how late it actually was. It felt like hours had passed since Severus had crashed into the entrance hall, but in reality he knew it couldn’t have been more than one, if even. But how late had it been when he’d returned? He cast a quick
Narrowing his eyes suspiciously, Harry searched Remus’ face for a hint at what had caused their reaction, but found nothing. With a deep breath, he turned back to Snape.
Ron and Hermione stared at him in horror. Before they had the chance to collect themselves again, the door opened and Draco strode in, his eyes lighting up behind his blank Malfoy mask when he saw Harry.
It was the exact opposite with Narcissa and Draco. After their objective assessment of the dining room, Harry had insisted on helping Narcissa with the next room, to which she had eventually agreed, albeit rather reluctantly. She seemed to believe that the Lord of the house should not have to deal with such things, but Harry had stayed stubborn, until she’d eventually allowed him to help her clear out one of the unused bedrooms on the second floor.
Harry cocked his head in surprise, but seemed relieved. When they entered, a blue-robed goblin greeted them immediately.
Narcissa’s breathing grew deeper, her gasps sounding less like she was suffocating but rather like she had emerged from an excessively long dive underwater. Harry ripped his gaze from the disappearing threads, watching Narcissa’s face instead. The pain seemed to be abating, although she still looked unbelievably sad.
Unfortunately, Slughorn also wasn’t the best teacher according to Severus, and he insisted on drilling both Harry and Draco on the theoretical aspects that were covered during sixth year, as well as having them write down all the recipes they’d learn. In response to Draco’s question why they should have to write it all down themselves if there was a potions’ book on their booklist, Severus snorted and promptly went on a fifteen minute rant about how that book had already been outdated when he himself was a student, and that it was absurd that Slughorn still intended to use it when most of the recipes had long since been improved and adjusted.
“Always so observant. There was indeed something special about it, but I‘m afraid I cannot tell you what. Rest assured, though, that it is quite safe now—the magic that was imbued in it was destroyed.“ He turned his attention back to the ring, seeming completely unbothered by Severus‘ obvious annoyance.
Draco Malfoy was attractive, yes, but he was ultimately still a right git. Harry had crushes on people like Cedric, not people like Draco. But the thought had lingered under the surface, ready to flash back up whenever Harry received a glare from those silver-grey eyes, which happened quite often at this point, since Harry had taken to switching rooms every half-hour or so, feeling distinctly restless if he didn’t.
them instead, but Severus distracted him with another kiss and his wand was out of reach, so he resigned himself to work through the endless row of buttons, just to uncover another row of buttons on the waistcoat, then another one on the shirt underneath.
“What are you thinking about, love?” asked Draco softly, wrapping his arms around Harry’s waist from behind and pulling him flush against his chest.
“Potter!” Snape called impatiently from the library, and Harry snapped out of it, hurriedly making his way down the hallway. He found Snape sitting on a dark, musty looking couch, eyeing him irritably. Remembering the disaster his previous Occlumency lessons had been, Harry swallowed hard and readied himself for a whole lot of unpleasantness. He sat down quickly opposite Snape, forcing his hands to stay still folded in his lap. He looked at Snape with what he hoped was a neutral expression and waited for the other man to speak.
“Shit,” muttered Remus. He reached out to grab his wand and spelled Severus’ shirt, waistcoat and robes on and closed again. “Go.”
“Because that was her argument! ‘Mr Potter is continuing Potions as well. If he can keep up, you can as well.’”
“This isn’t going to be easy,” said Severus softly, “but it’s going to be alright. Just always remember that I am incredibly proud to call you my son, no matter what act I have to put on for the rest of the world.”
and free, so firmly had his mind convinced him that he was gone forever, as if he was dead. Their relationship hadn’t been the same, not by far, but they had found each other again in other ways. He had never stopped loving Sirius, and he probably never would. He had simply learnt to move on despite that love. Grieving him again now felt oddly familiar, like he simply slipped back into that resigned acceptance that his first love was gone, and that he would just continue to love him, carrying all the good of their history around with him as a gentle reminder that love existed in the first place.
Severus smiled and, resolutely pushing away any thoughts of the meddling headmaster, he began to tell her about his son.
“Good,” replied Lupin. “What matters now is that Harry needs us. He’s barely sixteen and the whole wizarding world suddenly expects him to kill You-Know-Who. He’ll need all the support he can get, and you and I are equally responsible for him now.”
Harry sighed, but decided not to push the argument. He just hoped that by the time such a situation actually arose, Draco would be sensible enough to keep himself safe first. Slytherins were supposed to have strong self-preservation instincts, right?
don’t ever call yourself that again. The only ones that are disgusting are those fucking arseholes who did this to you,” he hissed. “If I ever,
“I came as fast as I could. The Dark Lord is displeased with the night’s events and demanded his followers’ presence until mere minutes ago. What exactly is so urgent?” He kept his voice steady, unwilling to show just how exhausted he was.
Eventually, Luna spoke up, “I guess that explains why you barely have any Wrackspurts this year, your head used to be full of them.”
Severus’ expression morphed from suspicious to horror-stricken as his mind caught up with what Remus meant.
A mild wave of anxiety rolled over him and he slowed down on the last few steps of the stairs. Potter turned back to him with a hint of confusion in his eyes, coming to a halt right at the top of the staircase, Draco two steps behind him. Draco wasn’t sure what to do or say. Would they simply separate here, each go back to their own rooms, and forget about this? He didn’t want to go to his room alone, and he definitely didn’t want to forget about this. His grip on Potter’s hand tightened, and he felt Potter give a squeeze in return, before tugging gently, coaxing Draco to leave the stairs behind, leading them both towards his own room. Draco’s heartbeat quickened a little. He’d never actually seen Potter’s room, the door was always closed, and warded whenever Potter wasn’t there himself.
“I must say, Harry, I am very impressed.” Something in Dumbledore’s voice made Harry tense and he snapped his eyes up to the headmaster. “You said that you ‘made your magic pointy’ — could you explain how?”
thing, Draco. I am happy for you, truly, although I do wish you would’ve told me. You know I would never judge you, you’re my son and I will always stand with you, no matter what.”
By the time he’d finished his letter to his mother so it was ready to be sent in the morning and put it on the bedside table, his dorm mates had settled down in their beds as well. He heard soft snores coming from Vince’s bed. With a sigh, he drew the curtains around his bed, threw up muting charms to keep Vince’s snoring out and got comfortable under the Slytherin green sheets. Staring into the darkness, he lay awake for a long time.
of them, every single one—gasped. Draco had to suppress the urge to laugh and quickly picked up his cup of tea to hide his smile. Sure, he’d been surprised by it, too, but this was like watching a drama on a stage. Gryffindors and their blatant displays of emotions. Now that everyone’s attention was away from Draco he felt decidedly lighter. Severus, however, looked more uncomfortable than ever—at least to Draco, who knew him well enough to be able to tell. For everyone else he hid it well behind a mask of arrogance.
Eight heads turned towards Severus Snape as he entered the hospital wing of Hogwarts in the early morning hours. Eight serious faces, most of them showing clear signs of grief. He wished he could just turn around and leave again. It had been a more than tiring night.
because Malfoys were part of the absolute elite, he’d promptly been rejected for a goddamn Weasel and a mud— for Granger.
to brew it. I can hardly set up in the kitchen, Narcissa would have my head. I could do it in here, but there’s barely enough space, and I don’t fancy sleeping in some of these fumes produced during the process.”
Severus was once again caught by surprise. He hadn’t known Harry was thinking about reviving his club that he’d started to defy Umbridge. Albus was considering Harry carefully, and again Severus could almost see the wheels turning in the headmaster’s mind.
In the end, I was stuck on this for almost two weeks because the sexy times were refusing me. I’m happy to never look at it again, tbh.
“My turn?” he asked with a grin. He moved to switch their positions, but Harry held him back and shook his head. Draco frowned.
After spreading the books on his desk, he paused. He hadn’t written to Ron and Hermione in a while. In fact, he hadn’t written to them since that first explanatory letter, which was almost three weeks ago now.
Albus sighed and shook his head. “Now, I’m unsure what caused this, but much more unsettling than his change in appearance is his change in magical signature. You’ll see that it is quite drastically different to what it used to be. As we all know a magical signature doesn’t simply change. It is a wizard’s essence, more unique than a fingerprint—it is
“You already said that, but why not? I thought you didn’t want to keep your relationship secret,” asked Hermione.
“Wait. You think I regret it? Harry, The only part of that I regret is not being able to tell you. To look at you everyday and see the person I fell in love with not remember. That you had to be taken and have what happened to, to be able to realize how much you meant to me. I hate that that had to happen for me to open my eyes and get over myself in order to help you. I hate that-”
I love the reviews so much! I hope you like the new chapter. Let me know what you think of Narcissa!!
Luna And Hermione had gotten married almost a year after them. Luna was currently pregnant with their first son. They had used a sperm donor and planned to have Hermione have the next one with the same donor.
Thank you for going on this journey with me as I write my first fanfiction. I already have ideas for my next one so stay tuned. I love all of you so much!!
“Unfortunately, You-Know-Who’s spy within the school reported you had been attacked while Dragon was out yesterday. They had told him all the details they know, which was not a lot. I got free and came immediately. You and Dragon are dating and your Mother is no longer here. I just wished to see you were ok. I know if the roles were reversed, I would only hope Lily would have checked on Dragon. I apologise if I overstepped.”
“Why would you-. You know what? Off topic. Back to your questions. Almost sixteen years ago Sev and I had a son. We had just gotten married when we found out he was pregnant. He was so beautiful. Raven black hair, dark brown eyes, and a birthmark in the shape of a ram on his right knee. That is why we named him Aries.” Harry’s eyes widened at the last one. “At just two months old he was taken from us. I awoke one night and went to check on him. He had usually awoke by that point to get fed and he hadn’t. I entered the room and saw him. I immediately knew something was wrong. He wasn’t moving, breathing. He was blue. And cold. I knew I was too late. Muggles had a term for it. SIDS. Sudden Infant Death Syndrome. A blanket term for babies who die with no cause. We never had another child. We couldn’t go through that again.” His tears had come back. Harry just sat there silently.
After Harry fell asleep, Draco and Hermione continued to plan. Turns out they had very similar tastes and agreed on most things. The things they didn’t, they easily came to a compromise. A little after midnight Hermione sat down her quill and looked at Draco expectantly.
Harry and Draco entered Snape’s living quarters and sat side by side on the couch next to the warm fire. Even though it was August the dungeons were always cold. Snape sat in a chair directly across from them.
“Your father thought it was a great idea. I do not believe he will be able to, but it would be nice to have reassurance. If you are ready we can go now.”
leave his son blind or heal him to where he didn’t need glasses. The choice was obvious. Other than the other minor cuts and bruises, Snape was done. He spelled several blood-replenishing, pain, and general healing potions into his stomach. Now all they could do was wait.
“Don’t you Dragon me until you have explained. Does Severus know who you are? What would he do if I told him. Not to mention Tom.”
“Okay, I am choosing to believe you, but you had better believe I will be speaking to Sev about this.”
“Well there was no internal bleeding, which leads to the next question. Harry, the reason you were kept alive is because you possess a very rare magical ability the Dark Lord took advantage of. He planned to keep you longer then kill you.”

They pulled off his shirt and started working on his trousers. Tom had them pulled to the child’s knees when he froze. Snape saw the hesitation and questioned it.
He had asked Harry why he didn’t go to Dumbledore. Harry had. Dumbledore turned him away telling him he was being dramatic and that he should be grateful. That was when he knew he had to go to Snape if he wanted help.
“Today we are starting with Veritaserum. I hope you trust your partner, because you will be testing them on each other.”
He crumpled the parchment in his hand and leaned back against the wall. Tears he had been holding back finally escaped.
Halfway there Dani asked Harry about the wizarding world. Harry answered what he could and Draco answered what he couldn’t. When they reached the doors, Harry paused then knocked. He said the password and they entered. Snape swooped in and looked down at the girl.
Confused, Harry looked at the now quiet baby. She looked up at him. Her steel gray eyes piercing his heart. Her skin color was so pale it was almost snow. Her hair was long and curly like Harry’s, but silvery blonde like her father. Harry drew in a shaky breath. Darkness that had slowly been creeping up took over and Harry passed out.
Later that night Snape, Aries, and Draco all sat down and Snape confirmed everything. They even fire called Tom for his opinion.
“Get lost, Ferret. Take the freak with you.” Ron said. He was standing in front of the group, arms crossed.
She shrugged and got up. She walked to the door in their common room that connects to Snape's room. He answered shortly after she had knocked.
He looked at Hedwig with fear in his eyes. He got an idea. It was so stupid and it had a terriblely low chance of working. He grabbed the pen and notebook he kept in his room for when Ron and Hermione sent letters. He quickly wrote a short letter and gave it to Hedwig.

Aries smiled. “Alright, good to know. My favorite colour is silver. I love sweets as well. Chocolate Frogs are probably my favorite. I have a minor obsession with gardening. I am gay. That is just about it for me.”
“I would like to go home at some point.” Snape said impatiently. Just then a loud thud followed several more that drew his attention.
Harry and Dani stayed in the common room right until Harry had to leave to get to his room before curfew. As he closed the portrait he heard whispering. Assuming it is a couple trying to get privacy he continued on. He only made it a few steps before he heard, “
“I think he has made his opinion very clear, Albus. I am his father. Not you. You will be sending him nowhere without my permission. We will be staying at the castle until school starts again. We live in a muggle part of London. You pointed this out. You won’t be going back on your word of allowing us to stay here. If you do, I will take Harry out of the country to ensure his safety. There are plenty of wizarding schools across the world. I’m sure one would allow us to transfer The-Boy-Who-Lived to theirs. End of discussion.” Snape’s voice clearly showed he would not argue or hesitate to go through on his threat.
They played for the next couple of hours. Draco had taken pity on Harry after winning five games and let him win once. If asked he would of course deny it.
She was cut off by a loud scream. She froze knowing exactly what it was. By the time she turned around, Draco was already next to Harry across the room. She couldn’t hear what Draco was whispering, but Harry had latched on to Draco’s shirt.
“Draco, I take back every bad thing I have said to you. No one has ever pulled him out that quickly before. Usually he throws a few punches as well.” Hermione said.
Harry started. “Well I have two things to tell you and you aren’t going to be happy with either. All I am going to ask is that you let me finish each part before you ask questions.” Hermione raised her eyebrows and they both nodded. “So, Snape is here because three years ago he adopted me. I know what you think of him, but you are wrong. He has been a spy for the light the entire time. I am only able to tell you this now because he broke his cover to save me from Tom. Okay, first part done. Any questions so far?” Draco chuckled at the shock on their faces.
Draco’s lips crushed on his, unrestrained, he cupped his face with both hands as Aries’ fingers slid along the sculpted forearms to meet his for a brief moment until he nudged
He nodded and said, “Okay, but if anything even questionable happens, we port key right back. Promise?”
“Miss Granger, it is illegal for a teacher to force you to take it. However, I am not going to force you. This is strictly a voluntary activity. You will fail if you do not though. It is up to you. Now gather your ingredients and get started.” Hermione gaped at the man.
“Ten points to Slytherin. Now, all of you are to start. If you have any problems, please get my attention.”
“It sounds like some kind of spell. You must have undone it without even realizing it. You started screaming last night in your sleep, so I don’t know. Maybe we should go talk to your father about this. Merlin, I never thought I’d hear your voice again.” Draco said, still smiling.
His eyes flutter open and he looked for the source of the soothing voice. Severus Snape sat next to him on the bed.
Harry got up and headed to the bathroom. They had done cleaning charms on him since he got back because he was too weak to do anything else. Now he was able to shower and he was excited.
Aries and Draco spent most of their days of summer together. They talked for hours at end. They went to Diagon Alley to get their supplies together and Aries had Draco ‘show’ him around.
YEAR 10: SEVERE BURNS(ARMS,HANDS, BACK), CONCUSSION, DISLOCATED SHOULDER(LEFT), SEVERE SKIN LACERATIONS( CHEST AND BACK), MALNUTRITION, DEHYDRATION, NEGLECT, ABANDONMENT
The first thing Harry noticed as he regained consciousness was the pain. His head, wrists, shoulder, stomach, and jaw. There may have been more, but those hurt enough that he couldn’t notice others.
Just as they were about to leave Draco stopped Harry in the entrance hall and said, “Harry, you don’t have to go. Death Eaters are still looking for you. I know we have your father, Remus, Tonks, and a few others coming. It still just makes me very nervous. We could just go and get the stuff you need. Bring it and the Weasel and Granger back here. You are five months pregnant, Harry. Think of Lily.”
Soon it was time for both Harry and Draco to go to Diagon Alley to get their supplies for the coming school year. They put it off until they couldn’t wait any longer. Harry had owled Ron and Hermione to have them meet so they could talk and they had agreed to wait until then to see Harry. To say Harry was nervous would be a massive understatement.
He cracked his eyes open and took in the sight before him. He was surrounded by black stone walls on four sides, ceiling, and floor. His arms were chained over his head to the wall. His shoulder was obviously dislocated out of the socket. He was further exploring when he noticed his stomach, it was slightly bigger than he remembered. He was already very skinny due to his family’s abuse and starvation. You could see every broken and bruised rib.
They both laughed. Harry looked up at Draco and said the words Draco had been dying to hear again. “Who needs a knight in shining armour when I have a silver dragon to protect me. I love our tadpole and I love you, my silver dragon.”
“Other than those fighting on the other side, Colin Creevey, Lavender Brown, Nymphadora Tonks, Fred Weasley, Dumbledore, a few whose names I don’t know,” Draco took a deep
“Harry Potter? The Harry Potter? Wait. You’re pregnant? Wow! Come on girls. Give them a few minutes. She’s safe with Mr. Potter.”
“Dani, you know I wasn’t being treated right by your parents. I had to leave. I had hoped you would be ok. I never knew you were a witch. You never showed signs. What happened?” He set the girl in his lap as much as his size could allow.
To say Harry was terrified would be an understatement. He had studied every male pregnancy book the library had. When he goes into labour it would progress like a normal pregnancy. Contractions, his water breaking, and so on. What doesn’t happen, however, is pushing. The baby has nowhere to go. He would have to get a c-section. If it didn’t happen in time, Lily would die.
“I have my own room because of Lily, but I can hangout for a little while. Only if Draco can come though.” He replied.
Congrats to SgCuRiAdPePrER for figuring out the spy!! Only a few chapters left. Love the review you guys leave. You are the best!
Everyone looked at Harry. He sat frozen. With tears in his eyes, he reached forward and grabbed one of Draco’s hands.
“Yes sir. Completely. May I be excused? Malfoy wanted to study.” Aries spit out the name even though it hurt him to do so.
The next day not much happened for a while. Draco refused to go to classes and Snape visited Harry during his free periods. Currently the headmaster was there to discuss Ron’s punishment.
“Draco? Dray? Oh Merlin. I broke him.” Harry got his wand and pointed it at Draco’s face. He cast a spell and water shoots out hitting the mark.
Harry had finally calmed down in his sleep so Draco made to move back to his own bed, when something pulled on his shirt. He looked down to see Harry had latched onto it and didn’t seem to be letting go anytime soon. Draco slid Harry over and crawled into the bed next to him. Harry snuggled close and Draco snuggled back. He laid looking at the beautiful face next to him and it made his heart hurt. He vowed right then and there, that Harry’s child will never know of the pain Harry went through, only happiness. He would protect her as his own.
The next couple of weeks passed about the same. Harry’s nightmares were constant, so Draco ended up in Harry’s bed every night. Draco had tried to get Harry to talk to him or Snape to no avail. Harry just tried to shut them out. They were always the same thing. Tom used him and Draco helped him after.
“You don’t know that he won’t care, he might-.” His eyes flick over to the sudden movement of the door opening. “Harry, you should not be out of bed.”
“You had several lacerations, all of which I healed. Unfortunately most were too deep to not scar, like the ones on your wrist. Many bruises, all gone. Dislocated shoulder, broken femur and tibia, several broken ribs, concussion, and broken jaw. I have healed almost everything.”
Draco hated this plan, but Harry knew what he was doing. They ascended the stairs. Ready for the fight of their lives.
“I said since I have been there from the beginning, I should be able to do it. I AM Uncle Draco after all.” Draco reasoned.
Dray quickly pushes in the last finger all while still sucking Harry. He made it a point to miss Harry’s prostate, not wanting him to come until he was inside his husband.
“There is way too much red in here. How do you come in here and not immediately not want to throw up?” Draco said as he looked around.
Harry shrugged and laid back while they planned. He hadn’t meant to fall asleep, but after the day's activities he was exhausted.
Harry could tell whoever it was, was crying. He recognized the voice. He knew it because the last time he heard it, it was insulting him. Now it was crying over him. He believed everything the voice was saying because the voice he had never known to show anything but cold was crying. Harry slid to the edge of the bed and tried to stand. It was very wobbly as he was still healing from the broken bones in his legs. After a few shaky steps, he gained his balance and made his way to the large entryway. He could still hear Snape trying to talk the voice into coming to see him. Using a lot of his waning strength he pulled open the door.
Harry placed a hand on his swollen stomach, still worried, and pressed down slightly. He felt a nudge back on his hand. His worries immediately lifted. Pomfrey came in and checked him over. She told him he had to stay for a few days, but he was going to be fine. He had only fractured his cheekbone and broken two ribs. One of his lesser injuries.
Registering Aries for school had been easy. They simply told Dumbledore that Aries was a cousin who was recently orphaned and Snape had been his godfather. Dumbledore didn’t seem suspicious, but you can never tell with him. Aries had been registered under the name of Snape since they didn’t want to give away anything too soon.
Sorry about all the mistakes in the last chapter. I went back and fixed them all...hopefully. I did write it at 3 am. Maybe this chapter will be better. Feel free to call out any mistakes you see as I am unbeta-ed.
Tom looked at his love and sighed. He walked over to the boy who had only ever really looked at once. He saw the pain on the unconscious child's face. He looked at the scar he had given him. He studied the child for a few more seconds before a feeling came over him. A feeling he had only ever had twice before. Once when he had met Severus Snape and when he first saw their son.
“That is insane. I am glad you found them. I hated to see Sev hurting that much. So, Hogwarts? What house do you think you will be in?”
Tom stood and tried to speak calmly and softly. “Harry, this is going to be really difficult to explain. Just let me explain your first questions, then any and all resulting questions. Lucius is here because this is his Manor. I am your Father. We have met but I didn’t know who you were. I am Tom Riddle. I-”
“Yeah, he doesn’t know where I am. I do think he is getting suspicious. He has questioned Mom several times. It is only a matter of time before he questions me.”
Before had been of course some of the chores, cupboard, and occasional smack upside the head. Now it was all of the chores, his stuff from Hogwarts in the cupboard, and actual beatings. Not a punch to the stomach and he’s done. It was worse than that. It was being made to lay on his bed and hit repeatedly with either Vernon’s belt, a wooden bat, or his own broom. The broom was the worst, as it was made to fly through the air with no resistance and take hits from bludgers.
“Draco, you need to remember who we are talking about. He is the same person who was laughing at his godfather’s funeral because he knew how much Sirius would have hated it. He has always taken bad things in stride and laughed about it after. I do appreciate everything you have done for him and continue to do. I like that you are waiting for him, but maybe this time, take what you want. You used to pretend to be a spoiled git, but you never were. Anything you got came from Snape. Don’t tell me I’m wrong because I’m not. Be selfish just this once.”
“They didn’t take my wand this time. Pretend you need to take me upstairs or Lily could get sick from being down here. Take me to Tom.”
“He will never see Lily. We will figure something out. Don’t worry. Your boyfriend and child will be safe.” Snape said with a raised eyebrow.
! “ Vernon started screaming. “Now I have just made it feel as if your blood is on fire. Are you ready to sign?
Draco now had his full attention. “Come on, do you really think I am that stupid? First of all, the way you acted with Granger and the Weasel. Second, You may be in Slytherin now, but you are still a Gryffindor. Third, your face may have changed, but your voice is exactly the same. And lastly, I have had a crush on Harry Potter since I met him in the robe shop. Do you really think I wouldn’t catch on? One thing I don’t get is how you conned your way into making my godfather believe you are Aries. How and why?” Draco crossed his arms across his chest and leaned against a desk that was close by.
“It’s okay, Harry. If you are happy, so are we. Right, Ron?” Ron nodded but stayed silent.  “Alright, what is the other thing?” She asked. So Harry told them about being taken, how he got out, and the cover story they made for Draco. When he got to the part about Lily he paused unsure of how to say it.
“That was the hottest thing,” Harry panted into his mouth, as he pushed Draco’s hand away and wrapped his own around Draco’s cock.
“It broke,” he replied, watching Draco’s face fall, “but Dumbledore showed me a memory of when it was first made, because it was actually made to him. By Trelawney.”
Oh, who was he kidding? Lupin was right, Lily was the most loyal person he’d ever met—he’d been a fluke, an exception. In an odd way, it made his stomach flutter, even though it had happened years ago. Lily had loved him, in a twisted sort of way. Loved him enough to come to him, enough to be with him even though she’d already agreed to marry James Potter.
Right. He still had to have a conversation with Harry, and suddenly that prospect didn’t seem so bad in comparison to worrying about Severus. Putting his shirt back on, he got off the bed, carefully straightening out the rest of his clothes. Harry didn’t need to know about him and Severus, not before they’d actually discussed what was going on between them.
Harry suppressed a sigh and answered, “Because a regular Protego doesn’t always do the trick. Some curses can break through a rigid shield like that, in which case you’d have to adjust it to give it some flexibility.”
“Severus,” Remus said softly, distracting him from the two boys. “What did You-Know-Who do to you? What happened at that meeting?”
Harry nodded and took a moment to focus. Somehow, the feeling of the spell had reminded him of how he felt his magic when casting healing forms. When he used the forms, he shaped the magic in his mind and it complied — perhaps he could do the same now.
“How do you know I’m worrying?” Harry asked, laughing softly as Draco pulled back slightly to look at him with half-closed eyes. He gave him a soft kiss and Draco hummed happily.
As the month now rapidly neared its end, Remus reminded them that they’d have to go to Diagon Alley to buy their school books soon. Harry only narrowly kept himself from throwing a minor tantrum when all three adults were adamant that Harry and Draco could not risk being seen together and they’d have to go separately. Resigned, he eventually agreed to Hermione’s request to go together a few days before term started. Draco convinced Narcissa to at least go on the same day, even if they had to keep their distance.
His pulse was still racing, so he summoned a book to distract himself with. It didn’t really work. His thoughts kept wandering back to imagining all the possible ways in which Draco might react, the scenarios ranging from appallingly pessimistic to steamy enough to make Harry’s blood flow south. Did Draco’s showers always take that long?
slow. While most of Harry’s initial shyness was well gone by now, they still hadn’t moved past snogging, although Draco certainly didn’t seem to mind when Harry’s hands wandered under his shirt. Fortunately, Draco had not yet tried to do the same, and Harry wasn’t sure how he’d react once he did. It wasn’t that he didn’t want Draco to touch him, quite the contrary, he was
Draco laughed, inspecting himself in the mirror. Yes, he rather liked the robes, and Harry’s reaction alone would’ve been enough for him to buy them in any case.
Anger shot through him at the thought of Severus. What the hell was wrong with the man? One moment they had been getting along wonderfully, talking every evening, even sharing a glass of wine sometimes, and then, without any warning, Severus refused to talk to him at all. Or to Harry. Remus wasn’t sure what made him angrier. Probably that Harry was getting hurt—the boy didn’t deserve to be treated like that. Remus had initially tried to ask Harry about what Severus had said to him, but Harry had evaded the topic repeatedly, and eventually Draco had taken Remus aside and given him a summary of what had happened. How Severus had openly rejected Harry, shut him down and out and left him behind. It got Remus’ blood boiling. After all that talk of how he wanted to make Harry’s relatives pay, Severus was now treating Harry with the same condescension, abandoning him.
The bottle that was being passed around reached Draco and he poured himself a glass. It was an open secret that the Slytherins didn’t much care for the no alcohol on school grounds rule, and Severus hadn’t ever openly said or done anything to stop them. Draco wondered briefly whether the other houses did the same, or if their Head of House was truly favouring them that much to let them get away with it exclusively. Immediately, his thoughts went back to Harry. Was he also sitting with his friends, having a drink and catching up with each other up in Gryffindor tower? Was he thinking about him?
Harry walked into the room, leaving a frozen Weasley and Granger behind at the door, and turned to face them. Even only seeing half of his face, Draco could tell that he was nervous. More steps and chattering echoed through the hallway, but as Weasley after Weasley reached the door, all the talking died down, until there was total silence as ten pairs of eyes stared disbelievingly into the drawing room. Ten? With mild surprise, Draco belatedly registered that a familiar head of silver hair was among the sea of red. Fleur Delacour. What the hell was Fleur Delacour doing here?
They spent another couple minutes discussing the lesson before they bid each other goodbye. Harry put the mirror back into his bedside table. A quick Tempus showed him that breakfast was about to end, which meant that the other Gryffindors were going to be back soon.
“Let’s just be glad it all turned out alright,” he said, as he pulled a bar of chocolate from his pocket, broke off a piece and began to nibble on it. “Will you have to report this to Albus?”
He sighed and looked at Draco, who had finally taken his hands off his face, listening intently, shame clear in his eyes. “Then when I met Ron he was, well,
“I, er, I didn’t ask,” he said, looking bashful. “I was a little distracted by the whole Lord Potter and Lord Black thing.”
“Concerns about me,” Draco guessed. Harry nodded. “Well, it was to be expected that at least one of them would balk. Although Hermione accepted my apology, so that’s a start.”
Harry laughed softly and pressed a kiss to Draco’s temple. After a few more moments of silence, he dared to ask a whispered question.
Severus’ expression darkened. “Last I checked it wasn’t up to you to decide what Harry can or can not receive as a gift,” he drawled.
It was a strange, diffuse sort of pain, paired with the feeling of his stomach dropping down to his feet. His heart was hammering in his chest, and for a moment he wasn’t sure what to do. Then he turned abruptly and fled back downstairs to his room, where Draco was lounging on the couch with a book. He looked up when Harry stormed in, his expression changing from one of concentration to concern in the blink of an eye.
That effectively rendered the entire Weasley clan speechless, so Harry went on to fill the silence, “My Gringotts records also showed that James named me his heir, so he must have known about it. And Sirius obviously named me his heir, too, so I kinda have two titles now.”
“Alright, say you’re right and the boy really is different. Why does it unsettle you so much?” Minerva asked neutrally.
For now, though, Harry’s mind was occupied entirely by the feeling of those ridiculously soft lips on his, every movement sending jolts of heat down his spine, pooling in his abdomen in a tight ball that he fought to ignore. Draco’s eyes were dark when they finally broke apart, burning with an intensity Harry knew by now but it still made his breath hitch.
Narcissa turned towards the table where the pile of wrapped packages had been replaced by the assortment of things Harry had received, now unpacked. She frowned and glanced at Severus. With a sigh, he stood up.
“Had to get away from the noise a bit,” Draco said, “Bill and Charlie started to teach the twins sea shantys, and it was overall a bit much down there.”
Remus drew in a sharp breath and Draco paled significantly at the now unobstructed sight of Severus’ wounds. It looked abhorrent. There was barely an inch of unmarred skin left on his arms and sides, his thighs only marginally better. Harry’s head was swimming and fear threatened to paralyse him.
Remus considered for a moment, then replied, “Natural terrain if you want to emphasise the practical relevance.”
He glared at the clock as if the device itself was at fault for going so slow. To his horror, it promptly disappeared.
To his relief it went over peacefully, though he couldn’t help but notice that Harry hadn’t paired any second or third years with them, but instead opted to assign his own friends to their Slytherin classmates. None of them looked too happy about it. They didn’t object, however, and Harry boldly turned his back on them, leaving them to deal with each other by themselves.
birthday, Potter, not mine,” he said, trying and failing to drawl as he usually did, his voice tight.
He took a moment, weighing his options—he still wasn’t convinced. Although he had to admit that he couldn’t deny the
Having already completed his homework for the entire summer, he spent an increasing amount of time in the dried out backyard, practising spells or reading a book he’d snatched from the library. He was bored out of his mind, trying to keep the anxiety lingering in the back of his mind at bay.
“It’s all very hazy, but I think I remember that form Harry cast, he was leaning over me. And I remember him talking, his voice. At some point I think he called my name.”
“Yes, I’m fine,” he responded automatically, but as soon as the words were out, he hesitated. “Actually, I was thinking about what Harry and Narcissa told earlier, about how Harry healed me. I feel like I remember…
Draco was all too aware that the entire group of sixth years was listening to them. He took a haughty tone as he replied, “Potter got detention for attacking me, what else? Serves him right.”
you, but he would never dare telling you now because he’s afraid you’ll reject him again—and understandably so after how unpleasantly you’ve behaved!”
“Relax, close your eyes,” said Snape, and Harry almost laughed. Relaxing was probably the last thing he’d do in Snape’s presence. But he had to learn this, so he forced himself to lean back into the dusty cushions, breathing deeply.
“I could ask the same of you, but seeing as you’ve deemed the rest of us unworthy of dining with the Chosen One, I suppose the answer is obvious.”
The memory of the Dark Lord digging into his mind and finding Lily flared up. No, perhaps this was a good thing. He had to compartmentalise anything that could make him vulnerable, and keeping this casual could only aid that endeavour. Severus couldn’t afford to fall in love now—not in the middle of a war with his own son at its centre. With Remus offering companionship and casual sex Severus got the best of both worlds—the safety of emotional detachment and the luxury of satisfied desires.
to me. It was a rather novel experience. He explained some stuff about Hogwarts to me, about the houses, and yeah, there I let his prejudice influence me, with how badly he talked about Slytherin. You came into our compartment and I recognised you, remembering that you were so sure you’d be a Slytherin, feeling so superior about it, and all I could think was that I didn’t want to end up living with people like Dudley again. So when you offered your hand in friendship, I refused, because I had just gotten away from a place where people looked down on me, I didn’t want to surround myself with that again. I’m sorry I judged too quickly, I truly am, but—”
Compared to how July had seemed to last forever, August flew by incredibly quickly. The inhabitants of Grimmauld Place had established their routines both individually and together, and they’d grown into a real family—at least in Harry’s opinion. Not that he knew much about what real families were supposed to be like, but to him they were one.
For the first few days after they had confirmed that Severus actually was Harry’s biological father, Harry hadn’t said a word during meals and disappeared somewhere in the house in between them. Remus had made a habit to knock on his door every time he passed it, taking hourly breaks from his reading to go down to the kitchen for tea or chocolate, simply to have an excuse to do so. Harry usually only returned to his room after his daily Occlumency lessons, which seemed to be going decently at least. At the very least Harry hadn’t said much when Remus had asked him about it. It was obvious that Harry didn’t want to talk about Severus, if it could be avoided, so Remus had set himself the rule to bring Severus up once in each conversation, but no more than that. If Harry refused to talk to him because he pushed him too hard, no good would come of it anyway.
Now, Severus was trying to get that intricately woven net of spells embedded into the very stone of Hogwarts to obey his will and provide him with more rooms. Albus had assured him that it was no problem to simply transform the walls into rooms.
Picking a set of school robes from a rack he made towards the changing rooms. He let out a sigh of relief as soon as he was behind the safety of the curtain. If this was how he was going to feel every time, their charade was going to be much harder than anticipated.
“Yes, well, we’ll see I suppose,” he said evenly. “With the higher level groups I want to cover a wide variety of jinxes, curses and other offensive spells, as well as duelling strategies specifically. Knowing spells is of no help if you can’t use them effectively in a fight. Remus and Raven taught me a lot over the summer, though I’ll stick to Remus’ curriculum when it comes to spells.”
A stab of betrayal made his gut churn. Didn’t he deserve the truth? Had she intended for him to never find out? Was he supposed to live his whole life believing that he was James Potter’s son?
“No, he told me himself and Harry isn’t the type to lie. It makes sense now, why he’s always worn such shabby clothing in the few instances in which he wasn’t wearing school robes.” Draco grimaced. “I ridiculed him for that, I can’t believe I was so stupid. I always thought Harry Potter must’ve grown up adored, basking in fame; I fear I’ve been dramatically misguided in that belief.”
At the brisk pace he was walking, he reached Dumbledore‘s office just a minute before seven. He gave the password that made the stone gargoyle move aside and climbed the spiral stairs.
Another nod, then he was gone, leaving Remus behind half-dressed on the bed. He fell back into the pillows with a sigh. Wonderful, now he’d spend the next few hours worrying until Severus was back. Last time he’d gone to a Death Eater meeting he’d returned nearly dead. Memories of that day flashed through Remus’ mind and he quickly tried to think of something else. At least his mood had been ruined thoroughly enough that he wasn’t horny anymore. He just needed something to do until Severus was back. Something that required all his attention, something like—
“Oh, right.” Harry couldn’t help but think that it had been pointless to attempt it without giving him any instructions, too, but he knew better than to say anything. He rose from his seat as well, following Snape into the hallway. He watched as the man headed up the stairs, undoubtedly to check in on Narcissa.
Harry looked somewhat reluctant, but he got up without hesitation and followed Albus into the hall. Soon enough, the familiar sound of someone apparating echoed through the house, and Severus felt himself relax a little.
“Do you mind Draco joining us?” he asked Harry, wanting to confirm that this wouldn’t jeopardise his attempt at a positive potions-experience for Harry. He still half expected the boy to say yes and send Draco away, but Harry just shrugged and even gave Draco a hint of a smile. Severus would have to talk to Remus about this, because there was obviously
“Of course it isn’t! Oh you poor thing, I can’t even imagine what you have to deal with! And to find out that
Remus smiled at her. “They’re probably enjoying the feast already. I’m sure you’ll have a letter from Draco tomorrow.”
of memories that would get them worked up. It was a miracle nobody had noticed anything, especially around the full moon. Once, Harry had almost walked in on them, and they’d only managed to avoid it because Severus had been smart enough to place a ward at the
“Almost any spell can be used to cause harm, that doesn’t make it mind-altering. I agree that some spells are far more malevolent than others and definitely deserving of the label ‘dark arts’, but that doesn’t make them somehow sentient. Using an Unforgivable Curse will not slowly twist your mind through dark magic.” He huffed grimly as he thought of Bellatrix. “Granted, it might twist your mind simply because you get used to the violence of it — but the same could be said about Muggle weapons.”
Harry kissed him instead of answering. He’d never been the best with words, and although his eloquence was improving steadily, some things were just easier to put into a kiss than into words. Draco hummed happily, and when they parted again his silver eyes were glazed over. Harry felt that someone should be proud of his self-control for not immediately snogging Draco again.
Draco leaned back against the tree he was sitting under on the dirty ground in Grimmauld Place’s backyard.
Severus gave a deep sigh, cast a cleaning charm at the floor and sat down next to Draco. “You’re right,” he said quietly. “Fathers should care for their sons, protect them. I know that. And I’m trying, but I can’t really blame him for not letting me. I’ve been horrible to him since the first day we met—”
Still laughing, Harry raised his hands in capitulation. He added, “I do need a codename for you, though. For when I’m talking to Ron and Hermione—I can’t very well call you Dad, and if people hear me talk about you using your name there will be too many questions in no time.”
“I was just wondering— The announcement on the board doesn’t say anything about an age limit for the DA, but it mentions O.W.L. level spells. Can my friends and I still come?”
He noted with surprise, that he found himself liking Narcissa. She was nothing like the cold, condescending woman he’d seen at the Quidditch World-Cup. He sobered again quickly. He had more questions to ask before he could allow himself to make any assumptions about her character. More important questions than why she’d dealt with a portrait.
“Not now, just tell me what you want!” Harry hated himself for rejecting the man so blatantly, after everything he’d done for him. After another short silence, Remus spoke again, his voice remarkably neutral.
It was quite a fascinating read, especially since the so-called “forms” turned out to be wandless spells, some without even an incantation, that required the caster to form their magic in specific patterns, before transferring that pattern to the patient. Before finding it, Harry had never even heard of wandless magic, but now thinking about it, it seemed obvious that it was possible. He wondered whether he could do normal spells wandlessly as well—he’d already started to cast wordlessly, after he had observed Remus and Narcissa cast in such a manner almost exclusively, and was improving quite quickly with it.
“It is beyond my ability to fully remove the curse,” Severus began, switching topics abruptly. “I was able to contain it in your hand, for now, but it will spread eventually. It will kill you, Albus.”
In Occlumency, he’d learnt to spread his magic around his mind, forming a shield. It was diffuse and broad. But this wasn’t Occlumency. It was the opposite. Occlumency was defensive, passive; but this, this was an attack, it was active. And while Harry knew nothing of being passive, he had a whole lot of experience taking action. He smiled inwardly.
Slowly, Harry brought up his arms around Draco’s waist to return the embrace, and after a few more moments, Draco finally felt him relax the slightest bit. It was a start. He ran one hand up and down Harry’s back soothingly, the way he had done several times by now after Harry had woken thrashing and screaming from a nightmare. He could feel the scars beneath his palm.
“Just make sure she’s warm,” Harry repeated for the fourth time, handing Severus the basket. “I’ll pick her up as soon as I can and bring her to Gryffindor tower, promise, but until then she needs—”
Harry cut himself off. Remus gave a soft growl, tilting his head. That’s how important Draco was? Important enough to make that list? He really had to pay better attention if he had missed that.
He blushed a little. “You were…interesting, and not just because you’re Harry Potter, but because of how
“So this goblin, Burgock, did a scan and suddenly tells me that I’ve inherited estates that I haven’t claimed yet, and asks whether I want to claim them now. I thought he must mean Sirius’ estate, y’know, because he named me heir of the Black lineage, so I said yes, and he summons this scroll with all my inheritances on it.”
“I think we shouldn’t tell them anything yet,” he said slowly. “We’ll do it eventually, of course, I don’t want us having to hide forever. But for now I kinda want to have this—us—just to ourselves for a bit. They’ll just bother us with questions or tell us we can’t close our doors if we tell them.” He smiled and gave Harry a slow kiss. “I just got you, I don’t want to let others throw in their opinions on us just yet. I want you to myself for a while.”
In contrast, Grimmauld Place was incredibly interesting, if not quite up to Draco’s usual standards. The most intriguing question of all was
An unbidden pang of jealousy went through Draco, as he realised that he himself had not received such an invitation. But who was he kidding, it was to be expected. His father was a Death Eater and the Malfoy name had suffered greatly from that revelation. Not that Draco cared all that much anymore, but it still stung some deeply ingrained part of him to be overlooked.
“No, he hasn’t hexed me or given me love potion, I’m not under any spell or compulsion, so don’t even start that.”
Sharp heat shot through him and suddenly he was on the edge. He broke the kiss with a gasp, throwing his head back, his fingers tightening in Draco’s hair.
with people. Harry had never seen anything that fit Fred and George better. As if summoned by the thought, the twins descended upon them with gleeful expressions on their faces.
His mother inhaled sharply at that, her eyes fixed on Harry, mustering him intently. The seamstress lost no time and directed Harry to stand low stool, as a measuring tape flew around him to take his measurements, while Draco began to stroll around the store, eyeing different fabrics and cuts. Within only a few minutes, he had picked the first few and brought them back to the seamstress. She spelled the robes to Harry’s measurements and sent him into a fitting room to get changed. Draco turned his attention back to the store’s selection, when his mother stepped up to him.
