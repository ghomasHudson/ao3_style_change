Harry wasn’t convinced from that talk and still wasn’t convinced now.
Harry didn’t think his heart could possibly break any more, but here he was.
“Anywhere you like,” was the soft reply, and Harry believed it.
“I’m, er, pleased you liked it,” he said in a clumsy attempt. “I...liked mine, too.”
Swallowing, Draco forced his lips apart, trying to overpower the thrum of shame with the louder tattoo of obedience. Harry eased his thumb over Draco’s tongue and Draco closed his lips around it, refusing to think of the specifics of the action. He wasn’t
Lily’s nose wrinkled in annoyance. “No,” she retorted. “To see if you can juggle it. Godiva’s Uncle Lester is an
“Manners, please, Lily,” Harry chastised. “You could say hello first before bombarding Professor Malfoy with questions.”
Harry gave a weak half-smile and rubbed the back of his neck with one hand. Merlin, he was tired.
Harry laughed. “You may be right, Professor. Love seems like a mad business.” He gave Hermione’s arm a squeeze. “Thanks, you two, for showing me all this, and everything else, besides.” Hermione knocked his hand away and hugged him properly, and then she and Ron hurried off to class. Harry went back to the dormitory and wrote out a quick note.
“Merlin, didn’t know my clothing was such a source of consternation for you,” Harry remarked, torn between amused and a little self conscious. Memories of drowning in Dudley’s clothes and the ensuing torment began to resurface.
The tap was running to fill the sink, and Potter stood over it. Draco wanted to touch him. And why shouldn’t he? Potter hardly seemed opposed to it. Draco stepped in close and Potter stilled. Draco dipped his head, pressing his lips to the slope of Potter’s trapezius. Draco flicked his gaze up to observe Potter in the reflection of the window over the sink. The man’s eyes were downcast, his fingers clutching the lip of the discoloured porcelain. Draco shifted his mouth upwards, seeking the hinge of Potter’s jaw.
"It's amusing. He gets all jittery and unintelligible, like he can't parse my motives. But he's relieved, too, and grateful. Perhaps I do just enjoy provoking him, or maybe it is nice to have some company for once. I think Scorpius enjoys being there, too. You should have seen him with the Potter boys: He was so exuberant and, I don’t know, joyful, I suppose. Have I done wrong by him, do you think? He had a few mates in primary school, but nothing compared to how close he is with Albus. I’m afraid I’ve let my anti-social tendencies deprive him somehow. I’d never thought he was lonely, but I suspect he might not have known it himself.”
“I was hoping the sleep spell would be fully reversible,” Malfoy pointed out, catching his son round the arm to steady him, “but it seems to have taken a bit of a toll. Thankfully, the prophesying hasn’t resumed.” He ushered Scorpius, whose eyelids were already drooping, over to the table. “Here, dearest. Wait a moment and I’ll fix you a bit of a snack.”
“Al,” it was Potter’s voice in the hall. There was a brief knock, followed by the click of the boy’s bedroom door being opened. “Half an hour, then it’s time to start getting ready for bed.”
“Oh,” Lily considered this. “My Dad knows some healing spells. He could probably do one for you.”
“I suppose,” Draco reflected, “because I didn’t die on the grounds.”
“You’re not just my best mate,” Harry mumbled, Firewhisky definitely not helping contain the grateful bloom of emotion, “you and Hermione, you’ve given me all the family I’ve got.”
Harry couldn’t come up with a good retort so instead he just nodded, dully.
“What do you think, Hiram? Should we pair you off with Fitz and see how you do with a bat?”
Before either Harry or Al could comment on Draco’s plan, the door to Draco’s office burst open with enough force to send it rebounding off the stone wall with a loud thunk.
(See the end of the chapter for
Green eyes peeked out from a crack at the door.
The apartment was dark and had a faint smell of spoiling food. He flushed in humiliation as Harry and Draco followed him in.
“Quite a skilled Occlumens, if I recall.”
Draco furrowed his eyebrows, his mouth a thin, pink line, “I’d rather you not go and get yourself stuck inside the tortured psyches of preteens, if you can help it.”
Malfoy simply gave her an icy, supercilious glance. “I’m sure I don’t know what you mean,” he dismissed her, “Potter, some pumpkin juice, if you would.”
He heard the shuffle of feet and he turned his head. Jamie was there, hands in his pockets, looking down. “Hey,” he muttered.
“It was heartless what she did.”
Hermione squeezed his hand and gave him a weak smile, “I would rather just see everyone healthy and happy come January.”
Harry chuckled, “Do you want to go through the next seven years having to differentiate between ‘bird Hiram’ and ‘wizard Hiram’?”
It was Malfoy’s first command and Harry felt an initial flash of irritation. He looked up to protest, but there was a challenge across Malfoy’s features, as if he expected Harry to argue. So instead, Harry just pulled the sock and shoe onto Malfoy’s other foot, double knotting the laces with a smart tug.
“Sorry, Dad,” Scorpius replied automatically. “But it is clever, isn’t it?”
The question startled Draco. “As insidious wastrels?” he bluntly elaborated. “Of course.”
“Are you absolutely certain you’re a Gryffindor?” Draco asked Hermione, giving her an incredulous look.
There was a weak cough from beside them and Harry turned to see Clark’s eyes were fluttering open. Draco disbanded the bubble, “Merlin, Tiering, are you alright?”
“Good morning,” he managed.
like blokes.”
“Guess that’s not how it works.”
The first thing Harry saw as he stumbled out of the flames was a rug, richly embroidered with green and gold serpents. Dropping the Disillusionment Charm, he looked up. It was a mistake. There, restored to its former garish glory, was the crystal chandelier. Harry felt ill: There was a roiling sensation deep in his chest which left him unsettled in the worst way. The overbearing marble fireplace was at his back and the walls were that same deep aubergine as they’d been that fateful Easter weekend. Harry could remember the scrambled, stinging mess of his face, the cold spear of dread, Hermione’s screams, the slick, wet sound of Dobby’s flesh parting under Bellatrix’s blade.
Christmas wasn’t so bad after Jared met Pig. He was the tiniest little feather-ball Jared had ever seen, and he wasn’t shy like Constance, but he liked being pet like she did, and he liked being talked to even if he didn't seem interested in the little toy caboose.
Olivier Rivers was a quiet, contemplative boy with dark skin and golden eyes that made Harry realise he really
"I don't mind," Harry whispered, like it was a secret, because it felt like a secret. "I like being the only one who thinks you're nice. Makes me a bit special, doesn't it?"
Jamie smiled and jerked his head as if encouraging Scorpius to come closer. Scorpius couldn’t think of a reason why he shouldn’t. He also found he was more than a little relieved to see a welcoming expression.
Draco spent some time in his laboratory, carefully drying and storing the day’s specimens and adding labels as required. He also checked his stores and made a list. They’d have to make a trip to Diagon Alley in the next couple of weeks, to gather supplies for the next term.
“Mm,” The other boy hummed. Harry realised in horror that Draco didn’t believe him.
Hi everyone. Wow, so somehow that was the last real chapter???? Stay tuned for an extremely fluffy epilogue. So much sincere appreciation to you all. Thanks so much for saying nice things.
“Yeah, but he wants to be a very cool eleven,” Harry chuckled.
Clark, blushing slightly as he still did occasionally with Draco’s attention, sighed. “Jared! You can’t just steal from the Fantyl’s breakfast table to feed the bloody owl!”
Malfoy nodded as if that was settled, although what ‘that’ was, Harry hardly knew.
“Which one’s he?”
Harry couldn’t deny the physical proof of his violence. He’d scarred Malfoy, permanently, it would seem. He could still feel the sensation of corded flesh under his palm. He’d been a boy, he reminded himself, just an angry kid, when he’d done that. In all honesty, he’d forgotten it almost entirely. That realisation brought with it a tide of guilt. How could he just forget an act like that? Maiming another person. Hell, Harry still thought of Voldemort more often than not when he saw his own scar in the mirror, so it wasn't as though he didn't know what it was like. It seemed a horrid injustice, for Harry to have simply moved on, while all the while Malfoy was carrying with him that blatant reminder.
“I know you didn’t,” Harry sighed, giving Clark’s hand a little squeeze where it lay on his arm. “But Draco knows the tricks my healer’s taught me to help me get through it, and so we got through it. You're safe and I'm sorted and that's what matters.”
“Merlin, Harry,” Hermione gasped, “You’re right. I didn’t believe they existed. Professor Binns said Ms. Bloodstone was really out to lunch for believing in them; and he’s a ghost, he should know.”
“Well?” Hermione said again to Harry, “What do you think?”
“Despite everything he’s done?” Percy decried.
“My map’s gone,” Harry admitted. “I think whoever took Draco’s letters also took mine, and my map was mixed up in them. I’ve only just realised. But whoever has it likely won’t be able to access it.”
PPS. I would really like to rework the description for this story since it currenly only covers like the first few chapters. If anyone has suggestions for what should be included, I am very keen to hear ideas!
“No, sorry, no. More the muggle idea of ghosts, I meant.”
Harry considered this. He supposed he’d known as a child that Malfoy had been jealous. The
Al was surprised; they didn’t get a lot of outside entertainment. He also thought it sounded like it could be quite a bit of fun. He’d never been to a carnival before. A memory popped into his mind of Jamie begging Mum to take them to one in Wiltshire, and her retort that carnivals were a great waste of Galleons. Al wondered if maybe he could erase that memory, too. He’d been trying not to do that so often these days, not since he’d had that talk with Dad about it a few weeks ago, but sometimes it was just easier. Besides, if Dad had his way and a counterspell was created, Al wouldn’t get to live without his horrid memories for much longer, so he might as well rid himself of it. That way he wouldn’t stew over it, like Jamie no doubt did. That would explain his permanently foul mood, anyway.
“And what hypothesis was that?” Teddy asked, clearly amused.
Also, some of the ideas (especially erasing painful memories) from this are borrowed from Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind. I just think it is such an intriguing philosophical idea that I wanted to play around with it some!
“What’s the matter, Potter?” He inquired, almost kindly.
“It’s quite alright,” Draco responded. He realised he’d embarrassed the child, and in front of Scorpius no less. He attempted some warmth as he explained his reasoning. “My reticence is certainly not a comment on the quality or ingenuity of your work. I am simply choosing to be cautious.”
“It wasn’t just the pain and the adrenaline or whatever. Maybe it was at first, but not later, not when it was just us. What did you want that from
Harry squeezed Draco’s fingertips into his palm.
(See the end of the chapter for
The witch gave him a thoughtful smile then, warm and affectionate. She reached across and squeezed his hand. Draco wasn’t used to a great deal of touch outside of his very select circle, but he didn’t pull away.
Draco pulled back, pouting, “You’re going to deny me on my last night? That seems terribly cruel.”
it added a layer of intensity that thrilled through him.
“Try me,” Harry directed.
“Now, we add the thought behind the gesture. Have you ever meditated?”
CW: Brief description of non-consensual (non-sexual) touch.
Weasley, Draco, if you would,”
At that moment, Nearly-Headless Nick floated through the doorway, followed by the other house ghosts, Moaning Myrtle, and a few other spectres Harry vaguely recognised.
“You didn’t think her that awful, if I remember correctly,” Harry chided, the lightness to his voice perhaps a little forced. Draco found the valiant front to be just so typically, endearingly Potter.
He had both hands on Draco now, the second one steadying the fine bone of his jaw so he could take and take, and Merlin, he wanted. He reveled in the faint scrape of stubble, the sharp angles of Malfoy’s hips, the push of Malfoy’s impatient tongue against his.
“Is my mind close enough to human’s for your spell to work on me? That is a question indeed.” The Ravenclaw ghost gave him a pensive look.
Harry watched the photos fondly. In the first, Teddy toppled over from a seated position and giggled up at the camera, chubby arms outstretched. In the second, the baby rotated through a series of noses, each more pronounced and ludicrous than the last.
“See?” Clark said, “just because she’s dead, she’s still, like, got rights, hasn’t she?”
“Very well. Listen to Mr. Weasley, Scorpius. Don’t touch anything without permission. I’m off to Pheasant and Fowl. Any requests?”
“Insofar as I am reasonably able,” Harry agreed.
“Well, if we have to use a little confounding charm to ease things, we will. Don’t worry about it.”
Malfoy lifted his eyes. His gaze met Harry’s, unflinching and sure. The very air in Harry’s lungs seemed to still. He couldn’t look away, and if Harry hadn’t known better, he would have sworn that Malfoy could read his every thought.
“What are you wearing to the memorial tomorrow?” Draco demanded. It was the following morning and Malfoy had dragged a reluctant Harry to the library to study.
“Course,” Harry mumbled, tips of his ears burning. Why exactly did he agree to this? Malfoy gave him another pointed look, “Ah, thanks for inviting me,” he tried.
Malfoy schooled his features, “You have my family's gratitude for sparing my mother,” he said carefully.
“Merlin,” Harry winced. “He didn’t mince words, I see.”
“Well,” Hermione caught up with Harry on his back from the kitchens. He’d been sent on another scone-gathering mission by Draco and was overburdened with Rolly’s finest offerings in a big basket suspended by a handle in the crook of his elbow. “What did it say? I’ve been trying to catch you alone for ages. I thought it was good news, but you’ve been mum about it ever since.”
“Sort of,” Harry nodded, slowly. “I...was one, too. Not on purpose, I don’t think, but a bit of his soul leached into mine, and then he killed it off, right before your mum found me.”
“I’m fine,” Harry repeated.
“I didn’t want him to. You never tell me what it was like, Dad. I know you were there and everyone says you were this big deal, that you ended the whole war. I’ve even read about it, but it doesn’t seem real, because you always brush me off, like it wasn’t this whole thing. But it was, and I want to know about it.”
“Jamie’s got some self-setting skittles going on in the garden, so Lily, Rose and Hugo are out there,” Harry offered. “I’m sure they are hoping you’ll join them.”
“We’re all actively grieving, though, that’s the problem, isn't it?” Harry reflected.
Scorpius knew he wasn’t athletic or gregarious like Jamie, or wickedly bright like Albus or Januarius Boone, but that didn’t mean he needed protecting all the time. “A bit tired is all. Corin Bingham snores like you wouldn’t believe, and it keeps me up all night. I’ve got to readjust, that’s all.”
Draco nodded, sweeping aside Harry’s fringe and kissing his forehead, “I get them, too,” he said, almost matter-of-fact.
Another smack, “You can do better.”
“No,” Draco agreed quietly, “I suppose it isn’t.”
Scorpius followed suit, only glancing at Al’s second note once he was seated again.
“Merlin, Harry, you’re startled me.”
“I’m fine,” Scorpius relented. “Father and your dad took me to the cottage in Hogsmeade for the night. I’ll be more careful not to miss another evening, and my dad says he’ll make the potion stronger.”
Harry bit the inside of his cheek, trying not to grin. It was a relief knowing that Hermione would just be happy for him, no jealousy or envy or muddled emotions. “Er, they’ve invited me to their trial day in December.”
“Get on with it,” Malfoy growled.
“Sounds shockingly reasonable,” Draco offered.
“He’ll come round,” Hermione assured him. “Just keep talking to him. You’re not the one he’s angry with, you know, you’re just the one who’s there to shoulder the attacks.”
“She’s in my bloody head, Lavender, she’s in here!" Draco said through clenched teeth, yanking at his hair with one hand, as if trying to physically remove her. He squeezed his eyes shut and then sighed through pursed lips. "Alright. She's gone."
Potter’s expression turned serious, his lips pursed in concern. “Did I overdo it with the teasing or what have you?” he asked.
(See the end of the chapter for
Harry grinned, trying not to laugh, “You too, mate.” Draco narrowed his eyes. Jones’ team was gathering nearby, their cloaks a blinding chartreuse with patches reading “Pygmy Puffs” on each of their uniforms.
“Considering Harry made me promise to wear my amulet no fewer than six times, I didn’t think you’d really go along with it.” The boy bit his lip, looking suddenly small and unsure, the pride of his accomplishment slipping. “And besides, I didn’t know if it would work.”
Thanks to everyone for reading and for their kind comments! Another dialogue chapter....I'm finding it tricky to navigate the things that readers of the books know, but the characters don't necessarily know about each other! Anyway, the next fic will have more plot than this one, I promise. (Also, a reminder to please subscribe to my author account if you want to read the next fic, since this one is drawing rapidly to a close!)
“I just,” Ron cleared his throat, blushing slightly. “I just wanted to say thanks. For hearing me out, for forgiving me, for somehow wringing an apology from
“Yeah,” Clark breathed. “Still. It’s, um, kind of nice to hear it.”
After dinner, with Remy safely asleep in his swing, Harry set about clearing both tables and tackling the dishes.
Jared shrugged. “I wanted to show Constance my new train.”
Draco rarely went in much for kissing. He’d let men beat him bloody far before he’d seek out the slide of their tongues against his. But with Potter it was different. He wanted this, exactly this, the crushing, brutal press of their mouths more than he’d ever wanted any whip on his back.
Harry muddled through as best he could. Most people asked questions in that vein: which events had been the war and which had been other sorts of terrorism, and who was really in the know. Harry  tried to downplay the amount of memory magic likely used (he doubted that would be a welcome response), instead focusing on 'magical locations muggles, er, non-magic users,' weren't aware of. He also fell back on 'Ministry information, I’m afraid I don’t have that sort of knowledge' a few times.
“Wyverns,” Harry informed him, taking the seat Ron had saved for him. He looked out over the pitch to see the game was unexpectedly well-attended,  “Not a bad turn out for a rec match,” he noted.
CWs: discussion of canon-compliant child abuse, anxiety/panic response.
“Oh,” Clark said, “Hope you weren’t involved in that mess this morning. I saw it in the muggle newspaper. Over a hundred soldiers killed from an airstrike, did you know?”
“Yes, Harry.” Draco’s voice was low in his throat. Harry scanned his face: the set jaw, the need and apprehension in his eyes, and nodded.
“Teddy!” Harry exclaimed. He’d nearly forgotten his godson was due back today, what with everything that had happened.
“What if it’s not enough?” Clark whispers. “What if I go back to school and I’m not there and she goes to bed and stays there, not bothering to buy groceries or pick Jared up from school.  What if she gets into her paranoia and gets lost there, and I can’t do anything about it?”
“What’s that?” He said as Draco approached to kiss to him before settling himself in his new usual chair in the updated and vastly improved drawing room. It was Harry’s favourite room: exposed beams and warm, rich tones that opposed the more chilly, streamlined aesthetic Draco had decided upon for much of the house. The wall between the drawing room and the dining room had been removed, making it all feel more open and inviting.
Draco shrugged sullenly. “I’m not pleased with how he’s neglected Potter.”
have that. I’m alright, okay? I’m still mad and such, about Mum, but it’s getting better, a bit. So, like, calm down, yeah?”
“Lie down,”
With this new information at hand, the Potter kids all started in at once:
She regarded him seriously, her beautiful face unreadable.
“I just..." Clark continued, trying his best to explain, "well, sports stars make heaps of money for no discernable reason, and you’re a healer so you make plenty, too. You and Harry have more than you could possibly need. It’s wealth hoarding, isn’t it?”
“Wait,” Harry said suddenly. “Sorry. I just...I had one more question.”
“I don’t know,” Teddy replied, unbothered. “Travel, write a book, turn around and teach languages myself, translate old texts, interpret, I’ll see where the wind takes me.”
“You’re in for something alright,” Harry grumbled.
Harry did, shuddering viscerally at the wrongness of its positioning. The way the bones felt like they were slipping apart where they should be solid.
“Right,” Clark said, flushing. “Sorry, I’ll--”
Harry reluctantly surrendered his wand, relieved he had as much wandless magic as he did. He felt a bit naked without it.
“What?” Draco echoed.
“Yes,
“It would be, yes,” Professor Malfoy agreed, bringing out a sheet of labels and a pot of ink. “But it is more potent freshly ground. Too much uniformity detracts from the character of many potions, I find. That is why I prefer to brew many myself, instead of purchasing them. As for the hooves, the seventh-years will be using it tomorrow for their Poultices of Invulnerability.”
mother at all, but
“Fine,” Scorpius lied.
Once the note was penned, Father dropped a kiss to Scorpius’ hair, and sent him on his way.
“I was wondering why it is your house but his name’s on the family tree in the drawing room,” Clark said thoughtfully, “But can we go back to the bit about me being used, because I feel like that’s something I should know about.”
Harry wasn’t lying when he said Clark was doing well. Over the past weeks, he'd been able to expand that void to mostly block out his thoughts, provided Harry didn’t try very hard. Nevertheless, Harry had still borne witness to more than a few deeply personal memories.
Eighth year potions that morning had been cancelled—the last thing students needed, it was decided, was to have any sort of telepathy, no matter how finite. Instead they were slated for double DADA.
“Draco, of course I care, Merlin, I fucking care, you’re all I—”
“Hm,” he said.
“Are you absolutely certain—”
(See the end of the chapter for
Harry examined his vault at Gringotts. Eiderdown End had wiped out much of his savings, back when he’d thought he’d rise through the Auror ranks quickly and easily, and he’d have a robust income on which he could rely. That was long before he’d had four children who grew like particularly resilient weeds. The kids and their myriad interests with endless kits and comics and supplies and Harry’s utter inability to deny them—no, all that was not ideal for the balance of his vault.
“Yeah,” Weasley huffed. “Nothing but a bloody predator. He’s not got any money so I assume you must be going for fame or public adoration or something equally self-serving.”
Atwal looked scandalised. “They just let you scarper off into each other’s beds? At school?”
“Harry?” He said, sounding bewildered. He observed the larger picture, “Oh. Fuck.”
Clark’s eyes narrowed angrily, “Well, I’m muggle-born, aren’t I? Barely know a thing about any of this. I just know its fucking weird and I miss my mates and I can’t charge my mp3 player in this bloody castle and the battery ran out weeks ago. How does anyone in this world listen to music? Besides,” his voice dulled, “my mum, she’s….not well. I sort of thought I might just be getting what’s she’s got. But then after I did what the lady in my brain told me to, the feeling went away and I was just relieved. But then the next morning it was gone so I thought maybe it had been a bad dream? Or I hoped it was, maybe.”
Clark shakes his head against Harry’s jumper. “The day after is all regret and self-loathing. She’ll have to face how she talked so loud and said stupid things and flirted with Charlie fucking Weasley who’s a million years younger than her, and fuck her, she’ll be right to be embarrassed, what did she do that for?”
“Yeah,” Harry agreed. “It was.”
“If he’s a guest,” Lily answered, her voice sharp with scrutiny, “how come he’s the one who made dinner? Aren’t you supposed to make dinner for your guests? Daddy, I don’t think you’re being a very good hostess.”
“That’s not what I meant,” Harry cut in quickly. He ran a frustrated hand through his hair. Draco felt a cold surge of fear in his throat because Harry looked concerned, he looked puzzled, he didn’t look like he was in control at all, and if he wasn’t in control then—
“Harry,” Draco cut him off, voice firm, “enough.”
“Yeah, alright,” Al acquiesced. “I’ll set up the board.”
“Not as long as yours,” Harry responded. Draco’s now fell almost to his chin, with a neat side part and a voluminous, sleek sweep of hair which framed his face. Harry thought it looked quite smart, even though he was pretty sure Draco used something so it didn’t lie too flat. Draco had a lot of grooming tinctures and ointments that Harry didn't recognise, actually. He'd noticed them lining the sink in their shared bathroom. “And no, it’s fine, I...I don’t like feeling like I am advertising who I am.”
Claire’s chin wrinkled as she pursed her wobbling lips. Her face reddened and her eyes filled as she turned on her heels, away from both Harry and, he noticed, her friends. He supposed he should feel badly for humiliating the girl, but she’d needed to hear a frank rejection from him to finally get it. He almost wished Draco had been there to eviscerate her properly, and with less kindness, but that was cruel. Her words had been cruel, too, though, or at least thoughtless. They’d salted wounds Harry had only wanted tended. He didn’t want to doubt how things were with Draco. He wanted to cast all the blame on Lucius, to hold Draco close and comfort him and make promises of forgiveness. He couldn’t do those things, though, not until they’d had it out, which would doubtless be exhausting and arduous, and full of things he'd rather not acknowledge.
Harry glanced at Draco across the table. The goose egg on his forehead had eased significantly overnight, much to Harry’s relief, and there was only a faint bruise remaining. He’d not gone home yet that morning, and so instead of the floral print button up from the evening prior, he’d borrowed one of Harry’s old T-shirts. It was black faded to grey, and much too big for him: the collar was warped and hung low, exposing his collarbones. Harry tried not to let that draw his focus. He forced himself to flick his gaze up to meet Draco’s. Those grey eyes were serious as he gave Harry a single nod of encouragement.
“Oi, Harry,” Ron interrupted, “Your lot got a name?”
“Yellow?” offered Clayburne.
“Giving a bit of a send off speech with me tomorrow, at the ceremony.”
“Is Scorpius staying the night again?” Lily asked.
“Now, Scorpius,” Draco repeated sternly. The boy scampered off with a final huff.  Draco turned his gaze back upon Harry. “I suppose you’re not here simply to reminisce?”
Draco’s already tense shoulder gave a terse shrug. “It’s your house.”
Harry blushed, feeling entirely stupid, "Sorry, Professor."
, Harry told himself, and this time, it was his own voice.
“Potter,” he said in greeting.
Harry couldn’t help the tender half-smile that he felt blooming on his own. “All that self reliance and distrust business. I know me being at Hogwarts puts a dent in your plans to carefully cordon off every section of your life, but those were false divisions, anyway. It all bleeds over eventually. So it’s sooner than expected, but it doesn’t mean we should bin what we have.”
“And I don’t fancy sex with a man who’s wont to fall asleep before either of us finishes.”
“Yes,” Clark sighed, “I’ll let you know if I need anything.”
Draco was studying when they got back to Grimmauld Place. Harry felt a pang of guilt because he’d been less than attentive to his own studies lately, and he’d known he’d gotten in the way of Draco’s routine as well.
Draco was rather enjoying herding Potter and his lot around the shops. This realisation dawned on him just as they were leaving Quality Quidditch Supplies, Potter sliding a paper bag containing Jamie’s new kit onto the bottom rack of the pram (he really was the most indulgent father).
“Thanks,” Draco replied quietly.
Seamus and Parvati suddenly dissolved in a pile of giggles as Dean refilled their glasses.
” He declared, firing the spell.
Mother glowed happily, but Draco wasn’t sure that Clark had meant it as a compliment, seeing how the boy was surveying the dinner spread as though it were the very picture of overabundance. Draco had to admit that the teenager (hell, when had Clark become a
“When did you learn to cook, anyway?” Al asked his brother suspiciously.
"Maybe not a good person," Draco corrected, "but I'm attempting to at least not be a dismal one."
“You certain that’s a good idea, Mum?” Clark asked.
“Your what?” Harry asked.
“Go,” Potter insisted. “We’ll be fine.” And so it was decided that the Potters and the Malfoys would spend their day poking around shops in Diagon Alley—together.
McGonagall’s face gentled slightly, “I can’t say I blame you. I’m certain she’ll be alright in a couple of days—ah, Poppy, excellent.”
Their conversation was cut short when Luna blew a shrill whistle, “We’ve only got so much time with this potion,” she said, sitting side-saddle on a broom in what looked to be a shockingly unstable arrangement, but Luna didn’t seem to mind. She crossed one knee over the other and gathered several shawls around her shoulders. “So teams are roughly Gryffindor and Slytherin vs. Hufflepuff and Ravenclaw. I’ve hidden a green and scarlet stick and a purple and yellow stick somewhere on this pitch—on the opposing team’s side. First team to bring their stick across the midway point is the victor! Begin!”
Malfoy, now standing also with hands on the small of his back, arched backwards, twisting his head one direction and then the other, as in an attempt to crack his neck. He was the picture of indifference.
“Yes, I suspect so.”
“Very well,” she dismissed them, “then I shall bid you all goodnight.”
“So, she’s lying,” Ron acknowledged, “I mean, she’s clearly lying. Can’t they give her some Veritaserum?”
Al looked stricken, tears welling up in his wide grey-green eyes.
“Yes, alright,” Lily nodded. She appeared solemnly appeased. “Not that I want you to die, either. But if I had to choose…I’d rather it was you getting killed.”
As if summoned by his thoughts, Draco appeared at the entrance, giving him a nod. “Tiering would like a word, Potter, if you would.”
“It’s a long story, Clark, without a happy ending,” Harry tried to dissuade him.
“Doubtful."
“Really, though, doing better?”
Atwal had his arms and ankles crossed, propped up against the head of the bed, looking surly in the way only a teenager could. Clark eyed Harry warily, guilt etched into his  furrowed brow and in-drawn lips. Harry wanted to drop his head to his hands again. He wanted to fall asleep and let Draco take care of him, curl around him in that snug, determined grasp of his. He shoved that impulse aside. His breath filled his lungs fully. The smoke was gone. He leaned more firmly into Draco.
“Scorpius,” he scolded, turning to look at his son. His irritation was forgotten instantly at the sight of the boy’s wide-eyed, anxious expression.
“Stay,” he ordered. Malfoy was gasping, finally able to draw a full breath. He rubbed his neck and obeyed, wide eyes on Harry.
Harry sighed, tiredly, “I haven’t given up on my values, Claire, you know that.”
like that,” Harry wondered aloud, “it wasn’t full power, but it wasn’t far off, either.”
Harry had thought it best to warn Dudley beforehand about the dating a bloke thing. He figured if Dudley was going to be a wanker about it, then he wouldn’t bother meeting up with him. To his surprise, the note Pigwidgeon had reappeared with simply said, “Cheers, Harry, I look forward to meeting him, then.” The two blond boys shook hands, and then Dudley cleared his throat and introduced the girl, Tanya, as his girlfriend. Harry and Draco shook her hand as well, and then they entered the pub and found a table.
“You think I fancy telling my two teenage sons I’ve re-evaluated my sexuality at 38?” Harry scoffed. “Believe me, I’m hoping to postpone that conversation for a good while yet.”
“Fucking hell,” Harry yelped. “Are you serious?”
Draco’s breath was stuttering.
Malfoy didn’t look convinced, “Doubt it. Like Weasley said, I’m not very popular these days.”
For what was perhaps the very first time, Malfoy smiled at him.
“What—” Scorpius attempted.
“You’re acting weird,” Scorpius blurted out, then covered his mouth in horror. That was something Al would say, not him! He knew far better than to be so rude.
“Fine,” Draco allowed. What the boy called Potter was hardly the material point. “And you don’t know what brought it on? You’ve not had an episode for quite some time; I had hoped we’d found an adequate treatment.”
“James was a great help,” Malfoy replied.
“I know,” Harry reassured him, standing up beside the bed and shifting the pillow from that side out of the way. “That’s not what it’s for. Come here and kneel down, facing the head of the bed.”
“Oi, fuck off,” Ron replied, but there was only relief in his voice, and no heat. “Now, I bet you have more things to do than standing around bullshitting with me all day. What’ve we got?”
Thanks soooooo much to everyone for sticking around and checking out the first chapter! I was a little anxious that established relationship/sequel wouldn't be as much of a draw as some other themes, so I'm so grateful you are all here!!! Thanks also for the well-wishes for my continued recovery! Still going strong.
Tomorrow would be a fresh start, Harry reaffirmed as he tracked Meat Pie’s flight path across the waning moon. Tomorrow, they’d all be somewhere new, and maybe, with a little help, he could start to staunch the flow of grief that poured from his family.
The next, more significant ax, came later that evening. Professor McGonagall entered the eighth year common room with a drawn expression. She came upon Harry and Draco studying at their usual table.
Harry reached out to smooth the hair from Clark’s forehead. It was filthy with soot and debris, mottled an unflattering grey colour. “We’re not sure yet, but my guess it was the same problem as last semester. Mrs. Brown must not have been working alone.”
“What do you mean?” demanded Jamie, looking unexpectedly saddened and shaken.
Scorpius sighed inwardly and dipped his quill back in his pot of ink. He’d been so very hopeful that those spells would work, that something could be discovered to keep the prophecies at bay. Like many of Al’s wild ideas, however, they’d not come to fruition, at least not in a way that was helpful to Scorpius. It had also become apparent pretty early on that Al had become more attentive to the ways in which the spells could benefit him, and not what would be helpful to Scorpius. Al was like that, though, and his self-interest could be part of what made him brilliant. Scorpius didn’t begrudge him that. He was still the most loyal friend Scorpius had ever had.
“So even if he does change, it’s just to fit in? Or so I won’t be pissed at him?” Harry questioned glumly.
This made Rudá laugh again. “We have not let a white man step foot on our land in thousands of years, Boi-tatá. What makes you think you would be the first?”
“I have something for you,” he whispered.
Harry gave a curt nod.
“For the last time, Potter,” Malfoy spat, “I don’t want your apologies.” He covered Harry’s hand with his own, and ground the probing fingers into his scar with a violent shudder, then groaned.
She didn’t make a move to touch the child, but she didn’t have to, because a moment later, Jared launched himself at her, wrapping his pudgy arms around her neck.
“Come on, you lot,” Jamie barked, puffed up with all the self-importance that comes with being relied upon in a crisis.  He corralled the wide-eyed children away from the absolute spectacle that was their parents.
“Ah yes, changing nappies and warming infant formula. I sound like quite the villain, Weasley, you’ve found me out.”
Harry ground his molars. Fucking Myrtle. He knew he should be kinder the ghost, she really was just lonely—and so, Harry interrupted his own thoughts, was Lavender.
“Come on, Potter,” he urged through gritted teeth. “Get to it, would you?”
“I know. You just might want to tell her that, Harry, that’s all. She doesn’t want to intrude.”
“I think,” Harry realised, “that Kreacher is happy to have a Black heir in the house again.”
Harry laughed, “It is a bit nebulous. Doesn’t matter. I’m glad you’re alright. Please stay alright, if you could.”
“Let’s try again with a bit more sincerity, shall we?” Harry chided.
Harry gave a brief outline of their dilemma.
“Right,” said Harry “Oh, your trunk.”
—and he looked at me like I’d grown an extra head. As though I was the weird one for wanting to know more. He has no curiosity, he just takes everything as it is, he never questions anything. He’s
“Just about.”
From the closet, Lily dragged the aforementioned squid, which was really more just like a grey heap of wool with a few fraying tendrils, and presented it to Draco.
“Stop,” Harry protested. “Al was giving us both a headache, what with his uncooperativeness. He’s afraid I’ll make him reclaim memories of his mother, and I can’t blame him for not wanting that, but his hesitancy was hardly a treat. So we forgot. And Scorpius fell asleep, so he forgot, too.”
Al’s reaction was less easy to predict. It would depend largely on his mood and whatever he was invested in that hour or day or week. Scorpius could well picture his friend being anything from indifferent to furious to elated, especially when he realised what Scorpius was only just realising: If things went
“Should we?” Draco asked, trying to maintain some sort of hold on his dignity but it seemed to be crumbling with every nip to his neck.
“She’s not a drinker,” Clark mumbles. “Not usually. But when she does, she overdoes it. And then she sleeps the whole day through and is too tired or sick to take her meds and too miserable with herself to do anything else and everything falls apart again.”
"It's promising," Hermione agreed, "and I'm sure we were all spotted last night, having a lovely time. They won't want to outright scorn him if so many of us who were in the actual fray are accepting of him."
“No, I would expect not,” Draco agreed. “Seems a lot to level at me, love. The expectation that I somehow change
James flushed as he followed Draco’s gaze and yanked the door closed. “I’ll take care of all that,” he muttered.
“I’m aware,” Draco replied, face impassive. “Does that bother you?”
“Eurgh, honestly, I’m not sure he will. Dad really loves giving people the benefit of the doubt.”
“So,” Clark said, as he scooted closer, motioning to a table scrawled by hand and photocopied onto light pink paper, “Like here is how communism and anarchism are different, right? And then you can get into branches like anarcho syndicalism and anarcho communism, so there’s definitely some overlap, but I have a hard time always understanding the nuances, and some ‘zines are just like jargon jargon jargon, so I don’t like those ones as much.” He looked up at Harry, whose politics had always been “what we have is probably fine” and later, “well, not Voldemort”.  The kid was so earnest and determined and clever, it nearly took Harry’s breath away. He was also flush against Harry’s side at this point, pressed to Harry's arm, his foot knocking idly into Harry's ankle. “So, what do you think?”
Draco grumbled at the sudden stimulus and buried his head under a pillow.
“It was her voice,” Harry determined, “In Clark’s memories. It was similar enough to Mrs. Brown’s that I didn’t put it together. It was all sickly sweet like she used to talk to you, Ron.”
“Thank you,” Harry murmured, “for letting me...do that.”
“Yes,” Harry dared to breathe, “But only if you want to, of course. I know it’s fast, and also months away. If you want we could get a flat somewhere else, instead, I—”
“Sitthi!” He hollered as he approached the excited gaggle, “Where’d that even come from! I’ve never seen a capture with so little fanfare, scratch that, I didn’t see it at all, talk about subtle, that will serve you well, truly incredible!”
“And you’re...happy with that decision?” Ron asked, one side of his face scrunching up like he’d accidentally tasted something foul.
“What have you got there?” Harry asked, sitting beside Clark on the bed and motioning to the book.
“I don’t presume anything is particularly changing with this new revelation?” Draco prompted. “Just so I’m clear?”
Extra thanks to my delightful beta, Mimbelwimbel for her thoughtfulness and speed! I'm so spoiled!
“I wouldn’t let him near you, I was over you like a bloody animal, screaming at him, firing curses, but I was so demented nothing landed. Dean and Greg had to pull me off you.” Draco’s voice broke, his lip wobbling, “I thought you were dead.”
“You need to learn to take a compliment,” Draco decided.
“I’m not,” Harry assured him, “but I still like knowing what you’re thinking.”
“Yes, please.” Draco whispered.
Harry appraised them, he could feel their giddy energy, knowing they had talked themselves into coming over here. He knew he shouldn’t be irritable with them, they were just kids and their intentions seemed genuine enough.
“I know,” Harry sighed, trying to ignore the unnerving tickle of the emerald flames in which his head was suspended, “and now we can’t track down his mum and his little brother and I don’t have a phone, or a phone book, and I don’t know what to do or who to call. If I call muggle services, they won’t be able to find my house, and if I call wizard services, who knows if they will be able to find his mum.”
Her tone would brook no argument, and Draco stood at once, sharp features piqued with concern. Harry went to rise as well, but Malfoy placed a halting hand on his shoulder, “Doesn’t concern you, Potter,” he growled.
“Why would you though?” Jones pressed. “Hanging round lots of young boys, are we Malfoy? Hoping to corrupt and sway them to your cause?”
“Is it okay for me to ask about that? You can tell me to shove off, if you’d rather,” Potter requested, tentatively.
Harry looked down at his list. The teams were closer to ten players, due to the level of interest. Players could swap out with each other, like in football, Dean had insisted, it was about learning the game, after all. Harry’s list said:
“Shit,” Clark breathed. “Nothing’s simple, is it?”
“Yeah,” Ron grumbled, “because with Zabini gone to Beauxbatons and Crabbe dead, there are only like five of them left.”
Draco flashed him a mischievous smile, but then sobered. “Honestly, though, I...I’m not done.”
“A good example, a voice against injustice, choices that won't make them think they lost their loved ones for ungrateful arsehole, all that.”
“Fuck,” Draco whispered, lips parting for a rapid inhale, “This...It’s so good, Harry.”
My goodness I wish had more time to work on this story! But thanks to everyone for their enduring patience and kindness! I'm so touched by your lovely words every time!
Right now, though, Scorpius thought it was pretty damn warranted.
The conversation was perfectly pleasant, but their days apart left his hands itching to touch Potter. He ought not to risk it, with Lily likely to make an appearance at any moment. He helped himself to a glass of water instead, waving away Harry’s attempt at offering to get it for him.
“Good,” she decided. “You can sit in on bedtime and listen to a chapter of Godiva Greatstrides. I’m an excellent reader.”
Rose furrowed her eyebrows, examining him carefully.
Harry felt the urge to apologise again. “Oh,” he said instead. “I mean what? You are? Of what?”
Harry blushed again, “Oh, it’s nothing, he’s...he’s wonderful, actually.”
He looked to Draco, who gave him a terse nod, and fired off the spell, “
“Oh,” Potter looked flummoxed, like the idea of anything but marrying for love was beyond his comprehension. Pragmatism was hardly his strong suit. “So, you didn’t see much of her, then?”
Pansy shimmied, making the silver fringe of her dress dance across her thighs. She sank gracefully into the proffered chair, and Draco returned to his own. “How can you be so gentlemanly and so catty all at once?” She demanded. “My body is my own business, thank you very much.”
, which is sort of like ‘skip’, ‘pass over’, ‘pass by’, that sort of thing.”
“Then why?” Myrtle pressed.
Potter’s shuffling stance gave away his reticence, but Granger-Weasley wasn’t having it. She gave Potter a reproachful look.
“Doesn’t matter though, because Al’s smarter, I know he is. And I’ve been a shit friend this summer, so who knows if I’ve even got friends left.”
“Don’t you fucking talk about him. You’ve not earned that. You haven’t seen what he’s been through or how he perseveres, despite everything you and yours tried to rain down on him. That he can still see any goodness in anyone at all is a damn miracle and it sickens me that he’s wasting that impulse on you.”
“I know what you're thinking, and don’t you dare send your bloody stag racing off to find Tiering. You embarrass him enough as it is.”
“Wha…? Oh, Merlin, sorry, Malfoy,” Franklin offered sincerely. “Forgot you’re...a bit little.”
“How do you know which wine to get?” He asked. He supposed the question might fall under the ‘appreciating the meal’ option.
“But the Manor is a large place and we’re rarely there,” Father continued. “I could put her up in a wing, hire her some nurses or what have you, and ward the parts of the house to which she would not be privy.”
“I’m sorry,” he repeated. “I’ll watch my posture, I won’t let you down again, Harry, please—”
“Can you show me how?” He heard himself asking in a low, desperate voice, “Can I help? Please?”
this morning? Any word?”
Harry obliged, back up against the opposite wall, readying his hands to shield himself. Neville planted his feet, wand arm extended, a look of grim determination on his features.
“You’re impossible,” Harry muttered darkly, downing the rest of his wine in one long gulp. “I’ve really no idea why I...nevermind.”
“And what if her paranoia tells her you’re trying to take Jared from her? You’ve just an understanding, no real rights!”
“Faering.”
“Shit,” Harry breathed. “Well, I’ll have to tell them something tomorrow.”
“No, I could
Ron was looking bleary-eyed, the alcohol clearly having an effect. He spoke in a conspiratorial whisper, “I don’t know how much Malfoy told you, but that day at the quidditch shed? He went mental, Harry, I’ve never seen anything like it. He was sobbing, screaming, inconsolable. He wouldn’t leave your side, no matter what I threatened him with. Even Madam Pomfrey couldn’t keep him out. He loves you, Harry. No matter whatever else I might think of him, I know that much is true. And if I don’t want my best mate to be with someone who loves him, well, not much of a best mate then, am I?”
Harry nodded. “That’s something. Merlin, I just wish we could sort this out.”
“Then do it!” Lily insisted.
“Such nice manners,” Harry commented, over-sweet, “You’ll just have to do one thing for me.”
“You guess? Which part of this statement has room for guesswork? You guess it is a house? Or you guess that it belongs to you?”
In the photo, Draco had a hand on Harry’s sleeve, about to explain whatever it was Harry wasn’t getting. His eyes were on Harry’s face, though, and there was a small, disbelieving smile on his lips. He looked at Harry with a quiet, dedicated affection so pure Harry could barely stand it. In the photo, Harry turned back to Draco, who murmured something. Understanding dawned on photo-Harry’s face, followed by the bloom of a slow smile. Draco’s hand slid from his sleeve to his hand, and Harry took it absently, before glancing off camera again.
“And you didn’t think that Mr. Tiering’s extraordinary capabilities, including psychic entrapment, would be of interest to me?” McGonagall asked after they’d finished their tale. She looked caught between exasperation and amusement, but her voice remained stern. It was later that evening, and Harry feeling groggy and disoriented, despite—or maybe because of—sleeping all day. He sat in the headmistress’ office with Draco, Clark, and Karanjeet. Clark’s eyes darted back and forth from Harry and the surface of McGonagall’s desk whereas Atwal's arms were crossed again in obvious displeasure.
“Does it bother you, blokes into blokes and all that?” Malfoy asked.
Neville nodded, “Those were her words, almost exactly. Still fucking hurts.”
“With Pansy?” Harry asked, nonplussed.
was unfolded on the table between them. The front page had included a portrait of the supposed victim from Valentine’s Day, along with a puff piece about Draco Malfoy’s newfound heroism. The actress hired by Narcissa Malfoy had given an over-dramatic account of her near drowning. Harry noticed students edging closer to the eighth year table to sneak looks at Draco and make their own assessments. For his part, Draco was sporting a bashful, it-was-the-least-one-could-do countenance, which didn’t at all suit him.
“Definitely Legilimency,” Hermione remarked. She went and got her satchel and pulled out a paper and quill, “They need to increase Slytherin dormitory security, make sure no one invisible is sneaking in. Harry, have you got your map? It’s a bit of a needle in a haystack but we could do a quick screen and make sure everyone is who they say they are.”
by Balbina Bloodstone. He flipped madly through the pages until he found what he was looking for. He slapped the book open onto the table for them all to see.
“Well, you know how he risked his life to save mine? I owe him that in return. So if anything terrible should happen, I’ll do everything within my power to save him. How’s that?”
“Yeah, that. But how would he have cursed something he can’t touch? Like where would he have even focused the spell?”
Draco watched, silently berating himself for not coming up with an excuse to leave, while Potter cleared some papers off the cluttered dining room table and motioned for Draco to sit.
“There’s nothing I’d like more,” Harry assured him, nuzzling into the damp hair behind Draco’s ear. “You know why? Because I know you’ll handle yourself brilliantly. You’ll struggle and strain for me, sweetheart. You’ll make me so proud. You’ll be so brave and strong.”
“Thank you,” he said. “I probably didn’t deserve that.” Draco was already showered and dressed, looking just as neat and crisp as ever.
“Alright?” Harry whispered. Draco didn’t answer. He looked up at the dark December sky. Harry took the pale face in his hands. “Sweetheart,” Harry breathed, “it’s okay. We’re okay.”
“Ted’s sent an owl. He’s staying at Uncle Bill’s for the night. From the sounds of his note, they’ve already been at the cider.”
“Lovey,” she said. “You scared the pants off me.”
“Thanks, Weasley. It’s
“What do you think you’ll do?” Harry asked that night in the safety of
Until now.
“Beyond eighth years, Harry!” Ron cried out, “Look, Hermione’s banging away at this interhouse unity drum, and now so is the new DADA professor, so I thought, why don’t we make a bunch of teams? Interhouse, inter-year teams. We won’t get enough pitch time, but we can find other places to practice, over near the lake. We have enough decent players in eighth year to act as coaches. Brocklehurst and Rivers from Ravenclaw, Smith's gone, good riddance, but Jones could do for Hufflepuffs, and then I’ll take a team, Dean here’ll take a team, you and Malfoy here can each have a team.”
“What made you say that? Was it solely to irritate me?”
, who doesn’t? Also, I'll bet–actually no, nevermind."
“Oh,” Harry acknowledged, surprised. “Quite good, that.”
“But you don't,” Zerk observed. “What stops you?”
“Twice a day, morning and evening for two weeks,” she clarified, looking at him expectantly “He can manage the active aspect himself, but I expect you to help him through his range of movement exercises, like so—lie back, Mr. Malfoy, if you would.”
“Unless he’s a third for Ron and Hermione, I haven’t the foggiest,” she said.
turn to convince
“I am getting a bit of a charge over how invested you are now, considering I had to basically strong arm you into coaching in the first place," Harry commented.
“Hm,” Draco remarked, flopping across the bed so his head was in Harry’s lap. He picked up Harry’s hand and placed it in his hair, a not so subtle indication of his desires.
It was Kreacher Harry first encountered when he reached Grimmauld Place. Harry had been so focused on Draco, he’d all but forgotten the old house elf would be there, and he started when he saw him in the drawing room.
“We will,” Draco asserted, and Harry was surprised at the certainty in his voice. It made things feel real in a way Harry’s hadn’t dared hope they could be. “I’ll go collect Scorpius.”
“I’m not done my toast,” Harry pointed out.
"Snogging!" he blurted out.
“You’re just as impossible, I see,” she commented dryly. “But what I’m trying to say is that I’m glad you were here. We couldn’t be and you were.” She paused then, her intelligent brown eyes searching his, before continuing. “He’s better, I think, or getting there, and I’m grateful to you for that.”
Draco squeezed Clark’s shoulder, feeling helpless. He wished for the thousandth time that week that Harry was here. As much as he hated to admit it, he felt off-kilter without Harry, less competent somehow. It was unpleasant.
“Yes, of course,” Draco murmured. “What were Ilka’s thoughts on the matter?”
“I see,” said Harry, swallowing.
“Did you hear me?” Draco prompted.
“All that stuff really happen to you?” Clark asked, as he, Hiram and Harry made their way to the quidditch pitch where the Wyverns would face off against Megan Jones’ Pygmy Puffs the following Sunday. Seeing as the team hadn’t ranked high enough to qualify for the quarterfinals that Ron and Seamus had orchestrated for the league, it was their last game, and Harry felt a tug of melancholy.
, save for by barkeeps, but even they tended not to try that with him. He knew it was immaterial. It was probably how Potter addressed all his male acquaintances—a habit undoubtedly acquired from Weasley—but it was admittedly strange to reflect on the day: breakfast with Potter; shopping with his children; divulging the appalling nightmare that had been his life over the last year. And to have Potter respond with such open concern...it was
“Merlin, are you trying to out-compete Hermione for number of exams? Or do you just have a death wish? I’m barely writing half that!”
Harry growled, rolling Draco over onto his belly, still thrusting into him, harder now, hand on Malfoy’s cock. Merlin, it was so inconceivably good, the pressure and the heat of it, Draco’s short, staccato breaths rising up out of him like yearning.
“It’s a lovely story,” Zerk said quietly. “Thank you for sharing it.”
Harry shook his head good-naturedly, pulling on the prescribed clothing. “I’m sure. Well, you’re welcome to it. Do you…” he swallowed, oddly nervous. He didn’t usually care about these things, but he so wanted today to go well, wanted to secure Draco some safety and public good opinion. He was willing to care for that. Draco quirked a curious eyebrow so Harry continued, “Do you want to try and do something with my hair?”
Mathieu gave Harry a gesture of understanding and spiraled down as Clayburne zipped up into play, focused on the game above. Malfoy similarly called for a change in line up to give his spare players a chance. McCracken, to Harry's mild dismay, was not removed from play and she got in another couple of shots before Clayburne figured out where to aim the bludger.
“Wow.” Harry agreed, beaming. Brocklehurst beamed back.
“Well?” Harry asked, “What do you suggest?”
“I mean, er, morning,” Harry corrected, wincing at his own abysmal manners—not that he really knew the proper manners in this scenario. Malfoy seemed to have a great deal more experience in the sleeping-with-men arena. Until the encounter in his study, Harry hadn’t known the other man was attracted to blokes, but he supposed he’d made assumptions to the contrary based on the fact there was, at one time, a Mrs. Malfoy. That the man was not strictly straight hadn’t made it into any of the society gossip Harry was aware of, not that he kept up with such things, as a general rule. Being surprised was not the same as being put off, of course. Harry didn’t much care who people chose to shag, really, so long as the involved parties were all on board, so he was hardly fussed about Malfoy’s preferences. He was, however, still reeling a bit at his own.
“How was that?” Harry asked, “Too much? Merlin, I don’t know how to go about promoting this inter-house unity business without overdoing it. I sound like a bloody preacher.”
Harry whirled round on his boyfriend, “You didn’t!” he exclaimed.
“Isn’t it?” Harry sighed and ran a agitated hand through his hair. His intention this evening really hadn’t been to implode his friendship with Ron, and he ought to take responsibility for his own stupidity. “Nevermind, that’s not what I’m trying to get at. Just...look, mate, I know I’ve not been the most social bloke since the war ended and I’ve kept my circle small. For the most part, I had you two, Ginny, and your whole family, and that felt like enough for me. But Ginny’s gone, and I, Merlin, I think I just needed someone who wasn’t connected to her. But occasionally I’ll begin new friendships, you know, not to hurt you or because you're company's not enough or anything like that, but just because they happen, and I...I think that’s allowed.”
“Maybe…” Ron attempted, “Maybe you could tell me why you think I’m upset and we can go from there.”
Only as the moon slipped close to the horizon, threatening sunrise, did Harry’s eyes alight upon a particularly bright golden path.
“I do, too. Hell, I was finding his company positively tolerable up until all this,” Ron offered. “He’s right clever when he’s not being a total twat. But I’m not sure if witty repartee exactly absolves someone of hate crimes.”
with an address in Surrey. Smirking a bit, Harry pulled out a letter. It was handwritten, aside from the letterhead, which looked office-official.
“Sorry, sorry!” He exclaimed, stepping closer to the young Slytherin, “Alright there, Tiering? Malfoy, the toffees.”
“Er,” Scorpius replied. “Sorry, then? I think?”
Draco’s hands flew up to cup Harry’s cheeks, brushing off tears Harry hadn’t known were there. "Fuck, babe, I’m so sorry,” Draco said. He sounded pained and frantic and bursting with regret. “It's like I wanted you so much I forgot to think about...you. Merlin knows I’m selfish by nature. Or more likely by nurture, and I hate that I hurt you. I can't excuse it, or fix it. I can only promise to be better than I was."
Scorpius looked down at his watch. Five more minutes remained before the switch. He couldn’t just not say anything, could he?
It was as though everything all at once, the pressure, the speed, the urgency, everything. Draco was a mess, face red, chin shiny, so fucking overwhelmed and debauched. Harry was done for and he couldn't bring himself to mind.
“I’ve upset you,” Draco realised abruptly, obviously surprised.
Harry eased back, his softening cock tugging free of Draco’s arse. He propped himself up on one elbow, peering over Draco’s shoulder so he could see his face in profile.
“Do what?” he asked, forcing himself to rejoin the conversation.
“Like this,” Malfoy directed, “Rather not be at your mercy any more than required.”
I am really really sorry for this chapter being super short and for being MIA. Visiting family (allowable by provincial guidelines, I'm not being an ass!) and there is just not a lot of time on my own. I'm in transit over the next few days but after that should be able to nail down a bit more of a routine! Thanks so so so much for your patience!!
Stiffly, Draco forced himself to take the step that closed the gap between them, perching his aching arse on one of Harry’s knees, his hands clasped tight in front of him, refusing to cling to Harry like some cloying limpet. Harry was shirtless and the cotton of Harry’s pants ended halfway down his thigh. The wiry hair above his knee irritated Draco’s inflamed skin. He tried to focus on that, and not the billowing shame that seemed to suffocate him.
“I can imagine,” Draco sympathised. “One doesn’t wish to be accosted simply for being outside their own home.” He seemed to know exactly what he was after, briskly heading down a narrow aisle.
"Ah, yes," Professor McGonagall remarked with a flicker of nostalgic melancholy, "The infamous Marauders' Map. It was only ever a rumour when your father was at school, Harry, but I suspected between the audacity of him and Sirius Black, and the skill of Remus, it likely existed. Don't worry, I'm certainly not about to demand you relinquish it."
“Because some time ago, bad things were done here,” Mother explained delicately. “But that’s all over now, precious.”
“Not my fault you are oddly drawn to garish prints and boxy cuts. It’s like you don’t even know you have a body.”
Sometimes Clark wished he could do that sort of thing as freely as his brother did. The thought embarrassed him.
“Not until you’re old enough. And that wouldn’t work from here, either.”
With a curt nod, Clark left the office.
After showering, they went down the great hall. It was maybe a quarter-full of mostly bleary-eyed students in various combinations of pajamas and school attire. The breakfast spread was rather decadent, Belgium waffles and whipped cream with fruit preserves. Draco eyed them with interest. Harry’s eyes, however, went to the far end of the Slytherin table. Clark wasn’t there.
Harry cornered the hyperactive Pigwidgeon in the attic, and sent off the letter to Malfoy. The others could wait a bit, Harry supposed.
,” demonstrated Hermione, and the jinx redirected towards Harry, which Malfoy dismissed with his own
“No,” grumbled Draco. Another smack.
“Everything okay, Harry?” he asked.
“It’s really not,” he agreed.
“No, that’s alright,” Harry assured him. The man gave him a small smile and walked smartly away. Harry knew objectively that the man was attractive. He wondered suddenly why he should feel things for Draco and not for this man, who was so physically similar.
(See the end of the chapter for
“On your back on the big desk over there.” Harry informed him at once, “Knees up; I want a clear view. Don’t even think about touching your cock.”
Instead, Harry said something like, “Oh, love,” and put an arm around him and ushered him to the room, sounding just as concerned as if something bad had actually happened.
“The guest bedroom’s made up fresh,” Harry said, combating a blush as he thought about the reason why he’d laundered those sheets so recently.
“I appreciate you sending for me, Miss Granger,” she remarked, making her way towards the little Lum girl, “Madam Pomfrey should arrive momentarily,” she knelt beside the student, taking her pulse. “If you could kindly repeat the story,” she prompted, “I’m afraid Ramona and Hudson were rather a bit too rattled for clarity.”
“You’ve nothing to apologise for,” Harry reassured him. “Let’s get home, yeah?”
Harry found himself feeling strangely self-conscious. He didn’t have warm feelings towards Number 12, Grimmauld Place. It had never really felt like a home. As such, he’d never invested much time or money into its appearance. Much of the furniture, while once rather fine, was now just old. Malfoy would undoubtedly have
blared the headline. It went on to detail the attack, devoting several flowery paragraphs to Harry’s participation in the event, as well as recapping past achievements, just in case anyone had forgotten them. Harry blushed miserably and kept skimming.
“And how exactly,” Harry began carefully, “did you manage that?”
Another thing he didn’t mention was the letter currently unfolded on the desk in his study, the Hogwarts crest embossed in the top corner and Headmistress Clearwater’s signature on the bottom. Percy’s old flame had been running the school for a few years now, and kept a tight ship, from what Harry had heard. Or, at least Hermione approved, which was really the standard by which Harry judged most things. Draco hadn’t been exaggerating about the offer. It was generous, incredibly so: an income nearly double his current one, free childcare for Remy during the days and afterschool care for Lily at the Hogsmeade primary school, as well as a little cottage in the village where the three of them could live during the fall and winter terms.
“Oh,” Goyle flushed. “Right, yeah. Sorry, Longbottom.”
Draco looked suddenly very sad, and that wasn’t what Harry was trying to do. He stroked the other boy’s cheek, and continued on.
Draco grit his teeth, pushing back to meet Harry’s thrusts, “Your fault. Wasn’t a thing for me until you always started threatening it when I’m close like this.”
. I find you very...appealing, too.”
enough in return. I'm not prone to warmth and sentiment, you know."
Before they could confirm details, Harry was forcibly yanked back towards the potion, Malfoy’s fingers vice-tight around his bicep. “Enough chatter, Potter. Focus. Believe me, I would love to be able to do this without having to rely on your frankly appalling skills, but I’m short a couple of arms. Those seeds aren’t going to chop themselves.”
“Well. Enjoy your breakfast,” Harry said, stupidly, then wandered back to finish his own.
“Sh-Sh-She killed you,” he gasped between tremulous sobs, turning his face towards Draco’s, “she killed you and I watched.”
"Stopping you."
a Christmas gift.” He reached into his pocket which was trapped between his own thigh and Draco’s calf. He awkwardly extracted a small brass key and pressed it into Draco’s hand. “Look, I know it’s largely symbolic since you’ll basically always use magic to get here, but, I thought when school’s ended, if you wanted, you could come stay here, with me.”
“You were baiting me!” Potter accused. “In my study. You were trying to get me to hurt you again!”
The boy deflated, then, slumping down on the loveseat across from Harry. “I know,” he muttered. “I just don’t know why she decided she didn’t want us any more.”
“Now, we have more performances to come, but those will close out our evening. First, we invite you to explore our many gamemasters and vendors! What wonders we have in store for you! Challenge your wit, your strength, your power...perhaps the fates will be good to you tonight!”
“Sorry, love,” Harry apologised. He propped his chin atop the little boy’s head and began anew.
Harry’s cheeks coloured again. “Alright,” he said gruffly. “Well, if we’re stopping by the Manor, I can go gather your and Scorpius’ things to drop off.”
“Remy, then,” Jamie muttered and Harry felt his guts lurch because he wasn’t sure the boy was wrong.
“He’s told me a bit more about the, er, experiments? That he and Scorpius got up to? It’s sugar, I guess. Sugar or a high enough heart rate, either will trigger an attack. George always loads them up with sweets. I should have mentioned something, it just slipped my mind. So. He’s alright, Scorpius, I mean. It was just the sugar that brought it on, so I don’t think you’ll need to fiddle with the dosing.”
“He’s not my boyfriend,” Al said flatly. It wasn’t the first time Fife had used this taunt, and Al thought it was stupid, anyway. There was nothing wrong with being gay, not that he was, so far as he knew. He didn’t particularly notice girls
“I...I think so,” Karanjeet said, sounding just as surprised.
Malfoy scoffed, “Oh hell, Potter, what do you think. Another eager band of your righteous followers wanting to play at capture the Death Eater.”
Harry went to protest, but stopped himself. Hermione wouldn’t offer if she didn’t mean it.
“I’m certain she did,” Harry said, “Maybe she just got confused. Maybe we’ll call her tomorrow and she’ll explain everything.”
Harry laughed, and Mandy laughed, too, and Merlin, Harry thought, maybe he was getting better at this interhouse friendship thing after all.
Potter stopped her with a gentle little tug to her quickly unraveling braid. “Maybe after your snack, LiLu, yeah?”
Harry shrugged, “Only a little.”
Malfoy took Harry’s cock in his mouth again, humming contentedly, sliding, more slowly this time, along the length. It was devastating.
“Where are the fires?” Harry asked, “The ones still burning.”
“You sure, Harry?” Ernie queried, and Harry caught the momentary suspicious glance he directed towards Malfoy.
“Fuck,” Harry breathed with an air of reverent appreciation. “That’s, Merlin, that’s...
The tips of Ron’s ears pinked up and he muttered something dismissive, but Harry knew he’d been thinking about it.
Neither of them made any effort to gather their things. Draco dropped his satchel on the floor and leaned back against the solid, blocky desk at the front of the room. He crossed his arms over his chest and let his eyes course a path from Harry’s head to his toes, then back up again. It took Harry off guard, a tinge of their old antagonism colouring the gesture.
“Hey,” Harry murmured. “You coming to bed?”
Draco shoved the bit of sausage into his mouth and bit down bitterly.
“I did have that, Dad,” Jamie said, waving Harry away with a touch of embarrassment. “I
“No,” Harry replied, despite that being all he wanted. “I’ll be fine. Let’s get it over with. The sooner everyone knows how excellent you are, the sooner they will leave me the fuck alone.”
“I suspect that what the unfortunate girl wanted was for you to denounce me and run away with her, or at least beg for her to stay," Draco explained.
“I’m hardly upset about that,” Harry promised. “But
“No! Merlin, no. We’ll have dinner at his. Nothing public, you know how Potter tends to make his way into
“Merlin, I—” Harry began, flustered.
Tanya beamed, linking her arms through his and Draco’s and leading them to one of the grey, plastic tables. She sat herself between them, chatting happily about Wizard History Month and the club’s forays into what she dubbed cross-cultural education. Harry just nodded along, avoiding looking at Draco for fear of dissolving into bubbles of absurd laughter. Tanya introduced them to the other folks at the table, a couple of friendly muggles a few years older than them and a witch, their aunt, who looked just as amused as Harry felt.
“Sorry,” Harry cringed, “he’ll come round.”
“Please may I come?” Draco forced the words out through gritted teeth, naked and kneeling at Harry’s feet.
“Good evening, James,” came the reply, when Jamie reached the door. The room was small, but the ceilings were terribly high, with a wooden ladder installed so one could climb up it to search through what seemed like endless glass jars and phials and little wooden drawers. Professor Malfoy was standing over a counter, sharpening a little knife. The man was tall, about as tall as Jamie’s dad, with angular, severe sort of features. Fort said he was terribly good-looking, but she seemed to think a lot of men were terribly good-looking so it was hard for Jamie to know for sure. Usually, the man’s medium-length platinum hair was down, artfully framing his face, but whenever he was working back here, he kept it up in a tiny ponytail which stuck out at the back of his head. “Did you have a pleasant day?”
“Oh, no need to soothe my ego, Potter,” Draco assured him. “The jealousy is in the past. I’m man enough to simply admire you now.”
“I suppose it will have to do,” Draco relented.
“Of course!” Hermione beamed. “I remember getting the announcement, because I thought how funny it was that Harry and Neville share a birthday and then Alice-May and Lily were only a day apart.”
Clark’s face reddened with anger or injustice but he just dropped his gaze, accepting his fate.
The wizened elf looked up from where he was dusting an end table with a filthy cloth and muttered something under his breath.
“What else?” Clark demanded, “Like when I followed your wand up and down and back and forth and such.”
“Do you have everything?” Draco asked Clark. “Toothbrush? Broomstick?”
“Because I’m good at them,” Jared explained. “I made six.”
“Oh, hello, Professor!” one said.
“I’m going to talk to her,” he growled, tearing off a piece of toast with his incisors, “as soon as I finish.”
Draco had learned to live with the resentment he felt towards his own parents. Occasionally, he’d recall another horrid moment of his father berating him, or worse, and his mother sniffling nearby, tacitly allowing it. Those memories didn’t surprise him any more. But hearing of this barbarism enacted on Harry summoned all his anger back at tenfold its previous strength.
” he roared.
“You really should, Professor,” Albus offered, stepping up alongside Draco to place two slices of home-baked bread on the heated grill. “That dinner was way better than anything Dad makes. And that’s not being disrespectful,” he hurried to add, “it’s just the truth.”
Scorpius looked up. “I like flying alright. So long as it’s not a race or something. I’m just not...I don’t like how at school everything feels like a competition.”
To Scorpius’ relief, his father’s face only softened. “Hazard of spending too much time with James and Albus Potter, I suspect.”
, an exceedingly steady and well made broom with a breathtaking turning radius, and an obscene top speed. He’d spent many quiet evenings zipping over the brush and scrub of the moorlands that summer, any time his memories or the constant owls or conflicted feelings about Ginny had popped up. The broom was already starting to feel like a familiar companion.
“What’s ruined?”
"Scorpius showed up in the library alone. What was I supposed to do? Pretend I didn’t spend half the summer with him? He looked lost, Al. You could have invited him with you.”
many blokes so that the powers that be will sort you into the correct pile. I’m gay, I’m happy calling myself that, and it feels like it fits. If a term fits, take it. If it doesn’t, leave it. Will it make you feel better to have a label? We can hunt one down if you like, there’s plenty going around.”
He gripped Scor’s upper arm just as Scor held his, tipped their foreheads together and whispered: “I want that, too.”
Zerk cocked his head and for some bizarre reason, Harry found the whole origin story for he and Draco’s relationship pouring out: their bargain at the beginning of the year, and the stupid little errands he would run, how they ended up living in each other’s pockets and just sort of fell together. “Anyway,” Harry trailed off, embarrassed, “not the point. I’ve not been magicked into anything, is all I’m trying to get at.”
“Don’t know what you expected coming down here,” Harry shrugged cheerfully, “Everything alright?”
“Never mind,” Clark repeated. “It’s nothing, I’m sorry, go back to bed.”
The three boys scuttled off, throwing Harry resentful, anxious looks over their shoulders.
“Yeah?” Harry asked. He reached out to touch Draco’s face again, and Draco jumped at the movement, primed for another slap. But Harry was gentle this time, cupping the still-sore cheek. He leant down and kissed Draco’s temple, running his hand through Draco’s hair.
“And it will, eventually,” Hermione assured him, “Until then, we bribe everyone with alcohol.”
“That’s not true,” Harry insisted, but he knew no matter what he said, Teddy would always, in some ways, feel like an orphan. Harry still felt it, even before Ginny had left, when he thought he’d had everything he ever wanted: that missing piece on the periphery of his awareness. “If Molly Weasley’s my family, then she’s certainly yours. There are at least a dozen of us who would do anything in this world to protect you, love, you know that, right?”
It seemed to be working, Draco’s lovely cheekbones had that tinge of pink as he stripped off his undershirt, adding it to the pile. He then crouched to unlace his carefully polished shoes. Those came off along with his socks, trousers, and pants, leaving him standing, utterly bared. Harry let his eyes rake over the other boy for a long moment: the lean muscles of his shoulders and chest, pale trail of hair beneath his navel, keen jut of cock and those long, lean quads and calves, powerful in their own right.
Potter looked up at him and, to Draco’s surprise, grinned.
Draco gave a hollow chuckle. "Significantly better, probably."
to Tennyson?”
“Well, only so many places to hide a stick on a pitch, so likely the bleachers or the goal posts! Less chat, more action, Malfoy, come on!”
“This wouldn’t be in reference to your parents, would it, James?” Professor Malfoy said tentatively.
(See the end of the chapter for
He wrapped his arm around Draco, finding the softened cock. That wouldn’t do. Harry gave Draco’s earlobe a gentle suck before easing back to make shallower thrusts, aimed at Draco’s prostate. Draco grunted with exhaustion, but nevertheless, his cock stirred again.
“Yes, of course,” Draco assured him quickly, putting a tentative hand on Harry’s thigh. He was relieved when Harry didn’t pull away. “I’m sorry. I didn’t mean to upset you.”
Harry hadn’t thought that publication was exactly sophistication incarnate, but Ilka had assured them it was the best route to the living rooms and hair salons across the nation. She had explained that she'd be led to understand that "a good mag when you finally have a break from the kids is bound to make you feel favourably towards anything" and that "romance appeals to their readership." So, the day booked, Harry was rifling through his trunk in his pants trying to determine what to wear. He stood up, exasperated and anxious to see Draco fixing on some smart cufflinks, delicate face aglow and so damn fit in his carefully tailored clothes it made Harry want to call it a day and drag him back to bed.
Harry rubbed the back of his neck. He had no idea the etiquette of this situation. Walking to the fireplace, he tossed in a handful of Floo powder and stepped inside. “Malfoy Manor,” he said.

Ron snorted, “And who does, in your lofty opinion, Malfoy?”
Draco admitted at last.
“Potter’s honour means a lot to him, and it extends a lot of protection to you. Firstly, he would never share, with me, nor with anyone, what he experiences inside your head. And he’s certainly not laughing at you. Neither Potter nor I had particularly sunny childhoods, we’re not looking on you suffering through this with anything but respect for your willingness to be here, and compassion for your hardships.”
“You did though,” Harry pressed. “We’d not have made it through that night if you’d given us away. We’d have been killed within minutes.”
“Afraid he’s right,” Ron said smugly. “You’re about one mistake away from being toast, Malfoy.”
“Longbottom’s kids are at that school,” Draco offered. “He and Abbott have a whole brood of them; he’s always showing photos to anyone who’ll humour him. But I think his oldest is about Lily’s age.”
“The whole point was for this to be
and then he started to speak,” Jamie began breathlessly. “He only said a word or two before he fired off a spell at himself, I think it must have been the one Al made up, because he got this really blank look on his face, and he stopped talking for a minute, but then it started again, and he tried to cast it again, but I think the prophecies were coming on too quickly and too intensely; it was like he couldn’t keep up. So I grabbed him to bring him to you, only it turned out Main and Mulligan had been lurking about and suddenly they were there and the only thing I could do to get Scor to shut up was shove my hand in his mouth to get him to stop talking, and tell them the first lie that popped into my head.”
“And I’m not keeping them from her. She’s welcome any time.”
“But you’ve forgiven him?” Hermione asked, flashing her eyes at Ron. Harry knew his best mate was charged and ready to go off about Malfoy at the slightest signal from Harry, but he didn’t want that.
Thanks to the phenomenal Mimbelwimbel for beta-reading, and for challenging me to actually think shit through.
He’d felt badly about all the expense and all the trouble, but Harry had caught him fretting. “Oh, let Draco spoil you, at least when it comes to things you need,” he’d said. “It’s his way.”
“I aspire to be not entirely unreasonable,” Draco informed him, “I am pleased for you. They’re a solid team; they’d be lucky to have you.”
Harry heard a male voice from the collapsed corridor above almost at once.
“Neville’s sticking around here to apprentice with Professor Sprout. No idea what Daphne’s doing because she’s not exactly speaking to me. Luna’s off to the Amazon to document the mating cycle of whigglewhiffs, which I’m not convinced exist, but she's chuffed to bits about it. I think the rest of us are just trying to sort ourselves out. How about you lot?”
Clark was aggressively resisting tears as he motioned helplessly to the mattress. “It’s bloody well soaked, isn’t it? And I don’t fucking know the right spells and I don’t know what to do and—” he sputtered out, covering his face with the bundle of sheets.
“You know Professor Potter well, then? Being friendly with his kid and all that?” Main prodded. Scorpius pressed his lips together, holding back a scowl. Main was as transparent as glass, and every bit as self-interested as Al, with none of the brilliance, loyalty, or compassion.
,’ and two ‘
“Oi, Ron, Hermione,” Harry called out to the couple, who were curled up on a nearby couch.
Harry
“You don’t have to come with us, love,” Harry reminded him, but Draco just glared harder and Harry gave up, loading Clark’s trunk into the boot.
"Yeah, alright," Clark agreed, aiming for and failing at nonchalance.
Draco shrugged. “We’re friendly enough. He made some comment about how I’d find another woman after he noticed I wasn’t wearing my ring, and I said something like, ‘another woman is the last thing I want.’ But who’s to say how he took that. He didn’t exactly ask follow up questions.”
“She’s not my bloody mistake,” Draco grumbled.
CW: mentions of suicidal ideation
Thank you to everyone who commented on the last chapter. It was so wonderful to hear from you all, it meant so much to me! (It always does and it always did. Comments NEVER lose their novelty!)
Harry laughed and ran his fingers through Draco’s hair, scritching his fingertips into the other boy’s scalp.
Harry held him for a long time. The moonlight reflected off Draco’s pale hair. They weren’t dressed for the weather, and the cold seemed to bring Draco back to him, eventually.
The door to the study opened, but if Professor McGonagall was surprised to see two boys kissing in her office, she certainly didn’t show it.
“I don’t dislike odd,” Al shrugged. “It seems a lot easier than trying to be something you’re not.”
Hiiii friends, thanks for stopping by and for your very very very kind words and for being just really super humans all round.
Draco slid a hand into Potter’s hair. “It’s fine,” he said. “It was my own thoughtlessness that brought us here.”
“Nah,” Clark said, “Hiram’s waiting for me; he’s been teaching me wizards’ chess and we’re midway through a game.”
“That’s hardly gossip at all, darling. I’m terribly disappointed.” The server placed a tumblr full of some violently red substance on the table before her. Pansy gave him a dazzling smile and thanked him before returning her gaze to Draco. “Well? How was he? Still fit? Still got those, you know, eyes?”
“Fifth floor, please,” Harry said.
Before Harry could respond, Metatron arrived with a thin package of letters, already vetted by Raulo, the Latvian hexbreaker. Draco slipped a substantial role of parchment into his pocket without looking at it. Harry had a suspicion as to who that was from, but if Draco didn’t want to talk about it, he didn’t want to talk about it, and Harry wasn’t about to force the issue.
“Not terribly,” Harry responded, “He actually made a start which was a lot more than I was expecting."
“Right,” Harry agreed, but he struggled to focus.
“Hm,” Draco agreed. “What about you? Where have you been?”
“How could you betray us like this?” Someone called out.
Granger gave him a look of pure exasperation. “Of course you did.”
He kissed Malfoy’s cheek, his jaw, his lips, all wet with tears.
Also, some of the description of Lucius and Narcissa's behaviour was adapted from an article I read this week which really resonated with me. Check it out here: https://lithub.com/on-finding-the-freedom-to-rage-against-our-fathers/
ought to bear witness to it. And, besides, it doesn’t excuse all he did.”
“Quite a lot,” Hermione answered, sipping her wine. “But thank goodness for Floo Networks and Apparition! I’m able to slip away for bedtime most evenings, and make it back before anyone really notices I’m gone.”
The corner of Malfoy’s mouth twitched upward, to Harry’s immense relief. “Potter, calm down before you wee on the rug like some sort of neurotic terrier.”
“Fine.” Harry echoed, a self-righteous bitterness still clinging to him.
“I’m...not entirely sure,” Draco replied after a moment.
to fuck me?” The accusation burst out without Draco’s permission. It sounded petulant and insecure and made Harry rub the back of his neck in that bashful gesture of his that Draco couldn’t interpret.
“Babies sleep differently than kids do, sweetheart,” Harry said gently. “Remy has his nap in the morning and again in the afternoon, so he is awake a little longer in the evening, is all. I’m not doing it to be unfair, and when he’s a little older, he’ll certainly be going to bed before you.”
“Merlin, Harry—” Draco reacted with a visceral revulsion. “I could barely withstand being in a room with him, let alone sharing a body. What—what was that like?”
Harry and Malfoy were met with a remorseful Ron at lunch.
“It doesn’t bother me,” Draco huffed, feeling infuriatingly inarticulate.
“We have our orders,” Hewstone muttered.
Please see end notes for content warnings.
Draco shrugged, “Could do.”
Startled and frantic, Harry sprang back. He couldn’t name the rushing storm erupting in his blood, and what’s more, he was afraid to. Unbidden, Harry’s fingers found the skin along his jaw where Malfoy’s mouth had been, “I think,” he croaked, “that it’s best if Scorpius gathers his things and you both leave here at once.”
“Hold it,” Harry murmured silently, directly into Clark’s thoughts, “You’re doing really well.”
“Yeah, of course,” Harry agreed. “If you walk north three blocks to Maybury Avenue, you’ll reach the end of the wards and should Apparate out without difficulties. I can show you, if it’s easier.”
“I’m not sure about a bright pink,” Magnolia said thoughtfully, “but maybe a nice dusty rose.”
“Possessive git,” Malfoy gasped as Harry next went to work on a nipple, “fuck that hurts.”
“We’ll look for your mother, and if she is not with him, we will be sure to make any further necessary referrals for investigation. Your mother has a history of erratic behaviour, Clark, is that correct?”
Malfoy considered him for a long moment. Harry shifted under the calculating grey gaze.
“Oh, Jamie,” Harry said. “I’m sure it’s not that. I’m sure there’s something we don’t understand. She wanted you from the very beginning.”
“Maybe we should have this out with you on your knees,” he growled. It was more to rattle Draco than to act on any sensation of desire. He yearned for some semblance of power.
Clark nodded tentatively.
“What?” Jamie repeated, clearly confused. “Just studying, what do you think?”
“Thank you for showing me this,” Harry murmured gently.
“Harry, leave it,” Draco murmured, weariness settling over him like a cloak. “Please.”
Draco blinked again and swallowed. Then he rolled over again, shoving Harry to his back and planting his face into Harry’s stomach. He shuddered once, gripping the fabric of Harry’s trousers over his hip, then stilled.
“Yes, thanks for that, Potter,” Malfoy clipped, “is it a...living map?”
Harry stirred his porridge uncomfortably, “But I go to school with them, it’s surely lost its shine.”
She handed him the neat pile and Harry felt both like he was receiving something precious, but that feeling was quickly usurped by his anxious disappointment over the map.
Hiram looked more than a little alarmed. “If you like, Harry,” he squeaked. Harry gave him a cheery grin, and Hiram mustered an uncertain smile in return.
“Al, love, what is it?” Harry asked. “We can’t hold your attention tonight.”
Draco gave the barest hint of a smile, “Ever the optimist.”
“Oh!” Harry said suddenly, stepping back, and holding out a hand for a second before returning it to Jared’s back. “Not quite sure we’re ready for hugs, if it’s all the same.”
“Daddy, no,” pleaded Scorpius. “Let’s just go home.”
“Clark,” he said, and his voice sounded croaky and weird. He cleared his throat. “Sometimes, I, er, I get the feeling you’d like me to,” he imitated sort of looping his arm around the boy’s shoulders without actually doing it. “And I can,” Harry continued, knowing he was blushing terribly and fucking hating it. “If you’d like. But not if you don't, that's okay, too.”
Nothing. Professor McGonagall raised her eyebrows, “Come now, Harry, you and I both know that for a spell to take hold, the intention must be there.”
enjoy having to tax himself on the best of days, and clearly running through the castle to tell Jamie the news had not warranted Fort’s exuberance.
