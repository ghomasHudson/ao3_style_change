"Fine," I find myself agreeing, forcing a grin on my face that probably looks like a grimace. The boy smirks back at me in an annoyingly smug way, before placing his hand on my shoulder and leaning uncomfortably close to me. I push his face away and clamp my lips together.
"And the brooms? Might as well tell her that I'm incapable of riding a broom without falling off." He hadn't meant to say that. His voice sounded self-pitying even to his own ears. He wished he could remove the memory from his brain. And preferably from Potter's, too.
! His eyes are still closed… Maybe it's enough if I kiss him very lightly and definitely not on the mouth.
A kitten. He'd drawn her a kitten. Like she had in his dream. And she hadn't been able to bear letting the stupid drawing sail into the flames. Almost burning her fingers in her effort to save it.
Neville shrugged helplessly. He didn't really like being the centre of attention. Haley knew that. Actually, she sometimes wondered if that was one of the reasons why he had broken up with her. Somehow she always attracted attention.
Mum swallows her lemonade before answering, "Well, it's not like it's impossible to obtain a personal object of mine."
He smirked at her as if he knew he had the upper hand. As if he was so sure he was going to win. Had already won in fact.
“To passing our OWLs!” We clink our glasses together and take a sip of dragonwine. I’ve never tried dragonwine before so my drink tastes of grape juice. I wonder what Draco’s tastes like. Can you even get drunk in a dream?
Draco sighed. Then he shook his head and slipped his hands into his now empty pockets. "It's yours," he whispered, staring at the ground. He hadn't wanted to give it to her like this.
"Hm?" She looked back in surprise. "Don't you want to know… " she bit her lips nervously. "if it worked?"
"So…" After picking up her map, she quickly folded it up and returned to the chair beside Draco. "What did you hear?"
Draco hid his eyes that were starting to tear up against Haley's shoulder. Her familiar flowery scent that reminded him of Hogwarts calmed him somewhat. Wasn't it pathetic that he reacted like this over something that little children received from their grandparents every year? But if he was honest, he couldn't remember anyone putting so much effort into any present he had gotten before. He had always received what he had written on his list, yes, but that only showed that his relatives were able to read. It didn't show that they cared enough to actually wonder what he might like. Or that it was important enough to try and make it themselves.
"I just had the weirdest thought," Haley said in wonder. "There's actually something you've got in common with him."
"I also found some crumpled notes that looked interesting but there wasn't enough time to go through them."
. She would never forget how much of a prat he had been to her. But still, Haley placed her hand against his jaw and dropped another kiss on his lips.
"At least once a week," Haley insisted. Sirius snorted at that. He still wasn't looking at her, but his grin looked a tiny bit more genuine.
"Your aunt!" She accused, taking a step closer to him. "She killed him without any hesitation. Her own cousin. What kind of distorted family is that? Do you make a hobby of that?" She spat.
Young Haley laughs loud and carefree and the sun catches in her hair, making it glow like an amber. "That's a stupid reason." She replies. "Come on, I'll show you how to play. It's fun."
There was something in the man's voice that made him sink into his chair without further protests. He crossed his arms over his chest for good measure, raising an eyebrow expectantly.
It was obvious Draco had too much coffee. The way he was tossing and turning Haley wondered just how much coffee he'd had.
Now, she couldn't see them, as she was standing with her back towards them. It was an uncomfortable feeling, not being able to see what was coming… As a Gryffindor, shouldn't she find it thrilling? Waiting for the inevitable and getting ready for a figh-
"No, that's okay," Haley quickly assured her friend. "It's just-" She bit her lips. How was she supposed to approach the topic without revealing what she had seen in last night's dream?
Draco felt like breaking into hysterical laughter. Instead, he pulled the sugar bowl toward him and dropped three sugar cubes into his tea. 'Sugar Tea
. If he had a sister, she might look something like this. Only, there was no one in his family with green eyes. She could be Haley's sister then. If her mother or father was a Malfoy. Which wasn't the case. And why was he even thinking about this?
Malfoy inhaled audibly, as if he wanted to say something. But there were no words. Had she imagined that only? After another moment he took another deep breath. This time he also spoke.
"Not until you've promised you won't bother me anymore!" Haley insisted. Her long braid was hovering directly over Malfoys face, tickling him. He freed his right hand from her grip and swatted her hair away in annoyance.
, he thought. Luckily Draco's noble background allowed him to step on the ground in the most soft and elegant of ways.
He shrugged half-heartedly. "They all know," he admitted almost soundlessly. "All the teachers. How could I have kept it from them?"
"I think he wanted to talk to her," Luna mused, putting her magazine down, "But he wasn't comfortable doing that with everyone around."
happy to see him. Even if he's just a figment of mum's subconscious. "Salty or sweet?" I ask, eyeing the popcorn.
, she thought to herself, as she felt some of the anxiousness leave her. Maybe it was that easy. Maybe it would all work out in the end. And if not… well... she would cross that bridge when she came to it.
"Very funny, Potter," Malfoy growled, squinting his eyes at her. "How else am I supposed to let people know what to get me?"
"Ugh, this doesn't work," he growls in frustration, dropping his hands to his sides. Then he spots me in the mirror. He tilts his head to the side curiously. "Do you know how to make a fishtail braid?"
It was too quiet all around. All she could hear was her own frightened heart beat. At last Haley settled down next to the person. With trembling hands she reached for their shoulders, carefully turning them over.
Hello everyone! I don't even know what to say. I dropped a lot on you in this chapter, I guess... Let me know what you think? Was it just a dream? Could it be true? Is the summer sun scorching you as well?
"Hey, wait a second!" The person got up and pulled at her cloak from behind, forcing her to stop. She turned around. "What do you think you're-" She started to say but broke off, when she realised that the person was her friend Ron.
"I've got my sources." He winked at her. "Besides, you're starting to look like yourself again. And I don't think anyone is going to find us in here."
He seemed relieved as well, that she had found the words to conclude their date. "Sure, me too. I'll… I'll walk you to your tower."
Haley froze. He had seen her? With Malfoy? Next to her, she noticed how Sirius face slowly turned red. That was not a good sign.
Draco shrugged. "That spell is useful for something at least. Tell me you've read my mind and brought me food."
"We'll never get past him like this." Draco argued, waving at his injured leg and the two brooms under her arm.
"I knew she lived nearby but I didn't think we could actually walk by foot." Ron exclaimed as the six of them started their walk to where Luna lived.
"Your father!" Snape interrupted him again, halting in his steps and turning accusing eyes at him. "Does your father know about this?" His lip was curling upwards slightly, almost as if he knew that Lucius Malfoy was the last person on earth Draco wanted to know about Haley.
This was her mum talking. Haley knew it. But even without her mum's voice meddling inside her head, she could see that it was wrong to intrude on someone's privacy in such an invasive manner. It was deceitful and more than a little questionable. And she couldn't do it. Didn't
Ron stared at her in confusion for a moment. "I wasn't – I didn't – I…" Then he huffed, crossed his arms and looked away. Maybe he had forgotten for a second that he wasn't talking to her. That he was mad. Haley took it as a good sign. Even if he kept silent around her for the rest of the day.
"The prophecy, Potter!" Lucius Malfoy snarled again. It was disconcerting how much the voice reminded her of someone else's. His son's. His eyes, too were almost the same colour… Almost. They were colder. Much colder. Unscrupulous. She couldn't spot any warmth in them.
"I know what a Christmas list is," she bit back with a glare. Malfoy simply raised his eyebrows at her mockingly and smirked in that way that used to make her blood boil. Now, she found it only mildly annoying.
It had indeed been a good idea. She had to admit that. She snatched the mirror from the boy's hands and took another look at herself. Maybe she should try different glasses? Or was it possible to get rid of them completely? The girl in the mirror looked back at Haley without glasses. It was a strange sight. And it was even stranger that she was able to see her reflection clearly. If she could make her glasses disappear, perhaps it was also possible to…
Haley snorted and made her way toward the couch. It was just as comfy as the ones in her common room. She patted the space beside her. The boy trudged over toward her with a scowl, sitting down almost at the other end of the couch.
Draco was waiting in the Great Hall. He seemed bored like there was no specific reason for the casual way in which he was leaning against the wall.
"Yes! Yes!" Monty nodded enthusiastically. "Madam is speaking to him in the roses pavilion. She is asking for you, too."
"Of course." Hermione rolled her eyes. She'd been Haley's friend for years. Her best friend. She knew how to talk to her. Who did Malfoy think he was?
"B-but Professor," Malfoy argues in frustration, looking around the class room in obvious search of support. But nobody rises to help him. In fact, as my eyes scan the room I see more and more students chuckling and grinning, clearly enjoying Malfoy's current predicament. Who would have thought?
For a moment she watched him thoughtfully. "It's scary when things change," she whispered. "After my mum died, my dad became so different that I sometimes wondered if he was still my dad. But then I looked closer and… I saw that he was just the same. A little different… but still my dad." She paused, her eyes far away. "I think, if you look close enough, you'll be able to find your friend again." Luna smiled at him warmly and somehow the words she said made the heavy feeling in his chest become a bit lighter.
But then he chuckled quietly and pulled at her hand. She fought him. Just out of stubbornness. "You're an idiot."
"Or you could just let it go." Draco caught her hand swiftly, making her fingers stop moving about on his chest.
"Why's that?" He was trying hard to hide his curiosity but Haley had a little brother. She knew all about boys and curiosity.
"Ha ha ha. Funny as always, Potter, are you?" he muttered, picking at the grass next to him. He was so ready to go back and hide behind the curtains of his four-poster bed. She was chuckling again. Giggling at his expense. She was making fun of him. She was – touching his hand. The chuckling stopped. Draco slowly turned to face her. An amused smile was playing around her lips but there was something warm in her eyes. Her thumb was stroking across his skin soothingly. Calming him. He felt like purring again. But no… no… He was not a cat!
Haley stared at him, the words silently replaying in her mind. She didn't know if she could do it. Only the slightest doubt? Wasn't it normal to have doubts?
I chuckle at the predictability of his question while he watches me expectantly. I raise an eyebrow. It seems to make him remember that he’s supposed to guess. Draco leans across the table and looks down at my arm.
!" The mere thought is enough to make me shudder. "I don't care if it's just within a dream. There has to be another way."
She didn't know what to say. Should she say anything to begin with? Now that she found him she started to wonder if maybe she shouldn't have come. He probably didn't even want to
The look of disappointment and betrayal on my brother's face almost breaks my heart. I turn to Hedwig for help. But the room is empty except for me and Simon. Typical. Throwing a bomb in front of my feet and then leaving me alone with it. I would give anything if I could finally wake up now. It feels like I've been dreaming for hours. Although I've technically been sleeping I've rarely felt this tired in my life.
But I can't make him out in the crowd. He's not coming. Why isn't he coming? What is going to happen to me – I mean my doppelgänger – if Neville doesn't save her?
"What's your problem? We're best friends, or aren't we? Why can't you answer the question?" This was new as well. This intensity. She noticed that something was glinting in his eyes when she finally looked up. His grip on her arm was tightening as well.
"I mean-" She tried, pedalling back. But there was really no way to take back the words once they were out.
It was nice somehow. Simply sitting next to each other and having lunch together. Haley almost forgot that this wasn’t her friend but – well… someone she had to be wary of at all times.
"It's too bad," whispered a voice close to her face, in a tone that was tinged with remorse. But maybe that was just her imagination.
When she looked up again, she could swear, there'd been something soft in his eyes. But maybe it had been nothing but a trick of the light because not a second later his face had closed off, betraying nothing but cold hardness.
Draco sighed. It almost looked as though he would have to be the first to address the topic after all.
"Here, you get one, too." She mumbled, leaning over and kissing his lips. Although she lingered there for no more than a few seconds, a couple of throats were being cleared, making her hastily pull away.
On a different note, I need to recommend some reading. It's basically anything written by Walter Moers. He is a German fantasy author and his writing is glorious. Maybe you've heard of "City of Dreaming Books"? Check him out if you have some time :)
Malfoy didn't wait for any more encouragement. "It's a time machine," he told her, in a rather casual tone. Like time machines were the most normal thing in the world.
"He's gone," Draco whispered, pulling Haley's cloak off their shoulders. Honestly, she'd completely forgotten about Filch's presence. But as it seemed, he'd found what he'd been looking for.
But Haley wasn't done with him. She leaned across the table until there were only inches between their faces. Trying not to blink, she looked right into his eyes.
"This isn't bullying. It's just…" He seemed to look for a harmless word that better described his actions. Probably realizing that it was hopeless, he gave up. "Anyway. It doesn't matter." He dismissed. "It's just so… I still can't believe it… It's
That made her finally focus on the conversation. "Me? A crush on that git? Are you insane?" She was really crazy if she thought she could ever – the thought alone made her shudder.
Had he suffered from Haley's father's attacks even then? Or had there been… a different reason for his contentment?
She expected him to stare at her perplexedly. To start stammering and frantically looking for excuses. She didn't expect him to smile and take her hand. It was cold. A shiver ran up her arm, making her realize that she hadn't even thought to bring a jacket. How stupid of her.
"Sorry, sorry! I got held up by an old teacher of mine. You weren't waiting long, were you?" Haley heard the familiar voice of her mum behind her. She turned around. And sure enough, there she was. For once her mum wasn't wearing coveralls but instead a pair of loose fitting jeans and a wide beige blouse that Haley liked to steal sometimes because it was perfect for warm summer days and brought out the reddish tint in her hair.
He rolled his eyes. "I wouldn't actually have come of course. But… it would have been polite to ask. Then I could have declined politely and everyone would have been happy." Happy pretending that maybe in a parallel world he
"Oh, it… it…" She bit her lips, trying to come up with something believable. "It's meant to remove his memories. His memories of
"Calm down," Hermione whispered soothingly, "let's go see Madame Pomfrey. I'm sure she can help you, all right?"
"Here," Hermione's voice said, and then there was something shiny in front of her. Her glasses. She took them from her friend's hands and put them on.
"The rain. It has stopped," she added with a smirk, sticking her hand out in front of her and bringing it back dry.
"Fine. You're old enough to make your own decisions. At least you're not as irresponsible as your dad was at your age." Mum touches my cheek and smiles at me lovingly. There is so much love shining through her eyes. It's so easy for her to express her love. I always wonder where she takes it all from. I used to imagine her scooping her love out of a huge fountain and pouring it all over whoever she thought was in need of it. I'm never sure whether to be envious or whether to be glad that I am so different from her in that respect. Suddenly I want to reassure her. She does worry too much.
"Well, who are you then?" I ask, crossing my arms in front of my chest. I'm not about to let a child talk to me like that!
This was quickly becoming one of Draco's favourite things. Potter's laugh. This was already the third time today. He remembered all the times he had seen the girl laugh and smile in front of other people. How much he had wanted to have her be this open and carefree in front of him. Just once. And now here he was. And it didn't even matter that she was sort of making fun of him. He knew she didn't mean it in a mean way. Well, he hoped as much.
?" I try not to roll my eyes. I asked him two questions, didn't I? Or does the answer apply to both of them?
Malfoy shook his head. "That's not going to happen," he whispered. She got the feeling that he, too, didn't know what they had been arguing about in the first place. His eyes never left hers and the sheer childlike delight that was reflected in them was positively disarming.
The girl chuckles. "Don't be stupid," she says like she thinks jumping from towers is the most normal thing in the world.
"Pansy! Are you daft? My tea!" Draco exclaimed, barely keeping the hot fluid from spilling all over them.
"Rook to D4," Baz called across the room, so Simon could hear him in his own bedroom across the hall where he was watching over Neville. Or supposed to anyway.
She had known just from the look on his face that he was going to kiss her. It scared her a bit, if she was honest. How much she was learning about this boy. Was he learning about her in the same way? Somehow this kiss reminded her of their first kiss. When it had felt like he was telling her how he felt through kissing her. It was the same now. It felt like he was giving up parts of himself and offering them to her. As she was kissing him and pulling him closer she suddenly became scared. Wasn't it too much? Too soon? He was giving her the power to hurt him. Hurt him badly. How could he trust her with this?
"You know, if I was your sibling, I would braid your hair every day." He declares, wrapping a tie around one portion of my hair. I roll my eyes at his dramatics. "And I would never annoy you," he whispers into my ear. He really needs to stop doing that! Then I feel two arms curling around my middle from behind. I tear open my eyes.
"What was that?" The potion master's voice sounded icy, dangerous but there was also a hint of something fragile, like a spider web in winter that was in danger of breaking because of the frost covering it.
"Really? You're going to sit with us?" Denis squeaked eagerly. He looked like he was going to explode out of joy.
"Wow, that's amazing!" He exclaims, looking at his face from every angle. After, what might be hours he trots back to me, still beaming and gets seated on the bed beside me.
"Oh, just a butterfly," he mumbles and turns back to his cupcake again. His lips are moving but I can't hear what he says from my spot. I need to get closer.
She found herself on the ground of the potion master's office. Hesitantly, she looked up at her professor. "Did… did you see everything I saw?" She asked, getting up.
In the end Mrs Weasley agreed to let them all go. Under the condition that Bill and Fleur were going to join them. To make sure they were safe. To say it lightly, Ginny's enthusiasm was slightly dampened by that. But overall, they were all looking forward to getting out of the Burrow for once after practically spending the whole summer there.
Haley bit her lips. The sentiment was nice. But… he was perhaps the last person she would like to talk to about her argument. On the other hand, she didn’t have anyone else to talk to, did she?
"There's one more." He perks up, and I note that his voice seems a little deeper now. He bites his lips cheekily. "I spat in your soup when your house won the House Cup last year."
"I'm…" I sigh. I knew she would ask. "That boy I told you about. I want to… I want to confront him and… ideally I want him to feel intimidated so… so maybe he'll finally leave me alone."
"About yesterday," he whispered. He was half-sitting, half-leaning against one of the desks, while Haley's back was pressed to the wall opposite him, next to the door. Ready to bolt.
But Haley had heard them. The words. And they left a frosty, cold feeling in her chest. What did they even mean? She was so much more fun in his dreams? Was he being serious?
"Considering my own younger self… maybe I shouldn't have shown you the dream corridor." She picks up her brush again and starts twirling it in her fingers thoughtfully. "I thought you were mature enough. I thought… you wouldn't repeat my mistakes." Her voice sounds far away. In another time.
. She hadn't imagined that, had she? Did that mean it was okay? Had the boy taken care of everything already? There was no way to know for sure. Her heart was hammering so violently in her chest that she couldn't form any coherent thoughts. There was nothing else for her to do here. Snape had made it quite clear that he had no intention of continuing their conversation. At least not tonight.
"Oh." Well what was she supposed to say to that? "But… you're not in pain." She looked him over briefly, as if she could find the traces of the 'thunderstorm' on him.
"I'm not the one who forgot this precious quill in the library. I merely found it," he said, as he inspected the quill closely.
"You seem much more relaxed now," she commented during breakfast. "For a moment I thought the stress was too much on you."
The older wizard sighed. "Very well. Let us hope time will be able to heal this particular malady." Dumbledore looked at Severus urgently. "We will keep this between us for now, I think."
I flex my fingers and get ready to play the solo one more time. It's a tiny bit too slow but beside that it's flawless.
For a while they simply stirred their liquids in companionable silence. Then Luna reached for the owl-shaped mould, that he had wanted to use as well.
"How about that," Haley proposed. "We'll get started on our research and after that, you can ask me anything you want about the dreams, all right?"
When she pulled away for a much needed breath, he growled impatiently and pulled her back down, hand warm on her neck. It seemed she wasn't the only one who found the kiss intoxicating.
"What are you doing here?" Asks a familiar voice out of the blue. I turn around but there's no one there. Huh?
Hermione raised a questioning eyebrow, when she passed her in the common room. It was obvious that she was pondering whether to ask or to keep silent. Well, if she didn't ask Haley didn't have to answer. She breezed past the other Gryffindors and left the room without another word.
Haley didn't turn around. Which didn't save her because the boy whose voice she'd heard had already caught up with her.
"Can we talk?" She said quietly, cautiously. As if she was afraid of his reaction. As if she was scared he wouldn't want to. He did want to. It was almost impossible to resist the urge not to at least
Draco pulled away slightly and slowly let his eyes roam over her as if he had to convince them she was really there.
How much he hated teenagers. They were even worse than children. Children were merely annoying. But teenagers with their hormones driving them mad were indisputably unbearable. If it had been him he would not have acted in such a thoughtless manner. Draco used to be such a promising Slytherin. One of his finest students. But now his headless behaviour reminded him more and more of a Gryffindor's. A golem. Where had he gotten the idea? Not even he himself would entertain the thought of obtaining a golem's power. Looking through the notes he had taken from Draco – judging from the script someone else had written them – Severus began to wonder. Perhaps it could work. The person who had written this had obviously put a lot of thought into circumventing the problems one faced with this cunning creature. He was almost tempted to test it. Not on himself of course. But if there was a willing test subject…
"Look, I-" I don't know what I'm trying to say but it doesn't matter much anyway. All of a sudden the ground starts to shake and everything starts to blur into a formless grey mass until it all just vanishes abruptly. When I say everything I'm not just talking about the blue balloons or the walls. The colours are gone, the noise is gone, the ground beneath me is gone. But I'm somehow not falling. I'm not standing either. Malfoy is gone. And I am the only thing that's left. Not even the dream door is anywhere in sight. It looks like I'm trapped here. It's just me, the nothingness and the unsettling memory of Malfoy's broken eyes.
"Yes." He says, his lips curving up into a soft smile. "I really like her." I don't know what it is that irritates me about his words. It might be the matter-of-fact way in which he says them. Like there's nothing to it. No big deal. But it
"Well, then, there is no time to be wasted." With that and a quick move of his wand, Snape made Draco's cauldron and his little flask disappear, leaving no trace of ingredients or formulas or even the idea of bringing a golem to life.
"It's not… that I don't want you to come." She explained. "It's just… everything's so complicated, you know?"
"Stop." Haley said. He sounded so distant. Like he wasn't really there. Like he was talking about someone… who didn't concern him. Someone who wasn't worth… caring about.
"Luna did?" Ginny asked, from the seat next to Hermione's. Haley nodded, making to hand over the card to the younger girl. But before she could take it it was intercepted by Ron.
"You want to play gobstones?" He asks me, gesturing toward the colourful stones that are strewn across his huge bed. "There's not much to do in here. And I'm not supposed to leave the room," he admits sheepishly.
His face is right there in front of me and for a moment I feel like he's gazing right into my soul. I can't look away. His eyes are so warm and wistful, they make me feel like he completely understands me. I don't think I've ever felt this close to anyone before. It's as if something just clicks. And there is a kind of golden tinge to everything, giving it an ethereal glow. I wonder if he feels that way, too. His eyes keep wandering over my face, like he's never seen me before. Every time they flick across my lips, I wonder if he's going to kiss me. I don't think I would mind if he did.
"Send it to me… if you choose to leave behind the world you have known before. I shall take care of the rest then."
"Ronald asked me to check on you," she muttered, her mouth pulled into a frown. "He's worried about you."
"Ugh!" Sirius looked to the ground, silently nodding to himself. "I didn't want to go this far but you leave me no choice. Tell that git you won't see him any more. At once."
"I…" She gaped at him, before looking at her feet. "It took… longer than expected… Sorry." She apologised quietly. Then she peaked past him into the large room. "What… kind of place is this?"
"No. I mean – I – Draco – it's not his fault – it can't be his magic doing that," Haley stammered. She didn't want to believe that Neville was hurt like this because of Draco. His hands full of burns and blisters because of Draco's magic that had run wild…
"You want to go first?" He asked, offering the metamorph mirror to her. Right. He had mentioned that he was going to bring his
I want to push him away but there are ice cream cones in both of my hands. Sneaky bastard. How bloody convenient for him.
If only she'd give him some sort of sign that there was still… a chance for them. That she didn't really mean what she had said.
She wanted to protest but before she could begin to think of the words, a pale finger covered her mouth.
"They're always cold. Why is… that?" She asked quietly. There. She had said it. She didn't know what she had expected but it was definitely not to be ignored.
"Who else would you be talking about? Besides, you're the one who told me. About eleven times, I think," Lovegood stated.
Ron grinned at her, obviously believing her story. She grinned back in relief. Then Ron took a closer look at the package.
Fun fact, the title for this chapter, was inspired by the The Rasmus song 'Justify'. And the full line is really poetic. It goes like this:
"See you in a bit. I'll save you some of the pumpkin pasta you like," Hermione told her with a smile. Haley smiled back gratefully. "Thanks Hermione," she said and started to make her way back to the library.
"I don't know," he whispered, trying not to feel unsettled by the contents of the letter. "Well, I do have an idea. There was this one line… "
"Look," she began. "I don't blame you… much." He glared at her. She raised his hand to her mouth and pressed a kiss to the back of it. He stopped glaring.
"Huh?" Haley looked to the ground in confusion. But Sirius had already knelt down to pick whatever he'd spotted up.
Had the topic of their conversation not been that unpleasant Draco might have laughed. He had always liked her sarcastic side.
"So what? Look at what he's done to Haley! Look at what he's done to you! We have to do something to make him stop once and for all."
A soft crunching noise made him look up. Were those footsteps? But there were no footprints in the snow besides his own.
His feelings, his sincerity. Funny, considering that he had never been this serious about anything in his life before. It wasn't surprising really, but that didn't mean it didn't hurt.
They had fought, yes. But he knew now that fighting wasn't the end of the world. They could also get over it. Together. They could get over anything together. As long as they didn't give up. So what, if they belonged to different worlds. No one could stop them from building their own world.
Now, Haley's heart was beating like mad in uncertainty and anticipation. She almost hoped she'd find the table deserted.
." He said the word like he was talking about a bothersome insect. "She asked me if I'd seen you, since you weren't inside your bed this morning. Or at breakfast for that matter."
Hermione got up from her armchair. "How could you say something like this? He may be a git but he's still a person!"
But he wasn't leaving. Instead he was walking toward the bowl, that was lying in the middle of the hall. With his back to her, he knelt down in front of it and took something out of his robe pocket.
"Sure." She chuckled softly, as he gave a little wave and ran down the hall in the opposite direction. He really was a sweet guy. What had Hermione said yesterday? That she deserved someone sweet and kind… like Neville? Neville definitely was sweet. But… that didn't change the fact that there was already a different boy in her heart. A boy who –
And right then, Haley decided to open her heart. If Draco Malfoy was able to act like a Gryffindor, who was she to not even try?
"You're missing out on all the fun! I mean these thestrals are sure creepy. And most of us can't see them obviously. But they're more interesting than those arrogant unicorns."
"Let's go," she said, her voice sounding too high, too breathy, too nervous. Holding onto her friends left and right, she quickly stepped around the boy, without meeting his eyes.
The boy rolled his eyes. She was back to teasing him again. She hadn't even meant that but still his face was heating up. He snorted, trying to cover up his embarrassment.
Once he had reached the table he sat down in the seat across from Potter. He felt his mask settle back onto his face automatically and asked, echoing Longbottom's question,
Before Haley had actively formed any kind of plan, she was already slipping into her shoes and fetching her morning robes. She felt much too awake to try and fall asleep again.
"Why not? This is a dream. I could also turn into a dragon, if I wanted." Strangely enough this makes sense. But why would she –
I can't help it. The mental image makes me chuckle. "Simon. Why would you run away? I'm sure it would have been fine-"
"It's used by musicians. To help them with tuning their instruments. I used to play the clarinet when I was younger. I never used one myself but there was a picture of such a fork in one of my theory books."
house. He raised an eyebrow, before strutting down the hall. What an arrogant kid. Draco scoffed. He hadn't been that snobbish at that age… Or had he?
That's what he should say. What he wanted to. But it wasn't the truth. The truth was… that it fit. Even if they were dating… the Gryffindor in her would always hold truth and justice above anything else. He'd found that irritating about her. Fascinating, later when he was falling for her. And now? He didn't know what to think.
"What's this?" With a frown Black snatched the flask and the note out of his hand and scanned the words on it. "I know that script." He said in surprise, seemingly having forgotten Severus was still there. "It's from the same person who… Interesting… it might even work like that. Yes…"
"Why? What happened?" Hermione asked, who had obviously not been able to see her own head disappear.
"I'm going to finish this later," Draco said in Luna's vague direction and slipped the book he'd been not-reading into his bag. It was hard to move past her without even a glance. So so hard. But how could he let someone back into his life who wasn't even willing to take his side when it really mattered?
Merlin's magical underpants! There is a gigantic, white dragon next to me! It's not the kind of dragon you see in the books about magical creatures. It doesn't even have wings. It's long, almost like a snake and… kind of furry. It somehow looks really familiar.
Any minute now, he would turn away from Zabini and smirk at her mockingly or scowl at her or lift a challenging eyebrow.
She looked up at him with big eyes that made her look more innocent and young than ever. "I've never… liked someone like this." She glanced into her chocolate pot. "And my classmates… they're not exactly nice to me." She shook her head. "I don't think… any of them could ever see me as anything other than Loony Lovegood."
“Where are you headed?” A bored voice stopped her. The voice almost made her smile. Almost. She looked up, raising an eyebrow.
Haley whispered an almost inaudible "Mischief managed marvelously," and made the writing on the map vanish. Then she pushed her treasure into the inner pocket of her robes, picked up the cupcake and jumped to her feet. Not a second too early it seemed, as not a second later a figure rounded the corner. Quickly, the girl reached for her hood and pulled it over her face. The figure seemed lost in their own thoughts, walking past her without giving her a second glance.
"So… it looks like you had the chance to talk," Luna said warmly, handing Haley one of the glasses. A few lemon slices were at the bottom of the clear liquid. And one of the Spiral plums was clipped to the rim of the glass. She accepted the drink and nodded shyly.
Except for… several suits of armour… Haley eyed them suspiciously. Was it possible that someone was hiding inside one of them? Slowly, cautiously she made her way back to the beginning of the corridor, all the while inspecting each suit of armour carefully. There were only two left. Full of determination, she approached the first. Then she heard the giggling. Wait – what?
Around him, everyone started packing up their stuff and leaving the green house. Was Herbology over already? He hadn't the slightest idea what the topic of the lesson had been. Well, it wasn't a big deal. He could always ask for Hermione's notes later on after all. He followed her and Haley out to the castle grounds, not bothering to take part in their conversation. Why was Hermione even still talking to her? He kicked a stone angrily, almost hoping it would hit one of the girls.
The boy sighed. “We shouldn’t do this here. It’s dangerous.” He mumbled, gesturing toward the edge of the tower.
"After the tournament everything was different. He stopped… even acknowledging me. You probably remember our meeting on the train at the start of term?"
He rolled his eyes. "Besides, you don't have to know everything about someone to be able to feel something."
"You did not." Professor Snape argued. "You always lacked the patience to handle the more time-consuming potions. And you kept trying to incorporate charms into the recipes."
In true Malfoy fashion the boy ignored her and proceeded to carry her through the castle as if she were some damsel in distress. Could this get any more embarrassing? What would the other students think?
written this. Every word. Every letter. He still remembered pondering about the wording. Trying out every possible variation of
"Fair enough," she whispered. She had her own share of secrets. It was only fair to leave him his. The ones he still had left, anyway.
Haley believed him. He sounded so convinced of his words. She felt his lips in her hair and the gesture was so tender that it touched something inside her. Made her feel lightheaded and jittery in a way that had nothing to do with the anxiety she had felt only seconds before.
"Um… it's… I… I needed some air." Haley said lamely. Was there a chance that he actually believed her? He studied her face for a moment, leaning back against the wall next to the Fat Lady's portrait and crossing his arms over his chest. "I see." He said simply after a while.
She couldn't help it. Draco Malfoy as a cat had to be the cutest and at the same time overly dramatic thing in the world. How was he this melodramatic even as a cat? Haley chuckled. She couldn't stop it. She realised her mistake a split second before something white and blurry came flying at her. Fangs bared and hissing madly. It was terrifying, really. Intuitively, she raised her hands like a shield, closing her eyes and waiting for the impact…
"I remember how disappointed many guys were last year, when she accepted Michael Corner's invitation to the Yule Ball."
"What else was I supposed to say? I didn't know what to do! I still don't know…" She bit her lips anxiously. This was so frustrating. Hermione smiled at her warmly.
The ball bounced back and Simon easily caught it with one hand. "That's for bullying my sister!" He declared, sticking out his tongue.
Hermione snorted. Haley couldn't suppress a snigger herself. Ron? Calling someone out on their lack of politeness? That was... kind of hypocritical. If nothing else.
His eyes are filled with panic but when he finds mine, he seems to find something in them that calms him.
"I'm sure you will." She said extra cheerfully. "So… should we get started? Where's the book?" She plopped down on the couch and watched him expectantly.
"He's alright," Lily answered her unasked question with a small smile. "Just sleeping. Like him." Like Draco.
Haley snorted. She couldn't help it. Her mum was strict indeed. But that didn't mean she wasn't above breaking a few rules every now and then. Hermione didn't look convinced.
Malfoy looked up. "And…?" His tone seemed somehow cautious, as if he thought, she had told Mrs Weasley about the two of them.
It was only a matter of seconds now before they figured it had to be Malfoy's hair. And why would there be one of the Slytherin's hairs on her clothing?
Potter looked in his direction for a second. He quickly hid his face behind the tree again. Had she heard him? Damn, if she came over now…
"You're sure it doesn't have anything to do with a certain green gobstone?" Hermione pressed in an oddly casual tone.
Then a pair of sandals-clad feet came into view. They looked strangely similar to the sandals Dudley always wore. But compared to her cousin's, Draco's feet were definitely prettier. There was only the space of one foot between them now, but still, Haley couldn't bring herself to look up.
It was the middle of the night, when Haley woke up. Stupid. Who brewed a potion in the dead of night? Apparently, Haley's mother. She sighed. Rubbing her eyes tiredly. It was way too early to get up. Maybe she could try and catch some more sleep…
"I mean how serious can this be if it all comes down to us fighting on two opposite sides of a war in the end?" She didn't say that in a particularly cruel or uncaring manner but she might as well have. On a rational level, Draco understood that they needed to talk about this. That they couldn't just pretend they hadn't been enemies for the better part of the last five years. But what he heard underneath the words was her doubt. She was doubting
Draco seemed to be glowing from inside. His whole face was alight with something like joy or delight. Or wonder. And maybe disbelief.
side." It was clear what he was referring to. His father was a death eater. They had killed Cedric. She had to fight them. She had to fight
He got up from his seat and made for the shelf that marked the boundary between the normal and the restricted area. He certainly wasn't going to hide under a table! That was beneath him.
While she wrapped the leather band around her wrist, she tried not to overthink what she was about to do. She just needed to go there one last time. She needed to know why he was acting like this. Needed to make sure he wasn't playing her again.
For a tortuously long second nothing happened. Then the guitar started growing and growing until it became too big for the nail pinning it to the wall and crashed onto her desk. Unfortunately, the impact broke its neck. But fortunately, Draco pointed his wand at the guitar again, whispered, "
"Here," said someone with a rather high-pitched voice and simultaneously placed a roll of parchment in front of him.
"Look Haley," Sirius began. "James and Snape hated each other from the moment they set eyes on each other, it was just one of those things, you can understand that, can't you? I think James was everything Snape wanted to be – he was popular, he was good at quidditch – good at pretty much everything. And Snape was just this little oddball who was up to his eyes in the dark arts, and James – whatever else he may have appeared to you, Haley – always hated the dark arts."
"I've noticed it before, though." She replied sheepishly. She was aware of how her words drew attention to the fact that she had held Draco Malfoy's hand often enough to know about his usual skin temperature.
"No." I grin to myself, as we continue climbing the ladder. This is not what I've come here for. Before having some fun with him, I actually want to get some answers.
The girl bit her lips, her hammering heart, echoing the panic that had settled inside her chest. Shit, shit, shit. Had he seen everything? Probably. But what was he going to do with the information? Was he going to tell anyone? She closed her eyes, trying to calm her frantic heartbeat.
After what felt like at least five minutes, Haley looked over to the school grounds one last time, before entering the castle. She had assumed it would be easier to make sense of her thoughts once Malfoy wasn't directly in front of her anymore. It was easier. At least a bit. Now that she didn't have to wonder how she was supposed to behave around him anymore. Or what it all meant that the boy was doing and saying. She could focus on the important things again. Like getting back to her common room.
. "But… I thought with some time… you could try…" She was pleading with her voice, with her eyes, with her trembling lower lip. This was her friend. But how could she expect her to simply smile and say '
fine. I'm taking you to see Madame Pomfrey." She pushed him toward the stairs and in his current situation there was little he could do to stop her.
Haley chuckled, despite herself. "Even so. That's harmless compared to my situation. It's not like you're fraternizing with an evil Slytherin."
That made him chuckle. "You're so bloody vain. I love it." He cupped her face and kissed her lips, while the words casually made her heart explode.
"What?" She asked and then it dawned on her, fingers flying to her mouth in surprise. "It worked!" She exclaimed, beaming at him. "It's normal again." Her excited little laugh gave his heart a familiar squeeze. He loved seeing her like this. It was even better than the pouting.
Myron sings, while I frantically look for the dream door. The fairies and the fireflies are already gone. Damn it. I don't want to be stuck in here again!
Hermione didn't have to do more than glance at her wrist pointedly. Even though she wasn't wearing the leather band, she pulled down the sleeves of her robes swiftly.
"The moment you asked me if I'd tell them about you, I realized that I couldn't. I'd cover up the sodding truth. I'd
"I… don't know," she admitted, seemingly considering his question, "but that doesn't mean it's not possible."
"So?" She scoffed. "What use would that have been? It's in the past. How would it have made you feel? I didn't want you to feel conflicted. Or pressure you into taking my side."
"Are you going to tell us about your plan now?" Hermione asked. She was sitting opposite Haley and had quietly listened.
"For example," Haley continued. "Instead of making a pillow float, the whole class would end up floating. Or… he would transfigure a button into a four poster instead of a chair…" Now that she thought about it, there had been lots of instances like that in the past year. "What… does that mean?"
Nothing. Without her permission the colour of the boy's hair in her imagination changed from dark brown to white blond. It should have been a telling sign how her treacherous heart stopped for a second as she imagined herself in the arms of the boy that had come so close to actually kissing her this afternoon. But she couldn't allow herself to listen to it. Or to lose herself in such a ridiculous fantasy. What she did let herself remember however was the way he had looked at her before he had started to lean in closer. For a tiny moment his eyes had held so much emotion…
He frowned. "I got this strange letter this morning. No signature. And it didn't even address me. Well, if you're looking past the insults, I guess."
, he realized. A truth serum. He must have impregnated the parchment with it. Draco rolled his eyes and erased the half-finished sentence. So, the parchment only allowed him to write things that were true. Well, if that was the case…
"Drink this," Draco placed his own cup of coffee in front of his girlfriend, nodding at the drink encouragingly.
"Haley?" Ron turned to her for help. Haley shrugged. She didn't really care about the correct term for their little defence group at the moment. She was much more concerned with Luna's presence at their table. She liked Luna. She really did. But she didn't want her to still be here once Hermione came back. Not when Haley still didn't know how much the Ravenclaw knew about her and Malfoy. Or why she had decided to help her out yesterday. Regardless of the fact that her
But he didn't fool her. It sounded more like… he hadn't given up hope after all. Why would he have held onto to the book otherwise?
Was Draco imagining this or was something softening in the man's gaze? Professor Snape sat down again with a sigh.
Damn. He was seeing right through her. She crossed her arms over her chest. Stance of protection. "Are you daft? Is this what pushing someone away looks to you?" She fired back.
"I wish I remembered the dreams… like you do." He whispered against her lips. It tickled. It made her insides do somersaults. It made her want to kiss him senseless.
"So, they say," he agreed, grinning cheekily. Then something about his expression changed all of a sudden. "So, tell me. How far did you get with Malfoy?"
"But the prince was at fault, too. Maybe… he shouldn't have left in the first place?" Mum muses, then her tone changes. "So, when did it start to go wrong?" She asks, seemingly done talking about flowers.
"Incident?" She echoed, lacing her fingers through his and making him shudder pleasantly. "You mean the tail?" She grinned. He frowned.
There was a dull ache in her heart. Her parents… Had she been wrong about them all along? The stories everyone had told her. Had they all been a lie? She didn't know. But she was tired of worrying about it. She wanted to push it to the back of her mind. And instead… fill her senses with something more pleasant. Like this boy who made her feel warm and comforted. Just by being by her side. Had her mum felt the same way about her dad? It was hard to imagine… but maybe… maybe…
In that moment, high wailing sounds disturb the air. Simon is running toward the climbing frame, demanding his sister's attention at once. Dear Merlin, he's so tiny. He can't be older than five.
And just like that it was gone. In a way it was ironic. If the whole situation wasn't so serious, she might have laughed at the absurdity.
"Oh?" Luna said, raising an eyebrow. It oddly reminded Haley of the way Malfoy always raised his blond eyebrows at her. "That's ironic," Luna said quietly in a way that didn't sound amused at all.
He shrugged, looking away. "I found out by accident." Contemplatively he tilted his head to the side. "Though… maybe it wasn't an accident after all. I found it… a few nights after I realized my magic was really… g-gone. I must have wandered across the grounds aimlessly for hours, asking someone – anyone for help." His voice sounded so so far away. "Until finally someone answered. And the tree house appeared. Like a safe haven waiting for anyone who's desperate enough."
"Very well." He closed his eyes briefly, heaving a sigh. Then he gave her a sharp glance. "You should let her rest. She –" He paused, his expression softening somewhat. "She's had a rough night." It was disconcerting how his voice turned almost tender when he said that. Who'd have thought that someone like him was capable of feeling something besides scorn and haughtiness? Without meaning to, she thought of Ron. Would he ever talk about her that way?
"Did something happen?" Hermione asked, worry evident in her voice now. Haley looked at her for a silent moment, contemplatively. Maybe she could voice her thoughts without dropping Malfoy's name.
"Sirius, do you honestly believe, I made all of this up? Do you think it was all an act? The tears, the story? And for what? Just so we could have a laugh?"
They were going to make this work. He was sure of it now. He kissed her lips again and again, pressing their bodies closer, closer together until he could feel her heart beating against his chest.
Taking out her wand, she pointed it at the coffee cups and transfigured them into fluffy pillows. Why hadn't
. They also never got caught, which is why the Slytherin waited until Potter had sat back down at her and Longbottom's table until he followed her.
"Funny, for a second I thought you sounded like my mother," Draco replied dryly. Why was the thought of his mother entering his head now? He didn't want to think about his mother when he was on a date. And really, this wasn't something his mother would have said in the first place.
"The pleasure is all mine, Mrs Potter," he replied smoothly, taking her outstretched hand and dropping a light kiss on the back of it.
“I knew it was made up.” Haley commented as Malfoy sat down at the edge of the Astronomy tower, gesturing for her to join him.
"I…" She bit her lips. Incredibly distracting. "I was thinking… I've been wanting to tell Hermione and Ron."
"It's true," Malfoy admitted, "Lately… I haven't really done a lot to make you trust me but… don't you remember last year?"
Haley bit her lips. "Stop it. I know you're making that up," she scolded but the smile on her lips grew even bigger.
With that, he pulled her along toward the tree house and started climbing. Haley still thought it was too bad there was no moving staircase that magically sent them up.
"There!" He exclaimed, as he pulled something out of his bag that looked suspiciously like an umbrella.
"It's actually really easy, Potter," he said in an almost patronising way, "The next time you sit under the umbrella, you only need to say the right password and it will take you right back to the memory it recorded beforehand."
Someone came storming down the stairs. Not someone. Draco. He looked frantically right and left as if he was searching for something… or someone.
"Yes, but not until next week," he replied with a kind smile, before turning back to his own tigerlilies. For a moment, Haley watched him patiently cutting the claws of the tigerlilies. He seemed so contend doing that. It was such a different picture compared to the version of him she had seen in Malfoy's dream last night. Should she ask him about it? But what should she ask?
If Draco was honest, he hadn't actually read the interview. Not completely in any case. He'd read until the point where his father had been mentioned and then carelessly skimmed over the rest. He'd been too angry to read it properly. So… was it possible that he'd missed something? Something that might serve as a missing puzzle piece and provide him with a solution?
"I don't think I will," the boy replied with a grin, while he quickly put on the mittens. "They're so warm," he added happily.
"I can't take this," the girl said brokenly. "Seeing him with her…" She took a deep breath. There was a crease between her two brows. "I always thought, if I waited… if I just waited long enough, he would realize it eventually. One day, he would understand how I feel about him and see that we could be more than friends." She admitted quietly. "There were all those signs. Like how jealous he was of Viktor or the perfume he got me for Christmas. That's not something you usually gift your friend as a guy, is it? Or did I make it all up in my head?" She angrily wiped at some tears that had leaked from her eyes.
He reached for the hood that was attached to his cloak and made sure it covered his hair sufficiently. Then he ran after her.
"She also mentioned that you wanted to stop by the kitchens before heading up. Is that why you took so long?"
The pressure on her arm lessened. But Haley wasn't sure whether it was because of Hermione's words or whether the pale fingers that were curled around his wrist were responsible.
She'd really looked lovely today. Seeing her from such a close distance had done things to his heart, that were too dangerous to even think about. Her hair had grown longer. It went a little over her shoulders now, although it was still a wild mess most of the time. But Draco liked that. In fact he had caught himself imagining one too many times what it would feel like to run his hands through the raven locks. Or to spend hours trying to tame them into a decent hairstyle for once. Would they be soft? Would he get his fingers tangled up in them so deeply, that he would have trouble getting them out again? He imagined Potter glaring at him, if he ever got his fingers entangled in her hair.
"Apparently she still thinks you were captured by the Dark Lord and is on her way to the Department of Mysteries."
As I step through the door I find myself in a familiar room. It's a class room. The Transfigurations class room perhaps. Professor McGonnagall who's standing right in the middle confirms my assumption. The room is full of students but I can't spot Malfoy right away.
"Is it still far?" Haley asked after they had started to walk again. Malfoy seemed uncharacteristically quiet. Was it because she had mentioned her mum? Did the fact that she had been a muggleborn make him uncomfortable? If so, it wasn't her problem. She wasn't ashamed of who she was or what kind of blood was running through her veins.
"Yes! I mean no – I mean–" He sighed, closing his eyes to try and make sense of what he was feeling. The problem wasn't Luna calling him Draco. The problem was how easy it seemed to her to call him by his given name. When
"I could escort you if you wanted to," Luna suggested, "I never really know what to do in Hogsmeade anyway."
"I'm not sure," she replied, thoughtfully, "I go it from Luna. Maybe it's a lucky charm or something? I'll ask her about it once we're back at school."
Draco shakes his head sheepishly. “One of them is your favourite animal and the other is an animal you remind me of.”
"You cannot go, Black," Severus interjected. "Professor Dumbledore was very clear about his orders."
The Hufflepuff put his hand on Potter's arm and looked right into her eyes, that were impossible green and impossibly wide.
"Where are we going?" She asked, after a few minutes of silent walking. She didn't recognise the buildings around her. There weren't even shops anymore.
"I wasn't – well, I-I…" Where was the cocky smirk now? The blush that was starting to colour his cheeks made Haley grin. She could barely stop herself from snorting loudly. She liked that she could turn the Slytherin into this bumbling, blushing boy. It felt exhilarating. And she didn't even have to do much.
There had to be a different explanation! Hadn't her mum told her that dreams didn't necessarily show the truth? But what had she seen then? Had it been no more than a strangely distorted coincidence? She wouldn't be able to find out unless she went back. Unless she visited his dreams again. But what if what she saw the next time was even more disturbing? No, she couldn't do it. She would stop this whole mess while she still could.
"What are you waiting for?" Malfoy asked. He was already half-way up the ladder. Seriously? He expected her to actually climb up? They were wizards! Well, a wizard and a witch strictly speaking. Wasn't there a magical elevator or staircase or – a simple broomstick? She sighed. At least the ladder was fairly short, so she wouldn't exhaust herself.
Alone. She was alone quite often lately. One of her friends didn’t talk to her because she thought Haley was a monster. The other didn’t dare take her side in their fight. And the last one had kept a humongous secret from her for a year! She didn’t know which was the worst.
Mum's arms come around me and stroke across my back soothingly. It's extremely calming. For a moment I forget why I was so upset in the first place.
"Yeah? Like what?" I cross my arms in front of my chest. When has this turned into a discussion about my strengths and insecurities?
The next memory was only hours away. She stood below a willow tree and looked up at Malfoy... he was pushing her back against the tree… kissing her…
He almost dropped the cup, shuddering at the bitter taste. He had allowed Pansy to distract him and forgotten to add sugar.
"Ah, making sure, nobody can overhear this time. That's thoughtful," George commented. Ah. So he had sound-proofed the room.
"Well, we're heading to the library, of course. We can't come up with a plan when Hermione's right there and Malfoy watching from across the hall."
There was weariness in Malfoy's gaze as he raised his head and looked at her. "What is that supposed to mean?" He asked, mildly disconcerted.
"Of course it isn't like that," he says kindly. "You'd never betray me. You wouldn't dare." That doesn't sound scary at all. Or crazy. I want to ask him about me. But with the way he looks at me – or Goyle – that doesn't seem like the best idea. Maybe I need a change of plans.
"Or has he? Anyway, I think the only thing you should be afraid of is him jumping you and snogging you to death."
He pretended to think about it. "Hm… Probably not." She lifted her eyebrows. "Although, I'd have no choice but to
It was beyond her how no one took the exams as seriously as her. Didn't they care about their futures? Ron grunted in his sleep, using his homework planner as a teddy bear. The sight was strangely sweet.
"I was… in someone's dream the other night… And then all of a sudden he disappeared and everything else vanished as well. Even the dream door. There was literally nothing there beside me." I end my tale with a shrug. It had been terrible. I had been feeling so lost and lonely. I don't ever want to repeat that experience again.
Haley held her breath, as she slowly soundlessly tip-toed over to the door. Her heart started beating faster. Maybe he was really in there…
She should have seen it coming. But at the same time, how could she have known? Before she could decide whether she liked the kiss or not it was already over.
The next morning it hit her like a horde of hippogriffs. She had forgotten to ask him about the secret. Or rather… she hadn't asked when she had had the chance to do so. Why had she hesitated? Just because he had similar issues with his dad like she had with her own?
Hermione looked from George to Haley, as if she wasn't quite sure what to make of this conversation.
"I don't need it any more." She said calmly, her eyes starting to cloud over again. She really was merciless.
I'm sorry for the cliffhanger... kind of. Anyway, this chapter was intense, there was a confrontation finally. Actually there were several confrontations. So, what do you think? Are you still guessing about Malfoy's secret? And how will that talk with Hermione go? And why does the chapter title sound so familiar? It's from the Hunger Games but I'm sure you picked up on that ;) I wanted to call the chapter I see Fire first (in reference to the song) but then I thought this one fits better :)
, it's not a game!" Haley shouted back just as fiercely. Nobody knew this better than she did. She watched him coldly, daring him to question her. The Slytherin leaned back a bit, but his stormy grey eyes never strayed from hers.
It had come completely out of the blue. And to say it bluntly, Haley had been crushed. But she had accepted it. And she had gotten over it. It was okay when other people were around but being alone with Neville? Being so close to him? That was hard.
"Not doing that any more," she mumbled, rolling her eyes. "I don't even have anything personal from you."
Later when Haley sat on her bed and took out the chocolate frog card to have a regretful look at it, she felt the urge to laugh and cry at the same time. Agrippa had left his portrait. And all that was staring back at her was a blank frame.
"I wonder how he found out in the first place," he said quietly. Haley looked away. Did she know? "Did he ask you? Did he use veritaserum on you?" He asked urgently, his hand cupping her face gently.
"I really thought this was going to last." His fingers were slipping from her skin and before the gravity of the situation fully hit her, he had pulled away and started to turn around.
Follow her where to? Draco shook his head. This didn't make sense. It was obvious that Conners couldn't make sense of her words either.
"Hm. Maybe." She commented. "Are you doing this, so Professor Snape won't tell anyone about you and Haley?"
Malfoy lifted his hand and placed something in between her hair and her glasses. She blindly reached for the thing, tugging it out of her hair. It was a daisy. She hadn't even noticed Malfoy had picked another one.
"Have you ever seen someone fall asleep in less than five seconds?" The Slytherin asked scoffingly. He noticed that his heartbeat was fairly normal again. It was probably all thanks to Potter and her stupid pinching. Or the fact that she was saying stupid things.
"Careful Potter," Malfoy said in an amused tone, picking up the mirror swiftly, "Breaking mirrors is bad luck."
Something about that bothered her. His words somehow seemed important. But what bothered her even more was the look in Draco's eyes. He wasn't angry. Or sad. Or distraught. He wasn't anything.
"Why?" It sounded as if he really couldn't fathom why she would willingly spend even a second of her time with someone like him.
"Do you really think I can do it? Do you think… I can be a Seeker?" Emily asked, her little hands clutching the snitch to her heart.
pointy." His scent surrounded her like a cloud. She took a deep breath, trying to further sink into the smell of mint and lavender. He smelled so good. She leaned forward and kissed his cheek. She just felt so affectionate today. It was only strange that he wasn't responding. At all. Was it too much? She let go of him and scooted over to his side.
"Well, Hanna and Ernie probably for Hufflepuff, and Ravenclaw… Padma maybe? And who else is there? Anthony Goldstein.. I doubt it'll be Michael Corner. Sorry, I forgot you were – well anyway Slytherin… you don't think it'll be Malfoy, do you? I'd really hate the thought of that git as a prefect. Think of all the possible ways in which he would abuse his power! There has to be a more sensible choice. What do you know about that Zabini guy? I imagine he'd be..."
"Don't tell me you didn't bring your wand," Haley mumbled. She hadn't known he was going to need his wand. But it would really be too bad if all of this went to waste because of a stupid wand.
"And about what you said earlier, I don't want you to think you're not welcome here. Nobody hates you." Lily briefly placed her hand on Draco's arm. "I could never think badly of someone who is obviously so important to my daughter." Her smile was as warm and inviting as her words. "Will you come in?"
"Merlin, Hermione! I can only answer one question at a time!" Haley quickly weighed her options. Maybe she could answer some of the questions without lying. Well, she didn't have to answer
"It's true," she emphasized, nudging him with her shoulder, grinning. Despite her tiredness, his presence was enough to lighten up her mood.
"Hey Potter, what happened to your skin? The green looked so good on you. I have this poison green scarf that would have suited your skin tone perfectly. I could have lent it to you."
"Obviously," he replied, whispering as well. "I wasn't worrying about that." But the way he caught her hand and held onto it, gave his words a different meaning. Was it possible that he was fighting with exactly the same insecurities that haunted her as well?
Spotting his white blond hair in the midst of the birch trees, made her almost sigh with relief. She'd almost feared he wasn't going to come because of a change of mind.
"Never mind." She replied instead, while she reached for her pair of scissors and proceeded to work on her tigerlilies.
Draco hadn't known that kissing someone could feel like dying. He didn't exactly think much about dying to begin with. But never would he have imagined that death was such a sweet thing.
She cleared her throat again, feeling her face heat up. Then, taking a deep breath, she raised her hand to remove the hood. For a long moment the boy only watched her in obvious surprise. Then an amused smirk appeared on his face and he stalked over toward her.
"Technically, I can't really do that," she argued, finding her wits again. Malfoy watched her warily.
"It's gone," he mumbled. "The fur. It's gone! I'm me again. I'm me!" He exclaimed happily. Haley nodded with a grin. And then he leaned down and rubbed his nose along the side of her neck. The gesture was strange and impossibly sweet at the same time. Well, at least the boy wasn't mad at her because of the toffee.
Potter. Which was exactly why he couldn't tell her. What would she think of him if she knew he was friends with a girl that was commonly referred to as 'Loony'?
"You're right of course. But you know, sometimes you actually need to hear something spelled out in order to believe it. And I can tell you there's nothing a girl likes more than hearing the guy she likes say '
"I heard that." Hermione hissed. And just like that they started one of their famous bickering competitions. Haley sighed. As she stood from the bench, she saw a red ponytail exit the Great Hall. Ginny. Haley was almost sure, it had been Ron's sister that night inside the class room. With a boy. A dark-haired boy. But it couldn't be… She glanced toward the Ravenclaw table briefly. There he was. Michael Corner, who was drinking from a glass like it was the most normal thing in the world. Which it kind of was. She was being paranoid. With a start Haley realised that she couldn't remember the last time she'd looked for the boy at the Ravenclaw table. Weird. Only last year she'd been watching him on a daily basis.
No, no, no. She couldn't just plainly write it like that. With a sigh, she lifted the quill for the last time and wrote another line.
The boy frowned. "No. Obviously, I brought you here, so I could give this Valentine's gift to that breathtaking mandrake behind you." His voice was dripping with sarcasm.
"So was James. He was the best friend I ever had," Sirius explained. "And he was a good person. A lot of people are idiots at the age of fifteen. He grew out of it."
Draco's eyes were wide with surprise and full of questions. Instinctively, she moved closer to him. The cloak covered both of them better that way. And also… his close presence seemed to draw her in like a magnet. It was as if she couldn't be close enough. He seemed to feel similar, because even though his eyes were cautiously fixed on what Filch was doing behind her, his arms slipped around her middle, as if to make sure, she stayed close to him.
Haley opened her eyes and blinked up at the boy. A hood was covering most of his face. Was he that scared of being seen with her? She snorted. "Put me down. I'll manage from here."
"I wasn't going to hit you, idiot," he said quietly, sounding almost appalled. At the tone of his voice Haley had to open her eyes and see what was going on for herself. He was frowning at her like he found the mere suggestion ridiculous. What the hell? Now, he was a guy with principles or what? Pushing her out of a train was okay but he wasn't going to punch her?
She sighed. "I could tell you what I think," she said quietly. "But honestly, I think I'm not the person you really need to ask that question."
Haley chuckled to herself. Her godfather was clearly still trying to talk her out of seeing Malfoy. Well, if Snape told Dumbledore or anyone else, they would have to stop meeting up anyway. At least Sirius would be happy then. And what about herself? How would she feel?
Haley helplessly looked toward Ron, wondering what exactly he had told their captain. He shrugged. Which wasn't helpful at all.
here, looking for McGonnagall. Where was she now? In her common room? But he had no way of checking there. Well, it was better than standing here, twiddling his thumbs. He left the Infirmary and stormed up the stairs toward Gryffindor tower. A handful of students were gathered in front of that Fat Lady's portrait. Haley wasn't among them. If only they talked about something useful. But all they were blabbering about was some party. He was wasting his time. But where else could he look? The Gryffindors started eyeing him suspiciously. He sneered at them. Then started climbing down the stairs…
"I dreamed about them once and after I woke up I spent an hour trying to remember the exact shade of green they had."
The way his arms were wrapped around her made it seem as if he was telling her that it was okay. That she could trust him. That he was going to take care of her. Or maybe… he was asking her to take care of him? Maybe… he was just as scared of letting someone in and getting hurt as she was… He was only better at hiding it.
The boy in questions frowns at me, before continuing to speak. "After all, I don't think I need to explain to you that Haley Potter is off-limits. I can't make an exception for you, Goyle," he concludes, sounding almost sad. What the heck?
Draco fought the urge to ask which side he considered as the winning side and nodded his head instead. "I see."
Not even a minute later the basket came soaring through the air with a light blue blanket neatly folded on top of it. After clearing her throat pointedly, she handed it to the boy.
"So," mum takes a step toward me and touches the patch of skin between my furrowed brows. My face relaxes almost instinctively. She smiles. "Why do you want to look intimidating?"
"Your friends! They're coming!" Luna told them breathlessly. Haley gazed from the Ravenclaw to the Slytherin in shock. It was too late for him to get out.
." There weren't any signs of dishonesty on her face. Her gaze was clear, unwavering and urgent. Was this… the truth?
"Pumpkin cinnamon rolls!" She exclaimed, inhaling the rich cinnamon aroma. There was a note that had been beneath the bundle.
!" He pointed his wand at Draco, summoning a huge pumpkin that encased his head. He'd used that jinx countless times on other people, never knowing how claustrophobic it actually felt. It didn't hurt. But it was anything but pleasant to have your head trapped inside a gigantic pumpkin.
The girl shook her head. "I've got to go," she muttered breathlessly, her eyes still glued to the words. They were just as horrible as the ones in the first letter.
"S-sure," he said, taking a tentative step inside and then walking more confidently. After a little moment of looking around awkwardly, he sat down across from Haley and Neville, next to Luna.
Haley wasn't sure whether to feel endlessly embarrassed or relieved. Those messy, incoherent letters she wrote? He'd gotten them?
She looked up at Draco in a way that seemed so innocently curious that it made him want to squeeze her or jump around in circles or do anything equally ridiculous. It wasn't so much the expression itself that made him almost giddy with joy. It was more the lack of animosity. Or the fact that he was here in Hogsmeade with Haley Potter and he was holding her hand and they were on a bloody
Fred stopped at Ginny's bed, which was opposite Haley's and looked at something in his sister's hands.
"Exactly. And in order to defend you also need someone who does the attacking first. So, basically a duelling club."
"Tonks' mother made this?" She asked, quietly. The needlework was truly beautiful. From what she could see.
"Nothing new? What do you mean by that? Did you… did you know?" She asked, replaying the events of this morning in her mind. He had been acting so weird with the handkerchief. Like he had been trying to lead his brother onto the wrong track on purpose… But why? It didn't make any sense.
People ran away, fired spells at each other and cried out in general. It was a single chaos. At some point his head was hit with something – a jinx? – and he was freed from his pumpkin prison at last. He sneaked into Umbridge's office right behind the witch herself, not knowing what to expect.
"Yes. I was pretty devastated for a long time." Luna admitted. "But then I thought… mum wouldn't want me to stop smiling. She'd want me to go on living. I think… my dad realized that, too. One day, he just picked me up and took me to go look for thestrals in the woods. It was the first time he smiled again."
Draco slowly took a seat. The man wasn't giving anything away either. With a flick of his wand he made the door fall shut and did something else. Lock it, perhaps? Now, he was starting to feel worried.
. But somehow she found she didn't want to argue right this moment. She wanted to let herself be comforted. She was so tired of always having to be the strong one. The Chosen One.
"He kind of… spilled his heart to me after Michael ditched me at the Yule Ball." Her hand wandered to her shirt, touching something that was underneath it. A necklace? Hermione had always wondered what had happened with Michael Corner that night.
"Neville, wait!" She called after him, catching him at the doors. "Is that yours?" She asked, showing him the little ball.
Draco's throat was tightening up. He didn't know how it was possible but Luna Lovegood somehow managed to be incredibly peculiar and innocently sweet at the same time. He felt the strange urge to hug her. Which he suppressed. He wasn't that far gone. Something about her words bothered him though.
"Yeah, um… stupid book." She sounded strangely nervous. She never sounded like that. Draco had to put in a major effort not to look at her. Siren Mark. Look at the Siren Mark…
Only a few doors further ahead I can spot my own door and the roses and tendrils that surround it. Before I can reach it my eyes catch on another door.
And Luna… Ron tried to think of a useful spell to free her from her own captor but the girl sort of slowly ducked out under Warrington's arms, giving him a smile and whispering an incantation that made his eyes droop and him fall asleep at once. Ron blinked. Impressive. It seemed, she knew how to defend herself.
"I… It's just… you know… the thing is–" Haley didn't know how to explain without giving anything away. And really, it wasn't her story to tell.
Draco smirked. "Well, it's not my fault you're that distracting." He dropped another kiss on her lips, almost making her forget her point. Why did his kisses always feel so damn amazing?
about the girl," the man's face blanched. Which was strange seeing as his normal complexion was already rather pale. "You wouldn't be
“Why didn’t you tell me?” She asked quietly. “I can’t believe you’ve known all this time and you didn’t tell me!” Now the anger was surfacing at last.
"It's nothing," she whispered, suddenly aware of how close their faces were. It seemed like Malfoy noticed it as well. His eyes were wandering over her face like he was trying to commit each little detail to memory.
"I'm not harming him," she answered. "I'm more than careful. I might as well be treating him with kid gloves!" And then it hit her. She
"Hedwig!" I yell in exasperation. I can't believe this. She is flying with her back to the ground now. And her soft chuckling tells me that this is purely intentional.
"You don't mind that they're mittens, do you? I only started knitting recently so I couldn't make them with separate fingers…" Haley admitted sheepishly.
"I want to help you. But I can only do that if you let me." He threw up his hands in frustration. "You're not the only one who's not okay, you know? My father is going to prison. Do you think I'm happy about that?"
Pressed against his chest, she could feel the urgent thumping of his heart close to her ear. And then he said it, softly like a caress. "I'm so in love with you."
"If he doesn't remember me, he won't have a reason to harass me, right?" The explanation actually sounded plausible to her own ears.
All the precious memories she had made over the last term flashed through her mind like she was watching a film. Some of them were achingly sweet… while others filled her with regret… but none of them failed to remind her of the promises she'd broken.
"I couldn't decide, which one I liked better," she said, pouting her lips in a way that was unfairly irresistible. She was too cute. How was that possible?
"You're saying all that. You're using all these nice words but… in the end…" Haley took a deep breath, "In the end you still haven't explained. Anything." She concluded, focusing her eyes on the ceiling above her now.
He waited for an answer but the girl wasn't answering. She simply kept grinning at him. Then she opened the clasp that was holding her cloak together and removed it from her shoulders. Draco froze. His heart beat sped up considerably. Why was she undressing herself? Did she-? Did she want to-? Did she think this was what he wanted? Right here on top of the astronomy tower? His cheeks felt uncomfortably hot all of a sudden.
She was walking away from him again. He hated watching her go. So, he decided he wouldn't. Not this time. With no more than three steps he had reached the girl and stopped in front of her.
The boy seemed to consider her for a moment. Then he chuckled to himself. "Yeah right." He spread out his arms in a gesture, suggesting an invitation. "Let's hear it then. Let's hear one of the scandalous things you have seen in my mind," he challenged. This was the moment. Should she tell him that she knew about his crush right now? Or would it be better to start with something smaller?
What the hell was going on in there? Draco was just about to storm into the bath room and curse who ever was in there with Potter inspiring her to say these ridiculous things. He stopped himself in the last moment though. There couldn't be anyone in there with Potter. He had checked earlier and there hadn't been anyone else since then. Besides, the stupid Gryffindor had probably only checked, if she was alone in the room.
Haley's hand clenched to an angry fist. But she forced herself to stay calm and not raise to his bait. She had a plan after all. Even if the outcome was more than uncertain.
"Right on time," commented Hermione, "I don't want to be late for Care of Magical Creatures. The teachers are all mentioning useful bits about the OWLs now."
. The embroidered letter looked different from the rest of the cloth. And there were also a few flowers that seemed like they were a different kind of fabric.
"Shit, shit, shit," she whispered frantically, pressing her hands against her face. "It wasn't real. It was just a dream," she tried to convince herself. But there was no use. It hadn't felt like a dream. It had felt much more real. She even remembered what he had bloody smelled like! (The woods, mint and lavender.)
Haley just watched him for a quiet moment, seemingly looking right at everything that was hidden below the surface. Maybe she realised that he hadn't said that to provoke her but that there was a different intention behind his words.
"I think…" Lily began, biting her lips to keep herself from grinning, "I'm going to tell you a story."
seems to work like a charm. How dare he? I regain control over my body and push him away. He stumbles a few steps backwards and looks at me, his eyes full of confusion and disbelief.
"What were you doing then?" She asked playfully, one corner of her mouth was tilting upwards slowly.
"I didn't know stupidity was a Gryffindor trait," Malfoy mocked her. The git. But she wasn't about to back down so easily.
Luna looked over toward the trees thoughtfully. "I think… that's something you should ask him yourself."
Haley wondered what this fresh new promising Thursday was going to bring. It seemed that everything was possible. Suddenly, spring was in the air and there was a bright glow about the whole castle. Not even the Creeveys annoyed her. Much. She even found their current topic in History of Magic interesting (something about a group of magicians who invented the branch of culinary magic). Or less boring than usual. After the lesson was over, she got ready to have lunch with her best friends. Maybe it was even warm enough to eat outside? That would be nice.
"You know, you said you wanted to bring some colour to the castle. So, I thought maybe you would like to practise." His eyes flick toward the corner where the cabinet was located just a moment ago. In its place there is an array of paintbrushes and creamy acrylics. Usually, I prefer watercolours but… the suggestion makes me smile.
"Lonely?" Haley pulled her hands free and crossed her arms. "You'd abandon me because my voice sounds peculiar?"
"It's possible." He drummed his fingers on the table restlessly. "But then, who could have sent it? Who else knows about her and me?" He doubted that the potions master had sent the letter. Snape would have sought him out directly.
The potion master seemed taken aback for some reason. Something flickered in his dark eyes like surprise or… maybe a distant memory?
"This is a library! How dare you disturb the peaceful silence with these dirty words!" Madame Pince shrieked. She had appeared out of nowhere and only seconds later she shooed them almost violently out of the library.
"Let go!" The boy ordered, jerking out of Snape's grasp. He would not allow the man treating him like some… marauder. With a sneer he reached for the door handle and pushed down the–
Draco snorts. "Now you really have a pig nose." He presses his finger against my nose lightly to emphasise his point. I swat it away in annoyance. "Stop that," I say but he's laughing now. Earnestly. I don't think I've ever seen him laugh before. Not like this. Carefree and open. It's contagious. So, I join in, leaning back against the wall to steady myself.
"Man, I'm hungry! I never thought this whole prefect thing would be this – Hermione, why'd you stop walking?"
"And you are?" The familiar voice of Myron Wagtail questions in a bored tone. I quickly envision the hood I covered my face with the first time I was here.
. As he started to fall to the ground from roughly ten metres above the pitch, a whispered "No", slipped from her lips. When he landed on the ground with a sickening
Then his twin brother dropped onto the couch next to Hermione who had been trying to keep Ron from copying her essay.
which she was now holding in her hands. It was really handy. Besides showing the outlines of the whole castle and its secret passages, the map also showed the castle's inhabitants and their whereabouts. She only had to whisper the name of the person she was looking for and a blinking light appeared above the dot with that person's name. Super easy.
"Good," Draco whispered, as he let his hand rest on top of Haley's. It was so small. But it felt pleasantly warm in his own hand.
"That's a brilliant plan," He says. I'm not sure if he's mocking me. "Are you hiding any other optimistic ideas like becoming headmaster? Or getting rid of classes?"
It would only be suspicious if he kept arguing the point. "All right." He said. Maybe he'd get a chance to follow them.
"What about him? Did he ruffle your feathers again?" Hedwig asks and before I can think of an answer she starts to laugh. "That's a funny expression, really," She adds, once she has calmed down a bit. Who would have thought that Hedwig had a fondness for lame puns. But wait… what did she say just now?
Quickly, she made for the chimney and knelt down in front of it. The floo powder was to her left. She grabbed it and hastily threw a pinch of it into the flames, making them turn green. So far so good. What now? Did she simply stick her head into the flames?
He's painted a girl. A girl in green Slytherin robes that accentuate her green eyes which seem to sparkle even though this is just a painting. Her hair is a shiny mix between red and brown and it's framing her face in soft waves. She's beautiful in a fierce way. She might be on fire. Or electrified. I want to be her. No, I want to be with her. She gives off an aura that combines strength and kindness in a way that makes her desirable and lovely. I'm so jealous of this girl.
the doors to the potions class room opened and Snape entered, his robes billowing behind him like a cape. The Gryffindors and Slytherins followed him quickly.
Haley silently kept munching on her sandwich. What would be a fitting response? She wondered how her new confident self would act. "Turns out, he's quite the kisser."
Before he got the chance to do anything about it, she had already left the library. Draco was fuming. And with Potter gone there was only one other person sitting at the table. Longbottom. Draco chuckled coldly.
"If you stop bothering me I'm going to…" She made a dramatic pause for effect. Malfoy rolled his eyes. "I'm going to keep your secrets."
"It'll be fine." He says and pulls the face-thief into his arms. "I'm here," he soothes, rubbing her back gently. Does he believe he can heal her with his mere presence? How can he be so gentle with her? How can he be so caring when he dreams and be a nightmare in real life?
! Do you think I won't hurt you just because I can't use my wand?" He grabbed one of the ice cream bowls from the table and hurled it against the wall. It was the strawberry one, leaving sad pink streaks of ice cream on the wood.
"Maybe there is a way for you to see her, that doesn't endanger either of you. My mother always said 'If there is a will, there is a way'."
I'm sorry, this is so angsty and dramatic... I promise there will be some more fluff and fun stuff in the next chapter!
. Right. She had told Ron and Hermione she was dating him but… but… she had just said that because Hermione had driven her into a corner.
"We don't have the time for that! Haley needs us now!" Black protested, twirling his wand between his fingers.
"Please… Draco." Said Haley's voice. He groaned. Now he was even hallucinating. Or was he? Slowly, he blinked open his eyes. There she was. Glancing down at him out of wide worried eyes. Worried? About him? Now he was definitely hallucinating.
"Ron! Wait a second!" Hermione called. Haley didn't dare look at her. She was too scared of what she might find on her friend's face.
She accioed their broomsticks for what she hoped was the last time and squashed them between her left arm and her side. It took a lot of effort not to just leave the stupid Firebolt behind.
Draco sneered. "Exactly, what were you expecting?" He smirked, his voice sounding the least bit curious. Granger lifted an eyebrow. She seemed to be contemplating whether it was worth it to stay and listen to him or whether to leave straight away. He couldn't really blame her. There were a lot of places he'd rather be at in that moment. Or people he'd rather talk to. If she wasn't Haley's friend he'd never even bother.
A crunching noise had interrupted her. It sounded like someone was stepping on twigs. But there was something else as well. From the opposite direction…
Wow, that helps a lot. Well, it actually helps a little bit. "Little Prince?" I ask confusedly. Mum nods toward my painting. I snort. Paint-Draco does look similar to the little prince from that French story.
Luna only stared at him. With those huge blue eyes that were nothing like Haley's. But they were familiar. Patient. Kind. Expectant. Expectant?
He rolled his eyes. "I'm not the one blowing up shit with magic." Was that a dig at Neville? He sighed. It was probably just nerves.
"Well, anyway," Haley interrupted, feeling the familiar beginnings of an argument in the air. "There won't be a meeting tonight. We'll let you know once we've decided on the time like always."
Draco snorted. "You're awfully confident for someone who just lost a quidditch game. Against Hufflepuff."
He took the blanket and unceremoniously dropped it onto the grass. Where it unfolded by itself like some super magic blanket. If it was also capable of flying she'd really be impressed.
"Maybe... I guess," she mumbled, "I did say I was going to give you four weeks – well three weeks now. But I always keep my word so..." She trailed off and shrugged. Had she said something wrong? Malfoy wasn't reacting at all. He just stared at her, the expression on his face frozen. It seemed almost like somebody had cast a full-body-bind on him. Haley frowned. There. He had blinked. And his lips were definitely twitching slightly.
are not real journalists. They're getting paid for making up stories." She tilted her head to the side. "I thought everyone knew that."
. Those had been the words of the Fat Lady. And Professor Snape's story had also been about a Gryffindor and a Slytherin. Assuming Snape was the Slytherin… Who was the Gryffindor? He flicked further back to the Gryffindor house.
It had been the wrong thing to say. There was the flicker of pain again. "Right." He said then, contemplatively. "Who needs that? I've got you, my personal house elf." The way he said that made it sound like a challenge. Or a test.
"There was… a spell." His voice began to tremble, only a bit. Haley almost didn't notice it. "I found it in an old potions book. '
He wasn't asking where she was going to spend Christmas. To be honest, she didn't even know herself yet. But it would be nice if she could spend it with Sirius and everyone else. Malfoy seemed to be nervous about something. His fingers were tapping against his leg restlessly and he kept glancing over at her like… he was waiting for something? But what could he be waiting for? Was he going to steal her cloak? Well, she had to admit that it wasn't all that cold any more, now that the wind had receded.
“What are you doing in the fifth year dorm?” She asked sweetly. She was forcing down the urge to throw her pillow at the girl.
Hi everyone! It's been a while, sorry. My only excuse is that I'm terribly stressed at the moment. Hopefully, things will calm down soon... Anyway, look at all these feelings that are starting to make things complicated. I'm super excited for the next chapter when we'll finally go back to dreamland again :) Btw, Ron and Hermione are idiots :D Wonder when they'll get it together. Leave me your thoughts! Thanks for reading!
And just like that Neville was hit with a spell that made it impossible for him to stand, let alone walk.
He was floating. This was what sand grains felt like, whirling around, taken up by a breeze in the desert.
Draco glared at her. She was too cruel. Would it have killed her to at least pretend she was a little jealous?
Haley sighed but invitingly gestured toward one of the armchairs nonetheless. It wasn't him who had potentially messed up her boyfriend. He'd only embarrassed her by playing the rude little brother card.
"And finally," Sirius said, pushing his goddaughter slightly away so he could look into her eyes. "I want you to think about whether you're really sure about this. About him. You know, as well as I do that his father is a Death Eater. He's a dangerous man and if you ever," he paused, his grey eyes full of urgency, boring into her green ones like he was trying to look into her soul. She swallowed nervously. "If you ever feel only the slightest doubt about him or his intentions, you can't hesitate. You have to end it immediately. Do you understand?"
"I have no idea what you're talking about," Haley mumbled, as she, too vanished through the barrier. It was a shame how well her dad knew her. She had been learning from the best after all. He had been the one to teach her all the tricks.
"You stole his book about the water plants! Neville said, he had lost it, but… that was actually you, wasn't it? You found out about the gillyweed through Neville's book!"
She didn't even have to ask it seemed. Hermione was already eagerly going through the pages. With any luck it was going to distract her from doing research on the matter she'd shared with her yesterday. It really was enough if one person worried herself to madness about it.
"Probably the girl's bathroom on the second floor. Nobody uses it. Ever. Because of that insufferable ghost."
"Hm." The girl nodded but in the way her eyebrow was slightly raised, he could see that she wasn't convinced.
"So, does this mean you forgive me?" He sounds so eager. But I can't let him off this easily. It's much easier not to be charmed by him now that he doesn't look like a child any more.
When Draco lifted his finger, the petal stuck to it, clinging to his skin, like the lifeless wing of a butterfly.
It reminded her of falling somehow. Scary. But exhilarating at the same time. She'd felt that way in Hedwig's dream, when the owl had pushed her out of the window. But she hadn't fallen for long. She'd landed softly on the back of a luckdragon. Of course, she hadn't known that from the beginning. But the uncertainty offered a certain thrill, if she was honest.
She tapped a finger to her chin thoughtfully. "Or more like… I won't tell everyone about your darkest secrets."
So Haley stopped to think. And instead let herself enjoy being kissed by Draco Malfoy. Two figures in the night, almost invisible against the dark moonlit sky.
"If you say so," mum replies, letting go of my hair. "But… just so you know, if you have questions or if there is anything you don't understand, just ask me. Dreaming is my speciality!" She exclaims while flying upwards in a spiral. She looks like a ballerina. With dragon wings. This is so surreal.
This was not what Haley had thought her first real kiss was going to be like. Whatever she had expected it was certainly not this: Spread out on a picnic blanket with Draco Malfoy. Well, the picnic blanket was not the unusual part. It was a rather comfortable picnic blanket.
"I can't promise that it's going to work this time," she said quietly. "But… my mum is one of the most talented witches I know. If there's anyone who can find a way, it's her." Slowly, she touched the back of his hand with her fingertips. He didn't pull away. "I think… it's worth a try. But if you really don't want to…" She took a deep breath. "I'll let it go."
"You're much prettier than I remember you," Rita commented, her colourless lips turning into an interested smile. "I didn't think you were the dress type, honestly. Unless," her fingers were crawling over to her crocodile leather bag. "Might you be going on a date?"
She couldn't let anything happen to them. Any of them. All because she couldn't discern a nightmare from reality…
Haley couldn't be sure what happened then. But an undefined amount of time later, she was in her room upstairs, sitting by the bed, where Draco was soundly asleep.
Over breakfast Haley kept feeling Hermione's eyes on her. She waited for the girl to stop but when she continued staring at her, Haley threw her spoon down, splashing milk and cornflakes around her. "What is it?"
"Don't worry so much." Mum says squeezing my arm. "I'm sure the little prince cares about you a lot as well. That's probably the reason he got so mad in the first place."
Haley nodded. "Yeah, everyone was busy preparing for the Yule Ball and the git had nothing better to do but annoy the hell out of me! He almost ruined Neville's dress robes!" Neville had been her date for the Yule Ball.
He chuckled, sliding his free arm loosely around her waist. "After I lost my magic… I was in a really dark place, you know?" He lightly shook his head, as if the memory still bothered him and he was trying to dispel it. "Nothing mattered. I wanted it all to stop. There was no meaning… I wanted to give up… I… It wouldn't have taken much for me to do it. To just… fade away completely."
Draco almost growled. He could have strangled her. If his hands weren't occupied with the girl in his arms.
, he thought, wondering what she would do, if he actually said that. The girl smiled, as she cuddled closer to him. Had she heard his thoughts? Maybe she could feel it. Maybe it was as simple as that.
, Haley thought to herself. Was it possible for them to have even one conversation without either of them raising their voice?
"No!" Draco yelled, jumping to his feet and slapping his head in frustration. "You're not allowed to even think that!"
"What?" She replied tiredly. What was that supposed to mean? What were they even talking about any more? She didn't know. Helplessness was weighing her down. Why did all of this have to be so complicated? Why couldn't things be easy for once? Had the room been this cold from the beginning? There was an unfamiliar distance between them. Similar to that time in fourth year when Ron had been mad about the goblet of fire choosing her. Was she losing him? Over a boy and a chocolate frog card?
"I'm starving," Haley said as she got up and walked over toward the portrait hole. Hopefully she wouldn't run into Malfoy on the way to the Great Hall again.
Haley sighed. For a short moment she had thought she was getting somewhere. But now there were even more questions whirling around in her head. What did Neville know about Malfoy? And why had the Slytherin glared at her friend like that?
He raised a mocking eyebrow. "I'm sure we both agree now that you have had your fun toying around with the girl, we can all move on and forget this ever happened." He massaged his forehead, as if he was fighting a migraine.
"Hey!" Haley exclaimed, reaching for the note but her godfather was holding it out of her reach and reading hastily.
"Hm." Professor Snape hummed thoughtfully. "I wonder… have you noticed anything else unusual about Longbottom?" He didn't sound accusative at least. Just… curious.
Something softened in her godfather's eyes. He placed his hand on top of her shoulder gently. "I know you're at that age where you think nobody gets you and then there's that one person who seems to understand you and you have all these feelings and you think it's going to last forever." He bit his lip. There was something sad and wistful in his eyes. "But Haley, you have to understand these are
"No!" Draco thundered. Haley heard something shatter, before she saw the flower pot hit the ground. She flinched in surprise. "No, no, no! How could you?" His face was a mask of betrayal and disbelief. "How could you do this to my family? How could you do this to
Haley took the fork from his fingers and examined it for a moment. It was made from some kind of metal but apart from that she had no idea what it could be.
"Prat," she hissed, dropping sideways and letting her head fall into his lap. "Don't mind me. I'm just taking a quick nap."
Then he watched the blonde girl – Luna? – help another one mount the invisible thing like someone would mount a horse… Were those invisible things… thestrals?
Dear Merlin, I can't believe this is almost over! So, I hope the happy vibes are to your liking, everyone. After all the angst... these children deserve some happiness. Although Draco is a bit of a brat, isn't he? Let's hope James spares his life.
"I – I –" he stammers, his eyes wide open, "I – I – I can't." Wait. What? I tilt my head to the side in curiosity.
. If she wanted to make it less obvious she would have to tell her to leave out at least two names. But who should she choose? If she was honest with herself, she didn't want to let off even one of them. They were Death Eaters. They deserved to be called out on their actions. They had killed innocent people. They hadn't even blinked at the sight of Cedric's dead body. They would have laughed if it had been
The boy frowned. There was something serious in his eyes. "There's no need to rush," he said quietly, his fingers drumming against the caramel coloured bottle. "After everything I've put you through I… want to do this properly."
It's a sight that warms my heart. I wonder if he believes it now. That this is a dream. I don't want to tell him. Not when he looks that happy.
There was so much uncertainty and conflict in Haley's eyes. Honestly, that admission made so much sense – from a Gryffindor perspective. But what was much more important was that her words warmed him, melting away the last remnants of uncertainty and hurt that had settled in his chest.
Hermione's hazel eyes were flitting back and forth between the gobstone bracelet and Haley in suspicion.
"I do," he replied quietly. "But I… would you mind if… just the two of us?" That wasn't even a complete sentence.
The girl bit her lips but the smile came through anyway. "I told you. It's special wool that keeps your fingers extra warm." Looking at the boy who seemed so delighted over a pair of knobbly mittens, Haley felt a warm pull in her stomach and a sudden desire to keep seeing that expression on his face. She liked being the one who put it there.
"When was that?" The boy whispered. "What did you see?" His breathing had quickened considerably. She could feel his eyes on her, but was too scared to look at him.
For a second Ginny looked, like she wanted to say something, but Michael had already got up from his seat.
He scrunches his eyes together and inspects the two animals on his skin. “How’d you know I liked cats?” He wants to know. “And the snake, really? Just because I’m in Slytherin?”
Haley still wasn't completely sure Lucius Malfoy had not been there voluntarily. She refused to see him as the victim here. On the other hand though… Draco was right. If he hadn't followed Voldemort's call, the bastard would have made him and his family pay. The thought made her shudder.
