I walked out, my feet slapping the hardwood. Sunlight washed in through the window, reflecting off the marble bar counter, and I flicked my wand at the coffee machine. It began whirling. Copper pots lined up on the stovetop; I forgotten to stow them away when I cooked the other day. I laid out two cups on the counter.
He had always known he was destined for that. Not just for the ones sitting around the long oak table here, but for the world. The age they lived in had sunk too deep into depravity and the muck of so-called progressive ideas. Riddle would lead them into glory and renewal.
Then I remembered with a crestfallen feeling that these walls were thick and soundproof, like all luxury residences tended to be, and that I had added my own spells to reinforce my privacy. Damn. That came back to bite me in the arse.
Harry moved, elbowing Bellatrix in the stomach, his other hand snatching the gun out of Dolohov’s hand.
They landed in the water, Draco giving a final wave to Theo before they submerged.
Tom Riddle watched his men under hooded eyes. The room was dark, though it did not discomfit him as it did some of his associates. They squirmed like vermin in a sewer, uneasy with the uncertainty and overwhelming tide of changes in the modern world. They needed light to guide their way out, and Riddle would be the one to provide that for them.
He stood up, cracking his neck, when Harry noticed a distorted shape. It was pressed to the driver’s neck, angled so that anyone passing by the window would miss it. It was only by the good fortune of the traffic cam’s angle that Harry managed to spot it at all.
Draco saw it. He put on a pair of gloves he found and picked up the Decoder. It was lighter than he remembered, until Draco realized all the weight from the seaweed and extraneous detritus had been cleaned off.
“But sir, maybe the deceased – Hopkirk – just wanted to work at home. It might just be a coincidence that he has left the file out. By all rights, we should have just returned the file to the Department of Mysteries and finished our report on the case. And that will be the end of that.”
“In any case,” Harry said, “Malfoy appears to be the best person to answer my questions. And if you have any other questions for him, or suspicions, I’d be happy to pass that along too.”
He had an urge to strip. The jeans were easy enough to manage; he could unbuckle with one hand, and they were loose enough to fall to the ground when he stood. The cool air on his skin was a luxuriant release.
“I like to think I’m still young,” I said lightly. “And I definitely am not ready to settle down. I’m much too busy to even think about that.”
Harry had skipped over it in his first perusal. “Is it safe to approach?” There were cyber defenses that, approached carelessly, would shred the uninvited toucher. These computer programs could damage Harry’s biomechanical systems or even give him brain damage should Harry underestimate them.
Strangely, neither of us had suggested opening it. Both Harry and I knew it was a bad idea. For one, we had no idea what might happened. Dramatic pyrotechnics came to mind, and though we were in a desolate part of the moor, I shuddered at attracting the attention of all and sundry. It was already bad enough wandering around with an ancient book in my hand. It was obviously not what one carried around for light reading.
Draco’s tongue stuck to the roof of his mouth. He became acutely aware of every sensation, from the breeze on his arm to the loose flap of his shirt. His palms were sweaty, his knees heavy, and this morning’s breakfast churned unpleasantly in his stomach.
Potter’s hand went to his hair. “That’s ridiculous. I combed it before I left my flat today.”
“Are you alright?” Draco asked. It seemed like the easiest way to begin. “You’re not hurt anywhere, are you?”
There had been bright spots in that visit, though. Like Zabini. Harry supposed in other countries, there were relatively more relaxed atmospheres, and Zabini had been more than willing to pursue and bed Harry. Even now, the sensations of Zabini’s firm chest under Harry’s hands and the swell of his cock in the man’s mouth was enough to tide Harry through another dry spell of celibacy.
“Without a doubt,” Harry said. “Didn’t you hear them? ‘We need to return to the master.’”
“Yes. Mundungus Fletcher has requested several items from us for sale to a private collector. We have taken the usual procedure. The goods are being transferred to the warehouse.”
It was curiously small and unassuming. The green cover with the ouroboros glistened in a gloom softened by the glowing grass, and I put my fingers on it gingerly.
Draco knew Granger was only trying to comfort him. She knew Harry just as well as Draco did, possibly even better. Harry wasn’t that type of man to disappear without a word. And logically, it was unlikely any event of such importance would happen in the middle of a cold spring night that would cause Harry to drop everything else.
I ducked into the sleek, modern building where my flat was. My father objected when I moved out of the Manor, bitterly complaining that I could have at least stayed at the family townhouse in Belgravia instead of wasting my money on a flat in a residence ‘infested with Muggles’.
“I can’t tell you, or I’d have to kill you.” Potter grinned at me. “I always have a strict confidentiality agreement with each and every one of my clients. That includes you, of course. But I can tell you my last case involved a missing tiara, a nest of vampires, and a chase from the middle of Slovakia to Egypt.”
He had no choice.
Draco shrugged. “It’s worth a try. Besides, I need to go back to the Manor sometime. Why not now?”
“Need help with that?”
Chuckling to himself, Harry climbed onto his Firebolt.
“It’s ….” Draco hesitated. He wasn’t sure how much he should divulge. Or if he were even allowed to, given much of the business he was involved in related to the Secret Service. But there was only so much information he could find on the internet, and Shacklebolt’s men were more adept at eavesdropping than historical research. “What can you tell me about the Shield of Achilles? Beyond the basics. I already know the basics.”
“Aren’t we headed for the Gherkin?” Draco asked. He didn’t need a map or a navigational system to know he was in the City. He had spent half his childhood here, visiting his father’s headquarters near where the old London Stock Exchange had been before it moved to the new premises. His father at that time had sniffed at the decision, though not soon after, Lucius had opened a subsidiary office in Paternoster Square.
Rosier believed that the Decoder had been lost in a storm when the ship that was meant to bring it to Alexander in his newfound city of Alexandria in Egypt foundered. The blueprint created by Aristotle had been left at Rhodes, which was a center of astronomy and mechanical engineering in antiquity, and those who had studied it had used it to recreate the Decoder in the form of Antikythera Mechanism. Rosier had said the later engineers modified it to be purely astronomical in function.
“The Malfoy boy hates me for what happened to his father, and doubtlessly Potter has poisoned the boy’s mind. No, the Malfoy boy is not to be trusted. However, I feel it would be … appropriate … for him to attend once I have unleashed the power of the Shield. He should witness the results of his actions.”
But Mr. Weasley didn’t. He merely returned to nursing his tea, his brows furrowed. Draco caught Granger sneaking a glance at him, quickly averting her eyes when she saw Draco notice. Harry’s hands were clenched around his fork, not looking at Draco.
My expression must have given me away, because Cross laughed. “Potter cares for you much more than he does about the Grimoire. He’s a fool, unlike you and me.”
There was a second volley. Even as they hit, the car began to move again, screeching to a start. It turned sharply from the curb where the car had rammed into, when – the driver – Draco couldn’t think. His mind blanked, he only managed to hold onto the seat legs for stability. It was by some miracle that his hands hadn’t been thrown off by the speed with which Harry drove. It was a miracle that the bullets hadn’t made it into the car again.
“I’m glad you’re alright,” Draco said, taking a deep inhale. “We should probably go before more of them come.”
Riddle held out his hand. Draco handed over the handlamp. He was excited, as much as Riddle was.
Harry knelt down. With one gloved fingertip, he poked at the vial. It was uncapped, and a small blue pill rolled out.
Malfoy held out an arm to stop Harry from plunging into the crowd in search of him. “Blaise’s harmless. You appeared to be an easy mark, and he went for it. You can’t blame a man for that. But now that he knows you’re with me, he won’t do it again.”
“Well,” Draco admitted, “you do seem more prepared than you were before. Remember that trip we took to Brighton and you forgot your suitcase and we hand to turn back halfway?”
“So.” Harry seemed discomfited by the silence. “How are you?”
“And I think it might be connected to this secret conspiracy or whatever,” I continued. “I don’t know much about it, but Luna mentioned an article in the Quibbler about an ancient order that’s looking for it – I sound ridiculous, don’t I?”
“Were you expecting to be jumped in the middle of the Ministry, Draco?” she asked instead, in a tone that made no doubt she thought I was an idiot.
There was silence as Harry finished shooting. He hadn’t aimed at any of the vital areas, just the legs. The men who weren’t unconscious laid mewling on the floor.
Ron’s freckled face stayed in its frown. “Is it? I don’t think we parted on the best of terms last time.”
Harry choked.
“I’ll be here,” he said. He laid a hand on my shoulder. “I won’t let anything happen to you.”
His hovercar pulled up to a tower in west London that soared far higher than the vehicle could reach. At a glance, Harry could see that rent here was just as astronomical, even if Harry sold all his belongings and cashed in his pension.
“I’m not sure why I sought you out,” I confessed. “You’re welcome to help me with my search, but honestly, most of the work will probably be going through old documents. You know, firsthand accounts, maybe maps and old household receipts. I don’t think it’s going to be exciting.”
Draco was breathing hard, from the exertion and adrenaline. It had been too long since Draco had visited the MMA gym he used to frequent in London. Five years, to be exact. The last time he had sparred with anyone was with Harry.
“Because of the reason why it’s needed or because of its effect?”
The Dark Lord took the scroll. I waited and watched. Then the Dark Lord nodded. ‘I’ll do it.’”
Harry laughed. “Come on. Let’s go into the car. Clearly this cold is affecting your brain.”
Harry tilted suddenly, avoiding the jet of green light that incinerated a traffic monitor.
Speak of the devil: Goyle’s flat face peered out the grate.
“Oh.” I was taken aback. “Are you sure? I mean … I might not have been born when they … died … but … my family and my past… Do you think it’s appropriate?”
I can put in a request to the Bureau of Traffic in the Department of Transportation, Hedwig said. But it would likely take a few days to clear, even with high priority.
“What do you know about a group called the Circle?”
Harry managed a smile. “It’s good to see you guys.” He wasn’t sure if he was being honest, either with himself or with Ron and Hermione.
I wasn’t sure what to make of the offer. On one hand, it certainly would be a boost to my career, with greater opportunities and access to better resources. But after the near-fatal accident with Harry ….
I smirked at him. “Yoga and pilates, Potter. Glad it’s paying off.” I gave him a quick peck on the cheek. His arms shot out and held me in place, taking control of the pace, his erection engorged and solid at my back, his breath hot on my neck.
“Well,” Draco said, “it’s possible that Homer simply heard and passed down the oral tradition of the Trojan war. So in that sense, it’s very possible that Achilles’ shield is a real item, albeit embellished. It could be that Achilles was a very real man, a war chief or warrior who participated in the fight against the Trojans, and his exploits became legendary.” He paused. “But the theory gets crazier from here. The fringe thinking goes that not only was the shield real, but it was actually forged by the gods themselves and had the ability to show the truth of the world. So in other words, it has some clairvoyant or such properties.”
What she said next shook me.
I shed my clothes as I approached, dropping them as I climbed in next to Blaise. The cool air hit my skin and I shivered.
The librarian was about to say something when he spotted the book. He opened his mouth and closed it again, rather like a fish, and I smothered my urge to laugh. His attention was entirely captured by it. His face was enraptured; the expression that came over his face transformed his gaunt face. It did not make him look better: the wild joy gave his eyes a fevered burn, and I was reminded of the Dark Lord whenever he heard a piece of particularly welcomed news.
Harry grinned. “You’re welcome.”
“Ah....” Theo didn’t make it this far in the business by being overly nosy. He and Draco were old acquaintances, friends even, but there was a limit which Theo observed. “Well, you have all the equipment you requested ready on the boat. I trust you’ve done this before?”
He sighed. “You might be right, but we should have the answer soon. I can’t believe it’s taking this long for the SI cryptographers to figure it out. They should have been done at least an hour ago.”
The sound of an incoming car interrupted – along with the unmistakable shot of a gun. Draco reacted out of instinct, diving under a boulder. He heard indistinct shouts, peeking out just in time to see the two men making their getaway in a nondescript silver sedan.
Fletcher narrowed his eyes. “Then you already know who you’re after.”
“It’s impressive you and your friend took out most of my men like that,” Dolohov continued pleasantly, as if they were discussing stock prices. “I’m not surprised that our master holds you in such high esteem. But you already knew that, didn’t you – Harry?”
“I’m ready to bargain.”
“Why are you surprised? It’s a very profitable investment. And” – Malfoy’s eyes glittered – “It’s much more interesting than staring at code all day, don’t you think? Why, it’s somehow even brought the redoubtable Commander Potter here.”
“He’s very uncooperative,” Greyback remarked. “Are you sure I can’t persuade him to be more helpful?”
“I think I might have what you’re looking for,” Fletcher said, baring a toothy smile. “You seem to be just in luck, your interest arriving at the same time a package of these goods arriving from abroad.”
Founders’ Heirlooms were steeped in mythology and lore, but the Hogwarts Founders were real people, and it stood to reason that the objects they owned were real, too. The Sorting Hat was example of one – and didn’t Saint Potter find more? We all knew the stories of how the Dark Lord turned them into his Horcruxes.
Her rebuke made me feel like a child again, like that time she had told me off for knocking over the ugly suit of armor in the Grand Hall. It had been one of my ancestor’s, apparently.
“You’re being ridiculous,” I laughed. “What would you want me to dress like? A satyr?”
“Yes. I think part of the book-key’s defenses is to trap you in an endless illusion. It’s an ingenious defense, and much more subtle. An enterprising person would probably choose to stay, too, out of hope that he can glean some clues from it. Speaking of clues, what did you find out?”
I made a face of mock outrage. “What? The Chosen One taking pecuniary advantage of someone in distress?”
“So all of this,” I motioned to the stacks of books, “is overkill. We don’t need to be looking up clues from past Malfoys.”
“Listen to the Healer, Draco,” Harry said, walking in with an enormous bouquet of flowers. I relaxed my glare on the beleaguered Healer, who looked relieved to see someone interceding.
Harry placed his wand on the scanner besides the archway and walked through. Hedwig had connected to the Web component that linked HQ and displayed all the generated data in the background.
Harry moved closer. “Are you nervous?”
“My sympathies, Potter.” And Malfoy did appear as though he meant it. “Though in my experience, sometimes having parents isn’t the glorious experience others portray. At least from my perspective.”
“Oh, Mr. Malfoy!” The innkeeper’s daughter greeted me with a cry. There was no one else in the inn. I wasn’t surprised. From what I had gathered, not many visitors came to this part of the world at this time. “Thank goodness you’re here!”
Harry obeyed, and they were skin-to-skin. Draco loved this, the feel of hard muscles, the substantial weight of another person – of Harry – pushing him into the bed.
It took several minutes, but Draco finally found him.
But my father was right; I couldn’t do as I pleased anymore. This episode had shown me that. I was the Malfoy heir, the last of my family. And tried as I did to hide from them, the responsibilities there were real – and onerous. I stared at the water running down the tiles. My parents would not be alive forever to shoulder them for me. I realized that now. I had a future that the serendipity of genes had mapped out for me.
I shook my head. It was difficult to fear a man when the very sight of him ignited rage, but I forced myself to remember Cross was a dangerous criminal that evaded all attempts at capture so far. His cool calculations were deadlier than mere brutal thuggery.
“It’s Elixir,” Finnegan answered shortly while Harry looked around. There were no evidence of a struggle, only the marks of a lived-in flat. The kettle was on the stove, still lukewarm, and a bottle of wine on the counter that was unopened. Nothing in the bedroom either, after Harry took a cursory walk around.
“It’s an honor to meet you, Commander,” Malfoy said finally, after a stretch of time had passed. “It’s a relief knowing we can all sleep safe at night with you and men like you out on duty.”
“That’s your SI?” Harry never encountered a Sentient Intelligence that managed to inhabit a physical body before.
“Hermione?” Potter seemed surprised. “No. I haven’t talked to her since we had dinner last week. How’s she involved?” He suddenly grinned at me. “You’re not here to hire me for protection from her, are you? Did she slap you again?”
Draco took a suppressed breath. He locked his eyes straight ahead, not wanting to see Harry shoot men – even men that had no compunction firing on them – in cold blood.
Draco only had the tiny slips of brightness through the window to guide him in the dim room. He wasn’t sure what was happening, where any of the others were, but he knew he had to get the Shield and Decoder.
They fell into silence again. The night was softly warm from the streetlights, the black ameliorated with silvery outlines from the moon, peeking through the clouds. It wasn’t so unpleasant to wander around here at night, especially when Harry was here with him.
I caught a glimpse of Cross behind the dancing conflagration, his face lit and triumphant.
And there was the thornier question of how to define their relationship. Draco and Harry had spent the past few weeks in each other’s company. It was like before – Draco unconsciously divided adult life between when he and Harry dated and after – and Draco could feel the barriers of caution he raised falling.
We allowed Morpheus to lull us to sleep, our bodies warm enough that we didn’t need blankets.
“I used it before. More than once,” Potter said apologetically. He seemed to read my thoughts. “I’m surprised you didn’t want to go to Hogwarts. It’s where Slytherin’s greatest work is. He has a chamber of secrets there.”
“I’m sorry.” All those small digs at Harry from Dolohov made sense now in light of this new fact. “You specifically asked to be on this team to take down this organization, didn’t you?”
I reached up instinctively, but Potter beat me to it. “I’ll do it.”
“They are registered to several post office boxes and legal firms in the City,” the computer replied. “I can provide a list for you.”
That was true. I just didn’t know how to broach that with him. it was one of the subjects that remained untouched in the silent rules we had drawn up after the War. “I’ll ask if I get the chance,” I said finally.
“I’ll protect you,” Potter replied automatically. He blushed. “I mean, I would regardless.”
“He’s an expert in Dark Magic,” Granger said. “It’ll be an asset to the team.”
“Well, he is annoying,” Harry said, but he was distracted by the unpleasant reminder that he needed to be more discreet. He let out a slow breath. “Include that I had spoken with him briefly. But that’s all.”
She had always been an idealist.
“Careful, Granger. If you’re not careful, I might actually start to like you.”
Draco had found the right man. Fletcher, if he didn’t work directly with Mors Mordre, would at least have second-degree connections to the group.
“Thanks. Are you even supposed to drink right now? Aren’t you on the job?”
“Men like that only care about self-preservation,” Harry said scornfully. “And they do everything they can to save their own skin. And take for themselves what they want.”
“The investigation into him laundering money for a criminal syndicate. It’s the talk of the entire government. I thought—” Mr. Weasley froze at Draco’s face. “You didn’t know.”
“But I do,” Malfoy said, with an odd twist that could have been a smile. “I have more experience in this than I could wish for.”
“Harry,” I interrupted his rambling. “They’re wonderful. I’ll wear them for next week when I’m presenting the Magical Historical Awards. Do you want to come with me to the afterparty, by any chance?” Now it was my turn to be shy.
Not to mention providing the weapon that hurt Harry. Harry didn’t want to believe that his friends – however long they hadn’t seen each other – would hurt him willingly. But perhaps, those of their new associates wouldn’t have that much scruple.
The hawthorn of the wand handle was cool and familiar in my grasp. I curled my fingers around it. A warmth spread from the wood through my palm, my wand rejoicing at its reunion with its master.
“Err …. Well, no. He was the one who sent this particular broadcast to me. I’m to contact their representative to correct some factual errors in their reporting.”
No one else made any movement. Dolohov and Bellatrix were by Harry’s side; whether they were keeping a watchful eye, Draco was not able to tell. Wormtail waited off at the corner, craning his neck almost comically to see what was happening.
“Already did that,” Malfoy interrupted. “And you don’t. I checked all the other Ministry databases too. None whatsoever.”
“No,” Draco said. He drained half his glass of wine. “If I know anything about my father, it’s that he considered Malfoy Manor the place to store all the materials he deemed important. He wouldn’t have trust anywhere else.”
The man advanced, his wand weaving a complex motion I didn’t recognize. I raised my own, shouting as a blinding flash blotted out the sun.
Harry looked at me, his eyes shuttered. “We’re going as friends?”
No. Harry hesitated. I want to see if I can do anything for his family.
“Muggle take-out don’t involve owls,” Potter pointed out.
It was a frightful sight. My hair was a mess, the fine stands like drowned reeds around my face. Even from a distance, the dark bags under my eyes were visible, and my pallor was more pronounced than ever. It was a far cry from the usual dapper self I fancied me to be.
But that wasn’t the worse of it: Draco remembered the cool reception from Harry when they met, the detachment that still stung.
Thankfully, we separated at the library. I summoned an elf who looked at Potter with reverence that I thought would not look out of place for a pilgrim seeing a saint’s relic to guide him to my father’s study.
“Where is that rat Fletcher?”
Draco charged at her, ramming his shoulder, sending the desk she was behind an inch back. The force knocked the gun out of her hand.
His body is long and lean, roughly my height, but he had the advantage of gravity as he pressed me against the bench. The cold stone I felt through the thin cashmere of my sweater contrasted pleasantly with the heat from his body. He was still wearing my robes over his. It made him look rather lumpy.
“Again the question: why?”
Potter quirked a half-smile at me. “I think we need to clear up.”
They had finished bandaging his arm in a cast. Weasley helped him up.
“Anticipating your opponent’s movement in battle can be a huge advantage,” Luna said. “Even being able to do so for a second.” She shrugged. “I wouldn’t know. I’m a pacifist myself.”
His proximity made itself known with a mix of heat and space on the bed. I inched towards it, away from the cool side of the sheets. It formed a gaping void besides.
Harry placed his hand over mine. Somehow, he had an uncanny knack to predict where my mind was. In my more paranoid moments, I even questioned if he were using Legilimency.
Harry knew that Malfoy did not.
“Draco, don’t be a spoilsport.” Blaise pouted. “You don’t need to ruin other people’s fun just because you’re as interesting as a puddle.”
“It was alright,” Harry said neutrally. “I’m about to head out for some sleep.” Harry made to leave when McLaggen said:
“You said that last time,” Dolohov said, and his face tightened at the recollection. “What makes you think that we will trust you this time?”
“We need your help,” Harry corrected himself. “The Aurors. Not me personally.”
Shacklebolt shared the same thought evidently. “I suppose in light of what happened tonight, it’s understandable. But don’t make a habit of involving unrelated people in Service business, Harry.”
Speaking off … Harry spotted a glint in the man’s breast pocket and fished it out.
I missed being a student here. Even my last year here, when it seemed that hell itself came to earth, this school provided me with a modicum of stability and safety that I craved. I could not bear staying in the Manor when the Dark Lord took residence.
“I – there’s nothing wrong with it. I just – I thought you were the one who wanted to keep it casual.”
Harry released a jet of blue light at Cross, who brushed it away, almost lazily, with his wand.
“I always make time for you,” Blaise responded. His hands roamed, exploring beneath the folds of my robes. He nipped lightly at my neck. “You know I can’t resist.”
“Do you really think so?” Draco’s eyes were cold. “I think you’ve gotten the impression that we’re not the kind who makes idle threats.”
Cross produced it. I made to grab it, but he held it away.
Draco endured an hour of angry lecture by the camp commander while an enormous face of Shacklebolt watched, projected on the screen by the video-link. Harry sat in the corner, quiet, his face shadowed.
Fletcher scrutinized Draco over. “Weren’t you part of a UN panel whose very job was to prevent people like me from happening?”
Malfoy shuddered. “Heaven forbid.”
Granger laughed. “No. I’m just a simple lawyer. Kingsley’s an alumnus of Hogwarts too. Gryffindor House, in fact. He tried recruiting all of us, though Harry was the only one who took him up on the offer.”
“That’s our Harry,” Fudge cried, clapping Harry heartily on the shoulder. Harry knew Fudge was probably thinking of ways to claim credit somehow at tomorrow’s presser. “We can definitely count on you to keep our streets safe at night.”
And what surprised him even more was that Harry had departed for work with a quick peck on Draco’s cheek. Like in the old days.
Then again, that sound. I froze. It wasn’t from an open shelf; someone was rummaging in my kitchen.
“Why did you bring me here? I suppose you already know I don’t have the Grimoire already, since you searched my person and took my wand.”
Draco scowled. “You just had to ruin it with that last line, didn’t you?”
Draco didn’t need to question why they were here. They had either tracked him or uncovered the trail on their own and found this place. He was hyper-cognizant of the Decoder, lying on the towel, exposed under the Aegean sun.
I swirled my tongue around it, my hands playing with his balls. I relished the jerky motions Harry made, almost in rhythm with my actions.
Biting down hard on the first reply that came to mind, Harry displayed a holo from his wand. “We discovered this on an Unspeakable.”
“Greek mathematics is also linked to philosophy,” Draco said. “Pythagoras also influenced Plato with his thinking, and Pythagoras was a firm believer in what we call numerology today.”
The Weasley gave a delicate cough. “Erm … Malfoy, can you put on your pants? I can see – well, sometimes things are better left to the imagination.”
He gave me a lopsided smile. “At least I know you’re back to normal when you’re insulting me.”
“What do you want with me?” Draco asked. “Is it for my father’s papers? Because I know even less than you do, as I’ve already told you.”
I shivered from the reminder of the Dark Lord. And from the image of Potter that swam into my head. Last I saw him was at a chance encounter at the Ministry. He was severe and handsome in his Auror robes. I still wanked to it; in my wilder fantasy, I imagined him in those robes pushing me against the wall and cuffing me to it as he put his mouth on my neck –
“So what do we do?”
He told as much to Malfoy.
“I cleaned up before I came,” I confessed. “It was making me … uncomfortable.” Sick was more accurate, but I didn’t want Potter’s pity. It came anyways.
“Really? Then you don’t like this?” He bit me rather sharply on the edge of my collarbone. I writhed. “Or this?” He moved his hand to pull back my hair, exposing my neck as he moved up, his erection in my face, almost thrusting in my mouth.
He continued before Harry could respond. “This schematic is really advanced for an SI. There seems to be a number of components that are … wait.”
But Draco knew the grounds. The route they took would take them to the roadside outside the estate: they would need to go through the woods. Draco would take the shortcut.
Harry, meanwhile, cocked his gun, and aimed again, this time at Dolohov. But Dolohov had recovered, his sled speeding away. The shot fell harmlessly into the water.
“I’m fine,” I said. I raised my arms. “Look. Nary a mark on me. My flat, though ….” I flicked my wand and repaired some of the lesser damage. The scorch marks left by my lightning and the ruined furniture needed more effort that I couldn’t give right now.
“I wasn’t a good husband,” he said. He finished his wine in one gulp. I moved to pour him more, but he motioned for me to stop. “We rushed into our marriage. It seemed like the world was ending at the time, and it seemed a good idea at the time. But we wanted different things: I was too restless, and Ginny was eager to settle down for the traditional white-picket fence house and kids.”
“I’ll hand the Decoder to you on the condition that you let these two leave,” Draco said. “And that I come with you.”
With an effort, Dennis smiled at me. “It’s a long time ago. I’m sorry I brought it up.”
Seeing the unmarked book hit me with such relief that I nearly collapsed to the floor. If it had fallen into that man’s hands … I had no idea who he was, but it was obvious he wanted this book – and what I knew about it. Ironic, as it had only been yesterday since I discovered it.
“I’ll cooperate,” Fletcher said. He sounded frightened. Whether it was of Harry and Draco, or by the import of what he was about to do, Draco was not sure. “You want to know who is selling all these artifacts, correct?”
The flames diminished, out of fuel and consumed by itself.
Hedwig, Harry said, can you access everyone’s files that are on the project? He made a rueful face. Sorry if it’s an unreasonable request – I know I don’t have any more details. We don’t even know the name of the project –
My warming charm was awful; I made a face at the lukewarm liquid that nonetheless burned a path down my throat.
I managed to angle my wand and whispered a muttered spell. The books on the shelves behind him jumped out, attacking Cross. They were heavy volumes, in the style of Victorian doorstoppers. Some hit him on the head, others aimed for his legs and the rest of the body with a rush of pages flapping.
Bellatrix raised her own to match Harry’s movement –
“You’ll have to show me once we’re finished with this whole business,” Harry said.
“Yes.”
I couldn’t help but roll my eyes. “I don’t want to know what you’ve been reading, Harry, but your taste in literature sounds appalling. I’m going to loan you some books from my shelves once I get back to my flat.”
“Now this,” I gestured at his pajama shirt.
“I like him,” my mother said.
“I was taking a leap of faith,” I retorted. “Trusting the Chosen Savior to save my bacon.”
“How did you know to come?” I demanded as soon as the spell was cast. “Are you having me watched?”
“I’ll leave you to your rest then, Malfoy.”
“I don’t know,” Shacklebolt said. “But I do know that you need to be careful with him.”
“I remember. But you sure you don’t want anything? You look a bit green.”
“Draco, Mr. Potter, welcome.” My mother rose from her chair to greet us. She gave me a quick hug and shook Potter’s hand.
The Reading Room was empty today. Usually, I’d welcome it, but now it gave me a sense of unease. Without of the soft noises of the patrons moving about, the rusty of turning book pages, or the scratch of quill on parchment, the silence had a sinister undertone.
“It does sound very similar to Voldemort and Death Eaters,” she admitted. I flinched at the name. Even ten years after his death …. “Not to mention including the Founders’ Objects would sell articles. People are always fascinated by them.” She looked at me. “But Draco, there’s a basis in fact for myths and legends. And you’ve just as much admitted that secret societies with deadly goals exist. Don’t go discounting that when you’re investigating.”
She laughed at that. “I think you’ve had more than enough to drink, Draco.” She checked the large and smudged grandfather clock next to the fireplace. “I need to head home soon. Ron’ll be back from his business trip in America.”
My hands flew off Harry as the Weasley’s words ended in a surprised shout.
There was a small vial in one of his hands.
“I’m not going to let you have the Decoder,” Draco told them, his voice calm despite the rise of terror in his gut.
“No.” Harry reached out to touch Malfoy’s Mark. “Not scared of you.” He slid a finger down the tongue of the serpent. “Not scared of you.”
Those were the exact words I had said to Potter, but somehow, I did not feel like being reminded of how similar I was to my father right now.
Draco stared at the note in his hand. His father’s note to him.
“Thank you.” Draco took up the paper, placing it lightly over the Decoder. He began to trace over the imprints with the pencil.
“Let’s get on the boat before we get too excited and knock it back into the ocean,” Harry said with amusement.
I puzzled over the book-key, narrowing avoiding dropping yogurt on the cover. Then again, maybe it would help solve the mystery if I did.
But – “He’s the head of the family now, I suppose, after his parents’ death. I guess he has the answers to what you’re looking for.”
"It will make me feel better."
Draco was torn.  He wanted to pull away, Harry was hurting him and he didn't want to be his punching bag because Ron was too stupid to know when to shut up but Harry's eyes were desperate, pupils wide enough to block out nearly all the green. "Harry, please…"
He shook himself out of it and pressed frantically against Harry's chest, that was too much, he was terrified. "Stop Harry, stop. Stop stop stop." His voice cracked, going high pitched, relieved when Harry pulled out. It was short lived though when Harry pulled him to his feet, and turned him around, shoving him down over the table and thrusting back into him.
"Already?  You've barely been mated a year." Narcissa sounded happy, but surprised. And a little exasperated.
Far enough away that he couldn't smell Harry anymore he finally stopped and tried to catch his breath and think clearly. How would he find out what he needed to know about Harry's abilities… could he owl his mother? She would probably know, she had said that she would have trained him to protect himself.
Draco sat on the floor, rubbing his wrists where the restraints had cut into them. When Harry looked over at him he wiped at his face quickly, trying to erase the tears. Harry approached him and he cringed, but Harry only laughed before backing off.
Harry is not right y'all
He had no idea what hit him. Suddenly his entire body was on fire, his cock instantly hard, his breath catching in his chest. Vaguely he remembered his dad training him on how to seduce a submissive. What he felt before must have been spill over, his natural attraction,
He finally gave into it, pressing back to meet Harry's thrusts. It seemed like a lifetime of Harry's easy thrusts, just barely dragging over his prostate and he was aware that Harry's hand wasn't on him anymore but that the sensitive head of his cock brushed consistently against the bed spread, a soft tease of a touch. He slid wetly against it, the head of his cock slick, precum steadily slipping down.
no matter what other people thought.
Everything was going fine until Ron and Mione tried to talk to Harry. More often than not for the next few days they sat at the Slytherin table and Draco thought Harry seemed more relaxed there. Draco had come in to breakfast to find Harry stiffly sitting at the Gryffindor table across from his two
The iron grip around his cock eased, Harry's hand moving as he started to pull back and thrust back in, setting up an easy pace in direct contrast to the urgency that Draco felt, making him groan and whine when nothing could make Harry speed up.
He reached up with one hand to run it through Draco's hair, making Snape's eyes widen when Draco didn't stop him. The boy hated when someone touched his hair. Mussing up its perfection. He lazily met Snape's eyes, "He's a submissive Veela."

he been pushing him anyways? He reached up and grabbed the arm holding him with both hands, Harry was so angry. "Let me go!"
Barely conscious he tightened his grip and without opening his eyes cuddled closer, "I love you too Harry."
Harry was straightening out his clothes but glanced up, "Do what?"
"What are you… what are you planning on doing?"
"I never said I wasn't. Maybe you're in love with me Draco, it doesn't mean the feeling is mutual."
"I knew it!" The words were hissed, the hot air brushing his neck and for a moment he was overwhelmed, acutely aware of the body pressed against his – the hands holding his arms. "You're not a dominant Veela."  Harry leaned in close, clearly scenting him.
Harry sat on the other side of the room, watching them, but really his attention was on the senior Malfoy who stood on the opposite side, moving between glaring at Draco and glaring at him. Only when Harry wasn't looking though, the minute he glanced that direction the older man looked away, pretending something caught his attention.
Draco could only stare up at him, trying to convince his body that he really did not want to be close to Potter right now. They were interested in very different things. "I don't want to fight."
"Some family."
Draco was mostly boneless but Harry pulled him to his feet, directing him to the bed, chuckling when Draco practically collapsed on to it. He pushed him over, curling protectively around him. When they settled Harry couldn't help but add, "I missed you."
She reached out to touch Ron's shoulder, her voice hushed, "Ron… let it go."
." His eyes were for Dumbledore again, "That isn't how I plan on picking my mate."
Yes, he would fight.
"After you… after you kill the dark lord you won't be able to do whatever you want."
He pulled back abruptly, slamming his hips hard enough to shake the table, "It doesn't matter."
He skimmed over the first few lines that seemed to only be admonishing him for his current progress, he seemed to have picked up that Draco was more concerned with avoiding the Veela coming than fighting for him. He did answer him though, and it seemed that if Harry was working to attract a specific Veela he shouldn't be affected, maybe some… spill over, but his father said that shouldn't be a problem for him. He rolled his eyes, how would his father even know? It said that he should be practicing his stances, his poses and Draco wasn't even sure he remembered them all.
"I thought so." Harry moved closer and ghosted his hand over Draco's chest, almost but not quite touching. "You could barely keep up the charade. I knew something was off, you kept complying when you should have been challenging.  You smelled dominant but it was kind of off and under it, when we got close, you smelled..." Harry’s face flushed and seemed about to say more but hesitated, "Change and we will talk more in Dumbledore's office."
Harry was smirking but he didn't care, the heat was unbearable, he needed to do something about it. "That's what I thought Malfoy, go back to your table. We'll talk later, I think you have some explaining to do."
Harry grabbed his wrists again and Draco gave up struggling. He turned his head to try to see him, "You're lying. The ministry… they would know… the dark lord…"
Despite the scowl on Draco's face Aidan didn't falter as he smiled, "I'm Aidan, it's a pleasure to meet you."
"Harry, you can't use your magic on muggles, the ministry-"
Draco stumbled when they landed, too shocked to make sure that he maintained his balance. Harry was holding him close though and once he had his stability he looked around. It wasn't what he expected, just a normal house, and he looked up at Harry, "Where are we?"
Harry only rolled his eyes and pushed Draco away. "I told you what I was going to do Draco, I knew you wouldn't have the stomach for it."
Harry knew he shouldn't be enjoying this, it was downright cruel. Draco was writhing in his arms, short panicked puffs of air emerging as he panted. Harry felt bad humiliating Draco, as he knew the other boy would be when he came to his senses but Draco had been deceiving him, and that irked his dominant side. He had known something was off but never could have imagined this, or how pleased he was by it, and that bothered him too.
Draco didn't miss the change in tone, in the other's body language, and he recognized the correction for what it was and he didn't push. Instead he uneasily glanced around, surprised no one had come into the room yet. "They are muggles?"
"We'll be there in a minute." He offered no explanation further than that and for that Draco was grateful.
He really looked at him and realized Harry looked like he was gonna cry, like he was right on the edge and Draco frowned, "Harry, are you… are you okay?"
Dumbledore made the closest to an impatient sound that Draco had ever heard, "This is the alternative to hundreds of Veelas showing up Harry. It isn't something that we could keep quiet."
"Where I grew up."
(See the end of the chapter for
"You of all people should believe that Draco. They all blindly believe that and they have never even seen what I can do, not like you have."
"Fine. You want me to do it right now Professor?" Snape paled at the fury in his words, "I was saving him the embarrassment of getting thrown down on his hands and knees and fucked in front of the whole school, but since you're insisting on it." He grabbed Draco's hand and stomped towards the great hall. Draco regained enough sense that his eyes widened and he shot Snape a horrified look, though he didn't resist. There would be nothing they could do to interfere with the matings of the Veelas.
"Harry-"
"More, please, more." He wasn't even sure if Harry understood him, wasn't sure if he was even really saying the words, but he let his body rock in time with Harry's movements, hoping that would be invitation enough.
"You smell good."
"You want me more. I don't believe you when you say I don't mean anything, I do and you know it. There is another way here Harry,
Harry shrugged and took off up the stairs and after a moment Draco followed him, not wanting to be left alone. By the time he made it up the stairs Harry was standing in the hallway, looking furious. "I come all this way and they aren't even home."
Draco made a keening sound in the back of his throat and Harry reached down to rub at Draco's erection, a predatory gleam in his eyes. He was hard too but he had enough self-control that he wasn't rutting like a dog in front of the whole school. He'd have to remember to mention that to Draco. With a smirk and a hand methodically rubbing against the erection he leaned down and bit Draco on the juncture between his neck and shoulder.
"May I go?" He didn't wait for an answer, fleeing the office, trying not to notice as Harry's calculating eyes followed him. Given his response to just being near Harry without any other factors a new worry occurred to him.  What would happen if Harry put out pheromones when he met the new Veela… would he be affected too? He didn't know if it was a general effect… or targeted.  How had his father not ever explained it to him? He could practically see his father saying the words, telling him that it didn't matter because he wouldn't be submissive. If he had been dominant it would all be instinct.
Somewhere an artist named Yeaka made a sketch of what this outfit would look like and I can't find it anywhere and I am beyond sad.  If I find it I will link it.
Training with his mom was much easier. They sat together, heads nearly touching as she went over some details with him, and when she explained how to control himself it made so much sense.
After a few minutes it was getting harder to sit still.  It felt like his temperature was rising steadily until he had to resist panting. He glanced at the others around him, they all seemed to be fine. It was getting harder to breathe and he abruptly stood up, waving off worried looks. "I just gotta go get my books." He was almost to the door when a body slammed against his, pressing him tight along the wall.
bed."
There was a frozen moment as Harry looked startled, pulling back and glancing down Draco's front. He flushed, turning his head away and wished he could cover himself but Harry still held his hands against the wall. Harry pulled back more, apparently unsure how to react to that. He tilted his head, confusion filtering across his face, but before he could say anything Dumbledore was there again, carefully stepping between them, pushing Harry back, obviously taking the pause as the finish of the fight. "Mr. Potter…"
He couldn't help but wanna sink into self-pity, it just wasn't fair. He should have been dominant so his father would be happy, even as a rebellious part of him added that perhaps his dad should just be happy with what was best for him, but he shook it off. He had come too far to go back, he could only pray that Harry would mate with another Veela sooner rather than later. He startled at the sudden growl that filled the hallway, shocked more when he realized it was coming from him. He knocked his head back against the wall hard enough to really feel it and muttered, "Harry is not for you."
He took the silence as a go ahead and continued, "Aidan will be arriving during classes Friday, his parents are very excited to have him here to meet the two of you.  He will be here for the weekend."
He started to pull away and Draco felt like he was suffocating again. "No!" The word was desperate and he grabbed Harry's hand, pulling it towards his robes. With a frown Harry tried to pull away. Draco barely paid attention to those around them, what he must look like. None of it mattered as long as Harry touched him.
He was sure he could resist Potter, he could feel the pull of his Veela though, instincts telling him to melt into the other's grasp, but he ignored them. He could do this no problem.
The younger one didn't seem to realize the danger he was in and pushed his way forward between his parents, "What are you doing here Potter, you and your … friend aren't welcome here."
"I have
Potter and he couldn't help being struck by a sharp pain of regret that he was kind of one of them. "Always have to be in the spotlight, don't you Potter?"
He scrambled backwards until he hit the wall, heart racing. He put his hands out in front of him, shaking his head. "I'm sorry!" He didn't care what it looked like. Harry's eyes flashed, and he looked terrifying and Draco wanted nothing more than to get out of the office without getting pummeled.
"Please Harry, just leave them be. Let's just go back to the castle."
"Harry, I would like to talk about this new development. Would you and Mr. Malfoy please come to my office?"
A cold shiver wound its way up Draco's back as he really took in what Harry was saying. It was fear that made him snap out, "
He didn't have to be told twice and he was nearly ripping his clothes off, uncaring when buttons scattered and the edges tore. They didn't make it to the bed, as soon as his clothes were off Harry spun him around and gave him a shove so that he sprawled onto all fours on the floor, the carpet already rubbing his knees raw.
"I can!" His voice had gone high pitched, and he sounded hysterical. Ron seemed completely unaware but Hermione had leaned back, and Draco mentally applauded her for the fear starting to come over her face. Good, she was finally starting to get it.
Harry couldn't help snort at that and turned his attention back to his mate, face softening at the easy joy that was on his face. It was obvious being near his mom was good for him, and he let them continue to bond.
“Don’t let any of them hear that,” Harry warned. “Or you’ll find your life here will get very difficult indeed.”
I stiffened. This was an old bone of contention between us, and he never failed to bring it up every time he saw me. He had never approved of my choice of career, let alone my field of study. “At least choose a more useful field,” he had said bitterly. I had tired of trying to convince him in seeing the value of my work, particularly when sometimes I doubted it myself.
“Thanks, Malfoy,” he said through a full mouth. He took an enormous swallow and gulped down half the cup. “Damn. I needed that.”
Bellatrix looked reluctant to lower her gun. Harry, too, was furious, though Draco couldn’t tell who the anger was directed at.
“We don’t have to do anything,” he said, his breath tickling my skin. “We can just cuddle.”
“Dear Draco,
“I was trying to prevent you from doing something nefarious!” Potter broke off again. “Sorry.”
To his credit, Draco managed to keep his voice even as turmoil roiled him. “I think we need to get out of there. And for us to do that, you need to tell me what is going on.”
Focus, Harry reminded himself fiercely. Don’t get distracted. And certainly not by a pretty face with a sharp tongue and nothing but derision for someone like Harry.
His eyes stung. Too much dust and from the flashlight.
“Here’s a copy of the names of Malfoys with potential Slytherin blood ties,” I said. “I isolated the candidates to only the ones with marital ties to families who are known Slytherin descendants.”
“Good.” He examined me closely. “You do look fine. I think if you’re certain about it, I can have a talk with the Healer and see if we can discharge you.”
Granger wrote this down in a small notebook. “I’ll add this to our database.”
The manager needed to control himself better, Harry thought annoyedly, as the man continued to chatter with questions about the potential bad reputation for the building, and how its security was well designed –
“It is puzzling,” Harry said. “At least to us.”
“Well, it was mutual,” Harry said. He grinned at me. “You were kind of a little snot back then, though.”
There were offices on both sides, some with people working at their console, hunched over with the light from the screens reflected on their faces, and others with their wrists and base of the neck connected by socket prongs to their Node Chairs, plugged into the Web. They trawled that vast digital universe, searching for any potential threats which may need physical intervention.
“Would you like another glass of wine, Mr. Malfoy?” Draco was only halfway through his glass. Fletcher, however, had already gone through two.
It hit harder and with more speed than a bullet. “My father – he was killed by them because he knew too much.” Draco met Harry’s gaze straight on. “He found out something about whatever they’re planning right now and was silenced because he was going to talk, wasn’t he?”
“Bellatrix.”The name came out in a venomous hiss.
“We don’t need to commit to each other,” Potter said. He wetted his lips. “I had fun kissing you.”
I could not deny that he kept my spirits up. To my utter jealousy, he came and gone as he pleased, though I pointed out that he was in as much danger as I was. Even more – the Circle wanted me alive. Not him.
“Look.” Harry tried again. “Malfoy, if I can apologize in a better way –”
Finnegan emerged from the bedroom. “I didn’t find anything, sir,” he said. “What about you?”
The Immobulus Protocol should use the backdoors the Aurors had into the other departments’ networks and send a signal telling the traffic grid to kill the suspect car’s chip, leaving it immobile.
I stepped through my fireplace into the Leaky Cauldron a few minutes later. Brushing off the dust from my robes, I spotted my friends in the corner. Goyle and Millicent and Blaise took up a table, with three pints of half-finished lager and one glass of wine on the table.
Finally, we came, him following me a fraction of a second later. I panted as Blaise rolled off him, our stomachs both stickily smeared. The room smelled of sweat and semen. I made a face and reached for my wand to cast a Freshening Charm.
“Sounds good.”
Harry’s eyes widened. “I didn’t know that was possible. There are safeguards in place to prevent Sentient Intelligences from doing that. Imagine if we lost control of our bodies.”
Grainy footage flashed across the screen, showing one of the deceased speaking to a hooded man at the bar.
“Yes, but this isn’t bits of old crockery, Draco. Can you aim at that spot between a man’s eyes and pull the trigger? It’s not a mindset that you can pick up like a toy. Nor should it be.”
“Don’t listen to them,” Harry said quietly. “My life isn’t worth giving in to Riddle. If he gets what he wants, then it’s not just me that will suffer. A lot of others will. Millions.”
Harry took out his wand and gave a little tap on the handle. A small light flicked on.
Harry snorted. “Not likely.”
“Coins, daggers, perhaps a shield,” Draco said, trying to recall what he saw in Dolohov’s cave.
“I wouldn’t think the media cared about something that happened so long ago,” Harry said lightly, more to change his own line of thoughts than actually caring about the psyche of the media. “They have the attention span of a magpie. They move on to the next shiny thing as soon as they see it.”
“Malfoy ….” Shacklebolt scratched his chin musingly. “I haven’t thought about them in a long time.” He turned to Harry suddenly. “You met the son, Draco, I believe?”
Potter ran a hand through his hair and let out a sound of frustration. “I don’t know either. But I know I can’t fight my feelings. And I know that this kiss wasn’t ‘just’ anything: it wasn’t a whim.”
The human body was capable of recovering from shocks remarkably quickly. I woke the next day, refreshed, the leaden weight of guilt lessened but not entirely gone. I was filled with a renewed sense of purpose. I had to find the Grimoire – and to make Cross pay.
Blaise told me that good dress shoes had the same effect. I glanced at my Cleverleys. I had bought this pair when the Magical Historian Society published my first article. It was that moment, when elation and pride surged through me, that I knew I had made the right decision.
Almost there, Hedwig said, though I did a quick scan of our surroundings and –
“Why? Have you found a clue to its existence? Or better yet, its whereabouts?”
“Don’t talk to my dad like that –” Ron started hotly, but Mr. Weasley spoke over his son.
I ate ravenously. I was halfway through the tray before I realized Potter had only brought one set of cutleries. “Are you not eating?”
Harry shook his head. “It disappeared. I’m guessing Dolohov took it and left from another exit that we hadn’t covered.”
“I’m sorry,” Harry said quietly.
“What is it?”
He would never confess to being aroused by such Neanderthal behavior, but he did. Draco’s hands drifted down as he thought of Harry. Those eyes, burning brighter than the sun in the desert as they looked at him…  The broad shoulders, the hands roughened from the elements as Harry pulled Draco down – Draco arched, stroking himself quicker as he imagined those hands on him.
Damn him! Harry had enough experience with the drug to know how addictive it was, and that even an additional milligram would trap a man forever. “How do you even know how much to administer? This substance is highly controlled, and even a man of your wealth and influence shouldn’t have access to this sort of knowledge.”
“What do you want with me?” Draco didn’t drop his guard. These men were spies …. He narrowed his eyes at them. Unlike his father, Draco didn’t dabble in politics or involve himself in any arenas where national security might be concerned. He was an appraiser at Christie’s – it was possible he might get sucked into smuggling or money laundering, but those cases usually involved the police, not these men who looked as if they would not hesitate to send a man to die for Queen and Country.
I nodded and took it out of my bag. “Here. I haven’t really examined it since. I thought it was too risky to do so, so I just kept it in my safe.” It was so small, so ordinary, amidst the rare leather-bound codices and manuscripts.
“Sorry,” I mumbled as Potter Silenced the librarian. He glared spitefully at me as Potter went into my kitchen. I heard the comforting sound of mugs jingling as I closed my eyes.
I almost sagged in relief. Cross had not taken it. It laid on the table innocently, a plain, hardbound book without cover or any markings, one among many,
“Still. Any whiter and I’d mistake you for a vampire. Go for some exercise. Mr. Potter here can give you some advice. He looks healthy and fit. Maybe he can take you for a walk sometime, can’t you, Mr. Potter?”
“You can ask permission from either Shacklebolt or McLaggen,” Hedwig said. Finnegan shot Harry a look. Harry could sympathize. That involved more paperwork, and inevitably, Finnegan would be the one saddle with it. “Or I can hack it.”
Potter came down as I was seating myself. And froze. His eyes fixed on me with a gleam that had nothing to do with the gaslight.
Harry sighed. “You’re too intelligent. Yes. Lucius Malfoy was offered a plea deal by us. In exchange for his aid, he would have received protection and immunity from further prosecution. We suspect the car crash was orchestrated by Mors Mordre.”
“What do you expect me to do?” Draco asked. “Get it to move?”
“I trust your conjectures,” Harry said. “They’ve saved my life more than once.” The pit of unease ever since Harry had seen the body turned into a churn. “All of the Unspeakables who worked on this … dead. Do you know why?”
Harry leapt out, a bright light hitting the intruder’s shield with a pitter-patter of gunshot. They were absorbed as the intruder waved his own wand; I felt the impact of it rush past me as Potter was forced to Shield himself.
Draco took a deep breath.
Doholov returned, the loud hum of the sled adding to the confusing mix of noises, overpowering the sounds of fighting between Harry and Bellatrix. He wouldn’t fire at them without hitting Bellatrix, Draco knew. Unless he wanted to get rid of Bellatrix too.
“Hedwig acts the same,” Harry told Malfoy. “Likes to show off. Hedwig, my SI.”
Despite his dislike of the man, Harry could not tear himself away from looking at Malfoy. The man was fascinating; not only because of his appearance, but because he exuded an air of casual disdain, an arrogance that Harry knew came almost inbred with this particular class of upper class. Yet Harry didn’t find that off-putting – it was refreshing, to be challenged instead of deflected or avoided.
There was a collective slackening of tension as the group relaxed. It was dark in the basement even with the wandlight. I could barely make out any finer details past the initial outlines of the objects.
“It probably won’t do that,” I said hastily to their looks of alarm. “Dark spells like that don’t interact well with others, and there are so many of these objects here. Most likely, their protection is passive, and they won’t react unless the right person touches them or activate them the right way.”
He wondered why it took so long for them to come up with the idea. But then, the simplest solution was sometimes the most difficult to fathom. But then, the boy still had not unlocked the mystery yet.
An idea struck him.
Bellatrix considered him. “I suppose so. You and I should check the warehouse, see if it is secure and nothing is missing. I wouldn’t put it past Fletcher to try and steal from us.”
“He also published a paper about bio-mechanical systems and their components linking to the Web as his Academy thesis,” Shacklebolt said. “I think that one made it possible for your Hedwig to work with your system so well. Otherwise, I think you’d probably will have to rely on vocalized commands to communicate with her.”
“I wasn’t aware treasure hunt dives were part of the job description for an appraiser at Christie’s.”
He responded with a hungry eagerness that drew the breath from my very lungs. I grabbed at every part I could touch, reassuring myself that he was alive, that I was alive.
The librarian was here, however, sitting in his usual perch with an overview of the entire room. He watched as I sat in my usual spot, laying out my books and papers in front of me. I acknowledged at him politely. He made no movement but stare, his eyes protruding and bulbous, rather like the eyes of a fish.
“Yes,” the man —  Slytherin — said. “You feel its power. It’s yours if you accept your heritage. You want it, don’t you? You crave what it offers. Not just magical power, but the sense of achievement, the recognition that will follow.”
“Maybe I’ll lend you one of my ties,” I said, feeling my face flushed. I loosened my own. “I don’t think I trust your taste in ties, now that I think about it. And now that you’ll be seen with me, you’ll need to look the part. That means you’re coming with me to my hairstylist on Mond—”
“Oh.” Finnegan didn’t inquire into the clear undercurrent of tension. “I’ve requested backup, but the signal seemed to be jammed.”
“Hmm … well, nice of you to stick me with the bill too. You know, you’re remarkably penurious for someone with a trust fund.”
“Well, for instance, the human body is a complicated machine all on its own, and there are many different parts to it. To my knowledge no one has ever built a fully functional mechanized model of the human body. And you mentioned this earlier, but the human mind and a Sentient Intelligence’s nature are very much different.” Malfoy shook his head. “Sorry, I got carried away. This area is one of my studies, and I’ve spent half my life on this.”
Nonetheless, I still checked it over, my professional side exerting itself. I took note of the small signs of wear that likely occurred before Slytherin hid it here, the leather-bound spine, the thickness of the volume from the vellum.
“It doesn’t look much like a memory,” she said. “I wonder why it took on that dark color.”
“I’m glad.” Draco was. With friends like that looking after Harry, Draco didn’t need to worry so much. He told himself he shouldn’t anyways; Harry had the combat skills and experience of an elite commando. Not to mention all the resources of State, never mind how many expense forms he needed to fill after.
I settled on a middle approach and said nothing further. I watched his face. It had a curious play of impassivity. I knew it was a façade – I had adopted the same one many times in the past. Curious … it suggested he knew something about it.
“It’s up to you, sir,” Finnegan said. “I’m behind whatever your decision is, but I just want to remind you that the sooner you close this case, the sooner we can worry about one less thing.”
Malfoy was unfazed. “We only need to ask a few questions and then we’ll get out of your hair. You don’t mind, surely?”
Harry wasn’t so ready to admit defeat. “Have you found anything at all about the file?” he demanded of the computer. “Anything useful? A clue of any kind as to its nature?”
I gave a cold smile. “Wait in line. When I see Cross ….” I flexed my fingers. How I would love to wrap them around his neck …. “In any case, we should be ready for a fight when we find it. I’m more than certain unpleasant surprises will be guarding the Grimoire, too.”
“I can use it and try to trace the origin of the buyer,” Malfoy said. “If it’s digital.”
“I’ll do it manually then,” Harry said. He sat at the chair and powered on the screen. A beep indicated it was on.
Cross knows that the Malfoy boy is close to the Grimoire. He rues the fact that their founder instructed no one but a descendant of his could wield its power. If he only has a free hand ….
Harry stopped, his hand reaching to the wall for steadiness. “That’s not possible. How can such a huge number survive down here? Without sunlight, without a sustainable source of food.”
They had called Shacklebolt to explain what had happened. He had listened with a grave face in silence, nodding at all the pertinent parts to acknowledge them, but saying nothing otherwise. At the end, he had only said: “Well, we need to find them then.”
“That’s good, dear.” My mother smiled. “Send him our love. And tell him he still needs to come over for tea sometime.”
“Is the Deputy Head of Magical Law Enforcement going to arrest me?” I gave her an exhausted grin. “I think I should feel rather honored.”
I shot a look at Potter. I didn’t want Potter to upset my father with his high-handed and clumsy questioning. It was a hallmark of Auror training.
“Don’t be silly,” Harry, reading my mind. “She’ll love to see you. And Teddy would be excited to meet his family.”
