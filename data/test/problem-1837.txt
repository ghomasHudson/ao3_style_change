“Malfoy Manor. We’ll just invite family and close friends.” Harry answered. It was a simple idea. But Draco liked it a lot. His parents wouldn’t mind at all, “You have bloody peacocks. That’s extravagant enough.”
“I have you saved as a contact on my phone.” Harry explained, “That means that I can see who’s calling me and it makes it easier for me to call people.”
“Bloody hell. That was a blow on my confidence.” Harry groaned, “Everyone will probably think the same thing when we announce our relationship.”
“How did you know?” Draco questioned, “This isn’t something you should know.”
The young adult sighed before walking over to the piano. It was a beautiful instrument that definitely didn’t get treated with the respect it deserved. Draco’s hand pressed against the frame of it.
“Actually. I got you some elderflower wine and chocolate truffles.” Harry grinned, watching as Draco looked at the bottle in curiosity. Harry knew that he was right. Draco mostly drank red wine, most likely the one that his family manufactured, “Do you accept the courting gift?”
“Hello?” Harry grumbled into the phone. Draco didn’t call him regularly as he was a quick learner and had managed to figure out how the majority of things without any help. But there was something that Harry would not admit to anyone. The brunet enjoyed when Draco did call him. It gave him an excuse to spend a bit of time with him. And in all honesty, they were becoming quite good friends.
Harry had insisted that they should celebrate, Draco had no idea what they were celebrating. But it was a simple occasion, they ordered some food and watched a movie.
It was always weird to think about how messed up everyone’s lives were because of Voldemort. And now that he was gone, they would finally be able to live the lives that they had always wanted to live.
“Finally something that everyone can agree on.” Lucius snorted.
“You’re a bit of a worrier.” Draco pointed out, “Are you like this with everyone? I don’t think I would be able to deal with the stress of worrying about everyone.”
“I can’t even believe I’m even humouring your idea.” Draco sighed, running his hands over the furniture. If Harry didn’t know any better he was sure that the house was beginning to brighten up, “But such a beautiful house does need more wizards or witches living in it. Can you not feel the magic sing? You need to bring it back to life.”
“Because you would have rejected it vehemently.” Blaise answered flatly, “We know you well enough to not get involved when it’s not necessary.”
“Really? So who’s your dreammate?” Draco queried, it would be interesting to know if they had any control over who they dream-walked with, “Anyone I know?”
“My Godson. How very peculiar.” Sirius smiled, “This has always been a part of the Black family, my dear cousin. Not a well known secret and we would like to keep it that way. Can you imagine how many people would try to force their ways into our dreams? There is power in a name. Especially the Black name.”
“Well. It’s a goodbye from us.” Harry smiled, “We will see you in a few weeks.”
That’s why he was going to wait for a year when Snape will be able to assist him in becoming a Potions Master. He would tell Harry when he was definite that that was what he was going to do.
Just your feet rubbing up against mine
The day had started off pretty simple, he had bought all the necessary foods and drinks for a party. But he didn’t keep in mind that Pansy and Blaise would probably also bring alcohol. And it didn’t help that Harry bloody Potter had purchased quite an array of Muggle alcoholic drinks for him to try. His apartment had enough alcohol to satiate a small town.
The blond was shocked out of his thoughts by a knock on the door. No one knocked on his door. He took a look through the peephole and wasn’t sure how to take the scene.
“Okay. You don’t have to put a label on your sexuality.” Hermione smiled, “I’ll do some research to find out more. But I still think that you should talk to Harry about this guy that’s harassing you.”
Draco had now lived in his apartment for over a year. There were still some things that he still didn’t quite understand, like the way he always seemed to somehow lose a sock if he put them in the washing machine. The blond had learnt the hard way that sometimes it was better to hand wash clothes, so he usually washed his underwear and sock by hand, while the rest of his clothes were thrown into the washing machine. But that wasn’t something to think about right now.
“Harry. Don’t be so loud, he’s napping.” Draco scolded, “And he’s not my child. I don’t have children.”
“Do you really want me to repeat myself?” Harry growled.
“Harry’s right.” Lucius snorted, “You were telling me that you wanted to master potions. Being a healer will take a lot of time.”
“He’s in love with Remus and he doesn’t know what to do because Remus is married to Tonks.” Harry said offhandedly, Draco’s mouth opened in shock, “What. Everyone sees how they look at each other.”
“Do you seriously think that I would deliberately go into your dreams?” Draco snorted, his hands making their way onto the lapels of Harry’s suit. Pulling him closer. They were too close. Draco was teasing him, “I’m sure you’ve heard of dream walkers, but I don’t specialise in that sort of magic. I do dabble in dark arts, but I would never reduce myself to dream walking.”
The blond just hoped that the new generation of Slytherins weren’t subjected to similar treatment. But he had a nagging feeling they were. Draco had a feeling that he would have to visit the school in the future just to check.
“We’d appreciate that.” Ginny agreed, “You’re a great guy Harry.”
“No. They do know.” Draco sighed, “I just didn’t know that you told your friends.”
“Devilishly good looking I hope.” Harry beamed, wrapping his arms around Draco’s waist, “Hello husband. I believe I’ve drunk a tad bit too much.”
Just your feet rubbing against mine
“It gets worse than that?” Draco asked, “How on earth does it get worse than that? Are you having twins?”
“I’m not going to bother Potter.” Draco frowned, “He’s done enough for me.”
“That’s where you’re wrong. I make every dream of mine a reality. So you wait, you will be writhing beneath me eventually.” Harry promised, it almost sounded like a threat. But Harry was never really that great at expressing himself, “I don’t want to stop the dreams.”
“Luna, how can I help?” Draco greeted, letting the witch in. It was weird to think that she would come visit him. He had a feeling it had something to do with Harry.
“I don’t think it’s something that you need to hear from me.” Hermione commented, “But, I am definite that you’ll figure it out on your own. I mean you are equally as smart as me.”
“Why are you here?” Draco asked them both, “I haven’t finished the book yet, and I’m sure we haven’t arranged to meet up.”
“I guess I’ll invite her over some time.” Draco grumbled, “Anyway. I’ve got to get back to work.”
“Then why are you so antsy?” Sirius asked, “Oh. You figured it ALL out. Not just that part, but the other part too?”
“He knows.” Blaise cut in, “And if he really struggles, he can always contact Potter. I’m sure he would be more than willing to help.”
It would have ruined everything they had been working on.
“I wasn’t aware that you could read French.” Harry commented, finally taking a seat on the other side of the sofa. Harry’s eyes were drawn to Draco’s socks, grey striped socks that looked extraordinarily cosy.
“Does it have something to do with Sirius?” Draco asked curiously, it was shocking, to say the least. The couple hadn’t been married that long, only a few years. And they had a child together, “And don’t worry. It’s not my place to tell anyone.”
“I was the one that did things wrong.” Draco frowned, “But that doesn’t matter anymore. So how are we going to move forward with this?”
“Harry is perfectly fine with chicken.” Draco sighed, “I think it was kind of unnecessary that you had to bring up the whole food intolerance thing.”
“I’m pregnant.” Ginny said, “Blaise’s mother already knows, she was the one that suggested that I go to a healer. Just to confirm.”
“Just because my animagus is a dog, it doesn’t mean that I don’t like cats.” Sirius frowned, scratching the kitten’s chin, “And Draco seems to like her.”
“That’s Harry Potter.” Blaise smiled all-knowingly, “And he does work for me occasionally, so it’d be better for business if you didn’t shag him.”
“Are you just going to continue to stare at me and play with my hair the whole night?” Harry smiled bemused, one of the main features that Draco loved about Harry was his eyes, “Or are you going to tell me how much you love me?”
“Are you trying to tell me that you don’t have a freaking toddler sleeping on you?” Harry frowned, “I didn’t even know you had a child.”
“I’ll take your word for it.” Draco decided, the man came out with the drinks. The drink was a creamy yellow. Something that Draco had never seen before, he was used to brightly coloured juices. The consistency also looked a lot thicker than a regular drink, something that interested him greatly. The blond took a careful sip, just to try how it tasted and if it was something that he would be able to stomach. And to his surprise, it was actually surprisingly good. Something that he was sure that he would be able to regularly drink.
“Ugh. Never again.” Draco frowned, “I am going to murder the two of them.”
“Not as weird as you thought it would feel?” Harry said defensively, “What’s that supposed to mean?”
“Oh Harry, you’re so dastardly. You should be glad that I love you.” Draco snorted, “I still don’t understand why my parents chose peacocks out of all animals? I hate those birds.”
There was someone in his arms. Harry frowned before looking down. The sight of blond hair made his eyes widen considerably. Harry carefully slid his arms off of the other wizard. He would hate to think how Draco would have reacted if he woke up to this.
“And I thought Hermione was bad with book references.” Harry laughed. He could deal with Cathy, it was definitely better than Cat. He kind of liked it, “But I like it. Cathy.”
“No. I was planning on getting a house.” Draco answered, “My neighbours have been a little loud lately, and I thought it would be better to get a place with more privacy.”
“What’s that?” Draco questioned, he sure as hell hoped it wasn’t going to be something degrading.
The brunet didn’t respond. Draco had a feeling that he was embarrassed, and surely enough the wizard came down looking a little flushed, wand in hand.
“There are plenty of people that don’t like you.” Draco pointed out, “You can be such a plonker sometimes.”
Draco couldn’t help but smile at that. If there were any doubts in his mind, Harry had managed to clear them. For the first time in a while, everything made sense. Draco smiled as he pressed his lips against Harry’s, “I hope that answers everything.”
“You’re learning big words from her now.” Draco teased, hanging out with Ron made him realise that the Weasley’s were pretty fun banter. They always made things fun and he knew where the line was, so there wasn’t a chance of it hurting anyone. Ron was fun, “Hanging out with Hermione has done you good.”
“Can we not talk about this?” Draco asked. He didn’t like the conversation. The idea of Harry dying twisted his chest painfully, “So tell me what’s going on with you? You haven’t mentioned any women or men for a while.”
“Hermione’s punched me before.” Draco pointed out, “And I'm not sure if I should mention the bathroom incident.”
“You’re perfect.” Harry smiled, in turn making Draco snort.
“Ciao.” Blaise grinned, “Call us if you need anything.”
“Draco? Are you okay?” Harry asked. The fact that Harry knew it was him straight away confused him. It made no sense for the spectacled wizard to know it was him.
What he wasn’t expecting was the sight of Harry springing onto the other man just to punch the hell out of him. There was a crowd forming around them and Draco had a feeling that the authorities were going to get involved.
Draco stared at the book covers. The blond used to love reading when he was younger, but he wasn’t sure if he was going to appreciate Muggle literature. He flipped one of the books over to read the blurb and there was something that struck out to him, “These are all in French.”
Draco Malfoy.
“I’m sorry, I’ll make sure to write everything down next time.” Harry snorted, “But maybe you should keep the vacuum cleaner. Just in case. It might be useful one day.”
“How the hell did you manage to figure all that out?” Draco asked, he was sure that Harry noticed that things were amiss, but he didn’t think that he would be able to figure everything out, “But I guess since I didn’t have to tell you anything, I can say that you’re right?”
“Okay.” Draco agreed, “Hopefully everyone will get along.”
“What did you think I would do? Knock him out?” Harry asked curiously, “I still think it would have been better if you told me about the guy. I mean I could have helped you get out of this situation a lot sooner.”
“Stay here as long as you need to.” Lucius said, “But I have to insist on having some potions on hand, in case of an emergency. So I’m leaving a few here.”
“I will start using magic again.” Draco insisted, “But right now, I just want to see if I’ll be able to survive without the use of magic.”
“I guess that’s true.” Harry sighed, “So what are your plans for the day?”
“Come on. I’m only saying that if you do end up struggling, you can always contact him. You have that option.” Blaise grinned, “And he was the one that offered to help you move out here. You were the one that said no.”
“Yeah, I hate you too.” Draco beamed, “So shall we get going?”
“You did all of that for me?” Draco questioned, “I can’t believe you and Hermione did this without telling me.”
“What the fuck? Draco why is the dishwasher full?” Harry frowned, staring into the dishwasher. The majority of the plates looked surprisingly clean. He was sure that he had just loaded the machine, “Are all these dishes dirty?”
“Everything went wrong.” Severus answered for Sirius, “There was the whole Voldemort fiasco and then Sirius was sent to Azkaban after he was framed for giving up James and Lily. Nearly all of the wizarding world had thought that Sirius was a criminal and I’m sure that these thoughts probably plagued Remus as well. And by the time Sirius was out of Azkaban, his mental health wasn’t the greatest. And by the time he was better, Remus had already met someone.”
Thank you all for your support.
“What was Hermione right about?” Draco asked curiously. Maybe there was an event that was coming up that they wanted to surprise Draco with? Draco was pretty damn good at figuring things out, “Is there anything that I need to be worried about?”
“I agree with you completely.” Draco smiled maliciously, he was going to make sure that Sirius was going to pay.
“Teddy. You need to get back to your parents.” Draco said softly, trying to ease the toddler’s fingers away from his shirt. But the kid was not relenting, “Teddy.”
“Why a sudden interest in my son?” Lucius asked curiously, before humouring Harry’s question, “Draco decided that he wanted to attend Durmstrang against his mother’s wishes. She had always wanted him to study nearer, but he was adamant.”
“Oh. You’ve got most of it right.” Harry smiled, before clicking a switch, Draco withheld the temptation to tell Harry not to touch the switch because he still had no idea what it did. But as the kettle spurred into life, Draco stared at it curiously. Muggles were confusing. And to think that he mocked their lifestyle previously, “So you see the switch? It makes sure that electricity is transferred to whatever you're using.”
“I would like that too.” Draco smiled, “You’re welcome here whenever you like.”
“Draco? Are you okay?” Harry asked, the fact that Harry knew it was him straight away confused him. It made no sense for the spectacled wizard to know it was him.
“I know.” Draco laughed, “I’ll see you guys around.”
“I wasn’t aware that you had a sex life,” Draco said flatly. It was a very valid point. Draco had not once seen the other wizard do anything but drink. And that’s why Draco was trying to reintroduce him to his old pastimes, “I don’t really want to talk about this subject.”
“Enjoy yourselves.” Severus smiled, waving the couple off, “We’ll see you soon.”
“I don’t want to talk about it.” Pansy said firmly, “Don’t worry you’re pretty little head about it.”
“Draco. You shouldn’t rush something like this.” Harry said softly, earning an incredulous look from Draco, “Hey. I didn’t rush into anything, I just happen to be at the wrong place at the wrong time.”
“I hope so too. I did everything I could.” Draco sighed, Pansy rubbed his shoulder in sympathy.
“And what’s that?” Ron queried, the redhead looked like he already knew where Harry was going with this. And that was good. If they were on the same page, it would be easier for Harry to get what he wanted, “What do you want?”
“I come bearing gifts,” Harry announced, entering the study. The good thing about Draco living with Harry’s Godfather was that there were no restrictions on Harry, he could travel into the house whenever he wanted to.
“But what’s am I supposed to do now?” Draco asked, “I don’t want to ruin everything that we’ve built.”
“Cissy darling, I think Draco is right to try to experiment.” Lucius smiled, “If we were all to suddenly lose our magic, Draco would be able to teach us how to survive.”
“I’m taking a year hiatus from Quidditch.” Ginny answered, “Or maybe a little longer. I’m not sure yet.”
“How did you know?” Draco asked her curiously, “What am I supposed to do?”
“I’m quite definite. I mean his hair colour changed.” Draco grinned, “Maybe I’m just better with children.”
“I’ll see you tonight.” Draco smiled.
“I thought that you were aware of this.” Draco frowned, “She was the one that gave me the books to read.”
“Okay. Let’s eat shall we.” Lucius said, “We don’t want the food going cold.”
“I hope they’re suffering,” Draco said, startling another laugh out of Harry. The blond could be blunt sometimes.
“I think it’s good to know.” Harry frowned, “I wouldn’t want to feed you something that could make you sick. Now I know what to watch out for.”
“Sirius? Why would it have anything to do with him?” Remus questioned, “I haven’t actually been able to get a hold of him recently.”
“There’s paracetamol and water on the table.” Harry laughed, “That might help you a little bit. But I’m afraid you’ll probably be in bed most of the day.”
“I want to keep it.” Pansy stated, “It’s my baby.”
“Why does he invest so much time in me?” Draco asked curiously, it was something that was also bothering him. Maybe hearing it from Hermione would help him understand it better.
“Of course I’m being Sirius. Don’t wear out my name baby cousin.” Sirius laughed, “But yes, I was only joking. Maybe I’ll kiss and tell if you tell me who has been plaguing your dreams at night.”
“That’s what silencing spells are for.” Draco snorted, Harry’s eyebrows raised considerably at that comment. The other wizard wasn’t expecting the offer of sex to be on the table. If he knew that all it took was a box of chocolates and wine he probably would have tried it sooner. The blond looked at both wizards before talking, “But no one is having sex tonight.”
“I can’t guarantee that.” Blaise responded, which basically meant that what Draco was thinking was right, “But I think that you know what she’s going to say.”
This chapter is dedicated to @imasurvivor21 and @Des98  thank you for your comments!
“Yes, he did.” Harry laughed, “And of course he did it in the most flamboyant way he could. I’m sure you probably already know what your father did.”
“I probably would have killed the guy.” Draco admitted, “But Harry. You really didn’t have to do this. We haven’t even been friends for that long.”
“I will.”
“Merlin. She was right.” Ron spluttered, “Y-you don’t need to do all that mushy stuff. It’s all behind us. I forgive you.”
“You conniving- What do you want from me? Dreams should remain that. Dreams.” Draco grounded out. The blond was awfully feisty, it was something that Harry quite liked, “I’ve done some research and I think I have figured out a way to stop the dreams.”
“You want Draco to move into your house.” Lucius repeated, “Like you want him to live with you? Like in your house?”
And on Saturday, I'm going to be travelling for two weeks.
“I won’t forget anything.” Draco promised, “As soon as I’m ready to come back to the wizarding world, I’m actually hoping to become a potions master.”
Currently, that power is making itself known. His magic is restless; it needs to be doing something.
Hermione patted the bench beside her in trepidation; Pansy would never be seen willingly associating with Gryffindors, so it had to be horrible news she was bringing. Pansy sat herself down and dropped her satchel loudly on the table. This seemed to be her way of startling the surrounding Gryffindors into resuming eating their meals instead of staring at her. It was effective, and Hermione noted that down for future use.
“Hominem Revelio!” Kingsley yells, attempting to reveal any dark intruders. Harry instinctively tightens the shield. The effect is almost as strong as the wards on 13 Grimmauld Place, one of the most powerfully disguised residences in magical Britain. Malfoy, who is unaware of Harry’s precaution, goes white and stops breathing. Kingsley announces them to be alone. Dean and the Auror, however, do not drop their wands.
Truly, there was never a more stubborn man. Even after their lengthy affair, even with Lucius Malfoy rotting in Azkaban, his mother near out of her mind with worry and loss, and there being no one left to disown him, Draco clings to his heterosexuality like a life jacket.
Minutes crept by. Hermione’s concentration powers failed her in the face of a near-continuous stream of giggles. She looked up, a fearsome scowl etched into her face, when she glimpsed Madam Pince looming in the shadows. She was creeping closer and closer, readying herself for a verbal smackdown. Her eyes were narrowed; fixated on the source of the noise. Hermione gulped. Madam Pince instilled genuine fear inside her. Neither of the boys noticed her lurking presence, too absorbed in their little bubble.
“Of course I do.” Harry voiced firmly, “Don’t you consider us friends?”
“Just do what you have to.” Draco said softly, pressing a kiss to the top of Teddy’s head, “Sweetheart, you’re going to have to go home. I had fun with you, you’re free to come here whenever you want.”
“I thought I would drop in and see how you were doing.” Harry said, “Looks like you’re doing pretty good.”
“Should we invite everyone at the same time? Maybe we can have dinner at the Malfoy Manor?” Draco started, “The sooner, the better. That way we won’t have family nagging us in the future.”
“So when do you need me to be in?” Harry asked, deliberately avoiding the whole other part of what Ron was saying. He hadn’t realised that he had called in sick that many times. But now that he really thought about it, he didn’t actually remember the last time he was in the store, “Do I need to dress fancy?”
Harry would always be haunted by the shadow of Voldemort, there was always an expectation for him to be this perfect individual and it always surprised him to think of how he had managed to live with such a heavy burden on his shoulders. Even when he wasn’t aware of being a wizard, everyone else expected him to be their saviour. And in all honesty, Harry probably would have ended up dead if he didn’t have Hermione and Ron to support him.
“So you’re really not going to give me anything? Do you really have no inkling as to what’s going on?” Harry frowned, his hand caressing Draco’s face. It felt like he was magnetised. Every part of his body started to sing from just physical touch. He had bedded him plenty of times in his dreams, but he was sure it would be incomparable to the real thing, “Tell me. If you knew that we were sharing dreams, why did you not search for me?”
“No. I was just remembering Hogwarts.” Draco answered, “Worst years of my life.”
“I don’t know Harry, this really isn’t the time to make movie references.” Blaise joked, “But yes, I have seen it. Why are you looking at me like that? It’s a classic! I’m Italian for goodness sake.”
The idea of everything falling apart scared Harry. The tugging feeling in his heart indicated that it wouldn’t be good for him at all. Voldemort had made him lose far too much.
“No. We ran into each other at the Leaky Cauldron.” Ron frowned, “Why would you think that Draco had anything to do with it?”
“I do like you.” Harry smiled, earning a loud sigh from Draco, “If you really don’t want me to make dinner, then maybe you should make me food for once.”
The dinner seemed to be going okay. They were seated in a way that made sure that Sirius and Remus were on opposite sides of the table, but Draco had a feeling that his cousin wasn’t doing so well. The brunet looked like he was on the verge of the panic. It was when Sirius’ glass of wine tipped over that Draco finally noticed the extent of what was going on. Severus looked at Draco’s parents and it was almost like they were having an internal conversation.
“So it just sucks things up?” Draco repeated, “That’s the function of this device?”
“Connecting your dreams to Harry Potter? What is kind of nonsense is that. We have nothing to gain from you being connected to him.” Lucius frowned, “And what on earth do you mean your dreams are connected? Are you dream walking? You-”
“Harry’s in love with Draco.” Hermione answered, “Draco just figured it out.”
“Yes. We had sex and now I’m pregnant. Can we move on from that?” Ginny laughed, “Draco. I wanted to tell you first because we want you to be the Godfather. Luna’s already agreed to be the Godmother.”
“Well, I don’t really know how to bring the magic of a house back.” Harry responded, it was a curious concept. He never really had to deal with the magic of houses. Harry knew that Hogwarts was magical, but he didn’t consider the magic of every other wizarding house. He watched as Draco sat on the armchair and the fireplace lit up, “The house seems to like you?”
“Please don’t.” Harry whispered, earning a soft look from Draco, “I want to know more about you.”
“I can’t eat anymore.” Draco complained, “Or I’ll be sick.”
“Yes. They did break my heart,” Sirius said solemnly, placing his face in his hands. Heartbreak was one of those things that made Draco grateful that he had never fallen in love. He didn’t want to be hurt in that way, “That’s why I’m not going to talk about it.”
“I don’t even want to think about it.” Harry complained, “That’s my best friend your talking about… Wait. Isn’t Pansy one of your best friends? So shouldn’t this be weirding you out too?”
Draco Malfoy was calling him at bloody three o’clock in the morning.
If you asked Draco Malfoy where he thought he would have been ten years ago, it definitely wouldn’t have been where he currently was. He was renting a shitty apartment with a girl he had met through work. They had both worked part-time positions in a café and somehow formed a friendship through their love of books and being generally awful people. If his parents could see him now, they would be scandalised.
“Ginny Weasley.” Draco repeated, “Well. I wasn’t expecting that. But you did say she was pretty back when we were at Hogwarts, so it’s not really that surprising. I still think you should go for it.”
DRACO MALFOY JUST TOLD HARRY POTTER THAT HE WAS IN LOVE WITH HIM.
“This is surprising even for me.” Lucius admitted, “I was almost definite that you two were in a relationship. I thought that he was courting you.”
“Now we can finally prepare for the wedding.” Harry added, “If you still want to get married to me of course.”
“Who knows what goes through his head.” Draco chuckled awkwardly, Harry gave him a look that suggested that he knew that the laugh was forced, “Anyway. Are you going to tell me why you got Andy fired?”
“You’re as stubborn as a bull.” Ron sighed, taking a bite of his sandwich before he continued talking, “But I’ll drop it. You’re right this isn’t the time or place to be arguing about this.”
“I’m not pitying you.” Harry promised, “If anything, I admire you.”
I think they call it luxury
“Of course.” The waiter smiled, “Your food should take be ready in about thirty minutes. I’ll have your lassi out in just a second.”
“Harry? You just invited me.” Draco frowned, not quite understanding why Harry was brought up in the conversation.
Just the two of us and no sheets
“Ha-ha. We’ll see about that.” Harry snorted, “You don’t mind if I stay do you?”
“Blimey. ‘Mione was right.” Ron laughed, his eyes crinkling in a way that suggested that he knew exactly what Harry was hiding, “But yeah, I’m definite that he broke something.”
“Yeah. I guess it wouldn’t be such a bad idea to have some potions.” Draco agreed, “So how has everything been for you? You said that it’s getting better?”
“Of course.” Severus agreed, his eyes were on Sirius. And Draco couldn’t help but wonder if Severus knew that there was something going on with Sirius, “We have a lot to discuss.”
“We’re talking aren’t we, cousin?” Sirius grinned, Harry did not like the expression on their faces. Why would they both be grinning at the same time? It was frightening, “Or do you want some advice? To spice things up?”
Draco Malfoy was in love with Harry Potter.
“See you around Remus.” Draco smiled, waving the older wizard off, “Now Harry-“
“Why don’t you leave him to stay the night?” Draco queried, “I don’t mind if you come in the morning.”
“How were you not sorted into Slytherin?” Draco laughed, maybe they could have a little fun, “You’re one of us, Potter.”
“It felt so real.” Harry voiced, “You even said that you wanted to start a family with me.”
“I’ll call you later!” Sirius yelled back, the man could still be heard muttering. Ineligible. And Draco couldn’t help but laugh. Anything to get over the fact that he and Harry had both confessed that they were in love with each other.
“It was just a punch.” Draco snorted, “You, on the other hand, looked like you were going to kill him.”
“That’s perfectly fine with me.” Harry smiled, “Send an owl in the morning to your parents and let them know what’s going on. I’ll invite my guardians.”
It was only after Ron left that Draco realised he never did ask the redheaded wizard what he was doing Muggle London. But that was something he could bring up the next time he saw the man.
“Of course, my shirt’s inside out. You almost gave me a heart attack.” Harry complained, he definitely did not know that his shirt was on inside out. It was annoying to think that Draco of all people would see him dishevelled like this. It was a hit to his ego, “The next time you call me, can you at least tell me what to expect.”
“I’ll let him have it.” Harry laughed, “Okay. Let’s go back to the main topic. Are you planning on getting married?”
“That bad?” Harry frowned, “Do you want me to pop by after your shift?”
“Sirius. We can all hear you having an existential crisis.” Draco yelled after him, “Do you want to talk about it?”
Draco was currently sitting on his bedroom floor.
Rubbing up against mine
“Oh, Draco! I didn’t know you would be here yet.” Remus said, the man seemingly appearing out of nowhere. Now it made perfect sense as to why Harry seemed to do the same thing, “Harry told me that you were going to be moving in and asked me to clean up a little before you got here.”
“Well. I think it’s a bit of a lost cause.” Draco snorted, indicating around the house, “Don’t worry. I’ll sort it out. It’s a surprise Harry doesn’t just use magic. It would make life a lot easier.”
“No. I think it’s about time. A whole year without magic is definitely enough.” Sirius answered, “But you don’t have a wand anymore, do you? It’s not going to be easy without a wand.”
“If you’re offering.” Harry smiled, “Do you know how to use the cooker?”
“You’re a numpty.” Draco groaned, trying to quell the fear of what the future might hold.
“I -I slept with someone.” Pansy sobbed, well that wasn’t too much of a surprise. When they were all single, they did enjoy the occasional one night stand, “Dray. I messed up. I was so drunk.”
“Do I get under your skin that much?” Harry queried, letting Draco take his hands in his own. His blood felt like it was on fire, he had never felt this way about anyone through touch before, “I’ll try to ease off.”
“I guess meeting me was just an added bonus.” Harry grinned, earning a light slap from Draco. This was something he could get used to, “Instead of looking for a place, why don’t you move in with me?”
But it was always a great feeling to gain new friendships.
“Well. He’s probably going to get the wrong idea.” Harry pointed out, “If you quit, he’s going to think that you’re quitting so that you can openly date.”
“Shit.” Draco whispered to himself as he searched the place for the paper that Harry had given him before he moved. When he eventually found it, it was five in the morning and he was sure that Harry wouldn’t appreciate being called at this time. And Draco wasn’t entirely comfortable using the Muggle device he had bought to communicate with his friends. In all honesty, he was beginning to regret this whole move.
“Yes,” she replied. “Are you uncomfortable with it?” Ron frowned again, shaking his head.
However, Harry is nearing exhaustion. He is so focused on the wall right in front of him that he fails to notice the strain of his magic spreading at an alarming rate throughout the castle. His mind is wrapped in the work. Whole corridors are being repaired, not just the one he stands in. The passing of time goes unnoticed by Harry, captured as he is by the magic. It is Malfoy who eventually tears his eyes away from the awe-inspiring event before him and notices how Harry’s eyes are closing, how his movements are getting clumsier and are slowing.
” to summon the plates. A tense minute passes.
“Leave this house!” Screeches a portrait on the wall. Draco jumps and screams right back at it. Harry rumbles a laugh beside him. He silences the portrait with another flick of his hand, which had moved onto screeching about tainted bloodlines.
He suddenly gets a flashback to Oliver Wood. All through their fifth year he’d been plagued by thoughts of the Quidditch captain, deep in concentration and bent over on his broomstick.
His magic is feeding off of his body to maintain enough energy for the immense feats it is performing. It desires power, it desires challenges. He slowly replaces the magic into his body and regains feeling.
Bitter tears fall. His sobs are quiet; he is well aware that his once-enemy sits only metres to his left. His magic is turbulent, shifting restlessly around his motionless form. The storm of magic surrounding him has become murky and black, isolating him from his surroundings. His feelings of helplessness and terror are magnified.
“Potter!”
An owl hoots nearby and breaks Harry’s concentration. Harry hadn’t noticed the darkness creeping in, too concentrated on his magic. Had he subconsciously been supplementing his eyesight? Curious, he takes off his glasses. He feels a rush of magic to his eyes and the surroundings gradually come into focus.
“Welcome to Grimmauld Place, the home of the Noble and Most Ancient House of Black. That there is the lovely Great Aunt Wallaburga, a blood purism fanatic,” Harry says with relish.
His lips brush your forehead in an affectionate kiss known only to loved ones. Your eyes fall shut for a moment as you imagine living your life by his side, dedicating yourself to him and him to you.
“Harry. It’s just Harry. We’ve saved each other’s lives, we might as well stop the last names thing,” Harry mutters. Malf- no, Draco blinks, then seamlessly continues. Must be the pureblood training.
The plates have returned, complete with crumbs and all. Harry turns to him and power glints in his eyes.
Malfoy suddenly turns his head towards a now-visible Harry, who has cancelled his Disillusionment charm. He slumps further into the floor. His magic is listless, pooling uselessly around his navel. Harry wouldn’t be surprised if Malfoy was having difficulty accessing his magic, as it was buried deep inside his body. Harry pities him, but it doesn’t cancel out the weight of the boy’s actions.
Harry preens. His curiosity is piqued as Draco’s question sinks in. Why hasn’t he explored his magic to the limit? Come to think of it,
Only then does he realise Malfoy is right: he
Harry and his magic were enthralled.
“Er, a hob? It’s how we cook, the muggle way. I’ve not had much practice with wizard cooking.”
Harry holds his ward and constantly masks their trail. The group aren’t able to hear the pounding of footsteps on their on the slabs, thanks to the strength of Harry’s spellwork. Then, Malfoy slows to a stop.
“Oh, Harry, Merlin, I’m so sorry! We were trying to get you and Draco together, that’s all! I shouldn’t have done it behind your back. I feel awful, Harry, really I do!” Hermione cried. She felt tears forming in her eyes. Harry was silent. “I was trying to get you to admit your feelings. It sounds so childish now. I didn’t mean to worry you,” she finished passionately. After a few tense seconds, Harry’s arms slowly opened, inviting her for a hug. She gladly returned the embrace and tried to muffle her sniffles in his shoulder.
Pansy’s heels announced her presence at the Gryffindor table. For nearly two weeks, she and Hermione had been hastily exchanging plans when they ran into each other in corridors. They had once tried brainstorming in the library - Draco and Harry had still been licking their wounds and had refused to set foot in the library, so they thought they were safe. However, Madam Pince put a swift end to their scheming, threatening to kick them out for a week. Thus, the library was out. They couldn’t discuss their ideas in the common rooms because Draco and Harry were there. Pansy had evidently grown sick of having to speak in-between classes, and had made the decision to finally visit the Gryffindor table. Perhaps Hermione’s bravery had been rubbing off on her.
She wiped her hand absent-mindedly on her skirt. The boy must have gone through a tub of hair-grease every day.
“I… I can’t, today, I can’t. I’m so sorry,” you sob. He shushes you like a child, pressing kisses to your hairline. You grab the crisp, well-ironed fabric of his shirt and hold on for dear life. You try to breathe deeply but his scent, usually so comforting, is too overpowering and your breath comes is shuddering gasps.
“A new start sounds nice,” Draco says. Harry’s smile softens as he pulls away slowly.
Harry silently curses, hastily covering his tracks.
Harry, still chuckling infuriatingly, finishes up and takes the eggs on toast to the table. Draco notices Harry has given himself the burnt one. He immediately begins speculating as to the reasons why. Could it be... that Harry had wanted him to have the nicest one?
His mind reels. Harry gave him the nicest one! On purpose! Draco can’t help smiling.
Harry sizes up his chances, takes one look at Malfoy, and they bolt simultaneously away.
“I suppose not.” He said cryptically. Her eyes narrowed playfully - Ron knew something she didn’t. He’d evolved to become far more of people’s feelings, she noted with pride. By this point, they had reached Harry in the Great Hall so she couldn’t press Ron on his strange reaction.
Harry isn’t going to let the small fact that no one has managed to recover vanished items before stop him. He closes his eyes and lets his magic swell. He imagines the lost dishes, the shape of them, exactly where they were. His magic fills the outline of them as he casts an “
tired. He sits down, leaning against the wall like Malfoy is doing just a few meters away. Tucking his legs in close, he tries not to think of the scarring events of the day before. His efforts, though, are fruitless.
Unexpectedly, it swirls around his body and starts to heal all the wounds it comes across. Harry, who was never very good at healing spells, is stunned into quiet admiration.
Not a word is spoken while you walk him to the door. Oddly, you feel almost as exposed with clothes as without. You have never felt discomfort under his gaze before. Merlin, probably because he ignored you when you said no! You’d never really considered whether he really had your best interests at heart before.
When he turns around, Draco is looking flabbergasted.
You feel the air, cold and harsh against your skin compared to the heat of his touches. You can’t bear to open your eyes, the darkness a comfort, a blanket of security. In the darkness, reality bleeds into fantasy. Draco never leaves in your fantasies.
“That’s not it at all, don’t worry,” she said, her voice softening. “I want them to be an actual couple; Pansy and I have been trying to speed them up.” To her surprise, Ron burst into laughter. She giggled through her confusion; Ron’s laughter was famously contagious. “So far, we’ve not been very successful,” she admitted. Ron hummed noncommittally.
The sound of gentle crying lifts his thoughts from their vicious cycle. Malfoy is crying. Waves of guilt wash over him as he is reminded of their ill-fated duel. Even so, the sound of Malfoy crying eases him out of his head and back into the present. Just before he descends into sleep, he sends a Cushioning charm over to a still-sobbing Malfoy. His thoughts are slipping away when he dimly recognises one being cast in return.
The golden sky blazes when you see him again. The last of the sun shines on his platinum hair like a halo. He smiles as you let him in. Again. You couldn’t say no to him if you wanted to.
“It’s trying to help you,” he calls out. Malfoy tries to open his mouth to snap a response but presumably thinks better of it. Harry drops the body bind.
He suddenly sees that Harry’s hands are glowing gold. He reaches out to touch them. They’re warm, and more calloused than his own. The level of magic stored currently in his palms makes them feel almost fuzzy. Harry suddenly notices the feeling of another holding his hand. He does a double-take but doesn’t end the contact. He looks at Draco who is still inspecting the magic present in his hands. Harry sends a little of his magic through their point of contact.
Harry’s magic is antsy and his palm is clammy. Harry half-heartedly calls on it to begin repairing the castle again, but abandons the idea.
Your friends look at you with pity.
Malfoy makes fleeting eye contact. “Thanks,” he says, consciously unclenching his jaw. Harry shrugs. He almost didn’t heal him after all. Harry walks around him and pieces the flagstones in the floor back together as he goes. This time, the process is less rushed. He takes care to ensure that everything is exactly as it was. As such, he’s only a few meters ahead of Malfoy when he says snidely, “You’ll need to do more than that to fix Hogwarts. Honestly, do you know anything?” Harry whirls around.
He takes your hand in his, leading you gently to your own bedroom. He never waits for you to offer, and why would he? Why would he when he knows you will always follow?
“Draco, you’ve got fluff on your shoulder. Let me just…” Harry mumbled, flicking it off. Aside from a tinge of pink in Draco’s alabaster cheeks, he didn’t let on that this was anything unusual.
His magic, replenished from the sleep he’d achieved, sings in his veins again. Malfoy falls into step beside him.
She was startled back into the present by a flurry of movement in front of her. Harry appeared to have dropped a note that Draco had passed to him. Flitwick squinted at him as he frantically rummaged around underneath his seat. Hermione watched as his glasses fell onto the floor, one of the lenses smashing with a tinkle. She muttered a quick ‘reparo’ under her breath. Harry whispered his thanks before shoving them back on and going back to his inspection of the floor.
be, if he wasn’t married to another.
side made. Go ahead, Malfoy,” Harry spits. His rage lingers close to the surface at all times. Malfoy is silent for a minute.
“What are you talking about, ‘this’?” Draco asks guardedly, his gaze not leaving the floor. Your silence is pointed, cutting through his charade like a knife through butter. You walk towards him and he backs away, jolting as he reaches the door like a wild animal cornered. You stop, open hands at your sides showing you have no desire to hurt him. He fumbles for the handle and wrenches it open. The hunted look in his eyes pained you but his return would inevitably break you. It had to end.
Harry’s back suddenly straightens from his slouch.
Fueled by gleeful curiosity, Harry funnels his magic into healing a tree that was felled by one of the giants. He sends his magic into it, and he can see and feel the tendrils of golden light pulling the tree back together. It fits every individual piece of bark back together, without so much as a line where the halves had separated. He regards his power with newfound respect.
“Is there something wrong, Miss Granger?” He asked. Hermione’s cheeks coloured as she stammered out a response.
He steps away.
“Did you see that?” She hissed.
“So, Potter, when did-” Malfoy is cut off by a tired interjection from his accomplice.
Eventually, he has the eggs sizzling away nicely and has located the butter, there is just the issue of the toast. Harry has settled instead with eggs on toast, having decided hash browns and other trimmings were a little too much trouble. For the eggs in the frying pan, Harry only has to do a localised warming charm. When it comes to the toast, however, Harry has to get inventive. He takes out a piece of sliced bread and, lobbing it in the air, casts another warming charm, this one significantly more powerful. His magic leaps at the chance to display its abilities and jumps out of him at full force.
“Oh.” Draco breathed, “Er. So I’m going to need your help? I’m not entirely sure how these devices work.”
But he wasn’t going to let Draco Malfoy know that.
“Oh. Sorry.” Draco laughed, “This book is in French. I sometimes forget how to alternate between the languages. So what can I do for you?”
“Of course Harry’s brash. He gets it from his father, and it’s not like you would have talked to him soon. You would have probably left it for a few months before talking to the poor guy.” Sirius pointed out, “It’s not like you guys can talk anymore. The dreams have stopped.”
And maybe his parents were right. There was something there from the very beginning.
“Draco. I swear to Merlin, if you’re pulling my leg I will end you.” Sirius warned, “Like if I turn up at Remus’ place and he has no idea why I’m there. I will actually hurt you.”
“What? I’m your favourite cousin.” Draco smiled, “And I can assure you that he needs a friend right now.”
“I found some baby albums and I thought it would be nice to show you.” Narcissa smiled, “But Draco is insistent that we burn the books so that no one can ever see pictures of him from when he was a baby.”
“What?” Draco was gobsmacked, “We’re not dating. What on earth gave you that idea?”
“Harry? Really?” Draco smiled knowingly, he didn’t know that Harry was helping his parents or others integrate back into their previous roles and lives. Draco couldn’t help but feel proud. Proud that they were friends.
It didn’t take long for them to prepare for bed. It was weird for Draco to have Harry in his bed. His let his fingers run down Harry’s hair. The blond was in awe.
Draco grinned at Harry before, sitting down. He played a few keys hoping to quieten down. And when it seemed quiet enough, he started singing.
“Hello?” Draco said cautiously, he still did not understand how the device worked without the help of magic.
Luckily being Harry Potter meant that he would literally be welcome everywhere. He hated it when he was younger, but as an adult, he realised life was a little better when you were given special treatment.
It was only when the girl pointed him out to Draco that the brunet decided to look a little sheepish at getting caught. The blond gave him a curious look before heading over to what Harry could only assume was the machine that was going to make a latte?
“Okay. I’ll get you all some food.” Harry smiled, “I’m going to check on Pansy and Blaise and see if they’re okay. But it looks like I’m going to have to take care of the lot of you. You're all a mess.”
“Why would you not want to pursue this witch that you have an interest in?” Draco asked, “Nothing’s stopped you before.”
They had been together for a few years now and in all honesty, it still shocked Draco that they had managed to last this long. This was the longest relationship he had ever been in and he kind of worried if it was approaching its bitter end. It scared him because he didn’t see how his life would be without Harry.
“You were on top of him.” Draco laughed, “You said you would kill him.”
He felt like he was in the twilight zone. That could be only the reason that Hermione Granger and Pansy Parkinson were currently sitting in the same room, talking like they were friends. Draco was horrified by the sight, he could only imagine what the two witches were talking about. He hated the fact that he had sworn off the use of magic because that meant that he had no wards or anything to protect his home. Hence why everyone seemed to think that it gave them permission to apparate into his apartment whenever they pleased.
“Don’t worry. Let me put that on your bedside table. You might get a little peckish later on.” Harry voiced, “I’ve got a house-elf to just make sure that you guys don’t choke on your own puke and end up dying. But I’ll be back in the morning to check up on you.”
“So you don’t want them to know that you speak parseltongue when I go down on you?” Draco commented, “Or that you’re a fan of a little rough play?”
“But you don’t have these socks.” Draco said firmly, stretching before slipping off the sofa. The blond disappeared for a few minutes before reappearing in the living room with a pair of red striped socks, “You can have these.”
“Your parents adore me.” Harry added, the longer they talked the angrier Andy was getting. The older man’s face looked more like a prune every minute, “Your dad actually visited me at work the other day and invited me for tea.”
“So what did you need help with?” Harry asked, looking around his place, “Do you need some help with unboxing? Or is it your phone?”
“If you want to believe that I picked that particular pair because you’re a Gryffindor, I won’t argue.” Draco laughed, “But in all honesty, I just picked the next pair in the pack.”
“Hmmm.” Draco moaned, “Harry? What are you doing here? What time is it? Fuck. I feel like shit.”
“Thanks. You’re a lifesaver.” Ron grinned, “Is around twelve okay? I’m not sure what time we’ll come to pick him up. But I’ll send you a note.”
“That’s basically what I said.” Draco confirmed, “But you can’t let anyone know.”
“And once she told you about that, you remembered that you did meet someone through a dream a long time ago.” Draco smiled, “You eventually shared it with her, and you both came to the agreement that it wasn’t fair on the three of you if you remained married.”
“Who’s this guy?” Andy frowned, sizing Harry up, “Your friend is a little defensive.”
“What makes you think that’s something’s going on?” Harry asked, taking a seat. This was going to be an eventful conversation, “Why did you never fully adopt me? Why did you act as my guardian?”
“I have you saved as a contact on my phone.” Harry said, before realising that Draco was a little lost at that comment, “I should have probably told you this before, but phones have address books built into them. That way you don’t have to memorise everyone’s number.”
“Yes, please.” Harry grinned, “I would like that very much.”
“Oh, Merlin. You could have at least told me you were getting courted.” Sirius groaned, shooting Draco a glare. The blond sighed before placing a bookmark between the pages of his book and setting it down, “I’m just going to head to my room. If you two choose to have sex, please have consideration. The walls here are really thin and it’s not exactly something I want to hear.”
“Because I am your guardian,” Severus answered flatly. He was giving Harry a very careful look before he continued to talk. The problem with that was Severus was going to know immediately that he was not in the right mindset, “And I did adopt you. Are you drunk?”
“Well, your name isn’t really common around here. So unless you want to explain the origin of your name all the time, I would stick to Drake.” Claire grinned, Muggles were definitely odd creatures.
“Why are you looking at my feet?” Draco frowned, tucking his feet under his legs so he was sitting cross-legged instead of lounging on the chair. The wizard had no idea why he felt so self-conscious about his feet. He just wasn’t used to anyone paying attention to them.
“Wait. If you didn’t figure out that Harry is in love with you, then what did you figure out?” Hermione frowned, seemingly confused by how the conversation was going.
“So you’re planning on leaving?” Harry questioned, “Where are you going to live? Back at the Malfoy mansion?”
“Christening the house? What does that even mean?” Draco frowned, “Is it some religious thing? Harry, I'm not a Christian.”
“You’re right about that.” Sirius laughed, “No better time than the present.”
Draco wasn’t sure where Harry had gone, but it was nice to finally take a break from the pictures. A glass of wine was everything that he needed right now.
“Remus Lupin is your dream mate,” Draco stated. He needed to know what went wrong between the two of them. The other wizard didn’t seem too torn up at the sight of Sirius, so Draco couldn’t help but wonder if Sirius was the one that was avoiding Remus. Something went wrong and Draco wasn’t going to fix it, “Does she know that? She’s a Black too so she should be aware of the dreams.”
“Oh. I see what you’re doing.” Draco started, “You’re taking the piss. Watch your back.”
“Of course.” The waiter smiled, “Your food should take be ready in about thirty minutes. I’ll have your lassi out in just a second.”
Red. That was the first thing Draco noticed. He felt like he couldn’t breathe. Harry was hurt.
“Cousin. Now, what kind of trouble have you gotten yourself into this time?” Sirius greeted, grinning like a Cheshire cat, “Narcissa and Lucius were rather insistent on us having a conversation. Please tell me this is not the sex talk?”
“Yeah, just get me something cheap. But no beer.” Draco answered, he hated beer with a passion. Blaise snorted before heading behind the bar to get Draco his drink. The blond tried to shake off the excess water on him, and he definitely felt like a wet dog because of it. His eyes roamed around the venue, it was no surprise that the place was empty. It was still technically closed. The sound of the door opening startled him, he wasn’t used to anyone being here at this time. He caught a glimpse of the man that came in and flushed heavily before turning away.
“What guy?” Draco frowned, trying to catch sight of the guy Claire was talking about. He searched the café before his eyes fell on familiar green eyes, “Yes. I know him.”
“Draco.” Lucius started cautiously, moving to sit beside his son. The older man put a hand on Draco’s shoulder, “Son, it may feel like it is the end of the worl-“
“Well. I’m sorry for trying to be a good partner and actually helping you with cleaning duties.” Harry snorted, earning a little laugh from Draco, “I thought you were raised with house-elves? Does that not mean that you should be pretty shit at cleaning and cooking? I was a little shocked when I found out you could actually take care of yourself when it came to things that weren’t Muggle.”
“Wow. You actually sound articulate for once.” Draco continued, earning a light shove from the redhead, “Really? I was complimenting you.”
“Fine. I’ll let you have that one.” Draco groaned, for some reason making Harry smile, “Oi. Who are you looking at like that?”
“No. I unboxed mostly everything.” Draco responded, before pointing at the kettle, “I need help on working that contraption.”
“Yes, we are.” Harry laughed.
“If you don’t shut up, I’m going to kick you out of the house.” Draco groaned. He was going to take a leap of faith. If he and Harry were meant to be, Draco would probably end up flying instead of falling, “We’re going to have to tell everyone that the courting has been accepted.”
“Don’t worry he’ll be okay.” Narcissa promised, “He has a strong pulse, and it appears that you’ve managed to close most of the wounds. But I still think we should take him to St Mungo’s. Just to make sure that he’s okay and gets the treatment he needs.”
“You don’t mind if a take a few shots do you?” A voice queried, Draco’s eyes met absinthe and he knew straight away that Harry Potter had somehow stumbled upon Draco without the blond even attempting to make an effort to gain his attention. Maybe he was going to get more out of this performance than what he originally expected.
“What? No. They’re clean.” Draco said, using his hip to push Harry out of the way. The blond’s eyes widened considerably as he opened the dishwasher, “Harry. Please tell me that you didn’t put dirty dishes in here.”
“Oh shit. Hold on.” Draco groaned, running to his bedroom, Harry could hear everything that he was saying. It was sort of weird, “Yes. I’m working. But it’s not until the afternoon.”
“I don’t need a wand.” Draco insisted, “I can do all necessary spells without one. I mean it’s just an instrument to channel magic. There are plenty of cultures that don’t use wands.”
“Okay. Well. I’ll see you tomorrow then.” Harry responded. He hated early starts, “I should get fitted, don’t want to embarrass everyone.”
“Tonks already knows.” Sirius answered, completely ignoring Harry’s previous statement, “She was the first person to find out. Remus didn’t feel comfortable with us dating without her knowing. But she saw it as something that was going to happen eventually.”
“Did you pick red because I’m a Gryffindor?” Harry asked curiously, as he accepted the pair of socks. Draco stared at him for a good minute before he started laughing.
“You fight dirty.” Claire complained, “I wasn’t planning on telling anyone. I mean you didn’t even have to tell me what you were going to do.”
“That’s only if the other party is difficult.” Lucius snorted,  “But I will discuss it with my wife. I will send you a letter and I will also have to address one to my estranged son.”
“Fried eggs, bangers, and beans,” Draco answered flatly, it sounded like a pretty heavy breakfast for 3am. But Harry was not going to judge him, “With buttered toast.”
Draco smiled, kicked the back of Harry’s leg so that the brunet would fall backwards. In response, the other wizard let out a very frightened yelp before Draco caught him by the waist. Draco stared at Harry’s face for a few seconds before closing in.
“Okay. I guess we’ll see you around.” Draco smiled, watching as Pansy detangled herself from Harry and pressed a kiss to his cheek. She then walked over to Draco and pressed her lips against his cheek too.
“Okay.” Draco agreed, he never realised that Harry was also struggling with the aftermath of Voldemort. The blond could not even imagine what Harry was going through. They were two separate sides of the same coin. Experiencing the same level of attention, but for different reasons. Voldemort really did ruin the idea of living normal lives, “I think I can do that.”
“Don’t be a dick.” Remus grinned, bumping shoulders with Sirius, “But maybe you should leave the planning to Draco’s parents as I am sure that you’re both ready to marry?”
And that was the beginning of how Harry Potter had become a well-needed constant in Draco’s life.
If Sirius had told him who his dream-mate was before this dinner Draco would have made sure that something like this would not have happened. The dinner hadn’t even started and it was already going to hell.
“What?” Ron snorted, “I can’t say that someone is good looking without having a crush on them? Draco may be good looking, but he has a shitty personality.”
“Hey.” Harry greeted, taking the seat opposite of him, “As you’re so insistent on living as a Muggle, I decided to pick out some sweets for you.”
“I am friends with Hermione Granger, so I do believe she should be able to help us figure this out.” Harry agreed, he honestly didn’t really think that it would burst into flames. He was going to make sure that it worked out between them. Draco was a part of his destiny, “So your father tells me that you are currently in France. But you and I are both aware that’s not the case.”
“And I’ll take the chicken tikka masala and I’d also like naan with it.” Harry smiled, “Can we both get glasses of mango lassi too?”
“Hey!” Harry greeted, beaming at the two of them, “Why are you looking at me like I just killed your cat?”
“I knew I should have killed them.” Draco groaned.
“Draco has a good point.” Hermione laughed, “We’ll pick him up around ten.”
“I want a holiday extension,” Harry said bluntly. He wanted as much time off as he could. Harry had enough money to retire, but he was sure he would get bored if he sat around doing nothing. He needed to figure out what to do next before moving away from Weasleys’ Wizard Wheezes, “Two weeks.”
“I’m sorry,” Draco said softly. He couldn’t even imagine what it felt like to be rejected by the person that you loved. But Draco had a feeling it was a big misunderstanding and once he found out who the guy that Sirius was in love with was, the blond was going to make sure that he helped his cousin out. It was the least he could do, “I’ll give love a chance.”
It took Harry a few minutes to realise that Draco was probably still stuck in his wardrobe and probably heard everything that Ron said. Harry cautiously walked to the closet, opening it. And of course, giving Draco the invisibility cloak, meant that Harry couldn’t see him at all.
“Of course not.” Draco snorted, “I have a pretty damn good team.”
“He has allergies to pork?” Harry asked, now it made sense why Draco only eats beef or chicken sausages, “Wow. You learn something new every day.”
“Doesn’t hurt to try.” Harry grinned, “If everyone likes me, they should like you too.”
“Everything’s spinning.” Draco groaned, “I can’t make it stop.”
“Erm... All the types of bread are good, but I personally prefer naan.” Harry offered, “But you have plenty of time to try all the others someday.”
“Of course.” Draco said softly, “That’s great. I’ll leave you to it.”
“She doesn’t know anything about the dreams.” Sirius responded, “Her mother was disowned. She wouldn’t have experienced the dreams because she isn’t considered to be a part of the Black family.”
“It’s not all Muggles. It’s mostly Muggle men.” Harry corrected, startling a laugh out of Draco, “So if your boss tries to hit on you. Just tell him you are already dating someone. And if it all goes to hell, you can always say that I’m your boyfriend and I can kick his arse.”
“We’re not dating. We’re friends.” Draco answered, “Yes. I can serve him. What did he want?”
It only took a few seconds for his parents to apparate into the apartment. His mother rushed over to Harry to check his pulse.
“Do what mate?” Ron frowned, the redhead was a little lost in the conversation, “It’d be nice if someone filled me in on what’s going on.”
“Thank you.” They both said in unison.
“Really?” Harry grinned, “I’ll just go get my stuff.”
“Get a room!” Ron yelled, making the two grooms laugh, “I get that your married, but keep the PDA on the low until the honeymoon. You’re making all the other lonely sods jealous.”
“Okay. As much as I do like this whole romantic thing going on. It’s kind of 360 of you?” Harry frowned, seemingly confused, “Are you okay?”
Even Harry knew that there was a high possibility that Draco was going to end up doing it again. Harry felt like a bit of a hypocrite as he also occasionally went on the piss.
“I’ll leave you two lovebirds alone. If you need me just yell.” Sirius said before pausing. He had a very calculated look before he started to speak again, “Actually. Don’t call for me. Goodnight my dears.”
“I miss her too, but I don’t think she’d be happy to see how I’m living.” Draco sighed, “I’m not exactly following pureblood traditions.”
“It’s a drink.” Harry answered, “I’m definite that you’ll like. It’s a staple drink to have with your curry.”
“No. I unboxed mostly everything.” Draco responded, before pointing at the kettle, “I need help on working that contraption.”
When he apparated into the apartment everything was clean and Blaise and Pansy were currently resting on an air mattress that took Harry forever to find. He didn't understand why it was so hard to source an air mattress, it was like no one used them anymore. And now that he was definite that Pansy and Blaise were fine and didn’t choke on their own sick, he now needed to make sure that Draco was also okay.
“Oh. You’ve got most of it right.” Harry smiled, before clicking a switch, Draco withheld the temptation to tell Harry not to touch the switch because he still had no idea what it did. But as the kettle spurred into life, Draco stared at it curiously. Muggles were confusing. And to think that he mocked their lifestyle previously, “So you see the switch? It basically turns the electricity connection on.”
“My mother gave you wine?” Draco repeated incredulously, “She really gave you a whole crate of wine?”
“He is a child.” Harry laughed, taking Draco’s hand in his own. It was moments like this that made Draco really appreciated that he took a chance on Harry. There would be no one else that would understand him. They were soulmates, “I think the peacocks would be a good idea.”
“Things like this happen all the time.” Draco sighed, “They’re practically unavoidable, it wasn’t entirely your fault. But I think you should go to him. Harry and I will watch Teddy.”
“If I didn’t know any better one would assume that you were talking to the air.” A voice snorted, it sounded very familiar. But Harry couldn’t put a face to the voice. The brunet turned around and came face to face with Lucius Malfoy, “Most people are in awe of being in my presence, but I guess things have to be been different for the infamous Harry Potter.”
“How delightful,” Sirius said from his armchair, he was reading a book. Draco was on the sofa reading another book, lounging languidly with a pair of glasses on. It was an odd sight to see the two sitting in the study together. Harry didn’t even think that Sirius spent his spare time reading, “You can place the gifts on the table.”
More pillows I could ever use
“A double.” The customer answered, “And no. That’s all I’d like.”
“Just now? I thought you guys were already dating.” Harry frowned, in turn making Draco snort out a laugh. It was a surprise because Harry did truly think that they were already dating with the way that Remus and Sirius talked about each other, “So now that you’re dating, are you guys going to mention it to Tonks?”
“I’m pregnant.” Pansy answered. Draco felt like the air had been knocked out of his body. What was up with his friends? But at least Blaise was in a relationship with the girl he knocked up. He had no idea what Pansy’s situation was, “It’s a Weasley.”
“Yeah. When you were a baby. You’ve basically lived off that whole thing ever since you discovered the whole wizard thing and in all honesty, you’re a bit of a prick.” Ron pointed out. He admired Ron’s honesty. But Harry felt like he had a very valid reason for being the person he was today, “What else do you have to say for yourself? You’re just like every other wizard.”
“Of course I put books down for people.” Draco argued, the number of times that he stopped reading because Harry had decided to suddenly appear unannounced was proof of that, “And I am not dating anyone.”
The tell-tale signs of someone apparating into his apartment made Draco set the book on the table. It seemed a little early for Harry to be back.
“I don’t know.” Draco responded, “I- He just apparated and collapsed.”
“Can you shut up.” Draco groaned, “And the both of you out. I want to enjoy my first day here alone.”
“Honey. I know that a fresh start is ideal, but you could have moved to another country like every other Voldemort supporter.” Pansy pointed out, “Things aren’t going to be so simple here. You’re going to have to get a job and-”
“Because you put it on the list. You know the one you gave me before I moved here.” Draco pointed out, “You didn’t even tell me what half the stuff on the list did.”
“I would have talked to him eventually.” Draco sighed. It wasn’t like he was intentionally trying to be difficult. But everything that Harry had done made everything difficult. He had barely been in England for enough time to already be courted, “Harry was brash for jumping into this without talking to me first. It happened way too fast.”
“It’s nothing to do with your current living arrangements.” Draco sighed, “And you can stay here as long as you need to.”
“It’s not an amazing job, but it’s near the house. The pay’s not that great either.” Draco sighed, he did not seem to be dejected by the job prospect. Harry could only hope that it would not be too bad of an experience, “The point of the job is to get out of the house and do something sort of productive. And I also clean the place every Tuesday, Thursday, and Saturday.”
“Yeah. I don’t mind at all.” Draco smiled, Teddy didn’t seem unsettled by him. So that was always a good sign, “Are his parents aware that I’m going to be watching him?”
“I never really ever found out what happened to Harry Potter after his parents passed away.” Draco admitted, changing the subject. It was a good opportunity to find out more about Harry from someone that he actually knew, “I’m assuming that you managed to adopt him?”
“I didn’t stop them.” Draco smiled, “They stopped because you became a reality. There was no point in dreaming of you when you’re already in my life.”
“That does sound like something Harry would do.” Draco sighed, “So out of curiosity, there has to be another reason why you’re here.”
“It’s not a problem at all.” Draco insisted, “If you two ever need someone to watch Teddy, or even your own children when you have them. I am here.”
“Block his number.” Hermione answered, “Pass me your phone and I’ll do it for you.”
“Fine. Just so you know, we expect a housewarming party once you’ve unpacked everything.” Pansy smiled, “You won’t get us out of your life so easily Malfoy.”
Harry, on the other hand, seemed confused by his friend’s sudden appearance. It was sweet to think that Pansy trusted Harry enough to let the wizard comfort her. His arms were currently wrapped around the witch.
“I was interested. But I didn’t see any reason to follow through with his crazy ideologies. You can be interested in things you don’t want to commit to.” Lucius answered, taking a seat on the armchair, “He didn’t manage to recruit me, your mother, or Severus Snape. So, all in all, he didn’t really have the strongest allies. He ignored the prophecy and got defeated by a baby. Not exactly the best thing to be remembered for.”
To think that Harry Potter was actually able to refer to Draco Malfoy as his friend was a little strange.
“It’s not something that no one knows. Everyone is well aware of how difficult Harry’s upbringing was.” Sirius continued, “And if you truly are sharing dreams. You should know this. Harry needs someone that’s going to stay, someone that will love him.”
I wanna see your masterpiece
“I was either. But I’m glad it was.” Draco laughed, he was glad that it wasn’t difficult, “Now let’s watch this little munchkin and hope for the best for those two.”
So be it.
“It’s not a problem at all.” Harry sighed, “You’re not a bad person. And I want to help. So, I’m thinking a bacon sarnie.”
“It takes time for him to be sexual with people.” Pansy tries to explain, “Like he needs to have a connection with them. Gender isn’t really that big of a deal for him, it’s all about the bond he has with the person. Does that make sense?”
“So that’s why you’ve been avoiding the Weasleys.” Hermione sighed, “No one is angry with you. Even Ginny isn’t angry with you. Sometimes things like this happen. That’s how life works.”
Draco Malfoy was cuddling with Harry Potter.
“Your father’s got his old job back.” Narcissa beamed, “Harry’s been working so hard on getting everyone to treat us equally.”
“No. You didn’t call me.” Harry laughed, “But I did get a call from Blaise telling me that they couldn’t find you and that you basically drank everything?”
“You must really care about her if you’re putting her needs above your own.” Draco smiled, “And I think you should let her decide for herself. Who’s this girl you’re pining for?”
“How was I supposed to know that you would do something like this?” Harry questioned, “You told me you only really drink wine. So I wasn’t really expecting this you to go on the piss.”
Draco liked to experiment with drinks and he hoped Harry had similar tastes because he was going to make him his favourite drink. They weren’t allowed to sell it as it didn’t follow company recipes, so it was something that Draco had often made for himself. When he was finished with the drink, he threw in a croissant onto a plate and watched as Claire’s eyebrows raised in an offended manner. Of course, the girl would have one less croissant to nibble on, but that was the whole point.
“Okay.” Harry frowned, walking over to the toaster, before finally taking notice of the smoke and smell wafting off the toaster, “Oh bloody hell! It’s burning!”
“You don’t seem upset by his decision?” Harry continued, but now it made sense as to why Harry had never met Draco Malfoy. They were probably around the same age, “Durmstang is the school to go to for the curriculum having an emphasis on the teaching of dark arts.”
“No. I’m not okay.” Draco admitted, he probably looked like a mess, he felt like a mess, “Harry could have died.”
“Fuck off! It’s our wedding.” Draco grinned, giving Ron the bird. Harry just continued to laugh, “If we really want to, we can fuck on the damn floor.”
“Thank you.” Draco smiled, they were currently sitting side by side. So it was a little bit of a shock when Draco pressed his lips against Harry’s cheek. Harry wasn’t entirely sure how to take the gesture, but during the time he and Draco were spending together, the blond had never seemed affectionate. Maybe Draco was an affectionate drunk. Only time would tell.
“Can we not talk about this.” Harry groaned, blushing brightly. The tips of his ears were red and Draco thought it was adorable. Damn it. He just loved Harry ridiculously, “We don’t have a voyeuristic relationship in that sense.”
“How? You’ve only been together for a month.” Draco pointed out. The blond didn’t want to turn around and see how Harry was taking in the news because the wizard wasn’t even aware of the fact that Blaise and Ginny were dating in the first place. Her being pregnant was going to be a shock, “Isn’t it a little early to start a family together?”
“I’m fine.” Draco insisted, “Are you okay? You know you didn’t have to do that?”
“No. I insist.” Ron grinned, well the redhead was going to get the shock of his life. It was better for them to get it out of the way now, rather than let it drag.
“I can’t tonight.” Draco answered flatly, “I’ve got work.”
“H- hello. Who is this?” An elderly woman responded, and Draco was definite that the owner of the voice was not Harry. For one thing, Harry was not an elderly lady.
“You expect me to trust a machine to deal with cleaning porcelain and glass?” Draco frowned, “I hand wash all my dishes, that way they’re guaranteed to be clean and won’t get damaged. The dishwasher is a good place to store dishes that are still wet.”
“Well if it’s any consolation, I definitely did not like Andy.” Draco said firmly, “The only reason I agreed to go on a date with him was that he was kind of charming, But there was no connection. I didn’t enjoy the date and we didn’t have anything in common.”
“Come on. I’m going to need you to sit up for a little bit.” Harry said, helping up. The smell of food made Draco salivate. It smelt so good. The blond couldn’t help but scarf it down, Harry let out a little laugh at the sight of Draco eating like a monster. He got through half of the foam food container before giving up.
“The bread. It’s stuck.” Draco stated, staring at the toaster. The knife beside the blond made Harry feel relieved that the blond hopefully did not attempt to use it.
“Moony.” Sirius greeted, there was a slight tremble in his voice but it wouldn’t have been noticeable to anyone else. Draco felt protective. From his previous talks with his cousin, he was aware of how Remus was still a sore topic. Draco couldn’t even imagine what Sirius was feeling now that he was actually face-to-face with the other wizard, “It has been a long time.”
“I am never drinking again.” Draco stated firmly, “My head is killing and everything is still spinning. I think I might be sick.”
“But knowing these two it’s going to take another few years to actually get them married.” Sirius teased, in turn making Remus laugh. The two wizards were everything Draco wanted him and Harry to be in the future, “Can you believe it? Gryffindors and Slytherins actually living in harmony?”
“Of course you can't just leave.” Lucius laughed, “The sooner you deal with this, the easier it will be.”
“No take backs.” Harry continued, “I think we’d have to alternate with the bedroom because you only have one room.”
“Jesus Christ. Can you just pay attention to what I’m saying at least once?” Ron hissed out, slamming his mug down on the table. Harry was startled out of his thoughts. It was moments like this that made Harry really wonder if having friends was really such a good idea, “Before you went to la la land, I was trying to tell you how we’re expecting a really important visitor.”
“How do you know that I was the one that helped?” Draco frowned, the nurse must not have known who he was, “It could have been anyone.”
“That is literally its job. It’s supposed to wash dishes, that’s the whole purpose of a dishwasher. I mean, that’s why it’s called a dishwasher.” Harry voiced, he still found it adorable that Draco didn’t completely trust Muggle devices, “Is there anything else that I need to know? Are you storing clothes in the washing machine?”
“Are you sure you’re not the one with the crush on Draco?” Harry queried incredulously, it was just far too odd for Ron to be complimenting Draco like this.
His cousin was still breathing heavily, but the rate seemed to slow down. Even though the wizard was shuddering, and tears seemed to find their way down his face, it was clear that he was getting better.
“I can feel your magical signature.” The healer laughed, “Mr Potter was lucky that he went to you. But let’s hope that he actually comes straight to us next time.”
“How did you find out?” Harry asked, “I actually came here to tell you about it. I was talking to Hermione about it and we figured that since Andy was sexually harassing you, he probably sexually harassed a bunch of other people too. Turns out the guy was abusing his power to get people to do favours for him. So we got him taken to court because it is seriously illegal.”
“You can use it to clean places that you can’t reach or even your drapes.” Harry explained, “Wait. How have you cleaned your place for the last few months?”
“I wanted to talk to Draco, but as you’re already here I guess I could kill two birds with one stone.” Ginny smiled brightly, “And I’m dating Blaise. I guess I forgot to tell you.”
“I hope I am.” Draco smiled, Teddy was a sweetheart. He could only hope that if he did have any children in the future, they would be as sweet as this one, “I hope I’m not being too nosy. But was there another reason why you and Tonks are getting divorced? It’s just, there’s no malice or hatred between the two of you and it’s practically unheard of when it comes to anyone that’s getting divorced.”
“I know.” Harry smiled. He loved his little family. He wouldn’t trade Severus, Sirius, or Remus. They raised him to be the person he was today and he would always respect that, “Thank you for coming here at the drop of a hat. I really appreciate it.”
“I think you’ve got the wrong message here, mate.” Harry cut in, he had been watching from the side. Just to see what would happen. But this Andy guy was seriously pissing him off, “You should back off.”
Okay. I know I was supposed to take a rest from this... But here I am.
“I am keeping secrets.” Harry admitted, “I will eventually tell you both about it someday. But I don’t think it’s the time to know. Everyone’s still a little fragile with the whole Voldemort thing and I don’t want to cause any problems.”
“They’re for Draco.” Harry grinned, the blond didn’t even acknowledge Harry’s appearance. But Harry was going to change that, “Courting gifts.”
“I second that!” Sirius grinned, the older wizard was drunk. Well on his way to getting there. He always liked using weddings and events as an excuse to get as drunk as he could, “As much as I love the both of you, I’d rather not see that.”
“I guess so.” Narcissa agreed, “But I’m just worried that he’ll forget everything.”
“Sorry. We can change the subject, but only if you promise me that you won’t continue to beat yourself up.” Harry stressed, “This is a new start. You need to accept the past and not run away from it.”
“It’s not an amazing job, but it’s near the house. The pay’s not that great either.” Draco sighed, “The point of the job is to get out of the house and do something sort of productive. And I also clean the place every Tuesday, Thursday, and Saturday.”
And that was the beginning of how Harry Potter had become a well-needed constant in Draco’s life.
“Suit yourself.” Pansy said flatly, it was clear that she was upset. The dark haired girl didn’t seem to understand that he couldn’t spend all his time with her, for one thing he was gay and there wasn’t going to be any other progression of their relationship. Draco knew that Pansy was attracted to him and was hoping for something more.
“That simple.” Draco sighed, “I’ll let you know what happens.”
Draco Malfoy had a doner kebab stuck on his face.
“Of course. I will see you around.” Lucius responded, “Good day.”
“No. He was really good.” Draco smiled, watching Teddy as the toddler spurred awake, “Looks like sleeping beauty’s beginning to wake up.”
“Come on. I’m going to need you to sit up for a little bit.” Harry said, helping him sit up. The smell of food made Draco salivate. It smelt so good. The blond couldn’t help but scarf it down, Harry let out a little laugh at the sight of Draco eating like a monster. He got through half of the foam food container before giving up.
“One day.” Draco agreed, “Can you imagine the day that I will announce to the world that you are mine? I don’t think they’ll take it too well.”
“You just hate birds.” Harry pointed out, which was true. Draco despised birds. Well, most birds. He liked owls. But pigeons annoyed him. The number of times a pigeon flew into him while he was flying on his broom was ridiculous. Those birds were suicidal, “I think we should put Malfoy Manor on the list.”
“Can you just kill me?” Draco repeated, letting out a pathetic whine. He was surely going to throw up if the room didn’t stop spinning. Why did he do this to himself? No. That wasn't right. Why did he let his friends do this to him?
“I think I might just have to pluck him away.” Sirius groaned, “But there is a high possibility that he will end up screaming bloody murder.”
“Oh, God. You really did set them up?” Harry realised, “She’s not pregnant is she?”
“I’m okay Tipsy, can you please notify my parents that I have arrived?” Draco asked, looking around the manor. It didn’t different to what he remembered. His mother would occasionally change the blinds and decorations to fit the more seasonal times. The tell-tale sign of his father walking to greet him snapped Draco’s attention to the other wizard. He didn’t look much older, but wizards didn’t really age greatly so it wasn’t that much of a surprise, “Father. How do you do?”
“Well. You’re an item, aren’t you?” Lucius frowned, “I would assume that an invitation to you would extend to Harry automatically.”
“He eats everything and he has no allergies. He usually sleeps around seven or eight pm.” Ron cut him off, “You’re almost as bad as Hermione when it comes to the whole babysitting thing.”
“You’ll definitely see us around.” Blaise grinned, “Call us if you need anything.”
Harry Potter had decided to make one of his unannounced appearances.
“I’m so frightened.” Harry snorted.
“I should go with you.” Draco insisted, “I need to be there for him.”
“I -I’m pregnant.” Pansy said softly, Harry paled considerably and looked directly at Draco. It was funny to think that the first person Harry would look to would be Draco. At least the blond could tell him that he was not involved in what happened between Ron and Pansy.
“I just thought I would pop in and say hi.” Harry said, “I haven’t seen you in a while and I just wanted to make sure you were okay. You haven’t been having any troubles with anything have you?”
Draco wouldn’t admit this to anyone. But his eyes did water a little at the sight of Teddy in tears. Draco was also a little attached to Teddy. It was going to be his little secret.
“No. They broke up.” Hermione announced, “I’m guessing Harry doesn’t know you’re gay?”
“It was you?” Harry frowned, “It’s your fault that this happened?”
“He’s been staying here for the last few days.” Harry answered, “What makes you think that he’s running away from his problems?”
“Thank you,” Draco said softly, collecting what would be his uniform. It was an ugly piece of fabric, but he wasn’t going to let her know that, “Why Drake? Why not Draco?”
“Yeah, that should be fine.” Draco agreed, “But I’m not going to let you make me dinner. Pansy and Blaise are still taking the piss out of me after you made everyone breakfast.”
“What should I get Draco as a courting gift?” Harry smiled, he felt so much better with the little pep talk from Severus. Maybe he wasn’t good enough for Draco, but that didn’t change the fact that he was given the opportunity to pursue it, “I haven’t really had the chance to talk to him properly.”
“Of course. Muggles have lived perfectly fine without magic.” Draco pointed out, “And this is better than having hexes thrown at me on a daily basis. I now have the chance to start a new life. No more pain or regret.”
“So when were you planning on telling me what was going on?” Harry asked. Draco was currently rearranging some things in his room so the question caught him off guard, “Did you seriously think I wouldn’t notice that there was something going on with Sirius?”
“Do not touch anything in the house,” Draco stated firmly. Another thing that Harry found adorable. The blond refused to let Harry do any cleaning because he was very particular about where things were meant to be, “You always put things in the wrong place and I need order in this house to survive. So please just leave the cleaning to me.”
Rubbing up against mine
“What are you doing here?” Draco frowned, he was glad that he could still talk coherently. But he was sure that he still sounded rough, his mouth felt like it was stuck together, “Did I call you?”
“What were you going to use it for?” Harry questioned curiously, “If you didn’t know what to do with it, why did you and Blaise decide to try it out?”
Rubbing up against mine
“I’ve been okay. How about you?” Draco queried, watching as Harry took a sip of the latte. The other wizard looked at the cup in interest, before turning his attention back to Draco.
“I won’t get into trouble.” Harry grinned, “I’m the boy who lived.”
“Oh. You really have changed.” Hermione smiled all knowingly, “I was wondering why Harry started to invest so much time in you. And now it makes perfect sense.”
“Pansy. I’m not dating Hermione.” Ron said, getting straight to the point, “I was hoping that we could try getting to know each other.”
After catching up with the blond in the short amount of time his break was, Harry felt a little better. It was good to know that Draco was doing good. It was also good to know that he still wanted his help.
“Draco. Freshen up, take some time to compose yourself.” Lucius added, “Your mother and I will take Harry to St Mungo’s.”
“They took away my nimbus.” Harry laughed, he remembered it like it was yesterday. He had never really ever seen Sirius or Remus as angry as they were that day, “I’m not going to lie. I was a little bitter about it.”
Draco let out a startled laugh before talking, “What do I have to do to get a date?”
“That’s not it.” Draco admitted, “I’m not worried about you telling him. But yes. I figured it out.”
“Well. Of course, I want to start a family with you. I don’t see myself have children with anyone else.” Draco said, “But not now. When we’re ready to start a family.”
“Then why did you buy a vacuum cleaner?” Harry groaned, “You seem to have everything under control without one.”
“You haven’t started a fire again have you?” Harry queried, looking for a shirt. The last time Draco caused a fire, Harry ended up with a pretty bad burn and that was because he didn’t have the extra protection of a shirt. He did not want to repeat the same mistake twice.
“Yes, I was raised with house-elves. But that doesn’t mean that I wasn’t taught how to take care of myself.” Draco pointed out, and it did kind of make sense, “We’re not uncultured pheasants. Do you kn-”
“I guess I’m not having toast,” Draco said softly, looking at the charred bread. Harry looked at the bread and Draco and for some bizarre reason that made him burst out in laughter. The brunet had never seen anyone look so forlorn over a piece of burnt bread.
“Sure.” Draco politely smiled, telling the customer the total and dealing with the whole cash register. After that, he made his way to make the espresso. It was one of the most simple drinks to make. Well, that’s what most people would say. But with an espresso, you had to make sure that the beans were ground correctly. If it was too coarse, the process would be a lot faster and would have a light taste. But if the grounds were too fine, then the whole process would flip around and it would take a lot longer.
“Dreammate, cute.” Sirius grinned, before giving Draco a serious look, “It’s you. You’re my dream mate.”
Hermione sidled over to Pansy as inconspicuously as she could.
The group are seconds away when Harry joins him in pressing himself against the wall. They’re close enough to see the light sheen of sweat on the faces of Dean Thomas, Kingsley Shacklebolt, and an Auror whom Harry dimly recognises. They pass the concealed teenagers and slow down, having clearly seen how damaged the corridor in front of them is. They turn around and begin to walk back.
he give up his family, his wife, his stature, all for you?
“How very Gryffindor of you to come up with these noble reasons after the fact. As I recall, some of our ideas didn’t exactly scream of caring about Harry’s ‘romantic experiences’. Remember the Veritaserum idea?” Pansy said with a shark-like grin. Hermione scoffed.
He sighs. “Alright, Potter. Do your worst.” Harry’s magic doesn’t even wait for the sentence to finish before it surrounds him, seeping into his every pore and healing everything it comes across. Malfoy shudders. The half-formed sneer falls from his face. The sensation of pure heat is intense, it’s almost too much. Harry can see the gold sandstorm of his magic sweeping in and around Malfoy's stiffened form.
You turn around. He is deeply engrossed in his thoughts, a frown etched into his face. It is baffling, how his demeanour changes. You used to feel like you were the only one who could help him out of his moods. That it was your duty to take his mind off his troubles and his wife until he was secure enough to start over with you.
“Hello,” Hermione said, momentarily lost for words.
Hold on, why is Harry protecting him? Malfoy did sort of help him to repair bits of the castle, he supposes. Also, he’s not really in a position to harm anyone, flattened against the wall in fright. Harry keeps the shield active.
“I could tell,” said Pansy, smiling. Hermione narrowed her eyes teasingly.
You can’t remember when the lines began to blur. Childhood best friend, to secret manhood crush, to a lover whom you loved but could never truly have. For years you took what you were given, never asking for more lest it was lost, until you finally couldn't say no. Snatched from you like your naïve dreams of – dare you even think it? – being loved in return.
“Is that so? Remind me what you’re doing to make amends for the mess
The kitchens are deserted. Harry goes to the cupboards and selects the ingredients for a full English breakfast. He leaves them all out and looks at them, stumped. Harry can’t find an oven. Draco is similarly at a loss. Harry, having had lots of experience cooking for his relatives, assures Draco that he knows how to make a full English breakfast, he’s just never had to do it without a hob.
In the immediate aftermath of the war, Harry isolates himself. He can’t help it - he needs space to breathe. Thoughts swirl in his head, vying for attention.
“Well, er, I should probably tell you this.” Harry said, looking anywhere but her eyes. “Draco and I have been dating for almost a month now.” Hermione stared.
She reached Draco and sat down with a harrumph. Draco was chortling uncontrollably.
“Why do you keep talking about me to Pansy?” He blurted out. Hermione snapped her head around, head clearing of her previous thoughts immediately. “You’re one of my best friends, so if there’s something wrong, just tell me and we can work it out.” Harry said. He dragged his eyes off the floor to meet hers. To her horror, he was welling up. She floundered for a response, taken aback by the sincerity and hurt in his words.
“Excuse you,” she said loudly.
“She provided me with quite the warm welcome, so we will have to agree to disagree. Won’t you give me a tour?”
“I would humbly suggest,” says Draco, “that you completely redo the wallpaper. That shade really hasn’t aged well. Also, I think we would both agree that those curtains also need to go. Sooner rather than later, I think.”
“‘Mione, have you noticed something different about Harry and Draco recently?” Ron asked hesitantly. Hermione frowned; Ron had made his ample acceptance of Harry’s friendship with Draco clear long ago, it was odd for him to sound so uncomfortable on the topic.
“These what you were looking for, Potter?”
He’s too tired. Too tired to have to deal with any of this. He’d rather curl up on the floor and sleep. Curling up, he achieves, but sleep is more elusive. The deafening noises from the war just won’t subside.
“Harry, you don’t have to do anything for anyone right now. You’ve killed the Dark Lo- Voldemort, you don’t owe the world anything.” Draco says, hoping he’s said the right thing. Harry says nothing. It could be Draco‘s imagination, but Harry's grip on his hand is infinitesimally tighter.
Harry is guffawing by this point. He is so full of mirth that he completely misses Draco’s slight annoyance at his ‘suggestions’ going ignored. That is until Draco puts his hands firmly on his hips. Harry sobers up immediately.
The door shuts after ten seconds. Five seconds later a tear trickles down your cheek, for your heart has left with him out into the world.
“What did you just say?”
Green light fills his vision as Harry shoots awake. For a few terrifying seconds, Harry is looking his death in the eye again, staring down the Killing Curse. He shakes his head to rid himself of the remnants of his fragmented sleep. When he surfaces fully from the memories of the nightmares, he realises his shield is still up. That’s unheard of - surely it should have dissipated by now. Harry wastes no further time and dives straight into exploring his magic. He gives himself a challenge and tasks himself to repairing Hogwarts. He Disillusions himself and walks back into the caste.
He’d put his feelings down to admiration alone. Harry flushes.
Draco, bemused, sits down primly at a table.
Harry drifts into consciousness. He scrambles to sit up, reaching for his wand - he recognises that voice. Several things come to his attention at once: memories of the war; that he no longer needs his wand for magic; and that Malfoy is looking just as bedraggled as he feels.
She and Pansy came to a halt behind a gap in the shelves that made for a good vantage point. They both watched with thinly-veiled glee as their friends were chased out of the library, exchanging mutual nods acknowledging the fact that they were both enjoying their friends’ abject terror. Harry simply ran, forgetting his things in his moment of panic. Draco opted for the most rapid, yet graceful speedwalk Hermione had ever witnessed. How he managed to preserve an air of dignity whilst speedwalking, laden down by both his and Harry’s book bags, Hermione would never understand.
Harry notices and stops giggling abruptly. “It’s really nice seeing you like this,” he says. His eyes widen before he hastens to clarify, “I mean seeing you happy. Erm,” he tails off.
Hermione spared a glance behind her to see Harry jump up, Draco a second behind. Pince towered over them, fire in her eyes. The look of horror Draco sported reminded her fondly of the time he was transfigured into a ferret. She smiled to herself as she broke into a jog - after all, one could never be far enough away from an enraged Madam Pince.
Eventually you force yourself to avert your eyes; you cannot bear to see what domesticity could be like with him.
The air where they are is musty and stagnant. There is something, however, about the magical signature that is imbued within the place that reminds him of Malfoy Manor. He cracks one eye open and regrets it immediately when a terrifying dust figure rises from the gloom. He shrinks behind Harry and prays fervently that Harry knows what he’s doing.
“No!” She squeaked, violently shaking her head. “I’m sorry!”
there a limit? Harry grins.
The Auror’s eyes widen. “Kingsley. Dean. Do not lower your guards,” her voice lowers to a whisper. “The signature has just been masked. We are not alone.”
Harry has had a lot of practice grovelling, mainly to Hermione after he or Ron accidentally insulted S.P.E.W, her project to increase awareness about the plight of house-elves. Draco lifts an eyebrow suspiciously but turns to inspect the lampshade. Harry breathes a silent sigh of relief.
The Auror hisses under her breath, something about an extremely powerful magical signature.
Draco starts, then eases into the hug and wraps his arms around Harry.
“A Malfoy, eh? How lovely. You wouldn’t believe the standard of the company I am forced to keep nowadays, blood traitors and mudbl-” she is cut off by Harry’s swift renewal of the charm.
“I saw who you were talking to. At the Gryffindor table. Care to explain?” He sneered lowly, clearly aiming for a threatening tone. Merlin, was that how prejudiced she used to sound? Embarrassing. Outwardly, Pansy simply smiled.
His magic decides for him and reaches out to engulf Malfoy. Malfoy scrambles away from him, looking horrified at the sensation. Harry feels the reverberation of his pain: there aren't any glaring wounds, he's mostly been mentally affected. He senses the Cruciatus curse. He can empathise. His magic labours to help his mind, insistent when Malfoy continues moving away. Harry walks forwards slowly. He supposes he must look terrifying, tendrils of magic weaving in and out without even a wand to conduct them. Malfoy halts as he reaches the section of the corridor that Harry hasn’t gotten to repair yet. He can go no further. He turns around slowly and prepares to fight, not accepting his death at the hands of the Golden Boy. Harry’s magic takes control and makes him stop, a subconscious body bind.
“Yes. They’re rather interesting, but confusing at the same time.” Draco admitted, “Hermione. I wanted to apologise. What I said back in Hogwarts was not right.”
“I wasn’t going to kill him.” Harry complained, “He hit you. What did you expect me to do? Let him get away with it?”
“Sure.” Harry agreed.
“Did Draco have anything to do with the two of you meeting?” Harry asked, “Like he didn’t set you up, did he?”
“Thank you for getting rid of a few unnecessary years.” Harry grinned, picking his cup up in a mock toast, “But I’m sure it’s not too bad if you don’t drink it all the time.”
“Jesus Christ. You really are barmy.” Ron groaned loudly, he was making his displeasure about the whole courting thing very apparent, “Have you never heard the phrase do not mix business with pleasure? Can’t believe you just met the guy and you jumped straight into the whole I want to marry Draco Malfoy thing.”
“Sure. I’ll be over in a bit.” Harry said. The fact that Harry was so willing to help made Draco question his credibility. What if the wizard was taking advantage of his misfortunes to tell the daily prophet about how much of a loser he was?
“Are you sure this is a good idea?” Pansy questioned, lounging on the sofa, “Life without magic isn’t going to be easy.”
“I knew there was a guy involved!” Pansy laughed, “I bloody knew it!”
Harry Potter went to bed with a smile on his face. And for the first time in a while, he actually slept peacefully through the night and didn’t suffer any nightmares.
“I know that now. I feel like death and I'm sure feeling like death is a lot worse than feeling like this.” Draco groaned, “You should have told me all of this before. This would have never happened.”
“Really mate?” Ron snorted, “The last time I went to stay at your place the both of you were very vocal. It was that bad that I considered just going back to my mam’s. Seriously have you guys never considered using a silencing charm while you have guests?”
“As funny as that is.” Harry started, “Please call me if you’re not sure how to use something. Something bad could have happened.”
Just the two of us and no sheets
Draco wasn’t sure he could deal with that.
“It’s a drink.” Harry answered proudly, “I’m definite that you’ll like. It’s a staple drink to have with your curry.”
“Can I talk to Harry alone for a second?” Draco asked his parents, the two nodded their heads and left the room. He had no idea how he was supposed to broach the subject, “My lease is running out soon. I’m not planning on renewing the contract.”
“So you don’t want to grow old with me?” Remus teased, “What happened to our vows.”
“Because you don’t know the full story. That’s why.” Draco answered flatly, “I suggest you let Ron talk. It’ll be enlightening.”
“Well. He’s a pure blood and why would he go for you if there are attractive guys in Slytherin like Blaise Zabini.” Ron voiced, “And that’s only if we assume he’s gay. But there’s also Pansy Parkinson and she’s not a bad looking girl either. I mean he has plenty of people to date.”
“Merlin. I would never do that.” Draco frowned, he was sure that Hermione had the best interests at heart. But that still did not mean that Draco agreed with her methods. Harry should have been able to share his ideas freely too, “If I ever do sound controlling or I’m just an absolute dickhead, please tell me.”
“I’m going to make it right.” Remus stated firmly, “If I only knew beforehand, I would have never done anything to hurt him.”
“Why on earth would they call it christening?” Draco snorted, “But that doesn't matter right now. How would you feel about having sex in every room of this house?”
Draco smiled at Harry as they made their way around the venue saying goodbye to their family and friends.
“You’ve always been ambitious. I’m glad to see that hasn’t changed.” Sirius laughed, “So your parents have also told me that you refuse to move back to the manor and that you are currently looking for a place to stay. How would you feel about moving in with your cousin?”
“The key word in that phrase is elders.” Draco grinned. It was always fun to annoy people, “If you’re older than me, you’re an old man.”
“Fine. Just so you know, we expect a housewarming party once you’ve unpacked everything.” Pansy smiled, “You won’t get us out of your life so easily Malfoy.”
“Because I don’t think she’ll be interested in me.” Blaise answered, “And I’m a Slytherin. I don’t deserve a girl like that.”
“That doesn’t sound ominous at all.” Remus voiced, “But I’ll let you leave it at that.”
“Harry… Do you not talk about sex with your friends?” Draco asked, “Because I know every single detail about Pansy and Blaise’s sex lives. Everything.”
“I’m not doing much. I have a job interview later and after that, I’m going to try to clean up the place a bit more.” Draco answered, looking around his apartment. Using his finger to wipe off non-existent dust.
“Ah. So does everything electrical work like that?” Draco questioned. He hated himself for having to resort to having to actually call Harry to help him. The blond looked at the clock and realised that it was only eight, “I’m sorry for calling you so early. Do you want some breakfast?”
“Okay.” Harry snorted, letting out a little laugh, “Is there anything else? Would you like me to get you some freshly squeezed orange juice with that?”
“Of course it’s okay. You’re family.” Hermione smiled, “And Ginny will probably be too busy concentrating on Quidditch.”
“I’m the boss.” Andy laughed, “And I’m only asking for one date.”
“That’s actually a good idea.” Draco grinned, earning an incredulous look from Harry. Of course, Draco would agree with his cousin, they were related after all. But still. Naming a cat, Cat didn’t appeal to Harry, “But Cathy, not Cat. It’ll be a homage to Wuthering Heights.”
“Ron. As in Ron Weasley?” Draco repeated, holy shit. He was going to have a heart attack. Last time he checked, Ron was in a relationship with Hermione. If Pansy was pregnant with Ron’s child, that could only mean one thing, “Shit. Pan. Don’t worry, I’ll clear this up. There’s always options if you don’t want to keep it.”
“You know it’s pretty frowned upon to live with your significant other without being married.” Draco pointed out, “My parents may have updated their perspectives, but I’m not sure they’re going to be open about this.”
“We told him it was a bad idea.” Lucius snorted, “But Harry insisted.”
“I sweep the floor first, then I use a mop to clean it.” Draco answered, “And the places I can’t reach, I just use a chair. Everything else gets either brushed down with a dust brush or cleaned with a surface wiper.”
“Remus Lupin and Nymphadora Tonks are getting a divorce.” Lucius supplied, taking a sip of wine. Getting a divorce was practically unheard of in the wizarding world, so Draco wasn’t surprised with his parent's reaction to it. But he was surprised that Remus and Nymphadora didn’t seem to beat up about it, “I have never heard of an amicable separation until today. It appears that there is no love lost.”
“Are you okay? You never used to care about changing in front of me.” Ron pointed out, walking into his room. The redhead stared at Harry in a way that suggested that he was trying to figure him out, “Does this by any chance have to do with that blond you’ve been pictured with?”
“Well. They don’t matter.” Harry grinned, “Because it’s not their relationship.”
“That’s all in the past now.” Hermione stated, “I still think we can be great friends.”
“Why do I feel like I’m in trouble?” Harry frowned, “The nurse did just say that you did everything perfectly fine.”
“I have no idea what’s going on.” Harry voiced, “But I don’t want to know.”
“I’m glad.” Harry finally said after being silent for a few minutes, “If Hermione likes you, it’ll be easier to ease the Weasley’s into liking you too.”
“No. I am fluent in French.” Draco corrected, “But I wasn’t aware that you knew that I was fluent. I’ll give these books a read in my spare time. I- I hope you don’t mind, but I do prefer to talk about books. There aren’t that many people that I know that enjoy reading and I don’t want to impose-“
“What’s that supposed to mean?” Harry asked, rather offended by the statement. Harry did not like whatever Ron was implying. Draco would clearly look at him twice.
“Harry darling, how many dates have we been on?” Draco asked Harry, he hoped that the brunet would catch on to what he was trying to do. It was Harry’s idea in the first place.
Harry was not going to let him get away that easily. The brunet glanced at the twins before he made his way out to follow Draco Malfoy. It felt like the blond was expecting him to follow him, Harry managed to crowd him into a wall. There was no exit. They were going to have to talk about this weird dream thing.
“I’m surprised you still haven’t asked me why I’m staying here.” Sirius grinned, “Could it be, that you actually like me?”
“No there is a reasonable explanation,” Narcissa stated firmly, taking a seat on the arm of Lucius’ chair. It made Draco feel kind of envious that his parents were still so much in love. It wasn’t something he had really ever experienced with his own partners, “It’s part of being a Black. Our dreams spill. You managed to create a connection with Harry, and I have no explanation as to why and how.”
“You do have a pretty face.” Ginny agreed, “But what did you want to see me about? You’re not the type of person that would drop by for a friendly visit.”
“He wanted a latte.” Claire recalled, “Just a regular one.”
“Huh? Then what was bothering you?” Sirius questioned, “This entire time I was thinking that you were uncomfortable around me because I may have kissed your father back when I was young. This was way before you father married Cissy.”
“See you tomorrow. Have fun.”
“The dreams,” Draco said incredulously, it was now beginning to make perfect sense the reason his parents were so accepting of Harry Potter. They were the ones that had somehow linked Harry to him. Draco moved away from his mother’s arms before taking a seat on the chair opposite of his father, “Now the two of you have better have a good explanation as to what you thought you would gain from connecting my dreams with Harry.”
He doesn’t kiss you, but noses at your jawline, your neck. You do not bare your neck, nor do you respond verbally to his attentions. It’s easier to remember he doesn’t need you like you need him when he doesn’t kiss you. You meet his eyes and he is worried, worried you’re not playing along with your usual soft smiles and cheeky remarks. You force your gaze away from his icy stare before he can read you further. As a distraction, you fumble with his shirt. He tuts under his breath before transferring your hands to your own shirt. You should have known better; you must always be the first naked. You hate that bloody rule. It makes you feel so helpless.
Kingsley immediately begins casting anti-shield charms. Dean, whose knowledge of concealment spells is considerable after his experience in the war, joins him.
Harry considers the cause of the confusion. Apparently, he said the last bit out loud.
Once more he is walking towards his death. The grim acceptance of his fate washes over him again. He is drowning, unable to pull free from memories no one should ever be subjected to.
When there are no more people in the corridors he walks through, he starts to heal Hogwarts and help it to heal itself. His magic can sense its grief and disarray. The castle lends him some strength, sensing he’s intent on rebuilding. While he’s healing the castle one brick at a time, he realises that with the strength the castle has given him, he can repair whole sections of the walls at a time. It’s cathartic. Shattered segments are moulded together again under his enraptured gaze.
The group walk briskly into view. They make no visible signs that they have seen himself or Malfoy. Malfoy lifts a brow. Are they… invisible?
Draco’s eyes suddenly meet his. “Harry, what are you thinking about?” Harry panics and retracts his magic. The corners of Draco’s mouth twitch. “Your magic reacted strongly, whatever it was,” he says, the picture of innocence. Harry scowls and drops his hands. He had felt the beginnings of excitement in his navel and guessed Draco must have felt it too.
“We will see.” Sirius sighed, he seemed to be better, “I guess we should go back in. I’d grab any bottle of wine.”
Not only did Draco find himself, he found Harry.
“That easily?” Draco frowned, “Are you not going to hex me? Or make me do something?”
“Claire? Of course not, she won’t stop eating the bloody croissants.” Draco complained, “Why would you think that I would want to date her?”
“TMI.” Sirius groaned, in turn making the wedded couple laugh, “I don’t need to be hearing anything about your sex lives. Ever.”
“My darling boy. Before we continue this whole courting discussion, I would like to say that I did miss you.” Lucius grinned, “You never really made it easy to contact you. And Harry Potter, he is a rather endearing wizard. I didn’t see any reason to reject his intentions on courting you. If you do not fancy him, you can always reject his advances. We as your parents are not bartering you off like a horse.”
“So where did it go wrong? What happened that made you think that it wouldn’t be possible?” Draco asked curiously, “What aren’t you telling me?”
“W-what?” Draco spluttered, “You’re an idiot. Can you get this over and done with already. This is going to painful.”
“Marry me?” Harry asked, taking Draco’s hands in his own, “Spend the rest of your life with me.”
“I love you too.” Draco smiled, “But that doesn’t mean that you’re not a dick.”
“Then I’m definite that he’ll be fine.” Pansy stated, “If he had you, one of the top students in Hogwarts, looking after him. Then he’ll survive.”
“You’re an okay looking guy.” Ron muttered, “But Draco is kind of ridiculously good looking. If I didn’t know any better, I would have probably thought he was part Veela.”
“No. Definitely not.” Draco snorted, looking around Harry’s house. It was a family home and most people often asked Harry if ever felt lonely, but he didn’t care that much for people. He preferred to have a space to himself, “Maybe you should consider getting a pet.”
Just your feet rubbing up against mine
“You know there’s nothing to be ashamed of, right?” Harry commented, “We can go get some food at the place you mentioned. But you can’t always eat out. So I’ll show you how to cook some simple meals.”
“Yes, Lucius Malfoy is my father.” A voice cut in, “And yes, Malfoys and Weasley’s are not supposed to get along. But I’ve never been one to keep up with family traditions.”
“Thank you.” They both said in unison.
“Of course I wanted to take the guy down.” Harry growled, “The guy punched you in the face. I wasn’t going to let him get away with harassing and hurting you. That isn’t right. A friend doesn’t let something like that happen to their friend. I mean if Pansy was going through something similar you probably would have done the same thing.”
“I guess I’m not having toast.” Draco said softly, looking at the charred bread. Harry looked at the bread and Draco and for some bizarre reason that made him burst out in laughter. The brunet had never seen anyone look so forlorn over a piece of burnt bread.
Harry turned the dial to the toaster, to the lowest and watched as the bread pitifully jumped out of the machine. It was clearly a little too late as there was no way to salvage it.
“No. But there is something that I don’t want to talk about.” Draco said, making Blaise laugh.
“Ugh. Going on the piss? Is that what it's referred to? No wonder people feel awful." Draco complained, “I’ve learnt my lesson. I’m never doing this again.”
“Ah. So you do know how this works.” Draco frowned. He had heard of elderflower wine, but he had never had the opportunity to try it. And wine and chocolates sounded really good right now. But there was a catch to the whole gift, “If I accept your courting gift, that will mean that I am allowing you to continue courting me.”
“Thank you.” Ron thanked, “You’re really doing us a huge favour. We haven’t been able to get that much time to ourselves lately with our new jobs.”
“That can be arranged.” Draco smiled, standing up. His fingers lingered on the arm of the chair before approaching Harry, “But not tonight. I need to cool off.”
The telltale sign of someone apparating into his place could only mean one thing.
“He stopped using magic in his house just to see how you would feel.” Remus smiled, “Rather romantic, don’t you think?”
“That’s the reason Hermione broke up with you.” Harry snorted, “Don’t speak with your mouth full. It’s disgusting.”
“Fine.” Draco agreed, he didn’t really mind the idea of getting married at his childhood home. And it wouldn’t be that bad if only close friends and family were invited. The sound of a door opening drew him away from his thoughts. The sight of Remus Lupin in the house was always amusing. The older wizard was always sheepish and always tried to avoid running into them because Harry and Draco would always give him a knowing look, “Should we expect my cousin? Or is he not decent?”
“Okay. But after you’re done taking pictures of me, I expect you to buy me a drink.” Draco stated firmly, getting set up. He wasn’t going to let the photographer get away from him.
“Does telling yourself that make it easier to go to bed at night?” Blaise teased, “In all honesty. We don’t know what would have happened. But I’m almost definite that he would have died.”
“Maybe we shouldn’t christen the house.” Harry said offhandedly, “I mean there are a lot of rooms in the house.”
“Harry, that’s not the problem here. It was pure luck, anything could have gone wrong.” Draco explained, “I’m not a trained healer.”
Soulmates.
“I guess we are.” Draco beamed, kissing Harry’s lips. He absolutely adored him, “Let’s this get out the way?”
“I guess so.” Draco affirmed, “We are rather friendly, aren’t we?”
“I’m going to make some breakfast. Something to hopefully make you all feel a little better.” Harry snorted, “If you’re drinking make sure that you don’t mix different alcohols. You’re just going to feel like shit.”
“Fucking hell. ‘Mione was right. You really do have it bad for Draco.” Ron frowned, “Can you at least let this blond down nicely? I mean I wouldn’t want to explain to them that you’re using them because they remind you of someone else.”
“We’re not dating. It seems that everyone other than ourselves thinks that we’re dating.” Draco insisted, “And I can tell by the way you look at him.”
“The both of you are ridiculous.” Sirius commented, “Draco, I know I said I planned on staying here for the week. But I’ve changed my mind.”
“I knew I could count on you darling.” Narcissa laughed, shooting a playful wink to Draco. The blonde then turned to Harry and fixed him with a stare. She was going to keep the others busy while they tried to help Sirius, “Now Harry. What do you do? I think it’s time we learnt more about each other as you’re going to be family now.”
“Oh, Merlin.” Draco breathed, “Is there a way to fix this? Well, make it a little better.”
“What on earth happened last night?” Sirius asked curiously, “Teddy’s gotten rather attached.”
“I think I’m the exact opposite of what Hogwarts needs.” Draco snorted, “How have you been?”
Harry turned the dial to the toaster, to the lowest and watched as the bread pitifully jumped out of the machine. It was clearly a little too late as there was no way to salvage it.
“And that’s why things take forever.” Sirius laughed, “Because they can never decide.”
“You look bloody awful.” Pansy said, startling a laugh out of Draco, he appreciated the fact that she was honest with him, “But that doesn’t matter.”
“I will.” Harry smiled, watching as Remus apparated out of the house, “Merlin, Draco. I didn’t even have to say anything. I wasn’t expecting it to be that easy.”
“You haven’t started a fire again have you?” Harry queried, looking for his shirt. He didn’t want a repeat of last time where he showed up without a shirt and left with a nasty burn.
“Well. Not all the time.” Blaise laughed, “Sometimes I’m my own wingman. I’m a charming Italian man with ridiculously good looks.”
“Goodnight.” Harry smiled, helping Draco to his bed and making sure he was comfortable before apparating back to his own house. He was sure Draco would appreciate the water and paracetamol in the morning.
“You. The boy who lived. The wizard that defeated Voldemort. Admire me?” Draco snorted, “There’s nothing admirable about me.”
“Shit.” Harry said to himself as Draco apparated away. The blond was to be the death of him. He was equally as infuriating to Harry. But he wouldn’t have it any other way.
“What?” Draco frowned, both his friends were having children with Weasley’s? What on earth was going on? He was in shock, “You slept with a Weasley and now you're pregnant.”
“So that’s what you did.” Sirius voiced, “You spoilt him with kindness! You made him fall in love with you!”
“Oh, dear Merlin.” Sirius guffawed, “You don’t even know what you’re doing. You know what. Just forget it. I’m sure I’ll be able to stay at Remus’ place tonight.”
“Hey, Drake. There’s a guy that’s been staring at you for a while.” Claire pointed out, “He’s kind of cute, do you know him?”
But I just wanna talk
“Fine.” Draco agreed reluctantly, “But if there are any changes, I want you to call for me. Straight away.”
“How on earth are we making you feel nauseous?” Draco complained, “We’re not doing anything remotely nauseating.”
“Lucius, I would prefer it if you just called me Tonks.” Tonks smiled, “And yes, we both agreed it would be for the best. Remus will have custody of Teddy, and I’ll go back to doing what I love.”
It was a good thing that Draco could work under pressure.
“Of course I did! It’s a dishwasher!” Harry responded. It didn’t make sense for Draco to be reacting that way, unless he was using the dishwasher for a completely different reason. And for some reason, that wouldn’t even phase Harry. The brunet had already witnessed the weirdest things while living with Draco. Nothing shocked him anymore, “What on earth do you think it’s used for? Storing dishes?”
“Cissy, we should get going before you embarrass both the boys.” Lucius snorted, “They’re both grown men.”
Draco couldn’t imagine a life without Harry.
“We just got engaged. Give us time to enjoy it.” Harry laughed, “But I’m happy to marry whenever Draco is.”
“Of course it was going to be something that would eventually happen.” Draco smiled, “The chemistry between the two of you was crazy, and I’m surprised you didn’t hook up a lot earlier.”
Harry sighed in relief and turned to check on Draco. The blond’s arm was resting his arm on his waist.
“That’s exactly why we’re here.” Pansy grinned, “Hermione tells me that you haven’t been able to finish a book in quite some time. Which is kind of surprising considering the fact that you’re a bookworm? You finish lengthy books in a day.”
When he was sober enough, he was going to murder Pansy and Blaise. It was their fault he was in this state. Draco was not even sure if he had experienced being this drunk in his lifetime.
“It’s not like you would understand.” Harry snorted, earning a glare from his friend, “What? It’s not like you’ve ever dated anyone in the long run. Your longest relationship was with Hermione and that didn’t work out well.”
“I’m sure we’re both going to lose.” Blaise agreed, “But let’s just try it for the hell of it.”
“Dray. That’s only if you’re a high class escort, and from what I’ve seen. You’re barely managing to keep up with the costs of a shitty flat.” Blaise snorted, earning a heavy glare from the blond. Draco withheld the temptation to say something as equally shitty back and instead finished his drink.
“Look at me Draco. Do I look like I pursued the person I was dreaming with?” Sirius asked, “You always have a choice. But don’t think that dreams are forcing feelings. You know who Harry is, you’ve done things other than sex. You’ve probably talked and shared secrets. Don’t you think it’s time you let love win?
“Okay. That’s it.” Draco started, “The both of you, out now. Everything is fine, tell Harry that if he wasn’t to drop by, he can. And my work hours have been a little hectic lately.”
“I actually have no idea what he’s talking about.” Harry said sheepishly, “But I can confirm that he did talk to Remus.”
“How do you know that I’m in love with Remus? I never told anyone.” Sirius frowned, “Well. The two of you are dating so it would be pretty awkward if you weren’t in love.”
“I- I actually don’t.” Draco frowned, this was ridiculously embarrassing. If Draco could crawl into a hole and disappear, he would. Anything to not have to deal with this embarrassment, “But there is this place just around the corner. I’ll pay.”
It took little persuasion for Harry to follow Severus into the kitchen. Being a potions master made Severus’ food impeccable. And Harry was never the type to reject food. It was one of the things that he felt people took for granted.
“You’re a little early.” Blaise sighed, “You’re shivering like a dog, do you need me to get you something before you perform?”
“Harry, I didn’t exactly force them to have sex.” Draco defended himself, “I just helped push them along. Well, I didn’t push them to have sex, but I did suggest that they date. Can I just repeat that the whole sex thing was them and not me?”
The meal was great. Harry didn’t actually think that Draco would be able to handle the spiciness of the food and was actually hoping to see the blond turn red. But as usual, Draco managed to surprise him. He enjoyed his food and was surprisingly nice to everyone in the restaurant. It was weird to think there was a time that Harry thought that Draco didn’t know the concept of being nice. But he was glad to be proven wrong. The brunet couldn’t wait to see how Draco would surprise him next.
“Er. Hi?” Draco offered, trying to get his features to settle. He was sure he had the appearance of a deer caught in headlights.
“I call it the strawberry shortcake. The sweetness subdues the bitterness.” Draco explained, “It’s probably really bad for your health.”
“Draco wants to be a potions master?” Harry asked, peering at Draco curiously. They hadn’t yet had the chance to talk about this. The blond hadn’t even broached the topic that he was planning on re-entering the Wizarding world, “I think it’s a good idea if that’s what he wants.”
“It’s a good idea.” Narcissa added, “Maybe it’ll help Draco with his potions. If he’s planning on selling to Apothecary’s, he’ll be knowledgeable about side effects and what not.”
“Okay. I get it.” Andy grounded out, “You could have just told me that from the very beginning instead of stringing me along.”
“Of course.” Lucius agreed, giving Draco a knowing look. Draco was tired of all these looks now that he finally knew what they meant, “So Harry, how do you feel about chicken. Draco’s always been so particular about his meat.”
Harry Potter went to bed with a smile on his face. And for the first time in a while, he actually slept peacefully through the night and didn’t suffer any nightmares.
“I don’t know if I should tell you.” Blaise started, Draco couldn’t help the stern look he gave his friend. If Blaise got to know everything about Draco, then Draco should also know everything about Blaise, “Okay. Don’t laugh. But it’s Ginny Weasley.”
It was not okay. Draco had no idea where this burst of optimism came from, he was usually a realist. But as soon as Harry was involved, he wanted the best outcomes. Andy didn’t appear to upset that Draco was handing in his resignation letter. If anything the man appeared to be happy. Maybe Harry was actually right. The man has his own warped idea of what was happening.
“Of course not. I was sent to Azkaban. I may have been acquitted, but my sanity was of great debate and they refused to let a toddler be in the company of an insane man.” Sirius explained, laughing bitterly. Draco could not even imagine getting wrongfully convicted of a crime you didn’t commit. Especially with being framed by someone Sirius considered a good friend. Draco wouldn’t be surprised if the wizard had trust issues, “Severus adopted Harry. He made sure to prove that the muggles that were raising him were a bad fit. They were abusing the poor kid. He was living in a blood cupboard underneath the stairs. It wasn’t until he was about eleven that he was transferred into Severus’ care.”
“What kind of food did you bring?” Lucius asked, changing the subject, seemingly unfazed by the fact that Harry was a regular visitor, “I hope you don’t mind if we try some?”
“Yes. I’m more than okay.” Draco confirmed, “Shall we open the wine?”
“I will do.” Draco grinned, “He’s worried about ruining your Quidditch career with his name and status.”
“It’s not even messy.” Harry pointed out, also looking around the place. It was clean, too clean for a single man living by himself, “What job are you interviewing for? Is it somewhere near? Is the pay good?”
Draco Malfoy was calling him at bloody three in the morning and Harry sure as hell hoped that the blond was calling him for something important. But knowing his luck over the last few days, it was going to be something stupid.
“You want me to be the Godfather?” Draco repeated, “I- I guess that’s okay. I guess I’m the Godfather.”
“No. That’s not a problem at all.” The man smiled, “I was just hoping for an espresso.”
Just the two of us and no sheets
