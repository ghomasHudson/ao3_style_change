Harry surrenders and gets up. He stalks over to Malfoy and sticks his hand out. “Hi,” Harry says in a forced polite tone.
“Petrificus Totalus!” Hannah yells while the man is distracted trying to disarm harry. Hannah’s hex hits him straight on and he’s down.
Not this chapter being a day late,,, oops. Anyway thanks so much for reading! Don't worry, more Draco is coming next chapter! Comments would be lovely <3
It was never something he wanted, Harry realized a couple of months back when he had done nothing but paperwork for three weeks in a row. It was always something he had felt he had to want. To impress Lupin maybe, to serve even after the war perhaps. He can't pinpoint a reason that his fifteen-year-old mind would have come up with.
“Hang on Mionie, I’ve got it.”  Harry casts a cleaning charm at the stain, or at least, that’s what he tries to do. The blouse turns from its original gray color to now bright pink, the stain is still there.
“Because we like him! He’s changed so very much Harry if you could just give him a chance! He’s kind and funny and rather charming.” At that Hermione blushes slightly much to Harry's great disgust.
“Look you need to either find someone who you genuinely want to start a relationship with or find someone who wants the same things as you… preferable both actually.”
So the music coming from inside can’t possibly be Theo unless he’s upped his game of trying to get Harry to admit that they’re boyfriends or something. Harry slowly unlocks and opens the door with nothing driving him forward but his curiosity. He quietly takes off his coat. Hangs it on the hook next to the door and draws his wand, just to be safe. He creeps towards the sitting room slowly, as if not to disturb some wild animal that may be in there, listening to his records.
“I don’t think it was me,” Herminie gives him a disbelieving look, “I mean, I think it was my wand.” Harry clarifies. “It did something weird the other week too while I was training, I think there something wrong with it.”
“We both know you don’t, I don’t know if this is some resentment thing because I’m a Slytherin, or my involvement, or lack thereof, in the war, or the fact that you’re simply just not interested in me beyond sex. But I’m very interested in you, beyond just sex. If you tell me right now that this can be more, great, I’ll have this fight with you, and we can work it out, if not, then its simply not worth it and I’m done.”
The whole department has been on this case for a month, it was nothing too exciting, your average illegal potions smugglers bust, they have been tracking this group for some time, finally, they have them at an easy target.
“You- you have something for me,” Malfoy repeats slowly as if Harry’s speaking a new language he’s trying to understand.
“Harry I- oh, you’re moping again,” Hermione says as she enters the bedroom. “Listen I’ll be out of your hair soon, I  just came by to see if we’re still on for dinner tomorrow at the burrow.'' She keeps talking as she walks over to Harry and kisses both of his cheeks in a quick, distracted hello.
“Oh, hello Potter! I hope you don’t mind, Theo invited me over for a beer. He went to grab a quick shower so I took a look through your collection. It’s quite impressive, I adore this record.” Draco says with that ridiculous posh drawl.
Harry is glued to his spot in the doorframe of the living room, unable to move. His mouth moves before he can formulate a single thought.
They arrive outside of a large, seemingly abandoned, barn house in the middle of nowhere. The building looks rustic and its graying-red color is washed out by the overcast skies. Robards is there giving orders to the ten Aurors already there. Ron and Theo had already been given their station, Harry and Hannah are stationed directly in front of the barn, to the right of Ron and Theo.
Harry mauls this over as he heads back to the office, trying to choose between his pride and spite or his ability to perform magic. It’s a difficult choice.
Malfoy says nothing for a long time. Just looks. Looks at the wand that sits in Harry's hand. Malfoy has gone so still that Harry almost thinks that he’s somehow passed out, standing up with his eyes open. But then slowly Malfoy reaches for the wand and takes it, brushing his long fingers along Harry's palm as he does. Harry suppresses a shudder.
“Look I should be going anyway,” Malfoy starts, sensing that Harry is on the verge of either punching something or screaming. “I’m sorry if I’ve intruded, you have a lovely home, tell Theo thank you for inviting me over. Goodbye, Potter.” Draco gets up and disaperates on the spot. Harry remains frozen.
“If I have a problem with him?!” Harry is standing now, hands in his hair, he reckons he looks a bit bonkers. “Why has the world turned upside down on me? Since when is Malfoy the one everyone wants to protect from me? Since when is Malfoy polite? Since when is Malfoy into muggle music? And since when does Malfoy wears bloody short-shorts?!”
Harry is about to defend himself when he stops and, as he rarely does, takes a moment to consider what Hannah said. Had he been leading Theo on? Harry thinks he had made it clear that he never wanted anything more than they had, but maybe he was not communicating that as well as he could have.
“Look, I’m sorry Ron, it’s just, I’ve been… busy, I guess I forgot to tell you.” It isn’t exactly a lie, Harry has been busy this week, but Harry isn’t being honest either. He had tried on multiple occasions during the week to tell Ron about Theo, but Harry was frankly nervous about how this would shift the dynamics of the friendship they all shared. Ron, Hermionie, Hannah, Harry, and Theo would go to pub nights every Friday together. Harry has no qualms about still being friends with Theo, and he’s sure that Theo is also mature enough to be friends. The few times that they have seen each other in passing in the past week have been comfortable and civil. It’s Ron that Harry is worried about, and rightfully so.
“Because he assumed you would have told me, which makes sense since I’m you’re best mate, or do we just not tell each other things anymore?” Ron shoots back with more venom than before. Harry feels the guilt build up in his gut.
Oh, Harry Thinks. This talk. He’s been dreading this talk even more than a potential breakup or whatever it would be called if they stopped whatever they were doing.
someone clearing their throat beside him. He looked over his cover, locking eyes with that someone. “Good morning, Mother.”
Draco always got a funny feeling after seeing Potter. He was mature enough to admit that Potter was attractive, always had been if his Hogwarts fantasies were anything to go by. But now, not only was Potter attractive, but he also seemed like a really good man. A good friend, if he listened to what Ron was talking about while he and his colleagues searched the store, a brilliant godfather according to Teddy, a man very good at his job as a healer a proud Andromeda told him again and again and even Scorpius sang his praises after spending time with him. Though Draco never got to experience any of this first hand, he had grown quite fond of Potter, but since he knew that Potter couldn’t stand him, he tried his very best to keep his distance. Maybe it was for the best that he quit his apprenticeship so that he didn’t run into Potter at St Mungo’s all the time. He could only stare so much before it became pathetic. So, any warm feelings towards him, he kept shoving down, hoping they wouldn’t explode in his face one day.
Andromeda was the one who answered instead. “I think we’ll need some time to decide if that’s alright, Harry?”
Draco covered his face with his hands. “I didn’t hear that part.” He groaned through his fingers. “Fuck, I’ve been such an arse to him.”
“You haven’t clung this much to me since eighth year, and that was only because you wanted my dick up your arse.” Blaise started to nibble on Draco’s ear.
“You know I never do.” Blaise winked at Draco and went to the bar, several heads turning as he went by. That man was too good looking for his own good.
Harry slumped in his chair and cradled his own cup of tea. "How could this help? If anything, it will only make matters worse."
“I mean it’s fucking Christmas,” he’s talking fast, which means he really should shut up. “And you just touched my lips and said I looked charming.”
Harry turns and Malfoy’s holding a stack of pictures in his hands. “Tiananmen Square. Only a few months ago.”
“Are you usually this insufferable?” Harry mutters, grabbing the box of chocolates from Draco and using a pair of scissors to curl the ends of the twine so they look less like a rat’s limp tail.
The crowd of muggles chatting loudly with the guards at the wall is only just beginning to thicken, and Harry doubts anyone’s got the energy to spare him a critique of his sense of style.
Malfoy smirked down at him, and took the opportunity to capture his lips again. Shirts went flying, and trousers followed. Malfoy’s grasped Harry’s hips tightly before he pressed both their hips together. Harry let loose a strangled noise, skin heating up as he felt Malfoy’s erection press against his through the thin material of his pants.
The only items personalized are Malfoy’s photos, and when they both cast Lumos, the images are the first thing Harry can see. Here, Malfoy hardly hides the magical photos. They hang from frames, and the films hang from clothing lines along his kitchen.
Malfoy smiles. “It was in the Prophet. Pansy’d told me all about it, though the papers often lie so I didn’t think it was true.”
“Yes. You saved us from grave evil, Potter. It’s the least I can do in behalf of the wizarding world. And the muggles, really.”
“Likewise,” Malfoy smiles, and then carries his steaming mug to the Christmas tree where he engages in conversation with who the fuck knows.
Pixies and pixy dust linger from the dinner they’d shared with their friends last night. Ginny had gone out the floo with all the other guests, and that had been a little strange for Harry. They’d decorated the Christmas tree together. Harry, Ginny, Hermione, Ron, Neville, and the list goes on. Harry is still chugging down his hangover potion, and he can’t quite remember who’d accompanied Neville.
“I see you’re in uniform,” and Malfoy’s eyes do more than just look. They skim over every detail of Harry’s uniform. “You still haven’t mastered an ironing charm, it seems.”
There’s one of Teddy’s drawings hung up on the refrigerator with a magnet keeping it in place, and Draco seems to be running his fingers over all the sweet tokens that Hermione’s been keeping magnetized onto her fridge.
“Paris,” Harry thinks of the Beauxbaton girls, charming their way through Hogwarts, and then remembers the present he’s got to wrap for Fleur.
Malfoy grabs a clear bottle and stands beside him so their arms brush, and Harry smells the opened bottle of Vodka, and the sharp cologne Malfoy has on. “Yeah. The place is borrowed, from a friend. I needed it if I wanted to keep my job and was lucky enough he was thick enough to escape west.”
Harry’s never seen anything like it. Not even in one of those magical magazines the boys used to keep under their beds at Hogwarts, charmed to replay images of men pounding into women.
Not from Malfoy’s lips against his inner thighs, or fingers running through his hair, or whispered promises of more kisses in bed.
They stand doing nothing for a few seconds before Harry shakes off his coat, and then his long auror robe so that he’s in slacks and a rumpled white shirt.
“Harry, thank Merlin you’re here. I can’t do this anymore. I’ve still got to wrap Dad’s odd muggle contraption that Hermione’d insisted I gift him and I just can’t be bothered any longer with this shite.”
He wakes from the sound of fluttering wings and a pecking beak. When he peels his eyes open, there, the ending to a possibly new beginning.
Harry can picture Malfoy standing behind a camera, capturing these photos as though it was no big deal. As though he wasn’t breaking the rules or leaving a mark. Harry thinks Malfoy’s leaving a mark. Harry thinks he’s losing his mind.
He wished he hadn't when he found Malfoy leaning comfortably against the balcony rail. The first button in his crisp shirt was loose, and one of hands cradled a half-empty glass of what looked like firewhisky.
Harry slumped onto his side as they both stared at the ceiling and struggled to catch their breaths.
Someone begins to sing a song, and then the whole crowds chants something that sounds German and old in a way so synchronized that even Harry takes a moment to let the foreign words ring in his head. He wonders what the words could possibly mean, what song would be chosen to be sung at a night that seems charged with the electric sensation of a change that is on the verge of dismantling decades of a strict regime.
Harry’s slightly confused as he holds the gift in his hands, watching Draco’s retreat as though he’s on the field.
Harry tries to manipulate the ball with a wand-less spell, and he manages to suspend it in the air. He deactivates the charm, so that it will only work when the next person touches the ball, and then begins to wrap the ball as he well as he can. “Where is she, anyway?”
So Harry was there. He dressed in his only expensive robes, didn't even bother with fixing his hair, and tucked his wand in his pocket before Apparating away.
They leave the red room behind to take the stairs up to an even darker room. It’s an office of sorts, Harry realizes, when Malfoy casts a Lumos.
“I have an idea or two,” Malfoy takes the last delicate bite from his toast, and then brushes the crumbs from his fingers as he stands. “Wait here.”
"I meant outside." Harry took a sip of the drink to appear more laid back, but he almost choked when it burned a path down his throat.
Malfoy has his head resting on Harry’s side, though he doesn’t stir when Harry slips out of his bed. He slides on his pants, and shirt, and opens the window.
Harry pushed himself to the end of the bed, and Malfoy followed him. Their mouths touched and what followed was a series of struggles on who could kiss harder, kiss better, kiss hotter. Tongues danced, and teeth grazed, and lips burned as Harry managed to finally run his fingers over Malfoy’s hair. He undid the braid and let the pale hair cascade over him. Their mouths pulled away, and Harry combed his fingers through what felt like silk. “Finally.”
Time ticked, and hour after hour, Harry tore through Malfoy's videos. His voice now echoed in Harry's head. Something needed to be done about it, but he just couldn't care. He needed to watch every video, until there weren't any left.
“I’m suggesting you kiss me. Or fuck me. I know you’ve been dying to since last night, and you haven’t been able to stop thinking about it since you saw those pictures.”
Harry leans in, and their lips meet half way. Malfoy’s lips are cold, but soft, like kissing rose petals just after it had rained. Harry’s hands are quick to find Malfoy’s hair, and their lips slide together easily, as though they’ve kissed a thousand times before.
The rush of the floo distracts Harry from climbing up the stairs to grab some presents and wrapping paper.
Malfoy glanced down at where Harry's fingers wrapped around his arm, and Harry let go as if Mafloy's robes were made out of fire, heart racing at the sudden feeling.
It had been a week since Ron had sent Harry the link, and so far, he'd been able to restrain from watching any more of Malfoy's video. Hermione had owled him that morning and asked if he would join her in one of their favorite muggle cafés.
Harry doesn’t know what to say so he nods, and then looks for Draco, but can’t seem to him in the slightly crowded living room.
“Yes.” But Malfoy doesn’t seem desperate to see anybody any time soon. “I suppose. Besides, I’ve built all of this myself.”
The ball room that held the gala was lit up in a thousand different floating candles. They bobbed in the air and cast a golden glow around the area. Harry was almost instantly surrounded by different people. The minister made a show of greeting him, and welcoming him to the event. He placed a firm hand on Harry's back and ushered him around the place. Harry was forced to shake hands with many people he would never remember, and every familiar face he spotted was too far away from him. He found Hermione while he was forced to embrace an elderly stout woman, but when he dislodged, she was no where to be seen. Ron was by the drinking fountain, but every time Harry made an excuse to leave, someone else would take a hold of him.
Harry stands up and moves towards the nearest window. Peering out, he realizes he sees nothing beyond the building right across from them. The bricked wall and the perfectly spaced out windows. It reminds him of something from a Hitchcock film.
“Oh,” Harry breathes, and his legs push him forward so that he finds himself examining rows of hung up film.
“No, I haven’t been seeing anyone since,” Harry eyes Draco in mock suspicion. “How much are you selling that for?”
“I should take more of these,” Malfoy says, peering into his camera. He’s facing Harry, yet he’s surprised when another flash goes off. He blinks.
Harry stands, and lights the cigarette for him. Malfoy’s breath comes out in a puff, but Harry doesn’t flinch away.
“Here?” Harry looks up, and it’s difficult not to notice the difference between this building and the manor.
He slowly regains his energy, and begins to clean after the mess they’d all left behind. He thinks he’s even spotted a set of Hermione’s golden earrings, but it’s just the glitter and shine from one of the strings that had popped from their crackers.
“No, no, no. I don’t want you to be wrapping paper, I need you to wrap yourself with wrapping paper.” The ball reverts to its original form, pops, and is transformed into a sheet of wrapping paper. “Fuck!”
Harry can tell now, after an hour of standing around, watching the people, never seeming to get bored of their muggle quirks, that the night is void of any real threat to any of the parties involved.
His hair was pulled back in a simple, single braid. Harry would have felt disappointed if the braid hadn't sat so casually over one of Malfoy's shoulder, loose strands escaping its hold and framing his sharp face.
His fingers continued running through Harry’s hair, and he slowly looked away. “We could try a potion.”
Harry thinks he could’ve done just fine without that last remark, but his feet don’t drag as he and Malfoy wind themselves between the people. Then it’s a simple climb up the wall. Harry watches as Malfoy takes a few shots from the top, watches him use his mouth to hold the old roll of film between his teeth as his nimble fingers work on inserting a new one.
“I can imagine,” Harry mumbles, still looking at the picture. He takes the bottle of vodka from Malfoy, taking a short swallow of the stuff and coughing just a little. ‘What else have you got?”
It is dark out, and bloody cold. A slight detail Harry hadn’t thought of thoroughly as he’d thrust on his simple coat over his auror robes.
“I don’t fucking know,” Harry whispers, and he’s looking at Malfoy’s lips, like one gazes at the sun when they know full well that they shouldn’t.
“Just the one,” Malfoy tucks his hands into his pockets. “Are you feeling cold? I could get the fire.”
His long finger touches the line of Harry’s cheekbone, traces it back and forth. “It’s a little faltering here. I think you should maybe touch it up a little.”
And when they’ve had enough of those, they stand almost awkwardly. Harry’s still clutching the bottle of vodka, he realizes, and he takes a sip as he thinks of what to say next.
The night is dark, and the shadow of excited people continue to crowd the wall. Harry moves closer to where the guards stand, before it’s too late and the only way to get across would either call for secretively hexing innocent muggles, or risking apparition.
Draco cleared his throat. ”I’m sorry about Blaise. He’s such a flirt, and boundaries aren't his strong suit. I apologize if he made you feel uncomfortable.
He slung an arm over Hermione’s shoulders when he reached the bar, and gave her a kiss on the cheek. He could see both Pansy and Malfoy looking at him funny, but he was too happy to care. He gave them a little wave instead.
”I’m not blind, Potter!” Draco dragged Harry along with him in search of their hotel. ”Close that mouth of yours. One would think you've never been out of Britain before.”
Now this was getting ridiculous. Harry felt the wind against his face when he fell backwards from the window onto the hard pavement of the astronomy tower. Somehow the fall didn’t hurt as much one would think falling from that distance, though it would probably leave bruises all over his arse. But it wasn’t like anyone would notice anyway he thought with a sigh, anyone meaning Malfoy.
“Turbulence? No! No!” Draco stood up, banged his head against the luggage compartment, swore and started to walk down the aisle.
“Of course she did,” Draco said under his breath and turned around so he didn’t have to look at Harry’s legs anymore. Or at his bulge anymore, because there was definitely a clear outline of Harry’s private parts through his trousers. This was going to be a hard couple of days for Draco if he was spending so much time in close proximity to Harry’s private parts. Or Harry in general.
Draco pulled out slowly, and dropped down on his chair behind him. “You’ll never have to prove yourself to me, Harry. You must know that.” He leaned forward and grabbed Harry’s arse cheeks, spread them apart, and watched his come slowly drip out of Harry’s hole. He traced the trickle of come with one finger and dragged it up to Harry’s hole again, smearing it around in slow circles. “But yes, you were fucking amazing.”
Harry didn’t know how long he’d been sitting at the table, staring into the distance, when Ron sat down beside him.
Harry cut him off. “I know you’re mad, but please hear me out. I didn’t mean to sleep in your bed, I was sleepwalking again.”
Narcissa looked at him for a second and then gave him a tiny smile. “Yes of course, I’m sorry darling. It’s a bit dark here,” she whispered back.
The Leaky was loud and obnoxious, if you asked Draco. Not that anyone did. It wasn’t that he cared. He was used to being left out of conversations that didn’t involve his job. He liked it that way, people were horrible anyway. He had worked as a financial adviser to Minister Shacklebolt for four years now, he was good at his job and everyone knew it. The Ministry's financial situation had never been better, thanks to him. So what if he didn’t have friends lining up to be with him? Not everyone could overlook what he’d done, and he had learned to accept that.
Draco didn’t have it in him to be mad, he was just sad that it had to come to this. He sat in silence while his mother kept on spitting out accusations towards Scorpius, calling him by one foul name after another. It was hard to see his mother like this. While she could be cunning, she had never been evil towards the ones she loved, and seeing her in front of him right now was like witnessing a completely different person. He left his mother on the sofa, asking one of the elves to try to get her something to eat instead.
Harry woke the next morning in his own bed, the rope gone, and the covers neatly tucked around him. As if he hadn’t left his bed the whole night. He felt lighter that day than he had felt for weeks. He managed having normal conversations with Hermione and Ron all through the day. He even smiled towards Malfoy when he caught him looking at Harry, but Malfoy looked so startled that Harry thought that maybe he was taking his good mood a bit too far. The same procedure went on for a couple of days, and by the fifth night he stopped tying himself up. Which he probably shouldn’t have done, he realized when he woke up in the darkness in a bed that wasn’t his. The first sign that something was off was the smell, Harry’s own bed didn’t smell like this. It was like a combination of Christmas and summer all at once. And if the smell didn’t give it away, the arm draped around his torso should do the trick. While trying not to panic, Harry eased his body away from the arm and carefully climbed of bed. Malfoy’s bed. Oh, holy crap he had sleepwalked into Malfoy’s bed. This was not good. This was so not good, and Malfoy would probably kill him if he found out that Harry had slept in his bed. He slowly walked backwards towards the door, when the unmistakable sound of an alarm went off at Malfoy’s bedside table. Malfoy started moving in the bed and Harry whispered the quickest silencing charm ever and dodged out of the door, hoping that Malfoy was too tired to notice. Safely locked inside his own room, Harry’s breathing finally slowed down, but he didn’t sleep more that night.
“Oh Merlin, it hasn't worn off yet has it?” He heard footsteps approaching the bed, then someone tapped his shoulder. “Here, drink this. And don’t you dare throw up at me. Again, I must add.”
The worst thing about it was that he knew Potter was right. His mother had been more and more agitated after every appointment, and she was more upset than helped by them, but Draco had hoped that they were doing something good for her and at least her appointments were an indication that it was something fixable, and he had wanted to live with that hope for a little bit longer.
They went out to explore Barcelona. Harry was like a little child and it wasn’t endearing at all. Only it was. Draco didn’t know how to handle Harry begging him to tell him about every building they passed. About the museums, the history about Sagrada Família, Casa Battló and Casa Milà. Draco wanted to roll his eyes and complain about how little knowledge Harry had, but he couldn’t help but love that he was the one who could teach Harry all he knew about Gaudí. He did roll his eyes, though, and tried to get in a few insults. But it was almost like Harry knew as well they were just for show.
Potter laughed, out loud. Draco couldn’t remember if he ever heard Potter laugh so uninhibited around him before. “I’m so not here for Dora.”
She kept on muttering the whole way back to the Manor, and Draco took her to her room. He quietly called for Nimly and asked her in a low voice to stir a sleeping potion in his mother’s tea. His mother was cold and shaking, but Nimly was able to get her to swallow a couple of sips before she pushed the cup away, spilling tea over the carpet.
Draco winced. “Yes, about that. I misheard you at Hermione’s birthday party. I was so sure you said you didn’t want me there.”
“I’ll try.” Draco knew his father would tell him sooner or later. If it was something bad he probably had a hand in it somewhere.
Harry clasped Draco’s hands with his own, tugging them away from his robe. He gently took a grip of Draco’s chin and raised his head. “Look at me.” They were standing pressed up against each other, and when Draco took one look at Harry he could feel his anger draining away. He let his head fall down onto Harry’s collarbone and Harry put his arms around him, hugging him tightly. They stood there for a minute, Harry stroking his back while Draco got his breathing in order. “Come, we’ll go someplace where we can talk.”
“Salazar Harry, I know! Why are you apologizing you idiot, why aren’t you mad?” Malfoy asked Harry in a frantic voice.
Draco couldn’t remember anyone calling him beautiful before, he had to close his eyes to hide away the onslaught of emotions that were probably showing in his eyes. He took a deep breath and when he opened his eyes again, he put one hand in Potter’s hair and carefully pulled his head up so he could kiss him again. Somewhere in between kisses he breathed out Harry’s name. Harry broke the kiss and looked into Draco’s eyes, he gave him a tiny smile and then he kissed him again. There was more heat to the kiss this time, and he could feel Harry’s erection pushing against his own.
Harry laughed as Draco pushed him into the elevator and started to unbutton his trousers, and slowly sank down on his knees with the doors closing behind them.
Harry glared at him through his fingers. He took them away and dragged them through his hair, before putting it up in a messy bun. “We could visit Charlie in Romania?”
“Well I was sleeping, which one should do in the middle of the night, and as I said, I heard a noise,” Harry grumbled.
Draco put everything on his desk back to its rightful place, and stood up. He had never before given in to shame, and he wasn’t going to do so today either. Maybe Potter hadn’t heard it all, maybe he was just flustered because of their raised voices. Yes, that was probably it. But, if Draco was going to that damn ball, he was going to look impeccable. He had some shopping to do.
He was deep in numbers when he heard the elevator ping. Without looking up, he called out, “Mr Shacklebolt isn’t here. You’ll have to wait until tomorrow.”
changed, he couldn’t help to feel that he really wanted Potter to acknowledge that. It was silly, really, that he still wanted Potter’s friendship even twenty years down the line.
”You’re a wizard, you git. You can use a sun shield spell! And no, I don’t want to spend my whole holiday looking at boring buildings.”
Harry could feel his whole face turning hot from the images he got from Malfoy’s last sentence. He was right. Someone should tie him up, preferably Malfoy. Preferably a naked Malfoy. Preferably a naked Malfoy keeping him down with his own body and…
It was with a heavy feeling Draco entered his flat. The knowledge that he probably had ruined everything good he had going with Harry was eating at him. He felt like a coward, but most of all he felt lonely. The flat was dark and empty. He was used to having Harry here, occupying his space with his whole presence, and he missed him. He sat on his sofa, where Harry used to sleep, and stroked his hand over one of the cushions. Harry belonged here. There must be something he could do to save this. If he could just gather the courage to tell Harry how he felt, they could take it from there.
He tried to give her sleeping potions to help her sleep at night, but Narcissa had become more suspicious, not wanting to eat or drink anything that he or Scorpius offered, claiming that they tried to poison her. One time when she refused to have tea with Scorpius, Draco asked him to go to his room when he saw how sad he became over the refusal, and tried to sit his mother down to explain that all they wanted was to spend time with her.
“I sent her away. Don’t act so upset,” Lucius snorted. “You didn’t even notice she was gone. It’s better this way.”
“It was, but still, you’re out of a job and I was there being all happy that we finally got something on that bastard.”
”I promise, I will burn those pictures the minute I come home, and I won’t utter a word about the striptease — ”
Harry startled awake, yet again, almost falling down the stairs. This sleepwalking thing was getting tiresome, he thought, while dragging his tired body back to the dorms.
“Brag much, do you Potter?” Malfoy said, raising his eyebrows with that haughty look on his face that somehow Harry found rather hot than infuriating like he did before.
Scorpius smiled with his whole face as he nodded his head. “Yes!” He hurried out of bed and was gone before Draco could ask him not to use too much Floo powder. He pulled the covers over his head and gave himself a minute before leaving his warm bed to get on with their day.
He hadn’t been standing in the kitchen for too long when Harry came in. He opened his mouth to start his apology when Harry beat him to it.
He had tried everything to keep himself from leaving his bed unintended at night. But he’d somehow managed to remove all kinds of barriers while asleep, and he was running out of ideas of what to do. The other day he was on the verge to ask Hermione for help, but when she looked at him with those worried eyes, he asked her about his homework instead. She hadn’t bought it, but she didn’t pry either, so he counted that as a win.
Malfoy almost looked surprised for a second, before his features went back to the same neutral look he always wore around Harry.
“Of course it’s enough.” Harry tried to put a hand over Draco’s on the table but Draco wouldn’t let him. “I was only thinking that Scorpius is going to little wizard school in the fall, right? And––” Harry stopped himself.
“Hm, I’m not sure. Perhaps the blow to his head caused some sort of memory loss. We will run some additional tests, I’ll be back.” He nodded at Draco and left the room.
“Why would you do such a thing? Now everyone will think I’m a poor lonely sod, wallowing in my own misery.” Draco dragged his hand over his face.
Harry looked embarrassed. “No, I was meeting Seamus actually but when I saw you I–– I couldn’t leave you alone like that.” He cleared his throat. “So you and Ron, being mates, I didn’t think that would happen.”
Draco coughed a little, a light flush spread on his face. “I’m pretty sure Bert and Ernie don’t usually hold hands.”
He went and gave Pansy a kiss on the cheek. She didn’t fuss over his departure, he’d only promised her an hour, after all.
He left Draco alone, panting in the room. It was becoming harder and harder to breathe, and he put his head down between his arms to ease the way. He startled when he felt a tiny hand stroking his back.
“I don’t know really. I remember being me, where I live and work. But all the details are a little bit fussy.”
It took a while before Harry answered the door, and Draco was pacing back and forth, nervous but not knowing where else to go. When the door finally opened, Harry didn’t appear angry as Draco had thought he would. Instead, he looked at Draco with worry in his eyes.
The rest of the day, Draco buried himself in work, ignoring Dora’s attempts to talk to him. It’d been a long time since Draco had felt this humiliated. He skipped lunch and was desperately trying to come up with a believable excuse to miss out on the ball that evening.
With Christmas around the corner, he knew he had to apologise to Potter so as not to make it awkward when they crossed paths at Andromeda’s, he just didn’t know how, and after several attempts at writing a letter, he just let it go, dreading boxing day with each passing hour.
Ron looked at him funny. “Did we listen to the same conversation? He just wanted a heads up so he could prepare to–” Ron waved his hands around, “you know.”
Harry opened Draco’s trousers and helped him get them and his pants down enough to make his cock stand up over the waistband. Harry looked at him with his pupils dilated, only leaving a sliver of green around them. He lowered his head and licked Draco from base to tip, while he closed his hand around him. Draco let out a groan and fell back on the sofa, staring up at the ceiling, his hands in his own hair to stop him from reaching out to Harry.
Draco scooped Scorpius up from behind, making him giggle. “You, young man, should be in bed. It’s almost midnight,” he said sternly, directing the words to his mother rather than Scorpius.
“Good morning, Father,” Scorpius said politely, before slipping under the covers, and then he kneed Draco right between his legs.
“Malfoy, hi.” He gave a nod back. “I didn’t know you would be visiting today. Andromeda asked me to swing by.” Potter looked around the garden and didn’t meet Draco’s eyes. Sometimes trying to get Potter to look at him was harder than beating him in a game of quidditch.
Blaise snorted out a laugh. “Ah, Potter. I should’ve known.” He gave Draco a patronizing smile, kissed him on the cheek and left.
“Sorry, there’s nothing we can do,” she said, trying to hide a smile while looking down at her paperwork.
“This is really nice, isn't it?” Harry said, slamming his forth beer down on the table. He could feel how all the stress was leaving his body, he hadn’t felt this relaxed in a long time. “I really needed that one,” he continued, to no one in particular.
Still panting, Draco watched Harry gingerly raise himself up to standing, turning around and then pulling Draco close against him, kissing him like his life depended on it. Draco gave back as good as he got, but it was hard because he was still out of breath. He gently pushed Harry away, and put their foreheads together instead. He ran his hands over Harry’s back, which was sticky with sweat and Draco’s come. “We really should clean up,” Draco said, though not making an effort to do it.
“I heard someone’s alarm go off a while ago and couldn’t go back to sleep, then I heard footsteps and wanted to see if something was up.”
She stroked Draco’s cheek when they walked by him to the door. “We’ll wait for you in the cafeteria, dear.”
Ignoring the fluttering feeling in his stomach, it was probably because due to lack of food anyway, he tried to get Malfoy’s attention again.
Harry kept a firm grip on his hand, and when he pulled Draco towards him, Draco came willingly. He climbed onto Harry’s lap and kissed him, trying to pour every longing and need that he had for Harry into one kiss. When he felt he couldn’t breathe anymore from the intensity of it he pulled back. “I want to.” He traced the laugh lines around Harry’s eyes. “I really, really want to.”
“Oh!” Draco couldn’t hide his blush, so he looked at Scorpius to shy away from Potter’s gaze. “Well then, I don’t know the voices so perhaps Harry can continue reading? If you ask politely.”
“We all think that.” Harry kissed his forehead before he continued. “And I want to comfort you by telling you it will be better, and that her happy memories will last forever, or whatever crap that Muggle book tells you, but it won’t. It only gets worse from here on forward, and that’s a shitty thing to tell a grieving person, but it's the truth, and at least you deserve the truth. And I can’t help it or stop it, but I can be by your side while it's happening, if you want me to. I want to,” he said with such an honest expression that Draco had to look away.
“I understand that it’s a lot to take in for all of you. There’s no need to apologize,” Potter smiled kindly. “Our diagnosis shows that Narcissa is suffering from spell damage, probably inflicted during the war. The damage has inflicted the part of the brain that’s responsible for language, reasoning, and social behavior. It’s also destroying neurons and their connections in the part of the brain that involves the memory, making your mother forget things and alternate things she sees around her. It’s very much like a muggle disease, and that disease hasn't got a cure either, and I’m afraid us wizards haven’t caught up and solved it yet.”
They took their breakfast in silence. Draco kept watching Harry out of the corner of his eye, not quite grasping that this was real. After a little while he could see Harry starting to fidget, he opened and closed his mouth a couple of times, clearly wanting to say something. Draco wondered if he perhaps had overstayed his welcome so he nudged Harry with his foot. “What?” He smiled, but his nerves made his lips twitch in the corners.
Draco was relieved to see that Ron didn’t smile, instead, he looked apologetically at him while he strode towards him and grasped his shoulder. “Thank you,” he said, taking a step back. “This is just what we needed to shut this place down.”
“No, I get that. Ron squeezed his shoulder. “Okay, let’s grab a pint and talk about our children then. Rose has been super curious about Scorpius, Harry talks about him a lot.” At Draco’s surprised expression he added, “Only good things, promise.”
“And you have?” Lucius asked. “You’ve spent less and less time at home, leaving your son for the elves to take care of. The only reason you’re home now is because your boss couldn’t keep his business in order. To think Mr Finley was an honest and good pureblood only to find out he’s been dealing with Muggle drugs like a miscreant. Pathetic!”
“Yes!” Draco gasped out. “I mean yes, thank you, Potter.” He didn’t care that he already dismissed the idea of asking Potter when Andromeda had hinted at it, he couldn’t say no knowing that no other healer would make an appointment with them.
“Because your parents thought it was a good name,” Harry said through gritted teeth. He took a breath and then mumbled a very quiet
And that was that. No hexes, no screaming or accusation of Harry being a creep sneaking into other people’s beds. Just their regular greeting, like any other day. Harry couldn’t decide if he was relieved that Malfoy probably hadn’t notice anything, or disappointed if he had and that was the reaction to it. That night he tied both his arms and legs to his bed and whispered a silent prayer that he would wake in the same position the next morning.
“Nonsense, you’ll stay.” Andromeda gestured towards the table filled with tea cups and a large lemon and lavender cake, Draco’s favourite.
“What’s your deal with Harry anyway?” Ron asked, only slightly raising his eyebrows at Draco’s empty drink. He sipped on his pint carefully, his second glass only half empty. “I thought you would have left all those bad feelings behind you by now.”
Draco snorted. “Don’t overdo it, Potter.” He shook his head. “Come on now Scorpius, let’s get going.
“That’s perfectly fine. Sometimes it’s good to have a relative's point of view,” Potter smiled. “Um, will your father…?
Draco batted his hand away. “I don’t want to come like this.” He dragged Harry towards him for a kiss. “I want you in me.”
After a couple of months, the mind healer cancelled the rest of his mother’s appointments, claiming there were no improvements to be made, just to let nature take its course. Draco had stormed off to St Mungo’s, yelled at the poor healer until Potter came and dragged him away to his office, slowly trying to explain what she meant by that.
He woke up on his side facing a mop of black hair as Harry was pressing soft kisses against his shoulder, his hair tickling Draco’s cheek. He huffed out a little laugh and Harry looked up at him with his bright green eyes. He smiled at him before he dove down again, continuing to place kisses against Draco’s shoulder and neck. Draco slowly traced his fingers over Harry’s back, leaving a trail of goosebumps as he did so. He let his fingers brush against Harry’s thigh before reaching his hard cock, giving it a firm stroke as Harry started to work on what would be an impressive hickey on his neck. He continued to lazily stroke him as Harry panted harder and harder, making sounds that had Draco squirming in response.
“It’ll only be for a while anyway until she’s better.” Draco ignored Andromeda’s expression of disbelief. Of course, this was fixable, if she only could meet with a healer then it would be solved. “I’ll go and get Scorpius.” He hugged Andromeda and lingered in her embrace for a couple of seconds longer than necessary.
It wasn’t the first time strange things happened in this castle though. While going back through the corridors the realness of it all caught up with him: he had almost fallen out of the tower. This time before he fell asleep, he’d cast a strong locking spell on his door and set an alarm that would go off if he left his bed. But he’d managed to walk out of his room, without his wand and only in his pants, and from what he could hear, there was no alarm sounding.
“It’s just a bit of turbulence, nothing dangerous. Put your seatbelt on,” Harry said, in what he thought was a soothing voice. Apparently not soothing enough.
Draco actually had a good time at first. He gave his present to Granger, who gave him a genuine smile and a firm handshake as a thank you. Ron introduced him to some of his colleagues, although he had already met them once or twice in the store, they nodded politely in greeting. He couldn’t see Kristoff anywhere, but from Ron and his interactions at work Draco hadn’t thought they were friends, but it was a relief anyway. All through the evening, Potter was hovering around nearby, casting suspicious glances at Draco. Sometimes Draco thought Potter was heading in his direction, only for him to stop midways and grab a hold of someone else to talk to. Draco could feel a sting of disappointment every time Potter broke eye contact with him, not realising that he had wanted to talk to Potter in the first place. Maybe he just had a hope to have a normal conversation with him without Teddy and Scorpius around as a buffer.
Draco was a bit overwhelmed at Ron’s sudden urge to spend time together, but perhaps a drink would be nice to clear his head and forget everything that was happening around him. He agreed to talk to his aunt and then went outside and waited to be taken away to the Ministry.
Draco slumped down in his chair with a frown. He sipped from his empty glass, trying to get the few lingering drops of alcohol.
Draco would’ve liked to say that everything changed for the better after that, but sadly nothing major improved. His mother could keep up with conversations better, but she still got lost in her head sometimes and saw things that weren’t there, and while Draco did what Potter had said and didn’t correct her visions, his father was no help at all. He snapped at her while she had a hard time keeping up with conversations, he yelled at her when she talked about the fairies in the garden, and if she took too long to answer he simply left. Draco had tried talking to him several times, but it always ended with both of them screaming at each other and Draco storming off, leaving his father fuming in his study. His hopes about his mother being able to live at home for a long time seemed further and further away.
back,” he winked at Draco. The nickname felt more teasing now, and even more familiar than mate did. “Come in, I'll buy you a pint.”
Potter didn’t answer. He gave Draco a look that was hard to describe as anything other than heated. He put his drink down and patted Shacklebolt on the back before he walked away. Everything in Draco screamed at him to follow Potter, but Shacklebolt stopped him, wanting to hear everything he and Mr Rebane had discussed.
“Why would I be mad?” Harry didn’t understand. “I slept in your bed, without your consent. Why are you looking at me like that?”
The flight attendant nodded and let Draco go. Draco stood and panted hard with a scared look on his face. To hell with polite work relations, Harry thought. He reached out his hand to Draco. “Come on love, sit down!”
Draco turned and took a grip at Harry’s collar of his healer robe, pushing him up against the other side of the corridor. “Where is she? Harry, he sent her away, I didn’t know!” Draco said desperately, gently shaking Harry as to not hurt him.
Potter nodded, squeezing Draco’s hips. Draco kissed him again, once, then he took a step back and grabbed the hem of Potter’s T-shirt and pulled it off. He traced his hands over his chest and let one of his fingers sweep over a nipple. Potter gasped and started to work on opening Draco’s buttons on his shirt. He was fumbling, so Draco took pity on him and spelled the shirt open.
“What? Really?” Harry straightens from his lounging position, intrigued. Malfoy? Teaching? Is he any good as a teacher? What will he be teaching? What position is open? Is he any good with kids? He's barely an adult himself. Oh god, is he going to be the next Snape? The last thought sends a shiver running down Harry’s spine.
“Sounds fun! Look I’ve been thinking we should talk about us,” Theo starts, looking less comfortable than he was a minute ago and Harry's head starts to turn. Is this a breakup? Harry thinks. It can’t be if we were never dating.
He sees Lupin and his warm eyes and offers of chocolate. He sees Sirius and his tight hugs and barking laugh. He sees Tonks and her silly antics and her bond with Ginny. He sees Fred and his brotherly protection on the quidditch field.
“Er, what the fuck?” Harry says. Malfoy does not seem startled by Harry’s presence, he simply looks up and smiles politely.
The next five minutes pass in a blur, Harry recognizes that they have managed to take out about seven dealers, Harry is responsible for two. Harry hates the chaos of it all. There is yelling coming from all sides, incantations, and screams of pain. Harry does as he was trained to do and blocks them out and focuses on his own duel. Harry hits his current opponent with a nasty hex and they go down, looking dazed, once he is sure that they aren’t getting up anytime soon, Harry looks around. The Aurors have taken the upper hand and everyone is rounding up the last of the criminals. He turns behind himself to see Hannah struggling in a duel with a wizard who looks much more determined than the others. He’s large, pale, and looks rather ghostly. Harry rushes over to give her a hand.
Harry lets his subconscious take over, his mussels know the right way to dodge a hit, and how to disarm a target as it flies towards him. He ducks, doges, hits and casts until his lungs burn with the exertion.
Malfoy is leaning his hands on the counter, back towards Harry, head bowed. “Hermione if you’ve come to comfort me I’m afraid-“
“The wand chooses the wizard.” Ollivander had said. So then why did Harry’s feel so foreign in his hands now? He holds the 11” in his hands as he sits on his made-up king bed in a large plain room. The weight of the wand in his hand feels wrong like it had been made for his teenage hands and not his adult hands.
It’s not unusual for Theo to let himself in and wait for Harry to get home if he gets back from work first, it happens quite frequently actually. What is unusual is the music. Harry had gotten into music after the war. After a particularly hard day, he pulled himself out of bed and went to the muggle record store directly under the flat, and bought about 12 random rock albums. He spent the next week listening to the records over and over, letting the music drown out the clouds in his head.
“Hannah?” Harry says, suddenly remembering the hex that got him, scared that it had hit her as well.
He wakes up to a tap on his shoulder. Harry looks up, disoriented and sore from the harsh floor he spent half the night on. Theo’s concerned face smiles down at him.
As he gets closer he can distinctly make out the song “Sex on Fire” by Kings of Leon. Well, whoever has broken into my house to listen to music has good taste, Harry thinks. Nothing could prepare Harry for the scene laid out in front of him as the sitting room came into view.
“Harry!” Molly’s voice is loud in his ear and he’s enveloped in a bone-crushing hug, barely after he’s stumbled out of the floo. “Oh, it’s been too long dear! You must come over more often, we don’t see any of you as much as we used to!” Molly lets him go and is now scolding him. “And it’s only so long before me and Arthur will both be dead and gone and then you’ll be sorry you didn’t come over for lunch more often!” Molly often uses her impending death as a bargaining chip for her children, Harry and Hermione, to come to see her more often, even though she and her husband were barely past middle age and quite healthy.
”Wait!” shouted Draco, only seconds away from the Portkey activating. ”Where are we going to sleep?”
“You don’t think I can take care of my mother? Is that what this is? I made a mistake and now you think I’m incapable of taking care of her?” Draco stood, trying to keep his temper in order.
Harry slowly eased his way into the common space, heading for his own room down the hall, when Malfoy stirred on the sofa. He stopped and looked over, only to find a pair of grey eyes looking at him.
“You can’t swim?” Malfoy said raising his voice to the point Harry was afraid they would wake up Hermione again.
“Screw your grandfather. Don’t listen to him,” Draco said, and then a chill ran down his spine when he heard
Ron boxed him lightly on the arm. “I just thought that you could be friends, you know? You’re not that different from each other, I think you could get along”. He drank the remains of his beer and put down the glass on the counter while he stood up. “I need to get back home. It’s not every night you have a child free night with the missus, you know.” He wiggled his eyebrows and punched Draco playfully on his chest. “But seriously, give Harry a chance. He likes you.”
Draco went to the couch and sat down again. “I made an utter fool of myself yesterday. It’s not a position I’m comfortable with. It was easier to leave without acknowledging that.” He took a sip from the other cup. The coffee was rich and strong, and he closed his eyes to savour the taste.
“Happy birthday, dear,” she said softly and pulled back from the hug. She turned to Potter, who had followed Draco into the garden, still looking sheepishly down on his shoes. “Harry, darling. Come and join us for tea.”
“Did she now?” Draco shook his head at Andromeda’s meddling, “Well that's quite alright Potter since she’s your family too, and all that.” Draco removed invisible lint from his shoulder just to occupy his hands.
Draco woke up to the familiar smell of hospital. He felt nauseous, and the urge to be sick was so strong, he had to put his hands up to cover his mouth. But something was attached to one of them. Another hand. The nausea subdued a bit from the chock and he blinked his eye’s open. This was strange. Either he was still dreaming, or he’d hit his head extremely hard and started imagining things. There could be no other explanation to the fact that Harry Potter was sleeping in a chair beside his bed, holding Draco’s hand in a tight grip. A knock on the door made Potter stir, but he slept on.
“But–” Draco began, nothing Ron said made any sense. “Rejected him? He said he didn’t want me there.” Wasn’t that what Harry had said before the water was turned on? Draco tried to recall what he heard that evening but since everything around him was a bit fuzzy at the edges it did nothing to improve his memory.
Draco could feel that uneasy feeling again, the same one he got when his mother had mistaken him for Lucius about a week ago. He cleared his throat before he spoke, “Everything is perfectly fine with mother. No need to worry.” He turned to Scorpius. “Finish your cake darling, we need to get going.”
“Malfoy! I’m sorry, I’m so, so sorry! I can explain,” Harry all but screamed while jumping out of bed
Harry didn’t say anything, just continued looking at Draco like he was trying to figure something out. Draco didn’t offer any more explanation and they drank their coffee in silence. When Draco finished he put the cup down again, offering Harry a smile.
“Malfoy, wait!” Potter dropped his arm as fast as he had grabbed it. “You could join us? At our table, I mean.”
Draco burned the note with a flick of his fingers before Harry could read it. “Fine, thank you then! If you could show us to our room?”
As he lay in bed that night, he was too exhausted to keep his feelings shoved down, and his treacherous mind was no help when it conjured image after image of Harry in that soft sweater, and the heat from his thigh pressed up against Draco’s own, and that brief touch of Harry’s broad fingers on his knee. He couldn’t help to imagine what they would feel like trailing up towards his crotch, maybe tracing the inseam of his trousers as he did so. How would Harry look if they were alone, and he had glided off the sofa and placed himself between Draco’s parted legs? Would he have spread them more? Letting his large hands sweep up over his thighs and place one of them on Draco’s growing erection, massaging the bulge as he slowly opened his zipper. Draco let his own hand dip below the waistband of his pyjama bottoms, grabbing his cock with a firm grip and wishing for a larger, broader hand instead of his own. How would Harry’s fingers feel around his cock? Would he be gentle, stroking Draco slowly up and down, or would he be rough, pinning Draco against the sofa, maybe holding him down as he placed a warm mouth around Draco’s cock, keeping a firm grip as he took Draco further and further in.
“Or you could simply leave,” was Malfoy’s response. He took a peek into the ball room, and said, “They all appear severely intoxicated.”
It was just as good as the other ones. If anything, Malfoy seemed even more talkative in this one, something Harry thought he would never use to describe Malfoy. Malfoy's pale hair seemed luminous as he brushed it through with an expensive looking comb. Harry wondered how he kept all his videos muggle-proof, knowing that the slimy git used an infinite amount of hair potions to keep his hair in its pristine state.
But someone has grown rose bushes by picket fence, and when Malfoy unlocks, and they climb up the short steps to the door, he can see many pots of flowers and other plants.
“I’ll show you around,” Malfoy says, tucking away his camera. “But I assume we’re both overdue a drink.”
The scents rush to his head, and he feels almost dizzy with the reminders of the holiday season so blatantly displayed before him.
“You weren’t called back,” Mafloy’s lips hug a cigarette as he walks across the living room to prop open a window, then fishes for a matchstick.
"Malfoy, sorry, I was just," Harry stumbled over his words as he waved his hands around and avoided eye contact.
Harry Potter apparates by the side of The Wall with a subtle crack. Subtle enough that it seemingly does nothing to alert the muggle guards who stand with guns clutched in their hands, and serious, sour expressions on their faces.
“Nope,” Malfoy says, twisting some twine over a box of chocolates. “Still the same muggle hating, Voldemort loving fool I’ve always been.”
Malfoy’s fingers run over the side of the wall, but Harry only sees this because the door is still open a crack, and the lights from outside allow him a glimpse of the room just before the door shuts and the room is filled with dim, red lights.
The screen eventually turned black, and Harry was forced to take his eyes off. He needed more. Initially, he thought he could use this against the pretentious git the next time they had to come face to face, but his feelings rapidly changed from frustration to utter fixation. He needed more.
It’s a collection of skin tones and warm shades, and of rippling abs and muscles, of soft curves and pubic hair.
Outdated, but it works just as fine as Malfoy jumps from channels before finding what seems to be the right one.
“Of course it fucking scares me, Potter,” and Malfoy’s scoffing as though Harry’s entire existence is a joke. Which, frankly, it is. “That was very Gryffindor of you to ask.”
“Oh,” Harry says, and Malfoy slides his mug towards him, and Harry’s just grateful he’s got something to hold onto. “That’s good.”
Harry rolls his shirt and clutches it in his hand as he walks over by the window. The white panes are in need of some dusting, and the windows are stained, but Malfoy lets him lean against the cold glass and takes a few photos before Harry can ask if he looks ridiculous or not.
Hermione gives him one of her looks. One of which suggest that he’s clearly underestimating her interpreting abilities.
Harry holds his breath. He’s not quite sure if he’s more upset over Malfoy’s appalling wrapping techniques that Hermione had so eagerly praised, or over his sarcastic comment that surprises Harry in a way he hadn’t expected to be surprised by Malfoy’s character.
“Of course, who do you take me for?” Malfoy frowns, all serious until he cracks a smile. “Come on, then. I’ll found you a place to stay.”
"Ever the civilized wizard," Malfoy commented, whirling the drink in his hand so the ice cubes clinked together.
The man beams, and the shuffles through the crowd, stopping some people and asking them questions in broken German that only intensifies the air of childish excitement that grips everyone in the near vicinity.
They linger by the west side for hours, it seems. Malfoy can’t seem to run out of film, and Harry can’t seem to get sick of the view of Malfoy shooting photos of Muggles. The crowd thins by the end of the night, and by the time they climb over the wall back east, Harry’s half drunk on fatigue.
“It’s very good,” Malfoy says, and he sits across from him. And they sit there, Malfoy listening to the radio, and Harry half-waiting for Malfoy to say something to him. Anything, it wouldn’t matter what it was.
“Yes,” Draco snorts, looking up from the kitchen tiles to look at him properly. “And I’ve no idea why I just told you any of that.”
“You still talk better than you walk,” Harry says. There’s a loud bang, people cheer, and someone’s blown off a great chunk of the Berlin wall.
Harry sighed. “No, you made that perfectly clear. I’m fine Draco. Go to bed.” He put the lights out with a
“Of course, she knows, she’s smarter than I am. How could she not know?” Malfoy said, much to Harry’s surprise.
They took their time removing each other's clothes before Draco started to complain that they were too slow, but he was rewarded when he was pressed down against the mattress with a warm body over his. They laid in bed letting both of them explore the curves of their bodies, breathing in each other's air. When Draco’s lips were swollen from Harry’s bruising kisses and their moans filled up the room Harry lifted his head and looked down on Draco. “Turn around?” he whispered.
Potter went behind the reception and scrolled through Moira’s appointment book, ignoring her protests. He scribbled something down on the paper. “There, on the twenty fifth of September, 9 am, Narcissa will see me. Does that work for you?” He looked up at Draco.
A ghost of a sad smile graced Potter's face and he opened his mouth to say something, but he closed it again and looked down.
“That’s so hot!” Potter breathed out. “You, doing wandless magic. I almost came in my pants when you cast that cooling charm over me on Pansy’s birthday.” He pushed the shirt off Draco’s shoulders and started to place soft kisses on his collarbones. “You’re so fucking beautiful,” Potter murmured between kisses.
“Been there, done that. And do you really want to be in the same country as my parents?” Draco raised his eyebrows at Harry.
He tuned in again as she kept on going. “And that pretty girl of his, that beautiful Ginny girl, no wonder he couldn't keep her if he’s that ungrateful. Maybe he’s a terrible lover. I’ve heard he’s a terrible lover. Haven’t you heard that he is a terrible lover?”
“You didn’t think I tried that? I tried everything. I tried to wake you, I tried dragging you away from doing stupid things. I told Hermione to try to wake you but even that didn’t work."
“Draco, stop it. It’s alright. We’ve all been shitfaced sometimes. Don’t worry about it.” Harry shoved him lightly in the side.
Auror Kristoff took a threatening step towards Draco. “That is not how you address an Auror, Mr Malfoy,” he said, close to Draco’s face.
Harry was left speechless, staring at Malfoy who was breathing hard and probably waiting for Harry to speak. “So, you, you don’t want me dead?”
“We have our presentation tomorrow, there’ll be no time for paperwork,” Malfoy said in a slow voice, like he was talking to a child.
“I’m fast Potter. And what kind of a wizard would I be if I couldn’t cast a decent silencing charm?”
“Why’s that?” Harry asked, his voice a little closer than it was before. Draco could feel the back of the couch shift as Harry moved.
