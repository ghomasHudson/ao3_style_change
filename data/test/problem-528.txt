“I’m in charge here,” Bellatrix said, and there was a sharp edge in her tone now. “You just need to make sure you stay alert and not allow something like last time to happen. It was only because you were lucky that you didn’t lose the Shield that our master spared you. If anything like that happens this time, I don’t think he would be so sanguine.”
That was informative and only whetted my hunger for more. “Adulthood is like that,” I pointed out. “Disillusionment and compromises are what awaits us.”
“Do you really think you’ll be able to hold me?” she asked, her voice silky. Draco recognized this – she was playing for time, the same tactic he had used earlier. No doubt she was trying to distract Harry too, so that in the off-chance he fell for it, she could escape.
“I wasn’t sure what I was thinking. I was so confused: angry and hurt that you didn’t tell me anything and scared that if you didn’t know, that I would somehow – endanger you.”
“Ah.” That made more sense. I was surprised it didn’t make front page news, though likely both sides wanted to avoid a scandal. “I’m sorry you had to experience that. It couldn’t have been easy. That’s why you chose to strike out on your own, isn’t it?”
“So was last night according to some, darling.” I winked at him. It was the oddest thing … I had a strangely fitful sleep last night … there was an uneasy bubble in my chest, and I could have sworn there was a shadow watching me.
The Decoder, too, had stopped ticking. It was light in Draco’s hands compared with the Shield. The energy that had kept the gears moving had ceased, and it was back to being a complicated piece of machinery.
“Be nice,” Harry chided. “You’re both important to me, you and the Weasleys. I want you both to get along.”
“I didn’t know you knew about that,” Shacklebolt said. “It’s not a secret, but time passes, and most people forget about their history. And we did try not to broadcast the finer details of that coup all those years ago.”
Motes of dust danced in the sunlight while Draco ruminated. Last night … it had been by turns passionate and gentle, their bodies joining together in sensual pleasure that still made Draco’s toes curl. It was clear that they both still remembered each other’s particular quirks, like how Harry preferred Draco’s mouth hot over his cock or how Draco enjoyed being pinned to the bed…. Draco blushed. He was getting aroused again. It wouldn’t do for Draco to be so distracted in the day.
Bellatrix sneered. “You have got to be joking, boy.” Her mocking tone was gone, replaced by anger that Draco would dare lecture her on anything. “You really think you can do anything? You?” She raised, ready to fire –
“I’m not with you,” Harry said, picking up his glass. He eyed it. “Err … is this safe to drink or will it be spiked?”
“It’s not that. It’s just –” Harry struggled to put his thoughts into words. “I’m surprised that the Ministry allowed someone to take the schematics of this home,” he said finally.
“Well, I’m certainly not going to bleed over the entire damn place.” I thought hard. I had never once thought of the practical matters of discovering lost artifacts – they had always seemed to theoretical in my mind.
“Then they should have sent their own team to investigate,” Harry said. “Come on, let’s go back to the office.”
This man … Harry repressed his irritation as he took out his wand. “Naturally, all of what we talk about is covered under the Official Secrets Act.”
“It would be nice to confirm my suspicions,” Draco said. He gestured at Harry. “I’m not rash like my friend here.”
My father still labored under the illusion that I could be ‘fixed’ if I returned to the Manor and lived under his watchful eye. And a properly dull girl from a proper family that he would select for me.
Potter looked at me with a glimmer of amusement. “When I go out, hit him from my left.” He spoke in quick, rapid bursts. “Don’t bother with any direct jinx or hexes; his Shield’s too good. Instead, use the surroundings against him. Charm or Transfigure the objects around him.”
Goyle met Harry at the corner, looking shifty-eyed and unkempt, giving the cam-eyes behind Harry a suspicious look.
“What Ron means to say is, is that we have nothing to do with this wand,” Hermione said, “and even less with an attack on Harry. Are you alright?” she added, giving Harry a look of concern.
“But you’re saying that it could have powers. I heard some of the stories, that it can gift the holder with foresight. How does that play into the myths? Achilles was a warrior, not a seer.”
I clutched Potter’s hand. “Don’t. He’s not going to break so easily.” I hauled myself to stand with my grip. He half-pulled, half-dragged me to my feet. “Torturing him would be a waste of energy.”
“That’s how Theo makes his business,” Draco said. “Every year, there are people who fancy themselves treasure hunters here looking for sunken gold or artifacts. There are probably hundreds of wrecks here. And a new law recently passed by the Greek government opens the coastline to scuba divers.”
They weren’t ordinary burglars. A chill that had nothing to do with the weather spread across his chest. What had his father gotten himself involved in? Even his death didn’t end this quagmire he had brought upon himself.
“There is another matter, my lord. Dolohov reports that the Malfoy boy was involved. He had been instrumental in the plan’s failure.”
“I wish it was a vacation,” Draco said, his gaze faraway. He wanted some time with Harry alone, just the two of them, without spies or hitmen interrupting. “It’s been so long since I’ve been in this part of the world. Though the last time I came, it wasn’t in such style.”
The lamps threw soft orange warmth over the pavements, and there were still pedestrians bustling around. It wasn’t that late or empty but walking along with Harry seemed like its own little world.
“Be careful, Draco!” My father’s bark coincided with a painful bump at my hips. I steadied the table just in time before any plates fell.
“And no, I’m not going to tell you why he left,” Granger added sternly, clearly anticipating I was going to ask that next. “That’s his business to share. He’ll tell you if he’s willing.”
“The operative term is borrowed,” Draco said. “And it was returned in one piece, wasn’t it? And so are we.”
Hogwarts ... it seemed appropriate that I would find the location of Slytherin’s Grimoire there. It was the center of it all, wasn’t it — that old castle that still played such a large role in all our lives. I wondered if Slytherin ever felt any regret when he abandoned it and the other Founders.
It was the one I had seen in my visions, and sure enough, resting on top was the Grimoire. It was smaller than I remembered, fitting squarely on top of the plinth so unassumingly. And yet … even at this distance, I sensed its power like a blazing furnace in a closed room.
“This is the only room that’s in any semi-decent state,” Potter informed me ruefully. “No one lives here except for Kreacher, and he obviously does his best to keep things up to standard, but ….” He gave a slight shrug.
“Look up family records, account ledgers, travel expenses, journals of those names,” I said. “We have to trace their movements to see if we can come up with a list of possible hiding places for the Grimoire. In the meanwhile,” I waved my wand and a pile of books flew at us, “here are some books on magical cryptography and concealment methods to figure out why that book that I found is the key to finding the Grimoire.”
Draco didn’t want to sit here talking about the coffee. “So you’re a spy now and you’re the one those two back home decided to pair me up with. Are you fucking serious?”
His body is long and lean, roughly my height, but he had the advantage of gravity as he pressed me against the bench. The cold stone I felt through the thin cashmere of my sweater contrasted pleasantly with the heat from his body. He was still wearing my robes over his. It made him look rather lumpy.
“Ready?” Potter came down in a dark, workmanlike robe. He offered his hand out to me in a manner more befitting a gentleman escorting a deb into the ballroom.
“It’s an honor to meet you, Commander,” Malfoy said finally, after a stretch of time had passed. “It’s a relief knowing we can all sleep safe at night with you and men like you out on duty.”
“Voice identification verified as Shacklebolt, Kingsley, Auror Force Head,” the console said. “Granting permission to Potter, Harry, Commander, Auror Force, for Case Number 7A.”
Draco breathed in deep. It was the only way he knew how to handle this: retreat back to the security of practiced routine. He had managed to do so five years ago in Baghdad, and he would do it again. He won’t let Harry derail him from that.
“So you were attacked by this ‘Circle’ over some book?” the Weasley said after we finished. “And you’re the only one that can use the key to find it?”
“There has to be more,” I said to Harry. “This can’t be a dead end. I know it. I can feel it in my bones that there’s more to this place than just this --” I waved my hand around the chamber.
Harry stiffened at the smarmy voice. Cormac McLaggen, Deputy Head of the Aurors and Harry’s immediate superior, had never bother concealing his dislike for Harry. And in turn, Harry had found McLaggen insufferable, too prone to boast of achievements which shone less upon second look.
Inside was a stereotypical setting so cliched it could have been a movie set. Thick velvet curtains partitioned the sitting room from what Draco assumed to be Madam Rosa’s living quarters. A circular table sat in the middle, overlaid with a delicately embroidered tablecloth. A mirror stood in the corner. Draco took a look at himself and tried to rearrange his hair, mussed from the light spring wind.
My father would likely look down his nose at whatever swill Potter was bringing. The Malfoy wine cellars were as old as the house itself. I didn’t mention this to Potter as I came out of my room.
I’m much better than an animal, Hedwig’s silent voice said in Harry’s head. He could sense the pulse of interest as she analyzed the animatronic owl on Malfoy’s arm. Those orange eyes looked back.
He watched a chicken run out of its coop. It was so carefree; all it wanted for was a handful of grains.
“I’m glad you’re enjoying your stay,” Granger said as Potter disappeared upstairs. “I was worried that the prolonged isolation was taking its toll on you.”
I ducked into the sleek, modern building where my flat was. My father objected when I moved out of the Manor, bitterly complaining that I could have at least stayed at the family townhouse in Belgravia instead of wasting my money on a flat in a residence ‘infested with Muggles’.
I was right: the piece of toast was all I could handle for breakfast. “Can we not do this in the morning? I’m finished, by the way. I’ll be in the library.”
I had not seen that book since Harry had taken me from Cross’ hideout. Right after he deposited me here, in the midst of astounded looking Healers and curious middle-aged witches, he had given me a quick kiss and left for the Ministry. I was fairly certain news of my involvement with Harry moved so quickly was because one of the gossipy hens was the aunt of the Witches Daily’s editor.
I ran to my safe, quickly dissolving the concealment spell. It was still intact. My chest remained tight as I touched it with my wand.
I turned my attention back to book, sufficiently in control of myself again. I took out my wand, rapping the book smartly.
“Ah.” I felt a little stab of guilt, though it was washed out by the relief that crashed through me. I was not mentally prepared to face him or what we did last night.
“Yes. So the best plan right now is to go on the offensive and find Slytherin’s Grimoire before they find other Slytherin descendants who will be … more pliant.”
This time, there was no assassin, no frenzied car chase through the city. They could enjoy the slowness, like moving through honey, knowing that whatever tomorrow brings, they would always have this between the two of them.
“What the hell are you thinking?” Malfoy hissed as soon as Tom was out of earshot. “Why don’t you just go up on stage, strip naked, wave your wand, and scream ‘I’m an Auror’ at the top of your voice instead? I assume whatever idiot that brought you down here already told you how most people around these parts hate the Aurors and the Ministry.”
Suspect car picking up speed, Hedwig said, breaking into Harry’s enjoyment. She added, almost apologetically: their current velocity would leave you behind if you do not accelerate.
“It’s my father,” she said, with a loud stammer. “He was on a ladder trying to fix a broken tile, and he fell. I’m so frightened – he’s barely conscious and I can’t lift him, not by myself.”
“It’s not so easy to break into my mind this time, Malfoy,” the librarian’s taunting voice sliced through. “I was unprepared last time. Try to invade my mind again and you’ll find yourself a dribbling vegetable.”
“Well, Draco, are we ready to talk now?” he asked, as we settled into the armchairs. I gripped the handle of my cup so tightly that I thought it might shatter. It was the only thing that anchored me in my tumultuous state.
“It’s true what she said, isn’t it?” I said to Harry, after we checked out. She had pointed out the quickest path to the woods as we departed for the cave, clearly under the impression that we were a simple couple with a particular proclivity for the outdoors.
If that tiny touch from earlier had overloaded Draco, then he didn’t know what to term this. Hallucinogenic ecstasy, perhaps. Draco couldn’t stop himself from drinking in the sensations, one hand automatically going to cup Harry’s chin as the other held himself steady on the desk.
“He’s my father,” I said simply. I didn’t think I needed to say any more. We sat quietly together, looking at the stars.
“That’s also why we can’t assign you any protection from the Aurors. All the ones on the team investigating are fully occupied and I don’t trust any of the ones who I haven’t vetted yet.” She stared down at the photo on her desk. Potter waved at her and gave me a dark look.
Harry chuckled. He poured himself another glass. The deep red liquid swirled against the crystal. “Same here. But how do you plan to go about this?”
“We were right about you, Mr. Malfoy,” Shacklebolt said with a slight smile. “We’ll provide you with financial renumeration, of course, and you’ll be given access to our resources for travel and other field equipment you might need. You’ll also be assigned a partner when you land.”
“I’ve already deactivated them. Besides, you’re with me on official Auror business. You have nothing to fear.”
Harry hoped that she covered her tracks. If discovered, he could arguably make an excuse to why his SI needed to access confidential files, but he hoped it wouldn’t come to that.
“The symbolism is apt, isn’t it?” Malfoy smiled a wolf’s smile. “The group that calls itself after the creature that births itself from destruction. Interesting. Not that I much object. The current Ministry … well.” He shrugged, a motion that could have meant anything.
“That is paltry reason,” Riddle said scornfully. “However, a contract is a contract. We will eliminate the troublesome pests that persist in the so called election monitoring for them. It will allow us to build up our goodwill with them.” His tone turned businesslike. “What of our other businesses?”
“You don’t need to worry about that,” Harry said, reaching around Draco’s waist. He pressed a gentle kiss on Draco’s cheek. “Not ever.”
“I don’t think you’ll win songwriter of the year anytime soon if that’s the level of your talent.” Potter grinned at me. “You best stick to those boring academic papers of yours.”
The bed sagged as Potter sat. His eyes were lit with concern. “You don’t need to pretend to be okay, Draco. What you just experienced – it’s horrible and –”
Harry grimaced. Shacklebolt won’t be pleased to be dealing with this, especially in the middle of the night. Though Shacklebolt’s bio-enhancements had all but eliminated the need for him to sleep, pumping in steroids and stimulating the nervous system to keep the exhaustion at bay, Harry knew from personal experience that the human body could only withstand so much before it broke down from the artificial treatment. Not for the first time, Harry thought it was perhaps foolhardy to tinker with what nature had already provided.
“Is the Deputy Head of Magical Law Enforcement going to arrest me?” I gave her an exhausted grin. “I think I should feel rather honored.”
“Don’t.” Harry grabbed Draco’s arm. He tilted his chin at the corner of the display case. There was a small red light that pulsed, slow and steadily, its pace almost in tune to some mysterious beat. “And I’m going to bet my life savings that the glass is reinforced.”
“You’re very observant,” Dolohov said in a mocking tone. “Why else did you think my master wanted it? It certainly isn’t for the masses.”
Harry’s proximity meant that Draco could feel the warmth from Harry’s body and smell Harry’s scent. Even in the middle of a desert war zone, it seemed that Harry still used the same cologne. It was the brand Draco used to buy Harry for holidays. And underneath it all was masculine sweat, the familiarity of it all adding salt onto the wound Harry’s reappearance had split opened.
Loathe as I were to admit it, the Weasley had a point. If I had not gone willing looking for trouble, my parents would not be in St. Mungo’s right now. And yet, another part of me rebelled at the thought. I wanted to find it. I wanted to see the stuff of legend before my very eyes and touch it with my own hands. I wanted to unravel the secrets found within this thousand-year old book.
I knew I should stow it away, take it somewhere safe, but my fingers had minds of their own. I opened it.
Draco gestured to Harry, trying to contain his excitement. Now was the time for careful precision, rather like making incisions during a surgery. One wrong move might break the device or scatter its parts into the four corners of the ocean.
The two men doubled back, the taller man holding his nose in a hand full of blood, the shorter one with his arms around his stomach. There was a new wariness in the taller man’s eyes now.
“No, it’s fine.” Potter shook his head. “It’s not money. I just hate sitting around, waiting. I get so restless. I can’t imagine what it’s like for you.”
“I do,” Draco said in annoyance. “I’m an English aristo. It’s practically a requirement.” The semiautomatic was heavy, though not much more than the shotgun he occasionally used back in the days when he had participated in clay shooting with friends, and even more rare, when his father used to organize game shoots on Manor grounds. Draco didn’t mind the bits of pottery, but to see live animals, even ones noisy and irritating as pheasants, made him gag. Just another mark of failure for Draco as far as his father was concerned.
Potter chuckled at that. “No, I suppose you’re right. Still, it can’t be easy living with that all your life.” It explained how you are the way you are, I could hear him think.
I caught a flash of surprise from him, that he couldn’t believe I was such a strong Occlumens. He had always thought me weak, a traitor who had not the strength to stay with the Cause.
“Where do you want to start?” Harry regarded Draco with a patient expression. “You kissed me first, remember?”
“We have to go!” Potter threw me onto the broom, then jumped on, his arms hemming me in to prevent me from falling as he took off.
I doused it hastily and glared at Potter. Trust a Gryffindor to goad someone trying to kill you. “You might have experience surviving the Killing Curse, but not everyone has,” I snapped. “And I’m deducting the cost of repairs for that shelf from your pay.”
“Regardless of what shape it took, and I think I can guess that the key took the shape of a book to fit into Draco’s bag and so it wouldn’t look out of place at the Gringotts’s Reading Room, it’s the map to finding Slytherin’s Grimoire before the Circle does. You said that Ted Cross is a member?”
Potter laughed. “Explains why you showed up soused. How is she? Ron’s back from the States. Bet she’s excited for that.”
“I will hide my grimoire in the home of my enemy, under that Muggle-lover’s very nose. You will guard the key to it.” It was a command, not a request, and it was phrased as such. “My grimoire will contain my wisdom and knowledge, a source of guidance to my heir. Of course, do not make it so easy for my heir to find it. Test him, for many will seek my power.” Slytherin’s face was etched with lines of age, as unmovable and cold as stone.
“He means ‘yes’,” Harry said, before Ron gave a furious reply. He shot Malfoy a stern look. “Stop antagonizing my friends, Malfoy.”
They had only returned a couple of days ago. Draco’s head was still reeling from the combination of the rapid change in surroundings – so much green! So cold! – and time zone. Not that he’d admit it. Malfoys were not so plebian as to suffer jetlag.
It was an unsatisfying and nerve-wracking experience, though Harry was familiar with more than most that the Law Enforcement Agency rarely spent its time masquerading as bait to entrap men indulging their vice. They were simply too stretched for resources. And the Aurors most definitely did not, seeing this sort of work as beneath them. Though monitoring these sorts of behavior and accumulating information on them was a different matter – once or twice, Harry had read in the files of high-ranking officials or captains of industry notes which marked out embarrassing or devastating facts on their personal life.
“Maybe I’ll lend you one of my ties,” I said, feeling my face flushed. I loosened my own. “I don’t think I trust your taste in ties, now that I think about it. And now that you’ll be seen with me, you’ll need to look the part. That means you’re coming with me to my hairstylist on Mond—”
“You’re sure you are leaving the school, master?” A man in rough, monkish robes was addressing another in a tone of deference. “I don’t know if we can carry on without you.”
Harry couldn’t disagree with that. “With your permission, sir, I would like to make sure. Besides,” he added, “this concerns an Unspeakable. We always need to be careful where they’re concerned. National security secrets and all that.”
“No,” he repeated, more softly. “I’ll help you. If you give me your word that no one will get hurt.”
He wasn’t just about to let matters rest. It was too easy to let Riddle just win like this. Draco might not be able to think of any way to resist Riddle’s demand by himself, but maybe with Harry, it would be possible for a solution to present itself.
In the meanwhile, I dug up the issue of the Quibbler that discussed this mysterious Circle. It was old, having been published a few years back, and I had to visit the British Library, Magical Section, to obtain a copy.
“I was a child, and a rather stupid one at that. So I stumbled in, because I saw my father. I thought: ‘Everything should be fine. Father’s just with his friends at some odd costume party.’ The man next to him noticed that I walked in. I still remember his face. It was a hideous face, almost snakelike, with two slits for a nose. But what I remember the most clearly was the man’s eyes. They were red, like two rubies that were set aflame.”
He tried perusing it once again, searching for clues in Homer’s description in vain. Draco’s mind was too filled with Harry to concentrate. So this was where the man hand ended up. Draco still wasn’t entirely convinced the entire affair was a practical joke. Harry, a spy? Harry had never been able to conceal his emotions and thoughts. He practically shouted them. One could always tell – or hazard a fairly accurate guess – as to when he was upset.
Draco smiled modestly. “I do enough of these inquiries in my day job. I don’t think it needs to carry over into my personal life.”
Draco waved to Harry excitedly. Harry swam over, peering curiously at the device in his hand. Draco couldn’t see Harry’s face, but from the suppressed movements, Harry was just as enthusiastic about the find as Draco was.
Greyback had backhanded Harry viciously. Draco spasmed, stopped as the Afghan man turned his gun on Draco.
So he sat, in sullen silence, eating an undeniably excellent shepherd’s pie while the others either ignored or gave him dirty scowls. The only attempt that Harry had made to bring Draco into the conversation lapsed into stony silence that Granger, of all people, had to break up by changing the topic to some Serbian leader being charged with war crimes.
“What happened?” Harry woke from my movement.  He rubbed his eyes and growled at me. “Why do you wake up so early?”
“Elixir?” The manager’s face contorted. “But we’re a respectable building – we don’t have that sort here. We screen our prospective tenants before we let any flat; you can check the records –”
“Why do you care?” Draco said bitterly. It appalled Draco how easily his cultivated mask of indifference crumpled. “Besides, how do you know I’m not changing my mind about my cooperation this very moment?”
“It’s kind of a creepy place, isn’t it,” Harry whispered to Draco. They stood in front of the columned structure. Draco wondered which ancestor had been mad for Neo-Palladian architecture.
“I should return to HQ,” Harry said finally. He extricated himself from further conversation with Fudge, who looked disappointed that Harry was leaving. The reporters had finished with the other opera-goers and the junior officers and were finally making their way past Fudge’s security. “Shacklebolt will want a full report.”
Harry knelt down to help, muttering suggestions about choice areas where Draco could stuff his degree.
“We’ll tell you the full story soon, Mr. Malfoy. But first, we want to know: did these men manage to take anything?”
“Uh huh,” he said, his tone neutral. If I didn’t know Potter, I could have sworn he sounded jealous. “You sure he won’t mind if I wear it?”
Harry placed his wand on the scanner besides the archway and walked through. Hedwig had connected to the Web component that linked HQ and displayed all the generated data in the background.
I looked at Potter. His face was earnest and set in determination. And, even in the midst of all that, he softened with sympathy when he caught my gaze.
My throat stuck. He just so casually revealed such an abomination of magic and nature. “That’s – that’s disgusting. And you said ‘them’. Plural.”
They burst into action, flinging out their explosives. The resultant bang deafened Draco’s ears as the two men charged into the ensuing melee under the cover of smoke and dust.
It made sense. The Underground was the site of the former London transit system, overran by the homeless and impoverished of the city driven out of their homes. It had become an undercity within a city for those seeking shelter. It was a haven for criminals, where prostitution, gambling, and drug abuse was rampant. The Ministry tried occasionally to purge and relocate the residents, but it proved easier planned than actually executed, and so there existed only the semblance of order.
“I assumed you met my staff,” the man continued, as though he was in the midst of a guided tour for the office. “Bellatrix, Dolohov, and Wormtail. I am Tom Riddle, though you may know me by my call sign Voldemort. Welcome to my office.”
Riddle clutched his eyes, screaming. It was an awful sound, one full of pain and fury and despair that had everyone in the room grabbing their ears.
“Did he live alone?” Harry asked, more to break the squirming silence that would ensue had none of them answered the manager. Harry had already guessed the man would be, which was confirmed with a shaky yes.
“I can’t do that,” I said. “I can’t ask you to leave your wife and children to go on some wild chase that probably will have us traipsing all over the country.”
“Your skepticism and how you’ve been taking in every detail since you entered the room,” Madam Rosa said with a gentle smile. “But perhaps we should introduce ourselves first. I’m Madam Rosa, as you probably already know.”
“While the clientele of the Leaky are varied,” Metis said, “this man stands out because he had arrived almost without detection and held himself apart from the crowd until the dead Unspeakables came in. If my security system weren’t so sophisticated, I would have missed the hooded man. He has some sort of jammer field around him. It’s good, but not as good as me.”
“Yes,” Hedwig said. “Our victim is the latest one. Keep in mind however that I don’t have access to the official files and my linking the deceased to the project could be simple conjecture.”
I shared a look with Potter. My father had no idea, but I did. As did Potter. To think that this Blood Circle gave the man who would become the Darkest wizard of recent times the means to do so.
“Considering it’s Slytherin, one of the most powerful wizards of all times, I doubt we’ll be able to overpower it. And like you said, there are too many possibilities. Even if we had time to figure what the blue flames are, we don’t have the resources to figure out what the counterspell is.”
I took a deep breath. I needed to push through the panic, to think. My first instinct was to Apparate to the Ministry and drag someone from the Auror’s Office, by force if I had to, to show him the scene. Their inaction was the cause of this.
Draco’s first instinct was to reject Mr. Weasley’s news. It couldn’t be true – his father was not shortlisted for canonization, but his father had no need to do anything as risky and illegal as laundering money for a criminal organization. And – his father would not be so foolish to be caught.
In fact, Potter was probably a better catch. The hero of the Wizarding world, with his roguish good looks, and decently well-off, not to mention his innate kindness and charm. Ginerva Weasley was a fool to divorce him.
“That man’s an Unspeakable?” Finnegan chewed his lip. “I think I understand why we’re sent now. They definitely do not want anyone else catching wind of this business.”
I stretched out on the bed, luxuriating in the additional space, feeling the knots in my muscles release. A satisfying pop sounded as I cracked my back.
“I’ve shut myself in for longer periods of time,” I said, a little taken aback and annoyed at Granger’s usual insight. Then: “It is a bit tiring being the house all day,” I admitted. “I found a bunch of artifacts in the house that I would like to take a closer look at, but I need cross-referencing materials, and this house lacks a proper library.”
Third: what was it doing in my bag? I had never set eyes on it before today. It wasn’t any book I owned, and I did not take it from the library at Gringotts. So how the hell did I appear in my bag? It wasn’t a coincidence – my intuition told me that much. If I learned anything over the past few years, it was that everything happens for a reason. It was a hard lesson, and one that I resisted, but it was engrained in me.
One man rose to his feet. He was a tall Black man, bald. There was a spark of gold from a single hoop earring.
Malfoy smiled, displaying sharp teeth. “We can’t let our Aurors just drop dead in the middle of the Underground, can we?”
“But there are people who believe it’s real enough to pay good money for it,” Shacklebolt said. “Money that directly finances the killing of our troops. So in that respect, it’s real enough.”
He really had a great smile, I thought. It wasn’t as dazzling as Blaise’s, but it was more … approachable. It didn’t leave me breathless, but it warmed me, like coming inside after being stuck in the rain.
As far as Harry was aware, Fudge had less interest in Harry’s well-being than the perception that they were friendly. It helped Fudge’s political standing to surround himself with recipients of the Order of the Imperator Britannia.
I hoped there was no truth to what she said. I did not relish becoming entangled in ancient conspiracies and secret societies. Besides, though the Quibbler had improved its fact-checking protocols since, it was still nowhere a reliable source of information. I would never include it in my citations. I’d be the laughingstock of the magical academic community.
Shacklebolt nodded gravely. “That is my job, young Potter.” Though Harry heard the note of amusement in it, it was a clear dismissal.
“It’ll be fascinating to examine it though,” Granger said, voicing some of my desires. “To see what Slytherin himself wrote in it. It’s a pity that Voldemort turned most of the Founder’s Objects into Horcruxes, or otherwise we could have looked at them in greater detail.”
He made his way down to the bar where Goyle was, his head still musing over the possibilities of what he learned.
“Afraid of letting old Slytherin spy on you in the loo?” Harry chuckled. “But I’ll hold it for you. Can you manage to find your way around?”
“Ah, yes.” I hadn’t expected him to broach the topic himself. There was a curious tingle creeping up my arm. I didn’t know how to respond. Do I take the straightforward approach and ask? Do I lie and claim its mine?
“I’ll have to,” Potter said. “I know you said you cleaned up the damage, but there still might be clues. And I’ll have to assess the vulnerability of your residence, especially since I’m assuming whoever attacked you and broke in was powerful magically.”
“Oh?” Now there was definitely a note of interest in Malfoy’s voice. He leaned in, almost stepping into the holographic display floating above the geometric tiles. “Now you’re talking. You said this was found on an Unspeakable?”
“Potter! Potter! Harry! Don’t you dare die on me, you bastard.”  I kept my wand level to his chest, struggling to maintain the spell. My eyes drooped.
Contradictory emotions crested; my ribs were tight, squeezing the breath out of me. I didn’t want to have to choose, but I knew that the time to make a decision approached, as inevitable as the sunrise.
The uniformed men who had arrived were unfortunately not Shacklebolt’s men, but armed response from the Metropolitan Police, who had arrived when summoned by a confused porter telling them the security system “was buggered.”
“You?” I looked at her doubtfully. “Don’t you have a million things to do? Not to mention, all the paperwork that’s probably piled on your desk?”
“That’s good, dear.” My mother smiled. “Send him our love. And tell him he still needs to come over for tea sometime.”
“God-father,” he corrected. “I think he might be your cousin, actually. Teddy Lupin, Andromeda’s grandson.”
The Tube at this point of the night was still busy. The car they got into was full of teenagers who barely outgrown their spots chugging water bottles full of a liquid that was clearly not water. The press of the bodies made it claustrophobically humid after being out in the open, and Draco wrinkled his nose at the unwashed bodies.
Draco had found the right man. Fletcher, if he didn’t work directly with Mors Mordre, would at least have second-degree connections to the group.
She noticed my gaze. “I had it modified so it works with the interference magical activity produces. It’s basically a machine that combines –”
Draco didn’t like the reminder of his father’s criminal past. “The unit at 2 Hyde then? It’s an investment property, but I can check if it’s unoccupied at the moment.”
Draco attempted to still his fear, taking slow sips of air through his nostrils. It was hard to breath, the atmosphere choked by dust, smelling fetid and stale. Odors of cooking clashed with sweat and unwashed bodies.
It was true; he did. He also found a sense of style – or more likely, his wife the female Weasel dressed him.
“They watched me in action, they liked me, and they recruited me. I considered what they had to offer, and I thought that I would make more of a difference with them, so I joined.” Harry sat down opposite Draco. Now that Draco managed to collect some of his bearings, he could pinpoint the subtle, less noticeable changes: there was hardness to Harry’s eyes that hadn’t existed before, a brittleness to that easy smile. Physically, there were additional scars and a tightness around his lightning-shaped scar that was the tell-tale sign of plastic surgery.
But the clues fitted: the meeting Lucius had that night he and Draco had their argument, how Mr. Weasley was genuinely surprised Draco didn’t know. Mr. Weasley, despite his relatively mediocre position, was well-placed – and more importantly, well-liked. It wasn’t inconceivable that he had heard something regarding Lucius Malfoy’s malfeasance.
Potter blinked. “I hadn’t expected you to say that. We’re not schoolboy rivals anymore, but you haven’t seemed so keen on me since – well, you know.” He gave a hopeless wave.
I tried hard not to take the bait. “This is serious, father, or we wouldn’t be involving you. It’s important. Lives are at stake.” Like mine.
“I know exactly the amount to give you, Potter. Given your body weight, how extensive your bio-modifications are, and how sophisticated your link components with your SI is, I could come up with a precise dose that would not permanently affect you.”
“You two are going to get on that water sled and go,” Theo told Bellatrix and Dolohov. Harry made a strangled protest that ended when Theo glared at Harry. “I don’t know what this is about, and I don’t want to know. But you’re wrecking my ship and hurting my friends. Consider this a very generous offer.”
Harry picked up the automatic. With a deft movement, he brought it down on Greyback’s head. The twitching ended.
I hung my head. I did. “Can it wait until after all this is over?” I asked with a small smile. “I think we have a lot on our plate right now. I’m not sure I would be able to handle the conversation while my life hung in the balance.”
“That’s a Ministry access card,” Finnegan said. “It allows access to the Ministry network on the Web from any console, including ones made for civilian use.”
“Has Commander Potter left?” he asked. It took a second for Draco to register the man was referring to Harry.
He found himself tuning Fudge out in favor of studying Malfoy. Beyond the clothes and the physical form, there was a hardness in Malfoy’s eyes, one that reflected what must be his inner thoughts behind the polite smile. It was a flintiness, like the blade of a knife, which threw off flashes of disdained enjoyment as Malfoy observed Fudge attempting to make political capital out of the event.
“I’m trying to catch him alive,” Potter shouted back as he shot a Stunner aimed at the intruder’s chest.
“Oh! I almost forgot.” Potter produced the bottle of wine. He presented it to my mother, who accepted it with dignity.
It always startled Harry to see himself reduced to a complex set of facts and numbers. He saw the statistics on his cybernetic parts follow, scrolling up in a tiny font that Harry would need to squint to read.
I slammed my mind shut with a force had me bite the inside of my cheeks. I tasted the coppery salt of blood as I summoned up all my mental barriers to repel the librarian’s Legilimency.
“You can multitask, can’t you? Besides, those two are linked somehow. I’m just as uncertain as you are about how, but all the indicators suggest that you are the best man for the job.”
But he didn’t. Harry had made it clear — he wanted nothing to do with Draco, and it was not so much a hint as it was a full-page advert.
Ron shot Malfoy an annoyed glance. “We’re not stupid, Malfoy. In any case, these types of transactions are delicate. We remember them clearly and we haven’t done any of these in a long time.”
He was not sure exactly what they meant. The Greek inscriptions were clear enough; Draco had been reviewing his knowledge of the language ever since they had returned from the Aegean. Rosier had said that the outermost ring dial matched zodiac signs, but those were rubbed off. There was only the faintest of lines that indicated they had even been there to begin with; silvery traces that might have been mistaken for glimmers of light from outside the window.
“Well, considering your other one is dead – and Heavens help us if she’s sending you flowers from beyond the grave – yes, it is Andromeda. She wants to invite you for tea sometime with her grandson, Teddy.”
“All right?” Harry interrupted Draco’s ruminations, appearing out of the caravan with a step much lighter than with which he had entered. “Why did you finish so early?”
Up close, Greyback smelled of rancid sweat and gun oil. But he carried no gun. His hands touched Draco’s face, almost like that of a tender lover, though the expression on his face was anything but.
Right on cue, the heavy thud of combat boots and the buzz of radio registered in Draco’s hearing. He heard the elevator open distantly, as well as the door bang against the wall.
Granger seemed surprised and pleased. I quickly spoke before she was tempted to explain her alterations. “Are you going to assign someone to look into this now?”
“You did follow me around a lot,” I pointed out, ignoring the pang of hurt at Harry’s refusal to name our relationship. I ignored the fact that I didn’t know what we were, either. “I’m surprised you didn’t follow me into the baths, though I suppose I should give thanks to that. My virtue remains intact.”
Inside the house, if one didn’t disable the security quickly, the door handles would shock the intruder and there were nozzles that released tear gas when one hit the panic button installed in every room.
Madam Rosa nodded. “Good. What I have here is the Rider-Waite deck, which is the most popular. There are seventy-eight cards, each with a picture, a narrative, and attendant symbolism.”
“That isn’t what we want,” Dawlish said. “If we just wanted the papers, we would’ve just taken them.”
He has to stifle his laugh at the energies of youth. Is it possible that the Malfoy boy refuses his duty out of simple lust for the Potter boy? It’s possible. Cross always thinks that the short, distracted thinking is one of their hallmarks.
When he opened it again, he was in a room just like the flat. Harry knew this was an optical trick of the brain-chip. It processed data in a way to allow Harry to make sense of it. It was a good facsimile, the only difference being that the hue was much brighter and there were no windows.
“I hope you don’t intend to just talk at me,” I said. “Let us discuss this like civilized people, over tea. I assume you are amenable to that.”
Those glory days of Malfoy prestige had passed, and Draco was forced to promise he would never abscond with Her Majesty’s property again and obey whatever orders were issued him in the future.
I exhaled. “Fine.” I had not been alone with him since he was injured. The guilt gnawed at me, though both Granger and the Healers assured me that my quick actions saved his life and prevented any permanent injuries.
I explained quickly the book that I found in my bag, the vision it gave me, what I saw in the vision.
“We can discuss this all at a later time,” Shacklebolt said, seeing Draco stifle a yawn. “You must be tired after all this. I’ll have someone take you to rest.”
And we needed to know what my father had seen or heard, either personally or from whispers, about the Dark Lord’s ties with the Circle. My father, as much as I hated the fact, counted amongst his inner circle. The Dark Lord did not confide in anyone, but Lucius Malfoy would never be so inattentive to the currents of power.
That meant nothing. Now that I experienced that – vision, there was no other term for it – I knew this was no ordinary tome. I heard of books like this; my father had once told me of a journal carrying a fragment of a soul that defied all attempts at magical inspection.
Draco filed the information about Weasley and spiders for future use later. “I don’t think it’ll be rigged to keep anyone out. Remember, this was supposed to be hideout, not for storing hidden treasures. We have a vault in the Manor for that.”
“Infiltrators, not ‘filth.’” I gave a twisted smile. “Of course, paranoia isn’t a particularly endearing trait either. Especially in a pedagogical setting. And we know that the solution to fear isn’t more fear, but understanding and empathy”
I had to look away before I become sucked in any further. I coughed. “So what’s the plan? I was thinking that we go back. To the Manor. To retrieve the book-key. And you can take the opportunity to look for clues.” There was only the slightest hitch in my voice when I thought of the Manor. Granger said most of the damage was contained, and yet I could not erase the image of it burning —
“I think I still have an old set of Auror robes somewhere,” he murmured. “Maybe I’ll use a restraining spell on you. You’d like that, wouldn’t you? Having me tie you down?”
“Good thing it’s my left,” Draco joked. Then: “Wait? How do you know that man? Are you Secret Service too?”
“I promise.” Draco steeled himself, his hand clenching around the handle. In spite of the bravado he had just displayed, his blood chilled at the possibility he might actually be forced to take a life.
Draco recalled tracing his fingers over that scar, pressing a gentle kiss against it before continuing with their lovemaking. He flushed, turning away from Harry.
“What? You don’t think that the Cruciatus stopped working just because I pulled you out of there, do you?”
Malfoy pulled up his sleeve. There was a nasty gash that in certain light could be mistaken as a tattoo of a serpent and a skull, but Harry didn’t miss the small puncture marks around it. “As a matter of fact, I do.”
His wand flashed out in an arc, quicker than any of us could move. A flash of light filled the room. I shouted, putting my arm across my eyes to shut out the light.
“This has been an interesting way of filing an incident report,” I said. “I come to you for help and instead you’re asking me to assist you in a dangerous case.”
Harry grabbed me by the cuff, pulling me out through the hole in the wall. We fell in a heap of tangled limbs, hitting the ground with a thud.
Draco saw Harry, battered, glare defiantly. But there was also a flicker of triumph, and Draco knew what he needed to do.
I watched as shadows seemed to spill from the book-key like spilt ink, pooling under it. The book-key itself disappeared. In its stead was a liquid-like substance that seemed to absorb what little light there was in the room.
“I bet Harry feels ‘well-handled’ right now.” The Weasley winked at me. I resisted the urge to toss a pillow at him.
There was a wobble in the chair. Potter drew back. I shot him a look of annoyance, my lips chewed and chapped.
I raised a Shield reflexively. And felt the heat of his spell hammer at it with a heavy impact that had me winded and taking a step back.
He gave me a rueful look, falling out of his sharp focus for a moment. “Besides, I know you can defend yourself.”
Goyle and I had always gotten along, even if I did behave like a little snot with him. But that year ... with everything my family suffered, the terror on us a shadow that no light would banish, we couldn’t act like nothing was happening. And after the War ... not only him, but all my friends and family, they questioned why I had turned away from all our mutual upbringing and our heritage. They didn’t seem to understand it was that toxic heritage which brought the War in the first place.
There was a knock as a house-elf laid out our lunch tray. He bowed, and, upon seeing Potter, gave an even deeper one at him, before vanishing.
“No. He piques my interest.” Riddle considered his men. “Double the effort to recover the papers. And as insurance, retrace our communications with the ones whose research led us to the Shield.”
Harry had only been in the office for less than two hours before Finnegan had all but hauled him off to one of the somber-colored official hovercars that the Aurors used when discretion over speed was called for.
I smiled to myself. I would have considered this night a success had no fisticuffs occurred; this was beyond my expectations.
“Yes….” Fudge seemed put out at Malfoy’s intervention. Harry was, too. The cold, cultured quality of Malfoy’s words were slightly sour, but Harry couldn’t deny that it saved him from Fudge’s invitation. “Mr. Malfoy is right. You’re needed at your job. There’s been a high increase in crime lately. We’ll need to unveil new policies soon.”
“Yes. Mundungus Fletcher has requested several items from us for sale to a private collector. We have taken the usual procedure. The goods are being transferred to the warehouse.”
It smelled horribly fragrant, but they had no cover otherwise from which to observe any comings and goings. So far, they saw nothing, only a few construction workers and someone who looked like he might be the foreman leave.
There – again! The words slipped out of focus for a second before resetting into their tiny serif font. For a moment, I imagined that it had slipped into the curling loops of handwritten letters.
Potter laughed at my expression. “Don’t look too disappointed. At least nothing’s exploding in our faces.”
Nothing happened. I lowered my wand an inch. It would have alerted me to any other humans in the vicinity, though if they managed to break my protection spells, they might have also found a way to evade detection.
“No, no. It’s fine.” Potter got up. I sat back, fastidiously rearranging my clothes to be more presentation. It was a silly exercise; Granger had caught us en flagrante, and there was no going back.
“You make it sound so easy,” Hermione said. “I would laugh, but I think you’ve proven yourself to be more than capable of it.”
There was a second volley. Even as they hit, the car began to move again, screeching to a start. It turned sharply from the curb where the car had rammed into, when – the driver – Draco couldn’t think. His mind blanked, he only managed to hold onto the seat legs for stability. It was by some miracle that his hands hadn’t been thrown off by the speed with which Harry drove. It was a miracle that the bullets hadn’t made it into the car again.
“Really?” That seemed rather haphazard, and these were all just offices. “Are you sure? How long do you think we need to search for it? There could be dozens of hiding places.”
“I’m sure Commander Potter is needed to ensure our streets are safe,” Malfoy said in a smooth drawl. “We can spare him the pleasure of our company – after all, how else will we be able to walk through London without fearing that we’ll be attacked by gangs?”
Harry winked. “Does that mean you’ll finally stop following me around?” Then he became serious. “But it is dangerous out here, Draco. I did tell you that. So if you want to leave, please don’t hesitate. You don’t need to prove anything.”
There was a tinkle of laughter from the other table. Soft chimes of silverware and wineglasses were a subtle accompaniment to the New Age instrumental playing. This was a very trendy, very upscale restaurant. Who would have expected a possible criminal transaction taking place at the very moment?
“Where are you taking me?” Instinct told me there was no fighting Potter when he was in hero mode. I was not wholly opposed to it either. “I can take care of myself, you know.”
“We have ways to penetrate those shrouds,” Harry said, taken aback that Grey Eyes knew that. From Grey Eyes’ appearance, one couldn’t see anything apart from a rich socialite, albeit one that was stunningly handsome, like a work of filigreed silver. Harry certainly hadn’t expected the man to be so familiar with hovercars and their web-link components.
We arrived at the Manor in a flurry of movement. I quickly let go of Potter’s arm as we emerged from the grate.
Wormtail complied, his awkward shuffle conveying sulkiness. He dropped them on the table next to Draco without meeting Draco’s eyes.
I glared at him. That incident seemed to bring him endless mirth. “No. If you must know, she highly recommends your services, though your professionalism seems a bit lacking.”
“Mr. and Mrs. Malfoy are fine,” Granger said. “Mr. Malfoy suffered extensive smoke inhalation and magical damage, but he’ll live. Mrs. Malfoy is with him at St. Mungo’s right now.”
I popped back into the inn. I hadn’t really needed to use the restroom, had only employed it as a convenient excuse so I had space to think. I would give Harry ten minutes of privacy with his parents while I bought a cup of coffee from the inn’s café before rejoining him.
And Potter … part of my restlessness had to do with him. Or rather, if I were honest, most. The longer I remained in close quarters with him, the more my resolve to maintain my distance crumbled.
“Those men work for a criminal organization,” Shacklebolt said, “the same one that was linked to your father’s … work. They’re members of a syndicate called the Mors Mordre, a group that has been linked to financing terrorism, drug-dealing, assassinations, and other acts of political intimidation and violence. In other words, not very nice people.”
“That’s right,” Harry said, after they entered Malfoy’s private box overlooking the dance floor. It was sumptuously decorated space with plush red velvet and silken pillows. “I’m following up on the leads of the victim I questioned you about earlier.”
“Mother!” When did my mother become bosom buddies with Potter, of all people? “Besides,” I said with a dignified air, “I ate my chips.”
My father stayed seated. He raised an eyebrow at me. “It’s good to see you, Draco. Mr. Potter. Imagine my surprise when your mother told me you’re bringing a guest that you neglected to mention in your letter to me.”
“Well, our systems couldn’t analyze them except to tell they’re some sort of plugins for the web components between SI and our biomechanical parts.”
It was just as well; Draco didn’t know if he could stomach the idea of having his hopes raised and rejected over unpalatable food. They had kept their conversation light, confined to the oh-so-British topic of the weather, though learning about how the spring was like in Afghanistan was infinitely more interesting than discussing whether it would rain back in Wiltshire.
“You should relax, take a break,” Goyle said. “Get laid. You’ve been in a hole lately. You work too hard.”
I moved my legs gingerly. I was wobbly but unharmed. I debated chasing after the librarian, but he had no doubt disappeared by now. In any case, Gringotts security were arriving: goblins with wickedly sharp axes and wizards in the gold livery appeared with their wands out. They surrounded me with unpleasant looks.
It was a hollow with space enough for roughly two or three people. It was well-maintained, if sparse, with the walls sturdy and the dirt floor clear of debris. It was empty as far as Draco could see.
“Then I’ll need to give you a backrub when this is all over.” Even without looking at his face, I could hear the grin in Harry’s voice. “Maybe a foot rub, too. For your tired, old, aching bones.”
“You did a good job, and then because of that business with your father, the museum you were part of fired you.”
Fletcher stood up. “I think I might just have what you’re looking for, Mr. Malfoy. Why don’t we wrap up dinner and go to my office? It’ll be much more private there.”
Draco stood, blood rushing to his cramped shoulders. “You could have been killed. How did you know he had a knife in the first place, anyways?”
Again, the man wondered at the strange workings of Fate. What twists had made the Malfoy boy, and not his father or his forebearers the critical piece to their plans? He wanted to laugh.
“Oh.” Potter was mercifully silenced as we entered the room at that moment. Here, my parents still kept the pretenses of the old days, that we were amongst the first families of the Wizarding world. A grand tapestry dating back to the Norman Conquests hung on the walls, and a great table covered by a white tablecloth dominated the room. It was lit by two ornate silver candelabras and a Venetian chandelier that tinkled softly every time it swayed.
Harry nodded. “I agree. I think there’s probably an entrance around here somewhere concealed by magic. But do you know how to find it?”
We were silent for a moment. After that interruption and the bomb of an offer Granger dropped, neither of us were particularly in the mood to do anything, though my cock twitched occasionally as I settled back against the swell of Harry’s chest.
Harry did not engage in much introspection, but walked in, as blithely as I would into Harrods. I followed with considerably more caution.
Harry hadn’t been kidding about the house being secure. Not only did it have a highly sensitive alarm that would snare a fly sneaking in through the window, but all the entrances were able to be sealed by bulletproof barriers. The front door in particular was welded steel, the same kind bank vaults used. Cameras ringed the perimeter.
Harry was the first to turn away. “Yes,” he said, and he sounded like he was in the middle of a cold. “We are.”
“Hello, Draco,” Harry said, when Draco didn’t respond. “Do you want sit down and close your mouth before a fly slips in?”
“No.” And Draco wasn’t. He was agitated, yes, but from the anticipation, and he could barely control his nerves, but he wasn’t frightened. Strangely, the knowledge that he should be, that danger lurked, only made him more eager. “I’m excited. This is the first time I’ve done any thing substantive in a long time.”
I cursed at the slip-up – Muggles used the term doctors, not healers, but she didn’t seem to notice, as agitated as she was.
“Alright.” Harry gave me a peck. “Let’s take a nap. I want to get some food later, and then there’s a place I need to visit.”
But he wasn’t imagining them now. It was unmistakable, the sound of shuffling papers and rummaging stationery – Draco heard the heavy scrape of his father’s Baccarat ashtray across the oak desk.
“Oh, but my dear Draco, we are so much more than your storybook villains.” Dolohov leaned in. His breath was foul. “You’ll find out soon enough.  I suppose young Harry here hasn’t told you anything.”
“I itched to get out of the office every time. And the politics. Merlin, there was so much politics. Who stole the credit from who, who got to be placed on the special forces, who should have been commended to the Hit Wizards. And then there was the Ministry politics.” Potter shook his head. “I was dragged out so often to the meetings to remind every other department that the Aurors had the ‘golden boy’ and deserved a larger share of the budget.”
“Then should we return to the master?” Wormtail asked timidly. “After all, there really is nothing for us to do there.”
… It faded into a plush living room with a roaring fireplace that gave off a claustrophobic impression. The librarian faced someone in an ornate armchair that was almost a throne. The figure in the chair was cloaked by the brightness of the fire and the resultant shadow thrown.
“But what did you find?” Theo asked, his curiosity overcoming his disdain for ‘that little thing.’ “It looks like a clock.”
“Even so, you can’t just stop and ask everyone you encounter if they had seen the people you want. Do you know how many people are down here?”
“And what do you need me to do?” Potter asked after an interminable length of silence . “Are you asking me to join you on your search?”
Maybe he should have confided in Shacklebolt from the beginning. It hadn’t occurred to Harry to do so; Harry knew that were it not for the bureaucratic restrictions, he could have well managed on his own.
He remained standing where he was. The others crowded in, even Harry. Draco didn’t miss that there was two guns that were cocked.
Cross cursed and turned to deal with them. In the split second that he was distracted, Potter grabbed me and pulled me aside. With a wave of his wand, he vanished the window and threw me out.
“Apparently Unspeakables have leeway to come and go as they please for national security reasons,” Hedwig said. “Their entry and exit register in our system, but they don’t trigger any alarms.”
“Voldemort was unwieldy,” the librarian said, stretching out the name with distaste. “He was too deep in his megalomania to be of use in the end. He would have been the most suitable candidate for the key, being the actual Heir of Slytherin.”
For a while there was nothing, only the faint clicks of the gears and the shallow breaths of anticipation.
“They’re not worth your loyalty,” Harry said. “They’ll use you and discard you when you’ve outlived your usefulness.”
And met with blazing pain. I was on the highest tower the night I failed to kill Dumbledore – I was faced with the Dark Lord, his face as still as marble while he raised his wand and agony twisted my very veins – I saw a Death Eater casually backhand my mother as she stood between me and him –
Shacklebolt arrived a few minutes later. In contrast to the heavy body armor of the police, he and Dawlish both came in suits that looked to be well-ironed despite it being almost the crack of dawn. They had exchanged a few hushed words with the leader that Draco, however hard he strained, missed.
Ensconced in a comfortable armchair and armed with a strong cup of coffee, Draco was ready to re-read his father’s papers.
Ron, on the other hand, had sprouted from the tall, gangly boy into a broad-shouldered man with a suspicious gaze that was now directed at Harry.
“This smells good,” Potter said, helping himself to a heap of potatoes. “We should thank Kreacher for cooking.”
More accurately, it was an explosion which set off a chain reaction of dust erupting. It took a good time minutes before Draco could breathe properly.
Potter made a face at me. “I’m hungry. Going through all these makes me ravenous.” He paused, taking in the number of books, now organized into neat stacks by me. “How much more do we need to go through?”
“You don’t know anything either?” That was odd. Aurors weren’t called in for the average crime, and Harry was considered too high-ranked now to be used on cases which either required his experience and skillset, or needed someone with enough profile to reassure the masses.
It was a long way from their public-school days when they couldn’t stand to be in the same room without sneers and insults. Then they encountered each other again in Iraq. Draco was with a group of British Museum archaeologists trying to track down looted artifacts from the Iraqi Museum in the aftermath of the American invasion. Harry had been the military detail assigned for their protection. Even now, the sight of Harry in fatigues stirred his desire – back then, it hit him like a train. Draco liked to tell himself it was a combination of the desert heat and enforced celibacy from long hours, but who was he kidding? Harry was attractive, a drink from an oasis in the middle of all that dust and danger.
“All the Unspeakables who were involved with the Hallows project are dead,” Harry said. “They all apparently visited the Underground before their deaths.”
“I didn’t want you to get caught up in this,” Harry said, and he had dropped to a whisper now. “I didn’t want to see you doing what you’ve just done. I didn’t want to be the cause of why you have to sacrifice your principles or put yourself in danger just for me.”
There was a collective slackening of tension as the group relaxed. It was dark in the basement even with the wandlight. I could barely make out any finer details past the initial outlines of the objects.
Potter curled one hand on the nape of my neck, the other gripping my thigh. I groaned against his mouth. I was hard, every part of me that came into contact with him on fire.
They moved on to lighter fare, Draco’s mood improving when the food arrived. He savored the richness of the laksa broth, his worries evaporating as they continued to talk.
“Might be a good idea,” Draco said with a strangled laugh. He didn’t stop with the kisses, mouthing Harry’s earlobe, trailing from his collarbone down his chest, on the flat planes of Harry’s stomach as Harry untwisted to undress.
He waved goodbye to Harry, conscious of how much he wanted to drag his lips across Harry’s back. Draco flushed, remembering his wank last night. It wouldn’t do to want Harry. Not at all.
I flushed. My sexual preferences weren’t well known. For the most part, I lived more celibate than a monk, but the one time I was enjoying myself in the Room of Requirement, Goyle had rushed in to warn me about someone passing by — and caught me in a compromising position with a dildo.
“Let’s not get too hasty,” Shacklebolt interrupted. “After all, they did help. And we can’t have the public getting wind of this, can we? Or otherwise we wouldn’t be called the Secret Service. These two have managed to take down one of our top targets, and all in a night’s work.”
“You said that last time,” Dolohov said, and his face tightened at the recollection. “What makes you think that we will trust you this time?”
It must have been a trick of the light, but I thought I saw a blush creep across his face. Whatever it was, he recovered quickly, gesturing at himself. “I didn’t know it was so formal. I mean, it is business, but it’s also with your parents.”
It was nighttime when we reached Godric’s Hollow, having dawdled at the lake for longer than expected, too caught up in each other’s presence to pay much attention to the time. We got … distracted.
“Mother seems to like you,” I spoke after a while. I became aware of our proximity. We were touching, our thighs grazing. I had a ridiculous urge to rest my head on his shoulder.
Draco gave Dolohov a puzzled look. “I’m an archaeologist and historian. It’s already far-fetched enough that I believe this is the actual Shield of Achilles. Now you want me to find out the deeper meaning behind the shit I saw caused by what was probably heatstroke?”
“You smell nice,” he said, nuzzling my neck. His stubble tickled my skin. This was deeply intimate for two people who were supposed to be in a casual sexual relationship. Bu it was a pleasant sensation, being held by Harry, and I swallowed my objection.
What was I going to do? I had several leads but nothing substantial on the mysterious book in my possession. “I’ll be in the Gringotts Reading Room,” I decided aloud. “You’re welcome to join me after if you want.”
“Apparently the Department of Mysteries don’t share your concern,” Malfoy said dryly. “These chips link the SI directly to your biomechanical components to enhance reflexes and strength by releasing certain chemicals on command. They can also be used on drone bodies, to connect a simply constructed body for the SI to control.” He cocked his head. “If the Sentient Intelligence is advance enough, maybe even more than one.”
There was no other way to describe it; that banshee’s howl, that stumble of pain — something had clearly gone wrong.
“Why the hell would we have anything to do with any attacks on Harry?” Ron burst out. “We might not talk anymore, but he’s my mate and we would never hurt him –”
Potter did the same. We sat in silence; if Potter felt any sort of discomfort or awkwardness, he did not display it. He was remarkably at ease.
We both lifted our wands, illuminating the cave. Stone walls rose all around, slick and glistening with the damp, and covered with lichen and moss. There was nothing else, to my disappointment. Not the plinth I had seen in my vision, not even a crack that marred the smooth rockface around us.
“It’s no problem.” In better times I would cavil at its condition, but right now ….  I shook my head. “You don’t live here?” I realized I knew so little about Potter. And yet, the short time we had spent together was like an eternity to me ….
Draco took a suppressed breath. He locked his eyes straight ahead, not wanting to see Harry shoot men – even men that had no compunction firing on them – in cold blood.
“It was my idea,” Draco said. “I was the one that decided breaking into one of the most prestigious building was a good idea.”
The sound of an incoming car interrupted – along with the unmistakable shot of a gun. Draco reacted out of instinct, diving under a boulder. He heard indistinct shouts, peeking out just in time to see the two men making their getaway in a nondescript silver sedan.
“I don’t know,” he said finally. “Logically, it would be very difficult to. But my intuition – he didn’t seem like the man who would commit suicide, not even to take his enemies with him.”
“You would be too if you were attacked and kidnapped,” I retorted, tearing it open. I unfolded the letter.
I rubbed my arms. What had happened seemed entirely out of place: both my reaction from touching the book and the librarian’s behavior. The Gringotts Reading Room was created in the aftermath of the War, like so many things, out of a spirit of magical cooperation. It was the reading room for the library to the Public Repository of Shared Magical Treasures in Gringotts Bank. Its catalogue was small, far eclipsed by the Hogwarts Library and the British Library, Magical Section; but Gringotts being the vault of choice for precious magical items, it quickly became popular for magical historians who lived in London and had niche areas of interests such as myself.
They got into the taxicab, speeding along Embankment. Draco’s head drifted pleasantly from the aftereffects of the alcohol. Looking out, Draco took in the flaring pinpricks that pierced through the glass.
“You bastard,” Harry gasped. Malfoy’s hands explored Harry’s body with a familiarity that left Harry writhing. “Don’t – ugh, fuck, that feels –”
Riddle shook his head. “There are no backup. Besides, even if they are, they wouldn’t come in without your signal. And you won’t be able to send that in any case.” He smiled, prominent teeth against thin lips.
That sparked an idea. I could seek protection from the Aurors. After all, this was what our tax paid for. They were much better trained than I to apprehend someone who attacked me in broad daylight.
Bellatrix held up her hands. “I can see when we’re beaten,” she said, in a silken purr that raised Draco’s hackles even more than the shooting. “We’ll leave.”
Shit. Their exchange had caught even more attention. Even the inebriated Goyle sensed the frisson of menace in the air, inched away from Harry.
He had to remind himself to be discreet. Though he was in a position of trust and favor at the moment, Harry understood all too well that any act of carelessness could bring everything he worked for into ignominy. Harry knew he was scrutinized by others, most doing so out of curiosity for a minor celebrity with the novelty of having achieved his fame by being good at his job, but others had a less benign goal. Harry knew McLaggen, for one, would love to hear of anything that could hurt Harry.
“I bet. All this time, I had thought the librarian hated me because he lost someone in the War. Instead….” I was strangely relieved to know that. I was not at fault.
Granger laughed. “Who would have thought Draco Malfoy would be a dedicated bibliophile? If you need anything, you can just let us know. How are you with the progress on breaking the protections on the book-key?”
He was strangely fussy about ties. Not so much that he cared which one he wore, but rather like a child who disliked being put by adults into formalwear. It took longer than I expected before he acquiesced to one.
“Come on, Ron, let’s go.” Granger pulled Weasley away. They disappeared into the hallway. There was a faint smack and Weasley’s yelp of pain. Draco heard a distinct “What was that for?” before they dropped out of earshot.
I gripped my wand, aware of how exposed we were. Though all of us had threw up Disillusionment charm, and hid behind the white fence, it was still easy to spot us if one knew what they were looking for. Not to mention if there were any detection spells that Granger’s team had failed to disable.
I let out my breath. Well, that was my good deed of the day. I needed to remember Muggles don’t call it healing anymore – not that I planned to interact much with them in the future. But one never knew –
Rosier believed that the Decoder had been lost in a storm when the ship that was meant to bring it to Alexander in his newfound city of Alexandria in Egypt foundered. The blueprint created by Aristotle had been left at Rhodes, which was a center of astronomy and mechanical engineering in antiquity, and those who had studied it had used it to recreate the Decoder in the form of Antikythera Mechanism. Rosier had said the later engineers modified it to be purely astronomical in function.
“Can’t be showing up for your big celebration without your approval,” he said. “Are you ready to go?”
I almost sagged in relief. Cross had not taken it. It laid on the table innocently, a plain, hardbound book without cover or any markings, one among many,
The Weasley, who had remained sitting quietly until now, spoke: “And what are we going to do after we find the Grimoire?” He gave me an unreadable look. “Are we just going to place it in a vault in Gringotts and let it gather dust? Or use it? What if we simply stop looking for it and destroy the Circle? Wouldn’t that solve all our problems?”
“We look at the past through tinted glasses, don’t we? Whether they’re rose-colored or some darker shade.”
“I might be old, but apparently life still has surprises in store for me,” she continued. “You here with Mr. Potter being one. Perhaps the results of your inquiry can be another. I assume you’ll let me know after you’ve ascertained the results?”
Malfoy laughed. “You really don’t think a person like me would be the generous, civic-minded type, do you? I assume you’ve read my files before you came. Or maybe you didn’t. Not that it’s my place to comment on the intelligence of our vaunted Auror force.”
Harry, meanwhile, cocked his gun, and aimed again, this time at Dolohov. But Dolohov had recovered, his sled speeding away. The shot fell harmlessly into the water.
He touched the Shield. The gold heated under his fingers. It was smooth and worn, and Riddle had an image of the heroes of old holding it.
There were two men. The one who came out of the driver’s side limped bandy-legged towards the step. Closing in, Harry saw that the man was short and grubby, with a large bald patch on top of his head.
“Interesting.” Draco set the Decoder down again. “I don’t think platinum was used in antiquity except as an alloy.”
He stirred now, as if his dreams were not entirely pleasant. But that was no surprise – this boy who made a mockery of all that the man held sacred. The man’s hand flexed, and he longed to hold a pillow over the Malfoy boy’s face until the body stilled.
“Unlike my parents, I love London, but I do miss the sky out here sometimes,” I said. I looked up. “That’s Mars over there, isn’t it?”
“It’s too far,” Draco said. “I would be missing what happens.” This must be how a volcanologist feels, Draco thought. Most of the time, it’s mind-numbingly boring, but when the moment comes, it’s all hands on deck.
Draco shook his head. “No, I think I’m going to step outside. Get some air. That one card was – well, I’m still not a believer, but –”
“Of course, dear,” my mother said, looking up from her conversation with Potter about my Aunt Andromeda and her grandnephew – who also turned out to be Potter’s godson. I had forgotten about that. “You’re always welcome to come look at the books in the library. I think you’re the only one who takes out those dusty things.”
Harry supposed it made sense, given the identity of its owner. Unspeakables were human too; they might occasionally want to work from home.
Potter looked dubiously at me. I stretched my face in my best smile. Somehow, it did not feel quite up to standard. I wanted him to go, not least so he could bring back news. His hovering was touching, but unwelcome. I could take care of myself. After all, that was what I insisted to my parents every time they pushed me to move back to the Manor.
This time, when they kissed again, Malfoy sucking on Harry’s tongue, Harry allowed himself to be taken over by raw sensation. He wanted to do much more than just lie there, wanted to touch Malfoy everywhere.
He was shirtless, his bare chest bronzed even in the washed-out lamplight. Broad in the shoulders and well-defined, with a light dusting of dark hair, it tapered down in a lean physique that remained powerful despite the overall slender build. I stood, transfixed, my eyes traveling down to Potter’s ridged stomach, taut with muscles. My fingers flexed, and I longed to glide along its surface.
Harry rolled his eyes. “Well, I can look through the Auror database to see if there’s a match among the manufacturers –”
Harry saw the wrist-prong lying by the side. He removed one of the cufflink that contained Hedwig’s Core and unbuttoned his cuff. It was a simple model compared to the ones in the Ministry office, but it was still far beyond the norm for home computers. Harry supposed the deceased did work at home often enough to justify this addition.
“Oh! I remember that incident you’re referring to,” Granger said. “It was in Norfolk, right? I didn’t know it was because the house itself got offended.”
“It’s a date,” Draco said, and blushed at his choice of word. “That is, if we ever figure out what to do,” he added lamely.
Draco took a sip of his coffee before it went cold. It would make sense, then, to explain what the Shield did when he was examining it.
“I’m glad you like them,” Harry said self-consciously. “I wouldn’t know what to do with them. They’re not really my color, and I don’t really know how to put them on, you’ve seen me with a tie –”
There was no irregularity noted in any of the systems except for one energy spike, Hedwig said. It wasn’t a big energy spike, but it was one deviation from the norm the building usually sees.
“And why,” Draco asked, managing to keep his voice level, “was there a reason for you to watch my house in all that time?”
I was out of places to run. I knew, as surely as the sun would set, that my past would be there wherever I looked from. Both the good and the bad, the memories I cherished and the moments I dreaded. They were interwoven, both taking up part of me.
I gritted my teeth. It was endurable but unpleasant. I knew from my training that as awareness of mental invasion grew, the more painful the process became. It was the mind’s natural way to defend itself.
“Our main priority should be escaping,” Harry had said after a heated debate. “If we find the Shield, fine. But that’s not number one on our list.” It was an uneasy compromise that they had no choice but to accept.
“The Circle,” I interrupted. “They call themselves the Circle. They have links to the Dark Lord and the Death Eaters, pureblood supremacy, that sort of thing.”
They were careful to tiptoe up, despite Draco’s urge to take two at a time. Even so, it still rang with the brightness of a clarion. Draco swallowed. Harry had taken his gun out, tucked discreetly under his other arm as to shield it from view.
Madam Rosa laughed. “You’re a skeptic, I see. Well, I don’t claim to be Nostradamus, but a reading is highly personal, even among a couple such as you two. It’s also an opportunity for you to unburden yourself in private.” She gave the two of them an unreadable glance. “If you two insist, however, I can do a couple’s reading.”
“You know why I was out of sorts,” Draco snapped. His sense of aggrievement, combined with what he had just learned, lashed out. “I know all of you think we’re just a family of crooks and you’re waiting for us to fuck up. So spare me the false pity and fuck off.”
“Well – all of them. Apparently, you singlehandedly thwarted an assassination attempt on the Minister that involved a hovercar, a light stylus, and a bottle of champagne.”
The fear that gripped me, the panic that came over which had wiped all thoughts from my mind when I saw him down –it was fresh and even remembering sent me in a terrified rage. They had almost taken my family away; I would never allow them to take Harry, too. Even as I tried to convince myself that what we had was a casual fling, it was becoming much more than that.
“If I weren’t the one stopping my friend here, you’d be dead,” Draco said lightly. It wasn’t true; Draco didn’t think Harry would kill an innocent more than he would sprout gills, but Fletcher wasn’t aware of that. Fletcher also wasn’t aware of Draco and Harry’s affiliations. “Think of that as a goodwill gesture. And I haven’t misrepresented my financial circumstances. I can meet your needs – if you prove cooperative.”
“Are you jealous?” Blaise snaked an arm around Malfoy too. “Don’t be. I don’t mind being … double-booked.”
“They came to meet us here, at the manor. I still remember it clearly. They had on robes that covered their entire faces so we would not be able to identify them and concealment spells that hid their voices and other identifiers.
Shacklebolt shared the same thought evidently. “I suppose in light of what happened tonight, it’s understandable. But don’t make a habit of involving unrelated people in Service business, Harry.”
“You flatter me,” she said. Her voice was low, melodious, and tinged with the certainty of a fanatic. “I am only a messenger. It is my master that the credit to those works of art must be attributed.”
Harry rubbed his head. He needed to leave as quickly as possible. Obviously, this club’s atmosphere of decadent debauchery was beginning to affect him.
After a few minutes of looking around, Harry’s eyes fell on the console. There was nothing else in the room which appeared out of the ordinary. “Hedwig, access the console.”
“’Course not, Mr. Malfoy. My concoctions are works of art. It would be an insult to tamper with them.”
“So, Draco, how are you spending your time these days?” my father asked. “Still wasting your time buried in those books of yours?”
“What is it?” Shacklebolt asked. “You typically don’t come into my office for anything unless I call for you.”
“That makes sense, I suppose,” Harry said. “But how do we find it? Godric’s Hollow and its surroundings isn’t easy to search for a small book.”
“I think I remember seeing you somewhere,” I said brightly. Potter seemed to count him both as friend and staff, and he probably knew something. At least hopefully the reason for his employment. “School?”
A keening screech like nails clawing on a blackboard wailed throughout the room.  I stuffed my hands to my ears, trying to shut out it out as we retreated.
“You Aurors never really think, do you?” Harry could just make out Goyle shaking his head. “With conditions in London the way they are, do you really think ordinary people could afford to live up there? Even if they could somehow manage to squeeze out a living, they’ll still be harassed by the sheer number of restrictions you lot have placed. Down here, while it isn’t ideal, it’s much freer and survivable.”
It was Draco’s own interaction with Weasley children which provided a greater source of conflict. Ron Weasley had been the target of Draco’s schoolboy abuses and taunts – and incidentally also Harry’s best friend. The news that Harry had begun dating Draco had caused one of worst arguments between the two friends – it was the only time that Draco had opted to sleep on the couch in his own flat, not wanting to intrude on Harry’s obvious emotional turmoil.
The enamel on the details were intact too. They were mesmerizing, drawing the eye in with its minute accuracy. The Earth, sun, and moon took center, surrounded by the constellations. And moving outward were depictions of life as the Myceneans knew it – farming, war, festivals. Even as Draco examined it, these images flickered, shimmering. They changed, the swords into guns, the plows into tractors –
“It’s not a spell they teach you in grad school, is it?” He looked at me with his mouth still chewing. “I can’t imagine somehow that schools teach that in between seminars and symposiums.”
“How would you know?” Harry snapped, goaded into anger now. “How would you know anything about this?”
“Harry Potter, you need to use your imagination. Besides,” Draco took Harry’s hand with a grin. “I’m sure we can make it work.”
Or … a more prosaic idea came to mind: I could simply try to read what the book had to say. I wanted to hit myself for not thinking that earlier.
“’This is a business transaction,’” Fletcher mimicked. “God, all you posh boys are the same. What I wouldn’t do to take you down a notch –”
“Yes.” This would definitely fall under the Auror Force’s umbrella. “That means we need to be thorough in our report. We also need to check everything in this room to make sure nothing of Hopkirk’s work is left in the open.”
“It was your idea to come out here,” Draco pointed out. “In this place where there’s not even a half-decent hotel with proper room service.”
“I used it before. More than once,” Potter said apologetically. He seemed to read my thoughts. “I’m surprised you didn’t want to go to Hogwarts. It’s where Slytherin’s greatest work is. He has a chamber of secrets there.”
“I think I might have what you’re looking for,” Fletcher said, baring a toothy smile. “You seem to be just in luck, your interest arriving at the same time a package of these goods arriving from abroad.”
“You’re new here, aren’t you?” a smooth voice asked. It was so close that the breath tickled Harry’s ear. Harry almost jumped, drawing out his wand.
They put the DPVs into the water and got into the wetsuits. Draco felt the oxygen flowing instantly as the mask went over his face. He turned on the camera and looked at Harry. Harry was ready, slipping the gun into the holster of his belt.
Harry understood the logic behind this, not least of which was the possible ensuing turf war if the Aurors insisted on their sole control of Underground egress, but the arrangement still struck him as grossly unfair.
A rushing sound filled my ears, like the roar of the London traffic. I saw stars and the moon in the night sky, glowing bright like pale jewels. They moved, a speedy flock of lights, and the sun rose, a fiery ball that outshone all the rest that I had to avert my eyes.
“No,” he said, “I don’t think I do too badly.” His hands roamed as he pulled me against his chest. I breathed in his smell, that very distinctive Harry scent, as he trailed a line of kisses up my neck.
“What? What makes you think I’m any more suited to dealing with poorly behaved patients than either of you?”
Draco looked at Harry. Despite that single outburst, Harry had stayed quiet throughout the entire exchange. That wasn’t like him.
Draco remembered his actions with a flush of shame. Schoolboy antics, to be sure: immature and stupid, they still stung, and Draco understood now that even the smallest slight hurt disproportionately in childhood. Not to mention Harry’s other best friend, Hermione Granger, now completing her pupilage, was the subject of Draco’s worst misogynist insults. Perhaps Draco couldn’t stand a girl beating him for top marks, perhaps it was his father’s taunts that he couldn’t outsmart a girl, but it was still no excuse. But Draco was too proud to apologize now, and in any case, he had no idea how to broach the topic without opening another fresh wound.
“It’s going well. Lots of paperwork, dealing with idiots, the typical day of a civil servant.” She fished the olive out of her glass. “Did you give any more thought to my offer? About consulting for the Ministry?”
“One does not need be a true believer to be a tool,” the voice said. The man in the armchair remained out of sight. “The Malfoy boy has Slytherin qualities aplenty – ambition, cunning, a desire to redeem himself. Those, too, can be manipulated. After all, is that not how we used the last candidate?”
“The Malfoys are older than the Blacks,” I said, raising my chin slightly, “and our family is larger. If we used a tapestry, it would take up at least two walls. And besides, tapestries breed moths and doxies.”
Draco was aware he wore an obnoxious grin. How every stereotypical of him. And here he had imagined himself to be already set on the path for celibacy. Perhaps not.
“I’m not pretending anything,” I said sharply. Wetness dotted my vision. I looked away from Potter hurriedly. “I’m not pretending anything.”
“Anticipating your opponent’s movement in battle can be a huge advantage,” Luna said. “Even being able to do so for a second.” She shrugged. “I wouldn’t know. I’m a pacifist myself.”
Then I recovered my sense of adventure as I thought of the Grimoire in there, waiting to be found. Slytherin himself had likely touched those stones. It was thrilling, to stand in the same place where he stood a thousand years ago.
“What happened? Harry!” Granger’s voice demanded. She pushed through a ring of onlookers that I just now noticed. “Why aren’t any of you lot helping?”
“New intel from our satellites, sir. There appears to be several Hummers in the vicinity of the area.”
Abruptly, I was aware my footfalls were not the only noise in the hallway. There was another, softer click, that accompanied mine.
“Yes, I know,” I interrupted. Really, lecturing a magical historian on the value of old spell books? “It’s THE Grimoire. Slytherin’s Grimoire.”
“Thanks,” Harry said dryly, provoked into unwilling laughter. “I did pass Auror training, you know.”
“Look, I’m sorry.” Draco was mature enough to know it was his turn to be conciliatory. “I know you’re worried, but I can take care of myself. I promise. I’m not some helpless waif to be shepherded about.”
Harry’s eyes widened. “I didn’t know that was possible. There are safeguards in place to prevent Sentient Intelligences from doing that. Imagine if we lost control of our bodies.”
“What if I was planning to order water? I’m –” it was on the tip of Harry’s tongue to say that he was on the job. “I’m not fond of drinking.”
“Ah. Sorry. I – you startled me, is all.” I tucked my wand away hastily and looked at her. She had grown into her looks now. No longer the bushy-haired know-it-all, Granger was severely elegant in her Ministry robes, her formerly bushy hair parked sleekly on the right. No wonder Weasel’s mad for her. “I didn’t hear you.”
“Don’t let any of them hear that,” Harry warned. “Or you’ll find your life here will get very difficult indeed.”
“You really should be neater about where you put your clothes, Potter,” Malfoy said as Harry climbed back onto the bed. “And why are you coming onto the bed?”
They finally stopped. Draco saw a loose sign with the word Knockturn in faded letters. Fletcher gestured to a door in the alley leading down from the road.
“Yes,” I said. “Also, it probably appealed to Slytherin’s sense of irony, putting his Grimoire so close to his enemy’s home.”
“I’m well, Harry,” my mother’s voice cut off my father’s tirade. “When are you coming over for tea?”
“Oh, this must be your first time.” Goyle gave Harry a pitying look. “You think this is the Underground? This is only the cover for it. It’s far beneath us.”
“He is, and it was damned stupid of him coming out like this,” Harry said, his lips pursed. Draco wanted to laugh; disapproving Harry looked so angry it was comical.
“I’m so happy to be in London,” she said. “Though I haven’t quite adjusted to the cold yet. It is a bit chilly, isn’t it?”
Fudge had always affected an avuncular warmth for Harry in the few times Harry had accepted the invitations to the formal functions the Ministry threw to ‘honor its heroes.’
The librarian spat. “Like I ever tell you, Potter. You might’ve killed Voldemort, but the Circle is far older and stronger as a collective than him and his Death Eaters. Death Eaters — such a pretentious name. Appropriate for a pretender.”
“The people down here have their own ways of keeping themselves hidden,” Goyle said. “But anyways, you can’t go around asking random people and expect to get any results.”
“I dunno,” Draco said, sinking back into his seat. The hard wood poked against his back. “It’s like everything is going too well after all the trouble I’ve had to get to where I am, you know? And I can’t deny everything in my life is going well. My father doesn’t approve of my choice of careers. Or my boyfriend.”
“Potter …” Harry was startled to find Malfoy, in a blink, suddenly leaning over himself. Their faces were close, as to almost touching. Malfoy’s lashes were thick and long, and flicked as Malfoy blinked.
“I’ll be sure to,” Draco said, laying out his suits. He could only hope he would have an opportunity to wear them again. “Where are you going?”
He was about to leave his hiding place in search for Harry, consequences be damned, when Harry popped back next to him. It was lucky that Draco was too busy blowing hot air into his hands at the moment, or else he might have scream. As such, he let out a squeal that would have been worthy of a mouse.
“Draco!” Luna Lovegood’s ethereal voice greeted me. Even in the middle of the day, she still managed to sound as though she came from a dream. “Long time no see.”
Harry primed the propulsion – he flew straight into the honking mass of humanity, swerving to avoid a lorry carrying aether tanks and industrial maintenance drones. Angry blares blasted Harry from all sides – he maneuver the Firebolt sixty degrees to his left, out of an incoming red Moris Major cloud car.
Draco shouldn’t have been irritated that somehow, he had been the one to pay for dinner. There were much bigger issues than professional courtesy at stake here.
“I’ll bring it back to the office to analyze, then,” Harry said. “You’re certain that there’s nothing wrong with it otherwise? No hidden computer viruses or anything?”
“Try radioing him again,” Draco said, feeling none of the confidence his tone held. “Maybe the radio will be on now.”
“Not tonight,” Granger said. She gave both Harry and Shacklebolt a disapproving look. “I don’t know what this is about, and I admit I don’t really want to, but I think the best course of action for Draco is to get some sleep right now.”
“Ah.” I could not think of any appropriate response. I was still trying to digest the idea that Potter visited a sex club. The image of Potter in a leather harness with a whip in his hand … my mouth went dry.
“Master, are you sure about the Malfoy boy being connected to the Grimoire?” he asked, in a respectful tone. “With all due respect, he does not seem like someone who would aid us in our goals. Particularly since he betrayed his last master.”
Malfoy muttered something inaudible under his breath, before turning to face Harry. “Well, what is it you want?” he asked, settling himself into a throne-like chair. He regarded Harry with cold, sharp eyes. “This obviously isn’t a social call, Commander Potter. Otherwise Filch wouldn’t have allowed you up.”
They hadn’t even seen anything yet. Just algae on rocks and sea flowers, swaying gently in the current. There was a patch of seagrass that showed up ahead, a furry field dancing in a hypnotic motion.
“I sincerely doubt that,” Draco muttered. “I think you’re laboring under a delusion that we were close enough for him to confide in me. If you’ve done your homework, you would know that we spent more of our time arguing than intriguing together.” Forcing himself to state the truth so baldly stung. Draco didn’t relish the dynamic he and his father shared. He had longed for the day when his father would turn a smile at him, when the love wasn’t conditioned on Draco meeting his father’s expectations.
“I take it you’re aware of them,” Potter said, recovering from his shock. My mind still could not process how quickly my father agreed.
“Is there any way you can direct the light further away?” Draco asked. His voice sounded calm. Collected. It was a reasonable request.
He hovered over me, looming like an overgrown bat. Even though it had been my plan to lure him out and question him, I still had a thrill of danger run through me. Yet I was not afraid. It was strangely anticipatory, and I found myself eager for this confrontation.
We were out in the open moors again, en route to Godric’s Hollow. From there, we would Apparate back to London, where hopefully we would have the time and facilities to examine the Grimoire.
“You didn’t have to come along, you know,” Harry said. He was unperturbed by the environment and would not have been out of place as a wax statute at Madame Tussauds’. Only the humorous curve of his mouth betrayed him. “You insisted on coming, remember?”
Draco considered his answer. It was easier to focus on an academic debate than it was to think about Harry.
“It’s always exciting for us professors to have our former students return,” McGonagall said. Except for her hair turning from grey to silver and lines etched deeper on her face, she was unchanged, looking as she did more than a decade ago, when she greeted us on the doorsteps of the Great Hall. “And visiting with Mr. Potter, no less. I understand you want to borrow the Pensieve?”
“This is starting to feel like an Auror interview, Potter. Draco, are you reenacting those silly books you read as a child again with Potter?”
Nothing in Malfoy’s files had suggested that he owned an illegal business. Harry pulled his memory, trying to recall if there were any investigation or indication that linked Malfoy to the Underground.
Granger’s unwelcome voice was a splash of cold water. I nearly toppled off Potter as he rose from the couch.
“So what do we do now, sir?” Finnegan asked, staring at the body. “Write that the man died of natural causes in our report? This man isn’t important enough to warrant media attention from the looks of it. I’ve never seen him before.”
Draco didn’t need to question why they were here. They had either tracked him or uncovered the trail on their own and found this place. He was hyper-cognizant of the Decoder, lying on the towel, exposed under the Aegean sun.
I obeyed, moving onto the bed as Harry put his arm around me. He was blazing hot, his natural body warmth amplified by the blankets surrounding him. I felt it through the fabric of his pajamas.
“I need a drink,” I muttered. I rubbed my temples; every time I used Legilimency always resulted in a headache.
“The Resistance, the Order of the Phoenix.” There was rumor of a movement that had been organizing to oppose the Ministry. Harry had heard whispers swirling around this organization calling itself the Order of the Phoenix. The phoenix … the mythical bird that renews itself from ashes.
“We only need a rough idea if the artifact is real,” Dawlish said. He appeared to be unenthused about Draco’s potential involvement as Draco himself. “I’ve made my objection to involving a civilian on record and I think it’s better if we have one of our trusted operatives intercept the handoff. We can handle the delays.”
It was simple and straightforward, not a whiff of intrigue about it. It also portended the most danger for Harry.
Draco distracted himself exploring the house. Though in a rather insalubrious area, it was large and spacious, with three storeys filled with rooms stuffed with collections from previous inhabitants.
The Leaky Cauldron never seemed to change. Its grime, at least, was a constant. I sat down, taking care not to put my hands on the table. More often than not, the surface was sticky with some unidentifiable substance, probably a mix of spilled beer and dirt that accumulated since the pub opened.
It was an innocuous piece of paper, filled with the sloping, arrogant writing of his father. Draco had requested that Shacklebolt give him instead of copies. Draco wouldn’t put it past Lucius to somehow include invisible ink in his own journals.
The car appears to have the built-in control chip disabled, Hedwig said. She paused. Increasing likelihood of suspect car being the target to ninety-nine percent, she said.
I remembered her giant beast of a cat, and smothered a laugh at the image of him sitting in Potter’s lap, purring as Potter petted him.
“Ah.” Draco supposed this was a peace offering of some sort, in the form of a faded Nirvana t-shirt and baggy jeans. “Thank you. That’s kind of you.”
Potter shrugged. “I don’t think you’re a liar,” he said, “and I don’t think you’re crazy – though that’s always a debatable point. Besides, I found objects from the Founders in my own time, and Hermione still keeps me up to date on Ministry affairs from time to time. What you told me makes sense.”
“Most have already acclimated to darkness,” Goyle said. “And we’re not all barbarians down here, you know. We use lights like everyone else.”
“That’s not the point, Draco! What would people think? No Malfoy has been caught in a compromising situation like this since the 1950s.”
Target straight ahead, Hedwig reported. His spectacles helpfully highlighted it. It still tore at a breakneck rate. Harry endeavored to match it.
The marble was cold against his hands. Draco took in the plaque in front of him: Lucius Malfoy, beloved father and husband.
I stumbled back, crashing into the table. The tea set fell to the floor, the pots and cups shattering with a wave of hot liquid, scalding my skin.
Even onscreen, it made for dull reading. Draco was familiar enough with his father’s opinions on the entire range of possible topics, and reviewing them was no more pleasant when viewed on his laptop.
Draco sat on the bed in silence after Weasley left. The shirt was itchy against his skin. With the lights off, everything was magnified. Whatever painkiller they had shot him with worked, but it left Draco restless.
“Let’s keep looking,” Draco said. He didn’t want to think of the possible actions he might have to take to keep these out of Dolohov’s hands. “The Shield might be in here somewhere.”
“Draco?” Harry waved his hand. He had, Draco saw, reknotted his tie, but it was poorly done, and the collar remained opened.
He ducked under the low hanging doorway into a rather dim room with a strong odor of mothballs. There was a touch-tome lying on an armchair patched with over with suede, and a console two models older than the current one in use at the corner.
It was bigger than I expected too, despite the clutter of books and miscellaneous objects in the cabinets and on his desk. There was a large Sneakoscope taking up half the space and a Foe Glass behind his chair.
Potter waited besides me, his face taut. Despite our assurances that I would be safe, he had insisted on being with me every step of the mission.
Harry shook his head. “All the chatter we picked up suggest that something big is going to happen, but nothing is clear enough for us to take action on.”
“I’m not going to let you have the Decoder,” Draco told them, his voice calm despite the rise of terror in his gut.
I watched the fading sun shine its rays on Harry’s face, the light catching in such a way that a halo illuminated his outline. It was going to be evening soon; already, I could see the moon peek out, the air growing chillier as the day finished.
“Dolohov said I was to leave the Malfoy untouched, but he said nothing about you, Potter,” Greyback said, advancing on Harry menacingly.
Draco aimed the camera, searching for a flat, round shape. Despite the sketchy details provided, Draco guesses that the Decoder would be close to the size of a mantel clock, circular (to mirror the movements of the universe it purportedly calculated), with exposed gears not unlike the back of a watch. It might be too difficult to read the inscription given the lack of lighting and the condition of the mechanism itself, but it would be labeled with planetary pointers in Koine Greek, the lingua franca of the intellectual world in antiquity.
“No,” Draco said. He drained half his glass of wine. “If I know anything about my father, it’s that he considered Malfoy Manor the place to store all the materials he deemed important. He wouldn’t have trust anywhere else.”
“I haven’t thought about Hogwarts in a while, Mr. Malfoy,” he said. “My brother Colin died in the last battle there ten years ago.”
I smirked at him. “Yoga and pilates, Potter. Glad it’s paying off.” I gave him a quick peck on the cheek. His arms shot out and held me in place, taking control of the pace, his erection engorged and solid at my back, his breath hot on my neck.
“Fuck, that feels good,” Potter breathed out as I rocked back and forth. My hands were a startling white on his chest. “You have a great arse.”
It was the newest model of the hoverbikes that law enforcement and gangsters emphasizing speed favored. Nicknamed brooms because of the resemblance, it only had a single engine capable of vertical and short take-off and landing, an uncomfortable seat, and nothing else. They were tricky to fly and difficult to control – Harry had taken to it like a bird to flight. It was one of the few vehicles that SIs were unable to pilot, requiring human instinct and creativity that computers so far have been unable to emulate.
Alright, so that didn’t work. Harry, if anything, was even more morose. “Maybe it’ll keep me busy,” Draco said. “In between all the cleaning.”
Then they walked. For at least ten minutes; with Fletcher guiding the way with furtive glances all around and Draco growing increasingly irritated as empty cabs passed them and his breath created icy puffs in the air.
“What about?” There was an edge in his tone beyond his usual sharpness; I sensed tension in my father that I had never felt before.
Thankfully, we separated at the library. I summoned an elf who looked at Potter with reverence that I thought would not look out of place for a pilgrim seeing a saint’s relic to guide him to my father’s study.
“I have many books,” I said, affecting as much calm as I could muster from being sprawled on the dirt. I had my wand in my grasp now. I gripped it, willing the pain to disappear. I waited for the response, to draw it out for more clues.
“Tell us about your research, Draco,” he said. “You’re looking at artifacts now. What does that entail? Any old objects? You can start with the Manor, you know. We have objects that dates back to when our ancestor came over with the Conqueror.”
I thought of the bottle of dark-silver memory that used to be the book-key in my bag. It reminded me of liquid memory. I shook my head. “We don’t have a Pensieve to use.” And I was not sure if I wanted to touch it again. Like liquid mercury, Slytherin’s memory seemed dangerous to approach without safeguards.
“Then it’s settled. Harry will keep you safe while I try to figure out what our friend and his group wants.”
“But no one loves you unconditionally. Even the most loving of families: they love you because you are one of them, that you share – something, blood ties, relations – with them. They don’t do that with a stranger. Family bonds are conditional; it’s just that we choose not to see it or think about it most of the time.”
It was somehow comforting to know that, even after death, he was still here, watching over us, even with that slight moue of distaste which he regarded Harry.
Warming his hands with his mouth, he tried to concentrate. Fletcher had indeed done as Draco requested, and contacted Riddle and his group. There had been a scrap of paper with the address scrawled on it in surprisingly neat handwriting when Draco checked the post office box this morning.
“We’ll monitor the situation,” Shacklebolt said finally. “If your conjection is true, then it goes beyond what this agency can handle on its own.” He suddenly chuckled. “I suppose I should congratulate you on a job well done before I forget. After all, it isn’t every day that you pull a fourth of the city’s drug supply off the streets.”
“No, but you’re not the typical patron,” Harry said. “Don’t try lying – I can tell by the way Blaise listened to you and” – Harry gestured around the box – “all this, that you’re much more than even a regular.”
I don’t either, Hedwig said. I don’t have any concrete data, but I think the drugs and the blueprints are somehow linked.
Draco wondered how it would look to Harry’s secretary sitting just outside the office. The mussed hair, the raw lips, the disheveled clothes.
I didn’t wait for him to cast another spell, aiming a Body-binding hex directly to his chest. The jet of light bounced uselessly off his Shield and hit the ceiling in a shower of sparks.
I glowered at her. That incident had brought her no small amount of amusement. The Weasley was surprisingly supportive of it. He had merely given me a beady look and grunted, “Hurt him and I’ll hex your balls off.”
“A fraction of our drug running and cyber distribution activities  have caught the attention of the FBI and the NSA,” Wormtail said. “The information the Chinese provided lists the operatives that have somehow embedded themselves. We have taken the steps to plug the leaks.”
Riddle laughed. Wormtail tried not to flinch but he didn’t entirely succeed. Riddle did not seem to notice, though.
I swallowed. Reading between the lines, what made them more terrifying than the Death Eaters was their coordination and unity. The Death Eaters were dangerous, but they -- we -- had been a fractious group, held together only by the Dark Lord. This Circle, though … it reeked of something far older and expansive. According to this article, they were also deeply emmeshed in Wizarding society, to the extent that removal would need to be slow and surgical. Any mass action would result likely in destabilization and mass chaos. Yet like the hydra, I had no doubt that as soon as one cell was destroyed, another would take its place.
“But he might not be willing to aid us,” the librarian protested. “He’s turned his back on the True Cause. I don’t think he’s willing to help us achieve our goals and the goals of his great ancestor and our Founder.”
Draco was still disoriented from the seven-hour flight. The blast of climate control added to Draco’s headache after being outside on the arid landing field.
Harry dropped to ground, rolling out of range. He sprang up again, sprinting with augmented speed towards the front of the Opera House. A breeze grazed his ear; Harry realized that the shot had been much closer than he thought. It came so close that it had burnt off some of his hair.
“It’s up to you, sir,” Finnegan said. “I’m behind whatever your decision is, but I just want to remind you that the sooner you close this case, the sooner we can worry about one less thing.”
“You were hit by a Cruciatus,” Malfoy said. “It’s a good thing that I came looking for you.” He hesitated. “What the hell were you thinking, provoking those people in the bar like that?”
It was also the middle of a weekday. Unlike me, most had more regimented schedules. It was one of the perks of my chosen career, I suppose. I let my mind drift as I made my way back home. The elms swayed softly in the wind, a gentle whispering as the branches danced gently. The leaves were crisp, falling slowly in an amber shower.
Harry gave a choked laugh. “Well, I’m glad you didn’t lose your sense of humor while you were capture.” He focused on Cross. “You’re going to pay.”
“Damn dust making it hard to see in here,” Draco said. He held up the sheafs of paper. “This is Rosier’s findings. According to my father, I probably will be better at making sense of what’s written here.”
“Stay behind Potter, Draco.” My father rose from his seat. His wand was out, pointed at Cross. “And you, Cross, I think it’s time to go.”
“I think your food’s ready,” Potter said. There was a small hitch in his voice, and though his features were even, I could have sworn a faint blush crept underneath his tanned skin. “I think I’ll have some actually. Smells delicious.”
“At least it’ll be easier to take with us,” Bellatrix said. Her voice was musing, like stating a fact.
I needed certain documents from the Gringotts Reading Room to complete the last chapter. I was also fairly certain that the librarian was linked to all of this. I was going to attempt to question him one more time. Going would solve both problems neatly.
Taking in a deep breath, he ran with all his might to grab the Decoder, gritting his teeth and bracing himself to be hit. He saw Dolohov raise the gun –
Harry walked into a long corridor with holo-frames decorating the walls. Some of them showed the view outside the building while others were of swirling abstract art in pastel colors that made Harry slightly queasy. These could be changed to broadcast emergency messages or be used as consoles if the need rose.
Then it shifted and I was in a cave. A book rested on a roughhewn stone round in shape. The book was the one I had seen earlier in the vision. This time, memory and a greater instinct for self-preservation stayed my hand from touching it.
“Strangely calm,” he said. “I don’t think I’ll ever stop wondering what life would be like if they lived, but I don’t do too badly now, do I?” He took hold of me as I closed the door to our room and locked it with a firm snick. If the proprietors of this fine establishment did not care for their security, that was their business. I would be certain of ours.
“I saw a play by this Muggle -born playwright recently,” I jumped in, hoping to fend off my father’s wrath. I didn’t want a wand fight at the dinner table. “It was a rather ridiculous one.”
“We believe a significant source of the group’s income is from distributing opium and arms for the Taliban and various other terrorist groups in the Middle East,” Dawlish said. “And that their activities directly clash with our interests overseas. Your father’s work, I believe, related to a project they had that involved smuggling looted artifacts from the region to finance some of these unsavory groups.”
“So, Harry, tell us about some of your plans,” the youngest Weasley, Ginny, asked. She and Ron rivaled each other in displaying the most dislike for Draco. Draco knew she had a crush on Harry, had even dated him briefly before Harry enlisted. It wasn’t Draco’s fault that she had been jilted. Blame the military. Hell, blame Tony Blair. “What do you plan to do now that you’re back? You should stay longer. We all miss you.”
“I don’t need to!” I was excited. This was more exhilarating than flying. “There’s only a few types of magic that gives you visions. What I experienced before – it’s a memory of someone’s. That’s why when I experienced it, it was more than images. It’s like when I use Legilimency into someone’s past. I retain all five of my senses when I touch the book.”
“I can’t just let him die in front of me.” My voice was a dry rasp. I coughed. “Do you have some water?”
Last night was a dream a long time coming. Desire had always tinged my loathing of Potter. And this new Potter I was coming to know was considerate and collected, with a wicked sense of humor. And he was so damn attractive with his messy dark hair and his sharp eyes, not to mention how built he was.
They had a reason to: Harry was far different from the scrawny twig of a boy Draco had known at Hogwarts Independent School. Harry had filled out and he moved with a lean grace gained from his training as a Royal Marine. In marked contrast, Draco was pale and slender, his blond hair adding to his already considerable pallor. Not to mention Draco never felt at ease in rural settings, despite growing up in a country manor.
That was what Bellatrix understood best: the ability of strength and terror to propel men to their best. She had entered his service with a rather memorable beginning, shooting a man point blank when he mistook her to be a secretary and asked her to bring him coffee.
I was panting already. I wondered if I had an opportunity to call for reinforcements — the last time I was confronted with him, I only managed to escape by grace of having Muggles nearby. With the din loud enough to wake the dead, maybe my neighbors would summon help.
Potter tugged at it. “Ginny used to do it for me.” He fumbled with the silk. I winced. At this rate, he was going to accidentally rip it.
Harry’s thoughts swam like molasses. There was something mocking in Malfoy’s tone, but harry couldn’t for the life of him come up with a passable repartee. He thanked Malfoy again.
“I know.” Granger looked at my sympathetically. “But you’re the only one who has a clue as to where the Grimoire is right now. And it seems that you’re somehow meant to find it. I’m not going to question that everything happens for a reason.”
Bet she caught an eyeful, I thought, shooting a quick glance at Potter. I could still see the swell in joggers where he was still semi-erect, and it was my turn to hide a smile.
There was a pull at my navel, not unlike the sensation of falling, and I was in that cave again. The walls shone with slick wetness, and there was a man in gray robes that reminded me of a monk’s habit laying an object on the pillar at the center.
“Already did that,” Malfoy interrupted. “And you don’t. I checked all the other Ministry databases too. None whatsoever.”
Under the jet of water pounding his back, Harry thought back to Malfoy and what Hedwig had said. “…interest in Draco Malfoy bordered on levels considered inappropriate….”
“Well,” Draco said. “Malfoy Manor has over an acre of grounds, including a forest, the main house, the gamekeeper’s cottage, the stable, and – the mausoleum!”
“I know what a Pensieve is,” I said tartly. Honestly, Potter acted like he forgot I was the magical historian here. “They’re rare. Even the Manor doesn’t one. There’s one in the British Museum, but it’s terribly difficult to request access, and we don’t know who’s watching.”
“I didn’t ask and I don’t want to know,” she said darkly. She stood up with a sweep of her robes. “Make sure to lock up once you’re done.”
“You, me. We’re obviously attracted to each other, but you’re acting like it’s nothing. That it doesn’t exist. We can’t go on like this, not if we’re going to be living together.”
“No.” Potter’s voice was quiet. “It makes sense. I didn’t have any friends until I went to Hogwarts. That’s why I was so defensive of them when I first met you.”
Malfoy shook his head. “Unfortunately not. But Metis detected the signature of the weapon, and it had to be in the vicinity to be effective.” He drummed his fingers. “We can use that to trace the origin of the weapon, and hopefully find your assailant that way.”
I met the man’s eyes, trying to probe into the librarian’s mind, trying to see his most recent memories of this ‘Circle’ he mentioned.
“No. But from what we understand about the Mors Mordre, England does appear to be their base of operations. It makes sense for both of you to return to assist our efforts.”
Searing heat flashed across my cheeks, replaced quickly by the wet warmth of blood. Cross looked at me, his expression pitilessly unperturbed. I felt my body freeze, my muscles refusing to move despite my efforts.
I turned my head so swiftly there was an audible snick. We looked at each other. His eyes were shadowed; one of my lightning had hit one of the bulbs. His lips were slightly parted, his breathing heavy and uneven. Mine wasn’t calmer; my entire body was hot. I moved my hand – it touched his, just on the edge, as I leaned in --
Glancing around, Harry wondered what to do next. The elevator seemed to have opened directly into Malfoy’s residence; Harry took a tentative seat in an antique ottoman with filigreed legs that Harry was surprised it managed to take his weight.
“Oh! That reminds me. They need to be filled in triplicate now!” Harry called after him. Finnegan gave him the finger from a distance.
So far, Draco counted his blessings that they did not run into anyone. Dolohov had been left lying on the ground, but he hadn’t been unconscious, and was likely organizing the search for them at this very moment. They needed to get out in the open, where at least light and the terrain would allow them more freedom to move. That outweighed any tactical advantage in these tiny, narrow spaces where he and Harry were unfamiliar with.
“It’s ….” Draco hesitated. He wasn’t sure how much he should divulge. Or if he were even allowed to, given much of the business he was involved in related to the Secret Service. But there was only so much information he could find on the internet, and Shacklebolt’s men were more adept at eavesdropping than historical research. “What can you tell me about the Shield of Achilles? Beyond the basics. I already know the basics.”
“So you see, I don’t intend on dying here,” Harry said. “Nor do I intend on letting them take you with them.”
‘You are the backup,’ one of them told me. ‘You being a distant relation to Slytherin. But we prefer the heir rather than the spare.’
“Yes ….” Dolohov bared his teeth in a smile. “Harry knows all about this. Probably more familiar with it than I do, to be honest.” He turned his attention to Harry. “You’re ever present in our master’s thoughts. I suppose you should feel honored by that. Not many of us can claim the same.”
“I’ll do it manually then,” Harry said. He sat at the chair and powered on the screen. A beep indicated it was on.
“Ah.” I never knew what to say in these situations. If it had been one of my friends, possibly I would have cracked a tasteless joke. But this was Potter, and I couldn’t do that. “My condolences.”
This … what was Harry doing? About to sleep with a lead on a case, not to mention a potential witness, someone who had just confided in Harry a traumatic moment. Harry stopped, met Malfoy’s eyes.
“No,” I said. “Don’t be ridiculous. I didn’t even take Divination at Hogwarts. I seemed to recall you did, though.”
He looked at me and smiled. ‘You’re right, my lord,’ he replied to that man. ‘Draco came in just at the right time.’ My father took me in the arms and led me to this chamber where it was all black glass and metal.” Malfoy played with the palmtop. “It was a lab for biomechanical components, I know now. I was strapped to this table and then I felt a prick of the syringe.”
“It’s me, Malfoy,” I said. “Just came to check up on you. I brought some tea.” I hesitated and pushed opened the door.
Harry shrugged, the ropes finally dropping. He pinched the guard’s temples. The man’s eyes instantly fluttered shut.
Damn. Now I was definitely going to be late. I looked at Blaise evenly. “Potter is joining me for dinner with my parents.” I made no effort to elaborate further. I hadn’t mentioned the Grimoire or the attacks to any of my friends. I knew the less they knew, the safer they would be.
Potter rubbed his eyes. “Like I’m back sitting for my OWLs and on desk duty at the Aurors at the same time. I was always better in the field. I don’t know how you do it.”
“It’s done now,” Harry said. His face was shuttered. Draco knew he was still thinking of his own failures too. “There’s nothing we can do about it now.”
I groped for my thermos of coffee, hoping a shot of liquid energy would wake me from this daydream. As I reached, my hand brushed the outermost edge of the book.
Harry thought it had been a ploy by Finnegan to save him from McLaggen. Harry had spotted McLaggen’s burly frame coming down the hallway to his door when Finnegan burst in and told Harry he had to leave. With a hastily given shrug, Harry had allowed himself to be rushed to the car park.
It wasn’t that I distrusted them; we had been through too much to be suspicious of each other. Rather, I wasn’t sure what I would say. I found a magical book that gives me visions? It would only set them off fretting and clucking with concern. Besides, I was perfectly capable. I have an advanced degree and seven N.E.W.T.s; I could handle a book.
“You know, I’ve never traveled on a private plane before,” Harry said, his legs swinging easily. He was wearing a monogrammed bathrobe with initials BZ, with a glass of water in the other.
After exhausting all the safe areas of topic – the ever-English subject of the weather, Ministry gossip, the research I had been working on (thankfully, the manuscript had been untouched during the scuffle with the librarian) – I finally mustered the courage to ask the question that had been troubling me since I called upon Potter.
There was a clink from the kitchen. I peered. It was coming from the area hidden from view by the angle of the room. I hope it wasn’t china that I hadn’t stow away properly this morning.
“I went to place a tracker on their car,” he whispered. “We’ll be able to follow them once they leave.”
“It’s real?” Despite the dire straits they were in, Draco’s pulse quickened for a different reason. The idea at finding the fabled Shield of Achilles…. “Are you sure?”
“Are you alright?” Draco asked. It seemed like the easiest way to begin. “You’re not hurt anywhere, are you?”
“Well, warn a man next time,” Potter said, disgruntled. He settled back down. “And what is this ‘breakthrough’ of yours that almost gave me a heart attack?”
“We’ll go in through the back,” Harry said, after speaking to someone on the phone. “Shacklebolt have someone hack into the security so that our entry won’t be noticed.” He looked at Draco. “Are you sure you want to be here? It’s against all regulations, and not only that, this is very dangerous.”
“It went well,” Harry said. “Nothing particularly exciting. They had me going over reports from the listening posts all over the world.”
“I’m sure that is not the case,” Dolohov said. He sat on a stool, eyeing Draco like a puzzle to be solved. There was that madman’s glint on his eyes again, and Draco remembered what Shacklebolt had told him, that this man was a former KGB assassin. “I think you know a lot more than you think. You just need a little more ... persuasion.” He raised a hand and stroked Draco’s cheek. Draco jerked away.
The wall smoldered at the impact of the Killing Curse. I ignored the pain in my chest, running to Harry’s side. It smelled of charred paper.
“Molly wants to kill me anyways,” Draco grumbled. There was no love lost between the Weasleys and Draco’s own family. They had been rivals for three generations now, though it was like a match between a lion and a sheep – no contest at all.
My bag was still with me. Somehow, I had managed to bring it back in one piece. The top of it I had sealed with magic; I was more than ever grateful to this unexpected foresight meant to guard against my clumsiness.
Harry sighed. “You’re too intelligent. Yes. Lucius Malfoy was offered a plea deal by us. In exchange for his aid, he would have received protection and immunity from further prosecution. We suspect the car crash was orchestrated by Mors Mordre.”
After occupying so prominent a space in all the events that had transpired, Riddle didn’t disappoint in person. He exuded a sense of menace that pressed like a blade’s edge on skin, cold steel against soft flesh.
“I do,” Draco said. “But I do also know that the competition for these goods are limited. You can only sell them to so many who are, shall we say, less than curious about their provenance.”
“You guys alright?” Granger asked as her men clicked silver cuffs that shone with anti-magical properties onto the librarian’s wrists. They would inhibit his powers, and, as an added precaution, they had also muzzled him.
He tried to focus. He dimly remember the map that had been on display at the briefing this morning. It wasn’t difficult for the details to return to him; Draco had been staring at it the entire time, only half listening to Harry and Shacklebolt and Dawlish talking.
“No.” Draco rose. There was no point in playing the martyr if Harry weren’t here. Lead filled his chest. Where was Harry? He just ... left? Draco recalled how silent Harry was when Mr. Weasley dropped his bombshell. Was Harry angry with Draco? Was he embarrassed, too disappointed by events justifying what others must had warned him ad nauseum about becoming involved with a Malfoy? A painful thought struck Draco – did Harry think Draco was also implicated? Was that why Harry decided to go?
It was strange to realize that only a week had passed since Draco had stumbled upon Dolohov breaking in. Since then, life transformed into unrecognizable form. Or perhaps it reverted ... the reappearance of Harry, being shaken out of his staid routine of office-sleep-Manor. His pulse jumped. It was exciting, and strangely addictive, like a sugar rush or the flood of endorphins after finishing an intense run.
“And you were an insufferable showboat,” I said. “‘Oh, look at me. I can catch the snitch with my mouth.’”
It was a trope of fiction that clandestine criminal meetings always occurred in dark alleyways or shaded corners. Draco always thought that was rather silly and overdramatic.
“Hello Lucius,” Harry gave my father a curt nod. “Narcissa.” His greeting to my mother was far warmer. “How are you?”
Harry had insisted on bringing one, and it was thanks to the lax oversight for the private jet crowd that he had managed to slip it through customs. It was one of the modified ones from the Service, a Walther that was sealed and armored so it could be fired underwater.
“We go after Riddle,” Draco said. Nothing about the man had seemed out of the ordinary, except perhaps more distinguished than most. Draco had felt that intangible force of his personality even from that distance, one that inspired fear and awe of power. “We take the fight to them. So far, we’ve been on the defensive. Our luck will change if we shift tactics.”
In response, a jet of green light arced over our heads, hitting the shelf across from us. It burst into green flames.
The sky was choked with hovercars and flyers and neon lights from the city’s own buildings. Gold and silver threaded the view, overlaid by red and green from the sensors. Red for unlikely routes, green for the paths predicted that the drug runners will take.
“Don’t be ridiculous,” Draco said, but he smiled. “I was going to just point out I can handle a short walk. We are almost there, aren’t we?”
Shacklebolt’s analysts had done a good job. They had digitized and organized Lucius’ papers in any way Draco could think of: alphabetically (beginning with the opening line on each), chronologically, and thematically (though Draco rather imagined they all shared the overall premise of Lucius’s disgruntlement at the world).
“Sorry,” I said. “Getting you injured.” The memory of that moment came again, the unexpectedness way the flash had erupted, while I was frozen in shock and confusion as he shoved me out of the way. “Sorry, Potter.”
He couldn’t force Fletcher into divulging his sources. Draco was familiar with these types of men; he had encountered too many of them in his field. Sellers and buyers that always negotiated with one eye behind their backs for a bigger fish to bite their bait, and would slip off the hook faster than one blinked.
“Pretty much the whole day. I made a discovery, but it means more work for us.” Draco eyed the brown bag in Harry’s hand. “Is that food?”
“I’ll leave you to unpack then,” Harry said. He hesitated at the door. “Let me know if you need anything.”
Not to mention providing the weapon that hurt Harry. Harry didn’t want to believe that his friends – however long they hadn’t seen each other – would hurt him willingly. But perhaps, those of their new associates wouldn’t have that much scruple.
I checked the clock on table. It was already an hour after when I usually rose. I waved my wand, and the curtains opened, letting out a harsh stream of light.
“I’m actually doing more research with old artefacts now,” I said. I took another bite. My father could not have waited until at least the main course to start. I should have started drinking before I came. “That’s part of the reason why I’m here. There are some records in the Manor Library that I wanted to go over. I think they have clues to my next project.”
“Thank you,” I said. It was a cold reminder that Potter was here, not for a social call, but because my life was at risk. “Someone tried to break into my mind today. There’s definitely a group after the Grimoire. All these attempts targeted at me, they probably came from this group.”
Goyle snorted. “Well, I can’t say much, but it sure doesn’t look comfortable to me. But I know how you like a hard thing under your arse.”
Draco breathed in deep, not bothering to conceal it anymore. Greyback’s eyes betrayed the suggestive enjoyment from Draco’s disgust and horror.
Portraits of Headmasters past lined the way, apart from the two prominent canvases of Dumbledore and Snape hanging behind Professor McGonagall. It reminded me of my father’s study, but on a grander scale, the wood-paneled walls of the circular room punctuated with multiple windows. It was a cloudy grey outside. There were curios and books on the shelves, and a circular table held many other objects that I had never seen before.
“He’s well.” Draco took a sip of his lychee and elderflower drink. It flowed down smooth and then – it exploded.
I stared at my reflection. An elegant figure that would not look out of place sipping cocktails by the bar at the Savoy gazed back. Outwardly, I appeared every inch the aristocratic Malfoy, unruffled by the swells of life. And inwardly – well, perception could easily be turned into reality.
Even to this day I missed him. He had protected me, in his own way, when my family had fallen into disfavor, his acidic words and his cold presence fending off harassment from the others who relished at our disgrace. I had gone to his portrait after that last battle at Hogwarts. To apologize … to confess … to mourn. He had looked upon me with an uncharacteristic softness, extracting from me a promise to live with my head raised.
I nodded, readying my grip on my wand. I looked at Potter. His eyes shone, his entire face alive with excitement and exertion.
The raid ended with them capturing most of the men inside the cave, including a Greyback that was still unconscious when a platoon led by Harry went in to scour the remnants.
“I’m not going to help you,” Draco said, trying to summon up courage and meet Riddle’s eyes. “I don’t understand why you even bother asking. I’m not my father.”
No. Stop. This was what Cross intended. To confuse me. To tempt me. The librarian attacking me showed that the Circle was untrustworthy, even if Cross himself was a man of his word. And I would not trust Cross with a piece of discarded rag, much less a matter on this magnitude.
“Now come on, don’t be shy. We don’t bite, you know.” Blaise gave Harry a hunter’s smile. “Unless you like that, of course.”
“There’s nothing to talk about,” I said, determined to wait patiently for the book to finish writing. “It was a kiss.”
I breathed in the sharp city air as I strolled along Diagon Alley. I had decided to walk again. The weather was smiling, and I didn’t think I could handle the hurtling sensation of magical travel. Not with my hangover. Pity that the limits of magic included their cures. If someone discovered an antidote, it would be an instant Order of Merlin, not to mention a Chocolate Frog card.
“Oh, come on, Draco, don’t be such a skeptic. Besides, it’ll be fun. Don’t you want to know what the future holds for you?”
“I don’t want to talk about this,” I said, turning away sharply. I looked around my flat, at the lived-in messiness, the assorted knickknacks, the little affluent symbols of a comfortable existence. It was a facile appearance of a space for someone who seemingly had everything. “Not right now.”
“Hmm … well, nice of you to stick me with the bill too. You know, you’re remarkably penurious for someone with a trust fund.”
“That’s pretty much the gist of it,” I answered him dryly. My head ached and I regretted my earlier insistence to meeting them with Potter. He was right: I would have been much more comfortable in bed. “The key itself is in the shape of a book, though that’s only its outward appearance. I wonder why it took that shape?” I needed to focus on the academic nature of the problem lest the terror and the near miss of it overwhelmed me.
It was a much-needed break. Their relationship had gone from enmity with sexual tension simmering underneath to an uneasy arrangement of casual sex and unspoken feeling to – Draco supposed they were dating now.
My Shield managed to redirect the force of his curse onto the wooden table. It cracked as papers and books were sent in the air. They came down slowly, in a stream of confetti.
“What you did here was impressive,” the Healer said. “I’ve never seen someone hold an Animus Inpertio for so long. Most people would have collapsed by now.”
Dolohov was on a water sled next to their boat, with a gun resting casually within his reach. A dark haired woman rode on another next to him, her gaunt face and haunted eyes watching them with calculating coolness.
Granger laughed. “No. I’m just a simple lawyer. Kingsley’s an alumnus of Hogwarts too. Gryffindor House, in fact. He tried recruiting all of us, though Harry was the only one who took him up on the offer.”
There was silence as Shacklebolt registered what Harry said. Harry waited, wondering how Shacklebolt would receive this analysis. Web burnout was especially prevalent among those with heavy cyberized bodies, which included essentially all of the Auror Force. And the Ministry, for that matter. It was a great danger, one that risked not only psychological, but physiological damage. Elixir was created by a well-meaning neuro-chemist to alleviate the symptoms of that, but ended up being far worse in consequence.
I debated taking the Tube. Leicester Square Station was right there, and it was only a few stops to Knightsbridge where I lived. But I needed the walk; I loved the crisp fall air, the slightly gloomy grey of the sky, the noise and bustle of the city. I strode past the elegant façade of the Ritz, taking the longer path along Piccadilly until the greenery of the parks came into view.
“Oh, I put the key in your bag,” Cross said. “You really should think twice before leaving it unattended. He objected to the plan, but I suppose he got his comeuppance. Stupid fool, getting caught by the Ministry.”
“First of all, they are not junk.” Draco glared at Harry. “And secondly, the Shield should be round, with ornate engravings.”
He leaned over me, pressed me into the couch. His arms hemmed me in between the cushions as he kissed me. I arched my back to meet his mouth, my arms reaching and cupping his arse.
“I am,” Draco said. He smiled genially. “I think you know enough about my background to know I have an abiding love for all antiquities and that I also have the means to meet any price.”
“The code on the Shield is organized by astrological and allegorical references in the depictions engraved in it. From what I remember, it has a lot to do with that, and also the mathematics of certain time measurements. The Greeks believed that mathematics held the key to the universe. It made sense for them that to link math, astronomy and astrology, and mythology in a way that we don’t today.”
Doholov returned, the loud hum of the sled adding to the confusing mix of noises, overpowering the sounds of fighting between Harry and Bellatrix. He wouldn’t fire at them without hitting Bellatrix, Draco knew. Unless he wanted to get rid of Bellatrix too.
A mess of emotions whirled within me…. Hearing what the librarian and his Master, whoever that may be, talk about me drew me back to when the Dark Lord occupied the Manor…. The sneers and the pointed remarks at my weakness, my failure, still haunted me.… And the fear that I was being led into a trap, that they knew enough about my weaknesses to use me, it struck my heart with ice….
Perhaps it was due to the excitement at finally having regular habitants again, but Kreacher had been outdoing himself with the cooking, stretching his gastronomical oeuvre, even if we were simply sitting in the kitchen. Two plates of duck confit gave off mouth-watering aromas, and roasted potatoes and steamed peppers took place at the center of the table.
“A little trick I picked up,” Harry said. “It’s a type of identifying spell that discerns what magic is in these walls. You were right – this does need blood. But only a little.”
“Then it’s settled!” Fudge exclaimed. “Our savior — Harry Potter! Our thanks are in order. I’ll arrange with matters with Shacklebolt later to make it official.”
It had not occurred to him how difficult it was to leave Harry again. They had met again in the morning for breakfast, a paltry meal of insipid tea and overcooked bacon, for the final briefing. Neither of them had mentioned what happened between them last night.
Granger and her husband were waiting for us in the drawing room. Their faces were pinched with worry, and Granger ran up to Potter with a worried “Harry!” as the Weasel cuffed him on the shoulder.
The Reading Room was empty today. Usually, I’d welcome it, but now it gave me a sense of unease. Without of the soft noises of the patrons moving about, the rusty of turning book pages, or the scratch of quill on parchment, the silence had a sinister undertone.
“I think my plan is the soundest,” Harry said. “We’ll go inside, and I’ll check to see where Riddle’s office is. And then we’ll wait until they finish their work and leave before we go inside and take the Shield and the Decoder.”
“You’re right, of course. Where are my manners?” He waved his hand and a silver tea set appeared on the table.  He motioned for me to sit as the pot began to pour into the bone china cups.
Instead I aimed another kick at him under the table. There was a thump as my foot connected with his shin. Potter let out a muffled oof as a small thump sounded.
“Ah.” Draco was only wearing a light sweater, barely enough during the day, but wholly inadequate at night. “I hadn’t expected to be out this late.”
“Absolutely not.” My father’s face was thunderous. “One time was bad enough. We can’t make this a regular occurrence.”
I had, to my surprise. Perhaps it was the relief of knowing my life was no longer threatened by Cross, but upon reflection, finding the Grimoire had certainly been memorable, not to mention thrilling. It provided a much-needed outlet that I never even realized I longed for. And it did lead me to Harry.
My father’s look of bad temper did not diminish. “You run entirely with the wrong crowds these days, Draco. First Potter and now Andromeda. Really – Andromeda? That bloody cow? Why can’t you become closer with the Greengrasses? You were engaged to their daughter once.”
Still, one must keep up appearances. And I knew I looked like how I felt: shit. I was tired, my mood irritable and jumpy. And that unexpectedly smooth meeting aside, I had not fully set aside my misgivings working with Potter. The combination of that and an unwanted infatuation made my head spin.
Despite Harry’s protestations, Malfoy had insisted on joining Harry to this meeting with his erstwhile friends. Hermione Granger and Ron Weasley … Harry hadn’t seen them in years.
Tap into the traffic cam eyes, Harry told Hedwig. Can you filter the visuals from them with the info from the Auror database? Match facial recognition with the license plates.
Malfoy chuckled. “My ego is telling me to respond ‘yes’ despite my better judgement. Very well, what do you want to find out?”
“I thought I already helped enough today.” Malfoy leaned back into an armchair. “I answered all your questions earlier and I rescued you from the tender attentions of Blaise. Though to be fair, I think he was actually fond of you. Maybe you two could have had a nice time together.”
“Where’d you learn to do that?” he asked as he came up to the body. He prodded it with the toe of his shoe. “He’s out cold.”
And what surprised him even more was that Harry had departed for work with a quick peck on Draco’s cheek. Like in the old days.
Draco grinned. “Yes. And I’ll try to contact my … ahh … more disreputable sources, about artifact smuggling. See where the biggest leak of Afghan artifacts are coming from. Hopefully, that’ll give us another lead to where Mors Mordre is.”
He shrugged, setting my milk on the bar top as he tapped my coffee machine. It made a little noise and began to steam. I sat down, heavily; my legs were about to give way. The mesmerizing smell of coffee filled the room. I breathed in. Heavenly.
I looked at the book-key with its unassuming appearance. Only Slytherin’s brood were able to activate it – perhaps it recognized the blood in me.
“What? Of course not. Don’t be ridiculous.” Harry glowered at Malfoy. “Thank you for your help,” Harry added ungraciously.
With a fresh cup of coffee – even just smelling it woke me up – I fished out the book from my bag and stretched out. It was a relief to for blood to circulate in my legs. I leaned back on the cushions.
At Draco’s face, Riddle laughed. “Don’t look so anguished at yourself. It isn’t typical that one has secondary security systems installed in a high-end office building like this one. After all, I myself was conflicted about it. We pay such a premium to be in this space and look at their poor security!” Riddle made a moue of mock disappointment that Draco wanted to slap.
“Ate earlier. And I never got the taste for black pudding either. The whole thing just puts me off.”
Harry didn’t need a computer analysis to tell him that. It was highly illegal for vehicles of any sort to disable their tracking and control chips. Even if this car was not carrying the drug runners they wanted, it was in fragrant breach of the law, and needed to be stopped and searched.
“Where’s your sense of civic duty?” Granger asked with an amused look. “But yes. I’ll have my assistant owl you with times so we can finalize the details. I have to warn you, though: most of the work won’t be as thrilling as looking for the Grimoire.”
“Are you alright?” Suddenly, Draco was surrounded by people. Harry, Granger, even Weasley: they crowded around him. Harry’s face was pinched with suppressed fury, and his lips were white.
There was a loud bang. Both me and Potter jumped, Potter whipping his wand out reflexively. It was barely in time – a bolt of red light went directly towards him.
“Then how are we supposed to see?” Harry snapped. His nerves were frayed – the heavy silence intermittently punctured by indistinct noises was suffocating. He had already switched on his infrared vision, but his bio-enhancements weren’t extensive, and the effect was limited.
“That’s the nature of facts,” Shacklebolt pointed out. “They fit the logic of a situation and explain what happened. You know as well as I that not everything is a conspiracy.”
Potter laughed. “I’ll have Kreacher bring you some of my old ones.” He looked at me appraisingly, his gaze lingering. I blushed at the intensity. Stop, I told myself.
Riddle laughed, a hair-raising, high-pitched sound that clawed at Draco’s ears. “You hold me in such high opinion, Potter. I’m almost flattered.” He turned to Bellatrix. “Perhaps you can demonstrate to Draco here an example of what would happen to Potter if Draco doesn’t comply.”
Draco endured an hour of angry lecture by the camp commander while an enormous face of Shacklebolt watched, projected on the screen by the video-link. Harry sat in the corner, quiet, his face shadowed.
My head was heavy. I had a sudden urge to lay on his shoulder. “Do you think they’ll get back together again?” I nodded at the now snogging couple facing Blaise and me. “I mean – as in a relationship.”
“We need more than just luck to beat Riddle,” Harry said, finally cracking a glimmer of a smile. “He’s the most powerful criminal in Europe, if not the world. And how do you plan to find him? We’ve tried for years without success.”
“Yes, that would be what I refer to.” I knew it wouldn’t be long before the Ministry took notice of the event. It had improved markedly in effectiveness. “A man in a cloak attacked me. I defended myself within the limits of Section Four, clause B of the International Statute of Secrecy, and –”
He continued before Harry could respond. “This schematic is really advanced for an SI. There seems to be a number of components that are … wait.”
And unlike the place we raided, there was no cellar with magical artifacts that might help me escape.
“I came because they couldn’t reach you,” Draco explained. He forced himself to keep talking, to keep his mind off the patter of bullets. “They spotted these men on satellite, but your radio wasn’t working, so I came.”
But my Occlumency was equal to it, even as I was locked into place, somehow frozen and unable to move. The mental pressure increased, like hot fingers pressing on my skull.
I could not respond to that. I was too numb to say anything, my head still spinning, my chest still pounding. If I had listened to my father and been a proper Malfoy, without chasing after lost books and murderous conspiracies ....
He gave up. Rereading what he already knew was useless. Draco tossed the book to the side, stood up and stretched. On a whim, he stepped outside his hut.
At the same time, a ladder unfurled from the helicopter. Bellatrix took hold of it with the dexterity of a trapeze artist. The helicopter flew up, lifting her into the sky. She wore a triumphant grin that stretched like a slit from ear to ear.
Now I could feel Potter scowl. “Definitely not.” His voice lowered. “I really like this garden. It’s peaceful. I miss seeing the stars. I don’t think I ever looked at them after I passed Astronomy.”
I think I got tired of this story at the end, so it does feel a bit rushed to me. It was still pretty fun to write, though, and my favorite part especially was researching all the historical tidbits that I needed to write this.
“How was your day?” Draco asked as they walked along the Embankment. Big Ben glowed in the background. They had neglected to discuss the niceties, Harry being too busy lecturing Draco on matters of safety and then that kiss at the office.
Draco’s tongue stuck to the roof of his mouth. He became acutely aware of every sensation, from the breeze on his arm to the loose flap of his shirt. His palms were sweaty, his knees heavy, and this morning’s breakfast churned unpleasantly in his stomach.
“We know your history, Mr. Malfoy,” Shacklebolt said. “You’ve worked in the Middle East before, trying to track down looted antiquities after the fall of Saddam. By all accounts, you were brilliant at it.”
“You’re not going,” Potter said with a snap of finality in his tone. “It’s far too dangerous. You’re not trained for this type of situation that Hermione and I are. You hired me to keep you safe, remember?”
“Maybe there’s a spelunking club in the village,” suggested Harry. “Or we could see if there’s a shop that sells outdoors sporting equipment, like tents and such.”
The wind picked up as my shoes crunched on autumn leaves. It grew quieter now; in my daze, I had walked into Hyde Park, straying off the route I usually took. I had been so lost in my thoughts that I didn’t notice.
“Don’t touch him, Greyback,” Dolohov said, walking in. “We need him in one piece and you know what a mess you leave after you play with your toys.”
“Oh?” Luna raised an eyebrow. “I thought you said that my research often veered into the ‘fanciful suppositions with no realistic backing.’”
Struggling to keep my face as impassive as I could, I managed a “I see” with relative equanimity. “So you and the female Weasel – Weasley – are no longer an item.”
“Of course.” In truth, Harry needn’t even bothered. Like all officers under the National Security Department, he was not beholden to the accountability laws that regular Law Enforcement agents had to obey. Shacklebolt, however, liked to make a show of his own people voluntarily following these rules, saying that transparency bred trust with the community. Personally, Harry doubted that – cynicism towards the government went too deep for a superficial demonstration of compliance. “You can check my SI recording, sir,” Harry added.
“It’s rude to leave without a farewell, even for uninvited guests such as yourselves,” Draco said, unfurling from the tree he was behind.
I refrained from saying that Slytherin’s Grimoire had a much stronger historical basis than the Crumple-Horned Snorkack. Her calm acceptance of my theory did boost my confidence, after all.
Draco wondered idly what had become of his father’s offices. Likely they had been re-let and redecorated, thus obliterating any remnants of its erstwhile occupant. Real estate in this city was a premium after all, and one didn’t waste it on sentimentality.
“We searched everywhere we thought your father might have considered safe,” Harry said, spearing a piece of chicken and wrapping it in the bread. “I can ask Kingsley again, but I don’t think it’ll turn up anything. Maybe it’s not at Malfoy Manor.”
I couldn’t help laughing. “Sounds much better than my day.” I hesitated, wondering how much to reveal. “I spent most of my day with my books. I don’t think the early Druidic hexes can compare to being chased by peacocks.”
I closed my eyes, the effects of the alcohol combining with a nausea from reading the letter. Cross was alive. There was no shock; somehow, my intuition had warned me that it had all been wrapped up too neatly.
Blaise gave a soft laugh. “Oh, definitely more than that. At least a Sickle.” His hand grazed my thigh under the table as he leaned in close to me. “You’ve an advanced degree after all.”
None came. My father looked at me. “I don’t deny I still think the pureblood families know best and are best equipped to lead wizarding society, but it’s clear that the world isn’t ready. And,” he looked at Potter, “sometimes people with the most unexpected origins can surprise us.”
“Still trying to convince Draco here to consult for us,” she said. She eyed him. “Go on, tell him you think it’s a good idea.”
There was a jutting mass of broken wood and rusted metal up ahead. Harry tapped Draco. Draco nodded. He saw. They inched closer.
She was also the only one to object to Draco’s termination when news of his father’s arrest broke. That had been the glue that cemented their friendship.
“You Slytherins and your blood.” Harry shook his head. Before I could inquire further into that remark, he asked: “What do you propose to do, then?”
“Yes. It is too much of a coincidence, though there is a chance that the hooded man is unrelated to what Commander Potter is investigating.”
“Hmm. Well in cases like these, the typical Auror protocol would be to open an investigation. If I were the investigating officer, I would look for clues at both where you were attacked and at your flat. But I expect if you’re telling so late, that the scene where you were attacked is probably cleaned up by now. And your flat –”
Cross gave Potter a disdainful look. “I’m surprised someone as stupid as you managed to pass the Auror exams. Of course I’m not coming with you.” He turned to me. “You, young Master Malfoy, will be coming with me, though.”
Harry Potter…. After five long years, he had decided to finally appear back in Draco’s life again, and in the most dramatic way possible.
“I do know about your background, Mr. Malfoy, and I’m wondering why you’re choosing to have dinner with me instead of bidding on several different lots I can think of which would meet your specifications. Or, for that matter, why you aren’t seeking to buy anything directly from the sellers. You’re well-connected enough to know people who might have what you want.”
“Thanks.” Harry smoothed out his shirt, looking self-conscious. It was funny to see someone who took out an entire camp of terrorists acting like a shy little boy. It was endearing, and it went to Draco’s heart faster than anything else.
“Relax, Malfoy.” Potter laughed. It was deep and toe-curling; I wanted to listen to it all day. “I’m just teasing.”
And suddenly the thought became too much to bear. I fell to my knees, the threadbare carpet rubbing against my knee.
I thought about it. Blaise was beautiful against my sheets, long and dark and lean. Anyone would be a fool to turn him down. But I was tired suddenly, though my cock wasn’t, and I wanted nothing more than to sleep.
“Oh, yes. They live in London, don’t they? I’ve been meaning to reach out to them, but ….” My voice trailed off. I knew about the circumstances which befell their family. I was not sure if they wanted to see me, a reminder of the War and the scion of a family that abandoned them.
