“And when you have an article with an incendiary title like “
Harry snorted. “If you had that power, you definitely wouldn’t have to be working here, and then where would I be?”
“And where is this computer?” Snape asked, circling his hand in a rushing gesture.
“But sales are still going up,” Harry protested, pointing to the number representing the previous week’s sales numbers, which still showed an increase over the previous week’s number.
“Mr Potter! Language!” Professor McGonagall chastised from the head table as a chorus of giggles burst out around the room. Given that he was sitting halfway down the Gryffindor table, he must have been much louder than he thought.
“Harry, you can’t be serious?” Hermione’s voice pitched up as she chastised him. Harry switched the mobile to his other ear as the taxi came to a stop in front of the address that Harry had supplied. Leaning to the side, he pulled his wallet out of his back pocket and began pulling out the fare as he held the phone to his ear using his shoulder.
Mr Snape continued as if Hermione had not spoken, “And nearly every produce item you find in the supermarket will have residue pesticides on it. The solution is to simply wash your produce before consumption.”
Harry figured the Healer didn’t need to know all the specifics of the particular fantasy they were fulfilling as part of that celebration, so he left out the minutiae of the evening. “Since it was a special occasion, I decided to use a Priapo charm—I’m not as young as I once was,” he added. “And it doesn’t seem to be wearing off.”
“I hope neither of you was thinking of taking a holiday in the next few months,” Kingsley said. “Good work, you two.”
Hermione shook her head. “We don’t have time for that. We’re starting Everlasting Elixirs today and it’s a very advanced potion. You don’t want to miss an important instruction and accidentally give yourself a nosebleed that will never stop, do you?”
at the man. His gut had been proven correct when he’d found the man was planning to stealthily slip the condom off and empty himself inside Harry. Draco had felt no remorse when he’d Obliviated the man and sent him on his way with a newly-developed deep and profound fear of STIs.
Their next fuck was rougher and wanted to spank Harry, who nodded his permission. Harry’s cheeks were pink with flush when the man penetrated him and gave Harry a hard, brutal fuck. Harry jostled forward into Draco’s chest as the other man drilled into him, the sharp slapping sound of skin on skin filling the room with each pump of the man’s hips. Draco watched for signs of distress from Harry, but there was no sign of their safeword on the other man’s lips.
“Maybe I should charge you then,” Harry said, earning a scoff and an eye-roll from the other man.
“Well yes, obviously we weren’t expecting to maintain the same level of success we had initially,” Hermione agreed, but her brows were still drawn together in concern as she continued, “but we projected the sales growth to continue for at least three more months. I’m already noticing a downward trend in the numbers, which is not good.”
“Mr Potter, could you explain to me why we’re still paying your agency’s rather exorbitant rates when you seem incapable of delivering the results that you promised us?” Severus Snape looked relaxed in his seat, his chin propped up against his bent forefinger and thumb as he gazed expectantly at Harry. Harry knew better though; he’d heard the shouting complaints that Mr Snape had doled out to Oliver over speakerphone earlier.
“Come inside me. Fill me up,” Harry begged and that was all Draco needed, his orgasm crashing over him as he emptied himself deep inside Harry’s body. Draco may be Harry’s ‘daddy’, but he was under Harry’s thrall just as much as Harry was under his.
Harry lifted his head and squinted over at the fuzzy red lights of the alarm clock on the bedside table. “It’s a little after 1:30,” Harry told him, dropping his head back down and breathing in the subtle citrus scent lurking beneath the sweat from their activities.
Harry startled as a cool, dry voice vocalised the very thought that had just been crossing his mind. He spun around to find a ridiculously fit man standing behind him. His short hair was arranged in a stylish faux-hawk and was so blonde that it almost appeared white, seeming to pick up and reflect the scant lighting in the bar, like a beacon. He was a few inches taller than Harry, which gave Harry the opportunity to appreciate the man’s trim physique and the way his lavender-coloured dress shirt hugged the muscles beneath, the top two buttons open and loose revealing a mouthwatering long neck that made Harry want to lean in and run his tongue up the length and around to whisper in his ear.
, if people don’t take the time to actually read the article, then they’re not going to be inclined to pick up a bunch of kale when they’re doing their weekly shop,” Hermione added.
Harry didn’t know whether to be relieved or disappointed. On the one hand, it didn’t look like he had detention in his future for drugging a fellow student, but he still had to suffer through the usual prickly Malfoy for the rest of the class.
“That’s okay,” Harry said. “I think that’s probably pretty common during hen nights. When my best friend, Hermione, had her hen night, she told me that she got so drunk that she mistook a police officer for a stripper and stuck a £20 note into his utility belt.”
“My best friend is getting married in a week!” the drunk woman that refused to let go of Harry’s arm was yelling, despite Harry’s increasing reluctance to move over towards the rowdy revellers. “Come do a shot with us!”
His third had been quick, trickling down the curved skin of the other man’s arse and pooling in the Dimples of Venus in his lower back as Harry squeezed those soft cheeks together and fucked his cock between them.
As he felt Albus’s warm hands spread the cool lotion carefully over his shoulder blades, Scorpius’s objections melted away under the summer sun.
“Explain.” That one word was filled with infinite volumes and Mr Snape stared down his hook-nose at Harry.
Harry gave a few small nods of his head, his motions hampered by Draco’s tight hold on his chin.
Harry smiled shyly before looking over at his husband. “It was a pretty amazing few hours.”
“It looks like somebody has earned himself a treat. Should we head home now, or are you all fucked out?” Draco asked, grinning to himself as he already knew what Harry’s answer would be.
“Yes, Master Malfoy, sir. Tweaky will wash these and attach them to the wall right away, sir!” The small elf scurried over and took hold of the bowl and held it against his body with one hand so he could snap his fingers with the other hand and disappear with another pop.
“Yeah. Maybe you’ve seen the advertisements around? We’re doing a big tie-in with an upcoming cooking show.” Harry watched as understanding dawned on Draco and he regarded Harry with amusement.
Harry swallowed nervously, trying to shake off the creeping sense of dread that those cold, shark eyes staring unblinkingly instilled in him. Whether she sensed his discomfort, or just couldn’t handle the pregnant pause, Hermione leaned forward beside him and flipped open the brown leather folder in front of her on the table.
“Are you ready?”
Draco let out a very undignified shriek as a shock of cold snow fell down his collar and streaked across his back.
“Good good,” Slughorn cast an assessing look over at Malfoy, who was currently biting the corner of one of his nails and then pulling back to study his progress. “You’re quite lucky to have Mr Potter here as a partner, Mr Malfoy. He’s got a real aptitude for potion-making.”
Harry jumped back in, hoping that even though they didn’t yet know who was behind the attack ads, Snape would be appeased by the new plans that he and Hermione had come up with for getting the sales numbers back up enough that he didn’t fire the firm. “I assure you that we’re working on tracking down the source of the websites and counter-ads, but in the meantime, if you’ll just give us a few more minutes, Hermione and I can share with you some of the ideas we have to counteract the drop in sales.”
Hermione and Harry exchanged a look and Harry nodded, indicating Hermione should share the next piece of information they’d managed to gather.
Going for subtle, Harry watched Draco covertly out of the corner of his eye for a few minutes. Draco was idly grinding the pestle into the mortar any time that Slughorn turned to survey the class and they were within eyeshot, but other than that, he was just staring out of the small window that was near the top of the wall at ground level, the only source of light into the dungeon Potions room.
“I see,” the Healer said in an even voice, which made Harry feel like his raging boner was just another day at the office for this woman. It helped to alleviate some of his embarrassment. “How long has this erection lasted?”
“Having fun?”
Harry managed to control himself as they made their way up to the hotel room on the twenty-third floor that he had rented...mostly. An overwhelming tide of desperation and disappointment rushed through him when the elevator door that was just about to close and give them a few moment’s privacy reversed course and began opening again to allow an elderly couple to join them. They eyed Harry and his blond companion as they entered and Harry wondered what they were thinking, whether they could read the illicitness of their relationship all over their faces. But then the woman smiled kindly at him and he smiled back, realising he was being ridiculous: they were just two men standing in an elevator together.
Harry laughed. “Hermione, this isn’t some movie. They’re in advertising, they’re not secret agents. Unless you’re suggesting that MI5 is behind this somehow?”
“What am I? Your house elf? I’m not your servant, Potter,” Draco mumbled. Harry turned to the git to say something cutting back, but he stopped when he took in Draco’s morose look. There was definitely something going on with him. His hair was still sleeked back, but it looked more greasy than held under control by hair products like it used to, and though he still picked a fight with Harry at every opportunity, he seemed dispirited, like it was more habit than will.
“Mmmm, can we just Apparate there?” Harry asked, moaning against Draco’s chest.
“Ouch! Relax! I’ve got a treat for you right here!” George sucked on his finger, easing the pain from the nip that Harry’s large white owl had just given him. Flipping the lid open on the box on the bookstand by the window, he grabbed a couple of treats and put them in the palm of his hand, holding it out to the impatient owl and letting it retrieve them at its own pace.
doing here?” Draco shot back.
Harry’s fingers wrapped around Draco’s arms and dug in as he obviously struggled to hold back his orgasm. Peeking down the length of the bed, Draco could see the tented trousers of the other man that made it obvious that Harry’s whines and moans were not falling on deaf ears.
Hermione rolled her eyes as she unplugged her computer from the projector. “You know I’m not foolish enough to ask you to.” She leaned down, pulling up her email and scanning the list in her inbox, quickly and efficiently filing them away in the variety of nested folders she had set up. “If only there was some way to extract a binding promise from someone,” she mused. “Some sort of...unbreakable vow.”
A wide grin grew on Fred’s face as understanding dawned on him. “Looks like I owe you five sickles, eh?”
Harry was just about to answer when Draco interrupted him, “Do I know you? You look very familiar.”
His boss, Kingsley Shacklebolt, clapped him on the shoulder before speedwalking towards the elevator to catch up with the Growers board. Harry smiled gratefully as the other members of Media Magic offered him whispered words of encouragement as the room slowly emptied, but he felt impatient to be rid of them all and be able to debrief with Hermione. After a minute or so, the large conference room was empty with the exception of Hermione and himself.
“None of the companies we contacted that are hosting the native ads was willing to provide us with the information of who purchased the ad, however, we did discover that all the articles eventually traced back to one of three websites that are stated as sources within the advertisement,” Hermione explained.
man with no interest in a half-naked woman.
Draco returned to stroking Harry’s hair. “Trophies. Now, are you in or out?”
Pulling out her wand, she pointed it under the table and cast a series of vanishing charms.
“See something you like?” the sexy voice asked and Harry startled, yanking his gaze up to the man’s face to find him looking down at Harry, an amused look pulling at his features.
“Pray tell, why are you here?”
“You’re fit. You should come!”
“What? Yeah. Of course, I’m listening,” Harry said quickly. He really hoped that Hermione wouldn’t call him on the lie.
“Oh, um...Harry. I’m Harry.” Harry held out his hand to the raven-haired bride, but to his surprise, she crossed over to him and greeted him in the same way she had Draco.
“Oh, I remember,” Harry said. “So...a pint?”
Harry nodded sheepishly as the women congratulated him and he tried to excuse himself from the ruckus. A large hand clapped on his shoulder and he turned with excitement, hoping to find the alluring man from earlier, but instead, he found Ron giving him a look of surprise.
“Mmmmmm,” came a moaned response to Harry’s exploratory shifts. “If you think you’re sticking that thing inside me again, you have another thing coming.”
“One of our biggest obstacles is getting people to overcome their fear of the unknown. Lettuce is comfortable and familiar for people, but they don’t know what to do with kale. It has a very different texture to it that could be an impediment to getting people to put that bunch into their trolleys on their weekly shop.”
Draco turned to give him an appalled look. “If you think I am going there reeking of sex and sticky with come, you are sorely mistaken.” Draco seemed satisfied with the temperature and stepped into the shower, his pale hair darkening as it dipped into the water.
“I’d rather be paired with an enraged pixie, Sir,” Malfoy drawled, looking bored. He went back to biting at his cuticle again.
“Is that—” Harry stopped mid-retort when something dawned on him. Malfoy was acting just as obnoxious and cruel as ever. Surely the effects of the macaroon must have taken effect by now… Harry needed to test to be sure. “I was just wondering what you thought of my new cologne. I just got it. I thought I would try a new scent.”
Just then, Pansy seemed to notice Harry standing awkwardly behind Draco and her face transitioned seamlessly into one of open-mouthed excitement. “ARE YOU FINALLY GETTING LAID?!”
“Hello Mr,” the Healer looked up as she entered the room and Harry noticed a brief flash of recognition before her professionalism kicked in and she schooled her features, “Potter. What brings you here today?”
“We have seen an uptick in articles on a variety of health-related websites that highlight the supposed health risks of kale has been gaining prominence in the search engine results,” Hermione explained. “Articles which claim that kale is high in compounds that can interfere with thyroid function and carries a high amount of pesticide residue.”
And, somehow, Malfoy had become even more obnoxious than he used to be. Everything that Harry did seemed to be the new most annoying thing that Draco had ever been subjected to, and he was never reluctant to express his displeasure. Harry had tried to ignore Draco’s frequent outbursts, but Draco had an uncanny ability to use his words as weapons that he tossed in Harry’s direction. It felt like a death by a thousand cuts.
“I’ll be fine. I’m going to grab one more pint and then I’m heading home,” Harry assured her. “You two get out of here.”
His fourth had followed not long after as Harry had reclaimed that sweet hole and had fucked him hard, pulling the other man’s hips back against him again and again, not relenting until he had felt the tell-tale stiffening of the man’s body and the unbearably tight squeeze of his arse.
Sitting back in her chair, Hermione crossed her arms in front of her chest and hit Harry with an intense stare. “Alright, then what did I just say?”
“To my wedding, silly!” Pansy laughed and slapped him on the arm. Harry couldn’t help but grin at the woman, who was definitely pretty deep into her cups if she was inviting complete strangers to her nuptials. Especially a stranger that had sucked tequila out of her navel less than an hour ago.
“Oh good, Harry, are you okay with us leaving?” Hermione looked at him uncertainly, but she couldn’t stop the devious smile that tilted her lips when Ron slipped his hand around her waist. Harry pretended not to notice when Ron’s hand dropped out of sight a moment later.
Draco had always had a keen eye for decorating and he had been the one to pick most of the furniture and decorative elements for their home that they had bought together almost two years ago. Their kitchen was gorgeous and would make any chef jealous. Their living room was the perfect blend of opulence and inviting comfort. Their bathroom was a marble masterpiece that made you want to while away the entire day in the large sunken tub equipped with whisper-soft, powerful jets—thanks to a charm he had spent four months perfecting.
“SHOT! SHOT! SHOT! SHOT!” the partygoers began chanting again as Harry was manhandled forward until he was standing level with the bride’s belly button. The bartender winked at him as he pulled out the tequila bottle once more, but this time rather than filling a line of shot glasses, he tipped the nozzle over the bride’s stomach, the liquid pooling in her navel. Harry watched nervously as the woman accepted a wedge of lime and bit down on it, pulp out and facing him.
“And who, pray tell, is your type?” Draco turned to look at him, his steely grey eyes drilling into Harry, expectant. Harry was about to say something flippant, to cut the tension between them, but then Draco added, “You know what they say: Fortune favours the brave.”
“Mmm, yeah,” Harry murmured, shifting against his husband and letting the sensitive head rub against the smooth stretch of Draco’s perineum. Draco pulled away and Harry was about to protest until Draco turned around to face him. Harry wrapped his arms around Draco’s waist and swung them so that Draco was lying atop him, their cocks—Draco’s still not quite recovered—trapped between their bodies. “And it’s ready to go again if you are.”
“None of this is new,” Mr Snape looked unconvinced. “Though high in goitrins, it would require the consumption of at least one kilogram of raw kale a day for several months to consume enough to result in thyroid function disruption. And cooking or steaming the kale before consumption eliminates that risk.”
“Yes, Pansy. And when your soon-to-be-husband asks how you know Harry, should we just explain that Harry here saw you in your knickers and used your body as a shot glass?”
Harry felt his face heat and he squirmed on the examination table, his hand not moving from his lap where it was currently holding down his still-persistent erection against his thigh. “Well, you see, it was Draco’s birthday yesterday, so we wanted to do something special to celebrate.”
“I promise that the next time I go off on a quest, I’ll have the taxi swing by and pick you up first,” he said as he reached up and knocked on the door using the knocker, which was an elaborate silver piece that was shaped like a snake curled around itself and forming an infinity symbol.
As usual, Hermione’s data analysis had been spot-on and the drop in numbers had not been a blip like Harry had hoped. For the last few weeks, they had been scrambling to figure out why their campaign was falling to pieces and trying to figure out how they could stop the bleeding and resuscitate it.
“The articles were written in a way that seemed to suggest they were like any other article on the site, but they were actually paid pieces,” Hermione explained. When Snape’s brows drew together, she elaborated, “Advertisements that were designed to look like legitimate news pieces. It’s something we call ‘native advertising’; they’re meant to be indistinguishable from the rest of the website content.”
Draco sat back in the chair he was seated in with a furrowed brow as he tried to place the woman, who turned back to Harry and gave him an expectant look.
The man teased Harry’s crease, pressing his condom-covered head over Harry’s hole and taint repeatedly.
He raised his head to gaze at his son. The boy—man now, he supposed—was still sitting on the bench, back rigid as he nervously picked at his nails. One of Lucius’ biggest regrets was the effect his terrible decisions have had on his son, but even as he watched his son wilt while the Dark Lord had stalked the halls of their family home, it still always felt like it was impossible to turn off the road he had set them down. He had been wrong of course, and his wife and son had been smart enough to change course. He was glad that their 13th hour redemption had bought them leniency from the Wizengamot and they would only have probation and not spend any imprisonment time.
Harry resettled against him, his head turned away from the door, and Draco stroked his fingers through his hair, giving Harry a few moments to mentally prepare for what was about to happen. When Harry relaxed against him, Draco reached over and flipped the switch on the bedside table turning the little light outside the room to green.
“She’s generally not quite that...overwhelming,” Draco eventually settled on. “She’s had rather a lot to drink this evening.”
The man grinned at Draco before grabbing hold of his ankles and splitting his legs wide, stretching Harry’s legs even wider apart to accommodate the distance. Then the man laid down on his back between Draco’s legs so that he was perfectly situated for Harry’s cock to slide down into his open maw. Draco could feel the top of the man’s head brush against his balls through his trousers as the man suckled on Harry’s cock, arms wrapping around Harry to pull him deeper into his throat.
, Harry had recommitted to his career in advertising.
Draco seemed to realise his mistake a moment too late and he drew Harry an apologetic look.
“What?” Hermione asked.
“I’m sure Pans will be thrilled to know you found the experience to be such an ordeal.”
Embarrassed at the thought, he dropped his robe and gathered together his books, setting the box of macaroons on top of them. “Thanks, Hermione.”
Harry shook himself and refocused on Hermione, who was pointing at a spreadsheet with an incomprehensible grid of numbers on it. His mind had been wandering again, reliving that night with Draco from a few months ago. It was only supposed to be a one-off, but his mind had developed a tendency of wandering back to it at inconvenient times. He didn’t regret the night, but he definitely regretted not asking more questions. Like what Draco’s phone number was, or his last name even.
After a few minutes, Harry spun around at the sound of the heavy door creaking open again to see Draco emerge wearing a soft grey coat which perfectly accentuated his eyes. “So Lettice works for Big Lettuce?” Harry asked as they turned and began walking down the street, Draco leading the way.
“Once this campaign is complete, kale will be the talk of the town and chefs of every level will be scrambling to shake things up in their kitchens,” Harry finished as he clicked through to the end of the presentation he’d prepared. He looked around the room and studied the faces seated up and down both sides of the long conference table. There were a few smiling nods being exchanged amongst the junior members of the Kale Growers of Britain—it was made very apparent during the first meeting between Kale Growers of Britain and his employer, Media Magic, that they did not appreciate anyone using their rather unfortunate acronym—but the bolus of nerves sitting heavily in his stomach was refusing to go anywhere since the look on Mr Snape’s face, the head of the Growers association, was less than reassuring.
“This. Us. The road trip.” Draco makes a vague motion, somehow encompassing everything and nothing at once. “You know. Shitty motels and shitty food. Waking up at six and diving for hours. The sunrises.”
It’s not until he pulls back onto the road that Harry realizes Draco’s leaning against the door, the soft grey of Harry’s hoodie pillowed underneath his head. He’s barely illuminated - the dim glow of the buttons on the dashboard, the faint pinpricks of light from the stars spinning above them. One of his hands is splayed against the window, a ghostly outline in the darkness. Harry stares at the faint lines of his body and something impossibly fond lights in his chest.
Draco closes his eyes, breathing in everything; the air, the smoke, Harry, flush against his body, pressed up against his lips.
“Yeah.”
“I thought you said your parents didn’t care about you.”
“Congrats,” he told him, after Draco shoved his way through the crowd, goggles and cap dangling in his hand. His medal gleamed against his bare chest. “You were amazing.”
Silence. Dry air and the blazing sun. Heat wraps scalding fingers around Harry’s anger, burns it all to dust. A pit of something oily settles in his stomach.
“Draco,” he says and God his voice was hoarse, like bits of metal grating against stone, like he had been screaming for hours without end. “Fuck. Draco.” He breaks off at the end, burying his face against Draco’s neck; Draco feels his lips moving against skin and shivers.
Draco had picked the place out, half-forgotten on a small side street, the windows boarded and the door locked. Harry had thought he was crazy at first, crazy for wanting an old wreck like this was.
Draco shrugs, face propped up on his knees. “Couldn’t be bothered to,” he says, but Harry can hear the lie through his voice. “It’s only an hour and a half to the motel. I would have been fine.”
“Like you for example. You’re a chaser. When you want something you go for it. It’s all or nothing. It’s a sprint. You see what you want and you fight like hell to get it.”
“Why didn’t you?”
“I remember,” Harry says, and his voice sounds uneven and unsteady, a wooden rowboat balanced on rocky waves. “What about it?”
It felt like
“What happened?”
“Dramatic bastard.”
The memory fades in and out, a patchwork of recollections. He thinks of Draco two years later, sunlight in his hair and stars at his back, mountains instead of condos, highways instead of alleys. Draco got his license right after Harry did, despite his birthday being earlier, but he’d always let Harry drive.
Sirius cuts him off. “Yes. He does.”
The last 100 was always the most interesting, Harry thought. Everyone either faded away or sprinted, dolphin kicks and flip turns, heads held down at the flags. The last desperate push to the finish - it always was the same no matter what event it was, the final lunge for the wall, fingers smashing against the touchpad. He watched Draco fold himself over his middle, fingers wrapped around the lane ropes, shoulders heaving as he turned to see his time.
“Fine,” Harry says. He turns his face into Draco’s palm, his voice broken. “What happened to your eye?”
“But it wouldn’t have been fair,” Harry finishes. “To force you to give up something for a wish.”
“Oh Harry,” Draco murmurs, his voice impossibly soft. “You think I haven’t tried?”
Harry leaves Draco dozing in the car while he sorts out the room keys, in a foyer with linoleum floors and flickering fluorescent lights. The buzz of electricity fills his ears as he accepts the small pieces of plastic, scribbles his signature with a cheap pen, lets the door click shut behind him as he heads back towards the car.
“You’re such a hypocrite,” Harry says, but he pulls onto the narrow road heading towards the beach anyway. There’s no one else here - there was another, more popular beach only a short distance away and this tiny strip of sand lay mostly forgotten.
“Are we going to do this again?”
“Yeah, but remember, fortune favours the brave,” Harry said, flashing back to Draco’s provocative words, the dare that fortified Harry’s nerve and won him a night of the best sex he’d ever had. The first of hopefully many more.
Harry doubted very much that they would be able to do that until Draco’s arms slipped around him from behind and he felt soft lips on his neck. Harry shook off the irrational jealousy that sometimes got the better of him and leaned back against that familiar chest. “Yeah, that’d be great.”
A few minutes later, he came back to their bench and stopped dead in his tracks when he saw Malfoy take a bite of a delicate French pastry.
“I thought I paid for the whole night,” Harry whispered into the shell of the other man’s ear as he nuzzled his nose into the long, blond locks. The man reeked of sex—sweat, semen and lust—and Harry thought he’d never smelled anything as delicious.
“You did a great job, Harry,” she encouraged as she gave his arm a reassuring squeeze. “But maybe try to avoid calling our potential clients fools in the future?”
Apparently Harry’s theory was right then. He blew past Ron’s not-so-subtle innuendo. “Right, cheers. I think I might hang around for a bit here. Have one more pint.”
Lucius eyes slid over to the Boy Who Lived, sitting beside Draco. His mind was a jumble of anger, resentment, and gratitude that he didn’t have the time to sort through right now. Potter’s testimony in Narcissa and Draco’s favour had been pivotal to their light sentences, and he couldn’t help but feel a newfound gratitude for the kid. As he stared, lost in his thoughts, Harry reached out and placed his hand on Draco’s forearm in an act of comfort and he couldn’t help but notice how the tension in Draco’s shoulders seemed to ease.
Lucius took one last fortifying breath of Narcissa and then he reached up and pulled her clenched hands loose from his robes. Bending down, he gave each of her knuckles a soft kiss, ignoring the impatient shuffling of his Auror guards, and then lifted her face up to look at him.
“At least my snowball just went down your back! Yours went right down my arse crack!”
“Lifting a pint from the table to your mouth doesn’t count as a workout, Harry,” Hermione accused, laughing.
With a sharp pop, a diminutive elf appeared in the room. “Master Malfoy called Tweaky?”
Harry’s mobile rang again and Harry pulled it out to see Hermione’s number on the screen. He declined the call. “What kind of business is this?” Harry asked as he looked around the front of the building yet again. He noticed a small, discreet plaque to the left of the door that he hadn’t noticed before which read: Abracadabra Agency.
“Hermione, I have to go,” Harry managed to stutter out before stabbing wildly at his mobile trying to hang it up. He was too worried that Draco would disappear again if he looked away. Finally, her distant voice cut out and he tucked the mobile into his jacket pocket.
“That’s quite presumptuous of you,” Draco said.
“Thank you, sir,” they said in unison as Kingsley turned and made to leave, but a moment later he turned back around.
“Oh, I was just going to take a second look at the demographic analysis and—”
Draco shot him a smirking look. “You can’t make stuff like that up. So what would you like for lunch? A salad perhaps?”
“Oh, um...yeah. Maybe about 15 streets in that direction.” Harry pointed over his shoulder with his thumb.
“Sorry Professor!” he called as he brushed flaccid cereal flakes onto the floor.
“Ugh. That kale monstrosity?” Harry asked. “You know, just because we’re trying to hawk the stuff doesn’t mean you have to buy into the hype.”
Hermione turned her head to smirk at him. “I would imagine you would be flailing around trying to optimize the SEO results.”
Before the sexy stranger could answer, a hand was grabbing hold of Harry’s upper arm and he was being hauled around to find one of the inebriated members of the hen do party tugging at him. It was only then that Harry registered the loud chanting that had started while he had been distracted by the intriguing man.
“To help overcome this fear of the unknown, we give people something familiar: a celebrity chef endorsement. We will hire one of the most familiar faces in the culinary industry to develop a collection of brand new recipes.”
“What are you doing here?” Harry asked accusingly. One of Draco’s perfectly shaped eyebrows rose at Harry’s question and the surprise on his face began to give way to suspicion.
They had disengaged then, and sleep had overtaken them, but even though Harry’s dick was ready and willing, the lithe body beside him seemed to still be overtaken with exhaustion.
His first release had been painted onto the waiting pink tongue as the other man had kneeled between Harry’s legs and sucked him to completion.
Narcissa stepped forward carefully, not wanting to make any rapid movements in front of the tense Aurors, until she was so close that the brought her hands up and fisted them in the robes at his chest, burying her face in his chest as a sob shook her torso. Lucius slowly brought his arms up and rubbed her back soothingly, making sure to keep his hands visible to the Aurors and not giving them any excuse to make this any worse for his family.
Those perfectly-plucked eyebrows shot up in surprise as Harry’s erection brushed the other man’s arm. The man dipped his finger into the glass, tracing the pad in a circle around the top of the oversized ice cube as he considered Harry’s proposal. He took his time, slowly siphoning off Harry’s confidence and sanity until Harry started to worry the man was going to deny him. Finally, when Harry was just starting to worry that he’d done something wrong and botched this, the man spun on his stool and spread his legs on either side of Harry, grabbing hold of the buckle of his belt and pulling him in towards him. Harry gasped as the cold finger grazed against the head of his cock where it peeked out.
This Drabble was inspired by a collaboration I did with
“I guess this is my lucky day,” their final stud said, grinning. “Word’s spread around the club that you’ve got a hot as fuck little piece in here and everyone’s desperate to get a taste for themselves.”
Draco found the man’s cocky confidence entertaining. “I’ll enjoy watching you try.”
“Draco, darling! Have you come to buy us more drinks?” Pansy shouted, the two rings that had made it around the horn spun around as she tossed her head back to look up at them.
“Done being all melodramatic?”
“Oh really?” Draco says. Harry sees the glint in his eye and gulps. “Then you wouldn’t have a problem with drinking it?”
“My parents.” His voice is tight. Harry stares at the turn of Draco’s neck and imagines the delicate outline of a rope. “They want me to stop swimming.”
Draco drops his hands. His face is calm, almost blank. “I’m going to take a shower,” he says, and he’s off the bed in a heartbeat. “15 minutes?”
“Ground floor. There’s a vending machine next to it, apparently. We can get Gatorade too. Pretend we’re at a meet again.”
“And who’s fault is that?” Harry mutters drily.
“I’m fine.” Draco lets his hand drop, resting on Harry’s hip. “I’m fine.”
He dreams of the first time Draco called him, almost two and a half years ago.
It wasn’t a question. Draco feels the blood drain from his face, his heart falling to the floor. He takes a deep breathes, holds it, waits until he knew his voice wouldn’t shake. “He’s one of my closest friends.”
“Oh, like you haven’t bitched about it to me before.”
Draco bites his lip, hard. Harry’s still shaking on the ground, curled up on himself like someone was kicking him; he swears at the sight. “I know. It doesn’t. And I swear - afterwards you can do whatever you want to me. Throw me in Azkaban, torture me - I don’t give a fuck. But please -
“Does it matter?” There had been thousands of drives after that one - with Draco and without. He’d driven for five hours with Ron and Hermione last summer, up to Sirius and Remus’ house in the mountains. This was hardly his first road trip.
The sound of a bang startles him; Draco’s slammed his palm against the dashboard. Every line in his body is tense, muscles drawn tight. Harry watches him and thinks of a dive, hunched over the blocks, staring into the water.
“Depends how good you are in bed.” Harry tunes out the suggestive noise Draco makes, stares up at the clouds instead. “We probably should go. Unless we want to get caught in the rain?”
He makes it past the crowd of people, but Draco barely manages another step before Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger cut in front of him. There are tracks in the grime on Ron’s face, obviously from tears; Draco thinks about the shock of red hair on one of the corpses and wonders who Ron had lost.
“No.” Draco’s voice is flat. “Don’t be.”
They line up at the end of the pool together, toes curled over the edge, fingers braced on the floor. Harry hasn’t done a dive in what felt like months - his back creaks as he bends down, arms taught and tense. He doesn’t look at Draco next to him, doesn’t study the curve of his spine and the build of his legs, the bones in his wrist as he shifted slightly, fingers braced on the tiled floor.
His voice was steady, in that awful, fragile way, the voice Draco always used desperately trying not to fall apart. “My mother doesn’t care,” he said, and it could almost pass for nonchalance if Harry didn’t know him so well. “My father cares too much.”
Draco closed his eyes;
Draco was sitting on the hood of his car, one foot carelessly propped up against the grill. His hair was still wet from practice, water dripping down his neck, soaking into the thin t-shirt he was wearing.
Harry passes the bar to him, turned so that he can read the words printed across the front.
Draco ducked his head. “Coach yelled at me. Said I breathed on the first stroke at the last 50. Called me an idiot.”
Draco laughs, unexpected in the slow heat. “If you think this is fighting you should have seen my parents.”
Harry laughs, then freezes. His eyes go wide; Draco looks over his shoulder but finds no one beside his friends and Harry’s friends, still watching him with wary eyes. “What?”
He regrets the words as soon as it leaves his mouth. Draco grins, his face turning evil. “Well then,” he says. “It’s a good thing I love my boyfriend so much then.”
“Sure.”
Sirius closes his eyes. “I don’t know. He was…beautiful. All full of light - the steady kind. A candle, compared to the raging flames inside of me - inside of both of us,” he adds. “He never thought he was good enough, but he was better then I ever could be.”
Harry nods, even as his head burned with questions. “Are you alright?”
“How long do you think it’ll be?”
“What?”
“You’re in a hoodie,” Harry points out. Draco had rolled the sleeves up to just below his elbows, the blue tracery of his veins visible through the pale skin. “Take it off.”
“Already have.”
Harry thumbed through his phone - his text thread with Draco was still open. He scrolled down - his last message that he sent to Draco was simple.
Harry holds his gaze. “Would you?”
“Like them? Family bonds can be hard to sever. Just take me for an instance.”
Draco’s smile doesn’t reach his eyes.
“I hate you,” he gets out through gritted teeth. Draco splashes him - he yelps and jumps backwards. “You dick!”
“Uh…” Draco digs his phone out of his pocket. He flicks it on with one hand, the other pushing handfuls of hair out of his eyes. “Two hours? Give or take.”
The car stops. Harry sucks in a deep breath - everything is too bright, too raw. It’s the press of glass against his palm, the rub of Draco’s hoodie against his skin, the nostalgia for something that never happened. He grips the steering wheel - his fingers ache in protest from clenching onto the gas dispenser, an echo of a bruise.
“Wait,” Harry says, “Careful - “
“Maybe we should go to sleep,” Draco says. His voice sounds slightly strangled, catching and snagging and breaking, like the waves crashing over rocks.
“Are you alright?”
When Draco finally stirs, Harry's got the room mostly in order - sweatshirts shoved back into bags, wrappers collected and tossed in the bin. Draco curses as he wakes up, low and hoarse and dirty. Harry stares at Draco’s messy hair and tries not to let his eyes drift to the barest curve of a shoulder half-revealed by the falling sheets.
Sirius’ holds Draco’s gaze.
“I got a drink, not a bloody house.” Harry passes the Sprite to Draco - he chugs down a mouthful almost mechanically, grimacing slightly at the fizz. He blinks up at him - Draco looks exhausted, eyes drooping and fluttering shut. Harry studies his eyelashes - he remembers the feel of them against his skin. “Don’t sleep,” he says, softly. “Draco? Don’t go to sleep.”
“They’re all I know,” Draco says, softly. He takes a deep breath, shoulders shuddering, back still ramrod straight. “Who else can I compare them to?”
“Don’t worry about it,” Harry says, and his voice is almost light enough that he believes it.
Draco laughs, the sound hollow. “It’s fine. I’ve already withdrawn enough funds that we’ll be okay. My father is an asshole. I just wish…”
The window’s down. Harry takes a deep breath. His lungs fill with dry air and smoke. If he holds his hand out he can feel the wind pushing against his palm.
The inside of the car is hot and thick when they finally pull out onto the road. The radio’s back on again, something that neither of them really listen to as Draco flicks the turn signal and spins the car out onto the asphalt.
Draco stretches out, hands above him in a loose rendition of a streamline, long lines of his body pulled out. “I don’t know. Maybe I give meaning to things that don’t deserve it.”
“Good,” he says, and the closing of the car door feels like a fissure line.
The room smells of shampoo when he gets back. Draco’s on the bed - he’s just in his sweatpants, his hair damp and flat against his head. He leaps off to help Harry with the bags. Harry can hear the sound of cars through the thin windows at the back, the beginning of rain against the roof.
“Maybe you’re just stupid,” Harry says and Draco lets out a long laugh.
Draco looks at him then, near-incredulous. “You think I’m worried about the jam?”
Draco grumbles something incomprehensible. Harry laughs.
He wasn’t sure what he wanted to do - march over to Draco’s front door, yell the street down? The windows were all dark; Harry found himself scanning them, looking for just the slightest hint that Draco was coming, that he was ready to leave.
Harry lifts his head then; Draco’s face is turned away from him, hidden in the soft blur of shadows. “Sorry?”
“Six,” Draco says. “We were twelve.”
“It’s been two weeks,” Draco says. Harry turns to look at him; Draco has his head nearly tipped back, the vulnerable curve of his neck exposed to the sky. “Two weeks since we left.”
Draco exhales, slightly unsteadily. “I don’t - you’d come back though, right? For holidays?”
Harry lets out a long breath. It’s the first thing Draco’s said in almost two hours, since leaving the field this morning. “We’re near the city. Rush hour traffic, maybe.”
“What do you want?” Draco says, keeping his voice even. “I assume you don’t just want to chat.”
Fuck.
Night had fallen by the time they get to the motel. It’s too late to bother trying to get food - they mutually agree to another round of instant noodles. Harry can practically taste the salt and msg on his lips as they head up the dusty stairs, the carpet sticking to the bottom of their feet.
It’s the clamour of the crowd around them, the water that dripped down Harry’s back. The feeling of Draco’s arm around Harry’s shoulders, still wet from his swim. “Warm down with me?”
“Thanks,” he says, and his voice is rough, catching at the end.
“Move,” Harry grumbles, unceremoniously shoving Draco off the counter. “Why are you even up so early? It’s not like we have practice or anything.”
“I’ll race you,” he says, suddenly. Harry swallows - his mouth tastes like ocean salt.
“What do you mean?” Draco demands.
Harry squints up at the sky. “Ages. The highway’s fucking empty.”
he’d said, and Draco had only smiled.
“I hate you,” Draco retorts. There’s no heat behind his words, nothing beyond the catch in his throat, the rawness of sleep.
This is how it started.
,” he spits, with surprising vehemence. “In the middle of fucking nowhere too.”
Draco barely hears Hermione’s cutting reply. He’s too focused on Harry, the thin set of his shoulders, the matted strands of hair plastered to his skin. One hand’s still wrapped around Draco’s wand, the fingers bloodied and scorched. Draco sinks to his knees in an instant, reaching out for Harry.
“He loves you,” Draco says quietly. “He adores you.”
Gears. Colours. Draco’s face, distorted by shadow and the flash of lights, warped by the lines of coloured foam and soap.
He lines himself up at the edge, toes curled around the rim. Draco’s spinning around underwater; he comes for Harry with a devilish look that Harry can see even from up here. When he wraps cold fingers around Harry’s ankle Harry doesn’t protest; he lets himself be dragged into the pool.
“Did he tell you about how much of a manipulative, lying bastard I was?”
Harry bites his lip, hard enough that he tastes blood. “We’ll be fine. I’m sure it’s just rush hour. It’ll clear up in the next hour or so. Don’t worry.”
“Are you sure - “
Harry smiles. He pokes through the array of colourful cardboard cylinders. Draco didn’t like the chicken flavored ones - he had mentioned it to Harry off-handedly once, hated the way it seemed to taste so much more artificial than the others.
He takes a deep breath. The car moves forward, the air thick and syrupy, a headache in corporal form.
“Am not,” Harry scowls. He finds the milk in the fridge, adding copious amounts to his coffee. “Where’s the spoons?”
“You still won.”
, he told himself, the cold concrete digging into his
Harry feels his stomach sink. It’s an odd echoing feeling, a stone dropped down a well, shot through with the bitter taste of guilt. His mouth tastes like salt and metal. “No. I don’t.”
Draco, mercifully, doesn’t seem to notice. He’s too preoccupied with tearing open the cardboard; the hamburger is left in the box scornfully, the orange juice half-drained with one gulp. He pulls out the little plastic bag of apple slices and glares at Harry. “You couldn’t have gotten me more fries?”
“What do you mean?”
“Don’t talk about my parents,” Draco warns. Plastic cracks under his hands, knuckles bone white and tense. “If you saw what they were like when they fought - “
The hum of the mini fridge makes him want to scream.
“Shit,” he mutters, scrambling to sit up. “Draco, it’s almost seven.”
you!”
instead.”
The night dwindles to silence, the sun moving from brilliant scarlet to darkness. Harry watches the stars blink into existence - there’s no meteor shower but he still thinks they look beautiful. He finds Draco’s stars almost instantly.
“True,” Draco muses thoughtfully. “But I ended up breaking 37 after all.”
“We agreed,” Draco murmurs, and his voice is low and deadly. “We agreed that we were friends.
“How did you know?” Draco breathes. “That it was love?”
He closes his eyes and lets himself sink.
Draco froze. Harry could feel it, the tension bleeding into his body, the way the light died from his eyes. “Take your hand off,” he hissed, and Harry wrenched his arm away. Ron and Blaise had long since disappeared into the crowd - it was just the two of them, Draco’s fear leaching out into the air.
“Yeah,” he said, almost casually. “What are they going to do? Stop me?”
Looking at Draco was the heady mix of adrenaline, the tension in his muscles before a race. Whispered provocations -
“What the fuck happened?”
He forces himself to get into bed. It’s warm - Draco must have just rolled over. There’s only two pillows - they usually slept with pillows stacked in the middle, leftover habits from swim meets. Draco’s already using one though; Harry grits his teeth and flips over on his side, rolls right to the very edge and puts as much space between their bodies as possible.
He knows Draco’s truly exhausted when he pulls over to the side of the road without complaining. They wait there for a few moments; Draco’s bent over the steering wheel, head buried into the crook of his arms. Harry stares at the slope of his shoulder and swallows hard.
Draco smiles then. It’s one of his real smiles; one corner of his lips tilted up, a crooked line across his face. “Scared, Potter?”
Harry just shakes his head. He leans his head back on the roof of the car, the sun cooking his skin, burning his body. For a moment he thinks of last night, the two of them curled up on the hood of the car, Draco’s head on Harry’s shoulder. It’s burned into his memory - the curve of Draco’s neck, the brush of his hair against Harry’s cheek and the flutter of his eyelashes against Harry’s neck.
He looks radiant. He always looked radiant but it’s the first time that Harry could tell him so, could wrap his hand around the coin and tug Draco closer, pull him into the water and press him against the side. Draco smiles underneath Harry’s lips, fingers curling into his hair and between them Harry closes his fingers around the coin in his palm, holds the memory of Draco’s wish in his hand.
The day Draco bought the flat, they’d both cried. 2 boys fresh out of 8th year, living together in a desperate attempt to escape the nightmares and now 1 year later Harry knew it was the best choice he had ever made. It was
Harry closes his eyes, tries to imagine hating his parents like that, with a burning intensity of a thousand flames. He can’t though, can’t conjure up anything besides screaming and pain and flashes of green. “I’m sorry,” he says. “I don’t know what to say.”
, in their apartment in Diagon Alley, all old windows and exposed brick.
, Harry wanted to say, if it wasn’t for the slight motion that Draco made beside him, the barest flinch away from his father. He swallowed down his sarcasm, settled for a half-hearted “Nice to meet you, sir.”
“Well,” Draco says, a sly grin spreading across his face. “I’m sure I could wake you up by - “
“I’m good,” Harry says. The air-con never worked anyway, only scorching heat from plastic vents. The sky melts into shades of orange all around him. He props his hand on the window, twists his feet so they’re positioned under his legs. “Sprite?”
“Damn, I really thought I had him there,” the stranger chuckled as he pulled his softening dick out of Harry’s arse, holding the condom in place. He tied off the condom before holding it up for Draco to see. “Shit, that was a huge load. Thanks for the ride.” He gave Harry a slap on one arse cheek and winked at Draco before climbing off the bed and dropping the used condom in the porcelain bowl. “I sure hope I see you guys around again. I’d love another go at him sometime.”
Harry ran his hand down the outside of the other man’s thigh before slipping it up between the closed legs, casting a wandless lubrication spell. Shifting closer, Harry slipped his cock through the thick pads of flesh, enjoying the filthy squelching sounds as his thrusts sped up. Harry’s thick fingers dug into the hipbone as his cock slipped in and out between the other man’s legs.
“Perhaps,” Draco replied noncommittally, not liking the thought of that. Harry being used by anonymous strangers while he watched was one thing, but he felt a flare of jealousy at the idea of someone regularly insinuating themselves in his and Harry’s sex life.
“Yes, I realise that, but—”
All the air seemed to be sucked out of the room as every head but one turned towards the far end of the table. Harry tried as hard as he could to maintain his confident facade as Severus Snape stared down his hook-nose at him. The silence stretched for what felt like an interminable amount of time, but Harry refused to back down from the man’s icy glare.
, Harry replied, all hissed words and cold fury.
“Harry.” There’s the sound of scuffling, and then Draco’s hands are on Harry’s chest, shaking him back and forth. He yelps - Draco’s hands are ice-cold, pressing into his skin.
Harry glances at the clock on the dashboard, then up at the sky. “We won’t be able to make it to a motel if we do.”
, breathless from the race, hoarse from the water, how Harry could hear his smile in the catch at the end -
“Coach is already shuddering at your diet.”
He gets out of bed slowly, wincing at the bright lights. There’s a mess of clothing dumped on one of the chairs; he grabs something at random (Draco’s - only he would bother to buy a sweater this nice) and pulls it on, padding into the kitchen.
“Fuck,” he says; Harry’s eyes are still distant, lost in that soft world of shock. “Harry. Harry, it’s me.”
Harry breathes in. Breathes out. Squeezes Draco’s hand, pressed his lips to Draco’s cheek.
“Yeah, sure. But who had to listen to you bitch about your sore shoulders for the entire day after that?”
“Doesn’t everyone? Everyone who knows about Death Eaters, that is.”
Harry’s voice drops to a whisper. “That’s fair. No point hoping for something that could never happen.”
“What do you think?” Draco replies steadily.
They roll the windows down. Tiny bits of wind slip into the car, cool kisses against his skin. Harry takes a bite of his ice cream, lets the cold numb his tongue and burn against the back of his throat.
“Ramen,” Draco says, and the corner of his mouth quirks up. “I’m getting flashbacks.”
Draco had told him in the gas station. He’d run and run and run after Draco and he’d still never reach him.
“I don’t know what you want,” Harry says quietly, and he watches Draco flinch back. “And I don’t think you know either.”
The bottle is cold against Harry’s hand when Draco passes it over. Draco’s index skims over the rise of Harry’s knuckles, the barest brush of movement and yet Harry swears he feels his hand burn. “Thanks.”
“When you use it enough it does.”
gum?”
he had spat, anger making him feel like he was on fire.
The sound of rain against the windscreen wakes him. Harry groans, pushing himself up with shaking hands. Water collects on the roof, spilling over the glass in translucent threads, a river of shifting colours and lines. His neck aches, from whatever fucked-up position he fell asleep in - he had a bad habit of sleeping curled up, legs tucked up and spine bent over his knees. The seat next to him is empty. Harry frowns - he almost always woke before Draco did.
“Oops.”
The tug of cord around Draco’s neck. The rasp of the wind outside the windows. Harry digs his thumb into the edge of the coin, doesn’t miss the hitch in Draco’s breathing as he lets go.
He’s still not touching Draco, though he can feel the heat of his body against his skin. Draco’s head is bowed, arms braced on the wall beside him. “Tell me to stop.”
Harry shudders. “Oh please no,” he says, dropping the stack of mail onto the coffee table with a groan. “That was one time!
“Took you long enough,” Draco replies drily. Harry watches as he knocks back the dregs of his iced tea, replaces it back in the cup holder.
But Harry thinks of chlorine and car rides and metal school buses. Team dinners and parties. Lining up on the edge of the pool, toes dipping into the water, heart in his throat as he stared at Lane Four during finals for 400 freestyle.
Harry blinks, disorientated. He’s curled up in the front seat, hood pulled over his head, shoes off and legs twisted to the side. There’s soft music playing through one earbud - the other must have fallen out, the cord tangled around his neck. His phone blinks up at him when he shifts.
“Wake up.” Draco’s voice is low and gravely. He had obviously just woken up.
Harry thinks about it - the way the whole car lit up in shades of orange and pink and gold, the darkness that only came with empty highways and ghost towns. Draco, asleep in the seat next to him, all smoothed lines and silver.
They float on their backs for a bit. “I don’t even know what to do,” Draco says and Harry chuckles - it’s strange not having a set on the board, not having to constantly reach for fins or a kick board. The water leeches the heat from Harry’s skin. He shivers and Draco looks over at him, flicks his eyes up and down then looks away.
“Get out,” Ron says. His voice is thick with grief, eyes gleaming with tears of pain and tears of rage. “No one wants you here. Get
Harry laughed.
“Goodnight,” he whispers, to the silent room.
Draco grins, unconcerned. He kicks his legs idly, a vague suggestion of breaststroke. Harry watches the ripples spread over the water, spiralling out to the concrete walls. “Are you getting in?”
The road stretches out in front of them. There’s another car up ahead - they’re going much too slow for such an open road. Harry steps on the accelerator, watches the meter tick up in steady increments.
It was after their relay - 200 medley, Draco on back, Ron on breast, Blaise on fly and Harry on freestyle. They had won - by almost a full body length Harry remembered, setting the meet record for the event. He remembers standing on the blocks, all four of them crammed onto the first place podium, arms around each other as the medals were draped around their necks.
“It’s fire,” Sirius says quietly.
The sound of Draco’s steady breaths grounds him. Harry chances a look - he’s got the blankets pulled over and around him. The faintest strip of light falls across his face, a strip of the moon against the curve of Draco’s cheekbone. He watches the flutter of Draco’s hair, the steady pulse at his throat and Harry wants to press his lips against it.
“Let's go on a trip,” Draco said, and sometimes Harry thinks he’ll never forget the smooth roll of his voice.
He takes a deep breath. The car feels looser now, more open. He slides Draco’s phone into the cup holder and stares out the window. “Good to go?”
, chewing down on the soft pretzel.
“I’m good.” The gas station is empty around them, all flickering lights and peeling paint. Harry breathes in, ignores the burn of gasoline fumes against his nose. “Are you getting anything?”
“Thank god,” Draco mutters; he’s off the hood in an instant, heading over to the open window. “Yes please! Our car broke down and - “
Harry slowly raises the mug to his lips. “Fuck you,” he says and chugs the whole thing. Halfway through he regrets it - it’s burning hot and excruciatingly salty, like drinking warm ocean water. He never could turn down a dare though, draining the cup to the dregs.
“Should have drank the Sprite.”
He cuts the engine outside of Draco’s house. The windows are dark enough that he can just make out the watery image of the car reflected back at him in the glass. Draco shifts in his seat, one hand going to the strap of his bag. His hands tighten, hard enough that the knuckles go white, the skin going pale around the carved indents in his palm.
He tidies up the room a bit - pushes suitcases against the wall, sits down cross-legged on the floor and sorts the piles of laundry into their bags. It’s all practically the same stuff - sweatpants, hoodies, socks. He holds up a sweatshirt, faded grey and blotchy, the colour partially bleached out around the neckline. He wasn’t sure if it was his or Draco’s.
Draco shakes his head. “They don’t deserve it. My father doesn’t, at least. He doesn’t deserve my pity.”
If he closes his eyes he can almost imagine it. Suitcases in the back, windows halfway rolled down. An endless expanse of asphalt, stretching out into the distance.
Draco watches the other car, the blur between being close enough to touch and then fading into the distance. “Do you ever think about people?” he says, suddenly.
“They’re your parents, Draco,” he whispers. “They raised you. You’re allowed to miss them.”
“What the fuck,” he mutters, his voice cracking slightly at the end. “What the actual fuck.”
Harry thinks, and he wonders what constellations he’ll find.
It sounds like a secret. It feels like a confession.
Back in the car Draco sits like he always does; legs pulled to his chest, hood pulled over his hair, head propped up against the window. The street lamps lay long lines of light across his face - a slender strip sliding from the dashboard to Draco’s cheek and down onto the console between them. His hands lie perfectly still on top of his knees, twisted like the crumpled wings of some long-dead moth.
Harry scowls, examining the parchment in his hand. “How do they keep finding us?”
“There’s a pool,” Draco whispers. Lights from the far away buildings illuminate the room enough that Harry could just make out his face, a bare suggestion of eyes and a nose and lips. “We could go.”
The leather of the steering wheel is sticky against Harry’s hand. It’s one of those days, the air sluggish and warm, everything golden and burnt umber. Draco’s pulled his hoodie up behind him, a makeshift pillow to lean back on as he stares blankly out of the windscreen.
at the thought of Draco being forgotten.
Draco’s fingers are still in his hair, impossibly soft against his scalp. Harry closes his eyes.
“Are you alright?”
Harry doesn’t bother to reply. He stares up at the sky - there’s not a single cloud to be seen, nothing to pray to in hopes of covering the sun. The light makes him dizzy, heat waves radiating off the asphalt and the dry grass around him. “We’re fucked. Gas station was at least an hour back.”
The man throws back his head and laughs; bitter and amused. “Oh I don’t know, do I? I probably know better then anyone else here, I Draco.”
to be without him, after so many days together.
Except it wasn’t. Except all Harry could see was his time slipping away, sand falling through splayed fingers, a candle burning down to nothing. Harry opened his mouth and drank as much of everything as he could, tried to convince himself that he was finished, he was done and yet he still wanted more. He always wanted more.
Harry rolls his eyes. He tilts his head down, watches the waves. There’s a glint of something half-buried in the sand that catches his eye - he bends down, thumbing through the rocks until he pulls out a piece of sea glass. It’s light blue, like the colour of Draco’s hoodie, the edges smoothed and worn down by time.
“Don’t tell me you’d come back for your parents.”
The metal of the car under his thighs. The whisper of Draco’s breath against his neck. The sun, yet another day slipping through Harry’s fingers, another day that he’d never get back. Another day that he’d look back on later, with all the bitterness of longing, wish with all his heart that he could turn back time.
Draco let’s Harry shower first - he’s taken his collection down from the car, tumbled spools of thread onto the bed sheets. Harry leaves him there and heads into the bathroom - everything seems oddly yellowed and he scowls at himself in the mirror. He looks different somehow, though he can’t quite figure out what it is.
His footsteps echo oddly, the only sound the hum of the generators, faint voices from the few employees left in the building. Harry grabs a handful of chip bags, a random assortment of chocolate bars and some cans of iced tea. Draco hated coffee; Harry’s always teased him about that, muttered things like
“Hey,” Harry says, his voice sounding dry and burnt-out. “Morning.”
He thinks of Draco then. Draco, with all his fire and his light, the way he burnt up from the inside. The small things - his hatred of coffee, his love of noodles. The tiny pieces that made up a person, that made someone real and not a story. The pieces that were so easily left behind, as insubstantial as the ghost of a woman left behind in clay.
“Can you come get me?” he had asked.
“I don’t know why I care so much. Why it hurts.”
Everything passes in a blur; jumper cables, batteries. Harry wrenches the ignition as far as it would go until the engine spluttered and roared to life. The rush of air-con, the click of seatbelts, Draco sliding into the driver's seat. He leans over; Harry shoots him a curious look and Draco smiles as he flicks the radio on. He hands his phone to Harry - “Play something?”
“Do you
“Let's do it.”
“I’m not an idiot,” Harry grumbles as he pours himself a huge cup. Draco had an unusual talent for making incredible coffee, despite not knowing how to use a french press about 6 months ago. “I defeated Voldemort, right? That’s got to count for something.”
“Don’t what me. My mother was the one hurting me. I know those marks.”
Draco laughs, his breath warm against Harry’s skin. The air con whirls above then, white noise and static. “How long did you…”
“What do you know?” Draco fires back. “Don’t pretend like you know anything about Pure Blood families. You don’t know what it’s like to be suffocated, to be forced into a mold that doesn’t fit you - “
Draco’s twisted over in his seat, his back against the car door and legs pulled up sideways. Harry mirrors him so they’re facing each other. He’s so, so careful not to let their legs touch.
“Just stay to the right then. There and back. It’s a bloody 25.”
The words make his throat catch. Harry swallows, hard, closes his eyes and stares at the shifting tangle of colours that fill the space behind his eyelids. He thinks about the colour of Draco’s hair in the sunlight, backlit by the rising sun, the way his eyes shone on that rooftop barely a month ago. Seeing him in the morning, the lights from the pool near-blinding, sweatpants puddled around his feet. The last travel meet they had, on the ferry ride back home, ocean spray and starlight and the freezing bite of the wind against his face.
“How do I know this is real?” Harry whispers. He gestures, at the room, the ceiling, the shattered windows and cracked floor. “How do I know any of this is real, that it isn’t
He forces himself to open his eyes - the world rushes in, white light and flames. He has to look down at his legs, blink the spots from his vision before he finally can look over at Draco.
The bottle is practically empty, a small pool of liquid where Harry tilted the plastic towards him. Draco had stopped at a gas station nearly two hours ago - the bottle is the only thing left now, along with a handful of crumpled silvery wrappers.
Draco has the noodles done by the time Harry emerges. It sits on the desk, steam rising into the air; Draco’s perched on the bed, balancing the cup on the ball of his knee.
He stretches his legs out - the windows are down, the air just cool enough that they don’t bother turning on the air-con.
They pull up at a market - it’s a tourist attraction, apparently, all crowded stalls and lights strung up above vendors. Harry can barely hear himself over the din - food cooking, people yelling, the sound of the water against the docks. Draco by his side as always, a reassuring weight against the ebb and flow of the noise.
“What,” Draco grumbles, his face half-mashed into his arms. Then; “Oh. Shit, sorry. Do you not want me to…”
They make the drive in silence. Harry glances over every few minutes, slides his gaze across the smooth surface of the mirror. Draco never meets his eyes.
“I was thinking,” he says, his voice too-casual, too smooth. “There’s two types of people, right? People who fight like hell to get something and people who fight like hell to keep it.”
He once read a story, somewhere, about a girl whose soul was ripped in two. How she kept one half of it but gave the other to her lover, and for as long as she lived she was protected not only by herself but by the one she loved as well. He wonders if that’s how life worked - little pieces given to other people, secrets spread out all over the world. He wonders if that’s how he’ll be remembered, in pieces, never to be whole again.
Harry swallows, hard. Shit, he thinks. Draco’s eyes are full of challenge, that streak of competitiveness that made him fall in love in the first place.
Harry grumbles something in reply. He’s too sore from Quidditch practice to move and the bed is deliciously soft, the heat from Draco’s body making the sheets toasty and warm. “I’m not moving.”
“For your collection,” he says, and he drops the glass into Draco’s open palm, tries to ignore the light brush of Draco’s fingertips on the back of his hand. “Maybe you can make something with it.”
. “Please.”
Draco laughs. “I liked single arm.”
Draco shrugs. Harry doesn’t watch the rise and fall of his shoulders. “You took me for a drive, remember? Downtown?”
“Wanted?”
Harry thinks. The light’s almost gone - he can only make out the faintest suggestions of Draco - the hint of his jaw, the thin lines of his lashes. It’s only the burning press of his body that reminds Harry that he was real.
“You have the fucked-up Death Eater guy.”
Harry holds a hand out, at the swirl of colours inside Draco’s cup. “M&M Mcflurries are shit. It looks like a rainbow threw up in your ice cream.”
“Why wouldn’t I?”
Harry’s brows drew together as he contemplated what she was saying. “Maybe it’s just a blip, or something?”
tie-in campaign had been a rousing success so far. Sales of kale had gone up over 200% in the last three months and the British Kale Growers Association was thrilled. Harry and Hermione had been lauded by the partners of their agency and there were even whispers that their campaign might be nominated for an award next year.
The man chuckled and shrugged. “Whatever floats your boat, mate.”
“Fine by me. If I never speak a single word to you again, I’ll die the happiest man alive.”
“You’re Lettice Green?” Harry asked.
“SHOTS! SHOTS! SHOTS! SHOTS!”
Draco let out a small chuckle. “Did she get arrested?”
Harry didn’t understand what was happening as he was pulled down the bar a bit to where the other members of the hen night were standing, encircling the woman that Harry deduced must be the bride—the white satin sash that had “The Bride” written across it in a curling golden cursive was kind of a dead giveaway.
“Yes, well, as the man of honour, it’s my obligation to help organise the hen night,” Draco explained.
“Great. That doesn’t make this even more awkward,” Harry muttered.
“Deal,” Harry practically growled at the man. Now that they’d agreed on a price, the man slid off his stool, bringing their bodies together, the warm breath of the taller man washing over Harry’s face with the proximity. Looking pleased with himself, the escort reached back and pulled out an expensive-looking black leather wallet. He made sure to let Harry see the thick pile of bills inside as the man pulled out enough bills to include an exceedingly generous tip and set them on the bar before walking away, leaving Harry to follow after him.
Draco smiles, distantly. His eyes are the exact colour of the sky. “What did you think,” he asks, abruptly, “when you first met me?”
“Do you think you’ll ever fall in love?” he asks, suddenly.
“God,” he says, giving him a small smirk. It’s the grin of a younger man, the ghost of something that had long died. “You remind me so much of - “
“Make it better?”
“You’ve exhausted your white boy jokes for today,” he mutters tiredly. He’s in sweatpants and an old swimming shirt, the material thin enough that Harry can just make out the edges of his ribs through the cloth.
He still didn’t know what happened, exactly. Maybe he was too loud, too animated. Maybe he took too long to lift his hand from where it curved around Draco’s side.
He looks at Draco and he thinks that drowning felt like falling in love. It’s the same - heartbeats and choking and the twist of his stomach. The desperate spin of the world around him, an unmoored boat on rocky waves. Harry’s fingers dig into the carpet, nails buried deep into the scratch fibers.
The seat is warm when he slides in, when he pulls the lever under the seat and slides closer to the brakes. Draco’s half asleep when Harry finally cuts the lights on.
“Don’t,” Draco says, cutting him off. “Don’t say that I remind you of my father. Do you know how many times I’ve heard that? As if I wanted to be some egotistical fanatic - “
They finally pull up to a McDonalds. The air is still impossibly hot and sticky - they both wince at the metal of their car, parked under the blazing sun and Harry knows it’s going to burn like hell when they finally go back.
Somehow the view outside the window looks more depressing in the morning light. Harry wrenches the curtains open; the grey concrete and rusted cars are flat and washed out, nothing more than paper cutouts.
He can barely see through the haze of smoke.
“I’m doing laundry,” Harry says. He plucks at Draco’s hoodie with one hand; Draco scowls petulantly. “We haven’t done it for at least a week.”
Finally, Sirius speaks. “I was in love with a boy,” he says, and Draco flinches. “For ages, actually. Since I was 12. He was my best friend.”
. You get all the admirers. No one has ever sent me a condom before.”
He still remembers the shock of cold over his body, quickly ignored as he focused on Draco up ahead. Draco was a distance swimmer, all steady strokes and smooth pulls. He always thrashed Harry in anything over a 200.
Draco laughs, though the noise is cut short by the sound of soap and water against the roof. Harry can actually see the dirt slipping off the glass, streaks of grey and brown and black. He tries not to think of Draco, body pressed against the hood of the car.
!” Draco calls out as Harry shoves his way into the kitchen, slamming an empty mug onto the counter. Ron had gotten it for him as an 18th birthday present - one of those tacky souvenir ones that seemed to have sprouted up everywhere after the war.
But they’re too close now; in the dark, the pulsing glow of the lights. Draco’s hand sprayed out on the console, fingers inches away from the curve of Harry’s knee. The light slides off the arc of Draco’s neck, lights his skin up in soft shades of green.
“How could I?” Harry says, and it’s all sunrises and music and the light in Draco’s eyes. “You’re here with me, aren’t you?”
back at home.”
of the car settling around them. The hiss of exhaled breaths. Harry closes his eyes and thinks of silence before the gunshot, before the air exploded into motion and the water rushed up to meet him.
“Don’t,” Draco says, his voice impossibly calm. “Don’t try and pin this on me.”
Harry looks at his fingers and he
The bed dips when he turns around, blankets tangled around his feet, pillow half-hanging off the end of the mattress. For a moment he’s blind, fingers reaching wildly, searching unthinkingly for the body next to him. He snatches his arm away before he touches skin.
The barest twitch of Draco’s lips. The way his breathing hitched when Harry closed his fingers around the coin, pressed it so hard into his palm that he thought it might be branded there forever.
Draco had a habit of collecting things - coins and rocks and shells from different places. They’re all strung up on the handlebars in the back, bits of fishing line and driftwood, a floating collection of all the memories Draco had thought to capture.
“That’s ‘cause it was
“You had your eyes closed, how do you know you were ahead of me?”
Draco’s face darkened. “And you know what I’ve always said. Fuck my parents. I don’t care if I get disowned.”
There’s the weight of something being draped around him - Draco had found one of their blankets. He wraps it around the two of them, traps the heat from the car in between their two bodies. It pulls them impossibly closer; Harry’s shoulder an unbroken line with Draco’s.
Harry laughs over the tightness in his throat. “There would’ve been a bonfire too. One of those huge ones.” “And the music - oh my god the music would have either been so ridiculously cheesy or incredible. And the camera would have been perfectly positioned behind us so we were silhouetted against the sky.”
“Apparently not,” Draco says, “Seeing as you just put salt in your coffee.”
Ron’s face is a mask of grief. “Sorry doesn’t bring my brother back.”
He tears his gaze away - a truck slows in front of them, the window rolling down. A man pokes his head out, scruffy beard and a bandana. “You kids need help?”
Harry doesn’t say anything else.
“Oh he wants to see me naked,” Draco drawls, but he strips the hoodie off anyways. Harry stares at him - he’s in an oversized shirt, the kind they used to buy to easily slip over wet bodies. It hangs oddly on him - tight on the shoulders, loose everywhere else, riding up Draco’s rib cage where he twists to chuck the fabric into the back. If he closes his eyes Harry can picture him, all lean muscle and long lines, the arc of his spine as it melded into his shoulder blades.
Draco hums. He kicks his feet out in front of him idly. “True. It’s a load of bullshit anyways. Hidden mysteries my ass.”
They watch as the wind pulls the waves higher, tips their edges with crests of white foam. The sun slowly disappears underneath the ocean, trailing streaks of colours across the sky. The stars bloom into existence, a thousand blossoms of white and silver.
“Goodnight, Harry,” Draco whispers. His voice sounds oddly muffled, as if he had covered his face with the blanket.
Draco shrugs. There’s a small flash of white by his feet, the curve of a seashell. He picks it up in one smooth motion, slipping it into the pocket of his hoodie. “Can't be colder than morning practice.”
“You’ve changed, Granger,” Pansy says, as Draco starts forward. “You’re almost as cold hearted as I am.”
The click of the turn signal. The colours of the sky. The hum of the radio, near forgotten in the heat, forlorn notes and drifting voices.
Sirius fixes him with that piercing gaze, the one that saw into his soul and stripped him bare. “Jesus, you’re young. I fought in the first War, back when I was 19. I still have nightmares. To do that to innocent kids - I don’t - you’re so - “
He can visibly see Draco swallow, the soft flex of his throat, the way he raked fingers through his hair and turned away. “Wear it. You can give it back later.”
“I wish,” Draco says casually, “That I could do something for my mother. That I could get her out somehow, reduce her sentence.”
He thinks he lets his head drop. He thinks he feels Draco’s hands on him, soft against his skin. He thinks he hears Draco whisper something to him, lost within his enveloping dreams.
, Draco wrote back. Harry stared at the words for a moment, everything that it symbolized, everything he couldn’t have.
starts at 5!”
Harry remembers that ride - the dry air of the plane, the rain that froze to ice on the windows. The team had seats right at the back of the aisle, still in team hoodies and wet hair. He remembers Draco watching him, silent and hesitant, eyes luminous in the dying light. “I remember.”
The minute Draco says “Go,” Harry dives. The pool is shallow enough that he nearly scrapes his nose on the floor, the bottom rushing up at him in a flurry of bubbles and white concrete. The water seems to slip from his hands - two weeks without training made his shoulders and lungs burn. He can feel Draco beside him - the lack of a lane rope meant that they were so much closer than normal, close enough that his hand brushed Draco’s ribs when he took a stroke. Everything’s blurry - neither of them have goggles, nothing beyond vague and foggy shapes but Harry can still make out Draco’s hair, a golden cloud around them.
“Hand me the detergent?” Draco says, and he snatches the plastic bag from Harry’s hand. It’s funny, Harry thinks - Draco’s always had such a distinct scent to him. It was gone now, ever since they started this road trip, ever since Harry’s clothes and Draco’s smelled exactly the same.
“What’s wrong with it?”
was stamped on one side, along with a lipstick mark that did not resemble Harry’s lips at all.
“Harry?” Draco asks, then shakes his head. “I’m driving.”
“No,” Harry says, “I don’t. Why would you? Why would you try to keep this, this - whatever this is. Friendship? Relationship? Why would you bother? Why would you try?”
“You said that you’d rather chew off your own foot then do that again.”
He stared at his hands, palms up, the light dancing off his fingertips. “I’ve tortured people and been tortured myself. Spying is nothing.”
Harry stares - broken pots, distorted shadows, the curve of Draco’s mouth. “I’d rather be remembered by people, I think. Maybe that’s how you survive. Little pieces of you carried by someone else.”
“And your father?”
- their home, their life and no one, not even Voldemort could take that away from them.
He doesn’t know how long it’s been - an hour, a day, a year - but slowly Harry’s breath becomes easier, his breaths clearing until finally Draco loosened his grip and Harry opened his eyes.
under his breath. He takes a minute to toss in a couple of bags of candy and adds in a few more cans of soda before heading out of the snack aisle.
He reaches for his hoodie, sleeves tied around his waist to prevent his ass from burning. There’s dust all over the top of the car, dead insects and dirt. He draws a shape, a meaningless squiggle and wishes for rain.
“God, it’s more then that. It’s consuming. It scares me, because I’m in a war, and if something happened to him…There’s nothing I wouldn’t do - I’ve switched sides for God’s sake. I’ve damned my soul because of him, I love him that much.”
Draco turns away, willing the tears not to come. “Oh, really?”
It hadn’t felt like it, on the roof, drunk on memories. It hadn’t felt like any time at all.
Panic is a cold, sick spread in his stomach. Harry takes a deep breath and tries to remember how to breathe. He watches the lights smear together in the rain. “Why?”
Draco throws his head back and laughs. “
“You don’t find it fascinating?” Draco’s hands splay out on the glass, casting an elongated shadow against the display. “One day, when we’re all dead, maybe whenever inherits this Earth will remember you. Maybe you’ll be another boy in a photo, remembered only because that’s all they could find of humanity.”
The water comes back again, blasting the world back into focus. Harry hears the beeping noise that signaled for movement, the roar of the dryers turning on. He edges the car forward without thinking. The water droplets scuttle up the windscreen and disappear over the curve of the roof.
Harry’s mouth tastes like blood. He prods the torn skin with his tongue, marks from where he’s bitten down too hard on his lip. “No shit.”
Harry’s never really liked museums. They’ve always reminded him of mausoleums, that odd space between dead and alive. He remembers going to one once, seeing the half-rotten cloth of a doll from Ancient Rome, the sudden coldness that washed over his body as he realized that
“That’s because you
“I didn’t know,” Harry gets out, over the echoes of rain in his head. “I - I thought - “
Sirius smiles. “I was actually going to say, before you interrupted me earlier that you remind me a lot of myself. Back when I was younger. You have the same…complete disregard for yourself. Self-destructive tendencies, almost. Because who cares if you burn as long as you’re warming those you love?”
“You promise,” Harry says, lips moving against Draco’s. “You promise this is real?”
“Let's go swimming.”
“I’ll put our bags in the car,” he mumbles, and Draco doesn’t look back as he tugs the bathroom door shut behind him.
They stood like that for a bit. Harry dimly noticed the way the world seemed to go silent, everything narrowing down to the father and son in front of him.
“Who else would it be for?” Draco counters, pulling the tray before him.
Draco grins.
Draco folds his arms across his chest. “I’m a Malfoy,” he says. “Your name was synonymous with
Sirius shrugs. “Harry. You had a fight with him.”
Draco stiffens. “Who told you that?”
Despite everything, Draco’s voice is still remarkably steady as he replies, “My parents.”
Draco stares down at Sirius’ hands, the tiny scars that flecked his skin. “What are those?”
“Oh,” he groans, the bed like heaven on his sore body. “I am so, so gay.”
“That is the most horrible description of ice cream that I’ve ever heard,” Harry retorts. Draco hands him the spoon back. His face is lit up, all grins and laughter, the light from the sun partially slanted over his face.
Draco pushes himself off the hood - the back of his jacket is covered in dust from the windscreen, smeared over the dark fabric. “I think I want gum after all,” he hums.
“Why don’t you check in with him?”
Their voices fade to background noise, whispers compared to the noise in Harry’s head. Dimly he realizes his phone in his hand - 2:30 pm it reads, and Harry realizes with a jolt that they’ve been out here for more than two hours.
. Even he wasn’t stupid enough to risk that.
“And isn’t it interesting, who shapes your life? ‘Cause there are so many people who touch you. There’s so many people who become part of your history. But there’s only a couple of people who have the power to change it.”
“Just…” Draco trails off. “You could have taken anyone. Why me?”
Something rises up in his chest then, a mash of emotions, a knot in his throat. “What does it matter?” Harry says, his voice hard. “What does any of this matter? It’ll all be over soon anyway.”
“Yeah,” Draco says, and he smiles. “I am.”
Draco leans back. It’s slight, almost imperceptible but to Harry it was miles. He jerks his hand away, the sour taste of bile rising up in his throat.
and then turn around and tell me to stop. You can’t expect me not to - not to - “
Later he had tried to justify it to himself -
He swallows. He could practically feel the tension in the car, mixed in with the heat and underlined with frustration. Everything’s too silent - there’s no music playing, no idle chatter to while away the time. It’s just them - Draco at the wheel, Harry curled at the side, the memories between them like a chasm.
“You didn’t have to wait,” he says.
“It’s three in the morning. Go away.”
Draco’s face has gone white. He’s shock-still in the driver's seat, eyes fixed straight ahead. “You don’t get to be the one to say that.”
They wander idly through the stalls. Draco touches things - a stone knife carved out of obsidian, a glass orb cupped in the palm of his hands. He stops at a jewelry booth - there’s an old lady sitting on a stool behind a wooden table, a blanket spread out under her wares. The sun catches the array of glass jewels and polished metal. Harry lets his gaze slip over sparkling hairpins and gleaming earrings, wondering what Draco could have stopped for.
“They - “ Draco cut himself off almost viciously, the words bleeding out of his throat. “They found something they shouldn’t have.”
, Harry thinks. The car goes silent. Draco’s watching him - he can feel the heavy weight of his gaze.
Harry almost asks, then stops himself. Everything seemed oddly fragile, sheets of too-thin ice spread out over water. He wonders what it would feel like to step forward, put his foot out and fall.
Draco drags his eyes up, steady silver and cold grey. “I wished for something else.”
Harry rolls his eyes. He stuffs a bite of pretzel into his mouth. It’s fluffy, all salt and warm dough.Draco goes and takes his share, tears it up into small pieces and lets the air cool the insides down. “They should have put a warning on the bag. You know how they do that for coffee?”
Draco stops. Spits into the sink, rinses his mouth with water. “You’re still wearing my hoodie,” he says, and Harry wonders if he’d imagined the slight waver in Draco’s voice.
“Sure,” Draco said. His eyes clearly shone
He remembers it exactly - winter training camp, the last session of the day. They had done relays; Draco had started almost a full three seconds ahead of Harry, shooting him a mocking wink just before the dive into the pool. Harry had watched him disappear underwater, all long lines and pale skin and had thought
He can just barely make out Harry’s face, the paleness of his skin, the bleeding cuts on his cheekbone. Draco almost reaches for Harry again then thinks better, instead placing his hand right next to Harry’s, so close he can feel the heat from his skin.
Harry’s face crumples. He tries to pull away but Draco doesn’t let him, keeps him pulled up against Draco’s skin, fingers pressing into the spaces between his bones. “It’s real.”
Harry stares out the windshield, at the line of cars stretching out into the distance and he wants to put his hand through the window. They’ve basically come to a stop - windows cracked down, the distant thump of music playing from a nearby car. Draco wasn’t even bothering to keep his hands on the wheel; he rested his head against one arm, foot inching forward every few minutes. The sun glints against metal and glass, a dizzying array of lights, a pale rendition of the stars.
“Couple blocks down.” He rolls his eyes. “Take a shower dude. I’ll be back in a bit.”
Draco pours. “Yes, but he’s a
“They’ll find our bodies here,” Draco says, in a detached sort of way. “Bones bleached by the sun, flesh torn off by crows.
Harry wakes on the roof of the car, his neck throbbing. The light burns even through his eyelids, a flat glow of red. Opening his eyes is a challenge - everything is too bright and his eyes are too dry. The metal of the car burns underneath his legs; Harry grabs half-heartedly at the blanket around his legs and freezes at the heavy weight of Draco’s head on his shoulder.
Draco laughs. “Please. You’re an idiot.”
“Please?” Draco asks, voice catching slightly. He grins, Cheshire-like, the glint of his teeth and the tilt of his head.
“Yeah,” Harry says, trying to hind the grimace and the lingering taste still in his mouth. “I could drink this all day.”
“I don’t want this to stop,” Harry whispers, into the night air, into the soft darkness and the space between their bodies. “I don’t want to go back.”
Slowly, Draco takes Harry’s hands. He moves them underneath his own shirt, presses them against the skin, right against the scars from Sectumsempta. Harry’s eyes widen at the feeling, the raised lines and deep divots, scars that he had carved onto Draco’s flesh. “Harry. It’s real.”
Draco stops at the gift store briefly. He buys socks, a magnet, a handful of polished stones that glittered in the light. Harry watches him slip them into his pocket - he knows he’ll find them hanging on the mobile next morning. Draco holds one out to him as they head for the car park - it’s a dark orange, almost luminous in the fading light. “Cat’s eye,” he says, and Harry slips the cool stone in between his fingers. He wonders if Draco had taken a chunk from the sun.
“It seems lonely.”
The water is loud. Harry watches it ricochet off the windscreen, turn the world into blank white. He thinks he can feel the car shake under the force, feel the vibrations travel through the metal and against his fingertips.
The shrill sound of Draco’s alarm cuts through the fog in his head. Harry sits bolt upright in the bed, heart pounding: the morning light is thin and watery, leaking in from the cracks in the blinds. He buries his head under the pillow and groans at the noise.
But it was the first time Draco called him, just past midnight, with a shaking, awful voice, the static of rain in the background.
Draco offers him a tiny smile.
“Winter camp three years ago,” he says, and Draco’s face lights up with memory. “I raced you. 50 free.”
He remembers being sixteen, lined up on the edge of the pool deck with the rest of the team. He was still in his racing suit, the waistband digging uncomfortably tight into his skin, hair wet and dripping down his back. He knew he should warm down - knew he would ache like hell tomorrow but he couldn’t drag himself away.
Draco smiles then, a quirk of his lips, something bitter and humorless. “What else can I do?”
“Oh fuck off,” Draco mutters.
“Oh no,” Harry deadpans. “Whatever will he do without a tongue?”
The announcer said something - Harry dimly caught
Hidden behind the darkness of his goggles Harry closed his eyes. He grabbed on to the starting block, fingers tightening around the metal bar they used for backstroke starts, hard enough that he thought he could feel the metal imprinted into his palm.
The rain is heavier now, fogging the windows and turning everything into sheets of grey. Harry glares, grits his teeth and forces himself out of the car, heads down the slope and towards the beach.
They drive for another hour or so. Harry watches the shrubs and the rocks go by, sneaks glances over his shoulder as he does. Draco looks luminous in the light, melting from silver to rose-gold. Harry wonders why he’d never noticed before.
Sirius just shrugs, head propped up against his hand, and Draco thinks again that he looks very, very young. “The only monster made are ones that are in love.”
Silence. Idle motors, distant radios. Draco, washed out with anger and coloured with stress and Harry still couldn’t keep his eyes away.
“I don’t have a clean shirt. We’ll need to do laundry soon - “
his voice sounds wrecked. His hands are cold from the ice cream - he can feel the heat radiating off Draco’s body in pulsing waves.
For a heartbeat, just a heartbeat that old panic comes back, of waking up and finding the other person gone. Harry’s spent too many mornings like that; Draco having slipped away some time before dawn, the bed cold and so, so empty. He clenches his hands, fists slipping on the sheets. It always took awhile for him to calm down, to be reminded that he was
Harry recognizes fleeing when he sees it but he lets Draco go inside without calling it out. The air suddenly seems colder without Draco watching him, his body stretched out on the car. He lets out a long breath, fingers still clenched so tightly he thinks they might cramp.
“I told you,” Draco says, his voice soft. “Ages ago. I told you that all we could ever be was friends.”
“Do you remember when you first got your license?”
“It's funny, isn’t it?” Draco says. Harry looks over; Draco’s watching him, eyes like those chips of gems in the glass cabinet previously. “How people are remembered. You go your whole life hoping you’ll make your mark in some way but who knows? Maybe you’ll be remembered in the curve of a clay pot, in the pages of someone’s diary. Maybe you won’t be remembered at all. The world keeps going and going and one day you stop going with it.”
Harry frowns. “Like, in general?”
“Where?” Harry asked and Draco laughed.
Draco’s always been a deep sleeper - he’d come to morning practices barely conscious, eyes hidden underneath the shadows of his hood. Harry hums to himself, confident that the light would soon wake him and turns his attention to the bags scattered on the ground.
, Harry thinks. He swallows the thought, the taste bitter in his mouth. “And you?”
It started four months ago, before the motels and the rooftop and the toss of hats in the air. It started with wet towels after practice, the hiss of showers and the cut of locker doors slamming shut.
The punch takes him by surprise, a vicious uppercut to the soft bit of his stomach. Draco doubles over in surprise; dimly he hears Ron’s shout, sees Theo throw himself on top of him to keep him back. He winces, spitting a bit of blood out to the side, stomach rolling with pain.
“Fuck you,” Harry grumbles. Draco’s already pulling his shirt off, tossing it in a heap on the sand. He takes a step forward, into the waves.
The clothes whirl round and round. Draco pushes himself up onto the machine, legs folded underneath him, head leaned back against the yellow wall. From this angle Harry can see the arc of his neck, the cut of his jawline and the dig of his teeth -
Draco grins. “How could I? You’re here with me, aren’t you?”
The sound of water cutting off is jolting enough to make Harry jolt. There’s the sound of footsteps, impossibly loud against hard tiles. He looks up just in time to see Draco, hair wet from the shower, kickboard and fins in hand.
Draco grins. “You. Who else?”
“Martyr,” Harry mutters under his breath.
“Chopsticks, somewhere.” Draco rummages through his bag, the ramen abandoned on the bed. “You can shower if you want. I left you some shampoo.”
Blaise shakes his head. The usual easy expression he wore was gone, replaced with stone-cold anger. “You’re on thin fucking ice Granger.”
“Fuck you,” Draco says. His palms are pressed into his eyes, fingers splayed out over his face. “Fuck you and fuck your stupid morning habits.”
Draco stared at his hands as they drove, watching street lamps smear light over his palms. Harry kept checking his mirror, kept checking for something, anything, shadows in the rain -
Harry snorts. “Of course.”
“You’ve lost it,” Harry says. Draco hovers above him, his constellation come to life. “I’m so done with you.”
“They think it’s unnatural,” he whispers. Harry can almost hear the ghosts of Draco’s parents bleeding through the thin words. “They think we’re…”
“I didn’t make a mistake,” Harry mutters, clinking his spoon against his mug. “I like it with salt.”
The dream fades away though, replaced with the burning sun and the heaviness of Draco’s eyes. Harry scrubs a hand over his face - the heat wasn’t helping to take the edge off his anger.
They left two weeks ago. Six in the morning - Harry had pulled up at Draco’s house before the sun rose, the air silent and still. Everything was spotless - the space in the trunk for Draco’s suitcase, the seats vacuumed of crumbs and aired out. The radio lay dark and silent; it was too early for rap, for anything, really.
And yet Harry looked at the sky and dead grass and cracking asphalt and thought
It didn’t work when his father attempted to beat it out of him, but then again, rarely anything worked. He learnt though, over the years, learnt to keep everything contained inside of him, because at least he didn’t cut anyone when he shattered.
“Father, we just won our relay. Can’t I just - “
“I - “
He takes a breath. The ice creams lie forgotten in the cup holders between them. Draco’s hand goes up to his own neck; he twists the coin almost viciously, leaving a red mark in the soft skin. “Is it something you want?”
“I’m sorry,” Harry says, the words gibberish in his mouth. He’s lost track of how many times he’s said it, syllables disintegrating between his lips until all that was left was ash. “I - I forgot - “
“Don’t,” Pansy says, her voice low and hard. “Let him see Harry.”
He can see the barest hint of a reflection in the window, all darkened shapes and blurred lines. He doesn’t bother to turn around though, just shrugs. “It’s my forté. I should go into acting.”
When they get there, Harry helps Draco carry the bags up. He pauses just long enough to dump everything on the bed before turning around again. Draco grabs his arm, fingers catching on his sleeve, tangled in the drawstring.
The words are heavy enough that Harry almost feels it, rigid tension that goes down his spine. “You’re so fucking mitigatory,” he says, through clenched teeth and a tight throat. “That’s a great idea, actually. Let’s just not talk about it. Let’s just wait until we blow up
It starts with the steady rhythm of tires on the asphalt, the shuddering of the glass in their frames. The radio plays distantly in the background - something slow and sad, crackling with interference. Harry liked rap, twisted words and heavy bass, so different from the low voices and crooning songs Draco preferred. It somehow combined into this; a mix of electronic melodies and crooning vocals, a song none of them particularly liked but listened to anyway. The sun blurs in the distance, blue and red and gold, heat shimmering in the distance.
Harry breathes in, breathes out. The rush of cold air against his skin is almost dizzying. Draco is a ghost in the rain, a drowned creature made of water, a corpse frozen in ice.
Sirius smiles. “You just know.”
Harry smiled, hard enough that his face hurts, hard enough that he forgot about the pain in his chest.
a small part of him says.
“Sold.”
“Events over 200’s aren’t real,” Harry retorts. He laughs as Draco hits him, cold fingers pinching into his skin. “No. I think I always - I thought about you too much, even before training camp. But I was on the blocks and I was watching you and you dove in and…I think that’s when I knew.”
He shoves his spoon into his mouth, as if he could choke the thoughts down with sugar and ice. Draco gives him a strange look - he’s wearing the coin, Harry realizes, the coin he had bought from the market the day before. It’s threaded around his neck, hanging in the hollow of his throat, glinting in the reflection of the blazing sun. He wonders what Draco wished for.
Harry could hear the whooshing sound of Hermione letting out a long breath through the earpiece, but eventually, she said, “Well no, obviously that is highly unlikely. Still, you could have at least let me come with you.”
Harry was jostled closer to the bar and he broke eye contact with the stranger, returning his attention to the scantily clad woman in front of him. Any number of blokes in the bar would probably be more than happy to swap places with him, but of course, the women had managed to ensnare one of the few men in here that had no interest whatsoever in all of that exposed skin. Harry cast a furtive look down the bar—hopefully not the

“That’s why we work so well together; you’re the brains and I’m the—”
The Healer must have heard him because she gave him a reassuring smile before turning to Draco. “Everything that happens in this ward is kept under the strictest confidence, so it would be inappropriate for me to comment on any past patients I may have had.”
“Yeeessssss,” Harry whined, still staring at Draco as naked need contorted the features of his face. Draco stroked him softly, letting his thumb slide over Harry’s lower lip.
“Draco, darling! There you are! I thought you’d snuck off and gone home.” Harry spun around to see the bride from earlier step up and throw her hand around the man’s—Draco’s—neck and pull his head down to place a kiss on his cheek. When she released him, a fire engine red stamp of her lips stood out against his pale skin.
Harry took another drink of his beer before grinning back at the other man; if he thought Harry was scared, he was about to find out how wrong he was. Harry took a moment to adjust himself before standing up—the last thing he needed was to broadcast his state of arousal with a tent in his trousers—before swaggering over to the other side of the bar.
“Oh yeah?” Harry asked. All of the frustration that he had when he first got here was gone and he was just amused and intrigued to find out whatever this man was going to say next.
“No, no, it’s not that.” At Draco’s expression, Harry rushed to assure him, “I mean, you were, but that’s not why I’m here.” Draco looked slightly mollified by Harry’s reassertion of his skills in the bedroom.
“Do you want to go grab the ingredients, or should I?” Harry asked as he thumbed through his worn copy of
Realisation was beginning to dawn on Harry and he looked back over his shoulder at the fit stranger, but if he was looking for hope in that direction, his hopes were dashed; the man was wearing a Cheshire grin and his eyes sparkled as he caught sight of Harry’s pleading look.
Just like that, Pansy’s desperate look was washed away and she grinned up at Draco as she clung onto his arm. “I knew you wouldn’t betray me. You love me!”
“A little assistance?” Draco asked, his voice silky as Harry realised that he was staring unabashedly at Draco and cleared his throat. Draco turned his head and leaned closer, bringing his face close enough that Harry could reach out and touch.
Hermione’s head dropped and she began rubbing her forehead with her fingers, no doubt while a steady stream of invectives about Harry’s brashness ran through her head. Harry didn’t break eye contact with Snape. He knew this campaign was genius and if Snape didn’t realise it too, then he really was a fool.
Hermione looked like she was about to say something, but then her eyes darted to the right and she stood up straighter, smoothing down her skirt. Harry turned just in time to see Kingsley finish his walk past the wall of windows lining the conference room and round the doorframe. “Nothing’s official yet, but I think you two are going to be busy making sure every kitchen has a bunch of kale in their crisper next year.”
“I’m not really sure that would have made it less uncomfortable, to be honest,” Harry said. Though if that lean blond had offered…
