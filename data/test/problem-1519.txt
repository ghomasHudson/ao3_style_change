“Have a nice Christmas,” Draco said to Ron before turning away. “Tell the others that, too,” he added before walking down the stairs.
Draco looked around the train platform, trying to catch a particular boy getting on the Hogwarts Express. Although he didn't find the boy, he found someone else.
Draco drew his legs up and wrapped his arms around them, no longer caring about the stains his hand would most likely leave. He sat there, the faint sound of torch flames flickering made a shiver go down his back. He felt like he was there for hours. Draco tried reasoning with himself.
“Have you heard from Michael?” He asked when his mouth regained moisture. If his body wasn't struggling to maintain basic equilibrium he would be on the verge of panic.
Despite the intention of leaving his thoughts home, the movement and silence of the car made Draco drift back to questioning.
"They call your name and you go sit on a stool, then they put a talking hat on you and it will tell you what house you belong to." Crazed looks were given his way, but he ignored them. "It sounds weird, but I'm telling the truth." Yet he could still hear Granger talk to Longbottom about the spells she knew to use for the 'real' test.
“For it to be on your behalf that would mean you asked him to do it. He might’ve done it for you but that was still his decision to make. It’s not you who killed my parents. It’s not you who I met in that graveyard. You know that you’re not your father, right?” Harry huffed and crossed the room to pull the blond into a hug.
“Yeah, what’s so funny?” Terry asked. “You were giggly when we got off the train too. You also kept waking me up with all your laughing throughout the train ride.”
“Oh, I don’ judge other professors,” Hagrid waved his hands in front of him. “I do worry that he’s always out w’ a sickness. Makes me wonder wot it is that’s always makin ‘im feel bad.” A ruckus outside the hut made them all look up. “Oop, that’d be Buckbeak.” (Hagrid started to put Buckbeak outside whenever Draco came around.) “Must’ve run out of ferrets. Be right back.” Hagrid excused himself and stepped outside.
"Potter." Draco, who's back was facing the Gryffindor table, turned around to see Harry hurriedly duck down, stabbing his food, his face a bright red.
They all laid down on the hard, unforgiving flagstone as Penelope stalked the rows of students, hushing those who were still talking.
Draco eventually found the staircase and, after arguing with the eagle knocker, he climbed up to the empty dormitory. He cleaned his hand to the best of his ability in his confused state and crumpled his ruined robes in a bunch on the floor next to his trunk as pulled out a new shirt for himself.
Mrs Weasley placed a bowl at an empty table setting. "Ah, there you are! Here you go, dears." She gestured to the two empty chairs before her.
“It’s just that Tonks doesn’t seem like the person that would respect a man like Moody. She says he always looked after her but..." Draco shook his head. "I don't know."
Draco was confused, he crawled over to look at the tags tied onto them. There were presents from Michael, Terry, Hermione (Lucius’ face was pinched but didn’t speak a word), even from Anthony. None of the tags showed to be from Harry and Draco pointedly ignored that fact. Draco’s felt his chest grow warm at the thought of his friends getting him presents. (It also added to his guilt of being terrible company on the train ride.)
The words on the paper seemed to make his eyes burn, so he rubbed them, letting his fingers rest at his temples as he continued reading. He almost slipped out of his seat when a hand slammed down on a passage about illusion charms.
“Draco, wait. Do you--“ Harry began to say, making Draco turn back around. “I mean, would you—would you ever—want to--” Harry paused.
"Do you actually care?" Draco wasn't given a chance to answer as he was pulled out of Hospital Wing.
Draco let his legs stretch back to a sitting position. “I-I tried to be helpful. To both of them, I tried to be helpful and all they did was throw it back in my face. Just--” Draco made a helpless noise, feeling upset. “It’s… hard trying to be a good person. A nice person.” He confessed. “Especially when no one seems to notice.” Draco set his head on his knees. “Or even seems to care. And it’s not like me to be a good person. Why does it matter then if I’m a nice person? Why even bother trying to change myself when it’s obvious no one is going to change their mind? That I can't erase what I've already done. And what I've done was be horrible and cruel."
The drawing room was filled with voices. Draco stopped suddenly, thinning his lips as he peered around the corner.
“I got this!” Tonks growled before Draco could say anything. “Get out of here! Get to the Tournament!”
"It doesn't matter now. The Dark Lord's returned. He will finish what he started," Barty Crouch Jr looked at Draco. "And because of you, Lucius Malfoy has been proven to be the most helpful."
are not over that yet? Honestly,“ Draco hasn’t thought of that day since it happened. Potter pulled him closer, talking in a hushed voice.
"Okay, love, I think you're done," Draco's witch told him and he almost shouted in happiness. Gratefully, he let his robes be slipped off. Quickly thanking the witch and putting it on his family tab, he turned away to leave.
Krum hesitated before nodding sagely. “I think I understand. Thank you, Malfoy. I… owe you one.” The phrase tumbled slightly. He quirked up his mouth, patting Draco's shoulder and walked off.
"It wasn’ Draco, Professor Dumbledore! I was talkin’ to him mere seconds before that kid was found. There’s no way he could of—“
“Really.” Draco nodded. “Merlin, I can’t believe you even remember that.” Draco felt his cheeks burn in embarrassment. “That wasn’t my most dignified moment.”
think about you missing the train?” she pointed a finger at him. ”I’ll tell you what they’ll think, they’d--” Mrs. Weasley’s scolding stopped, noticing a manicured hand was still on Draco’s shoulder. Her eyes followed over to a prim Mrs. Malfoy. “Oh, hello.”
Draco’s brow furrowed in confusion before he saw it. He took Harry’s hand, pulling it to the light of the lantern to see the
his heartbeat still beating too quickly. He barely brushed the idea of thinking of Harry like that and copious amount thoughts were forming inside his head that maybe—
Draco wanted to protest again. His father wouldn’t do something so reckless for the sake of him, he was too careful. He was
Was he really about to go through this? What if it wasn’t what he expected? What if he isn’t cut out for this type of thing after all? Should he bother with Harry with this when the Dark Lord is back—
Oliver Wood throughout the game was yelling at Harry to show force with Draco in order to win the game. Midway through the game, Draco noticed it. Hovering near Oliver Wood’s foot, the Snitch fluttered.
“Professor,” Draco let his gaze fall to the floor, shame rolling under his skin. Look at him, reacting so intensely because of a glass ball.
“I should’ve known,” Potter shook his head. “You’re cruel, you know that?” He slammed his shoulder into Draco’s as he left the blond.
Barty Crouch Jr’s eyes darted to the old man. “Dumbledore, how nice to see you once more,” he said. “Been a while, hasn’t it?"
Madam Pomfrey poked her head out and her eyes bugged out. She did a once over Draco and Ron's filthy faces and dirty clothes. “What in Merlin’s name happened?!” She flapped her hands to get Draco onto a bed.
Andromeda, who was at the table and reading the newspaper, clicked her tongue. “She’s probably running around with those chaotic Aurors now. She’s probably getting into all sorts of trouble.”
“It’s fine, really,” Harry said. “I’ll probably read up on...” Harry glanced down at another textbook open near him. “‘Cloud Shapes to Predict Natural Disasters.’ Sounds like it’s going to be a fun chapter.”
Later that night, the four went to sleep in a bundle of blankets and pillows on the floor of Terry's bedroom.
“Sorry,” Draco waved a hand. “Just remembering something Harry said about Michael’s spelling habits on the train.”
what happened in the maze based on what little he knew. It was enough--it has to be enough. Must be.
Oh, it was the first thing Draco did. Harry only told him he couldn't wait to see Draco out on the Quidditch field.
“I know, that pale weasel gives me the shivers too,” Terry shouted in his ear to be heard over the loud booing from the Ravenclaws around them.
They finally reached the base of the Whomping Willow, Crookshanks slinked outside to touch the tree knot.
Draco had that happen to him. The price paid for trying to go against his family’s legacy. An ugly, terrible legacy. One that can be recalled when thinking of the past. Since the past was unchangeable and still in the minds of many.
In honour of one Anthony Goldstein, this update (was supposed to be) for celebration for the beginning of Hanukkah! Happy Hanukkah to all who celebrate! And remember: trans rights!!!
." Anthony defended. Draco smiled briefly before pulling his schoolbag in front of him to look for his Potions book. He found that it wasn't there.
"How bad could've it gone?!" Anthony glanced over Terry's shoulder and wavered. "Oh, it was really bad."
“You two just--Leave me alone!” Draco shouted. It came out more sharply than intended but it let him continue down the corridor without their questioning.
“Apologizing never fixes the problem. What would apologizing do?“ Draco's lips curled into his mouth. “Answer me.” Lucius snapped.
“I’m not thirsty. I’ll be going now. I really don’t feel good. Maybe I need to lie down. Bye, guys.” There was a chorus of concerned ‘bye’s (an added slug by Weasley) and Draco closed the door behind him, giving himself a moment to sort out his mess of thoughts before walking towards Hogwarts. He was halfway up the steps of the entrance hall when someone shouted his name.
Draco finally pushed his trunk on the rack above him and dropped himself on the seat. He watched as students hurried on the Hogwarts Express, desperately trying to get seats with friends.
"Draco!" Draco immediately pointed his wand towards the sound of the noise again. Potter's shocked eyes focused on the tip of his wand.
During palm reading, in the corner of his eye, he could see Harry staring at Hermione and Draco’s hands cradling one another.
“Well. It is. So, uh, I passed out after that. I’m just happy that it all ended up with Sirius being proven innocent.”
What was Harry talking about? He liked him? How was that possible? That’s not how things were supposed to go. It was all wrong. Harry’s supposed to have feelings for someone else. What did Draco do? What did he say? He searched his memories to find a cause.
Harry reacted instantly. He slammed his hand on the still-wet ink and hunched his shoulders. “Draco!” he shouted and received a hiss of silence from the other students. “Draco. Hey, hi, didn’t see you there.” Harry greeted in a quieter voice.
The certain buzz of getting presents didn’t bring a bounce in Draco’s step like it normally did, but he walked towards the sitting room anyway with a pleasant smile. Both Narcissa and Lucius were waiting for him, gleaming gift-wrapped boxes at their feet. He received lavish presents. Shiny books, expensively imported trinkets, soft feeling robes. His favourite was the two signed posters from his beloved French Quidditch team. (One was from one of the Chasers and Captain, Josephine Marat, and the other was from the Keeper, Bastien Janvier.)
“That’s enough, Macmillan!" McGonagall shouted. She gave orders to take Justin to the Hospital Wing and to waft Headless Nick up the stairs, leaving them alone.
Draco was dancing at the Yule Ball. He was dancing with a blurred figure. The figure held their hands high and their other hand settled on Draco's shoulder.
“It's alright, son. It's alright." Lucius swore over Draco's shoulder. "I never meant to make you feel like I didn’t care,” he said after a moment. He pulled back and settled his hands on Draco’s shoulders. “It seems like I’ve made it difficult to remember.”
Yet, I hope that doesn’t discourage you and that you enjoy the rest of these chapters. But you’re all lovely readers anyway.
“Students,” Dumbledore raised his hands up for silence. “Welcome, to a new year at Hogwarts. I hope that you find yourself learning lots in between this year of exciting events.” That made the students whisper amongst themselves. “For this year, we are the humble host for one of the most timely competitions in history. The Triwizard Tournament!”
Harry winces. Near the back of the room, Nagini curiously rears her head. She had gorged herself in the messily built mass graves dug into Koldovstoretz' grounds (Harry saw her slithering from group to group of overworked Muggleborns in the aftermath, eliciting a chorus of frightened shouts each time) and has been sleeping peacefully curled around Voldemort’s chair at the head of the table ever since. Voldemort tells her to go back to sleep without looking over, and she obediently settles down.
Dad breathes out a deep sigh. “Merlin, I know. You let me know right away if he says anything weird to you and your siblings, okay?”
He watches with amusement and fascination as Draco immediately dives for the blankets and shirts, throwing one over his head and shoving another onto Harry’s chest. It takes some maneuvering, and he’s sore and heavy, but he eventually has them wrapped tightly in the blankets, trapping their scent inside. Harry’s seen him doing this countless times in the study back home, but this is the first time he’s joined in. Draco will treasure the memory of the shy pleasure on Harry’s handsome face.
“Because you are good, baby. You’re my good boy,” Harry whispers, sounding a lot closer than he did a few moments ago. He tucks Draco’s hair behind his ear and kisses the sensitive place behind, lips hot like a brand on Draco’s skin. “I love you.”
Harry gives him another finger and doesn’t dignify him with a response, opting instead to lick at where his wet rim is stretched over questing fingers. His rhythm is slow but consistent, fingers so firm over Draco’s prostate that each movement elicits sighing moans that he doesn’t even bother to contain. Pregnancy seems to have erased all of his shyness and replaced it with greed. He lies back, lazily stroking himself and taking Harry’s fingers, clenching tight when they’re seated fully just to enjoy the sensation of being filled.
Gobsmacked, Harry walks over and pulls him up, something roiling uncomfortably in his chest at the way Viktorovich winches and cradles his bloodied side. His white outer robe is thin and clearly made for battle, stopping just above his knees. He must have been a great beauty back in his day--Harry can see it in the plush smiling mouth and wide brown eyes, fanned by thick lashes. His shiny gray hair is pulled into a long, utilitarian braid, and when he turns his neck towards the stained glass windows at the back wall, the sunlight casts a multicolored glow on the graceful column.
He’s not satisfied with that answer. He hates that he can see some of his father in Lucius’ straight nose and steely eyes. “That sounds a lot like running from consequences.”
Another man upends the entirety of a velvet coin pouch he pulls from his pockets into the bucket in support of Watcher, to much playful fanfare. Draco huffs again. Pettigrew refuses to add to the pot, and Harry shakes his head as well. Next to them, Edmonton adds a ridiculous amount, and Draco gives Harry the driest look he’s ever seen.
Grandfather gives him an arch look. Then he glances over at where Lily has stopped plucking at her strings to give them a wide-eyed stare.
Scorpius shuffles close and wraps his arms around Father’s waist. Father strokes a hand over his hair, and they stand together for a bit, smelling of mint and earth.
Several murmurs of agreement rise around her, the Carrow siblings among the loudest. Greyback snorts and throws an arm over the back of his chair. Bellatrix fixes him with a gimlet-eyed look, and he holds his hands up in a conciliatory gesture.
“I promise to tell you about it,” Draco says. “I want to tell you about it. It’s just that I’m very angry, so I’ll cry if I talk about it right now, which is ridiculous.”
Harry raises a brow, hands drawing small circles on his pelvis, very pointedly avoiding his aching erection. “Don’t normally what?”
Father’s reply arrives soon, directing him to the Leaky Cauldron in half an hour. They cuddle in contented silence until it’s time for him to leave. As he steps into the floo, he blows Harry a kiss, and the last thing he sees is Harry dramatically clutching it to his chest. He arrives in Diagon Alley laughing brightly.
Thanks to those of you who sent in questions over on my Tumblr! I mostly have no idea what I'm doing, but it's been nice to have a little corner of the internet for us to communicate. I'm sorry I always ramble. I'm tracking the tag #ditb fic and I'm slowly psyching myself up to turn DMs on. Thanks for your comments as well! You guys rock!
Shows of strength unfitting of his willowy frame are not uncommon for Voldemort, but they still manage to shock Harry each time he witnesses it. The room, once filled with low chatter, falls abruptly silent. Minister Sokolov lets out a wheezing noise of pain when Voldemort throws him onto the floor. Harry can see that his body is wracked with the short, jerky movements that follow an extended period of time under the Cruciatus Curse.
“Then warm me up,” Draco whispers, pressing close, very deliberately not answering Harry’s questions. He pauses to bring his hands back up to his face and blows quickly on them, rubbing them together. Then, without preamble, he slides his hand into Harry’s sleep pants and gently strokes his prick.
Once he's licked them clean, he pulls back with a kiss on the back of Draco's hand. He shucks his trousers and pants, and then struggles out of his boots. When he lays back against the day bed, striking a goofy pose with his head propped up on one arm, Draco laughs. He throws one leg over Al's hips, and before long he's pressing the wet lips of his cunt against Al's erection, a deep sigh rising in his throat.
Before he’s even done talking, he’s being pushed insistently through a door. Whatever they’ve stepped into is dark, and chaotic with different scents. Harry flips a light switch, and he’s staring down a rack of coats and shawls and the like.
Harry knows all of Draco’s cues, now--recognizes the high pitch of those moans, knows what the shaking thighs and greedy rolls of his hips mean. It’s almost cruel to pull back and slide a finger inside, knowing how close he is to coming, but the keening moan that bursts from Draco’s lips is worth it. The wet heat sucks his finger in, and Draco bucks harshly the moment Harry’s finger tip brushes over his prostate.
“It’s supposed to catch dreams,” Harry says, gently. “It’ll change color each time a new one has been caught. You just say
I'm still planning chapters out, trying to feel my way around where I wanna take things, and pestering my friend for ideas. But above all I'm just having fun toying around with this world, writing my usual smut (it won't be every chapter lol), and trying to write something darker, if that makes sense. I'd consider these chapters more loosely related oneshots than one cohesive story line, mostly for the sake of my sanity. This may change if irl magically gets less overwhelming, but for now I'm just sharing the fun. With my new plans in mind, I've updated the archive warning, and I plan to update tags/warnings etc as I go.
It’s a surprise when Harry’s cock twitches again and then shoots into his hand, but a welcome one. Harry fucks into his fist with several quick, weak thrusts, mouth open against Draco’s cheek. He squeezes firmly, twisting over the head and thumbing at the slit before sliding his hand lower and rolling Harry’s bullocks in his slick hand. He doesn’t stop until Harry firmly grasps his wrist to still him. Harry’s still half-hard. Draco can feel it when he reaches down again, and pouts when he is stopped yet again.
When he catches sight of Draco’s amused face, he ducks his head with a little grin as Draco giggles softly at him.
“Then it’s a good thing no one asked you, fool,” Says Thicknesse, who gives Harry an unfriendly smile as he and his usual cronies line up--the Carrows, and the dreaded Dolohov.
“Mr. Pettigrew, I’ve been wanting to express my appreciation to you for being so good to Harry,” Draco says, in an earnest voice.
The rest of the week follows much of the same. They eat so much Chinese food that Harry eventually begs off. Then Harry starts bringing him a variety of foods.
“Look at me while I’m fucking you, Draco,” Harry says, draping those long legs over his shoulders so he can press closer, grind his knot against Draco’s rim each time he’s inside, press insistently into his prostate.
“The Order--that is, the resistance, they would hop from place to place under fidelus, for their own safety. When they found out they were having me, my parents went into hiding with me for some time. Pettigrew gave them up.”
Draco is terribly shy about the maneuvering process and blushes to the roots of his hair when he finds himself turned around, facing Harry’s slowly filling cock as Harry kneads his arse cheeks.
“I know you like me, too. You have to,” Draco says, after he pulls off of Harry’s thumb, voice hitching dangerously.
“I smell your Dad’s favorite treacle tarts. I smell his magic, too. The flowers at the Manor. Mother’s perfume. That’s about it.”
All three of the Omegas in the parlor laugh, and though the reason why is a mystery to Harry, it’s nice to see Draco’s smile.
Draco waves his hand back and forth. “I’m passable. It’s Pansy who’s the prodigy at it. The only reason I asked Mother for lessons is because I wanted to do it with her.”
Daddy pulls the owner into a friendly chat as Lily pulls Grandfather from one end of the store to another, asking after the difference in this or that stitch, and what color works best for what occasion, and which one does he think will look best? To her surprise, he tucks his walking stick underneath his arm and begins to pluck some things off of racks, pressing them wordlessly into her arms. He does it insistently, with none of Nan’s cajoling or commentary, but he participates, waiting patiently for her to step out of the dressing room. A decisive nod means she’s keeping it, and a sneer means it’s going back to the rack. By the time they’re done, she leaves with four new robes and one nice winter dress, and when she thanks him for coming, Grandfather gives her that same little half smile he’d leveled at Al’s camera.
Harry’s tongue drags over the sensitive flesh and Draco lets out a sob, arching his neck back in search of air. Blunt teeth settle over his bondmark, digging roughly in. He comes so powerfully that it’s a completely silent affair, breath leaving him in juddering bursts through his nose as Harry fucks him through it.
Behind Father, the back door swings open, and out steps their Grandfather, which makes both of them tense up. “Draco, your ill-behaved progeny will not distract me from our conversation.”
Draco rolls up his sleeve when asked, and after a quick swipe of antiseptic, an enchanted needle finds its way into a vein. Draco flinches violently at the sight of his own blood flowing through the thin tube and turns his head away, squeezing his eyes shut tightly. Purebloods are rarely squeamish, and potions-oriented Draco doesn’t succumb to disgust easily.
The Dark Lord’s skin is pale enough that it is difficult to tell where it ends and his robes begin. They trail behind him as he makes his way onto the grass. He is trailed by a veritable procession of sallow-faced house elves, who carry firewood and stones and steaming platters of food.
Another finger slides inside, quick, and suddenly Harry isn’t teasing anymore, thrusting fingers pressing deep, the wriggling warmth of his tongue dipping towards the base of Draco’s cock as he swallows in a ripple of his throat. Draco’s first orgasm of the night creeps up on him like he’s been struck. He whines through his nose and trembles and bucks, hands flying up to clasp at Harry’s broad shoulders as he swallows Draco’s release down.
Draco smiles. A part of him feels a little lighter, a little less cross-wired. “Thank you, Mr. Thicknesse. And thank you for speaking with me.”
“Now, now, Narcissa. It’s a… fascinating interpretation.” Father hums, though the look on his face is similarly disapproving.
“A surprisingly pragmatic decision.” Grandfather says, which is about the closest to a complement Daddy will ever get from him.
,” Draco hisses back, which neatly removes all of the dark mirth from her face and sends the audience into another tizzy.
“Best of luck tonight.” The Dark Lord releases him, and with one last amused look, glides away, excitedly greeted by the rest of his followers.
“When I first thought I might be, I didn’t want to get overexcited, because we’ve been trying for so long, and I couldn’t see a Healer without you. And now I almost—“
“Hermione’s always been like that. You learn to roll with it, but it’s overwhelming at first. I can ask her to lay off if you want.” Harry says.
“Did you forget? Only you were so excited to hear about it during my heat,” Draco says, breath wobbling as Harry plucks at him through the thin fabric, sending a blade of heat down from his chest to his slowly hardening cock.
He can feel his face heating. If it weren’t a typical London day, he could blame it on the warmth of sunlight, but there is no hiding or excusing how flustered he is. He is thankful they are a ways away from the more densely populated areas of the gardens. Anyone watching closely would quickly begin concocting any number of unflattering speculations.
“Fairly well, yeah. His little brother was my best friend.” Harry answers, looking down at his clasped hands.
Mother sighs and strokes his back. “Just listen to everything he says, darling. And you better give me this, too.”
For a little while, Hermione watches him work in fascinated silence. Then she rests a hesitant hand on his shoulder.
There’s a stubborn firmness to Draco’s jaw, and his shoulders are set, but Harry doesn’t miss the way he wrings his hands, the decorative rings he’s wearing glittering fetchingly in the low light of Harry’s office. So he had a plan, if a clumsy one, and he’s hoping Harry will be enough of a knothead to go along with it. Harry sighs, recognizing that he needs to put a pin in this.
Saying it aloud feels cheap, almost. Weak. However, Ron’s rapidly losing the angry flush on his face, and Harry can feel his hackles lowering accordingly.
Draco sighs as Harry trails more kisses down his neck, scenting him with single-minded focus. Then he huffs out a short laugh, reaching up a hand to slide his fingers through thick dark hair and scratch at the scalp beneath. “Well… at least we made a fashionable entrance.”
Harry laughs humorlessly. “It’s all we have, love. It’s what I need to do if I want to keep taking care of you, in any case.”
“Was the message clear enough, or shall I write you some instructions? My mother had me convinced you were quite the libertine. I thought this would be easy!”
As it turns out, Harry is a horrible dancer. But holding a ribbon and running in opposite directions is simple enough. The circle brings them back together amidst a flurry of chatter and swirling fabric. Harry lifts him off his feet, and Draco doesn’t bother to contain his laugh, even though it seems like all eyes are on them. Father would say that showing this much joy around those who would happily take your place is as much of a weakness as kindness is. Draco, achy and bow-legged and covered in marks from the night before, has never felt more untouchable.
“Please touch my cock,” He says, and he gathers enough strength to prop himself up onto shaky elbows, which gives him just enough leverage to grind back onto Harry’s length.
She gasps softly as Draco advances on her, and lets out a whimper when Draco cups her chin. She closes her eyes, and tears stream steadily down her face, landing wet and warm on his hand.
Draco had absolutely been planning on saying something else, some bland platitude about answered prayers and baby names, but the words that have slipped have surprised him with their truth. Now that the fear has been voiced, he shrugs one shoulder in a helpless gesture he picked up from Harry, waving his hand significantly between them.
It’s a cozy, gorgeously decorated space, and magically expanded to be quite large. It’s three floors tall, equipped with several bedrooms, a study, and a lounge room. Still, Harry wouldn’t be surprised if it is smaller than any place Draco has ever lived before.
None of them are as subtle as they likely think they’re being, and Draco quickly decides not to comment on it. If they don’t think him smart enough to pick up on a little conspiracy, then so be it.
“Yes!” Draco sobs. “I begged you to do something for days and days on end! But you didn’t, and so I married Harry. Now guess what, Father? I love him. I love him, and there is nothing that you could do to separate us.”
Harry doesn’t even remember what event that might have been taken at. There have been an endless number of them, and he’s grown so used to being photographed that he rarely fights it anymore. Is that really what they look like to most people? Why hasn’t it ever hit him until now?
Al hopes all his anger is shining in eyes. He hopes that he looks so much like Dad that Lucius hates it.
It is customary for newly wedded couples to be playfully gifted with the waxy white berries from mistletoe, each one signifying a kiss to be shared in secret. Draco remembers arguing with his friends over who would approach who first, and then staring longingly at the exchange of these berries as a child. Now, as he watches Harry fail to hide his confusion when yet another giggling young person presses a white berry into his hands on their way to someone else, he wonders what his younger self would think.
Draco’s spent a frustrating amount of time the past few weeks feeling unbearably randy. There doesn’t seem to be a single thing Harry can do that he doesn’t find so arousing he can’t focus. This morning, watching his husband roll the sleeves of his button-down shirt up his strong arms had been enough to make Draco dip back into the closet and exchange undergarments in a single-minded flurry while Harry’s back was turned. It’s been nice to shed layer after layer of the inhibitions trained into him, and the back-and-forth of their games is something he cherishes. Finding different ways to drive Harry to distraction seems only fair, after what Draco’s been going through.
Harry holds a hand out to help him up. “Is this potion gonna make us go mad? Am I gonna start singing nursery rhymes?”
Was motivated to finish this chapter early and make some good progress on the next few. I've seen a couple of folks joking that their comments are excessive, so I want to make something clear: I love hearing from you guys whether you send me emojis, simple sentences, or huge paragraphs
He’s briefly distracted by one of the elves announcing they are finished. Draco links their hands together and rests his forehead against Harry’s collarbone as Harry thanks and dismisses the elves.
When Draco’s close enough, Harry cradles his hips and then kisses his stomach before pressing his face into it, breathing in deeply. Draco strokes his hair, and then lowers his hands to massage his shoulders.
“One day I’ll convince you you’re not some supervillain in disguise,” laughs Harry, bending over to pull his shoes off.
Harry sighs. That explains the early waking. He slowly rises from the bed and tip-toes towards the door, gripping the handle and tilting his head. Their voices are flowing loudly down the hallway, the three of them clearly too upset to consider a silencing charm.
“You don’t have to if you don’t really want to, Draco. But I can tell that you’re lonely when I’m away, and I see the way your eyes glaze over when you’re holding court. It’s not enough for you. If you don’t want to run the estate, at least let me know how I can make things easier for you.”
“No,” Harry says, firmly. “Never. I’m sorry for being distant. The Dark Lord wants me involved with the investigations around the bombings. I… used to know one of the people responsible. I need to talk to him soon and it’s been getting to me.”
AKA Draco Malfoy and the Terrible, Horrible, No Good, Very Bad Day(s). A quieter chapter, but I hope it doesn't disappoint.  Please see end note warnings, as usual
“Fifteenth of April,” Davies answers. “So we have a little time. I know you’re a busy man, Mr. Potter, so this probably won’t mean much, but you’ll have a break from us until then, at least, unless something big comes up and we need you. Thanks for your help.”
Scorpius elbows him again. Then he's blindsided when James turns around and then throws a handful of dirt right in his face.
Harry interrupts his thoughts by squeezing his arse and urging him into a tight, decadent roll, and Draco's head is filled with static for a good few minutes. Harry likes to tease, but he’s not doing that tonight, pulling out every trick: pausing to suck insistently on Draco’s swollen folds, or pulling away to nip delicately at his thigh and muffling a laugh into his skin when Draco calls him an unkind name and bucks his hips in search of his mouth, or dragging his tongue over Draco’s throbbing clit in quick but insistent circles. Harry reaches up to curl a hand around Draco’s neglected cock, and that’s enough to have him crying out Harry’s name as he shatters apart. Harry twists at his head on the upstroke, milking him until Draco's batting his hand away, oversensitive. Harry dips his tongue into Draco’s hole, giving him something to clench around as he comes.
Draco’s heat lasts for six of the twelve days of Yuletide. Harry forbids the human staff from entering their home entirely and asks that the house elves leave food outside their bedroom door at set times. Otherwise, Harry takes him wherever they happen to be at any given moment--on his hands and knees by the yule log, splayed wide on the couch in the home theater, bent over the kitchen counter, held against a wall by powerful arms. They shatter vases and make messes of their food and somehow spell an entire bookshelf over onto the floor in a shower of fluttering pages and bookmarks. Draco still fights Harry whenever he can, enjoying the way it feels when Harry checks his impatience with a firm hand. They still take the time to trade stories and ruminate on where they’d like their future to go.
Draco smiles shakily up at him from his seat, and settles when Harry runs his thumb briefly over his bondmark. Harry wasn’t lying, but he’s mostly standing for the subtle intimidation of it all. It’s one of the first things he learned when he became a Death Eater, and it has served him well in interrogations of his own. As Aurors, Davies and Beauregard are likely aware of it, given the uncomfortable way they glance at each other.
He blinks rapidly and then looks away. Harry cups his cheeks and runs his thumbs under Draco's eyes.
In halted, shaking sentences, Draco recounts what he experienced on the day of the bombing. He tells Harry of his timely shield charm, of his fear that he’d lost the child, of erratic crows and walking in a bedraggled group away from what was left of Sonja Avery’s mansion. He tells Harry about the woman in red, and the curse that drained her of her life’s blood.
“Will it take you away very often?” Draco asks, watching in fascination as Harry begins setting a plate for him.
Harry rolls his eyes good-naturedly. Then he gives Draco one last smile before the two of them walk away, the small crowd parting for them.
For a time, Aunt Bella is undefeated. And then Harry is the next to arrive. His bespectacled gaze searches the crowd, and when he finds Draco, he smiles, raising his hand in greeting. Behind him, Draco can hear the whispers kicking up. “The little orphan,” someone says, and another says “...a fluke, to be sure.”
“Oh, really? So what is it?” Draco asks, pulling a pillow over to rest his head. There’s a playful novelty in facing each other with their chins propped up on their knuckles, but the call of their bed becomes increasingly more seductive as the late hour chugs on. Harry’s hand leaves his hip to play with his hair.
“It’s, er. How to explain it? It’s from the House of Fabergé. Have you ever heard of it?” When Draco shakes his head, Harry lets out a relieved breath.
They’ve built a little routine, in this odd Christmas break. They spend time together, and sometimes one of them will accompany Daddy to the restaurant, and they stop by the Burrow and play around with the family until they’re sore and their bellies are aching from Molly’s food and how much they’ve laughed, and then they come home for dinner. Grandfather will engage one of them in frustrating conversation--or in Lily’s case, none at all--and then retreat into his room, visited mostly by healers. He ignores Daddy completely, and sometimes frustrates Father so much that he’s summarily banished from all the rooms he frequents. He’s kind of miserable and out of place. So she decides to pose the question when it’s quiet.
They don’t speak on it anymore, but Harry’s distrust nags at him. Harry’s good instincts are the main reason they are even married, if indirectly, but Draco is struggling to understand what makes one stuffy Pureblood less trustworthy than any other. In truth, they are all untrustworthy in their own ways, but to have one of them stand out is unsettling.
Harry is rushing away from him before he’s even done talking. On his way out, he sees Sokolov, still on the floor, shaking with wordless laughter.
She rises to her feet and leaves in a rush, the door swinging creakily behind her. He hears her feet thundering all the way down the stairs. He doesn’t know why he lets her go. There is still so much he wants to ask her. If nothing else, Harry being the one to bring her in to the Aurors would be amazing for their investigation, and a good deed is something he sorely needs after taking the blame for Draco’s curse. It is too late to call her back now though, and Draco doesn’t trust how he might react to seeing her face again so soon.
It almost breaks Draco’s heart, the hopefulness in Harry’s voice. He cups Harry’s face, making sure they’re seeing eye-to-eye.
Harry is kind enough not to point it out, but they'd certainly arrived a little earlier than he would be needed at the Citadel. They spend two lovely weeks exploring London, shopping and trading childhood stories, and kissing in secluded places. On the eve of Harry's final free day in a while, Harry nests with him again, tactfully pretending he doesn't see the tears in Draco's eyes.
After Draco’s body seems to have given all it’s going to give, Harry finally manages to get him out of bed and heads for the washroom. Draco, still struggling with a dark, all-consuming need, fights him every step of the way. When nuzzling and groping and even dropping to his knees does not get him what he wants, he descends into a full on tantrum. Some hindbrain urge is enticing him to push back. He kicks and shoves and scratches, and is either ignored or gently redirected. He goes completely limp, refusing to help Harry pick him up, but it only has the entirely unwanted effect of making Harry break into laughter.
The servant stares down at him, looking bewildered and frustrated. Draco stammers, and then he shakes his head. He is just about to apologize when a familiar voice drawls out from behind them.
“Potter, a little birdy told me you brought your Omega to the duels,” Alecto says, around a grin. “Every day with you after Beltane makes him more and more adventurous, don’t you think?”
Father is calling his name, which spurs him back into action. Draco can hear his rapidfire footfalls thundering behind him. When he makes it safely out of the Hall of Ancestors, he slams the door with all his might, and pettishly seals it with a powerful locking charm Harry taught him. It settles over the door in a ripple of chaotic magic, so powerful that the hinges rattle satisfyingly. Father slams on the door only once, and then the low muttering of countercharms sounds out into the tense hallway.
The moment Harry frees his erection from his trousers, Draco leans forward, pink lips sliding over the tip. He sucks gently, tongue worming into the slit. Cor, but he’s getting better and better at it each time they try. Harry presses against the back of his head, pushing slowly but insistently forward, intent on pushing the limit Draco’s been frustrated with reaching. As he was expecting, Draco tenses up on a little gag, eyes watering. The pulse of movement makes Harry’s hips jerk, chasing the sucking wet heat.
One leg is thrown over a broad shoulder, the other pressed down to the bed with a powerful hand, and then Harry lines up and thrusts inside in one long slide that has the both of them moaning into the air. Knees planted wide, Harry leans down for a kiss. Draco can taste himself on Harry’s lips, arousal and come, and it just makes him greedier for it. They nip and lick and bite at each other until Draco finally feels prepared. Harry is big, and they hadn’t spent as much time getting ready as they usually did. The stretch is delicious, but there’s no denying the adjustment period.
Thicknesse gives him a tight smile. “I forgot to ask if you and your husband will be attending the Imbolc celebrations. It was very strange to have them pushed back on account of the investigations. I should very much like to give you my blessings--it would make me feel like things have gone back to normal.”
good enough for him. More than, really. It is what he was raised for and something he genuinely desired, despite his earlier fears of marriage. Still, admitting it aloud in the face of someone working through their pregnancy makes him feel strangely defensive.
He laughs weakly and nods, sighing through his nose when she pats his shoulder. After checking once again that he’s okay, she leaves him be. It occurs to him that he didn’t ask her not to tell Harry. The anger he feels is a deep, old thing, and one that he thinks he should share if only to avoid it poisoning him. It’s time to keep fewer secrets, he decides.
They observe glittering gems and tiaras encrusted with diamonds and ridiculously embellished watches that absolutely do not tell the time. Draco refuses to show Harry the sketches he put together for a custom piece, and he’s so very chuffed about the surprise that Harry decides not to press it.
When Harry gets notice that the rebuilding of St. Savior’s House is complete, he feels about ten pounds lighter. It’s ridiculous how a building as big as the Citadel can feel so cramped. The non-choice of living in close quarters with other rich families or snubbing the Dark Lord reminds Harry of the old world books Ginny and Hermione were so fascinated with, wherein kings hopped about from castle to castle with their entire court in tow whether they wanted to go or not.
As he was hoping, Borgin’s oily smile widens into something a bit more organic. He has always been chuffed to be on the receiving end of Draco’s manners, something Father had employed to sweeten deals and secure sales for a long time. The Borgin family’s fairly impecunious history has given the man something of an inferiority complex.
“It’s Harry. He’s very different from what I remember, and I guess I just--wow, this sounds very silly when I say it aloud. I just wanted to know how he is. It’s very difficult to talk to him.” Hermione says, in a giggly rush. Then, as if hoping that it will smooth over the question, she cheerfully asks, “What are you brewing?”
“Come here, darling,” Sonja says, holding her hands out. “I was with my Luca during the celebrations so I didn’t get to give you my blessings.”
Scorpius tries to hide his surprised look by sipping away at his drink, but he thinks Father must catch his furrowed brows, because he lets out a deep laugh and says I know, and isn’t it so weird? James isn’t one to be overly bothered with other people’s opinions. Scorpius agrees. He also once thought there was nothing that could keep James out of those gardens.
Al absently turns page after page. There is a copy of pretty much every family photo they have. He watches himself grow up in little boxes, from nappies to curly-haired and pouty on the quidditch pitch at age six, to shuffling nervously before his first day on the Hogwarts express, and then distractedly cutting away at a pile of newspapers. His siblings undergo the same transformation. There are quite a few photos of Dad--of him standing outside his newly opened restaurant, and then leaning over to whisper privately into Father’s ear at a Ministry function, or him sleepily cradling one baby or the other in his arms with his glasses askew. There are even more photos of Father. Al loves the ones where the wave of his hair (inherited from Nan) are the most pronounced: him bending pensively over a cauldron with the steam curling into his face, or after a moment on the broom with Dad, or clad in pajamas while bellowing down the stairs after a James covered in chocolate. It reminds him of growing up.
Draco sighs and presses his face into Harry’s neck. Harry comfortingly kneads the back of his thighs, no doubt aching from being spread so wide. Draco rolls his hips forward, seeking friction on Harry’s muscled stomach. Harry had cleaned his stomach after each orgasm, but now the pre-come oozing from his hard cock quickly eases the way for the tiny, aborted movements.
“One of the younger ones snuck me some bread the other day,” Fred says, giving him a wry twist of the lips as he rises from his cot, “But it was kind of hard. Almost chipped a tooth, really! Though I don’t suppose it matters, what with my imminent date with a dementor.”
“I take it someone’s frightened the snake lord,” Black laughs, the sound little more than a grating rattle.
But then he gets one of Father’s weekly letters, and it feels like his heart’s about to burst out of his chest with the way he can tell Father’s excited to see them all again, and he decides to just suck it up and deal. Dad said they’d give it a go, and the Christmas holiday is only a little over two weeks. He can deal with it.
I should be honest, writing this has been fun and cathartic for me. A dear friend of mine passed away about a year ago now and working through that has been difficult because I'm so busy. Quarantine has been challenging in many ways, but I'm grateful it at least sparked my creative spirit and has me writing fanfiction again. That said, while I think this fic can be sad at times, I hesitate to call it angst. It's mostly a story about family and family can be difficult sometimes.
Harry conjures a knife at his request, and though he’s hesitant to do it, he draws the blade across his palm with one swift movement. A sharp sting sends a frisson of cold pain dancing down Draco’s arm, and blood wells up immediately. Draco does the same for Harry on the opposite hand, who doesn’t even blink. Then they clasp their bleeding palms together, and Draco begins the low chant. After a moment, Harry joins him, lacing their fingers together. It’s a lengthy, complicated spell, layered with modified switching charms and protections. The best thing wizards ever did was shortening their spells into simple incantations.
Draco can’t tell which he wants to do more. Fucking into Harry’s fist is just as satisfying as pressing back and taking his cock as deep as possible, enjoying the fullness.
They walk a circuit around the grounds, with Draco’s friends trailing nosily but respectfully behind them. Draco has seen Harry interacting with others of their station, but watching lesser nobles approach them to schmooze is a new experience entirely. He can see the hate settled in the eyes of the Purebloods, the envy in the Half-Bloods sponsored by them. Foreign visitors turn to Draco to translate, confident in a Pureblood’s talent for languages. They are often quite rude. Draco censors the worst of it, but Harry’s not fooled.
He startles at the feeling of shifting pressure against one ankle. He glances down and covers his mouth with both hands to muffle the yelp of alarm rising in his throat as Nagini winds herself around his legs. Draco has always been tall for an Omega, but she clears the leggy portion of his five feet and eleven inches as easily as anything. She pauses to rest the underside of her head against his lower belly, a considerable length of her tail still left to spare trailing behind. Her hold on him is not especially powerful, but he knows that any attempts to move will be quickly aborted.
Harry drags another pillow over for him to hold, and Draco clutches it like a lifeline, turning his head to the side and closing his eyes.
“You lot can bitch and joke all you want, but I tell you, that is a happy Omega,” Greyback says, shrugging.
They claim a fire as far on the outskirts of the gardens as possible. Several other couples had the same idea, and, to Draco’s dismay, so have a few of Harry’s peers, who stare unashamedly at them. They are several feet away, about as close as they can get without being rude. Draco recognizes Dolohov, Thicknesse, the Carrow siblings. The other two are wearing their shiny silver masks, but their body language broadcasts interest.
, hoping to draw patrolling Aurors to the area. The bright red spark crests just underneath the shifting mass of birds above, reflecting dully off of plumb feathered bodies. Startled, they part, and the sparks are able to fizzle out into the calm blue behind. Heartened, Mara casts another after they cover more ground.
“Yeah, Wormtail. He, er, knew my dad. Back before the resistance began. They were very close as children, apparently. He’d been checking up on me for years and I never knew.”
It hits him just how mawkish the little speech was the moment it’s over, so he stares back down at his cauldron and clears his throat. After a few moments of lingering silence, Hermione asks how she can be of help, and they don’t speak for the rest of the hour.
Draco watches hazily as Harry takes his wand out, firing a volley of wordless spells at the door. Draco couldn’t identify any of the spells if he wanted to, in his state. One of them neutralizes the smell of the coat racks and Draco sighs in relief.
A house elf directs Harry to the library when he asks after Draco. Sure enough, he’s climbing down from a ladder with a book in hand. Harry clears his throat, and Draco looks up, aiming a sweet smile his way. He’s wearing one of Harry’s shirts and an open lounge robe, his legs bare. He must have asked the staff not to disturb him.
Then he fiddles around with the wall and flicks the switch on. He’s already done away with his outer robes, with only a pair of dark slacks and a v-necked tunic. He raises a brow at the food box.
Harry feels his hackles rising. Maybe it’s a problem that he delights in it. “I didn’t do that to make you feel bad. I just thought she might--um. Give me context.”
Scorpius is not bad at potions, but he’s abysmal at cooking outside of prep. He’s happy with this strength, because it means that Dad keeps a close eye to make sure he doesn’t start any fires as he cuts away and listens to the hustle and bustle of Potter’s coming to life. Dad claps his hands and his voice rings out clearly as he starts what Lily calls the kitchen orchestra, sending his army of white-clad staff this way and that as they get ready for opening.
Lily scurries over and hugs her as tight as she can, stubborn tears springing to her eyes again when she feels Aunt Andromeda lean down and kiss her atop her head.
The rest of the page is populated by a painstaking sketch of a ritual array, which Michel has indicated must be drawn with blood--the Dark will heal the wound left behind in the process of taking it. Draco recognizes the runes for devotion, love, and even an archaic one for sacrifice.  The rest are unknown to him. Perhaps they have been lost to time. Perhaps not. With a stab of irritation, he wonders if he might have learned about them at Hogwarts if he weren’t an Omega.
“Visitors of the same ilk of those who caused all of this--this--recent nastiness,” She whispers into his ear. “Aren’t you worried?”
They are all given their assignments for Koldovstoretz. The junior Death Eaters will focus on stripping protections. Some will command the Half-Blood and Muggleborn forces beneath them in this or that wing of the sprawling castle. Others are to seek out specific people. Harry is tasked with killing the school’s headmaster, Sacha Viktorovich. Several people tut disapprovingly at the reminder of him. Harry has heard more than a few complaints about an Omega leading a school and fighting and aiding any kind of resistance, especially a Pureblood from a fairly old family. Harry has numbed himself to playing bounty hunter, but he does take a moment to be grateful that Viktorovich will be extended the kindness of dying instead of being forcibly married off to some lusty Alpha--he is particularly infamous among traditionalists for having no interest in mating.
On the day of Fred’s trials, the halls of the Ministry are lined wall to wall with spectators and reporters from a gauntlet of publications, who are kept powerfully at bay by Aurors at their most intense. Rita Skeeter, as bold as ever, catches sight of Harry and his small entourage and makes a great show of shouting his name. Or, he realizes, as Draco cringes into his side, not him.
Harry laughs, and then leans up with a groan of exertion. He pinches Draco on the side for grumbling, but easily accepts him into his lap. "Accio cellphone," Harry says, calling forth his most useful Muggle contraption. These newest ones have very few buttons and respond to touch alone, and Draco is fascinated by watching Harry work with it. Harry laughs and walks him through the whole thing step by step, and turns the speaker on as he orders for them.
Draco clasps his hands together as they approach, and by the time they sit down, he’s masked his fear by falling into an eerily practiced veneer of a docile Omega. Harry offers him a hand, and Draco aims a serene smile at him that he can’t bring himself to mirror as he takes it.
Her friendly introduction is so at odds with what Draco remembers of that day in the Colosseum. She’d been blank faced and calm, smiling only when she’d collected her shared winnings with Blishwick. He gets the feeling that questioning her about it directly wouldn’t get him anywhere, though, so he doesn’t let on about his curiosity.
Harry quickly catches sight of Pius and Lucius, standing in a corner with their heads bent together. Lucius gives Harry a flinty look when they catch gazes. Harry smiles nastily back at him.
Draco drifts off into a fitful sleep for about a half hour. Harry watches him the whole time, strangely afraid that he won’t wake up again. His fear is unfounded, though, and he’s heartened when Draco complains about being hungry the moment he wakes up. They hail a house elf for delivery. St. Mungo’s patients have menus specific to them--Draco wrinkles his nose in distaste at the steaming porridge dotted with fruit. Harry eats the same thing in solidarity. It is truly as bland as it looks, but Harry’s used to that. He rewards Draco with soft kisses for each bite. Though Draco’s eyes are drooping by the time they’re finished, he complies with Harry’s gentle command to take a quick shower before starting the day. Harry stands by the door in case he’s needed, as always.
The rare, hurt look on Mother’s face makes his chest pang, but it is not powerful enough for him to forgo his growing resentment.
It says something about how desperate Draco is that he obeys without expressing any kind of shyness. He settles himself on his hands and knees then spreads his legs wide, pressing his chest to the bed with a shameless decadence. Harry runs a comforting hand up and down his back, watching fascinatedly at the prickle of gooseflesh following in his wake.
“No, I can’t,” Draco gasps out. This close, Harry can see the tears gathering at the corner of his eyes. He kisses them away. “I’ll come.”
At her instruction, Harry helps him pull his robes up and lower his underwear. Draco holds onto his wrists with surprising strength, and when the Healer points her wand at the lights to dim them--playfully huffing and puffing about silly Europeans and their silly instruments--he lets out a trembling sigh.
My stupid, awful, no-good laptop was being repaired for several days as I worked on this chapter, so about 70% of it was written on my phone. The other 30% was written with my browser continuously crashing. Serious struggle bus moment. Sorry if there are extra mistakes I didn't catch in clean up. As usual, I will fix it to the best of my ability once I've had more sleep.
“Yes,” Draco says, voice cracking. Harry's cock brushes over the sensitive nub inside, and Draco’s back bows. “Oh, please,
He’s never heard the low, rumbling growl that sounds in Harry’s chest. He shudders, pulling back. It takes a burst of courage to do it, but he shuffles and cups his hand into the seat of Harry’s trousers, gratified to feel his cock heavy with arousal. Harry presses into the hand with a groan.
“I’ll get to the point, then. I know you didn’t teach Draco that curse. And I think that leaving a book full of so much original magic in the hands of somebody like Draco is.. dangerous. Unstandardized magic can be finicky.” Theo says.
Theo shrugs a shoulder. “He loves reading. I can understand the thrill of a good book. And this is his heritage.”
Mother is waiting for him, and she smiles sadly up at him as he reclaims Harry’s jacket, throwing it over his shoulders without her help.
She begins toying with a lock of her wavy red hair. After a few moments of fidgeting, she finally says, “I’m not sleeping well.”
“I wasn’t okay, Draco. It helped to have you there to center me. I’m sorry I never explained it to you. I’m not good at, er, talking. But, yeah. I just don’t want you to feel… weird.” Harry’s explanation sounds vague and silly to his own ears. Draco steps close to give him a tight hug.
They bid Harry’s friends adieu, and then return home in a flurry of house elves and suitcases and floo powder. Everything feels lighter, here. The Potter Estate is all high white walls and tall windows framed by thick, floral curtains. Their decorations are still littered about--souvenirs from Harry’s travels, art gifted mostly from Pettigrew and Blaise’s mother, holiday talismans gifted from friends and family that still hang from the doorways vibrating with faint protective magic. It has been almost half a year since they returned, now that they’re mid-March, but it doesn’t even feel like a day has passed.
It’s not uncommon for Draco to wake up like this, these days--like all of existence has narrowed to the ache of lack in his body. Warm, heavy hands sweep down his sides, and as Draco squirms against soft bed sheets below, a rumbling chuckle meets his ears.
“Please, have a seat,” Voldemort says, gesturing at the settee on the other side of the squat tea table beside his chair.
The groundskeeper, a lanky fellow in faded dungarees, raises a hand in greeting. Harry waves back, smiling. “That’s Neville. He’ll help you out if you need anything. Er, the Dark Lord gifted it to me after a really successful mission. That was when I first started working my way up. Must have been about ten years ago now. I hated it at first. Wasn’t anything I was used to.”
His voice is carefully neutral, but Harry knows he’s devastated. Being disconnected from his community at a time like this couldn't possibly be good for his health.
Harry kisses him firmly. Then, with a pleasant fluttering in his stomach, he wraps an arm around Draco’s waist and leads him inside.
“It’s late,” Thicknesse says. He withdraws his wand and casts a wordless tempus, displaying the midnight hour. “You should get some rest. Hopefully, baby Potter won’t make sleeping too difficult for you.”
The first time a would-be bully tries to take advantage of their weekly DADA duels to cast a particularly nasty boil hex his way, Draco retaliates by calling out a spell Harry hasn’t thought of in years--
Ostara is reserved for family, but the Dark Lord’s followers are obligated to celebrate Beltane in his London citadel each year. Draco has been attending for as long as he could remember, enduring his parents’ tutting each time. He’d come to dread making an altar in the morning. He dreaded arriving in the enchanted gardens of the citadel and kneeling between Mother and Father in the grass as they prayed for his fertility. Sitting at one of the many long tables to eat was tolerable only because his friends were there to fill the air with excited chatter, but he was never able to avoid Father’s pea-cocking.
“I’ll think about it,” Harry replies, and that is the end of their conversation. Lucius swans away to find some of his older friends, and they begin talking in a low susurrus.
“It’s alright. Yes, we work on those sometimes, though our firm is more focused on larger things. We’ve just started working on cars.”
Harry smooths Draco’s hair away from his forehead. When his hair is wet, it gets all wavy and curly. It’s one of Harry’s favorite secrets.
Draco raises a hand to his stomach, smiling faintly. “Yes, my husband and I have been blessed. I’ve so wanted this child.”
The twins snicker. Greyback laughs as well. Harry can see, however, that Thicknesse and Dolohov share a dark look.
Harry reaches out to rub his shoulder. Draco weakly pushes his hand away, but it comes right back, and he really
He sucks insistently, and glances up at Harry from underneath his eyelashes, vindicated at the desire reflected in green eyes. Harry lets out a shuddering breath and presses the pad of his fingers down onto Draco’s tongue, and he knows he’s won.
The fat head of Harry’s cock pops past his rim, loose from several rounds of vigorous fucking. Harry slides in on one smooth thrust, his thumbs rubbing over the dimples in Draco’s lower back. He doesn’t move until Draco is squirming, and then, he only does moves to give himself space to bring his hand down on Draco’s arse, the crack resounding in his ears. Draco whimpers, his back bowing. Harry’s given him love taps and playful swats before, but never anything quite like that before.
(I'm a sap. I don't do slow burns, guys. Conflict, sure, but pining is too much for me most of the time 😂)
Aunt Andromeda smiles at her. “I know, flower. But when you grow up a certain way, it’s hard to let things go. You’d think the war would have made it a bit easier, but I guess… after Narcissa, maybe sticking to what he knows is less scary.”
take ballet lessons. I got frustrated when I didn’t get it right the first time, and had my first ever episode of accidental magic by giving my instructor leopard spots. It started a bit of an animal fur trend in high society, and now Mother goes red every time she sees someone wearing any kind of wild pattern.”
Their ridiculously, meanderingly-worded bickering ensues, occasionally interrupted by a quip from a long-suffering Narcissa and a quietly amused Rodolphus. Harry finishes the tent, eventually, to the sound of Bellatrix’s victorious Latin chant.
Of all of them, Scorpius has to be the one who speaks with their grandfather the most, though he couldn’t tell anyone why. Each conversation is baffling and amusing, with Grandfather asking after one thing or the other in their life, and then barely containing his galvanized looks whenever the answer falls short.
,” he snarls, the blinding flash of green light briefly illuminating terrified faces. “If you are so unsettled by a sight such as this, I suggest you reach for your portkeys before aiming your wand at moving targets.”
Harry silences any further protests by appreciatively cupping his cheeks and spreading them. The moment his warm breath hits Draco's hole, he melts. Harry's tongue drags warm and dirty over from his tight balls to his tailbone, and then his plush lips are closing over him as he sucks. Draco whines his approval into the air, swaying eagerly into the feeling. The world is reduced into a haze of sensation, and then Harry dips his tongue into Draco's hole. Unable to stand it, Draco wiggles a hand under his belly and grips his cock, tugging himself in quick, practiced movements. He spurts over his hand, and it feels amazing, but it's still not enough, especially with Harry there.
Draco nods, leaning close for comfort. Harry strokes a hand over his hair. Anezka sniffles, drawing Harry’s attention. She quickly wipes at her eyes.
Theo glances at him sidelong. “You know. Curious. Too smart for his own good. Emboldened by a very indulgent Alpha.”
“Steady on, Antonin, you call the boy a pet every chance you get,” Alecto scoffs, with a roll of her eyes.
His hand is heavy, restricting him from arching up the way he’d really like. He doesn’t remove it until Draco gets the hint and stills, and then he curls his fingers into the hem of the knickers, slowly dragging them down. He pulls it down, humming when Draco’s cock bobs up towards his belly. He settles the hem tightly beneath Draco’s balls, the pressure against the tender skin behind moving Draco to open his thighs further in search of relief.
The attendants are visibly cheered to have Newcastle’s attending nobles on board, and make a great show about providing the best service. Some of the minor nobles joining them in first-class are quick to offer their own wide-eyed greetings. They endure niceties and well-wishes and unsubtle questions on the way to their train car.
Hermione presses her face into Ron’s wildly trembling shoulder, clutching his hand tightly in hers. Ginny lets out a low sob as the army of elegantly raised hands lowers and the Minister asks Fred if he has anything he’d like to say. George throws an arm over Ginny’s shoulder and pulls her close. Harry can see that Fred has caught his gaze from the lower hall. Fred smiles, and George nods back. The two of them have always been able to share entire conversations with looks and gestures.
The fullness of it punches sharp, juddering breaths from him with each shallow thrust, nerves alight with each drag. Harry works his thighs wider apart and changes his rhythm to quick, rutting thrusts, battering Draco’s prostate until he’s tensing up and coming with a painful intensity. Harry grunts and follows not soon after, filling him deep. His knot catches on Draco’s rim, but he pulls out before they can actually tie, and Draco squirms both at the loss and at the feeling of his Alpha’s release oozing out after him.
Something in his voice makes Draco look back down, clearly worried, but Harry surges forth for another biting kiss, licking and nipping, dominating the exchange with a growl. It earns him a loud whimper, which he eagerly swallows down.
Harry is on him in an instant, hands sneaking around his waist to pull him flush. His kiss is all-consuming, tongue exploring Draco’s mouth in a devastatingly focused pattern. Every time Draco gives in to the urge to nip at Harry’s lips, the action is returned with a gentleness that makes him strangely frustrated.
“Ugh,” Harry groans, pulling his glasses off and throwing his head back. “I want to move far away from this island and never come back.”
“I’m okay. The baby is okay. I haven’t used any magic. I promise I won’t die if you look away from me for a second.” Draco says.
“I know my handwriting is bad. I'll translate what’s unreadable another day, but I can’t be here right now.” Harry says.
The next few days are spent with the house staff in a flurry of packing, with the staff rushing about in a rare form. Many of their Newcastle staff have never stepped foot in London, and are doing a poor job of containing their excitement. Draco listens to them gossip with muted curiosity. He’s been living here long enough to decipher their sing-songy Geordie accents, but they’ve fallen into the full-on incomprehensible again. He hasn’t the slightest clue what they could be excited about, in all honesty. It’s not as though they will have much opportunity to explore. They keep mentioning a Lowtown, a name that sounds vaguely familiar, but specifics leave him when he tries to concentrate.
Voldemort has engaged the Steppe Witch in a duel that she’s clearly losing, though Harry does admire her for the utter lack of fear with which she fights. There is nothing but grim determination on her face, completely at odds with the bored frown on Voldemort’s face. They trade powerful whipping blows until the familiar green light of the killing curse zips towards her in an arc, sending her falling listlessly into the snow.
He doesn’t get a reply, other than another low sound of amusement. Later, he will be frustrated that he can’t keep his wits together in the heat of the moment like that. Right now, his desperation is ratcheting up, and he can feel his lips tingling around the shaky pulls of breath he takes in, releasing it on groans and cries that he didn’t think himself capable of. He endures this treatment for all of three minutes before he breaks, yet again struggling not to cry.
They settle into place, and Al watches as Draco begins a quick rhythm, lidded eyes taking him in. When Al plants his feet and tries to fuck up into him, he stops moving, lips quirking up into a smirk. Their little game continues this way, with him checking Al's impatience. He does like it, though--likes sitting back and letting Draco take what he needs, throwing his head back as Al nibbles at his chest and neck, marking that pale skin. He'll probably wear shirts with a high collar for a few days, because he doesn't like to heal the marks Al leaves behind. It's silly and lizard-brained, and he'll never say it aloud, but it gives him a proprietary thrill, to imagine proper Draco Malfoy savoring his mark.
Theo startles as if Harry has struck him. He stares up at him as they’re joined by several of their dark-robed peers. Some of them are giddy with energy, others look as bad as Harry feels.
Draco is asleep before Harry’s even done talking. Harry decides to give him time to rest, gently pulling out when his knot recedes and settling for a series of cleaning charms directly after. Draco curls into him in his sleep, snuffling, and Harry cradles him close. Not for the first time, Harry looks back on how far they’ve come with no small amount of wonder.
