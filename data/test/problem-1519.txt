Lucius, of course, knew his way around the house. It was in the job description, if he were ever given the chance to read it. He knew how to get where he was supposed to be, and he knew how to get there fast. He‘d been whipped one too many times not to know.
There it was! Right next to the bed on the nightstand. He wondered how he could have overlooked it when he first woke up. But then again, his thoughts were kind of occupied with other things.
Harry tried to push the blanket off of him but it felt a lot heavier than anything he was used to. He almost felt crushed by it. That was probably the reason for the sweat Harry felt gliscening in.
……………………
No, in this kitchen was only one person. Although by his clothes one could almost assume him to be a house elf, his hight definetly made him out to be a wizand or at least a muggle. He was facing away from Harry and had apparently not noticed him yet.
Harry took a step backwards and almost stumbled over his own feet.
He did not know what he had done to provoke such extreme messures, but he would not need to. The only thing that counted now was to be good to not anger his master further. The last time he had stolen an apple to feed his son with. He of course knew by now that that was very wrong and that he deserved every second oft he following punishment, but the hardest part he was still struggeling with was, that he had not seen Draco since that punishment was carried out two month ago. With the physical pain he could deal, but not knowing how his son was doing and if he was even alive drove him more crazy than any corporal punishment could ever have done. Not even the house elf were allowed to give him the smallest bit of information and would refuse no matter how hard he begged.
That way he got into the parlor before his Master.
After he heard the footsteps of his master move away he allowed himself the small pleasure of a sigh and called Dobby. He bowed his head as he heard the pop announcing the arrival of the house elf. He was as a slave of the house obviously lower than a free servant of his lord.
He freed himself oft he massive amount of fluff that he was buried under and only now realized what he was wearing. It was a silk pyjama and had nothing on the soft and light shirt he normaly wore. The blue silk that was draping down his body seemed to fit someone a lot more pretentious. He thought that Malfoy would have loved it.
As soon as he heard his Master enter, he tensed and lead his head to the ground so his forehead touched the cold marble. The movement sends a burst of pain through his body. He had no idea for how long he was left here, but it felt like days had passed. His knees were burning and his legs had positively fallen asleep.
Harry immediately realised that sitting down was the worst decision he could have made, since the bed he sat on now was the most fluffy, comfortable and inviting bed he had ever sat on. He desperately wanted to just let himself fall back and escape this whole situation by slipping into a deep sleep again.
He sank to his knees. „My Lord“ he whispered. Nothing he could do now could lessen whatever punishment was awaiting him now, but that didn´t mean he had to worsen his situation by not showing absolute submission. He only hoped that his Lord would keep Draco out of any punishment he had planed.
Harry picked his wand up and immediately looked around to see if something changed. He was still not convinced this was not a trap. But after casting every spell he knew to check for traps or any spells to watch him, he allowed himself to relax a little. He still could not fully let his guard down, but with his wand in his hand he felt a lot safer.
…………..
He now realised he did not have his wand on him. He debated if he should get back to the room he woke up in and see if he could find his wand there or if he should just get out. The room could be a trap, but without his wand he was totally defenseless. He could not apperate or fight. If he were to meet Lucius again, there was no way he would stand a chance the way he was now - wandless and in nothing but silky pajamas.
The person slowly moved into a kneeling position and Harry clasped his wand even stronger. That man still looked down but was now easily recognizable as Lucius Malfoy. The long strands of matted blond hair covered his face and the rags he was wearing looked now more like actual clothing, though still looking old and worn.
The floor of the hallway was marble and shined like it had just been polished. The hallway itself was just as impressive as the room Harry woke up in. The walls were high and the doors along them were just as old and heavy looking as the one he stumbled from.
The Expeliarmus hit him unexpected, and he flew back against the wall. That let to another eruption of pain. Since he was not carrying his wand with him, there was nothing his Master could disarm him off. Not that his wand would be any use for him anyway. His magic was utterly at his Masters discretion. When he first became a slave to his Lord, the superiors feared a rebellion and applied every spell that could counteract that on him. He was nothing without the word of his Master. Literally and figuratively, he could not use magic unless he was carrying out a direct order or asked his Master for permission.
Well, my goal was for these two to talk in this chapter, but I guess we'll have to wait until the next one.
This is a story that focuses on Slavery with all that that entails. There will be discussions of rape and violence. If any of that triggers this, please don't read this story.
“I’ve learned all kinds of things from the muggles,” his tone was suggestive. “Growing up, I was always told that muggles were filthy and depraved. But I had
Harry looked out the peep hole and saw nothing. A prank? If George was fucking with him again…
Harry was trying to find a place to set his gifts amidst a pile that would have made Dudley green with envy when Neville and Ginny approached.
“Only if you have a handcuff kink.”
It was the surprise of it. That had to be it. Malfoy had always been harsh lines, crisp creases, and thick, dark robes. Seeing him at ease last night and suddenly being confronted this morning with smooth contours and soft, pale curves had just been jarring for Harry’s mind. It had upset his mental concept of Malfoy. Made him more… human? Approachable? Less angry-tower-of-impenetrable-malice? Harry was just confused as to where this new aspect of Malfoy fit in.
“Mother,” Malfoy said quietly, “can you have some of my things sent over? It seems I may be here a while.”
Potter did, and Draco wanted to lick his lips. A light dusting of dark hair started between his sculpted pectorals and led down passed his bellybutton and into a nest of curls surrounding his half hard cock. His thighs were firm and thick and Draco couldn’t decide if he wanted them wrapped tightly around his waist or flexing as they drove Potter’s arse back to slam Draco’s cock inside him.
The bartender nodded to Glitter Face’s retreating back. “Always follows the rules, but never has the patience to wait to be approached first. Some find it off-putting.”
Harry looked up and saw that he was right. “Yeah.”
“So,” Harry snapped, “they don’t remember her. She erased herself from their minds to protect them from Voldemort and now they might never recognize her again. And, right before she leaves to try reversing it again, she finds you, of all people, here. Does that make you happy?”
Hermione made a choked noise and cut her glare back to him. “You vile little –” She cut off abruptly and closed her eyes. Harry was fairly certain she was counting to ten. With visible effort, she turned back to Harry. “What is he doing here?”
Potter hummed his agreement.
“Malfoy, I –”
Roberts ground his teeth and answered, “I’m an accountant.”
“Touché, Weasley Number Four.”
Harry shrugged.
“Auror Potter!” Taylor had finally arrived from the back of the house and was taking in the scene with alarm. “Put him down!”
“Yes,” Harry asserted indignantly, “loads of people.”
Potter threw his head back onto Draco’s shoulder and bounced in time with Draco’s thrusting. With a strangled cry, he came. Thick ribbons of cum shot from his cock and his hole clenched around Draco.
“Auror Potter, sit down.”
“I – yeah. Just, right now isn’t a good –”
Her eyes refocused sharply on Harry. “Do not pay me lip service, boy. Take me story and fecking learn from it.” She trailed a finger down Eustace’s wing. “I’ve had eight birds since me husband died, and I’ve named every one of them after him. They all be fecking annoying, talking back, and cause me unending trouble.”
Malfoy must have heard it too because he twisted his body to look back at Harry. He was panting and moaning as he moved. The pace of his hips sped a little more.
Ginny cast and a single bogey flew out of the girl’s nose to bat at her face.
Looking extremely uncomfortable, he spat, “Dobby is making Kreacher promise.”
Malfoy didn’t move. Neither did Harry. They stared at each other, both silently willing the other to break the silence.
“Not a threat?!” she shrieked. “What is he doing here? Malfoy, I swear, if you think – “
Harry almost managed to swallow his laugh.
“Green. Fuck. Green.”
Alecto made a sound of disgust and said, “again. And
Rushing to the source of the commotion, he found Ginny with her wand trained on Malfoy, who was frozen with a tea cup halfway to his mouth.
“Thanks, Neville,” Harry said, “for showing me. It must have been horrible. For all of you.”
Dismissing Harry from her notice entirely, Narcissa stood and made to sweep from the room, commanding as she went, “come, Draco, we’re leaving.”
“Nothing.” Malfoy tilted his face up to her and closed his eyes.
“Excuse me?”
Harry smiled ferally. “I’m going to enjoy knowing that you’ll never be allowed near Pricilla ever again.”
“You used a Silencing charm because your victim started to scream. Do you like screams, Mr. Roberts? Do you like causing pain?”
A bell tinkled as a woman entered. Her stylish brown bob matched her large brown eyes and a cute button nose graced her heart shaped face. Glancing briefly around the room, she spotted Harry and made her way over. “Hey Al,” she said as she sat down. “I was surprised to get your owl. I only have a few minutes.”
“Thank you.”
“Can you walk?” Malfoy asked quietly.
“That’s it? You don’t remember anything else?” Harry asked skeptically.
After long minutes, in which Harry endured the hardest erection of his life, Malfoy took the cock out of his mouth and removed his fingers. With another furtive spell, Malfoy adhered the cock to the cushion with a Sticking Charm. He positioned himself with his round, firm arse hovering just above it.
Harry was aghast. His stomach roiled for a moment before he could even speak.
“Remus? What’s up…you’ve been staring at the walls for the last five minutes. Don’t tell me you haven’t seen the occasional naked woman…I know better…for a fact.”
Being angry had been preferable to being honest. He vented his rage in the way he could rationalize as ’fair’, and it hadn’t been enough. Even when he’d violated the last shreds of his dignity and his oath to the Auror Service, he still hadn’t exhausted that terrible gnawing canker in his soul.
There had been a tiny blurb in the Prophet a few weeks after his conversation with Snape, and it caught Harry’s eye immediately. Apparently, Marcus Flint had been picked up Aurors, and promptly sentenced to Azkaban. The charges were left unspecified, with the vague title of ‘crimes against the wizarding world’. Nonetheless, Harry had discreetly held that issue of the Prophet up as Snape walked by, and gave the professor a grim nod of approval. Snape said nothing, but gave a barely perceptible nod in return, and continued on his way.
That’s my evening. It’ll be me bundled in a bathrobe, watching a movie and some news before bed, looking at my roses and slowly devouring my candies. I really do wonder what Harry is doing tonight. Somewhere, out there in the night, he’s making things happen, none of them wholesome, and there will be hell to pay for whoever gets in his way.
Or the time Draco had gotten soaked in the rain after Apparating directly to Harry’s doorstep, unaware of the downpour in London that day. The man had been drenched in seconds before he could spell a shield up to block the rain, and either needed to spell himself clean, dry and styled again, or just use Harry’s shower and clothes for a bit. That had been the simplest answer, but it had led to one terribly ticklish moment. Harry had forgotten to leave a large bath towel for Draco, and when the man had finished with a brief, warm shower to beat the chill, he’d headed for Harry’s bedroom to change…wearing only a short towel.
“What do you mean? He’s under a spell to act that way…you mean he’s got a choice?”
There were times when he quietly hated himself for his weakness, but how much was a man supposed to bear before he broke? This was his medicine. Sweet and strong, sure and predictable. This made his nights bearable. Perhaps it was weakness, and maybe he should have sought help long ago, but there were things he had never shared with others that tore at him even now, and he'd kept his secrets well. Even Ron and Hermione had never known his private shame, though they knew more about the real history of the war than the press had ever heard.
Then there was no time for thought, because Draco had increased his pace yet again, and this time he pushed deep and hard upon the savagely hungry place inside Harry that exploded each time it was touched. A starry night slid across Harry’s flickering vision, and he wasn’t sure of time or thought…or anything else for that matter. Just sharp, potent waves of pleasure that carried him aloft, while gentle hands, that caressed his cheek and stroked the hair from his eyes, kept him grounded occasionally in the real. Gray eyes bored into green, and Harry was joyfully aware of the soft intensity of Draco’s gaze.
Potter was beautiful in his way, lean and wiry, yet surprisingly soft, constantly wary except in fitful rest, at his fairest when he was unconscious and silent, his face still showing faint signs of the struggle inside him. No one who didn't know what Harry was enduring could have seen what was really going on, or could have grasped at the meaning of it all. They couldn't see in the twitching nervousness or the glazed eyed shamble the person who was clambering across a mountain of suffering that would have broken anyone lesser.
Harry pulled a hand from Draco’s waist and slid it down his chest, bemused by the sight in front of him. There was no question that this was right, but it was still strange to see a flat and definitely male chest in front of him, sweat slick and heaving with urgency. And then there was the swollen and needy prick that twitched restlessly, just inches from where his own body met Draco’s. Alien. It wasn’t as if a few boys hadn’t had ’the horn’ in school years ago, but he’d never been so intimately involved in the process. It was one thing to hear someone tugging at themselves in the bed next to you…it was another to be in the bed with them, the cause of the excitement!
‘Gods! That’s…that’s his prick rubbing up against mine! I can’t bloody believe this! You dream and wank and wait and…and then it finally happens…’

Kingsley handed over another stack of files. Dora winced even as she looked at it, remembering fondly the days when she still loved her job.
Blond hair, slightly mussed, fanned across the surface of the pillow, and Draco’s face, in slumber, was crossed by a tiny smile of satisfaction, as if his dreams were sweet and good. He looked much younger like this, unhardened by tough times and difficult choices. Harry’s heart soared at the sight of his sleeping lover, and it seemed a terrible shame to wake him.
This act shocked Harry completely, both because of its inherently taboo nature, and because of what it suggested regarding Draco’s wants.
“G’nite!!” I giggle and stumble a little, then wobble my way down the porch on my heels. When the lock clicks behind me, I still don’t change my act. I stumble on down the street, around the corner and just a little farther, until the sleek black car rolls up beside me. I have the uncomfortable memory of a hundred cars like this, sidling up to me in the night, windows rolling down to reveal lonesome men with money waiting to be spent, but this car is different, and that life is long gone.
“Ha! Well…I suppose you could handle the penny-ponies at the supermarket parking lot.”
Harry sat in silence. If he rejected this outright, he’d get another lecture about being an overprotective Gryffindor ass (and that was a conversation they’d already had…several times). Draco could be stubborn beyond the patience of mortals when his mind was made up, and Harry could already tell by the tone of Draco’s voice that his mind was made up about this. The best he could hope for was a lack of damage. Draco hadn’t needed a potion in months, and they’d never been closer than they were now. If there was a time to try, then this was it, however nerve-wracking the idea might be.
Big Chicago Part 3…..by Samayel
"Here's your tea. And your plate. Why don't you focus on eating? You need to get your strength up. The spells I put on you won't last forever. If you haven't stabilized by the time they wear off, you'll feel damned rough. It might take awhile to properly answer that question, anyway."
Blaise huffed with irritation. “Hang on a minute!” He slipped a hand over the phone’s receiver. “HEY! I oughta buy a bra for you two tits! That’s my Mom’s spaghetti sauce you’re fucking with! That recipe goes back two hundred years! Shame that recipe and I’ll whack the both of ya! Now shut up! I’M ON THE FUCKING PHONE!”
I stay light-hearted, sounding like I find it all very blasé, but it’s very surreal to hear him speak so openly to me about what he does. He’s been killing people. Real, used-to-be-alive people. He’ll kill more, again, when he leaves me, whenever that moment comes. My happiness, my intoxication with him, being here, and so close to me, is tempered by that sobering reminder. Still, that he says things like this…it means he trusts me. When you think about it, it’s amazing that a man like him could trust anyone. He really believes in me. Not in a convenient, nothing serious on the line but a broken heart, kind of way. He believes in me in spite of the huge risk he took bringing me here. I mean to be worthy of that…whatever it takes.
“What can I say, Dee? There’s something sexy about Filipinos. Just enough Spanish blood to stay horny all the time, just enough Asian to stay small and cute for a good long while. It took a lot to keep my mind off you for this long, but I never forgot, even when I couldn’t say it to you. Don’t lose that number, and be good to yourself…you deserve it.”
“Then make it less complicated. Either I know what I’m getting into, or nothing doing. Spill! And it’s Granger. Not Hermione, not to you.”
Maybe I’ve been isolated by luxury, and maybe I knew what Harry was up to, but the reality of it comes back again now, this time clearer than ever. He’s a one man army…and he’s starting a war.
“I’m sorry. Believe me I’m sorry, but I want you to get well more than I want your friendship, so my command stands. That’s your debt. It’s yours to pay. Goodbye.” He shut the door behind him and upped the wards on it carefully, leaving Draco secure in his room, but he could still hear cries of incoherent rage from behind the wood and stone, and every syllable of anguish was a dagger in his chest.
“You’re bloody taking the piss! I can’t eat all that! I’ll never be rid of your insipid Gryffindor arse!”
“Good job, Theo. I’m glad you were paying attention.”
“Got it. Holy crap…”
“You trust my instincts with regard to sensual prey, do you not, Pansy-dear? I’ve never failed. I always catch the scent of a person’s nature, sometimes before they even know themselves. If you trust those instincts, and you know I do not exaggerate their strength, then you know that I have Potter all figured, as calculated as an equation, mine to unravel if and when and how I choose. For you, the ultimate prize, I’ll put my skills to work howsoever you see fit.”
Draco almost never suffered hangovers, and his tolerance for alcohol was far higher than Harry’s had ever been. When Draco had been a ‘new’ friend it hadn’t seemed important, but as Harry had begun to realize how much he valued Draco’s companionship, that issue suddenly took on new meaning.
“Well,” a voice said in Harry’s ear, causing him to jump, “looks like he’s having fun.” There was that damn word again. Looking away from the porn happening on the dancefloor, Harry saw that Mary had returned and was also watching Malfoy. She handed him one of the shot glasses she held.
He opened the bathroom door and was engulfed in a cloud of foggy humidity. Fucking Malfoy better not have used all the hot water. At the sink, Harry paused as he reached for his toothbrush. It wasn’t there. There was a bunch of other shit, but Harry’s toothbrush was not where it was supposed to be. And where the fuck was his razor?
“Thanks, Molly. And, um… did you get Arthur his ring, too?”
I think… something soft. A nice soft leather or maybe even dragonhide… Something you would wear often and for long periods, if you wanted. I'm tempted to put jewels in as well… but maybe just a polished silver clasp? Who's to say?
"Wards up then, dear?" He gripped his wand and slid it from the holster at his thigh.
-Jonathan making Harry's hair and beard grow out super long at first "You sure? You don't wanna try rocking the Dumbledore look hunny?"
“Come here, darling. We can go to the bathroom and I can help you with that.” His hair was… still a wreck. Pixie hands, sweat, and dust didn't make a very attractive hairstyle. He shrugged and let her pull him to the bathroom. “I will give your family one thing,” she said as she pulled a potion or two out of the cabinet. “Determined problem solvers. This potion worked miracles of Draco’s hair when he was younger.”
Shrugging, Harry took a sip of his tepid tea. “Must be going soft in my old age.”
“You is not asking. Kreacher promised to care for Master Harry, not tell him about it,” he said sourly.
“Ginny and Hermione are furious.”
Harry came back downstairs at seven wearing his Al disguise. He found Malfoy in the sitting room and, so as not to startle him, quickly said, “it’s me, Harry.”
In the sitting room entrance, Harry stopped suddenly.
“Argh! Give me a minute!” Harry stomped after Ginny.
Hermione’s eyes finally turned to him and softened. “Harry, you’re not an Auror.”
“Yes,” Harry said slowly, trying to regain control of himself, “terrible.”
“Dividing the spell patterns let me figure out how the overall design was meant to function. Once I understood the arithmantical approach taken I could further break down the patterns and discern their individual properties.” Malfoy prodded a twitching bit with his finger. “Obviously, the legs are used as transmitters, but the narrowness of the conduits alters the overall sound quality.”
Draco skimmed a hand down Potter’s crack and brushed his bollocks. “Stay still.”
That didn’t make any sense. “What are you talking about?”
Again, the fire leapt to life. “Party at Harry’s, eh? Oh.” Harry noticed that Bill had come with his wand at the ready.
Harry exhaled heavily. “Look, I’ve told you all I can. You got beat up, your mum brought you here, and she’ll be back in three days to collect you.”
“At least I have a mother.”
With one last thrust of his tongue, Draco pulled away and summoned a jar of lube. “You want to be fucked right now, don’t you? While your arse is still too tight.”
“And what? I just sit here until then? Absolutely not. As if I need
Mark gave Malfoy a once over before responding to Harry. “I take it she still doesn’t have a chance?”
Harry looked up when Malfoy trailed off and saw that he was staring at the tripod with the camera on it. On it, a red light was blinking.
He woke the next morning to vague recollections of disjointed dreams. He got up and changed out of his second favorite pair of pajamas, realizing he’d need to burn his favorite ones. He opened his bedroom door a crack to see if the coast was clear and then walked across the hall to use the bathroom.
And then waited some more.
“Yes, but -”
“You lied to Voldemort to save him,” Harry was practically buzzing with irritation. “It wasn’t for my sake.”
Harry was slack-jawed and rock hard. That was the hottest thing he’d ever witnessed. And, he realized abruptly, he’d witnessed it on company time. Awkwardly, he cleared his throat and croaked, “I – that – as a –”
Harry nodded his assent and she knelt by the sofa. She pulled back the cloak and hood covering the person that Harry had avoided looking at too closely. He gasped. It
Mary looked up from her drink and her eyes widened. “Worth the wait. You clean up nice, Al.” Her eyes roved over Harry appreciatively.
Harry wanted to scream, to lash out, but all he could do was watch as Ginny cried and Malfoy stood to the side, watching with a ridged posture and a blank expression.
“Gin –” Harry started.
Slowly, Harry said, “I guess I owe a bit of a debt to the Malfoys. I’d like to make good on it.”
“Mine got torn,” Malfoy supplied with a malicious grin.
“Oh?”
Harry moved passed him and closed the door. After relieving himself, he cleaned his teeth and stared hard into the mirror.
Malfoy, giant arsehole that he was, decided that this would be a wonderful time to start cackling. “Oh Merlin,” he gasped, “I can’t. They think you –! And me! Oh gods, it’s too –” He stopped trying to talk and wiped his eyes as his giggle fit continued.
at.” He swayed and glared at Harry accusingly. “No
Harry might as well have asked if Malfoy enjoyed bathing in feces. With a shutter of disgust, Malfoy shook his head. “What is in their hands?”
“Busy. And loud.” Neville looked around at all the children. “For being so small, they make a lot of noise, don’t they? And it doesn’t stop as they get bigger; they just use worse language.”
Languidly, Malfoy asked, “still going to arrest me?”
“Cool! Victorie says he’s a veela! And that you’re his best mate. But I said Uncle Ron is your best mate and
“Uncomfortable. And then really fucking awful. I thought I was going to be sick. My chest hurt, and… I felt…dizzy.” Realization dawned on Harry.
“About what happened,” Ginny’s jaw flexed, “I didn’t mean to – I just… Harry, you know who he is.”
“But if you finished Auror training…?”
He needed a shower. His skin felt clammy and gross. Forcing himself up, Harry trudged toward the bathroom, stepping painfully on a belt buckle as he went.
Harry let his smile twist into one he knew wasn’t nice. Flashing teeth, Harry began again, “So, Mr. Roberts, it says here you work for Wibbler, Wibbler, and Brice. What is your position there?”
Rolling his eyes massively, Harry said, “have you really never been to a Starbucks? They’re everywhere.”
“Teddy’s birthday party.”
“Hush, you. Everybody, sit at the table and I’ll whip us up something to eat.”
Kreacher gently took Malfoy’s cup and re-filled it. “Master Harry is being right. I is removing the head swelling and mending the bones and cuts, but your body is remembering the hurt.”
Draco was on the brink of orgasm when he pulled away and said, “I’m going to fill your tight arse with my cock and fuck you hard. Are you ready?”
Ginny dropped her gaze first and Malfoy sneered in disgust.
he supposed. He flipped through the papers with a frown. There was nothing in his correspondences that suggested anyone was targeting Malfoy. Nothing. He’d gone through them all twice last night.
Harry had to admit, as strange as this was, Malfoy was worth looking at. With his shirt open and framing his chest, his pale skin almost glowed in the dim lighting. And he was
“Nothing. Momentary relapse.”
‘Green’ was fucking right. Draco hadn’t seen that vibrant shade of green eyes since…
“I’m going to my study.” Harry stood and left.
"Not at all," Malfoy insisted, suddenly brisk, "merely further adjusting assumptions."
She pulled out her wand and slowly pointed it at the Third Years. They clung to each other in fear until a plump girl with a Hufflepuff tie let go and straightened. She lifted her chin and faced Ginny grimly. “It’s okay,” she said, and her voice sounded so, so young.
“Thanks,” Harry said awkwardly.
Draco arched a disapproving eyebrow and darted a hand out to grab a fistful of soft hair. Yanking back harshly, he calmly said, “if you want to be my good boy, you will say, ‘yes, Sir.’”
I’ll kill him.” She snarled and turned back to the kitchen entrance.
“Yeah, thanks.”
“You have also saved each other. You pulled him out of that fire. And you can be sure that he knew exactly who you were when the Snatchers brought you to the Manor. Also, never forget,
The desk across from Harry was empty. Unlike every other Auror in the department, Harry didn’t have a partner. Without a partner, he wasn’t given casework, thus, no paperwork. But that was fine. He preferred it that way.  He didn’t need someone always underfoot, basking in awe at the Great Harry Potter and forgetting that they too were professionals and should do their damned job. His last attempt at having a partner had been disastrous. Whussername had just stood there gawking at him as he ran into a burning building. He’d barely made it out in time. The building fell just as he handed off an armful of kittens and lost consciousness from smoke inhalation.
“Ugh,” Harry articulated. Mentally shaking himself, he put the sofa out of his mind and set about wiping the smirk off Malfoy’s face. He found his Muggle Brick and held it out to Malfoy.
Chagrinned at being caught out, Harry gave a half shrug. He’d have to work on being more convincing tomorrow.
The walk through the Leaky Cauldron was awkward for Harry. Conversations slowly died as they made their way through and eyes fixed on Malfoy. Harry made a mental note of anyone who’s stare looked a little too unfriendly. If Malfoy noticed their looks, he ignored them.
“And what exactly is in this paperwork I’d need to sign?” Harry hedged.
Harry thought,
“After you told me so much about Mary here, I just had to meet her.” Malfoy smiled handsomely at Mary.
“Again? Are you alright?”
Trying not to let his hand betray any trembling, Draco pulled them back and gently prodded Potter’s arse. His fingertip slid in easily and Potter pushed back for more. Squeezing Potter’s arsecheek hard enough to bruise, he removed his fingers.
Malfoy stayed in the library for the rest of the afternoon. That suited Harry perfectly fine. He was able to respond to the letters he’d gotten back from his contacts and go over the records Mary had sent over. Nothing new, but he was still hopeful that some bit of important information would turn up. By the time dinner rolled around, he felt he’d been very productive.
Harry nodded.
“No.”
“What is all that shit in the bathroom?” Harry snapped. “And where is
Lowering his hands, Harry tried to joke, “I could take her.”
going to be inside it. Soon. It was a heady thought and Draco moaned into Potter’s arse.
Harry startled as a heavy glass was thumped onto the table.
Harry was about to slink off in disgrace when Malfoy rolled his eyes and shook off his worshippers. He took three strides, all perfectly synced to the beat, and was right in front of Harry.
“From a muggle in that horrible,
The bartended levitated a fresh pint over and said, “this one’s free, compliments of the pretty ladies at the bar.”
“My clothes fit fine,” Harry protested, “and they’re not secondhand, just… well-worn.”
Harry looked at her with eyes he’d changed to blue, ran a hand through his blond hair, and smiled. Al was the name he’d chosen years ago for his current disguise. “Good to see you, Mary,” he said.
“So are dragons.”
He undressed quickly and examined a pair of dark blue jeans and the black t-shirt Malfoy had chosen for him. The jeans were a tight fit and Harry had to wiggle ridiculously to get them all the way up. The shirt was worse, and Harry suspected that it might actually be Teddy’s.
Malfoy sighed and looked at Harry. “Last night wasn’t my first pub night.”
“Sir,” Malfoy paused and swallowed hard, “I’m escorting Weasley here back to Gryffindor Tower.”
Potter did move then. He bucked so hard, Draco had to grab his hips to prevent being dislodged. He pinched Potter’s arse in warning and continued to thoroughly rim him. This wasn’t something Draco usually indulged in, but he wanted Potter’s hole to be a sopping, quivering mess when he finally shoved his cock inside it.
“Probably. Touchy arsehole, that one is. Not quite as horrible as I remember though,” George mused.
“Green,” Potter answered swiftly in a gravelly voice.
” Malfoy said with a feral grin, “the sight of this beautiful woman is intoxication enough.” Malfoy picked up Mary’s hand from where it was still resting on Harry’s arm and kissed it. He placed it back on the table, leaned back in his chair, and licked his lips before knocking back the shot he’d brought with him.
He considered casting a Pertificus totalus, but dismissed that thought immediately. He wanted to find out what happend. and he couldn‘t do that if the mouth of the only available source was cast shut. But he left himself that option open, in case there were going to be complications.
Harry stumbled back through the hallway he came from. Scrambling around a few corners and hallways and leaned against a wall.
The only reason he survived the last encounter, was, because they were both surprised by each other, he was sure of it. Although Lucius did not seem to have that graceful energy around him that usually seemed to consume the surrounding air. And the kitchen was not a place Harry would have expected to see the head of the Malfoy dynasty. But again he decided not to linger on that thought for too long and just try to find his way out. The first step would be to find his way back to the room in question to get his wand and go from there.
He could not wrap his mind around anything that just happened. He was in this giant house with no idea how he got here and the only person he had seen since waking up was Lucius Malfoy, who was the father of his arch nemesis and a follower of Voldemort, no less. Did that mean Voldemort won? Was he a prisoner here?
(See the end of the chapter for
He had to get out.
The first thing Harry noticed about him was not however his clothes or his bowed posture. It was his long blond almost white hair that hang mattet down his back. He could have recognised these once flowing strands everywere.
„Lucius… Malfoy…“
Harry was moving directly towards it. It felt like the door had put itself purposefully in Harrys‘ way to make him come in. Again, Harry thought it could be a trap, but by now he was so tired of these endless hallways, that he didn‘t find it in him to care.
He got up again and moved towards the door, slowly and with his wand lifted. He wasn‘t sure what he was expecting to happen, since nothing had happened yet, but he was not ready to trust anything here and regret that decision.
With his head bend down, not daring to lift his head to not aggravate his Master further, he could only guess the reaction to his action. Had he taken to long to get back up? Should he have stayed down? There was no way to rectify anything now, had he done something wrong.
He walked through a few of identical hallways and started to come to the conclusion that maybe he was left alone in a giant maze. But then he heard a ratteling noise, that sounded a lot like metal on metal. It reminded him oft he pots and pans in Mollys kitchen that never quite seemed to evade each other as she made them fly. He followed the familiar noise through another hallway whose doors looked slightly smaller and a bit less gaudy.
He slowly knelt next to the door. The marble was cold and hard on his already abused knees, and he could only hope, he wouldn‘t be left there for long. Well, he corrected his own thoughts, maybe it would be nice to stay just a little longer. This position might be agonizing to his knees and back, but at least he was spared worse pains that his punishment would entail.
He sat down on the bed and still could not make any sense out of this whole situation. The next step was to find the exit and then someone to contact.
Constructive critism is also always welcome.
He pondered for a moment if he should stay lying on the ground since his Lord had put him in that position, but shortly came to the conclusion, that he should rather show a more subservient position. He moved back on his knees and laid his hands open on his thigh, palms up. He tried to suppress a flinch at another burst of pain as he moved.
Harry grabbed the teapot and filled the cups to the brim. He handed one to Malfoy and said, “cheers.” Harry downed his and sat across the table from Malfoy. He poured himself another cup of tea and arched an eyebrow at Malfoy.
“I’m an idiot,” Malfoy muttered as he tapped the music note.
Mouth tightening, Malfoy said, “I want answers. I waited like a good little boy and now you’re going to tell me why the fuck I’m here.”
“I’m not sorry I killed your aunt,” Mrs. Weasley blurted.
George’s lips twitched. “Ron doesn’t like spiders.”
“So, I’m just kicked out of your club?” Surely there had to be something more.
Harry realized it wasn’t just his adrenalin making it feel like everything was vibrating. It
“How?”
“Yes?”
The floor stopped moving as Neville and the boots accompanying him halted. A few drops of blood dripped onto the stones directly beneath him before Neville raised his head and Harry could finally see the scene before him.
“God no,” Harry said more emphatically than intended. “I’m not suggesting anything. I was just saying, is all.”
“Damnit,” Malfoy muttered. “foiled by ekricity again.”
Groaning loudly, Harry thread his hands through Malfoy’s hair and felt his cock hit the back of his throat. Malfoy sucked cock like he really did love it. His tongue swirled around the head every time he pulled back and then engulfed him again down to the base. His moans sent vibrations all the way up Harry’s spine.
hadn’t opened his eyes and she guided him to lean back onto her. She whispered into his ear and Malfoy shivered. She slid one arm around his chest to play with a nipple and her other hand went to his throat. She bit his earlobe and whispered again. Malfoy grabbed his cock and started stroking himself. She was scanning their audience again and whispering continuously. Whatever it was she was saying must have been something because Malfoy’s hand moved faster, and his breathing was coming in gasps and pants. He threw his head back onto the woman’s shoulder and appeared to be fighting to not let his hips jerk. His bollocks were high and tight, and Harry was slack jawed.
"I'll think about it… and I'll let him know, too. If he says yes, you have both of us."
I’m yours as you are mine.
’ Ugh. That wasn’t helpful right now. Maybe just some nice trousers and a nice shirt? He didn’t want to make it seem like he cared
“Mrs. Malfoy? I was wondering if you’d let me invite you to tea tomorrow, at Grimmauld Place? I sort of can’t go in to work without a partner, and I’ll probably be lonely and bored out of my mind without your son around to antagonize me.”
“...don't tell me you're dying or have some crazy incurable disease-- you have the absolute worst luck--”
against her desk as she drummed her fingers. "Ooh! Somewhere fun and exotic, I hope, duck. Get that pasty boy out of his robes and onto a beach!"
A few of the older cousins shared a look. Hm, they seemed to pick up that he was single but definitely not happy about it. How very interesting. Brigitte raised an eyebrow at him. “Well, I guess you don’t have to join. It’s a fake club after all. But I’m a single mom barely out of my teens, Valerie is divorced, Gisele doesn’t much care, and Bas is a Disaster Bi.”
“Potter! Please tell me you didn't get a snitch tattooed recently!” Draco pleaded, face and neck quickly pinking.
“I love it! That’s so cute!”
Euthymia just chuckled. “You know… tattooed wedding rings are on the rise… just so you're aware.”
“You’re still going on about that? You’ve really got to leave some things in the past. We get it. You’re the Boy Who Lived Twice,” Draco teased him, leaning over to pick up the file. “Interesting, though I don’t see why they’re sending us.”
Never mind that his mother had said nearly the same thing.
Comment if you liked, loved, or hated it! Ta for now!
much like my nephew. I thought you were him for a moment!"
"I'll make sure to."
Hope you enjoyed! Comments are my bread and butter, so please let me know what you thought! I hope to bring chapter 6 to you soon! Cheers!
By law, you
Harry took the teacup that had filled itself and floated up to him. “He does, I know he does.” Harry took a sip and closed his eyes for a minute. “It looks like I’m going to be stalking him again,” he tried to joke, but the atmosphere was too tense.
“Leesy,” Narcissa spoke, closing her eyes. “The Manor is lost and we won’t be returning. Please, pack our things… and Draco’s… and bring them here. Make sure you aren’t caught. Quickly!” And the elf Disapperated with a crack. Lucius was already kneeling by the fireplace, calling in favors and throwing his name around to get a Portkey ready for them. The Manor was not an option, and they weren’t sure which Death Eater would think to look for them in France. It was too risky. He stood shakily and brushed the soot from his trouser knees.
They spent a good amount of the evening speaking about bonding jewelry, each married person there showing their ring (or other piece) to Draco in turn. Though neither Derrick or his mother had magic, their rings held just a touch of it, from their respective spouses. Sapphire explained that she and Remy both had necklaces, because they each worked with their hands so often. All in all, it was a good night, and they insisted he come to Sunday dinner to meet the
He shifted nervously from foot to foot, hands in his pockets. “...I choked on the Mandrake leaf and swallowed it… I might need another one.”
The Malfoys are summoned to Hogwarts to receive the worst news imaginable.
Charlie chuckled, looking down at himself. “Better than when I got in here, so that’s something, at least. I think it looks a lot worse than it actually is. Or should I say
“Yeah. Yeah, I think he’d like that, wouldn’t he? Probably wouldn’t be happy until he has a rose and lavender bath drawn for himself…” Fuck, he loved that brat. Narcissa laughed quietly, as if hiding giggles into her hand.
He saw it before any of them did. Though the twins and the ministry worker Weasley were fighting valiantly, they hadn't seen Dolohov Apperate in behind Pius Thicknesse.
Thank you for your concern, however I am capable of protecting myself. You don’t always need to be a Savior. I should have seen it coming a mile off, but I didn’t, so now I’m paying for it. And we only have the best case statistics because half the time you’re put on cases that would otherwise be suicide attempts, but alas, nothing is capable of stopping a stubborn Boy Who Lived ten trillion fucking times. Could you honestly see me as an Unspeakable? I wouldn’t be able to talk about my work to anyone. Now suggest it again.
That was when Euthymia knew for sure there was something between them that went unsaid.
Clearly, this was important.
“Hi.”
Your love,
“I’m sending Draco a letter about it this afternoon. If he agrees, you have us both. If he says no… We’ll need to talk about things a little more. I hope that’s alright for now.”
"I'd like to… but they're all dead. That's kind of a problem when trying to get to know people… Besides, my grandparents apparently died before I was born."
“Of course not.” Harry stood and wrapped Luna in a hug. “Thanks. For being you.” She immediately snuggled into his arms, holding him back just as tightly.
Draco grinned at their playful teasing. "And Pansy, she's between husbands. It's truly devastating."
One more friend to ask after, the illustrious bachelor Blaise Zabini, who coincidentally didn't live too far from Grimmauld. Harry apparated to the closest Apparition spot to Blaise's muggle flat and walked the rest of the way. It was a lovely Sunday morning, apart from the grey clouds that suggested an afternoon drizzle.
Harry had been her first client, which set her shop firmly on the map of Diagon Alley in the best way possible. Not that she’d ever use his name in advertising, but when asked where he got his tattoos, Harry always gave her name and address. Euthymia Baxter, 73 Diagon Alley, Queen of Wands Tattoo Parlour, established 1998.
“Jeez, guys, you know I’m not the one to ask about this kind of thing…” He looked between his two friends. “Ron, I don’t think ‘eating for two’ is a thing, coz your baby is still so small. You can’t make her eat if she doesn’t want to. That said… Mione, maybe have a bit of toast and egg..? Are you still feeling sick?”
“And I suppose you think he deserved being turned, don’t you?”
“He does quite like them both, though my son has always been partial to a bit of vanilla bubble bath added to an essential oil soak.”
I had this idea last night at 3am and only wrote down the title and tag line before I fell asleep.
“Researching to become an animagus?”
“Well… He makes impossible things seem less unattainable.”
“Really..? That many?” Did
“Goodbye, Potter,” Pansy sighed, waving him off.
Harry Potter did not return to Hogwarts that September. Nor did Ron Weasley or Hermione Granger. Instead, they spent the year on the run from Death Eater and snatchers, all the while hunting for horcruxes. The diary, the ring, and now the locket had been destroyed. The Golden Trio had been captured by snatchers and brought to Malfoy Manor.
So intense. His eyes are still hypnotic, which is why I spend a lot of time staring at the floor. I feel shaky when he tells me to look at him while he’s talking to me. I get lost for a second and come back wondering what he‘d just said. It scares me that after watching out for myself carefully for almost seven years, one pair of green eyes could put me this close to fucking up my situation. I can’t stop remembering the way he looked, standing over Flint and the others. I know he isn’t God, but I still feel intensely self conscious of the mistakes I’ve made, and of the shallow, stupid things I’ve done. He knows I’m scared. Of him. Of change. Of death. He can tell, but tenderness has no place here. His actions say he won’t hurt me if he doesn’t have to, but I can’t believe in anything…I can’t afford to.
So many moments where Draco had looked like he was about to crack and say something he was afraid of. So many glances that hinted at more than lust. Looks that had spoken of growing respect and a comfortable familiarity. But when Harry pushed the matter, Draco always clammed up, shutting down any semblance of affection or intimacy, treating Harry with total indifference, and always, always hanging the threat of terminating their acquaintance and its ‘benefits’ over Harry’s head.
At the door the room I still shake with contained rage. I have to still myself…I have to silence the thunder of my heart. I MUST be in control or this will spin far out of my ability to manipulate it. I have not been as strong or as distant as I should be. I must be numb, soulless and heartless, without connection and without weakness. This is the state I place myself in before I dare to cross this threshold again. On the other side of this door is only an obstacle, an impediment, a difficulty that stands between me and a simple goal.
There was a place inside him that he had always thought was empty...a place his chill, cool parents had never filled, and his classmates and dalliances had only brushed against. Somewhere inside he had always been alone, always restless, always angry...until now. In Harry he'd glimpsed a hint of what he'd wanted without knowing it. A tantalizing whisper of what it must be like to share instead of taking...to give without expecting something back...and enjoy it in a way that was more sublime than even his most lurid fantasies.
“Theo. Every guy in Hogwart’s has a dick, same as every guy in the world, but there are dicks…and there are cocks. There’s a difference. I hope Potter has a cock.”
Harry grabbed his coat and opened the door, ushering the two of them into the street. There was nothing predictable about this day. Everything seemed upside down, and the calm, rote predictability of his office seemed far away. When he thought about it, that just seemed a little more like the way things ought to be.
And he’d lost it anyway.
“You know, Tonksy, if it’s any comfort at all, it ain’t any better on my side of the fence. Deirdre has been waiting ‘til I get home to give me an earful of what she thinks about all this, and lemme tell ya, it hasn’t been an earful of poetry! We’ll get through this yet. We’re two of the best in our field, and you know what? If worst comes to worst, maybe we get bumped back down the ladder and our rep takes a hit. Maybe they take us off this and put someone else in the hot seat, but we’ll go down fighting. Are you with me?”
“It takes a rare person…to not want some kind of immediate, horrible revenge. The kind you know I could deliver for you. Power corrupts. Absolute power…corrupts absolutely. You still don’t want him to die. There…there are ways…I wish I was more like you.”
It wasn’t like I didn’t try to make them happy. I tried. I guess I learned a few things from them after all. I figured out faster than most people that, you have to learn to like yourself, because you can’t really count on anyone else to do it for you. They gave me a good solid definition of what a complete pack of assholes would be like, and I pretty much gauge right and wrong by just doing the opposite of what they would have done. The best day of my life was the day my godfather took me away from there.
Most of his time was spent in the Middle East, which certainly explains his tan. As it turns out, he speaks Farsi in three dialects, and can read and quote the Koran like a native. He doesn’t have a religion of his own, but reads of them all, trying to piece some kind of sense out of the mish mash of ideas that humans have had over the last eight thousand years. He mustered out of the service after four years, taking a contract with his current employer for reasons he doesn’t share, but there are hints that he has a strong personal reason for his choice.
“Yeah?”
Who knew thee too well:-
What if it isn’t here for me? I believed in him…in there…where there was nothing else to believe in…but it all sounds crazy now. Everything is surreal and I feel dizzy and sick and nervous. I’m not used to decisions. I didn’t make any for seven years, except the silent kind that ensured my survival, and I don’t think I know how to make them anymore. If I knock on the car’s window, will I get dragged away by guards or told to fuck off? The door opens while I stand there, wearing the sexy little outfit that Blaise bought me seven years ago. I’m a prison whore in an outdated skirt and top, stinking of brimstone and sulfur from the hell I belonged in. What will the man getting out think of me?
Harry opened his office door and stopped cold, mouth agape is complete shock while he stood stock still, taking in the spectacle before him.
They know not I knew thee,
Draco had grown desperate, sweat drenched and cursing between hastily spoken phrases in Latin. Harry almost thought to end the duel, when Draco finally surprised him. The wand was firing spells in rapid succession, but Draco brought up his free hand and flung lesser spells by will alone…wandlessly. The Stinging Hex set Harry’s arm on fire briefly, and he was forced to fight fire with fire, watching Draco’s smug smile fade to shock when Harry cast both a fresh Protego from his wand and flung a matched set of Freezing Charms from his hand, shifting Draco into the role of defender.
“You want to come? You want to be on top?”
Chapter 9: Good Advice
"And you're really over the whole waking up naked with a goose egg on your head and a crusty tie, right?" Harry just wanted it all clear before hand, mostly because giving in too easy would just seem out of character and make Draco needlessly suspicious. The situation was prickly enough without negotiations breaking down altogether.
“Take a bath in private, but the view was too nice to ignore? Why, thanks Potter. That’s sweet of you. Do me a favor, will you? I left my robe and coat on the far bench. My comb is in there, and I’m not leaving without finishing my hair. Be a good sport and bring it here, eh?”
“You…you mean…no! You can’t possibly be serious!? That’s…that’s…it hasn’t any bearing on this! What he fancies or doesn’t fancy is irrelevant! I was passed out on the floor of my office after all but mauling him! I don’t care what anyone else excuses…I can’t excuse it! Students are inviolate! Worse…ignoring that I was derelict because the student in question had some sort of ‘crush’ is completely irresponsible!”
Two gentlemen of distinction strolled through London, feet somewhat unsteadily placed upon the road to unknown adventure. There was no telling where it might take them…and they didn’t really care. At least it wasn’t the office.
Harry smiled an almost Slytherin smile, and answered matter of factly. “I’ll leave when I’ve seen you eat a decent breakfast. That’s why I asked Dobby to let Ron know I’d be late. I know how stubborn you are. You will feel better with food in you, and I’m not afraid of Snape, so it looks like it’s eat or tolerate my presence forever.”
*Tasssked-*
The hands loosened and Hermione slid back to her own feet, stunned into silence by Draco's sudden intensity and certainty. It was all an act...the preening and posing, the condescension and sneers. Under it all was a survivor whose strengths were all saved for those precious, terrible moments when it mattered most. In his certainty she found her own...and pushed the hands away.
“We’re on vacation! You’re with Harry. The flying is done and we haven’t got a car. We’re in Michigan, and we’re right by the lake. Duh! I’m renting a boat and going fishing!”
I can hear it. The faint slur in his voice. The pupils are dilated like he just had his sixth or seventh cocktail and can’t remember what he was going to say next. I keep the conversation light, and try to smile a lot. He gets distracted when I smile. I act my part, and he’s fallen for it…hook, line and sinker.
Harry was straightening and smoothing his clothes, hating his flustered inability to respond, and getting set to walk away. Just as he turned his back to walk out, Malfoy finally spoke.
Maybe I’ve gone too long living a life with no meaning beyond seeking my own pleasure. I’m a creature of comfort and I know it, but that doesn’t mean I can’t do better. I can have Harry, and everything else besides, and still be doing something that has a real purpose…not just getting rich or getting by.
“I...I found it in the attic. The day I was...I was going to kill myself. After Yves. My grandparents were furious. I spent the summer almost entirely alone...except for the elves. All I could think was that the next year would be worse. I wasn't even sure how to do it, but I was thinking of ways...spells or potions...anything that wouldn't hurt too much. I just wanted it...over.
”Wait! How can I just…you know…have sex with man to find out if it ’works’ for me? Doesn’t that seem odd to you at all? It does to me! I mean…whole different kind of body. No breasts. No vagina. Different hips. Whole different sounding voice in bed. It’s just weird!”
I couldn't have imagined that he'd snap bolt upright and hit me! I mean, I never saw it coming, and it caught me completely off my guard. It was like he'd gone insane, and he looked like he was ready to kill. I don't show much affection of any kind to anyone, and I wasn't in any mood to be shown any kind of ingratitude, much less a punch to the face. He's small, and wiry, but he is strong under that wretched looking, waifish surface.
He stomps to a cabinet and unlocks it. There are bottles and bottles of pills and liquids. He snatches one and I can’t help flinching when he turns.
“I feel very much the same about it, and I think it speaks well of you that you’ve already seen the silliness of it all. That’s a sentiment usually only found in people of maturity, but there’s a bit more to it than that. You spent your years at Durmstrang with no close associates…am I right?”
The room was silent for a moment, all the parties at a complete impasse. Then Harry spoke, breaking the shocked silence, and his words stole the edge from Minerva’s fast growing outrage.
Harry had exploded. There was nothing else to call it. He’d nearly died and his last thoughts had only been of seeing Draco again. Not his parents, not Sirius or Dumbledore, just Draco…the boy he’d been shagging for three months on the sly. That was all it had been for Draco, or he would never have casually asked something so patently disgusting of Harry. The things Harry said that day were terrible, and he regretted them with every breath he’d ever taken since. It had hurt, to have such a thing asked of him, and he’d hurt Draco back in kind. It had ended so terribly, only to end again, forever, when Draco was killed in a cheap hostel in the north of France, trying to make a secretive journey back to England and the Malfoy estate.
-Harry
Myrtle shrugged and sniffled a little bit. It had been a bit terrifying for her to see Draco's death, and then his recreation. She had been the youngest ghost before him. “Unfinished business, I suppose. That's what they all say.”
The Dark Lord had taken his dignity, his wand, even his bed for his own personal use… And that was all before he tortured Narcissa and Draco for his failure.
It’s not just to keep myself busy. It’s for the independence it gives. And, yes, making up for my past sins. What I did in the war is unforgivable, but doing the work we do can at least help me start to make up for it all. And also… I don’t want to just depend on house elves, and mother, and the family vault, all the time. I’ve got to learn to lean on myself.
(See the end of the chapter for
He stayed and chatted with the pair of them for the duration of Draco's appointment, witnessing the tattoo form over that pale skin. When Euthymia was done and the dragon moved for the first time, coiling around Draco's bicep and fluttering its wings, Harry gasped and Draco grinned.
to work up the nerve to give me his number.”
“...I do really enjoy listening to him talk. EVen if he’s complaining about me. Or insulting me.”
Love it? Like it? Hate it? Let me know! (But please be nice)
"He might not have… and that's okay." Remy gave him a smile. "Would you have been ready for him to return your attentions then?"
“She complains about me? Was I really that bad of a boyfriend?” If word ever got out to Draco, they’d never be together. Draco deserved only the best in romantic partners.
“What? No- No, in my third year. I watched Lupin transform. He forgot it was the full moon…” Harry waved his hand, not entirely sure how to finish. She stared at him for a few moments, as if not entirely sure what to say.
"Only five courses tonight, Harry, I hope that's alright." God, he'd be stuffed by the time he left.
Glancing to Brigitte, Draco shook his head. "No. I've no partner, either." Brigitte shrugged, reaching for her glass. (Draco was almost certain she was just drinking sparkling water.)
"I don't want to overwhelm him… or make him think it's just because he was turned. Also, I have absolutely no idea about courting. I had no idea people still did that.” Wasn’t that from… the last century?
“It’s my pleasure, Draco, really,” she assured him, pulling him into a hug similar to the one he received from Sapphire earlier. “Now, off to bed with you.”
“I believe we are on a first name basis, now, Harry. Unless you’d like me to call you ‘Mr. Potter’ like you’re still in school.” She leaned down and kissed his cheek. “This is a good thing we have, you and I.”
The Wolfsbane meant it wasn’t painful, but I think I’d prefer the pain. I was aware of every bone in my body changing and shifting, of pieces of fur pushing through my skin, and my teeth shifting and changing in my own mouth
“Perfect.”
And so, the three of them drafted Harry Potter's Queer Eye submission plea, without the man's knowledge.
That sobered Ginny up pretty quickly. Shit… Harry could absolutely use the help these men would provide… Things had been hard on him the past few years and it didn’t take a genius to know that their friend— their brother— needed to get out of his rut. Needed some tough love. Needed some genuine, kind-hearted meddling from 5 gay men.
Ask and you shall receive. Might’ve done a bit of
He nodded, arms crossed. “Yeah. I know.”
“Hullo, Prof— Headmistress. Sorry, force of habit.”
With the elf's promise, Narcissa smiled. Lucius cleared his throat and took his wife's hand, her other hand grasping Draco's. The time came for the portkey and Lucius uttered “Thank you, Leesy,” before giving the password. In a gut-twisting pull, the Malfoys were gone from the Chateau, and it was like they'd never even arrived. Tears slipped down the old elf's wrinkled face. Poor, poor Master and Mistress… Poor young master Draco.
And they hadn't talked about it since.
He couldn’t help but to laugh at that, trying to keep the bitterness he felt from the sound. “This is a break.” She went up on her toes and kissed his forehead.
It would be seen as a deep shame on the already tarnished Malfoy name, the wizarding world thinking the heir had taken his own life… Albus knew this, and Lucius knew this.
Dumbledore was… very much dead. Harry approached the body, moving slowly through the gathered crowd of students and staff. With wands raised, the Dark Mark slowly vanished from the night sky.
“Oh, no, I’m… I’m allergic to silver, I’m so sorry.”
Draco frowned slightly, cocking his head. “What now?”
“That, or there are more nefarious purposes behind his disappearance. As I said, we were hoping you may be able to determine the intent.” Harry shook his head, hands curling into fists at his sides.
“I don’t know if they’d consider a bloke from the UK… they’re in Georgia, yeah? I guess we’d just send in a letter… or a sort of audition video over email… Do you want to be made-over, Ron?” she teased with a smirk.
Gregory Goyle and Vincent Crabbe each threw a hex at Harry, who cursed under his breath and leapt behind the armoire for cover.
Draco sighed, taking the cup of tea and giving him a grateful nod. “Someone is always going to think they have the path to a better world. What is it, this time?”
straight in.
“I’m Gabriel Le Blanc, and when I bonded with Devin, I changed it to Gabriel Torneau. And when Alistair and Storm married, he went from Alistair Roots to Alistair Frey. It’s more common than you think, Draco.” A husband taking his wife’s name? And they considered that sort of thing to be
As was the case with most things, the grand plan to nominate Harry for Queer Eye had gotten easier once Ron’s lovely wife got involved. Being a relatively high-ranking Ministry official made her investigation easier when paired with her natural determination and desire to help her friends. Only a month after Ron’s brilliant idea, Hermione Jean Granger-Weasley sat her husband and sister-in-law down at her kitchen table, laptop open, parchments spread, and hair frizzy in excitement.
As I said before, I'll be watching Teddy this weekend, and I'll be shifted as soon as the moon rises. Not long now, darling. You'll be in my arms before you know it.
