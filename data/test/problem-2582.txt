“Potter, I don’t know for sure, but it’s possible, isn’t it? We can’t risk it. Plus, whoever it was had access to a lot of information on Dark Magic.”
“Potter? You there?” Draco says, interrupting Harry’s thoughts like a bucket of cold water. Harry blushes, because he knows that Draco knows exactly what he was just thinking about, judging by the smirk on his face. But before he can reply, the host greets them. He recognizes them immediately, gushing to Draco about how it’s been so long and how they had missed him, his thick French accent making it a bit difficult to understand him. Draco remains the polite diplomat throughout it all, and Harry just tries to nod along and smile whenever it’s appropriate. The host leads them to their usual table, and Harry automatically cranes his neck to spot the little hallway that leads to their secret bathroom.
“Did you know Dresden was sending payments for Annie’s treatments?”
"Let’s get him to St. Mungo's right away," Ron starts. "Merlin almighty. How can this be? You saw him get ripped apart that day." Harry cringes at the memory. He shuts his eyes and squeezes Draco a little tighter.
“I love him.”
“Draco, you know that what happened wasn’t your fault, right?” Harry asks finally, and the words echo hollowly in his memories, back to a time where his own wife used to fruitlessly ask him the same question. Draco nods minutely and looks away.
“I think I’ll cast a cushioning charm on the ground tonight.” He says uncertainly, looking to Harry for some type of approval.
“So how have you been?” Draco seems to ask suddenly.
“How are you feeling?” Harry changes the subject, hoping to lighten the mood back up. He is confused as to what he might be doing wrong, but desperately wants to make amends.
I don't say any of this to him of course. I just let him hold me while he cries, allowing the tears to stream from my own eyes because honestly what does it even matter anymore? As a Malfoy I was taught my entire life that crying is a sign of weakness, but none of my father's teachings could prepare me for this moment.
"Tomorrow starts my ovulation week." She says, already getting lost in the warm embrace of sleep.
The world swims into focus, a swirl of color and sound before Harry’s eyes as he lands unevenly inside of Draco’s apartment. He startles at the sudden jab in his throat, a wand pressing roughly against his neck. Harry freezes instantly, blinking rapidly in an attempt to regain his vision. Draco stands before him, hair askew, cheeks pink, panting heavily. His face is twisted into an ugly sneer of anger, one Harry has seen before but not been on the other side of since long ago. This is the look he reserves for villains. Draco’s arm doesn’t shake as he holds the familiar wand at Harry’s throat.
“Sangiunum Purgo…” She says softly, and then, “Harry, where is Draco?” Harry doesn’t have time to answer, as Ron comes barreling into the living room, face red with some kind of emotion, although Harry can’t tell for sure what it is.
“Potter,” Draco says, and Harry tries not to flinch at the use of his last name, “I knew you would come for me.” Harry thinks Draco meant to be rye with this statement, but it only sounds sincere in his ears. He waits a moment, walking slowly toward Draco, not wanting to startle him.
“Hey, what makes you so sure I didn’t cook it?” Harry says with indignation. The two men stare each other down for a few moments before bursting out laughing. Hermione and Ginny snort from their respective seats in the living room.
“Yes.” Harry answers, allowing the tears to finally fall.
“I know.” She answers, “Like I said, I’m glad it’s you.”
“I’m just so happy you’re here,” he reaches across the table to place his hands over Draco’s, wanting to comfort him, to touch him, anything to make this weird tension in the air just disappear. But Draco pulls his hands back abruptly, just out of Harry’s reach, and it stings so much that Harry loses his breath.
I try my hardest to hold out, to make this moment last. It has been a shitty month of being forced to watch as other Death Eaters do unspeakable things to innocent muggles and muggleborns alike. The moments where I get to see Potter, to feel like I am making a difference, like everything will be worth it in the end, are much too fleeting. And now, I haven't been able to think of anything but our kiss. There is a hope within me, ever present, that it isn't just the war that makes him reciprocate my desires. That maybe, just maybe, when this is all over, we can be together out in the open. I know it is probably too much to ask, given everything I have done, will continue to do before the war is over.
“You really don’t have to come with me,” he says, placing one hand over Harry’s where it’s resting on the table.
“Draco, no.” Her voice is so quiet, so final. “You know that’s not what he’d want. It doesn’t even matter that it’s forbidden. He wouldn’t want that.” She pauses and closes her eyes, tears streaming. “You know that, Draco. He wouldn’t want that. He wouldn’t want that
And this too, will never not be a miracle.
“Yeah?”
, pressing against the warm entrance he finds there. His cock throbs in response, so for the sake of scientific experimentation, Harry presses harder.
The scortátus gives another of those very disturbing shrieks and kicks at the tree again, and Harry swears he feels the whole tree shake.
Harry squawks and quickly downs the rest of his drink before it gets spilt. He glances up to see Hermione watching them with an affectionate look, and he blows her a kiss as Ron shoves him over and he collapses into a messy heap on the floor.
the dinosaur exhibit, had spent weeks popping up at unexpected times with interesting dinosaur facts, so it cannot be a coincidence that there is now a very large, and probably completely anatomically correct T Rex guarding the entrance to the hedge maze, but why on earth is Potter out here engaging in the topiary arts?
What it hasn’t been, until now, is fucking.
Harry stops and stares at him. “Fuck,” he says again, and then he snorts. “This is exactly why I’d make a terrible Auror. That didn’t even cross my mind,” and Malfoy surprises him with a loud laugh.
Draco sighs, and Harry feels him slump a bit.
“Don’t you dare, Harry. Don’t you fucking dare.” Draco pulls Harry up and quirks an eyebrow at him as he reaches for the hem of Harry’s shirt, and at Harry’s nod, pulls the garment up and over Harry’s head.
, as the Daily Prophet likes to pronounce a few times a month, and wasn’t
“Ground-breaking research from Draco Malfoy,” Harry whispers. “Sex is even better when it’s with someone you love. Extra extra, read all about it.”
It’s not that he hasn’t had
“Malfoy,” he says finally, staring into the fire. “I have no fucking idea. You?”
Okay, so Harry might not have a lot of practical experience in this realm, but he’s pretty sure that staring at another man’s penis in the men’s room is not an entirely heterosexual action. As he continues to look at Malfoy, Malfoy licks his lips and looks back up. Yeah. Definitely not heterosexual. Their eyes meet, and it's possible Harry Potter is really just one giant cliché because it's like time fucking stops, like the entire world disappears. Then Malfoy grins again.
“Harry,” shouts Hermione, running forward.
No one’s seen Potter for days, not since the Incident in Potions, and Weasley and Granger are being very cagey. Draco doesn’t like it.
Harry nods, darts in for one last kiss.
Okay, maybe he’s a little drunk. He’s had just enough of whatever is that Luna offered him that he feels a little warm, a little spinny, and a lot like he loves everyone in this common room tonight.
“I thought I’d been so obvious,” he murmurs and reaches out to skim his knuckles over Harry’s jaw.
“Hey, come down here, I think this is a better spot.”
“Fine, Potter. Nowhere near as exciting as yours, of course.”
He manages to urge Draco back a step, and can’t help the thrill that runs through him. Draco’s eyes are wide and he’s panting as if he’s just run a 10K race, and he looks as undone as Harry feels.
“Oh, Potter,” he says with a wicked grin as he shoves his jeans down, “We’re just getting started.”
“Yeah, I think I will,” Draco gasps, and looking worried, Richardson departs, and, thank the bountiful lords of small mercies, he pulls the door shut behind him.
“No, I’m pretty sure that can’t be true, but this thing is locked onto us now. You or me, it doesn’t matter. It won’t attack them the way it would us, but they’re going to need a weapon, because it will fight back. It’s not dumb.”
Well, this is interesting. Just out of curiosity, Harry slides a slicked-up finger down and
Like a week ago, when Draco had been heading to the showers after a late night of studying and he’d run into Potter, literally. They’d done that awkward dance where Draco had gone right just as Potter had gone left, and then the reverse, and Potter had laughed that warm chuckle that always feels like it’s winding itself deep into Draco’s heart, and then Potter had put his hand on Draco’s shoulder to hold him still and the towel had slipped and Potter had said, “Oh no, my towel!” with another of those laughs and he hadn’t broken eye contact with Draco at all, not once.
He’s past the far end of the property now, the rolling fields and hills. From here, he’ll continue on through the woods, along the lake’s shore, and finally back around to the driveway. It’s so late, he can see how the moon has shifted overhead, but he still doesn’t cast a Lumos. There’s no need, he knows this path well. He hears the call of owls, the rustlings of small animals in the underbrush, but he has nothing to fear from the night. One foot, then another, step after step, bringing him closer and closer to the Manor. It is both home and not home. Even if Draco can’t explain it to anyone else, it’s enough that he understands.
“Here?” he asks and Harry shakes his head.
Hermione finally speaks up. “Harry, are you sure?”
“I’ll keep the coffee on,” she says in her gravelly voice, and Draco feels simultaneously ten years old and a hundred.
“So,” Malfoy says after a long pause. He slouches down, mirroring Harry’s posture. “Since you’re not going to go be Kingsley’s most special boy and run the Auror Department, what are you going to do?”
It’s Potter, of course. Draco skids to stop, looking around, but he doesn’t see Potter.
“I’m gonna,” he pants, “Fuck, Draco, I’m gonna… You’re making me…” He moans again, as Draco does something with his tongue that seems to be particularly impactful, and Harry’s voice is high as he cries out, “I’m coming, Draco, I’m…” and then his back arches up and he
Draco finally shoves his chair back, and yanks Harry out from under the desk, and yes, his intuition was correct, there’s come all over Harry’s robes and a bit on his chin.
” He slides his hands down to the small of Draco’s back, teases a bit at the waistline of his jeans. “Not in front of the mums and the muffins.”
“So, I heard something curious,” Harry says, striving for a casual tone that belies the way his heart is pounding. “I heard you like me,”
Draco grabs it from him. “I am so down for fucking you, Potter, you have no idea.”
Harry just shakes his head and clacks his scissor blades at him. “I’ll tell you later. That was, my god, Draco.”
and once more, he whispers your name.
And, Draco can’t believe he didn’t notice, standing guard on either side of the archway, someone appears to have created hedge sculptures. One is a fine figure of man, a hand on his hip that’s canted out invitingly, and the other appears to be… a T Rex? Their muggle studies class had taken a field trip to the Natural History Museum in London, and Draco remembers that Harry had been quite taken by the dinosaur exhibit.
“Drink that,” she says, “and then off to bed with you. I don’t want to see you or Mr Harry before noon tomorrow.”
“Shut up,” Harry mumbles. “I wasn’t going to be running anything. I’m fucking eighteen. Nobody in their right mind would put an eighteen-year-old in charge.”
Now it’s time to walk the Manor. Harry seems to need to stick close this year. Sometimes he accompanies Draco, sometimes he doesn’t. Draco’s never been able to discern what changes from year to year. This year, though, Harry follows Draco up into the attic that spans the width of the building and watches as Draco pulls out his wand. The binding spell sparks gold and silver, and the opening words of the initial incantation come effortlessly now.
Ron shakes his head. “Turns out she came down with mumblemumps earlier this week, so she wasn’t even on campus. They’ve arrested her at Mungo’s.”
And now, here he is, so many years later. It astounds him even now, and he’s so thankful for the second chances he’s been given, to live in this future that he never imagined possible for himself. And if these nights are the price he pays, the penance he must continue to offer, well, Draco thinks as he shifts and settles, and looks up at the familiar stars, he’ll do it. Not gladly, but willingly.
“Fuck,
Draco smiles, presses a kiss to the top of his head. “It’s not always, I don’t think. Think it’s something special about you.”
“You want to come like this?” Draco asks.
Harry snickers, focuses, and casts and they both shiver as the magic flows over them, cool and tingly.
“Oh, really?” Harry leans back, lets his head tip back to rest and his eyes close. The switch to nights for the next two weeks is kicking his ass. “That’s not what I heard.”
“Yes, of course, ground-breaking research by Harry Potter, sexual proclivities tied to hair color, extra extra, read all about it.”
They make their way to the seventh floor, and then Malfoy drops Harry’s hand and moves forward, frowning in concentration, and after several breaths, a double door appears in the wall. It looks rustic, the wood is rough with wrought iron fittings, but it opens easily under Malfoy’s touch, and he moves back to let Harry precede him into the Room. Harry feels the light touch of Malfoy’s hand at the small of his back like a brand, and he’s already starting to get hard.
It’s a familiar-shaped box, and Draco’s heart starts to pound as he snaps it open, staring at the beauty within.
Ron ambles forward, relief clear on his face. “Did you find the flower then?”
“It just wasn’t high on my list of priorities until…”
Harry blinks at him. “But I thought…”
“I do. And I mean, technically, this isn’t a maze. It’s a labyrinth. It’s unicursal.”
Malfoy pauses to pull a bottle of water out of his bag. He drinks thirstily, head tilting back, and as he swallows, Harry’s eyes are drawn to the long line of his throat, illuminated in the moonlight streaming through the treetops. “A scortátus is like the opposite of a unicorn.”
“Potter,” Draco hisses and Harry just gives a hum, too distracted by the warmth of Draco’s skin under his fingertips.
“That’s not the interesting question,” Malfoy says, and Harry glances quickly at him.
Draco winds his arms around Harry’s neck and kisses him back.
“God, yeah, that’s. Fuck, Draco, your fucking mouth.” Harry cracks his eyes open to peek at Draco sprawled out between his legs and slams them shut again when Draco grins and bites his lip. “You’re so pretty,” Harry moans and then flushes. “Didn’t mean to say that,” he mumbles, looking embarrassed.
For right now, though, he’ll lie here with Harry, safe and secure, because he knows. He knows that he loves and is loved. He knows that in the end, that’s all there really is. They roll over, and Draco falls asleep to the sound of Harry’s heartbeat, strong and sure.
, and he certainly can’t imagine getting intimate with someone he doesn’t know, just for the sake of it. He’s not waiting for love and it’s not that he’s saving himself for anyone in particular, it’s more, he can’t fathom being that vulnerable with someone he doesn’t trust not to sell him out, and pretty much every person who fits that description is in the room with him right now.
Harry licks his lips and swallows, sees the way Draco’s eyes dip to his mouth, and then back up to look at him. Harry realizes he’s never looked been this close to Draco, so close he can see the flecks of yellow in the storm-cloud grey of Draco’s eyes, can see the beautiful curve of his cheek, can almost feel the heat of his body as Draco leans into him.
“We should get cleaned up,” Draco murmurs. “Maybe get some sleep. We’ve got work tonight.”
Because the Manor is the heart of their family, Draco focuses there next, letting himself drop down to the next level of connection. It rushes through him, the way it always does. The first few years after the War, this had been agonizing. At first, Draco had been violently sick and passed out, but as they’ve cleansed the house and grounds over the years, it’s gotten better and better. Now, the energy feels refreshingly cool, like a welcome breeze on a hot summer day, and Draco tastes something spicy and sweet. It changes depending on whether it’s Summer or Winter. It's a shock as Draco realizes, that as much as he dreads coming here, it's no longer the trial it once was.
“Any way I can get you,” Draco says fervently, and then adds “Also, on your back.”
Harry gives a quick fist pump of victory. “Great. I’ll meet you in the Atrium after handover.”
“Potter,” Malfoy says, and it shouldn’t sound so sexy, so alluring.
Malfoy takes a step towards Harry. “Until what?”
“Wait a minute,” Draco says, “How do you manage to feed yourself with those?”
Potter’s been
Harry smiles, his special smile that’s just for Draco, and he kisses Draco, nice and slow, just how Draco likes it. And then he says the words.
He’s hard, so hard against where Harry is hard too, and it’s so agonizingly hot that Harry thinks he may just die from this. Or come. Or come and then die. Death by orgasm.
“Oh,” Draco says, and then, “Wait, what the fuck?”
There’s a moment of silence as the Bottle sparks in what Harry thinks can only be an ominous way. “Harry Potter, when was the last time you achieved orgasm…” Harry opens his mouth to answer. “...with another person?”
And the ones who love you, know what you love and after all
Harry jumps in alarm as a sound like silvery chimes breaks the silence and a disembodied voice says, “The timer begins now. You have two hours.”
They kiss for long moments, until finally, Harry eases back, feeling shattered, like he’s been turned inside out. Draco’s not much better off — he looks dazed, his mouth swollen and red, and his hair definitely looks like someone’s been running their hands through it enthusiastically.
“Oh, right.” Harry says. He pauses. “Any ideas? Hey, what are you doing after?”
“Hmm,” Harry asks, attempting to demonstrate interest in Draco’s thought process while simultaneously working on stretching out the neckline of his giant hoodie. Draco’s collar bones have been taunting him for ages and now that it turns out he’s allowed, he wants to put his mouth all over them immediately.
Hermione nods and as Harry leaves the common room, he hears her ask Luna, “Where did you get this thing, anyway?”
Draco sleeps in one of the guest rooms now. Everything has been cleansed and redecorated, but after the first couple of years, when Draco had tried to sleep in his childhood bedroom, and he’d woken screaming every single time, he’d given up. This room is determinedly neutral, and Draco can’t even remember who’d stayed in it during the Occupation. He doesn’t sleep well here, but he does sleep.
It’s a small space, just a few tables and an oak bar that might seat five, if they’re friendly. There’s a woman behind the bar who nods as he takes a seat, and he can see the source of the music now, a man on piano, his back to Harry as he leans over the keys, clearly lost in the music he’s making.
These are all thoughts Harry has had, and even occasionally shared.
“I could just say no,” he says quietly. “And figure it out.”
Harry unbuttons Draco’s jeans. Draco lifts his hips as Harry shoves the offending fabric down and gives a pleased hum as he leans down to press a damp, open-mouthed kiss to the hard length of Draco’s cock under the black cotton of his boxer-briefs.
Harry feels Ron’s shrug. “Whatever you want, mate. Go to Oxford with Hermione. Come live with me and work at the shop. Go to America and shag your way across the Great Plains. You don’t even have to know now, we’ve still got six weeks until we graduate.”
It’s electric, every point of contact igniting Harry like a lightning strike - the touch of Draco’s hand, his lips, the way he moves in, his knees brushing against Harry’s. Without thinking, Harry wraps his arms around Draco’s waist and pulls him closer, slotting their bodies together like two halves of a whole. He gasps as Draco deepens the kiss, hand firm on Harry’s face, adjusting him just so.
“Potter, pay attention,” Draco says, sounding exasperated. “This is relevant to the task at hand.”
Draco can picture it so easily. Can just see Harry walking by the stationery shop, pausing as his attention is caught by the window display. Imagines Harry opening the door, the way the bell would jingle, the way the salesperson would look up. The way Harry’s glasses would have steamed over in the warmth of the shop after the chill of the street. Draco can see it, so clearly, Harry chatting away, hands waving, asking questions. Choosing this one. For Draco. Because it reminds him of Draco. Because he loves Draco. Draco can see it.
And light appears and this will never not be a miracle.
From there, they walk the third floor, the second, the first, and then the ground level. Every room, every inch of hallway and staircase. No part of the house is left untouched. Now down to the basement, all three levels including the dungeons. Draco’s learned that closing his eyes to the horror of his history not only does not protect him, it weakens his connection to the Lands. Everything must be brought into the light, he’s learned. Everything must be acknowledged and witnessed: the pain and the love. The terror and the comfort. The joy and the grief. It’s all part of his history, and it all must be observed and remembered.
readily apparent in her voice and Draco mopes for a moment because he really prefers her lemon snowballs but she’s always liked Harry best.
And you see yourself in the gilded mirror that hangs over the sideboard.
Draco sleeps.
, for quite some time. He’s thought about it at work, watching Malfoy argue with the Judge. He’s thought about it here, at their local, watching Malfoy laughing with their friends, arm draped casually around Ginny’s shoulders. He’s thought about it when they go dancing. The way Malfoy moves on the dance floor particularly inspires Harry. The memory of that sight tends to keep inspiring him when he gets home, sometimes not even making it to the bedroom before he’s pulling himself out, hand moving frantically, gasping and groaning.
Harry hooks his chin over Draco’s shoulder and watches as Draco lets the oil spill down into his lap and carefully coats up the inside of his thighs.
And now this.
Like how Harry thinks Malfoy’s worked really hard to change himself, to make himself a better person, a better man. And that’s impressive. That Malfoy has a great smile, and it comes out much more frequently these days. And how much Harry likes that. You know, as one does.
Draco had had no idea. He’d had a nice lie-in, and had taken advantage of the warm weather to sit out on the patio with a really good muffin from that place around the corner from their flat and his enormous coffee mug. Harry always makes fun of that mug. The love of Draco’s life had been on the ground dying, and Draco had been eating a muffin.
“Oh, please,” Draco scoffs. “It’s obvious. The fluxweed must have interacted with the metal of the shears, and you reached into the cauldron to try and grab them, didn’t you. But,” here he frowns, “Pomfrey said you’d been cursed.”
“How do you want to…” Harry asks.
“Pomfrey sent me out here because I was losing my mind from boredom in the hospital wing,” Potter retorts. “And I butchered her bonsais trying to neaten them up, so she said to go do my worst out here. It’s been fun, actually.”
“Does it feel I’m not interested?”
Draco opens the bag, and pulls out—
The thing is, this magic constrains them all to consensual acts only. The Slytherins had been adamant about that. The Bottle cannot not force anyone to do anything they don't already want to do, and cannot involve another person in the Dare if that person isn't completely ready and willing to be involved (even if they don't quite know that fact until the Bottle decrees it). Luna had run the diagnostics herself and agreed. Only people who are willing will be involved.
Draco frowns. “I really don’t… I can’t say as I’ve ever heard of anyone using that particular technique. Generally, things are over very quickly in these situations, one way or the other.”
Malfoy stands up, crosses the circle and reaches a hand down to Harry, one eyebrow quirked. “Shall we, Potter?”
“I’m so close, I’m going to…” another groan and then, “I’m coming,
“Right back at you, Harry,” Draco says, just as quietly. “Always and forever. But you’re still buying the fancy naan. Because I won.”
than he has in a long time. Maybe ever.
“Take me to him,” Draco says, and he’s sobbing.
He manages to get a rhythm going, shifting his hips to fuck up into the slick heat between Draco’s thighs, jerking his hand on Draco’s cock in tandem to the rhythm of his own lower body. Harry can barely move, can’t get any leverage, and somehow that makes it even hotter.
Ron nods. “We’ll get going on the scene here.”
“It’s cold,” he says accusingly, as if Ron and Hermione are personally to blame for this situation.
“Oh.” Malfoy pauses. “Yeah. I could see that. Well, shit.”
He watches as Harry’s eyes close and his head tips back as Harry gives himself over to the sensation, his body relaxing and his legs dropping open. Draco decides this is an invitation to get closer, so he shifts himself around and leans down to shove up the pant leg of the loose track pants Harry is wearing, to start pressing kisses into Harry’s knee.
“You left,” he says quietly, looking away. “I’ve never… it’s never… and you just fucking left, Draco.”
The note continues:
Harry places one hand on his own dick, which is, coincidentally, also starting to get hard.
Malfoy looks surprised. “Of course it was. As soon as I heard the stakes, I knew.”
Harry glances over to where the noise is coming from and sees something that looks almost familiar, but not quite right.
, where Harry had waltzed into Draco’s office and sat down on top of Draco’s desk and pulled Draco in by his necktie and kissed him, bold and unhurried. Kissed Draco like he means it, with tongue and everything. Kissed him like Harry doesn’t even care if someone walks by and sees.
He sits up, concentrates as hard as he can. “
Harry shrugs and nods hello to the lawyers, following Draco into the formal dining room. He holds Draco’s chair for him, almost without thinking, and then slides in to sit next to him as the others seat themselves.
Harry follows suit, and as Draco presses back against him, skin to skin, Harry moves, turning so he’s tipping Draco over onto his back onto the soft couch cushions. There’s a sudden brush of magic over Harry’s skin and he blinks down at Draco.
“Hermione,” he says, and Hermione holds him even closer, and he can feel the way her body shakes as she weeps. “This isn’t the way it’s supposed to end.”
“C’mon, fuck, that’s so good, harder. Yeah, right there, like that,
“You all right, mate?” he asks and Harry sighs.
Harry sags forward, pressing his forehead into Draco’s back. He wraps his arms tight around Draco, as Draco slumps over, his head resting on his knees. Harry can feel the way Draco is gasping for breath as they both come down.
Harry groans and his hips jerk. “I,
what to do now.
“Right, well. I’m sure the Aurors are going to want to hear all about this in the morning. They said they’ll be here to take your statement at ten. You might want to get some rest. And Draco?”
Harry huffs out a laugh. “I do. I do know it.”
Harry stares at him and then takes the glass. He accidentally takes a significantly larger sip than he means to, and chokes on the strong flavor, the alcohol burning a path to his gut.
Harry’s smile broadens and he leans in, kisses Draco and steals his breath.
, Draco, that’s. Oh god, that’s so…”
Harry appears to be having trouble forming words.
“Malfoy, are you in there?”
Harry’s thought about kissing a guy, well,
“Yes?”
,” and Harry leans in to fasten his mouth on Draco’s neck even as he moves his hand down.
Harry wraps his arms around Draco, takes a moment to rub his hands together to try and warm them up before he slips them up under Draco’s hoodie and the soft t-shirt he’s got underneath, until his fingers are splayed across the firm warmth of Draco’s stomach, which contracts under his touch.
“Focus, Potter,” Malfoy says, his voice amused and Harry snaps his gaze from the curve of Malfoy’s jaw to his eyes.
“This is shitty,” Harry mutters, banging his head gently against the tree. “So what you’re telling me is, if we climb down there, that thing is going to kill us for never having gotten laid, which is
“You know,” Harry murmurs into Draco’s neck, “There is one spell I can do wandless.”
Draco shifts and pulls them off. He’s gloriously naked now, fair skin flushing, and his cock is so hard, it looks almost painful. Harry glances up at him, licks his lips, and then leans over and takes Draco into his mouth. Draco cries out, his hands coming to rest lightly on Harry’s head.
Perhaps the grace of love is that it allowed you
“That sounds good to me,” Draco says into Harry’s hair, and lets himself drift, knowing he’ll be cursing himself in the morning for not cleaning them up, but there’s nothing that could take him away from Harry, and he figures, he’ll deal with it in the morning.
He knows there will be repercussions to this. They need to understand how their intel had been so wrong. How had the perps thrown up those wards so quickly, managing to cut off their team? Not to mention, Harry knows, Hermione is going to be
Suck, suck, and stroke.
“You could…” Draco says, his voice breaking. He breathes, tries again. “You could say them again. Now. I could hear them now.”
Whatever it is, it’s big, and gaining on them.
Hermione rolls her eyes and sighs. “Thank you, Draco, and you’re looking, well, smashed really. I just went to the loo, where did you find the whiskey?”
Harry blinks in surprise as he hears Malfoy’s voice. Maybe this is something Malfoy does to get himself off? It would never occur to Harry to narrate what he does to himself, but, he thinks philosophically, it takes all kinds to make the world go round. Or come, in this case, as clearly Malfoy’s having a wank.
And then, something occurs to Harry and he pauses, sits up, and presses one hand to Draco’s dick, who hisses at the contact.
“You can,” Harry gasps, eyes closed and forehead furrowed, “I think you can move.”
Malfoy’s wand!”
There’s a long moment of silence and then Ron says loudly, “Okay, quit your gawking, everyone move along now, who’s next?” and with relief, Harry feels the moment shift and fade.
Malfoy shrugs. “Probably the liquid courage, to be honest.”
bad about this, about getting off to Malfoy’s getting off without Malfoy knowing, but right now, he just feels so fucking
“Faster, fuck, Harry, can you?” he gasps out, and Harry
“So yeah,” Malfoy says. “Scortátus are the anti-unicorn. They’re smart, they’re vicious, and they fucking hate virgins.”
. Well, it’s not that he
Harry had come by to drop off the paperwork from his most recent case, a case that Draco will be prosecuting, because that’s his
“You won’t,” Draco says, knowing the conviction he’s feeling is evident in his tone. “I know you won’t. Harry, I…”
“You know who I mean,” Draco says grumpily, “Weasley and Granger.”
Here Malfoy looks at him, finally
it feels, and he’s already shockingly close to the edge. “To be honest, I don’t think it’s going to take much.”
“Fuck, that’s—” Harry says and trails off on a moan.
“I mean,” Draco begins and sees the way Harry withdraws. “No. Wait. I’d fucking love that. But what’s going on?”
“No. I’m training with McGonagall, but my control is shit. There are like two spells I can do. But, I mean, I’ll try.”
Which means everyone in the room now knows that Draco Malfoy wants to get Harry Potter off, and Harry Potter is completely and totally on board with that.
“Fuck,” Malfoy says. “Oh Merlin, we are so fucked.”
Draco moans, his hand moving faster, and then Harry just fucking says it.
— just because Draco’s not interested doesn’t mean he’s gone blind, for fuck’s sake). Anyway, Draco had been working with Neville so he hadn’t been paying attention when there’d been a loud bang and a huge cloud of black smoke, and by the time the room cleared, Draco had just seen the back of Harry’s head as he’d raced out of the lab, Ron and Hermione heavy on his heels.
“Okay, fine. I assume you know how to get there without getting lost for all time?”
“Huh,” Harry says.
His soft touch sparks something deep inside of Harry, and when Malfoy’s thumb traces lightly over Harry’s mouth, he shivers, his lips parting on a gasp.
He’s secretly thrilled that even after five years, Harry still automatically turns his hand to thread his fingers through Draco’s, and it still gives Draco butterflies.
“Oh fuck, that’s so good. So fucking good, that’s. Yeah, like that, just like fucking
Draco reaches up, places one hand on Harry’s face, and pulls him in, tilts Harry’s head
“This thing hates virgins, yeah? And we don’t know which one of us it’s locked on to because it could be either.” Malfoy nods. “What happens…” Harry takes a deep breath. “What happens if we become, well. Not virgins. While it’s locked on?”
It’s not a fancy bag, just a small, plain brown paper bag with rough string handles. Draco frowns and gives Harry a quizzical look.
Malfoy shrugs and won’t meet Harry’s eyes. “It’s a thing I learned during. You know. If you use red light, it helps you see better in the dark. I don’t want to alert anything to our presence, but one of us is going to get hurt if we keep up like this, or we’re going to lose the path.”
Ron steps into the room, concern written clearly on his freckled face. “Not sleeping well?”
Draco takes Harry deep even as he pushes in, reveling in the way Harry opens up for him, the way Harry’s body jerks and his eyes fly open when Draco crooks his fingers just so.
“We wait,” Malfoy says. “Someone will come tomorrow, and we’ll be in agony for a week and then we’ll be fine.”
“Well,” Harry says, rubbing Draco firmly, who bucks up at the feel of Harry’s hand. “You did say you don’t put out on the first date?” Harry realizes he’s only half-joking, that he actually needs to hear this from Draco. “Do you want this? We can stop.”
know that. But to be honest, I wasn’t sure you did.”
He opens his eyes and blinks at Hermione, who is watching him with an affectionate smile on her face.
Harry can’t help it, his eyes drop down to Malfoy’s cock, and, bloody hell. Malfoy’s
To let love in and you’ve learned to see yourself the way he does
,” Draco thinks fiercely, and then as Harry shudders, “
He glances at Draco, then gives Harry a grin and claps him on the back. “Can’t say I’m all that surprised, mate.”
Draco kisses Harry like he’s drowning and Harry is air, like he’ll die without him. Harry feels himself come alive again, feels his whole body light up, and thinks wildly as he lets the kiss consume him, maybe
“You’re a mad man,” Draco says, but it comes out fond and affectionate. “It’s like you want to get caught.”
“What? Are you okay?”
Harry nods. “In my pack. Did you figure out what happened?”
Eyes still closed, Harry grins at the ceiling and says in a sing-song voice. “That’s not what I heard.”
Draco swallows and opens his eyes. “Nothing. I just wanted to make sure you were okay. Now that I’ve seen you, I’ll leave you to your…” he makes a vague gesture to the neatly trimmed hedges around them and turns to go.
Finally, Harry sighs. “I’ve got come all over my face,” he says and Draco snorts.
Draco turns back, and mimics Potter, lifting one eyebrow in silent question. Two can play that sardonic game, he thinks.
“What?” He stares at Malfoy. No, at
He presses a kiss to your neck and you think
“Right here,” Potter says, and steps out from the corner right in front of Draco.
“Pull it together,” Draco says rudely. “Let’s see what you’ve got.”
Draco leans over, brushes a kiss against Harry’s cheek, almost undone by the gentleness that flows through him. “Not for the boring lawyer meetings. If you want to come this afternoon, that’s up to you.”
Harry sighs, realizing neither of them have come through this unscathed. In addition to Draco’s cuts and leg, the left arm of Harry’s robe appears to have been disintegrated, leaving his arm bare and blistered.
From there, it’s another round of shots and then they’re all roped into playing Spin the Truth or Dare Bottle. Everyone squeezes in around the coffee table and Harry finds himself squashed up against Malfoy, close enough to feel the heat of his lean thigh and catch the scent of his aftershave, something woodsy and spicy. He smells like a man, Harry thinks, dazed.
Malfoy turns back, face blank and then, as Harry tries to find the right words, raises one eyebrow. “While we’re still young, Potter?”
Harry finishes his drink and gets up to leave. He walks to the door as Draco sings.
“Oh sweet heavens,” Draco says faintly. “You’ve lost the plot, Potter. Entirely.”
“So much,” Draco breathes, “Harry, you have no idea,” and he leans down to take Harry into his mouth.
Harry hears footsteps and then Hermione’s laugh as she steps into the room. “What’s going on here, boys?”
Malfoy casts, and Harry hears him shout as the shield flares up in front of Harry just in time, and the industrial equipment that’s been protecting him goes up in flames.
They leave the dead where they’ve fallen, and pile the living in the center of the open space.
“Well, we’re on nights for the next two weeks,” Harry points out, “so breakfast works better with our schedules.”
“I just,” Harry had run a hand through his hair, more artfully tousled than messy these days (he really does have a spectacular stylist). “I’ve made that mistake before, jumped into bed too quickly.”
It gets heated quickly, Draco grinding down, Harry rolling his hips up as they kiss. Draco tastes of coffee and sugar, and something about the weight of his body on Harry’s is grounding. Harry feels
Harry shudders. “It did,” he says breathlessly, “I mean it, I do, I want to. I have for so long now. But Draco. I need you to be sober. I want you to remember every moment. Every detail. Every sound and sensation.”
“Just tired.”
He’s sat on the ancient, squashy couch in the staff lounge. The other occupant of the lounge is sitting in the hideous, green, corduroy, wingback chair, face hidden behind the Propet from two days ago. They’re the only two in the lounge, which, given that it’s 2:00 in the morning, is not surprising.
is the moment where he finally begins.
They look at each other, and then they’re moving, Draco grabbing Harry and yanking him close, Harry wrapping his arms around Malfoy and slamming their mouths together. It’s heat and passion, fear and relief, and Harry feels like he can’t get close enough to Malfoy.
Harry tries not to think about it too much, because he gets very angry, and when Harry gets angry, sometimes his control… slips.
Harry can almost hear Malfoy’s shrug as he says, “Dunno, was thinking of trying that new curry place.
“Yeah, yes,” Draco says, sounding as overwhelmed as Harry feels.
Somehow Draco seems to know exactly what Harry needs without him asking, because he curls up to pull Harry in for a kiss, and then plants his mouth, hot and wet, on Harry’s neck and sucks before biting down hard, and Harry cries out and
“Fine,” Draco says, and
“Is this your first time? Doing it this way?”
“Staying down is not in my repertoire,” Malfoy says, and allows Harry to help him sit up. Malfoy looks dispassionately at his leg and wiggles his toes. “I don’t think it’s broken this time. Just bruised.”
The only time Draco lets himself be soft and gentle, Harry knows, is when they’re alone. Draco was trained by the best never to let anything real show.
“Malfoy.”
He’s so tight, he’s got to go slow, but soon Harry is gently fucking himself up to the first knuckle, and his hips are starting to rock. The angle is bad, and his wrist is starting to ache, but he’s getting closer. He’s never felt anything like this before, and thinks he’s never been so hard in his life. This is a revelation.
“Not that I was listening in or anything, Potter.” He tries to drum up a credible sneer. “I just happened to be outside the lounge when they were talking.”
“Fine. I concede. You may be right. Medi first, and then naan.”
“Fuck’s sake, Potter, you're a philistine. Can’t take you anywhere.”
“Will the scortátus try for them?”
It’s not like Draco
Harry loses himself in the press of Draco’s mouth, the way Draco runs his hands up Harry’s sides and around to his back. Harry winds his arms around Draco’s lean body, slides his own hands down to curve over Draco’s bum, listens to the way Draco gasps as Harry pulls him closer.
“For some definition of luck that involves us being cursed,” Harry agrees, and Malfoy snickers. “Alright then.” Harry adjusts his knapsack. “Let’s go. I don’t want boils,” and with that, they enter the forest.
Draco spreads his legs as he presses back even harder against Harry. “Fuck, wish we had…”
“I didn’t have a choice,” Draco says, and Harry can feel the weight of his gaze. Draco’s hand lifts, and he curves his fingers over Harry’s cheek.
Ron stares at them. “Harry, no one can outrun a scortátus. You either kill it immediately or you’re dead. How did you get it to leave you…”
“Fuck, me too, oh Merlin,” Draco gasps, and then, “Fuck, Harry, I want… You gotta… Fucking hell…”
It’s gentle at first, like an introduction, an innocent exploration. It’s been a long time since Harry’s been kissed like this, and as it continues, Malfoy’s mouth pressed to his, so sweet and soft, Harry realizes. He’s
“Not that this isn’t great, Potter, but I think we’re going to need to do a bit more to, err, devirginise us.” He frowns, looking thoughtful. “Actually, it’s an interesting question, isn’t it?”
“If you really can’t stomach it,” Malfoy says, “We can forfeit.”
“Fuck,” Draco breathes as Harry gasps and shakes, finally batting away Draco’s hand with a hiss. “That was the hottest thing I’ve ever seen.”
Draco swallows and coughs, sucking Harry through it until he moans, “Enough, oh my god,” and sitting up, wipes his mouth. Harry is sprawled out, legs wide and chest heaving, eyes staring in shock at the ceiling of the pavilion.
“How is he doing?” McGonagall asks, and his heart starts to quicken in anticipation because they can only be talking about Potter.
With Ginny, there’d been heat and anticipation threaded through with the terror of war, and Harry had always, always felt like she needed something from him that he just didn’t have to give. But now, as Malfoy shifts, turning his head slightly to adjust the angle of the kiss, Harry slides his hands up firm biceps and realizes that perhaps there’s nothing he has to prove here, no one he has to be other than simply… Harry. So he closes his eyes and lets himself sink into the moment and just
They land on the front walkway of the Manor where Draco stumbles and breathes deeply to keep from vomiting on his shoes. He dislikes apparating at the best of times, and should know better than to have had that last drink before leaving, but dammit, he’s wallowing and a man should be allowed to wallow in peace.
“What?” Harry asks. “Why’d you stop?”
Draco nods, looking slightly abashed. “Yeah. They’re probably in the other room.”
Their eyes meet and hold, and something shifts, and Draco understands. Potter knows that Draco looks at him
Whatever the song is that he’s playing winds to a close, and Harry orders a whiskey. The bartender sets it in front of him and goes back to her stool, picks up the paper she was reading. There are no other customers and Harry feels himself relax for the first time in, well. A long time.
, I tell you.”
It’s a rainy Tuesday in late July, and the streets are relatively empty. Harry is walking alone, hands shoved into his pockets, glasses tucked into his coat, rendering the night soft and misty, slightly out of focus. It’s fitting, Harry thinks, because that’s how he feels. Like he’s lost his focus.
“What do you think I’m suggesting?”
They stare at each other and then it hits Harry. “Oh my god, I’m so sorry. Are you…” He can’t figure out how to word it. “Are you waiting for… reasons? Religious? Or something? Or are you dating anyone?”
The curtains of his bed are open because if he closes them, then people will know he’s in there, and he doesn’t want anyone to know where he is, but he also doesn’t have the energy to go anywhere else. It’s a Hogsmeade day (not that the 8th years are bound by that anyway), and the 8th year dorms and common room are empty. Most people are either in the village or taking advantage of the unseasonably warm autumn day to be outside.
He makes his way downstairs. When he’d remodelled, he’d pulled the kitchens out of the basement and onto the ground floor. The room is large and well-lit, even in the soft light of dawn, and Draco sits down at the large table he’d installed, to his mother’s horror —
Harry feels almost giddy. “So, if you look at me, and I look at you, and we’re both. Well.” He takes a breath. “Interested?”
“So, here’s the thing,” Harry says, managing to scoot himself up to sitting. “That was your fantasy, yeah?”
“I know,” Draco says, and he’s not ashamed over the relief he hears in his own voice.
“This just says,
“Yeah,” Harry agrees. “We need to not.”
Draco lets one finger rest at the opening to Harry’s body, sets up a gentle rhythm of breach and retreat, breach and retreat. “It might.”
And then the bottle lands on Malfoy.
“Oh,” Draco says, nodding thoughtfully. “Hmm. Yes, okay. I can work with that.”
Draco looks tired after a long night of work. His hair is messy, and later Harry will blame his own lack of impulse control on the fact that Draco’s hair is messy and he has the faintest smattering of freckles across his nose, barely visible unless you know to look for them. There’s nothing else to be done. Harry grabs Draco by the shoulders, shoves him up against the plate glass window of the cafe, and slams their mouths together.
They head back in and share the shower. Draco rests his hands against the tiled wall as Harry scrubs his back, tilting his head to the side as Harry kisses him gently. When they emerge from the bathroom, Keely’s been and gone, and there’s a lovely tea laid out for them.
Harry laughs. “I mean, you did most of the work there.”
“Oh, yeah.” Harry shrugs, sinks down on the couch. “Right.”
Draco shakes her. He’s screaming now, he knows he is, but he can’t stop. “You have to take me to him. I can do this, Hermione.”
Malfoy’s gaze flicks down to Harry’s mouth then back up to meet his eyes.
That’s the thing about Harry, Draco thinks, looking at that beloved, familiar face. He just says things. Things like
“That’s cool,” Harry says in surprise. “I didn’t know you could do that. Why red?”
Malfoy shakes his head. “And I thought…”
Malfoy shrugs, and Harry can see how flushed he is. “I guess I just need to hear it from you.”
They race up to the tree and Harry stares. “How are we going to get up?”
, he thinks, but when he looks over at Malfoy and sees the flush that’s creeping up his neck, Harry knows, whatever this is, he’s not alone in it.
Malfoy frowns and waggles his wand at the bottle which says, “The dare is this. Draco Malfoy and Harry Potter must venture into the Forbidden Forest to find the blossom of the Moonflower. They must search until they find the flower. If they do not find it by sunrise, they lose the dare. Penalty of loss will be boils over the entire body for 144 hours. Penalty of forfeit is twice that.”
It’s almost last call, and Draco doesn’t want to go. He doesn’t want to leave because he’s not going home, and he certainly doesn’t want to be where he’s going. He ponders, as he does every six months, just why he submits to these ridiculous rituals. It’s been fifteen years since his father died in Azkaban. Maybe, Draco thinks morosely, staring into his whiskey, maybe it’s time to let the heap fall. Time to walk away.
“Trust you,” Draco says affectionately, “To use your power and fucking wandless magic for jerking off and cleaning up.”
He grabs the clothes that Keely’s laid out for him and smiles when he sees Harry do the same. Somehow Keely always knows. Draco’s dying to know how she does it, but he’s pretty sure this is not the year he’ll be given that information. Probably not next year either.
Draco blinks at her for a moment, confused. “Granger,” he whispers conspiratorially, “Don’t tell anyone, but we’re in a pub. And did you know? They sell whiskey in a pub.”
“What do you want?” Draco whispers, one hand falling to Harry’s hip to pull their bodies flush together.
Draco looks at him for a long moment and then rolls his eyes. He puts his hands on Harry’s shoulders and quickly spins them around so that Harry is now backed up against the window. Draco places one hand on the glass by Harry’s head and gives him a teasing smile.
. No matter how much he wishes he could, Harry can’t go back in time and make it be different. He’s learned to ask Draco what he needs, though. Learned to listen, both to what Draco says and to his silences, and Harry’s come to understand what helps.
Harry blinks up at him and then starts to smile. “At least one,” he murmurs against Draco’s lips. “Isn’t that right?’
To be safe,
“It really is,” Ron whispers.
He and Harry have been, well, dating really, for months now. There’s no other word for it. It’s been dinner engagements at magnificent restaurants in London and flowers the morning after. It’s been notes on parchment delivered by owl only hours after saying goodnight. It’s been late-night walks in the rain, and early morning runs followed by steaming hot coffee. It’s been laughter, and intense eye contact, and hair gently tucked behind an ear. Heated kisses on the doorstep that have gone no further.
Harry gives a tentative roll of his hips, and Draco moans, hand moving faster, and as if reacting to the sheer force of his desire, Harry starts to get hard.
“Wow,” Harry says. “I mean, this is. Did you just do this today?”
“What?” Harry says in amazement. “How did you do that? I’m so turned on right now.”
Malfoy shakes his head. “I doubt it.”
As Draco walks, he turns his gaze to the sky and that vast expanse of stars that stretches out above him. He knows they’re not unchanging or eternal, and perhaps nothing is, but they’re the closest thing to infinity he’s ever known.
“It’s cold,” she says when he grumbles in protest. “You know you hate to be cold.”
They sit quietly for a moment and then Malfoy moves. He climbs down a limb or two and makes his way around to the other side of the tree. After a moment, he calls up to Harry.
“Harry,” Draco gasps as Harry’s lips close around the head of his cock, “You’ve got to be quiet.”
“So, what do we do now?” he murmurs, and he’s close enough that he can hear Malfoy swallow,
Harry hears the bedclothes rustle as if Malfoy’s pushing up into his imagined lover’s touch.
Malfoy lifts one eyebrow and then smiles. Harry wonders if maybe he’s having an allergic reaction to the tequila because he’s suddenly breathless.
He wraps his arms around you and whispers your name
Harry grins, swipes a thumb through the mess on his face, and pops it into his mouth.
They stare at each other.
“Fuck,” Draco mutters, “I’m so fucking close, Harry.”
But it’s been days now, and Draco, well, he’s quite sure the sensation he’s having in the pit of his stomach has nothing to do with worry, he’s just
“Yes,” Harry hisses. “Anything, Draco. Fucking anything,” and Draco reaches down and wraps one hand around Harry’s hard length.
His hand speeds up, and he leans over and braces himself with the other one, watching the way Harry’s eyes widen and his mouth opens.
Harry looks up and gives Draco a mischievous grin. “Really? Because it looks to me,” and here he carefully eases down Draco’s zipper, “Like we can.” He breathes out, heat and moisture onto the soft skin of Draco’s belly, and Draco’s head slams back against his chair’s headrest, “Like we are.”
He gives Draco a long lick, root to tip, and Draco has to sink his hands into the armrests of his chair and tries not to shout as Harry swallows him down. Draco is somewhat thankful that he’s sitting down, even if it is at his desk at work, because he knows his legs would not be holding him up right now, had he been standing.
“I want to do this right.”
Draco doesn’t say them back for weeks but Harry doesn’t seem to mind. They continue on as they’ve been, but now Harry says it all the time. The more he says it, the less Draco panics.
Malfoy has lowered the paper to his knees and he somehow manages to combine defensive and vulnerable into an attractive flush. “It’s just. Perhaps.”
“Fuck,
Harry can’t help holding himself stiff so that he’s not leaning against Malfoy at all, not wanting to make him uncomfortable, but after a moment, Malfoy mutters, “Oh for fuck’s sake, Potter,” and wrapping his arms around Harry, Malfoy hauls him back so they’re pressed close together, Harry’s backside snuggled in tightly between Malfoy’s thighs.
cursed with boils, Harry, and it really sucks. The fact that the way to avoid re-experiencing that scenario turns out to be that we have to have sex is really just an all-around win, so if you don’t mind, I’d love to get on with it.”
He starts to move, wanting to get up and grab a warm cloth to wipe them both down, but Harry just pulls him close and kisses him. “Don’t go, not yet.”
“I know,” Draco whispers, “I know it hurts, just. Take a breath, bear down, okay?” He wraps one hand around Harry’s cock which has started to go soft and holds it gently even as he pushes into Harry’s body, centimeter by centimeter.
Richardson shakes his head. “Told you that place was dicey, mate. You should probably go home.”
They quickly strip down, folding their clothes and setting them aside. Keely’s left fresh towels piled on the shelf by the door into the sauna, and he can see by the steam on the window that it’s already hot inside. When Draco opens the door to the sauna, the heat inside hits him like a blast.
He’s almost at the door when he hears, “Wait.”
“No. I can’t. What if I hurt you?”
Harry frowns. The STD Bottle, as it’s affectionately known, was a contribution from the Slytherins — apparently, it’s been a part of their house social scene for a very long time. No one fully understands how the magic works, and it can be a bit risky to play because it’s sort of like an unbreakable vow (because if you fail your dare, you are bound by the consequence), sort of like Veritaserum (in that you pretty much have to tell the truth or… suffer the consequences), and sort of like the Sorting Hat (in that the Bottle is able to see straight into your heart and mind with occasionally surprising and often uncomfortable results).
“Might be a long time,” Harry says and Draco closes his eyes against the feelings that are flooding him. “Might be forever.”
“Shut up,” Draco mutters, and lets his legs splay open.
Malfoy gives him a quick wink and a grin and Harry has to admit, Drunk Malfoy is really fun. It turns out that when he’s not under the threat of having his whole family murdered, Malfoy is. Well, there’s a lot to unpack there, as Hermione likes to say whenever Harry makes some totally off-the-cuff, innocuous comment about Malfoy that doesn’t
And all is well.
“Next time,” Draco says firmly, “we’re not going to be in a tree. Or in danger. Okay?”
She doesn’t get far.
He looks up at Draco, and Draco looks back at Harry, with his scar and his ridiculous hair and his beautiful eyes and his brave, brave heart.
, Draco,” and Draco collapses on him, heedless of the sticky mess between them.
“Pity,” Harry says as he turns to leave, “Because I do.”
. Oh god, Harry, I’m so fucking close, you’re making me,
“Come on.”
In any case, t’s such an odd feeling, to connect to something that’s so much older and larger than he is. Sometimes Draco can sense something that almost feels like affection and trust. The Manor knows that Draco will continue to care for it, and in return, it shelters and cares for him, as the last of the Malfoy line.
Harry snorts. “So, what you’re saying is, you’d be interested in that?”
The room erupts into chaos. Seamus shrieks
“Probably a few more days,” Harry says mournfully, pressing his forehead to Draco’s.
“Are you,
“A toast,” Ron yells, lifting the shot glass high, “To Harry Potter, who will not be accepting his offer for entrance into the Auror Elite Training Program!” and the room bursts into cheers.
As he slides his dry hand up Harry’s cock to gently cup his balls, something occurs to him.
“You were in luck, mate,” Ron says solemnly. “Her charmwork is for shit. The curse was supposed to hit you and her, get you sent to the Forest together.”
Instead, he’d turned to his friends. Ron and Hermione had somehow only become closer to him, and in the beginning, more nights than not had found the three of them piled into one of their beds. It wasn’t sexual, though Harry knows there were rumors. Rather, there’s something about the familiar feel of them next to him that’s helped him feel safe. Helped him to sleep.
“Fuck,” Draco whispers and swallows. “That’s, oh fuck, Harry.”
“Fuck,” Draco says and gives a wordless cry as Harry does it again, mouthing at him through the fabric. “Potter.
Destined for hell, and you would have walked into the quiet embrace
So, Draco does what he always does, which is lurk about and try to gather information.
Harry closes his eyes, already shaking. “I guess,” he says, shocked at how rough his own voice sounds, “I was too busy worrying about how obvious I was being,” and then Malfoy’s mouth meets his and they’re kissing.
“I know Kingsley doesn’t.” Harry frowns and Malfoy rolls his eyes. “Shut it, Potter, I’m not maligning your man there, just saying. You can write your own ticket right now, not undeservedly. So, since you can do anything you want, what are you going to choose?”
“Oh,” Draco says, feeling his cheeks flush. “That’s. Okay. Yeah. That’s good, then.”
Harry registers the impatient note in Ginny’s voice and realizes she must have been trying to get his attention.
“I’ve restocked the tea, and made molasses biscuits,” she says, the
“Because I wasn’t nice to you before.  And maybe I’d like to know the Draco who’d be nice to me back.”
“I think,” Harry said, “that we should take you home, and I can have a chat with your Papa.  I bet he loves you a whole bunch, and I’m sure he’ll want to know that you’re okay.”
It was a weak excuse at best, but Draco was suddenly tired, and overwhelmed by what he had just agreed to.  “So you want me to…babysit?” He wasn’t sure why he bothered asking, it’s patently obvious, but he somehow wanted to hear Weasley ask, to state that he had entrusted the vulnerable infant into Draco’s care.
“Kreacher,” Ron grinned. “I told you he was mad about babies.  He must have done it this afternoon.  Well, Harry’s all set, and there’s a monitoring charm to let you know if he wakes up.”
“Please don’t send me back to the Dursley’s,” Harry said softly.
He feels brave, as he finishes speaking, proud of how clearly he was able to express himself.  (The fact that he has been practicing this speech in various iterations during all of the sleepless nights he’s had since the picnic may have helped.)  But then Luna watches him for a long time, and her pale blue eyes contain emotionless appraisal.  His confidence begins to falter a little, and the self-doubt that he feels any time he tries to ask for something for himself starts to rise.  He can’t keep looking at her.  He can’t stay here.  For a sudden, desperate moment, he wants to take it all back, tell Luna that he’s sorry, that she was right after all.  To beg her to love him in spite of how little he deserves it.  Finally, she says, “Okay.”
“Yeah.  Thanks.  Anyways, shouldn’t you check your owl?”
“None of your business, Malfoy.  Come
Hermione.
“So how did they die?  Aunt Petunia said that’s how I got this,” Harry replied, running a finger down his scar.
“No, Cass, if there are subjects that interest you, we’ll certainly find you a teacher.” Papa’s face was serious.  “Darling, I know that a lot of things have changed for you, in a very short time, and you haven’t asked for any of them.  I’m very lucky to get to spend time with you, to get to know you, but I want you to have all of the same opportunities you would have had if you were still in Canada.  I want to give you everything, Cass.  If there’s anything you want, or need, you only have to ask.”
“Well, it’s ludicrous, really.  Imagine if someone took a shy, neglected little kid, and threw him into a world that he had no preparation for, and then told him that it was his birthright to save it?  And then the people who were responsible for taking care of him let him face danger and true evil, year after year, and did the bare minimum to help him.  Then, when the stakes were so high that he couldn’t possibly refuse, they told him that he needed to walk to his death to save the only people who had ever been kind to him.  Even if you don’t remember it, I imagine your built-in sense of obligation is pushing you to act.”
“Dad grows on you.”
“I said that if he let me take him on three dates, and he still hated me at the end of it, I’d accept defeat and leave him in peace.”
"You are nothing like Hermione said you were," Harry mumbled and Draco felt the resentment creeping in his lungs.
McGonagall smiles at him sweetly and her friendliness makes him suspicious.
Harold let out a breathless laughter. "I was wondering, if you'd remember, but I admit, it was a long time ago. We've played together when we were younger. I was visiting with my Godfather at that time. It was all very hush hush and nobody knew of my real identity, not even your parents. They were told that I was a child my Godfather was fostering for a while," he explained and twirled Draco around, "Maybe you remember me under the name Harry?"
"Just sit down, Malfoy," she said and she sounded tired. Draco shrugged again and secured the wand holster on his arm. Granger was fast with her wand, he remembered, and he didn't want to be on the receiving end of the Bad-Bogey-hex the Weaslette taught every student in the DA. If Granger noticed, she didn't comment.
"A chance, Potter?" he pants between his laughing fits and Harry feels quite awkward.
"Men," the Headmistress mutters and you feel chastened.
"Ow," he growls and glares at Harry, "it's true, isn't it though? It could be the slimy ferret confessing his love to you!" And Harry has to slam his head on the table at the absurdity of it all. He looks at Ron expressly.
"My my, Potter is obviously one problem. But Draco here also has no date," he taunts and Draco sneers with as much malice as he can muster. What a twat.
"Hmmm," was the answer and Draco hummed, keeping up the motions with Harry's hair.
"Pleasure," he drawls again, offers a smirk and a wink (!) to Potter, and saunters off. His robes flatter around dramatically and Potter watches him go with an expression you can't quite read, but then he's already saying his goodbye to McGonagall and follows the man into the castle.
It's an unusual sight, something to worry about. He himself is surprised. It's not an expression he ever saw on himself. Despite that, he could feel his eyebrows furrow and his mouth twitch.
"I know, that you know the Parselmouth, who sent me the letter. No, I know you do," Harry says when Zabini opens his mouth to interrupt him, "and he has reasons to not tell me, who he is. Maybe he thinks, I won't accept him, or maybe he fears rejection, but he wanted me to know of his feelings. That's why he sent me a letter. He knows me and he gets me. And if he really understands me as much as I think he does, then I want to meet him. I won't reject him! You have to tell him that. I want to get to know him, what kind of person he is, how he drinks his tea, what his favorite food is," he pauses to see if Zabini is listening. The Slytherin still has his wand on Harry's chest, but it doesn't look as if he wants to hex him.
"Alright," Blaise says and packs his things, "we're talking in our room. Come one." Draco lets himself be dragged from the table and he wants to look at Harry, wants him to know how much he hurt Draco, but he cannot bring himself too. So he goes along, offers no resistance, and doesn't feel the gaze on his back.
"Thank Merlin," Malfoy sighed and he sounded relieved. He eyed the Malfoy wearily, not daring to say anything. Potter could be hiding somewhere close for all he knew.
You decide, that you can't wait anymore and rip off the seal- your mother would be appalled, no doubt, she always cared for the subtle display of restraint, but she can kiss your ass right now- and skip the pleasantries the Headmistress wrote in the first five sentences. Well wishes and the polite conversations about your family and such and it's not like you don't appreciate it, but the suspense keeps you at the edge of your seat.
The giddy expression made everything worthwhile.
"Draco," Severus calls him softly and he follows the silent command and lifts his head. He assumed, his godfather would be angry, but he sees understanding instead.
"Have a nice life."
You still know Professor Flitwick of course. He sadly doesn't remember you that well, but you catch up with him, and he invites you to tea. You accept, of course. Indulging him seems barely a hardship. Your chat with Professor Sinistra is interrupted, by Potter and the blond guy. They are in deep discussion, walking around their colleagues to the tea trolley, not once stopping. Potter gestures animately and the blond guy sneers. It's very impressive, that particular sneer. He seems to be disappointed, exasperated, unbelieving, and superior at once, but Potter doesn't seem to be impressed. He scowls when the blond guy cuts him off with a lazy hand and they sit down, nodding at the Headmistress.
"Can you walk? I can't carry you," Malfoy said, voice high and anxious. He pushed himself in a sitting position, grabbing hold of the bed when he felt dizzy.
"Come to the Leakey with me," he repeated and Draco briefly wondered if he hit his head on the way here.
after all these weeks of almost-friends. He doesn't want to lose that. But Potter squeezes his hands back and nudges his head to get Draco to look at him. He follows him hesitantly.
The god of love scoffs and makes a shooing motion with his hand.
"I'll introduce her to all fine gentlemen I know, Mother," Draco promised stiffly. Mother gasped in outrage.
"I want to spend time with him. And I think, that your Parselmouth wants that as well. Give him my message. If he wants to meet, he should owl me," he finishes and Zabini narrows his eyes. He is searching for something in Harry's face, but he isn't sure what it is. Does he think, he's lying?
He could even converse about him, without any special feeling other than distant fondness and melancholy.
"Right now I have a hard time believing you loved him at all. What were you thinking, questioning his loyalty and love for you like that?!"
"You won't regret it, Pansy, I fucking swear," Harry said hastily, overwhelmed that he had come so far.
"Be a grown woman, Granger. Tell him what you told me," Draco provoked. Hermione was reminded in that moment, that Malfoy was in fact, not a nice person. He was petty and annoying and had no remorse throwing her under the bus. She hoped, four years after the war, that he had matured and maybe changed a bit, but this Malfoy could be still in a Slytherin uniform and call her a mudblood.
"Would you like to have a glass of wine with me tonight, Potter? It's been so long since I've been in Hogwarts, I'm in need of a tour guide." You batter your eyelashes at him, a move that always lets you pull whoever you want, but Potter glares at you.
"In a week he's away on business again. He always locks the door with wards, but... I might be able to lift them long enough for you to escape," Malfoy whispered and he silently watched those lips move around the words. It seemed like hours had gone by as he understood the meaning.
"Okay, maybe you have a point," Harry said slowly. "But what do you want me to do about it?"
. They made love on every surface they could find, rutting desperately, trying to get more, deeper,
So this was a very rare occurrence. Sometimes it happens- subjects weren't ready for happiness yet, or they didn't want it. But this was a problem: A subject, that didn't think, he deserved happiness, even if he entitled it. The god's frown deepened. The human was on his list and he wasn't allowed to skip him for later. The god had to make this human as happy as possible. Happy enough for this human to acknowledge, welcome, and accept it. But the god could see, that this was going to be a piece of work. He looked through the records of this particular subject. He was fairly young, for a human anyway. Time wasn't something the god of happiness had to fret about- his work would go on for eternity. There will always be a subject, that deserves his attention.
When he sits on the ground again, he has to blink several times and wish the tears away. This... this was more than he ever hoped for! A chance! With Harry! And Blaise... defended him even though he didn't have to. Draco smiles. He owes Blaise, big time. So he stands, hiding the Pensieve away after clearing it from the memory.
The war was finally over.
Living in Britain, after dating the hero of the wizarding world was hard. Draco couldn't hope to walk through Diagon Alley and
"I wish I could do more," Malfoy said between sobs and he vowed to take Malfoy with him. This kind soul deserved more than Potter.
"I have plans," she had said breathless, and Harry considered his job done.
"Sorry, sorry," he says, not sounding sorry at all. You sip at your own wine and then ask again.
"The follow me please," McGonagall says and leads him to the Headmasters office. Or Headmistress now, he supposed. McGonagall was officially appointed to her new duty and Draco found himself scowling at the thought of another Gryffindor Headmaster. He follows her into the room and waits patiently for her to settle. If he learned something in the lessons his father put him through, then that manners are often the key to a successful deal. She gestures him to sit and he follows that invitation without hesitation.
Yes, Ron's words made a lot of sense now.
"I forgot to introduce myself. I am the new Muggle Studies Professor and you can call me Alex," you introduce yourself and Potter takes your hand in a firm grip. You might swoon.
"Potter has still no date? How is that possible, he is literally the Golden Boy and the Fourth Champion!" Pansy exclaimed and Draco winced at the volume of her voice. A couple of Slytherins turn around to hear, what the commotion is about, but after a quick glare from Draco, they mind their own business again. Nosy pack of snakes.
The opportunity presents itself while Potter was sorting the children. The Great Hall was focused on the Hat, screaming names and houses. Malfoy looks amused and you itch to wipe that look off his face. You lean over Potter's seat and Malfoy turns to you, smiling like he's humoring you.
She smiled serenely. "He knows around sixty different ways and spells to do it, Potter. Hell yes, he would."
"Let's leave the pleasantries behind, shall we?" Hermione said icily and Draco had to admire that.
"Yes, how can I help you?" Pince asks the Ravenclaw and he stutters a little bit embarrassed, before signing accusingly to Draco. The latter just keeps reading.
"What's his problem?" Draco asks innocently, pointing towards the retreating couple. Potter shortly looks at him, probably questioning if he heard them, but Draco tries to look puzzled. It seems to work because Potter just sighs again.
Talking to someone, who was unbiased, was refreshing to say at least. It irked him, that the healer wouldn't agree with him on certain things (like his coping mechanisms), but some opinions made more sense than those he came up with and he left the office more times relieved than not.
His thoughts must have shown on his face, because Mother was looking him again. He gave her a brief nod and she left him well alone.
"He's helped me finding my own way and even if he's still
"No, Sir, I mean, yes Sir," he hurries to answer and Snape's raises one eyebrow and steps aside.
The god of friendship tries to reason, but his colleague wasn't listening.
"Wait, wait, no no! Pansy! Pansy let me in!" Harry hurried to explain and held his hands high. "I didn't break in, I promise."
Sometimes Draco just wants to go back. He feels, that he missed a lot in his youth and that he has no chance to relive it. He wants to make more friends, work harder, and question more instead of just doing what his father wants. To take more risks. Maybe he could have helped to end the war much sooner, but what done is is done. He can only remember and regret it.
," - "Love you too, darling," Draco interrupted and Harry shushed him with a little smile, - "Even if he's still Malfoy, he's a significant part and reason of my happiness and I won't let you take that away from me, Hermione," he finished and it was quiet for very long moments.
"You too are Seekers, are you not?" Draco frowns, because what has that to do with anything? He isn't even allowed to play in contrast to Potter.
He also realized that that was rather the point. This twisted theater was part of their game and they played it perfectly. Merlin, he was ashamed of himself. He should have known, he wouldn't get out of here alive.
"Minerva insisted. Why? Are you jealous? Can't handle that you don't have the privilege? You want to call Professor Sprout
After a few minutes, which seemed like eternity, Queen Lily inclined her head.
But the warm feeling and the pure happiness left with Harry that morning. The cold, stabbing betrayal clamped down his breath, settles in his stomach and he fet a new slash on his heart. It was deeper than every slash before and it would take longer to heal. It might never. It will definitely leave a scar.
"I don't know," Harry says, but Draco can see, that he's lying. He lets his eyes wander to his other hand in his own lap and now he definitely wants his other hand back. He's tired and angry and sad and he just wants to close his eyes and sleep for a long time. So he does.
"How was it, dear, you were there quite a long time, was everything alright?" Mother asked, ever so concerned and Draco left before he could hear Lyra's answer. He found himself a secluded spot hidden away to continue his reading. The ball continued on without him and soon the first dance was announced.
"CometotheLeakeywithme," he rumbled and Draco lifted a eyebrow in response.
"I've just committed the biggest mistake in my life," he says, and it
"Sorry, that I'm late," he apologized and Draco watched him fondly fumbling with his jacket.
Malfoy shifted uncomfortably, then looked at him again.
He was surprised how easy acceptance came. He wasn't sure, where his preferences lay, but he was certain, that he felt more for Harry. And he wanted him to ask to the ball. Preferable before the Weaslette (he couldn't call her anything else, they were rivals, for Merlin's sake) thought about rekindling her relationship with Harry. The latter told him, that he wasn't interested in her anymore, but Draco still nursed bitter jealousy. Harry fell in love with her all those years ago. Who said, he couldn't again? So he had to ask before anything will happen.
He stopped flinching, when witches or wizards talked about Harry.
"Will you go to the Yule ball with me?"
"Watch it in our room. I'll keep Theo outside," Blaise promises and Draco tightly nods, walking upstairs and locking himself into their bedroom. He briefly debates sitting on the bed or the ground but decides to take the ground. He places the Pensieve in front of him and pours Blaise's memory inside. He takes a deep breath and dives in.
She asks and watches them eat and giggle. The god of happiness looks up to her and beams.
"Draco, I am so so sorry for what I said last night. None of it was the truth, I swear. I was just angry and confused because I see all those couples around us express their love a certain way, and Ron," Draco winced at that, and Harry noted that for later, "and Hermione were always the role model for my past relationships. I wanted what they had, I wanted to hear 'I love you' when I come home and I wanted kisses and cuddles. I emulated after them, helplessly, because that's how I thought a relationship had to look like. I was disappointed when you didn't do those things, but that's not your fault and it wasn't fair of me to expect that from you, since I never really communicated, that I wanted or needed that. You showed me your love in your way in so many different things and I was too dumb, blind, and oblivious to see the amazing person that you are and the effort you put into us. It was unfair of me to push my expectations on you and to let my pent-up frustration out on you. I should have managed better. Our relationship is our business and nobody should have any say or sway over it. I see that now," Harry said and bravely took steps forward, not quite close enough to touch but to make this talk more intimate.
"You have abso-fucking-lutly no leg to stand on, Ron, I've seen what you're doing on Valentine's day," Harry shot back, catching his bottle right before it smashed against the table. "And what is it to you? I'm happy," he added and slapped Ron's finger away.
He wasn't prepared for the loneliness, the bitterness and the
"That was so much fun!" Draco said and clapped his hands. He was still feeling giddy with pleasure and Harry smiled, pleased.
"It's alright, Potter. I'm here and alive and you're here and alive. Let's leave it at that." Potter smiles at him in gratitude and Draco wonders if he just saw tears in his eyes.
"We talked about work," she settled with and Draco supressed a chuckle. Hermione glared at him and Harry looked between the two of them confused.
He took a deep breath.
She says, and he has no shame and nods.
"I didn't mean to!" he yelled, "I wasn't thinking! I was upset and lonely and felt neglected, but that was my own fault. Draco made time for me and he had something planned yesterday I think, but I blew it like the moron I am," he said bitterly.
He sloshed the ice around a bit and gathered his thoughts. Then he looked Harry directly into his eyes, watching for any signs of a lie.
However, Harry caught up with him once he left the store.
And he knew that Potter was angry.
"Mate, where are you?" Ron Weasley shouts through the train and Potter stands up to find him. He turns around to look at Draco for a moment, but he couldn't decipher the meaning in his eyes.
"Why not?" he asked bravely, the same bravery Draco used to admire.
"Of course, Mother," Draco said indulgently, "whatever you say."
"Yes, Harry!"
"Where is your owner, Malfoy? Did he forget to put you on a leash? Hurry, get Madam Pince!" one seventh year Ravenclaw student scoffs and shoos a younger student to Madam's desk.
The god of happiness finds himself agreeing. Just eight years ago, those two humans despised each other. Now they were laughing about some sport called Quidditch.
"I was thinking of inviting another guest in two months. Maybe a woman this time?" Harry suggested and Draco pretended to think about it.
He had to accompany them to their Hogsmeade weekend and was forced to spend more time with Weasley, Granger,
"Ah yes, of course. You can still call me Alex," you assure him, but he doesn't seem to listen. His attention is on a man, who strutting down the stairs as he owns them, looking as haughty and pureblood as they come. You can't shake off the feeling, that you know him from somewhere. Potter seems ecstatic to see him though.
"You knew him?" Draco asked, ignoring her question.
"You've been to Hogwarts before, haven't you?" he asks bewildered. You nod hesitantly, not seeing the connection.
"That is so sweet!" Ron looks ready to gag, but Harry agrees with Hermione. He felt weird when he found out he was the only one in Hogwarts, who could speak Parseltongue. Except for Tom Riddle or course, but Harry didn't want to think about him. He had enough on his mind and the secret admirer was a welcomed distraction.
"Oh Harry," Hermione sighs, but Harry doesn't look at her.
"Did you behave while I was gone?" Potter asked, stroking his chin, where the bruise was. Malfoy had healed it the night before.
"What? Changed or good for me?" Harry pressed on and Hermione shifted in her seat.
"I'll grant you one shower, Harry, but then you have to go. I have a meeting with a friend," she said and left him in her bedroom for her own shower. Harry reluctantly follows. He leans in the doorframe, watching her putting something on her face. Foundation? Could be anything, really, he thought and smiled as she tiptoes to get the angle right.
"I was wondering if you would like to do the Hogsmeade duty with me," you press out and Potter eyes you critically.
"Surprise," the man drawls and his posh accent proves your pureblood theory. Now that he's coming closer you note several things at once: He's attractive. Long blond hair in a braid, that lays on his chest, silver-framed glasses on his sharp nose, high cheekbones, and cold grey eyes, which are scrutinizing you now. You refuse to hunch your shoulders or duck your head and according to the slight sneer on his face, he catches that.
"Greetings Potter," he answered and then turned, intent on getting that one bottle of wine Pansy adored. His plan was stopped by a hand on his arm. Interesting. Harry seemed to have no inhibitions touching him whatsoever.
"Alright alright, I'll spill," he says and his friends look more excited than he does. "I've met Zabini yesterday and he knows, who my secret admirer is," he rushes out and Hermione blinks two times, before a big smile plasterers over her face.
"No," he said and Harry looked surprised.
"They went out to get their feelings on the open. I presume they don't expect a reply?"
"You're one to talk! Why are you two so mushy with him, huh?! Did you forget, what he did to us all those years? He was a bloody bully and a ferret and a Death Eater! He made fun of my family, he called 'Mione a
Unfortunately, Potter was his only chance of survival. Potter bought him food and water, albeit less than he needed. Malfoy had not come down again, and he cursed himself for hoping that he would. So he passed the time, trying not to get mad.
But nobody asked Draco.
"What do you want, Potter?" Zabini sneers and Harry huffs in annoyance. This secret admirer should be thankful, that Harry was keeping up with the snakes to find him.
"We were hurt, angry and lonely and everything we had we gave to ensure the safety of everyone else," he said and Hermione had to choke back a sob. She knew, he thought about Sirius, Remus, Tonks and Fred.
"Ah, really."
And after a year and a half, he was no longer in ruins.
The goddess of destiny makes no mistakes.
Hogwarts looks much better. The castle is still healing, but the magic is there in those walls and the wind inside is like breathing. Draco touches the walls in one of the corridors to the Great Hall and he feels the presence of Hogwarts. It lets him touch it and it's warm to his hand, but he takes it back as if he got burned.
"I will consider dating you again. Deal?"
His childhood is eventless for the most part. The god knows, that the human was born with special powers, magic as the humans call it. He was born powerful and his parents try their best to train him, make him use this power, and control him. They also spoil him rotten, but the god doesn't judge. He isn't the god of love, so he doesn't know if this is right or wrong, but he likes the smile on the tiny human's face when he gets what he asked for, so he just slides through his younger years.
Apparently he had left without telling anybody anything. Granger had been appalled when she found out, that Harry went away. Weasley threatened/promised to hunt him down and Draco appreciated, that they wanted to side with him.
He was born into a wealthy family. An only child. He sees the overjoyed mother, as she cradles her son in her arms and nuzzled against his head. The tiny human likes that, the god observes. Whether it was the attention or affection, the god isn't sure. But the subject smiles at his mother and his father's face lights up a bit. A moment of true happiness, the god noticed.
"Draco! The hairpin!" Lyra yelled again and this time he couldn't contain a tired sign. Why she wouldn't just ask her servant to fetch it for her was beyond him. He suspected, she just liked to order him around as long as she still could.
"You'll be fine, dear. Just remember what we practiced," Mother assured her and Lyra swallowed heavily before straighting up.
"Good morning, Professor McGonagall," came a chorus on the left, and in the middle of the crowd, he stood. Harry Potter.
"Are you still alive?" Malfoy asked, but he could only nod weakly. He had no strength in any of his muscles.
"Yes, you proved your point. But I was right, wasn't I? He believed every second of it." Then Potter stopped laughing and stared down at him.
Draco isn't sure, what to make of that. "I'm not even sure if Potter wants to be friends with me, Headmistress," he adds quietly, sipping his tea again. McGonagall nods and relaxes in her chair.
He assures the other and the god of sadness relaxes.
"Draco Malfoy, with my dear sister, Miss Lyra Malfoy, at your service, your Majesties, Prince" Draco greeted the king, queen and Prince Harold, although not bowing deeper than he had too. Many noblemen fell on their knees tonight in hopes to gain favour, but Draco couldn't care less. He didn't need the King's favour. He would let Lyra marry a nobleman of proper standing, but even the thought of Lyra catching Prince Harold's attention was ludicrous. She might be pretty and witty, but so were many else. She wasn't special and Draco had no illusions of her becoming the future Queen, no matter what Mother said.
gave him credit for. His hair is longer now, in a bun in his neck, strands hanging loosely around his face. He grew a beard, which somehow made him younger and you itch to touch it. His clever eyes are hidden behind thin gold-framed glasses, which compliment his sun-kissed skin. Your mouth waters and you are vaguely aware, that you're staring.
"As if I'd believe you. Pansy would never do that to me," Draco sneered. "Now get out."
"No, I bloody can't, no everyone can be the Chosen one, alright? And now
You are mature enough to admit, that your reaction might have been a little childish. McGonagall hadn't really glared at you, but she was sizing you up and it felt uncomfortable. That man was likely to be his colleague and now you've gone and proved to be as immature as the children you're supposed to teach. You lost that round.
"How was it?"
The god of love asks and the god of friendship signs to Draco Malfoy and Harry Potter playing chess. The god of love gasps.
"What the hell are you talking about? I don't
He severed the contact to them all together.
he tried remained fruitless. The kidnapper must have taken it somewhere far away. So for now he could only lie and wait. And hope, that someone would miss and look for him.
"Harry, I showed you my love every day. I take you out to lunch, meet up with your family and friends, even if they hate me and clearly want me gone. I write you silly letters and buy you your favorite chocolate every Saturday. I let you ramble about everything and nothing, I give you the affection you ask for, even if I don't know how to ask or do it. You know all about me and you knew about my struggles with intimacy, Harry. You knew how my parents raised me, what they expected from me, how I grew up, how hard it was for me to come out. You knew all of this and despite that, you... you want to tell me, I don't love you enough? I don't show enough?" Draco demanded and this time Harry was shellshocked. Had he been too fixated on the physical part and the three words? But Draco didn't leave him waiting.
"I am perfectly capable of doing my research without Potter, thank you very much for your unnecessary concern," Draco says, without looking up from his book. The other student growls something
"I'll take you with me," he boldly promised and Malfoy smiled a real, kind smile and he felt like his efforts were worth it.
happy," he sobbed. "He wanted
didn't even get a whimper out of him. His pain tolerance was rather high these days.
"He's not a witch," Draco adds, and the potion master narrows his eyes, daring Draco to continue, but the Slytherin knows no fear with him, so he says, "and he's a half-blood as far as I know."
Potter. He never spoke to them, just tailing after them, buying what he needed, but apart from that, he didn't really do anything. The other Slytherins looked at him with sympathy, but Draco ignored them all. They weren't really sincere, because just a week before they cursed him to be the reason the first years were scarred to be sorted into Slytherin. Draco found that ridiculous. He wasn't in Hogwarts to harm first years and he doubted, that those children really thought that. Slytherin was always viewed to be the
“Harry, don’t go just yet.  You've got it all wrong."  Draco looked distressed.  "I understand why you were afraid, I do.  But I promise you, that’s not what I wanted.  It’s not what I want now.  We can make it work, I promise.  I don’t want to take her away from you.  I just want to know her too.  Cass needs you, Harry.  You’ve done a wonderful job raising her so far, and I want you to continue to do so.  I’m so proud of our daughter.”
“You were a child, yourself,” Harry objected.  “And yeah, I could have done without the taunts about my parents, but we were all a product of the machinations of the adults.”
“I’m so sorry that she said those things,” Potter continues.
“But the Ministry is boring, Scorpius.  Mama and Kattie will make cookies with you,” Astoria said entreatingly.
of being this child’s father threatened to overtake him.  Harry hastily made his way to the living room, where he summoned a beer, and slumped onto the sofa.
He’s beside me in an instant.  “Look, I really have to be at home, but…” he sighs.  “You can come with me.”
“I expect so.  Hopefully he doesn’t question her lineage too much.  He liked the fact that she had a star name.”
“Yes.”
“Do you trust me?”
“Why are you here with my son?” Malfoy’s voice couldn’t be more dangerous.
“Yes, of course it’s your bed,” Draco had said, still utterly confused, but Harry had simply turned over with a happy sigh and fallen asleep.  The following night, Harry had given a dubious look at the closet before toddling over and climbing into bed.
Harry made a face at her.  “You’re a terrible brat.”
“And?”
“Are you going to stay here with me?”
“I just wanted you to know that you weren’t forgotten.  It’s not the same, but…” Harry trailed off as Draco opened the book.  Inside Draco recognized Harry's looping, messy scrawl, with a number of photographs.  The first page featured an exhausted looking Harry, holding a tiny baby, grinning weakly at the camera.  “They’re all there.  All of her firsts.  I’m not much of a writer, but I did my best to describe everything.  I started it the day after she was born.”
“Look, it was amicable, and mutual.  I didn’t just storm in and break her heart or something.  And,” I add, squaring my shoulders, “something tells me that Ginny doesn’t appreciate her big brother defending her honour, or whatever it is that you’re doing.”
“I know that I don’t have any right to expect anything from you,” Harry says nervously.  “I left, and I barely stayed in contact, and I totally blew it, this moon, and I made you worried.  And maybe I’m not really the right person for you…you’re so smart, and so beautiful, and you deserve…everything, Draco.  The moon, and the stars, and the most amazing partner, and whatever else you want in life.  I just-”
“I did,” Draco says through gritted teeth.
It’s almost over, Harry tells himself.  He’s decided to renovate the top floor of Grimmauld, and the sheer amount of dark objects he’s unearthed has him at a loss.
“Oh.  Alright then.  Thanks.”
Harry’s face appeared in the flames soon after.  “Draco.”
“Why would I do that?  If it’s something bad, who do you think they’ll blame?  I don’t want anything to do with this.”
Hermione’s face softened a bit.  “Draco, I’m sorry, that was uncalled for.  It’s just a surprise to see you here.  After the way you left, I just didn’t expect to see you in Harry’s kitchen.”
“But-”
“Brought you a hangover potion,” Harry says, passing it over.  Draco consumes it with a shudder.
Harry refuses offers of a nightcap, and disappears through the door.  He’s about to apparate home, but on impulse, changes his destination at the last minute.  The snake dislikes apparation and makes its displeasure known.
“Ah.  I wondered when we would discuss this.”
“People have long memories.”
“Amulet.”
He waited six terrible hours before he broke down and sent one line, scrawled on a parchment, to Hermione:
“Merlin, Potter.”
“It’s all going to change, now,” she said.
He looks surprised, and then grins.  It transforms his face completely, and my insides give an interested little lurch.  “No, Potter, not a complete idiot.  Just…less inclined to think things through, although I suppose if I were chased by a madman for my formative years, I’d probably see the benefits of quick reactions.”
“Thank you,” I say softly.  His eyes are glazed, his pupils so enormous that I can barely see the grey of his iris.  “That was wonderful.  I’ve given you a lot to think about, I know, and if I keep kissing you, I’m going to get carried away, embarrass myself.  So I think I’ll say goodnight for now, and await your owl with your decision.  Is that alright?”
She grinned, “The half is very important.  My daughter gets quite offended when we forget to add it.”
Harry eyed the sink warily.  He had no idea how to unpick House Elf magic, and he could only imagine how Mrs. Number Ten would react when waste water and food particles ended up in her sitting room, or wherever Kreacher had set the drain to banish.  Grateful yet again for the Fidelius charm, Harry resolved to bring the matter up with Kreacher on another day.
Draco had always thought that having a broken heart was an expression, invented by overly-romantic Muggles.  However, he soon learned that it was very much a physical sensation, and he heard his own sharp intake of breath as his chest seemed to come apart in a ripping spasm.  “Of course I don’t mind, Harry.  I’ve told you all along that you only need ask.”
“Only one way to find out.”
“I won’t do it,” she said firmly.
A few weeks later, when we’re lying on his enormous, ostentatious bed, Draco sighs into my neck.  “What is it?” I ask.
“It will be okay,” he says.  “No matter what happens.”
“You have Harry sodding
Draco considers getting offended, or dressing Grace down for insubordination, but he merely says, “It isn’t like he’s seriously asking.”
“And I did,” Harry finished, placing a kiss on Cass’ forehead.  “I had a beautiful baby, and we made a life together, and I was so lucky.”
“I’m sure it’s fine,” Potter said.  “I’m sorry to be a bother.”
Harry had been through this before.  Sort of.  When he worked with Muggle families who had a first-generation wix, they sometimes worried that their child would be taken away, whisked off to a world of magic where they could not follow.  And, yes, children raised in the non-magical world did sometimes turn their back on their pasts, but Harry had learned how to reassure nervous parents.  “Malfoy, it’s not my intention to remove Scorpius from a happy home.  I truly am here to help, not destroy families.  But, make no mistake, I am
He'd been so sure that having Harry with him had been his opportunity to finally prove to himself (and others, if he were being honest) that he’d changed, that his actions were now morally correct.  But the memory of the anguish on Harry’s face when Draco had lied to protect him showed him that he was wrong.  He couldn’t change.  True, he’d never be truly evil, would never again follow the dark footsteps of another, but he was no more able to protect others than he’d been as a terrified sixteen year old.
And I am, right?  A smart man?  I want to be.  Still, I can’t help but poke the bear one last time.  “Hermione, do you know a bloke named Zach Smith?”
“Oh, sure. That’s fine,” he said, the recalled emotions still churning through him.  He turned, and saw that Draco was standing in the doorway, looking at him.  Feeling awkward, he finally said, “She…uh…she likes Quidditch.  A lot.  If…um, you were looking for a way to start a conversation with her.”
“The fu—-ah....” Harry said, realizing at the last moment that Hugo, who had taken to parroting his every word was listening avidly to their conversation.  “That’s very wrong of her, indeed,” he said with a knowing frown.
Ron stares at me for a very long time.  Finally, he says, “You know, that’s a really good question.”
He reels back in offence.  “Your nerve!”
Scorpius sat on one side of Narcissa, and Cass settled on the other.    Harry looked around the room for a moment, at all of these beautiful blonde people, and started to back away in the direction of the floo.  Narcissa caught the movement and said, “Harry, dear, you aren’t leaving, are you?  Scorpius has just told me that Cass is going to be his bone marrow donor.”
“What, Harry?”  Draco knelt down next to the boy, and suddenly, there was a number of crashing noises, as every glass in the cupboards shattered.
Hermione
“Did you need something?”
For a minute, I consider turning him down.  My thoughts are churning like the ocean, and I’m not sure if I have the capacity to deal with Draco’s grief on top of it.  But I don’t particularly want to lie in a lonely bed either.  I nod, and his eyes fill for a moment, before he mutters, “Thanks.”
“And what about magic,” Astoria asked.  “Many children your age will soon start to show signs of accidental magic.  Has that happened to you?”
“Oh.”  Something in her tone makes me tense.  This is a test, I realize, one that I didn’t mean to set.  If she really meant what she said, she won’t try to talk me out of things with Draco.  She seems to realize the same thing, because she says, “I did look into things with Parkinson.  It was strange.  I sent a few inquiries, and then, suddenly, I got an owl that said she’d been released.”
Just then, Astoria and Scorpius entered the room.  “Draco, I was thinking of heading over to my place for a while.  I need to run some errands, and I want to spend some time in the garden.”
“I understand you have something of mine?” Why did Harry look so sodding delicious?  Draco felt his hands extending, unbidden towards the flames.
“Potter, that’s…”
“My dragon is sometimes naughty,” Scorpius agreed.
When I awaken next, it’s dark.  I fumble for my glasses, and hear a sleepy mutter beside me.  “Draco?”
“Don’t bother your parents.  I’ll stay with the kids.”  It wasn’t exactly how Harry had planned to spend his evening, but he felt like this was important.
I’m nearly through telling Luna about my fabricated experience raising goats in Ireland, the summer after fourth year, when an owl arrives and taps on the window.  Recognizing it as Draco’s, I can’t help the smile that spreads across my face, and I rush to let it in.  I untie the letter hastily, but my smile falters a bit as I read it.
“Malfoy, wait!”  Draco was leaving the Ministry of Magic at a hefty pace, terrified that if he lingered too long that someone would change their mind, and he’d be placed in Azkaban along with his Father.  He turned at the sound of his name, only to find Potter, running up behind him, clutching something in his outstretched hand.
“Does it hurt?”
“Um, yes, I guess, from the press.  Yeah.”
Cass looked even more uncomfortable.  She bit her lip.  It was as though she desperately wanted to, but something was holding her back.  “Go ahead,” Draco prompted.
“My daughter,” the crying woman screamed.  “What’s happened to my daughter?”
“Cass, why don’t you tell Harry about Quidditch?”
“Oh, Cass, darling.  He didn’t have to ask.  Of course it’s alright.  More than.  I’m delighted to have you here.”  He looked a bit shamefaced.  “I should have said something, I’m sorry.  I’m not accustomed to having an older child, but of course I should have known you’d be wondering.”
“And what would you like to do for your birthday?”
“Did you just come by to play poker?”
The lesson progressed, and Harry had them all practice breaking free of various holds.  An hour later, he saw a number of parents peeking through the doors, and he waved them in.  “Okay, gang, that was really well done.  I’m so proud of you.  I’m seeing some parents arriving, and we’re nearly done.  I just have one more thing to tell you, and this is the most important thing out of everything we’ve covered.”  Harry sat on the mat and looked carefully at each girl as he spoke.
“What could you possibly be looking for there?”
“Dunno.”  I take a quick inventory.  “M'brain feels heavy.”
It had been, frankly, a terrible few days, and Harry was feeling the strain.  He hadn’t really prepared himself for being here.  He’d known that the press would be terrible, and he’d feared that his family would hate him.  They hadn’t, of course, but the relationship was strained, different.  It was impossible to resume as though things were the same as they'd been a decade before.  He hadn’t expected to find himself in legal trouble, even if the reporter had been happy to settle for a written apology and a generous payment for pain and suffering.  The medical procedure had been the worst, obviously, and if he allowed himself to think too long about how close he’d come to losing Cass, his knees got weak.
Just when Harry was beginning to think that she’d never emerge, and he’d have to force the issue, she appeared in his doorway.  She looked tired, and her eyes were red-rimmed in a way that suggested she’d shed tears, but Harry knew she’d never admit to it.  “Hey, little duck,” Harry said.
“That’s utterly shocking,” he said.
“We’ll see how you do in the second hour.  It’s going to be fine, Harry.”
, and then I decide to keep on risking my life for the same people who called me a looney in the newspaper?  When I was an actual
Draco wanted to ask more, but instead simply said, “Thank you for telling me that.  You won’t have to see them ever again.  They can’t hurt you anymore either. I promised I’d keep you safe here.”
“Oh, little duck.  You’re so smart you scare me sometimes.  But it’s not your job to-”
Even with the abridged version, it takes nearly three hours.  When they’ve finished talking, I don’t know what to say.  I sit there, silent, until Hermione asks, “Harry?”  Her voice is hesitant.
I want to pout, but he’s called me Harry, which I really like, so I say, “Then kiss me goodbye properly.”  He does, and I drift back to sleep, even if the bed feels a lot bigger and less fun than it did before.
“And when you look at Harry now, a defenseless child, what do you feel?”
“We’ll find a way to help channel her good intentions into something less intrusive,” Draco said.  Harry allowed himself a moment to bask in the idea that he wasn’t doing this on his own, that Draco and he would parent Cass together.  Then, he willed his disobedient hopes back in check, and took a sip of tea.
“Cass, I tried.  I’ve tried writing him letters, floo calling, I sent him a letter in the Muggle mail.  He isn’t answering any of them.  I even tried to get Minerva to speak to him.  He told her he just needed time.  He said he was fine.”
“No. Thank you, but I should get home and check on Mother.”
“Much improved, Mister Potter.  I think that we should have some tea, and you will tell me some interesting stories about wands.”
“Like what, Harry?”
Draco felt his forehead wrinkling.  Apparently Harry had a similar proclivity for probing at an injury until it bled more.  There had been more than one opportunity to settle things between them.  It seemed cruel to prolong the more formal ending of their relationship any further, but Draco supposed he owed Harry whatever he needed to seek closure.
“Shut up, Potter, I’m thinking,” Draco says crossly, and immediately regrets it, since Harry’s face falls, and takes on an expression that Draco hasn’t even seen before.  And then Draco realizes that he doesn’t
Draco puts a hand on my cheek.  “I’m probably not the best person to advise you on this, you realize.”
“Of course, Master Draco,” Kreacher said, and popped away with a loud crack.
The day dragged endlessly on.  His Mother would go long periods where her exhaled breath would finish, and no further inhalation happened.  Draco would tense, thinking this was the end, only to hear her gasp another agonizing breath and begin the cycle again.  He looked around the empty room.  This was the last of the Malfoys.  His beautiful mother, dying in a room with a son who’d disgraced her, nobody else here to notice, or mourn, or bide.  Everyone who had been anyone to them was gone, either dead, or imprisoned, or had fled the country after the war.  What a stupid fucking waste, Draco thought.
“Harry,” his voice was croaky.  “You’re here.”  His mind stupidly grappled with seeing someone from his other life here in his new one.
“Is Jemima your friend?”
“Ron, shut up,” Hermione says.
“You don’t think he’s serious?”
“Thanks Dad.  I know you wanted to go home a while ago.”
“I don’t think so,” I answer.  “But you’re welcome to it, if you can find it.”
“You’re willing to give up on a fun time with your sister, just to get your own way?”
Harry pulled out his wand, prompting a gasp from Violet’s mother and a look of confusion from her father.  He waved it gently, and the tea cup in front of him turned into a tiny baby chick, who blinked at him in confusion.
“You did,” Draco said, trying hard not to sound gentle. “But I don’t think that was your goal.”
“I’m good.  A little sore.”
When they reached the cozy little house, perched on the corner of a quiet street, surrounded by enormous Maple trees, Harry felt tension dissipate from his spine, like releasing a fist he hadn’t realized he was clenching.  Home.  He patted the front door lovingly as it unlocked at his touch.    Entering the spacious kitchen, as the lights flared to life, he noticed an owl sitting on the windowsill.  Cass clattered into the kitchen behind him, throwing her school bag into a corner, and immediately grabbing an apple from the bowl on the table. “Can you call for the pizza while I deal with this owl?” Harry asked.
“Because, you stupid prat, you’re still my fucking favourite.”
“It’s good.  I’m on break.”
“And both of us love him more than we love ourselves,” she said softly.  Harry shrugged.  It was true, but the words were too difficult to say.  “Harry, dear,  I’ve admired your strength of character since you were a little boy, and I’ve been very fond of you since you started coming over for tea after the war.  I love Draco dearly, but he has never been unguarded, and so he doesn’t understand how to treat those who are.  It makes him more careless than I’d like.  You’ve already sacrificed yourself once for the good of others.  Please don’t be in such a hurry to do so again.”
6 Weeks
Scorpius raised his head and regarded Harry for a long time.  His eyes, so large in his little face, reminded Harry of someone’s, but he figured that, with the amount of inbreeding in the Wizarding world, his parents were related to someone he knew.  Harry met Scorpius’ gaze, letting him think it through.  “Okay,” Scorpius finally said.  “Let’s go home to my Papa.”
Scorpius looked down at his knees.  He worried the hole in his pants, ripping it a little, and then a fat tear rolled down his cheek and dropped onto his thigh.  “I did magic again,” he said softly, and then let out a little sob.
a dragon story.  Her little forehead wrinkles, and she says, “Oh.  Right. Memory.”  I shrug apologetically, but she suddenly smiles.  “I’ll tell it to you,” she says, patting my arm to comfort me.
“Um, I just…”
“Been flying all morning.  Tryouts for the Harpies soon,” she says.  I assume she means Quidditch, which, I’m told, is brilliant.
anywhere else, other than Ron and Hermione’s, and I assume they’re at work.  As I stroll down the street, there’s a bit of fuss, people clamouring and coming up to me and whatnot.  I smile, and shake a few hands, pleasantly refuse to sign anything, and soon enough, the crowd dissipates.  There’s a big bookshop, and that consumes an hour.  The saleslady is kind enough to shrink my books for me, and I place the tiny bag in my pocket, wondering how I’ll get them big again.  It’s still better than having my arms full.
“It’s nothing more than hard work, and a bit of luck, I suppose.  Mental health isn’t always the same as physical health.  You can’t predict how quickly or slowly someone’s symptoms change, or if they will at all.  I’ve done a lot of things that I didn’t expect I would over the last while, and I’ve come a long way.  I imagine I’ll always have the odd intrusive thought, and be prone to some compulsions under stress, but they’re much easier to overcome right now.”
I suppose you’ll need to come get it
“Yes, obviously you are.”  Harry is desperate to distract Draco.  His hands steal down to Draco’s cock, encircling the flesh and stroking it to hardness.
“My Grand-Mère,” Cass said, crossing the room to stand in front of Narcissa.  She smiled at her, and said, “My dad made me a photo album when I was little.  Your picture was always my favourite.”
“That may be,” Wendell agrees.  “But, Boy Hero, you might want to ask better questions about your highly curious memory loss, and why nobody seems eager to help with it.”
Hermione reminded me four separate times that I’ve an appointment at the Ministry this morning, so I floo through, and land in a spacious Atrium.  The location is familiar, but distantly, as though it’s a place I once dreamed.  I walk past the coffee kiosk, and towards the lifts, but I’m stopped by a statuesque woman in red robes.  “Harry,” she says, and her smile transforms her rather plain face into something sort of beautiful.
“Well?” Miriam asked, after she’d explained the plans to him. “Are you willing to take this journey with me?”
“It’s fine, Cass, honestly.  From the sounds of things, you have exactly the wand you need.  Besides, I’ll tell you a little secret.  Any ideas on where the basilisk scale came from?”
“Hi everyone,” Harry said, once the noise level had diminished a little.  “I’m happy to see you all again.  Today we’re covering the last bit of self defence, and then next time we see each other, we’ll begin doing some basic first aid.  You’ve all done brilliantly so far, and today will be about showing me everything you’ve learned.”
“Well, as you know, we’re nearly finished our regular sessions together.  You’ve done beautifully, and you have so much to be proud of.”  Draco flushed and grinned, and Lara continued, “I really only think that there’s one thing that we haven’t resolved.”
Draco is disgustingly drunk.  His shirt is halfway unbuttoned, and his hair bears evidence of someone running their hands through it.  Somehow, he’s lost a shoe.  “Harry,” he whispers urgently.
Harry presents himself at Ron and Hermione’s door, ready for babysitting duty.  Hermione is walking around on one heel, muttering under her breath and trying to find the mate to her shoe.
I laugh.  “I don’t.  It doesn’t matter to me, really, but if you want help, I can try.”
noticed the things Draco was trying to hide?
“It’s Harry.  This is my chance to…”
“So if his core is smaller, that means he’d have to give it time to grow, or else-Wait…Master of what?”
Harry decided to tell Cass about the situation in England the next morning.  He was no closer to a decision himself, but he didn’t believe in keeping secrets, and Cass would only break into his mind to find out what was bothering him.  They settled in the living Room, with tea.  Minerva offered to make herself scarce, but Harry asked her to stay.
-Harry encounters a child who is being abused, resulting in the child's removal from the home and placement in foster care.  There is a small amount of evidence of physical abuse, which is not described in detail.
“Are you ready?  To see Draco?”
“Please do.”
Draco smiled.  “Mostly, yeah.  I worry that if I go out, I’ll get exposed to some sort of disease, and then infect the house, and the moment my Mother or someone comes here, they’ll get sick, and it will be my fault.  It’s mad, really.”
Shit, he’s abruptly, poshly, furious now.  “Who told you about my sexual orientation, and how dare you make it into some sort of joke?”
“No, that’s true.  I’d be far better if you asked me to wash some windows or something.”
“It’s almost a relief, Mother,” Draco whispered, once again sitting by Narcissa’s bedside.  “Of course, it’s not, really.  But seeing him, knowing that he isn’t mine anymore, it’s awful.”  He opened the book of poetry and began to read.
“I don’t understand why it matters!  You didn’t give a fuck about the Slytherins when we were at school, and you certainly didn’t give a fuck about them after the War.  Don’t suddenly grow a conscience.”
"What about flobberworms?”
“Yes, of course.  Use the one in my office, it’s quieter,” Draco said.  He looked away, then looked back and gave Harry a little smile, and his eyes flared with something that looked suspiciously like lust, just for a moment.  Harry, a little overwhelmed, ducked his head and made his way to Draco’s office, where he slumped into Draco’s desk chair and tried to catch his breath.
“My son,” he says, and then he’s gone, and the door shuts firmly, and I sit there, stunned, in the dark.
I nod.  I hadn't thought of that. “That too.  Now I have Draco.”
“We are,” Harry agrees.  “If we’re intruding, you need only say, but I brought some groceries.  Didn’t want you to have to go out to the shops if you needed anything.”
I take a breath, and then another, and feel myself relax marginally, and say, “Yeah, okay.”  He gradually pushes inside me, inch by patient inch, until I feel his legs against my thighs, and his balls against my arse.  “Draco,” I sigh.  “More.”  He fucks me, gently at first, and then, as he becomes sure that my moans are of pleasure and not pain, harder, faster.  His arm snakes around to encircle my cock, and I’m incapable of speech, offering only a litany of moans and sighs.
It didn’t take long to gather all of Harry’s things and put the potions into a charmed carrier that would prevent them from breaking.  Hermione shrunk them all down, and Ron carried Rose in one arm, and guided Harry in the other as they disappeared through the floo.  Hermione was about to follow them, when she suddenly turned back, “Thank you, Draco, for being so understanding.  I don’t think it will take him long to get over this, but I know it will mean a lot to him that you gave him the space he needed.  I’ll be in touch.”
“They are.  May I speak with you?”
“I suppose because I wasn’t aware that I was in his way,” Draco replied.  “It does seem surprising that Harry wouldn’t have mentioned it to me.”
And, even if he found the courage to lay his heart bare, to ask Harry to stay for a while, he wasn't sure whether Harry would trust him enough to remain.  Long ago, Draco had made fun of Harry’s immense ability to trust and forgive, but he wasn't sure that was true any longer.   No matter, he resolved, as he followed the birthday celebration to the dining room, he'd convince Harry to give them a chance.  For Cass' sake.  For Draco and Harry's sake.  He’d figure it out, Draco promised himself.
He gestures for me to sit, so I do.  “How are you feeling?”
Harry and Astoria both ganged up on Draco when he decided to fuck Lockhart, but eventually agreed that Hagrid wasn’t exactly shaggable.    Draco was just about to plead that Filch wasn’t even a teacher, and was therefore exempt from consideration, when the door opened.
Harry hadn’t wanted much when the war ended.  He said a polite ‘no thank you,’ to the Aurors, and a less-polite ‘fuck no’ to the Minister, who wanted him to be some sort of Ambassador.  Fortunately, Kingsley had laughed, told him that he hadn’t expected him to accept, and wished him luck in what he
Draco tensed.  He hadn’t seen or spoken to any of the members of the golden trio in years.  He and Granger (
“No, darling.  You aren’t like him.  Not by any stretch of the imagination.  I didn’t tell you, because I didn’t want you to be ashamed of something that you’re able to do.  The only reason I told you now is because I needed you to understand why it’s so upsetting for me.”
“Dennis Creevey?”
“Don’t…” Harry’s voice had come out weakly.
, Harry begged silently.
Draco felt a long-forgotten sense of indignation at being unjustly accused.  “I’m not up to anything, Weasley.  If you recall,
His smile is hesitant. “That’s good,” he says finally.
“Yes, as I understand it, he will, but the treatment is, by nature, experimental, and there’s no guarantee.  Hermione learned, as she researched Draco’s application, that the best chance that Scorpius has for survival is by receiving a bone marrow donation.”  She waited for Harry to say something, but the rising terror that was currently flooding his adrenal system prevented him from speaking.  “Harry, if Scorpius receives a donation from a sibling donor, his chances of survival are quite excellent.”
“I just don’t want this to be too hard for you.”
.  Harry had always been fine.  When he was walking around Hogwarts, chased by a madman, Draco remembered him telling his friends he was fine.  When, shortly after they had started dating, Andromeda had moved to France, taking Teddy with her, Harry had been fine.  When Draco had refused to go to the Burrow, Harry had been fine.  Harry was always fine, especially when he wasn’t fine at all.
, he reminded himself,
“If you say so,” Draco sniffs.  “Now go.  You’re in my light and I need to finish this.”
His tiny, innocent self had hoped that, the moment he described his home life, he’d be whisked away to family that would treat him nicely, but he nodded, and waited.  Two evenings later, a social worker had arrived at the house.  Harry had been sent up to Dudley’s second bedroom while Petunia and Vernon had spoken to the man.  An hour later, he left, and Vernon had fetched him, his eyes promising retribution.  He still didn’t know what the Dursleys had told the social worker, but whatever it had been, it had convinced him, and Harry’s teacher, that Harry was a liar.  The teacher had sent him a filthy look when he returned to school, and nothing more had ever been said about it.  Harry’s punishment had left bruises on his arms and torso for days.
“How long?”
“A bit sensitive?”  Harry knew, deep-down, that he should walk away.  That having this conversation, one they’d very, very carefully avoided for years, would result in things being said that couldn’t be taken back.  But he was unable to back down.  “What do you mean by that?”
“You don’t exactly have the best relationship with the press, Harry,” Hermione says.  “They published all sorts of terrible things about you in school, and they hounded you like crazy after the War until-”
“They don’t understand you, as I’m sure you’re aware.”
Draco’s a wreck.  His emotions have gone through the wringer in the span of the past day, and the clever, Slytherin part of his brain acknowledges that he’s in no shape to be making any sort of life-altering decisions.  Then he looks at Harry.  Harry, who’s biting his lip, and trying not to look hopeful.
“Alright,” Draco said, “let’s explore your theory a little further.  Let’s say that Ginevra Weasley has been somehow dosing Potter…Harry,” he amended quickly when Hermione gave him a look, “with some form of control potion for four years.  What’s her end game?  She can’t keep potioning him forever, can she?”
“Well, obviously, Hermione and I are doing an excellent job at showcasing the highlights of marriage.  When are you going to find someone?”  His grin was wry, but Harry knew he wouldn’t get out of answering the question.
“But son, if you’ve lost your memory, you might change your mind, once you get it back.”
“That you are.”
“No, Dad,” Cass spat, whipping around to face Draco.  “You don’t get to criticize how I’ve been raised.  You don’t even know me!  You don’t know what I need.  You don’t know that my dad is raising me to be a strong woman who doesn’t need to be told what to do.  You don’t know that he is always there, anytime I need support.”
Draco busily served drinks, watching Harry out of the corner of his eye, and resolving to finally talk to him after the meal.  Now that he’d admitted the truth to himself, he couldn’t stop staring at the little flecks of grey that had begun to appear at his temple, and the way his eyes never strayed from Cass, even when he was speaking to another.  It was as though a night away from his daughter had been like a week without water, and he couldn’t stop drinking her in.
“Red,” he says.  “Aurors wear red robes.”
Dennis’ face goes pink, and his grin encompasses his entire face.  His eyes are filled with hope.  Draco smiles back at him, and quickly engages Hermione in a discussion about her job.  He listens with half an ear, until his gaze lands on Harry.  Harry, who is examining Dennis Creevey with an inscrutable look on his face.  His eyes flick to Draco’s, and for just a moment, Harry is completely unguarded.  There’s something in Harry’s eyes, something vulnerable, and young, and hurt.  Draco wonders if Dennis Creevey has managed something that nobody else has.  Perhaps Dennis has a real chance at Harry Potter’s heart.
“Hi Narcissa.  Yeah, I try to do exactly what I promise Cass.”
“I did, he’ll be here momentarily.  Are his injuries serious?”
One night, he’s fallen asleep on the sofa when there’s an almighty banging at the front door.  He stumbles to the door, hair looking like he’d been in a violent windstorm, glasses clutched in one hand.  As he opens the door, Draco stumbles through, landing on his knees.  He’s crying so hard he can’t catch his breath.  “I can’t-I can’t…I need…”  Harry picks him up like a child, carries him to the sofa.  Draco is clutching at his shirt, sobs wracking his too-thin frame.  Harry shushes him, rubs his back, coos at him.  Finally, when the storms abate, Draco’s red-rimmed eyes meet his.  “I’m sorry,” he says wearily.
“So, tea, and then a chat, I suppose,” he said, just as lightly.
She considers him for a long moment, looking directly at him.  “Your motives are pure,” she says finally, and Draco and Hermione both seem to sag with relief.  “The surrender of your magic is a great sacrifice.  Have you searched your heart to ensure that you wish this?”
“Erm, Malfoy, I think that bit’s clean,” Weasley said, and indeed, Draco had been scrubbing the same tile for rather a while.  He gave it three more wipes for good measure, and sat up.
“True,” he acknowledges, “and yet it’s the most widely read publication in our community.  Accurate or not, the general public will accept what they say without question.”
Standing on the doorstep, Hermione says, “I don’t really know what to say, what to do.”
“Voldemort,” Draco says.  Harry nods.
Healer Cici’s owl arrived just before Draco was about to go to bed.  He untied the parchment from the unassuming owl’s leg, and it hooted once before disappearing back out the window.  The letter was short:
“What’s his name?”
“So then what?”
“Astoria, you are overstepping your boundaries,” Draco warned.
“Potter’s gay?”
“In a bit, love.”
“She's got a point, though,” Astoria said cheerfully.  “It’s good for you, having another woman to call you on your crap.”
Since the healer had grown up in the United States, and had very little understanding of the war against Voldemort, John didn’t react at all, save saying, “Oh, my mistake.  Mr. Malfoy.  Scorpius is expected to be perfectly fine.  He is magically exhausted, and there were a number of small lacerations.”
Harry felt tears welling up in his eyes.  He didn’t deserve their concern.  He’d let them all down, run away again, abandoned his daughter.  “Harry, let’s focus on what you can expect here over the next little while.”
Draco was watching her intently, his eyes searching her face, her eyes, her hair, her hands.  “Hello Cass,” he said softly.
“A little.  Bad wizard.  Hated Muggles.”
“You’re darned right we are.  Where are we going to hit or kick?”
“Well, my Father was otherwise engaged, and therefore unavailable to commit me to someone, and my Mother…well.  It’s complicated.”
Her red cheeks grow crimson, and she looks at her feet.  “No,” she says softly.  “I haven’t enough magic.”
“Yes, Aunt Bellatrix seemed to enjoy other pastimes,” Draco said carefully.  Torture, for one, his mind supplied helpfully.
“You were sometimes, unintentionally, very destructive.   There are a few areas of the Ministry that still aren’t the same.  People noticed, and they started to get concerned.  Everyone knew that you weren’t doing it on purpose, but it wouldn’t be long before one of your outbursts got someone hurt, and that would just contribute to the cycle of you feeling responsible.  There was concern about the Public finding out, and jumping to conclusions.”
“You protect those you love.”
Nodding to himself, Harry returned to where his daughter was sitting on her bed, watching him thoughtfully.  He pulled her into a tight hug, stroked her curls, kissed her forehead.  “I love you, little duck,” he said.
Harry groaned.  “What is it?” Cass asked.
“How?”
“What are you talking about?”
I throw my hands up in the air.  “It’s not about that, okay?  I don’t know why I was an asshole to your classmates, and I don’t know why I cared about them just before I lost my memory.  I don’t want to be involved in any of this!  I have no idea why I walked to my death like an idiot, and I don’t know why I was throwing myself in the path of murderous assholes.  I want nothing to do with the fucking Ministry of Magic.  I want to work at an ice cream shop, and I want to shag you, and I maybe want to go build a cabin in the woods, and I want to be fucking
“Did that work?”
“It isn’t easy,” Draco agreed.  “But when your child is sick, you have to get friendly with the unknown.  Let’s be honest, up until you came back, we weren’t at all certain Scorpius was going to see his next birthday…” He had to stop for a second, because just saying the words made his eyes tear, and his throat feel thick.  “But, you can only live in complete terror for a while, before it becomes…well not normal, exactly, but familiar.”
“Most days,” she says.  “We all hate when August comes, because everyone gets their Hogwarts letters, and then the lineup is down the street.  It’s hard though.  Being a family-owned business, we’re pretty much always here.”
After they’d sat there a while, Draco basking in the comfort of his mother, Narcissa spoke.  “What shall we do to get him back, then?”
don’t forget everything that’s happened between us.  In the meantime, though, I’d really, really like to kiss you properly.  May I?”
“But Harry, that doesn’t make any sense.” Draco felt his frustration rising.  “This isn’t how it was supposed to end at all.”
Harry could have sworn that Draco looked relieved.  “Oh, yes, that’s fine.  Good.”  He looked uncertain for a moment, and then took a breath, and said, “Better than good.  I’d…hoped…that we could get to know one another again.  I meant what I said last night.  I don’t think I ever got over you.”
“And I don’t know what to tell you.”  He kisses me gently.  “Do you think that maybe you should watch the memories?”
Harry was watching her face carefully, and so he had the dubious pleasure of seeing the exact moment that Cass’ trust in him shattered.  There was a split second of desperate pain, and then her expression became very cold, and very measured.  She stood up, smoothed down her t-shirt and ran a hand through her tangled curls.  “I think that I will spend time alone in my room, now.”
So Draco did.  He folded his robes, and crawled into the bed in his boxers and a t-shirt.  Harry was already under the covers.  His arms wrapped around Draco and he stroked his hair.  “Just sleep, Draco.”
“Harry-” Draco looked helplessly across the table, rising to his feet as well.
“Yeah,” I whisper back.  The room is quiet and dark, and we both lie, alone with our thoughts, tethered by the grip of our hands.  Until, that is, I hear the tiniest little gasp, and I realize that Draco is crying.  The day has been…a lot, and I don’t really know what to do with his emotion, already feeling overwhelmed by my own thoughts.  But as the bed shakes with his silent sobs, and his sadness covers us like a blanket, I do the only thing that seems right, and I pull him into my arms, and let his tears drip down my neck, and he clings to me like a frightened child until the dawn breaks.
I hear him whisper an incantation, and my hole is suddenly loose, and wet, and I have just enough time to resolve to ask him about the charm later when his cock breaches me, and I gasp at the sudden stretch.  He stills.  “Okay?”
“Oh no.”
I feel myself grinning, heat climbing my neck, and clearly that’s a typical response, because Hermione just huffs, and says, “It’s time to go to the Burrow.”
“Well, when the noise of your thoughts wake me up at five in the morning, and you come to breakfast looking scared, I don’t have a choice!” Cass snapped.
“I have to go,” Harry said suddenly.  “I can’t be here, when you tell your parents.  I have to go.  Where can I go?  What do I do?” He seemed suffused by panic, and Draco understood.  Sometimes, the horror of a situation came in waves, each one more overwhelming than the previous one.
“How does it even work?”
“You’ve been very helpful, Healer Patterson.  I appreciate your time.”
“Are you sure about that?”
“Surprising?” Ron roars, and Jesus, I’ve had about enough of this bloke.
The sky, which had been sunny, had become a bit grey and gloomy, and Harry wondered idly if it would rain.  Time passed, and he watched the clouds roll in, and caught a distant rumble of thunder.
“Um, yessir.  Water under the bridge,” Harry said, giving Draco a wide eyed look of panic.
“Any desires to achieve immortality?”
Cass shrugged.  “After Dad moved to Canada, but before I was born, the portrait was delivered one day.  Uncle Professor insisted on having himself shipped to be with us.  He told Auntie Min that he wasn’t about to see another Potter child left to the mercies of the world.”
“Why are you like this?” Draco asked suddenly.  “The Harry I used to know wouldn’t have hesitated to call me a bastard for what I did.”
“Cass,” Harry said warningly.
“Night,” Harry muttered absently, his eyes not moving from the stack of parchment in front of him.
“Were you scared?” Draco asked.
“Yeah.  Just some plans that fell through.”  I try to hide my disappointment, but her smile is sympathetic.
Mill looks a bit embarrassed.  “Wards aren’t cheap, Harry.  By the time I pay for Vi’s preschool, we’re just getting by.”
supportive of his intent to give up on Harry and make a life of his own.  It hurt, the acknowledgement that it wasn’t going to happen, but he knew that it wasn’t doing him any good to sit around moping.  (Even if he did indulge in a little mope from time to time.  He wasn’t perfect, after all.)  The worst part was how aggressively she adjusted his treatment plan.  She’d been content before to lead him slowly down the path to improved mental health, but it appeared that she was simply waiting for him to find the motivation in himself before she put the pressure on.
“They are fish.  Anchovies.  Do you like?”
“Azkaban.  Yes, they are.  Including his father,” Hermione says.
“Don’t,” she howled, even as she suspected that she was losing control of her emotions a little.  “Don’t say anything about my Daddy!  He’s good, and he does his best, and he loves me.  Even…even if…”. The tears took over, and she couldn’t speak, even if she wanted to.
Draco stared at him.  “Um, no.  I came to see Harry, actually.”  At the mention of his name, Harry turned, and looked at Draco in surprise.  A series of expressions crossed his face, and then he finally settled on something that looked curious, or at least, not particularly hostile.
He faltered as he went to sign off, until, with a shrug, he wrote:
“Hmm?”
“And you think it is helping you?”
Now, it was the third day, and it was time to administer the next dose.  Draco was hopeful that five-year-old Harry would be a bit more communicative.  Speaking of, Hermione and Ron appeared through the floo, Rose bouncing in Ron’s arms.  “Hiya Harry!” Ron was cheerful, and Harry looked at him cautiously.  He had grown slightly more convinced of his relative safety, and less hesitant to respond to people, so long as the people were Draco, and Kreacher, and occasionally, Hermione.  When Ron spoke to him, Harry was inclined to hide his face behind his hands.  He ignored Rose completely.
“Oh, Harry.  I’m so sorry!”
“Surprisingly, I think I might feel alright about it.  My Father…”
“Mr. Harry, will you come home with us?” Scorpius asked.  “Just to make sure things are okay?  My dragon is calmer when you’re with me.”
I order a double scoop of treacle delight.  I couldn’t tell you what it tastes like, but something tells me I’ll enjoy it.  Rose, who’s smart enough to take advantage of opportunities, quickly orders her two choices, and they’re ringing us up quick, before Hermione and Ron have noticed what’s happening.  We exchange a delighted glance, and Rose pops off to find a table while I pay.
“Thank you.  How…” Draco’s voice cracked, for just a moment, before he regained his composure.  “How long?”
“Alright, Harry,” Draco replied, and he went and got tea for all three of them anyway.  When he returned, Harry was sitting on the floor outside the room.  To Draco’s surprise, Astoria was sitting beside him.  Draco couldn’t remember a time when Astoria has done something so undignified, in public no less, but she was sitting close, and Harry’s head was on her shoulder while she spoke quietly to him.  Harry’s eyes were red-rimmed, and Draco intuited that he had given way to his fear while Draco was away.  He knew that Astoria would set him right, but he still couldn’t completely quash the tiny flare of totally irrational jealousy.
“I’m not going to touch you, Scorpius, but I’m going to stay right here next to you as long as you need me to.  If you feel like telling me what you need, you can, but if you just need to be sad, that’s okay too.”  Cass crossed her legs and sat very near to Scorpius, not touching him, but within his line of vision.  Draco watched, curious.
“What’s your name?” Scorpius asked the lady behind the desk.
Minerva had saved his sanity.  She’d made arrangements, via an ex-student, to get Harry’s approval to emigrate to Canada.  The Canadian Ministry had heard of Harry Potter, and they’d been happy to fast-track the process.  She’d contacted Garrick, and arranged for him to complete his apprenticeship via floo.  Poppy agreed to portkey to him for his medical appointments.  She’d even found him a house to live.  By the next week, he was standing in her office, his belongings packed, and staring at his former Head of House rather forlornly.  “Oh, come here, child,” she said gently, and gathered him into her arms.
He stares at me for a long, long moment, his eyes scanning my face, his mind working fast.  Finally, he seems to come to a decision.  “Bed,” he says hoarsely.
“Of course.  I’ll swear a blood vow to you if required.”
She grins.  “You’d think so.  This is my parent’s shop.  I’m the eighth generation of Fortesque to work here.”
He finished his drills, and set up a quick scrimmage with the dummies.  When he managed to evade the defenders and bury the puck into the top right corner of the net for the fifth time, he decided he’d had enough training for the day.  He skated over to where Harry was sitting, and stopped quickly, showering Harry with a spray of ice from his blades.
“Well obviously he doesn’t want to hurt you Draconus.  But you can’t give him the family he’s always longed for.  Surely you see that you don’t belong?”
Harry couldn’t help but remember the one and only time he’d tried to get away from the Dursley’s special brand of ‘care’.  He’d been seven, and his teacher had led a discussion about bullying, which made him realize that the way Dudley treated him wasn’t officially condoned.  Their teacher had continued to explain that nobody was allowed to hurt them, that if someone was hitting or shaking or slapping them, they could find a trusted adult to assist.  Harry had spent a long time thinking about this.  He didn’t
“Do you realize that I’ve been angry at myself, mostly?”
“Darling,” Narcissa continued, as though her addled husband hadn’t just wandered away with his daughter, “do you really think that a liaison with Harry Potter would have been anything but positive for our family’s reputation?  More importantly, did you not think I noticed how happy you were when you were with him?  I was so pleased that you’d become friends, and I didn’t realize that it was something more until after it had ended.”
Draco’s face twisted.  “I don’t need your help,” he snapped.  “Why are you even giving me any?  It’s not like you wanted me to get to know her before this.”
“Why would someone set you up?”
“Smooth,” Draco says dryly, when he returns.
“Merlin, Granger, tell me that someone stopped you.  Tell me that this wasn’t the basis of your entire theory,” Draco pleads.
“Oh that’s wonderful Draco.  I’m so glad you’re home though.  There’s a lot of unfinished business here for you.”
“None of this is helping us find Harry,” Hermione said.  “Ron, think, where would Ginny go?”
Draco gave Cass a look of pure incomprehension.  “I don’t know how that would even work.  We’ve never had a Muggle visit the house before.  We’d need to disillusion quite a few magical things.”
I should, and I do.  It’s clear that Mill needs the attention diverted from her for a moment anyway.  The owl is from Draco, and I can’t quell the anticipatory lust I feel from seeing his name written at the bottom of the parchment.
Draco spelled the lights low, so as not to disturb Scorpius.  Harry was still in Cass’ bed, but he’d wriggled a little so that they shared the small space.  Draco cast a cushioning charm on the hard bedside chair, and tried to get comfortable.
She bites her lip, and looks closely at me.  Luna has huge eyes, and they’re a bit disconcerting when they’re focused so intently.  I try to keep my gaze level, even though I’d quite like to look away.  “Harry, I’m not sure about this, but I have a feeling I might be right.  I think that Hermione took more than just your memories.”
“I’m sorry?”
“Listen, I just wanted to let you know, I’m going back to the Burrow, picking up Rose, yeah?  Harry’s out like a light, he’s been bathed, and I put him to bed.”
“Now, I think.  I’ll just gather my things.  I won’t be long.”
“For what it’s worth,” I say, stroking her hair a little, “I’m really sorry that you’re hurting.  I’m pretty sure I would never hurt you on purpose.”
Harry blushed.  “Hush, you.  You’re going to start all sorts of rumours.”
“Alright,” he agreed.  Draco gave her a grateful glance and she winked.
“I know,” he agreed.  “Any particular reason?  Or just in general?”
“Well, it only makes sense,” Wendell says.  “Bad blood will out.”  For some unfathomable reason, this sentence fills me with unsurmountable rage, but Ron catches a look at my face, and places a restraining hand on my arm.
“I’m sorry,” he said.  “I never thought that he’d…”
There’s a glass on the table, and without stopping to think what he’s doing, Harry picks it up and flings it into a corner, where it shatters.  Dean stops, and looks at him in shock.  “Sorry,” Harry mutters.  “I felt like helping.”  Dean barks a startled laugh, which just as quickly turns into a sob, and he launches himself into Harry, who wraps his arms around him tight.  They sink to the ground, and Harry lets him cry and cry.  He squeezes him tight, until Dean runs out of tears.
“That’s yew,” Madame replied.  “Good wand for healers, necromancers.  A resilient wood, a wand for rebirth, change.  This wood is used to light the Beltane fire.  The holder of this wand will shed the world of old pain, and welcome a new dawn.”
“You have.  I’d like to recommend that you take the opportunity to have a shower, get dressed in something other than pyjamas, and then we’ll speak again.  I can outline your treatment plan, and answer any questions you might have.”
I snort.  “Obviously.”
“Why hasn’t he woken?” Draco asked worriedly.
“I wish you were still with us.”
“Slipped my mind,” Draco replies, immersing himself in the tricky charms work again.
“Draco?”  Yanked back from his thoughts, Draco looked up.  Harry’s eyes were incredibly beautiful.  Draco didn’t think he’d ever seen such a lovely shade of green in his life.  “Are you listening?”
Miriam smiled.  “I’m afraid that it’s a little late for that.  It was actually your daughter who found you.”
Cass smiled.  “That’s what Dad says about his, too.  But I am starting to piece it together.”
Draco watched the exchange suspiciously.  He couldn’t figure out what Potter was up to.  He sounded so sincere, as though he didn’t bear Draco any ill will at all.  Maybe he was telling Cass terrible things about Draco in private.  The child certainly looked at him critically enough.  And why was she so concerned with looking after him?  What was wrong with Harry, that his child needed to take care of him? It was irrational, Draco knew, but he couldn’t help feeling jealous of their closeness.  Harry and Cass didn’t seem to need anyone else.
The room went quiet.  “It’s because everyone always forgets the Hufflepuffs,” Hannah said mildly.  “We’re quieter than the other houses, but we have value.  I just don’t like us being forgotten.”
“He is,” she calls back.
“That’s messed up.  I’m surprised old me didn’t do more to help.”
“Want to come to my study?”
Draco looked shattered for a moment.  “Did you really think that?  That I wouldn’t have said it back?”
Draco smiled, “Has anything in the past few weeks given you the impression that you’re unwelcome?”
They arrived through the Healer’s floo ten minutes early for their appointment, and Scorpius immediately made his way to the books and toys in the corner.  After checking in, Draco sat in a chair nearby, and watched as his son chatted to the little girl who was there as well.  “How old are you?” The little girl was eying him appraisingly.
“I…” Draco doesn’t know, actually, but Harry looks beautiful standing there, so he crosses the room quickly, and wraps his arms around him.
“Cass, mostly.”
He’s not my type, too big and burly, but I appreciate the sentiment, and this is the second time he’s let me in without paying, so I widen my eyes at him and grin.  His hand lingers on my back as he opens the door for me, and I am immediately glad that I decided to come.
“She should.  Do you know anything about your parents’ medical history?”
“Pans.”  Draco breathed her name into her hair as he held her tightly.  “It’s wonderful to see you.”
“I hate this.”
“George warded it up after the war!” Hermione cried.  “Said he couldn’t bear to use it anymore.”
“Lucius, dear?” Narcissa had gotten to her feet.
He shakes his head.  “I have to go back to the Manor, Potter.”
Narcissa had paled during Draco’s venom-laden retort, but as he finally ran out of steam, she seemed to wilt.  Suddenly, the proud, hard woman looked old.  The patrician lines of her face crumbled a little and her lower lip trembled, in much the same way baby Harry’s had just a few moments ago.  “My darling,” she whispered, “it seems that there is no end to the number of ways I can wrong you.  I am ashamed.  You’re right, utterly and completely.  I’m so sorry.”
“Mama!” Scorpius cried, and ran to the floo, wrapping his arms around his Mother.
“Hi sweetheart, you’re all settled?”
“I don’t understand any of this secret sneaking stuff,” Cass said, once they were drinking tea in the sitting room of their guest quarters.
“I insist.  Draco, you’ve treated your friends poorly, and you know it.  Even if you can’t regain the past, even if you don’t speak to us ever again, we deserve the right to properly say goodbye to you.”
“So,” Narcissa said cooly, “it seems that you remain somewhat emotional in your deportment.”
“Well, she might say she was brewing something cosmetic, or bruise salve.”
“Mmmhm?” Draco asked, not removing his eyes from the window.
“And this is the best way to do it?” He pulls me over to a shady arbour, and sits me down on the bench, straddling it so that he can look at me.  “Do you think that a fresh slate will really work?”
“I think you’re right.”
“How did I get here?”
“Harry,” Draco kept his voice soft, “what do they do to you?”
“Tell me?”
“Sometimes, they work out exactly as they should.”
“Do you need anything?”
“Yes, cheri.  I am sorry.  I have been sorry since the moment I vowed on my magic to betray him.”
“No,” I reply honestly.  “I may think that I’ve made a terrible mess of things, if I ever get my memory back.  But I’ll figure things out.  I think I’m good at that.”
They apparated from the Glasgow Portkey Terminal to Hogsmeade, and Harry had accumulated a splitting headache to accompany his roiling stomach.  Minerva discretely passed him a potion, and he swallowed it gratefully.  “Cheers, Min.  You’re a lifesaver, truly.”  It was the dinner hour, and Harry was grateful that people, for the most part, were occupied indoors with their meals, and not watching Harry Potter’s triumphant return to Scotland.
“Blimey, Harry, you scared me!”  Tamsin Applebee had a friendly, heart-shaped face, and her curly hair was coiled into a bun, held by her wand.
Harry, confused, frowned.  “Like what?”
“Of course.  Give me twenty minutes and I’ll meet you back in the stands."
“Mister Malfoy, what plans do you have now?”
feelings.
Ron jumps in, “a git.  A horrible, spoiled, racist, selfish git.”
“Normally, you’d be so fixated on understanding the hidden plot that you’d lose sight of the bigger picture,” Ron supplies.
Harry smiled.  “And then there’s Malcolm.  He’s littler than Scorpius, and he’s had a really tough time lately.  He likely won’t say a word to anyone the whole time we’re here, but I’d really appreciate it if he could be included.  So you see?  Helping each other.  That’s all.”
“Up, Gryffindor,” Pansy ordered.  “Stop feeling sorry for yourself.  You’re a nightmare, and you react with your heart far more often than your head.”
Draco - Hermione’s been experimenting with potions that assist people in medically-induced rest.  This draught will give your mum comforting dreams.  Just massage some into her temples. Get some sleep and make sure the house elves feed you.
“Here, of course,” The Unspeakable waves his wand, and the bubble dissipates, revealing a tiny, blonde baby.  His eyes are closed, and he’s very still, but I’m relieved to see his chest rising and falling with his breaths.  Draco makes a strangled sound and tenses.  Pansy holds his arm tightly.
“You didn’t need to bring anything,” she chides.
“Honestly, Draco, I’m so thrilled for you.  Well done.”
“Yeah.”
“Well, needs must.  Strange, how things work out, isn’t it?”
“You ran across the ice and tackled him.  You got banned from the arena for life.”
Draco smiled.  “Well, yes, among other reasons." His eyes on Harry were warm, which was confusing.  "I’ve always regretted the way our relationship ended, Harry, and I’d hoped that we could use this as a chance to get back on friendlier terms.”
“Something like that.  But I wonder what would happen to your reputation if everyone knew about how far you actually would go to make sure that you keep everyone in their pre-appointed little box?”  He laughs, but it’s emotionless and hollow.  “Honestly, girl?  You think you can cling to your high horse after what you’ve done?  Does your precious Saviour have any idea what you’ve done to him?  You can’t justify your own actions any more than I can.”
“I dunno,” he replied with a huff.  “I sometimes think that she kind of
“Stop stereotyping.  Why don’t we go to the Leaky Cauldron? I owe Hannah an apology, and I’ll buy you dinner.”
“I thought so.”
“Luns, that’s a secret.  The hat hates people telling tales of its mis-sorts,” Harry chided.
“Of course.”
“Who are these children?”
Draco’s childhood bedroom had changed little since he was Harry’s age.  Once he’d started Hogwarts, he’d had no interest in spending time improving a space he spent little time in, and during the war, well, decorating was the furthest thing from his mind.
“Maybe.  You’ll have to ask your Papa.  I know you’ll have a good time, whatever he has planned.”
“Wow.  You really have changed.”
“Can’t his mum?”
I turn and leave the courtroom. Draco and I both had been summoned to testify in the proceedings, but they have our memories, and our statements, and they’ll simply have to make do without me.  I am finished with dancing to their purposes.
“You good, Draco?”  Harry smiled widely.
know of.  Still though, you suspect more than you’re telling me.”
Unexpected tears prickled the back of Draco’s throat.  He wanted to reassure Harry, to thank him for his kindness, but he could only blink hard, wordless.  Harry watched him closely, then reached out his hand.  “Draco?  Could we have some cocoa?”  Draco nodded, and Harry gave him an encouraging look, then took a few steps toward the stairs.  He turned back, to make sure that Draco was following him, and when he confirmed that he was, Harry’s smile was like a sunrise.
Things take a bit of a turn on the morning after Draco finishes the amulet.  He opens the shop late, having grabbed a scant three hours sleep after finishing the work.  A woman comes in, ranting about shoddy workmanship, brandishing a ring that she says has defective attraction charms.  “That might be, madam,” Draco replies, “but since our shop absolutely would not charm anything with an attraction charm, I’d suggest you take this product to the store that you purchased it from.”
Overall, Draco reflected to himself, they’d had more successes than failures.  Draco hadn’t been able to convince himself to give Harry a bath…the voices in his head had clamoured insistently at the notion, but Kreacher had been happy to do so the following morning, and Harry had, the elf reported, ‘enjoyed the bubbles’.
“Harry?  Why do you have an enormous python in the same room as my daughter?”  Hermione wants to know.  The snake is looking at her with interest.
“I’m here, sweetheart,” Draco said.  “It’s okay.  You’re okay.”  Scorpius raised his arms imploringly, his eyes still a little unfocused.  “Can I hold him?”
“Good different?”
“Kingsley,” I say, with a hint of humour in my voice, “you know that the Prophet isn’t worth the paper it’s printed on.”
“Go fuck yourself,” Draco growls.
“Do you think the hat would still put us in our same houses?” Pansy wondered.
“Oh.  Well, good for him, I suppose.”
When Harry awakes the next morning, Draco is sitting on the edge of Harry’s bed, holding his socks, looking lost.  His eyes rise to meet Harry’s.
I nod, pour the vial into the pensieve, and we plunge our faces within.  We’re instantly at a sunny lakeside, close to a tree, underneath which sit three small figures in black robes.  “Hogwarts?” I murmur to Draco.
“Oh, Harry, I’m sorry.  Of course you’d think that.  That was unbearably foolish of me.  They’re fine, all of them.”
“There is.  But we can also just be two old friends, having a drink, celebrating their healthy children.”
“How can we teach my dragon to be good?” Scorpius asked worriedly.
Harry laughed again.  “Yeah, no, I get it.  It was a weird night.  I never blamed you.  Not for that.”
“Who’s Hagrid?”
“And yet, nobody shouts at you and tells you that you’re wasting your life,” Harry says, and even he hears how bratty his tone is.
He grins at me, and passes me a little card that has the name, Bryan, and floo coordinates on it. “I don’t get off until one, but if you need help unwinding, floo me.”
“Oh no!  We are friends, actually.  My name’s Hannah.  Hannah Longbottom.  My husband Neville was your dorm mate at Hogwarts.”
“Yes, well so did I, until he looked as though I’d hit him when he saw the box.  He’ll never believe that I didn’t do it to hurt him.”
“You’ve measured his magical core?  Before just now, I mean?” Draco asked.
“Yeah, but everyone was doing their best.  War’s funny that way.  Sometimes, people convince themselves that the crappy decisions they make along the way are worth it in the end.  So, the war ended, school ended, and Draco and I went our separate ways.  And maybe we never would have seen one another again, if not for wands.”
“Yup, cool,” I say, popping the ice cube into my mouth.
Finally dressed, he sat on his bed, willing himself to be brave.  A knock on his door interrupted his efforts.  “Come in,” he said.
“Haven’t cracked up fully then?”
"When I woke up in the shack, she wasn’t angry anymore.  Gin…she’s the youngest of the family, and the only girl.  She’s well used to being able to talk people around.  If they don’t listen to her persuasion, she has a temper that usually gets everyone to comply.  She talked for a long time, about how our relationship was good, and how I’d grown to love her once, and I would again.  She talked about how I had finally gotten the family that I wanted, in the Weasleys, and all I had to do was say that I’d stay with her, and this could all be forgotten.”
“Overwhelming praise, coming from you, Sev.”
“Merlin,” Draco wheezes, and he seems to shrink a little, his shoulders hunching.  He’s breathing fast, and when his eyes meet mine, they’re filled with panic.  Without warning, he whirls around to face Pansy, and shouts, “We were so careful!  How did they find out?”
“That’s fine.  I think we both can admit that some of those old traditions aren’t as important as I used to think they were.  I was hoping that I could speak to you about what happens now, though.”
“It’s real real bad to insult a Hippogriff.”
“You remembered!”
“Hermione seems very fixated on restoring your memories,” Luna says.  I’d suspected that she’d come to discuss this with me, but I don’t especially mind.  I’m curious about what she’ll say, if I’m being honest.  It will either be shockingly insightful, or completely mad, and I’d be glad of either.
“I’m concerned about Scorpius,” he said bluntly, after describing the way that Scorpius hexed a classmate.  “Accidental magic isn’t uncommon, but it’s usually productive.  A child is told no more sweets, so he summons the cookies.  A child feels scared so he casts a notice-me-not on himself, in order to hide.  When a child’s magic lashes out to hurt someone else, it’s worrisome.”
Sending a half-apologetic shrug to Ron, who would likely receive the worst of Hermione’s rant about Crystals and divination, Harry threw on his jacket and made a hasty escape.  The apparation coordinates that he’d been provided landed him in an alleyway full of garbage cans.  He wrinkled his nose at the smell of rotting food, and took out his notebook.  It was a brilliant little thing, spelled to automatically update when his Department got a new case.
“Yes Miss Cici,” Scorpius chirped, grabbing Cass’ hand.
Harry smiled warmly, but said, “Thank you for asking me.  I really appreciate the offer, but I don’t socialize, really.”
“Well,” Harry said.
“Also?”  Harry’s smile was diabolical.  “Hockey Draco is fucking hot.”
After Ron leaves, Harry walks through the forest.  He walks for a long time, Ron’s words and Draco’s kiss filling his mind.  He isn’t surprised to find himself in the gods-damned clearing.  His dreams have been taking him to this spot for ages now.
“He was being a twat,” Harry said, a proud little smile on his face.  “The Wizengamot wanted me to be this Figurehead, a symbol of all that was right in the magical world, and I just…couldn’t.”
Harry still couldn’t speak, the tension of being unable to suppress his laughter, and Draco’s irritated, tired expression as he rolled Harry over to face him making everything worse.  He laughed and laughed, and Draco’s annoyance quickly turned into…hurt.  “Fine.  Whatever,” he said, and rolled so that his back was now facing Harry.
Ron did, and when they were sitting on the high stools at the counter of the lab with their cups, Ron said, “So the first idea is the one that won’t get me into any trouble, but it’s less likely to succeed.  If I can find any trace of the potions she’s been dosing Harry with, or if I can find someone who was selling them to her…”
Draco, on the other hand, looks dreadful, as though the cost of getting his son back requires him to sacrifice an arm, or the ability to speak.  There’s a fire in his eyes, though, and I know in my bones that there’s no price too great.
“Yeah,” she whispers.  “Yeah, I do.”  She looks down at her tiny little hands, and bursts into tears, which are, thankfully, short-lived.  I pull her close and hold her until she stops.  “Fuck,” she says, half-laughing, and sniffs a bit wetly.  She’s one of those girls that looks pretty when she cries.  “Did we just break up?”
“And what do you think the worst thing is?”
Harry grinned.  “It drives him mad when you call him that.”
“I am,” Draco said clearly.  His face was impassive, confident. Something changed in Cass’ face when Draco publicly claimed her, and Harry realized that he didn’t know what she was thinking.  Greg was standing directly behind her chair, one hand on her shoulder.  Cass was watching Draco, and Harry thought he saw a little of her tension leave her.
And then, like a dam breaking open, Harry had wept.  He cried and cried, for his young, hopeful mother, promising her baby that there’d be brighter days ahead.  For his broken godfather, who had never truly been freed from Azkaban.  For Remus and Tonks, who would miss out on watching their son grow up.  For Fred, for sweet little Colin Creevey, for Lavender Brown and finally, for himself.
“You’re not fine.  What do you need?”
“He might not want me,” she said.
“Do you care at all?”  Draco hadn’t been worrying about his own inflection at all.  Although he was resolutely staring ahead, Harry didn’t have to look at Draco to know that he was sneering.
Draco felt his lips curving into a hopeful smile.  “You’re not here to just shag me and then leave, are you?”
“I’m sure that you think you did,” Draco says patiently, “but we have a very strict policy about attraction charms, and so we just wouldn’t have sold it to you.”
