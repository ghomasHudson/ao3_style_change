Poppy was counting the bedlinen when she heard a distinct knock on the door. The sheets were plain and sensible, but of the finest Irish quality, more than a century old and there ought to be six dozen of them. Blasted kids, now she'd have to start all over again. "It's open," she chirped.
They were interrupted by Seamus. "Hey, cut it out," he chuckled. "There're unborn children present in this room."
"Mother," Draco started after a while of small chitchat, and once again took his mother's hand. "Potter... Harry and I have something to tell you." He swallowed and turned to Harry, as if he needed support for what he was about to say.
Harry held the last one up for Malfoy to see with his eyebrows raised in question. "Ah, that one's mostly for me, perhaps," Malfoy grinned.
"It will be impossible for you to work in the field while you're pregnant, of course." Healer Smith furrowed his brow in what he apparently thought was a sympathetic look.
Harry took out the parchment from his robes-pocket with fingers that trembled and read the names listed there, as he had done every year, in alphabetic order:
"How, in the name of Salazar, am I going to get passed him? I'm not so lucky to have such a wonderful cloak as you. I can be stuck here forever, if he's in that mood," he whined.
He sat down at the bed and pulled Harry down beside him and laced their fingers together. "She's… After the trials, after Father was taken away to Azkaban again, she broke. You see, she loved him very much, after all that he'd done, the bastard. She still does, and everything she had built her life on collapsed. Some days she rushes around the house, in search of something, some days she doesn't leave her bed. I took the wand away from her when I started to fear she might hurt herself. Her sister Andromeda visits sometimes, and then she talks like they're still young girls, like none of the things connected to the war and Voldemort has ever happend."
"Oh, come inside, will you. I asked Molly to look after the kids for a few days. I felt I needed some time alone." Harry led the way into the kitchen, where they usually sat when they talked. Harry's eyes flickered around the counters and the cabinets, too shy to meet Draco face to face.
He took out a list of names from his other pocket. "There were others that died that day. People we don't acknowledge on this day. They were not heroes. But can we truly say we have moved on, put the war behind us, if we can't acknowledge these casualties too. They too were men and women who are missed by friends and relatives."
Narcissa Malfoy looked wide-eyed at her son and at Harry and then back again. "But they won't die out, Draco. That's the only thing that matters." She turned back at Harry again and looked at her hand still placed on his stomach. "You're having my grandson?"
"This is one of my favourite places in London," he said as they climbed to the entrace hall. Harry had waited right at the gates, unsure if they were going inside the large building at all, but Malfoy immediately started to ascend the stairs with long strides.
"No, no, of course not. My flat is only a couple of blocks away from here, we could walk." He gave Harry a furtive glance. "If you want to?"
Ron sighed. "I just can't believe you're going through with this, Harry. Are you sure you want to, with Malfoy?"
Harry pulled his hands through his hair, making it even more tangled. "Look, what I'm about to ask... it's a bit awkward. No, I'll rephrase that." He straightened up and looked Malfoy directly in the eyes. "It's beyond awkward. It's downright embarrassing. So, could you, please, relax a little, give me a break and have a sodding cup of coffee." The tone in his voice went firm, but it seemed to have effect.
"Her univeristy course starts the same week as our Auror training, but since we'll try to get her parents to move home again, we'll probably be back a couple of weeks before that. What about you two?"
Healer Smith looked up from his desk and met Harry's eyes. "Actually, I have never in all my years as a Healer met anyone with a magical core a strong as yours, Mr Potter, so hopefully you are about to be a father in only a couple of weeks." He smiled and bared a crooked line of yellowy teeth. Harry shifted uncomfortable on the treatment couch and forced a smile back.
"If you haven't noticed, there aren't any gay bars on Diagon Alley, and being who I am, I doubt that it would have been a great success for me anyway. But I've been with a couple of wizards, while I was still at Hogwarts."
to conceal his feelings? Draco kept his eyes on the cauldron and continued stirring the potion alternately clockwise and anti-clockwise.
Harry rose from his chair and stood right in front of him. He grabbed his hands and pushed them down and manoeuvred himself up in Malfoy's lap, straddling him. Harry took his pointy chin in his hands and turned his face up. He let his thumb strike the sharp jawline, scratching the light stubble. They locked eyes. Pools of shimmering silver met his, and Harry felt he could drown, right there, in them. Slowly he moved forward, brushing his lips ever so lightly at Malfoy's.
"To the Manor?" Harry didn't know how he could deal with that, not even after all this time. The thought alone made his palate dry and his hands clammy.
The silence stretched out in what felt like eons, but he kept his hand in mine and his gaze was steady.
Harry sat in the bay-window of the dark parlour on the first floor, watching the Muggles hurrying along under umbrellas on the wet pavements and regretted his decition to leave. He almost regretted sending the owl.
"Nice offer, Potter, but I'm way too tired," he smiled. "I can't do anything right now. Some other time."
He started to walk towards the backdoor of the Leaky Cauldron, but turned when he sensed that Malfoy wasn't following. "It'll be fun, Malfoy. For old times sake and for the hell of it."
Harry blushed  and tried to hide it behind the rim of his cup. "I wouldn't know what to do with a man," he mumbled.
Harry complied and rolled over. He immediately felt Malfoy's hands over his back and shoulder blades, long soothing strokes that went lower and lower, and eventually began kneading Harry's buttocks.
Just his bloody luck, wasn't it. His own fault, naturally, but it felt better to blame some unknown deity or fate or whatever.
Harry wiped his eyes. "You're such a cry-baby, Harry." Ron came up behind him and put his hand heavy on Harry's shoulder. "They're only off to Hogwarts, not to the moon. Think of the bright side, you can spend more time with the new little Malfoy, now that the worst brats since the Marauders era are out of the way. Al is such a quiet kid, and Lily's an angel compared to my own."
As soon as the owl dropped it, he recognized the stationery envelope with the Malfoy crest. Before he had a chance to open it, Slughorn's hand fell heavily on his shoulder. "Will you please come with me, Mr Malfoy. The Headmistress wishes to see you in her office right away."
They danced, and as Malfoy's silver eyes bore into his, Harry could feel something erupt inside of him, liberating him, setting him free.
They were in the Slytherin common room this time and music poured out of Millie's radio, that was placed on a shelf in the bookcase nearby. The Lee Jordan show was on the WWN and he played something of the Muggle band Oasis, which Harry found he rather liked, and he hummed along to the tune. He wasn't very musical, but his singing appeared to calm the baby, even if it was a bit off key, and this baby needed all the calming Harry could muster.
"For being a complete failure, for acting without truly believing, for taking the Mark for all the wrong reasons."
Draco thought about the sparring, the challenges, the heat that had always been between them, escalating through the years, culminating in war. Could he be without that? Did he want to? To hell with it all.
Harry stood. "Yes, I have my desk cleared out this afternoon. And then I have a huge amount of private repair-damage to do."
"Absolutely wonderful, Mother." He kissed her cheek. "Mrs Weasley," he turned to Molly, "I'm overwhelmed by your generous hospitality, thank you so much."
He rubbed his thumb over the outline of Harry's prick through the coarse fabric of his jeans and it immediately twitched by the attention. "Ah, that's much better."
"I'm sorry if I spoiled the evening for you." Potter swallowed hard. "I guess I got a bit... possessive."
Malfoy was silent. Harry put a large pot of water on the cooking top and added a spoon of salt before he put the lid on.
Draco lowered the book he was reading and looked at Harry with raised eyebrows. "What are you on about?"
"Tell me again," Harry said after a while, "why you have to marry a girl you don't like? What's the rush? In a few year's time you might find a nice pureblood witch you fall in love with and want to have a dozen pasty pale Malfoy-babies with."
"How do you feel today, Potter? You look like a ghost." Malfoy gave Harry's sullen eyes a scrutinizing look.
He'd had fantasies, but that was all. Very vague and very indistinct fantasies that he'd never dared examine closley in the light of day. He had a girlfriend, even if they weren't intimate anymore, not since this summer. After a long and horrible year of war and losses, Harry only wanted to be like any other normal teenage-boy, but the awkward fumblings with Ginny out in the field behind the Burrow, had made Harry feel anything but.
"Don't worry about it," Malfoy smiled. "You look good. And I bet you're exactly the same as you've always been." He placed the salad bowl on the table and took out two bottles of Perrier from the fridge and held them up to Harry with a questioning look. "Mineral water? Or do you prefer Butterbeer with your food?"
His mother was also there, sitting in the brown leather chair and between them, on his father's desk, was the
"Easy for you to say," Harry snapped and tensed up even more. "You're the one who's getting to have all the fun."
I turned my head and saw him standing in the corner of the room with his Slytherin friends, all wearing
"Was this… could this be because of me?" Malfoy sounded both shaken and weary. "There's been a history of miscarriages in my family. I am an only child, but it was not my mother's first pregnancy."
"Are you leaving already?" Potter's voice was right behind him and he put a hand on his forearm. Draco spun around.
It started to stir around him and Harry saw the others putting away their books and quills. The lesson must be over. He exhaled, closed his book and rolled up his mostly empty parchment, and threw it all haphazardly in his bag and looked up.
Blaise felt a cold lump in the pit of his stomach. Draco spun around and faced Potter, his eyes narrowing into slits of hard steel. "Why do you think I care what you do and don't do? How can it possibly have something to do with me?"
"So, what now? More shots?" Harry asked after a while, trying to lighten the moment. He looked around the now more crowded place. His head buzzed pleasantly of the alcohol and he felt relaxed and anxious at the same time. Malfoy took out his new pale wand and discreetly removed the silencing spell. They were immediately hit by the pounding music. Harry squinted at the throbbing lights that flickered in red, green and yellow, illuminating the throng of the hopping  writhing mass on the dancefloor.
It was after the game, right outside the Quidditch pitch, where he lost his temper and shoved him fiercly up against the side of the shed. They weren't even supposed to be playing Quidditch anymore, being eight-teen and considered adults, but Harry couldn't imagine going to Hogwarts without being able to play, so he had begged the Headmistress, and in the end she reluctantly agreed, that all 8th-years could play, if they wanted, but no one asked to, except Harry and Malfoy.
They watched the children play at the far side of the garden, now that the tables were cleared and stored away into the magically enlarged shed. Harry grabbed two more beers from the cooling box and handed one to Ron as they sat down. The late afternoon sun cast long shadows over the stone-paths and the deep green lawn.
"This must be a very stressing situation for both of them, considering their history. I hope Harry knows what he's doing."
Harry's inhibitions seemed to have vanished, for he scooted over, a little unsteadily, and placed himself on the stool beside him. "So, what are you up to these days?" he muttered.
Cho tilted her head. "Taking him to an event like this makes it pretty official. You know how the Wizarding World works."
as it is, and I hoped, foolishly as it was, that you've actually had grown up, and since we both have saved each other's lives on more than one occation, that you would consider to help me with this, at least talk about it properly, but boy, was I wrong. You still are, and will always be, a perfect
Potter withdrew his hands and crossed his arms painfully tight over his chest, his hands fisted in his armpits. Potter had scars too, but Draco doubted they related to shame in the way his did. On Potter's pectoral, a little to the right over his left nipple, was an oval-shaped reddish mark where no dark chest-hairs grew, and there was, of course, the famous one on his forehead.
Malfoy bit his lip. "Fair enough. If you must know, there was a lot of heated words and I left quite suddenly." He exhaled and seemed to brace himself. "It turned out my father has completed the negotiations regarding my marriage to the Greengrass girl."
"Narcissa Malfoy née Black, wife of Lucius Malfoy, presumed to sympathise with the Dark Lord Voldemort, but through testimony of Harry James Potter, also found aiding Mr Potter in the final hours of the battle. I ask the jury to raise their hands if they belive she deserves imprisonment in Azkaban."
"Look, Malfoy," Harry said, suddenly angry. "If you think this is some hilarious joke, go ahead, laugh. My life is
He looked down on his hands and stains of pink flushed his cheekbones. "I thought mine would come out all blank since I haven't… ever…"
He was over me the next second, fumbling around after my semi-visible body, punching, scratching and tugging at my cloak and robes. Somehow he managed to straddle me, with me on my back, and I felt his hands on my bare skin where my clothes had rode up. They burned with a heat that overwhelmed me, and since I could hide in the fact that I was partly invisible, I yanked his shirt up and let my hands slide over that soft warm skin of his. He shivered and his grip on my waist got tighter. I moaned. And involuntarily, my hips shot up and grinded against his groin. He panted and pushed back. I freed my face from the cloak, and we rotted against each other until we both came with moans and whimpers. Then he quickly got up and headed down to his dorm entrance and I remained laying on the cold stone floor, trying to sort out what had happend. And that was the beginning of our many secret meetings in empty hallways and storage rooms.
"If you need…" She fumbled a little with her wand on her desk. "If you feel the need to speak to anyone, please, let me know. I want to help, if I can."
It sounded honest and Draco wanted it to be true. He wanted the possibility of forgiveness, that all the things he'd done really was in the past, that he could move on to be the person he wanted to be, a wizard of his own integrity, a man of his own choices. He made a weak sound, part laugh, part sob. "Do you really mean that?"
Harry had felt restless and edgy all evening. He'd been sitting at the Auror's table, drinking broodily, snapping at everyone, until Ginny said she'd had enough and gone home without him, together with Ron and Hermione. But Harry had had his eyes on him ever since he entered the room.
Harry started to work very long shifts, sometimes weekends too. "Poor thing," Ginny mumbled sleepily into the pillow when he came home past midnight, "you must be exhausted. Can't you delegate?"
With Malfoy behind him, his arms around Harry's sturdy chest and the cloak meticulously draped around them, they slipped out of the door, careful not to make any suspicious sounds. They passed Filch muttering to himself in the corridor, silent as mice and managed to get down to the dungeons undetected. Outside  the entrance in the stone wall they cast off the cloak and stood for a while, looking at each other in silence. THen Harry lifted himself up on his toes and gave Malfoy a quick peck on the cheek before he flung the shimmering fabric over his head  and disappeared.
Harry was a bit drunk, but then, so was everyone else in the room. Somehow it had turned into a party for the entire Department. Someone had managed to put on some music and the room was too hot, too crowded and too loud, and slightly spinning.
They've met outside Harry's house for their third 'date' and Malfoy had demanded that Harry didn't appear in Auror-robes again.
Within two seconds Harry was standing right next to them, glaring daggers at Justin. He could see the light twist at the corner of Malfoy's mouth. "Potter, how lovely to see that you've decided to stop making a fool of yourself on the dancefloor." Harry spun around to face Malfoy, and he heard Justin giggle.
Blaise came up to him, pushed aside the books and scrolls, hopped up and sat on Draco's desk, dangling his feet so they bumped Draco's knee. Draco gritted his teeth and gave him a dark look.
Ginny scowled. "But you don't see, do you? This is the new Malfoy heir. Families like his value blood and genes and all the crap that comes with it. It wasn't just old Voldy who taught those believes, it's century-old Wizarding tradition."
cleaned his plate and made a cup of tea before he went up the stairs and silently opened the bedroom door.
"Well, they need guidance for one, and they only do household work like cleaning and cooking. The land and the rest of the estate is mine to run. Before the war, mother did most of that, as my father spent a lot of his time at the Ministry."
"Do you recall what happened?" Malfoy chuckled. "You sort of came out last night, Potter. Are you aware of that?"
"They're all too small." Harry could hear the light whine in his own voice. The pair he had on clung to his hips in a way he wasn't used to. He opened the curtain and took a few uncertain steps out with his chest bare and his feet naked.
He extended a hand for support as Draco clambered up to his full hight. Draco withdrew from him with a scowl and sputtered, "Nothing I can't handle."
Finally, Harry packed a few things, with the little boys standing in the doorframe holding hands, Albus sucking his thumb, eyes round and scared. Harry lifted Lily from the cot, kissed her and tickled her. She squeaked and drooled, too little to understand the gravity of the situation. Then he gathered his sons close to his chest. "Daddy has to go away for a little while," he said, and his voice quivered with supressed emotion. "You both be good boys and take care of each other and your little sister. I'll see you in a few days, all right?" He placed kisses on the top of their heads, first Jamie then Al, and stood. With tears burning behind his eyes he quickly turned around and went for the hearth in the living room. He threw a handful of the glittering powder into the fire and called for Ron and Hermione.
Harry placed the piece of parchment on the kitchen table and looked out of the window. London was living its booming life underneath him, constantly changing, but this far up no human sounds reached, only the rattle of cars and trains and the screeching of sirens.
The music had turned up a notch or three, and it was getting more crowded along the bar. Harry looked around and met the eyes of more than one man.
"I've always had you figured for a poof." Blaise threw himself down in the chair beside him at the common room table later the same evening. "You can be very obvious sometimes, my dear friend, with the excess use of hands and swaying hips, especially when you're sloshed and lose some of that Malfoy poise. Potter was a bit more unexpected, though."
"Yeah, I'm sure," Harry beamed. "And now that you're here, stay for dinner. You've still to meet my second son, Albus, who's hopfully not as hostile as his older brother. I'm making Spagetti Carbonara and it will be frightfully messy, I'm afraid, but I very much like you to stay. And another thing," Harry looked slightly embarrassed, "can I call you Draco? It's a bit awkward introducing you as my old friend and still call you by your surname."
Harry pulled the jumper over his head and opened his jeans. He wondered if Malfoy was naked under that dressing gown. He wasn't wearing any shoes, but neither was Harry. He got out of his jeans but left the pants on.
"Oh, but you're such a handsome whale. And what do you know? Maybe I've developed a fondness for whales, a whale-kink, even."
A loud murmur erupted in the dungeon-like hall and Harry dared to lift hid head for the first time and look at the accused. Malfoy's grey eyes searched Harry's the same instant, and in a blink of a second, Harry zooned out and was back at that night of fear and fire. He could feel Malfoy's thin body flattened against his back as they flew out of the Room of Hidden Things, flames of the Fiendfyre licking their boots. His arms that clung to Harry's abdomen trembled and Harry could feel the whiffs of his heavy panting against his sweat-covered neck. Right then, in the briefest of moments, so brief in fact that Harry later questioned if it had happened at all, Malfoy pressed his face at the side of Harry's throat and inhaled. It was over in an instant, and when they took ground in the hall outside, Harry strained himself not to look at him and not to think about it. But he did.
Malfoy took a few steps inside and his gaze wandered over the dark mouldy wallpaper, the serpent-shaped sconces and the high ceiling. "Black-house," he uttered, almost dreamily under his breath, "haven't been here for some time."
Ginny buttered a bread-roll. "Well, we have to make up a fool-proof plan, of course." She grinned at him before she put it in her mouth. "You're gonna need all the help you can get. Count me in."
I never think, that's my main flaw, I suppose. I should've, at more than one time in my life, and certainly now. Instead, I dashed after him.
He knew it'd been immature of him to rush out like that, but he'd felt so stupid. And the feeling of disappointment didn't make it any less humiliating.
"Can't belive I'm saying this, Harry," Ron said. "I mean, he's still Malfoy, but if that smart-mouthed ferret-y thing is what you want, then go get him."
"Adam." Malfoy greeted the young man with a kiss. "Good to see you. It's been a while. This is a friend of mine…"
"I was thinking of starting with a pair of black jeans," Harry heard Malfoy say on the other side. Harry groaned and toed off his trainers.
"Why do you want to know?" Malfoy asked. His eyes met Harry's, alarmingly sober and with a glint of amusment.
After an hour or so, more and more clothes were added to the growing pile on the desk, and Malfoy and Adam were looking at some belts. Harry roamed idly along the racks when his eyes caught on a black leather jacket. The texture was smooth and soft, the colour like charcoal and it smelled wonderful of, well, real leather. Harry took it off its hanger and it felt nice and heavy in his hand. In one hasty move he put it on.
Ron put his hand on Harry's arm. "Be careful, mate. You know the Prophet would do anything to get a story like that. Pay anything. Don't put yourself in a situation you can't handle. It can be tempting for any witch, even if you think you can trust her. You're Harry Potter, that'll always be headline news in our world, no matter what. You owe Ginny the truth before the shit hits the fan."
Harry rubbed the back of his neck feeling uncomprehensibly guilty. "Oh no, it's just a friend who's been helping me out with the house, the old curses and such." He placed two cups of steaming hot coffee in front of them.
He looked at me again. "With you? Why would I want that?" His nose wrinkled a little at the base from the sneer.
Harry felt the warmth from him and linked their fingers together on the table top. "Come to me Monday night, then," Harry said, his voice a little hoarse and low. "You know where I live. I can't offer any home-cooked Haught-cuisine, but I can rattle up something, an I have two very comfortable armchairs in front of the fireplace, that are perfect for late night confessions." Harry stood up. "See you then...Draco. Have a nice weekend with your kid."
He sat up and with trembling hands he put his glasses back on. There was a very easy way to test this, his magic. He held out his hand to summon his wand. If his magic failed now, that meant...
"Shit, my mother." Draco raked his fingers through his hair, getting it more tangled than Harry had ever seen, even in bed. "How on earth did you manage that?"
"Not right now." Malfoy leaned over the table and shouted. "We're in this club, aren't we? I want to dance."
Malfoy lowered his chin and bore his silvery eyes into Harry's. "Oh, I'm far from drunk yet. And you still have one more question to answer. I will never admit that card thing counted."
Hermione tilted her head and examend the redhead man. "Since Harry obviously feels it's all right to give him a chance, don't you think we ought to as well?"
Harry nodded. "We decided to find out after all. It's a boy." He smiled up at Draco and felt Draco's fingers reach after his hand on top of Harry's huge belly.
"It seems to me you have a very fine boy, Malfoy," Harry said and put down the frame with a grinning Scorpius, probably taken only months before Harry had seen him boarding the train.
Strong arms lifted him and in his painfilled haze he could feel the pull of Apparation. Then in a brightly lit white room he heard Malfoy bellow, "HEALER!" before everything went black.
Draco turned a corner so he could get a better angle and as Potter bent down to look at a low shelf, Draco saw what was different. He felt his face flush red with desire. Potter had gained weight. Why that revelation made Draco's toes curl and his heart flutter, he had no idea, but it did. Maybe because it made him human, vulnerable, with flaws, just like everybody else, just like Draco. Not perfect and unattainable. Somehow it made all the difference in the world.
"Thank you, Janice," Malfoy said. "And it's very late now, I'm afraid, you should go home. We only need to wrap this up while we eat. We'll be alright."
"Exposing people's hidden desires, removing emotional barriers, what's the fun in that?" Hermione furrowed her brow and pushed a large glass of pumpkin juice to the side.
But there was something else, something solid and moving. Someone panting and grunting. Someone so close, that Harry was totally engulfed in limbs.
"You can't believe all the strange rumours that's buzzing around about you," Ginny chuckled. "One says you were under an Imperius Curse and thought you were a dog, one that there was a bet and you were challenged to break into Slytherin and hex Malfoy, and another that you've been running around Hogwarts stark naked."
Harry was tense, but he willed his muscles to relax and matched his breathing with Malfoy's, which was deep and even. "Excellent," Harry heard Malfoy say. "You're doing so well." His voice was a low purr in Harry's ear.
Malfoy was standing in the middle of a group, mostly Slytherins but others too, some Hufflepuffs and Ravenclaws. Something Malfoy said made them all laugh, and then Harry saw the expression in Justin Finch-Fletchley's face, as he gave Malfoy a dreamy glance.
"Honestly, I don't know," Harry sighed. "The thought of the insemination thing put me off, in a way, and when you so willingly assumed that we were… you know, to get it done, I just... I don't know… well, I was a bit..." Harry paused his rant and bit his lip.
"Yes, sir. We is all free elves at the Manor now. Pipsey even wears clothes." She made a little twirl and Harry saw now that she wore a sun-bleached dress, not a tea-towel as he first had thought.
Draco looked absolutely crestfallen. "The Healers haven't said anything to me. What's wrong with him? Tell me."
Harry played a little with his beer-bottle, picking at the gold and white label, loosening it at the corners. In Ron and Hermione's kitchen he had always felt at ease, safe. That must have been the reason he let his tongue loose, he guessed. He hadn't planned talking about this, it just slipped, being constantly on his mind. And Ron was his best friend, he'd known him longer than anyone else.
Kreacher turned to Malfoy, who had covered the lower part of his face with his hands, his shoulders shaking of repressed laughter. "Young Master Malfoy, such an honour," the elf said. "May I say, how generous and thoughtful of you, son of Narcissa, to help restore the bloodline of the Noble House of Black. To make sure there is an heir to carry the magical blood of the Black family. This is most pleasant, most pleasant indeed. Thank you, sir, thank you." He bowed so low this time his snout-like nose grazed the floor.
"That's where your party is being held. Which brings me to my second point. People care for you, Draco. More than you think. You have no idea of how many there are that has helped me plan this thing. Friends, Draco."
"I have, sort of, a confession to make, about why I'm here," Harry said as he put his cutlery down after spending the entire meal of small talk and jokes. Malfoy's face fell.
"She has good days too," Draco continued, "and on one of them I will tell her about your baby. Maybe that will help her get in touch with reality again, help her heal." He smiled at Harry. "Besides, this time of year the estate is at its worst. If you come, we want to make a good impression on you."
They had reached the fourth floor and was standing right outside the door to the Hospital wing. Draco lowered his head slowly and gave the red head Gryffindor a furtive look. They were the same hight as their eyes met.
"And you expect me to get an erection looking at your hairy arse?" Contempt flooded from his mouth as he glared.
"You know Muggle clothes?" It was a stupid question. It only took one look at Malfoy's perfectly clad body to see he knew how to dress.
"I didn't tell you at the time." Hermione gave her husband an affectionate smile. "I didn't want you to be too sure about me, I wanted you to work a little to get me. And later, I almost forgot about it. It was a childish schoolgirl thing, but it actually worked."
Malfoy lifted his head and his gaze surveyed the room. "They loved to dance together. We used to have big parties in here, before the war, before... everything." He swallowed hard and his Adam's apple bobbed on his long throat.
"You're one of the last, boy. Arthur, George and Bill are out in the shed, doing Merlin knows what, Hermione and Ron are in the sitting room with Fleur and all the children, trimming the tree. Charlie's still sleeping, he got here awfully late last night, and Percy and his wife are not coming this year." Her mouth twisted in pain. Things were getting better with Percy, but he still remained a distant figure in the family and Harry knew it hurt Molly more than she let on.
Draco had never been any good at deception. His father used to exel in how to never reveal his true feelings, and had worked hard at instructing Draco to never show anything but superiority and confidance, the traits of a true Malfoy. In the past, before everything went to shit, Draco had tried, even when he felt insecure and out of his league.
"I have never..." McGonagall started and glared at them. "In all my years as a teacher and now as Headmistress at this school, had students fighting like a pair of drunken Muggles in Public-house brawl. Explain yourselves."
Draco stopped in his tracks. They had come in view of the big old house with its pompous front porch. It stood mostly dark this late in the night, but a few lights flickered invitingly in the windows.
"The Prophet was making such a big fuss about it, I remember." Malfoy tilted his head and watched Harry. "How you and your childhood sweetheart were oh-so-cosy and very much in love. The perfect match between
Dark. Cold. Empty. A flickering blue light came through the window from a neon-sign across the street and the perpetually burning magical fire in the sitting room cast a yellowish light, but otherwise the flat was compleatly dark.
"What do you mean, you fainted?" Ron gave him a sceptical look. "You haven't fainted since 3rd year at Hogwarts."
He came unexpectedly, and Harry's mouth was filled with his spunk. As it threatened to suffocate him, he swallowed. Malfoy swayed and stumbled, but he gripped Harry's arms and pulled him up, and with one arm around his shoulders he gripped Harry's throbbing cock with the other. It didn't take more than a few strikes before Harry also blacked out and Malfoy's hand was covered with sperm.
"Seamus mentioned he saw him in New York a couple of years ago," Ginny said and pulled Lily closer to her as she stepped a little too near the edge of the platform. The train released a huge cloud of steam and they both startled and burst out laughing.
Maybe he should do what she wanted and join her at the Riviera, start a new life. He heaved a sigh and put his glass down at the coffee-table. He knew he couldn't, he could never leave. Never leave Harry. Keeping a close track on Harry Potter was what had kept him in England in the first place.
Harry shot a glance over at Draco, who sat at the side. He had avoided Harry all evening, but now Harry saw his chance, as Pansy stood and placed a kiss on his cheek before she walked over to Zabini. The whole point of this party was to get Draco to talk to him again, after all.
Harry shook his head again. "It was... good. It was afterwards, well... He's still Malfoy, you know."
"Now, if you please, I would like to be alone with my Aunt. It's a lovely day today, why don't you boys go outside in the back garden for a while. I'll let you know when I'm ready."
I tried to pretend the Note wasn't burning in my pocket the whole day. When I got home, I discarded my Auror uniform in a big pile on the bedroom floor and went straight to the shower. The warm water eased the tensed muscles and I started to relax. It was more hard work, lots of odd hours and more straining than I ever could imagine when I boyishly dreamed of this line of work. It didn't leave much space for a personal life. At least, that's what I told everyone, including myself.
"Here," Potter leaned down and rumbled around in his trunk, "take this." He held out a cloth of luminescent material.
and I realized what I really want is a family, children anyway, and dating someone… Let's just say that finding the right witch has been difficult. Nobody wants
Hermione snorted. "How could she not be, growing up with six brothers?" She turned to Harry. "Seriously, Harry, is Ron just taking a piss as usual, or what? Have you met someone? You know you can count on our support in anything. Falling in love with someone is fantastic, Harry, we're both happy for you if that's the case. The gender thing doesn't matter. Right, Ron?"
"I suppose so. I go home at night thinking I did my best, that we managed to put yet another Dark wizard behind bars and I feel content with that."
Harry's breath was starting to hitch up and he could feel his release coming closer, when Malfoy suddenly let go of his cock and started to caress his buttocks with more intensity. Harry moaned and looked down at him with a frown. "Don't stop, Malfoy. I'm close," he groaned.
Malfoy started to open the fastening hooks on his robe, tossed it off in one elegant shrug and put it on the upholstered chair next to a set of drawers. Undernearth he wore a plain white button-down shirt and black Muggle jeans. Malfoy removed his boots and lay down on the bed and turned to Harry. "Are you just going to stand there, Potter?" He patted the spot on the bed next to him.
The following Thursday I went. I nodded at André behind the bar, as he handed me my beer, but I couldn't make myself smile back at him. I was too nervous. It was only a couple of minutes before ten, but I saw Malfoy make his way through the small crowd, away from the stage towards me. He stopped at my table and pressed his knuckles at the top, very hard until they whitened. Without looking at me he said, with a strained low voice, "Please, Potter, stay tonight."
They were silent for a while, all three of them. Harry cleared his throat. He'd stopped shivering and started to relax a little. "I was... I..." he started, but clapped his mouth shut again.
Harry came up closer and took his wrists in a firm grip. "Oh, shut up, you." He pressed his hips against Malfoy's and buried his face in the crook of his neck. "I bought you a present." Harry's voice was muffled against Malfoy's shoulder.
Harry gulped at the sight of the marred torso. He was responsable for most of it and felt an urge to touch the scars and make up for the pain. He shook his head. "Would you believe that is exactly what I feel when I'm with you? You're never awestruck about the old Saviour-bullshit, that I sometimes see in people I meet. Not Ron or Hermione, of course, or Ginny, for that matter, but otherwise…" He took a sip of his tea and put the cup down. "I like you, Draco, I really do. Imagine that, after everything. I like spending time with you, I like having you here in my home. I can't deny that I have feelings for you, I just don't know what they are yet. Do you think I'm a horrible person if I say I need a little time? I got to figure out who I am in all this."
Draco swallowed. The grey dawn outside the windows made the rest of the room distinguishable. He put out the
Malfoy's hair seemed to be newly cut and it was unusually short at the neck. He rubbed his hand over the stubble from time to time, as if he weren't yet used to how it felt. In the front it was longer and he wore it softer than the strict hairstyle he used to have. Strands from the top fell over his face, obscuring his eyes, but Malfoy's quill kept scratching at a speed that only matched Hermione's, so Harry guessed it didn't bother him.
The smile that he had on his lips died away as soon as the small figure had disappeared. He was not at all confident that Draco would come with him. This might not work at all.
Malfoy pulled the cords up to the armpits; on Harry's chest they formed a net of crossed rope. Malfoy pulled Harry's arms to the back and began to tie. It pulled at Harry's shoulders, tight but not too uncomfortable. On his back he could feel Malfoy work the ropes, the steady pull of the cord, his hands slow and meticulous.
"Oh, I know, Harry Potter." She wrung her hands and her big ears sloped down in the saddest way. "Master Draco came home and didn't eat his dinner, not even the chocolate fudge Pipsey made. He's locked himself up in his rooms."
I gaped. I felt my chin drop and I sat there and gaped. I'm sure it wasn't one of my most intelligent looks, because Hermione started to laugh for real.
Harry went alone to the Leakey. Tom, the old barman, greeted him heartily, and Harry ordered a beer and a small Fire-whiskey. He nodded at the regular crowd but sat down at a table by himself. He had brought a book. Pathetic, really. He suddenly felt like an old man.
Draco shuddered his shoulders. "Wrong side of the war, remember. Evil scheming gay Death Eaters aren't as popular as you might think," he said snidely.
"Why? Because I don't think you would like it very much." He laughed bitterly at the understatment. "You were a prisoner there, Potter. Your friends were tortured there, by members of my family. You almost got killed there."
Ron walked Harry back to their cubicle and patted his back awkwardly before he grabbed his cloak and went out on his assignment, leaving Harry with the pile of paperwork that only kept growing on his desk. He'd had eight weeks of this now and he was fed up with it already.
Harry secretly enjoyed the sensation of an overfull stomach and felt that he had earned it. It made him feel grounded, and in the company of Ron Weasley you never had to be embarrassed about second helpings. It was a secret, though, and strongly connected with guilt and shame. At first, after the war, he merely filled out, finally becoming muscular and fit, instead of the scrawny under-developed boy he used to be, but over the years a softness around the middle started to appear. Now, in the break of turning thirty, Harry found that most of his once rather baggy clothes were all too snug, and that he had more than a little muffin-top over his waistband.
Malfoy snorted. "Well, that would, at least, give you the opportunity to improve." And Harry just knew.
"Don't kid youself, Potter," Draco spat and yanked his hand away. "You're the Golden Boy, and I'm snake-spawn."
"No," Blaise smiled dreamily. "Mandy Brocklehurst, the pretty blond one. She's intelligent and interesting and it's rather liberating to talk to people with a different view on things. See what the division of the Houses has brought us. Nothing good, I'll tell you that."
A sphere of light-blue hovered over Harry's midriff at the tip of the Healer's wand. "This is only a projection, but you can clearly see the baby here, the head and the spine. It's far too early to make out anything else." He grinned at Harry. "Amazing, isn't it?"
Ginny picked a hole at the hem of her sleeve, put her finger through it, tore it bigger. "Possibly because this is the first, in a very long time, that we're alone in a room together." The statement felt harsh when spoken out loud, but it was the truth. "I think I want more out of a relationship than Quidditch and chaste kisses." Rapidly she added, "Dean asked me the other day if you and I were still together. He wants to go to Hogsmeade with me."
At the Burrow everything had been covered in a thin layer of frost, that made every dry leave, every straw of grass sparkle, crisp and delicate. It created an atmosphere of calm, like all nature was holding its breath. Here in London it rained.
Malfoy whipped around. "No," he hissed. "I refuse to listen to any more of your lies, Potter. Why can't you just leave me alone?"
"Obviously, I haven't." The voice croaked, as if not being used for a long time, maybe even from crying.
"What do you want, Malfoy?" Harry growled, slammed the cup down on the formica table and shot daggers at the man opposite him. He really disliked being so easy to read by this man.
With a few long strides another figure was at Harry's side, and he grabbed him and shook him vigorously. "You stupid naive idiot of a man," Draco hissed. "How could you ever think they were ready for that?"
He rememberd Potter. Potter's eyes following him, glaring, and something... else. He remembered them arguing. Well, nothing new there. After that, nothing.
"Well, how convenient for you, Potter, that you have such a weak memory. Then you never have to face what a bloody coward you really are."
And by the way, the happy silly song they all dance to at Draco's birthdayparty is, in my mind, Dancing in the Moonlight by Toploader. Listen to it, it sure keeps me in a good mood.
"I used to be addicted to Dreamless Sleep, because of my nightmares after the war. It's only thanks to Hermione that I got out of it."
"Well, I see that you're still too full of yourself, Saint Potter, even after all these years. Good luck with the Dark spells, then." The swirl of black robes as he rounded the corner to another section would have made Severus Snape grit his teeth in envy. Harry huffed. Some things never seemed to change.
He came back with the glass and helped Harry lift his head to drink. Harry's heart was back to normal and his lungs had decided to co-operate again. "I feel fine, honestly. Except my head." He rubbed the sour spot at the back of his head.
Harry turned and looked at Malfoy while he patted the red hair of his baby girl, who squirmed and gurguled. "I dunno, really." His green eyes were moist and sad when they met Malfoy's. "It's a bit unexpected, but I guess I'm not as upset as I thought I would be. You know, she was supposed to be the one. We were supposed to be together forever."
"You can do a lot of things with magic. Easier and quicker, but what's the fun in that," Malfoy mused almost contemplative, while his delicate long fingers slowly worked downwards, button for button. "I've found that some things are worth taking its time." He freed Harry's shoulders from the fabric, folded the shirt and placed it on a low bench alongside Harry's jeans, socks and underpants.
Shitty Christmas indeed. Draco had spent his leave coiled up on his bed like a wounded animal, while his mother rummaged around the mansion, still throwing things out, moving furniture, removing, cleaning, never still.
"Well, it was a compete disaster and I never went there again," Harry said firmly. "I really don't want to talk about it."
Draco turned him around and cupped Harry's chin in his hands. "I want to be with you. I want us to be a family too. But that would make it bloody official, the press will have a field-day. Are you sure you're up to that? And then there's this Death Eater-thing. That's a fact that niether of us can forget."
"So, this is what I suggest," Malfoy continued. "I want to be seen with you in public, once a week ought to do it, at some restaurant or society function, pretending to date. I say Wednesdays for that and Fridays for fucking. That'll leave us both the weekends off for other activities."
He was sitting in one of the bashed down sofas, with his long legs flung out of him, drinking eggnog, wich was sweet, creamy and, thanks to Seamus Finnegan, spiked with quite a large amount of Brandy. Even his closest freinds had eventually given up on him and left him there, pouting. He could see them now on the dancefloor, caught up in some wild mating-ritual, which apparantly included Pansy shoving her tongue into Blaise's ear. He was cranky and bitter, and it was all Potter's fault, as usual.
"And why is that so important to you?" Harry asked, a little grumpily. These blasted kids of his, that never seemed to stop worrying about him. As Jamie was away long periods of time with his Quidditch-team, as a trainer now instead of playing, and since Lily had joined their Uncle Charlie at the Dragon-reserve in Romania, it looked like it was up to Albus to keep watch over their father. Harry also had a strong suspicion that he steadily owled them long reports of all of Harry's shortcomings.
"Tosser," Harry scoffed at Malfoy on their way back to the bar. Malfoy turned and gave him a shit-eating grin.
"Do you think you can trick me again?" Malfoy wheezed. He took a step closer to Harry. He was few inches taller and took the advantage to look down at Harry. Malfoy's eyes narrowed. "What is it this time? You've already covered the pretence of being cordial, of friendship, fake kisses and... other feelings. You used me, Potter."
"And he loves you too," Hermione squeezed Harry's hand. "Even Goyle said so." She sniggered a little, but became serious before long. "This was never only about shagging, was it?"
"Maybe you should call me Harry," Potter grinned. "It is my name after all, if we're about to be engaged." He pushed Draco's shoulder, forcing him to lay on his side so their eyes met. "Think about it, Draco, it would get you off the hook. Your father might not be overly pleased with a son-in-law that's not a pureblood, but I am from one of the oldest families. He doesn't like me, and I sure don't like him, but the Minister of Magic is a close friend of mine, and I guess all the Saviour-bullshit could count for something, even to him."
Harry had a vague recollection of a boy with mean eyes and a smirking face, but then, that's how he remembered most of his Slytherin opponents. "He was your first?"
"Hermione can be very persuasive." Draco nuzzled his face in the crook of Harry's neck. "She and that two-faced bint I call my best friend. When did they close ranks and start scheming with oneanother? I bet they're all laughing their faces off right now."
Harry watched Malfoy move easily between the work-bench and the stove. The kitchen contained a mix of wizarding things and Muggle, like various cauldrons hanging above the stove with the pots and pans, ingrediencies for potion-making together with the spices and herbs on a shelf. Malfoy's long bony hands worked swift as he meticulously chopped tomatoes for the salad, while the aubergines were being baked in the magically heated oven.
Harry pushed his glasses up and rubbed his eyes as the alcohol tingled on its way down. "Now I want you to tell me why you're here and what made you run away from your parents?" he said.
The water was divine. Harry could hear Malfoy place himself behind Harry's head. He dipped something in the water, a sponge, and started to rub circles on Harry's back. All over his back, up on his shoulders, over the arms. The tension Harry felt slowly subsided. Harry felt Malfoy mover around and the rubbing continued on the front, his pectorals, his abdomen, around his crotch and on the upper side of the thighs. Harry yelped and flinched when the sponge reached between his buttocks, but Malfoy hushed him and spread his legs apart.
"Do you ever wonder what happened to some people after the war?" Her tone was light and careless, but since I've known Hermione Granger for more than a decade now, I knew there was something behind the casual words.
Harry yanked James towards the door. "A new diaper, of course." He stopped. "I'm sorry, do you think you're up to it?" He ran his fingers through his hair, making it stand up even more. "I would be so grateful. We had a bit of a row here, the boys started fighting and everything happened at the same time. I'll owe you big time if you could do it."
Harry took a drink from his beer and looked at Malfoy. "You're really set out to get drunk, aren't you? What's the matter? Except for the obvious ordeal of being a first-class prat. Has anything happened?"
It was only a quick peck on the lips, but it was more than enough to make Draco's heart go galloping madly in his chest and his face flush red. He kept his eyes on Lily and her unicorn, trying to calm down before he met Harry's gaze again.
Harry reached out to grab his second shot, but Malfoy took hold of his wrist and stopped him. "That's not a very enlightening answer."
Three weeks later, a Saturday evening, when everyone was gathered in the common room, Seamus stood up and called on everyone's attention. He and his Charms-team members, Justin Finch-Fletchley and Blaise Zabini, had come up with this great idea and they wanted to test it before they presented it in the class next week.
"Yeah, you don't look too good, mate. Have a seat. Can I get you something? A glass of water, perhaps?"
Draco snorted a laugh. "Not Loony Lovegood, I hope?" Draco rather liked Luna. She was one of the few who talked to him in classes, and they were related in some intricate way as most pureblood families were. Strangely enough, Luna didn't seem to hold it against him that she'd been a prisoner in Draco's home. He had done what he could for her at the time, without Aunt Bella finding out. He'd brought her and the wandmaker food and water, healed cuts and bruises, but still.
"So, it's the Malfoy brat, but isn't that entirely up to Harry? He used to be a pain in the arse, but he's apologised to us all after the trials and he served his punishment. And, Ginny," Charlie went on, addressing his sister, "you act as if you're the scorned girlfriend, but in fact, you and Harry broke up years ago. He's moved on. It's time you did too." He walked up to Harry and put a finger under Harry's shirt-collar and peered inside. "Wow! You've found yourself a wild one, haven't you? Congratulations, mate. Make sure to tame this dragon of yours with just the right amount of spark still in him. That's how we like them, eh?" He winked at Harry.
"Some days, though, I wish I hadn't put up that much of a fight," Malfoy continued with a sigh. "The Manor is rather big, you know, and it can be quite lonley, especially after Mother moved to France right after her house-arrest was over. She still begs me to come and live with her, but I want to stay in England. It's my home. I don't want to run away like a guilty coward." He laughed a humourless laugh. "Which is exactly what I am."
She laughed a little short laugh that sounded more like a sob. "Honestly, Harry, when was the last time we did something together, just you and me? Going with you to look at those houses was a chance for me to spend some time with you, and to daydream a bit. We never do anything; we never go out."
"I think our magnets have flipped," Malfoy said. "I could see it in the way you looked at me at the platform. We both know the antagonism between us wasn't real." He gave  little wry smile. "Well, not after fourth year anyway. That's why you saved me from the Fire, that's why I didn't turn you over to the Dark Lord. That's why we're here."
"And you're here with… Malfoy?" Cho asked tentatively as she followed his gaze. "I must admit it gave me a bit of a shock when I saw the pictures in the paper the other day," she smiled. "It was quite a surprise."
The name of a Club, Rainbow-something, a muggle address in Brighton and underneath; the Piano-bar Thursdays at 10 pm, D. Malfoy-
Harry looked up at Hermione again. He wanted to correct her, it was on the tip of his tongue. Surely, he could say it. This was Hernione after all, the kindest, brightest witch of all. He opened his mouth, but his voice hitched. What did he want to say? That he rather liked being pushed and shoved and manhandled by Malfoy? That he prefered to be with him rather than the prettiest girl in school? That frequently he daydreamed about white-blond hair and pale eye-lashes, of being held down by strong arms, and about that haughty look Malfoy always had when he entered a room.
Potter gave him a furious glare. "If you weren't such a stuck-up sodding twat, I might tell you, but as it is, you can stay an ignorant son of a bitch."
Draco turned the little girl around and found a row of strange popping buttons that easily opened. With the dress off, it left the pants and diaper. With Lily now on her back, he took a deep breath and just pulled.
He started to sing. His voice went straight into the pit of my stomach and I found it hard to breathe.
Harry wished he could have his Invisibility Cloak on. Now there was nothing to hide him from having his picture taken, again and again. He could leave, he had already given his testimony. He didn't need to be there, yet he stayed. It was the last day of the trials against the Malfoys and today the verdict would fall.
"No, I'm not sure. Not about him, not about anything, really, and I would feel much more confident if I got through one meeting with him without us getting at each other's throats. He still is totally insufferable. But I'm absolutley sure about having this baby, and I think he's honest about wanting this as much as I am. At least, I want to give it a try." Harry sighed and closed his eyes. "Are you happy with being an Auror, Ron? Is it what you thought it would be like when we talked about it all those years ago?"
Harry glanced at Malfoy, who still had his eyes to the side. His face was now a flaming scarlet from his hairline to his neck.
"Mr Potter." Her tone was distant and held a questioning note, but she removed her hand from Draco and held it out for Harry to take. "How kind of you to visit, Mr Potter. Would you like to have some tea? Pipsey," she turned to the elf. "Will you be so kind to fetch another cup for Mr Potter?"
Harry felt a mild panic roaring up. It was because it's been so long since someone else had touched him, yeah, that must be it. He swallowed and tried to tame his breathing.
Harry stopped hesitating and firmly pushed his hand down Malfoy's trousers. He was equally hard. He moved his hand alongside the smooth skin on the vibrating shaft and savoured the sensation. Malfoy had now unzipped Harry's jeans and groped him. Harry felt the urge to be set free, so with his left hand, he quickly pulled his jeans, along with his pants down to his knees.
love Ginny. He loved sitting with her infront of the fireplace, holding her hand, or walking around the grounds with her, playing Quidditch with her. He wanted to keep her safe, to protect her, to care for her. With Malfoy it was compleatly different. It was rough, feverish and totally addictive. And even if there wasn't any tenderness between them, there was a strange trust. How could these two things compare?
"You had your hands on my shoulders," Potter continued. "Like this." His hands were warm and pressed Draco down on the mattress. The wight of his body upon Draco's made him involuntarily whimper. "Of course," Potter said hoarsely, "there were layers of clothes between us then. Nothing like this."
"I didn't know he was back in the country," Ron continued, narrowing his eyes suspiciously. "I thought he lived in France or Switzerland or something."
"That's the most absurd thing I've ever heard," Draco sputtered. He fixed his eyes on the seaweed again.
There was a dead silence, the only thing sounding was the clatter of the other customers. Harry felt his tongue stick to his dry palate. "I couldn't ask Ron, I just couldn't, or any of his brothers, for that matter. Neville was willing to help, but as he and Hannah, well, she wasn't okay with it." Harry was babbling. Malfoy only sat in silence, scrutinizing him along his pointy nose.
"Holy Hell!" Harry couldn't help bucking up to meet Malfoy's hot wet muscle as he cirkled and licked Harry's puckered hole. This was by far the wierdest hottest thing anyone had ever done to him and goose-bumps erupted all over his skin. Harry tried to hold back a moan and pressed his now fully hard dick into the mattress. Malfoy snickered behind him, "That's it, Potter, open up for me." Then he plunged his tongue further inside, working it in and out, massaging the tight ring soft and pliant. He fucked Harry with his tongue while Harry moaned and gasped at the sensation. "You think you're ready for a finger now?" Malfoy asked, his breath a little ragged and uneven. Harry nodded, unable to form actual words. Anything, anything to keep this going.
Potter grinned, but the truth was that this was the hottest thing Draco had ever experienced. He devoured Potter's tongue again and felt it resume its examination of Draco's tonsils at the back of the throat. This gave Draco an idea, and he pushed and flipped Potter onto his back on the bed, meandered southwards on the outstretched body with his mouth.
"Why not?" Draco snapped back. "Isn't that exactly what Potter said in his speech? That we are all victims, that it was all for a better purpose and that we all suffered."
Blaise rolled his eyes. So, it was going to be that kind of night. He shrugged and poured some more of the rather pinkish drink into Draco's cup.
"He's a very nice bloke," Harry said quietly. He wanted to scream and shout, pull her into his arms and hide there, but how could he. Not after what he'd done, not after what he now knew about himself. He wanted to tell her he was sorry that he'd made her disappointed, that he couldn't be who she wanted him to be.
know," Malfoy said quietly, "I did attend a Muggle university for my degrees, and I take on Muggle cases from time to time."
The letters morphed in and out, like under water, still totally legible. The lump in his throat grew and tears began to burn behind his eyes. He wanted to crawl up on his mother's knee, like when he was a little boy and bury his face against her warm bosom and never have to deal with this world again. Of course, this was his fate, it made perfect sense. It was like every piece fell into place, his destiny, the cruel joke the gods played on him.
"Oh my, oh my," Harry heard Mrs Weasley mutter, and in a whirl of soot she appeared in her patched burgundy dressing-gown and enveloped Harry in a fierce embrace. As always, she smelled homely of lavender-soap and vanilla. "What've you been up to now, boy?" she scolded, but Harry just hugged her back and buried his face in her hair.
His stomach churned. What if Daphne Greengrass's name came up in the bowl? He wasn't particularly keen on her, she was stupid. All the girls in his year was stupid. Maybe not Pansy, but she was more like a sister, he'd known her all his life. It couldn't be her, could it? What if it was someone he didn't know at all? Or worse - a Mud-blood? Could it even be a Muggle? He wasn't sure if it worked that way.
Then Malfoy had just laughed, mean and condecending. "Didn't you enjoy yourself this time, Harry? I can clearly recall
"Aww," Draco cried out. The PAIN. Instinctively he put his hands up to cover his aching nose, where Harry's head had hit him. They were filled with som warm sticky liquid.
Harry shifted a little to face Draco. He lay on the sofa with his head in his boyfriend's lap, and on his back seemed to be the most comfortable position for his aching spine. "Among our close friends, there's no Hufflepuffs."
Harry had his arms wrapped around a torso with a flat chest and a strong back, and his legs clutched around hips that was thrusting and pumping. A pair of balls slammed against the sensitive skin around his arsehole, where he obviously was getting fucked.
When they finally broke away to get some air, Draco puffed as he pinched Harry's arse-globes, "Merlin's pants, Potter, you're getting heavy!" and he laughed as he ducked when Harry raised his hand to shove him over the head.
In Ron and Hermione's warm familiar kitchen Harry collapsed in a chair and struggled to sort out his thoughts and feelings. It had been an impulsive thing to alter his speech, but he had thought of Draco and his mother and a notion had stuck to him, that they had all suffered, no matter what side you were on. He tried to get his friends to understand, but they just shook their heads at him. Draco had placed himself in the far corner of the room and said nothing, his arms crossed and his steel-grey eyes boring into Harry.
. Harry found himself feeling a bit uneasy about what the paper had decided to write, but it wasn't the first time and it would probably not be the last.
Harry drew a deep breath. "A while ago, I accidently swallowed a potion, or rather a mix of different potions. Seamus Finnegan made it. I don't really know what it contained, there were a lot of ... erm, lust-potions and such... I belive Madam Pomfrey has the full list. Anyway, I ended up in bed with Malf...Draco."
He folded it with great care and pushed aside the hangings, careful not to make a sound and placed it on Potter's bed, when he became aware of a pair of shining green eyes in the dark.
"Oh no, I managed to rattle up some old Slytherins too. Goyle will be there. I went back to Hogwarts to properly thank him for saving my arse, and he was in contact with Zabini and Nott. I belive Parkinson and Bulstrode also came."
When Potter came up to the Gryffindor dorm a few nights later, Draco could see that he noticed the dip in the bed, where his body laied, covered under the Cloak. Potter kept up some antics with Weasley and Thomas, talked to Longbottom for a while, then wished everybody a good night and eased himself down in the narrow space that was left on the bed. He drew the curtains, cast a silencing spell and pulled the Cloak away from Draco's face. Draco's cheeks were slightly tinged, and his white blond hair fell across the pillow. They looked at each other.
Harry was late. An iterrogation had gone on forever and Harry had to rush out in his uniform to meet Malfoy at the corner of the bookshop. Of course, Malfoy was on time and waiting with a displeased scowl on his face. "You're late, Potter, and why in Merlins name haven't you changed? I don't appreciate making an appearance under Auror surveillance."
"Not until you've thanked your mother and said hello to Molly and Andromeda. They're over there, all of them." Harry grabbed him by the arm and shoved him forward towards the group of elderly witches sitting nearby the buffet.
Blaise drew a steadying breath. This party was the first attempt of interaction ever made by his House. The Slytherin students younger than seventeen had all been bribed with tons of treats from Honeydukes to stay in the dorms for the night, and the remaining witches and wizards, that were of age, had all chipped in to make the most of the evening. The latest Wierd Sister's hits was pouring out of the portable record-player, conjured lights glowed in every corner and created a soft atmosphere. There was a lot at stake tonight and the Hufflepuffs helped, bless their simple souls. He exchanged a brief look of relief with Pansy.
When I was cleared and learned that I was welcome back to Hogwarts to finish my schooling, it felt like I had a chance to amend, to start over. I wanted to talk to you, maybe even be your friend. That's why I sent that letter before school started. But you never came, you weren't there.
"Are you telling me, that I'm perfect and that you, Harry Potter, are not?" Draco raised his voice a little. "You have no idea of how messed up I am. I also got these."
"Yeah, you moaned 'Harry, oh Harry' when balls-deep inside me," Potter laughed and wrestled him, then switched them around and Draco found himself on his back with Potter on top.
"You must have a plan, there's a baby coming." She tightened her arms around her. "Malfoy's from a rich pureblood family, in case you've forgotten. Having a child would mean something to him. It'll be his first-born."
Draco kept talking and Potter listened. At some point Potter took Draco's hand, the left with the ugly mark on the forearm. He didn't let go and Draco didn't pull away.
"It's Harry here. He's fine, but he's wondering if you could come through." McGonagall cast Harry a probing look. "It seems he needs your support."
He closed his eyes. There wasn't much space to move in, and the pushes from the bodies around him got Harry in a decent enough rhythm. It was incredibly hot and whiffs of sweat, musky and masculine, filled his nostrils. The beat of the bass hammered in his gut and slowly his breathing adjusted and his heartbeat sped up. He looked up, and he saw Malfoy.
Potter chuckled sleepily. "I know what you mean. It's bloody dark all day this time of year, isn't it?" He yawned and Draco heard him shuffle around in the sheets for a while. "Mine's not here either. D'you think they were afraid we'd wake up and start duelling or something?"
Pansy turned to him. "Maybe you should go and see if you can find us something to drink. I think we all could use some."
"Mum remarried years ago. Don't you think it would be nice if you could meet someone... someone that could matter?" He held up his hands in defence as Harry gave him a dark glare. "I'm not putting you up for a date, Dad, not ever again. I realize what a disaster that turned out to be."
"Not yet." Ron turned to Harry and grinned. "And I sincerely hope she never will. But that's not the point. If she does, I will understand. If you talk to Gin, I'm sure she'll understand too." His face became serious again. "Unless..."
"I would've thought you'd close the wards against me." It was in the middle of the night and the sitting room of the Manor was pitch black, except for a faint blue flame that flickered on the table in front of the man sitting there.
Malfoy grabbed his trousers from the floor and put them on in a swift angry flow as he spoke. "After all the the things that's happened between us, the bathroom, the brawl at my home and the Fire, you find having sex with me appropriate for a joke? Yeah, that makes sense. What a laugh you all must have. Let's all make fun of Malfoy the poof. Why not? He's only Death Eater scum anyway." He paced the floor with his wand still in his hand. Harry wanted to get out of bed, but he felt too naked, too exposed.
Of course, he knew mostly what there was to know about Defence Against Dark Arts as an Auror, but this was different. This had to be some old pureblood-family spell, that had proven to be totally unbreakable.
Malfoy gave a short laugh, but it bore no trace of humour. "Muggle pubs? Gladly. I'm quite over the pathetic prejudice teachings my father bestowed upon me, but you see, I don't have any Muggle money. And on top of that, I wouldn't know what to order once I got there."
"That there was to be a baby, on the other hand..." She shook her head with a dazed look on her face. "Did you know?"
Harry shook his head. "It doesn't matter." And they danced. They swayed to, what Harry thought was his own heartbeat. He pressed himself closer to Malfoy and whispered, "What if this isn't the last dance? What if this is the first?"
"Well, you certainly sang praise to my dick before you ruined my shoes with what must have been a full gallon of vodka."
They all walked to the Headmistress's office, Draco at Harry's side, casting worried glances at him repeatedly. In the doorway of the room Ron paused and held Hermione by the arm. "Take them to ours, 'Mione. I'll find Mum and fetch the kids and I see you at home." He kissed her briefly on the top of her head and left.
Harry continued, reluctantly at this point. "Healer Smith told me that for this to work, there are a few other things that needs to be fulfilled, though. The other father must be someone I have a connection to. Not necessary a romantic one, thank God, but a close friend, someone I'm tied to, bonded with... maybe someone I have a life-debt to..." Harry paused. "And it's absolutely essential that he's a pureblood wizard, so I thought I'd ask you."
"Just trust me for once, will you?" Malfoy said and then his lips descended on that spot and his hand gripped Harry's semi-hard shaft, and Harry gasped and bucked up to meet him.
He knew he looked ridiculous as he tried to lure Draco out on the dancefloor, as he wiggled his hips with his big belly bouncing with every move, but if the glimpse of mirth in those grey eyes were anything to go by, Harry had succeeded. He kept beckoning and pulled Draco up from where he was seated. They swayed to the music and Harry felt hopeful.
"See you around, Potter." They were both cleaned and dressed and Malfoy turned away from the door before opening it. Then he quickly closed it again. "Shit!" he hissed.
Harry buried his head even deeper into the pillow. He had mercilessly a too vivid picture of last night's events. "No, I can't…" he mewled. "It's not possible. I'm the Saviour, I can't be bent."
Harry's breathing was deep and slow. He felt a little dizzy, like his head had gone empty of thoughts. Harry closed his eyes and swayed a little as he felt a blankness fall over him.
Harry stopped breathing for a second. Then he raged. "How dare you insult me, my wife and my marriage by making the assumption that I would in any way be interested in something like that?" Harry pushed his chair back and it fell with a loud clatter. He didn't care. "You really must have your mind in the gutter, Malfoy."
He put his cup down at the nearest table, steadied himself an started to walk out of the room. He knew Blaise had a bottle of Firewiskey stashed away in the Slytherin common room, in case of emergency, and this totally qualified as an emergency. He made his way to the door, but when he reached out, the handle dissolved right in front of his hand. The door had disappeared.
"You are what you are, Potter. No hero-status can change that. Here," he put a small vial on the bedside table, "it's a Hangover-potion. You'll probably need it. I'm off, then."
Goyle hummed and cleared his throat, as if he was unused to speak. "No." He looked over his shoulder at the door and the small group of people that now emerged through it. Then he turned to Harry again. "You read his name. He was my best mate," he stated simply.
"I'd like to work with kids," Harry said, trying to hide the embarrassed flush that didn't seem to leave his face. "Showing them their first true spells, helping them getting it right, see the joy in their faces when they start managing their magic."
Harry saw him at the visitors entrance of the Ministry, leaning nonchalant against the battered old phonebooth, smoking a cigarette. "Good, you got my owl," he said as Harry crossed the street and walked towards him.
"Yes, I was spoild rotten, wasn't I?" He gave a little sad smile. "Mother became over-protective and Father unable to say no to anything, not until it was too late, anyway. It was hard on them, losing all those babies. Mother grieved fiercely and Father made himself distant and indulging. You see, in my family, I was the Boy-who-lived."
"What?" He had a bewildered look on his face, an array of un-masked feelings on display and he drew a quick breath.
After a while, when the world started spinning a little too wildly and Harry stumbled around stepping on everybody's toes, Malfoy dragged him back to the bar.
"I can't believe I'm here," he muttered and faced the wall instead of Malfoy's searching gaze. "What the fuck am I doing here?"
"Yes," Harry said and resisted an eyeroll. As if the man didn't know that without checking his notes.
Hermione had planned this outing in detail. For days she'd been discussing in which order to go to the different shops, to get the most out of the day, with her usual effectiveness. She also planned a lunch and after a long debate, they settled for the Hog's Head. Ron, Ginny and Harry just grinned and went along, quite aware that they had no say in the matter, anyway. On the way to the village, Ginny took Harry's hand, as they walked side by side, and he squeezed it and smiled at her affectionally.
