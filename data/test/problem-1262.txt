“Since when do you know about trees?” Harry asked her.
‘Family hug?’ Teddy asked, looking hopefully between Harry and Draco. Draco’s insides squeezed uncomfortably, and he looked to Harry for a clue as to what to do next. Harry glanced sideways at him and shrugged a shoulder almost imperceptibly.
He slumped against the wall of his cell, closing his eyes and forcing those images away. When he had calmed down enough, he let out a long breath. This was the worst time for a cold, and the chill in the air was enough to make his teeth chatter anyway, even though it was approaching summer. He sneezed again and groaned when his head throbbed. Now was the time to focus on the positives however, to keep himself sane. He had managed to transform, that was a good thing, and he had all the time in the world to practise, assuming animagus magic wasn’t dampened in a place like this. There was also still a chance that the spell had worked, and he just didn’t know it yet. Maybe only Potter could feel it and he was coming back to Draco that very moment.
Draco didn’t leave his flat the whole weekend. He ignored floo calls from Hermione and Pansy, and even one from Luna whom Draco assumed had been put up to it by one of the other two – maybe even both. He stayed in bed and drifted in and out of sleep all through Saturday and Sunday, to the point where on Sunday he was disorientated, and his body clock was completely off. He knew it was bad for him, especially considering now was a time when he should be trying very hard to keep himself functional, but he was battered and bruised, and he needed time to mope.
‘Malfoy.’ Harry said stiffly.
‘You think?’ Smith encouraged. Draco didn’t really want to talk about it, but he figured he’d try.
“Oh you’re not a happy bunny, are you?” Luna cooed at the fox like it was a baby. “Harry, you’d better come with, obviously you two are quite attached already.”
‘It is indeed. And that over there,’ he pointed to the shop on the corner of the street, right across from the view of the cathedral, ‘is my favourite bookshop in all of Paris.’ Harry smiled at Draco’s excitement.
‘Listen to what, Mum?’ She gave him a sad smile.
Draco would remain stubborn until his dying breath. ‘Of course.’ Harry rolled his eyes, but his smile stayed in place. Gabriel led them through to the back of the shop, although Draco still had a few seconds to eye the display cabinets. The vast array of baked goods from brightly coloured macarons to elegant petit fours to heart-warming tarte tatin.
‘And this means you spending time with a social worker, because?’ He prompted after a pause.
‘Well, over the past decade since the war, the healing profession has been trying to branch out into mental health the same way muggles have. Not that the muggle mental healthcare service is nearly adequate enough. I’ve heard they’ve been trying to amend memory charms to be able to assess mental damage, but it’s an incredibly new field. Is that how they want to treat you?’ Draco snapped the hair tie into place at the bottom of Hermione’s plait and she quickly twirled around to face him, her eyes wide with concern.
Granger was clearly uncomfortable with his silence. “She called every lawyer in the city but none of them were prepared to help.”
It took him a while to get to the library since it was two floors up from the floo and there had been a delay getting the lifts installed after the surveyor had found the shafts structurally unstable. Draco didn’t have much physical strength anymore and by the time he reached the top of the second staircase he was panting for breath. He ignored the swoop of self-pity his stomach gave.
Draco was astounded. ‘Just how much magic does she have?’ He’d never come across someone so small generating such power. It seemed even Johnny could feel something, even if he didn’t know what it was, as he clung to Draco in fear. His little head tucked under Draco’s jaw and his arms clutched his coat tightly. ‘It’s ok, I’ve got you.’ He muttered into the little boy’s hair. He didn’t know if it made any difference. They rounded a corner and entered a part of the orphanage Draco had never been in.
‘Everything’s fine.’ He didn’t know if that was a lie. Everything
He was never going to call that bitch Helen. Hela maybe.
‘Leave him, Harry. Be happier with me. He’s broken, isn’t he? I could sense it when he stepped into the shop. Not an ounce of magic anywhere. We wouldn’t want that, would we? All your power going to waste on a half-wizard. Such a shame. Or you could come with me.’ Wood’s eyes glinted in the dull light and Draco wondered what had happened to him. He wasn’t too old to play professional quidditch, and as far as Draco knew, he hadn’t been injured. Something was missing here. ‘We could be happy together. You could help me get back into quidditch…’
Trying very carefully not to soak the cuff of his jacket in Ron’s third pint, Harry didn’t notice the music as he made his way back to Ron. They were sat at the furthest extent from the bar with their backs to the door. Ultimately, they were trapped if they wanted to leave in the event of an emergency. Then again, Harry had never walked away from an emergency in his life.
‘Right.’ He agreed nervously. Teddy took his hand and squeezed it tightly and Draco thought he couldn’t possibly love the boy any more than he did in that moment. They made it through the pub with relative ease, although Draco had to concentrate very hard on looking straight ahead and not thinking about it. There were people packed so tightly they made a tin of sardines look roomy. He was convinced he saw one wizard with three other wizards sitting on his lap – not that any of them seemed to mind in the slightest. Teddy kept a tight grip on his hand, and he would have to let him have one of Fortescue’s famous Christmas hot chocolates, it was the least he deserved.
‘Shut your mouth Harry, you’re making the place look untidy. Now, I’m about to educate you on the excellence of television.’ He plonked Harry down on his favourite sofa, smirking as he groaned when it moulded around him, and set up a tv show he’d discovered when he’d heard a couple of old French men grumbling about it at a bar once.
‘What?’ Harry’s mouth snapped shut and Draco looked down at Ella who was still sitting in his lap and looking up at him with wide, terrified eyes.
‘It’s a little ray of sunshine in the dark.’ Harry smiled at him.
Draco collapsed into his desk chair and took ragged breaths trying to get his anxiety under control. A couple of stray tears escaped his eyes, but he scrubbed them away with such ferocity it made his eyes sting.
Was he going to become a squib? No, he couldn’t handle that. Not now.
‘I shouldn’t have said what I did. It was awful and I hate knowing I’ve upset you.’
‘Listen, Draco, I know you must think I’m an absolute wanker-’
His eyes roamed her appearance and although he was distracted by the heavy thumping of his heart in his chest, he found he was able to notice almost every detail of her. She was barefoot for starters and it reminded him of Luna Lovegood who often went barefoot. Had Harry been watching Luna, there would have been nothing unusual about her barefooted-ness. Lyra Malfoy however, the woman sitting on the stool, was far more proper than Luna and going barefoot was simply not the Malfoy way. It was even more strange to Harry that she was wearing yet more rings on her exposed toes. She was wearing a floaty dress with flowers all over it and a denim jacket, both of which must have been borrowed because Harry couldn’t imagine them being anything Malfoy would ever wear in a million years. Even her hair was wrapped around some kind of purple flower Harry couldn’t name. If it wasn’t for the pointedness of her features and the chill in her eyes when they locked with his, he would have thought she was someone else entirely.
‘There’s something else in there too.’ Harry hinted. Teddy routed around in the bottom of the box and sat there on the floor looking puzzled.
He sat down at his kitchen table to open the letter, which seemed far thicker than any letter he’d ever received from Gringotts before. Gringotts never contacted anyone unless to inform them of an inheritance or an outstanding debt to be paid, neither of which applied to Draco. With a strange kind of eagerness, Draco tore apart the wax seal and began reading the almost indecipherable goblin script.
Draco all but collapsed full-length into the gap Harry left when he disappeared upstairs. He felt wrung out and his head was spinning terrible. When Harry reappeared, he handed him his second potions of the day and whilst they stopped him feeling quite so woozy, he still wasn’t feeling great. Harry sat down on the sofa and Draco curled up against him. Harry’s solid weight and warmth made far more difference than the potions did, and he settled happily, the familiar sweetness of Harry’s aftershave soothing him.
‘Do you want to see some magic?’ The children were exposed to magic of course, but it wasn’t a regular occurrence around the place, so they were always thrilled to see it. She lifted her head from his chest but still held onto him tightly, turning her tear-streaked face towards Harry. He didn’t need to, but Harry withdrew his wand to perform the spell for the theatrics of it. He waved it over the page lightly.
‘Did you date Oliver Wood?’ His own voice sounded foreign to his ears – scratchy, quiet, uncertain.
Of course he didn’t understand. How could he? The pressures he’d been put under had come from other people. Draco had had that when he was younger, from his father. Now? Now he put that pressure on himself. Because he had to make amends. He had to.
‘You’re starting to sound like Hermione.’
‘So, I just had an interesting conversation with Ted.’ He said as he leant against the bench.
“Where’s Hermione when you need her?” Ron muffled from the cushion he had buried his face in.
do you want me to teach them? I’m not a natural leader…’
. He didn’t even have an interesting name.
‘So long as you don’t run off with some toyboy quidditch player.’ It was a low blow, he’d admit that.
“Why are there so many extra letters?” Harry has given up all pretence of working now, and is actually ashamed of how much he’s enjoying watching Malfoy read manuscripts and write notes in his elegant and looping handwriting.
He found himself sat between Harry and Bill at the table, which felt very enclosed and a little odd but generally manageable. He and Bill got on well since Draco had a relatively competent knowledge of curses and cursebreaking. Bill was doing slightly less risky jobs than he had before the kids were born, although Draco got the impression he often told Fleur little white lies about the nature of the work he was doing.
He was just getting lost in the kiss when Harry pulled sharply on his bottom lip and he was snapped back to his senses. He pushed Harry away from him and fought to catch his breath. They were staring at each other, wild eyed and puffy lipped. Draco could smell Harry on him; a mix of cedar and grapefruit – the notes of the aftershave Draco used to buy him.
‘M’rry Chr’mas,’ he murmured.
The case was actually going well. Draco knew it would take him a few weeks to analyse the pills Harry had been given at the clinic. He’d said that Healer Matthews had all but thrown them into his hands and told him they fix almost anything. Draco was certain that these were the pills that had caused the problem, but he’d need to use muggle techniques to analyse their contents and whilst he had some knowledge of the subject, he would have to be much more careful. Muggles didn’t get instantaneous results, so Draco would have to wait a while before he knew exactly what he was dealing with.
‘Well the truth is, that isn’t what’s bothering me.’ Teddy admitted, fiddling with the ragged sleeve of his jumper. Draco frowned.
‘We should also figure out what we’re going to do when Teddy comes how. It might be a bit much if we both appear at the station. We got away with it when he left, but I’m pretty sure the
‘For- for thoughts?’ The mediwitch nodded, her eyes full of sympathy.
was something that had been drilled into him anyway. There was a reason he’d survived the war and heaven knew it wasn’t anything to do with looking after himself. No, Harry didn’t like it when Draco was out too long without him because Harry wouldn’t be there to protect him. Harry had hoped that by now suspicion over Draco’s affiliations would’ve been less of an exciting topic, but just last month the
‘Aunt Hermione!’ Teddy was always happy to see Hermione. They’d bonded when he was very small. He wasn’t quite so attached to Ron, but he seemed to be warming up to him a bit more these days.
‘I’ve gone and done it? All I’ve done is present you with something the whole world has clearly already seen. Do you have anything to say? Or are you going to feign ignorance?’ Harry shook his head.
Malfoy’s whereabouts had never occurred to Harry until now. He couldn’t even remember the last time he had seen her, and he certainly didn't remember ever feeling so entranced by her before. He definitely couldn’t imagine Lucius Malfoy encouraging Lyra to wander around barefoot under any circumstance. He imagined Lucius sitting at their breakfast table in formal robes and shivered as he pushed the unwelcome images of those rooms from his mind.
“I was trying to tell you about the huge engagement party Astoria is throwing. She wanted to know if it would be appropriate to invite you.” She stared at him with anticipation over the rim of her coffee cup but if it was an outburst she was looking for, she wouldn’t get one.
At some point, sometime that day, she did go back to writing that letter. Instead of just staring at her, Harry even helped. But along with the signing of said letter, and the hatching of the plan to bring Remus and Sirius together, Potter became Harry and Malfoy became Lyra.
‘Will you read
‘It’s part of my medication.’ He answered simply.
The wind was bracing as he stepped out, October had hit the chateau with such force this year. He trekked out to the snug, which he hadn’t been to since their big talk, and began to wonder what Harry wanted. He’d seemed shocked, and he hoped he wasn’t about to unveil something else that would divide their time. Draco didn't think they were ready for any other commitments. Between the book, and the orphanage, and Ella, they had a lot to deal with. Not to mention the fact that Draco thought having Teddy back for the summer would have eased his anxiety. Instead, it had only made it worse once he’d began his second year. Thankfully, he’d been a lot better with owling regularly than he had in his first year.
“But I’m asking
‘Of course.’ Harry said stiffly, not looking at Draco. Draco supposed he should take what he could get.
‘You’re beautiful when you sleep.’ He said it like it was obvious as telling him it was raining outside, and Draco flushed to his roots.
Draco was suitably surprised. “She really wants to know? She hates that kind of thing.”
Harry didn’t stop until they were out of the cathedral and stood by the river. There weren’t as many people loitering around since it was still cold outside.
Draco looked up to the top of the tree. Since Teddy had been old enough to hold it, he’d been the one to put the star on the top. Harry had told him his aunt had always insisted on putting an angel on the top, but Harry said they didn’t need an angel to watch over them. He said it was more important to always look for the light. This year was the first year Teddy hadn’t decorated the tree with Harry.
Affair with Wood or not, only Draco got to experience this.
“I see.”
‘I want to adopt her.’
‘Pansy is fitting in well at the Ministry trying to sort of the process for registering orphaned children. It’s complicated magic, but it builds on the same blood magic that works with the magical register and the Hogwarts register, so it should be possible to do the same thing. We don’t know how that’ll work on the muggle side of things, but it’s a start. Erm…I spoke to the board, they’re unconvinced about you teaching. Mainly because it’s well, you. I think they’ll come around though. Oh, and Ella told me to give you a big hug and a kiss and to tell you she’d going to be an angel in the nativity play, so you can’t call her a sausage anymore.’
‘I’m sorry,’ he said a little sheepishly. He couldn’t understand what had happened. Hermione had just left and he’d been drinking his tea, how had he-?
Draco was the first to pull away, trying his best not to get overwhelmed.
‘I don’t know my love, I wish I did.’
Thursday 27
“I’m sure it’ll come to you,” Remus said encouragingly. And so, Harry talked. He explained in the lightest way possible that there must be something wrong with the tapestry because obviously Lyra was the real Black heir and she was right in front of them. However, as he spoke, he realised how ridiculous the whole thing sounded when said aloud. It was impossible for these two Malfoys to exist at the same time.
‘Harry, breathe. You don’t have a chance of me understanding this if you give up half way. What game have you been playing.’ Harry jumped to his feet, unable to contain himself.
He hated the uncertainty that surrounded that life now. Harry’s eyelashes fluttered as he dreamed and Draco remembered how it had been when he’d first returned. Harry had promised him things would be different, that he wouldn’t let him go ever again. He supposed he’d made true on that promise, although it hadn’t been the way he’d expected. It wasn’t as though Draco had thought they’d waltz right back into their marriage like none of it had ever happened, he simply hadn’t expected that those same problems they’d had before would still be with them now.
‘I swear Harry if you call me cute one more time, I’ll-’
Just as Harry is beginning to think it’s muggle portrait, the girl turns and looks down her nose at him like she’s just found mud caked to her shoe. Seems about right.
‘You should be taking more care keeping on top of this Mr Malfoy,’ he gritted his teeth when she said the wrong name yet again, ‘you’ve been on Regeneration for well over a month now.’ His stomach churned uncomfortably as she peered at him over the cat-eye style reading glasses she wore.
. How wild is that? Oh! And! Get this; she whipped it with sugar, and it was all fluffy like a meringue on top of the milk! I’ve got to try it myself. Are you sure muggles don’t have
Harry stood up straighter. “I’ve never heard of them.” He didn’t like that Malfoy seemed to think she was entitled to name
‘Mhm?’
‘You know I’d do anything to get you a baby, don’t you?’ Harry asked him. He felt as Draco nodded his head.
‘Well, I’ve been talking to Neville sometimes, just at the weekends, when he comes to tend to the plants. He was telling me about how all the plants he grows in the greenhouses can be used in some potion or other. Some of them are poisons of course, but some of them save lives. I think that’s pretty cool. He lent me lots of books on plants and when I understood how they grow and how they’re used, potions made so much sense!’ He beamed across the table at Draco, proud of his little epiphany. Draco was incredibly proud too.
‘I suppose you think you’re clever then.’ Harry turned away from the door and walked down the landing to their room, so Draco took that as a cue to follow.
Harry smiled. ‘I suppose we are.’ One of the tears trickling down Harry’s face collected at the corner of his mouth and Draco swiped his thumb across his bottom lip as he caught it. He was about to lean in to kiss him when Harry jerked backwards as though he’d been struck by lightning.
He was astounded. “What? I mean it! I could listen to you all day. Ever since that open mic night I-”
‘Do you think we should…?’ Draco asked him.
‘It’s me, love. It’s just me.’ Draco could hardly see a thing in the dark. His eyes adjusted just enough to see Harry watching over him. The relief that swept through him was like the first drop of rain after a drought. He pulled Harry towards him with such force they nearly toppled off the sofa they’d fallen asleep on. He kissed him like he was starved. It was hungry and desperate, and he needed it more than he’d needed anything in his life.
Harry scrubbed his hands down his face with frustration. “And it’s always you in my dreams! You always lead me to Draco, but you can’t even tell me why! Who is he? Why is he so important?” It was a fruitless, a one-sided conversation, but since he had woken up something had changed for Harry. It was no longer a case of
‘Harry, it’s ok.’ He said, his thumb stroking gently over the back of Harry’s knuckles. ‘We’ll figure it out. It’s not your responsibility to fix this on your own, we can figure this out together and no one else needs to get hurt, ok?’ Draco knew how overwrought Harry got when he felt like he wasn’t solving his cases quick enough. Draco had done a lot to help Harry’s saviour complex and Harry was able to control some of his compulsions a lot better than before. Still, it was a part of him and Draco couldn’t help but admire Harry’s selfless dedication.
“I think we’re doing the only thing we can do.”
“Very well then. If you’re done with your tea, I will take you to the library. But under no circumstances are you to be left alone with the manuscripts. Not only are you woefully unequipped to deal with the cataloguing system, I guarantee you have no clue what to look for.”
‘Ella?’ Draco approached her carefully, kneeling down beside her.
Looking into the fox’s grey eyes filled Harry with a sense of purpose, of determination. Like him being in his life was important. There was no logical reason for this, Harry knew. The poor thing could still be someone else’s lost pet or secretly completely feral and dangerous. But when it looked up at Harry like that, with its large eyes and its chin in Harry’s palm, Harry knew he would die for his new companion.
‘Da-Draco,’ Teddy said after he was done discussing house quidditch, ‘I get why you like potions so much now.’ Draco’s head shot up from his plate where he’d just finished the last of his food. He hadn’t expected that.
‘Yeah?’ Harry turned his head back to look at Draco.
‘He what? What date?’ Hermione nearly slopped her tea over the side of her mug. Draco scourgified the few drops that made it over the edge.
‘Love, you already have a medal.’ Harry looked at him in confusion for far longer than he should’ve.
‘Oh that! Come through here. Both of you.’ Draco glanced down at the once again sleeping Hugo and wondered whether he should try to put him down or not. ‘Just bring him, Draco. It’s not like he’ll wake up. That boy sleeps deeper than his dad and that’s saying something.’ So, Draco stood carefully and carried Hugo through to Hermione’s study at the back of the house. He’d only been in the room once. It was quite similar to Harry’s study except there were fewer photos and about ten times the books. One of which was laying open on the table in the middle of the room.
‘Abuse! Abuse!’ Harry yelped between laughs. Draco rolled his eyes.
“Oh for the love of- of course it had to bloody rain too.” Draco complained, getting more exasperated by the second.
No Malfoy had ever managed an animagus transformation, since Veela heritage had made the shift impossible, but Draco wanted to be the one to do it. The Veela blood in him was so infinitesimal now that the only trait he really had was the white hair and pointy chin. Maybe the viciousness, but that depended on who you asked.
What he was less thrilled by was the Ginny who appeared opposite him. He supposed Molly had done that on purpose to try and heal the feud between them. Draco wasn’t even sure what it was about now – it wasn’t as though Harry and Ginny had been together anywhere near the time they started dating. As far as he knew that had been dead and buried for years by that point. Harry was seventeen when he broke up with her for crying out loud! At least, Draco thought he was seventeen. He didn’t care to remember.
He felt dejected. He had thought they’d just agreed to be just that. “No, I suppose we’re not.” He said quietly.
‘I- yes. I should’ve talked it all out with you instead of writing it in a book, I know that now.’ He looked at Harry pleadingly, hoping he wouldn’t be offended. Instead, Harry gave him a gentle smile.
‘Mister Potter! How good it is to see you properly awake. I’m afraid it might not last long, you’re due Dr Ubbly’s.’ She was a middle-aged mediwitch with a kindly smile that made Draco feel a little better, until his brain caught up with what she was saying.
He didn’t care that he didn’t know what was going on between Harry and Wood. Harry had come for him as soon as he had asked, and he’d been here the whole time. Draco had all the time in the world to be angry at him later, but now he really needed him.
“You don’t need to.” She sniffed. Her entire body seemed closed to him now. “I already know it’s stupid, it won’t work, and it’s not worth my time.” Had she always been so pessimistic?
He hadn’t known what it would be like to see her again after their kiss. It made him hot all over to think about it even now. It wasn’t as though he had expected them to talk about it, but it was an elephant in the room. He certainly hadn’t expected her to show up on his doorstep all bright and bubbly like a kid in a sweetshop. He’d obviously seen to that quickly enough anyway.
The night before their international portkey, Draco didn’t sleep a wink. He tossed and turned uncomfortably well into the early hours of the morning. Things had been…strained since his return. He half regretted leaving it so long before letting Harry say his piece. Everything had been pressing on Draco’s shoulders so much that he could hardly function normally around him, and he could see Harry was struggling to know how to deal with it.
‘We won’t have the house to ourselves for quite a while.’ Harry mumbled. Draco grinned.
‘Of course they don’t call it MAMF. They’re French, they have standards.’ He took him to a room he’d had to fight Spungen on – he shouldn’t have really, since Spungen had to take orders directly from him. It was done out like a muggle cinema, loosely, considering Draco had only been to one once.
He couldn’t handle much more of this uncertainty.
Draco went through these thoughts every time an article ran about Potter, which was frequently. Investigations had been going on ever since Potter had disappeared and it was only a matter of time before someone connected the dots and realised Draco was one of the last people to see him. It wasn’t possible for Draco to know exactly when Potter went to the DoM, but it can’t have been long after they spoke. The pictures taken of them had never surfaced and it was both a blessing and a curse. Out there in the open Draco would immediately have been under suspicion and probably would have been flung in Azkaban for the privilege, but knowing those images were being kept quiet only meant living in fear.
he thought.
‘I’m you.’
‘He is a trained professional. Maybe he knows something you don’t. You’re welcome to stop by my office any time, you know that, but don’t you think you should check in with Harry? He’s been worried sick you know. He wouldn’t tell the healers a thing about what happened other than you were trying to practice magic. I’ve been his best friend since we were eleven, I know when he’s not telling me something.’ She gave him a pointed look and he had to break eye contact. He always managed to forget how fierce she could be. In the best way of course.
His face must have shown his confusion, as Harry added, ‘and her accidental magic is going haywire.’
‘Live without what, baby?’ He asked him.
He was completely aghast. ‘You know about Pâtisserie Jules?’ It was a small bakery, not very well know, mainly because it was a wizarding establishment on a primarily muggle street. Still, Draco had meant to visit when he was living here and had never gotten around to it.
“Trust me Draco, you’ll like this.” Hermione said to him. On that particular day, Harry had made falafel, a speciality of his that Ron and Hermione always begged him to make. One of the few things he’d managed to recover from his parents’ house when he went back all those years later was an old cookbook belonging to his grandmother. Falafel was the first recipe he tried, and it had become his signature.
‘Bloody hell Draco!’ Harry jumped when Draco appeared looking like death anthropomorphised. Draco giggled at Harry’s shock, remembering that time in third year when he’d pretended to be a dementor just to make him fall of his broom. He’d been so obvious with his crush back then, how no one had noticed was beyond him.
‘Come on! Come on! I want to go already!’ He was nearly jumping off the walls.
‘Hey, hey, don’t panic. It’s not so bad, you’re getting way too ahead of yourself. Just wait until you get there and you get engrossed in all your lessons and your friends. You’ll forget all about us.’
‘We’ve all got both light and dark inside us, Draco. What matters is the part we choose to act on. That’s who we really are.’
He leapt up onto the arm of the sofa and looked down at a sleeping Potter. He looked so young when he was asleep and had no worry lines crinkling his eyes. His skin looked surprisingly soft for someone who Draco could confidently say didn’t have a skincare routine. His hair was the same disaster it always was, but Draco had missed the mop so much he was nothing but delighted to see it again.
‘Sorry. Yes, you’re right. Just let me finish up and then we can go home.’ He darted off into the office and left Draco standing there awkwardly.
“Can I help you gentlemen?” Draco asked politely. He didn’t look Pansy’s way, but he could tell she was tense. The room had stilled unnaturally as the two wizards tried, and failed, to stare Draco down.
‘Did it?’ Neville asked him curiously.
‘It’s fine,’ Harry said. He let go of Draco and walked out of the room. Draco felt like a world class idiot. Things couldn’t be easy on Harry either. He’d been responsible for a lot of Draco’s rehabilitation in the early days, he was basically keeping Draco since he wouldn’t let him pay for anything and setting up the orphanage had taken a lot of him too.
“I know, but I think it’s the not knowing that’s upsetting her the most. It’s one thing to let us go without her, it’s another that we can’t even tell her why we’re going or how long we might be gone.” He could absolutely see her point.
“You see this section here?” Malfoy points to a line of illegible text but Harry just nods so that he can hurry the explanation. “It refers to the Sole Repelleris curse.” Harry can see that he has also written it in his own handwriting next to the manuscript, although Malfoy pronounced it like so-lay when it’s written with an e. There’s a funny flat line over the top of the e which clearly means something to him.
“Oh, I forgot to mention earlier – have you heard of this thing called instant coffee? Granger introduced it to me. It’s like regular coffee, except it dissolves
‘I’m being so boring right now, aren’t I?’
‘And now you think that since it’s been so long since the war, they think they’ll be under less scrutiny.’ Draco suggested.
, Draco was screaming inside his mind.
Harry thought for a moment while Aspen kneaded at his t-shirt. “I say we go and see Sirius and get to the bottom of this.” He could see the look of irritation on her face and again he was nettled. “Look, you don’t have to come with me if you don’t want to, but you didn’t see how sad he was, ok? I’m doing this whether you’re with me or not.”
‘Harry arranged with McGonagall for him to come back for a weekend. It seems silly really, interrupting his studies like that. I’m fine now, it’s not like he needs to rush to my bedside.’ He actually really wanted Teddy to come home, just for a little bit. He missed his little wolf and he didn’t want to go so long without seeing him when he never really got the chance to say goodbye. That didn't stop him feeling guilty for causing so much disruption to his first year. He hadn't wanted him to leave for school, but he had expected him to enjoy his lessons and make friends and not be worrying about what's going on at home.
‘He wants to invite you to his birthday. He said Teddy had been pestering him about it for weeks. He even offered me an invitation if it meant you’d come.’
He shivered.
‘Take it.’ Harry said, gesturing to the potion once again. ‘Go on.’ Draco’s mind was fogging again. He didn’t like to be put on the spot. He slid onto one of the stools at the breakfast counter before it became obvious he was crumbling again. He wouldn’t be weak, he wouldn’t. He was a grown man, he would not be reduced to a snivelling child just because someone shouted at him.
‘How did you know about that?’ He asked her coldly. An angry flush crept up the back of her neck.
‘If you know of any better solutions, feel free to make a suggestion,’ she said contritely, her lips pursed. She looked unusually McGonagall-like. He nodded defeatedly and swung his legs over the side of the bed, wanting to leave as soon as possible. He refused to let Harry come to these check-ups since he hadn’t yet managed to control his over-bearing worry, but that didn’t mean Draco was all that comfortable going alone either.
‘He said it matches the Christmas tree,’ Harry supplied from beside him where he was lounging casually on top of his side of the covers, a breakfast tray laid out between them. Draco pushed himself up slowly and tried to ignore the feeling that he needed a good three hours more sleep than he was getting.
April 1999
‘I don’t believe it!’ Harry’s eyes brimmed with tears and Draco was shocked. It took a lot to move Harry like that and he was certain a letter had never managed it before.
Draco made a dreamy kind of face as if he could taste it just by Harry mentioning it. “Ugh. That paella was so good. You’re too good to me you know.”
‘Draco!’ Hermione was the first to approach him and he greeted her with a brief hug and a kiss on either cheek. Her jumper depicted a dog with a Santa hat on it with the caption “Bah humpug”. Terrible, truly terrible.
The same wave of irritation that had hit him before was back and he quashed it before he could say something he’d regret.
‘Teddy, did you make these yourself?’ He asked him. He nodded enthusiastically and grinned so broadly it looked as though his face would split in two.
‘Really? Wow, you must be getting the extra special stuff then!’ He winked at Daphne.
“You look like shit,” Pansy remarked when she saw him for the first time that morning. Her gaze flicked up and down him as she took in his strange new apparel.
‘Did he just try to call me dad?’ He asked her in horror. She tipped her head back in laughter.
‘Draco? What happened?’
He crept into the bedroom quietly when he realised Harry was already asleep. This was one of the things Draco loved most about being home – seeing Harry so peaceful in his sleep. In their bed. He didn’t like going to sleep like this, without being able to tell him how much he loved him. He’d lost too many people in his life to ever leave things on a bad note. Still, knowing that whatever went on during the day didn’t stop them sleeping next to each other was a comfort.
‘It’s definitely an improved version of side-along. I hope it doesn’t catch on though, I’m not sure it would be quite the same with Ron.’
‘Do you still hate surprises now?’
(See the end of the chapter for
‘I love you too,’ he said with a roll of his eyes and just for effect, reached over to kiss him quickly.
wasn’t willing to be used like that.’ Draco understood that. Harry spent his life not knowing whether people were interest in him for him, or for his celebrity.
Harry’s skin was a light shade of gold. It wasn’t dark, not at all, but compared to Draco’s own porcelain skin, Harry always looked so warm. He was still sporting that designer stubble Draco was beginning to love on him, and had the circumstances been different, nothing would’ve stopped Draco from nipping and biting his way along Harry’s sharp, cut-from-marble jawline.
Malfoy looked at him unblinkingly. To him it felt as though the rest of the room was swept away and he was sucked into a vacuum. He hadn’t had any alcohol, but his head was spinning as if he had been drinking for hours. He silently willed her to look away so that he could go back to breathing properly again, and so that his heart wouldn’t beat right out of his chest, but she seemed as locked in the exchange as he was. It was Harry who blinked first and instantaneously the spell was broken. Noise flooded back into his ears like a swarm of bees, drowning out his own thoughts and leaving him disorientated.
‘Ok. Tell Macmillan to come down and see me when he has the chance please.’ The intern nodded and scampered away. They always walked around the department like deer caught in the headlights and Draco wondered whether Harry purposefully put the fear of God into them. Harry seemed to know everyone and everything that went on in his department, unlike other department heads. Draco hadn’t realised just how much responsibility Harry was shouldering here. He’d been made Head Auror a year into their marriage and if Draco was honest, it really had put a strain on things.
‘Only if we can look at Quidditch supplies!’ Draco rolled his eyes but agreed. He reluctantly agreed to let Teddy take a muggle black cab since he’d always been fascinated by them and was grateful he’d had the foresight to bring more muggle cash with him than he normally would. He wasn’t sure he’d ever get used to pounds and pence.
‘We love you too.’ Harry said, Draco watched as the little crinkles appeared by his eyes as he smiled and Draco memorised his face.
Draco’s head fell heavily into his hands when he realised for the first time that maybe it was him who’d screwed up their marriage, not Harry.
‘Why, Harry of course. Who else? You didn’t think I’d really let you stay with him after that mark on your arm came back, did you? The Saviour of the Wizarding World, The Boy Who Lived Twice. He’s a most prized asset, Draco. I'm not going to let him live in constant danger. You should know that. It’s for your own good. You’ll be free without him. You can live your life with as much dark magic as you want.’
Draco’s left hand let go of the wheel to reach for the gearstick when the car made a loud grinding noise. “What the fuck was that?!” Harry’s palms were sweating from a mixture of nerves and the inability to take control of the vehicle, which was veering off to the right while Draco shrieked.
“Go!” He said a little too harshly. She swallowed nervously but did as he told her. When the door clicked shut, he dropped the fox on the bed. “What the hell do you think you’re playing at?” He asked it. “I was about to have a very important conversation and I think you knew that full well. What was the point in you showing up here if you can’t even talk? Because you came here for a reason, didn’t you? You know something.”
‘I love you.’ He heard as he fell back to sleep, but he was too far gone to say it back.
‘Harry…’ He half whispered, kissing him gently and moving some of his hair from where it had flopped over his eyes. He’d pulled the covers right up under his chin and was clutching onto them like his life depended on it. Draco pulled away from him and Harry pouted in his sleep. Draco huffed a laugh and kissed him again. This time after a few seconds there was some movement and Harry’s lips moved under his. Draco hoped he wouldn’t get used to being woken up with kisses because he certainly wouldn’t be making a habit of it.
‘But you love Fred Astaire. I don’t
‘It’s definitely made things easier.’ Draco agreed.
Draco curled into Harry’s side feeling overwhelmingly guilty for being irritated with him. After all, communication had been one of the main reasons they’d ended up getting divorced, they shouldn’t be falling back into those bad habits now.
, Draco thought,
‘Sure. Sounds like a great idea.’ He lied. He’d go, for Teddy. How bad could it be?
“Malfoy,” Harry’s voice cracked in the middle of her name. She turned, her blonde curls catching the moonlight as she did so. “Thank you.”
‘I missed you too sweetheart,’ He said gently, hugging her back with slightly less ferocity. It was nice to feel so important. Especially to someone so young and dependent who trusted Draco like he could do no wrong. Someone who knew nothing at all about his past.
‘Ted, is he bullying you?’ Draco’s heart could burst. He’d been worried about this, so worried he hadn’t even realised how much it had been praying on his mind.
‘No! No, no I wouldn’t dare.’ Harry took both of Draco’s still trembling hands in his. ‘I just wanted to scare him like I used to back in the force. He doesn’t know I would never try it though, he probably thinks everyone’s mind works like this. Please, you have to believe me. I just want you to be safe. That’s all I’ve ever wanted. The thought he might hurt you…I was incensed.’ He swallowed hard, looking at Draco with wide, terrified eyes. Draco hadn’t expected him to be so fretful about it.
‘DRACO? WHAT’S GOING ON?’ Harry shouted through the door. He couldn’t reply, even if he wasn’t tongue tied, he wouldn’t know what to say. It had to be one of the times Harry forgot he was a wizard and didn’t open the door by force. He didn’t want Harry to see anyway, to see his lack of control. He’d think he was dangerous, probably, and maybe he was. This was uncharted territory for everyone involved after all.
Draco’s heart dropped. There were photographs of Harry and Leggy-Blonde walking through London with coffee cups in hand. In one Harry was laughing, his smile bright and his cheeks flushed. In another, Leggy-Blonde was gripping his elbow tightly and pointing at something off in the distance that was out of shot.
What on…oh, it was a play on
‘Draco,’ Harry chuckled, ‘we can do whatever you want. No justification necessary.’ He reached for Draco’s hand across the table. They finished their coffee sitting quietly, happy in each other’s company.
Harry woke up with a gasp, flat on his back on his living room floor, Aspen curled up on his chest. His little fox stirred, disturbed by Harry’s violent awakening. He stares at Harry with his large grey eyes and if Harry’s not much mistaken, the fox knows the dream he just woke from.
‘I get it. I was highly dependent on you for months. I can’t imagine how that felt.’ Harry sighed heavily and resumed his tale. Draco tried his best to stay calm enough to hear him out.
‘Ok? Just ok?’ Draco was so confused. He did believe Harry, the memory made it clear enough that Wood was practically unhinged. But what if he did something again? It would never have come to this if Harry had just told him and been honest.
‘Would I what?’
It was safe to say Draco’s world got a little bit crazy after his stay in that holding cell. Outwardly, it didn’t appear that anything had changed at all. There was no word from the Ministry about Potter, or his supposed involvement, although Draco had received no apology either, and he was just starting to relax about the situation a whole two months later.
‘You called the patients victims. Which means you think this was a planned attack?’
‘Of course.’ He said with a fake air of nonchalance before smirking at him. ‘Now, do you want to tap the bricks?’
‘Oh gosh I’m so sorry. Here.’ She helped him prop himself up on the pillows and handed him a glass of water, but his hands shook so badly he couldn’t lift it to his mouth to drink, so she had to take it back and help him. He coughed and spluttered when his throat was so dry he couldn’t swallow it properly. She smacked him on the back a little too hard.
‘Yes. I have an apartment ready for me whenever I’m done with this case.’ He straightened his tie unnecessarily. Pansy just stared at him open-mouthed. ‘What?’ He said, a little too defensively.
Draco tried his best to be present when they went to Kew Gardens. He was conflicted, however, both by the feelings the place now stirred up for him, and by the news Hermione had given them. He tried to put it out of his mind as much as possible as Teddy ran ahead of them – excited to see the plants and flowers. He and Harry walked at a more leisurely pace, hand in hand, and for the first time in a long time they looked like a happy family out on a day trip together. Harry had turned his collar up against the cold as he always did, and Draco was using a lot of will power not to think about how he looked every inch the head auror he used to be. This was a family trip after all.
“It’s because I’m not wearing make-up isn’t it?”
‘I see.’ Draco said. He winced as Harry took out the largest and most painful shard of glass.
‘Every couple of days or so. More often than not you weren’t very lucid, but you always seemed to know when he was here. Reached right for him every time. Oh, you two are perfect together. You must really love each other.’ Draco nodded, unable to explain how much he’d messed up. Harry had done him wrong though, hadn’t he? He’d slept with another man right under Draco’s nose. He couldn’t even figure out if it was cheating, or if he was just so angry that Harry had never told him. They hadn’t technically been back together, that’s true enough. Yet Harry hadn’t even said. It hurt his head to think about it.
“Not to me,” he said as she left the warmth of the conservatory for the jungle-style living room. It was too quiet for her to hear, or so he thought, except she hesitated for a fraction of a second before apparently ignoring him.
‘Fine.’ He detached himself from Harry enough to grab a piece of toast from the tray Spungen had placed next to the bed.
‘You treat me so well,’ he teased. Harry came to sit next to him, having popped the DVD into the drive.
She caught up with him when he was forced to pause and cling to the bannister for dear life. For a second he thought she was going to pause and wait for him to gather his strength, but instead she gripped his elbow firmly and marched him, quite roughly, into the very room Harry wanted to be far away from – the tapestry room.
“Tell me what you know.” Her tone was steady, but her accent was clipped.
‘Listen to us,’ Harry laughed, ‘sometimes I forget he’s not actually our kid.’ Draco froze.
‘HOOOOOOME!’ Teddy yelled at the top of his voice as he came charging through to the living room where Draco had been waiting. He was surprised by the volume, Teddy had always been relatively quiet. His hair was already white blond before he even entered the room which filled Draco with warmth.
The war had taken its toll on his mother, but the death of his father had really finished her off. She hadn’t been the same after they’d had the patronus telling them his father had been found dead in his cell in Azkaban. The Ministry made it sound like Lucius had taken his own life in shame, but Narcissa and Draco had known Lucius was far too proud a man to have died in such a way. It would have brought shame to the family, as if he hadn’t already brought enough of that. Still, they hadn’t been in a position to challenge the ruling at the time.
Orion looks at Harry over Draco’s shoulder once he’s finally got too tired and dropped the slipper on the floor. “We really should tell Robards that paperclips are the worst portkeys possible. How the heck was I supposed to see it anyway?”
He hadn’t forgotten what Harry had said. It had been difficult to keep on track with Teddy coming home and the orphanage being so busy. Draco had always liked to feel in control of everything and for months now everything had been spiralling around him while he held on for dear life.
“Draco Malfoy, you’re a veritable history buff!”
‘It’s nearly eight-thirty. Why?’ He put his tea down on the surface. ‘Time to go!’ He said with a smile. He’d had an idea of what he could do with his time which might also help with his recovery, but he needed some help from a friend to get things going.
‘How do you feel about a quick trip to Diagon?’ Teddy grinned.
‘He doesn’t understand because you never gave him the chance to. He’ll never prove you wrong if you don’t let him.’ Draco didn’t know. He trusted his mother more than anyone in the world but that didn’t mean she was always right. She’d made her own fair share of bad decisions. He didn’t understand why she was doing this. When he’d told his parents he was gay it had nearly started another war.
He untucked his head from where it was buried in the crook of Harry’s neck so that he could look at him while he slept. Harry’s eyelashes were so long it made Draco jealous. He had a few sparse freckles on his nose which Draco loved even though Harry hated them. It was times like these Draco remembered the scar. Most of the time he forgot about it, it was so much a part of Harry it never seemed that important to notice it. It was a lot paler than it had been during the war, as though the living link between Harry and its creator kept it from healing properly. Harry had told him all about the horcrux, and how he’d died, and it made Draco’s stomach churn to this day. He didn’t know what would have become of him if Harry had really died, especially since Harry had become his entire world in the aftermath of the war.
Sensing his hesitation to finish his story, Sirius chimed in, “Harry, whatever it is, you can tell us. We will support you whatever it is.” The earnest look in his godfather’s eye brought a lump to Harry’s throat. It was the kind of thing he imagined his parents might have said to him whenever he’d been worried or stressed.
November 1999
He couldn’t look at her. “That doesn’t matter. We’re doing this and we’re doing it today. Like we planned.” She watched him for a long while and he expected her to argue but she didn’t.
Time for what? What did that mean?
‘ada!’ Hugo squealed, pointing a chubby finger at Draco. Draco looked at Hermione.
‘Actually, I think I should head home. I have some stuff to do.’ He pulled away from Harry and stood up carefully.
Draco didn’t need telling twice. He sprinted in the opposite direction, rapidly firing as many spells as he could think of. It wasn’t until he’d made it halfway up the steps that he realised he had been using Potter’s wand. He took two wizards out as once my firing a stunning hex at the wall where it split in two. Up ahead he could see three more blocking his way out. Granger had already made it to the top and he was glad when she disappeared out of sight without looking back.
‘Well, if I can isolate the compound then I’ll be able to trace it should the aurors find any more potential sites, and it means that we should be able to reverse the effects on the patients currently stuck in St Mungo’s. I’m sure their loved ones miss them dearly.’ Draco kicked himself when he realised what he’d said. He was trying very hard not to give anything away when he was near Harry.
a favour getting me in today. You two are much better company. Try and pay me again and I’ll cast a rather nasty bat-bogey hex on you.’ Draco screwed his face up in disgust at that. No thank you.
“Say no more,” he interrupted, thinking better of it. “I want plausible deniability.” Granger smirked.
‘And have the Ministry be snooping around in our business too? It had too much personal stuff in it. The divorce, and parts of the case and everything I feel for you now and you’re such an intensely private person that I couldn’t bear the thought of your business being splashed across the papers. He’s been blackmailing me ever since. I didn’t want to tell you because you already had so much going on but that also meant that he knew I didn’t want to announce we were back together, so he kept making me go to events with him, imply that we were an item. I managed to get a few of the articles pulled but it didn’t always work. I’m sorry. Really, I am. Maybe I could’ve gone about things better but fuck… you know I’m bad at this.’
‘You know what? I think I am.’ He smiled at Harry over Teddy’s head.
‘Don’t stop.’ Draco whispered tiredly, and Harry obeyed. He was just zoning out thinking about the breakfast he’d bring Draco in bed in the morning when Draco lifted his head and kissed him.
‘Let’s not talk about that now. It’s the holidays! It’s time for fun! We even left the star off the tree for you…’ Harry pointed out of Draco’s view towards the tree. Teddy looked unconvinced but when he followed Harry’s arm gesture, his face split into a broad smile.
‘Yes, you do. Have you even slept with anyone since Harry?’ Draco shot her a death glare.
The air in the room smelled like jasmine and rose and something about the openness of the windows had something tense deep in Draco’s chest unravelling – like he hadn’t really known how to breathe properly all this time.
Six months ago
person who’s approaching this plan with any kind of rationality?” Pansy’s eyes were wide with disbelief and he hated to acknowledge that she had a point. He had been so focused on making amends and finding Potter that it hadn’t even occurred to him that there was any other way.
‘Nothing to worry about,’ he said casually. ‘Have I missed anything?’ Helen smiled and pulled her long blonde hair over her shoulder. It was much more of a honey blonde than Draco’s own, but whenever he took a minute to look at her appearance, a wave of insecurity washed over him.
“Potter, did no one tell you… well, using wandless magic on someone, it’s- it’s considered very intimate…” A gorgeous flush rose on her cheeks and Harry was stunned for a minute. He must have cast wandless magic on someone before. He’s never heard anything of the sort.
‘I apologise for dropping in on you like this, sir.’ Draco said formally. As the door to Kingsley’s office closed, all attempts at formality were dropped.
“Of course, how could I be so stupid,” He said sarcastically, shifting Aspen’s weight. He really needed to get out of bed and figure out what his next step was, but there wasn’t much he could do at four in the morning.
‘I haven’t been playing games! He has! He came to the house a few weeks later, one day when you’d gone for one of your lunch dates with Hermione. He said he was sorry for what he’d done, and I was so busy yelling at him for using me like that that I didn’t even notice when he swiped it. This is why you always helped me with publicity stuff, I’m crap at it!’
‘Thank you.’ Harry said to the elf who bowed graciously and disappeared again. He poured the tea and Draco was grateful since he knew his own hands shook too much. When Harry pressed a teacup into Draco’s cool fingers and took his seat, the silence couldn’t hold any longer.
‘What kind of project?’
Harry had done a beautiful job with the manor he’d bought at that auction. Draco had been hesitant at first, since he’d expected it to be just like Malfoy Manor. However, Harry deliberately had experienced interior designers team up with child psychologists to made the rooms as open and cheery as possible without being too false. The children loved it.
As Harry spoke, he couldn’t help but notice a slight tremor in Sirius’ hands. It added to his feeling that something was off. He had already checked that he hadn’t forgotten Sirius’ birthday, but that was definitely November.
‘It’s Potter, actually,’ he drew himself up to his full height, allowing himself to be amused when Wood’s jaw dropped, ‘and we should be going.’
‘Going somewhere?’ He asked she bushy hair sticking up from behind one of the boxes. Hermione’s head shot up in surprise.
‘Don’t be ridiculous. The present is what I’m putting in the vials.’ He figured he may as well make it look as pretty as he could, so he walked over to where there were some ornate, teardrop-shaped, crystal-cut vials engraved with intricate trees with curling branches. They were unlike anything Draco had ever seen, and that was saying something considering how much time he’d spent among potions. They were ridiculously expensive too – the set cost 150 galleons and whilst Draco could easily afford them, it blew his mind anything so fancy had made its way into the apothecary here. Perhaps in France it may have seemed more usual.
Thinking his hopefulness had triggered his imagination, Harry trudged dejectedly up the stairs to his and Draco’s bedroom. Harry hated getting into bed without Draco; it was far too cold and far too big, and he could never sleep properly without having Draco to hold onto or having Draco’s elbow in his back if they went to sleep mad at each other. Harry tried to avoid that, he never wanted to say goodnight with anything other than a whispered
‘Oh. No, he didn’t tell me any of that. He’s been so secretive lately. He keeps flaking out on our arrangements for the most pathetic reasons. Ron started bugging me to find out what was wrong, as if I don’t already have enough to do.’
‘As soon as I took it I started looking for other opportunities. It turns out whilst there are a lot of places are dying to have
‘I missed you too baby.’ The last thing Harry was aware of was Draco kissing the centre of his chest, and they fell asleep wrapped around each other.
“Don’t worry, I have no plans to die without your permission.” He tried to smile but he could tell it looked too forced. He kissed Pansy on both cheeks and gave her a hug, none of which she complained about, before dashing over to the fireplace and praying he wasn’t going to be late and mess up the whole plan.
Draco and his imagined Potter looped and twirled through the air, chasing an equally as untouchable snitch. This time Draco would get there first, of course. For a little while Draco allowed himself to think that one day maybe they really would come up here. That Potter would really want to spent time with him, that they would have fun, that they could be free. He had paid no attention to how long he had flown over trees and flowers and the small spring that curled through the south lawn, but eventually he tired. He didn’t get out much anymore.
‘Oh just sometimes? Always so giving with the compliments. Anyway, if you keep calling me Potter when we’re married you’ll just end up confusing everyone.’
“Did you get it?” He whispered when the door had barely closed behind him. The cupboard barely had enough space for both of them and contained nothing but a supply of self-correcting ink and a few bags of out of date owl treats. It was apparent the cupboard had long been forgotten. From inside her robes, Granger pulled a dark coloured wand. Draco vaguely recognised it, but he had never been this close to Potter’s wand before and it surprised him how ordinary it seemed.
“You mean… do whatever I want and sod the consequences?” The way Granger scrunched up her face in confusion made Draco laugh, which in turn made his head pound again. It was going to be a very long day.
‘I really am glad you two are patching it up,’ Ron told him, completely ignoring Draco’s question.
‘Where do you think he gets his intensity from?’ Harry smirked at him over his shoulder as he opened a cabinet on the far wall. A compromise. Harry had wanted a television in their bedroom and Draco thought that would be the beginning of the end. They got the television of course, Draco could never say no to Harry, but he made him install it so it could be hidden as much as possible. He could only stand there staring like an idiot.
‘No, no, it’s fine. There’s always plenty to do around here.’
what was he saying? She went by Tonks. Real family would’ve remembered that.
Harry strides over to the pile as Malfoy makes a circuit of the room, occasionally adding new books and taking some away. It will take them hours to sort through all of this, and surprisingly, that idea doesn’t bother Harry at all.
‘You know I’ve been going to a mind healer. You know I’m having trouble with my magic. You know all the medical stuff.’ He began. Harry nodded. ‘I didn’t want to take you to the mind healer with me. He’s been bugging me for months to bring you, so that we can talk to each other.’
Draco was up and dressed long before Harry the next morning. He had a lot to do. He made some bacon and toast for himself and left some for Harry under a cover Harry had left a permanent warming charm on, with a note telling him all was fine, and he’d see him later. He floo’d to the orphanage before the children were awake and helped with making their breakfast too. There was a decent team of staff in place, but it was still touch and go a lot of the time. They hadn’t wanted to get catering staff in and give the kids too much of a life of luxury, but as it happened a lot of them were still too young to be in a kitchen and they were yet to find an appropriate cook.
The door swung open slowly and cautiously, his godfather’s thin face appearing as if readying for attack. He paused when he saw Harry standing there – the colour drained from his cheeks making him look gaunt and ghost-like.
‘Bit tired. Although Teddy made it until ten before nearly exploding with the need to open presents, so I suppose I shouldn’t complain.’
The Grinch.
He was disrupted from his perusal of the file by a knock on his office door. It still felt a bit strange to have his own office, but it was a lot warmer up here and he wasn’t about to complain. Not with his circulatory issues.
