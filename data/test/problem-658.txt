Harry fought the urge to roll his eyes. “I’ve been lying to them and practically ignoring them for years now. I’ve made more effort to see my dealers than the two people who were with me during the most important parts of my life. I left their engagement party early to drink
Draco fought the smile that threatened to burst from his face and chastised himself – what was he, a third year? He distractedly watched Harry give the hostess his name and followed as she led them to their table. They sat down, and the hostess left.
Harry got an owl a week after they told him the news, inviting him and his plus-one (there was a neat little winky-face drawn next to this) over to the Burrow for an engagement party the Saturday after next. Harry wrote back immediately, confirming that he and his plus-one would be there.
“Yeah, it was useful.” The person closest to Harry said. Harry turned; he hadn’t realized anyone had sat down next to him. He was a black man, his hair cropped close to his skull. “I’m the same as Sam; I feel a lot more relaxed now.”
“I didn’t think you still had it,” mumbled Draco once they had parted. He was staring at his wand again. “Thank you, Harry. I can return my mother’s wand now.”
“I will, Potter,” Draco nodded. He wrapped up his éclair in a napkin and frowned at Potter apologetically. “But I do really have to go, I’m sorry.”
“Oh, hello, Harry!” she greeted brightly, and entered Ginny’s flat like it was the most natural thing in the world.
“I’m assuming you won’t tell me what’s upsetting him,” Draco said, trying to push the inappropriate thought away.
He stared at his reflection, fixating on everything that needed improvement. He was paying for overindulging yesterday. What was he thinking, eating at every meal Harry dragged him to? It was appalling just how much he’d had.
“If that’s all for now, I’ll take my leave, and someone will be back to check on you later tonight.”
Malfoy seemed to catch on and offered, “I’ll find out which slots she has available and let you decide based on that. Is that alright?”
Draco started walking without waiting for Potter, but sure enough, he heard the sound of footsteps behind him after a few moments. He took the both of them to the employee lounge; after unlocking and opening the door, he switched on the lights and allowed Potter passage. He watched as Potter walked inside, blinking blearily and looking around. Draco followed him in and shut the door behind him.
They ate and watched as the true story of a triple-murder unfolded before them, complete with second-rate reenactments and poorly done narration.
Draco did so. He looked around and saw little differences within the flat. More magnets on the fridge, a new calendar on the wall, and a new couch.
Stumbling tiredly out of his fireplace, he was surprised to meet the wide, yellow eyes of a strange owl through Draco’s living room window. Bemused, Draco went over to open the window and let the owl in. The owl hooted contemptuously as it hopped inside and stuck its leg out.
Something about Harry made him so nervous; he hated it but it also thrilled him – like he was young and innocent and free again. It was easier to focus and not worry when he was leading but now, Harry was in control. And he was looking at him.
“Just one thing, then,” Potter said quickly, and before Draco could object, he continued speaking, “I never actually apologized for the, er, what happened in Myrtle’s bathroom. I’m really sorry. I swear I didn’t know what the curse did, and if I did, I
"Harry!" she exclaimed, scandalized. “Merlin, I don’t even know what to say! Or ask. Ok…um…d’you actually know their name?”
“Touché,” conceded Harry. He grinned down at his glass before looking at Draco again. “Anyway, I’m – I’m glad. That my testimony helped. And that McGonagall helped you out too. I never knew that. But, I mean, I never even knew you’d become a Healer. I think Hermione mentioned once,
“He was nice,” Harry said after a moment. “And he told me…that he probably fancies me back. But he says nothing can happen cos I can’t start any new relationships for a year, apparently.”
“I’m certain you’ve heard the rumors. The myth,” Draco rolled his eyes, “That Potter has a Cloak of Invisibility. As in the one from
Was Ginny due for a visit today? Or Hermione or Ron? Would any of them let Harry leave earlier than he had planned? Would they trust him enough to not relapse immediately, especially in the state he was in? It was doubtful; none of them were complete idiots and Harry had fooled them for too long now and far too many times.
He hadn’t encountered many other students in the corridors as he made his way to the Owlery, but he kept his head down as he walked anyway. He couldn’t meet the eyes of those who hated him, those who were disgusted with him, those who ignored him. He didn’t want to force them to have to look at him. But by doing this, he’d almost missed Potter as he passed by.
Draco stared at his reflection with dead eyes, glowering as he focused on his swollen cheeks, the bags under his eyes, and his pale skin. It was nearly laughable just how similar this Draco was to the one of sixth year, in the midst of his mission.
"He's actually very decent," Ginny said, a delicate flush crossing her face, "And I happen to like him quite a bit. Just because you never got to know him-”
Once Potter had realized that Draco had caught him, however, he looked away so quickly that Draco was surprised he didn’t suffer any whiplash.
“It’s not the same,” Draco scowled, his irritation rising once more. He took his hand back. “You’re a good person, Potter. You didn’t just murder anyone, you murdered the person who was waging war on most of the world. You
They stared at him, and he stared back. Granger looked the same as ever, her defiant gaze on him unwavering. Her thick hair was pulled back from her face and she wore a thick Muggle jacket. Weasley stood next to her, arms crossed tightly, looking like some apprehensive bodyguard. His expression was full of suspicion as he stared at Draco, like he might attack them at any moment.
"Good morning, Master Harry," Kreacher said. "Young Master Malfoy has been asking for breakfast for both masters."
“Jesus, Draco,” Leonel said. He put the paperweight down. “Forgive me for caring about your health.”
"Back to Malfoy, now, are we?" Draco drawled, a hint of interest in his voice. It reminded Harry painfully of Hogwarts.
“I never asked for this. And besides, it’s a bloody stupid thing to be famous for, not dying when you were a baby, and then killing your dead parents’ murderer.”
“And they’re all over the place,” Harry continued. “They could be part of a bigger organization that supports some general cause, or they could be part of hospitals. Oh, and there’s Muggle hospitals that just help Muggles with mental illnesses.”
“That’s good, Abigail,” Kathy said, nodding. “How has your sleep schedule been? I know it can be irregular at times.”
“She mentioned going on a date about a month ago,” Hermione explained, “And she’s got a bit of a glow now.”
“It’s not pity, it’s – anger,” Draco said tensely. “I’m angry that they did that to you, that they made you feel that way about yourself-“
“Harry, please just give him a chance. From what I’ve heard, he’s an excellent Healer and very committed to helping you. This whole department is.”
He woke up again sometime later, Harry blinking into consciousness after being roused by the cracks of light shining through the curtains. He patted his bedside for his wristwatch, and was surprised to see that it read 12.30. Of course, he’d neglected to check the time when he’d first wakened, but 12.30 was still rather impressive for him.
“If this goes badly,” Draco’s voice was hushed and his face was guarded, but he stepped closer, “I’m blaming myself.”
The students who had been around during some part of their first six years knew of the aggressive history between them. The students who hadn’t had heard of them regardless – after all, who in this wide world didn’t know Harry Potter? And while Draco was much less well-known, he did gain some notoriety during the trials, adding to his previous reputation as a wealthy Pureblood.
Then tentatively, Harry slid Draco's sleeve up, exposing the marked forearm. He glanced up, and Draco nodded tensely.
He hoped Hermione and Ron would come and visit today. It'd been a few days since their last visit, and he thought it likely since it was the weekend. He could talk to them. Hermione would provide him with logic and Ron blunt friendship.
“You can’t just decide these things on your own,” Harry exclaimed, throwing his hands in the air. “We’re a
Perhaps it was the coffee jumpstarting his nerves, but Draco slipped off his chair and made his way to the bedroom, his heart pattering a distracting beat high in his chest.
“I mean I was definitely shocked when I woke up to Malfoy,” Harry admitted, “But it was fine after the first few days. We actually got on, mad as it is to say it…”
Before Harry could respond, Draco said, “Merlin, is this how you all really talk? I’m surprised you all weren’t sorted into Hufflepuff.”
She nodded and walked to the door. Her hand on the knob, she stopped and turned to look back at him.
Draco moved in to kiss him as he didn’t have the words to express how he felt. Harry kissed back, cupping Draco’s face with his free hand. Draco moaned into the kiss; the feel of Harry’s warm body against his own made his cock harden, bringing back memories of last night.
“I thought Hermione was having a laugh when she told me,” Ron added, taking Hermione’s hand. He looked at Harry, a serious expression on his face. “Mate…if you’re happy, then I support you. And come to think of it…you do look a lot better. Even compared to two months ago.”
Draco raised an eyebrow, and to Harry’s relief, Hermione laughed. Ron, still flustered, put an arm around Hermione. Draco smirked, clearly pleased with himself.
Draco’s face had turned a bit pink at that comment, and then he leant forward to kiss Harry. They snogged open-mouthed and hungrily, their breaths heavy and frantic. Harry wrapped his arms around the other man and pulled him in even closer – if it were even possible – and Draco’s hand found Harry’s cock once more and began stroking it with a newfound energy. Harry bit Draco’s bottom lip and pulled, a moan caught in his throat.
Harry nodded again and looked down at the parchment. Written neatly was indeed Wolff’s and Malfoy’s names and the addresses of their workplace. Below that were the names of four Mind Healers in the area and their own work addresses. He thanked Malfoy, folded the parchment into a square, and stuffed it into his pocket.
Slughorn chuckled. “Well, either way, excellent job as always! Five points to both Gryffindor and Slytherin.”
Granger face was screwed up and Draco was afraid that she’d start screaming or crying or both – and then it smoothed out into something very neutral (Draco was admittedly impressed). Weasley put his arm around her shoulders, and spoke instead.
, for Salazar’s sake, and Leonel was no longer his. But no matter how hard he tried to focus on other things, the image of Potter staring at him tenderly floated to the forefront of his mind. It was just his luck that the one dream he wanted to forget insisted on staying, refusing to fade away like they usually did.
"She misses you, you know. Mum," Ron said quietly. He wasn't meeting Harry's eyes. "They all do, back home."
Hermione was looking at him from across the coffee table. Harry didn’t have to ask her to clarify what “it” was. He knew what she was talking about, and that she was using her casual voice, the one she used when she tried to keep her curiosity under wraps. Ron’s attention turned to Harry as well, though his curiosity was much more obvious, all wide eyes and slowed chewing.
“I think you know what kind,” Malfoy said, actually sounding a bit sorry, “And I wouldn’t be asking if I really didn’t need to know in order to treat you.”
“I’m very happy to hear that, but it’s early days yet,” Draco replied calmly. At Potter’s sour look, he sighed. “At any rate, you’re not letting me finish. I feel badly about how it all went down at Mungo’s, and I want to apologize. So I’m sorry for goading you into revealing something you could’ve kept secret from me. I shouldn’t have pushed you, even though I really
POLL: should the next chapter basically pick up where this one left off or should I do a time-skip? Please lemme know what you think because I'm torn!
The tension in Harry’s face and body diffused; his eyes widened slightly. He finally put his quill down.
was too much for Potter; if Draco was the cause of a relapse, he didn’t know if he could ever forgive himself.
“No, fuck you, Malfoy,” Potter growled. He backed up and stalked away, facing the window with his arms crossed. “Get out.”
“I didn’t realize you were so sentimental,” Draco said to Ron, and Harry turned to look at him, pleasantly surprised. Draco was smiling a bit, seeming more relaxed. “Congratulations. I know it can’t mean much from me but really – like Harry said…it’s a good match.”
Draco cursed under his breath, releasing the bottom edge of his shirt and walking to the front of his closet. He unbuttoned the shirt and let it drop to the ground before grabbing his pajamas and putting them on. They were looser on his body and allowed him the peace of mind that his school uniform couldn’t afford him.
Draco put his head in his hands, wondering if his headache was due to excessive caffeine or all the agonizing.
Conversation flowed easily between them, going from work to hobbies to heated debates between English and American things and back to work. Draco had always liked going out with his coworkers because it allowed him to see a different side of them. You could never know someone purely from their work persona. Ever since he’d first been invited out by Ira, he’d been amused by what he could learn when his coworkers had gotten a bit of alcohol in them.
“No, I’m glad you did,” Draco said conversationally, even though his nose was just a centimeter away from Harry’s. Harry shivered from their closeness and didn't know where to look. “I don’t know how I’d explain waking up to Harry Potter’s corpse.”
thought Draco as he stared down at the frankly appalling amount of food laid out on the table. And Salazar, he
This habit of sitting out by the lake before sunrise began his first month back. He had always been a light sleeper, but over the past few months, he found himself waking over the smallest noises. Usually, though, it was the nightmares that woke him.
“Maybe a year?” Weasley said uncertainly. “But that was before it got really bad. He could hardly get out of bed some days. And then Harry just stopped coming to work. Hermione and I went over to his flat, and he just said he was tired. It was halfway reasonable. I mean, I quit a few months later to work at my brother’s store.”
“I don’t know anything about him. Betty’s told me about herself and she talks to me about things other than…all this,” Potter explained, gesturing vaguely around himself. “But, er, Estrada is just work-oriented. He’s sort of just mysterious.”
Potter ignored this and stepped closer. Draco turned back around and met his gaze - the real one. He was slowly coming back to earth, and he wasn't happy.
feel more comfortable around him if he knew something about the bloke other than the fact that he was American and unrealistically fit.
“Oh,” said Draco. So he was right. Harry was second-guessing his friendship with Draco. Why had he even told him? It wasn’t enough for Harry to know that Draco was an ex-Death Eater or that he liked to make himself throw up, he also had to tell him he was fucking gay. “Fourteen. When I really knew.”
“She’s just being protective. It’s fine, Draco,” he said reassuringly, putting a hand on Draco’s arm.
Harry opened his eyes and hurriedly undid the zipper of Malfoy’s trousers; he was delighted to see Malfoy’s cock spring forward, just as hard as Harry’s. It was long, though not as wide as his own, and surrounded by white blond curls.
Where he expected to see the Dark Mark was instead a somehow delicate piece of art all in black and greys. Trees sprouted from a graceful transition of unmarked skin to a forest floor. The trees were of various heights and widths, all beautiful and elegant. In the middle of them all was the Dark Mark – it was faded compared to the fresh ink, but somehow, that made it even better. The branches and leaves seemed to move along the skull and snake, making it both the focal point and the background at once.
“Perfect,” Draco said, scowling at his feet. “That’s just what I needed, to be even further indebted to you.”
“Well…yes, it’s not the prettiest or most clear-cut situation, but it’s not the end of the world, Draco,” Ira said.
Draco and Betty watched as Leo gathered his things and put on his travelling cloak. He waved them goodbye and went out the door, leaving the two of them alone. Draco turned to Betty and clasped his hands together. He began without preamble.
“Draco,” said Harry, and when Draco turned to face him, he leaned in to kiss Draco gently. When they parted, Harry looked intently at Draco, their faces barely an inch apart and foreheads pressed together. Draco could feel Harry’s breath on his face. “I trust you too.”
Draco was mad now. Potter’s surprise interrogation had sent him spiraling back to earth, back to reality.
Harry was sat on Johnny's couch, having been waiting for him to return from his dealer. Johnny had just come back a few moments earlier, shrugging off his heavy jacket and joining Harry on the couch.
He wished he could get rid of it. He’d curse it off, if he had to. Draco kept it covered at all times; even
“You look good,” she said finally, releasing his wrist. Her lips quirked into a smile as she met his gaze. “I’d bet a galleon that you never tried this hard when we were dating.”
Ira waved a hand dismissively. "You know I love gossip, Draco. And you already know most of this is going to Betty."
It was a sign of Ginny’s dedication to Harry that she had dropped everything and arrived at St. Mungo’s at a moment’s notice just because Harry had needed her. She was in his hospital room only two minutes later, breathless as she rushed inside, her red hair flying behind her.
He brought his hands up to his mouth as soon as the words were out. They felt strange in his mouth, like they didn't belong, like they were wrong. But there was nothing he could do now. Draco gave a shuddering sigh and watched for Potter’s reaction.
“Good afternoon, Healer Malfoy,” said Leonel, glancing up briefly at him and Betty before focusing once again on the patient. “I’ve just administered a basic antidote until we figure out for sure what caused it. I also cast a stabilizing charm on him earlier so his condition doesn’t get worse.”
"Oh, get over it, Malfoy," Harry huffed. "I'm not fragile. If I said it's fine, then it's fine. I almost prefer you mean. My arse still stings, by the way."
Draco took a deep breath before turning to Weasley, who was staring at them with displeasure. Granger stood in the same place as before, that inscrutable expression still on her face.
He trailed off as a waitress approached them. After she’d introduced herself and taken their drink orders (water for Harry, decaffeinated coffee for Draco), she left and they were alone once again.
Harry nodded, his eyes moving across the room. He honestly couldn’t agree nor disagree with Samuel’s statement; he didn’t know them well enough to have formed a fair opinion. Even Malfoy, Harry thought as his eyes rested on him, was a complete mystery to him all over again.
“It…” Harry trailed off without having said anything. There had to be a line somewhere, right? His face warmed as he said as firmly as he could, “I’d rather not say.”
She sounded relaxed, and when Draco glanced over at her, she looked it too. It was another way in which she was so different from Pansy; the latter would have tensed and gone into defense mode immediately.
“Oh. Er, well, if you’re staying here, I was thinking I’d stay as well,” Harry said with a small smile. “But if not, I’d go to the Burrow. The Weasley’s.”
In fact, Harry hadn’t brought it up after Draco had told him the truth. He kept fearing there would be some sort of delayed reaction from Harry that wasn’t so positive. He relaxed only when it became clear Harry was acting just as he had before and he wasn’t treating Draco any differently.
“I’m sorry, Leo,” he said at once. “I swear to Salazar that I didn’t have feelings for Potter when we were dating. I hadn’t even seen him in – what, five years? It’s really just that I had a big, pathetic crush on him when we were in school and I’d just repressed it after the War. Well, until –“
"It's likely. I blacked out," Harry admitted reluctantly. He chewed on his lip. "That's usually how it goes."
“Now that you mention it, we didn’t get to fuck yesterday,” Harry murmured and sucked on Draco’s soft skin.
“Alright, alright,” Draco said, removing his hand, a smirk playing at his lips. “I’m just trying to help those less fortunate than I.”
“I can’t risk it. And at any rate, it would be a waste of everyone’s time. Pomfrey can’t do anything about it;” –
“It’s his loss,” Daphne rolled her eyes. “And I don’t really see it lasting long anyway. You couldn’t pay me to consort with a Gryffindor.”
“I liked it too,” a white woman agreed, nodding. Her mousy brown hair had streaks of grey in it, and there were tired bags underneath her eyes. “I’ll have to remember it so I can use it at home.”
Of course, despite this newfound friendship, Draco was in no way cured. He knew depression didn’t work like that; he couldn’t be fixed through simple companionship.
Harry tried to think of other symptoms he might be experiencing, but those were the only three he could come up with. Well, aside from having a conversation with a business card, but Estrada didn't need to know that.
Malfoy raised his eyebrows, likely unconvinced by Harry’s weak attempt at an insult. Harry's face burned.
Harry pondered this for a moment before catching the attention of the bartender. He told him what he wanted, trying to keep eye contact with the tall man with perfect teeth, then turned back to Malfoy.
“We’re going to do this three more times. Right. Inhale. One…two…three…four. Hold it…one…two…three…four…five…six…seven. And exhale. One…two…three…four…five…six…seven…eight.”
“This too,” Draco said, and Harry sat up to pull his sweater off, throwing it into some corner of his room.
“It’s ok, Draco, I believe you,” Leo said earnestly. He studied him for a moment, and then said, “Is he why you don’t want to get back together?”
be good to see him; it’d set Draco’s mind at ease to see him be well, and they’d finally get some closure on their…whatever it was.
"I'm going to need you to stop talking," Draco said, not answering the question and instead kissing Harry hard, slipping his tongue inside Harry’s mouth.
Potter was alert, wide-eyed and his forehead damp with sweat as he stared at Draco from where he stood in the center of the room.
“Shush it, you,” Cait said, thwacking Damien’s arm lightly, though she didn’t seem upset about it – the opposite, in fact. She turned back to Harry. “S’all right. No judgement here. I wanna kill myself too sometimes. Have too much coke sometimes. Mentally unstable at all times.”
“Well, Kathy’s the facilitator of group, not you,” said Malfoy before Harry could reply, “So I’m afraid I won’t be following your advice.”
“Er – why?” Harry managed to get out before Draco fixed his grey eyes on him, silencing him immediately. It was like he was back in that bathroom, being stared at by those intoxicating eyes with the smell of sex sharp in the air. He could almost hear Bowie in the background.
“Sam, man of the hour,” Damien said. “What do you say about all of us going out for drinks afterwards to celebrate?”
Fury and shame rose up in Draco. Why was he hiding on the floor of a loo? He stood shakily and unlocked the door, banging it open with more force than necessary. Potter stood there, much like the way he stood on that first night.
Draco paused, continuing to stare neutrally at Potter. He felt disgusting for even thinking it, but Potter was somehow still attractive at his worst. The eyes were the same – bright green and intense. His hair was longer, and now that it was washed, Draco could see that it was starting to curl towards the ends. And the facial hair…suffice to say, it suited him.
“I see,” Wolff was nodding. “You don’t need to feel badly about it, Harry. It’s quite normal that you find yourself with too much time on your hands now, given that much of your time before was likely spent using or buying.”
He pushed Harry’s legs apart with firm hands, exposing his hole. Normally, Harry would’ve been self-conscious in such a vulnerable position but right now he was just filled with a desperate need to, well, be filled.
It was fascinating seeing them together. Malfoy’s curt, quiet mannerisms and refined dress; his pointy face and grey eyes looking down at the young woman who walked beside him. Cait’s trendy outfit, her discreetly colored hair, loud voice, and that sly smile.
“They didn’t care when we started sitting next to each other, or when I started calling you Draco,” Harry said.
“Merlin, this isn’t going to work.” Ginny sighed as if Harry's uncharacteristic thanks was the breaking point. She turned to Zabini. “Sorry, I think you’ll have to leave.”
“Interesting,” murmured Draco. He looked up at Leonel, who was now watching him. “What do they do at the Ministry?”
“Merlin, I’m an idiot,” he said for the third time in the same amount of minutes. “I don’t know why I never returned it earlier, I just completely forgot about it. Draco, I’m sorry.”
“But no, I didn’t know Harry’s relationship with Draco had progressed,” Luna told Ginny as she intertwined her fingers with Ginny’s. Harry looked away – he never thought hand-holding could be so intimate or gentle. “He looks happier, doesn’t he?”
“But I have.” Harry’s voice was muffled. “So many people are dead, and they’d all be alive if it weren’t for me. I should – I should be dead too.”
They both took off their lime Healers robes, leaving them hanging on Ira’s standing coat rack, exited St. Mungo’s, and walked the short distance to a homey Muggle café. After ordering sandwiches, the two of them sat down at a corner table. A waitress brought their food and drinks over a few minutes later, and when they’d both had a few bites of food, Draco decided to start.
“I know what I want. For the first time in ages, I know what I want,” Harry said firmly, “And it’s you. You make me feel alive
Harry blinked, remembered where he was, and groaned. He was fucking dreaming about drugs now, and if that wasn't a sign of how pathetic he'd become, he didn't know what was. It had seemed so real and the want was overwhelming for Harry, manifesting in his chest and teasing him with something he couldn't have, something he so desperately wanted.
“I think this line of work requires the presence of relaxing tea,” Draco said. He glanced at him again. “You can sit down, Potter.”
Draco smirked, his grey eyes flitting over to Harry and chest still rising and falling with effort. “I’m glad you liked it. I should’ve asked first, but I just couldn’t resist –“
It'd been a long while since he'd gone over to any bloke's flat, and he was admittedly nervous. Draco checked his wristwatch - it was already 7:50. Draco had fallen asleep quickly after coming home, getting a good four and a half hours in. When he’d woken up, Leonel’s owl was watching Draco from his bedside table, irritated at having to wait so long. Draco had jumped to take the letter off its leg and read it quickly, having already expected Leo to contact him.
“I don’t know,” Harry said, looking up. His face was unusually expressionless; it sent a chill down Draco’s spine. “I’ll find you. Tonight.”
Smiling, Draco undid the buttons and pulled the trousers off, Harry raising his hips to make them come off easier. Bright red boxers greeted him.
Harry walked past Draco with purpose; he nodded at each of the three Weasleys in turn as they went past. He followed Granger, and then the five of them were stood in Draco and Harry’s new bedroom, admiring the newly-built bed.
“I want to say sorry, Malfoy,” Potter finally said when the silence had become suffocating. Draco's eyes widened. “For being such an arse when I first came in. It's obvious that you've changed and I...understand now.”
“It really is complicated, Sam,” Harry said. He ran a hand through his hair. It’d be so much easier if he could talk freely about magic with Muggles but he knew that could be disastrous in so many ways. “We went to school together, this private school in Scotland, and we were er, rivals, I guess.”
Harry slid his fingers through Draco’s under the table and beamed at the three most important people in his life.
Draco staggered back to his bed and nearly cried. He knew he'd overdone it last night. He'd been purging less since his tentative friendship with Potter had started and to go back full force after all this time had clearly taken a toll on his body.
“No, Harry,” Wolff said. “I take patient confidentiality very seriously and I will only repeat what you’ve said if you are intending to hurt yourself or someone else.”
“I’d rather just stay here, wouldn’t you?” Harry asked with a devilish smirk. His hand trailed down Draco’s shirt. “Finally get you out of these clothes…”
Harry glanced at his friends; they were looking at him in the way he imagined worried parents would.
He stepped away from the sink as Ginny leaned over it and opened said cabinet. A couple of Muggle prescription bottles greeted them, some lined up and a few knocked over. The contents of only a few of them matched their labels; the generic versions of Xanax and Valium. Others held a variation of bud, and one coke. Ginny scooped them up and inspected each closely.
Putting on her best Malfoy impression, Ginny read the letter aloud. Harry begrudgingly noted that her impersonation was really quite good, but he didn’t say so; he simply took the letter back from her. Ginny looked at him, brown eyes glittering.
“You did, didn’t you?” Ginny asked, her voice cracking a bit. “You fucking used, didn’t you, Harry?”
Draco snapped his head up and immediately regretted it, his head aching with a newfound vengeance and his vision swirling. He blinked at the figure approaching him and could make out…of course.
Harry and Samuel watched him walk away, and Samuel turned to Harry, his eyebrows even higher up on his forehead.
He looked over at the circle of plastic chairs that dominated the room. There was a small section of them that wasn’t occupied by anyone; Harry walked over and sat in one.
Draco felt a shiver run down his spine at Harry’s low, husky voice and glanced away, fearing Harry would be able to see the flush on his cheeks.
Harry woke up at a quarter past six. He had had a regular dream, or so it seemed, and woke naturally. No sweating, no shouting, no crying.
The last few words choked Harry’s throat as they came out, and then he felt like he may cry as well.
Draco,” Harry said, sidling up next to him to look at them both in the mirror. He smiled at their reflections – himself, looking happy and
“Jesus,” interrupted Harry impatiently. “Aren’t you tired of this? The same argument, over and over again? It’s been a year. I’m clean. I haven’t used since – since that day, and even though some days are fucking hell, I’m not planning on using again. I’m not fragile, Draco. I’m not about to break.”
Draco couldn’t even revel in the fact that Potter had broken his own rules and called him ‘Draco.’ He was barely listening to Potter. He couldn’t, not with his heart hammering in his chest and his stomach rolling.
“Oh, of course, dear,” Molly smiled. “I understand you’ve become quite important to Harry, and I must say, he
“And when I finally did,” Harry continued, “I couldn’t stop wondering what if would have been like if I’d had a ‘normal’ life. Would I have found out earlier? I mean, I didn’t know something...so significant about myself until now – it took me eighteen years. Although I didn’t even know I was a wizard until I was eleven, so maybe it’s pretty in-line with my life so far...”
Draco woke the next morning with his face pressed against his notes. He sat up slowly, back aching terribly from having spent the night hunched over his desk.
Across the room, Potter looked comfortable, surrounded by the ever-present Weasley and Granger. He didn’t seem perturbed. Of course, he had no reason to be. He was on the right side of the war all along. He wasn’t part of a previously feared family that had lost nearly everything after the war. His skin wasn’t marred by the barely-faded mark that branded him as the enemy. He wasn’t a fucking Death Eater. He was the Chosen One, savior of the wizarding world. He was good and pure, and Draco was dirt.
“Yes, a year of absolutely no contact. And then one dinner and suddenly a relationship? I want to do this right, Harry.”
Startled back to the present and faced again with the now properly-buttoned Malfoy, Harry cleared his throat and told him no.
Harry regained his composure and glared at Draco. “No, maybe not. But I can tell Madam Pomfrey. Or your mother.”
spend the night together, so why should they? I think it’s because it’s you. They still don’t trust you. I mean, if it was Ginny, they’d just be happy to know it was going fine and leave us alone.”
When he walked back into the eighth-year common room, Draco returned to Pansy and Blaise. They were sat in the corner of the room, lounging and speaking to each other with their books opened in front of them.
“You’ll have to explain it to him,” said Draco. “His knowledge of anything outside of the ‘normal’ orientations is limited.”
“Draco, that’s all you did for six years,” she said, rolling her eyes. “But really. I’m happy for you. You look better.”
No, not awful. There wasn’t a word good enough to encapsulate just how terrible he felt. His entire body hurt as if he’d been run over by a hoard of hippogriffs, even though he hadn’t done anything out of the ordinary yesterday. His mind felt heavy, bogged down, already worn out even though he’d barely started his day.
He shrugged his coat off as he approached Potter and Ginevra, who were sat side-by-side in a booth. They were deep in conversation, the drinks in front of them forgotten, and didn’t notice Draco until he’d cleared his throat. The two of them started and looked up. Ginevra greeted him with a smile that was a bit too mischievous for his liking and said, “Glad you could make it, Malfoy.”
it. The pear that Potter had tickled let out a disturbing giggle and turned into a door handle. Potter took hold of it and pulled down, and Draco gaped.
Hermione gave him a look that made him fall silent. He cleared his throat and decided to answer Ron's question instead.
“Neither am I,” Harry repeated, though his voice was much huskier than it had been. He licked his lips and swallowed, Draco watched his Adam’s apple move as he did so. “God, Draco, you don’t know how much I want you. It’s driving me mental.”
“Good evening, gentlemen. Have you ever dined with us before?” Harry shook his head, and Malfoy nodded. “Lovely. My name is Natasha, and I’ll be your server tonight. Could I start you two off with something to drink?”
He wanted to yell at her, tell her to get him out immediately, but they both knew that Harry had a hard time saying no to Ginny.
Pansy opened her mouth but shut it without saying anything, an angry expression on her face. She huffed and turned away to stare down the rows of books, avoiding Draco’s gaze.
This didn’t seem to comfort Harry. He tapped the quill against the table, his eyes glazed over as he looked down at it.
He rolled his eyes. “Yeah, but that doesn’t mean I know where it is. I don’t even know when the last time I saw it was.”
He nearly dived into Ginny, who wrapped her arms around him without hesitation. He clung to Ginny’s warm body and sobbed like he’d never done before, the tears flowing freely for the first time in ages. And Ginny just held onto him like she’d never let him go.
“What are you doing here at this time of night?” Draco asked, remembering their first conversation at this same spot.
“Merlin, you’re gorgeous,” Harry said approvingly, his eyes raking over Draco. His hands were still on Draco’s hips, steady and warm. “As mental as it sounds, I missed you.”
“Yeah, sure,” Harry said. “Though I hope you’ll tell them in person soon. It’s been a while since anyone’s seen you. Ginny and Zabini are back, you know.”
“The blond bloke?” he asked once he’d turned back around. Harry nodded. Samuel frowned. “Name’s Draco. Haven’t talked to him much, to be honest, but he’s been here almost as long as I have. Kind of quiet. Keeps to himself. Why?”
He had turned to look at Draco; his pupils were dilated and his lips were swollen. Draco felt elation rush through him despite the aching in his trousers.
“I know what I’ve been missing now. Even little things, like fresh air, or being able to think without puking or sweating or my heartbeat going so fast I can feel it throughout my entire body. But I’ve also been missing you. You and Ron and Hermione and everyone else. I’ve been missing your lives and it was so bloody selfish of me, but I want to be here for it now. It finally makes sense. I want to be the friend you all deserve.”
“Not that it’s any of your business-“ Draco began to say as Pansy shot Blaise a look, “But, well, actually, it’s none of your business.”
Draco almost laughed at that – he never realized that Ginevra and Potter were on such similar trains of thought. Maybe that’s why they had dated for however many years it was.
“Well, either way,” Pansy said, who was not entirely satisfied by the look of her face, “I’m glad you enjoyed yourself. You deserve some fun.”
Draco shot him a dirty look but complied, slinking to the couch as Harry pushed the tape into the VCR determinedly. Once he pressed the ‘rewind’ button, Harry grabbed the remote before joining Draco on the couch, nearly jumping onto the cushion next to him. Draco glared at him again, and Harry grinned, unable to help himself.
Draco had reached his door. He turned to face Potter, his back to the door. Potter stood a few steps below him, arms crossed and face stubborn.
Draco just about melted in Harry’s arms. It was almost pathetic (and really quite scary) that Harry could still make him feel like this, even after two and a half years.
in the direction of the door – no use in scaring the other patients and guests. Even Leonel looked frightened, though he was trying, unsuccessfully, to hide it from Draco.
“Mr. Potter, I’ve brought you your dinner,” she was saying happily until she caught the look on Harry’s face. The girl was really an open book, Harry noted distractedly, seeing her concern clear as day as she put the tray down on his nightstand and hurriedly walked over to him. “Are you alright? What’s happened?”
There was a pink glow high on Draco’s cheekbones, and Harry felt his own face burn with embarrassment and pleasure.
Harry rubbed at his eyes. Draco smoothed away the hair from Harry’s damp forehead, his chest tight with anxiety.
Harry simply moaned, clearly still asleep. Draco moved closer, unsure of what to do. Hesitantly, he put a hand on Harry’s arm – it was damp with sweat. He shook him.
“Well,” Malfoy said, straightening his back as he did, “It turns out that I’m not as big-headed and self-important as some and don’t feel the need to overshare.”
“Me neither,” Leonel confessed. He turned down the volume before swiveling in his seat to face Draco. “Do we have to know now? We could always figure it out later.”
He’d locked himself in, of course. This was a sanctuary. A disgusting, lowly sanctuary but a sanctuary nonetheless.
As if on cue, Betty walked into the room, followed by a slightly frantic Granger and Weasley. Betty stepped aside as the couple approached Potter’s bedside. The worry was obvious in their faces, and Draco felt another twist in his stomach. He’d seen them quite a bit in recent times, especially since Blaise and Ginevra had started dating.
Draco set the glass down and gasped for air, trying to recall last night’s events as he did so. They came back to him slowly, the gaps filling themselves in. He’d gotten far drunker than he would’ve liked, thrown up in front of Potter, and then the idiot had told Draco that he’d died.
mentally ill – Draco took it all in stride and comforted Harry without being patronizing, something that merited an award in Harry’s humble opinion.
Draco’s heart was racing. Was it acceptable for him to see Harry again so soon? And Merlin, his flat was a mess. He’d have to clean up if Harry was coming over. Oh, what was he thinking? This was ridiculous. Harry was ridiculous.
Draco decided that he would appeal to Granger and Weasley first and see if they could convince Potter to stay longer. If that failed, he’d go to Scarlett.
Malfoy stared at him for a bit longer before sticking a hand in his robes and pulling out a plain, overstuffed file folder – his files. Harry looked at them with curiosity, wondering what sort of information Malfoy had on him. It was a bit unsettling, to be honest, to know that such a gigantic prat had that much power over him.
They went back to Harry’s room, whisky in tow, and Draco tried to push his nervous thoughts away. He kept thinking what had happened the last time they’d gotten drunk together. He had laid his head down in Harry’s lap, for Salazar’s sake. He still wanted to die from embarrassment whenever he thought about it, but then he’d remember that Harry had played with Draco’s hair and then it wasn’t so bad.
, damn the trials and how highly publicized they were, damn the Dark Lord, and most of all, damn himself.
“Harry, are you sure you don’t want to stay a bit longer? I feel like you’ll be able to overcome this much easier if you stayed here,” she said in her suggesting-not-demanding voice.
“Of course not,” Draco said sharply. He heard Potter suck in a breath and saw his jaw clench, which was interesting. Still watching Potter, he added slowly, “Though I find that talking about it to
know each other, but I reckon we – my point is, would you like to? Get to know each other properly, I mean,” Potter said hurriedly. He flashed a nervous smile. “Because I would.”
“But if that’s true,” said Harry as something occurred to him, “Why are they doing the cleansing thing?”
“No, I should go,” said Draco, glancing up at Harry as he pulled on his shirt. “I don’t think I can sleep anymore anyway, and soon the rest will be waking up…you need your rest.”
Harry grinned in victory. Draco smiled back at him and belatedly realized that he was already feeling the drink. Perks of not eating, he supposed.
Harry Potter. Even after eight years, it all comes back to him. Draco didn’t even know why he spent so much time dwelling on the prat. It’s not like he was even thankful, or nice…
He’d heard about Harry’s nightmares years before - many students had, but it was one thing to hear about them, and another entirely to be present while he was having one. Harry had mentioned before that he had trouble sleeping, but Draco had no idea it was this severe. He himself had his fair share of nightmares, but this seemed different.
After Scrivenshaft’s, they decided to go to see the Shrieking Shack. It was just as Draco had remembered, or perhaps even more dilapidated than it had been.
“Like something bad is going to happen, or did happen. Y’know when your chest is all tight and it actually hurts? Like that.”
“I know it’s not worth it. I’d take it back if I could. I’d take it all back,” Harry said, his throat thick. “I never would’ve started – started any of this if I knew where it’d take me.”
She didn't look convinced but waved him away. "I'll speak with you soon, Draco. If you’d ever like to make an appointment –"
“Even better,” Potter laughed. “You’ll get to see how much you’ve grown, and Hermione might feel better.”
“Don’t,” Draco said, scrambling for the right words. “Don’t feel bad about it. There’s no reason to. Harry, I’m…I know you said you didn’t want to talk about it, and that I shouldn’t treat you differently, but I’m worried.”
Johnny let out a breathless laugh as he set to work, tipping a small amount of the powder onto his coffee table. He swiped his ID from the corner of the table and began cutting it into neat lines.
“Oh,” Harry said. He hadn’t even thought of that. “Yeah, I s’pose that would work. Do you know where it is?”
“Cait’s coming as well,” Damien said. At Harry’s confused look, he caught the attention of a thin white woman with blunt bangs. Harry thought he’d seen her speaking to Samuel before. “Oi, Cait!”
Draco looked down at himself, surprised, and realized belatedly that he indeed was not wearing his Healers robes - only the white-button up and trousers he usually wore underneath them. He'd forgotten to put them back on after returning from lunch. Why did no one else tell him?
He obeyed wordlessly, bracing himself on Harry’s shoulders and pushing aggressively into Harry. Harry cried out and squeezed his eyes shut, lost in pleasure. His entire body trembled as Draco continued thrusting inside him, feeling more light-headed than he’d ever been.
“Yes, I know that,” Draco said, looking as though he was trying not to roll his eyes. “I was just making sure that it’s all right that I did – you already had two pints at dinner.”
“Mr. Weasley and Miss Granger,” Mitchell said kindly, stepping forward a bit. “I’d just like to assure you that we’ll treat Mr. Potter to the very best of our abilities. I oversee the Plant and Potions department, and I ensure it is only staffed by the very best. I am Scarlett Mitchell, and Healer Malfoy here is the head of the Strife Feirold Ward. Though it seems you may already be acquainted…?”
Draco’s head tilted as Potter shrugged. “As long as she’s safe and happy, she can do whatever she’d like.”
Harry would’ve liked to argue, but he didn’t think he had the ability to do so. He could barely speak as it was, too terrified that he would begin crying all over again, which was a mortifying thought.
Draco pushed open the door of the sixth floor bathroom and walked right in, knowing no one would be there, save for the possibility of Moaning Myrtle. He went over to one of the sinks and gripped the edges of it tightly, avoiding his reflection in the dirty mirror.
The meetings were held in a public library not far from Grimmauld Place. Going there by foot made for a nice walk, though it was a rather cool evening for September.
wasn’t too much trouble. I mean, I grew up with them telling me I was a waste of space and, well, they didn’t ask for me so I have to be grateful for what they did for me. And I am.”
“No,” he said, annoyed at himself. “No, I reckon I overestimated myself. I’m still too bloody anxious for that. I’ll try – later.”
He put the business card on his desk and set about Flooing home. He’d do it tomorrow. He sent a Patronus to Betty asking her to administer the nourishment potion to Potter and left.
Draco chose to ignore this. “So you really don’t care in the slightest that your ex-girlfriend just slinked away with a dirty Slytherin?”
“You didn’t,” Harry said quickly, putting his hands on Draco’s arms. Draco looked unconvinced. “If I didn’t want to talk about it, I wouldn’t have. I'm stubborn, remember?”
When Draco saw Potter next, it was in the Great Hall, ironically enough. He stiffened when they made eye contact, and when Potter didn’t look away after several moments, Draco looked down at his plate in embarrassment and defeat.
Draco considered. He really didn’t want to tempt himself, but he also needed the practice. He’d gotten weak, careless.
“Yeah, thank you,” Samuel said, smiling kindly at her. “I caught up on some schoolwork, saw my parents…it was productive.”
long, I’ve actually forgotten what it feels like to be happy. But Draco’s made me remember. I actually…want to live. I can picture myself alive in a few years. For once.”
“I think it would more than what’s left of both of our family’s wealth combined in Mind Healer bills to figure that one out.”
When Draco exited the bathroom, he couldn’t even pretend to be surprised to see Potter waiting outside. He self-consciously brushed his still-wet hair away from his face and headed over to the other man, sitting where he’d also sat that one morning.
Harry checked the clock that hung menacingly on the wall. Two minutes. Two minutes, and Malfoy would be here to escort him to his office and let him Floo to Wolff’s.
Malfoy looked up then, seeming to feel Harry’s presence (or maybe his gaze), and gave a small smile.
“I’ve waited longer,” Draco said, stopping to undo Harry’s shirt as quickly as he could with shaking hands.
Harry exhaled. One more week before he was released back into the world. Before he was released as a sober man with what felt like an impossible task: staying sober.
Hermione's arms were around him then, hugging him so tight he could hardly breathe. He hugged her back, holding onto her as his hands trembled and eyes filled with tears, relieved that the weight was finally off his shoulders.
“Yes,” Draco said, forcing his voice to be normal. “It’s still set for the day after tomorrow at 10.”
Draco put out the cigarette he was smoking (he didn’t think Potter liked it) and looked at him expectantly.
Draco shuddered as he remembered the way his father had grabbed his face when he was eleven and whispered threats about what would happen if Draco’s deviancy got out into the world. He didn’t even understand what his father had been talking about; all he knew was that he was terrified and had something – or
Harry took another pull, long and deep, and Draco took the opportunity to admire his beauty. Draco was enraptured by his long neck, his Adam’s apple bobbing up and down with every drink. His eyes were closed, face less scrunched up than it was during the last two pulls. Harry pulled the bottle away with a little cough and his eyes opened, startling green and gazing straight at Draco.
When he was finished, Harry crawled up to lie next to Draco, who was panting, his hair awry. Harry made to cuddle but Draco stopped him with a hand to his chest.
“I think they thought it was Ginny for a moment, but then she came sat down at our table with Zabini, so those hopes were dashed,” Harry chuckled at the memory.
Hermione pulled up a list of links, showing them to Harry as she nervously explained what she’d been doing. She had found different resources for those suffering from mental illness.
They walked together into the kitchen, where Harry set the cup tray on the counter. Ginny had already dug out her almond croissant and taken a bite.
“So I can’t care, right? I can’t remember. I’ve got to pretend everything’s normal and fine and this is just another year at Hogwarts even though this entire castle is a giant graveyard. It’s just…wrong. And I needed fresh air, and this seemed like a good idea at the time, but I was obviously wrong, so I’ll just-”
Draco’s hands went to the bottom of Harry’s shirt; he had to see him. They parted so Draco could pull it over his head, and Merlin, he’d never get used to the sight. He wondered how Harry stayed so toned, and when it had happened. He’d been so scrawny as a teenager.
“No, I want to do this. I really do,” Draco said firmly. “I just have to – I don’t know – stop thinking of worst-case scenario. Just think about the best-case one instead.”
Draco kissed him again, threading his fingers through the mess of Harry’s hair. He felt Harry smile into the kiss, and Draco couldn’t help but smile back.
He passed Blaise on his way out the door, who simply glanced at him through hooded eyes – if there was ever a ‘night person,’ Blaise would be it – and headed for the bathroom.
Potter blinked as if he hadn’t been expecting it (as if he hadn’t been demanding it), and then grinned at Draco. An actual, honest-to-Merlin smile that was directed at Draco.
Potter’s eyes were almost pleading. His fist was clenched around the card, which was now surely crumpled. He was sitting up, leaning forward and towards Draco. He thought about Potter’s breakdown yesterday. Draco felt a twinge of pain in his chest.
“It’s the only thing that keeps me from offing myself,” Draco said wryly, only half-joking. “And the weight loss is just a happy side-effect.”
“Umbridge,” Harry bit out. “She gave me detentions for telling the truth about Voldemort-“ Draco flinched but Harry went on as usual, “and this is what she made me do. Carve these words over and over again, as if it’d make it true. As if it’d mean that he wasn’t really back.”
They’d made it to the eighth-year dormitories; Draco muttered the password to the portrait and gone through the portrait hole as soon as it’d opened, leaving Astoria dumbfounded and alone in the corridor.
Draco blinked. He hadn’t realized. It made sense, now that Harry said it…Draco remembered how Harry had trailed off, how he had gotten that strange look on his face when he tried to say what Draco was to him.
Potter entered the room with hands in his pockets. Draco wasn't sure if he was trying to look casual, but it sure wasn't working.
“I just constantly feel sick to my stomach,” Samuel answered with a frown. “Normally, when I’m anxious, it goes away after a while, but it hasn’t been going away lately. I just can’t calm down. My stomach’s always twisting and my brain is always going, so it’s - it’s not fun.”
“Yes. He Owled me on Tuesday and we made plans to have dinner together in,” Draco checked his watch, “Twenty-four minutes.”
It’d been two days since that night. He and Harry hadn’t gotten much of a chance to talk since then; last night, they met at the same place by the lake. This was where Harry insisted that Draco call him Harry; this was where Draco agreed, and this was where they spent the next half an hour kissing, shielded by the dark of the night.
“Oh,” said Harry. He looked down at it in interest and skimmed the entrees. “Yeah, sounds great, Malfoy.”
Harry did as he was told, and Draco shuddered. His trembling hands ran from Harry’s shoulder, covered in the thin cloth, to his arse, bare and ready for Draco.
But before he could go any further with a messy explanation, Cait and Malfoy came stumbling forward. Cait had an arm around Malfoy’s body – Harry thought that she must’ve been aiming for his shoulders but she was too short to reach them. But what really grabbed Harry’s attention was the fact that there was a smile on Malfoy’s face. An actual smile.
Draco went to sit on the corner of his bed, facing Harry. He carried a duffle bag full of his clothes, which were admittedly of a higher quality than Harry’s own.
He felt euphoric as he’d purged himself of the food he’d eaten that morning; a bit of porridge and cantaloupe. It had been a little while since he'd been able to and he forgot how good it felt afterwards.
Draco cleared his throat uncomfortably and asked, “Do they know? About what you told me last night.”
“But what about what happened last night?” Draco asked Ira. “That certainly isn’t normal. I’ve never done that with any other patient before.”
Ginny and Luna arrived fashionably late (for what reason, Harry didn’t know) and attracted lots of attention. Apparently, they had still been keeping their relationship on the down-low and used this event to make it public.
“Anyway, sorry, what was it that you wanted to ask me?” Draco asked, breaking himself out of his reverie.
“Yeah,” Harry agreed. He glanced over Samuel’s shoulder for a second, catching a glimpse of Malfoy. Harry hesitated, then nodded towards him. “Hey, er, d’you know him?”
He was looking at Draco seriously now instead of with lighthearted amusement. Draco tried to look back at him apologetically.
“I know about being hungry,” Potter said flatly. “I grew up hungry, and then I had to go hungry all over again last year. And considering how much you eat and, well, don’t eat, I know for a fact that you are.”
He stuck to his word and arrived to her flat through Floo five to noon. Harry stepped out of the fireplace and called out, “Ginny?”
Draco went into work early, figuring there was nothing else to do. He had downed two cups of coffee at home, hoping to mitigate the effects of the five hours of sleep he’d had, but headed to the employee lounge for another. Fortunately, there was no one in the lounge; it was early yet.
“Don’t you think just about everyone would find it odd if I suddenly started calling you Harry?” Draco replied, beginning to clean up their area.
Harry pushed Draco’s head down again and Draco obeyed, his fingernails digging into Harry’s thighs as he sucked earnestly. Harry moaned and he fisted Draco’s soft hair, not caring that his palms were sweaty. Draco’s mouth was tight and warm around his cock, Draco’s tongue weaving and sliding up and down it.
“I dare you to finish that sentence, Potter,” Draco threatened, his eyes dark. “You don’t have to make excuses for them.”
“Again, I stress how committed we are to Mr. Potter’s recovery and well-being. We’ll leave you with him now.”
God, but it was weird thinking about the four of them drinking amicably and being on first-name basis with each other. Was it really that easy moving on?
Harry shrugged. "I mean...it's the last tangible reminder of Sirius. And y'know...it's cheap. And Kreacher’s quite fond of me," he tried to joke.
His back arched, overwhelmed with pleasure, and Draco just sucked harder – Harry could imagine those shining eyes, deliciously malevolent and guarded and
“Do you think they’d let you go outside?” asked Ginny softly after minutes of silence, their slow breaths the only sounds in the room.
"What happened?" she asked immediately. After all these years, after all they've been through together, after all Harry had put her through, Ginny knew him all too well.
He became lightheaded suddenly, his body protesting against, well, everything. Draco swayed where he stood, and Potter’s tough façade fell immediately.
Could he really escape? The only real belongings he had here were the clothes on his back, the one change of clothes that Ginny had brought him a few days ago, and his Cloak. And his wand, but he could worry about that later. Right now, he just had to leave.
Draco felt worse. Potter could do such a good job at putting on a show for his friends, while all Draco could do was distance himself from the few he had left. It was typical of him, really, to be so moody and selfish. He half-watched Potter and wondered how he did it, how he gathered the energy to interact with people and put on a happy face when thoughts of death weighed on his mind. Draco was both impressed and bitter.
"Oh please," she said as if it was obvious. "I'd be the perfect girlfriend. And you wouldn't be competing against someone who could be a bloody model."
“Fucking Malfoy,” cursed Harry under his breath, and then Fucking Malfoy himself entered the room after the briefest of knocks.
Draco felt ridiculously underdressed with Harry in his Muggle street clothes and him in his favorite silk pajamas. Merlin, and what kind of person had silk pajamas? He made a mental note to himself:
“Bloody delicious,” Ira corrected him again. They raised their wand and sent a locking charm at the door before returning their attention back to Draco. “Alright. Let’s talk this through.”
Draco never knew what Potter was thinking. Before, his expressions and body language were easy to read. Angry. Provoked. Smug. Those emotions were so simple. One look and Draco knew exactly what Potter was thinking, and how he could best rile him up.
Harry still felt like a massive failure despite Malfoy’s words, but he didn’t tell him this. Malfoy’s eyes were sad now, and it tugged painfully at Harry’s heart.
Draco’s mind and gaze wandered over to the Gryffindor table across the Hall; this was second nature to him by now. Potter’s demeanor was still relaxed; he was listening enthusiastically to his classmates, all smiling and laughing as if they hadn’t just been involved in a war.
“Draco?” Harry asked his retreating back, but Draco kept walking towards the kitchen, his hands curling into fists. He stood up as well but froze where he stood, unsure if he should approach Draco. “I’m sorry – was that too much? I’m not used to this, I haven’t done
“Fine,” Harry sighed exaggeratedly but allowed Draco to turn back around so Harry could resume spooning him.
He was the only other male eighth year in Slytherin. Vincent, of course, had passed (Draco still had very conflicted and painful feelings on this subject) and Gregory had left the country with his mother (his father being in Azkaban).
A rustle from the other side of the room distracted him from his thoughts. Draco turned onto his side and saw that Harry was stretching and groaning.
Leonel nodded, his brows furrowed and impossibly perfect teeth worrying his bottom lip. Then, as soon as it started, the yelling stopped. Potter’s body relaxed and slowly fell back onto the mattress.
Harry watched as a short list appeared in front of him. Betty began copying down the floating words with great speed; Hermione and Ron looked interestedly at it, the former moving closer to get a better look.
“Yes,” said Draco. “He was resistant at first, but with enough encouragement from his loved ones, he made the decision to work with us and complete treatment. The cleansing procedure worked perfectly, and you can see that his vitals were up to standard days before he left.”
He felt rather than saw Potter scan the room, the movements threatening to drive Draco’s head off Potter’s shoulder, but then Potter leaned back against the armchair they were both squeezed in and Draco was safe.
She complied, taking off and disappearing through the open window. Harry sat down at the edge of the bed, his heart still racing. Draco propped his head up, watching him with anxious eyes.
Out of all the things that had knocked Draco off balance that day, Harry Potter smiling at him might’ve been the most disarming.
Harry was breathing hard now, wholly aware that they were causing a scene but not caring in the slightest. He just needed Draco to respond, say something back, but all he was doing was staring at Harry with wide eyes.
“I really like you too,” Draco returned, caught off guard. Then he thought, if this is what Harry wanted – to be distracted – Draco could give that to him. He could do that for him. “I have for too long, to be honest.”
"I was scared, all right?" Draco burst out, snapping his head up to glare at Harry. "I've got to look out for myself."
any bruises there tomorrow. He was murmuring something below his breath as he gained speed, fucking Draco harder and harder. Draco’s hands scrambled for sheets – there weren’t any – and had to settle for clawing into the mattress. He spread his legs wider for Harry, willing and wanting to take everything Harry could give. Harry took this as a sign and pushed them even further apart, now driving his cock so far into Draco that there was the sound of skin hitting skin every time he thrust forward.
Draco cursed inwardly and looked down at his table. Everything was too different and too similar all at once. This classroom, one he’d spent countless hours in, was being filled with new presences when the old had barely left. He still half expected to hear Professor Snape ruthlessly berating Longbottom or Potter even though Snape was long gone, from both this classroom and this earth. Draco wondered idly if Slughorn would be back to teach Potions. He couldn’t see why he wouldn’t.
“Nah – well, maybe,” Harry thought for a moment. “But Dreamless Sleep was really the one that did it for me.”
“It’s not our fault, Hermione,” Weasley said, though it sounded like he was trying to convince himself as much as Granger. “We couldn’t have known it was this bad. You know how he is about hiding things…”
Draco released the smoke from his lungs and shivered. It was getting colder out (big surprise) and Draco had forgotten his scarf in his rush this morning. He had another nightmare; this one had featured Nagini. He wondered if he would ever be free of the taint the Dark Lord left in his house. He wondered if he deserved to be free.
"Sorry, Harry, but that stupid git should be the last thing on your mind right now. You've got much more important things to focus on, like
"I don't think so. Potter can rile himself up with little to no difficulty. But thank you, I suppose, for defending my honor."
And before Draco could say another word, Harry went to catch Weasley and Granger as they exited the classroom.
“They told me,” Potter said matter-of-factly, eyes on his apple. “Sort of. They keep asking me about it, saying things like
Draco’s eyes glittered as he gave a devilish smirk and slowly withdrew Harry’s cock from his pants. And then, so slowly it made Harry groan, Draco licked the length of it from the base to the head, keeping eye contact with him the whole time. When he reached the head, he licked his lips and took him whole, his hot mouth sliding down the length easily. Harry trembled and knocked his head back, hardly containing the hiss that threatened to escape his lips.
Harry bit down a smile and inched closer, putting his hands on Draco’s waist. He licked experimentally up Draco’s neck, making the other man shudder.
“I did research all night. I couldn’t sleep, I just kept thinking about what you’d said. So I snuck into the library and found a few books on erm, wizard sexuality. It was like trying to find out about Flamel or Horcruxes all over again; it was
He guessed he was somewhere past tipsy but not quite drunk. He lost Pansy somewhere after the third drink, and Blaise had disappeared far before then.
“Come on, I need to ask you something,” she said to him, and then whispered exaggeratedly, “In private.”
After breakfast, Draco and Harry decided to go outside into the snow. Draco breathed deep, savoring the fresh, cold air. Ever since his first year, the sight of Hogwarts draped in snow gave him a sense of calm. It just looked so
Draco and Astoria trailed along after Pansy and Daphne, who seemed to be discussing a seventh year who’d recently
“Let them down gently,” said Ira seriously. “I’m too busy for a relationship. And anyway, it’s inapp-“ Ira stopped mid-word and their pale eyes widened. “Draco, is this…are you talking about Mr. Potter?”
Draco nodded. He glanced at the Gryffindor table as he left, and he could have sworn Potter was looking right at him for just a second. Draco focused his attention on leaving the Great Hall, his cheeks growing warm as he stared determinedly at the exit.
“And given Potter’s antagonism towards me,” Draco continued, glancing away, a frown on his face, “He’s even less likely to listen to me. So I’m hoping that you’ll try and convince him.”
“Harry! Are these yours?” Granger demanded as she approached, brandishing exactly what Draco was looking for moments ago.
Harry smirked. He took his glasses off and placed them and his wand on the bedside table behind the curtain. Harry was always handsome, that was undeniable, but without those glasses obscuring his face…
He didn’t think Harry was telling him the whole truth, but Harry went on before Draco could ask him to elaborate.
“Salazar, you’re infuriating,” Pansy said between gritted teeth. Draco wondered if she would pull at her hair next. “You’re not even listening to me. I just asked
“No, I’m not saying that,” Harry said quickly, his heart sinking and suddenly feeling very sick. “I’m sorry, Hermione, should I go? I’ll go.”
“Reckon I should be thankful I can’t speak parseltongue, then. Merlin, what were we even talking about before this? I can’t remember.”
“Harry,” Ginny warned, not taking kindly to his hesitation, “I’ll call Ron and Hermione over and the three of us will flip this entire place over if we have to.”
“You don’t need to apologize for anything,” Harry said, his voice soft and kind. It made Draco feel even guiltier; he didn’t deserve this, he didn’t deserve Harry. “I know the war’s affected you…like it’s affected me, just in different ways.”
Harry ran a hand through his hair and looked off at the wall, trying to remember when he'd first used Muggle drugs.
Draco’s heart was still pounding with anger, thudding loudly in his ears, but he tried to process what Harry was saying. When he did, he reached up to touch the soft material.
“Look, not to put my Healer hat on again but do you know what you’re getting yourself into?” Draco asked critically. Harry sat up straighter, rising to the bait. “Is this what you
"I'm going to...ignore that and ask that we switch back to the original topic,” Draco said uncomfortably. “I'm rusty when it comes to dating, but so is Potter, so that can either be a good thing or a bad thing."
“Think on it, at least.” Malfoy took his wand out and checked Harry’s vitals again. “Your heart rate has accelerated a bit. How are you feeling now?”
“Yeah?” said Harry, excited at the prospect at seeing Draco’s flat for the first time. “Let’s go. I haven’t been to yours before.”
“They’re having a party, you know,” Pansy said finally. She drew her legs in close and wrapped her arms around them. She looked cold. “The rest of the eighth years. A Halloween get-together. We’ve been invited as well, if you’re interested.”
I'm sure there's loads of mistakes but I wanted to post before I had to go to work today since it's nearly been a year! So so sorry and hope you enjoy. Just ignore any errors you see <3
I had almost killed two people by that time – all while I was plotting to kill someone else entirely,” Draco pointed out.
“Yes, Healer. I was told a few days ago by her partner that they’re in New Zealand until the end of the month,” Draco said, thinking back to the owl Blaise had just sent him.
He gritted his teeth and trained his eyes to the floor. Harry wondered what his parents would think of him if they knew what he’d become. If they knew where he was and why. Would they still be proud of him? Or would they be disappointed? Perhaps even disgusted at the way he turned out? At the way he spoke about them so coarsely?
“I, well, when I was a kid…my friends say I was abused,” Harry said quickly, because quickly was the only way he could possibly get it out. “Which, really, is too strong of a word, I think. I mean, yeah, the Du- er, my caretakers weren’t the nicest people but they kept me alive. I had a roof over my head, and I got food at least once a day, so I can’t be ungrateful, y’know?”
hungry, but he didn’t know if that was enough to override the panic and disgust and reluctance that was already taking over him.
“No, I’m here on my own volition,” answered Astoria, taking a step forward. Her arms were crossed and her blonde hair fell to her chest in careful, loose waves. “Because I’m worried about you.”
He blinked at the sunlight coming in though the blinds, eyes adjusting to the harsh light that woke him up before unsticking the notes from his cheek. Draco checked his wristwatch – it was barely six in the morning.
Harry’s voice snapped Draco out of his tired stupor; he sat up and looked down at Harry, who was thrashing about in his sleep. He was having a nightmare.
Harry cast Scourgify wandlessly, the showoff, cleaning the mess they’d made before lying down next to Draco.
Draco found Pansy with ease after Blaise had pointed him in the right direction. True to his word, Pansy was revising in the library with Padma Patil. He approached her with crossed arms.
“I’ve half a mind to,” grumbled Harry. He turned away and picked up the second letter from Malfoy, telling him where to meet him for dinner. He tried pushing down the light, hopeful feeling in his stomach without much avail. “Right.”
He felt like he’d been reduced to just the worst parts of himself afterward coming back; his irritability, his lack of control, his guilt, suspicion, and hopelessness. He couldn’t do that to her. He couldn’t force her to stay with him and care for him when he didn’t even care for himself.
She continued to look at him. There was a cig behind her ear and a silver hoop through the side of her nose.
Draco pulled it off and let it drop to the side of the bed. Harry’s hands went to Draco’s chest at once, tracing invisible patterns around his scarred skin (
“What? Hermione, what are you on about?” Weasley asked. Draco watched as Weasley’s own eyes jumped from each of them, landing lastly on the love bite on Harry’s neck. Weasley blanched. “Harry, did you…?”
eat, he felt nauseated, either "naturally" or through his own, fucked-up means. The feeling of food in his stomach had grown foreign to him. It had become unnatural, uncomfortable. Getting rid of it granted him some peace of mind, a sort of high, per se.
Just one drink, one pill, one line, and all of this would just melt away. God, his mouth watered at the thought of a nice, thick line of cocaine just sitting there, waiting for him, giving him what he needed to get through the evening and the drip that he craved so badly.
“Yes, of course,” Kathy smiled. “For those of you who weren’t here, or who don’t remember, it’s called the four-seven-eight breathing exercise. Follow along if you want.”
Harry attempted a smile and sat upright, leaning against the headboard. He'd tried many times before to get her to call him Harry, but she politely refused.
Draco was already groaning as he turned around to face Blaise, but he was shocked into silence by his companion. It seemed the same had happened to Astoria, who had also swiveled in her seat.
Potter, recover. As I’ve said before, we must help you flush out the potions in your system. And then we’ll be helping you stop taking said potions and curb your addiction.”
“No, no, she just explained what being aromantic means,” Harry said, meeting Draco’s suspicious gaze. “It’s really interesting; I never even knew something like that existed. I guess I just always assumed everyone experienced romantic attraction…”
At this point, the potion called for fifteen minutes to simmer gently, leaving Draco with nothing to occupy himself with. He did his best to continue ignoring Potter, and willed him not to talk in return. He didn’t want Potter looking at him. He was unworthy; he was dirt. Potter was a hero, and Draco felt all the more repulsive being so close to someone so exceedingly good – inside and out. Draco wondered if the fifteen minutes had passed yet.
Harry bit his lip but nodded. Draco paused in buttoning up his shirt and put his hand to the back of Harry’s neck, kissing the top of his head.
“Did they know?” At Harry’s puzzled expression, Wolff elaborated. “Did they know you’d gone to drink alone?”
He couldn’t say that part though, much as he believed it. Wasn’t this happening all too fast? Wasn’t there still residual effects of Draco having been Harry’s Healer? And, not to mention, their childhoods?
He then gripped his wand and spun on the spot, becoming enveloped in the dark and spat back out in an alley. Harry let out a fortifying breath and looked around, seeing only Muggles. Relieved, he stuck his wand back in his pocket and walked out onto the sidewalk. On his left was the restaurant Malfoy had been talking about.
After lunch came, Harry decided to take a shower. He felt filthy, covered in sweat and his mouth still tasting of vomit. The mirror tutted at him, and he turned away from his own reflection with a scowl.
Pure bliss flooded Draco’s mind and he shut his eyes again tight, struggling to breathe, only feeling Harry’s cock and his calloused hand around Draco’s neck. Everything else went away.
“I’m not saying it is!” he said wildly. Draco was surprised; he’d gotten used to seeing Potter relatively calm over the past few months. “I’m just saying that what he have goes deeper than a childhood rivalry! And it goes beyond my ‘saving people thing.’ We’ve been through too much together for that, Malfoy. You’re not just some classmate, or some person I saved once. You’re…”
Draco blinked. It was hard enough to follow Harry’s ramble, but he had no earthly idea what that last part was supposed to be.
He'd gotten used to not eating. Sharing a house with a bloodthirsty murderer had taken away his appetite, funnily enough. Maybe it was all the lessons on torture with his killer aunt, or perhaps the suffocating anxiety of making one wrong move in front of the Dark Lord, or maybe the smell of blood that seemed to be stained in the floors and in the walls and in his nostrils, but his appetite had vanished that spring, and it hadn't come back.
Malfoy studied him for a moment longer before taking his leave. A minute later, Ron and Hermione reentered.
Potter let out a bitter laugh without turning back around. Draco watched the back of his head with a clenched chest.
“Twice, I reckon,” Potter grumbled, opening his eyes to squint at Draco. “This is meant to be me healing, yeah?”
“My job is to learn about you so I can effectively treat you,” he said, his voice probably meant to be calming. “I know we haven’t had the best of pasts – “Harry scoffed. “- but I
“We’ll look into that.” Malfoy wrote something down. “Well, it seems you have the typical symptoms of withdrawal from calming potions and alcohol, so you shouldn’t be too worried. If you experience any more severe symptoms, alert a Healer right away.”
It ended differently than what I had originally planned, and it's also a lot shorter but I hope it's alright.
“Fine,” she had said, her face defiant. It reminded him of their days at Hogwarts (he felt a sad twang of nostalgia at that). “But I’m sending you all of these links just in case you change your mind. What’s your email address?”
“Oh come on, it’s not that bad,” Harry ventured. He was coming closer again, and Draco was backed against a wall. “It’s not like you’ve never felt my sweat before.”
They pulled the covers out from underneath them (with much effort), and collapsed into bed once more. Harry pulled Draco in close, so close that his back was pressed against Harry’s warm skin, still sticky with sweat. Harry draped an arm over him.
Speaking of self-destruction, Draco was currently holed up in the sixth-floor bathroom, purging himself of the little food he’d eaten at dinner. He finished quickly and went to rinse himself off, thinking about how Pansy had seemed torn between shouting at him and crying when she saw him leaving. Blaise wasn’t at the table, apparently too preoccupied to join them like he had been for the past few days. Daphne had barely blinked when he stood, but Astoria had regarded him with a soft expression, her mouth pulled down in a slight frown.
“It’s so good to have you with us, Harry,” Katherine said. “Oh, but please call me Kathy. I’d like us all to be comfortable with one another.”
“Something about you,” Draco said, his voice low, “Makes me lose all of my senses. Ever since the beginning, you’ve blinded me.”
“I’ve thought about it.” Harry removed his gaze from Malfoy and instead stared down at the card that sat on the bed beside him. “I think – I’ll go.”
"So you immediately jumped to the conclusion that I'd tell the whole world about you?” he asked, his voice rising. “How about the simple fact that I just wanted to be normal?"
She nodded and withdrew herself from the crack in the door. A few seconds later, she opened it so his two closest friends could come inside, their faces strained and worried.
admittedly forgotten all about it. He made a mental note to send them a congratulatory note and gift as soon as possible. “Give my regards to the happy couple.”
“That’s what he told me,” shrugged Draco. And then he asked, “Is it strange for you? That he’s seeing your ex?”
“Right, I hope you’re feeling ready to jump back into it. Who’d like to go next?” Her eyes scanned the room, finally landing on Harry.
"It's so early," Potter groaned, and Draco made to apologize but Potter just stepped back and waved him in.
“I want them to be happy about it though,” Potter said. “They’re just letting the past get in the way.”
Draco thought of his own nightmares. Even now, the Dark Lord or his cursed snake made an appearance at least once a week, causing Draco to wake up in a cold sweat and with a strangled scream in his throat. Blaise never said anything, thankfully, but Draco still disliked the way Blaise looked at him the mornings after.
"I'm not doing it to make fun of her, you dolt," Draco said, his voice now back to his own. "I'm doing it so you'll open up or whatever."
“Has no one really told you?” Draco asked, and when Selina shook her head, he was slightly surprised. “This must be the first time they’ve actually kept their bloody mouths shut. Yes, he’s here, but he’s asked us to keep his presence under wraps. No reporters, no fans, and absolutely no
Draco wrote Potter's answer down, his hand gripping his quill so tightly he wondered if he might break it in half.
“We’ve got a break now,” Kathy said after taking out her phone to check the time, “So we’ll continue in ten minutes, like always.”
"Merlin, Potter, you're so fucking gorgeous," Draco murmured as he began to unbutton his shirt, his grey eyes burning into Harry. He would have been self-conscious if not for the obvious desire in Draco's face.
“It doesn’t matter, just forget it,” Draco replied, waving the question away. “The point is, all I want to do now is sleep. So just go.”
He stared at him, trying to figure out if he was being serious. But he must’ve been. The way Harry was gazing at him was so intense it was clear it was anything but a joke.
, in fact, read Skeeter’s biography on you, though with a grain of salt. I tried to find material that was objective as possible, though, considering it’s journalism, objectivity is impossible. Still, I managed to find some illuminating information.”
Draco stiffened; he was going to kill Pansy. It was bad enough that she was telling Draco that he was idolizing Harry and that he didn’t know what he was doing; it was another thing entirely for her to threaten Harry when Draco had his back turned.
Remembering Ginny’s words, he walked inside the restaurant. It looked quite posh, all sleek and black and modern inside. The maître d’ perked up at the sight of him.
Harry slipped his hand into Draco's trousers, past the waistband of his pants and took hold of Draco's cock, already wet with precome.
drop everything for him because that’s just the kind of effect he has on people,” Draco continued, watching as Harry’s playful smile began to falter. He stood, slowly, keeping eye contact with Harry as he did so. He moved closer. “Especially on me. And I don’t even think he knows it.”
“I’d rather you leave too,” Harry bit out, wiping the wetness away from his face with the heel of his palm. He’d turned his head to the side, not wanting to see Malfoy, or for Malfoy to see him. Still, out of the corner of his eyes, he saw Malfoy come closer. Harry closed them. “Please, Malfoy. Just go.”
Harry couldn't help the moan from escaping his lips even if he'd wanted to. He clutched the sheets tightly, his left cheek pressed flush against the bed.
He turned his head away from Malfoy and opted to look out the window again. Apparently, there was a charm on it so patients could see outside it, but anyone on the other side couldn’t look in. Betty had told him that one morning.
. He wondered what Ginevra was thinking of him now that she knew he was still thinking about his ex-patient three weeks after his release. She didn’t sound mad, at least. In fact, she didn’t sound much of anything. Unsettled and ashamed, Draco stuffed the letter back into its envelope and shooed the owl away.
"Never mind them. Look, Harry," Ginny said suddenly, her eyes flashing dangerously as she stepped forward. Harry blinked; he’d momentarily forgotten that she’d been there at all. "You've got a problem. I've known it for a long fucking time and I hate that I didn't try and help you more. But there's no use dwelling on the past, so the only thing to do now is
“Of course,” said Leonel. “The entire hospital didn’t fall apart in the, what, five hours you’ve been gone?”
He took Draco’s hand and they walked closer to the water’s edge, where they both sat down, huddled close for warmth. Draco took one last pull from his cigarette before Vanishing it.
He half-heard Hermione explain what it was, making Harry feel even worse. His face was burning up more and more as she spoke, and soon he felt like he was drowning in shame.
He marveled at sight in front of him. Harry was, by the looks of it, just as eager and ready as Draco was. His cock was thicker than Draco imagined, and so very hard. Draco bent forward, resuming his exploration of Harry’s body. He kissed Harry’s inner thighs, working closer and closer to his cock, reveling in the sounds and twitches Harry made. Draco paused to pull off his own jumper, leaving only his own button-up underneath.
“Excellent. And I suppose Miss Weasley will be his most immediate support system?” Scarlett asked, raising her eyebrows.
"Ira, I'm two seconds away from pulling out my hair, so if you could please just keep the quips at bay for a moment."
“But surely you communicate each and every thought to your bosom friends. Don’t break wizarding Britain’s heart, now, Potter.”
to gossip. The person in question was fixing themselves a cup of tea, using the leftover water in the kettle.
He gave a shuddering breath and slid down the wall into a pathetic heap on the ground. Harry drew his legs up to his chest, took his glasses off aggressively, set them aside, and burrowed his face in his arms, unshed tears dampening his shirtsleeves.
“I’m sorry - you know how I am when I get mad,” Harry said, his face apologetic. “I know you weren’t ready to let people know and I messed up, Draco.”
Draco chose to wear Muggle clothes despite the fact that they were going to the Leaky; he’d been in robes long enough today. He Apparated outside the pub at eight o’clock exactly and headed inside, immediately on the lookout for his three coworkers.
“Good question. I suppose we’ll just have to wait and see,” Blaise answered, his gaze slipping to Weasley, who frowned at Draco as one would a feral crup.
“I need to talk to you,” Draco admitted. He felt his eyebrows pinch together. “About non-work-related matters.”
He put effort into saying Potter’s name as nastily as possible, finding it easier than he would’ve liked to slip into his old childhood persona, and it paid off; Potter flinched and withdrew from Draco an inch. But then Potter gritted his teeth and leaned forward again, glaring at Draco with those bright green eyes.
He picked up his own pace, wanting Malfoy to feel every bit as good as he did. It seemed to work, Harry thought, by the way Malfoy closed his eyes and bit his own lip. How was it possible for someone to be so –
Harry let out a small laugh. “Yes, I’m sure. It’s cos I trust you…and you understand. On some level, you understand.”
"I know,” Harry said. He chewed on his lip before turning his gaze back to Malfoy. “I'm fine, I promise. I'm not nauseated or anything. Just a little headache."
“All done. You seem to be perfectly healthy,” said Malfoy after a moment. “I’ll go owl Ginevra – she should be here shortly.”
“I’m glad, Harry,” Ginny said. “I’d have to have a word with the both of them if they were being idiots.”
It was Ira and Betty once again, approaching the two men with matching smiles. Draco’s face warmed at the thought that they had seen Draco ogling Leo. They didn’t say anything about it, however, and instead ordered drinks.
“Oh yeah? And how do you reckon I’ll start that conversation?” Potter asked bitterly. “Hey Ginny, how are things? Also, I never told you, but I died in May.”
it was like that, just like that, Draco Malfoy was really inside him right now, his skin hot against his own.
