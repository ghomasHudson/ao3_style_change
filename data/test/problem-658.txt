by him. He would want Draco to move in with him. He would take away his freedom, expect him to give up any independence he had gained since having Scorpius.
Harry began roughly pumping them in and out, spurred on by Draco’s sharp little whines of discomfort.
Narcissa was—
Draco glanced up at him, his gray eyes widening. “Are y-you sure?”
Harry nodded, his eyes softening. “I know. I haven’t forgotten. We can go by Floo when we get home.”
without a wand, but Harry was no novice.
you.”
Harry leaned forward and sucked Draco’s small cock into his mouth, his lips tickled by the boy’s sparse, blond pubic hair.
Draco closed his mouth, his teeth snapping together with an audible click. He took a step closer to Harry, his stomach brushing against Harry’s again, a ridiculous flutter in his chest accompanying the contact.
in love—
He shook the forbidden image from his head and stared down at his rounded stomach.
Draco let out a tiny whimper and rolled to his side, facing Harry.
He felt his cheeks grow warm before he finally tore his gaze away.
him to try to escape. Maybe he wanted Draco to mess up, so he could punish him.
Inside, Draco imagined the cold man as a rotting carcass. His heart was probably shrunk and wilted from years of disuse and repression.
“It’s a bit much for a first-time drinker,” Ginny said softly, irking him.
Unadulterated fear skittered up Draco’s spine.
It took several clumsy attempts, but Draco complied, unbuttoning and pushing the shirt down to pool around his small waist.
If only the outside matched the inside.
Draco thought back to the last few months and how unbearably
in the Wizarding World. Draco and the innocent baby that would grow in his womb would be dependent on Harry. The fetus would need Harry’s magic near it at all times.
At that exact moment, Draco’s pup nudged against Arlen’s prodding hand, as if responding to Draco’s thoughts of Harry.
Draco wasn’t in heat and Harry wasn’t experiencing a rut.
cock.
He made a beeline to his father’s guest room and went in, sitting on the bed as he tried to get a handle on his emotions.
Draco snapped his mouth shut, glowering up at him.
Tears burned behind Draco’s lids, his knees hurting from pressing into the hard floor. His stomach felt heavy, his back hurting from his uncomfortable position.
“See?” Harry purred. “Our pup knows who Daddy is. I don’t want you letting anyone but me touch you, Draco. If he needs to touch you,
Arlen nodded, a furrow appearing between his eyebrows. “Yes, that is your baby, Mr. Potter,” he moved his wand to the side and titled his head slightly. He pulled back his wand and flicked it, golden script appearing in the air beside Draco’s stomach, numbers. He pressed his wand back to Draco’s stomach, his shiny jellybean reappearing.  “Strange...”
“There, there,” Pansy said stiltedly. “It’ll be okay, kid.”
He walked over and picked it up, opening it.
“He’s fine, Narcissa. Actually, he’s better than fine.” Harry paused to watch Narcissa’s eyes become alight with relief, relishing in her false hope before he spoke again. “He’s pregnant, Narcissa. Eight months along.”
Harry.”
“I know it’s been a difficult adjustment for you, Draco, but I would be grateful if you did this for me. No one will find out and I’ll finish the floors for you in the entrance hall.”
”What’s going on?”
As he came down, he barely registered Harry crawling up his body and positioning the head of his cock against his slick-covered hole.
He couldn’t become sentimental at a time like this. He was pregnant and his husband was still missing.
She gave a bark of laughter and Draco’s cheeks suffused with heat.
Harry knelt on the bed, clad in just black boxer briefs. “I’m tired of this childish game. My pregnant Omega needs me, and I intend to provide.”
For the first time in her life, Hermione didn’t have an answer.
His father had ingrained him from a young age that to rely on others was to be weak. His own fears, anxieties, and self-doubt had always held him back from what he wanted most. Deep down, he knew what he had to do.
family and only mine.”
me writing this chapter:
Harry sat at his kitchen table, a still burning cigarette between his lips.
Harry and Scorpius were nowhere to be found.
That was one promise he planned to keep.
Harry scoffed. “If we’re going to discuss what you should have done, Draco, we’ll start with how you
”It’s rather morose, isn’t it?”
”I don’t know, Ron. This type of thing just doesn’t interest me...”
Harry gestured to the small sofa in the back of his office that he sometimes used to sleep on when he wasn’t able to get away from work. Draco nodded and sat on the sofa, still clutching Scorpius to his chest. Harry sat down next to him, his heart leaping when his knee brushed against Draco’s on accident.
When he had been captured, he had spent so much time caged and afraid. It had traumatized him, the things he had seen. He didn’t like thinking about those things and they often snuck up on him in his dreams.
“I just…haven’t gotten around to it,” he said gruffly.
Draco shook his head. “I-I was in heat. I wasn’t myself,” he whispered, tears pricking his eyes.
Draco cast a panicked look up Harry. Harry was glaring at the closed stall door, his lip pulling back in a sneer.
He tamped down his baser instincts, focusing on his trembling rabbit.
What would happen if Harry
, I have a better idea, baby.”
Harry readied himself, drawing upon his hatred to steel himself for whatever tactics clever Narcissa would undoubtedly use to trick him.
His mother had made him promise not to reveal his true identity to any of the staff or the manor’s master.

Alpha? Do you feel
Harry lips turned up in a smug, self-satisfied smile. “That wasn’t so hard, was it, Draco?”
”Then if no one touched you...
With Harry’s help, Draco got to unsteadily to his feet. He gingerly placed one knee on the cushion of the armchair, then the other, bracketing Harry’s hips. His belly was between them, pressing against Harry’s abdomen.
Draco nodded sheepishly. “I’m sorry. I forgot.”
“Well,” Kingsley cleared his throat before continuing, “I’d like to think of it as providing a more…
”What’s the little pup’s name?”
Another sharp jab to his lower back had him hissing in a breath.
”Greedy boy,” Harry chided. “Take down your shirt, I see how hard your nipples are. Let me take a look and I’ll think about fulfilling your request.”
,” Harry rasped, walking over to the bed. “Don’t be frightened, baby. Dada is sorry.”
Draco hissed, the strong tugs of Scorpius’ mouth alleviating some of his chest’s discomfort.
Harry carried Draco from the kitchen and up the stairs.
Draco tightened his arms around his chest, making Harry narrow his eyes. “Is something wrong, Draco?”
him and he wasn’t able to get to them in time?
Harry had only been able to stare at the rabbit’s pink, pebbled nipples, jutting out wantonly from his white fur. They had been wet, sheening with his saliva.
It stung his pride that he had to get
Next chapter: Draco goes into heat. 👀
Potter paused at his moan and his breath hitched when he felt the older man spread his cleft with his long fingers, exposing his hole.
Draco cried out, throwing his head back against the mattress. He undulated his hips as Harry softly sucked, his tongue sinuously lashing against the hardened nub. The suction of Harry’s mouth seemed to go straight to Draco’s prick, making it
Harry licked the shell of his ear before whispering, “
When Harry saw the boy’s eyes roll back into his head, he wasted no more time.
“It’s about Harry,” Ron said tonelessly.
Harry helped him to his feet and placed his hand on the small of his back.

A cold resolve blanketed him, bringing him back to reality. ”You can let go now.”
Potter.”
“But then I became pregnant with Rose and everything changed. The first time Ron held her, well, he was smitten. You’d be surprised how a child can change a person.”

He wanted
A young Auror on his team, Ender Pierce, was slumped against one of the columns bracketing the front doors. He looked bored, tossing his wand in the air above him and watching it let off sparks before catching it in his hand again.
Draco pressed his cheek to Scorpius’ blond head, glaring up at him. “You keep acting like I can’t take care of myself. I’ve been doing fine on my own, you know.”
It was up to Draco to put on a brave face for his mother and ensure that no matter how dire the situation, he would always trust her to do what she must.
The next hit was harder, his skin stinging afterward. He was mortified to realize that his prick—trapped between him and Potter’s lap—was growing hard again.
“Wow, I’m sorry, kid. All the herbivore Omegas I know are usually sold into sex work or personally acquired as a fuck toy for some depraved carnivore Alpha.” She lifted her knife, pointing at Draco’s stomach. “That womb inside of you is a blessing and a curse.
Even though his father was a successful businessman, he had already squandered away most their fortune away on gambling and other illicit dealings. His mother always made excuses for his father, but Draco knew the truth.
“Harry…”
The pads of his fingers were irritated, fresh blisters already forming.
Harry dragged a stumbling Draco back over to the sofa and gently flung him onto it.
His heart constricted and he burrowed his nose in Scorpius’ soft hair, sighing softly.
Narcissa was on her knees before him, rivulets of tears flowing in continuous streams down her face. She was clutching two handfuls of his shirt, her expression desperate.
Jack looked unconvinced but stepped into his office. “The Malfoy boy stopped by today.”
It wasn’t raining any longer outside and Draco felt his soul breathe a sigh of relief upon seeing Theo and Pansy at the entrance to the stables.
With his hatred burning away any niggling feelings of instinctual protectiveness, he took a long drag of his cigarette.
Something shifted in Harry’s eyes, that infuriating shield quickly erected before he could decipher whatever it was.
Draco shifted nervously on his feet, his cheeks burning.

“W-what are you thinking about?” Draco asked, the alcohol in his blood emboldening him.
With a pained shout, he hurled it at the wall next to the Pensieve. It shattered upon impact, sending small shards of glinting glass flying in every direction.

Harry glanced down and saw that Draco’s bottoms were drenched in his slick, the wet material clinging to his cute, hard little prick.
Did he...not
The skittish rabbit pressed his tiny body farther back against the cage, his long ears pressed flat against his head.
The bed dipped under Harry’s weight and Draco flinched when he settled over top of him. He reluctantly turned to look at up him.
He returned his mouth to Draco’s breast, losing himself to the madness of his heat.
The man gave a derisive snort. “Is that the only word you know,
They both began to eat their breakfast, the food now cold but he didn’t care. Nothing could spoil his mood.
After about ten minutes, he’d left.
Draco thought back to that morning and what Harry had admitted. If he accepted Harry’s offer to be with him, his dream of being independent would just get that much further away.
Draco walked into the room and gingerly lowered himself into the armchair across from Harry, shooting him a dark look.
Wanting nothing more than to see the boy’s pale, flat stomach swell with his seed until the boy was filled with nothing but
Harry let his lips brush against Draco’s sensitive nipple, eliciting a sharp whine from Draco.

His cum hit the back of Harry’s throat, moaning low as he swallowed his rabbit’s semen.
“I’ll have another.”
”I’m right here, sweetheart. Just admiring how beautiful you look. So sweet for Dada. Do you want Dada’s tongue? Tell me.”

on me.”
No matter what he did, the ache in his chest wouldn’t abate and his nipples only seemed to become more swollen as the days went by. He had read that an Omega would need his Alpha’s healing saliva, especially during pregnancy to alleviate any discomfort his body would undergo as it changed and adjusted to accommodate his pup.
He was pissed off.

Harry had thought that maybe it was because of their age difference. Did Draco want someone like that

Unable to help himself, he inhaled the alpha’s scent. Leather, earth, and the faint smell of whiskey. A scent he would always associate with the man before him.
How much he wanted
“Well,” Draco said. “I guess that would be all right. If it will put your mind at ease.”
Jack left, closing the door behind him.
to be parted from his dada.
When Harry didn’t make a move to stop him, he continued his path down his Alpha’s neck, nipping at one of his exposed collar bones revealed by the open throat of his dark button-down.
The whispered plea penetrated Harry’s lust-induced haze, snapping him out of his own instinctual driving need to
Draco reached out with his free hand, his gray eyes beseeching.
Harry looked at Draco and smirked, his broad chest rising and falling with deep breaths.
There was nowhere to run, no one to call out to.
His heats had always been unbearably intense, so his mother had gone through the trouble of acquiring strong suppressants and home-made potions to get him through the worst of it.
”A room
Theo gave a curt nod and helped Draco down from the door of the stall. He walked over and took the reins from Potter, leading the large stallion outside into the drizzling rain.
Roland looked aghast, distaste evident in the flat line of his mouth.
He wanted to mate his rabbit. Breed him, fill him with pups, make him so swollen with his cum that his uterus would overflow with it.
“Mummy loves his baby,” Draco cooed, pulling Scorpius close. Scorpius nuzzled into Draco’s scent gland, snuffling contentedly. Draco glanced up at Harry, giving him a small smile. “Thank you for holding him for a moment, Harry.”
, numbness was preferential over…everything else Draco didn’t think about and
He reluctantly stepped closer, stopping just in front of the man’s spread legs.
The man’s jacket from his dark three-piece suit was missing, his tie loosened around his strong neck and showcasing even more of his tan skin.
He cupped Harry’s face in both of his hands and yanked him forward, crushing their lips together. Harry groaned, the sound fueling Draco’s desire. He pressed his chest flush to Harry’s and wrapped his arms around his neck.
“Draco.”
,” the boy moaned over and over, his hands holding Harry’s head between his legs by his ears.
In the Wizarding World, Omegas often took suppressants or potions to lessen the effects of their heats.
"He's an Omega."
Harry remained silent, still not meeting his seeking gaze. His hands were now clenched into fists at his own sides, a muscle ticcing in his jaw.
No. He just had to admit that he was—

“You must be getting excited, Draco. You’re almost at the end.”
”Octavius, good to see you again,” Ron greeted.
He didn’t want to fight it anymore. He wanted to feel their bond while Harry was
The fact that Draco refused to take anything to alleviate his heat pains because of his worry over his milk being effected...

”No, I’ll give him some of my water. Thank you, Harry.”
“So pretty, baby,” Harry groaned. “You’re always so beautiful when you come.”
who will be begging for my touch, Draco.”
Harry had found himself growing hard due to the sight and the rabbit’s reaction, so he had promptly stopped grooming him.
Pansy wanted a lunch brought to the stable boy, so he had kept his mouth shut about it.
, Harry! Don’t you understand?” Draco angrily swiped at his tears with the back of his hand, still holding a now sleeping Scorpius close with his other hand. “I’m done talking. I’m grateful for what you’ve done for us, but please, leave now.”
Harry smirked, but it disappeared when his eyes dropped to Draco’s hand cupping his swollen stomach.
, his hated inner voice whispered across his mind.
Harry was staring at his stomach, his mouth a tight line.
, Potter? I’m perfectly capable of making my own decisions.”
The rabbit’s scent allowed Harry to gauge his mood. Right that moment, the rabbit was exuding satisfaction and...
It was unnerving that Arlen probably knew all the humiliating details of his captivity and what was done to him. He knew that Arlen himself had been questioned by the Ministry due to his care of Draco while he’d been pregnant.
He had thought that their night together had changed things. When Draco had told his parents that they were only
Then, slowly, further awareness would trickle in. The crushing feeling of his hopeless situation and the anguish he carried in his heart for his mother and her own bleak situation.
Hermione sighed and sat on the sofa. “I can’t keep up with her anymore. She’s like a bullet, that one.”
It was dark out now, the dregs of London’s magical community giving them insidious looks as they passed.
Truthfully, he didn’t need the money. He was more than well off and could retire completely if he chose to. He found he was adept at writing, however, and it kept his mind busy.
“Go now, sweetheart. Don’t make me tell you twice.”
Draco sighed, placing the spoon back into the applesauce container. “I know you’re hungry, love. Do you want something else, is that it?”
Ever since Theo had disappeared, Draco’s body was craving an alpha’s presence. His pregnancy made it even worse. With Harry so close to him, he felt the inane urge to bare his throat.
, releasing Draco’s leg and dropping down to both hands as he continued hammering into him with his cock.
Maybe.
It was infuriating. It was revolting. It was…
The boy was visibly trembling now. He slowly walked over to Harry, his small shoulders hunched. When he stopped in front of him, he wouldn’t look up to meet his eyes.
Draco was stark naked.
Surely Harry was trying to trick him.
Harry smiled, but it was brittle. “When will you realize that there is no escape, Draco? Wherever you will go, I will find you. You are

Harry went completely still.
The boy let out a surprised squeak and scrambled backwards, gracelessly falling off the side of the bed, landing with an audible thump against the floor.
It had happened gradually.
Draco scooted closer to her, his interest piqued. “You mean there was time that Harry was
Harry arched a brow, a tendril of unease curling in his stomach. “Narcissa? What are you doing at the Ministry? Did something happen?”
Draco was still dressed in his work uniform that had several blotchy stains on the front of it from treating a patient that day who had been jinxed to repeatedly sneeze ink.
“Among other things,” Draco admitted, flushing again. “What, you never had pups of your own? No omega waiting for you at home, Potter?”
Harry turned to face him, his eyes devoid of any kindness. “How many of his birthdays were you going to let me miss before you told me the truth?”
The way Draco had reacted to him asking about his pup’s father had been stupefying to Harry.
Draco warily eyed the dildo before picking it up with his newly freed hand. His fingers couldn’t even fully wrap around it, the girth too large for his small hand.
Harry, the bastard, smiled smugly. “What? You said you’ve never been kissed. Shouldn’t your Alpha rectify that?”
Harry needed no further direction. He hooked his fingers into the waistband of Draco’s trousers and briefs and yanked them down, throwing them to the side. Once his trousers were off, it left Draco entirely nude besides his small slip-on shoes.
“Of course, Mione,” Ron said softly, carefully leading her over to their sofa.

who made your body change like this, pet.”
The Auror straightened, his cheeks flushing. “Auror Thorne, Mr. Potter. It’s an honor to finally meet you.”
Draco flushed, the tips of his ears burning. His father always had a way of getting under his skin like no one else could. “I know, Dad, but please listen. We were just—”
Harry would expect what any Alpha would expect of his Omega. To be loyal to him, to be
Sorry for taking so long to update! Hope you enjoy and let me know what you think! 🖤
”What do you say, love? Do you want to stay with...
Draco shook his head as much as he could with Harry holding him by his hair. “I-I’d never let you be the father of my babies. You’re a—“ he hiccuped softly, “m-monster.”
The man pulled him closer, making Draco gasp.
Harry wanted to fucking
to Harry.
Draco’s eyes widened in surprise.
Could it be possible to put the past behind them?
The boy nodded vigorously, his wet ears swaying in the water. He arched his back, opening himself even further to Harry’s eyes.
When Draco dropped to his hands and knees on the bed between his legs and began mouthing at Harry’s covered cock, he almost broke.
Draco felt himself flush, unable to keep eye contact with Harry when he looked at him so intensely.
He tapped his index finger on the table in front of the plate. “Eat.
, and his owner was a man with no empathy or remorse.
The boy would need a bath, but with his aversion to water, he didn’t know how he would get him in the tub.
His nipples had become swollen and had gradually darkened to a deep rose color due to his pregnancy.
“Oh, is that so?” Harry asked, baring his teeth in a mock snarl, making Scorpius squeal with delight.
Everything seemed so…corporeal to him all of the sudden.
“You look well, Draco.”
,” he whispered.
It wasn’t fair to his jellybean to be caught in the middle of this. They were just an innocent pup, reacting to their parents’ combined magic. They didn’t deserve to be used by Harry like a
and a lot of lactation kink 😏
His mum’s pale brows went up. “Well, don’t keep me in suspense, darling. Tell me what’s going on.” She cast a worried glance at their pup. “Is it Scorpius?”
Harry eyes were riveted to the boy’s full lips, imagining them on his own. “Do they feel better today?” he asked, flicking his gaze down to Draco’s covered chest.
“Can I have a good morning kiss?” Harry whispered, still stooping so they were eye-level.
Harry nodded, scrubbing a hand down his face. “Just a long night. I slept on the sofa in my office and didn’t get much sleep. Something I can help you with, Jack?”
“I give you my cock each night, make you come multiple times with it
this.”
Ron cleared his throat, shifting. "That's not just any child, Harry." He turned to look at Harry, wearing a grave expression. "That's the only son of Lucius and Narcissa Malfoy."
Draco’s lips parted in disbelief. “That—that isn’t fair!”
The thought of
He trembled under his Alpha’s unnerving gaze, feeling utterly powerless and small beneath him. His lust-induced haze cleared just enough to allow him to form words.
Ron was an Auror for the Ministry, like Harry had used to be.
Harry was silent for several moments, the steady tick of the grandfather clock and Draco’s dry sniffling the only sound to be heard in the otherwise quiet room.
“Wait!” Draco cried out. “C-can you please t-take me from behind?”
His eyes were light green, the same color as the vines that wrapped around the iron gates of his mother’s garden at Malfoy Manor.
Even if it broke his heart.
Draco always encouraged Scorpius’ affection towards Harry, but never pushed it. He wanted their bond to form naturally, the way it should have been formed from the start.
, exactly? Afraid a rogue breadstick might impale me while I dine?”
Harry pulled back to look at him, silently cursing. “
“Okay,” Draco mumbled, averting Harry’s eyes to hide how needy he felt. “He’s still sleeping with me at night. I don’t breastfeed him as much now. He seems to be doing okay with it.”
When Draco felt fingers intertwine with his own on the sofa cushion next to him, he startled and looked down. Harry held his hand, giving it a reassuring squeeze.
She looked worried.
“Please don’t cry. Forget what I said, just please don’t—
Draco’s smile broadened and he pushed to his tiptoes to attempt to scratch higher behind the mare’s ears. “What’s her name?”
the one here with your
“Do you think I don’t know when you’re fucking touching yourself?” Harry grabbed his wrist and sucked Draco’s slick-coated fingers into his mouth, twining his tongue around his digits. Harry groaned around his fingers and Draco felt a fresh gush of slick between his legs in response.
Draco let out a high-pitched whimper as he began slowly pumping his fingers in and out of his hole, Harry’s long fingers wrapped around his wrist, setting the pace.
It was like a knife to Draco’s heart.
Harry looked younger. His black hair was shaggy and there weren’t any lines creasing the skin next to his eyes. He also had glasses on in the photo, something he no longer wore. What surprised Draco most was the smile turning up Harry’s lips.
He felt—
Draco nodded drowsily, the fuzziness in his head seeming to turn into syrup that was making him feel inexplicably exhausted.
Draco halfway sat up, blearily glancing around the room. “W-where am I?” he asked softly.

Hermione lowered her gaze back to the floor. “He’s been asking for him. Draco, I mean. He’s been asking for Harry. He hasn’t been that coherent in the last several hours, but all he’s asked for is Harry. It could be the drugs in his system, but…”
He felt sympathy for the timid creature in the cage, uncomfortable imagining him being sold as food for a carnivore.
He had ended up burning the magazine to a crisp using his magic.
Draco gave him a wan smile. “You don’t know my father. He can be very persuasive when he wants something to go his way…”
“You could never hold your alcohol well,” Ron sniggered. “I can’t count how many pubs I’ve had to basically carry you out of in our early twenties.”
Harry smiled, but it wasn’t like the photo. It was cold, his green eyes swirling with hate.
He had to tell his parents the truth.

That aside, Harry was still upset over Draco’s dishonesty with him and his own wounded pride at being categorized as a

, crave.
Harry’s callous words make Draco’s post-orgasm bliss shrivel and wilt, his heart clenching at his Alpha’s deliberate cruelty.
, I guess. Do you think that would be okay, Harry?”
His family’s name was the gossip of London presently. Lucius Malfoy, businessman extraordinaire, reduced to a gambling heathen and his sole omega son to inherit nothing.
”Okay,” he breathed. “I’ll wait.”
Finally, he blessedly receded, allowing the Omega part of him take over, his consciousness fading.
and he was suddenly overcome with the irrational urge to grab the man by the face and stare into his eyes. He wanted to drown in those green depths and forget the suffocating grey that that seemed to plague the moors and the manor.
It was early March, and the skies were overcast.
He looked…
When Harry’s eyes had first locked upon Draco’s pink, leaking nipple, he had felt saliva flood his mouth.
“Harry.”
He wanted nothing more than to see Harry again. The only thing that got him through his unbearable heats was the memory of Harry’s mouth, suckling at his breasts and fingering his wet,
him, either. Maybe that was the hardest thing to accept. Even though Harry was his mate and the father of their pup, he now knew the truth.
Draco felt hatred, hatred like he’d never felt before. It surged forth within him, cutting through his pride like a searing knife, burning away any remnants of respect for himself he had left.
Harry knew all too well what it was.
Draco glanced up at him from under his lashes, his pup already asleep at his breast. “All right…as long as it’s no trouble. Thank you, Mr. Potter.”
Harry lifted a hand and pressed the tip of his claw into the boy’s soft cheek. His sweetheart reluctantly turned his eyes, gazing up at him from under his long lashes.
Draco crossed his arms over his chest, his vision swimming with tears. “You’re being so cruel to me, Harry. I know that you know how much I need you. You’re our
Harry sighed and rested his chin in hand, placing his elbow on the arm of the chair, a look of boredom on his face. “I’m waiting, pet. Hurry up before I change my mind and your punishment will be being locked in this room for three days without my touch.”
Harry wasn’t entirely heartless. He still fed the bond to get them through the worst of it. Small, fleeting touches to Draco’s lower back, or a light brush of his lips against Draco’s forehead before they would leave his home each night.
, he thought bitterly.
”Why are they all in their animal forms?” Harry asked, staring down at the cages.
Alpha to help ease his heat pains.
At first, it was like butterfly wings brushing against the inside of his stomach, soft and fleeting. Then, it morphed into dull jabs, tangible and insistent.
“I’ll have to get a highchair for him here,” Harry said. “If he’s going to be over more often now.”
When he dropped lower to clean the rabbit’s genitalia, the rabbit shot to his feet and bounded to the far end of the bed, his hackles raised in discontent.
The scent of the boy’s slick and pheromones only ramped up his own instincts, his clawed hand gripping one of the boy’s thighs and hitching it higher, splaying him underneath Harry.
Harry was asleep, his dark hair sex-mussed and stark against the white pillowcase. The lines by his eyes were smoothed out, his dark lashes resting against his cheeks as he slumbered.
,” Harry moaned, reaching down to grasp his cock and align it with Draco’s wet hole. He grasped one of Draco’s hips and dug his fingers in, plunging into him with one hard thrust.
,” Draco begged hoarsely.
While he had been afraid of their relationship becoming public, Harry seemed to have no qualms about publicly showing his affection for Draco.
For fuck’s sake, he’d only met the boy
“Yes, but you know I like my solitude. Having a pet to care for isn’t high on my list of priorities.”
He startled when Harry suddenly entered the room, shutting the door closed behind him.
a person to that degree—
“Harry,” Draco cried out sharply. “
He trailed off, glancing up at Harry.
“There’s nothing to talk about, Harry. Last night was a mistake. We shouldn’t have done that. You’re dating someone and I’m...”
“I don’t think so, Ginny. I just need some time to…get things sorted, I guess you could say.”
“Mhmm.” Draco pulled Scorpius against his chest, a small gasp escaping him when he felt their bond suddenly open and flood him with Harry’s emotions.
“Harry is Scorpius’ actual father. I’m sorry for keeping the truth from you for so long.”
The boy flinched and sidled up behind him, grabbing at his shirt and letting out a whimper. Harry turned and wrapped his arms around his quivering rabbit, giving him a patient smile.
When Harry released him, he reluctantly lowered his gaze between his legs. Harry’s cock was massive, the thick head sheening with pre-cum.

It was hard to do when the evidence of their reason for their hatred of each other was permanently carved on Harry’s skin.
Draco hugged himself and cast a worried look at the closed door. “I didn’t think I’d have to meet him so soon.”
”Looks like you’re the one who ended up begging, pet,” he taunted.
Maybe that was all he would ever want.
having a child, over time. It always came naturally to you.”
Harry narrowed his eyes. “Oh, is that so? I see you’re here with your friend
At night, Harry tried to make the rabbit sleep in his cage.
Harry’s eyes were narrowed, a muscle ticking in his jaw. Draco noticed his fingers were like a vise around the doorknob. Skilled with concealing his inner monster, Harry’s face was quickly wiped of all emotion. He smiled, but Draco knew it was practiced.
Thinking back to that moment made Draco flush, embarrassed at his unwarranted behavior…
Harry snarled against the boy’s wet hole, finally releasing his hold on his self-control. He jerked himself harshly, coming with his face still buried between the rabbit’s slick-coated thighs. His cum splattered against his expensive rug beneath his bare feet, a barely formed knot surrounding the base of his prick.
Harry was standing over the stove, shirtless and wearing only a pair of dark pyjama pants hanging low on his narrow hips. Draco couldn’t help but admire his strong back from behind.
“Dada just wants to help you, sweet one. Aren’t you cold under there?”
Potter turned to glare at Theo. “I pay you to tend to my horses, not to fraternize with my servants. Don’t let me see you conversing with him again, or I’ll stop the payments to your mother and siblings.”
“Draco,
The sound of the gravel pathway being disturbed made Draco flinch and turn, shock washing over him when he saw who was standing there.

Draco felt damp between his legs, slick starting to seep from his hole. “S-stop, Harry. You’re
,” he whispered sweetly.
It really wasn’t any of his business, anyway.
Draco was just a job to him. An assignment. Nothing more.
"Stop fidgeting, sweetheart."
They had made love several times last night, Harry taking him in so many positions that Draco's cheeks heated thinking about it.
Draco nodded solemnly and watched as Arlen shook Harry’s hand.
He didn’t want to think about who he was becoming anymore. He just wanted to forget about everything.
had ever been in love, or knew what love felt like—
”Dada,” Draco said, dropping his stuffed wolf to reach up with both arms. “H-hold me, Dada.”
“Good morning,” Draco said softly, making himself known.
The emerald flames of the Floo engulfed them for a moment before completely snuffing out, leaving nothing in their wake but an empty spot in Harry’s fireplace.
Harry had changed him out of his tattered clothing when he’d brought him home and put one of his old white dress shirts on him. It was far too big for Draco, the hem hitting mid-thigh.
His heart felt tight inside of his chest, like a tether connected it to the two people in front of him. He knew that the farther away they were, the tighter the tether would constrict. He knew it was silly to feel such strong emotions for them due to the fact that they had only just met, but he found that he couldn’t help himself.
He was in the same bedroom he had been staying in with Scorpius when he’d stayed before.
,” Draco chided, reaching for him, “don’t put your fingers in Mr. Potter’s mouth, love.”
, inebriated from the side effects of the potion.
Harry’s fingers clenched into fists at his sides.
Harry growled and smashed his mouth against Draco’s, shoving his tongue into his mouth. Draco dazedly licked against Harry’s tongue, closing his eyes and losing himself in the desperate kiss, his body still tingling with the remnants of his orgasm.
Harry’s self-assurance wavered slightly. “You’re
Dada!” he shouted, and then, his sweetheart slapped him.
“They loved you, trust me. Are you feeling all right?” Harry pressed the back of his hand against Draco’s forehead, reminding him of the first night they met.
She snorted, her small nose wrinkling. “Only you would be weird enough to call your plant your
, Mummy.”
Harry leaned down and began kissing down Draco’s wet throat, roughly sucking bruises into his skin.
As an Omega, Draco would be able to smell and sense Harry’s dominant presence. It was in their nature.
Draco shook his head, his prick caught between his distended belly and Harry’s hard stomach. His body was on fire, his nipples still dripping and erect. If his Alpha didn’t fuck him, he’d be miserable for the rest of the night.
Once again, Harry’s Alpha pheromones surrounded him, lulling him into a false sense of security. He sniffled and pressed up to his tiptoes, reluctantly nuzzling up into Harry’s exposed throat, his lips seeking out Harry’s sun-kissed skin.
“Feel better, pet?” he whispered against his ear before nuzzling against Draco’s marked gland, playfully nipping at it with his teeth.
without them. He hadn’t shaved since Draco’s departure and didn’t see a reason why he should.
Tears streamed down his face, a choked hiccup escaping him.
Draco placed his hands over his covered stomach, yearning for something that could never be.
And his
Harry shifted under his gaze, his impossibly large cock bobbing between his legs. Draco licked his lips, eyeing the impressive length. It was thickly veined, the head reddened and sheening with pre-cum.
”W-what are you talking about?”
Draco lifted his head to press a chaste kiss to Harry’s lips, feeling his own curl up into a dopey, sated smile.
Draco nodded and allowed Arlen to walk past him, following behind as he entered the hospital.
He wouldn’t betray his wishes again. If Draco wanted him to stay away, he would stay away.
“You won’t have much time.” Harry took Narcissa’s hand within his own, pressing his wand into her quaking palm. He forced her fingers closed around it and stepped back.
In all of his life, no one had ever dared lay a hand upon him. Not even his father. That Potter was planning to punish him by
Draco had bent his legs and spread them, his pink little hole glistening with slick as it clenched and unclenched, seeming to obscenely beckon Harry. Milk from his leaking tits had sluiced down his stomach and past his prick, droplets of it clinging to the curve of his arse.
Even though Harry’s behavior disgusted him, his hole
Perhaps a subtle stiffening of his shoulders or looks that were weighed down with much more than she was able to decipher.
Harry smiled back, trying not to give anything away. “He’s sleeping. He’s about to go through his heat, so he’s been dreadfully tired.”
He was someone.
Harry lowered his upper half until his chest was pressed against Draco’s back, their sweat slicked skin sealing them together.
Draco could smell his own potent pheromones on Harry, heady and thick. His Alpha smelled of him and was
”Like it, do you?” Harry purred.
You know you liked it. 😏
Draco stared at her for a moment before quickly concealing his surprise. He chuckled softly.
slow down.
Still...
“Oh,” he said softly. “A man I knew a long time ago. Before you were born.”
“W-what is it?” Draco asked breathlessly, his gaze snapping up.
“I’m sorry if it’s too direct of a question, Draco…but, what happened with the boy’s Alpha? He should be here, protecting you both and providing you comfort.”
Harry chose to ignore it, resuming his cleaning licks, laving the rabbit’s privates no longer than necessary.
Draco let out a high-pitched whine, delighting in the feel of Harry’s thick cock impaling him and filling him. Harry began pumping into him with shallow strokes, watching him with hungry eyes.
Harry nodded and stepped up to him, making the younger man shrink slightly back, his back hitting the stone column behind him.
Without another word, Harry pivoted on heel and disappeared into the Floo. Draco watched as the emerald flames enveloped him, sealing his mother’s fate with an extinguishing snap that seemed to reverberate throughout his
PLEASE DON’T BE MAD AT ME. The angst was needed! I have a plan.
done to you, Harry?”
More tears slipped down Draco’s face. He wrapped a protective arm around his small stomach.
Scorpius shifted in his bed, emitting a disgruntled whine.
Draco stared vacantly at the wall behind them,  tears continuing to fall from his eyes. He didn’t meet Harry’s eyes before he whispered, “
Harry hurriedly stooped, returning his lips to Draco’s with a low groan, continuing to help him remove his jacket with impatient hands. When he pulled Draco’s jumper overtop his head and threw it to the side, Draco could feel himself redden.
He couldn’t in good conscience keep dating Ginny when his thoughts were consumed by another.

“Take my horse for some exercise and leave us,” he ordered coldly. “Don’t return until I say.”
A muscle jumped in Harry’s jaw. “Do you think I can’t feign affection for you, Draco?”
Because of their bond, it was becoming unnervingly easier to read Harry’s thoughts based on his facial expressions without them actually speaking to each other.
He could feel the rabbit’s nipples against his tongue, the soft little bumps making Harry produce more saliva. The rabbit continued trembling, little satisfied chuffs escaping him.
"Ron, why do you have a child tied to an exam table under the Ministry?" Harry asked, unable to tear his eyes away from the unconscious boy.
,” Draco whimpered, spreading his legs even wider, his face beautifully flushed.
She walked around the kitchen island and brushed past Harry, shooting him a warning look as she passed.
piled on top of his already slowly unraveling emotional state.
“You’re so handsome,” Draco murmured, gazing up at Harry with what he was sure was a dopey, love-sick smile.
“Auror Thorne, could you leave us alone for a couple of minutes? The questions I must ask are questions that Minister Shacklebolt would like to remain unheard by others not currently cooperating in the investigation.”
“Oh, Harry, I don’t know if that’s a good idea—”
Draco chose not to respond, wrapping his lips around Harry’s shaft and flattening his tongue against his frenulum. He licked up to the slit where Harry’s pre-cum was flowing from, wanting to savor every drop.
“I can be there with you when you do it, Draco. Just ask and I’ll be there for you,” he whispered.

, Harry.”
“Said he didn’t have time to give it to you himself. Looked like he’d been crying. Didn’t have the baby with him this time.”
His daughter looked unconvinced, a calculating glint in her green eyes. “Are you telling me the truth?”
Draco looked up at him finally, his gray eyes impossibly vulnerable. “I know you can, but it’s not you I don’t trust. It’s...
With that, he left the room, the door slamming behind him.
They found the cunt.
I kinda just wanted to write this chapter to give you an insight to Harry’s thoughts regarding Draco.
He had written several bestsellers about his experience during the war and as an Auror for the Ministry. His books had been sold worldwide, and he often traveled to different countries to hold seminars and give speeches at different Wizarding schools throughout the globe.
Draco rounded the end of the corridor and entered a spacious kitchen.
His captor’s crimes had garnered a lot of attention, his celebrity status in the magical community shifting when he had confessed. They had deemed him a monster, his actions so deplorable that his books had been pulled and no longer sold.
He knew that it was a risk, what with him being heavily pregnant, but he didn’t want to wait anymore. His mother would understand. He explained everything in the letter. This was the only way his pup could have a future. The only way that they
Draco sighed in relief, pulling Harry’s jacket closed around his shoulders, partly shielding his nursing pup from view. “I’m sorry again for intruding like this. I can probably stay with my friend for a few days. Blaise has his own place now and I know he hasn’t taken a mate yet, so he’ll probably have room for us. At least temporarily.”
Draco reached up and pulled Harry’s head down with both hands, crushing his mouth to his with a low whine.
Harry supposed he could have used a sound dampening charm, but it was too late now.
The man pulled a silver flask from the inner pocket of his black vest and took a swig before tucking it away again.
”My...my parents?” Draco asked drowsily.
Draco almost cried with relief when Harry pulled away from him, standing up from the bed.
It had been of a young man.
“Of course I have,” Draco said, his voice cracking. “I’m just…tired, is all.”
Draco looked up him dazedly. “He asks about you sometimes, Harry.”
Draco hurried to follow her command, sprinting toward where she pointed and opening the door at the back of the kitchen. Just outside, there were several boxes pressed against the side of the house next to the door. He found the bin of potatoes and lifted it, quickly returning back to Pansy’s side.
He suddenly imagined Harry licking his swollen breasts after trying to get his pup to breastfeed and he felt his cheeks grow unbearably hot.
Harry stood, pulling Draco against him. “Leave the begging for when I’m
“Don’t,” Harry cut him off, his tone deadly calm. “
Harry lowered his head and scented him, nuzzling against the creature’s long ears to calm him. “Shh, now, little one. No one is going to hurt you.”
“Do you mind sharing what that little performance was about?” he asked coldly.
He had no other
“I can respect boundaries, Draco. Last night won’t happen again, I promise. Just don’t...”
He was loathed to admit it, but sex with Harry helped the pain. The night before,

want to do, he would need to for the sake of his baby.
Draco giggled, making Scorpius glance up at him quizzically. “I suppose you’re right. Sorry…
“I was thinking,” he said softly, “about how angry I was when I found out the truth about that night at Hogwarts.”
He slapped Harry’s hands away and stepped back, glaring up at him.
. I’m ready to leave now.”
Draco hoped his mother hadn’t witnessed
“What about a kiss for now?” Harry asked.
Harry pasted on a congenial smile. “You flatter me, Auror Thorne. Could you please take me to Narcissa Malfoy’s cell? There’s a few additional questions that Minister Shacklebolt has sent me to ask her. Time is of the utmost importance.”
He thought it might be best to tell his parents at separate times. His father would react the worst, so Draco could only hope his mother’s reaction would be less so.
Draco shook his head, stepping back. “You don’t need to worry about us. I can take care of Scorpius by myself. You’re just like my parents, always doubting my ability to do things on my
He gently placed his hands on Scorpius’ arms, stopping him from smashing the eggs into further oblivion. “Scorpius, you’re being naughty. Daddy worked hard to make this breakfast for us.”
Harry let out a strangled sound, stilling Draco with his hands on his hips. “Not tonight. This is one thing I won’t concede to.” He pulled back to look at him fully. “Will you stay the night, sweetheart? I’ll make breakfast for you both in the morning.”
If only he could banish the erection he had since scenting Draco for the first time. He’d excused himself for a moment to tuck his leaking cock into the waistband of his trousers, but it still hadn’t abated.
It wasn’t just Draco’s resentment he feared.
He’d cast
Draco froze, his eyes snapping open. “W-what?”

His thoughts unconsciously drifted to the hazy, hated memory of Harry fucking him during his heat, speeding up his fingers to match the pace of Harry’s remembered thrusts into his limp body…
His checkups at St Mungo’s felt like a reprieve. Hermione even sometimes accompanied them, and he had grown close to his Healer, Arlen. The kind Alpha was his assigned Healer for the duration of his pregnancy and Draco enjoyed their pleasant chitchat.

“You’re no fun,” Hermione pouted. “You must be so proud, Draco. He’s really beautiful.”
Hermione hugged herself, feeling unbelievably

Go, Harry,
She froze in her hurried movements and turned to face him. Dropping to her knees before him, she took his face between both of her elegant hands and looked into his eyes.
"There's one more thing," Ron said.
He had thought that keeping Scorpius a secret would be for the best, but...
Arlen had told him what to expect with contractions and he was almost sure what he was experiencing was Braxton Hicks. False labor pains, Arlen had said. They were common in the third trimester, so Draco hadn’t told Harry about it.
Harry’s jaw was clenched, his eyes narrowed. “I don’t think that would be a good idea, Draco.”
, the baby,” Draco begged, pressing a protective hand against his distended belly between them.
Harry arched one dark brow. “I don’t think you have a grasp on certain words you carelessly throw about.
It had been his intention, as a carnivore himself, to reign over all species: carnivores, herbivores, and omnivores. His goal was to climb to the top of the food chain by sheer force and he didn’t care about the fallout or ramifications that resulted.
He wondered what atrocities or abuse the small creature had been subjected to to under Octavius’ callous care.
“Can we—we do it?” Draco asked softly, reaching up to card through Harry’s hair with fingers.
(See the end of the chapter for
Harry scooped Scorpius up and set him on his hip, grinning down at him. “We’re friends now, right, Scorpius?”
The skin around Theo’s eyes tightened, his mouth drawing tight.

Draco’s knees felt weak, the pain in his back making it hard for him to remain upright. He inhaled Harry’s scent, his eyes closing as the scent of his
“They were sorted into the same house, you see. This photo was taken when they were in a club together. For Herbology, I believe. It seems Narcissa had a fondness for plants. Well, I’m sure you already knew that.”
The boy was huddled beside the desk his cage was on in a trembling ball, hiding his face from view.
Harry’s darkened gaze met his, sending a shiver down his spine.
, kid.”
“Thank you, Hermione. You look well, too.”
”Thank you, Minister Shacklebolt. The boy will be well cared for.”
All of the exits of the house were magically warded, their invisible barriers impenetrable to Draco, especially with his collar preventing him from using his magic.
...” Harry moaned, his eyes sliding down to Draco’s lips.
Draco shook his head, turning away, but keeping his legs spread.
“It’s…” Draco trailed off, turning to survey the sprawling estate.

Draco crushed his lips to his, a small, needy whimper emitting from him when Harry pulled his Omega against him completely.
At the entrance to the stables stood Master Potter, leading an ebony stallion by the reins.
Harry’s vision returned to normal, the cell at Azkaban slowly filtering in around him.
Maybe if he could grab one, he could—
When Harry passed their pup to him, their fingers brushed, and Draco almost
Maybe that was for the best.
“Ah, Shepherd’s Pie. I’m afraid it’s the only thing I know how to make without completely singeing it. I’m not much of a cook, I’m afraid.”
It would be purely clinical, the only purpose being to sufficiently rid the rabbit’s fur of any dirt and tame his disheveled fur.

His narrowed gaze slid down to where Theo’s hands were still resting around Draco’s waist.
Draco’s cloying scent had only grown dizzyingly sweeter the past few days, his body readying for his impending heat.
Draco’s tears spilled over, sliding down his cheeks in warm streaks. “I-I

He was almost bent completely in half, the position not that comfortable, but he couldn’t seem to really care. All his focus was on Draco’s expression and needy gasps.

Draco shrugged. “I’m sorry, Blaise. My mind just wandered for a moment thinking about how Scorpius was doing without me.”

Scorpius, he would.
Draco snapped the loose thread from his shirt and set his teacup on the side table next to the sofa. He slid his hand into her lifeless one, entwining their fingers.
She had hexed one nosy reporter from the Prophet after he’d tried scaling the lattice in her garden in an attempt to get a photo of Draco.
Harry left the room but returned only moments later, his mask of indifference firmly in place. He walked over and untied one of Draco’s wrists and stepped back, tossing something onto the bed in front him.
Draco drew his brows together, noticing that Harry’s words sounded slightly slurred. “Are you…are you drunk?”
“It was lovely to see you, Narcissa,” Harry said curtly before reaching over and ruffling Scorpius’ hair. “I’ll see you later, kiddo.”
Draco knew how he looked.
Hermione studied him for a moment, her deep brown eyes assessing. “Maybe that’s something you should discuss with Harry. Your mother’s past is something you’d probably be more comfortable learning about from your mate.”
“Are you the new servant they brought in from London?”
He was surprised to find copies of the some of the books Harry himself had written on the shelves.
Especially bonded mates.
His daughter pouted, her green eyes flashing with defiance. “I tried but he wasn’t
“Why didn’t you tell me your nipples were aching? I could have assisted,” Harry purred wickedly, snaking his hand up the hem of Draco’s jumper, rubbing his fingertips against one of his sore nipples.
Draco had let out a derisive snort and had shoved the book back on the shelf, disgusted with himself for even being curious.
enjoy it.
Draco stared up at her, wavering. He so desperately wanted any type of human connection since he had arrived at the manor. It was a dreadfully lonely place and its oppressive atmosphere seemed to be closing in on him as the days went by.
“You guys do look tired…” Draco said softly, trying not to let his despair creep into his voice.
Maybe if he had been ugly, it would have made his hatred burn that much hotter.
for you,” Harry said acerbically, his voice laced with contempt.
His rabbit slowly lifted both his arms, casting Harry an expectant but trusting look.
When he looked to see Harry’s reaction, he wished he hadn’t.
When they came upon the shop they had agreed to meet Ron and Hermione at, Harry came to a halt. Ginny cast him a questioning glance, her hand already on the door handle.
His mother arched a brow, regally crossing her legs. “Honestly, Draco, do you think I’m that oblivious?” She paused to take a graceful sip of her tea, giving Draco a sly wink over the rim of the floral-printed ceramic rim. “Believe it or not, I was young and in love once, too.”
Arlen smiled at Harry like nothing was amiss. “Your pup is quite active, Mr. Potter. You’ll have your work cut out for you.”
Draco’s embarrassment quickly morphed to indignance. “I’m not an idiot!”
She had Ron’s red hair and Hermione’s inquisitive umber eyes.
Draco clenched his teeth and raised the knife, pressing the tip against Harry’s heart.
The manor was a stone fortress of gloom. The tall, thin windows that covered the front of the manor were all darkened, the glass reflecting the grey skies above and nothing else.
”Still mad?” Harry said, his voice rough. “Then I’ll have to apologize better...”
His eyes traveled down, stopping on their nursing pup. For a brief moment, Harry’s eyes lost their cruel glint, his shields coming down. All of his emotions were suddenly there, clear and heart-wrenching.
Like some sort of spell had been broken, Harry’s features hardened, making the scarred skin over the right side of his face grow taut.
Harry smiled,
“I wanted to ask something of you.”
“That’s it, show me. Show me how you make yourself feel good, sweetheart,” Harry urged, still fucking into Draco’s hole with fast, wet slaps of his hips.
He lowered his head and lightly kissed down Draco’s throat, his lips hovering over his marked gland. “Do you want me to act as if we’re lovers, is that it?”
Draco nodded, not meeting Potter’s cold gaze and keeping his eyes on the shiny black leather of his riding boots.
In the end, he’d mentally chastised himself for even wavering on that decision.
Draco hesitantly rested against the back of the sofa, pulling up his jumper a few more inches.
Before he could scamper further back, Harry plucked him up with one hand by the scruff of his neck. He pulled out the tiny struggling creature, holding him to his chest with both of his arms.
He wanted to press his nose into the pale column of his delicate-looking throat and
What made it even worse was that Harry was
Draco hesitated for a moment before lifting Scorpius up, offering him to Harry.
“S’ok,” Draco mumbled, smiling due to Harry’s touch.
”Dada...” the boy said shakily, his ears languidly drooping.
He wanted nothing more than to crawl into the narrow bed and sleep for decades. The darkness of the back of his eyelids would be preferential to the all-encompassing grey that seemed to haunt the manor.
Harry was putting them above everything else. As a good father would, as a good
He angrily snapped the Prophet closed, slamming it down on the table.
He was glad that Master Potter had gone away on business. The last thing he needed during this adjustment period was the older man mercilessly taunting him.
He barely noticed when his knitted cap slipped off of his head when Harry burrowed his fingers into his hair, tugging gently as they kissed.
“Please, Harry.
“Hopelessly,” Harry said. “I’ve never loved someone as much as I love Draco Malfoy.”
Harry slid his hands under Draco’s armpits, lifting him. He turned and sat on the bed, placing Draco face forward on his lap.
When the red haze cleared, he looked at his innocent rabbit. He was spread out on his bed, trembling but still obediently holding his shirt up to expose himself to Harry.
Eater?” Draco asked, unfamiliar with the term.
“That we’re your...family?”
Draco dropped his hand, glowering up at him.
The past week, he had convinced himself that his strong emotions for Draco would fade. Their bond could be broken. It was just going to take time.
His daughter stood behind him, a furrow between her dark brows. “Why are you crying?”
of him.
”Um,” Draco said eloquently. “Sorry for taking so long, Roland, I ran into—er, an old friend.”
A couple of hours later, the rabbit had awoken from his nap.
“Right,” Harry said hollowly. “We’re friends.”
Draco lowered the letter, his tears blurring his vision.
Octavius let out a derisive snort. “Eh, if you’re serious about wanting him, I’ll also let you know that he’s an Omega. You’ll have to deal with his heat cycles, messy business that is.”
At night, it took all of Harry’s willpower to not go to the needy Omega.

Harry next to her, crossing an ankle over his knee. “She’s cute.”
“You’re so much smaller than I was. I was huge, even early on.”
now.”
Draco dropped his gaze to his feet, uncertain about disobeying orders in the first week of living at the manor. “I don’t know, Pansy…”
Harry stared down at them, the primal need to protect and provide for the Omega and his pup overtaking him again. He scooted closer on the sofa, his Alpha instincts clamoring at him to close the distance short distance between them.
“Who is the young man in the portrait upstairs? The one in the child’s bedroom.”
Draco felt a flare of irritation at Harry’s callous words. “My mother home schooled me. When my magic manifested, she did her best to teach me how to control and hone it.”
,” the man angrily snapped.
He felt Harry go rigid beside him.
Though they shared their bodies, they never shared their minds. Harry was always cryptic and cold, not wanting to divulge more than necessary about his past.
Harry immediately stopped rubbing.
A fresh gush of breast milk exploded across Harry’s tongue, making him moan. He began sucking, drawing out even more of the sweet liquid with strong pulls from his mouth. He dazedly realized that Draco was undulating atop his lap, drenching his thigh with warm slick from his hole.
“Master Potter, of course,” she sneered, her black plait swinging behind her as they ran.
With a guttural groan, he came inside of his rabbit. His knot was fully formed, but he was just able to barely able to hold back from forcing it inside of his rabbit. He had shoved himself as deep as he could, not wanting any of his cum to escape from the boy’s body when he pulled out.
It might be the last time he would be able to.
you as I do.”
Draco shook his head, clutching the wine bottle tightly to his chest.
as he’d asked him to call him before.
Draco’s pleading was cut off with a sharp gasp when Harry released his grip on one of his legs and shoved two of his fingers into his hole.
Harry slid his hand down the boy’s hips and lower, past the curve of his arse. He pressed his fingers against Draco’s gushing hole, letting out a low groan.
I know you’re all clamoring to see what happened between Harry and Draco in the past and I promise you, IT’S COMIN’.
Draco snorted delicately. “You mean telling him about Ministry officials coming to the manor?”
Harry released his nipple with a

Maybe he could just finger the boy a bit, get his scent on his fingers so—
Pansy sighed and took the bottle of wine from him, setting it on the island along with her knife. “It’s okay, kid. Do you want to help me make the desert?” When Draco remained silent, she said, “I’ll let you hold the mixing bowl.”
Even now, the boy was emitting an ungodly amount of pheromones. The cloying scent filled the bedroom, pushing in from all sides.
Jack had been teasing him all week about his changed behavior at work. Jack knew that Harry’s improved attitude was most likely because of his renewed relationship with Draco after working things out.
