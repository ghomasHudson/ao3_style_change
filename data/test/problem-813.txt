Faintly, he registers his hands are shaking again. He stares at them in morbid fascination, deciding to focus on that rather than the fact that his robes are all crumpled on the ground. Gently, he intertwines his fingers, squeezing them together and breathing deeply until they remain still.
I will respond to your comments, I swear I will, but the last week or so has been a bit of a rough patch and I haven't done much at all. I only actually wrote the majority of this chapter today. My mood is improving rapidly, ignoring the lack of sleep last night, so I should be back on schedule and writing out new stuff soon.
“Gobsy didn’t think where else to go, sir.” The house elf mumbles. “Mister Harry Potter should not be in young master Draco’s bedroom. Mister Potter should follow Gobsy now, sir, yes he should.”
Well. Seems that decision has been made for him.
Luna pulls her wand from behind her ear and starts fiddling with it. Draco had never told her he could make paintings real. It’s a skill most wizards and witches struggle their whole lives to do. Only a rare few are born with the natural potential, and even fewer of those can paint well. It’s why moving paintings are such an expensive, rare thing. Most people use photographs these days.
“Come onnnn, Draco! The train’s stopped. You’ll have to get off eventually!”
“I talked to Theo a while back.” Harry starts, eyes trained on the stars hanging in the sky.
“Your grandfather, and his father, and his father before that would be so proud. Our family would shine brightly up there, in the stars in your hair. My little dragon, finally free to fly, not weighed down by the harsh world outside. There would be no need to make you learn to survive. No monsters up there to catch you. The moon in your hand and the stars in your hair.”
Oh Merlin. Could this day get any more bizarre?
Draco shakes his head in exasperation, giving Harry a quick kiss on the cheek before following Pansy. Oh, well. Harry sighs, walking into the hall by himself. The house elf drawing can be quite clingy sometimes, so Draco usually carries a sketch of a room in his pocket for Jaebo to drop into when he needs him.
“Right.” Harry sighs, resigning her to speak this over with Luna. When Hermione had confessed to him her feelings about Pansy, he hadn’t been too surprised. He’s seen the way she looks forward to every F.H.E. meeting like it’s a lifeline. Luckily, neither of them have had any delusions about Pansy feeling the same way for Hermione, so these conversations are few and far inbetween.
Draco shakes his head slightly. He doesn’t want to hear it. If he listens, he has to think. If he thinks, then he has to feel. So he doesn’t listen, and he doesn’t think, and he doesn’t feel the waiting surge of pain.
- E.D.
Nott’s chair screeches as he stands sharply, footsteps pacing on the wood as he walks around the hut, uncomfortable silence prickling the back of his neck. Harry’s fingers clench around his cup, teeth stabbing into his bottom lip as he tries not to let out a choking sob. He fails.
(The redness, gaping open, blood and bones and muscle and Harry can’t fathom how he could ever have thought he’d seen everything. Bodies. Blood. Death. They’d hung around him for years, leaning over his shoulder, invading his life, but this is a thousand times worse. Draco’s eyes, blank and glassy, staring up-)
Black shrugs, flicking the first one open. Abruptly, blue smoke floods across the open page, swirling into an image, until a fully fledged motorcycle forms on the page, driving around by itself in the air as a voice bursts out. Draco narrows his eyes at the smoke as the voice starts narrating the history and parts of the vehicle, and… yes. It’s the smoke he uses, the one they all learnt in third year to pay attention in history classes.
Boot, Terry
"Draco! I would know that sigh anywhere. Let me in! Pleaaaase?"
Theodore had been on trial before Draco, charged with a number of crimes. During the war he had fought on Vo- on the Dark Lord’s side, fought, not hid in Hogwarts like most. His father had brought him to the forefront, just like Draco’s had, wanting the power and money. It seems Theodore has paid a similar price.
Wetness on his cheeks. The wind in his hair, on his face. The skin under his hand. The bark on his back. The chirping of birds in the trees, the whistle of wind through his teeth, the rustling of the leaves above. His heart begins to slow as he rubs his eyes and focuses again, panic seeping away gently.
“I see him! Draco!”
Woah. Woah. This is getting far too weird for Pansy’s liking. Time to back out of this situation real quick. “Ok.” She squeaks, backing up and fleeing the common room as fast as she can. Phew. What was that about?! They were having a completely normal conversation, and then suddenly Blaise had to agree with her. Agree. Like they hadn’t been at each other’s throats for the past seven years about that precise topic.
Draco reels back, eyes widening in shock and panic. That doesn’t make sense. It can’t make sense. This is a dream, just a stupid dream, because who would kill him? Who would dare kill him on Hogwarts’ grounds?
~ ~ ~ ~ ~
"Sorry, Headmistress, but I don't really fancy having to sleep with a wand in my hand and a thousand wards around my bed. Is there no way we can join the seventh years? There must be enough room in Slytherin house!"
The next tug brings him to his feet, and suddenly he can see a doorway ahead of him. Wavering, whispering, gauzy and faint, but definitely an arch to somewhere.
“In the last thing you remember, were you fighting someone?”
“Don’t we all.”
“Draco! Stop!” He called him Draco. “You didn’t kill- you just didn’t. Calm down, you aren’t thinking straight.”
For a moment, Harry wonders why Remus doesn’t just use magic. Then he remembers how horrible magically heated food is, and appreciates having house elves around to do the cooking, since Hogwarts functions without electricity.
“The mistress would like that, mister Harry Potter, sir.” Gobsy croaks, managing a small smile.
Pansy leaps up from the seat in a second, wand out and pointed at the weasel’s neck. Silence washes over the common room like an icy wave, hands sneaking wands from sleeves or pockets. “And what is that supposed to mean, you rat?! Are you implying that you, in any way, have more right to feel things than us? Is that what your idiotic statement is about? Because, if it is, my dear friend, I will have no hesitation in-!”
Harry scarpers, heart thumping. Out of the frying pan, straight into the fire.
“Go, boy!” A portrait suddenly barks from beside him. “Pick up those feet and get running!”
“It could be a few days for all we know.”
“In your dreams, Potter.” Theo mumbles as he lights up his cigarette, dropping the packet onto the table and turning to his books. “If you can find this asshole, maybe I will, actually.”
Far, far, far below lies the ground. A tree, barely a speck in his vision, is waving at him, almost encouraging him to jump down. He stumbles back, stomach twisting and knotting and boiling as a memory he had repressed surges up.
Again, any ideas, please leave in the comments section.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
“Great! Great! That’s amazing!” Harry breathes, buzzing with excitement, and launches forward to hug Draco tightly. His arms are strong around him, comforting in a way Draco’s never felt from anyone else, and he thinks that if he can date Harry bloody Potter, he can do anything.
“To what?” Luna asks innocently, making Ginny burst into another round of giggles.
Not sure what I was doing with this one, but it kinda went ok.
Draco frowns slightly. When had Harry been speaking to Theodore? Did… did they get together after Draco died? Is that why Harry hasn’t talked to him about the kiss yet? Oh Merlin. His stomach clenches, nausea setting in. He was such an idiot to do that! In front of everyone! They’re probably all laughing at him, being so stupid, knowing that he doesn’t have a chance with Harry because - because, well, he’s Harry bloody Potter!
Harry shrugged. "Dunno. But it's just been building up."
"Uh-I-Uh-OK."
"Yes, Master Draco," you say.
_______
"Well, desperate times," Hermione said. She claps her hands together. "Let's get started then."
"Go to bed," Harry ordered. "We'll be up later."
You know you are at least good at that and you fall to your knees. "So fucking eager," Draco said.
Harry and Blaise switched places, but instead of performing oral overtop of the chastity belt, Harry placed his hands on top of Draco's legs to get him to stop his frantic humping of the air.
"You guys new here?" A man asked, sidling up to them. He was wearing boxer briefs and had his name tag on his chest, "Ted, Bisexual, Dominant to Amy." Amy walking behind him, attached to him by a leash and collar around her neck. She was fully nude. Her nametag said ,"Amy, bisexual. sub to Ted. Safeword is Crackerjack."
"Once your punishment is over," Harry said. "You need to stand there and think about what you've done."
In the next room, Madame Kat had them fill out nametags. Harry's said, "Harry, bisexual. Dominant to Draco." Draco's said, "Draco, bisexual. Dominant to Harry. Safeword is 'checkmate.' Permission to touch from my dominant only."
"I don't know."
"Answer me!"
"It means I've deserved every bit of punishment you've given me this weekend, and It means I will do better in the future!"
"How would you like me?" Draco asked Harry.
"Yes Master Draco, I know. I will try my best. I only want to please you both."
"So what are you going to do about the face cream?"
He was still on his knees, hands cuffed behind him, and he obeyed her by leaning forward and laying his head down, his ass now presented high in the air. The Dom grabbed a belt and gave him ten whacks across his ass. It really stung being on top of the bruises from the previous night, as well as the hairbrush welts from the first Dom. She then ordered him to stand and he did, facing her.
"I just want your hands on me," Draco plead. "Just touch me."
"You aren't supposed to get wet from punishment," he said. "Harry and I are going to spank you hard."
Harry paused, his eyes widened. "You want me to beat you?"
Draco grinned and got right to work.
They both look blissed out as they come together, Draco fisting his own cock to the same rhythm Harry has set with his pounding.
"I've been told," he whispered as he plunges a finger into your already dripping wet pussy. "And your cunt is so pink and pretty. I was looking at it last night when you were all tied up and i could see it dripping from my seat."
Just like that, the Dom was breathing hard and had scooted herself closer to Draco, so his nose was rubbing her clit.
Finally Harry raised his hand and it landed with a slap across Draco's backside. "One!" Draco called out. It...actually wasn't that bad."
"You come in the next thirty seconds, or you lose the right to come the rest of the weekend," Draco said.
Harry finishes the breakfast, just as Draco puts down the paper. "Anything new in the world?" Harry asks. You grab two coffee mugs and pour it for the Masters.
"Yes, sir," Draco said miserably.
"Yes Master Draco," you say. "I am a slut." You know that dress made you a slut. You hope you get to wear it again.
You can please them by cleaning, or at least with Master Draco. He sets you to cleaning the kitchen after breakfast. And not just of the breakfast mess, but he wants the wooden kitchen table polished and the floors wiped. He doesn't believe in mops, no, you'll be cleaning the floor on your hands and knees.
"Yes Master Draco." You scurry up the stairs and go to the closet. There is the tiny blue dress, the one you wore that first weekend with the Masters when they had food delivered. You remember with relish how it felt to be stared at so wantonly by the delivery driver.
Ted cleared his throat angrily and Draco and Amy looked up at the two of their doms with a deer-in-the-headlights looks. His hips stilled.
"Yes, please," Harry said, though he was sure they could find a way to entertain themselves in the first room alone.
You clean up the tea, and make dinner for your Masters with the instructions that were written for you by one of the Masters. You aren't a great cook, which is something they know, and they said earlier that making meals would not be an all the time thing.
She and Draco returned, Draco carrying a platter full of saucy chicken breasts over sauteed asparagus, and Amy carrying bowl of salad. The two subs got busy serving their doms before adding some food to their own plates.
"Right," Harry nodded. He went to the door and held up his wand, "Accio chastity belt."
"Oh," Draco sat up straighter. "I don't know Harry, that seems inappropriate for a sub to spank his dom."
"Well?" Harry demanded loudly.
"Let me see your ass," Harry said.
"On your hands and knees," Draco orders.
"Very good," Harry says, his voice clipped with authority. "Yes, well I hope you're prepared to spend the weekend completely nude."
"All right," Harry said. He took off his cloak and handed it to Draco, who hung it up. Then Draco handed Harry the glass of brandy he'd had waiting for him. It must be important, because Draco knew Harry didn't like to be bothered with big talks after work.
"Oh babe," Harry said, giving Draco's cock a light jerk, "We both know that's never going to happen." Harry turned Draco around and planted a smoldering kiss on his lips. "Get naked," Harry demanded.
"It means, you were spoiled rotten by your parents. You ruled over Malfoy Manor with all your desires and whims and your parents catered to them. That's not how it should be in our house, in our relationship. You go over to my friends house, and you act like you're the king. You order them around, complain about their meals, and it's not very nice. You never learned how to be nice."
"Sure," the Dom said enthusiastically. "How do you want to do it?"
"How long did it hurt?" Harry asked, massaging Draco's ass, and working his hands around the front where he found Draco's cock at nearly fully erect. "Not long," Draco admitted.
"Faster," Ted said, and Harry set a fast pace that Ted matched. Harry reached down and grabbed Ted's large hard dick and began stroking. Their bodies were entwined, humming as one. Harry heard a woman who was only inches from him say to the woman who was going down on her, "Oh god, I'm coming!" and that was all it took for Harry and Ted to both come in the same resplendent second. The semen burst from Ted's cock so hard it got Harry right in the face, but he didn't care. He kept thrusting his way through his orgasm before slowing down and pulling out of Ted.
_______
"Anyway," Hermione continues, "We had an attitude issue with Ronald this week and you know me, I just don't have the strength for a strong physical punishment, so I'm hoping my two favorite male Doms can punish him into shape."
Harry took time to stretch and shower before heading downstairs where Draco was working on scrambling eggs. He had a platter of bacon and a bowl of fruit already situated on the dining room table. "It looks great," he said to Draco, planting a kiss on his cheek. Complimenting a submissive was so important to creating a safe environment for them.
1- Every day, Harry will give at least one cleaning chore for Draco to do. It must be done by the time Harry gets home from work.
Harry positioned himself behind Draco and cast a quick lubricating spell. He slipped a finger inside Draco's waiting asshole and moved the finger around and in and out. "Yes!" Draco yelled. "Oh Merlin YES YES YES!"
Blaise took the next turn and Draco said "Three!"
Draco stood in front of him.
"What do you tell Harry?" He turned her roughly to him.
"You like me and that's all that matters," Draco said.
"Harry is ordering Draco to spank him!"
"We have to tell them, don't we?" you ask.
Draco smirked, and the Dom quickly turned him around and let loose five hard smacks on his back. "Don't get an ego about it," she ordered.
You nodded your head, and he slapped his hand across your ass. You jump. "That's nothing to be proud of, you know," he said. "Being such a whore that even a wooden chair makes you wet." He sticks a finger roughly in your pussy and pulls it out, "Suck your juices," he demands and you suck on his finger. Your pussy felt so good with even just one thrust from his finger, but it left you craving even more.
"Yes sir," Draco said, sitting at the table. He winced at the pain the chair caused his bottom, but didn't ask to stand or for a cushion. He immediately got to work writing his lines. Harry watched over him, before heading back to his own study to finish his work.
"Don't come like this," Harry said.
"Yes, Master Draco," You say, and you fall to your knees and kiss both of them on their feet. They seem nervous and you want to show right away that you prostrate yourself before them and will do whatever they bid, no matter the depravity.
Harry nodded and licked his lips. "One more day," he said. "Tonight we sleep, tomorrow you'll get some more punishment from me, and if you take it well, I'll let you come tomorrow night."
"We had sex," you whisper.
"That's good, because today is all about cocksucking. You're going to sit around looking pretty until one of us wants head and you're going to do it."
This wasn't punishment for Draco, who loved nothing more than having his mouth stuffed with cock. Harry knew what an excellent experience this Dom was going to have with Draco's pert little mouth stretched around that massive phallus. And sure enough, the Dom's eyes went wide with surprise as Draco opened wide and took him nearly to his hilt. Just watching Draco work his mouth over the massive piece of meat in front of him really did it for Harry. The cocksluts were still working Harry over with their tongues and their words. While Harry felt his own balls being licked from taint to front, he watched as Draco used his finger to press on the Dom's taint while he deep-throated his cock.
Harry let him sob for a few moments, as the red marks on his ass turned to raised welts.
Draco was naked at this point and pulled the chastity belt up. It fit snugly around his cock and balls.
"Yes Master Harry." You sit up straighter in the stool and widen your legs are far as you can so they have a perfect view of your perky and pink pussy. God, you're horny and you want one of their cocks inside you. You long for it, but you know that they are the ones who get to decide about what goes deep into you. They say nothing as they eat and look at you. You feel so vulnerable and observed. And frankly, a little slutty sitting there naked and splayed open for two men whose cocks you desire.
"Harry is the ultimate authority in this house ans Draco is to submit to him!"
"Yes Master," you say. "Isn't that why you dressed me like this?"
"Get undressed and put it on," Harry ordered.
The words hurt less now. Now that Draco had set his mind to simply surviving, being called a slut, being told he was worthless wasn't that bad. It's like the words washed over him. The hurt came out with his tears. Because of the pain in his body, he was crying at more and more intervals now.
"Yes Master Harry," you say. Though you hope they know that you don't mind punishments for no reason. You are a sub, after all, and if one of your Masters feels like doing something that will hurt you, he is free to do anything until you use your safeword.
"Yes Master Draco. How may I first serve you?"
The dom looked satisfied and pulled hard on the clamps, making Draco's nipples stretch in front of his body. He let go of the dildo in his mouth and howled in pain. The Dom slowed for a moment, waiting to see if he'd use his safeword, but he didn't. His breath was shaking and coming in quick spurts. The dom let go of the clamps and they dangled back onto Draco's chest.
Harry threw the covers off and pulled his pants down. "You may come as long as I can too. I want you to fuck me."
9-Harry reserves the right to add other rules to the list, but must talk it over with Draco first.
Harry watched for a moment before he straddled Draco's face. "Suck me," he ordered and Draco immediately opened his mouth to allow Harry's dick in. Since Harry had just come thirty minutes earlier, it took a little longer for him to get hard, but Draco who was so good as sucking cock, didn't complain at all. So while Blaise's mouth was busy on Draco's cock which would never come as long as the belt was on, Draco was busy licking and sucking on Harry's cock that was slowly hardening in his mouth.
It worked well for a few years, the relationship between you and your Dom. You were one of his many playthings, but he wanted more. He wanted a 24/7 sub, and you always knew you wanted to be a sub on the weekends -- and not even every weekend at that. So your Dom tossed you to the curb.
"My clothes?"
Draco's ass had never been more achy. It was bruised, it was welted and it was bright red. So when he was on his fifth Dom of the night to please, it didn't make him happy to be fucked in the ass. He was so raw on his asscheeks, that the rubbing against the Dom's front side was a truly terrible pain. And on top of that, he was facing Harry who  had the Dom's female sub on her knees and was fucking her from behind. Draco just really wanted Harry. He didn't want this Dom, who frankly wasn't all that great at sex. He started crying.
Draco returned with the roast and cut it at the table, filling Harry's plate first. He scooped out some potatoes and carrots and set them on Harry's plate. He waiting while Harry took his first bite, then began serving himself. This wasn't even a rule they'd put into place. Draco just instinctively knew to wait for Harry to take a bite before serving himself.
"Shut up and lick," the Dom said.
"Swallow it all," Harry commanded and watched with awe as Draco did, sucking every last bit out of the tip of Harry's cock, before pulling off.
Once dinner was finished, Harry and Ted mocked Draco and Amy for the food stuck to their faces and made them look in the mirror to see what kind of mess they'd made of themselves. Draco and Amy were sent into the kitchen to clean. Only this time, they were both wearing their Madame Kat's chastity devices.
"Can one of you get the cage? I have a hard time, carrying both it and the trunk" he said to the others. Ron snatched the empty Cage, accidentally scattering a bit of sawdust and owl droppings around the room.
After they got Harry's Stuff back, they days seemed to melt. Draco went quieter and quieter as the day of his hearing drew nearer. Harry saw with worry that he tended to draw himself away from everyone, hiding out in small places, just staring at one point and not talking. He even seemed to draw away from Harry. The only times when he seemed to absolutely not want to be alone, was at night when he tugged to Harry so close and held his hand so firmly as if he feared the boy might vanish at every second. He had also started to get more frequent nightmares again, something that had somewhat subsided during the past weeks, though not vanished.
Hello people, It's Saiyasha. I deeply, deeply apologize for the very long wait! 'bows down' but I ad something that we in Germany call a krea-tief. It is a wordplay. 'kreativ' means creative. And if you spell if krea-tief, it stands for 'creative down/low' because 'tief' in German means 'down' or 'low'. So what I wanted to say is, I was pretty stuck and I do apologize If this chapter isn't as good as the others were maybe, but I have the distinct hope that it is going up-hill from here on. Thanks for sticking around
The night before the hearing, Draco didn't sleep at all. He only had to close his eyes for a second, but they flew open again at once, as if he could see images inside his had, whenever he didn't see anything else. Harry tried again with the Patronus, but it was no use. Not even the cumulation of good feelings and Hope could help Draco get past his terror and anxiety. Harry, of course, hadn't slept much either, though he had dosed of every now and then, only to be wakened shortly after by a start or a shudder when Draco's eyes had accidentally fallen again.
The blonde told Mr. Weasly everything, even though his voice trembled a bit when he spoke about what he nearly did to his father, but Mr. Weasly just put a hand don his shoulder and squeezed it once as if to say 'It's okay, I understand you' and Draco took a deep breath and went on.
"I want it to end.", he said after a while. "No matter what, I want it to ed. I can never go back to that again." he took a deep breath. Then he looked down at Harry, beaten, so up giving that his Heart throbbed painfully.
"Come on, love, we should make ourselves a bit more suitable for breakfast, don't you think?" He smiled and they stumbled towards the bathroom, hurrying to get there before the twins, who tended to need very much time in there every morning, what Harry blamed on the fact that they were doing nonsense half the time. When they had dressed, showered and brushed their teeth, they went back down, where Mrs. Weasly had piled an enormous amount of Pancakes on a Platter and was now making scrambled eggs, bacon and toast. When everyone had arrived, Harry saw with relief that Draco was not forcing himself to eat something as he usually did, so that no one got to worried, but rather ate three helpings, with so much joy as if he hadn't eaten in days. And if Harry thought back, that probably was the case. In the end he hadn't been able to keep anything in long.
"Imperio!"
"Draco, I have to ask this question but if you want, you can nod or shake your head. Did your father rape you?"
The addressed smiled. He had sat down on a lavish Four-poster bed, with black silken sheets. The room really knew what was needed... The Chamber was lit dimly by softly flickering Candles on the walls which where a Heavy dark brown, which Harry distinctly felt was real Mahogany. Next to the bed was a small drawer, fully equipped with everything they could wish for...
"Why don't you?", he just asked.
"That is what Mrs. Weasly called it... I didn't know it was called that." He added. Madame Bones turned to Harry.
At that time the door banged open. Amelia Bones came hurried in, together with the rest of the committee, looking livid.
"Now look what you've done, you great ape! You are as stupid as you are fat!" He had hissed and stomped out of the room.
"Yeah. Let's go home."
"What are you sorry for, Draco?" In his heart, Harry wasn't sure that he wanted to know, but he could see that it would be important for Draco to say it.
"Draco..." Harry was uncertain how to start. He didn't want Draco to be afraid any more. He didn't want to have to remind him about what happened. But he had to.
"Draco, it's me. Harry, you remember? I'm not going to hurt you, I promise. I just want to give you these clothes. Don't you wanna be warm and dry again?"
"Not these, she can't." She said in a low voice. "I know that kind of whip that made these wounds. It was used a lot back then..." Her Voice got lost a bit and Harry knew that she meant the time when Voldemort had been in power, before Harry's birth. Mrs. Weasly blinked and returned to the Present. "It is a magically enhanced Whip, called the 'Flesheater'. It's wounds heal very slow and are not to be mended by magic. But they never leave scars, which makes it impossible to see that it has been used once the wounds have healed. It was a very popular instrument of torture back in the day." She shuddered slightly.
"Who will you send it to?" asked Draco carefully, when he saw that Harry took a Parchment out of the Drawer. Harry looked at him. He had planned to write to the Weasly's but now started to think if it was such a good Idea.
"She means well, you know.", he finally said. "I mean, she can be a bit fussy but..."
Five Minutes later, they stood in front of one of the great fireplaces in the Atrium. Draco had become very still again, but he didn't look as scared as he had done before the hearing, more worried and a bit unsure.
When he finally went after him, he had to search for a while until he found him in a small corner, at the end of one corridor, underneath the window, his face on his knees and his arms around his legs, forming as tight a ball as he could. It looked like he was scared to fall apart if he let go. Harry could see his shoulders twitching and knew even without seeing his face that Draco was crying.
The next two weeks seemed to pass in a kind of haze. The other Weasly's found out out the trial eventually, but nobody talked about it. A few Reporter came by and tried to ask Draco for an Interview until Mrs. Weasly hung a Note on the Door:
"Well, in that case, I should tell you from Mafalda Hopkirk, that you are to receive a warning not to do magic any more, while you are under age, Mr. Malfoy. As do you Mr. Potter, this is your second, don't repeat it."
"Yeah. I'm serious. We've been together for about nine month' now. I'm sorry I didn't tell you, okay? But Draco asked me, not to do it right away. We were going to wait, see where our relationship went... Believe me, this,", he pointed at the closed door, " was not how I planned you finding out."
"You know, Draco and I... we're not... we're not just...
"You have to let me at least a look at it, ", he tried to convince the other.
"You overslept, you silly Boy!" she began nagging, starting a long tirade of what was wrong with him, why they had to put up with him and what a rotten and ungrateful spoiled brat he was. Harry let it all wash over him in silence, his sole thought up in his bedroom, hoping Draco was still sleeping. He finished making breakfast just as Vernon and Dudley came down the stairs. Glad to have an Audience, Petunia turned to Vernon to tell him that Harry had overslept, what led to the black-haired boy hearing the same speech he just had from his Aunt, now out of the mouth of his Uncle. He shuffled some Toast on his Plate, carefully hiding a bit of bacon underneath it.
"Now then, grab my Arm, boys!", he said and Harry took Draco's Arm who looked up kinda shocked that his surroundings were still there. "Hold tight, okay?" Harry said softly and Draco nodded and put his hand around Mr. Weasly's wrist. Harry grabbed the other Arm and the next second they were pressed through the rubber tunnel.
"What good would it do?, had Draco replied, "You don't keep bandages in your room, do you?"
"C-could I..." he began but she interrupted him, taking the bowl out of his hands smiling. "I'll be back with a refill in a second, dear." She said and huddled out of the room. Draco looked after her in a mixture of shock, amazement and something that Harry identified as guilt a second later.
"How are we getting to the Ministry Mr. Weasly?" Harry asked, to distract Draco, yet keeping a close eye on him, because he wasn't so sure he wouldn't faint.
But now, he had them every night again, sometimes woke up several times in one night, every time looking as if all he wanted to do was to curl up into a very small ball and vanish completely.
He packed all his Schoolbooks, Quills, Parchment, Ink bottles, Potion Ingredients and clothes, slammed the trunk shut and put the empty Owl Cage in front of him.
"Draco, dear, Daddy had to go to the Ministry. Daddy is an important person... But he'll be back. He will always be back." The last sentence was so clear that Harry wondered how far away she really was. There had been no real fear in her voice but an air of given up home and grim acceptance.
He was just about to hoist himself up to go back into the Castle, when he stepped into the room. He looked strangely dishevelled, as if he didn't really know, what he was doing there. He just stood at the entrance, and then, tentetavely, took a few steps until he stood right in front of Harry.
When the big man had left and locked the door behind him Harry whispered "You can come out now" into the room. His wardrobe slowly opened. Draco looked at him with big eyes, the plate still in his hands.
"Sorry, but...", he started as Draco finally rose his head. His eyes were puffy and his face completely wet, as tears continued to stream down it, and he sniffed.
"I, Amelia Bones, Head of the Department for Magical Law Enforcement, hereby declare the hearing in the Case of Draco Malfoy against Lucius Malfoy on the 20th of August open!" She said in a firm Voice.
"See, These are just clothes. Don't you want to put them on? I could make you some tea if you want..."
"I can't.", He said with a kind of finality. A bad feeling started to creep up in Harry. A feeling that he couldn't yet name.
But it was no use thinking about it. He couldn't send Draco an Owl, Hedwig was too recognizable, and Harry was pretty sure that Draco did not want his Father to know just yet that they were a couple.
"Come on you lot!", Mr. Weasly called to the rest. He ushered them out before him and went through the door only when they were all out. Then he followed them and they went a short way up the street until the nearly couldn't see the Dursley's house any more. Then he turned around to them. Go ahead," he said quietly. "Go to where we've apparated, I'll be there in a minute." They nodded and proceeded towards the spot where they had appeared only about half an hour ago.
Harry wondered what to do. He didn't think that asking would do any good, if Draco didn't want to tell him there was no point persuading him. In the end he just wrapped his Arms around the blond and caressed his Head with slow soothing strokes. But as he looked forward to the holidays, his heart sank and an unfamiliar fear, like a foresight of coming terror clenched his heart in a tight fist.
"She just hasn't been all... there, you know. I mean... she is a bit... I don't really thinks she sees reality the way we do. I mean, sure she can act in public and all but... when were at home...
With that, the witches and wizards at the high table stood up and left the room, leaving Harry Draco, Mr. Malfoy and two Guards quiet alone with each other.
It became his Mantra over the day, as Draco's condition got worse and worse. He lay himself next to the Slytherin, who was shaking violently under a fever shiver, even though he had to all the blankets and Sweaters over him that he could find. It was horrible.
Draco regained his Strength very slowly. Harry kept him company almost the whole time. The day after he had woken up, Ron came in. Draco looked at him and for a second Harry thought Draco would sneer a mean comment. To be honest Harry would have been glad, because it would have meant that he was getting his confidence back. But he just looked at Ron and then bowed his head muttering "Hello"
"Harry... something really terrible has happened to him, hasn't it?", she asked, her voice still a bit shaky. She looked ashamed. Harry nodded and Ginny looked at her feet.
When Draco had finished, a deep silence fell. Harry hadn't hear him ever talk that much in one go. It was as if all this had had to come out, once he had started. And now, Harry saw, he looked kind of relieved. As if the weight on him had become a bit lighter now, that he finally told someone.
Harry Potter was head over heals in love with Draco Malfoy. The whole thing sounded like a gigantic Joke Rita Skeeter would conjure up, to bring them both into discredit. But Harry couldn't help it. And he also couldn't help to wish that Draco would smile, just once. Whenever he smiled in public, it was cold and calculating. It never reached his eyes. Harry just wished that he saw just for once how his whole face would lighten up when he was really happy.
Harry rolled his eyes and attempted to throw a pillow at them. The Twins grins broadened and they ducked.
The door opened and two Dementors slid in. The room became cold and Gray immediately but the two only had eyes for Mr. Malfoy whom they grabbed under the arms and dragged out of the room, while he screamed and struggled. Harry tightened his grip around Draco, who had his eyes closed, but who could not shut out the fainter growing screams of his father. The Door closed and all became silent again. Amelia Bones sighed deeply. Then she directed her Wand at the two guards, who came out of their revere at once, looking confused at the mess.
Harry tried to imagine it. Cooped up in a house with a Father he feared and a mother, to fragile for the world. No one he could have talked to, no one, he could confide in.
"Mrs. Weasly." He finally said in a quiet tone. Even though she was rummaging around loudly with all the Ingredients, she stopped as abruptly as if he had shouted. Standing very still she did not turn around.
"Of course he didn't. Do you think I can't see that he is just frightened? I know that feeling. You are so scared that anyone might see how near to the breaking point you are, that you just lash out, on anyone available." The sadness in her voice and eyes deepened and Harry asked himself when she might have been that frightened. And answered the question to himself immediately. Back then. Bill Charlie and the Twins were all older then him, so that meant during the time Voldemort was in power she not only had to fear for her life and the life of her husband, but already for the life of her then four children. He could imagine her, trying to be all tough, lashing out at her husband and kids for little slip ups, just so scared that every one could have been there last.
They had noticed that when the Person on the other side didn't object to a special Person coming in, the Door would budge. If the one on the other side didn't want anyone to come in, it didn't appear.
Lucius Malfoy couldn't do anything like this, could he? There were Guards. They would stop him if he attempted anything...
"Well I somehow guessed you probably wouldn't sleep too much tonight, so I thought I made sure that when you go you have had at least a decent breakfast!" She said, merrily sounding, but Harry could hear the slight note of strain, as if she thought maybe Draco wouldn't like that much fuss after the last time she had tried to do something for him.
Harry hadn't heard Draco utter a single word about his mother up until now. But he had seen how Draco reacted to Mrs. Weasly motherly attitude towards him. No, his mother hadn't been there for him. He wouldn't say it to Draco, who clearly wanted to protect her from harm, but he thought that she had really missed out on her duty's as as a mother. Weren't mother's supposed to give everything to protect their children?
"But you don't want to do this. Wait until the committee comes back. Wait for the charge. If you do this now, you'll be the one they convict. And I really would have a hard time, duelling all of the ministry to get you out of here."
Third corridor. Past the wall. Once. Twice. Thrice.
Through more sobs and now little hiccups he thought he got what Draco wanted to say. Harry smiled.
"It's okay. You don't have to defend her for me. I don't hate her... I am a bit angry at her for leaving you alone like that, but at the same time... It is hard to stay angry at someone so..." He tried to find the right word to describe it without hurting Draco, but it was he who finished instead:"...broken?"
Lucius Malfoy jerked his head towards Draco. Harry's eyes flickered only for a second to the boy he loved. Chalk white, he stared into his father's face, transfixed by horror and shock, seemingly unable to look away.
full of real Garden gnomes for at least a week.
"Let's go home?" He phrased it as a question, because this was Draco's home, or at least had been. But Draco seemed to understand, because although his smile still held some of the sadness at seeing his Mother, It was a smile nonetheless.
If you should dare to ask Draco for an Interview about the ordeal he had to go through,
As they walked towards the Dursely's House, Harry began to feel sick with fear. Draco took his hand, and a kind of warmth, that had nothing to do with magic spread through the Griffyndor. Or maybe it did. Maybe this was a kind of magic all for itself. Hadn't the love of his mother been a kind of magic too, moreover, according to Dumbledore, one of the most powerful ones? He smiled to his boyfriend and looked over to Ron, who grinned at him cheering as if he wanted to say 'Don't worry, we're here for you'. He felt better.
Draco drew a deep shuddering breath and looking like it took him everything he had, he nodded.
Harry looked at him. Part of him wanted to say that no, that wasn't what he meant at all. But he could not, would not lie to Draco.
"Great!", said Ron, rubbing his hands excitedly. "Well, I hope you're better than Harry, because to be honest, there is no fun in playing if you know you are winning!" He grinned and Harry frowned at him. And Draco... giggled. It was the most wonderful sound, Harry thought he had ever heard. His Heart felt so much lighter and he gave Ron a look of deep gratitude, who grinned and went of to get his Chessboard.
The letter from Mr. Weasly wrote:
Harry had been last the changing room after a Quidditch match with Slytherin. He didn't want to go celebrate the Victory with the others just yet. Harry wanted to savour the feeling of Draco, flying right next to him, for a bit longer. They were never as close as then, there , high above the ground, with the wind on their faces. In the end, Harry thought, it was a miracle that he could catch the Snitch at all, with all the Distraction that he had.
The second was that Harry hadn't taken any of his Hogwarts things from the Dursley's that meant he would have to go back to Private Drive before the Start of the term to get it. Then it occurred to him, that Draco hadn't gotten any of his stuff either. It probably would take quiet an effort to get those. But for now, Harry didn't worry. At least he had his Wand, which he always kept on his body. It was his most important possession. A wizard without his wand was about as useful as a door without a handle. And he had more pressing matters at hand.
But it would never be a Problem. They wanted each other so badly. Harry opened the door and walked into the room.
"Imperio. Imperio."
"don't go away..."
Draco yawned next to him and rubbed his eyes. Then he looked around sleepily. "Whas for breakfas?" he mumbled, still half asleep. Harry looked at him. The fire was still there. Yes, there was hope. They would manage.
He was also more sensitive, having had so little sleep he was very easy upset, cumulating in him shouting at Mrs. Weasly for trying to comb his hair. It only lasted a second and he looked so aghast and scared right after, when he swung around and ran from the kitchen that Harry was stunned for a moment.
At eight O'clock they left the house together with Mr. Weasly. Mrs. Weasly hugged them both this time and Harry could see her eyes becoming watery again. Ron patted Draco on the back, which seemed to slightly confuse the blonde, mostly Harry guessed because no one had ever patted him on the back before. The rest of the Weasly's merely winked and wished Draco good luck. He looked very pale now and even a bit green.
"Here, you can put these on. There not very new or good, but..." He stopped himself from saying 'but at least their whole', feeling that it would not come across very good. But Draco didn't react anyway. He stared through Harry as if he had no Idea what was going on. It scared the Griffyndor.
"Sorry", Harry said contrite. "Never mind. But you seem to be awfully dazed these days, Really." She looked out of the Window and Harry saw that they were nearing King's Cross Station. He hastily put on his normal clothes and just finished stuffing his cloak and everything back into his trunk when they arrived. Inside the heavy crowd, he was swept through the barrier, without the chance of a last glance at Draco.
"But I need to talk to you. Because clearly, you don't have any Idea, how you make Draco feel.", Harry said, harder then he had intended to. But he couldn't let her hurt Draco an more.
"You dare... You little prat! You are nothing! Nothing without me!"
"Of course, of course, tea and cookies coming right up!" and she turned around an busied herself with the cookiemaking again. Draco smiled thankfully at Harry and say sat in silence as Mrs. Weasly gave them both two big mugs of tea and, 20 Minutes later, a vat of still steaming cookies.
He turned around and squeezed Harry's hand firmly. Then he pushed the door open and entered.
Harry's Heart ached and he lay one arm around Draco.
The followed Mrs. Weasly into the kitchen, where she immediately started to make toast and scrambled eggs and bacon. It was only now that Harry realized.
"Happy Anniversary" he heard Draco whisper and it was the last thing he heard before drifting peacefully to sleep
Amelia Bones nodded and made some notes on her clipboard.
"Who touched you Draco?" Harry's stomach contorted as the answer, only a whisper, seemed to ring loud in his ears and through the room.
They sighed theatrically. "Now she will pick all of those sad little boys who always try to get her attention."
"Well... this is it. My House." He looked as if he wanted to say ore, but instead shook his had and added quietly: "It seems even bigger then last time...", as if speaking to himself.
"Harry, are you quiet all right?" asked Mr. Weasly very confused and looking a bit concerned, as if he thought, Harry had a shock or something.
"Who's there?", he asked suspiciously.
After he assured her that he would come back soon and visit, Draco stood up and, taking harry by the hand left the Room and walked down towards the fireplace.
The Silence was deafening. Deadly. Harry could see the shock in Mr. Weasly's eyes turn into pure hatred towards that man who had so utterly destroyed everything he should have held dear. When he spoke again, the Griffyndor could hear the effort he had to make to keep his voice calm, so as not to upset Draco even more.
When they reached his room, he made Draco sit down on his bed and hastily pulled some of his clothes out of his cabbet. In the light of his room, Draco looked even worse, his usually pale expression now looking an unhealthy gray. There were dark shadows underneath his eyes and tears had left their mark on his cheeks. He looked as if he had been through hell.
"I'll go with you." He said in a calm tone. Harry stared at him.
"I can't believe someone has used it on a child. I didn't even know there were some I the possession of private people any more. After the fall of he-who-must-not-be-named, they were forbidden and all known once were destroyed. But it seems, someone has kept one." She looked sharply at Harry again who saw away quickly, asking himself how much she guessed. Then he looked back at Draco.
"She's such a -sniff- wonderful woman and I -hic- I said... and she -hic- she only tried to-uhh.."
"Your Mother?" he asked tentatively. Draco nodded. Harry took a deep breath and decided that now, as Draco had already brought her up, he could as well ask.
"You... don't want to go home?" He repeated slowly. This puzzled him. Draco had a nice home didn't he? Parents, a big Mansion, as far as Harry knew even Servants. But something in Draco's look stopped him from saying this.
"Mr. Weasly, are we getting there by floopowder?", Harry now asked, looking around for the pot with the green Powder, but the man shook his head.
"Don't worry," Draco started. "I'll think they survive." He seemed to hold back to say more, but Ron jumped in.
"not... Uh-hm, not fair." he managed to croak when Draco waved his wand and a second later Harry was as starkers as he was.
"Ron, I love Draco. I hope... well I hope that you can understand that. Please try to accept him, would you? He's been through a lot...", Harry's Voice faded, still shaken by what he had found out about Draco's past. He looked at Ron again, who's face had changed to thoughtful.
Now Draco stood up and walked towards Harry, Every Movement was perfect, smooth and energetic. Like a beautiful white Tiger, entrancing in his Power and Magnificence.
But it came again, and again. Flashes of light shot towards him from Malfoy's wand and he was pushed backwards. The backs of his knees hit the chair. He was pretty much already standing with his back to the wall. Meanwhile, he saw Draco crouching into one of the cornes. He must be out of his mind with panic
"Next time you are left in the room to protect the victims from the criminal, please make sure that you pay attention when he draws his wand." She said coldly and the men winced as if she had hit them.
"Mrs. Weasly, please don't feel bad for reading this. Sooner or later you would have heard about it anyway. My... Lucius Malfoy is just too well known for this not to be covered everywhere."
"Wait here.", he said abruptly, standing up and leaving the room. What he was going to do now was probably foolish, but he wouldn't let Draco starve just because he could get in trouble. And he would protect Draco. He walked in the Kitchen, casually as if it was normal for him to return for second helpings, and put three more toasts, five slices of bacon and two eggs on a second plate. Then he walked up into the room again. As he hoped, the Dursley's were so aghast in this second, that they didn't know how to react. But he didn't have much time. On the stairs, he broke into a run, dashed into the room and put the plate in front of Draco.
Uncle Vernon stood right in Front of them in the Way to the door. He looked savagely, as If he was determined to not let them pass.
"That settles it then. Harry, a tomorrow is Saturday, I won't have to go to work, so we can go than, all right?" Harry nodded and Mr. Weasly strode off into the Kitchen to ask his wife how dinner was coming around.
The Holidays promised to be as boring and dreadful as Harry had thought. The Dursley still hated him, no surprise there, and they had given him loads of hard work as if they thought that if he had to work with his hands, the magic would somehow be pushed out of him.
"You know that you are always welcome at this house, my dear, don't you? Don't hesitate dropping in any time you want", she said, still smiling.
They were standing in a marvellous hall, big, with a high ceiling. In it's middle stood the grandest Dinner table Harry had ever seen outside of Hogwarts. It looked dark and old. In fact, everything looked pretty dark and old. Harry looked around and saw that there were high windows on the walls, but all of them were hanged with thick black curtains so that the only light came from the Chandelier hanging on the ceiling. It was huge and Harry had the distinct impression that those Diamond drops where real.
"Why not? I'm sorry, but I fear I have nothing more suitable for you..." the black-haired started an excuse but Draco shook his Head.
"If I want to put these on," ,he said, his voice becoming more steady, "I'd have to undress first, right?"
After the Argument with Ginny had been clarified, Draco's presence in the Burrow became much less strained. The Weasly's began to get used to him and in response, Draco became less jumpy and subdued, even starting to laugh at the meals and taking part in the Conversations. Harry was blissful, to see his lover get better. Still there were the nights. Draco would wake up almost every night, sweating, sometimes crying. Harry never had to ask what he had been dreaming about.
The black-haired looked at him and sighed quietly. Then he began to write a note to Mr. Weasly. He explained that Draco and he were currently in the same location and that Draco needed medical Treatment and some care taking. He didn't want to explain the finer Details in a letter, it was to private. And there was always the danger of the owl being caught of and the post being searched, in which case he didn't want to reveal too much.
"Mr. Malfoy had stood up and looked positively livid now, but Madame Bones gave an air of being quiet able to silence him if he didn't shut up by himself.
"They tried to cheer up Ginny for days. Honestly, I think they are making it worse by the minute." He looked at Harry. " She really liked you, I think it came as a real shock for her that you are swinging the other way 'round." He grinned a bit.
"It's over, isn't it?" He said softly. And when Harry nodded, he smiled, for the first time, smiled and let his head rest on Harry's shoulder.
Harry bent down. "Could you... repeat that?", he asked carefully
The End
"Thank you Ron. That means much to me." His stomach gave a loud rumble and he looked up
"I can't go back to the Burrow just yet. I have... I have to go and see my mother. She is all alone in that house now. I'm a bit scared for her. And I have to think of something for her and me anyway..." He looked a bit deflated. Harry put his Arm around him and Draco gladly took his hand. Mr. Weasly nodded.
From the sounds the Slytherin made he was more than ready. Harry pulled his fingers out and put his own member at the entrance. Draco moaned loudly, rocking his hips forward as to invite him in and Harry didn't need any more convincing. He pushed completely into Draco, who let out a loud scream, and waited until the blonde had adjusted. Pushing back and forth he soon found a rhythm that seemed to drive Draco crazy. He yelled and moaned, gasping for air and stuttering Harry's name whenever the black-haired pushed in.
Mrs. Weasly had put two spare Mattresses into Ron's room, which made it very crowded and small but she thought it would be better for Harry to stay near Draco and they couldn't put another bed in the living room if they were to use it.
Draco turned around and looked at him. He looked a bit better then yesterday but the tired look was still on his face.
They walked through the hall to a door on the other side. It led into an Entrance hall where two staircases went upwards in a kind of spiral. Up they went through a long Corridor, lain with a red velvet Carpet and plastered with Portraits of old Malfoy Ancestors, who all looked disapprovingly at them, but didn't say anything. Finally they stood in Front of a high wooden door, dark as everything else in this House. Draco took another deep breath, and knocked.
And so, when Hedwig came swooping in on the fifth day, he was so relieved, he nearly cried. He had to hide Draco beneath the cover now, whenever Uncle Vernon came in to let him out for toilet, because the blonde couldn't get up any more, even if he knew where he was.
"The Person... the person who used it on me... it was not the first time. And it was not... not..." His voice seemed to fail him. Harry took his hand and squeezed it. Draco looked at him and Harry nodded softly. Draco swallowed again.
She stared at the scene and Harry could really only imagine what she must see. Malfoy Senior on the floor, He and Draco standing in front of him, both holding their wands and holding each other in tight embrace. And within all that chaos, the guards, still blank-eyed as if though nothing was happening at all.
"You are a good boy Draco... a good boy... I tried to tell him you are a good boy, you didn't need to be punished... you're a good boy who does his mommy proud..." He said it again and again, and tears welled out of her eyes and down her face, Draco looked shocked but did not say anything. His mother continued stroking his hair.
It was an odd Question that Harry didn't exactly where to place. "I... guess so." He said slowly. Draco shook his Head again.
But Ron laughed. "Naw, they're just joking. Sure Ginny's a bit shaken, but it's not as if there was ever anything between her and Harry and really, how often does it work out with your first crush? No, she's gonna find someone else, no doubt. Jut not to soon." He added hastily in a kind of dangerous undertone. Draco relaxed a little.
"Gentlemen," She started and her tone didn't forecast anything good.
"How can she be so nice? Doesn't she know what I've done? What I've said about her and her family? How can she..." He gulped, the words seemed to have fled him. Harry kissed him again.
"Do you want to know what I see when I look at you? I who knows your secret?" Draco's eyes flickered, Fear and hopelessness spreading through him. This was what Harry had dreaded. Draco didn't believe in him. In them. So Harry took a deep breath
Mrs Weasly stared at him. Then her face broke in a watery smile
"It's fine." Draco interrupted him. It was as if saying it had opened a Vessel in him, through which the darkness could pour out.
The words "my father" which he had used so often before just wouldn't come out. His struggles became weaker and after a while stopped, as he hang limp and sobbing in Harry's arms.
When he had finished, it was temporarily silent in the room. Then Perkins, who had been listening the whole time of course said:" Blimey... I think I need something stronger then cocoa."
It was two hours later that they went back two the Burrow. Draco had made his Mother a hot drink and had talked to her for quiet a while. Harry wasn't sure how much of it had reached Narcissa Malfoy, but she had often smiled vaguely and patted his head or caressed his cheek. Harry was not sure how he felt about her. On the one hand he was angry with this weak woman, who had given up, rather then staying strong and protecting her son. On the other. She seemed, in her own dazed way, to actually love and care for Draco. Harry guessed that this was, in the end, all she could give. It would have to be enough.
He said it slowly and calmly, as if talking to a little child. His mother looked confused now.
In the evening Harry slumped on his bed, feeling completely exhausted. He had worked for ten today, the way his arms and back felt. Also, he had been right about the sunburn. His back felt, raw and hot, like the skin was too small for him.
Harry saw Draco flinch on the sound of his fathers Name. Harry thought that the full weight of what he had to deal with had to come to him right now, after hearing it spoken out like this.
"Hey." he simply said. It was weak, he knew it, but he didn't know what to say. The hearing was only two days away and Harry just couldn't come up with anything that would be really comforting.
"Maybe, Harry, it would be a bit much for your Aunt and Uncle if four of us came all at once...,", he started but a snort from both Ron and Draco interrupted him. The two looked at each other, then at Mr. Weasly.
"Mr. Weasly, could we talk to you?" he asked the man in a low Voice. Ron's father looked at him with a mix of curiosity, worry and relief. He seemed to understand immediatly what this was about.
Harry remembered. It was like looking at another lifetime. He had been so jealous at Draco, thinking what a wonderful life it must be to have Parents who love and care for you... How foolish it know all seemed and how far away. If he had only known then what he did now. But he only nodded at Draco.
"If you want, I can make you breakfast. But if you want to be alone for a while..." She turned to leave and Draco went darker. He hadn't really spoken with Mrs. Weasly, mostly hidden in some corners since the day he had screamed at her. Harry smiled at him and kissed him again, a short, sweet kiss, this time. Then he looked at him. "Breakfast?" , he asked and Draco nodded, still pink, but looking a bit more relaxed now.
"Now, Draco, tell us your side of the story please." She said and Harry was sure now that her voice had become softer.
He spoke fast and seemed to bet a bit beside himself. Harry could only assume that he had sat here, worrying the whole time. To his surprise, it was Draco, who smiled slightly and said: "To be honest, I wouldn't say no to a hot chocolate." Mr. Weasly stopped talking immediately. For a moment he looked stunned, then he seemed to fall together with relaxation. He nodded and conjured to cups of hot cocoa with a flick of his Wand and a muttered spell. Then he got out to boxes for them to sit on.
Before they left, Draco had given the wand back a very apologetic guard, who got even redder in the face when he realized that one of the boys would not even have been able to defend himself, if he hadn't thought quickly. They asked themselves through to Mr. Weasly's Office. It was a small and cramped room at the end of the second floor corridor. When they came in, Mr. Weasly jumped up and rushed to them at once, his face anxious.
He spoke in a soft, low voice as if soothing a frightened animal. Carefully, he came on the bed and neared Draco. The other looked at him in fear, but Harry kept speaking to him carefully.
Harry grabbed a hand of powder to and repeated the action. Once he'd finished saying his destination, he started whirling around, shooting past other fireplaces until he landed with a small 'thud' on a floor in front of a gigantic fireplace, twice as big as the one he just left. Draco was already standing there. Harry patted his clothes as to get the dust of a bit, then he looked up.
When they arrived at the Burrow 2 Minutes later, it was to find Mrs. Weasly waiting for them, pulling them both into a gigantic Hug, the second they had stepped out of the fire.
"Mrs. Weasly... Is... Is everything alright? Uhm... Can we make you a tea maybe?" In his head he thought that she, like Jenkins, looked like she needed something stronger.
Harry nodded firmly. "Yes. When Draco came to me, his whole back was open. The wounds even infested and got really bad because I couldn't tend to them. It was Mrs. Weasly who healed him up."
Harry hoped so. The Griffyndor had worked hard to gain Draco's trust and hoped that it was enough for the Slytherin to tell him his worries.
"She doesn't mind. She knows you didn't mean it! We all know that you are under a whole lot of pressure. I mean, Mr. Weasly hasn't told them what the meeting is about exactly but... they know there's the hearing and so..."
, said the voice. He put the badge on and then suddenly the telephone box began to move, deep beneath the ground, into the Ministry of magic.
"Well... I thought the Weasly's could help. Their Dad works at the ministry... I don't know..." he paused for a second.
"So... what happened? I only got that Amelia Bones came out of Court practically fuming with rage. Did something happen?"
Harry opened his mouth but, again, it was Draco who started speaking first and Harry closed it again hastily. It looked as if the fact that his father was now locked away and he was safe brought out Draco's normal self again and Harry would be damned to go between that.
She seemed positively giddy and ushered them into the Kitchen at once, where two mugs of steaming hot tea stood waiting for them. She made them sit down and started bustling about, talking of making a vat of cookies to celebrate the occasion.
"What an imp..." murmured Ron next to Harry. "Can't even take a little cut, that poor Draco-baby." Harry pushed him in the ribs to stop him talking, because Snape swooped past them and wouldn't be delighted to hear them talk ill about his favourite Student. At least that's what he told himself later. But there was this tiny little voice inside his head that told him that maybe he, Harry was the one who didn't want to hear any ill speaking of Draco. But that was absurd, right?
"Yes, High Court, Of course I deny them!" , said he now, sounding now quiet appalled. "I mean, you can't really think these were true, can you?" He smiled again, sickly and sweetly, like an hypnotic snake, lulling it's Victim in a false sense of security.
Malfoy Senior whitened.
"Could you, y'know, protect him?", asked the black one quiet. He wasn't sure whether this was going to work but at his words the stag lay down, surrounding Draco's body, so fragile and yet Harry knew which strength it possessed, shielding it. And maybe it was just Harry's imagination, but he had the feeling that Draco's breathing became calmer and deeper as if he was finally able to sink into a deep and resting sleep.
"We will see,", said Madame. Bones flatly. "Mr. Malfoy Please sit down. Mr. Draco Malfoy, Please stand up and come forward to give you testimony."
They didn't manage to see each other until the end of term, not alone anyway. Of course they met on the corridors but they didn't do much more then look at each other. In public, they were the same as always, enemies to the core, hate the only feeling they would ever have for each other. Draco had begged Harry not to tell anyone yet and Harry had agreed. He knew that Draco valued his pride high, that his standing at the top of everything meant much to him. And on some level he was even glad to have the Slytherin all to himself. It was their little secret, a forbidden love-affair. Harry smiled, Draco would just sneer at him if he tried to feed the blonde such "romantic nonsense" as he used to call it. Still, he had told Harry that he loved him on several occasions now. Harry just hoped that the summer Vacations wouldn't destroy what they had so carefully build up, and what seemed so very fragile, whenever Harry looked at it
Harry licked the Erection and then swallowed it pumping up and down with his mouth, feeling Draco's Hand grasp his Hair while the blonde tried to stifle his pleading, lustful moans. Harry began circling his fingers around Draco's entrance. He remembered the first time they did it, Harry hadn't known how to prepare Draco, and his love had cried in Pain. Harry was so shocked that he almost stopped completely. But Draco had held him close, telling him that he didn't care, that he wanted this. After that, Harry had tried to gain a bit of knowledge on this, surprised that there was actually a section in the library that dealt with such themes as being gay and coming out. It told Harry that there were lubricants that could numb the pain and everything else he needed to know.
Draco tightened his arms around Harry's neck and with a last push, they both came.
"No, mother. He went to the ministry today, that is true. But he will not come back. They arrested him. They brought him to Azkaban. He is never going to come back."
So, in the end, I decided to do it. It gives the ending a slyghtly bittersweet feeling But I can live with that.
"Sorry, as you can see, we haven't been given so much space... Oh, that is Perkins, by the way, my Co-worker." An old man with fluffy white hair smiled at them and said "Nice to meet you"
But Mrs. Weasly pulled back, looking at Draco with tearstrewn eyes. "I-I'm s-so, s-s-sorry!", she hiccuped. "I didn't... didn't mean t-to read i-it... I- I though...it w-would come only t-t-tomorrow..."
Then, as if every step was taking him a great deal of strength, Harry heard the heavy footsteps of Uncle Vernon and sure enough, shortly after, his Uncle opened the Door just a slit. He peered through the small gap at them and immediately tried to shut the door again, but Mr. Weasly was faster. With one swift movement he pushed the door open, knocking back Uncle Vernon, who staggered and nearly fell. Mr. Weasly tipped his head an said: "Thank you very much for letting us in.", I such a polite way that, if Harry hadn't seen differently, he would have believed that Uncle Vernon had invited him in.
At once Harry was awake.
My dearies, this is the Chapter that kept me from writing the end for so very long.
They did.
"Wait a second, I'm coming to you.", he whispered and hastily dashed away from the Window and went down the stairs, carefully avoiding the last step because it creaked. He tiptoed to the front door praying once more for the Dursley's to be fast asleep, then took the key from the chain next to the door and opened it.
"Oh, get a room you two!" Sounded the Voices of the Twins suddenly towards them. Harry broke the kiss and Draco looked kind of scared, as if he was expecting a scolding, but Fred and George grinned.
He went up the Staircase and knocked on Ginny's door.
And sure enough, around early noon he heard a car park outside and when he looked out of the Window, a red-haired figure came out of it and onto the doorstep. Harry heard the doorbell and Uncle Vernon answering. He couldn't hear the conversation that followed but his Uncle grew louder and more violent in tone. Then there was suddenly a loud 'Bang'. Then silence. Footsteps coming up the Stairs that didn't belong to his Uncle. A Key in the door, and the door opened. There stood Mr. Weasly, and Harry had never been so glad to see him.
There was again a ripple in the court, louder this time, but Madame Bones raised a hand a tit fell silent again.
"I wanted to kill him." He said quietly and Harry stared at him, then at Madame Bones. Her face was unreadable.
So he had given the matter thought. Of course he had.
Her blue eyes fell on Draco.
"Mrs. Weasly, I was at that trial. Whatever is in there, cannot be worse that what lies behind me." There was that sad smile again. Mrs. Weasly's eyes filled with renewed tears. With shaking hands, she lowered the Newspaper and handed it to Draco. He turned it around and started reading, his eyes unfathomable. Then he sighed and laid it down on the Table.
"Come on you two!" said Mr. Weasly and they marched to the desk on the far side of the Atrium, where they gave a bored looking wizard their wands, who weighed them, stated their attributes and returned them.
In the evening, Draco still hadn't woken up, which meant that he had not eaten or drunk for about two and a half days. Harry became really worried. He knew that a human could survive without food for a longer time, but water was vital. To add to that, the wounds meant that Draco needed all his strength and his body drained his resources faster than usual. If Draco didn't wake up soon they would have to force something into him.
Harry turned around to see Mrs. Weasly standing in the doorway and smiling.
Then there was the social worker who came by three days after the trial to talk to Draco about his prospects for the future. They also talked a lot about his Mother and after a lot of arguing and a bit of crying and a whole lot of "I didn't mean to say that" from Draco who was getting extremely edgy again, he agreed that it would be best for his Mother to be transferred to St. Mungos, where she would be looked after and cared for.
"Draco... tell me this is the first time this happened..." Fear clenched his chest. The Slytherin met his eyes only for a split-second, but it was enough. In this Ice-blue Orbs, Harry could see the pain of a lifetime. It all made sense. The mask, he wore. Why he mentioned his father in almost every second sentence. He had to convince the world, convince himself that everything was fine. That they were a loving Family. In Draco's world, Image was everything. His whole life had been one great masquerade.
But He hadn't heard wrong. The words ringing in his ear, he turned to see Draco stare at him. He didn't know what to say. How could he console him? How tell him, that it would be all right? There were no words for what the blonde had experienced.
"Hey, love.", he whispered softly, "How do you feel?" He had to fight back the urge to cry in glad relief but felt that it wasn't the right moment. He didn't need Draco worrying about him. The addressed coughed and his face contorted in Pain.
When they got there they looked back at where Mr. Weasly must be coming any minute. And sure enough, he came. He came fast, almost running. He skidded to a hold in front of them, said "Grab my arm!" and they had only just done so, when Mr. Weasly already started to dissapparate, but not, before Harry could catch a glimpse of Uncle Vernon, trumpeting like an injured rhino, ran towards the, red faced and looking murderous. Then he was gone, Harry felt this very unpleasant feeling of being pressed through a way to small tunnel...
"And who, my dear boy, is going to stop me. You? IMPERIO!"
"Mr. Lucius Malfoy, do you have anything else to say to the Court?" She rounded on Draco's father who looked as if he wanted to say a great deal of things, non of which would have been very appropriate for under-age ears
Draco gulped and Harry could see him resisting tears now. Mrs. Weasly looked at hi, for a moment longer with warm eyes, then turned and said: I'd better go and wake the others, You have to go in about two hours." and strode out of the room.
Harry kissed back, deep and longing, he wanted to hold Draco, wanted to protect him, his heart from harm of any kind. He wanted him to be able to smile more often, to be happy.
"My Father."
"Draco, you really should put on some dry clothes. You'll get a cold. I would love to offer you the shower, but that will have to wait until morning, ok?" Still no response. Draco just stared at him blankly, as new tears started rolling down his cheeks. Harry didn't know what to do. He had to get Draco out of these clothes or he would he could even get a lung infection. He touched Draco's Arm. This produced a reaction but not the one Harry had imagined. The pale boy jolted and scrambled on to the corner of the bed where he tried to make himself as small as possible.
"Look, I don't know what happened, but you are safe here, ok? I won't let anyone hurt you, not my Aunt and Uncle, not the Person who did this to you... no one will get near you, I promise." He now said next to Draco who seemed to ease up a bit.
Then Mrs. Weasly sighed and said since they were all awake anyway She would start making breakfast right away. Harry stretched and Draco nuzzled near him, keeping close contact. Harry lay one arm around him and kissed him on the head.
read the headline. Harry looked at Draco.
He took a deep breath and straightened himself.
"Thank you."
"Aren't you going to ask me what the trial was about?" He said it in a strained voice, as if to force himself to keep calm. Mrs Weasly's shoulders sagged. And them she turned around in one fluid motion and hugged Draco so tight that Harry could see the air getting knocked out of him. And to his great dismay, she began sobbing.
"Oh Harry, that's a good one! You nearly had me there for a second, you..." He stopped, his glance falling on Harry, who looked serious.
"You have to do that yourself." ,he said calmly. Then he turned around and went down, leaving a very thoughtful Ginny behind.
For a moment there was silence, then Mrs. Weasly said quietly: "I can make sure that the others won't find out. I'll burn this and I burn every newspaper that comes in the next few days!" She said it with a cold fury.
Draco's Voice ripped him from his thoughts. The other boy was looking away again. But now, he just seemed tired. His shoulder were hunched, as if he was carrying the weight of the world. Harry wanted to answer, but stopped. Something about this sentence wasn't right. It sounded as if...
Draco nodded. "He... hit me. With a whip. But I can't proof it. There are no Scars. It doesn't leave scars." He told the Court this with much more courage. Harry knew that this, the physical pain was nothing against what he had had to endure emotionally. It had never been the whipping that had broken Draco.
"My... my...father came into my room... it was late. He said... I should... lay still and... and don't make a sound... never make a sound. He did things... he... he... he touched me and... and..."
Uncle Vernon tried to get out of Harry where he had put the food, but Harry said he'd thrown it somewhere into the hedge between their lawn and the next. He new his Uncle wouldn't look. Too great the danger that one of the Neighbours could spot him doing something funny.
There, he said it. He looked up carefully to see Ron, utterly shocked and perplexed. Then the other one started to laugh.
"But please... my mother... it's not her fault. She has been... depressed a lot. I'm not even sure he has noticed it. Please, don't judge her."
Harry smiled. It would be perfect.
He nearly ran down the stairs and had just entered the Kitchen when he heard the door of Aunt Petunia's and Uncle Vernon's Bedroom open and close again. He had about 10 minutes, while she was in the bathroom, to gather up something. He cramped out the frying pan, Toast, Bacon and eggs, nearly dropping the last. Wishing the stove would heat up a bit faster he had just begun to break the eggs into the pan when aunt Petunia came down. She spotted him at once.
"Mr... Mr. Weasly-hihihih... I you knew... if you knew how often I-hahahaha... I wanted to do tha-hahaha-t..." Harry gasped as he struggled to breathe through his laughter. Draco now bend down and held out his hands, which bot Harry and Ron took and they heaved themselves up the ground again. Harry was still panting,but he regained a bit of composure again.
"Mrs. Weasly, couldn't we get Madame Pomfrey? She can mend cuts in a second, can't she?" Harry asked hopefully. Madame Pomfrey was able to grow back bones in one night and mend them in seconds, surely this wasn't a Problem for her. But Mrs. Weasly looked even sadder, but also angry, Harry saw to his surprise.
"This is all I can do for now. We'll have to wait until tomorrow to see if it gets better. But I dare say, one more days or two... Merlin, I don't want to imagine what his back would have looked like. Poor dear. Who would do such a thing?" At this point she looked at Harry, but he shook his head.
So he had to spend his days, working and imagining what the blonde did, sighing every once in a while, so that Aunt Petunia, who thought he was complaining about work, gave him even more, to shut him up.
"It began... When I was 10." he started, his voice barely more than a whisper.
A second later he heard it. It was a small
Mr. Weasly smiled and patted them both on the shoulder. Then he stepped back. Draco was the first to take some of the green powder from a desk next to the fireplace and throw it into the flames. They shot up emerald green and he stepped right into them. Clearly audible he said "Malfoy Manor", and vanished.
"The Court will go to decide the Charges."
Harry saw Draco take a deep breath as he stood up and together they stepped forward until they faced the witches and wizards of the high court as Lucius Malfoy had done before.
"Draco? What are you doing here?" He hissed, completely, stunned.
Draco stiffened, but then relaxed, letting her hug him tightly for a moment longer. Then she let go.
"Arthur Weasly, Harry James Potter and Draco Malfoy, We are hear on behalf of the hearing against Lucius Malfoy."
"She isn't a bad person, you know?" He said quietly, when they stood in front of the enormous Mantelpiece. "I think she expressed all the love she could in her own way. Remember all those Sweet Packs I used to get from my Parents at Hogwarts?"
"You won't hurt him." Harry's eyes had found Mr. Malfoy's again an he was staring at him with all the burning desire to avenge, to hurt, to make him feel, that he had had when they had entered the room.
Harry's heart sank. He had a distinct impression he knew what Mrs. Weasly was talking about.
At the last day of term Harry, Ron and Hermione stood at the Train station and waited for the Hogwarts-Express to arrive and take them home too their respective families. Harry caught a glimpse of Draco, flanked as usual by Crab and Goyle. His heart gave a jolt and he had to hold back really hard not to run to him. He felt someone tugging on his sleeve. It was Hermione and she said" Come on, Harry, or we won't get any seats!"
Over the course of the day, Harry realized two things: First, Everyone seemed to take the news that he and Draco Malfoy were a Couple pretty lightly, which was probably mainly thanks to the way they arrived here. It was probably hard to despise a person that lay deeply wounded and unconscious in your living room. Well, that was, everyone, except Ginny, who seemed quiet shocked at the news and after that always had a very sour look on her face whenever she saw Harry.
Mr. Weasly still hadn't said anything. He just looked at Draco. Then he came forward and, leaning down on him, he hugged him. Harry could see Draco stiffen momentarily with this unusual display of emotions towards him. But then he patted Mr. Weasly on the back. The man let go of him and took a step back.
" I haven't forgotten anything, Ginny. I know exactly who Draco Malfoy is and was. But I also know, that we can't be held responsible for the sins of our parents for instance, so don't you go and accuse him about that Diary! You have absolutely no Idea what he has gone through. He has suffered, Ginny, more than you could ever imagine. I won't let you treat him as if he has done something horrible to you. I'm very sorry that it didn't work out for you the way you wanted, but what do you want me to say? That I love you, even though it's not true? Do you really want me to pretend that we are in a relationship, when in truth all my thoughts are on him all the time? Is that what you want, Ginny?"
But he didn't really believe that help would come. And even though it seemed to take him ages to come to all these conclusions, his wand had been in his hand from the moment he had heard Malfoy senior say the first curse. It really helped to have seeker reflexes. He stood up, his gaze fixed ad Mr. Malfoy. The Man came towards him, his own Wand outstretched and pointing at him.
Soon after Vernon had locked them both in, Harry had touched the topic of Draco's back.
Saiyasha27
"... but it is time to end this little Drama now, don't you think? I mean, I got quiet out of Hand. And you really shouldn't toy with people like this Draco. That poor boy next to you really thinks you are in love with him. That is not very nice." Concluded Mr. Malfoy, his smile malicious. Draco trembled still, but said nothing.
"You look so shocked... I knew you would be shocked... I didn't want you to know..."
Draco stood there and watched her leave. Harry got up and put his arms around him from behind. Draco grabbed them with his hands.
"You brought a friend... Did you ask Daddy? If not, this could be bad... very bad... Daddy may get angry..." She swayed a bit and put one of her long-fingered hands to her head as if she had a headache. Draco's Expression was no longer anxious. It was sad. Maybe he had hoped that somehow his mothers confusion would be cured if his father was locked away. But this did not seem to be the case. He made a step forward and took her hand. Then he guided her careful back in her room, and made her sit down on a chair. She let him, looking slightly dazed still but Harry could also feel that she didn't have anything against Draco's presence. When she sat, Draco knelled down in front of her, so that he could look her in the face.
"I... I thought... you weren't in my room this morning." He said weakly. Harry smiled a bit and noticed Draco's lids flutter.
They arrived. There was no one in the Garden, but Harry couldn't help thinking that Aunt Petunia was peering through one of the Curtains already, eyeing everything suspiciously.
"Whatever happens in there, You will always be welcome to stay at the burrow, as long as you like. Please don't forget, Draco: You are not alone any more. You have Harry. And if you ask us to, you will have the whole Weasly-Family right behind you." He smiled very softly. Draco's eyes went even wider and he looked for a second as if he wanted to hug Mr. Weasly. But then he just nodded but Harry could see that his face had become just a tiny bit less green.
"I understand. Then I will send you back to Malfoy Manor first and you can get back home with Floopowder from there, is that right?"
"Merlin, you mean it!" he gasped, shocked. Harry looked away. It hurt to see Ron taking it so hard, even though he had expected it. Ron was never really good with changes.
"Oops" , he said, starting to apologize but Harry waved it away. "Leave it. If were lucky, it'll start to stink through the house during my time in Hogwarts." , he shrugged and Ron grinned.
"It's just... Summer Vacation is only two weeks away, you know... and... I don't...I dontwantogohome!", Draco suddenly blurted out and Harry needed a moment for his still awakening head to form a halfway sensible sentence out of this.
"Well, we'll be leaving you two lovebirds alone"
With a jolt, Harry came out of his memory. Hermione was looking at him with an expression that told him he wanted his opinion on something.
But Harry had no Idea how Draco's inside really looked. Even when he did laugh at a joke Fred and George had made, he seemed kind of reserved, as if he wasn't really there. The fire had not really returned to his eyes. There was a spark, but it didn't ignite.
Once in Fred and George’s room, Harry shut the door after the two of them and set his trunk at the base of Fred’s bed. The air in there still smelled of gunpowder from the twins’ experiments, and the floor still littered with cardboard boxes like a warehouse—though it wasn’t the most crowded Harry’d seen it. Draco carefully sidestepped a box, and set his trunk down near the far wall, and looked around the room at all the bits and bobs, the Weasley’s Wizarding Wheezes merchandise peeking out of open boxes, and the Muggle music posters on the walls. He wrung his hands.
‘Do you want to fly?’ he blurted out, not knowing where that thought came from. But … now that he mentioned it, it would be more fun than doing an assignment a week early. ‘We could play a Seeker’s game. When was the last time you flew?’
Ginny laughed. ‘I noticed that too. Charlotte is her name. It’s actually pretty cute, the two of them.’
Malfoy let out a surprise laugh, turning to him with an eyebrow raised.
Blue skies overheard, the bluest of blue. The sun beaming down, warm on his skin. He was ... thoroughly relaxed.
Seamus had snuck in a big bottle of Ogden’s; so had Blaise Zabini. Cups were being passed around and drinks poured. Harry surveyed the group—everyone looked happy, looked relaxed, while a pop song played softly on the wireless in the background. Warm greetings went around as Slytherins and Hufflepuffs welcomed their Ravenclaw and Gryffindor guests.
After a time of quiet contemplation, of comfortable silence, they moved out onto the balcony. Draco cast a warming charm on them, as they snuggled up into a lounge chair together, wrapped up in each other’s arms.
This was going to go against all of his instincts for self-preservation.
Climbing into the driver's side, Harry strapped himself in and leaned forward to check the overhead mirror. Next, he stuck a key into a keyhole beside the wheel, and turned it. The whole machine whirled to life, and Draco gripped onto the edge of the seat without thinking. He wasn't quite sure about this. It did seem rather dangerous.
The ghost nodded, and blinked back at him patiently.
‘Yeah,’ Harry said breathily.
Well.
Draco pulled him closer to the water, to rinse off all the ejaculate from their bodies.
Harry paused in his tracks, and whirled around to find Lila and her group of friends excitedly coming down the hall towards him. ‘Don’t you girls have a class to attend?’
Harry clamped his mouth shut.
‘Don’t think I haven’t noticed you’re weird about him.’
Draco eyed him with obvious unease and uncertainty.
. You understand?'
'Interesting,' said Dave.
“Potter.”
Draco took a breath and eyed a closed-down shop display of colourful hats as they passed by. ‘Well, there’s the Colin Creevey Memorial Fund. It helps war survivors and the like with access to Mind Healers, magic prosthetics, or financial assistance when someone cannot work.’
He didn't know what to bloody-well say.
“Do you want to borrow a hoodie again?” Harry asked, like it were no big deal. “The one from last night might smell like campfire, Firewhisky, and who knows what.”
Astoria grabbed hold of Draco's arm, and lifted up on her toes, just as Draco bent down. Harry winced, thinking they were going to kiss. But, Astoria whispered something in Draco's ear, backing away slightly to look up meaningfully into his eyes.
,’ Draco said. ‘Harry, I—’
“Harry,” said Hermione.
Harry frowned. ‘So using the poor woman, then.’
. “You didn’t see my scars.”
He exhaled hard. It was all … kind of confusing.
Harry yawned, squinting at the weather report on his mobile. Nice. It’d be 14 degrees and sunny around mid-day. He could have a good long sit on his balcony, enjoy some sun.
Draco opened it up, and ended up lying on his stomach, stretched out, to read. But, he couldn’t concentrate on the words. He kept having to re-read paragraphs until he got fed up. He closed the book and peeked out over the edge of the dock. To his surprise, there were greenish-brown fish there, just swimming around, circling the dock. Some were tiny, some as big as his hand.
Merlin.
Malfoy gently started pushing Harry backwards, guiding him, while planting kisses on Harry’s cheek, his chin, his jaw, along the way, murmuring things that Harry couldn’t quite catch, until Harry’s back hit a solid surface. The tree.
'Horrifying.'
His Mind Healer over the summer had urged him to keep a diary, a journal, but he hadn't wanted to. After all, what happened, had ... happened. There was nothing left to say about it. And he didn't want to dwell on the past. He didn't really want to dwell on the present much either. Or the future, while we're at it. But she had insisted, said it was good to get his thoughts out and acknowledge them. Now the summer was coming to a close, and here was his chance to purchase one before the days got too busy with schoolwork and friends and things. If he waited any longer, he’d never buy one at all.
So, he did.
teach me?'
It’d been about fifteen minutes, and the onions were sufficiently cooked. Harry glanced at Draco, noticed the bandage on his arm as he lifted the glass up to his mouth. Harry flicked off the range—the onions could sit for a minute. ‘Oh, ah, it’s been two hours, we can take our bandages off.’
Draco snorted. ‘Now that’s a bit dramatic. But, yes.’
Potter exhaled slow. ‘I moved to Barcelona first, when I left London. Weeks passed, and the guilt of my sudden desertion became harder and harder to bear. Eventually I had to tell my friends where I’d gone, and my reasons …’ Potter squeezed Draco’s hand, just a little. ‘It didn’t go over well.’
upset.”
. He’s about to make love to his wife.
? It was driving Harry half-mad.
Then, Pansy sauntered over to the table. He hadn’t even noticed her when they came in. But there she was, looking a bit worse-for-wear, with darkness under her eyes and a plain oversized t-shirt paired with leggings. “Good morning,” she croaked, looking intently from Draco’s face to Harry's. “I see that my work is done here.”
‘Why all this trouble to make our journals alert us?’ Harry asked. It certainly seemed like Draco had done a lot of research. ‘Just curious.’
'Yeah?'
Morgan and Pansy appeared, making Harry jump.
He tried to smile. “I’m sorry you had to go through all that … but … I’m glad you survived it.”
‘Let me,’ Malfoy said. He grabbed the bottle, and poured a generous amount onto one hand. He dropped the lube onto the floor, and rubbed his palms together. Then he reached his right hand out for Harry’s cock, and his left hand for his own arse, lifting his knees up to ease his access.
'Yeah. Sounds good to me.'
He rolled his eyes. 'You are something else. Why did I hire you?'
He swiped his hands down into his lap, and twisted round to look out the window. Dark grey clouds billowed on the horizon.
“If it weren’t for her …" he began. He cleared his throat. Merlin, he might get emotional. “I wouldn’t have Harry. Suffice to say … I owe her. A great deal.”
The Fat Lady tilted her head up a sniffed. “Well I don’t know about that. I’m just telling you what I
And on their way back to Draco’s home, this time they grabbed some takeaway Thai.
“Draco! Are you done in there?” called Pansy from the other side of the bathroom door.
Draco could only stare at Potter as he unravelled everything that’d taken Draco years to figure out.
“But you can’t—”
‘Harry!’
‘Ah, okay,’ Hermione conceded, perhaps reluctantly.
Later, Harry found himself talking to Blaise Zabini. The drink was starting to make him feel warm, and a little light-headed. Could Blaise be his journal-mate? The idea intrigued him. Admittedly, he didn’t know much about the man—wasn't sure they’d ever had a real conversation before. He was rather handsome, Harry could privately admit to himself.
This was a man who'd run off to find himself. And he had … on an island in the Balearic sea. Making music for dancing, music for joy. This was the man who swims naked, who lays on his back and looks up at the stars.
“You told Minerva about this?”
“Harry,” Malfoy said again, coming around to face him head on. He
“Don’t lift your hand off until it’s all done.”
Draco slowly approached the counter just as Potter and Weasley walked away from it, with matching confused expressions. They didn’t even spare Draco a glance. He was used to that though.
‘Fuck, yes. Of course I do.’ Draco lifted himself up on an elbow and looked around. ‘Um, we just need … lubricant. Uh, where’s my wand? Oh, there it is.’
Harry felt vibrations underneath his hand—something was happening to Malfoy.
Draco caught his eye, raising an eyebrow at him, which Harry met with a smile.
“S’fine,” Harry said. Because what more could he say?
‘Yeah, mate, Luna told us,’ Ron said.
This time, he got up and extended a hand to help her up. Then they walked up the stairs hand in hand, and paused outside her bedroom door on the first floor.
'Yes, I’m sure,' Ruben said dryly, and Draco wasn't sure Ruben wholly meant it. The man turned around, and went back to his seat.
Draco scrolled down—he never scrolled down. Hadn't known to, before his class. The video description read, simply:
‘Go on, then.’ He wasn’t sure he liked the sound of it so far.
“I wrote them. I didn’t send them. The ghost,” he nodded to the space Ellie had just disappeared from, “she delivered them to you.”
“And I kissed him.”
These days, Draco Malfoy was the quietest, most unassuming professor of the lot of them. He kept to himself, often had his nose in a potions book or academic article of some sort, penning tidy notes in Muggle lined-notebooks. He even
Draco leaned back and squinted upwards, past the strings of fairy lights, past the tree branches, and up to the stars. ‘I did.’
Draco blinked at him. ‘Are you sure?’
‘Can I sit with you?’ he asked, standing just to Harry’s right.
He did.
Warnings: I think the only possible warning I'd have is for swearing?
Harry nodded, and picked up a mug to take a sip. Hot cocoa, laced with … was that brandy?
“And even if you were to like him, you know that I know that you’re … that word we aren’t saying yet. We may not have the most conventional of marriages, you and I, but I want to support you.”
They ate in silence, sipping at their espressos and looking down off the terrace, as their sides of the tiramisu got closer and closer to the other’s side. Then it was a thin strip, and they just went for it—finishing off the rest in equal bites.
Draco’s lip quirked up. ‘Still alive, I see.’
?” Ginny said, coming into the kitchen with a handful of letters.
Harry laughed. ‘Yeah. Yeah, you’ve got me there. Albus was the same. It was all, “Scorpius said this,” “Scorpius did that”.’ Harry rubbed a spot on his trousers, near his knee, with a thumb. ‘I just figured it was only friendship at the time.’
The coffee maker pinged to signal it was done. Right on time, because his cereal bowl was empty. He dropped it into the sink with a sigh, scrubbed the back of his hand over his mouth, then made to get himself a strong cup of coffee.
'Ah. “Sort of”?'
She laughed. ‘Okay mate, I’ll see what I can do.’ She walked off to the back to speak with someone.
(See the end of the chapter for
“They’re fine," he said, with a tone that suggested otherwise. "Except they always smell awful and they’re not all that soft.”
Draco nodded. ‘Enlightening … You know, before today I thought you were straight.’
She beamed up at him. “Yes! I love my brother so much!”
It’d been forever since he’d been on a date. He probably didn’t remember how to have one.
He heard some voices, and then the whoosh of the Floo—of someone arriving.
“Mmph—” Harry said against Malfoy’s lips.
'Oh stop that.'
‘Easy, get closer,’ Harry said, shifting himself closer to Draco so that his chest was just barely touching Draco’s arm, and his face rather close to the side of Draco’s head.
‘Oh fuck, yes!’
. Merlin, Draco. When have I ever steered you wrong?’
Harry tucked his wand away in the beach bag. 'Oh, not a whole lot, really. Just some cleaning spells at home, maybe an Accio here and there when I'm tired.'
“Astoria … you never, ever, need to apologise to me,” he said, miserably. “I’m the—”
It wasn’t bad out for autumn. There wasn’t any wind, just a refreshing chill in the air. The leaves hadn’t all changed yet, some green still remained. It wouldn’t be long, though, they’d all turn soon.
Harry cleared his throat, and picked up the bottle of Ogden’s. Without thinking too much on it, he held the bottle out towards Malfoy’s cup.
“Uh—” he began, scrambling to the foot of his bed to get a closer look, and then he searched around the room for a spellcaster. “Is someone there?”
The chocolates were delicious.
‘It’s … just normal stuff.’
Draco pulled away, after the snog had gone on long enough that it was almost ready to become something else. He licked at his bottom lip, which was rosier and glistening a bit from their kissing. “This was an odd place to have this conversation.”
'Good morning, Harry,' Hermione said slowly, looking him over with an arched eyebrow.
‘That’s fine. We’ll go back to yours? Figure out lunch later?’
Shutting the door softly behind herself, she entered and sunk into the chair across from his desk.
Draco had always liked old things—from Hogwarts itself to ancient old books in his father's library, to mysterious artifacts in shops like Borgin and Burkes. Something about … old knowledge, old ways of life. It was fascinating, just learning and imagining how others might’ve lived.
The Hamsters formed a line in the air to shake hands with the Slugs, and then the winners were paraded around the pitch—met with more claps and cheers.
Harry looked deep into Draco’s eyes. Even in the moonlight, they pierced him. ‘You have this calmness to you now. Like you’ve sorted through all the junk in your head, filtered out the bad stuff you’d taken on or inherited … and …' His expression was unreadable. Fierce. ‘You seem to have turned out to be someone I’d like to know, after all.’
So, by the time they’d finished eating, they had a plan. And for the rest of the day, they all set to work baking cakes, contacting guests to dress for a party rather than a funeral, decorating, setting up a dancefloor and music, ordering alcohol to be delivered, and rounding up enough brooms for a Quidditch game.
Harry wondered what Malfoy and Astoria were up to. Maybe they’d honeymooned someplace warm. Maybe Malfoy had gotten a sunburn. The thought made Harry snort out loud. Picturing Draco Malfoy on a beach was probably one of the oddest things he could imagine. Could Malfoy tan? Harry doubted it. Could Malfoy
Draco gasped. He really envied people who could that. Mulan’s father was a good man. Just like another self-sacrificing (handsome) prat he knew...
fine.”
"The smallest one, I suppose." He didn't plan to linger for too long. Besides, he'd already had a coffee this morning, and was very-nearly at his caffeine quota.
The smile faded slightly. 'I will.'
'Expecting—?'
Draco glared, and put a hand on his hip.
Happier times.
“I’m so sorry. I should have told you. I was selfish—I … I wanted you to marry me.”
Harry ran a hand through his black curls, frowning.
“Can we take the rest to go please?” Malfoy asked. His mouth was pinched, and he hadn’t even tried to say any of that in Italian.
Fucking hell.
So Pansy Parkinson went up on her tiptoes, wrapping her arms around Harry’s neck. She smelled of raspberries and felt small in his arms. It was a good hug—a tight one.
And Draco sucked in a breath.
Someone nearby shushed them.
“Draco.” Potter’s voice cut through.
Claps rang around the room.
Draco looked around the living room. Sofa, table, and wireless were all in their proper places. He still had papers from work strewn about the table, along with an empty mug he’d forgotten to wash before he left.
Harry nodded at him, so Draco tossed him one more smile before he wandered off, and greeted guest after guest, thanking them for coming.
He nodded. "Thank you. For lying for me."
have salt and pepper,’ Harry echoed, aghast, turning to Draco whom was looking decidedly displeased. ‘You aren’t sure?’
‘How was work today?’
‘Listen. Harry Potter plays a set every Friday night at some place called Sankeys. I found out on his Facebook.’
Draco ran a hand through his sweat-dampened hair. Yeah. He could do this every day. It felt good. His chest felt warm, like a little flame had ignited. Or, like he’d blown on nearly burnt-out embers, reigniting them into something with the capacity to grow. To burn brighter.
“Hiding away is selfish, cowardly, and it’s wasteful. You have a
'Don't jinx it,' Dave said.
'I think this'll be finished in time for Christmas,' he said, taking out a maroon-coloured scarf-like strip from his bag.
