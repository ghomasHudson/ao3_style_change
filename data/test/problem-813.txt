Draco lit his cigarette. He felt the heat travel through his body and the nicotine gave him a slight head rush. "So," Draco said and breathed out a cloud of smoke.
"Potter there were 40 people in the room when my father was killed, any one of them could have left DNA behind and the killer might not have. And that idea's stupid regardless."
Teddy looked up from his plate and shook his head at Harry. His eyes were blood-shot and his hair was black, making him look like something out of a Halloween film.
He dragged Teddy downstairs to meet Malfoy for breakfast at 9. He rolled his eyes when he saw Harry.
She answered immediately, flames jumping higher and her frazzled expression coming clearly into view. The bushy brown hair flying around her head only made her look even more panicky. "What's wrong? Is Ron okay?"
"You're a great, big oaf of a man who can't follow simple instructions! So obviously you didn't mean to! Hire a professional, Potter, how hard is that? But no, it had to be you who was almost suffocated by orange rubbish cause you were too busy singing Magic Works and dancing like a first year! What if I hadn't been here? What if it'd created a coating around your head? You'd die, that's what! If no one got up here in time—and believe me you, that manager of yours wasn't coming up any time soon—you'd be dead."
"You really think Wood will let a single quaffle pass him? The man's unstoppable, and I should know."
"Shhh, shhh, you're here. That's all I could have asked for. And you brought the boy hero with you, too."
"I'm here because no one else was deemed objective enough to be your inspector. And believe me you, I asked. But you're a hero, Potter, like it or not. So there's not a single person in that office not looking to get on your good side."
"I tell you, we'd be happy to see you over here. We don't need your OWL scores either, you'd have to take the English American Grading Levels Exam in order to qualify, but I'm sure you'd pass with flying colours."
"I don't think it's any of those things for me," a boy said. Harry was pretty sure his name was Quentin.
Malfoy cleared his throat, averting his eyes and scanning the room. Harry supposed that was his version of polite.
Harry groaned, lying back and trying to get swallowed up by the cushy rug he'd bought a week after he'd officially moved into Grimmauld.
She relaxed noticeably, and Harry did too. Usually, they started with the other stuff and Hermione would accidentally-on-purpose mention Ron later and pretend she didn't care how he was doing. Their breakup had been messy, and Harry still didn't really know why it'd happened.
Harry was sitting in his office trying to think of literally anything besides Malfoy when Ron walked in, presumably to save him from a slow and horny death and transfigured one of Harry's paperweights into a chair.
Harry flipped over the picture and looked at her form. "Interested in astrology and divination. Only drinks on special occasions."
"Fine fine, I believe you. Look, I might have convinced Malfoy to go to the ball alone. If it wasn't for whatsername I'd suggest the same to you."
"I work at a Bar too just to make rent. Dealing with the jerks there isn't half as bad as the Ministry."
"Testing the genetics of purebloods who have reformed their values," Harry said at the same time Draco said, "questions about people who've opinions on blood purity have changed since the war."
"You're kidding. You and Malfoy? I refuse to believe you would interact for anything unimportant. What do you even know about his life now."
Did that sound guilty? Did it make it seem like something would be happening that he didn't want them to see?
Neville taught at the school too, and they'd finally reconnected. He and Luna were a package deal now, and Harry found it really nice.
McGonagall patted him on the shoulder. "The event is over, Mr. Potter. I'm afraid you'll have to say goodbye to your companions for the time being."
At a quarter to six, Harry floo-called Hermione to fill her in on the events of his time the day before with Malfoy. When he was done, her eyes were wide and she was leaning forward in interest so far into it was like she was just a few centimetres from his face.
Harry did know. He could tell by the tone of Ron's voice that Ron knew too. Ron, the pureblood wizard who'd had a grudge against the Malfoy family since before he came to Hogwarts. Ron who would have had access to UnBottled Blood. Ron who was his best friend, sitting right in front of him.
Harry wasn't sure when the confusion had started but it was too late now for him to convince the man otherwise without explaining his real reason for accompanying Malfoy on his visit. He didn't bother correcting him.
"—to Gringotts Wizarding Bank automatically. Furthermore, in order to ensure proper economic success for the whole of Diagon Alley, unless the owners of the property can prove that the shop is still profitable by December 31st, 1999, it will be foreclosed. The Ministry is happy—"
"My reasoning hasn't changed since the project began or anything. It just feels like something I need to do- want to do."
Malfoy was wearing a cocktail waiter uniform and put up five Glamours as he watched: two to turn his hair and eyes brown, one to round out the shape of his nose, one to make him tanner, and one to make him taller and more muscular.
"You look so much like your father," Mr. Shaw said to Malfoy. "He was so ambitious when he was your age. Your mother always knew how to keep him in line, though."
Harry sighed loudly and got up, walking to the door and gesturing for Malfoy to follow. There was a lab the Aurors were allowed to use for fieldwork that could identify magical signatures in DNA. It wasn't quite the same as muggle policing, but it worked nearly twice as well. DNA could lie, magical signatures could not.
"Verity and I are waiting to see if the effects change over time. Fingers crossed we feed one to a canary and it turns into a small person."
If they weren't Potter-Crazy, they were overly invested in Quidditch, or hated it, or were simperingly sweet, or thought his crup was annoying, or were Ginny. So despite what his aforementioned best friend and ex-girlfriend might think, he couldn't seem to find anyone worth more than a third date. He mostly blamed it on the You're Harry Potter Problem, not to be confused with the I'm Harry Potter Problem which had only come into existence recently after one of the worst dates of his life.
He poured mugs for them both and they sat in silence at the kitchen table until the sun began to rise. They came to a silent agreement as the clock struck seven to go check in on Teddy. His back was turned from them but Harry could hear quiet sniffling and he motioned for Malfoy to be quiet. If he had been any younger, Harry would have gone in to comfort him, but as he was a teenager now, Harry knew that wouldn't be ideal.
I have to turn my head until my darkness goes,"  they shouted together, unheard by anyone but themselves over the music.
The bathroom was a mess when he went inside it and he wondered what the elf even did besides bring coffee. Not that Kreacher had done much cleaning before Harry'd sent him off to Hogwarts at his request. Maybe some elves were just like that. The floor was absolutely covered in used tissues and Harry stepped carefully around them.
"I thought you said you were a PU fan." Ginny's eyes weren't on the game anymore, and they hadn't been for a while now. They tracked Lee's movements as he stood up and leaned on the railing.
Malfoy stared at him again, his eyes doing the thing where they tracked back and forth across Harry's face like they were trying to find the joke, even when it was obvious. He eventually must have given up, because he sighed and sat down his cup, facing Harry halfway as best he could.
When they got back to Price's apothecary, Malfoy told him he'd better prepare to be impressed. They'd let go of each other's hands a long time ago but he could still feel the tingling and Teddy was still staring at them both skeptically.
Perfect, just perfect. There was no way Malfoy wouldn't try to sabotage the shop somehow, but Harry had to find a way to prove it.
The woman stopped him with a hand on his shoulder and he looked down. In his palm was a candy wrapper.
He arrived at the flower shop and opened the door. The sweet scent filled his nose and overwhelmed his senses. He hadn't been in this shop for a while, but he used to buy lilies here for his mother's grave, and before Andromeda had gotten older and he'd gotten busier, he'd taken her Pieris Japonica, the flowers from the Andromeda shrub. What he was picking up now was Narcissus, the intention of which should be quite clear.
Harry just stood there, glaring, not sure why all of the sudden it felt like he was being reprimanded by a professor or something.
Harry looked over the results of the handkerchief first. It wasn't a genetic match to the killer. There were enough ties to prove the pureblood theory, but not enough for them to be father and daughter. Harry couldn't find it in himself to think Mrs. Fawley had done it either. The result came back, she hadn't. No match.
Harry was convinced he might. Another guy arrived and tried to pull him off but the man below him was growling like he'd kill Harry the second he could, so Harry had no choice but to knock the other one to the ground as well using a little creative wandless magic and a lot of upper arm strength.
Hermione deflated, but he was positive she'd come up with something. Since bloody Malfoy wouldn't bother to tell him what charms would work.
They were far enough away now that the others probably wouldn't hear them if they spoke, but that also meant that Harry felt compelled to say something to break their silence.
"Between who did it? It's the person who killed my father, hard to have a preference there. On the one hand, I'd hate this for Astoria. On the other, I interacted with Mrs. Fawley, she was nice if not senile and I can't imagine her killing anyone."
Malfoy planned to tell her that he wanted to study Potions as she had and that he was struggling to get an apprenticeship due to his actions in the war. Mrs. Fawley was a potioneer who had worked for over 30 years selling everything from Pepper Up to Draught of the Living Death. She was a likely culprit according to Malfoy because of her views on Lucius's actions within the ministry and her famous UnBottled Blood which had been developed for use by healers but had been abused by criminals before as a way to strip victims of their internal organs and drain the blood from them piece by piece. Ron had explained the logistics of it over dinner once while Harry gradually lost his appetite.
It was the next day that he decided he needed a break from all the orange. He'd been going at it for hours, casting the spell over and over again, and was putting a strain on his eyes.
No. This could not be the end of Wheezes... But there was no way he'd be able to come up with his own ideas.
He put them, in side by side, and looked at the reading. "Both of these have remarkably similar magical signatures to you..."
"Gormless," Malfoy continued, and Harry decided he quite missed when he'd had to guess what he was saying, "twit."
Daphne softened but shook her head. "It would be too much for her. I'm afraid you'll just have to come back at a better time."
He'd been depressed— not suicidal, never leave your bed depressed, but depressed all the same— and something was finally clicking back into place in his brain. Maybe it would take a while, but now that he knew what the problem was, he could fix it. Probably with lots of therapy and medication. Hermione would help him figure it out.
Malfoy rolled down the window on his side, the wind whipping his blond hair across his eyes and drawing Harry's attention to the tight grip he held on the wheel.
Astoria stepped in front of them, her long legs demanding attention as she hooked one ankle through the railing behind her. "There's a better place just off Holborn that we could go to," she cut her eyes to Malfoy, "muggle. Not far from an apparition point."
The inside of the courtroom was mostly empty, but it looked only moderately less intimidating than the one he'd been in before fifth year. It had the same low benches and black stone as that one, with identical torches lighting the faces of the witches and wizards who were present.
When he knocked he heard a squeal from inside before Rose opened it. She was always excited to see Harry and he grabbed her up in a big hug.
Malfoy snorted and walked to his room. Harry went inside his and immediately owled Hermione. It would be a while till she responded.
"Potter, between the dinner with the Shaw's tonight and seeing Gibson on Monday evening, we have a full four days in New York. We aren't wasting it doing whatever it is you Gryffindors imagine is relaxing."
"If only he was bludgered before every match," Malfoy said. "Then you could explain how he flies the rest of the time."
Malfoy had looked as frail as the woman next to him. His face had been washed with an emotion Harry had never seen on him, even at his lowest, absolute anguish.
He dropped one off with Verity, who was cleaning out the Pygmy puff cage, and her wistful sigh was enough to make him laugh. He took the other two into the manufacturing centre, where he'd told Malfoy they should meet.
The pop of apparition when they landed at Grimmauld Place echoed in the silence. Had Ginny and Ron already gone off to bed?
"I... because I'm... I can't be into Malfoy. I can't. If I'm gay then... then I'll deal with that." He would, he'd find a nice boy and settle down and people would get over it. "But if I'm gay for Malfoy, if I'm gay with Malfoy, that's something else entirely."
The only remaining untested Candidate in London was Protheus Longbottom, the now-dead daughter of Enid and Algie. After briefly considering paying a visit to Neville, he realised the family connection between them was very slightly too distant for accurate results and he'd have to either visit Augusta or Neville's Parents.
"Shove off. I mean with what you say. Even when you're trying to be rude or professional, you never hide what you're thinking. I'm just saying I like that about you."
"Hi, I'm Jane Cannolen! I'm an Aerospace Engineer, I like surfboarding, and my favourite snack is celery with peanut butter."
Harry scribbled, 'D. Malfoy,' under the relations category and then 'Blond, pointy,' and 'absolute wanker,' under description.
Malfoy nodded and Teddy didn't say anything. His face was fixed in a scowl but his eyes showed how he really felt.
The logical solution was to owl Malfoy and call the whole thing off. He hadn't gotten an owl again after Hedwig, though, and the ministry ones were all busy doing more important things. He could call. That's what he'd do.
"You're sure you'd want to get back at them if you knew who did it? After the war, I felt like that all the time, but letting go was just... easier."
Harry glamoured himself and then Malfoy made him wait until it was exactly 7 before he could buzz the intercom.
Occasionally, Harry would hear the speaker on the bottom floor blast a staticky welcome message for visitors, but those moments were few and far between. Verity didn't come up to check on them like he thought she might, so he and Malfoy developed a rhythm all of their own.
Could Harry really do that? Could he know something Draco wanted to know so badly and not tell him? Could he live with never seeing Draco again, never speaking to him, never kissing him?
Harry groaned. "I don't want people applying just to meet me. What if they're more crazies or they want to tell the Prophet how long
He was working up the courage to ask when the hell Malfoy had learned to drive when he spoke instead.
He stopped just long enough to let her scribble on a napkin and put it in his pocket so he wouldn't be rude. He didn't plan on writing or calling, though.
Malfoy's lips thinned into a flat line and the heat of his glare could be felt even across the distance between them. "No, it's not likely."
"No, that won't work. It has to be an object of significance to the person, it can't be dead skin cells or their blood."
"Why are you laughing? You're the one who bloody set me up with him. I agreed to take out anyone you sent me."
Harry nodded and hesitated. It felt like there was something more to say. He looked at Malfoy and was startled to find him so close.
He walked over to where Harry was sat and, after a long moment's hesitation, eased himself up onto the table beside him.
The man who opened the door looked almost as old as Dumbledore had. His beard went nearly to his waist and his face sagged like it'd been smushed against glass. He led them into the living room and made them tea at Malfoy's request which was critical for their plan to work. It was how they planned to get the DNA.
The only exit other than the door was a window off to one side that hadn't been opened in a long time. He flicked a tissue off the sill and tried to pry it open. It wouldn't budge. He got out his wand and tried an Alohomora. Nothing.
Malfoy didn't say a word, but he flipped Zabini the two-fingered salute and pushed open the courtroom door, waiting for Harry to walk through before he shot two whispered spells over his shoulder.
A rumbling sound came from the back of the house and a loud 'click, click, click" proceeded Barkley bounding into the room and tackling Malfoy to the ground. Barkley sloppily licked Malfoy's face and his forked-tail wagged back and forth fast enough to take off somebody's head.
“Right, her house-elves thing…” Malfoy said, looking supremely bored. “I meant something related to my case. You said you were going to ask for her input.”
“What, like, Peeves?” Malfoy said, unbelieving. He shook his head. “Not a chance. Seven years around the most famous and powerful poltergeist in Britain, I think I’d know if it was anything remotely similar.”
“I heard my Gran say they can’t even Apparate in or out without permission. Their Floo is monitored too,” Teddy supplied thoughtfully, his hand hovering near the phylactery.

“There’s still a pretty good amount of light, and we will be outside the house,” Draco said, while Teddy was already putting on his cerulean jumper with a big T across it. “It will be fine, I promise.”
“I need your help,” Draco said, trying to inject every word with the seriousness it required. He began to talk.
“Honestly, living among muggles… How do you even communicate, then?” Malfoy said, shaking his head. “Didn’t you own the Black House? That was one impressive manoeuvring of inheritance law, by the way. It should’ve been mine.”
He breathed in and breathed out, purposefully and evenly. He saw his thoughts, acknowledged them and put them away for later. He turned the settling of the house and the now louder sound of the wind into a lullaby.
NOTES: Known association with Death Eaters sympathizers, previous criminal record. (See LV.78-7b & X.23-6)
“We’ll check that part out tomorrow,” Malfoy said. “It’s late, and nothing has happened. Maybe I did get rid of it,” he said, the last part almost hopeful.
“Reminds me of Draco,” Narcissa said, looking fondly at the boy, whose cobalt blue hair was catching the setting sun’s light that flooded the salon through the huge windows. “The house-elves used to find him playing with sticks and chasing the peacocks, trying to transfigure them into squirrels. A cause of great distress, to both the house-elves and the peacocks.”
They walked towards the trees and bushes that were too naked even for this time of the year, in Harry’s opinion, and up to the base of a huge tree.
His idea of having children had changed with time. Now, after having spent years seeing Andromeda with Teddy, and considering his poor efforts at helping her raise him, he didn’t think he was ready for children of his own. He loved Teddy fiercely, so having him there was all he really needed on that department. And as for Ginny…
“Oh, he knows I am,” Harry said, looking at his now-very-much-smiling godson. He got up. “Right, so… I better get to it. Ghost hunting time.”
By the time Harry was finished protecting the party room the sun was completely hidden behind a hill. Some quiet fell on the Manor’s grounds and inside the house.
be done by then,” Malfoy replied. “That’s the night of the main event. And the situation’s bad enough for me to be here… So, I take it you’ll do it?”
Anchored, right… Harry had heard about that. Just like Hogwarts was these days. Not even brooms could fly without express permission from a professor he had heard… Harry wondered if part of the rarefied air of the place was related to that. He hoped so.
Bit by bit, his busy consciousness slipped away, his racing thoughts decelerated and came to a stop. After a while, sleep came. The house remained unquiet, sleepless.
Refusing to reply, Harry went about his work and exited the room; he crouched and placed the phylactery just outside it, on the floor in a corner near the big wooden doors. It would be hidden when these were fully opened. He placed a hand on each end of the artefact and twisted the top one, then tapped it twice with his wand. The crystal inside lit up with a blinding white. Harry stood up.
A coldness began enveloping him. A coldness that had only been on the periphery of his perception ever since he arrived, but it had taken a firm hold of him now. A scrapping noise below. He suddenly felt glued to the bed, unable to move. A shiver coursed through his entire body.
“Well, the film didn’t melt so it’s not a basilisk,” Harry commented, mostly to himself, looking again at the label. “But with the right potions, yeah, I’m sure something will show up. From what you’ve told me it’s probably a poltergeist,” he hanged the camera around his neck.
It was that last thought, and the bite of his now cold toast and the taste of his terrible juice that began unravelling that brief moment of happiness.
The feeling of being watched, studied, assessed. The sound of something sliding. He covered himself fully with the blanket, the cold was outside him too.
—Potter was slow, and then he realized what he had just said that out loud. Slower than Potter today, not a good sign.
The more he read, the more his brow furrowed. He had always trusted Andromeda’s judgement, but this time… He finally looked up to find that Malfoy wasn’t sitting in front of him anymore. Confused, he looked around until he heard the rustling of robes on the living room’s carpet.
“I told you, I’m not some sort of… haunting expert.” Harry said, opening his rucksack. “But I did come prepared.”
“Insulting my friends won’t help your case, Malfoy,” Harry said irritably. “Which takes me to my next point: Why me?”
Andromeda looked from mother to son, intrigued. Before she could formulate the question, Draco piped up:
“It’s not,” Malfoy said. “I’ve been to haunted houses; half of all pureblood’s homes are haunted to some degree. And I don’t mean places full of chatty, ridiculous ghosts and cackling poltergeists like Hogwarts, I meant proper hauntings.”
Harry ignored Malfoy’s babbling and the mild pain he felt on his chest, and focused instead on the letter the owl had brought him. It was from Andromeda.
"Potter, you could walk into the Ministry of Magic in the middle of the day, pull down your pants and take a big, steaming shit on the Atrium's floor and they would leave it and put a commemorative plaque next to it."
“Well,” Teddy began, entering the room now, looking around. “There’s no place for anything to hide.”
Harry stood alone by the window, mulling over what had just happened. From there, he could see his room, there was mud all along the wall up to his window. He got dressed to go outside and take a closer look, but the neglected and well-treaded grounds offered him no clues.

“Alright, then,” Malfoy said, leading them now to the right through an ample corridor. Harry noticed the change in the atmosphere almost immediately. It was still spacious, but he stopped feeling as if he was on an abandoned building. He hadn’t noticed how tense his body was, but he relaxed more and more as they walked towards their destination. The painful memories were a distant blur now, his mind presently focused on the problem at hand. “Here we are,” Malfoy said.
“Oh, well, uh…” Harry replied, seeing that the letter at the top was Hermione’s. “Hermione’s pretty happy. Another big donation for S.P.E.W. came in.”
“I know what I said: displaced objects, levitating glasses, small footsteps in the night. It’s not about what it does, it’s about what it… feels like…”
“This all sounds like a job for the Spirit Division, Malfoy,” he said at the end of Malfoy’s tale, pouring more tea on his guest’s cup. His own had gone cold, sitting untouched besides him on the counter. He returned to his position of arms crossed over chest. It wasn’t that he didn’t believe him, but that the whole situation was so bizarre, starting from the fact that Malfoy had come to him for help, and going all the way to the sight of the very wizardly-looking blond sitting on his kitchen, surrounded by the fridge and the microwave. It was a clash, a whiplash that reminded him of the Weasleys making the Dursley’s not-chimney explode all those years ago, or of Dumbledore simply sitting on the Dursley’s living room, glasses of wine tapping his relatives on the head.
"Me too." Harry replied. "Do you want to get out of here?" After seeing amusement pass over Draco's face, Harry quickly added, "Not for like, sex, necessarily. I'm just getting cold but I don't want to go back inside. Though I do want to have sex with you, I mean, if you want to. That is." The words tumbled out of his mouth like he couldn't keep up with them.
Harry leaned in and he spoke right next to Draco's ear. It sent a chill through his body. "Nothing, I was just thinking how I've been wanting to do this for a while now."
Harry gracefully slid his hand behind Draco's neck and pressed their lips together. Draco pulled away, mostly out of shock, and a worried look flashed over Harry's face, but Draco quickly moved forward and kissed him again.
Draco watched as Harry slowly pulled on a pair of dark gray sweatpants and a white T-shirt. "Breakfast?"
Harry brought over two red and gold painted mugs, which made Draco chuckle. Harry raised his eyebrows in defense and smiled, "Hey! They were a gift from Ron and he's kind of shit at gift-giving. I probably have a hundred Gryffindor-themed items hidden around this place, if you look hard enough."
Not very well-liked, me." Draco let out a long breath that he didn't know he was holding, saying Malfoy with a bit more distaste than he had intended.
Harry moved towards him and fit Draco neatly under his arm. "Look at me," he gently grabbed Draco's chin and raised it to him. "It's behind us now. You did what you had to do, just like I did, just like we all did. We were all just kids. It's okay, Draco."
Draco woke up to the strong scent of coffee. As he opened his eyes, he quickly felt a throbbing headache coming on. Looking around, it took Draco a while to notice that he was not, in fact, at he and Pansy's apartment. The quiet realization set in as he heard a door open and shut down the hall. He desperately shifted back into the position he was sleeping in, trying to look like he was just waking up. But when he heard Harry chuckle, Draco knew he had seen him.
Draco walked closely behind him, noticing how curly his hair really was. Harry made a left Draco was not expecting and he bumped into him. Harry turned around, smiled, and teasingly said, "Back off of me, Malfoy." He opened a closet door Draco hadn't noticed and handed him a soft, deep green towel. "I can bring you a shirt to borrow if you'd like."
"Yes, count to three, please?" His voice faltered at the end. Draco wasn't scared of the pain, obviously, it's the anticipation that had him shifting in his seat.
After Draco had apologized, he felt lighter. There were so many others that he owed conversations to, and now he felt like he'd have the courage to do it. Harry's presence was so warm and inviting, Draco had never really been around anyone that felt like this.
"Yes, much better. Thank you," He said, looking up into Harry's eyes. His magic felt like stepping out into the sunlight on a clear, bright day, and it gave Draco goosebumps. A clock going off somewhere in Harry's house snapped them both back to reality.
Malfoy kept looking at him without saying anything and Harry didn't know how to fill the silence of if he was even supposed to. Finally, Malfoy spoke up.
"Yep!" said Harry brightly, ruffling her hair as he walked past. "Half an hour left to get ready, and I expect you to be out right on time. We're not missing even a second."
Harry was feeling uninspired. Uninspired and lousy and dull and a whole slew of other things that weren't important but made him want to bury his head in a pillow and scream.
Malfoy didn't look like he believed him, but he didn't press the issue. He picked up Harry's hand and held it, tracing the veins and not looking into his eyes.
"No. Well, a bit. Her portrait is still hanging in one of the hallways. Nasty woman, always shouting insults and complaining. We've got her covered up with a curtain but she isn't pleased about that either."
"So," said Harry, mostly to stop the silence that had settled around the table, "you're Malfoy's boyfriend, then?"
He stepped back and within seconds Neville was stumbling out of the fireplace, followed closely by Dean, Seamus, and Luna.
They stared at each other, the pub much quieter now than it'd been the whole rest of the evening. It was almost possible to imagine that the people he could hear hooting and hollering outside were his friends, though he was sure they'd gone directly to the apparition point without much stalling.
They'd developed a routine of sorts, the three of them, over the past few months. Harry would wake up from nightmares sometime around 4 am, start the training exercises that Robards had assigned to him so he could register as an Auror in the Spring, talk to Hermione in Australia while it was still early enough for her to be awake, and then make breakfast for Ron and Ginny. It was simple, easy. Which is why, when Ron read Harry the letter he'd gotten from the Ministry, his heart plummeted to the cellar, stopping to keep Kreacher company for a while as he did whatever the fuck he did down there.
"—to send an inspector around to monitor the shop's proceedings and send back reports on the patronage, net income, and potential for growth. If this letter has been received by mistake, please contact..."
They ended up getting bagels, danishes, and all kinds of other pastries at a corner shop a street away. He and Malfoy both ordered coffee which tasted strange and Teddy let Harry take a picture of him with Times Square in the background when they were done. When Harry told Malfoy he had something in his teeth before he got a shot of the two of them, he only rolled his eyes and got rid of it instead of breaking down in tears. It was, all in all, a very fun morning.
He accidentally stepped on Malfoy's finger as he got up and apologised quickly at the hiss of pain, backing up all the way to the orange panels outside of Fred and George's office, leaning against them as he stared openly at Malfoy.
Her eyes were impossibly bloodshot, and her hair was tied up in a knot. That was all he could see of her except for the overlarge shirt that he knew said, 'Let's all just keep our fingers crossed and hope for the best,' scrawled across the chest. It had once been George's.
It explained why George had left, too. The perfect ending to his career, Harry supposed. Everything exploding, and all of the ideas he and Fred had spent their lives cultivating suddenly gone forever.
Malfoy looked like he was holding back an entire barrage of insults, which was actually quite entertaining, as much as Harry was starting to feel the same way. His ears had gone all red at the top and he was working his jaw back and forth as he breathed out heavily through his nose.
"Fuck, Harry-" Malfoy choked out, and that was it for him. Harry felt his orgasm rip through his body faster than it had since he was a teenager. He groaned against Malfoy who was coming too and pulled him into another kiss that started out hungry and ended slowly with them just breathing the same air. Harry pressed one more kiss to the side of his jaw before collapsing on top of him.
There were plenty of people who could use his help. He was an Auror offering his professional skills to someone he didn't even consider a friend. There were so many people out there who could need his help, and yet he'd chosen to help Malfoy. Not to mention, he should be devoting all his time to fixing The Problem. He should be pushing Ron to look at the questionnaires and set him up with someone he might actually like who wasn't a snappish, mean, crup hating, smoking, death-eater-dad-missing man.
He did the first thing he could think of. He used his fame. Clos Maggiore might not have had room for a table at eight for any common man, but they certainly had room for Harry Potter.
"If I quit," Malfoy continued, and this part he said slowly, clearly, those cold eyes locked on Harry, "your shop is closing—no ifs, ands or buts."
Malfoy stood in the doorway, looking at the office with a sneer. Harry felt weirdly defensive of his progress, so he was already on edge.
Malfoy had grown into his features since Harry had last seen him, not looking nearly so pointy and now missing the dark bags he'd had under his eyes since the beginning of sixth year. His hair wasn't slicked back like it used to be, either, instead falling partially into his eyes until he brushed it away with a hand.
"Just shut up," Malfoy said and pulled him back into a searching kiss. His mouth was hot and slick and his tongue felt like magic.
The next morning they got up early so they'd have time to visit a museum before the baseball game. Harry kept zoning out as Malfoy explained the pieces in that posh accent of his. Teddy nudged him in the side to tell him they were leaving about 3 times before he got his attention.
"Exactly. And he's not even the worst. There's this one girl who says she's written you a new poem every day since she was 15–she's graduated Hogwarts now—and she's still waiting to hear back."
Harry tried his best to kick Malfoy under the table, but he was already consumed with murmuring to Ginny and Oliver about something that was making them laugh loudly and Jerome look uncomfortable. Distraction came in the form of Dean and Seamus. They looked happy to be there, both decked in dark muggle suits with red piping and joined them at the table.
Malfoy stood and nodded, stalking to the floo and disappearing into it resolutely. It felt too fast, too all-consuming. But the house was finally quiet enough for him to hear everything else.
Hermione snorted, shifting in her seat. "Choose away. You start acting like a great big baby whenever Malfoy's around."
He smiled grimly at a lady who gasped as he went by. It had been a long time since Harry had practiced any sort of climbing in his Auror training. The wall was more slippery than he would have liked and at one point his bootlace caught on the brick and he slipped, only just managing to grasp hold again. He heard shouts from below him and then felt the magic of a levitation charm warm his body.
This couldn't happen. The shop was Fred and George's favourite thing in the world. It was their creation, their lives' work.
There were seven more people he needed to obtain DNA from to tell if they'd killed Malfoy's father. He needed an excuse to get it or something they'd done magic on.
His father had gotten released from Azkaban thanks to a willingness to report fellow Death Eaters after only serving 3 years of his 10-year sentence. Malfoy had been engaged to Astoria at the time, despite not being in love with her. He did love her dearly as a friend, though, and wanted to marry her. They stayed engaged for two years after his father got out before Malfoy learned that Astoria's mysterious illness wasn't going to get better. He couldn't stand the thought of putting her through childbirth when it would kill her, so he'd called the wedding off as his only real reason for marriage was to produce an heir. He regretted it now because she'd gone on to marry another man who didn't love her and had had a child anyway, taking more energy out of her at the later date than it would have if it'd been Malfoy. He hadn't been back to see Astoria before Harry had gone with him.
"Yes, right here." Malfoy pulled a crumpled bit of parchment out of his robes and handed it to Harry. The list had more than forty people on it!
Not knowing Malfoy outside of work and sometimes-Teddy context proved to be a problem later in the day. Clos Maggiore didn't have a table available at eight that night. He tried to find a way to talk to him through a coworker, but he was already off work. Harry checked the time. Shit, almost six. He barely had two hours to fix this.
After a quick peek inside the room, he located it about halfway across the floor, covered in a solid coating of orange and fallen on its side.
When Malfoy heard about the present promise, he dragged Harry and Teddy into a shop of his choice despite their protests. Harry tried to reason with him that Hermione wouldn't want a purse, or earrings, or a scarf and that she'd instead want a book or a nice set of pens. Malfoy had laughed and told him the whole point of gift-giving was to buy them something they wouldn't get for themselves.
"Not great things. The Quibbler's nice, of course, but the Prophet thinks you've gone round the bend. Witch Weekly is mourning their chances with you."
As for the actual logistics of the grand re-opening event... Harry groaned. He'd need to talk to the Prophet to get the word out, and he'd ask Luna to run something in the Quibbler too, though it'd reach considerably fewer people. Then there was figuring out the date. Malfoy had suggested the start of December, and he could write to McGonagall to figure out the nearest Hogsmeade weekend to that so they'd be sure to get some business.
The ball was in the Ministry's biggest room. The music playing wasn't the typical ballroom music, and he remembered that the current organizer was trying to combine muggle and wizarding culture. The band switched from something muggle he didn't recognise to A Cauldron Full Of Hot, Strong Love. There were tables along every wall, decked out with the finest foods and alcohol, and practically everyone Harry had ever met was there. The crowd turned to look at them and Harry thought at first they were admiring his date before realising they were just shocked to see him at a public function so close to his last one. Alicia didn't seem to mind the attention, but she let him drag her over to a table with people he knew wouldn't spend the evening fawning over him.
Harry snapped closed the Malfoy Murder Mission file he'd been not-really-examining, but instead of this giving Ron the impression that he now had his full attention, it made him snatch it from Harry's desk.
When he finished work later that day, he wasn't any more enthused about giving a speech, but at least he no longer had to face the trials of getting up.
"Around you. Around anyone. But that's not the kind of connection I'm used to making. I've never tried sharing that kind of thing with someone before."
"Ron. You look well." Hermione's cheeks pinked as she said this, and she wouldn't meet either of their eyes.
Everything started when Hermione begged him to speak at the Fight Against War Orphan's Depression auction because she'd overbooked herself. He wasn't against helping out the charity, he'd started it himself — with Hermione of course — but no matter how many times he had to, he still hated public speaking.
The light attracted at least ten other children who'd been dragged along by their parents and they all crowded around Harry. Malfoy winked at him from where he was mixing. God, what Harry wouldn't give to laugh at him entertaining kids instead.
"Well I was talking to a bloke from work and he was telling me that a muggle got arrested for plugging their phone into a train and taking the electricity. I figured you'd be able to clear it up."
"Oh, that's lovely." Not a crup-hater then, that was a good sign. "I can't say I've ever understood someone announcing their Hogwarts house, though."
The kids all looked at him sadly and a few were brave enough to come up and say goodbye, even in the presence of their headmistress. Before they all left, Harry made sure to give the sixth year boy who'd gotten the dragonfly and the fourth year girl both congratulations.
"Well, women love a man who can dance, don't they?" Malfoy asked and he and Ginny broke into laughter again.
Draco laughed and flipped over so he was facing Harry then scooted down so he could lie with his head on his chest.
"Well." Malfoy looked at Harry again, and he realised with a jolt that Malfoy was asking for guidance. That somehow—at least compared to how he felt about the others—Malfoy trusted him.
Malfoy nodded as the door shut and then let his face twist into a sneer. "Barmy old man. He was practically gloating over the death of my father."
Harry's only job was to walk around and mingle but he hated mingling and spent most of the evening hiding in the corner.
When they took their seats, Harry somehow ended up next to Malfoy. He still felt uncomfortably close to the eye-fucking tournament going on just a short bit of space away, so after lots of eyebrow-wiggling from Ginny that he was pretty sure was supposed to convey how funny she thought the whole situation was, Harry decided to scoot further down the stands, if only because seeing Ginny in such good spirits had become something of a rarity.
The only light was provided by the windows, which spanned the entire ceiling, but it was pouring rain outside, so they weren't doing much.
"Then drop the formalities, Potter. I'm not your boss anymore." Robards gave him one of his rare smiles and Harry returned it tentatively. After all, he'd just been fired.
Though Harry could no longer hear him, he got to watch as Malfoy's pale face grew redder and redder, making him into a very gratifying shade of scarlet.
"Oh!" Malfoy shouted, and Harry felt his rushing surge of relief that his careful politeness had finally evaporated. "Well if you don't like what I've been doing, maybe I should change it up a bit!"
"It's no surprise you're struggling to come up with ideas, Harry. Grimmauld's got a Boasting Diskie infestation like I've never seen before. I could have my dad come take a look if you like."
She nodded and grabbed a handkerchief from her robes. "I'm sorry, I shouldn't be so emotional. We've known for years now that she's dying. It was giving birth to Thalia that put her on bed rest. She can't even manage magic anymore. That's why they broke the engagement off, one of the reasons at least. Draco always needed an heir and he didn't want to put her through that."
He worked off some of his nervous energy doing his Auror exercises, but he couldn't help feeling a bit silly about the whole thing. Was he really going to sign up for training next spring? It had always been the plan that he and Ron would do it together, but he had a feeling that wasn't happening anymore.
Merlin, this whole thing was so bizarre. Harry couldn't believe he was actually thankful for something Malfoy was doing, minor though it was.
The energy had died down a little bit, so they didn't have to yell to hear each other anymore. Malfoy was picking at a basket of chips, laughing a little at Harry.
Harry almost laughed at that because not all curry tasted the same and so surely there would be something she liked but he didn't and instead suggested she get one of the House salads which she did.
"I've been trying to come up with some, but they're never any good. I was hoping clearing out the office might help, but that'll only keep the store open for so long. My friends have been trying to help too. It's just not going anywhere."
"I don't know. Maybe it's because he was a death eater, or because we were enemies at school, or even just because we've started to become friends and I like it. I don't want to ruin it."
Malfoy huffed out a laugh. "I see. Well, you've still got time. I've seen shop owners who were worse off and still managed to pull it together in time."
Mostly he just wanted Malfoy back, still sitting on the couch next to him, resuming that moment where Harry had almost felt like they might be about to kiss. It would be a long night.
People in the audience (see: the press) had not been happy to hear him "Attempt to Humanise the Darkest Wizard of All Time," as they'd put it.
It would have looked odd if Harry had left quickly, so he sat by her bedside and waited. She was much older than the last time he'd seen her. Her hair was grayer and her face was sunken in. She didn't look much like Neville anymore.
The man beneath him immediately stiffened and Harry grimaced. He'd knocked the guy to the ground, surely he wouldn't still get preferential treatment. A crowd had gathered and were taking pictures. This would be in tomorrow morning's Prophet no doubt.
After not knowing for sure if the other one had been able to retrieve DNA at the Greengrass's until they were already outside, they talked through their procedure for Mrs. Fawley.
"After the war.. when there were funerals every other day and people were grieving constantly, I was in the paper a lot for attending funerals. They never wrote about the people who died, just about how brave Harry Potter had shown up to pay respects."
Back at Grimmauld Place, his bag was packed and the candy wrapper was safely in his desk. The fact that he hadn't had to take the DNA by force didn't change his decision. They were still going to New York.
Harry sighed. They were closer, that much was certain, but he knew something was missing from all of this. Two somethings, actually.
"You didn't! You have a smart and beautiful wife who supports your job, and knows Quidditch, and isn't only into you for your fame."
Harry wondered why he'd said it. There hadn't been a lot of thought involved, except that he knew he didn't want this night with Malfoy to be over just yet. He wasn't ready to go through the stages of Malfoy warming up to him again, not now. He wanted this Malfoy—open and honest and talking to him like they could trust each other—for a little while longer.
Hermione put coffee and eggs in front of him even though he hadn't wanted them and he tried to pick at them enough to assuage her as they talked.
"You sound like such a teenager talking to your mum in front of-" Harry cut himself off. "So, how'd you convince her to use muggle technology anyway?"
Harry nodded and started toward the kitchen, telling Malfoy to make himself comfortable. He was feeling more than a little bit out of his depth, but after defeating the worst wizard of their time, surely he could handle Draco Malfoy sitting in his house.
Malfoy huffed. "Remember when I asked you the question about stealing electricity? Weasley and I have a long-going bet that we know more about muggles than each other. I was trying to win. Apparently, Granger has taught him a few things."
"I wasn't sure if I should leave you alone outside by yourselves or not. Wouldn't want you to get carried away."
Harry snorted. "Yeah, fair enough." He struggled to think of anything. "We both went to Hogwarts, for one."
Harry apparated to the ministry on Saturday morning with a pit in his stomach. Today was the day they would test the last of their samples. At best, Harry's instincts would be proved simultaneously wrong and right and the killer would be one of the people they'd found in New York. At worst, it would be his closest friend since he was eleven.
“Yes, right, uh… Well, she said she can’t really say anything substantial just yet. It sounds like a regular haunting to her…”
“Is your Gran okay with this?” he asked, looking around expecting to see her walking towards them. “Didn’t you get almost eaten by a bunch of apparently haunted vines? Is she here?”
“Modesty suits you as well as those dreadful glasses, Potter,” Malfoy reproached him, genuinely, it seemed. The blond sit back, staring right at Harry’s eyes, his movements were more fluid now, almost catlike.
He hadn’t spent much time recently on the manor’s gardens, not even after his and his family’s house arrest had ended, but he was sure plants didn’t die as quickly and… stubbornly as the ones all around him did. To his surprise, his mother had even hired a muggle gardener to take care of them but that proved to be as ineffective as doing nothing, maybe the plants missed the house-elves.
Harry rolled his eyes and huffed, not giving Malfoy any more of an answer than that. The leather jacket was also Sirius’, he had found it in a trunk in his room in Grimmauld Place, back when he thought he could handle to live there. He suspected he now had worn it more than Sirius ever did. It was pretty snug by now, even with some sloppy Extension Charms added to it, one more and Harry was sure the thing would burst at the seams. He also wore his work jeans and boots, they had been with him all through his Peru and Egypt trips.
“I don’t use it much,” he elaborated with a shrug. “It’s here for Ron and Neville, they like Doctor Who and come here to watch it and Nev takes care of the garden and I let him run whatever Herbology experiment he wants there. Hermione doesn’t like television so Ron…”
Near the entrance to the house, after stashing the bike away on a shed and retrieving his ever-useful rucksack from it, Harry saw carriages being unloaded by bored wizards using levitation charms. The sight of activity was refreshing after that silent and dreary walk. Dreading to go inside, Harry turned to Malfoy.
(in passing, surely she didn’t mean anything by it, surely she didn’t refrain herself from writing “please save this fool from burning down the bloody house”). If that was Malfoy’s idea of strategic…
He let the thoughts take over. He’d never been more at ease or comfortable at night. Shame and guilt seemed foreign, strange and fleeting in that moment, like they had never been a part of him. Full of thoughts and feelings and memories he hadn’t realized he’d been saving, he closed his eyes, caressed the sheets with one hand and then just as slowly began caressing himself with the other, starting with his naked chest, then lower and lower and lower…
“These ones were for the Malfoys’ bedrooms,” Harry said, setting up the last one. “But since you’re here…”
An even closer creak. He should open his eyes, turn around and see… What would he see? What nightmares Malfoy’s story would conjure up, only to vanish a second later? Only to realize nothing was there, nothing had ever been there. An empty room with only a stupid idiot covering under the blankets.
“No, none, well…” That last one didn’t count, did it? One could hardly classify a chill down one’s spine when passing in front of a door as an
“Then who else have you asked? I couldn’t possibly have been your first option,” Harry wondered. “What do your pureblood friends experts in hauntings and all things magical think? Surely they’ve visited you frequently, experienced something.”
“Yeah, he promises,” Teddy said, now walking towards the entrance hall. Draco followed him, before anything else happened.
He managed to turn to his side, away from the window and towards the door. He exhaled vapour, just the once, as another unidentifiable sound was heard. A cold feeling pulsated from deep within his chest.
Potter eyed him suspiciously. Well, more suspiciously than he had been since he opened the door. His too-big-arms-crossed-over-too-big-chest stance had not changed one bit.
Good question, Harry thought. He wouldn’t have put it quite so dramatically but still, good question.
He took the letter below Hermione’s. It was from… an acquaintance at the Auror Office. He scanned it quickly, having read it already.
“She’s fine with it. Says you’re the best protection one can possibly get,” Teddy shrugged. “And she’s not here. She had boring adult stuff to do. A ‘most urgent matter.’”
He had arrived just last night from the Caribbean, completely portkey-lagged and underfed, and had had trouble sleeping. After a lot of turning around in bed and way too much Sleeping Potion, he’d finally managed to do so. Then, under two hours later, the doorbell had rung. Cursing, he got up, put on the wrong bloody glasses and walked as carefully as he could down the stairs to open the door to one of the very last people he had ever expected to find there.
“You Malfoys really go all out on your parties, huh?” Harry commented without expecting an answer, reaching for his rucksack and opening it. He rummaged through its depths, made deeper by an Undetectable Extension Charm courtesy of Hermione, until he realized he could just summon what he wanted with his wand. It still wasn’t his first instinct, even after many years of using the bag, or of being a wizard.

“Really? I told you, that’s where almost nothing has happened so far,” he said as if explaining something to a child much younger than Teddy. “That’s the whole reason we’re having it there.”
All the blond git needed to do was keep his pretty mouth shut, Harry thought, between annoyance and relief at not having to relitigate his opinion on Malfoy.
Harry swooped down. He was grateful for Malfoy’s Locating Spell on his compass since visibility of the ground had been almost nil for the last fifteen minutes even with the strong headlight of the motorbike on. Ever-thickening fog covered that whole area. He was about to cast another Warming Charm on himself when he saw it: Malfoy Manor rose like a black ghost ship stranded on a grey sea. His mind idly tried to place the style of the house. Victorian? Edwardian? Gothic? He had heard those terms been thrown about, but he had no real frame of reference. It certainly looked old, grand, and dark, and—he finally decided—absolutely Malfoyian. The sight sent a shiver up his spine, maybe less so because of the spectral appearance of the scene before him than because of his memories of the place.
“Oh. S-sure,” Harry said, standing up as well, clumsily. Malfoy looked at him oddly with those icy grey eyes that had been hidden in shadows.
The blond man who had been steeling himself just outside the room sighed and finally made his entrance.
He discovered, again, that he still missed her terribly and felt horrible about the whole situation, but that at the same time the image of Draco Malfoy there didn’t bother him that much. Malfoy not bothering him much, now that was a disturbing thought, which coupled with last night…
“Dealing with hauntings or curses or whatever it is on your house normally takes from a couple to several days, depending on the severity,” Harry explained, putting the letter aside both physically and mentally. “Do you think I’ll be done by the 31
“It would seem so,” Malfoy replied quietly. Harry’s retort died on his lips upon hearing what he thought was a sincere tone.
“It’s the most recent addition to the manor,” Malfoy said, the tone in his voice the most relaxed Harry had heard until then. He didn’t even try to make a crack of Teddy and Harry’s dumbstruck expressions. “Finished last week, just in time for the party.”
“We’re holding the party in the less er… haunted part of it,” Malfoy said as several floating lanterns on the sides of the path up to the house began to turn on as they passed by.  Their light didn’t make the atmosphere any less threatening. Harry’s hand held his wand firmly. “Well, that’s reassuring,” Harry deadpanned, turning off the light of the bike with the other hand.
Harry looked up at the top of the leafless trees, their dark and twisted branches cutting through the grey fog like black spidery veins on sick, pale flesh. He shivered, the cold air creeping under the several layers of clothing until reaching his skin. Taking one step closer, he raised his hand to touch the cold dead trunk of one of them, without taking his eyes off the branches above. He wasn’t sure if it was the images of veins and blood that his mind had conjured up, but he could feel the faintest of heartbeats under his palm. As if blood or something else, something thicker and darker and ancient was coursing through it. As if it was part of something buried deep within the earth, as if all the trees around him were. A light, almost imperceptible buzz began to fill the air.
He had aimed at the bush, the spell hit its target and cut Teddy free. The boy crawled away from it at top speed, panting and slipping a few times on the muddy ground.
“Hey, Teddy, do you want to go see the er… glow-worms in the garden?” It was best to let Mother explain, or don’t; whichever she chose to be the wisest route. “Maybe we’ll catch sight of some Flitterby moths or fairies.”
“It all would go on public record,” Malfoy said, taking Harry out of his musings, his voice as unsteady as it had been during the whole tale. “It’s been that way ever since your friend Granger pushed those policy reforms. Mudbloods clearly don’t understand the concept of privacy, of not airing one’s dirty laundry in public. My family obviously doesn’t want any of this out there for the Prophet to put the worst spin on it. Not without the party this close.”
“What happened?” his Mother asked him, while Andromeda crouched to take care of Teddy, who kept shaking his head and refusing to look at any of them.
“If your Grandma’s okay with it,” Draco replied, looking at the setting sun in the distance. The days were getting way too short way too quickly now. Goosebumps invaded his skin, and his mouth was suddenly dry. Teddy and Andromeda should leave as soon as possible, he thought, before anything happened.
“Yeah, well, we’ll see…” Malfoy said, avoiding Harry’s gaze now next to him. “Maybe after you fail miserably, I’ll show you how it’s done. I had a good hang of it back when I rescued your godson in the garden. The activity even calmed down a lot after that. A couple of strategically placed spells…” He dramatically dusted off his hands.
Harry was lying in bed a few minutes later, after Malfoy had shown him to his room on the third floor, conveniently next to Teddy’s. The thick fog and clouds had relented a smidge, and he could at least see the fuzzy outline of the full moon and the hazy silhouette of what he assumed was a dead tree. Delicate silvery light and murky, ever-changing shadows came from the giant, imposing window—so different to the ones in his comparatively tiny house—and lend the room an unworldly atmosphere. He was lying on the finest sheets he’d ever seen or touched, and the world’s most expensive-looking blanket was on top of him. It had been unknown to him than going to sleep could be quite this… expensive, this comfortable. The ominous and ethereal light and the feeling of the exquisite beddings somehow strayed his thoughts back to Malfoy.
The rest of the tour went on mostly in silence. Harry tried to memorize the layout of the house for later, and solo, inspections, but it proved fruitless. The manor was vast, dark and confusing. Harry swore they had reached a room at the end of a hallway, only to leave it via the same door they’d entered and being greeted by what looked a completely different hallway. Malfoy didn’t seem to notice, and Harry did not bring it up.
“It feels wrong. It’s like… you can’t trust your own home, like everything’s familiar but at the same time not. You recognize every room, every object in the room, every person in the room but they’re all… wrong. Like there’s a predator, a dark beast stalking around every corner, waiting for a moment of hesitation, waiting for when you stop thinking about it. Then you suddenly can’t pick up a quill, a pair of scissors or even a small book you dropped because you have the thought that they’re not yours, like you’re the invader here. You’re trespassing and you don’t want to get caught because the worst things in the world will happen if you do. And the people… you can’t trust the people either. They’re going to tell on you. Or… or they’re not them, but of course they are, you’re just being stupid. A light exploded last night while you were reading and made you drop your book and now you’re being the same stupid idiot who couldn’t pick it up so it lay on the floor all night. Then the person talks to you because you’ve gone pondering again and did… they always talk like that? Did they always move like that? Is that concern or they’re onto you? So you leave without replying and go back to your room and your book’s not on the floor, it’s on your bedside table sitting straight up waiting for you, but that couldn’t be because you locked the door, you lock all the doors now… You can’t let the thing that stalks you and watches you and thinks about you at every moment get you... So no, it’s not a bloody poltergeist.”
Malfoy’s face recounting his experiences appeared on his mind’s eye. That must be it. He closed his eyes, trying to erase the image. Bloody Malfoy…
“Nothing,” he bit out without meaning to, and took a sip of the tea. “Tea’s nice,” he said as he put it back down. He did not let go of the cup, clinging to it as if it were an anchor on a sea of awkwardness.
Harry was about to argue with him but ultimately decided it was best not to. Pathetic as it probably was, he rarely won an argument with his godson. He found it difficult being strict with him, even when needed, so he usually left that part to Andromeda. It all too often left him feeling completely unequipped for the role of godfather, even after all those years.
Their steps on the polished stone floor echoed all through the house. Harry saw spurts of activity here and there, mostly members of staff getting everything ready for the Malfoy’s party, but the vastness of the building overpowered any presence, making them feel like the only ones there. Streams of fog-filtered light poured down from the huge windows, illuminating their path through the manor.
“She is,” the boy replied, too quickly. “If not, I can just ask Harry. Maybe he can come too,” he added after a second of consideration.
“Right, their arrest is up until the night of the party, actually. Very dramatic,” Harry said a shade scornfully. “Well, I think you’ll find the Malfoys are quite resourceful,” he added as evenly as possible, aware that they were Teddy’s family too.
(and what was with that ridiculous long hair?) and the angles of his face even more pronounced. He looked like a cartoon drawn by someone who just had Malfoy described to him and never seen an actual picture. Harry’s brain, despite still being in the sluggish process of waking up, took all that in and then focused on the next, most urgent, thing: Malfoy was wearing bloody wizard robes.
The bush caught fire. Draco swore he heard a distant, angry cry. Then the fire extinguished on its own, way too quickly, leaving only a few ashes and a burnt smell behind.

At first impression, Draco Malfoy looked much the same as he’d done in his school years. On closer inspection, however, it was evident that he was taller, although roughly the same height as Harry, and paler and
After a light supper in one of the sombre kitchens, in which Harry had been surprised seeing Draco handling a few cooking utensils with ease (not to mention even offering to whip up something quick for Harry), they sat in the half-lit space in silence. Malfoy was lost in thought, seemingly struggling with something. Harry used the chance to look at him closely. When he wasn’t posturing, filled to the brim with arrogance and contempt for most everyone, Malfoy still had this elegance about him, Harry thought and hated himself a little for it. He hated himself a little more for this not being the first time he’d thought such things. Before, he’d been lucky since the man always had said or done something utterly vile right when Harry’s thought began to stray in those unwanted directions. But he was quiet now, quiet and still and with a solemn expression Harry had seen little of before. Their sixth year at Hogwarts came to Harry’s mind immediately, followed by the few times he’d seen him during the war. He’d seemed small and pathetic then, just a kid. A man now, the concern in his face lend him a gravitas Harry found himself puzzled by.
“And as for friends…” Malfoy took a pause and looked away, his arms were crossed. “They did use to visit. They just... stopped.”
They agreed to the terms of it all, with Harry refusing any kind of payment, (“I do this for Andromeda, not money,” he had said.) and arranging for Harry to be at the manor the next day, an hour before sunset when, according to Malfoy, it was when the “activity” usually hit its peak.
“I thought they couldn’t leave yet,” his godson observed, looking away from him and staring at one of the amulets.
“You seemed pretty sure back in my house. Impressed with my resumé and all…” Harry caught up to him.
Harry was barely listening. Malfoy’s enormous wardrobes had no doors; they had been taken off their hinges, leaving the inside exposed. They were empty. Same went for the rest of the room’s furniture: all the doors were removed; all the drawers were on the floor; a wooden chest was on its side, its lid missing. All the clothes were on the floor or on top of chairs, sofas and tables. Malfoy looked embarrassed now. He mumbled something that sounded like an excuse, took the book and left the room in a hurry.
“I wanted to see you,” Teddy said, taking Harry’s attention away from Malfoy. “And I wanted to be at the Malfoys’ party, and watch you defeat a ghost. I never get to see you do any of your heroics, I only read and hear from others about it and you never tell me about the good ones.”
“That it’s none of their business,” Malfoy supplied. “So, Granger has nothing?” he didn’t wait for an answer. “Can’t be too surprised, no use asking a… muggleborn anything on these matters.”
A thump. Only now he noticed the constant creaking of the house, the constant settling of it, never quite at rest… A whole house turning and tossing as he did most nights before falling into a light, uneasy sleep. Only, for it, sleep never comes. Its eternal unrest masked by the sounds of everyday life, left ignored, unattended, free to seethe and plan.
It was only when he ringed the doorbell to number 42, that the curious onlookers had seemed to realize something and at least pretended to go about their business. Draco relaxed a little, which was just as well, because the next part was going to be the tricky one.
Draco was about to reply with an energic negative and a command for them to get inside so Teddy and Andromeda could leave, when he heard it: A high-pitched scream, a tump, and the sound of something being dragged over dirt, leaves and twigs. It took him a couple of seconds to make his body move and even while he was running towards the source of the commotion he felt his legs stiff. Coldness dribbled down his forehead and a dry hammering had begun to manifest in his chest.
The barn owl had looked rough when it arrived. Teddy had insisted on keeping her there so it could recover. The animal didn’t protest much, she seemed to be in some sort of shock and was now in Harry’s room.
“Here,” Harry said, taking a step back and then grabbing Malfoy’s hand and positioning it just right. Malfoy’s eyes opened wide.
So much for foresight. Divination had always been his weakest subject anyway, Draco thought before tripping spectacularly on the entrance and almost falling face first. Strong arms caught him with his nose centimetres away of getting broken. The arms lifted him and helped him to steady himself.
“It will be fine, Teddy,” Harry said, softening his tone. “They don’t pull much out of me, only when actively protecting against something… So unless uhm… your cousin Draco here has an infestation of dementors the size of Azkaban and they all attack at the same time I think I can handle it, all right?”
“All right,” Harry agreed. He had no desire to revisit the place. The unfathomable darkness of it and the potential of some kind of horrors were last on his list of reasons.
“Yeah,” Harry replied, his mind still thinking about the contents of the letter. Well, not so much the contents as the tone of it: the thinly veiled guilt-tripping. A small part of his brain told him that he was just guilt-tripping himself. Yes, Andromeda had mentioned Teddy and the incident in Malfoy’s house, but his mind had added the “
How had he allowed the conversation to shift in this way? Harry shook his head and took a sip of the disgusting cold tea, forcing it down his throat. It helped.
“There you go. They probably saw your name on them and creamed their pants in excitement. Frankly, I’m surprised they didn’t send something along for you to sign.”
“You knew that would happen, didn’t you?” Harry sat on the bed, feeling sore all over. Some spider he was…
“It’s not like he’d know you’d be enough of an impulsive prat to just try and Apparate on a potentially Anchored place,” Malfoy said while leaning against the doorframe with his arms crossed and a mocking expression, yet he looked like he’d come running from the other side of the house.
The cold air outside hit him hard, his breath immediately forming clouds of vapour in front of him. Likely not a favourable climate for glow-worms and fairies, a stray thought informed him. Never mind the fact that it was bloody October. Nevertheless, he followed Teddy on his search around the garden.
“Show me where it happened,” he said, in a well-practiced business-like tone, the one he had found made people do what he wanted. “The incident with Teddy. It was in the garden, I recall you said?”
“It feeds on my magic,” he explained to a very interested Malfoy and a slightly frowning Teddy. Both were crouching next to the artefact looking at it. “As long as I’m around the house it should protect the room from a large range of dark magic and creatures. I need to place a few more around the room, some on the outside. I brought just enough for the one large room; they’re pretty rare and thus hard to come by.”
“I see… Well, she really didn’t say anything more. She offered to look in some books, and ask her friends at the Spirit Division but you said…”
“The food’s good,” Teddy jumped in at his defence, although Harry didn’t hear him, nor he heard Malfoy’s response.
“Look over there, same direction as me,” Harry instructed, pointing right in front of himself. Malfoy turned around obeying him, but not without a half-hearted huff in protest.
By the time he snapped out of his trance, Draco was sitting by a countertop holding a cup of tea. Potter was standing in front of him wearing those ugly grey pyjama bottoms and a tight black sleeveless shirt, with his much-bigger-than-expected arms crossed over his… that was much more chest than Draco was expecting to see. Potter’s skin was also much darker than he remembered seeing on the Daily Prophet lately. In short, it was all a bit much. Draco’s gaze went up to Potter’s
"Thank you, yes please." Draco felt like he was possibly being overly polite but this was a first for him. Most blokes he went home with either kicked him out quickly or didn't really want him hanging around so that's what he was used to. Not this, and definitely not this with Harry Potter, it seemed too strange to be real.
That made Draco relax, but he still felt a sense of urgency that he couldn't identify. "I should probably go," He said after a brief pause.
"Thank god," Harry mumbled into his mouth and Draco felt his chest flutter a little bit. They kept moving together, grinding on each other, kissing each other until Draco was breathless and felt light-headed. He pulled away, motioned bringing a cigarette up to his lips, and raised his eyebrows. Harry nodded, understanding his intention, and they slowly made their way through the mass of bodies out towards the exit.
Draco huffed but was already feeling tingly at the prospect of seeing Potter, "Fine but you're helping me pick out my outfit and making me a drink."
"Nice earrings," Harry said right before they lifted the glasses to their lips. Draco watched Harry's throat as he swallowed the liquid. His olive skin seemed to glow in this light.
"Thank you," Draco said as he scrunched his face and set down the shot glass. "Another?" And they each took another.
Draco and Harry had been at this little game for a couple of years now. At first, he'd see Harry at a pub with Ron and Hermione and would avoid that pub for a while. Then he started to see Harry at the bars and pubs he was at to avoid Harry, and Draco started to put it together. Harry was seeking him out. Then Draco started to seek Harry out. And he really started noticing how fit Harry was, how much taller he was, how handsome he was. They'd only spoken a few times, drunkenly ran into each other many times, nothing serious, but Draco wanted more. He craved it, but he never really knew how to go about it.
The first thing his eyes were drawn to was the door. It was closed. He looked around, no one else was in the room. It was only then that, catching up with the rest of his awareness, he realized the noise had been distant. He relaxed but remained alert.
An old well of shame and guilt was opening up inside him the more he stared, yet he couldn’t look away. It felt so right to keep looking, and so wrong.
He tried to force himself to look away, but in that dark, dreary and downright depressing place, Malfoy was the only sight that give him anything resembling light, however brooding his face looked. He stared at his right hand, long and veiny and firmly gripping his wand. Harry’s breathing became just a tad shallower. Images of his Auror training years began to trickle in… Memories of late-night parties with his mates… Echoes of those unwanted contemplations came forth clearer than they had in years.
