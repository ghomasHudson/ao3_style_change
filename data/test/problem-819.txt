"Granger said I could borrow her book," Draco defended.
"Well, we could sleep in for a bit and then eat lunch there at the three broomsticks, and after that we could go to honeydukes and wherever else looks interesting. We can leave at 11."
"Yeah she could like anyone she can fuck, like Blaise here," Draco smirked.
“You’re hopeless,” Ron muttered.
"Yeah," Harry simply said as words failed him again, Ginny always seemed to be better with words.
"You totally like him," Ginny snickered and Harry groaned because maybe he did like him. Just a little.
"Who wants to bet he's going to try and room with Potter?" Balise said as they got up, earning a glare from Draco shot over his shoulder.
Neville's face burned at his words and turned to hide his face.
After almost two weeks of pining and struggling to ask Draco to the Yule Ball, he’d finally worked up the courage to do the letter idea that Hermione had suggested. He’d written out a quick note asking Draco if he’d meet him after classes ended for the day, and that he was sorry about the other day.
"Well excuse me for trying to make conversation."
Harry situated himself between Draco's legs and lightly trailed his fingers along the waistband of Draco's underwear.
"We were able to snag a lot today while everyone was eating. Figured we could use it for future games if we have extra," Seamus supplied.
"You can stay for a bit right?" Draco asked.
"Me too, I'll be here till we go back though," Hermione said with a smile.
"How would a stupid dare change how the punishment went," Pansy mocked, "It could change everything! You should be thanking me for the chance to kiss him!"
"I don't mind, it's just a dare," Neville all but whispered and Blaise had to fight not to smile.
"Why on earth would I ask him out?"
"Alright," Hermione sighed, realizing she'd never win, "but you two better give them some hangover potion tomorrow if they feel bad."
"Yes, the rumors are true," Draco said noncommittally as he made his way towards the stairs, the rest of the sixth years following behind.
"I said I'd help," Harry pouted.
“Yeah… I wasn’t sure what to do.”
Ron snickered, "Seems like she's getting told off." Pansy was putting down the bottle she had just picked up when the rest of eighth years started showing up.
When Draco finally got in bed he found he couldn't sleep. He kept thinking back to the kiss he shared with Harry. Draco reached his hand up to his mouth and ran his fingers over his lips. He could still feel Harry's lips pressed against his and he couldn't get it out of his mind. Draco's eyes wandered over to where Harry was sleeping spread out on his back, his mouth open. Oh how soft Harry's lips were and the taste of alcohol on his breath, it was intoxicating and he had the urge to go over and wake him up if only to feel Harry's lips on his again.
"Oh yes, Ginny invited me today," Luna said and smiled over at Ginny who turned slightly pink around the ears.
Ron stared off at the fire for a moment and then let out a long sigh. "If he likes him I don't mind. He's been through a lot - we all have - and he deserves to be happy. I'm just worried, you know? Malfoy has always been terrible to all of us, especially Harry. I don't know if I entirely trust him yet. I know that he isn't entirely to blame for what all he did during the war, but don't you think Harry's being a bit too forgiving?"
Harry suddenly turned red, forgetting that he even had the jumper on. Draco thought faster than Harry though, "He was cold and I don't need him complaining about a cold later," he said, pushing past Ron with an eye roll.
"Do I need to? He's always a git," Ron laughed and Harry high-fived him over the table and Draco shook his head.
Harry was grabbing the last cushion when he heard someone coming down the stairs to the girls dormitories. "Hurry, someone's coming," Harry hissed, grabbing the cushion and running for the stairs, Draco hot on his heels.
"Well, maybe I wasn't interested in being 'just friends'," Draco whispered in his ear, making him blush harder and try to back up again, but Draco's hand on his hip held him in place.
Harry sent Ron, Hermione, and Ginny grateful looks.
Draco looked mildly shocked at Harry's idea, "Have you ever even pulled a prank before? I can't remember you ever pulling one."
His girlfriend had just been kissed by another girl, and hadn't seemed to mind at all. His mind was spinning, but before he really had a chance to contemplate it, the next pair were kissing:
Draco rubbed the back of his neck awkwardly as he agreed, watching for a moment as Harry walked towards the exit before catching up.
"What were you thinking?"
Draco nodded his head numbly, he wasn't really used to being taken care of by anyone other than his mother.
Hermione looked at him in shock for a moment before finding her voice, "Thank you, I'm sorry too. I suppose we've all said some mean things." She shot him a smile that he returned.
Both Ron and Hermione groaned, “You’re helpless.”
Draco had snuck off to Blaise's dorm room early in the morning because he was so nervous over the date that he didn't want to see Harry yet.
"Ten!" George shouted gleefully, seemingly unaffected by the cold.
"Bloody hell," Ron groaned as Harry and Draco returned to their seats, "My eyessss."
Draco groaned and slammed his head down on his books.
"Fine, I'll talk to you two later then," and with that Draco started walking back towards the castle with Harry hurrying to catch up.
"Let's go down to lunch, that'll make you feel better," Luna said, grabbing Ginny's hand and leading her down to the dinning hall.
October 24, 1998
Hey all, I'm back with the next chapter now that finals are finally over! Also, today is my birthday so here's an early update.
Happy Christmas Harry!
"Have you lost it? Malfoy? Really?"
"Simple. I know where the laundry room is so we can steal some extra blankets from there and then we can steal pillows from the common room."
Just as Harry suspected, as soon as he stepped foot onto platform 9 ¾, he was swarmed by reporters asking questions in rapid succession and taking his stunned silence as answers and drawing their own conclusions. "The Savior Of the Wizarding World: rendered mute from trauma" was sure to be a headline on some article by midday. Luckily Hermione was much better at keeping her head in a swarm of reporters and managed to yank them all onto the train and in a compartment before it got too bad.
“Ow!”
"I love you," Draco whispered.
The whole room seemed to reek of Draco.
When they entered the dorm they were instantly bombarded with the scent of alcohol and a stream of confetti.
"And if I do?" Draco shot back with an air of superiority that made Harry simply glare back.
"Alright," Draco said, a blush dancing its way across his cheeks.
"So you admit you are interested?" Pansy smirked.
"Yeah, you guys kept it really well hidden. Though it does make more sense now, you guys make a cute couple," Ron said and smiled over at them.
-----------------------------------
"Greyback lived here?" Harry asked, not exactly surprised.
"That's not what I meant!" Ron whined.
Lavender took Goyle's unwillingness to kiss her the wrong way though, and looked extremely put out as she went back to her seat.
"I'm headed home to spend it with my dear old mother," Pansy said with a roll of her eyes, stabbing her food with her fork.
“Hey, that’s true!” Ron said, catching on, “No more headaches from the colors! That’s gonna be nice I bet.”
"Okay," Harry said and tucked his legs up under him, Draco's eyes followed the movement.
Draco turned red and looked down at the table and Harry was about to continue when the waitress showed up with their drinks and Harry quickly retracted his hand.
Draco was a glowing ball of red light now. It was quite dazzling and it was even better now that it didn't give him a headache. Harry giggled a little drunkenly as he stumbled a bit into Draco's side.
Draco's mind was spinning, on one hand, he knew Harry along with everyone else was worried someone had infiltrated Hogwarts again and he really should let them know that it wasn't a death eater. On the other hand, though, Pansy was his best friend (even if he was furious at her at the moment) and he had no idea what would happen to her if anyone found out. He couldn't tell anyone if he wanted to protect her too.
Harry woke up fine, better than fine actually. He woke up in Draco's bed, curled up against him and feeling well rested and happy. When he tried to stand though, he had to grab the side of the bed to keep him up-right. It was like his legs had turned to jelly and he was aching all over.
"Yeah?"
Blaise absentmindedly turned to look at who was sitting to his left and suddenly remembered that he was seated next to Neville when his eyes met Neville's. Neville's face was one of slight shock as Hermione started the countdown.
"Nah," Draco leaned on his elbows that rested on the railing, "If I marry, it'll be for love."
"Yup! It's the best place on the grounds."
"I don't know... Oh! How about Hogsmeade?"
"Don't worry, no one's around."
Draco shrugged, "Too late, what is it?"
"Anytime." Harry smiled as Ginny wrapped him into a hug.
"Who would try to sabotage our potions assignment though?" Harry asked.
Draco hated himself for getting up in the middle of the great hall at the end of dinner to walk over to Potter of all people, especially with all the stares he was earning. He didn't know why but he felt the distinct need to show the entire great hall that he had some kind of claim over Harry. He would adamantly deny that his sudden show of possessiveness had anything to do with the recent inflow of constant confessions to The Boy Who Lived though. The love letters, although annoying beyond belief, had nothing to do with it at all. Nothing. And the night they spent together two days ago also meant nothing, of course.
"I don't have a specific place I want to go, though I'd like to go to Honeydukes."
"I think a lot of families want to spend time with their kids after last year," Ron said, "Families are getting a bit closer I've noticed."
Ron seemed equally confused by the turn in attitude but never-the-less made the best of it and kept up a lively conversation with both Harry and Hermione. By the time they got to the Great Hall both Ron and Hermione had shot glances at each other about 100 times.
"Why of course, Gryffindor always wins." Draco rolled his eyes. "But, in any case, I didn't do this. It was all Ron... and probably Dean and Seamus."
"Dracoooo," Pansy laid across Draco's homework, forcing him to look up
"Truth."
Ron turned to look at Harry, who was staring at Draco not-so-discreetly and then he turned to Hermione who was still red in the face. Luna and Ginny were still kissing and Ron tried not to look, it was weird seeing your little sister kiss someone, no matter the gender.
"Well you are always up to something!"
Harry grabbed Draco's wrist and pulled him through the hole. They both had to crouch a bit to get through and when Draco looked up he found himself in a small cave. Just as Harry described, it was completely closed off on both sides, so if you wanted to get out without going through the hole in the rock, you'd have to get a bit out into the water and swim around.
"Well maybe you should take her advice. Maybe you'll get a man," Blaise said jokingly, and an eyebrow cocked.
"Not at Hogwarts," Ron grumbled.
Hermione sent him a disgusted look, "Don't talk with your mouth full, it's disgusting."
Draco let out a laugh.
"They treated you poorly didn't they? What did they do specifically," Draco felt worried, then he added, "You don't have to tell me if you don't want to, I don't mean to pry."
“If you were worried about coming in on us naked then you’d give us a heads up before you show,” Draco grumbled as Pansy walked into the kitchen.
"I'm exhausted," Hermione said, yawning and stretching her arms above her head.
“I mean sure, it’s pretty to look at from the window, but it’s cold and soaks through your socks.”
“On New Years! Very excited to not have headaches all the time.”
"For sure!" Neville said happily and picked up his butterbeer, downing the last bit.
"Well thank ya, I'm glad ya like it," Hagrid said, smiling at him. Draco ran out of meat to throw then and was forced to look up at him.
I got you a Christmas present too, I wanted to give it to you before break but then I spaced it. Sorry about that, don't worry I didn't forget about you Love.
"Tell me about it." Harry swung his legs off the bed and stood up, walking to his trunk to get out some clothes.
Now, I’d like to thank you all for sticking with this story until the end and for all the kudos, comments, and bookmarks. They’re what kept me going! I’ve never finished a story that was more than one chapter before in my life, so I’d proud to say I’ve finally finished one.
November 4, 1998
Ron shot Seamus a teasing glare and Seamus laughed, already crawling over in front of Hermione.
Harry let out a small laugh, "Ready to go then?"
"Alright, works for me," Harry said with a smile, that Draco returned with one of his own. They stared at each other for a moment until Pansy cleared her throat.
Draco said yes.
Neville smiled back as he headed out the door.
"She's going to be drunk soon if she keeps at that," Ron muttered, shaking his head.
Draco
"Yeah, together."
"What is it?" Draco said with a resigned sigh.
"Think he'll give us the spell? I got some people I wouldn't mind giving a new look to," Ron snickered and Hermione shook her head at him.
"For the hangover," Draco said, handing it gently to Harry. Harry sat up and gratefully took the vial and downed it in one gulp, the headache ended almost immediately. "Got Pansy to give me two."
"Nothing, why?"
Draco leaned in before he could lose his nerve and their lips met with a spark that sent a shiver down his spine. The kiss quickly picked up as Harry brought his hands up to Draco's arms, but then as quickly as it started, it ended and Draco moved back to his side of the circle. Draco kept his eyes averted as he took his turn.
"Stop screwing around," Harry said, shaking his head, "and I do not smell you."
"Yeah, it can be difficult, with just the two of us. But it's worth it," Neville replied with a small smile, equally happy for the awkward silence being broken and talking about his favorite thing.
"Yeah, thanks again."
"He went to visit someone," Ron informed her when she let go of Harry.
"Ex-Death Eater," Harry corrected, "We've been over this. Plus Hogwarts would be honored to have you teaching there."
Hermione wrapped her up in a congrats sort of hug and Ginny smiled, happily accepting it.
"Harry, you're back late," Hermione let out an awkward cough.
"Hey guys," Ginny greeted.
"If I could, I'd kiss you right now," Harry said, reaching a hand under the table and brushing his fingers across Draco's.
Harry leaned down then and kissed Draco's forehead, "I can't blame you. They can get noisy."
"Well I can arrange for you to be kissed like that too if you'd like." With that Hermione leaned forward and pressed her lips to Ron's, her eyes fluttering closed.
"Professor Snape just finished analyzing the potion and it seems it wasn't just an accident," Pomfrey said in that matter-of-fact way nurses seemed to be able to do, even when giving bad news.
"Draco. We both agreed to call him that," Hermione shot Ron a reproachful look, "and you have no place to criticize, Harry can date whoever he chooses." While Ron continued sputtering she turned to look at Harry, "Thanks for letting us know, even if you didn't actually tell us, but you know what I mean. I'm happy if you're happy."
Ron looked over towards the restrooms, but he didn't see Hermione yet.
Now he just had to wait.
"I've never bought anything though. It's mostly Gryffindors who buy this stuff."
"Stop teasing," Draco said breathlessly and Harry loved the slightly strained edge to his voice.
“That is like the worst possible thing you could have done, was that why you two were ignoring each other for a while?”
That was four days ago and today Draco was finally able to leave the hospital. The time in the hospital gave him a lot of time to think though and he felt like the time he spent laying on the bathroom floor, watching as his blood mixed with water and stained the stone floors, broke something inside him. He'd seen his life flash before his eyes and he'd been so close to death that perhaps this was the universe telling him that he had a second chance to try again, and if that was the case, the way he was living now was not how he wanted to spend his second chance.
"Goodnight, 'Mione," Ron said, leaning forward and giving her a quick kiss as they reached her and Ginny's room.
"Yeah, no problem," Ron said, quickly hurrying off to eat.
He could be happy if he got to experience this.
"Wha-" Draco murmured, confused why Harry was the one waking him, and unsure where he was.
"So, I've been talking to people for you guys because I imagine you haven't talked to anyone yet to see if their interested," Ron and Harry flashed her sheepish grins. Of course Granger did all the work, Draco thought, rolling his eyes as he listened to their conversation from his bed. "Anyway, there is interest, but not enough for two teams. I was thinking that instead of making two eighth-year teams that just have games against each other, what if we just make one and that team can have practice matches against the house teams?"
Harry pulled away then, his eyes still closed. His lips were slightly swollen and red, Draco noticed and was about to lean back in when Harry murmured, "We should probably head back to the room before we actually are caught."
Harry knew he was upset, could see it in his shoulders and the expression he made as he hurried away, but he just couldn’t seem to ask him to the Yule Ball. He wanted to hit head against a wall. “I’m so dumb,” he muttered to himself, hurrying to catch up with everyone as well and resolving to try to talk to Ron and Hermione later.
"Yeah, you promised to tell me what happened while you were at Draco's as well," Ginny said, flopping down on Ron's bed.
Hermione got up to go to the other side of the table.
"What]'s wrong?" Neville asked when Blaise dropped his bag down next to his seat next to him in herbology with a sigh.
"What exactly are Wrackspurts, Luna?" Ron mumbled around a bite of food at Hermione shot him a look at which he promptly closed his mouth and continued chewing, this time with his mouth closed.
"I give you plenty of privacy." Draco and Blaise shared a look.
"Wha-! That was not your place to tell!"
Hermione blushed at the praise, "I know you said you only saw four colors, but are they different shades? Because, my first thought was that maybe the colors correspond to soulmates, and that's how the veritaserum ties in. Like only two people have the same shade as each other."
"N-no! Of course not! We are being punished, remember?" Draco stuttered, which only made Blaise laugh harder.
The next day Harry found himself on the quidditch pitch running through a practice game. They were playing a practice quidditch match but with no snitch and less players on both sides.
"Nobody knows yet though, you're the first person I've told, so please don't tell anyone."
"I'm bored!" Harry shouted back hoping to cover up his embarrassment.
------------------------
"Thank you! I finished assigning the positions really quickly, I wanted to catch you," Ginny said smiling. Then, "Could I talk to you?" she looked a bit nervously at Draco, "privately?"
"I don't think it's that bad at all," Lavender said. She seemed to be enjoying watching people kiss.
“Either way, still doesn’t explain it.”
"Hey," Harry reached out and touched Draco's cheek, "don't be sorry. It's fine if you aren't ready. We don't have to do anything, I understand."
As Harry nodded meekly, Draco’s expression changed from blank astonishment to mischievous excitement. This reaction made Harry’s nervousness recede. He took a moment to look at his creation and finally take it all in.
In the light of a street lamp he stopped again for a moment. There were so many butterflies in his stomach now, he was sure he was going to be sick. Taking a deep breath, he took out the letter once more. He just had to read it again, making sure he was not imagining things. The small tidy handwriting had a soothing effect on him. He traced the lines with his fingertips absentmindedly before going on, letter still in his hands.
“Here, let me” he said and took a step towards his boyfriend. After a second’s hesitation Draco surrendered and let Harry pull a tiny crimson leaf from his hair. Draco looked at the little thing with loathing eyes. Quickly he ran his fingers through the blond strands, making sure everything was back in order.
Harry had only a short distance to walk, not even five minutes but they stretched on eternally. He did not know if Draco was there already, waiting for him. His feet seemed to grow heavier with every step he took and he wanted to turn back around and go home. He was a little scared of what was to come. At the same time he was really excited and wanted to run, race and fly into Draco’s arms. He clutched the letter tighter and kept walking.
As if Draco knew Harry was watching him, he turned around. Harry’s heart skipped a beat. His mouth went dry, his hands sweaty. The butterflies in his stomach were doing somersaults. He took the last few steps in an almost-run stopping only inches in front of Draco. He wanted to touch him, to kiss him but did not dare to.
“I don’t want to look adorable” Draco pouted. “I want to look stunning. Graceful.”
“What did you do?”
“Come on now” he said “let’s go home and warm up.” Harry was a little surprised that Teddy did not protest. They seemed to have actually tired him out, Harry thought with a grin.
Once they were in Harry’s kitchen, Draco and he quickly fell into practised patterns. Harry started to heat milk carefully, so it would not burn, while Draco started rummaging in the cupboard for the mini-marshmallows, he left there the last time they had made hot chocolate. Teddy was standing on a stool next to Harry, wanting to help. He stared intently into the milk, waiting for the first sign of steam.
“So, what brings you here today?” he asked and looked at Draco with his startling green eyes. Draco hesitated only for a moment.
Draco was pacing up and down restlessly. He still could not believe what had happened. The last years he had mostly spent trying not to think about Harry. Not very successfully. He missed him horribly and could never stop imagining how life could have been with Harry by his side. Without having to hide or sneak around. And he knew he wanted that.
“Don’t worry. I don’t intend on letting him have any. Not after last time.” Harry calmed her with a smile. He still remembered the brain freeze headaches he and Teddy had had a few weeks ago and very much did not want to repeat that experience.
Draco did not know how long they sat there like this. At some point Harry’s sobs ebbed away but they kept holding onto each other silently.
“Yes, I know. And you do.”
“You have them too?”
He noticed a wicked grin spread over his godson’s face, amber eyes sparkling with excitement. Both his companions let go of his hands. He watched how Draco, laughing blithely, started chasing Teddy around the autumn-wonderland, Harry had created. A warm feeling spread through his chest as he watched the two of them race each other.
Many evenings spent together in front of the fireplace talking or playing games but most of all probably the peace and freedom after the war had caused it all. Draco Malfoy had admitted to Harry that he had a crush on him. At first Harry had been flattered, of course, but – although Draco was a really good friend at the time already – Harry could not leave Ginny or even admit to himself that he was not as straight as he thought to be. During that year those things had changed. Harry realised that his relationship with Ginny was not really what he wanted anymore. As he broke it off, she had almost thanked him and started dating girls shortly after.
The whistling brought him back out of his reverie. He still had an awful lot of time and forced himself to at least try to calm himself. With a shaking hand he poured the hot water into a mug and – “Ouch!” – poured a little more over his other hand and wrist. Cursing he went over to the sink and let cold water run over the burned skin. He sighed as the pain eased slowly.
Last week he had seen Harry in the Ministry. Harry had not seen him, he was sure of that, but he had watched the Auror from a distance, trying to ignore the pain in his chest that was only too familiar. He had watched Harry talk to people, Draco did not know and saw him laugh with them light-heartedly. The pain in his chest had grown until it was unbearable for Draco to stay any longer. He wanted to go home and curl himself into a ball under his blankets.
“Rub it in, huh?” Harry interrupted with a growl.
“So now you know.” Harry whispered, not looking at Draco. “You can leave me alone now. Only me and my misery.” Harry buried his face in his hands. But Draco did not leave. He even moved a bit closer to Harry, so that their knees were touching.
“Splendid” Harry chirped in, “I’ve got a surprise for you. Come on.” Harry held out a hand and Teddy took it eagerly. Draco raised his eyebrows in a questioning look but Harry only winked again and held out his other hand for his boyfriend to take, which he did with a dramatic eye roll.
For a long time neither of them moved nor spoke. As Draco pulled back he saw that his mother’s cheeks were wet with silent tears. Gently he wiped them away.
‘Oh, great’, he thought. Burning his hand was not really pleasant but it had at least given him something to do and put his mind off things for a while. As he now sipped his almost cold tea, he felt the butterflies back in his stomach and he knew as soon as he let go of his mug his fingers would begin to tremble again. His eyes skimmed over his kitchen restlessly before stopping on the clock above the door. Harry groaned. It was only six p.m. There was still plenty of time before midnight. Plenty of time before he was meeting Draco.
“Yes. I think I’d like that very much.”
“I want to take them home” the boy announced as he held his leaves carefully out to Draco. With a swift flick of his wand Draco cast a protection charm that made sure the leaves would not crumple as he tucked them into his pocket to the one he already had.
Draco once more felt like an intruder but he could not avert his eyes. Instead he kept staring at Harry.
“Don’t start drooling” he drawled, his breath brushing against Harry’s cheek and making him shiver. Draco chuckled softly and finally pressed his lips gently against Harry’s.
Harry could not stand the pity in his boyfriend’s eyes so he quickly waved him off. “Don’t worry about it now” he murmured and kissed Draco on the cheek. He did not like talking much about his childhood. Draco knew it had not been as pleasant as his own but Harry had not told him how awful it really had been. One day he probably would not wave off the topic but today surely was not that day.
She gave him a loving smile and finally Draco knew that everything was going to be fine.
That was why they had a secret affair for a few months. The time they spent together was wonderful and felt like freedom. Soon it was clear that they loved each other and made each other happy. But not really being able to be together was breaking Harry’s heart. It was tearing him apart, ripping him to pieces. So he ended things. He had to.
Harry sighed. He just could not distract himself anymore. With his – now magically heated – tea he went into his living room. Those days in the 8th year common room seemed so long ago. As if it was decades ago, whole lives even. But it were only three years.
“You’re coming with me, Mr Malfoy, Dumbledore would like a word.”
“Gerroff…” When he finally broke free, Draco brushed his clothes off and walked over to Harry.
“Yes. I have some Moon Frog Juice on the stove if you want to come in for a cup? It should really help with the Nargles.”
“I’ll just get a job.”
“I like you, Hermione. I hope that we can be friends.”
Riddle looked taken aback. “What?” he squawked.
“Now,” James boomed, fighting past his own weepy eyes and giving a watery smile. “For the main event. Remus, you will go first. Repeat after me. I, Remus John Lupin.”
Harry was going to do as Draco said and turn the book in - he really was! He loved Draco more than anyone else, and that meant more to him than a stupid mystery. But he didn’t trust Dumbledore, so after Charms, Harry began to walk in the direction of McGonagall’s office, but an fiery orange blur put a dint in his plans when Ginny Weasley bumped into his side, knocking him to the ground.
Harry drifted calmly to sleep, with Draco’s warm breath on his nose and upper lip, and felt truly content.
Everyone tried to laugh, but they couldn’t.
It was more that there was so much that could go wrong. What if he said he vows wrong? What if James messed up? What if he fell over while walking down the aisle? What if someone leaked the time and location of the party and the hoard of Death Eaters showed up?
“This boy is the son of Lucius and Narcissa Malfoy.” A sharp intake of breath came from Remus, but Sirius just looked grave.
“For richer or poorer.”
“Draco, you said earlier that Gryffindor is the house of the good guys. I want to be a good guy! What if… I don’t know. What if I’m not a good guy?” Draco paused and tried to think of an answer. The Boy Who Lived wanting to be a good guy was, at the very least, comforting.
“Let’s go.”
“Come on, Draco! You’re amazing at research! We would get this done so much faster if you helped us.” Draco was flattered by the compliment but there was a small nagging in his brain that told him that the name ‘Nicolas Flamel’ was familiar.
“Nothing. It’s just some old parchment.” Harry lied.
Draco subconsciously touched his head and scrunched his brow. “Does it?”
However, that night on the Marauders Map, Harry noticed something strange. He was only doing his nightly sweep of the castle for the name ‘Lucius Malfoy’ when another appeared right under his nose. ‘Peter Pettigrew’.
He could feel someone coming up being him and turned sharply to glare them away but found that it was Harry, a concerned look painting his features.
“I don’t see why not!” Harry smiled. “I honestly don’t know enough about it to give you good advice, if you know what I mean.”
“Yeah, I’m fine.” After saying goodbye to the man-horse, ‘Firenze’ Harry said his name was, the party walked slowly back to Hagrid’s hut where the two Slytherin boys said their goodbyes and walked back to the castle. When they got to the Slytherin dormitories, Draco fished under his bed for some left-over Christmas chocolate and gave it to Harry, who had looked spooked since he first saw the unicorn.
Blaise and Pansy were both really nice, although they did seem a little uncomfortable whenever he mentioned Draco, but Harry had come to expect that from his friends. Although, this ‘uncomfortable’ seemed to spring more from the romantic nature of their relationship, that they had displayed very openly after the Quidditch game last week, rather than the rumours surrounding Draco himself, which was refreshing, if disheartening. Harry was aware of homophobia, Vernon was incredibly offensive about the whole thing, but Harry had grown to disagree with everything his uncle stood for, so it wasn’t difficult for him to accept Remus and Sirius with open arms, and to dive head first into his relationship with Draco, whatever it was.
harry was entered in the tournament and draco, sirius and remus aren’t happy about it. draco’s powers have really developed but harry is still having trouble getting his to work. if you’ve forgotten anything that’s happened before, just ask me in the comments and i’ll get to you asap
“And, not to be rude or anything, but why are you thanking me with a bit of old parchment?”
“What do you mean?” Harry asked.
’”Again, the page only showed warming charms. They tried countless combinations, all to no avail. “Maybe I should write to my dads?”
They retreated to the ends of the space and readied themselves. Lockhart tried to explain a complicated blocking charm but dropped his wand, Harry saw Snape whisper something in Draco’s ear and he smirked. Honestly, his friend was becoming a little intimidating.
“Yes and no.” There he went with the riddle-talking again, Harry had to refrain from rolling his eyes. “It shows us nothing more or less than the deepest, more desperate desire of our hearts. You, who have never known your family, see them standing around you.” Dumbledore paused, looking grave.
Harry giggled and came fully into the room to sit next to Remus. “Good, I want to watch.”
“The heir of Slytherin.” she said, face pale. “left another message. Right under the first one.
“I know I am.”
“Draco, do you have the harmonica I got you for Christmas?” Realisation hit Draco like a truck.
“This one will get you through that door.” Harry peered into it.
“Are you ready?” he asked, staring down at them intensely. They nodded in affirmative. “Very well. What you are about to hear isn’t going to change the course of history, as everything is preordained. But you are about to find out your fates. From this day forward, all we can offer you is support. Nothing more. Nothing less.”
Sirius’s eyes were dark and bore into his like lasers. He spoke in the tiniest voice Remus had ever heard him use. “I thought that maybe it was a problem at home.” The ball dropped in Remus’s head.
“I’m not a werewolf. I don’t know what I am.”
“I just don’t understand, how come Harry has such a good boggart? All I’m stuck with is something that has scarred me for life!”
Remus checked that Harry and Draco were asleep before firecalling Dumbledore. He and Sirius had been keeping in touch with the older wizard with weekly meetings. The man stepped into their sitting room, found a seat on the armchair nearest the fireplace and turned to Remus and Sirius, who were on the adjacent sofa, with expectant looks.
The rest of the day held nothing special, but Draco mentioned at one point that Valentine's Day was coming up.
(See the end of the chapter for
Sirius growled. “He just knows whenever we’re coming.”
Sirius and Remus were probably… what would be the best word for it? ‘Livid’ wouldn’t quite cover it. For Dumbledore hadn’t quite kept his promise. The Chamber was a danger to students, and Harry and Draco were very much involved.
Love ya x
“Of course, take as much time as you need.” Dumbledore and Minevra left the kitchen, taking Draco, and settled themselves in the lounge, sharing a look of hope. With the tuition of two of the most powerful wizards in the generation, Draco would be sure to grow up to be a worthy opponent of He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named. Both Professors knew that they hadn’t seen that last of the Dark Lord. And that it was only a matter of time.
“What is it now?” Remus and Sirius were once again preparing breakfast in their kitchen, as they did every day, when Perseus dropped in with a letter from Draco that caused Sirius to choke on his toast.
use transfiguration as a punishment on students! Dumbledore should have told you that!”
“I know”
Today, however, he was in charge of the music. And the cake, and the decorations. He was even asked what he wanted, which was such a strange question to be asked he burst into tears and had to be taken off on a walk by Draco, where he finally recounted some of his stories.
“Why don’t you carry on flipping through that book, I need to go check on Draco and Moony.” Sirius stood up and moved towards the door, but just before he left he added. “When I come back I’ll tell you about our work with Peeves.”
Briefly, Harry wondered what the worst case scenario here was. Surely nothing much could happen from a simple healing charm. How wrong he was. Slowly, the strangest, most unpleasant sensation was spreading up Harry’s arm, or at least what used to feel like Harry’s arm, for it didn’t feel like an arm at all anymore. Draco shrieked.
“Yes. I love him.” He blushed at the memory of Draco’s lips on his own.
I know this was really short, I'm sorry, but I felt like it deserved its own section... :)
“Aw, Dad.” Draco whined.
Sorry I've been so inconsistent with my uploads recently, school had been kicking my butt, but I wanna get back on that grind. I have some really cute ideas for the Christmas chapter so I will keep powering through.
“Care to explain why you weren’t at dinner or in your dormitories?”
“Do you endorse all of this?” The girl chuckled and turned to him with a tired smile.
Short one today, sorry! (Also I feel like Draco is super perceptive, especially in comparison to Harry Oblivious Potter haha)
“But you still look so young, Mr Black.” the old man replied, eyes twinkling.
Draco gave him a suspicious side eye. “Yes. I had fun with all of you.”
Defense with Mad-Eye Moody wasn’t scheduled for the fourth year Slytherins until Wednesday and they were to share it with the Hufflepuffs. Moody had made quite the impression already when he showed up late to the Welcoming Feast.
Hello hello how is everyone
“The adventure ends here, boys! I shall take a bit of this skin up to the school, tell them I was too late to save the girl, and that you two tragically lost your minds at the sight of her -”
“So, Harry, you will be staying with us for the rest of the holiday and, if you want to, you can stay with us over Christmas.” said Remus. “Now, we promise you that, no matter what, you will never go back to the Dursleys, do you understand?” Draco was worried. This sounded like a very serious discussion, he had known the Dursleys were bad, but he hadn’t realised exactly
“Why?”
“And those are Chocolate Frogs. I love these. But be careful, they have a tendency to jump around!” Harry cracked open the packaging and out flew a brown blob that landed on the window and flew out before Harry had a chance to catch it. “Oh, tough luck. Here, you can have one of mine.” Draco passed Harry one of his stack “But if you get Devin Whitehorn can you give it to me ‘cos I need that one.”
“Yes, didn’t you tell me that you knew what was inside it?” Flitwick piped up, having now controlled himself.
There was one of him riding a Junior Broom for the first time and giggling, one of him and Remus in an intense Wizard Chess game when he was too small to understand any of it, with Remus jokingly pretending to be absolutely stumped by the boy, one of a seven to nine year-old Draco drowning in Sirius’s leather jacket and motorbike helmet. But, Harry’s favourite was of Sirius and Remus cradling a very young Draco, probably around four or five. They weren’t looking at him with familiar love, but some new kind of awe that painted your features when you are scared and nervous and blind sighted as hell but also feeling like the luckiest person in the world. Once, Harry asked Draco about it. It was taken on the day he was adopted, by Professor McGonagall. It was his favourite too, he says because of the sheer terror at the idea of parenthood on his father’s faces, but Harry thought it was perhaps more.
He genuinely felt that Beauxbatons would be a good idea for Draco, or maybe Ivermorny, he would like America, but Moony was set against it, although Sirius didn’t know how he’d feel after this meeting.
“Hey, Harry!”
“But, wasn’t Voldemort a descendent from Slytherin? Doesn’t this mean that I have some link to Voldemort.” his voice was barely above a whisper, but Draco’s ears were always tuned in to the sound of Harry.
“Yes.”
” he cast, causing the thing to fall limply to the ground. “Gotcha.” Draco scooped it up and grinned. “Moony! Pads! I got him!” he called.
Harry was having a wonderful week. He and Draco took photos whenever they could, wherever they could, even in places that weren’t very exciting, like the boy’s toilets of the second floor, or by the picture of the jaguars playing Naughts and Crosses up by Gryffindor Tower. Harry loved it. It felt like he had more of a permanent connection to Draco. As though the other boy would be looking at the photos in the future, telling people about his best friend Harry.
“Why don’t you sit down, Dobby?” said Harry, Draco didn’t have time to tell him that the elf wouldn’t take well to that, because he had already started banging his head repeatedly against the leg of Draco’s desk.
“Little Draco, there is so much you don’t know.”
Draco watched him with calculating eyes.
“...And you need us to take care of him. Being that I am technically his cousin.”
“Professor Moody turn him into a ferret?” said Dumbledore to McGonagall. Her lip quirked before replying.
The man bit his lip and furrowed his brows, a sign that he was thinking hard. It took a few moments before he answered. “I’ll think about it.” he said, quiet as a mouse, before turning to Dumbledore and speaking in a harsh voice. “You need to make sure that the parents are comfortable with it, though.”
When they finally landed, Harry dismounted and thanked the creature heartily, only now remembering its name to be Buckbeak.
He had yet to meet the two oldest brothers, Bill and Charlie, but he liked the rest of the children a lot.
“It’ll get better. Even if you are the Heir of Slytherin, that doesn’t have to be a bad thing.”
“Hello! This is my friend Draco.” Draco was shoved forward. Neither he nor Ron offered a hand. Draco was still wary of him, the judgy glances he had received before were nothing to the pure horror that painted Ron’s features now. He was used to this expression coming from people he didn’t know, Pads and Moony had explained it by saying that they were just scared of Pads for once being locked up in Azkaban, or Moony because of his scars. But that didn’t explain it now. Clearly, Draco was scaring the boy.
“Dad, tell Harry your news!” he exclaimed.
The mocks went okay, I'm feeling really confident about the imaginative writing one, but the others made me feel like my brain had been put through a blender lol
“Alright, I’m going to begin my teaching you two how to cast a corporeal Patronus.”
“I will deal with you later!”
“Oh, you’re right!” While Ron was mouthing the word ‘harm-on-ee-car’, trying to figure it out, Draco started playing a calming melody, the one that he always used in the middle of the night, when the moon was too bright and he needed a lullaby. Soon enough, the scrambles of a dog awoken were replaced by it’s snores and the four crept into the room as Draco continued the tune. He was beginning to run out of breath and released for a moment to inhale again, but this pause caused Fluffy to stir in his sleep and move his paw directly onto the trapdoor.
Madame Pomfrey bravely grasped at his arm and shoved him through the secret entrance, slamming the door behind him. Just like that, he was alone in the dark, dank room, with nothing but his own putrid mind poisoning his actions.
Something he was not happy about, however, was the useless study of Divination, the study that Harry had so ridiculously chosen to engage in that year. Which was what got him in the current position of being told his fortune by his friend.
“Pads, can you help Harry get his trunk on the train.” Draco pleaded.
Draco offered a wet chuckle. "What about the war?" he asked.
“Who are you?” Harry growled, teeth bared.
Exam revision had momentarily put a pause on Harry, Ron, Draco and Hermione’s investigation. The latter two immersed themselves in piles of work, testing each other night and day, and the former simple did their best to keep up. Occasionally, though, when they weren’t feeling too up to Potions or Transfiguration, Ron and Harry speculated over Snape’s nefarious intentions. Draco didn’t like it all that much, and reminded them continuously that exams should be their top priority, but they didn’t listen and instead decided that they would go and have tea with the gamekeeper, of all things, to ‘try and find out some more information’. While they were there, Draco took a break from studying and talked with Hermione.
They shared a grin and continued laughing silently. James and Lily may have been gone from their lives, but the memories would live on. It wasn’t enough, but it would get them through.
“What about me?” said Moody.
“Draco’s right, Harry. We’re only in our first year, we can’t fight Snape!” Ron finally caught up and grasped at Hermione’s shoulder for balance as he caught his breath.
.” They chorused.
“If Dumbledore thinks it’s safe for me to still attend Hogwarts, you should trust his decision.” Draco didn’t actually think this was true, but thought it held more weight than ‘my dads, the werewolf and the ex-convict, would think you’re being really mean’. “Now, I’m going for a walk, quit watching me. And Harry too, for that matter.”
Eventually, Sirius sat up and stretched. “Alright kiddos. Let’s get going.”
“What does the letter say? Is Draco alright?”
“TROLL… IN THE DUNGEON! TROLL IN THE DUNGEON!!” He stopped abruptly and paled. “Just thought you should know.” And then promptly fainted. The hall was sent into chaos, but Dumbledore put everyone in order, commanding prefects to take the houses to their dormitories, even the Slytherins.
“This fight suddenly became easier.” Draco whispered. Honestly, with his sight back, Draco felt as though they actually had somewhat of a chance, even if it was still slim. Began running through all of the spells he had learned, none of which seemed powerful enough to take down a beast of this size. Harry, however, seemed to be trying on the hat. “What are you doing?”
“Ser-i-ous is really my godfather?” Remus chuckled at Harry’s slight mispronunciation of his husband's name.
school sucked. please make me feel better 🥺 haha
“They would also like,” said McGonagall, stepping forward. “to tell you, Harry, that they would be very happy for you to stay with them in the holidays, that is, if you would like to?”
“Hello, Harry.” greeted Fred. Harry spun round, pulling his leather satchel tighter over his shoulder and raising his eyebrows quizzically.
“If you don’t like it we can return it, Harry.” Remus assured him. “You are under no obligation to keep it!”
, Harry thought,
“You have literally just described paintball.” Remus deadpanned.
I think I'd want to go to Beauxbatons because its so very elegant and the uniforms are gorgeous, but Hogwarts is too awesome to ignore. Maybe I'd spend the first few years at Hogwarts and then be the glamorous, mysterious, Slytherin exchange student from England, that would be very cool.
“Obviously, it’s still not that safe.” Saving the school (and Wizarding World) from yet another threat had made Harry feel bolder speaking to Dumbledore than he usually would. “Now, my other question: Why did I feel that weird hot flush before I drank the potion to get through the fire? Draco said he felt it too.” The older man seemed perplexed at Harry’s last statement but moved on.
“That snot-slurping troll fart isn’t going to get far without the information we have.”
Remus Lupin and Draco Malfoy stood at the entrance of the highest security prison in the Wizarding World in sickly awe of their surroundings. The dementors haunted every wall, every distant echo of a scream, every shallow breath. Draco couldn’t remember the last time he had touched Harry’s warm skin, or the last time he had sat in the kitchen with his dads, drinking hot chocolate, even though it had only happened the night before. Still, this was something that he needed to do.
Thanks again for everything, you guys, I know I say it a lot but what the hell.
“Not quite, Draco,” Riddle clicked his tongue. “Close, though, very close. You see, little Ginny here opened the Chamber, and wrote all of the messages on the wall, and Petrified all those Mudbloods.” Harry gasped and Tom smiled maniacally at him, it was understandable why. Draco usually found Harry’s wide-eyes innocence adorable, but it was more comical at a time like this. “Don’t worry, Harry, she wasn’t aware that she was doing any of it. After I would possess her to do things, she would have large gaps in her memory. She would wake up with feathers all over her clothes or blood on her hands.” He opened his mouth as if to continue but Draco interrupted him, he always had had a problem with interruption.
Harry looked confused. “Sirius and Remus.” he said, as though it was obvious.
The group bundled into the house where they enjoyed a wonderful Summer lunch, afterwards, Draco showed Harry the broom that he had gotten for his birthday, a Nimbus 2000, and they took it in turns playing with it in the garden until they were called in for dinner. At dinner, Remus and Sirius spoke to both Harry and Draco about the plans from then on.
Harry, Hermione and Ginny smiled politely and nodded as Ron yelled, “What’s in it?”
McGonagall nodded. “Yes, Dumbledore did say something like that. What should we do?”
“Bloody hell.” Draco groaned quietly. There was a thud and both of them turned around to find that Lockhart had dropped to his knees. They rushed forward to help him but backed away as he seemed to be grasping for his wand, threateningly.
“I don’t know.” he whispered. “I got angry. He said things to me and he asked me questions that I didn’t want to answer, so I slammed my fist against the barrier and I think it broke or something, but the Prophet says that he got out under mysterious circumstances.”
“Well, I told Harry about it.” He gestured to Harry. “When Sirius, James and Peter found out about… you know.” He chuckled quietly.
“I suppose we should just wait?”
The Professor nodded sagely. “Good. But, I hope you don’t mind me saying, Harry, maybe you should try a memory with more emotional value? We want to try everything.”
Draco appeared at the door.
“Cool!” Draco was beyond any other sentiment. This was the greatest Christmas present a person could get, especially if you have a taste for restricted information and are living in a boarding school. He didn’t bother pointing out how much time they could spend in the restricted section, he didn’t need to, he felt instinctively that Harry knew. The dark-haired boy grinned and peered down at his body, or at least where his body used to be.
“Through light and dark.”
He didn’t have long to be sad, though, as a big Quidditch game was going to be happening at Hogwarts in his honor, with the whole Weasley clan, even Bill and Charlie, whom Harry had never met, Hermione, McGonagall, and even Hagrid came down from his hut to join in the festivities, and gave Harry a strange book that tried to bite him. Some safety Aurors too, but the more the merrier.
“Who is it? Which student?” asked Hooch, who had collapsed into a chair.
“Oh yes.” Said Fred, with a smirk. “This little beauty’s taught us more than all the teachers in this school.”
“Yeah, come in Minerva.” Remus replied.
“You’ll find your place. I hope we’re in the same house, that means we can room together!” Well that was a lovely thought. Perhaps Harry should just ask to go wherever Draco goes. “Can I ask you something?” Draco was suddenly timid.
Suddenly, Draco could feel the weight of another person sitting on the edge of his bed and looked up to find Harry, watching him and working his lip worriedly. Upon first seeing the boy, Draco was immersed. He had a young, boyish charm about him that was endearing and making him laugh or smile was a feeling that could only be compared to the way he felt when he first flew on a broom or sat in the sidecar of Pads’ motorcycle. But at the present he now he looked stressed and upset.
“Didn’t you say that the whole affair had been bungled, and that you should have been given a free rein from the first?”
“You don’t think about it?”
“Yes. But you don’t have to tell me anything if you don’t want to. But, if you did want to, I’m here.” The dark-haired boy seemingly shrank. “Alright, lets try something else. What about, you come and stay here over Easter, and even the Summer holidays, if you want? Would you like that?” Sirius had clearly said the right thing because Harry perked up and grinned.
“I don’t! And neither does Hagrid. But that's just the mainstream rumour. There's talk about you, too and, I think, seeing you so chummy isn’t really helping.” Ron looked like he was withholding information.
(See the end of the chapter for
The flames fell to reveal a crimson bird the size of a swan, carrying a bundle of what looked like old clothes. It swooped down, dropped the heap at Harry’s feet, and landed on Harry’s shoulder.
“What are we doing?” Harry whisper-shouted at Draco, who was leading the way.
Draco started to scan the Prophet as his dads read the letter, but stopped immediately at the photograph on the front and the accompanying headline. It was picture of Lucius Malfoy, holding a plaque with his name and number on it, above it was written:
“One. Two. Three.”
He turned and watched his friend wade through the sea of children before coming up onto the platform. His face was a fiery as before, if not more so. Harry was unnerved.
“Oh this is Draco…” he trailed off, realising that Draco hadn’t given a surname.
“A FERRET?”
Snape was taken aback for a moment before scowling. “Ten points from Slytherin.” he said. “For impertinence.”
Have a lovely day!
“Mr Malfoy, will you keep your voice down?” said McGonagall.
“Pansy,” The girl looked up, a scared glint in her eyes, Harry softened his voice. “I can’t convince you to turn on your family, but know that you do have that choice. You aren’t your parents.”
Pads and Moony just held them tighter, whispering words of comfort when necessary, but mostly just revelling in the feeling of having their boys back in their arms.
“Yes, but it’s okay.” It wasn’t really, their presence was exceedingly alarming and he was in no position to be coming up with any elaborate lies in this moment at all, but what was he going to do? He was sure that the bite marks and scratches were obvious, and that he was clearly not ‘okay’.
“Please, Professor McGonnagall - they were looking for me.”
“Yes, but I’m not angry about it. I just had to pay a fine for keeping it a secret.” Draco nodded, and then opened his mouth to say something but was interrupted by a soft knock came from the door. “Come in!”
And so they did. They researched ‘Basilisks’ as much as they could, using the special book, but they didn’t get much more information than the page had already told them, that looking directly into the eyes of a Basilisk would kill you, and looking indirectly would presumably Petrify you. They didn’t tell any teachers about the information because, honestly, it wasn’t difficult for two second years to find out, so it must be obvious to teachers.
The sight of Harry's toned body never got old in Draco's opinion. Years of quidditch had left Harry with hard muscles that Draco loved to run his fingers over. That's what Draco did then, letting his finger-tips trace over the lines of his chest and abdomen.
He was quickly surrounded by house elves and he was suddenly saddened by the thought he'd never see Dobby here again. He quickly spotted a house elf he knew though and made his way over to her.
I'm glad everything went well with your coming out. I'm actually thinking about telling my parents as well. I'm not sure how my mother will take it and I know my father will be anything but pleased but I'm sick of hiding it and my parents have been talking about possible marriages lately. I think I will do it sometime after Christmas so I don't have very long before school starts if they get mad.
Draco figured it was a muggle thing as the gesture made no sense, but it flooded him with a sense of happiness at how happy Harry looked.
"Yeah, she's alright."
"It's really pretty in the water too," Harry said with a smile and took off his shoes and robes.
I hope you can.
"Just give it to me," Draco said, rolling his eyes and pulling it off Harry's shoulder and putting it on his own. Next he grabbed his jumper up from the bench and tossed it over Harry's shoulders. "Put it on, I don't want you catching a cold."
The fireworks exploded loudly above and Harry was just thankful nothing was on fire. He looked over to Ron and Hermione to see them kissing and quickly looked away, blushing.
"We could go get the list and put it out right now, as everyone is here," Ron suggested and they headed up to Harry's dorm to get the line up.
"Maybe they weren't very smart," Harry said.
After the lesson Draco made his way over to where Hagrid was feeding thestrals chunks of meat.
---------------------------
“No, not yet,” Draco said sleepily, closing his eyes.
"I can't believe it's already November," Harry said, gazing out over the lake. The sun had set not too long ago and the stars were out, their reflections in the water glowed and Harry wished he could freeze time. "The year has gone so fast."
"What about it?" Draco asked as he followed Harry towards it.
"So what?" Draco sighed, placing his book down in front of Pansy in the library.
The rumors found their way to the library though and Draco found himself on the receiving end of multiple glares as he tried to work on his homework. Harry wasn't blind to the looks either and was growing more agitated and angry by the minute. After almost 45 minutes of silently stewing, Harry decided to get up to get a new book for his essay.
His brain started working again right before it was too late and he leaned back, giving a small cough to clear his throat, "We should probably head back. I imagine the party is almost over by now."
Harry arrived back to the dorm room a few minutes before two to find Draco already there, sitting up in his bed.
Ron leaned over towards her and kissed her on the cheek, as she went to pick up the bottle next. Pansy took a great gulp of firewhiskey as it landed on Padma.
-----------------------------
Harry's hands were just traveling to the hem of Draco's shirt when the dormitory door flew open.
As soon as the door closed, Draco and Harry were in Draco's bed, robes and shirts slipping off the side of the bed and onto the floor, quickly forgotten. Harry's hands were almost immediately tugging at Draco's pants as they continued what they had been doing in the hall.
"What?" Harry asked dumbly.
"Where were you?" Ron whispered and Hermione was leaning in to listen too, "You weren't in your room when I went to find you," Ron's eyes traveled over to where Draco was trying to ignore Pansy who was trying to get his attention, "Either of you."
"How about we just stay here today instead," Draco said, placing his arms behind his head and closing his eyes, "I don't want to walk all the way there anyway."
"Malfoy," he corrected, "It will not look good for you to be so close to me, someone is going to start talking."
"Happy anniversary," Ron greeted Harry when he sat down at the Gryffindor table in the dining hall for breakfast.
"You don't necessarily know if Hermione is straight," Blaise pointed out.
Harry was glowing and Hermione noticed it immediately, nudging Ron and jerking her head towards Harry. Harry came down the stairs with a certain aura around him and even Ron seemed to notice. She had been worried about him since the battle ended; he had moped around the Burrow all summer (according to Ron) and since they got back to Hogwarts she'd rarely seen him smile. She didn't know what was wrong but knew it was more than just the war, and whatever happened to make him seem so happy today she hoped would happen again.
"No, it didn't mean anything, now if we can get back to our work-"
"Of course it wouldn't be something easy," Harry groaned, slumping down on the bench, "can't I just have a normal year."
"I do not care who started what. Do you understand me?"
"Alright, I'm probably going to head to bed now too," Hermione said and Harry checked the clock on the wall. Only twenty minutes after midnight, he was doing good for time.
Draco ached all over with need as Harry continued to press kisses on his stomach and just above the waistband, he was teasing him and Draco knew it. A strangled groan escaped his lips as Harry pressed his lips to Draco's erection over his underwear, and his hips jerked up unconsciously.
Tonight, the sky was clear and Draco could see stars, bright above them. The night was warm and he could hear cicadas in the trees, summer was always nice.
"Only that if Zabini is this bad as a roommate, I can't imagine how his best friend is."
"Thanks, I better go round up my team," they said, turning to go to the Ravenclaw changing room.
"Well I'd hope not, you already have enough people who do that for you, don't you?" Draco realized he'd hit a sore spot just as he said it because Harry's whole body stiffened, and he suddenly felt really bad. "I'm sorry- I didn't mean-"
"Alright, well I trust your judgement. I can't stop you from dating who you want, but I just don't want you hurt," Molly said and everyone else readily agreed.
“He was raised by muggles though wasn’t he? Maybe he’s a closet case,” Pansy pointed out.
Harry laughed a bit, picking up his fork to take a bite of his dinner, "We still on for tonight?"
"Your highlights, the pink."
"He just thinks we're friends."
Harry had to take a moment to regain his composure, Draco had to be the most beautiful person on the planet. "We could take a bath, we have a pretty big one."
"That's kinda the point," he said, laughing.
--------------------------------------
"Of course professor," Neville said as he turned to head out.
As the night progressed though, nothing had happened, and Draco was wondering if he’d guessed wrong. Dinner came and went and then Dessert and then Harry had paid the check. Draco was beyond confused to say the least.
Relief flooded Harry, if she was saying that they were probably right, they most likely were. It felt like a load of stress taken off his shoulders. If they knew what the colors meant, there was less chance of anything going wrong with the potion that they didn't foresee.
"I'm going to look like I just rolled out of bed!" Draco complained.
“Not helping.”
Blaise's face lit up as he suddenly pulled Neville into a hug. "Thank God, I didn't know what I'd do if you said no. I'm so happy." Blaise pulled back and gave Neville a blinding smile.
"I know," Harry said, "I'd like to become a healer. Everyone thinks I should be an auror though."
"There's nothing to help with, Pansy," Draco sighed, gathering his books as well, "I've already told you to let it be."
"I was thinking," she started again, "Since winter break is coming up, we should host a bit of a party before everyone goes home for break."
They'd go somewhere and study, or sit at the top of the astronomy tower and look out over the grounds, way past curfew. It was nice, better than nice. It was one of the only times Harry felt like he could relax and let himself go.
"Wish we were still seventh years, we could've been playing today," Ron said next to Harry, getting wrapped up in the excitement.
“You’re really pretty you know that?” Harry said, nuzzling into Draco’s neck.
Harry
The next morning Draco walked down to Care of Magical Creatures, his first class, with bright sky blue hair.
"So your plan was to decide who to prank and then come to me to make up the idea?" Draco said, smirking down at Harry who was laying on his bed smiling sheepishly.
"Woah," Harry said, surprised. He pointed at a guy and girl kissing at a booth in the corner across the room, "They both started glowing really brightly."
"I'm an idiot for showing him like that though."
"Excited for the Quidditch match Saturday? Gryffindor against Slytherin!" Seamus said loudly, taking up some food from the dishes in front of him.
"You wouldn't die."
-----------------------------------------
"Alright, we should do it just after dinner though, he goes back to his office for a few moments and then makes his rounds. We can strike as he's leaving his office, or just before," a mischievous look took over Draco's face and Harry smiled. He liked seeing this side to Draco.
"Yeah," Harry seemed relieved by the change in subject, "Gryffindor vs. Slytherin is next weekend on the seventh of November and our first match is against Ravenclaw on the 14th."
"Well whatever you do, don't go to Madam Puddifoot's Tea Shop. That place is horrid," Draco said, sitting up so he could look at his friends as they talked.
"Not willingly," Draco cut in.
Harry leaned further into Draco, bringing his hands up to run them through Draco's hair. Draco's hands went to Harry's head, as he cupped his face, deepening the kiss. Harry ran his tongue across Draco's lower lip, asking for entrance and Draco eagerly granted it. The kiss deepened further and Harry's hands dropped from Draco's hair to his hips and Draco moved his own to Harry's hair. Lips traveled over cheeks and down to necks before making their way back to each other's mouths. It was intoxicating and Harry felt drunk.
“That’s a good point, and what straight man holds hands with their platonic friends,” Blaise said.
Ron flopped onto his bed when they made it to his room, "Ugh I'm so tired. Kinda bummed the fireworks didn't blow up or anything," Ron joked with a laugh.
They were halfway back up the path to the castle when Harry heard his name being called.
"It's really fine, I won't tell Harry. And anyway, Malfoy might have a chance now that I'm thinking about it," Neville said thoughtfully as he walked to get the watering can.
"Much more of that and you'll be unable to stand in an hour," Blaise commented, nudging her in the side.
"Really?" Draco asked, suddenly very excited, not caring in the slightest how weird he might be acting at the moment. Only caring about just how nice Hermione was to let him borrow the book.
Draco sent him a smile in return, "I should probably get going for my next class."
Luckily for Draco, a couple rounds passed were Harry didn't kiss anyone and he let himself calm down. Just as he was letting out a shaky breath, the bottle rolled to a stop in front of him. He looked up to find Lavender staring back with a hungry look in her eye and he got the distinct impression he was about to be eaten alive.
"What are you doing?" Draco asked when he walked in to find Harry shuffling around the jars on the bottom shelf.
Draco didn’t know when they started moving, but soon he found himself trapped between Harry and the wall, and he had no complaints. The way Harry pressed against him was perfect and Harry’s hands in his hair were all he ever wanted.
"Hey," Draco said, and it almost sounded like a question.
"Ginny!" he called out, hurrying to catch up to the redhead who had stopped to turn around.
"Don't say our room like that, it sounds soo wrong," Draco said continuing to complain.
Harry smiled at Draco, smiling as he walked backwards toward the bed. "Come on, I have a bit before I need to head back," Harry said and Draco hurried over to him.
"What?!" Draco shot up so fast blood rushed to his head and he had to steady himself against the wall.
Harry noticed the uncomfortable look on Draco's face and tried to distract him, "Where would you like to go next?"
"Thanks, now all we need is the bottle," Pansy said and then took notice of the bottle still in her hand, "Let's all finish this one off, games are always more fun when you're not completely sober." Pansy took a gulp of the liquid and passed it to Seamus who was seated to her left. Seamus gave her an approving look and took a gulp of the burning liquid and passed it to Dean.
"Yeah, I think she's trying to make it perfect for Percy because this'll be the last one for him living here. He's going to America this summer for work after all," Ginny chimed in as they set Hermione's things down.
"Well, uh- I have a girlfriend," Ginny started and Ron cut her off with a whoop of excitement, they all turned to stare at him.
"No talking, constant fighting."
"Harry?" Ron said, shaking Harry out of his daydream.
"You're no fun, you know that?" Draco said, leaning back from Harry and resting on his hands.
"Precisely! That's the whole reason why I messed with that potion!" Pansy tilted her bottle towards Draco, the liquid sloshing dangerously close to the edge of the bottle, "Knew neither of you'd be able to say anything to each other without some kind of aid. Though, you managed to kiss him!" Blaise snickered as Pansy gulped down more of the contents of the bottle. "I'm just bummed it didn't work right. I did research and everything," Pansy complained.
Draco's hands immediately shot up in surrender and he toed off his shoes, "Okay okay, I can get in myself."
"I don't, but I'm worried about your punishment. You two have a habit of getting into fights with each other when you're mad."
Harry felt surprised for a moment before realizing the way he acted must have been pretty horrible and then he felt ashamed. "I'm sorry, I didn't mean to- I was just shocked I guess."
“I should have done that sooner.”
When Draco was sitting up against the headboard, Harry picked up the water and medicine again, "Here, put the pill on the back of your tongue and swallow it with the water."
"Are you?" Draco got out while his mind wandered elsewhere.
To get to his bed, Harry had to cross in front of Draco's and Draco peeked over his book to watch him as he crossed the room. He watched as Harry flopped into his bed and let out a groan.
"I will when he wants to act like a normal person for once," Harry glared at Draco's back.
Draco didn't even have to finish the sentence before Harry was pushing him up against a wall.
It wasn't unnatural though, they spent so much time together, pressed up against each other, that it seemed more unnatural to be apart. It made him nervous how dependent on Draco he'd gotten.
“See! I’m not crazy!”
"You know where the kitchens are? I swear- every time I talk to you I find out another thing you apparently know about the castle," Draco said with a shake of his head.
"No problem, call me if you need anything."
"Do us both a favor and don't finish that sentence," Harry said, disappearing into the bathroom to clean up.
"I didn't mean it like that. You're like a brother to me, it'd just be weird," Draco shuddered at the idea of kissing Blaise, that was something he hoped to never have to do, "and you're..." Draco gestured to Pansy, "Gay as shit, there'd be no point."
The lights turned off then and the room was plunged into darkness a moment later. Draco opened one eye then and peeked over at Harry, his back was to Draco though.
"Uh- oh yes! Thanks, that makes perfect sense." In all honesty Harry hadn't heard a word and was more preoccupied with noting just how light Draco's eyelashes are. He'd ask Hermione about the essay tomorrow.
When Draco finally complied Harry moaned out as Draco hit his prostate again, his toes curling. Draco pressed his hands down on Harry's hips, forcing him into place on the bed, and not allowing him room to move. He moved his mouth to Harry's right nipple and bit down lightly as he thrust forward.
"Hi, um I was having trouble again in herbology lately and was hoping you could help me?" That was another thing that had changed: Blaise had been coming to Neville for help more and more often. At first, it confused Neville as Blaise really hadn't gone out of his way to talk to him before, but soon Neville started to feel a bit of pride in the fact that Blaise was going to him for help. It showed that Blaise thought he was competent enough in the subject that he was willing to ask him for help, and since Neville wasn't much good in any other subject he greatly appreciated it.
A boggart, almost, in forest form; digging deep within your soul to exploit any weakness it may find.
“I’m sure I’ve heard of this before. Dad had letters from his readers - there was a bit of a cult following around it for a while, wasn’t there?”
One of them made a sound into their mouths - Harry was certain it was himself - and then Draco's fingers in his hair tightened and things became a little less soft, a sweep of tongue against his making Harry’s toes curl and he held on tighter, swept away by heat and need and want.
“Are my clothes dry, Harry?” Luna’s voice sounded from the bushes, interrupting his thoughts.
He noticed Harry looking and mustered up a smile, giving him a nod - “Pleasure to meet you, Harry” - before he turned and made his way back in the direction they’d come.
was the furthest thing from his mind, even if he was unsure, confused, entirely out of his depth with whatever the hell this was - not to mention massively pissed off in this moment - and Draco certainly wasn’t helping with his -
He knew Draco was scared.
He lit the end of his wand with a silent 'lumos', and stepped back through the opening in the cave wall.
Harry swallowed, eyes lowering, as he was assaulted by the memory of it, of Sirius’ final words - “
Luna just reached out a hand, a dismissal of anything further he had to say on it, and Harry gathered and handed over her clothes so that she could get dressed.
Draco’s eyes were on him, as if he knew where his thoughts had gone.
Draco glanced at him over his shoulder. “Are you here to gloat?”
Harry looked between them, as the words sunk in.
They carried on like that for what could have been minutes or could have stretched hours, Draco's fingers and lips all over him and making his heartbeat quicken until sweat glistened on their foreheads and on their chests, their panting breaths and soft, breathy sighs filling the air around them, as their hands and tongues and hips moved against one another
they hoped. But that hope was dashed when Luna attempted to wield it and nothing happened.
“Malfoy?” Harry whispered, hand curling around his wrist.
thing it sometimes did when Harry was about, and wanting.
, and he only just had that thought when he heard the rustle of the undergrowth being disturbed and the two of them broke apart, breathing heavily, their hands instinctively going for wands that weren’t there as they spun to face what had come upon them.
Regulus burst into laughter, nodding, but he still had that embarrassingly knowing look in his eyes, before he glanced back at where Draco stood.
Not that Harry was complaining.
Draco held his gaze for a moment, before his eyes narrowed as he lifted his chin. “Is that what this is, then? You think you owe me something?”
Hannah Abbott had joked one night, during a customary game of truth or dare, that Hogwarts Eighth Year was really just a holdover for everyone that didn’t know what to do with themselves after the war.
“Muggle clubs,” Harry clarified. “Gay bars.”
“I don’t think you’re -”
The man didn’t say it.
He was pretty sure Draco knew it, too, with the way he was fighting that smirk of his as he turned the page of the book he was reading, straightening up even more on the couch where he was sitting, ankle coming up to rest on his knee.
After long minutes of just stroking and kissing - ignoring the passers by - Harry drew back, and Draco knew his cheeks were flushed, his breathing uneven. He would have known, even if Harry hadn’t looked so pleased with himself.
“It will never cease to amaze me that the press actually refers to you as
Instead, they just didn’t look at one another for about a minute before Malfoy finally spoke.
"Yeah. Still doesn't mean going up the Tower makes any more sense."
Ron, along with a troop comprising of a mix of students from all four Houses, headed from the Eighth Year Common Room.

He glanced behind where he stood at Luna, who was sitting on the edge at the back, toes bare and dipped into the water as they moved.
And then a flash of light that he could see even with his eyes closed, as everything went still.
and the three of them hurried up the grassy verge to safety.
Harry’s eyes went to the trees - to Draco - where he was now standing closer to Luna and the thestrals.
Her own contribution made, now that her wand had been returned to her.
Regulus smirked, but there was a heaviness in his gaze, even as he kept his eyes on the thestrals.
The door slammed shut behind it at Harry’s flick of his wand.
Harry laughed, then, while Malfoy grinned into his glass.
Harry’s gaze went back to Draco, where he was still standing several feet away with the map in his hands, studying it.
“And how did you manage to do that?”
"Yeah, apparently his dad was angry about it at first, but got used to the idea or something I suppose."
"I was thinking, instead of going back to our dorms we stay in the Room of Requirement tonight. What do you say? We haven't had much time to hang out since school started again."
"Call me Draco."
"Are you sure you're going to be okay to play?" Ron asked about halfway through breakfast, giving Harry another of the concerned looks he'd been giving him throughout the meal.
"You two really need to stop your petty bickering, you know? It's been going on for years," Hermione said, heaving a sigh.
"Well I'm glad you came."
Harry glared at Draco at the use of the nickname, "I never was a rule follower."
Harry smiled, he always enjoyed hanging out with Draco, "Alright, let me go get my books from my room and we can work till dinner."
"Thanks, I'll head off to bed then, see you in the morning," Harry said turning to head over to grab his trunk and make his way to his room.
"Oh that?" Ginny laughed, "It means I like both guys and girls. You had me worried you were pulling me aside for something bad."
Before Harry could respond, Hermione leaned over and whispered something in his ear. A grin spread over Harry's face as he looked over at Pansy, "I dare you to act like Draco for two rounds."
"Well, no," Draco said, shifting uncomfortably in his seat, "I mean, I really thought you hated me now. I was surprised when you invited me here."
From there on the game slowly became a bunch of kissing dares and more nosy truths: Dean and Seamus kissed, Pansy kissed Lavender, and Milicent was dared to sit on Goyle's lap for a few rounds.
"I- I wanted to talk," Harry said, glancing around at the people who were looking at them curiously as they walked by. Ginny seemed to get the message.
"What's up?" Ginny said when he pulled her into a bit of a secluded hallway.
"Ha!" Draco shouted, grabbing onto Harry's arm and shaking him a bit. It sent a shiver down his spine. "Did you see that? First point!"
"What's her issue?" Harry said, turning to Ron after the door was closed.
Draco wondered for a moment how he was alive but was interrupted by Pomfrey hurrying over to his bed. "Finnigan you can leave, just be more careful about what you're putting in your potion next time," she said as she hurried over, "Good you're awake. How do you feel?"
"Ron and I can get food from the kitchen, and you could let everyone know, Hermione. You actually talk to everyone," Harry said.
"Where do you get it?" Ginny laughed.
Harry made his way out of the castle to where Care of Magical Creatures was being held. He had a feeling that he may be a bit late.
"Yeah, but I bet it doesn't feel like you can still feel it up inside you," Harry ground out.
They sat in comfortable silence for a few minutes before Harry broke it.
Harry stared at him a moment as the words sunk in, Harry could tell it was a lie by the way Draco's voice trembled slightly as he said it and by the look in his eyes. The words still stung though and Harry turned, grabbing up a cloak from the top drawer on his dresser - which he'd left open that morning - and started towards the door. "Fine. Whatever you want," he said as he disappeared around the door frame, leaving Draco still on the bed in the dorms feeling like his heart was just ripped from his chest.
"They are always the ones behind this sort of thing aren't they?" Draco laughed.
Parvati went next, "Never have I ever stolen something."
"Yeah? What do you call it when your eyes are closed and you're snoring then?"
Draco rolled on his back then and stared up at the canopy above him then. Why did I run away? I like him, quite a lot, and that was wonderful, Draco thought to himself. He rose his hands up to his head and ran them through his hair. The kissing was amazing if Draco was being honest and, for a moment, he entertained the idea of jumping up from bed and going to the bathroom to snog Harry again. He stayed in bed though. Was he crazy or stupid? If his father ever caught wind of it, he was for sure going to end him.
"-And we'll go clockwise around the circle, taking turns to draw a paper. Any questions?" Pansy finished up telling the rules and everyone nodded in understanding.
"Yeah," Harry all but whispered and followed him out the doors.
"Wow, you're really bad at being clear you invited him as a date huh?" Pansy said.
Their lips met and suddenly Blaise felt he wouldn't ever get enough of it. It was quite intoxicating to kiss Neville and he wondered why he didn't have more people fawning over him. Blaise raised his hand to cup Neville's cheek as they both leaned in further to each other.
"You really are a mess," Draco sighed, casting the charm and Harry let out a sigh as he suddenly warmed up.
"You look nice for just a guys trip to hogsmeade," Blaise laughed and Draco glared.
In a last ditch effort, Draco said the first thing that came to mind to get him to stop talking and to just end the whole thing, "I don't like you! I don't, alright? I don't want to date anymore!"
“Wow, sprint here?” Draco says teasingly when Harry met him at the front, panting and clothes a mess.
He kissed me back just now too.
"Pansy gave me some hangover potion."
Then Pansy burst into a fit of laughter, "he's got you there."
Neville smiled at that, he liked seeing this side of Blaise, it felt more real. He was always so cocky which was fine and all, but Neville felt happy when he got to bear witness to his nervous side as he felt he was seeing something a bit more private.
----------------------------------------
"I don't think that's what it means."
"Wow," Draco breathed. It was really pretty, especially with the moonlight filtering in and bouncing off the walls.
--------------------------------------------
"Won't you be cold?" Draco asked, already feeling warmer with the extra layer.
"Erm- yes?" Harry replied looking slightly confused.
"So you admit it! You do like him! I was right!" Pansy shouted.
"Can we not right it so blatantly across the top? Someone might find this journal," Blaise groaned.
"Alright, alright," Harry laughed, then turned to Ron and Hermione, "And you're really okay with this? I thought you'd be a bit more shocked..."
“Yes! I love the park!” Teddy beamed up at them.
Harry turned around a corner and suddenly realised, how empty the streets were at this time of the day. There were only a few people out, where it was usually crowded by tourists.
Draco forced himself to stand still and stopped pacing. He was a little early and did not expect Harry to be there in another fifteen minutes. That was if Harry wanted to come at all. He ran his hands through his hair and pulled slightly on it to stay in the moment.
“Harry?” he was surprised by the gentleness in his own voice. Slowly Harry raised his head to look at him with big green eyes, showing a vulnerability Draco had never seen in him before. It made him want to protect Harry even more.
“I, uhm, I’m sorry. I probably shouldn’t have… I’m sorry.” Draco shook his head and turned around to leave again.
„Harry! Harry“ he heard Teddy call out even before he had closed the door behind him.
“Yes. Tea would be fine.”
Harry looked up and saw Draco’s lean figure standing in the doorway. He casually leaned against the door frame, wearing a dark grey turtle-neck that perfectly fit against his chest. The colour gave a stark contrast to his pale skin and made his steel grey eyes look piercing. He was stunningly beautiful. Harry felt his mouth go dry and he had to swallow before he could speak again.
“Well, you’re not alone anymore. You have me now. I mean if you’d like that.”
Oh, and dear, I already knew you’re gay.”
“It’s okay, Harry. It’s okay”, he whispered again and again while Harry’s sobs grew louder and more desperate.
Then he finally met his mother. He had invited her to his flat and had cooked dinner for them. Or he had tried to, but had let it burn dramatically, so they had ordered pizza instead. Draco had spilled almost the whole bottle of wine down his front as Narcissa took away his glass and asked him what was wrong. Her eyes were full of concern.
Draco pressed the button and listened to the sound of the bell, muffled by the door. He was worrying his lower lip while footsteps came closer. The door was yanked open. Immediately the angry grimace left Harry’s face to make room for a frown.
“Harry, are you okay?” Draco asked again, his voice so very soft. Harry nodded once, briefly.
“Do you want anything? I was just making tea.”
“It used to be mine” Harry responded with a shrug. “It was the only one I had when I was little.”
“You look adorable” Harry whispered and made Teddy giggle with the words.
The blonde’s eyes widened in shock. “What?” Bewilderment tinted his voice as he lifted his hands to his hair, hovering only an inch above it. “No, it can’t be. My hair is always perfect.”
Draco felt the smile drop from his face. He did not like to be reminded of his weakness. Hated it actually. But he nodded briefly.
“With marshmallows?” Teddy asked eagerly. Now Draco did let out a small chuckle.
Quickly he pocketed the letter before leaving his flat. Right on the front step of the building he disapparated. Draco had asked to meet him on ‘their’ spot close to Tower Bridge. They had met there loads of times when they still had their affair. The street was always full with muggle tourists so they had not had to worry much about being seen.
Another glance at the clock made him tense. It was eleven p.m. Time to leave.
“I just do.” He gave Harry a tiny but hopefully encouraging smile.
“Oh Draco, how could I have forgotten about you?” Harry whispered before pressing his lips softly against Draco’s.
Draco took a step forward, closing the distance between them. He reached out and gently cupped Harry’s cheeks with both hands. “I love you, too” he murmured. “Of course I love you.”
“Hi Draco.” He finally said. Andromeda only looked from one to the other and left them alone with a small smile on her lips. Draco pushed himself away from the wall and walked slowly towards Harry grinning smugly. Harry straightened up, his back against the wall. Draco came closer, only stopping inches from Harry.
He ran next to the pathway in the grass looking for chestnuts or especially bright and colourful leaves. Whenever he found something special he would bring it to Harry and Draco so they could admire it, too.
Harry clung to him as if his life depended on it. As Draco felt his shirt get wet, he started rubbing Harry’s back in slow circles.
Only half an hour later the three of them were walking through the park. The sun was shining but it could not warm up the crisp autumn wind that blew through the colourful trees. It was just cold enough to gently sting Harry’s cheeks. But Teddy didn’t seem to mind. He rather seemed to enjoy the season.
“Or would you rather have some hot chocolate?” Harry continued.
“Don’t bother.” Draco intervened. “Harry insists on doing it the muggle way.”
“Are you sure? You’re trembling.” Draco could not keep the concern out of his voice any longer.
Harry stilled, not sure what was going to happen now. Time seemed to stand still as Draco looked at him totally baffled. Seconds seemed to stretch into hours.
“Yes, right.” Harry set Teddy back down on his feet. “Sorry Andy.” He went over to greet her with a hug while Teddy ran down the hall and into the kitchen.
He went around the playground, just far enough to be out of sight of Draco and Teddy. Cautiously he took his wand out of his pocket and with one more glance around himself, to make sure no one was around, he started his spell work. It took only a few minutes until he was walking back to Draco, grinning satisfied.
“Yes, he’s precious” Draco replied fondly. Carefully he tucked the leaf into the inside pocket of his jacket.
“Do you still want to get ice-cream?” he asked the boy. Out of the corner of his eye he could see how Draco suppressed a laugh.
Draco looked so vulnerable as a tiny flicker of emotion passed over his features. But then, to Harry’s relief, he smiled at him. A soft, vulnerable smile, so different from all the smug grins and arrogant demeanour, Harry was used from him. This was so open and honest.
Harry apparated to a small street close to the meeting spot. He would walk the short distance. That was safer than suddenly appearing in a muggle-packed street. He put his wand back into his pocket and started walking.
Harry only turned off the water as his hand had gone numb from the cold. He opened the cupboard over the sink, where he kept all his medical potions, salves and bandages. Rummaging through all the different vials and tubes he cursed himself for not labelling them properly. After a while he finally found what he was looking for. His hurt hand already started to throb again. Quickly he applied the burn ointment to the raw skin. With a practiced hand he wrapped a bandage around his wrist and hand and pulled it tight with his teeth. He observed his handiwork with satisfaction before returning to his tea.
Taking slow deep breaths he turned to look into the Thames. The water was pitch black but the lights of the street lamps reflected in it, as it flowed steadily through its riverbed. It helped Draco calm down. Slowly, concentrating on every breath, he turned around. He did not really know why he turned away from the water until he saw the man standing a short distance away. Harry was staring at him. His black hair even messier than usual, he was absolutely stunning.
He quickly looked around to make sure there was no audience and then flicked his wand to clean the mess they had left. Those leaves simply were too bright not to be magical. As he was done Teddy reached for his hand and surely he took it.
“Promise, you dork.” Harry chuckled and gently pressed a kiss to Draco’s lips. “I love you” he said before he could think better of it.
“This is unbelievable!” it was not Teddy who reacted first. “Harry, did you really do this?” Draco asked.
Even after all this time it made Harry’s eyes fill with tears thinking about the look in Draco’s eyes when he had broken up with him. Draco had been devastated but did nothing to stop Harry. Harry had received letters from him though. Letters about how sorry Draco was and how much he wished things were different. But Draco had never asked him to come back. Harry had kept every letter, read them all again from time to time. Although he had never answered one of them Draco kept writing. The letters came unregularly and sometimes there were several months between one letter and the next, so that Harry thought Draco had moved on, but then there always came another letter.
“What do you have there, Teddy? Is that a new toy?” Draco asked.
“No, but that’s probably what I would have done when we were kids. I, uhm, I actually wanted to … to know if you’re okay?”
Harry on the other hand did not start dating again. It took him a lot longer to find out that he likes both girls and boys and also that his affection for a specific blond Slytherin might be a bit more than friendship. As he finally had the guts to talk to Draco about it, their last year at Hogwarts was almost over. Still they went out a few times but never publicly. Draco could not risk anyone outside of Hogwarts to know that he was gay. It was bad enough to have the dark mark tattooed on his forearm for the rest of his life and a father in Azkaban, he used to say. If he was going to come out to his mother, he was sure, she was going to have a heart attack.
How could he have forgotten Teddy was here? At least he could tell that Draco had forgotten about him, too. The blush on his cheeks was just too adorable.
“So Teddy, what do you want to do today?” Harry changed the subject instead.
“I’ve always been so alone” Harry repeated quietly.
The next morning he decided to write Harry a letter. He had always written to Harry, never really been able to let go. He had never really expected any kind of answer. But this time he hoped to get the answer he asked for.
“Harry, come play with us” Teddy yelled right before Draco caught him, picked him up and tickled him until his giggles tumbled over one another. Harry took one more moment to memorise the sight. They both looked so happy. Quietly Harry chuckled to himself, then he scooped up an armful of leaves and enthusiastically threw them over Teddy and Draco.
“You’ll see” Harry said with a wink. He patiently waited until Teddy seemed to be finished with sorting the foliage.
“Malfoy? What are you doing here?”
“Thank you, dear. Yes, this is very beautiful.” Draco held up a burgundy acorn leaf.
Hesitantly Draco followed Harry into the living room.
“I’d say he is.” Came a familiar drawl from the open kitchen door.
Harry pulled back first, a little reluctantly. “Come on, we’re here for Teddy” he said in a half-whisper.
“How would you know?” Harry asked, his voice husky and quiet. First tears were running down his cheeks now. Draco wanted to wipe them away but did not dare to.
“Are you done collecting now?” Draco asked gently. Teddy seemed to consider the question for a second and then nodded yes.
“Wow, you’ve grown again, haven’t you?” Harry said and swung the giggling boy upside down.
The moment after this question had felt to Draco as if it was stretching on and on, as if time had stopped. But he had to answer eventually. Slowly he confessed to his mother, had explained that he was still the same person, nothing would change and that he hoped she would understand. Narcissa had let him speak without interrupting. As he was done talking she regarded him with an unreadable expression. Then she stood up, Draco was sure she was going to leave and never talk to him again. But to his surprise she came around the table. As she stood directly in front of him he saw tears glistening in her eyes. He felt horrible for causing her misery and opened his mouth to say so as she pulled him
Now nothing was holding Harry back. He put his arms around his boyfriend’s waist and pulled him flush against his body. They kissed softly, only a sweet brush of lips on lips. He could still feel the curve of Draco’s smile.
“Mmh” Harry cooed against his lips. “I’ve missed you. Don’t ever leave me again.” He wound his arms around his boyfriend’s waist.
“Don’t let him have too much ice-cream” Andromeda warned in a hushed voice.
Draco found the marshmallows and put them on the counter, just out of reach of the kid. As he turned away, there was a glint of bright red catching Harry’s eye.
A few minutes later they reached the small playground they were headed. But it seemed that Teddy was not as interested in the slide or the swings as usual. He rather wanted to play with the piles of leaves that were heaped up on the lawn behind the playground. They watched how he crouched down and carefully picked up the brightest leaves. After examining them he put them back down where he found them. Only some he would put on a special small pile of his own. Those were the ones he found especially pretty and wanted to take home later.
“Hey, Harry?” Draco asked again and now he slightly patted Harry’s shoulder. He could see how the green eyes slowly came back into focus. He looked at Draco uncomprehendingly and then frowned.
“Harry”, he breathed, “you came.” Draco’s voice was husky and he had to swallow before he could continue. “I – I thought you might have forgotten.” Suddenly Draco felt very vulnerable and insecure. He felt a blush spread over his cheeks. Harry smiled at him, this warm slightly crooked smile that made him swoon.
Harry glanced at his watch. It was quarter to midnight. He would be a little early but maybe watching the Thames flow by would sooth him. And maybe Draco was going to be a little early, too.
Harry reddened at the reminder, but raised an eyebrow all the same. “You weren’t exactly soft yourself, Malfoy.”
Malfoy paused, and it was only then that Harry looked at him properly. He was nervous, Harry realised. But it was there and then gone. A flash before a self-assuredness seemed to come over him and Harry guessed he could see something in Harry’s look that put him at ease.
Harry pressed another kiss to his lips, murmuring against them. “Just wanted to say morning.”
Harry’s head fell back against the couch, hips arching into it, overcome by the staggering, breathtaking things that Draco was capable of doing with his tongue.
“Ah” - Regulus held it up - “last one up; the Cave.”
Draco dropped the bitten piece of sandwich back on the plate. “Pardon me, Potter.”
“- we only get it once.”
The motion sent the rudder and the sail swinging, making the raft swerve, precariously.
“Scared, Potter?”
Harry spoke his name on a breath - “
He shivered, finding himself cold all of a sudden, just before he flung the door open wider when he reached it and then froze when - out of nowhere - he found himself loomed over by a
Fingers tightened in his hair, making his breath hitch.
“He was laughing.”
That Draco was standing so close.
“So—” Malfoy broke off, clearing his throat as if that was the reason for his hoarseness. “Right. Well. Thanks for the semi, Potter. Bit overkill, if I do say so myself. I
Harry clenched his jaw, quite certain he was glowering at him, renewed irritation at the fact he’d drawn him into this mess flaring up at this suggestion of
He fought the ridiculous urge to touch.
rumours had surfaced between the two of them which Harry really couldn’t care less about. It was far less bothersome, actually, having them make all these naff speculations about being in a relationship with Malfoy, than it usually was when he was actually trying to make something work with anyone else, and so—
, do allow me to escort you home. I wouldn’t want to lose marks, now.”
“What are you doing?”
“Hey,” he said, when he reached him.
“You’re Sirius Black’s brother.”
They hadn’t talked about it.
Sirius - the boggart - carried on, cruel words that Harry could only just make out while Regulus remained frozen to the spot, seeming to have forgotten he either had a wand or how to combat a boggart, until Luna intervened, casting the first
“Weasley,” Draco said, reaching for some pastries, before he added, “Potter.”
His voice was quiet when he finally did. "The Manor's worse."
“Well then. As a
Eventually, they stepped into a wide open clearing within the cave, with a drop hundreds of feet down, and a less-than-sturdy looking rope bridge that connected where they’d come to a stop to an opening on the wall opposite.
“We can’t very well swim it, weighed down by all these robes, can we?” Draco said, before his eyes drifted downwards over Harry’s body as if it were something he would happily devour - and Harry would happily allow that to happen - before he added, “Better strip, Potter.”
Only once they’d reached the treeline did they slow, Harry turning back to look back at where they’d come, seeing the selma had risen high above the water, now, and was watching them run.
“They’d be wrong.”
She shoved the Prophet onto the table in front of them, and Draco could see the headline as well at the same time that Harry did.
Even if the heat was stifling.
Harry reddened against his will, which was just embarrassing

That got his attention, Draco's eyes finally lifting and meeting Harry’s. And Harry found when they did, that
Malfoy seemed to be pulling back, so Harry pushed off the wall, catching Malfoy’s face in his hands and kissing him properly. It heated up rather quickly after that. All he could feel was Malfoy. His warm mouth against Harry’s and his hard muscles beneath Harry’s hands as they roamed—without Harry’s permission, really—and he felt Malfoy’s hands in his hair, pulling him closer, tighter, making his toes curl in his shoes.
“Well, yeah. Obviously.”
“Right,” Regulus said, suddenly appearing beside them. “That’s them gone for the time being, so best get over there while we can.”
“Obviously I just can’t bear to be so far away from you.”
“Looks like one of these is the exit,” Regulus remarked, as he approached them.
“You should’ve just asked me to meet you there.”
Harry felt Draco’s hand on his arm and lifted his chin with a frown, confused at how he’d somehow come upon him again without realising, but at the glimpse of silver when their eyes met the world around him spun once more.
That was true.
“Years of being stalked by you under that cloak have sharpened them up a bit.”
“You and your friends -” Regulus began, after a long moment, during which Harry found himself just watching them. “You can see the thestrals.”
Harry felt warm heat spill between them and the grip around their pricks slacken, and it was beautiful and
quiet laughter from Regulus, and the occasional jibe back and forth between Harry and Draco.
Draco’s eyebrows lifted. “Oh. I never would have guessed. What with all that racket you were making.”
blokes - and that bloke being
“The water’s lovely, Draco,” Luna said.
Harry opened his eyes, finding the three of them in the Transfiguration Classroom once more.
“It was very obvious, Harry,” Luna said, nodding. “Especially this week, even if you have been trying to avoid one another -” her eyes perked up at something in the distance. “Oh. Excuse me for a minute, Harry.”
Like right now.
“Well, we’re obviously not ‘swimming it’,” Harry said, when he managed to regain his composure, and he shrugged out of his own robes - as did Luna - so that they were all now dressed in shirts and either trousers or skirts, respectively. “So, how’d the map suggest we actually get over there?”
Harry did though.
Draco took a moment to compose himself, ensuring no one was around when he whipped the cloak from over his head and tucked it away, following Harry’s path into the Great Hall.
He rubbed, instead.
Harry rolled his eyes. “They’re not mine, Malfoy.”
- and Luna appeared, not looking at all surprised even though it was clear she could tell what they’d been up to.
“No, I didn’t,” Draco agreed, looking at him, coldly. “It was sex, Potter. That’s all. Nothing to get your knickers in a twist about. If you’re worried I’m going to be shouting it from the rooftops of Hogwarts, rest assured, I have no intention of doing so. Merlin forbid.”
Harry had kissed him, then, words fading away.
“Then why didn’t you just say that?”
Harry shoved his hand away, laughing, while Malfoy snickered and took a bite. “Too much?”
So, he left Malfoy to it, heading out onto the grounds for some air and a break. Even if he could still see reporters lingering on the boundaries, peering through the bars of the fence. He ignored them, leaning against the low wall of the patio.
Harry shrugged, just as Regulus and Luna joined them. “I’ll go first. That way if I’m wrong -”
“You could have said no. If you didn’t want to.”
in his mind.
“I’d be
Draco’s eyes met his then and there was both amusement and heat in his gaze at another of Harry’s foot-in-mouth statements.
He risked a glance at Draco, who appeared oblivious to Harry's presence, as away with the effects of the woodland magic as he had just been, grey eyes with an unfocused gaze on some point over Harry’s shoulder.
Before he’d taken more than a couple of steps, the parchment in the middle of the desk glowed brighter than it had the previous two times, increasing in intensity to the point he had to reach up with a splayed hand and squint to keep his eyes open.
“...I am very surprised to see
, making everything within the classroom shake as Harry’s hands flew to cover his ears at the racket.
There was a flicker of a smile on Regulus’ lips at that. “I’m glad to hear it.”
only talking about that, Harry supposed this did beat sitting around on their arses in detention for two hours. He’d surely faced worse and he’d found, as the months dragged on, that he actually missed doing more with magic than just what he’d been told to do in textbooks.
“Of course he was,” he said, so softly Harry almost missed it, before Regulus turned to him. “You were there?”
Harry didn’t hesitate, a smile on his face as he made a beeline for the Floo.
get out of leading the press to believe that you and I are hopelessly devoted to one another?”
“Expecto Patronum!”
And then he heard it.
Draco had said the first night they’d come across one another in the Astronomy Tower some months before, the words spoken in a familiar drawl, but Harry had caught it. The brief flash of vulnerability beneath the mask of indifference that kept drawing him back.
Harry glanced away, heating. How Draco could look good just
Even though they’d already looked and knew their next quest was ‘
“Wouldn’t expect anything else.”
Harry raised an eyebrow. “They’re harmless.”
He felt it as if he were there, the haze of the haunting magic around him warping and becoming something else. Something hot and bright like fire, a blazing vibrancy, every nerve springing to life, awakening under the feel of Draco’s lips against his.
“I think you’re very lovely together, you know,” Luna said, suddenly, reminding Harry that they were sitting side-by-side.
Malfoy pulled out the stool, taking a seat. Uninvited. “Guilty as charged.”
A one was rolled - this time for magic - and he stepped towards the desk to see what the game would muster up now they’d all taken a turn.
Harry immediately turned, glancing in the direction of it, past all the creatures that continued to graze and run and lounge in the meadow that they were standing in, at the large body of water in the distance.
Luna wasn’t wrong.
The Appleby Arrows, however, were high spirited, and aside from the odd teasing comment made at Malfoy’s expense, took Harry’s presence as Malfoy’s date in good-humoured stride, so that by the time the Awards Ceremony and formal dinner was over, there was only laughter and merriment amongst those at the table, the popping champers flowing freely.
Harry’s mind was quickly brought back to the situation at hand, by a commotion further up the tunnel, Harry glancing up just in time to see the tell-tale sign of a boggart that swirled in front of Regulus, before taking shape.
Draco met his look, eyes dancing with amusement, but said nothing and Harry, emboldened by his gaze that was very nearly fond, nudged Draco’s hand once with the back of his, before slipping them alongside one another, threading their fingers together.
It would be a lie if he said he didn’t - sometimes,
happening.
A smile played on Draco’s lips as he reached the corridor and began making his way in the direction of the doors to the hall, but - before he could reach it - he was suddenly seized by the collar and hauled into the nearest alcove.
There was a low laugh from Regulus at that, without any true humour.
A small zap of white, sparkling lights from the end of Draco’s wand when he was a few metres away gave him a good enough idea of what he was up to.
Harry lifted his shoulders, suppressing a smile. “Guess you ought to up the game a bit, then.”
If Draco was talking about what had happened between
Harry hesitated at the Veil, unwelcome understanding coming over him. “You’re not coming with us?”
So Harry leaned forward, pressing their lips together, kissing him because...there was no reason not to. Well. That wasn’t entirely true. Harry kissed him because he

There was brightness -

A smile played on Draco’s lips at that. “You literally saved the world.”
before a sketched pathway began forming in swirls between them, the map glowing brighter for a second before all upon it faded away, leaving the parchment blank once more.
Harry shot him a look, bristling, and took the die, rolling it a little harder than necessary and sending it tumbling off the desk.
And hot on the heels of all that, he’d realised that he

“Hm. Well. I’ll bear that in mind, Draco.”

tend to be plagued by more...trying circumstances.”
“Why on Earth would I want to leave this beautiful place and go back to a world torn apart by war, hm? Particularly considering my family have, apparently, been entirely wiped out in the aftermath.”
“To bed?” Harry gaped at him.
Veils like the one that had taken Sirius.
Harry gasped.
Harry grinned. “Not really.”
The iciness of the water shocked him into a gasp, stealing the breath from his lungs, before he broke the surface with a series of splutters.
Harry felt Draco’s fingers brush his wrist, before he, too, joined them, and Harry reluctantly followed, his heart thudding as visions of Sirius slipping beyond the Veil came back to him, as if on repeat, as he listened to the whispers of each of the Veils.
Harry laughed, nodding. “Yeah, I’m done, too.”
He had to laugh. Or cry. Or hide in Grimmauld Place and never come out.
And they’d gotten caught.
As if it were no big deal. So, all week while Harry had been...well...
“I think a cold shower is in order after that.”
Harry’s hand tightened around his wrist, concern chasing away any lingering embarrassment, his voice a murmur. “Draco?”
Harry’s frown deepened at the statement, his stomach dropping.
“Oi! Get back here,” Harry said, quickly pursuing it and whipping out his wand.
Harry peered into the trees ahead, into the darkness and the mist that swirled along the forest floor.
Perhaps that was why he and Draco had found themselves here, now.
To his mortification, he realised they were close to the other shoreside, now, so he’d obviously been looking at Draco for ages like a right goon.
” Harry said.
They’d stayed at the bar, sitting more closely than Harry really remembered—the drinks must have loosened them up—and other photographs had managed to catch enough moments of the two of them smiling, laughing and leaning in close enough to one another in the couple of hours that followed that even Harry himself, would have been convinced there was something going on if he hadn’t known better.
His hands curled tightly in the front of Draco's shirt most likely had something to do with that.
?” He gave them a wry smile, crossing his arms.“Tempting, Harry. Tempting. But I think I’ll just head down the shore and watch the sunset.”
"Perhaps when you two find yours," she said, tucking her wand behind her ear.
That was odd, though.
“That was an unexpected interruption,” Luna remarked - to Draco's glare - before she cleared her throat and rolled the die that was still clutched in her hand.
“I would’ve worn mine, if you’d said—” Harry broke off. Was that weird? Coordinating outfits?
“Apparently I’ve disappointed her,” he said, noncommittally - it certainly wasn’t a lie, even if it was a bit of misdirection - before he added: “I'll catch up with you lot later.”
“Keep up, Potter.”
“- that
Harry stared, the words hanging heavily between them.
Eighth Years didn’t get issued detention.
“On that, I imagine,” Draco jerked his head at what looked like a bunch of tied together logs, with a mess of fabric lying on top of them.
The Azkaban robes became a clown outfit, briefly, just as Harry stepped in front of it.
Draco looked at where their hands were joined, amusement replaced by an uncertainty that was never there when he was alluding to fancying or fucking.
He shuddered as parted lips trailed over his jaw before moving down his neck, tongue teasing and teeth nipping at every undiscovered sweet, sensitive nerve until he gasped and reached, blood thrumming and hands curling into fabric and tugging, desperately.
After almost a full week of being given the not-quite-cold shoulder, Draco was willing to try anything.
“You weren’t exactly quiet yourself, Malfoy.”
Harry rolled his eyes. “I never thought you were the ‘human embodiment of wickedness’. And I definitely don’t know what you’re on about with the other thing, either. I never…I don’t
“Very convincing,” Harry remarked quietly as he mock-marvelled at Malfoy’s performance. Malfoy leaned down behind where Harry was sitting, speaking close to his ear in that way that almost made Harry shiver and catch his breath.
The man tilted his head to the side, eyes still on him while his smile formed slowly. “Malfoy.”
“You know what, I think you’ve been doing alright actually.”
Malfoy grinned, yanking him close—“Haven’t you heard? The public are already convinced”—and the two of them side-alonged to the Ball.
“I just don’t believe that the way we acted when we were seventeen should dictate how people see us for the rest of our lives,” Harry finally said.
to hide that in the way that robes easily did.
Draco just glowered at him, while Regulus’ lips quirked and he said over his shoulder -
In short, Harry Potter and Draco Malfoy became the first - and only - Eighth Years to be assigned detention because their previously innocent rendezvous in the Astronomy Tower in the middle of the night - rendezvous that had fast been becoming frequent - had turned not-so-innocent five nights previously.
“I didn’t…” Harry hesitated. “I wasn’t locked up in the dorms.”
Yellow eyes locked on his for a moment.
Another camera flash went off.
He noticed Luna a little further ahead, eyes closed as his own had been, as she swayed, slightly, seeming lost in a daze.
They ran, hearing the snarls of others behind, Harry trying - knowing - he had to keep Draco and Luna in sight.
Aside from the precarious sway of the bridge as the four of them made their way across, it was relatively uneventful. The fear of the bridge tipping and sending them toppling to the too-far-down-to-see cave floor was all that plagued them.
"Charming.”
Malfoy side-alonged them to the doorstep of Grimmauld Place. He could have apparated them inside. He knew that Harry had added him to the wards so that he’d been able to get in earlier that night.
Everything felt hollow, at best, or just painful, at worst.
Luna smiled, giving the creature a stroke, while Draco eyed it with none of the affection she was displaying. “Nasty little buggers, those things are.”
the way Harry Potter did.
“My mother doesn’t smile anymore.”
An uneasy silence fell over the room, all three within seemingly rendered speechless by what had just happened.
To just to touch and taste and explore one another with their mouths, breathing Draco in with each stolen breath between kisses, but his fingers had a mind of their own, hands slipping down from Draco’s cheeks to his neck and then lower, feeling skin - reminding him that Draco’s shirt was still parted - and Harry was gripped with a longing, then, that stirred need in every nerve from his fingertips to his toes.
Harry drew in a breath, getting to his feet, and followed.
“So it is,” Draco humoured him, eyes back on the lake. “People pay good money to sail around aimlessly in places like this. Who said romance is dead.”
“I can’t see him giving it up without a fight,” Harry chuckled, before he eyed the couch they were sitting on. “That mean I’m sleeping here?”
“God,” Harry gasped, lifting his hips, already close. “
Everything had changed in just a few minutes - though it had certainly felt much longer to them - spent in a boardgame that Draco may or may not have willingly tricked Harry into getting caught up in with him.
Mostly unsheltered, it consisted of little more than a covered sleeping area, a misaligned table with two stumps for stools that he and Regulus were now sitting upon, and some fur blankets tossed over a carefully crafted wooden bench that Regulus had seemed infinitely proud of when Luna had complimented it.
, his mind supplied, unhelpfully.
Harry only stopped kissing Malfoy because the other option was to stop breathing. Even then, he was breathless, panting as they parted.
Harry watched him go, long enough that he was startled upon turning back to the forest and seeing that Draco and Luna were now deep within it and he hurried to catch up.
Luna lifted the lid, turning it over in her hands and reading the inside inscription, before her eyes widened with obvious interest.
And then Malfoy chuckled, running a hand through his hair, and the moment passed.
feel privileged.”
His stag appeared, bursting forth, and then the dementor that held him let him go, chased off into the darkness with the others nearby, dispersed by the silvery light as Harry fell backwards, missing the bridge, and he heard Draco calling his name again as he was falling, falling, falling…
Before anyone could ask what, there was a flash of brightness - the same as the one that had happened before - the suddenness of it startling in the darkness of the night that had fallen, making them flinch at the growing intensity, before it zapped away in a concentrated suck into the ground ahead, this time leaving a cabin, lit up on the inside and smoke coming from the chimney.
you.”
Camera flashes greeted them immediately, as soon as he and Malfoy apparated into the main receiving area of the event.
“Ah,” Regulus said, with a nod. “There we are.”
“He was a hero,” Harry said, quietly.
Until they got just past the middle, when each step felt heavier, an unnatural chilliness setting up the air around them until Harry could see his breaths before him just before the mist descended.
Because,
Draco had moved without Harry realising, now standing several feet away, but turned to look at him, his eyes slightly glazed. “What?”
Draco knelt down, putting on an air of nonchalance as he eyed where Harry was pressing. “Think you’re right though. It has stopped.”
It was a circular cavity in the cave that they’d come to and along the walls were veils. Half a dozen of them.
Harry whipped his head round to look at him.
“Malfoy,” Weasley said at Harry’s side, still a bit stiffly but no longer as hostile as he used to be.
old habits and all that.
“Move over. You obviously have no idea what you’re doing.”
“Draco -”
Two lives, he thought, past the haze of it, just as he felt his wand come back to his outstretched hand.
“Huh-” Harry got to his feet and scooped it up - although
His fingers curled and it was only then that Harry realised he was holding something – the map from the classroom – and he looked down at it in bewilderment.
“For our audience?”
It was the fourth one that he came to, that he knew was the one.
Draco’s eyebrow lifted briefly in obvious surprise and Harry found himself fighting a matching grin just as the raft suddenly shuddered, making him lose his footing, before it overturned in a

and Harry looked down at him, panting, barely able to see him past the haze of lust that had gripped him.
“Oh, not you—” Malfoy nodded at the door “—your posse of highly trained security personnel, of course.”
So, Harry nudged him - ignoring the fact that he, too, was bricking it a little and had no real wish to face down any dragons in this place, two available lives or not - and said, quietly. “Two lives, mind.”
despite the fact they’d just been thrown into a filthy lake.
He’d mourned, in other words, as was apparently
Harry felt a hand on his back, unseen in the darkness, and then wisps of breath just before the soft press of a kiss to the side of his neck.
Malfoy played the role of ‘date’ exceptionally well. Despite being amongst company, there were frequent touches, warm smiles, laughter and eyes only for Harry, so that—should this be a
Malfoy stilled but he didn’t move away, their lips a hair breadth away from one another’s. Harry didn’t know why he’d said anything. He didn’t know why he’d stopped him. Suddenly, with his silvery grey eyes looking right at him — somehow warm and bright and teasing, all at once—and his lips so close that Harry could feel each of his breaths against his own, stopping him seemed like one of the silliest things he’d ever done.
That was all.
“Thought you crawled back into your hole.”
Draco frowned, staring at him. “You’re…”
A niffler snatched up a loose coin and tucked it into its pouch, making so much
If that meant chucking them into a possibly perilous gaming adventure - which had actually turned out to be far more serene than frightening - then so be it.
“Good," Harry grinned. "You should.”
There was a scoff from Draco at Harry’s side and Harry noticed a smile playing on his lips as he eyed Regulus where he stood.
“Is that the bar you set for goodness, Potter?” Draco chuckled, without humour, shaking his head as he said, mostly to himself. “Cannot kill people.”
“I’m really sorry to hear that, Draco.”
Regulus held something up, tapping what Harry realised was a wand on the palm of one hand.
“Luna -” Harry shoved the map at Draco, hurrying up and dropping to his knees in a skid at her side. “Luna!”
Malfoy’s eyes were darker than Harry had ever seen them, pupils blown, even as he didn’t quite meet Harry’s gaze. He had that shy look about him that Harry realised he liked very much, so much that he very nearly pulled him back in.
Harry glanced away, eyes going back to Ron. “Um...no. I’ve, er...got a thing. With McGonagall.”
all along; a sparking of warmth and heat and want when their lips met, just as it had every other time, a flutter of delight in his tummy that Harry hoped would never fade.
“There’ll be worse than that, I’m sure,” Regulus said, lightly, before he carried on as if nothing had happened.
But Draco was ignoring him, now, hauling up his still-damp trousers from the ground and pulling them on, his shirt following suit.
Even now, months later, there were still looks and whispers.
It took only a second more for him to come back to himself.
He shot Draco a look, even if he did roll it up and press it to the wound. Even if a smile
He reached up, letting go only because a grasp of Draco’s shoulders would be able to pull him closer - and he
“In my own local, too. What are the chances?”
“Maybe not quite like that. You did invite Luna.”
Harry’s eyes followed Malfoy long enough for Ron to take notice and scoff at his side. “Git.”
"I just mean I get it. Why you did what you did."
“It’s...you can just feel it,” Harry said, quietly. “Can’t you?”
And then Harry’s stomach dropped at the sight before them.
Harry chuckled, shaking his head. “Like I said, forget it.”
Draco set off, heading in the direction of the lake, with a look on his face determined that he was somehow able to navigate this strange place they’d ended up in.
“What quests did you roll?” Draco asked.
And then, suddenly, Luna reappeared some feet away - upright, smiling,
He stood, breathing uneven and his hips twitching while the heat dwindled, slightly, chased away by a cool breeze that made him shiver.
It was then that it really hit Harry, that this person had absolutely no idea who Harry was.
and then: “Expecto Patronum!”
faces of those who were lost.
“Doubt this is what McGonagall had in mind when she sent us up here, Malfoy.”
It made walking into the Forest seem easy. But, still, Harry couldn't bear to look at the Forest.
“Yeah?” Harry’s voice came out embarrassingly hoarse, so that Malfoy would surely know that Harry wanted him.
And then it sank back down into the lake, swimming away in lazy rising arches within the water.
Harry glanced over his shoulder, at the closed door of the bathroom that told him Regulus was still basking in the glory of hot running water, and got to his feet heading in Draco’s direction.
He doubted he was imagining that Draco was talking about more than just this game he’d bloody well tricked him into getting sucked into with him.
And then he turned, his eyes meeting Draco’s again in an unimpressed glower.
“I imagine my ‘hole’ would cease to be quite the safe haven I’ve come to enjoy if Lucius Malfoy were to show up, ready to tar and feather me for letting his son loose in the game without a trusty guide.”
“I wouldn’t think you were a coward for wanting to.”
Harry drew in a breath, “So…what now?”
“Oh come on,” Harry said, fighting snickers. “Are you really saying you haven’t had a one night stand? Draco Malfoy, who has to literally pick knickers off his shoulder whenever he goes out in public?”
Harry wasn’t sure if that was messed up or not.
Two lives. And Luna had lost one.
Harry eyed the lake that stretched almost a mile wide, wondering how the hell they were supposed to get across, but before he could say anything, any and all rational thoughts were driven from his mind when Draco started shrugging out of his robes.
They stood like that for a moment in the middle of the corridor until Draco seemed to get an idea and jumped back a bit, "How do you even have an invisibility cloak?!" Draco said as he took in the cloak that currently draped part way around Harry's shoulders.
Draco's head tilted then and pressed his lips harder to Harry's and suddenly their kisses became hungry. Draco moved closer to Harry so that their bodies ground against each other and Harry let out a low groan.
"You're worried about telling him too though. If you don't think he'd care why are you worried?"
"Who is going to read it? It stays in my room and Hermione isn't one to go around snooping in my stuff. She respects my privacy, unlike you too."
"Just because it's not a date doesn't mean I can't look nice."
Ron and Hermione were going to take each other, no doubt. That's when Harry realized something: he had no one to take.
"Get in with me."
The others slowly dispersed after a pointed look from Hermione, and started towards the castle, all for Draco and Pansy who followed Harry and Hermione up to Blaise and Ron.
By the time Pansy was calling them all to gather up for games, Draco was dizzy.
"You think? We can always do something else if you'd like."
"Any developments with that?"
Draco gave him a funny look then as they made it around the corner to where the eighth-year dorms were.
Draco blushed to the roots of his hair and Pansy snickered.
Harry, Ron, and Hermione were all crowded around a table in the common room studying after dinner. Well, Hermione was studying. Harry and Ron had worked for about 45 minutes and then gave up in favor of playing wizards chess and complaining to Hermione about how boring studying was even though - as Hermione pointed out - they weren’t even doing so. After losing the game for the fifth time in a row, though, they had stopped again. Finals were in three weeks though and that was about the only reason Harry and Ron even agreed to stay with her and “study” at all.
“You should still go,” Harry muttered, looking away. Why can’t I just ask him to go with me, Harry internally groaned, I know he likes me. I’ve just got to ask him!
"Well I was thinking about the potions that were mixed together: Amortentia and Veritaserum. On its own, amortentia is a love potion and veritaserum is a truth serum, so what if the colors have to do with love?"
When Draco returned a few minutes later he was carrying Harry's scarf. "You uh, forgot this in the astronomy tower. I figured you'd want it back."
“I got a letter.” Remus’s voice was scratchy and hollow, devoid of emotion.
James sighed and moved to stand near Sirius, still keeping the cloak hanging loosely around his waist for a quick getaway if they needed it. “Well…” he stammered, looking guilty. “We were really worried about you. You disappear once a month and when you come back you seem really tired and sometimes you seem hurt so we did some investigating.” Remus was tense.
He didn’t quite know where to begin. He had so many questions, some he would prefer to remain unanswered, like what exactly made him so threatening to Voldemort, but there were some others, like what his mother was like before Azkaban, what they had hoped for him in the future, although he could probably guess that one.
Sirius nodded, actually believing it. “Yeah. I’m alright.”
“How do you know about this plan, Dobby?” His voice was a lot softer than his husband’s.
“Somewhere there.” she pointed vaguely towards one of the sinks and both of the boys rushed over it and scanned it for anything unusual. At last, Harry saw it: a tiny snake engraved on the side of one of the copper taps.
Luna beamed. “Wonderful. And would your friends like some too?”
“Yes, dad.”
“I’m sorry for asking, it’s just that, Sirius over there, he’s your godfather, and we haven’t heard anything about you in years. Only that you were alive.”
“Four years later, you, Sirius, had been released from Azkaban and young Mr Malfoy found himself in a similar position to the one Harry had found himself in. Without parents. Now, as you know, the House of Black has always been quite a toxic environment for a child to grow up in, and the Malfoys are no different. And with Draco’s, shall we say, unusual, powers, I felt it best that he grew up in a home that wouldn’t exploit them, hence my putting him in your care. Now, I had thought that, perhaps, I should release Harry from the Dursley’s care and bring him here to live with you, his other legal guardian, but, when I reached Privet Drive, I noticed him sitting, alone in the back garden, showing off some skills that, perhaps would be at odds with Draco’s.” A chill ran down Remus’s spine.
“A bit of old parchment!” Said Fred, closing his eyes with a grimace as though Harry had mortally offended him. “Explain, George.”
“No. I don’t think the Potter line descends from Salazar Slytherin. Or the Evans line, for that matter.”
“Did I? I don’t recall…” He was properly spluttering.
Sirius visibly deflated at the memory. Harry’s heart went out to him - he couldn’t imagine the kind of pain he went through.
The twins cheered and clapped him on the back. “That’s amazing!”
(See the end of the chapter for
“That was the most terrifying experience of my life.”
“I don’t know I’m just hoping it will help us-
“Okay, I’m going to stop you right there, Harry.” Draco interrupted. “We are not, I repeat, not, going to investigate the Chamber of Secrets.”
“Okay. On three.”
It was then that Harry’s eyes caught onto the monstrosity that was Lockhart’s robes.
“Fine.” smiled Remus warmly, finally feeling a little more awake. “What’s the idea?”
“I do, dad.” Draco replied decidedly. “I know it seems strange, but I know that I do.”
“HARRY!” Draco was in the front garden of his house, waiting for Pads to arrive with Harry. It had been too long, three weeks was the longest the pair had been separated since they met, and letters didn’t quite cover it. The second Draco saw Harry’s face, he charged forward and wrapped him in a hug, nearly knocking the boy off his feet.
“-Norway-”
He didn’t tell Harry. He didn’t tell anyone. It was his thing. His time to just be. Alone. With this small voice in the back of his head telling him that the cold was a comfort, not an enemy. That if all else failed, it would always be there. And Draco wouldn’t let that be tainted by Remus and Sirius lecturing him about being safe, or Harry suggesting that they do some kind of research on it. He didn’t want to do research. He didn’t care.
“Uncle Vernon says that gays shouldn’t have children.” A line had formed between the boy’s eyebrows as they furrowed, clearly uncomfortable with his Uncle’s bigotry. Remus wasn’t annoyed in the slightest. Being the teenaged secret of Sirius Black made him well accustomed to homophobic adults indoctrinating children.
“Not if we get Professor Snape to brew you some Wolfsbane, I’m sure he’d be happy to oblige!”
“I know it's Christmas, and I don’t want to get too morbid, but I just want you to know how much you mean to me.” There was something about Sirius’s expression that unnerved Draco, but he didn’t press it, knowing that he would be told eventually. The older man shivered, even though Draco had never felt toastier in his life, and suggested that they go in and check on Remus and Harry. When they entered the kitchen, it was alive with the Christmas spirit. From the comforting warmth of the room to the mouth-watering smell of the food, everything was screaming love and happiness. Harry was in the corner, chopping carrots. “Oh, come on, Moons! What have you got the kid cooking for?” Harry blushed a soft pink and kept his head firmly down.
“Ooh! Draco’s got a Howler!” Cooed Pansy in a sing-song voice. “Go on, Draco, you know what’ll happen if you don’t open it.” He took a deep breath and unfastened the seal, preparing his ears for an onslaught of disappointed yells. In actuality, he was only half right because two voices seemed to be competing for dominance.
Remus nodded and gently took Harry’s arm. “Follow me to my office, Harry.”
There was a moment of heavy breathing before Remus answered. “Yes, very good.” Harry sighed, relieved. “You must understand, Harry, that he was never a bad man. He made a few bad decisions, yes, but I was there when he made them, and didn’t stop him, which doesn’t make me any better. Or Pads, for that matter.”
Draco sighed in exasperation and rolled his eyes in a classically Draco way. “Well, what do you suggest we do, Harry?”
“No, it’s okay. We can talk.” Everyone cleared out of the room after Draco gave Harry’s hand a parting squeeze, and Harry was left alone with the Headmaster.
“She’s still alive, but only just.” Something about this ‘Tom’ person seemed off to Draco. He had seen that glint that he had in his eyes too many times and it brought back too many memories he would prefer to remain in the past. Harry seemed blissfully unaware of it, though, probably because of his inhumane good-looks which made Draco feel a small pang of jealousy, especially over those curls which were honestly swoon worthy.
“Well that makes a lot of sense, actually.” he whispered.
They were worried. What did that mean? How much did they know? Remus stayed silent, allowing his friends to reveal more information before he did anything rash.
“Yeah?” responded Remus.
Remus nodded slightly. “Yes.” The man looked at him directly. “You know today, when you were so happy that we called you family?”
Sirius couldn’t remember actually saying his own vows, although he knew that they were the same as Remus’s, and that he meant every word. It was almost like he blacked out, because the next thing he remembered was the exchanging of rings.
Draco watched his father fussing over them. He hoped that at some point, Remus would want to brave the horrific task of trying to find a job, but the chances of him actually getting a job were low. Also, he had enough on his plate to worry about. Still, it tortured Draco to think about his father wasting away at home on his own, day in, day out, seeing his husband off to work, cleaning the house, making dinner. None of it fit the image he had of Moony, brave, clever, educated Moony who tried his entire school life to make up for his lycanthropy, and yet he still was treated so awfully.
It had been, Draco concluded, the best Christmas ever.
“Yes. A dangerous wolf.” Draco raised his eyes to meet his teacher’s defiantly. There was some kind of stand-off happening that none of the classmates could decipher, but were enjoying immensely.
“Professor, don’t you think it would be best if we let Madame Pomfrey deal with this? She can heal bones instantly.”
“My dads said that Dumbledore wouldn’t tell anyone where you were. Apparently it was some big secret. They won’t tell me anything. All I know about you was that you survived the killing curse when you were a baby, but that’s just common knowledge around here.” Harry squirmed at the onslaught of knowledge and didn’t quite know how to reply. His time at the Dursley's was awful and he honestly wasn’t excited to meet this ‘Dumbledore’ that everyone kept mentioning. Even if Hagrid had worshipped him, he can’t be that wonderful if he kept him from his godfather and the life they had. Harry couldn’t quite stop himself from being jealous of Draco. He seemed to have lived the ideal life up until this point. Thankfully, he didn’t have to reply because an elderly woman stopped by their compartment with a trolley, loaded with colourful sweets. “Ooh! Pads gave me money for this! Would you like anything?”
And so he did and the group felt that odd sensation of being dragged through a tube before being safely deposited in a quiet, safe looking village. The weather was surprisingly bright and sunny, such a contrast to the general mood of the day, and it made Draco feel just a little better. Sure, he was usually more of a night person, but visibility was preferable at a time like this.
