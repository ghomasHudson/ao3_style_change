Spring was coming. It was still chilly outside, but you could see it in the buds of the trees, in the patches of new grass.
Harry didn’t understand what Draco had been trying to prove, or why, but whatever it was, Draco had proved it. He’d won. Of course he’d won; Harry hadn’t even known it had been a competition, and he’d been wholly unprepared.
“I’m not even tired,” Draco said. He wasn’t. He chest was full of uncomfortable tightness, his head full of awful things, bloody visions of all the ways in which they might have hurt Harry.
“You could have stayed with him,” Draco whispered to her. He choked on a sob. “You didn’t have to –” He couldn’t continue; his throat felt entirely closed.
The back door opened and Seamus came stumbling out, clearly wrecked. “Oi, Harry!” he cried. “Just the man I wanted to see. C’mere. Dean broke up with me again and I need to be comforted. With your cock, preferably.”
“Look, I know I’m not Potter’s best mate –” Draco began, and was interrupted by a snort of laughter. “However,” he said pointedly, causing her to quiet, “I’ve known him for a long time, and I feel like I know, generally, the sort of person he is. And I find it disturbing that
Pansy believed it was Astoria or Draco’s father, so she was giving a voice to Harry’s thoughts (which was quite satisfying), and Sarah admitted that she didn’t know any of these people very well and had no idea who’d done it.
He nodded, and then he was following her through the door in the back and through the hallway where several members had stopped to chat.
And then he was thinking of Edwin again, his palms turning damp, the tight knot in his stomach hardening, making him feel almost sick.
“Likewise,” said Evangeline. She looked at Harry a moment more. “Would be cute, is all I’m saying. You could do worse, Draco.”
Once William and company were finally convinced that Draco had not come from the mountains to save them, they discussed what he and Potter ought to do next. Lia, or Brightbrook, as William called her, explained that it would be difficult to find Kerrick, since the Etherean leader was prone to wandering the mountains in the warmer months, and even if he was in the Hidden City, it was invisible to outsiders. William had ways to get messages to him, but it would not be quick. Months, she said, most likely.
everything! You know the future. You can work all sorts of magic – you can create Sacred Doors, for Merlin’s sake!”
“This whole night has been one long nightcap. But fine, sure. What’s another brain cell or two?” Harry said.
“We’ll break it down on paper in the morning. It’s all manageable.” He was trying to look sympathetic, but mostly, he looked excited. Harry couldn’t help but enjoy it, the gleam in his eyes, the color in his cheeks, the way he was practically vibrating with anticipation. An excited Draco was impossible to resist. “For tonight, let’s keep drinking,” Draco said, finally letting a broad grin spread over his face. “Tonight just became a celebration. I’m bringing you back to England with me!”
Karkadan and unicorns, obviously. He thought back to the story that Big Ham told at Gimheif, the story of Thea and Thera, about the herd of unicorns that had fought alongside them. He thought of Lia, telling him that unicorns didn’t exist any longer, that they’d been hunted to extinction.
“Well, I don’t mean to be rude, but I think I need to go,” Charlie said. “I don’t think I’m going to be able to sit and make conversation with you after that. Can we ask for the check?”
Something was glimmering in the darkness beyond the firelight. Draco could see the shift and strain of something moving. A ripple of muscle. There was a flash of silver; a horn. It radiated menace, and fury, and danger.
“Yes,” Harry said, and took his hand. “How do I do this?” he said after a moment, gesturing around the circle.
The kiss was soft, and a bit hesitant, and sweet. Charlie smelled nice, like sandalwood, and his mouth tasted like the after-dinner mint he’d swiped from the restaurant.
Draco felt his heart stutter in his chest. “It’s nice to be here,” he said, speaking around the lump in his throat. “To see you again. It’s been a long time.”
“Harry, listen – “ he began, but Harry put a hand over his mouth and spun him around, pressing him into the shower wall.
“Ah,” Draco said. “No need for that. Ernie won’t ever fall in love with anyone anyway because he loves himself too much. Not enough room in his little black heart for another.”
“Could use a shower,” Harry said after he’d cleared maybe half his plate. He was wearing a hopeful expression.
Charlie’s hand slid down his arse and reached through his legs to stroke his balls, and it was too much then, the slick, tight heat of Draco and Charlie’s hands and mouth, and the feel of Charlie’s hardening cock at his arse, and then he was coming and coming and coming, right into the place Charlie had come. He came so hard he could barely see, and he collapsed forward, unable to stay upright, and Draco laughed and climbed out from under him and kissed his lips.
Harry looked at Malfoy and came to a decision. “I’ll figure out a way. I swear it. You’ll never see the inside of a cell in that place.”
But Merlin, he was glad he’d seen. He wouldn’t trade that for anything in the world. It was worth the humiliation, the utter embarrassment of Malfoy knowing he was a peeping-Tom-pervert.
“Draco!” exclaimed Hannah, running over to him. Astoria stepped away, pulling Scorpius with her as she smiled out at the growing crowd. “How are you feeling?”
And then Harry, who had stared down Voldemort’s wand without flinching, had found himself paralyzed by fear. He was a child again, a child in the cupboard, trying not to scream when he felt things creeping over his skin in the dark.
Abby was Sarah’s ex-girlfriend (of five years), who’d moved to Denver four months ago, and then had promptly met someone else and broken up with Sarah. She’d been devastated.
He returned to his place in the circle and Millie straightened herself, looking flustered, her hair all messed. She cleared her throat.
He leaned against the marble wall again and gripped his cock and thought of how Harry’d looked on his desk last night, spread out for him like a gift, those incredible eyes of his never leaving Draco’s as Draco rode him hard.
Draco was suddenly struck with the notion that this was the first time he’d ever talked to Potter without one of them insulting the other or taking a swing or throwing a hex. It was a bit unsettling. Maybe to shake things up, Draco raised a brow at Potter and said, “Didn’t know you liked, you know.” He gestured around. “Cock.”
“It’s not the same. It’s the difference between being afraid of the snake in the grass and inviting one into your bed. If you’ve asked it in, and it bites, then that’s on
Then they were dancing, lost in music, and everything was Harry, his mouth and his body and his flashing green eyes, and Draco thought he could die happy like this, in this Harry-cocoon.
They both had a lot to discuss. Draco, too, was in the middle of a life-changing project. He was opening a wizarding dance studio off of Diagon Alley. He’d been worried that no one would want to take instruction from or work for a former Death Eater, but the response had been overwhelmingly positive. He already had two witches lined up to help teach, and there was a waiting list for fall classes. The studio itself was already built out, with four classrooms and adjacent waiting rooms for the parents, and an office for Draco.
Ginny nodded and stepped through the entrance into the hallway and waited for Harry to come out. “How’s the rest of your day been?” she asked. She seemed rather nervous, which was unusual for Gin. She may not have been that way when she was younger, but in the past year or so, Ginny had grown into one of the most confident, fearless people Harry’d ever encountered. It was one of the things he loved about her, before.
missing Stormy, and thinking how terrible it was that he had neither of them, when this time last week he’d had both.
“Hello, dear,” Pansy said, giving her a hug. Astoria looked like her usual Stepford-Wife self, all glowing skin and subtly sexy dress. A little cleavage, but never too much. A little leg, but nothing too risqué. Nails always painted in shades of light pink or beige, never red or black like Pansy’s. She was going to make an excellent politician’s wife, truth be told.
What in Merlin’s name was he even doing? So he’d had a dream, and it had been weird. That didn’t mean that the batty girl in Evenwood Forest was actually a thousand-year-old famous Senweir, or that she’d been the one Kerrick was referencing,
Tony screwed his face up in a way that would’ve been funny if Harry wasn’t terrified out of his mind. “I was in my office. I had to get Draco soon, because he had to get to the stage. And then…and then…” He shivered. “I was pushed out? Of my head? And I smelled jasmine…” He swayed and Harry had to hold him upright.
Ten minutes later, Draco had been revived, and healed, again, by Ginny. Ron was sitting in a chair in the little closet-room of Draco’s, and Ginny was sitting on the floor. Draco was leaning back against the wall, trying to make sure his nose had been healed properly.
God, thought Harry. How many lives was this sick notion of blood purity going to ruin before all was said and done? It hurt even its own proponents. Look at Draco, look at this. Lives upended because of some silly notion of superiority, because parents thought their child needed to marry a certain sort in order to reinforce their own bigotry.
“You need some water, I think.” Harry steered Draco into the kitchen and pushed him down onto a chair, and then grabbed him a glass of water. “Here, drink the whole thing.”
Then she offered him a smile, and he paused. It was a very wide smile, with very white teeth. For a moment, he couldn’t speak, and then he haltingly ordered a latte, feeling apprehensive even though he couldn’t quite say why. The girl had on a cropped top under her apron, and he could see the lines of her lower back as she moved around, the curve of her hips. She kept sneaking glances at him as she brewed the espresso and steamed the milk, and each time, it made his head hurt, like he’d gotten a paper cut on the inside of it. It made him wince.
Blaise rolled onto his back and stared up at the bed’s purple curtains, grinning. His cheekbones looked even better than usual in the angled light of Draco’s wand. As always, his mouth was gorgeous, and soft, and full of empty platitudes. “Ugh, I needed that. It was incredible, by the way. You’re amazing,” he said.
He went back to the Common Room, and then to Theo’s room, and then to Greg’s room, but although Theo and Greg were both in the latter, Draco wasn’t.
“Any time,” said Malfoy, another one of those real smiles spreading over his face. “Thanks for coming. And for not hating me.”
“She was. Bit of drama amongst the Hufflepuffs this year. Ernie’s barely speaking to the other two.”
Potter knew he was bent, now, didn’t he? Not much reason to shove a fake cock up his arse if he was just an average, normal, straight bloke.
“Hello,” Draco said, looking around the room as Harry approached. Ginevra Weasley was nowhere to be seen.
Thankfully, their drinks came then, and they downed their shots and Harry chugged his drink. “Okay, I’m going over there,” he said. “You’re coming with me.”
The sound of their swords knocking together was loud and continuous, and they were swinging hard, so that each collision was fairly bone-rattling and Draco had to hold tightly to his pommel to keep hold of the weapon. Over and over they struck and ducked and jumped and tried to outmaneuver one another, and over and over again, they were answered in kind. Potter tried to get a leg behind Draco’s knee again, but Potter wasn’t the only one who could learn. Draco knew this move now, and he simply wrested himself away, pushing at Potter with his shoulder. Potter stumbled and Draco righted himself and rushed to take advantage of the situation, only somehow Potter managed to grab at him even as he was flinging Potter’s sword out of his hands with his own sword, and soon they were both tumbling onto the ground.
“If it makes you feel any better, I’ve been wanking in there for ages. Tonight was really just more of the same,” Draco said archly.
That made Draco laugh. “Such a martyr, Potter,” he said fondly, giving Harry’s arm a squeeze and then pulled him to a stop to kiss him gently while Hermione and Pansy looked the other way.
It was only after that last horrible fight with Ginny that the memories came rushing in, in dreams, at first. By then, he was really, truly alone – the rift between him and the Weasleys too wide to be traversed, Hermione and Neville and Seamus and Dean all furious with him. There had been nothing left to distract him.
Potter didn't bring him any presents, didn't make any grand gestures. The only food he ever brought up were sacks of fish and chips and the occasional curry. But he brought tea, sometimes, and he'd sit in the rocker in the corner of Draco's bedroom and keep him company. Sometimes they didn't even talk, but it helped to have someone there. He didn't give advice or talk about how it was going to take time or how she was in a better place. He sat, and when Draco felt like talking, he listened, and when Draco didn't, he read or dozed or yapped about nothing of import.
Oh, shit. Draco had gotten so wrapped up in Hermione’s analysis of Harry’s feelings that he’d forgotten the purpose of this whole conversation. “Right,” he began. “So that Saturday, after Harry left…I was a bit upset. Scratch that. I was really upset. And I went out with Pansy, because that’s how I tend to cope with things, and I got pissed, and then I ended up going to the Ministry at two or three in the morning, thinking I’d do some work since I wasn’t going to be able to sleep. And instead, I found myself peeking into Clarke’s office, and, ah, the Time-Turner…well, it was sitting there, under his desk.”
, though, cast by several wizards at once. Volesky was there, but analysis of his wand showed he didn’t actually use it, so they let him off.”
He was nervous, but Euri talked him through it, and it ended up feeling wonderful. It was, in some ways, like having sex with Ginny, in terms of the closeness and how Harry had to hold himself and move, but also not at all the same. Because Euri was a man, and Harry was distinctly aware of Euri’s cock against his stomach, and of Euri's broad shoulders and muscled chest. For those reasons, among others, Harry didn’t have to worry about staying hard. In fact, he had to work at not getting
Potter rolled his eyes and went back to taking his few measly possessions out of his suitcase. He probably didn’t know
Harry’d never done it. Euri had bottomed the few times they’d had sex. But he didn’t want to say that – didn’t want to admit his lack of experience – and besides, he desperately wanted to see how it felt. The idea was certainly not disagreeable to his cock, either, which was fairly-well throbbing at this point. “Only fair,” he agreed.
“Yeah, of course,” Harry said. “Of course.” He looked over at Charlie, who looked fond and bemused in addition to looking worried. “You probably think I’m a huge creep. After Ginny, and…” he cleared his throat. “February was a little…”
Charlie was smiling up at Harry sleepily, and he was so handsome, and it wasn’t difficult to remember how much Harry had wanted him not so long ago. He’d always been impressed with Charlie and attracted to Charlie, with his toughness and his dangerous job and his devil-may-care attitude. He laughed so easily and looked at life like one great, big adventure. And Merlin, he was hot. He really, really was.
“No,” said Harry, tugging on his ear. He was jiggling his leg even faster than usual. “A friend of a friend’s holiday cottage, in the Cotswolds.”
“Rumors, that’s all. The camp is always buzzing with rumors about one thing or another. You don’t have to tell me anything if you would rather not,” she replied, her voice kind.
“I don’t know,” Draco said. “Long enough to help William settle in. Long enough to help him deal with Abraxes and Kerrick.”
“Hello, boys,” Ginny said, rising and giving Longbottom a quick kiss. “How drunk are you, scale of 1-10.”
Jesus, this was why he couldn’t talk to Hermione very often. He always ended up feeling lonely and missing the hell out of her and Ron, and also guilty for leaving, for putting that distance there.
“That’s not…” He wanted to say that wasn’t how it all happened, but it was, actually, wasn’t it? “I wasn’t opposed to it. Or, well, I was, but not because…just because of how complicated it all is.”
They continued talking, but now they were much closer, and every shared laugh seemed to bring their heads together. Soon, Euri was setting down his drink, so Harry set his down too. Then Euri was curling a hand around the back of Harry’s neck and then his soft lips were on Harry’s, and holy fuck, Harry was kissing somebody in his house, and they were alone, and it was a bloke, and honestly, it felt really good.
questions, the whys and the hows of creation, the mysteries of what happened after death, the nature of reality. How better to find answers than to work with someone like Kerrick, who had dedicated his entire life to them?
Draco took a step closer and yanked his shirt away. “I’m not a tease. I simply realized I’d rather chop off my own cock than fuck you with it.”
“Fuck yeah, I did,” Potter said, grinning and pointing to his own chest. “You’re lookin’ at a proud cocksucker right here, Malfoy.” He laughed. “
Draco nodded, and then closed his eyes as Harry pushed a finger into him, slow and steady, and returned to his mouth. His body reverberated with the sensation of Harry exploring this new part of him, and when he opened his eyes back up, Harry was looking at him with something like awe. “It feels so good inside of you,” he whispered.
Draco did battle with himself for a moment. He wanted to scream at Tony to keep Ari the fuck away from the campaign, but he decided that was probably unprofessional. “Well, we have time to decide, yes?”
After a cannonball contest with the boys and a hundred trips down the slide with Lily, Harry decided to take a break and spread out over one of the huge towels Malfoy had set out for them atop the grass. He relaxed, letting the sun dry him, smelling the fragrant summer air, spicy with the scent of wild grasses and pollen. He listened to the buzz of bees and the croak of frogs, and the droning chatter and laughter of the kids. Everything felt so lovely, so new and fresh and yet reassuringly ordinary. He couldn’t remember ever feeling quite like this, so at peace and content and so wholly at home in himself. He sighed and closed his eyes, the sun filtering orange through his lids.
He set down the drinks on a high table and crossed his fingers that some well-meaning butler wouldn’t whisk them away, and set off to look.
So he’d stood there like an arsehole, until Malfoy had screamed at him, and then he’d run. And now Malfoy wouldn’t talk to him. Actually, that part wasn’t new. But now Malfoy could hardly stand to be in the same room as him, even. Not that Harry blamed him. He felt like a right pervert, having stared at Malfoy like that.
Soon more people were arriving, guys and girls, most of them attractive and young. Some were older though, and the older ones were men, and they seemed, like Dominic, to have money. They walked around with an air of self-importance, and the younger set flocked to them like groupies, vying for their attention.
They moved on to talking about other things, but Harry couldn’t get it out of his head. He’d thought about it after Draco fell asleep, and again at work the next day. He rushed home from work and dragged Draco out to the village tavern and tried to voice his thoughts.
Kerrick looked closely at him and then raised a hand to his forehead, letting his fingers trail across Draco’s brow. “I feel something else in you. Something unfamiliar. It might be as you say – it might be the other magic.”
He put the thing on top of his dresser, beneath a golden snitch that sat up on a stand. It was so small that he didn’t think anyone would bother with it.
what he'd said in the other timeline), Charlie's unyielding kindness. Draco stood suddenly and grabbed Charlie’s hand and pulled him close. “Thank you. For everything. Even for throwing me out of the airplane and almost killing me.”
Harry started laughing again and left off playing with Pansy’s hair to attend to Malfoy’s feet. “How dare you, Harry! You’re on hair duty!” Pansy cried.
Harry swam to consciousness curled up against Charlie, a hand resting on his chest right over the dragon’s snout. “Hi,” came Charlie’s sleepy voice above him after he began to stir. Charlie’s arm was still around Harry and he began scratching gently over his back.
. It was nauseating. It was ten times worse than before the war, and it had been bad even then. Now, little first and second years would run up to Potter in packs and beg him to sign their textbooks. He’d seen a little girl burst into tears at the sight of Potter, wailing about how it was “such an honor” to be in the same room as him.
“I read something that compared the worlds to an enormous tree,” Draco said, thinking of the description that still lingered in his thoughts all these weeks later. “Most worlds are perched far out on a single offshoot of a single branch. Most people never leave thiers. A very few make their way to another – one of the closest ones, one that has a connection to their own.  Even fewer go further and begin to work their way down towards the trunk. But even then, it’s not the whole tree. It’s only sections, pieces. I think it’s entirely possible that there are whole branches that have never been touched, or even glimpsed by the Ethereans,” Draco said.
Harry chucked the roll of parchment at Draco’s face, followed by the quill. “Come on. If I sit here any longer I’m going to lose my mind.”
Draco prided himself on his ability to solve puzzles. To make connections and to think through problems. And he had the strangest feeling that the dream had been given to him on purpose. Yes, that could be in his head, but he went with it. Because maybe it wasn’t just in his head.
Later that night, he was getting into bed when he heard a voice hollering from downstairs. It sounded a bit like Ron. Harry raced downstairs and came to a sudden stop, because it wasn’t Ron’s face in the flames. It was Charlie’s.
They walked through the frozen night to their hotel – a run-of-the-mill muggle hotel, nothing particularly extravagant – and found their rooms. They were down the hall from each other, but Lisa and Augie and Tony were right here somewhere, too. Harry knew it would be risky to be seen coming out of Draco’s room or vice versa. But he really wanted – needed – to feel Draco pressed against him. And he hated that he needed it. Hated that he needed it because he felt unsure of things again.
“Still,” Pansy said. “We should be trying. But, if that’s a lost cause, at least help me talk Hermione into going to Florida, too. I don’t want to spend the whole trip somewhere that’s just as cold as here.” They were definitely going to New York City, but Pansy was trying to convince everyone to spend the last few days in Miami, Florida. Pansy had been there before and swore that they’d have an amazing time. “Think of it, Harry: a big, hot city, full of amazing restaurants and nightclubs, and then the beach, miles of white sand…lots of girls in bikinis…lots of
Draco threw a glance over at them. “You mean the night when I fed you the smoothest line of all time?”
“Harry!” Draco called, fear suddenly shooting through him once more. “Harry!” He ran towards him as fast as he could.
It was surprisingly simple, as it turned out, to separate these two Dracos, to pretend like they had nothing to do with one another. They were quite different, after all. One was full of self-loathing and guilt and neediness, and lived to be fucked by someone who gave him only the tiniest crumbs of affection. The other was a nearly whole, normal person.
This made Charlie absolutely lose it. While he was laughing, Harry licked a stripe up his cock and the laugh turned into a groan, and then Harry’s mouth was too busy to say much more about it.
Draco’s stomach clenched. “What? What are you saying?” he asked, his voice suddenly clipped and harsh again.
“Got any pictures?” asked Suraj. Draco laughed, but Suraj was looking at him expectantly, so Draco took out his phone and showed Suraj one of Draco and Astoria at a gala that had been muggle black-tie. Suraj whistled.
Maybe he really hadn’t seen Draco. Perhaps his vision really was that poor. “Do you remember being out in the alley behind the club?”
Draco felt uncomfortable, like she had just revealed something that Draco hadn’t necessarily wanted to be revealed, although he couldn’t pinpoint exactly what that was. Still, someone needed to talk to Harry; that much was clear.
“I’m just saying you have to prepare for every possibility,” Daphne said, and then the tea kettle boiled.
“Yes, I ran this morning,” Draco said, looking at Harry with a glint of a challenge in his eye, almost daring Harry to laugh.
But it didn’t explain the rest, the things he’d seen while he was being whisked back towards his body, right before he’d sucked in a breath and heard Narcissa Malfoy’s frantically whispered words in his ear:
“So, you’re telling me...” He trailed off, his eyes locked on Draco’s. His hands were itching to clench into fists, and he wanted nothing more than to hit something. Not Draco, but basically anything else. He could feel his magic crackling around him like static electricity. “You’re telling me that it was all a misunderstanding? Bad timing? Is that what you’re saying?” His pint glass suddenly exploded, shards of glass flying.
“Hermione,” said Harry. He could still remember that night, Hermione waiting for him at Grimmauld Place when he got home. She’d sat him down in the kitchen and told him the news, her face fraught with worry. She’d said ‘I’m sorry’ about a hundred times, as though it were her fault.
He’d really thought Draco was falling for him. He knew Draco was worried that Harry had only just realized he liked boys, but he figured that as time passed, that would stop being such a big deal. He also knew that Draco had been having sex with somebody, but he’d assumed, naively, that he’d stopped when he started sleeping in Harry’s room. He’d asked Pansy about it, and hadn’t really gotten a straight answer, but he’d just sort of thought…
“Um, not. I don’t think you’re a monster. Okay. So, um. Draco has been avoiding you for a few reasons, I think. One is the drugs, which I think he’s mostly stopped. And the other concerns one of his jobs.”
“And above all, watch with glittering eyes the whole world around you because the greatest secrets are always hidden in the most unlikely places. Those who don't believe in magic will never find it.”
“You know,” she said, a bit hesitantly. She fiddled with her quill for a moment. “Those all might be signs of something else. A lot of people think that what used to be called demonic possession was actually schizophrenia or other mental disorders that weren’t very well understood in the past.”
. They needed two bedrooms, a couple loos, probably, like, a kitchen, and a place to sit. The rest of this was all just ridiculous. Harry glared around at it.
He hurried down long corridors and up broad, white-stone stairwells to Harry’s room. The door was shut, looking dark and heavy and foreboding. He knocked, and the sound echoed in the quiet hall.
“More,” said Draco, a shiver running over his skin as Potter added a third finger, twisting up and into him. Draco started trembling, his forehead on the door. “
“Call me tomorrow, okay? Let me know what you decide. And don’t just say you’re going to call and then avoid me like the plague.
have one pair of jeans, so she put those on, and then pulled on one of the t-shirts Draco wore to go running.
“Of course they didn’t!” Draco said. “Frankie knew I’d had problems with Edwin, and she flat-out told me I couldn’t talk to you about him. Because of how close you two were. If you suspected, you ought to have distanced yourself from him.”
“Sometimes. It’s hard for them to not talk about magic and all that. But they have cousins to talk to about that sort of thing, so it’s worked out well, I guess.”
"Watch," Draco said, casting. Harry watched as the blue light sprang from the tip of his wand and took shape. Harry should've guessed, but when he realized it was a big cat and not a peacock, like it had always been before, he felt his jaw drop.
Draco's eyes opened reluctantly, and he fixed his gaze on the cool, dreamy blue of his bedroom walls. He’d shower - ugh, did he ever need a shower - and then he’d go to the office, finish up his work on the chest of drawers the department received last week.
The ten years since the end of the war had done nothing to curb his father’s fanaticism. If anything, it had made it that much worse. Draco’s only solace was that Lucius would never leave Azkaban. The murder of both his cellmate and the guard who attempted to intervene assured a lifetime sentence.
Harry looks up from his position on the floor where he is attempting to stretch, very poorly in Draco’s opinion.
He pressed a chaste kiss to Draco’s lips then took him by the hand and led him to his desk chair. Harry sat back down and pulled Draco into his lap facing him, Draco’s thighs on either side of his hips. He held the man to him in a one-armed embrace, hooked his chin over Draco’s shoulder, levitated the book to eye-level, and continued reading.
“It’s wrong!” Draco said a bit manically as he flopped back down on the sofa, opened the offending book, and began a complex series of arithmancy equations.
“Of course,” he said. “Is this all you’re getting today? I noticed you didn’t bring your son with you.”
Quietly, Harry slipped out of the room and ran to the kitchen’s fireplace, tossing in a bit of floo powder. “Hermione!” he called after sticking his face in the flames. He was a bit panicked. He hadn’t seen Draco like this in ages. “Code Green. I repeat, Code Green! Bring your arithmancy books and be prepared to explain Douglas Adams!”
Draco grumbled, just trying to keep up appearances, but he was giddy at the thought of Harry having a gift for him. Sitting in front of their massive television was a brand new Nintendo with a box of games, Galaga sitting right on top. He squealed in excitement and rushed over to the console ready to play.
Draco stared into the middle-distance, blinking rapidly doing his best not to break down. “I know exactly what he’ll say and yet I’m terrified. Why am I so scared of disappointing a man whose every core value I find abhorrent?”
, Potter has dragged me along to some soiree at the man’s flat. It’s nice, I guess. Just like a typical American, his decorating skills leave a lot to be desired, but the party itself… it’s not terrible. His choice in music isn’t atrocious and the refreshments are decent. But of course, Harry is once again obsessing over the man, trailing after him like a lost puppy. It’s disgusting. If he likes him so much, why doesn’t he just marry him?
Draco just grinned at him, his smile offering all of the thanks he was unable to verbalize. When the upbeat music began to play from the speakers, he allowed himself to get lost in the game, filing away the thought that he would be giving Harry a thorough thank you later that evening.
I stride into the room, looking fierce and powerful, closing and locking the door behind me with the strongest charm I know.
As if noticing the group of children surrounding them for the first time Harry asked, “Um, love… how long have you been playing?”
Harry suppressed a grin at the look on Draco’s face, so grateful that he wasn’t the one to have to explain reproduction to the six-year-old.
Draco growled in frustration and slammed the book down on the coffee table. He nearly ran to his desk which was tucked away in a far corner of the library and retrieved some parchment and a quill, muttering under his breath the whole way.
Harry gave him a teasing swat on the arse, carrying him out of the building and to the closest apparition point, only setting him down once they arrived home. “Go into the living room, I have a surprise for you.”
After another half hour of aimlessly wandering through the stacks, Harry finally decided it was time to check out. Maybe he would take his book to that café down the street and have a long lunch. He was so lost in thought that he didn’t realize that the person sitting behind the counter was the very hot, new librarian.
The man’s normally pristine white-blond hair was an untidy mess. Harry’s Weasley jumper from last Christmas nearly swallowed Draco’s slighter frame, a pair of black boxer briefs just peeking out below the hem. Barefoot and with a pillow crease down his left cheek, he looked impossibly young.
"I feel like I'm gonna puke," Harry moaned. He cast his eyes around the room for a bin or something else he could use to be sick in.
“What?” the Golden Boy asks, seemingly shocked. He crowds into my personal space. “Draco, Kevin’s not my best friend. You are.”
Harry’s head shot up, propping himself on his elbows, he stared down at his boyfriend, eyebrow quirked. “Um, Draco?”
Harry squeezed his hand gently. “A part of you will probably always love him. And that’s okay. There is absolutely nothing wrong with loving a parent, even if they have done something horrible.”
Harry scooted his chair back from his desk and reached out a hand. “Come here, love. I still have a bit more reading to do, but you can cuddle up on me.”
Who cares if the man is a legend and holds the highest arrest rate in MACUSA history? Who cares that his body is sculpted like a fucking Greek god’s? Who cares that he runs the most prestigious Fantasy Quidditch League in the Ministry? The man’s a tosser and needs to get his filthy paws off my best friend!
This week, however, he was there by himself. It felt a little odd, not having a toddler in tow, but it was nice to be able to peruse the stacks for something he wanted to read. Harry was one of those people who had a list of books To Be Read, but he always found himself going back to his old favourites: Tolkien and Conan Doyle. Mystery and fantasy were genres he thrived on, things he didn’t get much of living in Godric’s Hollow. But it was home, and Harry figured that if his life were as high stakes as what he read in novels, he probably wouldn’t enjoy it all that much.
Draco threw him a sour look then bent his head back to his task. “Forty-two can’t be the answer to the ultimate question. He’s calculated it wrong. It’s thirty-two.”
Draco pinched the bridge of his nose. " Harry," he gritted out, "you have been unconscious in hospital for three days. You followed a suspect into a Death Eater safehouse without backup. You got yourself blown up. Again."
“Oh, I know,” I say, smug. Enjoying the look of confusion and desire blooming across his bespectacled face. “This was important. But I got impatient. So, I thought, I’d come to give you a little break.”
Every letter that Draco received from the man, each annual visit he made, left him feeling hollow. All the man spoke of was blood-purity and restoring the Malfoy name. As he expected, Draco’s father demanded that he take action, stop “sitting about in that abhorrent school which preached ‘all that unity tripe’.” Lucius wanted him to marry a ‘good Pure-Blood’ woman and produce Pure-Blooded children, to make the family great again. And it was killing him. It was absolutely killing him that he could not be honest with his father. With the man that had raised him and loved him (well, the idea of him) so much as to walk away from the greatest megalomaniac alive--a man his father had looked to like a god.
"You've been out for about an hour," murmured Draco. He ran his fingers through the rat's nest of Harry's hair. "How are you feeling?"
For a moment, Harry just stared at the man between his thighs before he burst out laughing, throwing his head back on the pillow. His laughter didn’t last long though as Draco smirked again and bent his head back to his task.
The world swirled in and out of focus around him. He could hear someone speaking but couldn't quite make out what they were saying. Slowly, the blobs around him started to take shape. Well, as much shape as he could make out without his glasses.
Look, I know why they separated us. Best friends do not always make good work partners, but this is getting ridiculous. Kevin is completely taking over our lives and I’m sick of it.
Before Harry could even say ‘hello’ Draco burst out, “No! No more! I am at work for Salizar’s sake!”
“Nice to officially meet you, Draco. I’m Harry,” he picked up his book, making his way towards the door. “I’ll be sure to get your recommendation for my next book.”
Draco ran a hand down his face, trying his best not to shout. “Probably not,” he choked out as his phone beeped and he saw another call coming in. “Hermione and I will fix this,” he reassured. “Maybe, don’t take any photos until I get back home, okay?”
Draco felt the warmth of it all through his body as he looked up.  “Yes, as soon as I finish up with Laurel,” he said.
She closed her mouth, took another look at Harry, and nodded. “Right. Maybe we ought to get you to bed, Harry. Mrs. Weasley’s got you in Ron’s room –”
Ron didn’t wait for her to change her mind. With a pop, they were gone. Hermione wouldn’t have changed her mind anyway, and was secretly thrilled by her husband’s daring.  Not so secretly once they got back to their quiet house, though. Once they were alone, she let him know exactly how much she liked it.
Euri chopped up little buttery, golden potatoes and seasoned them while Harry made the paste for the lamb and butterflied the meat with his sharpest chef’s knife.  While the potatoes and the lamb roasted, Harry put together a spinach salad with charred nectarines, prosciutto, and rinsed ricotta while Euri started on the lemon tart for dessert. Harry let Euri handle the dessert because when it came to baking, Harry wasn’t always great at it. He eyeballed everything instead of measuring, which led to imperfect results. Sometimes, it was fine, especially with things like pancakes and pizza dough, but other times, like with pie crust or cakes, or, Merlin forbid, macarons (which he’d made once and vowed to never attempt again), it could turn out horribly.
Narcissa looked at them both. “I can keep an eye on Scorpius, Astoria, if you’d like to help Harry look.”
Potter cried out again, almost sobbing, and then Draco was coming, hot and fast, filling Potter’s hole up with his spunk. “Oh, god, oh god,” Potter was crying. “Yes, god, oh, yes.
Suddenly a blue light appeared several feet away, growing larger and brighter until Professor Lupin and George appeared. It took Draco several moments to realize that not only was Lupin supporting George, who was unconscious, but George was also bleeding profusely.
The inter-house unity get-together was being held in the Common Room. The library had some libations available for those who wanted them, but Granger had insisted that they not make a big thing out of it or put too much pressure on anyone. Which, as much as Draco hated to admit it, seemed fair. Not everyone else was as keen on drinking away their brain cells as Draco and his friends.
“Draco, cast the spell to hold the door, would you?” said Hermione. She looked beyond worried, her eyebrows knotted together, her mouth in a tight line.
Harry set it down, feeling conflicted. Draco was missing the class trip. Draco, the reason Harry had been so excited about it, was not going to be there. Harry wasn’t going to get to see Florida and New York City with Draco. He’d be alone. Well, not alone, but. Sort of alone.
William hadn’t done any of this. It was not his fault in the slightest, at least not technically. But he’d stood by while one of his captains hurt people. He’d discouraged others from reporting Edwin’s behavior by maintaining such a close friendship with him. Draco found that he was much more angry than he probably should’ve been. Angry at William for his willful blindness and now for his leniency.
to do anything. Not with him. And I think whatever is going on between you and me is a little more than just fucking around a few times, don’t you?”
Back to the Room of Requirement. Back to the Vanishing Cabinet. Doing it all like a good little Death Eater.
He took a deep breath. “Ernie’s begging for me to get back together with him. He’s taking me to meet his parents and everything. The plan is to let him do it, let him grovel a bit more, and then tell him to bugger off,” he said. “Oh, sorry. Excuse my language.”
Harry rolled his hips up and then wordlessly and wandlessly vanished everything besides their pants. “What will you wear home?” he asked too late.
His hands were all over Draco as they danced, feeling his damp, hot skin, almost feverish, feeling the smooth, supple leather of his trousers, and the soft scratch of his shirt.
me,” Draco said, fiddling with his napkin. “It’s just…ah, fuck. I’ll just tell you. I questioned Astoria while she was under the influence of Veritaserum.”
William, whose sword was raised, and who was only inches from one of the Queen’s men when he’d fallen, looked back at Draco. His mouth formed a little ‘o’ of surprise and his eyebrows hiked up nearly to his hairline.
Draco blinked. “I’m – um. I don’t actually think I’m the Dragon. I think that was a misunderstanding.”

, Potter. He tolerates people who are useful to him, until they aren’t. Then he tortures and kills them.”
“Oh, I…” Potter was waiting for him on the practice fields. But William was the Commander of the entire army, and he was willing to go over plans with Draco, which seemed like an opportunity he shouldn’t pass up. “Yes, I would like that.”
“Oh, really? How’d that go?” Al and Lily and James were making their way outside, probably to go look for Biscuit, Harry’s only cat so long as Stormy remained missing. Harry felt his happiness waver at the thought of her. If only he could find her, everything would seem almost too good to be true. But she was still out there, maybe hurt or worse, or maybe cat-napped by the crazy lady who’d put the collar on her before. The fact that Stormy was still missing was a nagging, worrying thing that was always in the back of his mind. Well, except for last night, for a while.
Ron took him firmly by the shoulders. “Alright, look,” he said, his gaze bright and determined like it got whenever he set his mind to something. “I’m not going to let my best mate turn into some mad recluse. You’re coming to ours this weekend.”
Before he knew it, class was ending, and Draco was going back up to his room to throw some things in a suitcase, and then Harry was there, battered suitcase in hand, wearing Ernie’s green sweater and a crooked smile.
Harry started laughing, maybe a bit hysterically, and Ari pulled him in for a hug. “Calm down, you psycho. Seriously. You’re going to give yourself a stroke.”
Harry was arching up, practically off the couch, his hand moving fast and jerky now. Then, suddenly, he was coming in silvery ribbons, painting himself with it and crying out helplessly, and then Draco was coming hard, and it was one of the most perfect things he’d ever felt, violent and hot and sweet.  Some of his spunk hit his chin and he loved the way it felt, loved that Harry saw, that Harry was feeling exactly the same way, that they’d done this together.
Harry was so mad he could hardly keep himself from punching Seamus in the face. It wouldn’t be the first time. When they weren’t having ill-advised, meaningless sex, Seamus and Harry sometimes fought – seriously fought – when they were pissed. Harry had a short temper when he drank, and Seamus had a big mouth (and a short temper as well).
“How are things with your crew?” Astoria asked, realizing they’d been talking about her for the past hour.
“Okay,” Draco said. He placed the charm on Evan and felt the air shimmer as it settled over him, seeping into his skin. “Okay, so. The third person is Harry Potter.”
“I thought we might pay him a visit, you and I,” said Dolohov. “Say hello, try to make some sense out of this whole thing.”
“It’s a lot, I know. But I do think it comes down to you, Draco. What you decide to do. What you decide to risk.”
In Draco’s memories, Potter’s smile was painfully sweet, crooked and unassuming. He’d always smiled like it surprised him to be happy, to be laughing, to be carefree. The smiles in the pictures were more practiced, more put on. Potter looked handsome and untouchable, no longer a gullible child, but a confident, unapologetic man.
“Draco!” Harry admonished. When he tried to protest, Harry picked him up and threw him over his shoulder like a sack of potatoes heading for the exit.
Harry’s eyebrows shot up into his hairline. “Thirty-two? Draco, you’re not even done with the first book. How do you know that the answer is wrong if you don’t even know what the ultimate question is?”
Still, the sight of the little boy’s awe and wonderment at the beginning of new life--not to mention his hair shifting rapidly between seven different colours--was heartwarming. He glanced over at Draco who was watching the hatching just as eagerly.
“Look, Potter,” he continues, leg perched on the top barre. “Can you follow my instructions? Can you dance with me?”
The healer said...something. Harry wasn't sure. He was too busy ogling his boyfriend. His extremely fit and well-hung boyfriend who he hoped was here to shag him into the mattress.
“I just don’t know what happened,” he whined. “One moment we were all laughing and talking about Marigold’s disastrous holiday in Naples and the next everyone was looking at me like I was lower than bubotuber pus.” He threw a hand over his eyes and let out a sigh. “I mean really, I was just trying to point out that when holidaying in Naples—”
“Sorry, what?” Harry blinked and looked into silver eyes. God, he could get lost in those eyes. He had spent several trips covertly checking out the new librarian while Teddy was absorbed in story hour.
but set it back down figuring that he might as well branch out a bit and finally read something off his massive mental list. He wanted something different. Maybe something that had a bit of suspense, something that felt larger than life, but still grounded. Hermione’s voice came back to him, raving about an American classic that ‘he just had to read’. With a grin, Harry made his way down the aisle and snagged the library’s copy, noting that the author had several other books that he may decide to add to his list later.
Harry stepped close and grasped his hand, just listening to his ramblings. His slew of word-vomit. Harry knew of course. Had read the letters. Had heard all about the previous visits. Had sat with him through the aftermath of every communication with Lucius.
Of all the days. Of all the fucking days for a Dark wizard, the likes of which haven’t been seen since that Fucker-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named, to screw up and get caught…
Draco just scoffed and leaned over the console, blocking out all the other electronic and humanoid sounds emanating from the arcade, focusing solely on the game in front of him. He destroyed every one of the alien ships before taking out the Boss Galaga and celebrating as he had before and geared up to take on the next level. Again, the kids groaned, a few breaking away from the group to find other games.
Unfortunately… fortunately? No, (definitely) unfortunately for Draco, his mobile vibrated once every quarter-hour for the next four hours. After confirming that the next two were more of the same type of photo from Harry, he studiously ignored the texts until his lunch break. He raced to the single-stall loo, locked himself in, and pulled out his phone.
Harry briefly wondered how the ghost could be wearing those hideous healer robes but his attention was pulled away by the divine feeling of Draco's fingers playing with his hair.
"That's just the potions, love," Draco said for what must be the thousandth time. "They caught the guy, " he continued. "Ron has him in for questioning now. They'll get the countercurse out of him soon, I'm sure."
“Now,” I say, “are you going to bend me over your desk and fuck me or am I going to have to do it myself?”
They had never done anything like this before. Not that Draco wasn’t up for a bit of sexting, but honestly, he was at work. This was highly inappropriate. And maybe a little hot.
If Harry had not been paying such close attention, he would have missed the smile in the man’s eyes. He may affect a cool, slightly detached, persona while at the desk, but Harry knew that this man was passionate about his job and probably quite a few other things as well.
“Of course,” Draco says as he gracefully glides to the barre to begin his stretching. “And it’s just you and me. Didn’t you read the email? It’s a private class.”
Harry shook his head slightly to dislodge that train of thought. “Been meaning to read it for ages. Figured now was as good a time as any,” he shrugged. “I’m not too familiar with American literature though. If I like this one, would you be willing to point me in the direction of more?”
Harry's face lit up and he tried with little success to pull Draco into the bed. "Come on, he's gone. If we're quick we can try that thing I found in the sex magic book Hermione lent us!”
“Um...” he rasps, his cheeks darkening with a blush. “Coach Hooch said that ballet would help with my agility on the field so...yeah. I guess I am.”
“Draco, you’re constantly staring at Kevin, so I’ve been trying to talk him up. I think he’s rather a twat, actually.”
At his words, the unmistakably scaled leg of a turtle broke through, followed quickly by a head and the top of a brownish shell. Quickly, Harry transfigured half of the enclosure into a little pool for the turtle to swim. They would have to figure out what to do with the little creature soon. He doubted that Andromeda would allow Teddy to keep it in the house.
The sharp snap of the heels of my thigh-high black dragonhide boots against marble tile punctuates every purposeful step I take as I stride down the Ministry halls, only one goal in mind. My long black robes billowing behind me thanks to a charm I learnt off Severus.
When Harry squinted down at the screen, Draco suppressed a chuckle and made a mental note to remind him to update the prescription for his glasses.
Somehow, and Merlin help him if he ever found out, Teddy had gotten a hold of a giant egg. Charlie had been able to confirm that it was not a dragon egg but was certain it was reptilian in origin. If Harry had to posit a guess, Teddy got the egg from Hagrid.
Harry reached up slowly and cupped Draco's face. "Promise. I'll do anything to make sure you're happy."
Harry would never admit it to anyone, especially not Hermione, but he loved the library. Particularly the small branch just past the city centre of Godric’s Hollow. It was nothing like the massive research library they had available to them at school. This one was mostly geared towards children and young families. The selection wasn’t amazing, but every time he walked through the doors he relaxed. He felt safe. At home, even.
"Hey, hot stuff," Harry said in his best flirtatious voice. "Is that a wand in your pocket, or are you just happy to see me?"
“Yeah, I know that,” the boy said petulantly, “but turtles had to come from somewhere. Which came first? A mummy turtle or an egg?”
Draco smiled and brought Harry’s hand to his lips, kissing the scar on the back, ‘I must not tell lies’.
“Kevin is not the one I’m constantly staring at or fancy, Potter!” I snap. Instantly realizing what I have just said I clamp my mouth shut, certain that my entire body has just flushed beet red.
“No, I understand,” Draco said, trying not to let his irritation over Harry’s less-than-enthusiastic reaction get the best of him. “I get it; that thing’s been driving you mad. Listen, Pansy wants to take me out to celebrate tonight at the Leaky. You can join us. We can talk more about it then, okay?”
“Salazar’s sake, you were hardly a dick about it. You probably felt as though you’d been hit by a freight train.”
Hermione took a sip of her coffee and glanced around the tiny room as though scanning for eavesdroppers. “Never tell Ron I said this, but Charlie’s the fittest of all the brothers,” she whispered.
Harry sighed, hating himself for being such a sap. Why could he not be sextually attracted to someone without starting to develop all these
was surprised by it, and it was his own. “Yes,” Malfoy said, his bright eyes flickering up to Harry’s again, uncertain. Harry spread out over the length of the couch, and pulled Malfoy down in front of him. Soon they were spooning in the too-small space, tucked in close, Harry’s arms around Malfoy’s chest and his socked foot tucked between Malfoy’s bare feet. Malfoy’s hair was in his face, and it smelled faintly like apple cider. Harry breathed it in and let himself sink into the softness of it, the warmth of Malfoy’s body pressed all up against him.
They took a break to down some unspecified number of shots, and then they were even more of a disaster than before.
Draco rolled onto his back and ran his hands over his face. “Oh my fucking god. I hate everything. And what, pray tell, does Hermione have to do with this?”
Harry stood, panting, for a moment, and then pushed past Ron and Hermione and Draco, out into the hall. He ran down the corridor and through the Common Room, and kept running through the castle until he was stumbling out into the snow, never mind that he didn’t have on a coat or even robes. He was out here in his jumper and trainers, like a fucking moron. He slowed to a fast walk, putting his fingers under his arms to keep them warm, because
didn’t know what to do. And then, to his dismay, Draco saw her look up at Farley’s face, and saw Farley shake his head almost imperceptibly at her. She gulped.
The tiny owl made to fly away, probably not expecting a reply, but Harry told it to wait. It looked annoyed. Merlin, even Malfoy’s owl was an arsehole, despite its rather ridiculous cuteness.
“He was the first boy that ever fucked me, you know,” Draco said. “And he wasn’t very nice about it.”
“And, besides. I wouldn’t mind if it was. Well. You know. If we –” Harry put a pillow over his face.
worthwhile about him, didn’t it? Because Potter didn’t run around sleeping with just anybody, per his own admission.
, letting Harry take him to the blue room, the room they’d painted all those years ago. He was filled with a profound sort of happiness that almost felt like pain, and in the midst of kissing Draco, Harry started crying. Again. Dear god, it was like some sort of curse that was carrying over from yesterday.
Just then the door burst open and Harry came in, shaking rain out of his hair. “Oi! What’re you two doing here?” he asked.
Draco cast behind himself, but of course it was no use. These creatures were immune to his magic. He sensed the thing behind him, closer, and then it grabbed at him, at his neck, and he wrenched himself away from it, but it stung where it had touched him.
At some point while Draco was speaking, Harry’s whole body had starting shivering. He wasn’t cold; he wasn’t exactly sure what was happening, only that it wouldn’t stop.
Draco gathered Sen and cast just as one of the karkadan – the first one – gave another deep whinny. “There! Run!” he cried, whirling.
“Oh, Draco,” she laughed. “I don’t think Harry Potter or anything short of divine intervention will stop you from throwing strops. But I think he’d tell you when you’re going too far, or when you’re being unreasonable. I think he’d demand that you treat him well.”
The blonde man relaxes a bit and continues speaking. “After graduation, they moved into Grimmauld Place and fixed it up. It took
He shook his head and laughed and Pansy looked him over for a moment. Merlin, he’d gotten quite hot. He’d always been a bit hot, but things had gone in a decidedly sexy direction since she’d last seen him. Too bad she knew Draco would skin her alive and cut off her tits if she slept with him. Because otherwise she’d definitely want to sleep with him. “You are
Draco tucked a stray strand of hair behind his ear. “Well, I’m new. To the area. Haven’t ever lived in London before, actually. I grew up in Manchester.”
“I found a space pretty close by. And there aren’t too many spinning studios around. It hasn’t fully caught on here yet.”
She handed the book over to him and he looked over the list of liminal entities. There were many, although Hermione had stuck post-its next to certain ones that had been linked to evil or demonic behavior in historical texts. “What did you find?” she asked after a while.
“Not yet,” he whispered, bringing her mouth back down towards his. She’d seemed to understand, at least, and reluctantly agreed.
Another shrug. Draco thought he might pick up the chair and whack Harry’s shoulders with it if he shrugged one more goddamned time.
Harry shrugged. “Like, I enjoy the idea of never leaving the Maine house. I mean, not really, but. It has an appeal. You want to visit cities, go to museums, eat at posh restaurants, all that.”
Berold looked at Draco, his bright blue eyes curious. “Aye,” he said. “He had a cruel streak even as a boy. I never knew how William didn’t see it.”
Draco felt the world shiver again, the ground suddenly unsteady under his feet. He felt himself waver a bit, as bright sparks danced at the edges of his vision. Edwin was alive. Strangely, Draco was relieved to know he hadn't killed anyone. But he was also filled with a shivering, creeping fear about what came next. Edwin would not let this rest; Draco was almost certain about that.
She pulled away and looked at him very seriously. “Yes. I am.” Then after a moment, she broke and started giggling again.
Harry wanted to cry. He really didn’t want Ari to leave. He liked Ari a lot. But he didn’t love him. And he didn’t know if he ever could.
Pansy didn’t even try to deny it. Instead, she just nodded. “I’ll go after work, then. Whenever that is.”
Draco thought about this. “Maybe they’re afraid. If they aren’t fighters, and they’re losing their magic, that makes them vulnerable, right?”
It was getting late, and he was thinking to ask Charlie whether they ought to head out for dinner (because their conversation was easy and fun and showed no signs of petering out anytime soon). He and Charlie were seated against the wall, Hermione and Pansy opposite them, locked in an intense debate over something.  Charlie sat in a sort of a relaxed sprawl, and at some point, his leg had touched Draco’s and he’d kept it there. It was warm and slightly unnerving, but not in a bad way. In a nice way, a way that hinted at possibilities.
They’d had an especially memorable Christmas Eve. It wasn’t quite the festive gathering at the Manor that Draco was used to. No, this Christmas Eve involved visiting Harry’s parents’ graves and nearly getting eaten by Nagini, who had been hidden in Bathilda Bagshot’s rotting corpse. They hadn’t gotten the Sword of Gryffindor (or accomplished much of anything, really), and Harry’s wand had been broken in the process.
Great, thought Harry. The Weasley brother he’d lusted over was having a lot of one-on-one time with the Weasley brother he’d fucked around with. Nothing awkward about that.
Draco thought about what else might be down here. “Beds!” Draco cried suddenly, and Potter looked at him with raised brows. “We might be able to sleep in real beds!”
“Your balls then, I’ll touch your balls.” Harry said, pushing Draco onto his back so he couldn’t keep pushing his cock against Harry’s thigh, and began to caress his balls. Draco was glaring at him furiously, which made Harry laugh again. He trailed his hand down to the sensitive spot below Draco’s bollocks and then to his hole, then back again, taking Draco’s balls in his hand and rolling them around. Draco was chuckling and also moaning, covering his face with his arm.
That was a complete lie; he hadn’t. He’d been keeping tabs on Smith since Harry’d revealed that he’d bloody
William left four men behind to keep watch over the town for a fortnight, but it was almost certain that the Queensguard wouldn’t be back, not after Draco had used Sen once more, this time to create a protective barrier, like a
On Saturday morning, Harry bought a cell phone. He had no idea what kind to buy, so he let the sales guy talk him into a Motorola Razr. He liked the clacking sound it made when he closed it.
Harry managed a gruff laugh. He stood and stumbled over to Draco, his eyes raking over Draco’s body. “Are you okay?” he asked, his hands patting along Draco’s arm, then his other arm, then his shoulders and chest.
Potter licked a line down the center of his bollocks before moving up along the underside of his shaft, his tongue hot and rough and incredible. Draco reached for his hair and pulled at it gently, the silky strands sifting though his fingertips as Potter moved back down to his bollocks, pulling one into his mouth and sucking as he teased a fingertip along Draco’s hole. He lapped a drop of precum from the tip of Draco’s cock and then let the tip slide between his lips, sucking, lapping at it with his tongue. Then again down the shaft with his tongue, which was a sweet sort of torture, making Draco’s knees buckle and his hips twitch, but not providing the friction he wanted, needed.
But nothing to be done for it now. They were here. Draco sighed and leaned back on his hands, staring up at the night sky. He remembered that first night here with Harry, how they’d been so prickly with one another, how they’d had to learn, bit by bit, how to trust one another. How, unfathomably, they had. How now he would trust Harry with his life, would trust him above all others, really. He didn’t know how it had happened, but it had.
Thankfully, the Malfoy name still had some influence, despite everything. His mother owled a Ministry official who had been a friend of the family back before the war, who still felt guilty over Lucius’s conviction and death, and asked him to pull some strings.
“I’m always pale,” Draco grumbled, and Harry laughed again, slipping an arm around Draco and letting him lean against him for support. When they started walking, Draco realized that he was quite close to fainting, probably, based on the way the world seemed to be flickering in and out, and the wobbliness of his steps.
Harry disapparated with a wave, thinking that he was glad he’d gone. Now maybe his body would finally allow him to get an hour or two of sleep.
Draco drew himself up higher. “Excuse you! If anyone has the right to be dismayed by this turn of events, it’s
Malfoy’s tongue was hot and slick against his own, his lips wet and feverish. Harry moved his mouth down to Malfoy’s throat, which was soft and warm and smelled incredible. It was an oddly gorgeous part of him, all pale and long and elegant, with an Adam’s apple that became prominent when he tilted his head back against the snow. Harry pressed his mouth against the skin there, feeling dizzy and overwhelmed, feeling hot and cold all at once. Lightening was dancing through his veins, lighting up every inch of his skin.
“Oh, hush,” said Mandy, reaching her hand over her head to pat Harry’s head. “We were getting much too serious anyway, before that. What do you all say to another round of Waterfall?”
“Hi,” Ernie said. He was in a beautiful cashmere sweater, one that Draco had bought him, in a deep, rich purple. It looked excellent against his skin. “How are you?”
crush them. Like if we did, we’d simply be taking our rightful place on top of the food chain. Like we’d be restoring the natural order.”
Living in the forest was not as romantic or fun as it had initially sounded – not that they had any choice in the matter. Grimmauld Place had been compromised after they’d escaped from the Ministry with the locket, and they’d been forced into hiding. It hadn’t been that terrible at first, when it had been a bit warmer. Now, with snow covering the ground and icy winds leeching through their clothes and warming spells, it was miserable.
Potter had been talking to Pike, but now he stood up. “See you out there soon?” he asked, putting a hand on Draco’s shoulder.
of Draco), and his eyes kept flickering to Harry’s mouth. Harry could feel Ari’s cock against him. Not quite hard, but thicker than it had been when they’d first started dancing. “So, Harry,” Ari said, tilting his head. “I feel like you know my entire life story at this point. And I know almost nothing about you. You’re an enigma.”
“I know,” Draco said, giving him another soft kiss. He made his way over to Charlie and looked down at him, running his fingers over Charlie’s muscled chest, along the lines of his tattoos, down and down to the waistband of his pants. Harry found himself wanting to be with Charlie, too, so he crawled onto the bed and began to kiss him. Charlie’s hand found its way to his hair, and the kiss was slow and deep, and then Charlie moaned against him and Harry realized Draco had pulled down his pants and was breathing softly on Charlie’s cock, his mouth skimming over it, barely brushing it. Charlie broke the kiss to look down at Draco. “Oh,
“Jesus Christ, the two of you could not be more complicated. It makes me tired just thinking about it. And also, just so you know, I am fully aware that you’ve managed to steer the conversation back to Draco
“Pansy, darling!” came Astoria’s voice from nearby. Pansy tried not to cringe. It probably had something to do with being territorial about Draco, who was her oldest and best friend, but sometimes (oftentimes), Astoria drove Pansy up the wall. She was very different from Daphne, who could be a horrendous bitch sometimes, but in a rather funny way. Astoria could be a bitch all right, but she insisted on pretending she wasn’t, which was, frankly, annoying. Pansy preferred it when people just let it all hang out. Hence, her probably-codependent friendship with Draco, who was the biggest bitch of them all.
William of March, long may he reign,” barked one of the guards. Draco noticed, suddenly, that most of them had their swords drawn, except for the few that had known Harry in Glum’s Marsh. They were all standing back, though, looking uncertain.
They were quiet for a long time, Draco’s thoughts drifting. He wondered whether a wizard could fly to the moon. Perhaps there were spells that might protect you on the way. He thought of what it would be like, to be with the stars, in the endless space beyond their atmosphere. He imagined weightlessness, like what he felt floating in the water.
Berold and William looked at one another, some sort of silent argument taking place between them. Finally, Draco saw Berold give an almost imperceptible nod.
Harry didn’t know if this was a good idea or if this meant he had to have sex. He probably should’ve considered that, because he didn’t know if he wanted to have sex. God, he barely knew Euri. Well, he’d just tell him, that was okay. They reached Harry’s bedroom and came to a halt next to his big, soft bed with its fluffy white comforter. Harry gulped and Euri started kissing him again, and undoing the buttons of his shirt, so he figured he ought to work on Euri’s, too. They stripped down to their pants, and climbed into bed, Euri properly on top of Harry now, and Harry could definitely feel their cocks pressed together and it was heady and foreign and wonderful.
“Give,” Harry said gently, peeling Draco’s fingers off of it and lifting the chain over Draco’s head. Draco felt an immediate rush of relief, of cool, fresh air, as the cursed object left him.
“Don’t smirk at me, you bastard,” Draco said, while Luna squealed. Potter said nothing, but a moment later, Draco felt a pinch on his arse. “Are you kidding me? Are you actually sexually harassing me?”
The prison tour was interesting, and afterward they met with the chief warden and discussed rehabilitation programs and alternatives to last-stop prisons like Azkaban, and also some of the funding issues that the local prisons faced. Tony had briefed them on some of the issues on the ride over, and Harry thought that Draco, especially, was able to articulate some of his opinions and ideas very well. Honestly, though, what Draco did best was listen.
“Yum,” she yelled back. “Do you still grow those Winter Pomeroys at the Manor? Those were my favorites.”
“You know what I’m talking about, damn you,” Draco said, feeling hot and fond and irritated all at once.
“Yes,” she said, settling back into the other chair. She was still in her sweatshirt and leggings, and still didn’t have a stitch of makeup on her face. He wondered if it had been on purpose. Maybe to disarm him? She did look very innocent.
“Ouch, you demon!’ Draco cried, shaking his hand. Harry was laughing rather hysterically now. “Stop laughing, Harry. This was supposed to be hot. Sexy. Not amateur comedy hour.”
He’d gone over them a hundred times, both of them. Ron’s was the same as ever: Hermione pacing, Harry coming in, then the fuzzy memory of the attic and the owl and the unreadable letter.
think it’s a bad thing to make that the primary factor in how you view the world and other people. I think it’s dangerous to think something like that makes you superior.”
Or maybe he’d be gentle with Draco’s cock, but scratch the shit out of his thighs and squeeze his arse. It wouldn’t
“Real magic can never be made by offering someone else's liver. You must tear out your own, and not expect to get it back.”
“As if that’s possible,” said Harry. “Seamus does what he bloody well pleases. Nobody can control him. Not us, not Dean; nobody. If you ever say anything even remotely critical to him, he freaks out at you.”
Suddenly, Charlie was there, putting a hand on Draco’s shoulder. “You alright, mate?” he asked. “You look a bit shattered.”
He stood in front of the blank wall minutes later, thinking. He didn’t know if the door would open for him if Draco were inside. Unless…
Malfoy looked impressed despite himself. Harry grinned. He didn’t know how or why -- certainly, it wasn’t his doing, and he didn’t really think it was Ginny’s, either -- but Lily was a bloody genius. “Oh, well. That’s a common mistake, actually -- people tend to boil initially, turn the heat off, and then bring it to a simmer, but that’s not right. You’re supposed to simmer the cauldron after adding the Murtlap, and then bring it to a medium heat after the Occamy eggshell. It should never be boiled, never.”
Draco sighed. “I didn’t really know most of them. There was one guy, Avan, that I dated. But otherwise they were just one-offs.”
Clarke’s office was just outside of the Time Room. Draco popped back out into the hall and made his way towards it. He could get into a lot of trouble poking his head around in places he didn’t belong, but the likelihood of someone finding him here at (he glanced at the clock) 3:52 in the morning was slim.
Harry told him and he was off and running, coming back with two different brown pairs. One looked shiny and new, the other looked like they’d been through a war. Harry liked the latter. The boots were big and clunky, but he liked the look of them, liked how, like the jacket, they didn’t look fresh off the shelf. They looked already lived in, in a wonderful way.
“I’d touch your tongue,” Potter said, turning towards him. His eyes were really bloody green. Oh, fuck. He was so gorgeous. Fuck.
“It has,” Harry agreed. “Sometimes it feels like that was ages and ages ago. And sometimes it feels like it just happened.”
, you git. Spells wouldn’t work on those fucking things and I panicked. I thought I’d lost my magic like you had. But in the end, a spell worked on you, so I think those creatures were just…immune, somehow.”
Thankfully, Potter, for all his fit-ness, wasn’t able to swing very well, either. Draco expected that his problem was a complete lack of technical knowledge, but he told himself that it was because Potter wasn’t strong enough, either. Frankie watched them struggle for a moment, sighed, and then gave them an assignment: hold the sword out in front of their body using both arms, extended fully, and walk the length of the practice field like that. Then come back. Then do it again. Then keep walking until their arms were trembling too much to keep them raised.
Harry left off Malfoy’s foot and slid his hand up underneath the fabric of Malfoy’s trousers, rubbing at his calf. It was well-muscled and covered in soft hair that was probably so blonde it was hardly visible. Malfoy let out a groan. “Fuck, that’s good,” he said. “I think I’m starting to see why she likes you.”
As he rode the lift to the lobby, he thought about how things could be like that with Potter, if only Potter wasn’t such a stubborn wanker. They’d been put on a project together, after all. If Potter was a reasonable person, he might be having curry with Draco as they worked. Maybe the three of them, Draco, Hermione, and Potter, would be eating together, and talking over the case. The thought filled him with an unsettling combination of resentment and longing, and he shoved it quickly away.
“Listen to me,” Draco said, clutching Potter’s shoulders and looking him square in the face, which was difficult, because his face kept moving around. “We need to go out. We need to go out and get fucked in loos. Or whatever it is you straight people do.”
When he came back to himself, he was sitting at the table across from Lavender, who was laughing hysterically. “And she said, oh no Harry, it’s on me!” he was saying, and then Blaise and Parvarti were laughing, too. He had no idea what that meant or what was so funny. In fact, he had no idea what was happening at all.
They walked past Draco, and he gulped thickly, feeling like he was going to sick up everywhere. Across the foyer, Astoria was giving him a dark look.
A few more minutes of sublime scratching and then Malfoy wrapped his arm around Harry. It was different from their usual, in which Harry was the big spoon. Harry loved that, but for some reason, tonight, this felt perfect. Malfoy nuzzled at the nape of his neck for a moment, tickling it with, Harry suspected, his nose, and Harry felt his stomach muscles tighten, felt his cock jump in his pants.  But then Malfoy stopped and yawned, and then rested his face against Harry’s t-shirt. “Night, Harry,” he said.
Draco noted, with interest, that the few holdouts tended to be Gryffindors and Slytherins, and he supposed that was due mostly to parental influence. Both houses had very proud alumni bases, and had made enemies of the other -- for decades, at this point (the feud between Gryffindor and Slytherin was hardly a new one). It made sense that a few former students would pass on their biases to their children, who were almost always placed into the same house -- because they were able to influence the hat with their desires, of course.
“Harry, I feel like we haven’t finished this conversation,” said Draco when he could free his mouth for a moment. “Don’t you think we should –”
Ginny pulled him aside as everyone began heading back to the Eighth-Year tower, and asked if she could sleep in his bed again. “I know you have trouble sleeping, and besides,” she said, bringing her mouth close to his ear. “I wouldn’t mind tasting your come again.”
Biscuit might pull through, the vet said, but she might not, and she also would be susceptible to other illnesses because her immune system was suppressed. It was all very depressing and horrible.
“Do you want me to set you up or not? He’s only here for a few weeks and then he goes back to Romania, so it would have to be sooner rather than later.”
Harry couldn’t tear his eyes away from Seamus and Dean. Dean was blinking rapidly, and then he stood and stomped out of the room, and Seamus looked like he might burst into tears. “Oh, shit,” Harry said under his breath.
He knew no one could know. Life was already difficult enough for his family without the added mess of their son being a pouf. They’d had to pay sizeable reparations to a number of war victims, and their coffers were, if not low, exactly, than certainly reduced. Their reputation was in the gutter, and Draco and his mother were working around the clock to try to repair it while Lucius locked himself in his study and drank his days away.
“Sure,” Draco said, straightening. He barked out a laugh. “Sure, why not? Let’s take one more spin on the merry-go-round.”
“He thinks he’s going to dinner, and that you’ll be there. He doesn’t think it’s a date or anything, no. And he’s a solicitor that Poppy knows. I saw a picture, and he’s quite good-looking, Harry. And obviously smart, and Poppy swears he’s lovely, personality-wise. He is…well, he’s a little bit younger. Not
Draco took that as a dismissal, and he was glad for it. He slipped out of William’s chambers and past the guards who kept watch in the hall. Harry was still in Draco’s room, so Draco ducked into a little alcove before he reached it, and let himself mourn for a moment, over the loss of William and Lia and Frankie. The loss of March.
Harry made what seemed like a thousand pancakes and fried up three packages of bacon. They ate in the dining room, which Harry had used exactly one other time, when people were helping him move in and he hadn’t gotten a kitchen table yet. Ron and Pansy sat together and kept stealing little glances at each other. On Pansy’s other side was Draco, then the Greengrass sisters. Dean was next to Daphne, and on his other side was Hannah, and Harry thought he might be holding Hannah’s hand under the table. Parvati was next to Hannah, and Harry couldn’t even remember seeing her last night and wondered, vaguely, when she’d shown up. Next to Parvati was Katie Bell, and next to Katie was Ernie Macmillan.
They raced back to the tent and shouted at Ron to wake up. “Ron, your deluminator!” Hermione cried. “Where is it?”
Potter said it dismissively, but Draco’s cock found it plenty interesting. He struggled to keep his mind from imagining what that might've been like.
“If you’re referring to the fact that you’ve never said it to me, that’s irrelevant. And anyway, I know you love me, even if you’re too much of a scaredy-cat to say it.”
“What’s there to say? I obviously have been making every attempt to not accost you anymore. I know what you must think. I’m bloody
Malfoy looked at him strangely. “I should think not, Potter. It would be rather hypocritical of me.”
“Hi, dear,” he said, putting an arm around her and squeezing her for a second. “Draco, can I talk to you?”
“You didn’t,” Charlie said quietly. “It seemed at the time like it would be sort of awkward, you having just broken up with Ginny and all. But later, I heard that she and Neville were getting serious pretty fast, and so I thought, maybe it wouldn’t be all that awkward after all. I thought when I came this time we might, ah, talk about it. Or do something about it.” He smirked. “Whichever.”
But they were children, weren’t they? Draco wasn’t even getting boners yet, not really, so surely Harry wasn’t going around fancying people. Especially
Good thing, too, because it had been rather unattractive, particularly when he’d become a full-fledged adult. There’d was something a bit hot about Nott as a slouchy, sour-faced teenager, but there was a definite limit to how long you could make that sort of thing work for you.
Draco steeled himself. The creatures were so meek and tame, and yet, he’d seen them in that fight. He knew that they were capable of violence. Half of them were still splattered with silver blood. He had to work up his nerve for a moment, and then he was flinging himself up onto the unicorn’s back and settling himself into place. He held on tight to the creature’s neck as it danced around a little, rising up slightly on its back legs. It wasn’t trying to buck him off, or at least he didn’t think it was. It felt like the unicorn was…excited. He grinned at Lia, who was looking at him wide-eyed. “Well?” he said.
Draco shook his head. “Not yet,” he said, kissing the tops of Harry’s feet and the bones of his ankles. He stroked his calves and grinned. “You have incredible legs. Have I ever told you that?”
“I’ll miss you, too, you git,” Harry said, and then they both pulled back before they made even more of a spectacle of themselves.
He took them both in hand and began to stroke them together, and Harry groaned into his mouth. “That feels so good,” he whispered.
They walked together to the lift. She was rather small, for all she seemed imposing and formidable, and her heels clacked loudly on the tiled floor. One of her co-workers was watching her with a look of unmitigated lust, and Harry couldn’t help but snicker when Pansy met the man’s gaze and coolly flipped him off.
!” Draco rocketed up off the couch and stormed up the stairs, muttering about fucking arsehole Gryffindors. His eyes felt hot and full, and his chest hurt. Potter had been laughing at him, mocking him. And Draco had stayed back to talk to him, had probably destroyed his relationship with Stephen to provide him with company after his breakup. And then he had the fucking nerve to act like that. To gang up with Weasley against him. He slammed the door to his room and flopped onto his bed.
“What?” asked Draco. He waited for a moment, and Harry shifted behind him. He heard Harry take a deep breath. “Oh god, you’re going to get all serious on me, aren’t you? We’re going to have a talk, right now, while your cock is in my arse.”
But he knew his heart belonged to Draco. And there seemed to be no way to have both things – to have a relationship like that and Draco, both.
Harry chucked a piece of scone at him. “Kindly fuck off, Malfoy,” he said, unable to keep himself from laughing a little.
She managed to sprawl backwards as a unicorn’s hind quarters came careening towards her. The unicorn drew up onto its back legs and so did the karkadan it was facing, and the two creatures kicked at each other, striking out with their powerful legs and hard hooves. The karkadan flew onto it’s back, crying out, and struggled back to its feet, cowed, now, slinking away with the unicorn’s horn at its throat.
Draco felt all the tension pour out of his body, like he was a teapot and somebody had just tipped him over. He closed his eyes and let himself forget everything except for the feel of Potter’s hand.
, he sent out into the night sky as a karkadan finally knocked the sword from his hand, causing him to stumble onto the rocky beach. He looked at the smooth, pretty rocks for an instant before closing his eyes and waiting for a killing blow.
Harry’s mouth descended on his again, hardly a kiss now, more of a plea. Draco felt Harry’s balls against his skin, felt his hand in his own, felt the tangle of their legs and the sweet sweep of Harry’s cock through his body, and suddenly he was coming, clawing at Harry’s back and crying out, wild, unchecked noises, his release spurting up against their chests, and then Harry was shuddering and thrusting faster, and a moment later, Draco felt Harry’s cock finally spill, spunk filling his arse, soaking him and leaking hotly down his crease.
Harry stared at him in disbelief. “How do I not –” He shook his head. “You make no sense, that’s why. Why everything tonight, then? Why’d you act like that?”
“No, he doesn’t,” Draco said adamantly, although he was slumping forward a little, his arms wrapped around himself.
“Too hard? I can be gentle, for a while.” Then there was a kiss where the bite had been, and Draco found himself moaning and arching up, his aching cock seeking friction.
“What the fuck, how did you get through Mungo’s wards?” Draco asked, looking over at him incredulously.
like part of the pureblood aristocracy, though, with her neatly coifed hair and her expensive robes and her flawless posture. And the way she had spoken to Draco about her niece, well. That had been a pureblooded sort of thing to do. It would probably be a no. Draco braced himself.
“Poor Harry, he’s really hard up for a snog! Somebody needs to take pity on him and give him a smooch!” cried Seamus.
Charlie’s eyes had been closed, as though he’d been lost to the sensation of kissing Draco (a feeling with which Harry was all too familiar) but now he opened them. He gave Draco one more quick kiss, and then pulled off his shirt and trousers quickly and without fanfare. Draco’s eyes got hot as they skimmed along Charlie’s body. Harry reached around and ran a hand over Draco’s cock. “He’s pretty cute without clothes, isn’t he?” he whispered into Draco’s ear.
Draco reached over and pinched Harry in the neighborhood of his nipple, and Harry swatted him away, giggling.
Lucius gave him a look that could’ve sliced through diamond. “He is my son. He’ll be kept in his room.”
Draco was sitting at the same spot he’d been in that first time Harry’d ever come here. He was bathed in sunlight, glowing. His hair was pulled back into a messy knot, and he was wearing a sleeveless white t-shirt and black sweats. Harry could see his pretty ears.
She proceeded to clack away at the letters on a plastic clacky-board that sat in front of the box, and he realized her box was now flashing and making strange noises. “I’ve logged in and now I’m dialing up,” she said. “There,” she continued, as some writing appeared on the glass part of the box.
“It’s a typical marriage,” Draco said. “They seem like they love each other. They were obnoxious about being all over one another when they first were married. Always snogging in public, Daphne sitting on his lap, always touching each other, that sort of thing.”
“You’re Malfoy’s boy,” he said, realizing it even as he spoke the words. He’d known, somehow, vaguely, that Malfoy had a child. Probably from Pansy Parkinson, who worked at the Ministry doing P.R. Harry talked to her on occasion, just casual chit-chat in the lifts or the cafeteria.
“Yes, well,” he said, trying not to look overly pleased. “I really enjoyed working with runes in school. I’ve made a bit of a study of them since.”
Harry flooed to the townhouse and fell into bed, and, incredibly (probably as a result of all the gimlets and champagne and whatever-the-hell-else), passed out as soon as his head hit the pillow. As he was swept under by booze and exhaustion, he realized he hadn't wished Draco Merry Christmas. So he whispered it there, into his pillow, as though it would somehow reach Draco out on that balcony, might warm him as he stood in the cold, December night air, looking up at the moon.
Draco stilled and glared. “Take your hands off my clothes,” he said, his voice low and dangerous. The guy was yanking on the fabric, just standing there stretching out Draco’s brand-new shirt.
He poured himself a glass of the wine that was out on the table – a nice bottle of Sancerre, kept chilled under stasis (he was definitely buying Pansy something expensive for doing all this) – and went to stand near the windows. He almost wished he smoked, because it felt like a thing one might do while waiting in a luxury hotel room for one’s lover. But an open, satin robe and a casual lean against the window and a glass of wine and perhaps an insolently raised eyebrow would do the trick.
“Well,” said Draco, dragging his figertips along Harry’s thigh. “The other houses are all emptied out. The Eighth-Year tower is the only one occupied right now.”
A new song began, slow and shivery, and they began to move. “Harry, I’m sorry,” Draco said after a moment. “I’m so sorry that I hurt you.”
Harry felt such a wave of intense fondness rush over him that he could hardly stay standing up straight. He wanted nothing more than to crawl under the covers after him. To do what, he wasn’t sure. Anything. Everything. At the very least, hold him as close as he possibly could.
He threw pajamas into a bag along with a toothbrush and stomped through the floo. He hugged Hermione and Rose and Hugo and then became very quiet when he and Ron were walking down the street, letting Ron prattle on about nothing.
Draco had also purchased a pair of his own swishy trousers, a pair of swishy shorts, two athletic t-shirts, and a pair of trainers made especially for running, all from a muggle store. The money situation had been very confusing, even after exchanging his own money for muggle money at Gringotts, but he’d managed to navigate it.
He looked over and saw Hermione standing by a little table with a teapot and cups. Her hair was wildly frizzy (no Sleekeazy's today), and pulled back into some semblance of a knot at the nape of her neck, and she was wearing black dress robes.
Astoria could hardly believe it was so close, less than two weeks away. Draco was going to be Minister of Magic, and she would be his first lady.
“There,” he said, feeling very turned on and also sick of the whole thing. “It’s a t-shirt and jeans. Yay.”
Draco’s legs began to shake when Harry started fucking him with his tongue. He realized he was making sobbing, incoherent noises, that his cock was sliding against Harry’s comforter as he pushed back into Harry’s face.
. And you can’t go around messing with them for fun,” he said, looking far too huffy and self-righteous about it.
Even though Draco had no particular desire to kiss Evan, Harry’d probably love watching, so…”Yes, that’s fine.”
Draco realized that pointing out what a craphole Potter’s house was probably wasn’t going to get him into his pants. “Oh, who cares. I didn’t come here to talk about your house, did I?”
about himself. And, as a result of that, probably, and the sheer number of days they’d been together, Draco had, at some point, begun to think of Ernie as a permanent fixture in his life. He wasn’t sure when it would happen, exactly, but he’d started to assume that at some point, he and Ernie would marry, and maybe even raise a family together. It was true that this had never actually been discussed, but they had, on occasion, discussed marriage in a general sense: where they would want to live, whether they would want kids, whether they would employ house elves. Things like that. Draco had assumed those conversations meant something.
Mallory, who had short, spiky brown hair and the uncanny likeness of a hedgehog, came running over, a vial in his hand. “Here,” he said, breathlessly, handing it to Stephens.
Neither one of them moved or spoke for several long moments. Then, finally, Potter pulled away, and twisted around, facing him. He looked obscene, almost, his hair a wreck, his mouth bright red and swollen, his cheeks pink. His neck and chest were red and irritated, and there were scratch marks scattered across them.
The fact that Draco was next to him in his bed was weird and wonderful altogether. If you’d have told him this time last year that he’d be shagging Draco Malfoy and maybe-possibly dating him (Were they dating? Harry thought they must be), he’d have laughed his arse off. Yet here he was, watching Draco drool all over his pillow and finding it funny but also a little bit adorable, and he was happier than he’d been since forever.
“I’m well, thanks,” Harry said, his eyes shifting over to Draco’s and pausing for a moment before pulling away. “And you?”
Draco found he couldn’t hate that comparison. “There are worse things,” he muttered, dipping his finger back into the Yew bowl. Potter pushed up the sleeves of his robes and offered a forearm to Draco.
Finally, Malfoy seemed content. He sprawled out next to Harry, grinning. “Well, that was fun,” he said.
was the pervert, though. And now Potter knew it. Potter knew he was into more than just jerking off.  He knew Draco liked fake cock up his arse. He’d probably tell Weasley and Granger and everyone else. Probably Neville bloody Longbottom would be laughing at Draco at dinner, whispering about his fake cock.
. And that is royally fucked up because you intended to get back together with Katie the whole fucking time, and it was – it was…” He sucked in a breath because he had run out. “It was really quite fucked up, that you did that! Because you were messing with me.”
Corner gave a little smile. “She is. She acts like you couldn’t just point and get anybody you wanted. I mean, come on.”
Then he apparated to the steps of his flat, certain that it was late enough that none of his muggle neighbors would notice. He slipped in and found Potter on the sofa, fast asleep, his mouth turned down in a little frown. Draco toed off his shoes and slipped into the narrow space behind Potter, curling up around his slack, warm body. His hair smelled clean, like Draco’s shampoo. He must’ve taken a shower. “I told you not to leave the sofa, you git,” Draco whispered, smiling against Potter’s shoulder. Then he started to cry, quietly, burying his head in the soft, fragrant hair.
“Much,” said Harry. He pulled the neck of the sweater over his face. “Smells like you. How you smell now, anyway. You didn’t wear this cologne when I was last around you.”
“I needed to talk to you,” Harry said. He thought that was obvious. “About what we talked about last Friday.”
Thankfully, the thermoses in which they kept the potion were still there outside of the now-concealed room. Greg and Vince swallowed a mouthful each, and soon they were spinning down towards the floor, shrinking in on themselves. When it was done, there were two very innocent-looking young girls standing there, and if Draco wasn’t feeling so wretched, he would have laughed.
Malfoy’s grin stretched wider and he stood, watching Harry expectantly. He thought Harry was going to chicken out or be shit at it, didn’t he? Well, Harry would prove him wrong. He would kiss that bastard so well that he’d never forget it.
“Good. Well, you, young Malfoy, have been pissing all over the Dark Lord’s floor. And now we’ve got to train it out of you.”
His father had him drink a potion that seemed to restore some strength to his limbs, so that at least Draco could stand upright and talk. Not that he bothered to talk, because what was there to say?  A house elf – Draco didn’t notice which one – brought up a bowl of broth and a cup of tea. His father helped him spoon the broth into his mouth, and then held the tea cup for him.
“I’m headed back over there if you’d like to say hello to the two of them,” she said, taking a sip from Daphne’s martini.
“I thought you didn’t want to get back together with Ernie. Isn’t that what you said? Were you lying?”
“Hell if I know,” Harry said, truthfully. “I did think about it, though. You didn’t really talk to all of Felix’s friends, but…they’re really interesting. Kind of quirky, but. I liked them. I liked that they all kind of did the same thing, and could talk about it together.”
mean something to me. It meant way too much to me, honestly, and I’ve been miserable ever since and I can’t even get interested in Phi, who is
“The magical people of March have been on the receiving end of many cruelties. Was that true for your family?” asked William. He took another sip of his wine, licking a drop off of his lower lip. It was full, but not overly so. His top lip was shorter, with a sweetly dipping bow.
. Love? Maybe. He didn’t really know. He only knew that it was taking up nearly every inch of space in his brain and his heart.
They went out to the pub down the street, and drank whiskey served to them by the white-haired barkeep. Sarah asked about Draco and Harry said he didn’t want to talk about it.
Harry apparated back to his house and found himself pacing. His body was like a live wire, all spark and crackle. The kids were coming at nine in the morning, and it was midnight, and it felt like he would never ever sleep before their arrival.
Finally, when he couldn’t stand it any longer, Draco took a breath and allowed the dam holding back all of his thoughts to break. “This will be it. Tomorrow morning will be the last time I see him. Well, that he’ll let me see him. After tomorrow...after tomorrow he’ll be so bloody furious. It’s going to be a complete and utter shit show. He won’t take it well.”
Draco could practically hear the eyebrow wiggling that was sure to be going on at that moment. “Selfies are generally photos one takes of one’s face.”
Harry’s mouth falls open just a bit, his pupils dilate so wide that there’s barely a green ring lining the bottomless pit of his eyes that I am certain to fall into.
Draco stifled a cry of frustration before gently laying his head on the pillow beside Harry. "Please," he whispered in earnest, "don't you ever do that again! You scared the shit out of me. I know you're The Boy Who Lived and all that rot, but please don't do that again. I don't know what I'd do without you."
Harry’s birthday was only a week away, and Draco still hadn’t found anybody. He’d been looking, sort of, at the Leaky with Pansy, at coffee shops, at a muggle pub with Harry and Ron and Hermione. But nobody had struck his fancy. So, Friday night, he decided to take a more deliberate approach and go to a club with Pansy, one of their old haunts from his pre-Harry days. It used to be a great place to pull, full of gorgeous men, and Draco was feeling optimistic about it. He’d made a checklist of what he was looking for, and it read:
“Yeah,” Harry said. “I think you could. You’re sure you’re not going to tell anyone? Or print this in your column.”
Malfoy didn’t look bothered, though. Instead, he brought his knuckles up to his mouth, his expression thoughtful. “Let’s make sure everything is closed up, shall we? So the place is nice and secure while you’re away.”
They made quick work of the rest of the house and said goodbye to the Flints and thanked them for their time. Those bastards had messed around with dark magic, Harry and Lavender both knew it, but they’d cleaned it away thoroughly, and you couldn’t make an arrest based on traces alone, especially when you had no proof that they'd caused any harm.
He sighed and walked into her office, where she was seated behind stacks of accounting shite. Harry didn’t understand any of it, and was glad that she did, because otherwise he’d be fucked. “How’s business?”
Draco thought about that. “Yes. I’m happy. Happy with Harry, definitely. I’ve been restless in other ways, though, especially lately. Do you ever feel like that?”
to talk about this,” Harry said. “Because honestly, I have no idea what this means or what we ought to do.”
He threw a glance over his shoulder and stilled. There was nothing in the lake. He realized the singing had stopped.
There was a big, beautifully decorated tent in the backyard, and Hermione and Ginny and Mrs. Weasley and Fleur and Fleur's sister were fluttering through the Burrow in gorgeous dresses, shrieking about hair and makeup and shoes. Ron and the twins were lounging about in the sitting room with Draco (who was very determinedly reading Hermione’s book about hand-crafted cauldrons, even though it was boring as sin) until Mrs. Weasley screamed at them to go get dressed. “Draco,” she said, only looking a little bit sick at the sight of him (he swore that she was warming up to him, teeny, tiny bit by teeny, tiny bit). “Do you need to borrow dress robes for today? I can’t believe I didn’t ask you earlier – I’m so sorry. So much going on, I didn’t even think of it.”
Malfoy sat up, looking over at Harry, his eyes wide and his mouth open in surprise, and then he started laughing. Harry, for no real reason that he could discern, started laughing, too, and soon they were both nearly in tears. “I’m sorry,” Malfoy managed, swiping at his eyes and breathing hard.
But the idea that Potter deserved good things resonated with him. There was something about Potter – maybe his status as a hero, maybe his inherent goodness, or maybe the little bit of brokenness in him – that made you want to make him happy. If Katie really thought he wasn’t happy with her, he could sort of understand why she’d set him free, despite the personal cost.
But after a moment, he was able to suck in more air, and after a moment more, the world righted itself a bit. He felt a millisecond of relief, and then he felt Edwin’s hands on his trousers, yanking at them, and then everything turned cold as he realized what was happening. He tried to roll over, to kick out at the other man, but he was trapped, his wrists tied, all of Edwin’s weight on his legs.
Millie’s eyebrows shot up. “Oh, alright, then,” she said, opening the door wider. Pansy was sprawled out on her stomach on her bed, head propped up with one hand, reading one of those awful romance books with the muscley bloke on the cover casting smoldering gazes out at the room. Harry, despite how terrible he felt, had to laugh.
Potter’s eyes fluttered open and he looked around before smiling and stretching luxuriously. Draco did not look at the taught muscles of Potter’s stomach when his t-shirt slid up. Nor did he look at the little dark trail of hair that led from his belly button to his waistband. No, he did not.
Draco knew, from drills, that it was important to keep the shield wall intact, shields interlocked, one over the other, held at a consistent height across the line. A weakness in the wall meant it could be penetrated, and then everyone in the back, behind the wall, was left vulnerable.
It was Potter. It was Potter, and there was someone kneeling in front of him, his head bobbing up and down as he sucked Potter off. Draco stilled, his body frozen in some sickening combination of panic and lust.
He saw Potter, first, sitting next to Lia, his eyes finding Draco’s the moment he came in and then sliding away. And then he saw Edwin, sitting with his Stags, his face bruised and bandaged.
Draco immediately attached himself to Harry’s side, and let out a pleased sigh when Harry slid his arm underneath Draco’s head. “What did Cassius say?” Draco asked, breathing in the Harry-smell of Harry.
And in case you missed it, I added another chapter to the total chapter count, because I'm going to do a fun little epilogue...of sorts. You'll see :)
But whatever it was, it took mere minutes after getting back in bed for him to fall into a deep, dreamless sleep, and he didn’t wake until right before breakfast.
They found the makeup rooms backstage, but none of the people there had seen Draco either. Nott was sitting in one of the makeup chairs, a white cape around the front of his suit to keep it spotless, a woman leaning over him, spackling his face with something to keep the shine off. Harry could see his face in the lighted mirror, and he stared for a moment as Nott’s eyes shifted in the mirror and found Harry’s. The corners of his mouth went up, just barely, but it was enough to make Harry shiver with apprehension, and then Nott was looking away again and saying something to the makeup girl.
Suddenly, she sprang to life, jumping on him and tickling him, and he fell back against the wall, whacking his head. “Ow! Ginny Weasley, that
“Good point,” Harry said, pulling at Draco’s t-shirt. “It got you riled up, though, didn’t it? Did you dance with anybody?”
“I don’t,” Draco said simply. “I have sex with Astoria. She has sex with me. That’s it.” He turned a little pink. “I have some magazines I keep in a locked drawer in our room. She knows about those.”
Hermione laughed loudly before covering her mouth like she hadn’t meant to. “Oh, why the hell not?” she managed.
“Harry, for Circe’s sake. Blaise is fine. We took him to Madam Pomfrey and she healed him right up. And he refused to tell her what had happened, so you’re not in trouble. Come on.”
Draco made his way over to Lia. “You ought to get ready,” she said, grinning over at him. “You’ve got to make yourself pretty for Gimheif.”
“Good morning,” Draco said, holding onto Scorpius’s hand tightly. He would not ruin this day for his son, no matter how angry he still was. Thankfully, Astoria felt the same way, and the morning passed uneventfully, both of them speaking mostly to Scorpius, and to each other only when necessary. They flooed to his parents’ house at noon, where there was a veritable feast waiting for them. His mother gushed about the Christmas Eve party, his father looking murderous, and then his father began picking apart every bit of the campaign, every news release and every advertisement, every interview and, of course, the fact that the signs said DRACO instead of Malfoy.
lovely. And she danced rather scandalously. Ron had not had a hard-on because of Harry. No way, and even thinking about it was dumb, even dumber than sleeping with Seamus, which had been really fucking dumb.
At first, there were only Molpaedian soldiers, in togas and sandals, despite the increasingly cool weather. They had on brilliant red cloaks that fell to their knees, silver helmets, and magnificent swords and spears at their backs. They marched formally up the center isle and then stepped aside, facing the center. Still, the new king didn’t come. Instead, a handful of older men, clad in floor-length togas, came floating up the middle of the soldiers in pairs. Advisors, most likely, or a council of some sort. And then, finally, Alexander made his appearance in rather dramatic fashion, carried in on a golden chair with a velvety sapphire cushion. Draco approved.
Pansy and Draco had been dancing together, as they tended to, but Draco needed a drink. Pansy flitted off to find Blaise, and when she did, she slung her arms around his neck and Blaise wrapped his arms around her waist, and Draco laughed. It was so funny that those two didn’t think anyone knew they were fucking. He was almost certain
Harry opened his mouth to protest, but Draco cut him off. “Ari’s probably looking everywhere for you,” he said.
Harry nodded. He understood that, although he didn’t think it made it any easier to deal with the empty place in your life where that person had been.
was for Draco to come running in here to tell Harry that he’d told Blaise to go to hell, and that he wanted to be with Harry and nobody else. He wanted Draco to promise never to let Blaise touch him again, and then to tell Harry that he wanted to shag him until he forgot that Blaise had ever even existed.
“I mean it!” cried Harry. “I swear! Although...” he thought for a moment. No time like the present, he supposed. “I
“Um, I don’t know,” Draco said. He didn’t want to let his own feelings color his answer, but it was probably inevitable. He tried to be as honest as possible. “I know Harry had a really intense relationship when he was younger, and it turned out badly.”
Draco laughed. Harry was giddy over something, absolutely vibrating with it. “Alright then, what is it?”
They’d taken a cab back to Robbie’s apartment, and Harry’d thrown him up against the wall (Robbie liked fucking against walls) and sucked him for a bit before turning around while Robbie spat on his fingers and thrust them up into Harry’s arsehole, not particularly gently, and then switched those out for his cock.
It truly was a community library. Yes, there was a good-sized nonfiction section, but that was mostly full of how-to books and biographies. At any given time, the librarians were running different programs: genealogy classes, children’s story hour, crafting clubs, and STEAM events for all ages. There was a play area tucked into the far corner of the children’s section that Teddy loved. He had been bringing his little godson for almost two years. The boy was insatiable. He begged to come every week, and more often than not, Harry indulged him.
Okay, very hot. There’s a reason why I’m already sporting a semi and it isn’t because of the delicious friction these lace knickers create against my cock with every step I take.
Today was no different. Draco wasn’t sure if he had been standing there for hours or only moments. Most likely the former. Harry was always good about giving him space when he needed it. Without a word, Harry came to stand beside Draco, allowing the sounds of the countryside to envelop them. He wouldn’t speak unless Draco broke the silence.
“Godson,” Harry corrected with a smile. “He’s on vacation with his dads, so it’s just me this week.” He wanted to continue chatting with the hot librarian, but Mrs Figg had queued up behind him with a massive stack of large print romance novels. “Thanks...”
“Oh,” Harry said, almost to himself, his voice sounded small. “I probably should have looked at examples of selfies before I posted all those on Facebook, huh?”
“So, shouldn’t you be enjoying yourself? What’s going on with you? You’ve been kind of distant lately. I...” he pauses, looking slightly embarrassed. “I just want my best friend back.”
They stood in silence again, watching as birds danced over the water, searching for food and the Giant Squid splashed merrily at them.
Draco suddenly propped himself up on an elbow to look at his boyfriend. “Hey, you’re likeable. Maybe you could teach me how to interact with the unwashed masses.”
Draco flopped back on the bed dramatically. Apparently being seated on the plush surface wasn’t emotive enough. He had been in a strop ever since he returned home from pub night. Well, he was probably in a strop
"Draco?" he asked. The word stuck in his throat. His mouth was dry, parched really. "Did I black out?"
He wasn’t exactly sure when Draco fell back asleep, but he smiled into the wool clad shoulder, smelling the citrus of the man’s body wash, clean sweat, and a scent that was uniquely Draco. He held the man closer to him feeling content, in love, and honoured to be allowed to see this very private side of the most amazing man in the world.
He promptly tucked the phone back into his pocket and tried to remember how to breathe, a task that was not made easy by the sidelong glances he was receiving all around him.
Harry blinks, then raises an inquiring eyebrow, “You’re not mad that I’m the one you’ll be tutoring?”
As he shot down more ships he felt a presence behind him. Harry’s warm hand grasped his shoulder in a companionable gesture. “There you are, I’ve been looking all over for you!”
Putting that thought aside, Draco set his phone to vibrate and placed it back in his pocket ready to begin the workday.
We were supposed to have a quiet day in--well, not too quiet--all to ourselves. We shut off the floo; we sent the owl to France with a letter from my mum; we locked and warded all the doors. I bloody well prepared myself for this! I’ve been wearing that god-damned plug he loves so much since I woke up this morning in preparation for today. But no,
I get it, I do. I can’t really be mad about this. But I was looking forward to this, damn it! I just wanted an easy day with my boyfriend. Is that too much to ask? So… here I am, opening the door to Potter’s office with just a flick of my wand and pure sexual frustration.
Unable to type out any sort of a response, he called Harry, who to his credit, answered on the first ring.
“Oh, I’m sorry, can you judge me harder?” Draco smirked, “Your pre-pubescent angst only fuels my superior gameplay skills.”
With those words, I unclasp my robes, letting them pool on the floor around me to reveal the pièce de résistance: a Gryffindor red and gold lace corset with matching knickers.
“Hissss, hissss, hissss,” Draco mouthed against Harry’s waiting entrance, dragging a teasing finger across the rim.
“You know that you don’t have to tell him, love,” Harry said after a moment. “He never has to know.”
Draco was silent for a moment, a bit of amused horror filling him. “Harry,” he said, “you didn’t send me any selfies.”
Several hours, a bottle of firewhisky, and several ill-advised shots of gigglewater later found Draco Malfoy trying to suck his boyfriend’s soul out through his cock. Harry moaned, fully believing that Draco would be much more pleasurable at this task than the dementors.
“No, I’m not mad,” there he goes rolling his eyes again for the third time in as many minutes. “Frustrated? Sure that this will be a disaster? Not actually convinced that you can put your ego aside for one moment and learn something from me? Yes. But I’m willing to try. So, come on!” he switches legs on the barre and nods his head motioning for Harry to join him. “I haven’t got all day twinkle-toes!”
It had become a refrain between them over the past year. Something they could say in addition to the three little words that meant so much. It was a way for them to ask for strength and support without appearing too weak, almost like a secret code between them.
Euripides came through the floo behind her, gripping a bottle of wine. “Hello,” he said shyly, holding out the bottle to Hermione. “I brought this.”
Draco'd just returned home to find Pansy waiting for him with wine (yay) and advice (boo). He was too tired for lectures and advice. He was always tired by Friday after a long week busting his arse at his job at Gringotts, where he managed the investments of several high-profile family offices. After the war, finding a job hadn't been easy, but the goblins weren't as opposed to hiring former Death Eaters as the rest of the wizarding world, particularly when those former Death Eaters had spent their first few post-war years earning a degree in finance from a muggle university.
Like Draco had been, the first time. Merlin, he’d been such an unforgivable bully. No wonder Potter had hated him.
He stopped by Tony’s office and spoke to him for a few minutes, and then he was apparating to Mungo’s and walking to the second floor of the hospital where Sarah’s room was located. Pansy was already there with Harry, and Harry looked to be in a slightly better mood than he had been. Pansy’s dry sense of humor and lack of sentimentality had always helped to coax Draco out of his black moods, so maybe it was effective on Harry, too.
Draco leaned over him, holding him, kissing his cheek and his shoulder, and they moved together, lost in each other. Draco pulled his arse up higher and suddenly he was hitting that delicious place deep inside that made Harry cry out and clutch the sheets in his fist. Draco straightened a little and ran his hand up and down Harry’s spine, and Harry was moaning in pleasure, rutting against the bed, feeling Draco all through him and along him and everywhere.
Lisa frowned. It was unusual for Draco to be distracted like this, though he felt like he couldn’t much help it. “D’you want to use the pureblood donor list for the Halloween event?”
This would be much easier if Draco hadn’t been behaving so strangely since his visit to Chicago. He hadn’t done anything overt, not really. He still treated Astoria with care and consideration, still kissed her and touched her, still made love to her. He still lavished attention on Scorpius, sitting and talking with him over breakfast every morning, scooping him up when he returned from work and giving him baths in the evenings.
memories that he’d allowed the everyday ones to fade over the years. He’d forgotten just how funny Draco could be, how droll and sarcastic.
He stood there for a moment mourning the loss of it, and then he decided he had to find Potter. This was stupid. The fact of the matter was that they could not afford to split up. If he needed to, he’d apologize even though it wasn’t his fault (it
He felt the spray before he processed the sight of it. It was cold in his face, on his skin; a freezing mist.
Draco leaned closer. “Harry and I used to fuck,” he said, very precisely and very loudly, in as posh an accent as Harry’d ever heard. Harry looked over at him with his mouth hanging open, and Draco had on his best arrogant-prick smirk, his nose up in the air, his lithe body on display, one hand on his hip. Harry felt his cock swelling up in his jeans.
They all cried a bit and then buried her out back. Al made a cross in Harry’s workshop to mark the spot and Lily said some lovely words during the funeral and asked Harry to read a poem she’d written. He managed to speak around the lump in his throat. “Biscuit, you were black and white. Never did you start a fight. You were nice and liked to play. You chased rabbits the whole day. Your fur was soft and you purred like mad. Without you, we are very sad.”
as it tugged harder, but finally it slipped free, possibly taking a few bits of hair with it. He sent it flying behind them, back behind the stairs that had led them into the tunnel from the courtyard.
“I don’t have anywhere to be, Draco,” she said, giving him a gentle smile. “And we’ve got tea coming.”
Malfoy trailed his fingers over Harry’s chest, tugging gently at the hair there. Harry was fully hard now, just at the nearness of him, at the feel of those fingertips touching him softly. “You’re an extremely violent snorer, you know,” Malfoy said, his breath warm against Harry’s chest, bringing goosebumps to the surface of his skin. “I thought I was never going to be able to fall asleep.”
of it.” Harry’s voice hitched at the last, and he bit down hard on the inside of his cheek and he looked away, not wanting Draco to see his expression.
“Well, there was a picture of you at dinner with him in the Prophet’s society pages. And Mathilda Goyle saw you with him the other night, too. I’m assuming this is all part of your mysterious plan.”
“Mine too.” The world started moving and Draco startled. They were in a cart of some sort, he realized.
“Why did you grab my hand? Was he trying to talk you up or something? Was he making you uncomfortable?”
“Well, you have me,” Draco said. He had already considered, several times, how dire things might have been if neither of them were capable. He’d also wondered whether Chang and Peabody had maintained their abilities here, and what it would have meant for them if they had not, although he’d never brought it up to Potter.
“Yes, yes, I suppose I’ll miss you, too,” Draco said, relenting and giving in to Harry’s insistent mouth once again.
“Oh, never mind! I take it back. You’re as big of a git as I always thought you were,” Pansy said, prompting Harry to throw a pillow at her.
She got up from the chair by Sarah’s bedside and made her way over to Harry, until she was standing directly in front of him. “Don’t hurt him.”
They left right after sunrise the next morning, and Kerrick saw them off, his hair flaming in the morning sun, his eyes strange and unknowable as ever. Draco felt like he shouldn’t have even come. He’d learned a bit, to be sure, but he still couldn’t create a proper Temporal Door, much less a Sacred Door that might bring them home.
Hermione shrugged. “We’ll see, I guess?” She grimaced at the look on Harry’s face. “Maybe it’ll be fine,” she quickly amended, though it lacked conviction.
The pretty witch at the stand gave him a grin. “I know who you are, Mr. Potter, goodness. Right this way.”
. He moved up through the crowd towards the hen party. Most everybody was on their feet, and Harry didn’t blame them, because Malfoy was quite the showman. He saw a flash of red hair and beelined towards it.
“Well, thank you," said Potter. "D’you think you can round everyone up? Unspeakable Malfoy and I are going to work on the site a bit, and we wouldn’t want anyone getting injured.”
Draco stuck his tongue out at her and made his way to the entryway, glancing at the toilet as he passed, hoping Harry was there. But it was empty. He stood there for a moment, confused, and then the door to the coat closet opened up, and a broad, calloused hand grabbed his arm and yanked him inside and shut the door behind him. “Lumos,” Harry whispered, and the interior of the closet glowed softly. They were jammed into one side of it, the coats of guests taking up the other half. Harry wrapped his arms around Draco’s waist and pulled him even closer.
Luna finished her salad quickly and Hermione gulped down two drinks in quick succession, which meant she was likely feeling quite buzzed, knowing her tolerance. They made their way to the front just as Draco was being announced as Sebastian. Harry hadn’t made it out of the bathroom in time to hear the stage name on his previous visit, but it was a nice enough name. Draco was a nicer name, though.
Nott didn’t seem to be listening anymore. “I wanted to work with you, Draco. That’s all I wanted. I imagined it, back then.”
“Okay, um, babe? What exactly are you trying to do here? There is no possible way you’re going to be able to bounce me up on down on your cock like – oh,
“Hello Myrtle,” he managed. He knew that Potter would be bursting in soon, and he was so afraid. “No, no one’s done anything to me. I’m the one who –” He found himself unable to finish.
It stood to reason that if he was here, in this timeline, that the future would be here, too. Would be an extension of this moment, these circumstances. He would move them forward, then, along this path. Part of him was sad to skip all the moments he would share with Harry in the intervening years, but he suspected that they might be full of pain and far too much yearning. And nobody needed to live through the war twice, did they?
“Yeah,” she said. “I know. Everything seems impossible and pointless, lately. We’re making no progress, not since we got the locket.”
Harry leaned against the counter, feeling dizzy. He closed his eyes, trying to make the room stop spinning. “I’m a bit pissed,” he said. Honestly, this was worse than he’d been with Seamus. He’d been properly sozzled on Saturday, but not to the point where the world refused to stay still. “Oh, fuck, we never ate anything.”
They walked to a nearby whiskey tasting room, which was nothing like the pubs he and Ron tended to frequent. It had menu full of fancy-sounding starters and dozens of whiskeys, and was covered in gleaming wood and sparkling glass everywhere. He and Malfoy both got a flight of whiskeys and Harry found it surprisingly easy to talk to Malfoy. Why it was still surprising to him at this point, Harry didn’t know, but it was. Probably because he never could’ve imagined it before it actually happened.
Draco wondered what was worse: never having any siblings at all (he’d always wished for them, mourned his lack of them) or having them and then losing them. Probably the latter, he imagined. “I’m sorry,” Draco said. “For all of it.”
“You think I want you just because your life’s not perfect at the moment? You don’t think I just…want you?”
Draco nodded. “You’re lucky I didn’t let you get out of being my friend after that. Goodness knows you tried.”
He was so busy ruminating on how this newest interaction with Hermione might be an indication of real friendship that it took him a few minutes to realize he’d just agreed to a date with Charlie Weasley. Possibly.
“Yeah,” Harry agreed, although he often cleaned by hand just because he didn’t mind it and it was what he’d grown up doing. In a pinch, though, he wasn’t above using a wand.
Draco paid for their drinks and they sat down and Draco took out his list. “I have a few questions for you.”
“Yeah,” Harry said, grimacing. Jesus, if the stupid, clumsy hand job he’d let Zach give him was the reason his relationship with Draco had fallen apart, he would never forgive himself.
“No, of course you’re not,” Harry said, taking his hand and kissing it. “But now that I’m thinking on it, you shouldn’t be able to bet on the ruination of your own marriage since you have so much influence over whether it ends.”
“Really?” asked Draco, who hadn’t been keeping up with the latest Hufflepuff goss, because ew. “Thought she was with Macmillan.” He had been vaguely aware that Ernie Macmillan and Hannah Abbot were dating for a long time prior to the war.
Harry stormed out and Draco almost had an honest-to-god mental breakdown, but then a half-hour later, Harry came back and said okay.
He snorted. “Oh, I’m sure Bunny’s worrying about you this very moment. Probably about whether you’re getting enough iron, or whether you’ve insured the ring she gave you last time you visited. You know, something exceedingly important. It’s probably keeping her up nights.”
He went back to his table. “Hey guys, I’m going to call it,” he said, fighting to keep his voice steady. “I’ll see you tomorrow, Lavender?”
Draco had gotten engaged to Astoria six months ago, and yes, their engagement party had featured in the Prophet. “You don’t know anything about me,” Draco said softly. “Or my fiancée . Or my life.”
Hermione looked absolutely scandalized by this remark, but Pansy continued on, relentless. “And then there’s Slytherin, the best house. Slytherins are goal-oriented, resourceful, and brilliant strategists. That’s where I’ll end up, hopefully.”
It went fine. The boys were thrilled to be back together, but Harry found himself watching them worriedly. And as he did, he noticed something. When they got mischievous and plot-y (like when they hid Lily’s new training broom and made her cry), it was usually
Draco was already there, clad in a light gray suit, hair immaculately styled, playing with Scorpius. Draco was using his wand to fold pieces of parchment into origami shapes, and Scorpius was laughing and grabbing them.
Draco, feeling that it was probably acceptable, leaned over and gave Harry a kiss on the cheek and Harry leaned into it, looking happy. “Don’t keep him up too late, ‘Moine. You know what a bastard he is without his eight hours.”
him, because that’s not a possibility anymore. But it’s because of him, I guess. Because even though I try and try to move past it, I can’t. I don’t know why. But I can’t.”
But the next week, Evangeline stopped by after class and said Reina told her she had to meet Draco. Evangeline quizzed him a bit and asked him to show her this and that, and eventually asked if he’d ever thought about teaching. They desperately needed someone to teach tap, since their tap instructor had quit (while a couple of the other instructors were covering his old classes, it wasn’t really their forte). She also said she wanted to hire more men, that the male students needed other blokes to look up to, to encourage them.
Draco turned, narrowing his eyes, and then froze when he saw Harry grinning at him, hands in his coat pockets.
“I already told you,” Malfoy managed, his grey eyes wide. He blinked, and Harry saw that his lashes were almost comically long, especially for a bloke, and blond-tipped, sweeping over his eyes like little fans.
Charlie chuckled and his chest rumbled beneath Harry’s head. “Hardly. You responded to every little thing I did. You connected with me completely. You opened up perfectly, Harry; you were beautiful.”
The alert feeling lasted for a few hours, but after lunch, Draco felt like he’d run smack into a wall. He could hardly keep his eyes open. He wished he had Harry, to pet him until he napped. He didn’t, though, so he forced himself to stay awake during Muggle Studies and then went to the library (the regular one, not the one in the Eighth-Year tower). He stopped in the kitchens beforehand, for a cup of tea, and that helped him get through his reading for the day.
After a while, Harry sat back and moved his hands towards Draco’s pajama shirt, carefully undoing the buttons. When he was finished, he pulled his own shirt off. “Take off your trousers,” he said, his eyes dark.
Harry wondered, for a brief moment, if he should let the whole thing go. Forget it and just be with Draco. Part of him wanted to. Draco’s mouth was so soft, and it felt so good to be here with him, so insanely good, but Harry knew he would never be able to live with not knowing. Not in the long run, anyway.
Draco moved around the bed and set his coffee down on the nightstand, then sat down against the headboard on the opposite side, tunneling his feet down into the covers. Harry had the urge to move his feet towards Draco’s, to find them and to make contact, but he didn’t.
She laughed. “Right. So.” She looked around, then handed him two of the weights. “Try these, they’re only ten pounds, but you can do a high number of repetitions.” She considered him. “Maybe not so high, I dunno.” She picked up another set of weights, and hers said five.
Draco knew this was a pointed remark. Harry was fishing for reassurance, and Draco was glad, suddenly, that he could give it to him. “Yes, well. Berold and Kerrick and I are all situated in this wing – close by, in the event that we’re needed. That’s really the only reason for it.”
“Hi,” whispered Draco, his face caught in the moonlight streaming through the single window. Harry relaxed. “How are you?”
“Lots of activity in Azkaban. I almost wish I was there instead of here with you. Although I am looking forward to watching you die, you fucking blood traitor.” He smiled. “And then there’s the muggle attacks. Should begin in an hour or two. We’re declaring war, Malfoy. War against the muggles. All over the world, wizards are going to open fire into muggle crowds. I’m talking blasting curses, Fiendfyre, even. Robes on, wands out. Very dramatic. We’re forcing their hand so they have no choice but to go after us. And then we’re going to annihilate them in retaliation.” He laughed now, a low, throaty chuckle. “It’s going to be so much fun.”
“It was just…” he shrugged, stopped and pulled his arm away to run a hand along the back of his neck. He looked at her, his eyes shining in the moonlight. “Brilliant. It was brilliant, Pans, it was so wonderful, and I –”
He took a deep breath, realizing he couldn’t very well stay in the loo forever, and went out to the sink to wash his hands, when suddenly the bathroom door was banging open.
Draco ached to touch him, to close the gap between them. But he was all too aware of what Harry wasn’t saying. He wasn’t saying that he wanted things between them to resume. He wasn’t saying that he loved Draco, or that he cared about him, or that he would miss him, even. He seemed sincere when he’d said he’d forgiven Draco. But that didn’t mean he wanted to be saddled with Draco’s reputation, with his past.  “Thank you,” he said. “I hope the same for you.”
you’d do it, and you didn’t disappoint. Bravo, darling, bravo. Do you feel like a brand-new man? Feel like you could leap over tall buildings in a single bound?”
She nodded, still smiling. “I’ll get your number from Draco,” she said, and then, with a little graceful wave, she was off. Harry let out a breath.
Draco wasn’t sure about that. Potter seemed like the type to avoid difficult emotional situations. “I’m not saying it’s true. I’m just saying I think that’s how she feels. I think I should talk to her.”
One member of the audience stands up and raises his hand. The blonde man looks at the man like he might hex him. “Tell me you’re not asking a question,” he says.
He summoned his dildo and set it down next to him and prepped himself slowly, taking time to enjoy the feel of his fingers, to relax around them. The room was so quiet and still, the sunlight winter-thin despite it being mid-day. He thought of Potter’s mouth, so pink and lush, of his gorgeous, pert arse, the shape of his legs and his muscled back. He thought of his eyes on Draco’s just a short while ago, his stare so intense it burned, and then he thought of his smirk.
Draco tried to sort through all that and wished he had his field notebook and biro so that he could sketch out a family tree. “Complicated.”
And so, with the entire Weasley family looking on (minus that prat Percival, anyway), Draco did.  And after a moment, he forgot that anyone else was there at all.
The oil didn’t lather up, but he could feel a little tingle on his scalp, and it felt wonderfully fresh when he rinsed underneath the waterfall. He took his time scrubbing all his neglected bits, marveling at the sensation of being clean. It had been a while since he’d felt like this, so polished and sweet-smelling, his skin cool in the moonlight. He sighed happily and imagined his decadent, enormous bed at home. What he wouldn’t give to fall into clean sheets right now. If he ever got home, he’d never take his luxurious feather-stuffed mattress topper or his crisp, cool sheets for granted again.
They kissed slow and sated for a moment after, and then Draco vanished their mess and straightened up his trousers, tucking his shirt in very carefully. “Tonight at yours, then,” he said, and then slipped out of the conference room.
“What the fuck?” he cried, looking down at Draco just as the noise repeated. It sounded like someone was being skinned alive.
Draco and Pansy beelined for the bar and downed two drinks in quick succession before venturing out onto the dance floor. Draco was watching the crowd around him with laser-like focus, looking for men who fit his criteria. Before long, he’d located an extremely pretty one. He was a brunette, but his hair was curly and soft-looking, and his face was borderline-angelic. His mouth was round and sexy, his body leanly muscled, and his arse looked just about perfect. Check, check, check, check, check.
Once they were out of the hotel, which was warded against apparition for purposes of the debate, Astoria gripped Harry’s arm and soon they were surfacing in an elegant foyer. It was silent everywhere. “Blaise!” cried Astoria. “Daph? Hello?”
They talked about Teddy for a while then, about what a great kid he seemed to be, and what a good job Andromeda was doing with him. Harry seemed to know him particularly well, and appeared to have fully embraced the godfather role, going above and beyond what was expected.
“Merlin, don’t put yourself out or anything,” Harry groused when he was safely within the confines of his dressing room.
Potter took off his tie, and, after a moment’s hesitation, began unbuttoning his shirt. “It’s rather brave, you know. That you’re doing this. It can’t have been an easy decision to make.”
Harry glared at him for a moment, like he was itching to say something horrible, and then all the fight seemed to drain out of him. “Yeah, okay. Sorry. It’s just easier, sometimes. Talking to you like that.”
So horseback (and unicorn-back) it was, and they set out while the world was still half-dark. The whole lot of them – every soldier to the man – plodded through the swamp and crossed the river at the shallow spot, and then they split up into groups. The groups with wagons were taking the northern route, heading north and then southeast, or taking the Kingsroad, which cut directly through the kingdom and ended in Septerra. The group that would be on the boat – the smaller group that included Draco – was taking a southerly route that would lead them to a flat piece of land near the sea from which they could launch their little boat.
“Yeah, well, I just wanted to let you know,” he said, nodding to himself. “I’ll see you upstairs in a bit.” And with that, he made his way to the other end of the table.
Sure, there was some house rivalry, especially when it came to Quidditch, but it felt as though it was being done out of some sense of muted loyalty, not because people legitimately wanted to murder each other. Draco noticed that Weasley had become chummy with Finnigan and Thomas, but that group kept their distance from Draco and the other Slytherins. Not a hostile distance. An indifferent one, really.
Draco wanted to make some cutting remark about packing up one’s things via committee, but he refrained. Nearly all Ernie’s criticisms of Draco had related to his sharp tongue and temper, and how he was always sarcastic and occasionally cruel. If he wanted Ernie to start mourning the loss of him, he had to be smarter than that. He had to hold his tongue.
A moan. He stayed perfectly still, and after a moment, he heard it again, soft and breathy. Oh god. Oh sweet Jesus,
It took him a moment to realize the back was empty except for another witch holding a pincushion. “Well, hello, dear,” the second witch said, smiling at him.
“Well, it was difficult. We didn’t have paperwork or anything, and didn’t know shit about living as muggles.” He laughed. “People would ask for my cell phone number and I had no idea what they were talking about. But one night at a club – like, a dance club – we met Dominic. He hired us on as waiters at the seafood place he owns. And we got to know him, and got to know the dancers, and well…here I am.”
Potter had bitten him hard enough to draw blood. “What the fuck,” he whispered to his reflection. His eyes looked big and scared, and he schooled his face into something a bit harder.
“No,” Astoria agreed. “You can’t. Even though we care about each other, we’re incapable of meeting one another’s needs. And that isn’t good. That’s not how it should be.”
Malfoy rolled his eyes. “Oh, please. No reason to go through with that anymore. I canceled on him this morning.”
. It’s only…well. I like to dance, sure. I’m having fun. But I’d rather just hang out with you. So if you don’t feel like dancing anymore, we can go. We should go.”
“Alright, alright. Next time I will,” Potter said. “And then you’ll probably be cursing me because you’ll be sleeping and I’ll accidentally wake you somehow.”
Linda loved her husband with all her heart, but he sometimes got stupid ideas in his head and, unfortunately for her, had enough money to turn them into a reality. A few years ago, it was the farmhouse and orchard he bought up in Michigan. It would be fun, he said, to be in the Midwest in the fall, to watch all the leaves turn, to eat apples off their own trees, to press fresh cider in the barn. Linda knew it would not be fun, but Greg dragged her up there anyway, and she spent a month with mosquito bites everywhere, swimming in the late summer humidity. Linda was stung by bees constantly (apparently, they really liked apple trees, and she tended to forget to look where she was stepping), and also got a mean case of poison ivy. By the time she flew home (six weeks before Greg flew home), she’d just about had it with Greg’s hairbrained schemes.
A rapid progression of different expressions crossed over Malfoy’s face. “You would want your son to spend time with mine?” he said, his voice carefully neutral. “I’d imagine they have little in common.”
Thankfully, it was pandemonium around them because the cast had just come back out for the curtain call. After a moment, Draco pulled away and appeared to collect himself, and then everybody was practically running out of the theatre like it was on fire.
“Gin,” he said. It would be very easy to kiss her right now. Part of him wanted to. He knew how she would taste, and how she would smell, like vanilla, and like the Burrow. He knew how she would feel in his arms, soft and hard in turns; her skin and her breasts soft and supple, the muscles of her legs and arms firm and toned. She wanted to kiss him, too. It was in her eyes, in the way she leaned towards him, pleading. He tucked a strand of her hair behind her ear, letting his fingers drag through the silky length of it. “I’m not going to pretend the last month didn’t happen. It
On top of the general melancholy that had enveloped Draco after his brief, post-coital haze faded, a strange sort of guilt was sweeping over him. It didn’t even make sense, given that Potter had made it clear there would be nothing more between them. And yet, there it was.
Four weeks in, and Draco was able to run faster and further, and he could swing a broadsword with some amount of control. It was different from fencing, the movements blunt and brutal, lacking finesse and elegance. Blows were meant to maim and kill rather than earn points. But the mindset was the same; watching your opponent for tells was the same. It was taking some getting used to, but Draco was managing.
Harry raised his head up a bit, fixing his bright eyes on Draco’s. Merlin, he was beautiful. “About when we broke up – or, sorry, when we stopped seeing each other?”
to patch things up. Lavender knew about his breakup with Ginny, generally, although thank Merlin she didn’t know the details. But she’d been good about it, dragging Harry everywhere with her in the aftermath, telling him he needed to get out more, meet new people.
Especially Draco, since he was carrying on with Draco regularly during that time. When he’d been with Ginny, they’d had that night at the pub in York, and then nearly a year with nothing. Then when it happened again, Harry’d ended things with Ginny the next time he saw her. “I thought you’d know. I thought you’d hear. And I thought you’d assume, since I wasn’t worried about cheating on her anymore.”
,” said Harry, his voice suddenly hard. Draco stopped dead in his tracks and turned, his face bright red now.
But more than that, he kept returning to the fact that the world was a pretty shite place if you thought about it, for all sorts of reasons. Because nothing worked out the way it should, and because people died, and because nothing was forever. Because you couldn’t save everyone, and because love got twisted up into horrible things, and fear and pride and hatred ruled people far more often than love anyway.
“Truth,” said Ron, nodding. He took a bite of chicken and groaned. “Merlin, Harry, this is so good. How do you do it?”
And gasped. Because there underneath Clarke’s dirty robes was the Time-Turner. Carefully, Draco picked it up and set it on top of the desk. It looked exactly like the sketches, like the scale in a healer’s office, but it was made of intricately embellished silver. The pieces that ran along the rows of numbers were gems: a ruby on the top row and a moonstone on the bottom.
Draco was only half listening. Taxation and local governance weren’t really his forte. Besides, his mind was on Lia’s report from earlier that morning. She said there’d been a disturbance in Evenwood Forest. A handful of people from one of the border towns had reported hearing a loud rumbling sound emanating from it about a week ago. One woman claimed that it sounded like the earth was being split in two. Of course, none of the townsfolk ventured into Evenwood to see what had happened, but Lia and a handful of her men had gone to investigate after the fact. “Nothing out of place,” she’d assured William.
Suddenly, Harry burst into the room. Technically, Aurors were not supposed to be gallivanting about on the ninth floor by themselves, but everyone made an exception for Harry, because of who he was, and also, because they knew he’d just slip in under the Invisibility Cloak if they tried to stop him (he had before, countless times). “I heard there was a Door –” he began, and then saw Kerrick. “Oh, hey! What’d I miss?”
Berold sighed, looking sorry that he asked, but William just laughed and clapped Frankie on the back.
Draco sighed heavily. “Goodbye, Pans. Enjoy doing whatever the hell it is that you do all day. And I love you, too.”
“Oh, sorry, sweetheart. Mummy’s just looking out for Harry’s reputation. It just won’t do for such a lovely, chaste thing to be alone with the likes of
“Sort of, I guess. It was always there, though, even when we pretended it wasn’t.” Almost a year had passed before anything happened between them again, but there were several close calls and many, many moments where Harry desperately wanted it to happen.
“For some fucking reason, my mother seems to enjoy you. But no, I think we probably ought to be wringing as much fun as we can out of our last couple of months at that shithole of a school.”
Draco nodded, and felt his chin jut out, the way it always used to when he was bracing himself for a blow (verbal or otherwise) from his father.
Harry was writhing, a bit, his back lifting up off the loveseat on occasion, and he was being quiet-ish, but he was making little breathy, panting noises, and suddenly Draco’s cock was so hard it hurt.
Harry shook his head. Hermione and Ron and Ginny all knew what Harry felt about Draco. He’d been telling them for months. And everyone else’s opinion didn’t matter to him. “Not weird at all.” He held out a hand.
Harry was so nervous as he walked into the coffee shop that he felt dizzy. His hands were damp and clammy, his mouth dry. He felt shaky and unsteady, and wished he’d met Draco for drinks instead, because at least then he’d have the reassuring embrace of alcohol to look forward to.
That night, he couldn’t even pretend to be okay. He rolled away from Charlie and shut his eyes against the questions he could tell Charlie wanted to ask.
“You can’t,” Harry said, giggling. “You can’t even pretend.” He hit Charlie with a quick cleaning spell and Charlie raised an eyebrow. Harry shrugged. Wandless really wasn’t difficult for him anymore, particularly with simple things.
Draco pressed in, overcome by the tight, wet heat against his cock, the sickly-sweet feel low in his belly, the tightening of his balls. “
“No, no one,” said Potter. “Everybody’s been really excited about it, actually. I think it makes people feel good, to think that all this shit we’ve been through may produce something positive.”
Draco couldn’t stop thinking about it. He hadn’t told anyone about the alley, not even Pansy, and he told her everything. But he didn’t know how to explain it, really, in a way that conveyed how it
She nodded and sat down opposite him and took out a book. Draco had learned a few things about Granger recently, one of which was that she carried a bag full of books with her at all times. Some of them were texts related to her work projects, but some were, allegedly, ‘for fun’. If you considered ‘A Concise History of Squibs and Unusual Magical Genealogy’ fun, anyway, which Granger apparently did.
Cheap. Pah. Draco mentally cursed Weasley and everyone else on a budget. The beds better be acceptably soft or he was going to find out how to get to The Chrysalis, where his mother and father always stayed. “Ah,” he said.
In the end, he tried all three. None of them worked, and slowly, through the split in his curtains, Draco saw that the sun was rising. He sighed and got out of bed. Time to face another day without any sleep whatsoever. Pre-war Draco, who moaned and carried on about getting anything less than eight hours, would be appalled. Post-war Draco thought this was just more of the same old shit, and planned to transfigure his morning tea into coffee. Espresso, maybe. And then he’d hopefully pass out tonight at eight p.m.
Harry wanted to jump on him, honestly. Snog the shite out of him. He had no idea what Draco was thinking, though. “I’m proud of you.”
“Not much of a choice,” said Malfoy, grimacing. “Not when everyone there would love to see me hurt. Would love to see me brought low.”
The wedding was to take place at Lughnasadh, the day of the harvest celebration. They were doing it the old way, which was totally unlike any wedding Harry’d ever seen. Everyone in attendance (which was family and close friends only) had to wear white Druidic-style robes with a wreath of green leaves in their hair, except for Harry and Draco, who wore wildflowers instead. Draco picked the flowers and wove the crowns – they had to be certain types and in a certain order, and Harry didn’t understand any of it – and cast stasis charms on them. The ceremony was at dusk on the shore of the the sparkling lake beside the castle.
“There you are,” Nott said. “Sorry about all this. I told them to let me deal with you, but you know how men like Yuri are. Any excuse to get their hands dirty, you know? He’s a vile bastard, if you ask me.” Nott sat down in a chair that had appeared at some point in front of Draco’s and leaned forward, peering at Draco’s chest.
But maybe he’d go. So far, he and Euri had only spent time together alone. It might be good to go out and socialize with him. Besides, Harry was a bit curious about where Pansy Parkinson lived. It was probably posh as hell.
“Yeah, it was grand,” he says. He’s wearing a gauzy, silver shirt that should look ridiculous on him but doesn't. It’s patently absurd, but god, you’d like to touch it. “How was yours?”
“Humph,” said Draco. “Shows what you know.” He stole a quick glance at Katie’s table and saw, to his satisfaction, that she was looking over at Potter. He couldn’t read her expression, though. She wasn’t, now that he thought about it, a very expressive person.
“One, that doesn’t scare me. Astoria and my friends know, and I don’t care what anyone else thinks of me. And I might be ruined politically, but you would be, too, so I would hardly even care. The reason I’m running at all is so that you never, ever get to call yourself the Minister of Magic. And two, I’m not bluffing. I’ll do it. I swear on the graves of my ancestors. Do I make myself clear?”
He dropped Harry’s hand and curled up onto his side so that he was facing Harry’s stomach, his head shifting against Harry’s very hard cock. He yawned. “Goodnight, Potter,” he said, and fell asleep. Within a minute, he was snoring softly.
The irony wasn’t lost on Draco as he watched a pair of red-robed Aurors haul Lucius up from his chair and cast an
“Mm?” said Draco, his mouth still on Niran’s. He was sneaking a hand up Niran’s shirt to feel his stomach. Just a little. It was probably okay.
“Sure, why not. Denial it is,” Pansy said, downing the rest of her espresso. “How do you feel, then?”
“Harry…” Draco said, biting his lip. He looked so unlike himself, then, all the swagger and arrogance gone suddenly, as though it had been vanished along with the crystal. He looked…terrified. Harry hated it, and wanted to make sure it went away and never, ever came back. He wanted nothing more than to kiss Draco, to show him how he felt, and what he wanted, to kiss him until that look was completely gone, but he couldn’t, not yet.
Ron nodded. “I think Robards never sent you because…well, because he thought it might hit too close to home.”
But of course it was one thing to feel that way and another to be looking at it from Harry’s perspective. And from Harry’s perspective, Draco’s marriage was front-and-center, and Harry was on the outside looking in. And that wasn’t fair to Harry, was it? It probably felt rather horrible.
“Good on you!” Draco said, clapping a hand on his shoulder. “It’s excellent that you’re working on your mental health. When you’re done sorting out what’s wrong with
At low tide, it was impossible to reach the entrance at all; the stone stairs that led to it were too high above the water. As the tide was moving in, it was too dangerous; the waves were brutal along that part of the coast, and it was too likely that a boat would be smashed against the rock. The only time, according to Berold, that it was possible to access the passage was when the tide was just beginning to go out, while the water level was still high, but the waves were not so intense. It was still going to be a crapshoot, even if they timed it perfectly.
“You’re mad,” Harry said. Honestly, what the fuck? How could he stay with her? How in Merlin’s name could he stay with her and live with her when he knew what she’d done?
The other voice started droning on about...something. Harry wasn't quite sure what. The violently lime green colour of the man's robes was horribly distracting and the man sounded an awful lot like Professor Binns.
“What’s got your knickers in a twist?” Harry mused, glancing up from his copy of Quidditch Quarterly.
“Booyah!” Draco yelled, throwing up his hands in celebration and adding in a little hip wiggle for good measure. The line of kids behind him groaned as he turned back to the machine, ready to level up. “What,” he asked, throwing a sneer over his shoulder, though his eyes were playful, “you jelly?”
Noise. There was so much noise. Harry's brain couldn't figure out what to focus on. It all sounded like a great big jumble of sounds. Logically, he knew that he was in the spell damage ward of St Mungos with Healers darting in and out of the room, but nothing else was registering.
Draco’s quill flew over the parchment in a blur. Harry thought it best to leave his boyfriend to it and went back to his magazine until half an hour later when he looked back up and saw a veritable mountain of crumpled parchment and arithmancy books scattered around the man whose normally pristine hair was nearly standing on end with how much he’d been pulling at it.
Harry sighed and sat back on his heels. “Look, love, I fucking hate networking. I’m only likeable because I’m the damned ‘Chosen One’. If you want help with this, go ask a Hufflepuff. Now, do you want to keep complaining about it or would you like me to get back to the blow job?”
“Come on, old man,” one of the braver kids taunted, “you’ve been at it for ages, let someone else have a turn!”
“Could have fooled me,” I drawl, downing the rest of my drink. “You talk about him constantly. Never shut up, in fact.”
