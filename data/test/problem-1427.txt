Harry smiled to himself at Hermione’s comment.  He had been one of those drunks she talked about. “Whatever you want Mione.”
“I know I should have done better.  I should have been stronger.  But I was alone.  Your mother’s sisters were of no help.  And my family . . .”  He laughed humorlessly.  “I think they reveled in our misfortune.  I tried to make it up to you.”
Pansy Parkinson abruptly appeared at their table, wearing a smile and a very low-cut blouse.  The four Gryffindors all stared, wondering what she could possibly be doing there.
“So, what now?” Harry finally asked, hoping Draco would have some brilliant insight.  But he simply shrugged.  “Do you think it’s chance that we keep ending up together every Friday night? Or something more?”
Harry sighed.  “Do you really have to call him that?  He’s left us alone since I had that talk with him.  And he even said he’s meeting other friends.”
“But they’ve been together forever,” smirked Draco. “And babies seem to be the Weasley way.  It doesn’t have to be our way.  Not yet anyway.”
“You had just turned four.  And I did read to you, nearly every night.  But I suppose you were too young to remember it.  I was pregnant.  Very pregnant.  I was having difficulty sleeping at night and was exhausted during the day.  My healer prescribed a potion.”  She paused.  “The apothecary had made a mistake in brewing it. I, along with several others, became ill from the poisoned potion.  I lost the baby.”
“I’m sorry. It had to be done. I should have done it right away. Now I have to get you warmed up somehow.”
Draco scratched his head, unsure whether or not she was serious. After a moment, he shrugged and sat down in the chair vacated by Hermione.
“I have a better idea,” Draco said.  “Let’s keep it to ourselves and talk it out on holiday. Then we’ll know what we want to do before we talk to anyone else.”
Harry had to admit he was disappointed.  It was much more fun goading Malfoy now that he was relatively certain he wouldn’t get hexed for it.  He never realized that the Slytherin had much of a sense of humor.  But the small grin on Draco’s lips told Harry that he knew the brunette was only playing.
Snogging and groping, they waited for the water to warm then stepped in the shower. Draco turned Harry around to better reach his arse.  Harry widened his stance in response. Reaching for the special oil they kept in the shower for such occasions, Draco generously coated his fingers. He poked one inside Harry while his other hand ran over the mound of smooth flesh of Harry’s bottom.
Hermione drew in a breath to retort Ron’s sarcastic remark.  But he kissed her before she could utter a word.
Draco resumed sliding up and down, while Harry stroked him in the same rhythm.  Gazing at one another, they each sped up their actions, reading the unspoken need of the other.
“I dropped it in the woods somewhere.  I purposely didn’t take note of where.  Dumbledore was the only one, besides Ron and Hermione, that knew I had it,” Harry admitted.
Harry smiled.  “Spectacular.  Good word.”  He rolled over half on top of Draco and rested his head on Draco’s shoulder. “Maybe a few more minutes before we get up.”
“Stupid fuck,” Harry said aloud to his mirror as he began to change for bed.  “Draco would never pick you, you stupid git.  Who in their right mind would want someone who nearly killed him?”
He straightened his shirt and pulled his jeans up a little higher.  He didn’t have time to make himself more presentable and it was killing him.  When he opened the door, Harry appeared a little put out.
“Today’s class is strictly potion making. We have a double period, so you’ll have plenty of time.  If you’ve taken proper notes, this potion will go smoothly.  If not,” he glanced at Casper Montague.  “Warn your neighbor.  Or better yet, ask for help.”
She winked away leaving Harry alone with his new . . .  Harry wondered how to refer to Narcissa.  She wasn’t precisely his mother-in-law, but he supposed it was probably the best way to describe their relationship.
“I’m sure my father has been droning on about microwaves or sewing machines, or some other muggle device he’s obsessed with,” Ron shook his head.
“You look . . . so handsome,” Harry said, sounding somewhat star struck.  “Not that you don’t always, but . . .”
“Why don’t we wait to find out for sure before we go making any more plans,” Ginny suggested.  “We should go to St. Mungo’s as soon as possible.”
“We talked.”  Catching the look exchanged between his two best friends, Harry continued.  “That’s all we did.  It was really nice.  We just talked. And maybe shared a bit of firewhiskey.  But I’m not drunk,” he quickly added.
Equally uncomfortable, Ginny replied, “Yes. I’m embarrassed to say that Dean and I are unexpectedly . . . expecting.”
“You know I have.  I admit, for a while, I enjoyed being a hero.  That is to say, I enjoyed helping people, not necessarily the celebrity that went along with it.  That was why I became an Auror in the first place. I felt almost obligated to play the paragon.  But that wasn’t who I really am.  I’m really just a man who wants a simple life, and a job helping people.  In this case, children.”
“Weird.” Harry threw the towel on the back of a chair and quickly ran his fingers through his hair to comb it.
Ginny placed a hand on Harry’s arm.  “This isn’t about me, though.  I want to know how you’re feeling?”
“I think it’s a wonderful idea,” Andromeda spoke up. “And a wonderful way to continue the Black and Potter families.”  She deliberately left out the Malfoy name. “And, to keep the flower theme going,” she winked.
After sending off the note, the two men decided to go once again to the Leaky Cauldron.  Harry also managed to persuade Draco to stop at a sweet shop on the way.  The blond himself didn’t have a sweet tooth, but Harry had a craving for chocoballs.
James perked up at his grandmother’s defense of him.  “I’ll catch a frog for you, Grandmama,” James smiled.
Upon returning to his own room, Draco walked to the fireplace several times before finally grabbing a handful of floo powder.  He floo called the only person he could think of who might be willing to help him where Harry was concerned.
Giggling in a most unmanly manner, Harry pushed him back.  “Oh, no you don’t.  I’ve already got one glamour on me.”
“Right you are.  Pasta goes straight to my waist,” Draco said rubbing his belly. “We’ll have to do something to work it off.”
Stretching and yawning, Harry woke gently from a pleasant dream. The morning sun was streaming through the window and Harry felt refreshed and well rested.  Though he had been hoping the night before would end with some sort of physical gratification, Harry was surprised that he found falling asleep in Draco’s arms nearly as fulfilling.
By the flickering light, Harry could see that the room was different from the way Slughorn used to keep it.  Not quite completely Slytherin, there were touches of green.  Rich, forest colored curtains hung in the window and through an archway he could see a duvet of mostly silver satin with a paisley green pattern covered his bed.  The furniture was simpler than Slughorn’s, more modern and sleeker.  And though Draco had cleaned out and organized the Potions office down in the dungeons, he still kept a personal ingredient cupboard in his room.
“Hermione overheard you talking to Charlie at Christmas.  You said you wanted a pair, but dragon skin items were so hard to come by these days.”
The school year got off to a busy start and November seemed to arrive quickly.  The new Charms professor was a woman who taught at Beauxbatons for twenty-six years before moving to Hogwarts for a change of pace. Draco had remembered her from his days of student teaching, but didn’t know her well.  Harry was just thankful that the new professor was a woman, with no designs on either of them.
“I still can’t figure out how you managed to be the first one to ask her to the dance when you waited so long to do so,” Draco commented.
Draco smiled. “Thank you.  But as I told Harry, I didn’t have the best role model.  And babysitting for an hour or two hardly compares to the daily chores of parenting.”
“Draco, you need to read the whole thing,” Harry said. “And it’s not as if I came out looking like an angel.  I was honest, and it wasn’t always flattering.  But I’m glad I did the interview.”
“I’m the one who offered to babysit. I didn’t expect you to do it,” Harry said. “She’s still fussy.  Maybe she’s hungry again.  I’ll get a bottle.”
Pursing his lips, Ron replied, “I have to admit, you are happier than I’ve seen you in a long time.  If it’s his doing, then, yes I’m encouraging it.”
When Draco pulled back, he was horrified to find the expression on Harry’s face was one of shock, not pleasure.  There was an excruciatingly long pause before he could speak.
“As reported by me in yesterday’s Prophet, you have been seen in the company of Draco Malfoy, a Death Eater, in a compromising position.  Would you care to comment on that?”
“I think he’s in the garden picking some flowers for your room.”  The child clamped a hand over her mouth and gasped.  “Now it won’t be a surprise.”
“However,” she went on.  “I can’t say that I am thrilled with the state I found the pair of you in this morning.”
He waited in silence until he saw Malfoy walk to the railing and look up.  Stay hidden or reveal himself?  Harry knew he had to decide quickly.  Once he was hidden for too long, he’d have to stay that way until Malfoy left.  He stepped out of the shadows and cleared his throat.
"It doesn't change who I am, either," he said quietly. "Incarcerous." Draco's eyes grew wide as thin ropes suddenly flew from Harry's wand, wrapping themselves snakelike around his arms and chest. Harry took a deep breath, unable to avoid the inevitable any longer.
He was selfishly letting his eyes roam over Potter again one last time, committing his naked form to memory when his eyes froze. Potter was still -
"Don't you dare," Malfoy growled, changing his position and pointing his hand in Harry's face so quickly Harry had nearly dropped both the vials and his wand. "Don't tell me you're fucking sorry, Potter." He spat, looking crazier than Harry had ever seen. "I've never been sorry about your idiot parents, have I? Or your pathetic godfather? Or that disgusting werew-"
If the Dark Lord decided to burst through the wall and kill Draco right now, he would at least be able to say he died happily.
They caught each other's heated, shocked eyes and Draco held onto the gaze as he slowly ground his hips forward.
His hands crept up Draco's back, hooking over his shoulders from behind, using the leverage to sit up. His cock nearly slipped out as Draco, taller than him by an inch, now had to straddle Harry's lap upright. They stayed that way for only a few seconds before Harry was pushing Draco onto his back. He spread Draco's thighs apart, kneeling between them as he pushed his cock back inside completely, making them both gasp. Draco's hips came up to meet his, gripping Harry's biceps as they began to rock together.
"I enjoy my privacy, thank you. Which, speaking of," he drawled, waving his hand again and the taps to a large soaking tub came on. "I'll be needing momentarily, Potter." Harry wished he could slip away through the floor and forget this day had ever existed.
"It's fine. I've known it for years," he said finally with a small sniff, gracefully wiping his long fingers over his tear stained cheeks. Harry forced himself to focus.
He felt his heart swelling, his emotions beginning to overwhelm him. Harry had been destined to kill The Dark Lord for much, much longer than Draco had been to Dumbledore. And yet Harry was always still kind, still caring - still so strong through all he had endured. One would never know from talking to him that half the Wizarding World was counting on him to be their savior. He couldn't understand it. He knew what that pressure was like, now; he had the entire Dark side expecting him to do something he wasn't sure he was even capable of. And where Harry was a pillar of strength, he was a crumbling ruin, soon to fall apart for good any day now.
he said, and unbuttoned the first four buttons on his most likely very expensive black shirt, pulling it apart to show her part of his pale chest, partially revealing the curve of a long, shiny scar. She gasped.
“No,” she said, exhaling as well and expertly flicking the first ash that had formed. “I’m staying the weekend with a friend who has a flat on the west side. He’s inside with his boyfriend on the floor – they’ve been at it dancing all night.” She smiled, taking another drag of her cigarette and looking Malfoy up and down. “X.” she stated, rolling her eyes about it, and Malfoy nodded in understanding while Harry felt stupidly oblivious.
“Scared?” Malfoy said, noting the obvious look of trepidation on Harry’s face, taunting him as if they were still small school children.
“What –” he started to ask Ron, but Ron just gave him the drunk version of his ‘I have no idea’ face.
"Ohgodohgodoh-" Harry chanted as he watched his cock disappear inch by inch into Malfoy's hot, eager mouth. Draco pulled back after meeting wet curls, his cheeks hollowed from sucking as he went. He stopped at the head, continuing to suck and swirl his tongue around it, purposely tormenting the brunette. Both hands were back in his hair again and Draco forcefully held his hips back, preventing him from bucking. "
"Say you don't want this. Tell me you don't want to know what it'd be like. Say it and I'll leave, Potter."
"Mother, no," Draco said, unfreezing himself from the wall and stepping between them. "We were - I was - Harry was searching the house and found these." Harry looked wildly down at the vials he was still holding. Narcissa's expression became unreadable, and Harry realized it wasn't just Lucius who had raised Draco that way.
"Draco," he panted, watching Draco's eyes refocus on his from somewhere far away. "Please, Draco, just let go." It was like Harry had figured out Draco's very own passphrase, opening the wall Draco had been hiding behind. He was suddenly wrapping his legs around Harry's waist and running his free hand through his wild, jet black hair, damp from sweat.
He had let out quite a bit of pent-up aggression in the air. He was soaked in his sweat, his white cotton shirt stuck to his back. The dust from the Room of Requirement that had clung to his cloak now felt caked onto his skin. He looked at the clock on the wall of the changing room as he entered - 9:46pm. 14 minutes. He put his broom away while deciding that a shower would feel much better than any cleaning charm would.
"I think you have," Draco gently pushed Harry's wand arm down, and Harry let him. Draco's hands found Harry's shoulders and he slowly pushed off the thick robe. It fell in the shape of a half circle on the marble floor. Harry felt Draco's palms reappear on his chest. He trailed long, delicate fingers down over the material, stopping at the waistband of Harry's jeans.
He was very aware that Harry was intently watching him. He suspected it was because Harry was either still suspicious of him or expected him to get cold feet and change his mind - or both, regardless of the fact that they had just intimately showered together after mutual mind-blowing orgasms.
Malfoy blinked at him, licking his lips and Harry, entranced by it, couldn’t stop himself from slowly stepping closer again, praying to whoever would listen that something, someone,
"Don't worry about it," Harry said, and for a second Draco blanched, intensely worried that Harry was able to read his mind until he saw Harry look at the clock.
"You - I - you're not really, you don't actually - it's just lust, just lust clouding your mind. You can't, you don't -" Harry was pretty sure he had just broken something inside of Draco.
Ginny smiled at Harry when he came in, hands on either side of her large, round belly, and Harry felt his chest burn horribly with guilt.
"I'm famished," he said dramatically, rolling over and gracefully leaping out of his bed. Harry slowly sat up, swinging his legs over the side of the bed without half the grace Draco had just displayed. He watched him walk to the closet. Harry picked up his clothes off the floor and began to pull them on. "All I had yesterday before you showed up was a slice of gruyere and half a glass of firewhiskey."
“No – really – what’s –” and she stopped when she saw Ginny’s face, realizing that her sister-in-law had let her very drunk husband name their second child.
Harry had said the name most feared in their world with such ease. He was so brave, so brilliant. So
"H - how did you get in here?" he asked the ghostly figure of The Bloody Baron, instantly thinking he was rather stupid for doing so. From the look on The Baron's face, he thought the same.
“What were you playing at with her anyway, Malfoy?” Harry said quietly, exhaling smoke, his eyes watching the girl and her friends disappear through the dwindled crowd back into the bar. “You’re married, right?”
, Harry?" he said, the second use of his name still making him feel like he was speaking some undiscovered ancient language. "Say it."
"Draco," Harry said, his voice hoarse. Draco snapped his gaze back up to Harry's face. "I'll - I'll c- come if you keep -"
Potter wanking in there? What if he was even crazier than he originally thought for just automatically assuming that it
"I said I don't want your apologies, Potter," he growled into Harry's ear, rocking his hips into him. Harry groaned as their cocks pressed together again. He caught sight of the fading scar of the Dark Mark still visible on Draco's left forearm and decided he had gone completely insane. "Beg me, Harry," Draco whispered, and Harry obliged.
He wasn't sure how long they stayed that way or how long they spent bathing together. He wasn't sure what time it was, late night or very early morning when they slowly made their way back to Draco's bed, pausing only briefly on the way to grab his things in the hand Draco wasn't holding. He wasn't sure how long he lay awake curled up against him, listening to his steady breathing deepen with sleep. Harry could see the expansive windows beyond the rise and fall of Draco's back, and he watched the sky start to lighten.
Was he actually going to allow this opportunity to pass him by? That meant he would never know how Potter would
Should he ring the bell? Knock politely? Pound on the door with one fist and threateningly shout, 'Auror Department, open up!'? He decided against a barbaric approach and proceeded to knock somewhat politely on the door. So far, the only lead he and Ron had discovered was that the Malfoys had probably fled the country after the battle nearly six months ago, possibly to stay with extended family somewhere in Germany. The Malfoy case had certainly taken less precedence over some of the more pertinent ones, such as that of the whereabouts of Fenrir Greyback. Harry shuddered, mostly over the fact that they had not yet caught the murderous werewolf and partially over the chilly November air. He knocked again, harder. He was not exactly sure what he was expecting, or why he was knocking on the door of a mansion whose former residents had most likely just went on permanent holiday. They had only just been granted permission for search and seizure from Kingsley three days ago, to which Harry and Ron had been assigned to act upon by  their direct superior.
Sighing, Draco complied. "My father, Lucius Abraxas Malfoy, is dead." Malfoy's palm was still pressed against where the paint chip would have been as the wall disappeared at his words.
react. Sure, his imagination had run wild many times, but nothing would ever compare to experiencing the real thing.
Malfoy finished his cigarette, scrubbing it out on the brick next to him, sending a shower of orange embers dying slowly to the ground.
"Coming after this, Potter?" he sneered. Harry's heart had jumped from his stomach into his throat, and he gulped down heavily. "You know," Draco drawled, "You really ought to have been trained more. You're still just as stupid as you were before they inducted you into the force."
That was definitely not a hex, nor did it seem like any semblance of the word "no", and before Draco woke up from this alternate reality where life was suddenly being kind to him again, he pushed his tongue past soft lips.
As soon as Harry was well out of sight, Draco's knees hit the stone floor hard. The pain he felt was nothing compared to the state of his heart.
He was thankful she spent so much time in the library. The common room was fairly empty; Fridays meant most students were all out enjoying their wonderful, happy lives with friends or significant others in Hogsmeade.
But Harry saw the shelves, filled with rows upon rows of vials, containing what Harry assumed to be extremely damning evidence against Lucius Malfoy. He cautiously picked one up and read the label:
was, at least. For all he knew, Harry might've received plenty of head from plenty of others and thought Draco was utterly shit at it.
Mesmerized, Harry quickly pushed Draco, whose hand was still tangled in the dark mess of his hair, until his back was flat against the wall once more, this time grinding his hips into him and desperately trying to hold back a deep groan. Draco inhaled sharply and worried his bottom lip between his perfectly straight, white teeth to keep himself from moaning. Their mouths crashed together again, knocking the left arm of Harry's glasses off his ear from the sheer force of it. He ground his hard cock into Draco's, both still covered by too many layers of offending fabric. Draco's hips arched off the wall to meet Harry's slow grind, and he was panting quickly into Harry's mouth through the gaps in their heated kiss. The memory vials nearly slipped out of Harry's now sweaty left hand and he pressed his fist into the wall behind Draco's right ear, holding himself steady as his hips increased their pace.
In the waiting silence, Harry’s eyes, impossibly green and slightly glazed, focused hard on the innocent looking little glass on the table in front of him.
"Don't -" he gasped, running his palm flat back up over it. If Harry decided to let this go any further, he wanted to make sure it had nothing to do with guilt. "Don't feel
Harry's brain reeled. He assumed it would have been Draco's nature to dominate Harry, to take him, use him, and Harry had been prepared to let that happen. But there Draco was, knees digging into either side of Harry's hips, fingering himself for him. For Harry.
Draco reflected as he silently observed. He'd known for nearly a year now that he needed to approach Harry. There were apologies and explanations he needed to give. He'd tried since the start of term, but each time he was gripped by fear and fell back into the same old patterns of rivalry. Tonight was no different. Draco still couldn't face him, especially not now, while the Gryffindor was injured and cursing the world.
It was as if they were standing on a carpet made of flowers rather than a field. They looked almost like roses but were a beautiful lilac colour. The sight of them in the setting sun took Harry's breath away.
On Christmas Eve, in a forest of evergreens, surrounded by their closest family and friends, Harry and Draco were married under the clearest starry sky any of them had ever seen. The lights that decorated the trees created an ethereal glow, surrounding the couple with beauty and wonder.
Sobs wracked his body as he curled into himself, unable to say or do anything further. His screams and cries of sorrow echoed through the garden as he grieved every loss and regret buried within his soul.
After six months, I was finally able to update the story! In the process, I decided to go back and edit the chapters. Chapter one has been updated as of 10/5/2021, and hopefully, the rest will follow soon!
Harry put up his hand, “No, he didn’t betray my parents. Don’t ask. We can talk about that another time. Now, are you going to let me tell the story?”
Draco moved to a nearby alley and called softly for Kreacher. When the elf appeared moments later, Draco was grateful to see that he was already looking much better; he still looked old and worn down, but at least he was clean and wearing a fresh pillowcase.
“Alright, calm down,” Harry laughed, “You’re as mean, nasty, and ferocious as a dragon. There’s nothing adorable about you at all.” The cat huffed and returned to his task, evidently satisfied with Harry’s answer. Shaking his head again, Harry went to sit on the sofa. After a few minutes, the cat came and sat next to him. Unable to resist, Harry began gently stroking the soft fur, refusing to think about the fact that he was petting Draco Malfoy, even in cat form.
Severus Snape was sitting in his office, drowning his bitterness in firewhisky, when he heard a knock at the door. He promptly ignored it as he poured himself another glass. After another minute or two, the person outside knocked again, this time louder, as though agitated. As though he cared.
Most impressive though was the eagle painted next to it, which was large and incredibly lifelike. Harry blinked and jumped back a bit when the eagle moved, ruffling its feathers and tilting its head back and forth.
Harry has destroyed the Howler and Draco has been humiliated in front of the entire school. Tides begin to turn, plans are made, and relationships begin to evolve.
Lastly, on a lighter note, I wanted to let everyone know the next chapter will be relatively short. I don't know about you, but I really want to see what Narcissa is going to say to the Dursleys :) after that, finally, we're off to Hogwarts!
It was different for every couple: a tattoo of a name or a phrase, the appearance of a compass, the ability to communicate through dreams, a pull or tug, and so many others.
From that night on, they wrote to each other constantly. Harry had decided to keep his new friendship with Draco a secret, though Draco had said he could tell anyone he trusted. Harry didn't want to take any chances or deal with any judgment. He told Ron and Hermione he had been listening to a muggle TV program one day when someone said that journaling was an excellent way to control your emotions. Ron had shrugged indifferently, and Hermione had praised him for his initiative. Neither questioned him after that.
Draco's relationship with his mother evolves. Draco and Harry meet in Diagon Alley, and this time Draco is determined to do things right.
Cushioned though it was, the landing was still somewhat rough, and Umbridge collapsed into a heap on the floor.
Harry was taken aback by the random question, “Erm...two years or so. I should have had them earlier but my Aunt and Uncle…” Harry paused. He wasn’t quite ready to talk about that yet. Thankfully, Draco didn’t question, and just focused on Harry’s current glasses.
Harry jumped up and ran towards the voice, forgetting his pain completely. He reached Draco in moments, sweeping him into a fierce hug. As their eyes met, they kissed with such love and passion that the field could have burst into flames and they wouldn't have noticed. When they were forced to break for air, Harry leaned his head into Draco's shoulder, inhaling his scent and revelling in the warmth and comfort of his arms.
“Really, Draco. It’s not that big a deal.” Harry responded, trying to convince both himself and the increasingly irate blond. Truthfully, Olivander had frightened Harry a great deal with that creepy speech, but he wasn’t about to admit that to Draco.
Putting aside the onslaught of emotions for the time, Draco focused on the man in front of him. "Who are you?"
When they arrived at the designated wall on the seventh floor, Umbridge turned to him, her already large face swelling with rage, “Ahem. I do hope you have not deceived me, Mr. Malfoy. Such trickery would be very unwise on your part.
Feeling curiously calm, Draco moved to the bench as well. “So,” he began, “where do we go when we die then?”
Harry must have seen something in his face because he began to look concerned. “What are you going to do?”
Realization dawned on him, “Draco, what have you done?” he asked softly, already suspecting the answer. The cat looked at him with wide and innocent eyes. “Oh no you don’t,” Harry said sternly, “that is not going to work on me. You tell me what you’ve done right now.”
he thought angrily. Though his body was free from the pain of his injuries, the memories were still fresh.  He hated himself for it, but he couldn’t help the grief that welled up in his chest. As tears began to stream down his face, Draco was struck by an impulse. He needed to talk to someone.
"What is he up to?" he wondered aloud as he followed the note's instructions. Inside was a plain white box. When Harry opened it, he was surprised to see nothing more than a tree branch.
Things are changing without Umbridge around. A relationship begins to evolve, leading to an unexpected confrontation.
After a few moments, Dobby began to speak, voice still trembling slightly with emotion, “Kreacher is being not well and was very upset at Dobby. Kreacher made to attack Dobby and chased Dobby all over the disgraceful house. Dobby was finally being able to calm Kreacher and explain about young Master. Kreacher is to be allowing us inside.”
It was a seemingly random branch, but there was a note beside it. Reading the note gave him the explanation; the branch was a portkey to a small island, unplottable to wizards and unreachable by muggles. The Potter family had many estates and properties, but his mother had chosen this one specifically for him, because of its beauty and seclusion.
In between sending letters and making arrangements for his move, Harry spent hours of each day exploring. After years of fighting for his life and dealing with fame, scrutiny, and hatred, he knew this was exactly what he needed. It was a breath of fresh air; absolute freedom.
Harry shook his head briefly, “You’re outspoken and you don’t think when you get angry, but so what? You’ve treated me better than anyone I’ve ever known.”
“I’m sorry Dray,” Harry whispered into Draco’s ear, “I know this isn’t your kind of thing. I shouldn’t have laughed when you fell. You were just so adorable with that petulant look on your face, I couldn’t help it. If you want to go back, we can.” Harry paused, continuing in a sultry tone, “However,” kissing Draco’s ear lightly, “the destination I had in mind is just a bit further. If we keep going, I promise, it’ll be worth it.
As Draco finished shouting, he unclenched his fists and let out a heavy breath. He jerked up his head and stared at Harry, as though suddenly remembering where he was. Harry could see the panic in his eyes but was highly suspicious of Draco’s phrasing.
No longer afraid, Harry rushed down the stairs and through the corridor, coming to a complete stop in the doorway.
” he sneered as he corrected Dobby, “was healing Young Master, but Dobby would not stop his whimpering long enough to notice that Young Master’s wounds were being better.”
Snarlworth informed him that when he’d turned 17, he’d inherited the Potter Family vaults, including a special vault that had been set aside by his mother and father. The money in the Potter vaults was of little interest to him, and he made a note to come back and look at the heirlooms and things his ancestors had left behind, but it was the vault his parents had set aside that interested him most.
With a small amount of hesitation, Harry nodded. Draco reached into his robe and pulled out a miniature pack. He enlarged the pack and explained that it was a medical kit. Harry looked surprised until Draco explained that every Slytherin carries one for emergencies. From the pack he pulled out a small silver bowl, a bottle of water with a permanent warming charm, an ointment to prevent infection, an ointment to ease pain, clean cloths, gauze, and a wrap. Most of the items were self-explanatory. Harry only asked for clarification on the ointments because they weren't labelled.
“Very well then,” Healer Edwards said, clapping his hands together. Let's get you back to the exam room and see what we are working with here.”
Harry grinned, stroking Draco’s hair, relieved that his boyfriend hadn’t fled. “No Draco,” he answered softly, “The Devas carried them to their families. The Devas can speak into the minds of humans, though they are invisible to the naked eye. They used this power to send images of what had befallen the lovers. Guilt and despair filled the hearts of the people, and it was determined by all that the war should end. Talks began, and soon enough peace was achieved. The lovers were buried together in a shrine that borders both lands.”
“Yeah, I get what you mean. Honestly, though, that’s kind of a relief. Maybe I’m not that far behind,” Harry said, his tone and posture more relaxed than before.
“Alright there you two?” Hagrid boomed, effectively breaking the strangely intense moment. Draco’s hand dropped from Harry’s shoulder and they both nodded. Hagrid had left to get Harry an owl for his birthday and had just returned.
“Shhh! Dobby!” interrupting the near-hysterical elf, “You have to calm down. Someone could walk by!” taking a deep breath, “Now, tell me what happened.”
"That bloody bint, Umbridge! She made me write lines with a blood quill!" He began to pace back and forth in his rage and frustration, "I must not tell lies! What a load of bollocks! I am so bloody sick of this! Every blasted year it's something! I'm the Boy-Who-Lived, I'm the Heir of Slytherin, I'm targeted by a traitor, I put my name in the Goblet of fire, and now I'm an insane liar who seeks attention! As if I wanted my parents murdered!" His voice began to crack, tears streaming down his face, but he continued as though he didn't notice or care that he was crying for the first time in years, "As if I wanted to be raised by people who think I'm worthless! As if I wanted to be targeted every year by a madman! As if I wanted to be the one who brought him back to life and watch Cedric get murdered! I didn't want any of this! I'm either a saint or evil, and
From behind him, he heard Draco growl in frustration. When Harry turned towards him, he realized that Draco was much more than frustrated. Draco was furious. He had his hands at his sides and was looking at Hagrid’s retreating figure with fire in his eyes.
“How long has this been going on?” Draco asked, filled with dread as he remembered Harry’s earlier reaction.
Gently, he pulled Harry by the hand and led him over to the sofa and handed him a cup of tea he’d brought with him.
“Hmm, alright then,” Healer Edwards said, letting the matter drop, “Well, I could fix these if you want, but I would prefer you get something a little more sturdy, not to mention better fitting.” Healer Edwards paused, thinking for a moment, “Unless you would prefer to correct your eyesight?”
The elves started to bicker again, but Draco interrupted them before it became too heated, “Thank you,” he said roughly, “you two may go now. My wounds are healed, and I would like to be alone.” As Dobby’s eyes grew wide with tears, Draco braced himself for frantic objections. Before Dobby could say a word, however, Kreacher once again wrapped his arm securely around Dobby’s head and clapped his hand over his mouth. He nodded respectfully at Draco before apparating them both out.
Sensing Harry’s worry, Dr. Edwards replied, “Not to worry, my boy. It’s a simple set of spells on your eyes as well as the glasses you currently have. It will give me all of the information I need.
Draco pulled away just long enough to slip the ring on Harry's finger before he burst into laughter, knocking his now fiancé into the ground, pressing soft kisses all over his face.
“That’s brilliant!” Harry exclaimed, thinking of the darkness of his cupboard. He had Dudley’s second room now, but who knew how long that would last. Now, he wouldn’t feel so afraid if they locked him away again; he would at least be able to see.
As he locked eyes with Harry, Draco noted that shock and bewilderment were plastered all over the Gryffindor’s face. Of course, he’d known it would be a bit of a shock. It was a rather bold move, particularly for a Slytherin.
Rather than answer, Harry walked over to the toad, who was still trying to move towards the door. He focused on summoning a fish tank to the room, set up properly for a toad, and charmed so that things could be put in, but not removed by anyone other than Harry or Draco. When it appeared, Harry used his wand to levitate the toad before dropping her in.
Suddenly, he remembered what Sirius had told him when Harry had first confided in him."We've all got both light and dark inside us. What matters is the part we choose to act on...that's who we really are."
Draco nearly jumped out of his skin when he heard the pop of apparition next to him. A few moments later, the air shimmered as Kreacher came into view, having turned himself invisible. When Draco saw that Kreacher was holding a small brown pouch in his hand, he was so excited he could have cheered, “Thank you, Kreacher!” he exclaimed, “This is amazing!” The elf looked down in evident embarrassment, speaking softly, “Kreacher is being happy to serve. What would Young Master like Kreacher to be doing with the stone?”
Most who received a bond accepted without hesitation. Would this person do the same? How would they react when they found out who he was?
Harry nodded, “It was Sirius. He loved anyone in the family who would rebel from the traditions he hated so much. When he was trapped at Grimmauld place, he researched every disowned Black Family Member. Someone had kept a record of who had been disowned and why. Intrigued, Sirius snuck away and visited the village where Eduardus had lived. Eduardus had passed long ago, but he was able to meet his descendants. They had kept his records preserved and intact, along with the diary of Luciana. Sirius was given the records in the hope that their history would continue to be passed on in other areas of the world. He never got the chance though, and the records were sealed in the vault until I came upon them.”
At his words, Dobby broke out in rather loud tears, “Young master is being so kind to Dobby! Dobby does not deserve-”
Harry flinched, hesitating, “I don’t think I can do that, Hermione,” he rushed to explain as their faces fell, “I’d love to hang out with you guys, but I can’t handle the Great Hall any more. People have always stared and gossiped. They’ve been quick to turn on me since second year, but this… I think it’s safer for me to just eat in the kitchens.”
to seven,” she said, and leaned in close to Malfoy, her cleavage clearly visible and her skirt that Harry thought was much too short riding up her thighs.
"Mrs. Malfoy, could you lower your wand?" Harry asked although it really was a command, his own at the ready to strike should the need arise. She obeyed, dropping her arm to her side and Harry slightly lowered his own.
Draco woke with a small jolt, turning and blinking at Harry rapidly with bleary grey eyes. Harry stared back, not sure of what to say.
Draco gasped, and Harry ripped himself away from him so fast his glasses flew off and landed somewhere on the hardwood floor with a clatter. He quickly scrambled for his wand, his heart in his throat as his fingers closed around the wood just in time to point it directly at Narcissa Malfoy, who had appeared in the doorway.
Thrilled, she said, “Well, I’m still just sixteen – I’ll be seventeen in three months, but I’ll be back at Hogwarts by then for my last year.”
"It must be, Potter. Nothing you've done for the past hour has worked. You should thank Merlin you're so famous, I doubt the ministry would have let such an inept excuse for a wizard into their Auror department otherwise."
," Harry sighed, looking at him in awe, and Draco felt the earth collapsing around him, coming harder than he had ever done in his entire life. His nails dug into the skin of Harry's muscled thigh, his whole body shaking from the intensity of it as his cry echoed throughout Quidditch shower room.
"He was a muggle." Draco's voice was hoarse. Harry couldn't believe what he had just heard. He had just assumed that Draco would have never encountered a muggle willingly. He assumed the boy Draco had called his best friend could have only been another wizard. "He was a muggle, and he was my best friend." He said again, as if he had heard Harry's thoughts.
Harry traced his swollen, red lips with the head of his cock before just barely dipping the tip inside his open, waiting mouth with a soft grunt. He pulled it back out and tapped it against Draco's bottom lip, and Draco made a wanton noise in response that sounded embarrassingly feminine. Harry dipped the tip past his lips once more and Draco's tongue darted out against him, making Harry gasp under his mercy again. He replaced Harry's hand with his own, circling his tongue around the crown and tracing the tip of it up his frenulum and over the slit, reveling in the clean taste and feel of him. Out of a wicked curiosity, he abruptly stopped licking. Harry immediately whined in frustration, desperate need etched into every inch of his face as he looked down at the blonde, pleading, and Draco then realized that sucking cock was the hottest power struggle he had ever endured.
A pang of guilt stabbed Harry through his gut at the thought of Ron. One month ago, he had finally decided to break things off with Ginny, simultaneously deciding not to tell anyone else. A week later, Ron had come barging into the office demanding Harry to immediately explain himself. Harry winced as he replayed his own explanation in his mind's eye.
"Please," Harry begged against Draco's lips, and Draco's own cock ached from hearing it. He wanted to hear Harry Potter begging him forever. His fingers flew to undo the fly of Harry's jeans, pulling them down with himself as his knees reached the dark marble of his bathroom floor.
He felt Harry reaching up and a hand carefully closed around his left wrist. He slowly pried it away from blonde hair and pulled his arm down between them.
"So is that why you've been such a prick to me all these years?" he blurted out suddenly, verging on anger.
He got to the men's quidditch showers only seconds later, peeling off his robe in hurried disgust as he went. His cloak whooshed past his legs as he flung it down on the bench and then started at his tie - long, pale fingers pulling the precise knot undone in a second. The emerald and silver fabric landed on the floor near feet that were kicking off shoes and socks, rushing against time. He pulled off his house sweater vest so violently that his slicked back, white-blonde hair became mussed, sticking up awkwardly in random places and falling into his eyes. His fingers started working on the delicate buttons of his shirt. He was half-way down when he impatiently decided he should just use his wand to speed the rest up when he stopped dead, hand held out perfectly still in mid-reach towards his robe.
"You're so easy, Potter," Draco said with his familiar smirk, uncrossing his arms and moving to grip the ledge. Harry looked at him, panic rising. What if Malfoy told everyone? What if he used it as blackmail? Harry thought of obliviating Draco, and immediately felt horrible about himself.
He opened his eyes which had involuntarily screwed shut from anticipation and found the lifeless silvery-black ones belonging to The Baron shining across from him. Draco had never feared ghosts, but even he could admit The Baron, with his silver bloodstains and awful blank stare, was mildly terrifying.
Someone moved past Harry, brushing against him to pass, heading back inside the bar. “Sorry!” they said, and Harry muttered “No worries,” as he stepped forward and suddenly, drunkenly tripped on air, sending himself tumbling right into the brick wall –
and past curfew no less," he hissed, his wand now out of sight and Draco realized Snape had given Harry a false memory.
"This is my home, Potter." But there was some underlying tone amidst the sneer that suggested Malfoy knew perfectly well he was not supposed to be here.
A few seconds later Snape gasped, and Draco looked back at him again. Snape hadn't needed to break into his mind to finally figure it out.
With great difficulty, Draco stilled.  “I’m sorry, it’s not going to take much.”  He looked at Harry through hooded eyes, on the brink when Harry interrupted.  But he was glad.  He’d rather have Harry’s hands and mouth on him.
“Oh.  All right,” Draco said hesitantly.  He carefully opened the envelope to find a certificate to Twilfitt and Tattings for a sizable amount.
“It wasn’t for nothing,” Harry finally said. “I did notice you. I noticed the change in you. I looked forward to seeing you.” Harry chuckled at himself. “You didn’t need to be brought into the Ministry as often as you were. And it wasn’t Ministry policy to take informants out for a meal after questioning.”
“By the way, Professor Knox wanted me to let you know he wasn’t feeling well, and won’t be here this evening.”
Harry didn’t notice the blush that graced Draco’s face as the prophesier did.  She decided to change the subject.
She continued on without him.  “I never thought I’d see the day when you would be defending the honor of Draco Malfoy.”
“It’s been a bit slow going,” Miranda told him.  “I don’t get around as well as I used to.  And I’ve been having to rely on rumors and hearsay to find new spells.  Wizards have not been forthcoming about their own invented spells.  I give full credit of course.  Unlike that unscrupulous Lockhart.”
They paused to look at one another again and grinned.  Harry stepped forward to gently kiss Draco goodnight.
“But,” Harry continued.  “Like it or not, we need to live in the real world.  We need our friends.  We need other people, including family.”
“Really?”  A large grin spread across Draco’s face before he realized he was doing it.  He caught Hermione watching him and composed himself.
Draco smiled. “All excellent ideas.  And I want to go to each and every one with our family.  But for now, let’s concentrate on making this trip memorable.”
“Yes,” Draco agreed.  “You’ve got quite a punch.  I’ll be sure to stay on your good side from now on.”
“It’s only been little more than a month, Harry. I’m still getting used to the idea of you and . . . Draco.”
“Speaking of Draco, where is he?” Hermione asked.  “I thought we were all going to go to Hogsmeade to celebrate having done well on our N.E.W.T.s.”
“But we are doing something,” Harry said.  “We’re spending our first Christmas Eve together.”  He waved his wand at the wireless and switched on the WWN.  The pair listened to music while they talked well into the night.
Poppy appeared with a tray of tea and cups teetering on her tiny hands.  Instinctively, Draco reached forward to steady the tray, then took it and walked it to the buffet.  Poppy stood, knees knocking, and ears down.
“What is the meaning of this?” she inquired, hands on hips. “Mr. Malfoy, this is not a hotel,” she scolded.
Going back to his own chambers, Harry spent most of the rest of the day alone, pondering the events of the night before.  He found himself wanting to continue his interrogation game with Malfoy.  There were many things he was curious about, but he knew Malfoy would never voluntarily answer Harry’s queries.  And Harry wouldn’t know how to begin a normal conversation with him.
A small bell rang, announcing the service of supper and the guests took their places at the round table.  Olivia Tifft, a Divination expert, sat down next to Harry and greeted him.  Glenda tried to sit on the other side of him, but Draco swiftly stole the seat almost right out from under her. Chittock settled on the chair next to Draco.
“Yes. I swear,” Draco held his hand up to promise. “The Healer said everything has healed up nicely. I still need to continue the stretching exercises for my ankle. But other than that, I’m cleared for my normal activities.” Draco winked. “All my normal activities.”
Dean Thomas on the other hand, had a pleasant smile and had grown quite tall and broad over the past two years.  Harry certainly didn’t have any feelings for him, as he didn’t really know him well.  But he could see why Ginny had been attracted to him.  He was rather pleasant to look at.
“Just the truth,” Draco answered, sounding resigned.  “The same thing he’s been saying all along -  that you will eventually figure out that I’m no good.”
“Oh.  Yes, because I was the Chooser.  Well, technically, I was both, because Padma was odd girl out and we all had to put our wands back for her to choose.  She ended up picking mine.”
Harry opened his door to find Hermione in Draco’s arms, being dipped as they danced.  The pair of them stopped in their tracks and stared.
Draco took another sip and set his cup down. “And you sustained no injuries at all? That’s amazing.”
Ron snorted, “I don’t need to buy Hermione second-hand jewelry.  I worked at George’s shop over the summer.  I have money.”
In an effort to make Harry feel better he offered, “But you did play well.  I didn’t have to make too many mistakes.”
“While we were still out finding Horcruxes.  Back in the Spring.”  Harry continued.  “The second time, it started out just like the first one, but when he pointed the wand at me, he mumbled a spell and fixed my hair.”
Ron looked around for Hermione and saw that Ginny had now joined her group.  It was going to be a long night.
But his scent, when he stood close, was what really caught Draco’s attention.  He could feel himself becoming aroused the closer they got to Harry’s quarters.  In need of adjusting himself beneath his own robes, Draco refused to give Harry the satisfaction.  Though, the smirk on Harry’s face told him that Harry already knew the affect he was having on Draco.  Harry didn’t even try to hide the fact that he was feeling the same way, and tugged at his trousers.
Major love and credit to la_topolina for being my beta on this! Couldn't have done it without the help and constant encouragement!
After a moment, he looked up to find Harry smiling at him. It was a small smile, but it was there. The first one ever directed at him. Feeling awkward, he looked away and moved toward the couch. He sat and waited, determined not to say another word until his question was answered.
As Draco cautiously peered inside the mystery room, he was surprised and somewhat disappointed. It was nothing but a common sitting room! Why on earth would there be an invisible door to a common sitting room?!
The relief turned to ash in his mouth as the masked figures, shrouded in black, converged, resembling a dark cloud as they surrounded their target.
Harry was silent for a moment, and then, “I’ve decided to give you a chance, Draco. You helped me when I needed it last night, and you said you wanted to be my friend. I believe you.”
When the day came for Draco to journey to Diagon Alley, he found that at first, things happened much as they had the first time. His mother was ecstatic at the prospect of taking him to buy his wand, school supplies, and his owl. His father had scolded her heavily for fawning over Draco and insisted he be sent off on his own. His mother had heavily protested, but his father had only allowed her to give him a proper list before ushering her off without another word.
He smiled a little when Kreacher cocked his head in confusion, obviously not having thought about this before. “No, Master Sirius ran away, he will not be wanting to come back to the house or Kreacher,” brightening for a moment, but then hesitating, “but...Kreacher is not wanting to be alone anymore.”
When the time came to leave the oasis, they walked through the curtain of bougainvillea hand in hand.
Harry wiped the tears from his face and kissed him softly, “How could I? Come now, where’s my prim and proper boyfriend who’s always spouting off about logic and a good sense of reason. I brought you here. Surely you know what that means?”
Though the winter night was cold and the ground was blanketed with snow, the atmosphere was one of warmth and love.
Draco laughed without humour. “You hate a dead man and you torture his son! Let me ask you this: if he didn’t look like his father, would you hate him so much?” He didn’t wait for an answer as he took a calming breath. “Tomorrow morning, Harry and I will be having a very long meeting with Dumbeldore. I will teach him Occlumency, and you will not touch his mind again.”
Draco’s last thought was that he was getting tired of falling unconscious; it was embarrassing and inconvenient.
He stood and walked to the toad, curious at the sudden change in behaviour. “Does this mean you’re going to behave yourself?”
Tom rose quickly to his feet, and Harry stared him down. His eyes seemed to glow fiercely as he spoke, "I have love in me the likes of which you can scarcely imagine and rage the likes of which you would not believe. If I cannot satisfy the one, I will indulge the other."
"I'm not rejecting you Malfoy. I just need time to think. Give me a day. You've said a lot tonight, and most of it rather shocking. I had my suspicions about some of the things you said, but I didn't expect it to be of this magnitude. At most I think I expected things to be less hostile. And maybe hoped you'd changed your beliefs. I've had a long and painful day, and it is rather late. Meet me tomorrow after curfew, on the seventh floor, across from the tapestry of Barnabas the Barmy. It'll be safe to talk there. "
Harry was awakened the next morning by a faint but steadily increasing burn in his hand. Still exhausted and half-asleep, it took him a few moments to remember the events of the previous night. He was irritated that the medicine had already worn off until he remembered that Malfoy had given him the pack after he'd finished treating Harry's hand. All at once, he was completely awake, and he wasted no time in applying the ointments and changing the bandage. The relief he felt was immediate.
been funny. He had felt terribly frightened and guilty, and he had remembered that guilt many, many, times over the years since but now – now Malfoy was laughing about it. And Harry supposed – as he saw Malfoy put his forehead down on the table, which shook slightly from his laughter – it
To Harry’s surprise, Malfoy laughed, something he only recalled the blonde doing when he had been belittling his friends or himself at Hogwarts.
Draco turned to Harry, his eyes red and puffy, wildly reminding Harry of kissing Cho Chang, except that for some bizarre and inexplicable reason his memory decided to suddenly replace her, and Harry then saw himself kissing a wet faced Draco Malfoy. "That's why my father must have murdered him," he whispered, and Harry was utterly horrified, but not because Lucius Malfoy had killed an innocent child.
The girl immediately stopped talking and turned around. Another girl wearing more dark eye make-up than clothing squealed at the sight of her.
Draco looked up and caught Harry's intense gaze as he slowly wrapped his lips around the first inch of Harry's cock. Harry must have been holding his breath, because he quickly expelled all the air in his lungs.
Harry's gasp made his eyes snap back up, meeting two shocked emeralds behind circular lenses that were - sure enough - charmed to stay clear of water and steam.
"It is true, isn't it?" Malfoy said breathlessly. "Did you think about me at night, too, Potter, in your dirty Gryffindor dorm?" Harry heard the memory vials in the pocket of his robe clink together as he grabbed Malfoy by his white undershirt.
“Yeah, ‘m serious!” he said, swaying dangerously on his stool. “It was in – wrote ‘n – writ in – written in – that damn Potions book tha’ was Snape’s,” he said, old memories swirling around in his mind hazily. "So I jus’ said it – I had no
Before Draco could nod or say some idiotic cliché line like 'ready as I'll ever be' although it was true, the statue began to move and Harry stepped back in surprise.
in Hufflepuff.”  She rested her chin on her fist, looking Malfoy in the eyes through her unnaturally long, black lashes. “You know, I never knew anything about all this house rivalry and famous witches and wizards type of stuff until I started Hogwarts because my parents are muggles.”
"I didn't take - I - you could have -" he spluttered, turning around to face him. Draco's arms were crossed, and he was half sitting on the ledge of the soaking tub. He had at some point during Harry's inspection unbuttoned the grey shirt he was wearing, and Harry could see his white cotton undershirt tight against his skin. His eyes glanced over Draco's long, pale neck and stopped over the red mark he had made there, feeling his arousal grow.
"Look, Malfoy - if - if you're trying to - to get me back or whatever for the other day - I don't blame you. I deserve it," he said bitterly. "But I'm not going to stop defending myself."
"M- Malfoy," he squeaked, his left hand wiping excess water from his face before he quickly cleared his throat. "If - if you don't get the hell out of here in the next ten seconds, I'll hex your bollocks off."
Harry marveled at Draco's cock, similar yet so different from his own. He was circumcised, thinner and slightly longer than Harry. The skin of his cock was just as pale as the rest of him, except for the head, dark pink and leaking. Harry gingerly wrapped a hand around him and Draco let his head fall back, panting. Harry's eyes fell to the mark he had left on Draco's neck again and he was suddenly filled with an insane urge to feel Draco's hard, bare prick against his own. He stepped out of his trainers and jeans, nearly tripping, closing the distance between them as he wrapped one hand around both of their cocks.
"I can't - I can't," Harry choked out after only a few intense moments of fucking his mouth. "Draco, I'm - I'm going to -
Waving his hand, Snape released Harry, who instantly drew his own wand and pointed it at Snape in fury, breathing heavily.
Just then, the most popular song that summer started to blare throughout the bar, causing many of the girls around them to squeal in delight, tugging their friends away to the dancefloor.
Draco did not stop sucking even as Harry went rigid, his hand rapidly pumping over himself as Harry came into his mouth, violently spurting hot seed over his tongue with a long, drawn out groan.
"Malfoy-" Harry gasped again, and the sound of his surname rushing quietly past full lips made his prick jerk against tight fabric.
he exclaimed, his back arching off the tile as a pink tongue flicked over his nipple. Draco stopped, surprised at the reaction. He looked up at Harry, a wicked smirk toying at his lips before he closed his mouth around the pert bud and gently sucked.
His impossibly hard cock, now free from the only thing that had contained it, sprang forward, wrenching a noise of relief out of him. He stepped out of his trousers, kicking them backwards through the running water with the heel of his foot, now clothed only in his open, wet cotton button-down.
Malfoy seemed to be internally struggling with himself, when he suddenly leapt forward and made to grab the vials from Harry's hand. Harry reacted instinctively, quickly moving the vials in his left hand away. Instead of hexing him, he dropped his wand from his right hand and grabbed Malfoy’s outstretched arm, immediately pulling the other man to his chest and kissing him fiercely.
"I'm afraid the Headmaster is resting, Potter, as it is nearly... midnight," he said through his teeth.
Harry continued to stare, looking at him as if he were trying to figure out what nefarious thing he was up to now, clearly in disbelief what he just said.
Potter. I can’t help it if I’m better looking than you,” he said, smirk reappearing as his hand reached out to the wall to steady himself.
In the last shower stall on the right at the back of the steamy room stood a young man with jet-black hair that only hung flat because it was held down by a stream of hot water. That water flowed over broad shoulders and prominent shoulder blades, down into the deep dip of lower back and over the round curves of his arse - separating into vertical rivers running over toned, muscled thighs and legs. He was bent forward slightly, his left hand splayed out on the wall in front of him. His right arm, half blocked from view, was moving in a rapid motion. Draco tore his eyes away to the pile of clothes resting nearby on a dry shower bench and saw scarlet and gold there - not that he needed any further confirmation.
He felt Harry's thighs quivering, his legs threatening to give out as the last of his orgasm jerked through him. Harry unclenched his hands from his hair and Draco put a strong left hand against him, holding him steady. He felt the last twitch of Harry's cock in his mouth and he finally pulled off, tilting his head back more than necessary to look up.
Harry, contrary to many of his fantasies, would be prudish, timid and gentle, innocently blushing with loving little sighs and soft touches.
"Malfoy," Harry said, still speaking softly although his tone had changed to reflect his newfound sympathy. "Who was he?" His change in tone did not go unnoticed by Draco, who took a step back, a small gasp escaping his charade.
"Isn't that what I just said, Scarhead?" he spat. Harry considered hexing him but couldn't bring himself to hex a wandless wizard just for name calling.
His hands were winding into the front of Draco’s robes and he was leaning in, their hot breath mingling, watching dark blonde lashes fluttering closed, and there was no way that Harry could stop himself –
. His stint in the hospital wing a few days ago, courtesy of none other than Saint Potter, was the first time he had truly slept in ages, thanks to Pomfrey's large dose potions. He knew he was being set up to fail and he was determined to prevent it. He could feel himself becoming more reckless with each passing day, his desperation and depression settling in. It made him utterly devoid of hope. Snape should have just let him...
And if he couldn't tell Ron, talking to Hermione about it just felt like he'd be betraying him somehow. Not to mention the whole thing would be incredibly embarrassing. He heaved with a heavy sigh, pulling his glasses off and letting them clatter to the table, roughly rubbing his closed eyes.
With a noise that sounded like he had just tasted the most exquisite dessert, he deepened the kiss, tilting his head as he explored Harry's mouth.
Biting down on his bottom lip, he let his hands roam up over Harry's biceps and shoulders, bringing them down to wander over his chest. His fingertips grazed over dark nipples, and he felt Harry's breathing quicken. He gently slid his neatly manicured fingernails down Harry's abdomen, watching with awe as the muscle beneath flexed involuntarily. His fingers reached the waistband of Harry's jeans once more, but they didn't stop this time. They ghosted over Harry's cock, hard underneath the denim. Harry gasped at the feather-light touch, sending a slight shiver through his body. Malfoy leaned in and kissed Harry again, swallowing the groan he made as he pressed his palm down, rubbing over the material. Draco could feel his hand getting hot from the friction of it.
Harry's cock sprung up as soon as it was free from its denim prison, tenting the front of his simple, scarlet red boxers. Wasting no time, he curled his fingers over the elastic and pulled them down, purposely letting them catch on Harry's cock so that it slapped the skin of his lower abdomen as it sprang back up. The tip of Harry's uncircumcised, thick cock reached somewhere just below his belly button, beautifully curving towards its owner. Draco wrapped his right hand around the base of it, feeling the black nest of hair brush against his palm. He pulled it down towards him, the head already peeking through the foreskin and glistening.
Maybe he was going mad. That had to be it. The stress of his life and responsibilities was finally getting to him. He was just imagining it. There was no way-
come back to it later. He was running himself ragged at every moment and he was of no use to anything like that. He needed some time to recuperate. He needed to clear his over-burdened mind. He needed room to
He was pulling the wool over his own eyes now, he knew that, but the question gave him an overwhelming urge to be sure. His feet were suddenly obeying curiosity. He could just peek around the wall. That's it. Just a quick peek to confirm or deny who -
Instead of returning the favor, she smiled. “Good for you.  And Draco.  You shouldn’t give a rat’s arse what any of them think.”
“It was wonderful,” she said.  “We went to dinner at one of my favorite muggle restaurants, then we saw a movie.  Ron was such a good sport. It wasn’t the sort of movie he would have preferred.”
“I’ll bet the two of you would rather enjoy having the castle all to yourselves,” Trelawney said.  Coming from her, Harry wasn’t offended.  She was often oblivious of her wording.  It was the snickering from Flitwick and Sinistra that got to him. He glared at them but said nothing.
Harry gasped when he walked in.  Not only was it much larger than his former bedroom at Hogwarts, it was furnished better.  The countertops were black marble, to match the toilet and bidet. The glass shower appeared to have real gold fixtures. And the bath, also black marble, was large enough to accommodate a minimum of three people.  But what struck Harry the most was the artwork on the walls.  He stood and turned around in place.
Hermione seemed on the edge of her seat, waiting to hear what happened next.  It sounded incredibly romantic.  However, she knew it couldn’t have ended well, seeing as Draco wasn’t interested in girls.
Harry nodded his head and followed the Healer out of the room and into a smaller, nearly empty room.  Cummins dimmed the light and performed the spell. A ghost image appeared around Harry, like an aura.  The Healer used his wand and a strange device Harry had never seen before to capture some of the image.  The entire procedure took less than fifteen minutes.  Dean, then Ginny followed.
Ron gently pushed Hermione through. It was already alight with candles, and it smelled of fresh flowers.
Harry wished he had the nerve to go and speak to him as he would anybody else.  The wand game provided the perfect excuse for conversation, but without it, Harry felt awkward. Over the course of the day, Harry had been slowly subconsciously allowing his feelings to reveal themselves.  By the time their potion was made, Harry was convinced he was crushing on Draco Malfoy.
When Draco angled forward to address her, he caught sight of Harry, who seemed to be staring at him then quickly looked away.
“And I don’t think you’ll need these.” Draco removed Harry’s glasses and placed them next to the tie.
“I thought you could treat yourself to some new clothes for your upcoming holiday,” Narcissa smiled.
Sighing heavily, Draco replied, “Exactly what you told me would happen.  He’s too good for me.  And now someone better has come along.”
“So, you travel around gathering new spells written by modern wizards?” Harry asked, just joining the conversation.
Draco grinned. “It’s not your turn to ask a question.  I can ask you another, so you can ask that one, if you’d like.”
Opening one eye and smirking, Draco replied, “Purple.  I hope to show you the exact shade next time we’re at the manor.”
Harry blushed again. He hadn’t realized he was so easy to read. Draco thanked the wand maker and tucked his purchase in the hidden pocket of his trousers. He took the box with him and he and Harry walked toward the front of the shop.
“No.  It’s you.” Harry hesitated, then asked a question that had been on his mind since the morning after the second wand party. “Draco?  What happened that night?  At the second party. I remember telling you . . . you’re handsome.”  He blushed and began chewing on his thumb nail.  “But when we woke up, you seemed upset with me and, well, I was lying on top of you . . .”
He frowned.  “Last weekend, he told me he thought I was handsome during the game.  And he . . . well, you saw the position we were in the next morning.  Sure, he was totally pissed and under a spell.  But today, I swear, he was . . . flirting.   When did you–you know what, nevermind.  I don’t want to know.”
Harry’s brow immediately scrunched tightly and he felt like the wind was knocked from his lungs, leaving him unable to speak.  But Draco continued.
“Nothing solid,” Harry said.  “But I thought maybe it has something to do with Lucius trying to make a bargain for early release.”
“Oh. My mother has been lonely with me and my father gone.  She’s been looking forward to me coming home.”
“Yes, I probably am delirious. But that doesn’t mean I don’t know what I’m saying. I am in love with you. And I’m sorry I didn’t do anything about it when I had the chance.”
Hermione hated to admit that Ron made some very valid points. Still, she couldn’t forget the look in Harry’s eyes as he talked about Malfoy.
They sat a few minutes while Harry watched from his place on the other side of the room. Draco cleared his throat and sat straighter, moving away from his father.
“Friend?  You think we could be friends?” Harry asked, his tone not quite how he meant it.  He was simply surprised.
With great effort, Harry eventually made it up to Gryffindor Tower.  His friends bombarded him with questions the moment he stepped through the portrait.
The pair, along with Ron, Hermione, and most of the Weasley clan, had been waiting for the past three hours for news of Ginny’s baby.  Dean periodically made an appearance to tell them ‘not yet’.
“It was some sort of cutting spell.  The others weren’t injured too badly.  But it hit Arthur’s leg in a bad spot.  He’s lost a lot of blood.”
Harry smirked, knowing Draco was right, and walked over to Ron.  He held his arms out for the infant. Ron didn’t hesitate to hand her over.
“You simply dropped it.”  The frown on Draco’s face turned to a smile. “After so long, you’re still full of surprises.”
“I’m not saying,” Harry answered.  Ron had already guessed, and Harry was a terrible liar.  It might not be the worst thing for Ron to know he had a crush.
“What do you mean stuff?  What’s the other thing.  Everyone else smells three things,” Harry pressed.
Suddenly, a small shower of sparks burst from the cake in a dazzling display.  As they fell back down onto the plate, the sparks formed words that lay sprinkled across the chocolate confection.
Throughout the world, willing followers of Voldemort were entirely drained of their magic as their dark marks shifted to cover their faces.
"It's alright to feel angry, Harry. It was completely unfair to you. Your friends had their hearts in the right place, even if it doesn't seem like it right now. Take some time if you need to, but try to forgive them. Close friends are irreplaceable. Take it from me. " Sirius said.
“NO!” Draco shouted, tearing himself from Merlin’s grasp.  “I don’t care who you are! You don’t get to decide that! It was my fault! It doesn’t matter if I didn’t kill Dumbledore! It doesn’t matter that Harry chose to forgive me! NONE of it matters!”
“Now, now,” he mockingly chastised Umbridge, who was once again in toad form. “A professor of your standing should have better manners than that.” Without another word, he moved to the sofa and picked up a Quidditch magazine.
With those last few words, he completed the wrap on Harry's hand. He placed a mild sticking charm so the wrap would not come undone on its own and let go. He sat and watched as Harry gingerly moved his hand around, wincing slightly but looking extremely relieved nevertheless. After he finished his inspection, he met Draco's nervous gaze.
See Chapter 1! The conception of Merlin and his role in this story is my creation, but otherwise, I own nothing!
Draco’s voice cracked as he tried to speak, “I...I was afraid...if you didn’t feel the same...I knew you wouldn’t. How could you?” Tears spilled over again, his body trembling with the rejection he’d feared for so long.
Blood flowed in crimson waves; the guilty indistinguishable from the innocent, despite the madness that tainted their souls.
Saying nothing, Draco walked towards the wall and paced three times. When the door appeared, Draco faced Umbridge, delighting in the glazed look on her face. Without another word, he stepped inside, holding open the door.
Draco smiled, “A house is where students get placed together. They were created and named after the four founders of Hogwarts; Gryffindor, Ravenclaw, Hufflepuff, and Slytherin.”
Note: I've changed the timeline so that the attack on Mr. Weasley happened over the summer. I needed to free up Christmas holidays, and this was the only way I could have things make sense.
Frustration mounted as Draco continued to pace back and forth in front of the bay windows overlooking the ocean. The thread continued to pulse and wave with his movements as he waited for a response… any response…
Draco’s curiosity was overwhelming, but he knew he wouldn’t get any answers out of the Gryffindor at the moment. He closed his mouth and nodded.
Draco gasped for breath as the malevolent force was ripped from his soul… like a living parasite designed to torment him.
Healer Edwards walked over and put a hand on Harry’s shoulder, “Well, you will have a wonderful new pair of glasses in a few moments.”
Draco brightened; he’d figured things were going fairly well, but he wasn’t expecting such an invitation. But Hagrid… “I don’t think he would want me around. My father and my family have a...reputation.”
Draco walked into the dimly lit shop, surprised at how familiar it felt, even though he’d only been in there once. “Hello, is anyone here?” he called into the seemingly empty shop. “Welcome,” came a voice from behind one of the stacks of wands, “here to buy your first wand, I presume?” Olivander stepped forward, appraising him with piercing eyes. “Yessir, I’m Draco Malfoy,” Draco responded, rather nervous despite himself. “Ah, of course,” the wandmaker rasped, grabbing his measuring tape from the desk. Olivander released it in front of Draco and it began to measure him every which way. Draco wished he could just tell the man which wand was his.
Draco opened the door, his blood growing cold at the sight of the darkened room. His father stood before him dressed in his signature black robes, looking down on Draco with menacing silver eyes. “Draco.”
“Oh, I’m sorry,” Draco said sincerely, “I didn’t even think to ask if you knew about the houses. Lots of first years don’t. I don't know why no one ever thinks to make sure everyone is informed ahead of time, but I personally don’t think it’s very fair for anyone to be left in the dark. First-year is already scary enough, don’t you think?”
They all shared a smile, laughing when Ron’s stomach rumbled, “What?” he protested, “It’s almost dinner time!”
To his astonishment, Merlin began to laugh, “Don’t look so fearful, Draco,” he grinned broadly, “in the thousands of years I’ve been here, do you really think that’s the worst I’ve heard?”
“Yeah,” Harry said, averting his eyes and rubbing the back of his neck, “You shouldn’t be just wandering around in your cat form, hunting on the grounds and all that. I could tell everyone I got a new cat. We’re allowed two pets after all. No one would suspect a thing.”
But then a voice in his head reminded him of his own desires to escape: to stay in the Forest of Dean, to stay in the afterlife. He could have, but he hadn’t because there were things that were more important. As much as it hurt, this had been the case for his parents too, and he understood.
"Har-" At this Harry's head snapped up. Silently Draco cursed himself for getting too comfortable in his mind. He cleared his throat and continued, "Potter. If you want this to get better you are going to have to show someone." The stubborn idiot started to shake his head and protest, but Draco would not allow him to interrupt. "I know that you being here trying to fix it yourself means that you don't want to show the healer or Dumbledore. And I don't imagine those friends of yours would be of much use." He paused, expecting the usual Gryffindor loyalty in defence of his friends. He had to mask his shock when all he received was a slight nod, gesturing for Draco to continue. Encouraged by the lack of insults or injuries thus far, Draco made his offer. "I could patch this up for you. I can't do as much as Pomphrey or Dumbledore, but that doesn't particularly matter. I can stop the bleeding and ease the pain, allowing the wound to begin to heal."
Smiling to himself, and looking forward to the chance to finally find his destined match, Harry took his quill in hand and wrote one single word in return:
Draco lowered his eyes to the ground and said nothing for several moments. While he waited for the boy to collect himself, Harry reflected that this was confirmation of his earlier theory. Draco Malfoy was definitely not used to praise.
Suddenly remembering, Draco bolted upright, nearly falling again as he fought the onslaught of dizziness and tried to blink the spots from his eyes.
He’d been stabbed, after all, and there was really no other explanation for coming face-to-face with Merlin, which Draco also found strangely easy to accept. If nothing else, the massive waves of power emanating from the wizard would have convinced him.
Draco held his breath as Severus placed his wand against the pulse point on his wrist, casting the spell that would determine whether he had a soulmate. His heart began to pound as the white thread of magic was released from the wand, curled around his wrist, connected itself, and settled around his wrist.  Draco gasped lightly, emotion overwhelming him as hope flared in his heart.
Harry’s face broke out in a smile, “Come with me,” he beckoned. Without warning, Harry began to walk through the curtain of plants. Draco was shocked, and a little concerned. While it was beautiful, it was also covered in sharp looking thorns. Harry peeked his head back through, holding out a hand to Draco, “Don’t worry; the plants and area have been charmed in several different ways. The plants won’t hurt us.”
“HOW DARE YOU!” Umbridge shrieked, “DO YOU KNOW WHO I AM?! I WILL NOT BE MADE A FOOL OF BY A PATHETIC, COWARDLY, SNIVELING CHILD! I WILL HAVE YOU-”
However, he only did the opposite, and Draco’s magic began to pulse about the room. Books fell off shelves, the lanterns began to flicker, and the walls began to tremble. “Yes, he did, Professor.” Inwardly, Severus winced. Draco never called him anything other than “Godfather” or “Uncle Sev” when they were alone. “He told me that James Potter was a bully and that he tormented you. He also told me that his father looks exactly like him, and that you are constantly saying Harry is just like him.”
Harry sat up in bed, instantly alert, alarm bells ringing in his head. Today was one of those rare days that he and Draco had a day off together. With his constant hours at the Ministry, and Draco running his apothecary, spending a whole day together was something they both treasured. Neither ever got up before the other. They were content to lay wrapped in each other's arms until they were both awake.
Harry Potter came into our office! Healer Edwards should fire me...no, I’ll fire myself! Yes, I’ll quit!”
Harry dropped to the ground, wrapping his arms around his knees as he sobbed, whispering, "maybe it would have been better if I had just died with my parents."
“Nice job,” Draco said, coming to stand next to Harry. He pulled out his own wand, using it to conjure a small swarm of flies and direct them into the tank. Neither could resist laughing as the toad snapped them up one by one.
His soul sang with joy as he felt Draco in his mind. Harry knew exactly where to find him and could feel surprise, love, and then smug satisfaction from Draco.
“By all means, continue knocking,” he drawled sarcastically, refusing to acknowledge that his words were beginning to slur.  “My tolerance for snivelling students and idiotic faculty members has reached its end for the day. Curfew is fast approaching, and any student still there when the time comes will find themselves in detention with Filch for a month.” He grinned maliciously as he continued. “Any professor runs the risk of finding themselves thoroughly hexed.”
Magic began to flow from his core, seeking his soul mate. As his anger and desperation increased, so did the magic. The air vibrated with it, and people cowered around him, unsure how to react to such immense power. All at once, his magic surged, reaching its destination and connecting with Draco. Although he couldn't see it, he felt their magic swirl together, forming a rope as it snapped into place.
Draco decided it was best not to ask more for the moment, and turned his thoughts to everything Harry had told him. He wasn’t surprised that the Gryffindor needed a hideout. The other students were relentless when it came to all things Harry Potter. Then there was Umbridge….he shuddered to think that he may have led to other students undergoing her torture sessions.
He left McGonagall’s chambers with mixed emotions.  He was glad to have a wand that fit so nicely with his own magic.  But sad for the circumstances under which he acquired it.
“All right.  I’ll see what I can do.”  Knowing that wasn’t all Blaise would want in return, Draco asked, “What else?”
Snickering, Harry replied, “Then at least I know you’re not after me for my money.  And now you know I’m not after you for yours.”
Shrugging, Harry casually answered, “I dunno.  Maybe I’d rather help people directly.  Become a Healer or something.”  He gave Draco a sideways glance as the corner of his mouth rose slightly.
“Not too knackered, I hope.” Draco raised an eyebrow. “You told me if I went on that ride, I could have anything I want.”
He walked in to see Harry still lying in the same position on his back, but with a large conspicuous lump under the covers. The lump appeared to be bouncing slightly.
They managed to find things to talk about.  Generic topics, but the conversation flowed without too many awkward silences.  He tried to figure out who she was by some of the things she said, but each was very careful not to reveal too much.  Although, he’d let slip something about his muggle parents.  She mentioned Tracey Davis and Mandy Brocklehurst during their conversations, so he surmised she may be from either Slytherin or Ravenclaw.
Draco sighed. “I do feel as if a weight has been lifted.”  he chuckled.  “I should say another weight.  I feel lighter every day I’m with you.”  He leaned forward and kissed Harry softly on the lips.
“Draco and I played sort of a question game at the wand parties.  The rules were that we had to answer honestly and completely.  And no subject was off limits.  It definitely cut out small talk,” Harry explained.
“Oh, congratulations.”  Harry tried his best to sound excited for the couple.  He shook Dean’s hand and hugged Ginny, then sat down next to Draco.
Though he did want to say goodbye himself, especially to Molly and Arthur for hosting, Harry nodded. Draco’s demeanor told him that his husband may have been upset by the exchange with Ginny.
They sat in silence for a while, both their minds racing, not knowing which thought to express first.
“Then tell me who it is, and I’ll stop pestering you.”  When Harry didn’t offer any information, Ron made another guess.  “Daphne.  It’s got to be Daphne.  Right?”
The painfully thin looking librarian allowed what Draco thought was meant to be a smile but appeared more of a sneer.
“She called me a little pouf and stormed off.  At first, I was angry that she called me that.  Basically, I hid in a corner for the rest of the reception.  But near the end, an older boy came over to me and asked if what the girl said was true.  I didn’t know what to say.”
Harry had gotten a parchment bearing the number four and was glad he would have more choices this time round. When it was his turn, he handed Blaise his paper and reached into the cauldron.  Groping around, Harry felt nothing at first.  He reached in further, his fingertips grazing something smooth.  A little stretch and he was able to grasp the wand.  When he pulled it out and looked at it, the disappointment showed on his face.
“Please, a small token of my appreciation. Lunch here isn’t quite a proper thank you. But it’s the least I can do for now.”
“I found you through your magic,” the brunet grinned.  “All I had to do was think of you and concentrate.  And suddenly, I knew exactly where you were.”
Draco shook his head.  “That’s a frightening thought.  Even as an adult.”  He paused.  “So, we have the night all to ourselves?”
“I want to,” the reticent brunet whispered. After another brief hesitation, Harry closed his eyes and stretched out his tongue.  The sensation was strange, but not unpleasant and the reward of Draco’s growl was enough to encourage him to keep going.
“She’s fine.  Sleeping like a baby.” Draco retrieved the bags he brought.  “I picked up some Yorkshire puddings, but I think you need this more.”  He took out a butterbeer and handed it to Harry.
They apparated to the Burrow and were greeted by Fleur and Victoire, playing outside with a white dog.
Trying to remain unemotional about it, Draco glanced at Harry, then his mother, then down into his teacup.
The Tower was empty when Harry arrived.  Disheartened and a bit winded from the brisk walk up many flights of stairs, Harry paused to lean against the railing and look out at the view.
Draco pointed at the parchment.  “It asks about past trouble with the law.  They could deny us because I’m a Death Eater.”
Ron shook his head.  “Hermione’s parents said it’s not good for the teeth or the, um . . .” He pointed inside his mouth.  “Here.”
“But be warned, I’m going to step it up next time.  I plan on winning the most challenges this year.”
Something in Harry snapped at seeing this.  He stepped forward and pulled presumed Pansy away from Draco. She staggered back a step or two on her stilettos.  Even through her mask, Harry could see a look of shock on her face.
“Journal,” Harry whispered to himself.  He had forgotten all about the journal Draco gave him.  He had planned to write in it his plans for the future, curious as to whether the journal would correct him.
The silence was overwhelming.  While Ron may have suspected Harry of being gay, or at least bi, he had never really seriously considered that he may have been interested in Draco Malfoy.
Harry felt shame at even suggesting to himself that Draco would deceive him in such a way.  His lover, almost lover, had been nothing but patient.  He’d let Harry take the relationship at his own pace.  And on more than one occasion, he’d left Draco frustrated.  He knew his partner was tired of sneaking around, yet he didn’t pressure Harry.  But the dreams had to mean something.
Glenda smirked. “I shouldn’t think you need worry too much about your scores.  You’re a shoo in for the Auror program.  One would almost think you needn’t bother with your N.E.W.T.s.”
The young woman appeared embarrassed. “My, um, hair color. I’ve been coloring it blonde since I was a teenager.”
Harry grabbed a cup of punch and went in the opposite direction.  He wandered around watching students dance, speaking with a few of them.  At times, he forgot how he was dressed, until he noticed one or two of the Seventh Year girls staring at his legs.  He quickly fled the area in search of a darker place to hide.
Harry showered and dressed for the day, joining Hermione and Ron in the common room before heading down to breakfast. He pulled Ron aside.
With his free hand, Draco pulled Harry to him and buried his face in Harry’s hair.  He groaned as Harry’s embrace tightened.
“He’s not ready,” Draco explained.  “And don’t any of you dare say anything.” He pointed a finger at Pansy, Blaise and Harper.
The Leaky Cauldron seemed more crowded than usual for a Sunday late afternoon as Harry, Draco, Ron and Hermione walked in.  Suddenly, Harry was second guessing his indifference to the wizarding world’s reaction to his coming out.  He froze at the entrance for a moment, as though the crowd would instantly know he and Draco had been carrying on an intimate relationship, despite the fact that they had been seen together many times before in public.
