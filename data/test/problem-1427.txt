Draco, already suspecting this, weakly mutters in a slighty sarcastic tone, “I don’t know what your talking about.”
Last night he found a book about soulmate spells in the eighth year common room, most likely left there by Hermione, and had begun to read about certain effects the spell had. His persistent headache, which Madam Pomfrey couldn’t help, was just the beginning of it all, the tip of the iceberg, so to speak.
Harry begins to walk towards the door, but as soon as his hand brushes the knob he turns back and walks to stand in front of the bathroom door.

Fuck. Fuckity fuck.
She just smirks at his expression and continues, “Don’t worry, I’m sure he doesn’t know, although he probably suspects it’s you. I mean he may be completely oblivious to everything around him, but I’m sure that he must see the symbolism of a silver, grey eyed dragon on his back.”
He scrambled to his feet and dashed off to the infirmary, not noticing how his headache had subsided.
“Well not soon enough!”
Everything was moving, everything except for the tree at his center which stood strong with its branches that rigidly curved out and around his chest, following the same path his ribs took. But everything else looked alive and followed the same rhythm as his heartbeat and breathing, the leaves swishing to and fro, the flames flickering between it all, and flowers blooming, losing their petals, and re-growing them in a matter of seconds as he drew in each breath. Then there was the dragon which followed none of these rhythms, it climbed along the tree, pushing between the branches, disturbing the leaves, never rising above his shoulders which was a no-go zone for the tattoos, the dragon with its glittering silver eyes. It’s eyes which reflected a kaleidoscope of colors from his arm, dancing as they stared back at him.
Malfoy sighs, “Granger just ran off in a tish muttering excitedly about the library, which is nothing new, and the Weasel ran with her off spouting some nonsense about dragons. Now if you could kindly sod off and leave me be.”
Draco was freeezing.
He bandages each hand carefully before cursing; he hadn’t showered yet, he’d just have to take them off again.
Draco just stares at her, sincerely dumbfounded, just beginning to realize that either she really was the brightest witch of her age or maybe he had just been an utter fool this entire time.
Draco could’ve seen his tattoo, oh god. Harry was bolt upright now with his wand in hand staring at the exposed skin beneath his sleaves.
Draco couldn’t do it.
Draco sighed deeply and hunched over under the spray of the shower and shivered; Harry had definitely been making fun of him earlier, mocking him. Then the git had the nerve to come back and pity him, Draco had almost fell for it too. He had stood, his back against the door, listening to his every word, hearing his unsteady breathing, but at the last moment he reined in his emotions and turned on the water, hoping to drive him away or at the very least block him out with the noise until class started.
Harry can feel the tension build in those few heavy seconds, those seconds in which Draco’s eyes flit through several emotions in an alarmingly short amount of time before finally settling on wonder.
He walks quickly an tries his hardest to ignore the pain prickling down his arms.
Draco smiled into his pillow and tugged up the high collar of his pajamas and begun to dream of lions and bright, green eyes.
“No! No, not what I was thinking, I just wondered why you were dressing so strangely all of a sudden.”
When Draco woke, it felt as if a hazy fog was pressing at the edge of his mind. This fog seemed to be completely independent from the rest of his mind and separate in both behavior and ideas, but it was comforting. He lazed in the comforting feeling at the edge of his consciousness and slowly became more and more aware of his surroundings.
As he continues to read he realises that he doesn’t feel that cold anymore.
There was a simple charm that George showed him that made it look like his hands were covered in burns, meant for simple pranking or skipping class, but it should be able to cover up the tattoo or at least give him an excuse to cover his hands in bandages. Harry had tried to use a disillusionment charm before, and it had done nothing, but this technically was not a variation of a disillusionment charm so it may work.
Draco stared numbly at his forearms as he watched the tattoo slowly creep back down his pale skin until it reached his wrists, the clouds stormy and gloomy and spiting tattoo rain all over his skin. Flickering light came from within the gloomy greys, as if the storm was trying to decide if it wanted to send dazzeling electric bolts dancing across his skin.
Ahhh, I apologize for taking so long and for the fact that this is so short and also because this may have errors, enjoy!
Malfoy scowls, lacking some of its regular venom, “Brilliant deduction Potter, it appears she has, although why she thinks that the two of us are less likely to cause trouble than literally any other pairing, I don’t know.”
Harry messed with the strap of his bag as he walked into the charms classroom flanked by Hermione and Ron on one side and Ginny and Luna on the other. Harry was worried about Draco and hoped he would talk to him, even if their feelings for each other weren’t mutual.
He turns to see Harry’s reaction and is not dissapointed because the dark flush on his face is quite visable despite his tan skin. Draco just smirks and gracefully slides down onto the sofa beside him, with his transfiguration book in hand, choosing to ignore Potter’s obviously flushed face and gaping mouth.
“Harry, you got hit by an unknown hex that has yet to do anything. That’s pretty bad! And have you checked to see if it had done any damage?”
On his way to the potions cabinet a large bang shakes the classroom, making his dissipating headache return to its previous severity. Harry winces then twists around to see the stunned, soot covered faces of Neville and Goyle blinking in surprise at their cauldron. He sighs and shoots a sympathetic look at Neville who is already being assaulted with barbed comments from Goyle who was most likely the cause of their massive fuck up although, judging by the guilty look on Neville’s face, it was possible he was the culprit. Neville wasn’t all that bad at potions anymore, but still wasn’t very good and when paired with Goyle, who was absolutely wretched at it, so they often had the most spectacularly terrible fuck ups.
And like that they stayed, for a good while. Finally understanding, not needing their words for the first time in a lifetime, only eachother.
Well that wasn’t good.
Then it’s nothing, then it’s everything.
He carefully examines it once more in the light and as he does the small wound miraculously closes leaving little beads of blood in a straight, uniform line. Harry blinks, he must be going mad, or had just cast a wordless, wandless, healing spell. He gives himself a shake, it didn’t matter, he had more important things to worry about, like his grades and this stupid soulmate curse. Wordlessly, he casts a cleaning spell on his thumb and the jar before strolling back to his work station where Malfoy was cradling his hand and holding his wand in the other.
Harry stood, shocked. He didn’t know what to do. Should he touch him?
She spins around to face Harry so fast that he’s afraid she might have whiplash, “Only once! Only got hexed once! Harry are you out of your mind!”
After three ungodly hours in the library Hermione, Ron, and himself determined that Harry was affected by one of three spells, one of which they’d found in a book from the restricted section with the aide of Harry’s cloak. Either a spell that animates a regular tattoo, a torture spell that caused a tattoo version of an animal to ravage it’s victim, or a spell used to reveal a ‘soulmate’. Considering the first two options were obviously impossible and the circumstance in which he had been cursed, it was definitely the soulmate spell, which was also dark magic.
“With gouges in his arm and slashes on his chest, yes I know Granger because it hurts me too.”
As they read further Harry had discovered that the Tattoo would only keep growing in size and complexity until a counter spell was uttered by the original caster, of course the spell would only work if his soulmate kissed him to seal the ‘bond’. Not only that, but it had the potential to make him go insane according to many accounts.
This was difficult to write, and I'm not sure I wrote this with the tone I originally wanted, but it's done and now I can move on to writing the next chapter. Please leave comments and kudos if you enjoyed this chapter.
After a few beats, Granger tentativly says, “Would you like to do research with me in library? I’m sure we could find more information.”
He gawked at it and then noticed the two patches of white fur on the tattoo lion and almost began to bash his head against the wall. One patch was on the beast’s head and shaped like a bolt of lightning, the other was a starburst shape on the creature’s chest. Two killing curses.
Harry frowns ignoring the barbed comment and calls after him before he can leave, “What’s with the scarf? Chilly, Malfoy?”
Harry stared after him for some time in shock. Did he really cry out? Maybe he needed to get some dreamless sleep from the infirmary. He looked at himself in the mirror for a second, debating if he should check to see how bad his tattoo had gotten, but decides that he didn’t really want to know. Instead he splashes cold water on his face and goes back to bed, managing to sleep by some miracle.
Even if Draco didn’t have a tattoo, he had to at least be thinking about what had happened outside of the bathroom.
Thank you guys for continuing to read this... it's certainly been a while.
Harry blinked and mutters “Oh.” as he pushes out of Malfoy’s way
Granger just smirks, “Don’t play dumb Draco, you can’t fool me. I’ve suspected you since the first day when he showed us the tattoo. But now I’m certain, with the way you and Harry have been acting, your stupid gloves, Harry’s fake burns, the other ridiculous clothes your wearing. It’s obvious if you’re really looking for it.”
Puzzled at the sudden strange behavior, Harry ponders if Malfoy is hiding something; he certainly seemed like it. But what could it be? Voldemort had been defeated, everything was calm, sure a few people picked on Draco, but it was nothing too serious.
I apologize for potential errors, I posted this as soon as I finished writing it.
Draco’s headache grew worse as he left the potion’s classroom and it didn’t seem to get better after a dull hour of arithmancy, if anything it grew worse. Of course, Draco ignored it, and went to the library to research soulmate curses, but when he left, it grew so painful that he began to walk to the infirmary.
Draco plunges his trembling hands into his bag and pulls on the silkly black gloves he had on earlier, thankful for them now more than ever. Draco leaves as the class ends, luckily and unfortunately, the last one of that day. He trudges down to the great hall, as if walking to his last meal before a certain execution. He barely tastes anything that passes his lips and when he leaves the great hall he can feel at least one pair of eyes boring into his back and registers that something is awfully wrong.
Harry stares at him as he leaves, wondering why he was being even more of a git than usual, but dismisses it as nothing. Harry shakes his head and quickly rushes into the showers then hitches up the back of his shirt and a lump forms in his throat as he looks at his back in shock.
(hopefully)
Before he realizes it, potions class is over and it’s off  to the rest of his day.
Harry stares straight ahead and ignores him, releasing a few calming breaths and listening to the boring, consistant drone of Slughorn’s voice as he praddles on about one of his favorite students from many years ago and how they cured some disease. Harry breathes out and smoothes down the wrinkled fabric of his robes, puposefully ignoring, Draco’s sidelong stare.
Harry’s blood ran cold, but he managed to choke out a strangled, “You seemed to handle it fine.”
It would certainly make sense, the caged way Draco was acting, his even stranger wardrobe choices, his stupid gloves in particular, and what he’s doing right now. This entire flirting business was getting out of hand, but Harry was going to change that.
He trudged into the shared dormitory and opened the chest sitting at the foot of his bed and removed his cloak, remembering how stupid he’d been to not carry it.
‘Or Potter’, indeed.
Without thinking, Draco tugged his collar up higher, just in case his tattoo had grown larger during the day and had spread up to his chin, and hissed, “Watch where you’re going, Potter!”
(See the end of the chapter for
Harry runs all the way back and as he nears the entrance of Hogwarts he almost runs straight into Draco Malfoy. Before they collide, Harry leaps out of his path and lands heavily on the cobble stones, right on his back. He winces and watches in horror as Malfoy with draws his wand with a suspicious glare before clutching at an area near his collarbones, which are covered by a green and silver scarf.
Now was his time to shine.
Also, in this chapter the word "queer" is NOT being used a slur. I would like to make that clear because  in this chapter a student uses it to refer to himself.
Without seeing her reaction Draco ran off back to his shared dorm, finding it oddly convient that McGonagall just happened to room them together, perhaps Granger had some involvement in that too. Scowling, Draco opens the door to find Harry sitting on the couch in front of the small hearth with a magazine of some sort in his hand, no doubt reading about himself. Harry didn’t even look up from his reading, until Draco shut the door behind him and he jumps with surprise.
Everything was voilently thrashing on his skin, churning and writhing in waves of relentless motion, and among it all was the dragon. It’s silver scales gleamed dully as it ripped apart brambles and vines, as it quelled flames with its mighty wings, and wherever it went tattoos shied away from its sly, cunning glare. As he watched in awe he noticed a black blur on one of its legs and several pale slashes on its chest alongside many other pale spots all over its hide.
Harry’s eyes suddenly scrunch up with concern at Draco’s chest and he looks down to see the pale skin, the pale scar-littered skin. Draco looks up, looking for disgust, hate, pity, but sees nothing but respect. Draco lets out a sigh of releif and cups the side of Harry’s face, watching the tattoos slowly burn away before tracing his hands down the tendons of his neck and latching his fingers onto the clasp of his robes.
Just as Potter began to open his mouth Draco pushed past him and slammed the door behind him, colapsing against it.
So he laid in his bed with the curtains drawn, staring up into the pitch black, willing his heart to stop pounding. Because, it wasn’t anything too serious, right? He lightly sighed into the darkness, Draco knew that wasn’t true, Draco knew that whatever happened was going to end up taking a turn for the worse.
Malfoy’s look suddenly became caged as he fiddled with his shirt sleeves and collar, which were tightly buttoned up as far as possible and said in a clipped voice, “That’s strange.”
(See the end of the chapter for
As Draco begins to shuck off his robes he hears Harry behind him, “I’m sorry you know, about what I said. I didn’t -I didn’t mean to upset you like that.”
With a flourish of his robes Draco exits the room and Harry breathes out a sigh of relief as the tightness in his chest vanishes slowly being replaced with guilt and hysteria, then chokes out a strangled gasp as something prickles at his forearm.
“You mean to tell me, that you went to Hogsmeade without the cloak? You could’ve been killed or- or worse-”
He traces the muscles, the bone, the tendons of his body, swirling closer and closer to the dragon which lies just below his clavical now, covering a good portion of the killing curse scar.
Granger light heartedly laughs a bit more before growing serious again as the silence begins to stretch, “You are going to have to do something about this, if you don’t I’m going to have to tell Harry its you.”
Harry didn’t really pay any attention to Slughorn during the lecture, it wasn’t like he was able to anyways. His mind was far to occupied with thoughts of the person sitting beside him with his face showing less emotion than a brick wall, but he had to be feeling something, had to be thinking something at the very least.
Harry is hit with a tantalizing, strong citrus scent as soon as Malfoy stops staring at Harry’s hands and face, his face contorted in an angry, pissed off scowl, but his eyes filled with a paralyzing fear. Malfoy’s glare moves back down to Harry’s hands, “How did you manage to injure yourself in your sleep, Potter!” He spat. The malice on his face makes Harry internally cringe and his insides wither up a bit. The hovering cloud of thought seemed to resemble a brewing storm, with anger, envy, fear, and a touch of admiration all swirling into a coalescing mass of emotion, too overwhelming to attempt to handle.
He rubbed at his eyes and shoved his glasses on before casting a quick tempus, which revealed it to be around three in the morning and Harry groaned softly. He’d never be able to get back to sleep at this hour! If it had been just a bit earlier or later he could’ve been spared a few fitful more hours of sleep. Sighing, Harry wordlessly cast a soft lumos and silently padded out of the dormitory and towards the bathroom. As he got ready to open the door he noticed the light was on and he frowned; surely no one was taking a shower this early.
Harry was sitting in the Headmaster’s office, a tin of biscuits open, a cup of tea sitting in front of him with wisps of steam rising from it. McGonagall was sitting across from him at the heavy oak desk, holding her own cup of tea with both incredible poise and undeniable authority, something that Harry hadn’t known to be possible before that day. Harry stares at the tin of biscuits and considers her offer, frowning to himself just a bit.
(See the end of the chapter for
Harry gives his tattoo one last withering look before he pulls on a long sleeved shirt; with only one roommate and bathroom it would be much harder to hide his tattoo. And most of all, he hoped his new roommate was someone he could get along with like Ron, but McGonagall made it clear that it was unlikely for friends to be paired and to not hope for it. He sighed again, levitating his bags and walking to his new room.
Harry gives Draco’s hand a little squeeze and quietly murmurs, “I’ve wanted to do that too.”
He had been prepared for this, just not so early. He had gloves and an excuse, but not the state of mind needed to handle this situation. He doesn’t dare take off his clothes, or look in the mirror and instead feels the fear coming from the edge of his mind. The unknown consciousness was now just as awake as he was and also panicking. He takes steady breaths and begins to undress thinking of ways to hide the tattoo if it went above his chin, makeup would be the best option, no matter how muggle, and he could put a stasis charm on it to keep it in place.
Harry whirled around, wand in hand, to face a dead-eyed Malfoy with two suitcases bobbing in the air behind him. Feeling foolish, he lowered his wand, “She roomed you with me?”
Draco was going mad. Harry Potter, his soulmate? Ha, no. But, Draco was going to expose him at some point, right after he figured out how to glamour his own tattoo. Then the idiot couldn’t hide from him.
I write dialogue faster than I thought! If you like this chapter leave me a comment or kudos, or if you're feeling especially brave shoot me an ask on Tumblr! Also, are you wondering where I got that super cheesy title from? Well, the first time I listened to "Written in The Scars" by Galantis I misheard it as "written in the stars" and as a result I now have the cheesiest title for a work on Ao3.
Harry waited a few moments his apprehension building, and then breaking when he hears running water from the showerhead signaling that he would not be talking to Draco until much later.
Somethingswrongsomethingswrongsomethingswrongsomethingswrongsomethingswrongsomethingswrong.
With nevousness and agitation fluttering in his stomach, he scowls, “Granger, what is it?”
“Well Potter, to noble to answer?” he snarls with an indistinct emotion glimmering in the depths of his storming eyes.
As he cast the charm, he felt his hands itch and soon the skin of his hands were covered in what looked like recent burn scars, with not a single part of the tattoo showing. He sighs in relief, the charm takes six hours to wear off and then he’d have to reapply it, and reaches into his trunk pulling out a roll of bandages.
Harry feels his blood run cold and dread begin to weigh at him. The haze of thought seems smug and Harry grits out, “Well, Malfoy, you sure do know a lot about magical tattoos, considering all of your experience.” Harry pointedly glares at Malfoy’s forearm and then back into his eyes.
This may be riddled with an intolerable amount of grammatical and spelling errors, I have lately been placing a lot of faith in the spell check tool.
Malfoy notices Harry’s meandering gaze and self-consciously smooths his hair down then sneers, “What are you still doing here, Potter? Trying to figure out how to tame that bird’s nest of yours?”
He walks quickly and tries to ignore his peircing headache.
He gathers up his school robes over one arm and wrenches open the door to an impatient Malfoy who immediately scrunches up his nose. His gaze slides to Harry’s wet hair then back to Harry’s eyes. Malfoy arches a brow and the corners of his lips barely move up, “Potter, are you going to move and let me shower or are you going to stand there dripping all over the carpets?”
But that wouldn’t happen, he wouldn’t be kissing Draco today, he would just be teasing him.
Malfoy seems to stand in a sort of stupor before throwing his hands up in exasperation, “Whatever, just remember it’s both of our grades.”
Harry lets out a sigh of relief before walking back up to the castle, his lower back still aching a little.
A little smile grows on his face as he steps into the spray of lukewarm water of the shower. Draco, won’t know what hit him.
Harry stops for a moment and sighs, “Yeah, probably, but the flame would have to be hot enough to boil the dragon’s blood and the mermaid tears also have to be above a certain temperature, so they don’t negatively react with the fire beetle, so...”
Draco slides his fingers between Harry’s and speaks so quietly that if one wasn’t listening they could’ve missed it, “You know, I’ve wanted to that for a while.”, the passion was obvious in his voice, if not even a little shy in a way.
Something isn’t right.
The transfigurations classroom felt like it was in the tundra and the air was cold as ice.
Draco finishes his regular morning routine sometime later with minty breath, carefully styled hair, and a cold resolve not to lose his façade of indifference today. Draco skips breakfast in the great hall altogether, not really feeling hungry and instead hurries to his first class barely noticing the tingling sensation on the backs of his hands.
He wondered what that hex had done to him.
Draco glances around at the other students, acting as if everything is normal and comes to the conclusion that it was probably just him. Well except for Potter. Potter was sitting with his outer robes removed looking rather miserable, which he deserves.
He walks quickly and tries to ignore the abnormal thrumming pounding in his ears.
Fucking Potter, always takes forever for him to fucking shower and afterwards it always smells like his stupid sweet, musky cologne afterwards. Stupid Potter.
Harry’s face heats up and he hurriedly begins to rinse the last bits of shampoo out of his hair, “I’m not playing with my prick you tosser!”
Malfoy reddens then snarls at him, “What do you mean by that?”
Draco doesn’t turn to face him and instead just sighs and carefully folds his robes before replying, “Apology accepted, Potter, although I’m sure that the copious amounts of staring in transfigurations was enough to tell me.”
With that Malfoy rushes out again, silently fuming, fists clenched.
“Potter, where were you? I almost chopped my thumb off when Goyle’s and Longbottom’s potion exploded!”
How could Potter not know?
The headache, according to his research, was most certainly not a harrold to good fortune. Almost every account of the soulmate spells recorded negative effects started with a headache. There were numerous paths the spell could take too, depending on what needed to happen to bring the soulmates together. Some of the more disturbing effects had been, temporary blindness, a forced proximity curse manifesting itself, body and gender swapping, and mind link similar to a two-way legillmency spell. None of these seemed very appealing, but the mind link seemed to be the worst. Draco did not like the idea of a complete stranger having access to his thoughts, but knowing his luck, this would be the exact effect that would manifest. Or worse someone he knew, but if it was someone he knew it couldn’t be too bad, and he knew it wouldn’t be someone who loathed him, like Potter.
What a git.
Hermione suddenly rounds on Ron and the smile vanishes, “And you! You should’ve gone with him!”
Stupid Potter, with his gourgous tousled hair, glimmering eyes, and stupid Gryffindor kindness.
He sees the street ahead split into two paths ahead and begins to swerve to his right when a hex hits the small of his back. He lets out a gasp of pain and surprise before casting a disillusionment charm on himself, leaving the confused horde screaming behind him as they try to find him.
Harry was not feeling so great by the time he made it to potions. It was after lunch and he had a pretty bad headache, which would only get worse when he had to deal with Malfoy.
Draco slowly removes his robes, then his shirt, his touch leaving small bursts of red, orange, and green all over Harry’s skin. Draco traces his fingers over his ribs, down his sterum, then down to his naval, causing a shudder to run through Harry’s body as his fingertips barely skate over his toned midsection. The tattoos turn to color then nothing fading away until only his tan skin remains. As the tree at his center slowly fades Draco notices the mark that the killing curse left over his heart. This one in starburst shape spreading outwards towards the bottom of his ribcage. Draco traces the outline of it and watches the tattoos melt away. Draco watches as a dull, grey dragon slinks into veiw with even paler patches of skin criss-crossing over it’s flank.
“Er, well, no, bu-“
If you have noticed I changed the title from "Written in the Stars" to "Written in the Scars", make of that what you will and enjoy!
Harry stared a few moments too long, his heart wrenching, his stomach churning, swallowing back the lump of something painful in his throat. He realeased the shaky breath he was unaware he was holding in and sat down beside Draco who looked as unaffected as ever, who didn’t even look slightly bothered by any of this.
As the lesson finally came to a screetching halt after another half an hour of a tedious lecture Draco began to quickly pack away and head for the door, but before he could exit he was cornered by Granger.
The haze suddenly grows bone-chillingly cold and tendrils of ice meet the metaphorical storm in his mind, Malfoy’s glare pierces through him as he takes a few deliberate steps towards Harry, “You think you know me, don’t you? You think that my marks define me?” he hisses, voice rising. Malfoy is now towering over Harry’s sitting position barely on the edge of screaming, hatred seething from his voice, whether directed towards Harry or himself he doesn’t know, “You think that every mark and scar that covers my body is a reflection of myself? You think that I wanted the mark, your slashes across my chest, countless scars I received in my own home? You think I wanted to become this?” Malfoy gestures over his lean frame, darkened eyes, “If you think I wanted any of this, any of this bias, any of the torture then perhaps you should take a closer look in the mirror, Potter. Because while you may love your scars and all of their attention, I most certainly do not love my own.”
Like that, the spell was broken, Harry surged forward and carefully rolled Draco over so that he was face up and gasped in shock.
Draco smirks as Harry swallows and looks away, obviously embarassed, “Calling me cold hearted? How flattering, Potter. And anyways, I don’t believe you, there is no way you can’t be freezing right now.”
On his chest something sharp and pointy had cleanly sliced through his skin, but no remnants of what had done it were showing on his skin. The tree was shudering and the leaves were madly swirling with an invisible breeze, and the flames were absolutely roaring; it was a terrifying sight, his tattoo.
(See the end of the chapter for
Harry smirks, “No, but why do you keep returning? Did something you eat disagree with you?”
Just then Harry sees Draco barely glance up from his book and then back down and then he bites his lip.
And he was so easy to read! He had absolutely no tact or subtlety about anything, whether it be talking to Draco or sneaking ‘covert’ glances at him in class. Right at the moment Harry turns around slightly and glances at him out of the corner of his eye; the stupid tactless idiot looking at him with so much concern and caring and-
Shit. What did he mean by that? “Er, its just that you seem to be trying to cover up more, that’s all. I mean first it was the scarf over a regular shirt and now you’ve got your shirt buttoned up to your throat.”
Harry’s fingers are hesitant and fleeting over every part of Draco’s skin. His fingertips barely brushing over him like butterfly kisses, leaving trails of color in their wake, then behind that little patches of pale white skin, contrasting with Harry’s wandering hands. Draco looks up at Harry’s face as he traces the lines of his icy insides, he stares at the half of his face covered in color, the half with emerald vines twisting about, the half with swirling ruby flames. Every part of Harry was so lively, everything about him was alive, moving, breathing, living, growing. It was like looking into the eyes of a god; even his green iris’ seemed to swirl with color as they stared into Draco’s own.
Draco cuts her off, “Granger, seeing as how both of those options are terrible, couldn’t I just be his friend for the time being or literally anything else with him other than romantically involved? I mean, all the spell requires is contact of some kind or at least companionship to keep it from worsening.”
“Nothing.” Nothing is wrong with him, its not the stupid curse, its just a coincidence. “What’s with the shirt?” he blurts out.
Just as he reaches this realization, Harry’s eyes widen more and he quickly wrenches his hand away and roughly runs his hand through his hair and mutters, “You really do feel freezing.”
“Great! Yeah, I’ll uh, make sure to do that!”
Oh, and of course just as he was ready to leave Potter had to show up, nearly scaring him to death with his wild hair and general disarray. Honestly, Potter should have better sense than to sneak up behind people in mirrors! Draco shivers as he remembers the Sectumsempra incident; he still couldn’t bear the sight of the long slashes on his chest.  Potter’s marks all over his chest, countless other scars from numerous Death Eaters, the dark mark that hadn’t faded completely, and now this. Too many people had left their mark on Draco, he may not know who had left this most recent one, but he hoped that whoever did payed for it.
With a steady, yet hesitant hand, Draco barely touches the flank of the dragon, watching as it’s dull grey scales burst into a shimmering irredescant silver, each one individually reflecting the color from the rest of his tattoos. He can hear Harry’s sigh of content and his muscles untense even more. He has both of his hands on Harry now and he runs them down the sides of his body, starting from the place where his hipbones jut out and moving up until Draco is just barely tracing Harry’s collarbones. Harry realeases a small hum of happiness and cups Draco’s shoulder, pulling him even more flush towards his body, until Draco is so close that he can see the individual flecks of gold in his green eyes.
A brief pain flashed behind his eyes and he quickened his pace to the infirmary and collided with a very frantic Potter, falling back onto the floor.
It could never happen, and it never will.
“I, uh, no, um… I don’t know. I just woke up with my hands burning so I healed them, I just have to keep them wrapped until the scars go away.”
Sorry I've been gone for so long, I really like what I have written so far and I want to finish this, so I will be trying!
slight tw for scars, mentions or past tortue, and past self harm.
Harry’s lips are moving against his in some unknown rhythm, perfectly timed, never missing a beat as his mouth moves against his. His lips are agonizingly soft and slightly chapped, warm and perfect, slightly clumsy as their noses bump, but so unimaginably perfect. Then just when Draco can’t imagine it getting better Harry’s tongue tentatively touches his bottom lip and he moans. His senses are on overload, overloaded with Harry, with the little breathy sounds he makes, with his soft springy hair running through his fingers as he cradles his head, with his scent, his taste.
Harry smirks, “Malfoy, was that a compliment I heard, from you?”
Draco had no clue what was happening, and it terrified him to think that something was out of his control again.
Malfoy’s face hardens and he snarls, “It’s none of your business why I do things and why do you care all of a sudden?” Draco evilly smirks, “it’s almost as if you want to see as much of me as you can.”
The black lion, with its emerald eyes, was sporting a pair of goddamned antlers.
Potter rubbed at his temples and groaned, “Malfoy.”
Harry stepped forward, knowing he was about to regret what he was about to say, “Look, it’s alright! I didn’t get hurt and I was only hexed once!”
Draco gestures to Harry’s arm and he looks down to see a very thin trail flames flickering down his bicep, moving with the same rhythm as before when they roiled and writhed like a giant serpent. Harry looked away from the tattoo, cursing himself that someone saw it, even if they didn’t know what it was, and cursing the fact that it was Malfoy. The one person who would gladly sell his every secret to the media just for kicks, but Malfoy doesn’t seem malicious, merely curious.
He stares at the shower rack in front of him and jumps when he hears muffled banging on the door and the irritated voice of Malfoy, “Hurry up and stop playing with your prick! I need to take a shower before tomorrow Potter!”
Harry doesn’t turn, but he can feel Malfoy’s eyes on him from the doorway as he begins to unpack a few of his things. When he does chance a look the blond has an expression of confusion stuck on his face and he was fiddling with the collar of his shirt which was buttoned snugly up to his chin. Draco stared at him for a few seconds longer before jutting his chin out and strutting into the bathroom, shutting the door behind him with an audible click.
It had taken him two hours to work up enough courage to admit what happened and he was regretting it. He winced as Hermione told him off, but then again, he deserved it. Ron spared him a sympathetic glance as he dealt with Hermione’s wrath.
“Arghh!”
Harry hesitated as his hand hovered over the doorknob, and he pushed the door open.
He frowns to himself as Granger elbows Harry and whispers something in his ear that makes him flush even deeper than before and start looking at his shoes like they’re the most interesting things in the world.
He was in his new room shared with the golden boy himself and lacking even more in privacy than the dorms. He rubbed the sleep out of his eyes and yawned quietly, but stopped when he saw his hands.
“Harry!”
Granger shoots him a distrustful glance and whispers something to the blissfully oblivious Weasley, who barely turns to scowl at him.
Malfoy’s eyes clouded over with some unrecognizable emotion and he snarls, “Why would I have nightmares? I’m not like you, Potter! Always crying out loud every night, honestly I can’t ever get any sleep!”
“It’s no excuse.”
Without speaking she just grabs him by his robes and pulls him outside, casting a silencing charm.
He leaps around the corner hoping to lose them in the Hog’s Head and curses his own stupidity. How could he had been so daft as to leave without his cloak?! McGonagall had been quite clear about what could happen if Harry decided to return to Hogwarts for ‘eighth year’ but he decided he could handle the masses as long as he scored well on his Newts. When McGonagall had realized his mind was set, she told him that it would be a good idea to keep his invisibility cloak with him at all times in case he needed to make a quick getaway.  Harry now realized the flaw in his brilliant idea of going to Hogsmeade when he assumed it would be safe without his cloak.
Looking back on it he had been very wrong.
He’s been standing here for a minute now, a minute of silence, “Potter, will you fucking hurry-“
Granger let go of his robes and swirled around to face him just outside the classroom, her face deadly serious, “I know, Malfoy, and don’t pretend you don’t know what I’m talking about.”
Lazily sprawled along the length of his collar bones was a very messy looking black lion, with what appeared to be streams of water and storm clouds surrounding it. This had been rather terrifying, so Draco naturally panicked thinking that someone obviously cursed of hexed him. He had casted Finite which did nothing, so moved on to trying to cover it up with a glamour, which in retrospect had not been a great idea. The glamour simply seemed to awaken the tattoo lion, causing it to open it’s emerald eyes and playfully claw its way down his chest leaving a trail of running water and storms in it’s wake before going back to ‘sleep’.  This theoretically wouldn’t have been a problem if the tattoo hadn’t insisted on expanding over his skin as he slept. When he had been shocked awake by yet another nightmare, he took the time to look at how it seemed to expand over his skin. Now a band of tattoos wrapped around his shoulders and a little under his neck, that constantly moved and writhed all over his skin. In the thick of it all was the lion, snoozing away as water brimmed over his collarbones and storms pressed at his ribs. It really couldn’t have gotten worse, but he was wrong.
Part 2:
And as unsettling as a giant tattoo appearing out of nowhere seemed, it was a hundred times worse when apparently the same thing happened to someone else, someone else that just happened to be Harry Fucking Potter.
Please comment! I love reading them and they make me feel good.
His eyes travel down his chest and land on his tattoo, his beautful tattoo, the tattoo which writhes on his skin swirling in masses of orange and green around the centre of the design.  In the centre, which was shimmering starkly against his dark skin, was a dragon. A dragon with long limbs and sleek scales, a dragon with skin that seemed to cling to it’s frail bones, a dragon scattered with scars and a single evil blur on its arm. A dragon so marked and pitiful that it seemed to be the most pathetic looking thing on Potter’s skin. It seemed so pale and lifeless among the flames and flowers; it seemed to be leeching the life from everything around it.
Ron just nods and goes back to listening to Seamus, but Hermione stares at him for a few moments, her eyes occasionally flicking back towards the great hall entrance. She seems to come to a conclusion of sorts and nods to herself, “Well, remember to study, after all it’s never too early to study for the NEWT exams!”
At the sink stood the last person he expected to run into at this hour. He stood stone still, at the sink, knuckles white against the porcelain, hair and clothes ruffled, eyes intense as he stared at his own reflection with a look of malice. His face looked even more gaunt than usual, his eyes had dark circles under them, and his breath came in ragged short puffs as he fought whatever his silent battle was. Harry stands in the doorway waiting for Malfoy to move, for this calm before the storm to break, or rather this taut tension to spring back and hit him in the face like a rubber band.
‘Animus Requaero, commonly known as the soulmate spell or “Soul Seeker” is an old spell that is almost never used and is currently banned by the ministry of magic. The spell, when cast, causes an animated magical tattoo to appear that represents the person’s soulmate, or most compatible match for them. This spell not only affects the person its originally casted upon, but will also cause the soulmate to receive a unique tattoo as well, even when never exposed to the spell, or even the person it was cast upon. The spell will also force the two soulmates together by almost any means necessary, which is the reason it is now banned.’
Draco doesn’t quite realise whats happening until the rough pad of Harry’s thumb is being dragged along his bottom lip, and a ragged breath escapes him.

This part, and more parts in the future, will be a lot shorter. Most of the time my goal is to post chapters that are 6,000-7,000 words long, but after staring at a word doc for more than three months simply being overwhelmed with writing anything that long, I have decided to write chapters that are only between 3,000-4,000 words long. This way I may not burnout like last time and maybe even update more often. I hope most of you guys managed to stick around this long!
Harry silently thanks himself for using the disillusionment charm and holds his breath, heart racing. Malfoy, scowling with a fearful glint in his eye, swallows as his gaze sweeps right over the area where Harry sat, still as death. Malfoy stands for a few moments longer before putting his wand away and walking down to Hogsmeade.
Harry, met with the sudden wave of heat, strips off his outer robes in favor of the t-shirt underneath and lays his outer robe in his chair. As he begins to prepare the other ingredients he notices Malfoy staring at him and glances at his bicep, wondering if the tattoo returned before sighing in relief.
She just sighs, “Then you know how important it is to just tell him or if you’re not interested in him just kiss him one day out of the blue and pretend this never happened. Although if you kiss him right now he is likely to hex you or punch you or-“
Harry yanks up his shirtsleeve on the way to the washroom and stares at his tattoo. A vine, more specifically a bramble, was prickling at his skin and three clean droplets of blood had welled up where the tattoo thorns had gauged his skin. The prickling vine had broken from under his own skin, leaving a terrible gash; he stares in horror and shudders as the plant disappears under his skin, fading back into ink.
(Little warning, towards the end the grammar will get progressively worse as I rushed to finish)
That would potentially, no definitely, become a problem.
He barely hears the little sound that Draco makes, and reaches out to gently cup Draco’s cheek in his hand, fascinated with the way the tattoos burst into color and then dissapate into nothingness before his very eyes. He carefully runs his hand down Draco’s jaw, under his chin, barely brushing the bottom of his lips with his thumb. He watches the storms, the water, the tattoo turn to color then fade to nothing, but before he can continue Draco’s eyes snap open.
(See the end of the chapter for
He didn’t even have room to doubt, his soulmate was Harry Fucking Potter.
After another moment of bliss, so agonizingly short, he pulls away, face flushed, lips numb, breathing a little harder than before. Harry is breathing hard, his hair ruffled, and looking absolutely wrecked for Draco, his eyebrows drawn together just slightly, and the want, the caring, the love, is written on his face clearer than anything else Draco has seen before in his life.
Harry decided to ignore it and instead lifted his shirt and twisted around to look at the tattoo and frowned. Over the past minute a few more vines had sprouted and the smoke coming from the dragon’s snout seemed to be denser. A strange idea popped into Harry’s mind as he examined the tattoo again, in earnest. The school’s motto, as Harry remembered, said ‘never tickle a sleeping dragon’, but why? What would happen if he did? The repercussions couldn’t be that bad for a tattoo dragon.
Malfoy didn’t notice him for a few moments, but when he did the innocent serene expression was replaced with one of loathing, “What do you want, Potter?”
“Oh so you think that-“
Harry nodded, “Did you have a nightmare?” and was suddenly struck with the peculiarity of this entire situation. Of being up at this hour having a civil conversation in the bathroom with Malfoy.
He was beginning to convince himself it wasn’t the soulmate spell and Potter’s lack of a tattoo was certain.
Draco’s thoughts flashback to earlier in the restrooms where he had stopped and looked at his chest, it had been terrible, surreal, terrifying.
Draco sneers and puts his wand away as his eyes move to Harry’s arm, “Well I’m not your babysitter. What’s that?”
Granger gives him a strange look, “Well yes, the spell works off proximity and emotion coupled with skin to skin contact, however since it was made for pureblood purposes in a time where skin to skin contact was scandelous, you could easily just be near him and treat him with hospilitiy instead of actually touching him. In “A Complete Guide to Dark Love Spelles” I read that if you become closer to the actual goal of the spell its effects will lessen even if you don’t kiss.”
Draco frowns, “I read something similar to that, but it mentioned that it would only work for the tattoo problem,  not the other interesting side effects that go along with the spell.”
Potion’s class wasn’t all that bad, Harry was actual pretty good at potions and always got decent marks on everything, it’s just that he didn’t really have a passion for it, or really appreciate Malfoy jabbering away about how he was messing up their potion by not following the instructions to a tee.
“I’m completely serious, although its lack of spectacles dissapoints me to no end.”
Draco just stands there holding his breath, for a second completely at a loss for words before unsteadily saying, “Well, it can’t be more obvious than a black lion with antlers and a lightning bolt scar.”
A slight pink colors Malfoy’s cheeks and he rolls his eyes, pointing one slender finger at Harry’s sopping hair, “Your hair, Potter.”
This was the thought that ran rampant through his mind as he sprinted away from a gaggle of girls and boys wielding wands, love potions, and scraps of assorted parchment for him to sign. Harry’s breath came in short huffs as he fought to put distance between himself and the stampede and he would’ve apparated if he wasn’t so tired, but he didn’t want to risk splinching himself. It wasn’t that he was out of shape, it was the fact that after running for fifteen minutes being chased by an ever-growing pack of pre-pubescent, hormonal teenagers with nothing to lose, just happened to be quite draining.
Draco felt clueless. He felt like he had all of the pieces of the puzzle he was trying to solve, but just couldn’t fit them together properly and didn’t have any picture or clues to guide him. All Draco had were heaping multitudes of blank and broken pieces and if he couldn’t fit them together soon he was going to start forcing them into place and shoving them in places where they didn’t fit or belong.
Malfoy arches one perfect brow, “What has you all choked up?”
Bites his fucking lip.
He sighs and his head droops, as he shuffles dejectedly out of his shared room and down to the great hall for breakfast.
Harry feels a searing pain behind his eyes and winces, before noticing Draco’s quick effiecient stride as he leaves the great hall. Harry feels small pinpricks running down his arms and his stomach flips.
Harry grits his teeth, “Malfoy, I’m crushing it so more beetle juice mixes into the potion before the solid parts, that way it can react with the dragon’s blood quicker and we’ll have even more time to stir it before it can congeal.”
It’s the wonder that Harry sees when Draco reaches up with one hand to cradle Harry’s cheek, it’s the amazement he sees when Draco’s eyes widen just a fraction, it’s the beauty he sees when Draco’s face is finally openly displaying what he feels. It’s something stirring in his chest waiting to explode when he realizes that Draco doesn’t feel uncomfortable being near Harry anymore.
Overnight, his tattoo had taken over the entirety of his back and begun to lace over his ribcage and down his hips, but had completely shied away from his arms and neck. Not even a single tattoo-leaf had remained on his arms and as he slept the dragon had moved down to the small of his back, right above his arse.
It's been a while, huh?
“Hmmm, maybe not, but it can’t be healthy for you to stare at a single point for so long.” Malfoy shrugs his robes off and drapes them over his chair, revealing a black dress shirt with it’s collar buttoned up as high as it would go, and turns back towards the cauldron to examine their potion. “Well would you look at that, Potter hasn’t ruined the potion. What a delightful surprise.”
“Watch it, Potter.”
“But, ‘Mione I didn’t even know he left!”
He came to the door of his and Draco’s shared room and wrentched the door open to find him draped over Harry’s bed, like he had just passed out there.
Harry watched as Ron, standing behind Hermione, mouthed to him ‘expelled!’ and Harry fought the urge to laugh as Ron grinned.
Draco sighs, if there was one good thing about the soulmate tattoo, it had to be that it covered all his scars. Although, the replacement hadn’t been much of an improvement.
Harry James Potter had defeated lord freaking Voldemort, yet couldn’t seem to handle a stroll through Hogsmeade.
Granger looks sheepishly at the ground, “Well, yes, but the tattoo is reactive to the proximitive state between a pair of soulmates, while any other effects purely rely on emotional health as well as any other thoughts and feelings towards the partner.”
Two days and nights had passed, and his problem had worsened.
As Harry lifts up the back of his shirt he hears Hermione gasp and Ron weakly mumble, “Bloody hell.”
Draco glanced up at Potter’s smirk, and thought that maybe he did. Maybe Potter knew, knew just how pathetic he was and was taunting him. Of course he knew, he had seen what Draco was really like, he had seen him. Potter’s smug smirk faltered for a moment, but was quickly replaced with a grin.
Harry flopped down on his bed and let out a puff of air, running his hand through his wet hair. Showering had given Harry time to think, but it did little to help the jumbled mess of ideas in his head.
Harry snaps out of his trance and scowls at him before taking the glass stirring rod from him, “I was not drooling.” He muttered.
“You just woke up with them? Kind of like how a magical tattoo just appeared on your arm, right?” Malfoy growls.
As he undresses he notices something strange about his tattoo; all of the designs on his right arm, from the elbow down, were in color. The fire was roaring among the green leaves in different shades of red and orange along with flickering tongues of blue flames, and all of the designs along his body absolutely writhed. He stared a moment absolutely transfixed on the marks, he rushed to look at himself in a mirror and when he did it absolutely took his breath away.
"Who have you got your eye on?"
Harry took off at a sprint across the field, not stopping until he ran out of breath outside the Great Hall.
Draco must have dozed off, worn out, because when he woke he was alone in his bed, and he could hear clattering in his kitchen. He pulled on a pair of boxers and walked out of his room to find Harry bent over, rummaging through his cupboards. He leant against the doorway with a smirk. "Well isn't this a nice view."
“That’s great, Harry.” Draco smiled genuinely, before his gaze fell over Harry’s shoulder. “I’ll come over later to see how he is, okay?” Draco flicked his eyes just over Harry’s shoulder.
“You want to speak to us?” Granger raised an incredulous eyebrow.
Draco pushed his chair back with a screech, his gaze steely. "This was a mistake, Potter. I appreciate you asking me to lunch, but I'm afraid I must get back to the shop." He stood, grabbing his coat from the back of his chair.
“Any particular reason?” Harry looked at Draco blankly. “For naming your snake after me.” He elaborated.
“Of course. I thought you knew?” Andromeda frowned, looking at the two.
"You'll see." Luna chirped, looping her arm round his.
Harry still had him pressed against the wall, the close proximity only adding to the fire he held inside. “What the fuck are you doing with Neville?”
Draco smiles broadly at Harry’s own small grin. “At least you’re smiling now.”
"I did, sweetheart. Your dancing always cheers me up." She smiled fondly at him before narrowing her eyes. "I expect a full report tomorrow. I want all the salacious details of you and Potter."
Draco rushed on, not wanting to lose sight of the moody Gryffindor.  He caught Harry by the arm and he whipped around, unshed tears in his eyes. He pushed the Slytherin away, but Draco refused to let go, instead using the energy from the shove to pull the two together.
Draco thought about the inky curls on Teddy’s head not two minutes ago. "Was he just here?"
A 6 year old Draco leaned over the edge of the boat excitedly, pointing down at the water. "Look, mummy! The fish! They're so bright, red and blue and green and yellow and-"
“Problem solved? This creates a million more problems!”
So let me leave you with this, Potter: I feel so many things for you, and none of them can be resolved, or come to fruition. This is my attempt at goodbye. This is my attempt at starting anew. -
“Yeah, she’s right.”
“I’ll need to meet this owl. I need to know more about their condition before I can begin the potion making process." Malfoy ran one hand through his hair as he leaned back. He looked straight out of a magazine.
“Do you know what I think, Potter?” He whispered, inching closer until his breath danced across Harry’s lips. “I think-” he paused, leaning into Harry’s ear. “- that you liked what you saw in the showers.”
“So now he thinks you’re with me. Problem solved.”
Draco sat down, gripping the arms of the chair tightly. Moors frowned and clasped his hands on the desk in front of him.
It came in phases. For the first term, Draco Malfoy was quiet and reserved, giving apologies to almost everyone in their year who had returned, and keeping out of the way the rest of the time. The first few weeks it was like he was trying to disappear altogether.
"Ex- death eater. He's changed. He regrets what he's done."
Draco chuckled again. Who knew it would be so easy to talk to his ex-enemy? Sure, they hadn’t been at each other’s necks in a long time now, but still, banter? It was enough to make one’s head reel. “Let’s just say that there’s someone here tonight that I’d like to avoid.”
“So you really haven’t noticed?” Andy said as she returned, passing him his tea.
Malfoy took a step closer, not letting go of Harry’s arm. “It’s been a week since we last argued, which must be the longest we’ve ever gone.” He smirked. “I haven’t even apologised to you yet.”
As Harry chopped the peppers, he let his mind wander back to earlier that day. It had gone so much better than he had expected. After the first half an hour, Malfoy and him had fallen into an easy rhythm. Draco would fetch the potions whilst Harry worked the till, and if the customer wanted a personalised potion, Harry would jot down notes as Draco asked them questions.
“You want to know what’s going on, jolie garcon (pretty boy)?” Draco hissed, spinning around. “What’s going on is that I can’t do this. I can’t sit here, with you, playing make-believe, when I should be in fucking Azkaban for all my bad judgements and misdeeds and cowardice and betrayal! I can’t sit here knowing how fucking awful I am, and sit next to the most perfect, most handsome, most bloody brilliant wizard to ever exist!”
Harry sat up to look at him, reaching forward to pull on a piece of Draco’s hair. “Of course I’m excited, it’s our six month anniversary.”
-----
“Exactly! Poor woman, it’d be like their wedding night all over again.”
“Draco, you have to let me sign this paper.” Harry chuckled. “Move.” He whispered the last word in parseltongue, and the white corn snake reluctantly shifted out of the way so that he could give his signature. Harry had named the snake as such because of it’s naughty nature, much like it’s human counterpart in eighth year. By the time they had reached the end of the year, the slytherin seemed like a completely different person.
Potter signaled to the waiter and ordered the same for himself. “You seemed in quite a rush.” He said nonchalantly.
"Come for me, Draco," Harry whispered, and Merlin's tits, who was Draco to say no to that. He fucked him harder, panting, but it was the face Harry was making that tipped him over.  The sight of Harry Potter underneath him, dark curls stuck to his forehead, lips parted in ecstasy as he chased his own orgasm, was one Draco knew he would never forget.
_-_-_-_ -_-_-_-_
Draco grimaced internally. What was he doing? He shouldn’t be so obvious about his emo-
"So it's my fault?" The gryffindor accused.
19th May 2001
"Wait, Potter?"
"Stop being right." The darker man grumbled, his hazy gaze landing on a group of people at the end of the street. "Is that..?"
Draco shook his head with disbelief. “This is not how I thought things would go tonight.”
“Good Afternoon, Malfoy.” Harry said, pulling his scarf down as the woman left. He could make out Sylvia napping on a large cushion behind the counter. Now he was here, he could feel his nerves starting to flutter in his stomach.
Maybe not. Harry scrambled away, and Draco turned to face him. He almost looked… hurt. The Gryffindor rubbed at his head, and nodded to the glass on his nightstand. “Can I have that?”
"How's your day been?" Ron called, pulling out a chair for his fiancé before sitting himself down. He acciod a pint glass.
"Fuck, Malfoy, is that… is that what I did to you?" his voice cracked a little. That night in the bathroom, Potter had scarred him for life, literally. Draco felt no anger about it, he could still remember the horror on Potter's face as Draco fell to the floor in a pool of his own blood. He hadn't meant it, he knew that.
“Don’t worry about it.” Draco nodded over to Pansy and Luna. “Pansy is a bad influence on the best of days.”  He looked behind him and Harry followed his gaze to a small stone archway on the edge of the party. “Come on, let’s get away from all this-" He gestured with his hand, "-shit.”
“He’s witty. Like me.” Draco smirked.
“I’ve made some new friends - that’s what you said. What about us? Why didn’t you mention that we were six months deep into a relationship?” Harry couldn’t keep the hurt from his voice, and he could slowly feel the anger creeping in as well.
“Dinner, is it? I thought you were offering lunch.” Draco smirked at Potter, loving the way he was so easily riled. He ignored his french remark - as if he’d stop. His mother had often spoken french around him as a child, as his own grandmother was french. He hadn’t found it very useful before, but now his mother had moved to France, she rarely spoke english to him, so he found himself using it more and more these days. Pansy said it made him sound sexy.
"I love you too, Draco."
“I’m serious mate, it was weird as fuck, but for some reason, I believe him.” Ron looked almost frazzled, his eyes wide as he plopped down on the sofa beside Harry. The common room was reasonably quiet for a weekday evening.
He shook himself out of it as the server pushed their drinks towards them, he was going to end up making a complete fool out of himself, he could feel it. “It doesn’t matter.” Draco murmured, taking a sip of his drink. The familiar burn warmed his throat and eased his nerves.
------
“Did you forget I’m the one who stood up to Voldemort?” Neville raised an eyebrow.
“I wish I knew what you were thinking.” The blond whispered, and Harry dragged his eyes from his lips up to his eyes to find them watching him sadly.
“As you say, master.” Kreacher bowed with a disgruntled look, backing out of the room.
“Potter, wait.” Draco said, seeing that he was about to take off. “Please, just..just wait.”
“Next?” Malfoy tilted his head slightly. They remained unmoved. This was the closest Harry had been to him in nearly a week, and he found he almost missed the proximity. This was also the first time, in maybe ever, that the two had been so close without shouting. No wonder Harry’s heart was racing. He must’ve been anxious for the fighting to begin.
“Of course, master.” The elf disappeared with a pop as Harry trotted down the stairs, pausing to grab his shoes from the entrance way. The ground floor was pretty useless these days, the large dining room now used as a storage room for all the old furniture, as well as a cot that Harry had bought in case Teddy ever needed to stay. The entrance hall was once again grand and elegant (if you ignored all of Harry’s battered trainers scattered by the front door). The paintings had all been taken down, as had the elf heads, and the walls had been given a fresh lick of paint. Harry found the library welcoming, but didn’t spend much time in there, preferring the lounge - especially since it was so close to his room.
“Not least, the fact that I can’t dance.”
“I know. Draco came and observed him for hours the other day, and Paeson even let me borrow one of the other owls to demonstrate.” Harry sighed again, holding open the door for Ron before they made their way back downstairs. “I’d hoped it would go away with time, but apparently not.”
“You know I’m right. When am I not?”
Harry snorted. “Great apology, I’m sure the insults will help get me back.”
“Apologised?” It was Hemione who asked this time.
“Sap.”
Thank you, for giving me that chance. I wish it could have been for longer. I wish we could have longer together.
"What are you thinking?" Potter asked, squinting intently at the laminate.
They kissed like that for a few minutes, mouths hungry and hands wandering. Finally, Harry pulled away.
Pansy smirked at him, picking up her wine glass. "I shall leave you two to it then."
Draco followed, his tall stance and cool looks hiding the knotted ball in his stomach. Was Harry Potter really about to buy him a drink? He wondered if Pansy could see him, pictured the shocked smirk on her face. She’d no doubt pester him for every single detail later, and there was no doubt he’d spill them all. If there was any of course; maybe Potter would just pass him his drink and leave.
Fuck, what was he going to do?
"So that's a yes?" Draco couldn't help but smirk at the way Potter perked up.
“I brought donuts.” He raised the bag at her and she grabbed it from him with a smile.
Draco huffed back a laugh. “I thought you said I was still a cock?”
“That’s no way to greet a customer.” Potter said, fiddling with a sleeping potion that a previous customer had left at the desk.
He mentally shook off the unneeded emotion, putting on his well-practiced professional tone. “Ah yes. I have to warn you, it will cost you quite a bit as the ingredients took a lot for me to acquire.”
-----
Draco looked up from the book cradled in his lap as a sobbing Pansy Parkinson practically fell out of his fireplace. He was up in an instant, book discarded, and wrapping his arms around his best friend.
All he had wanted to do was have a nice lunch, get to thank Malfoy properly. He hated to admit it, but with all his free time, He often found himself thinking about the people he didn't see. And yes, that was mainly Malfoy. Was it so bad to want to have a catch up? Why did Malfoy have to make everything so difficult?
“Because you’re good at teaching people and making them believe in themselves?” The herbology teacher took a bite of his jam-laden toast.
Snake-Draco looked almost smug. Merlin, he really was living up to his name.
“I think we’d better change the conversation before you find yourself in my bad books, Monsieur Malfoy.” Pansy raised her brows at him, sipping her drink.
"Draco?" Harry held him, horror painted across his features as Draco wheezed and sputtered, blood dripping from his lips. "Draco!" He looked around frantically. "Help! Someone help!" The waitress came out, before darting back inside with shouts in French.
The man, who had been making his way over, stopped in his tracks as Harry turned to him. “You never said you had a boyfriend.”
“Shit.” Harry hissed in parseltongue, his eyes wide.
Draco surged forwards, until he was only inches away from Pansy, and touched her face just like Potter had done to him, palm against cheek, thumb brushing away an invisible smudge of soot.
“You’re impossible.”
Draco didn’t reply, pulling Harry back into the alcove instead. He pressed the other boy up against the wall, leaning in close. “I do.”
Draco had tucked the note under Potter's hand before laying a blanket over him and heading back up to his room. Potter had smiled at him that morning at breakfast, and Draco had nodded back, hurrying out of the Great Hall with butterflies in his stomach.
“Guys, if you’d let me finish?” Harry put his hand on Ron’s shoulder to get his attention.
His pearly companion trotted ahead of him, her collar jingling excitedly as she jumped on the counter with her loudest meow so far that morning. “Yes, yes. I know, Sylly. You’d think I’d been starving you.” He tutted at her, offering her a condoling scratch under the chin. He made his way through the door behind the counter, the cat flap sounding just behind him. The back of the shop was equal in size to the front; comprised of the stock room, brewing room and la chambre cozy (the cozy room). The first two were through to his left, and he stood in the latter, waving his wand absentmindedly at the kettle as he searched for the cat biscuits. He topped up the bowl before hanging up his coat.
The next few weeks passed in a blur. Harry dedicated his spare time to tackling the upper rooms of Grimmauld Place, feeling more energised and motivated than usual. The second floor housed what was once the grand bedroom and its accompanying private sitting room and ensuite, as well as two other spare rooms and a bathroom. The third floor housed Sirius’ and Regulus’ old rooms and their shared bathroom as well as the two smallest spare rooms and another bathroom. The whole place was huge, far too big for just him, but when he had mentioned this to his friends as they caught up over a pint, they reminded him of all the potential it had. He was currently tossing around ideas of Teddy’s own room, a games room, maybe even a home cinema.
By the time Flitwick dismissed them ten minutes later, Harry felt like he might explode. He rushed to grab his things, waiting outside the classroom and waving off Hermione and Ron. He would talk to them later. He knew that Malfoy was almost always last to leave, and he watched as Parkinson and Zabini strolled ahead in conversation. Perfect.
“In your dreams.” Pansy scoffed, placing her own empty glass on the coffee table. “I’m going to grab some parchment. Top me up too.”
Harry stopped, turning back to face him. “Why would I do that?” Malfoy finally looked at him. Harry lowered his voice, taking a step closer. “I don’t hate you, Draco.” He licked his lips, terrified of what he was about to say. “It was nice to know you’ve been thinking about me, too.”
Harry snorted. “That’s rich coming from the bloke who’s so in love with his own voice that he makes the whole year suffer with it.”
"I'm afraid there's been a mistake, Mr Malfoy." He paused to look up at Draco, who swallowed thickly. "You were told that it looked as though you had two months." He cleared his throat and Draco thought that he might throttle him with all his dramatic pauses. "There was an error in the report. It was supposed to say two weeks."

"Draco Lucius Malfoy. You stop right there." Harry demanded. Draco spun around, confused. "I never said, no."
"So is everyone, doesn't mean I can't try and charm my best friend," she winked at him and Draco smirked.
“Goodbye, Potter.”
“How much is it?”
They wound their way back through the path, and onto the lawn. People stared, people gawked. Luna smiled, and Pansy winked at them. They made their way into the gazebo, Narcissa locking eyes with Draco sharply. She came over, fake smile plastered on. When she got close enough, her face dropped.
“A shit one, yes.”
“Maybe I can get there before the post does?”
“He’s in love!” Seamus declared, slapping Harry on the back. Hermione shot him a pointed look. The Irish man ignored it.
Draco Malfoy yawned as he unlocked the door to his shop, murmuring the words needed to de-activate the wards. He still wasn’t used to having something that was his, that he’d earned, not been gifted or given or passed down. No, this shop was his; months of hard work and stress all wrapped up nicely and painted with a fresh coat of prussian blue.
"Yes, thank you for owling ahead," the woman placed the small pouch on the counter. "That will be two Galleons."
“Yes, I will.” Potter stepped forwards, looking rather like someone about to do something stupid. So Draco stepped back. He stepped away from the man he wanted and back into his fear.
“Yes.” Draco turned to smile at Balveer. “I’m afraid I did promise.” He said apologetically.
“Be careful, Mr Malfoy, someone might overhear and find out you have a heart.” Harry teased.
Harry held his gaze, both of their chests heaving. He felt on fire. It had been so long since his emotions had been this heightened, and all he wanted to do was push Malfoy against a wall and give him a piece of his mind. For some reason, his brain won out, and he turned away, unable to stand looking at Draco any longer without needing to grab him.
Pansy looked absolutely mortified. "I know you like to keep away from the papers Draco, but you must have heard of them." She tutted at him teasingly, but at his quirked eyebrow, added incredulously, "The singers? No? Well anyway, they're gorgeous and they're glamorous and they're opening up a club here in London." She took a sip of her wine. "Its supposed to be extremely lavish and at least a little bit outrageous. We have to go!"
Harry looked back at him, his best friend trapped under a large piece of rubble as tears streamed down his face. Hermione’s screams continued.
Fred and George stood just to the right of him, talking in low whispers. The glanced at him and then quickly away, whispering more fervently.
Draco shuffled his feet and from his viewpoint Harry could see his knuckles whiten as he clasped his hands tightly. “I’m well. I’ve made some new friends, and Pansy keeps me on my toes as she always has.”
Draco looked down at their joined hands, his heart fluttering. “Are you sure? I don’t want to impose-”
“What?” Both boys said at the same time.
“You never gave me a chance.”
“It is.” Malfoy nodded. He went to let go of Harry’s hand but Potter didn’t let him
“What is it?” The darker man looked slightly suspicious.
They paid and made their way to the water.
“He can’t just expel him for being an arse, Ronald.”
Potter looked at him quizzically. “Hmm? Oh, you mean Charlie.” He nodded to himself but his eyebrows were still drawn together. “How does it work?”
"You haven't even asked me a question yet."
"Can we? The snorting?" Narcissa smiled at him.

The raven haired girl cackled, a hand pressed to her chest. “T'es foutu (you're screwed).”

"I thought you liked me mean," Draco laughed and pecked him on the lips, sliding out from under him. He filled up the kettle. "What were you looking for?"
He turned around to the stadium lights, his gaze drawn to two figures emerging from underneath the stands. Ginny and Luna walked hand in hand, talking to each other with love-sick smiles. It made Harry happy to see his friends so content after so long in turmoil. Ginny waved to him and he raised his arm to wave back. She jogged over to him as Luna watched her with a smile, making her way over at her own pace. “What’s up, scruff?” Ginny said, cheeks pinched with pink.
Hermione’s spaces were mostly tidy, except her bookcase in the lounge; which had originally been alphabetised but now had books stuffed anywhere they could be. The coffee table in the lounge was scattered with sports magazines and coffee cup stains, and the bulb in the corner lamp had gone three weeks ago but everyone kept forgetting to buy a new one. Old TV guides sat on top of the TV, collecting dust, and the mantel on top of the fireplace was overflowing with photo frames of their friends and family. Down the hall, the spare bedroom was decorated in purposefully generic colours and bedding, but a box in the top of the wardrobe held Harry’s spare toothbrush and a pair of PJs he had once forgotten. The kitchen was filled with spare crockery from the burrow, and any missing items were replaced with horribly contrasting modern utensils. Cooking books that Hermione promised she’d use sat covered in dust on top of the fridge, which was covered in magnets that different Weasleys would bring from their travels.
“I’m surprised you haven’t seen him. He only really does his hair at the moment, and it usually changes to match the person he finds most interesting.” She hummed thoughtfully. “Let me go grab the tea.”
The pool of yellow to his left came into focus - Luna’s golden hair splayed around her head, her bright eyes wide open, vacant of their joy, blood streaking out of them. Harry’s hands flew to his mouth, his scream trapped in his throat. He stumbled backwards, something soft cracking under his foot. He looked down at the dark hand, following it to Parvati’s face, half hidden under rubble. A sob escaped him, and he tried to run, but his legs wouldn’t work. Instead he staggered, looking half-drunk, away from the two girls. He didn’t look where he was going, as long as it was away.
Draco propped his glasses onto his nose and blew gently at his coffee as he pondered the stockroom. He let out a little snort - he probably needed more stock for it to be considered that. It was barely past nine, so even if he opened the shop now he could still probably have a couple of hours to himself. He was working on a report about Angel’s Trumpet and its properties (both poisonous and otherwise), hoping to sell it to St Mungos. Draco set his mug down on top of the cabinet, casting a stasis charm, before putting on a face mask and apron. He walked out to the front of the shop, flipping the sign to OPEN.
“Twenty galleons.”
Pansy smirked. “Speaking of rainbows, that’s why I’m here.” She watched as the waitress approached. The two women both ordered pots of tea. “I’m quite surprised about your earrings, Lovegood.” The horns twirled around as they dangled from the Ravenclaw’s earlobes. Not only were they very expensive, it was very hard to find ethically sourced Unicorn products.
Harry rolled his eyes. "You could say my face looked like an eighty year old ballsack and it would still be hot in that accent of yours."
"Oh, absolutely." They looked at each other for a minute, silently studying each other's faces.
“Please.” Harry called back. “Where’s my little man?” He called out, searching for the familiar giggling mound of raven hair. He heard Teddy before he saw him, and he turned to see the familiar face of Edward toddling towards him, but with a full head of white blond hair. “Oh my god!” He shrieked, diving forwards and scooping up the toddler. “What the hell is on your head?!”
"I'm sure it is, my lovely, but I'd prefer it on that dance floor." She grabbed his hands and pulled him up.
It was the most serious Harry had ever heard her. He smirked. “Insurance.” He whispered, as Malfoy looked between the two of them, aghast.
"No..no! I was just, um.." He looked around to find his broom several feet away. He grabbed it quickly, holding it up. "I was just coming for some practice."
Godric almost snarled in equal frustration. "You bested the former Headmaster, Albus Dumbledore. His wand, the Elder Wand, is now yours."
"I can try Owling them," Remus offered.
The Aurors ignored him and fired off their spells, doing their best to aim past him, but they were not going to hesitate when there was a murderous monster standing before them.
Frowning, Shadow dipped his hand into his pocket, fingering his wand. "Can I help you?"
"Very well, sir.” Omi bowed and disappeared.
The twins tried to tease out the source of Shadow's troubled silences, but they only got deflections in return.
"What do you say we go to the kitchen, grab a few things to eat, and sit out by the lake?"
Shadow grinned. "I thought you were perfect?"
Why was he dreaming of being Kit again? Always in his dreams of the sicko he was screaming
"Good. Back to class with you, then.” She gestured to the door and he went with another soft laugh.
Boy glanced at his wrist. He stared at it for a moment, tears of utter sorrow still running down his cheeks. Sniffing, he lifted his arm and pushed it in the other Boy's direction. He flinched and whimpered softly as the pale fingers gently took his arm and undid the bracelet that summoned Severus.
Ginny had been given five lashes for her mouth just last night. The Slytherins weren't faring much better with Alecto Carrow. Draco had gone to the Room of Requirement at midnight to help heal them. The pain potions they take every morning to strengthen them for the day's abuse also helped, but it wasn't enough. This would have to end soon.
Shadow sighed. He wasn't going to tell them about his DID, so instead he said the Hat had originally wanted him in Slytherin and that he went with it this time because he thought he could make a difference there. Plus, being in Gryffindor might make people suspicious of his past identity. He didn't say anything about Draco. He didn't feel it was any of their business. Hermione wisely didn't push it, but Ron couldn't let it go.
The teen lay as if sleeping, face slack and peaceful, but he was not merely sleeping. Shadow was in a deep coma, completely unresponsive to outside stimuli. His dreams were his sole reality now.
"I love you," the blond whispered against his lips before kissing him.
Shadow understood that and was impressed. "All right. We're meeting at the Hog's Head. You can invite others you think would really want to do this and who will keep quiet about it. It's just a meeting to iron out the details."
"You don't understand, Nymph," Remus rasped, his voice hoarse and broken. "Nev is a son to me." He lifted his head and Harry almost gasped at how awful the werewolf looked. His face was pale and gaunt, his eyes sunken and haunted.
"The only man to ever escape Azkaban," George added.
"I know that," Neville muttered darkly, still keeping his back to his teacher.
Harry flashed a grin very reminiscent of Gabriel and pushed his round, black glasses higher up his nose. "Well, then, lets get going."
"If there are culprits to find," McGonagall allowed, bowing her head in agreement.
"Seraphim! Wait!" Severus called, frantic. He watched his son disappear into the woods and panic overwhelmed him. He stumbled forward, the leg that was injured by Dumbledore almost giving out under his weight.
"The Hog's Head," Godric answered, "in the care of Dumbledore."
"But then I merged with that soul and made it my own, supposedly cleaning it of all Voldemort's instincts, and then what happens? Can you guess?" Shadow laughed wildly. "I kill
"Oh, go on. You don't want to spend your time talking to me." Lenora shooed them off, but she looked happier as he took his leave with another bow.
"Mine, too," Draco hissed furiously. Merlin! As if what they were doing wasn't difficult enough, Shadow was hanging by a thread, about to fall into insanity. They had to find Severus and fast! Dropping all concern about encountering a Death Eater, he began to run.
Shadow squeezed his eyes tight, tears hidden under the lids.
And then there was Harry Potter, Boy-Who-Lived… He was found in the same clearing as Remus Lupin. Minister Scrimgeour awarded the teen the Order of Merlin, First Class, and granted him the title of Savior of the Wizarding World, Hero and Champion of the Light. He was pronounced dead by Mediwitch Poppy Pomfrey on arrival at Hogwarts not an hour after he was found.
head." The teen sat in the high-back chair, glaring up at his father. His hands griped the armrests so tightly that his knuckles turned white.
"The new Minister is vastly worried about the safety of those in this school. You're families have sent you here so that you would be protected," Umbridge continued. "This may seem extreme, but it is for the best. The Ministry needs to know which of you are more vulnerable than others. Now, seeing how large a school Hogwarts is, I'm going to need help with the Heritage Registry. Professor Carrow has recommended students she deems the most capable and responsible."
"Severus sent the Patronus. He sent me memories. Of a manor. Lucius and others are there."
"But you
The lynx snorted. Its tail lashing with humor as the white peacock's tail rose in a gorgeous display; its delicate neck preening. The flock gurgled and shifted around the new male, giving him space and ignoring the recipient of the display. The back door to the manor opened, spilling a golden square of light out into the garden.
"I like how he helps Seraphim and is able to tame him somewhat, but I hate that he
Harry shook his head. "No. It's fine." He moved the rest of the way in and nodded once to let Charlie know he was okay.
The last chapter was smut, so I think it's only fair this next one has some light hurt/comfort angst don't you?
“What are you doing awake at this hour?” Harry would have been more than happy to talk to Draco about everything he had been doing, if his stomach hadn’t roared like a starved lion at the smell of Chinese food, “Harry, don’t tell me you didn’t eat dinner.”
Even after being together for a few years, seeing Draco completely relaxed was a rare sight that Harry reveled in every chance he got. Shifting as to not jostle the bed much Harry reached up and moved strands of blonde hair out of Draco's peaceful face. Harry couldn’t help but think how beautiful he looked, damn near angelic with the rays of the morning sun. A canvas of pale skin painted with scars and sins of the past, but breathtaking all the same.
Nodding his head Potter breathed out, “yeah.”
“Italian it is then.”
Taking a swig of whatever Pansy was drinking she rolled her eyes with a nod, “Weak question lover boy, Luna, truth or dare?”
“And what would that be?”
Walking into the common room the blonde headed straight towards the numerous bottles of who knows what and grabbed one before sitting on the sofa next to Pansy. They all ended up in a circle as Potter announced, “If you intend on drinking then you're playing truth or dare. And from what Rons told me, you’re magically bound to answer honestly or do whatever you're told to do, unless the group unanimously agrees that you don't have to do said task. So, I guess I'll go first, um… Neville, truth or dare?”
Reaching over to grab his wand Draco casted some spell that made a loud popping noise outside their door, before there were hushed whispers and footsteps walking away, “that should keep them away for a while.”
“Well that depends, are we talking about what I would do to him right now, or in general?”
“It's the start of the weekend and I'm bored out of my fucking mind because I can't sleep. So I'm going out to get something that’s going to help change all that.”
The room fell into darkness and Draco shifted to get comfortable, his fingers idly tracing circles on Harry’s back as the night caught up with him, “Harry?” Harry made a noise of acknowledgement, “how do you feel about Italian food?”
The moment Draco's eyebrows furrowed and he began mumbling something, Harry hollowed his cheeks and sunk down until he felt Draco's cock hitting the back of his throat, and swallowed. Draco choked on a breath as his back arched off the bed with a wanton moan.
Harry didn’t even let Draco finish before he removed his fingers and reached out, a sleek black toy flying into his hand. He could hear Draco spluttering behind him at the fact that he had a sex toy, but he didn’t care. He needed something more than fingers and if it wasn’t Draco’s cock, then this would have to do.
“Considering I can feel my cum leaking out of you, I can’t say that I did.” Harry turned a brilliant red as he became acutely aware of the feeling of Draco’s cum slowly leaking out of him, “I only asked cause that last one was… intense doesn’t seem like a strong enough word.”
(See the end of the chapter for
Harry’s mind was lost in his masturbation haze as changed to rolling his hips against the toy, doing something he had not only never told Draco he liked but actually had lied about to him before. He dropped his head back and slowly dragged his free hand up his body, overlooking his weeping cock, and toyed with his nipples briefly, before bringing his hand higher. He rested it just under his jaw for a moment, his breath catching at the feeling of his racing pulse beneath his fingers, and all he heard was a shocked curse as he pressed down.
fuckin hell it feels,” Draco dropped his head into the crook of Harry’s neck, panting, “you feel so good Harry.”
The second Draco got up Harry forgave the jab and whined, nearly falling off the bed as he tried to grab his arm to pull him back, “come back.”
Violently throwing the blankets off his bed, Harry got up to put on a sweatshirt and began searching through his trunk to find some money, “Potter what the hell are you doing?”
Harry moaned around Draco’s cock at the words. And Draco noticed, like he had before. Only this time it wasn’t praise falling from his lips. It was almost the complete opposite this time, and Harry loved it. He loved being called a slut or cheap whore just as much as he loved being called a good boy and that he was perfect.
Manoeuvring himself to properly lie between Harry’s legs Draco smirked, “putting out before the first date, how bold of us.”
Draco pulled back to tug his shirt off and toss it away, then opting to all but rip Harry’s shirt from his body, before pressing himself back against the tanner boy and attaching his lips to the soft skin at the juncture of Harry’s neck. Sucking and biting marks until Harry was chanting Draco’s name like a prayer to God.
It was one of those times that Draco came home sooner than anticipated.
Pansy and Hermione snickered as they explained, “You’re going to make out with each other on that couch until we say so, or when you decide you're ready to do seven minutes in heaven in your room.”
wrong he was. Harry soon came to the conclusion that McGonagall had gone completely insane. That woman must be batshit crazy if she thinks that the sleeping arrangements she set up wouldn’t end in bloodshed.
had made:
So in between picking places to travel to, and finding other fun activities for them to do, Harry became reacquainted with his right hand. After years of pleasuring himself, and all the exploration of his body he did with Draco, Harry knew how to get himself off almost as good as Draco did. It wasn’t nearly as satisfying, but it was still damn good. Each time he got the urge, he just reminded himself of how long it would be until Draco would be certified, and when he could feel that slim body on his.
“Hang on, you said he doesn't,” Luna got this very odd expression on her face as she looked at the flustered boys, “Does that mean that you do?”
“Hit me your best truth Longbottom.”
Once he was no longer coughing Draco glared at Harry, “a little warning would have been nice Potter.”
~~~~~
It couldn’t have even been a minute later that Harry was taking his hand away, “I’m ready, just-”
Like the drop of a hat most of Potters hesitance seemed to vanish as he retorted before connecting their lips again, “You wish.”
Harry managed to mumble in agreement through the fog of arousal clouding his mind. His movements began faltering as his climax began climbing, “I want- I’m gonna
All Malfoy could do was stare at the boy beneath him. There was something incredibly attractive about how flustered he was, and the fact that he was the one who caused it made it all the better.
“Three times,” using one hand at a time Harry tapped each of Draco’s legs three times, “just like that.”
Moving so his cock was in front of Harry’s mouth Draco made sure, “three times?”
in the feeling of hot breath against his ear, of the painful yanks on his hair, of the rough drag of hips against his cock.
The ravenette was quickly coming undone by Draco's actions and he knew if they kept going at this rate he was going to be cumming in his pants like a teenager, but he didn't care. He needed Draco's body on him like a drowning man needs oxygen. He
Harry was moaning with every lick of Draco's tongue, his head falling back when Draco finally took him in his mouth. He wanted to watch that mess of blonde hair move up and down on his cock, but he couldn’t focus long enough to keep his eyes trained on him. The pleasure he was in was overwhelming him in a way it never had before. He was so lost in a lust filled haze that he didn’t notice his orgasm building until he was cumming down Draco’s throat with a guttural moan.
Putting his arms around Draco’s neck Harry brought him closer, “yeah, a date.”
Luna simply shrugged and leaned over to peck Granger on the lips. Which Malfoy didn't care much for, so he was soon zoning out whilst drinking out of the bottle of firewhiskey he held in his hands.
No longer in the mood to toy with Draco, or himself, Harry leaned forward and took Draco's half-hard cock into his mouth, his own cock twitching at the whine that escaped Draco. Using one hand to steady himself, Harry used the other to help guide Draco's cock into his mouth as he lazily worked it until it was fully hard.
Finally looking up Harry was both disappointed and pleased to find Draco already at half-mast. Disappointed because Harry loved the way it felt to take Draco’s cock into his mouth when it was totally soft and feel it fill out and get hard against his tongue. But he was also pleased that his small touches got Draco going like this.
With hips raised and cock hanging between his spread thighs, hard and dripping with precum, Harry pushed a finger in beside the other. He let his mouth fall open with a low moan as a rush of burning desire shot through his veins, not caring how he would soon be drooling onto the sheets.
Burying his face in his hands in embarrassment Harry bemoaned, “I thought I had a few hours before you’d be back.”
“Yeah, now that that talk is done,” wrapping his legs around Draco's waist, Harry pulled their hips flush together, broken moans escaping both boys at the glorious friction, “shut up and fuck me.”
“Do you think we should have gone back downstairs?”
“Oh, yeah uh, it was kind of terrifying if I’m being honest, only because that’s never happened to me before. It’s definitely something I wanna try and do again though cause it was fucking
Neville paused for a moment as his eyes wandered the crowd, hesitating on two people, “I would say that I do yeah. Okay, my turn,” pausing he looked around the room until his eyes landed on Pansy, “Pansy, truth or dare?”
“Okay,” taking an eggroll from an open container Harry all but inhaled it, “then I won’t tell you.”
He kept this pace up. Rolling his hips hard and fast enough that the toy roughly dragged against his prostate with every jerk of his body. Tightening and releasing the grip on his neck. This was nothing like the other times he touched himself. It felt like small zaps of magic were crawling over his skin with every movement, making that delicious heat pool in his stomach faster than it ever had when he was alone.
Potter looked at him wide eyed and whispered for only them to hear, “oh my god, you liked that didn’t you? That’s-” he paused and let out a shaky breath “that has no right to be so hot.”
Snorting into Harry’s shoulder Draco pushed himself up and off the bed, casting a quick cleaning charm over the both of them as he did so, “eloquent as always I see.”
so good, so good for me,” Harry let out a high pitched noise before moaning Draco’s name like a prayer, “you take me so well. Like you were made for me, just for me. Fuck Harry.”
gonna last long.”
Shaking his head Draco turned one of the papers that covered the table towards himself and raised a brow, “394 easy steps to bake a spicy six-tier birthday cake.”
Humming lowly Harry sloppily kissed Draco's neck, harshly sucking on his pulse point, heat rushing his veins once more as he felt it jump beneath his lips. Sucking another mark just above Draco's collarbone, Harry’s voice was hoarse as responded, “mornin.”
The sudden pleasure in that small amount of pain lit something in the pit of Harry’s stomach and he wanted Draco to get rough. He wanted Draco to bite him, to pull his hair, to tell him what to do. To not treat him like some fragile little doll. What Harry hadn’t realized is that he had voiced these thoughts aloud, and Draco was more than willing to make them a reality.
Pushing himself up slightly Harry rose up to his hand, desperately chasing that glorious pressure his fingers gave him. His head was swimming from the touch and eyes on him, but- fuck it wasn’t
Weasley glared at Malfoy before glancing back at Potter, “look at the position this game has put you in, doesn’t seem all that right to me.”
Malfoy didn’t know what everyone was expecting him to ask Granger, but it sure as hell wasn't who’d she have sex with. Regardless, everyone in the group would have to agree that she wouldn't have to answer and Malfoy knew that Pansy wanted to know. So she had no choice but to answer, and everyone was just as surprised by her answer as they were by the question, “Um- either Pansy cause like,
Pulling the pillow out from under Draco’s head Harry wacked him with it, “shut up.”
When Harry settled down at the kitchen table he nearly spat out the coffee he was still nursing as he started reading one of the bucket lists
Shuddering at his words Harry responded, “fucking hell, I’ll let you do whatever you want."
“Well then, we have a long day ahead of us,” chuckling darkly Draco pulled at the unruly strands in his grasp, “Potter.”
Harry’s body was starting to shake from the pleasure of the fingers inside him mixed with the brutal assault on his prostate, and the slight overstimulation from already having cum once… he was barely keeping himself up. His arm buckled a moment later when Draco added a third finger, finally working him open in earnest.
This mix; Draco’s eyes on him, the intense vibrations against his prostate, and the euphoria from the rush of blood and endorphins at releasing his throat, caused his body to seize up before he let out a broken cry and came all over his chest and bed.
“Truth.”
“Harry,” tilting his head up from where it had been resting against Draco’s chest, Harry looked up at the blonde “do you want to go out for dinner?”
Draco replaced the loss of Harry’s digit with something that most definitely wasn’t a finger, making Harry all but sob into the sheets as that glorious tongue slipped into him along Draco’s sleek fingers. Any semblance of shame left Harry as he began begging Draco to fuck him, “please I want
Raking both his hands through Harry’s hair Draco asked, “what time is it?”
Harry could tell his climax was building again and that he wouldn’t last much longer, but he didn’t want to finish like this. Flinging his arm behind him Harry smacked Draco’s chest, “
Harry shuddered at the praise, his cock now rapidly hardening between his thighs once more, “turn a little so I can see your profile, not too much.” Harry shifted so he could see Draco out of the corner of his eye, the smirk on his face sending a rush of heat through his body, “begin.”
Harry shivered as he felt the older boys magic wash over them and their remaining clothes vanished, raspy moans escaping the pair as their bare cocks came into contact.
long enough.”
“You’re taking-”Harry crooked his finger in a very familiar fashion to brush against that spot that made his toes curl, a long moan escaping him as Draco followed his action, “too long.”
When the pair stood up they both swayed slightly as the world tiled, until they felt the cold heat of a sobering charm wash over them. Harry was silently grateful that Hermione was the one who had performed the charm, because when she did it it didn’t feel like a bucket of ice water was dumped over your head, killing whatever warm buzz you were feeling. It just felt like getting a breath of fresh air on a crisp autumn day. If anyone else had done the charm it would have most likely smothered the hot need coursing through Harry and Draco’s veins, making the atmosphere more awkward than, well, horny.
Draco had no more complaints as he flopped onto his back next to where Harry had been lying, and Harry didn’t hesitate to straddle his lap sink down onto Draco’s cock. All of the air rushing from his lungs as he felt Draco deeper than he had before. In this position Harry could feel Draco’s cock directly against his prostate and he knew that, with it hitting every movement, he would not last long at all.
“So many things I could ask,” Smirking Malfoy sat back down, “Like if Weasley can last more than twenty seconds when you're getting down and dirty, or what your darkest secrets are… how about this. If you could have sex with someone in this group, excluding Weasley, who would they be and why?”
Plus they were all getting very drunk; they had already gone through about half of the alcohol Potter had bought earlier. Although he refused to admit it, Malfoy was actually having a pretty good time, until he nearly choked to death on his drink when he heard what Pansy and Hermione dared both him and Potter to do.
It was during the dinner that night that Harry was reminded of the actual bucket lists he and Draco had made for an assignment one night when they were both delirious with sleep deprivation and alcohol. And the next morning when Draco went to work, that was the first thing Harry went in search of.
Draco leaned away to run his hands down Harry’s bare chest, making his breath hitch with every touch, Harry had no idea that being touched so little could affect him so much, “what’re you doing?”
Harry ran his hands down the smooth expanse of his boyfriend's back, giving his plump ass a good squeeze before moving to grasp their erections in his hand. Draco's hips stuttered with a loud moan when Harry brushed his finger along the tip of his weeping cock, spreading precum up and down the shaft, making them slick as he started to jerk them both in earnest.
Turning the chair to face the bed Draco leaned back into it, placing his arms on the soft fabric, “you seemed to be having a nice time while I was gone.”
“You can cum, if-” Harry’s lungs were on fire and his eyes were burning with unshed tears as he looked up at Draco, who was frantically thrusting into Harry’s mouth, “if you swallow every drop.”
One would think that after all these years a group of emotionally damaged teenagers would know better then to get drunk together. Teenagers who, by the way, haven't gotten along in a long, well… ever. First, we’ve got the lone ravenclaw; Luna Lovegood. Next, we have the rowdy bunch of Gryffindors; Seamus, Dean, Neville, Ron, Harry and Hermione. Lastly, the stuck up prats of Slytherin; Pansy Parkinson, Blaise Zabini, Theodore Nott and Malfoy.
While Draco was working to get his breathing normal again, Harry simply watched him, after all there’s not much he could do whilst bound. And Harry couldn’t help but think how
Harry was half delirious, but he felt when Draco’s movements started to falter and something akin to panic washed over him, “I- wait,” a particularly hard thrust had Harry stumbling over his words, “Draco,
Rolling his eyes at the cheesy response Draco moved to hover over the shorter boy, “I know you defended me back there, and said some other things, but I would never want to do something you didn’t want or enjoy. So I guess- I just want to make sure you're sure about this and that you’re not going to regret it.”
Following the silver line, Harry ran his fingers up and down Draco's skin, simply basking in his boyfriend’s beauty. At least, until he scratched over rosy nipples and heard the slight hitch in Draco's breath. Feeling Draco's chest skip under his touch allowed Harry’s focus to switch to something he only recently realized he missed dearly, desire.
With the current position they were in, Malfoy was fighting every instinct he had to do what he normally would in this kind of situation. But he knew that if they kept going at this rate then he wouldn't be able to stop himself, and his body would start reacting. But Malfoy wasn't the only one struggling. He hadn't realized that what he was doing would affect Potter as quickly as it did, or as much as it did.
Instinctively grabbing his left arm Malfoy shifted uncomfortably in his seat, “That's not why.”
In no time at all Draco had pushed Harry onto his back, Draco couldn’t help but stare at the way his disastrous raven hair framed his head on the pillow like a beautifully sinful halo, his voice a hush whisper as he said as much, “you’re beautiful.”
Pulling out his lists Harry passed them to Draco as he explained, “I was serious when I said I was going to have a whole damn binder full of things we’re gonna do once you’re certified, and that we were checking everything off our bucket lists, no matter how crazy or mundane they are.”
Forcing himself to retain eye contact Harry asked in a hushed voice, “you want me to keep going…”
He knew he could’ve asked Draco for a quick handjob. Hell,
Draco put his fork down and rifled through more of the papers, his face growing confused yet bright as he looked through everything laid out in front of them, “what is all this?”
sleeping. And judging by the noises he could hear from the other rooms, no one else was sleeping either. As the seconds went by Harry just became more annoyed at the fact that he was probably never going to sleep again. Actually no, he isn’t annoyed, he’s pissed off.
“Yep. And we’ll sit here all night if we must.”
Adjusting how he was sitting, Malfoy just sat there and waited for Potter to finish bitching to Granger about how he didn't want to do this. And by the looks on the girls faces, Malfoy knew damn well that if they didn't do the dare soon, then they were going to change it to something much worse. The strangest thing about all this to Malfoy wasn't even what they would be doing, it was that he didn't have a problem with doing it. Hell, he kinda wanted to do it. Well Potter isn't exactly someone Malfoy would normally go for, that boy had grown in all the right places since they were children.
Snorting at Draco's tactfulness Harry said, "I know I like it when I do it to myself, but I don't know how I'd feel about someone else doing it. Plus, I had a feeling that this was something that if I asked you to do, you would do it, but you wouldn't be fully comfortable doing it. And I don't want you doing something like that just because I want it."
“Oi dumbass! Truth or dare?”
Malfoy dropped his head with a frustrated groan, “there's no point Pans, it's not like you or Granger would be watching us.”
They spent their day curled up on the couch eating junk food while watching muggle television and laughing at the ridiculous shows they came across. It was nice just spending time together without any expectations or worries, even though they were both well aware that their one talk was not enough to address the problems they were having. But ignorance is bliss and neither Harry nor Draco wanted to ruin the tentative peace they had.

Harry fell back onto the sheets, a broken moan escaping him from the feeling of Draco falling between his legs, his cock rapidly hardening with each passing second. The blonde began kissing and sucking down Harry’s neck, groaning against his skin as Harry began frantically pulling at his shirt, and pushing his hips up against his in search of glorious friction.
