Harry didn’t care about any of that, not anymore. He had forgiven him. He just hoped he could live up to Harry’s expectations.
“Oh, thank Merlin,” Draco turned toward his mother and looked at her relieved expression aghast. He was the first one to admit, he hadn’t spent all that much time in the Manor with her or around her in general. He didn’t really know what she did while he was away. He kept in contact however he’d really been staying in the summer house in France doing nothing between his bouts of community service.
Harry smirked and shrugged, turning slightly Draco’s fingers once again laced in his. “At least it's useful. Although, before we see the Founders, Dumbledore said something odd when he told mentioned them that I thought I should mention.”
“No, no, you-you-” Draco couldn’t speak. He was grateful he had regained his ability to stand. His chest felt like it was closing in on itself, he couldn’t breathe. He buried his face in Harry’s shoulder. He’d been there. Draco had thought, he’d thought no one but his mother could understand, but he did. Merlin, how could Harry be as strong as he is?
“I can’t have every over-confident student with a misplaced grudge igniting your temper, now can I?” Draco looked up at him to see a smirk spread across his face.
Harry laughed out loud then grinning over towards Draco. It wasn’t his normal grin though, it was a bit darker. Draco instantly hated that grin. “Not in so many words. I asked him once if Voldemort and I were the same. He said when he tried to kill me, he left a mark. A bit of himself in me. As his favored method of killing people was to possess them before killing them.”
here’s the difference. I can be in Finland and cast the spell on Wales, and the spell still takes effect exactly as if I standing directly in the center.”
“I can see that, hey, ‘Mione, are Blaise and Pansy here yet?” Harry asked looking around and then back to her. Draco couldn’t stop the excitement of seeing his friends again from filling him.
He sighed and slowly rolled out of bed, having slept in his clothes he felt extremely unkempt. When he walked out of the bedroom, the sound of water running came from the bathroom. A shower. So that’s where Harry went. Draco trudged his way to his bedroom and set out clothes for the day. They were setting off to Hogwarts today, the first day of their pretend relationship. Well, Draco was getting what he wanted for a year people would know that Potter was his. That was all that mattered.
blames you for running to France. No one ever expected you to go back to the Manor after the horrors that he made you face in there. To this day, I don’t know how your mother still lived there before the renovations. Blaise and Pansy, they are proud of you, Draco. So damn proud. You faced the consequences of what you did. Pansy, she still has trouble looking me in the eye some days. Everyone made mistakes during that war, and we all had to go away for a bit to know how we could move forward. They are so excited to see you. Pansy squealed for a solid minute when I told her you were coming back. And Blaise? Blaise actually kissed me!”
“Thank Merlin? Mother, that could be anyone,” Draco protested to her and rolled his eyes. She’d really been spending too much time alone if this was her reaction.
As the class filled Draco realized there were a lot more people that came back. There were some 7th Years that he didn’t recognize, but he recognized Neville and Hermione. Blaise had come back, along with Pansy who was a lot mellower now and a lot less of a bitch. Blaise had relaxed thoroughly and was a lot less pious. Harry had long since became friends with Blaise and was on polite terms with Pansy.
“In theory, yes, but the connection for this isn’t solid like the one for the bond. The bond will recognize this as temporary and will actually, the best way I’ve found to describe it, is boot the other one out of the way,” Harry tapped Draco’s hip with his, and Draco toppled. “A lot like that actually!”
, I can define a space the size of Wales and as long as I have the initial magical power to back it up, all damage to all defined parties is transferred to me, but I don’t notice until after. And with the release of
Draco nodded. “Thank you, I will shower first then attend breakfast. If you see him first, tell him so.”
Harry chuckled a little. “No need to be. I don’t resent you and I don’t think you need to apologize. Although there are quite a few things I need to apologize for.”
Draco skipped his next class and sat by the lake. He stared out into it, wishing he never would have ruined everything like that. What was he even thinking? Harry was going to reject him and then they would awkwardly be friends? Forget it. He probably thought he was disgusting.  Draco Malfoy falling in love with the famed Harry Potter.
Draco watched as Hermione was about to answer but Harry cut her off with a sharp look and genuine smile. “Why Draco is my lawfully wedded husband, of course. I’m officially Harry Potter-Malfoy.”
She looked skeptical. Draco felt skeptical. Hermione jumped as a Tempus alarm softly went off behind her. It wasn’t one of theirs, so must be hers. “Oh! I almost forgot McGonagall wanted me to come to the School for the new Head Girl robes. They are supposed to be House neutral this year.”
“Well, I am,” Harry responded scratching the back of his head awkwardly. “But some of us have some bad experiences with our tongue.”
Harry smirked and looked towards the girls. “Draco is a little grumpy today, don’t mind him. What’s up?”
The Snake hissed again, causing Harry to roll his eyes before hissing back in Parseltongue. The sound was distinctly different from when he heard the Dark Lord speak it through the halls of his ancestral home. It was softer, with less darkness brewing behind it. He couldn’t control his flinch, however, and he’s pretty sure if it wasn’t for Harry’s infernal calm seeping through their bond he would have fled down the hall at the sound of it. Harry sighed, stepping slightly in front of Draco. “Lady Armelia, and Lord Cyrus, may we enter or shall you tease him some more?”
Harry shrugged, his hand settled around Draco’s waist. He couldn’t say he minded. He had to admit he was a little curious too, Draco certainly hadn’t known what Godric Gryffindor looked like. “It’s nothing special, I’ve just seen his portrait before.”
“Draco! Stop. It’s fine,” He held up his finger and stuck it in his mouth. “Just a little cut. Nothing to fret about. Why’d you apologize to begin with?”
Draco gasped slightly. Ask to be in a certain house? Wasn't it based on who you were? He didn't realize you could ask to be in a certain house. He wouldn't have said anything different than the one he received but it was jarring nonetheless. Harry shrugged. "I asked to be Gryffindor, the Sorting Hat thought I would do better in Slytherin."
“But what if..” Draco cut himself off by biting his tongue. He wanted to tell people. He wanted everyone to know they were bonded, it was partially out of revenge. He had a bonded claim to the Savior of the Wizarding World. The other part was the fact that Draco wants Potter for himself. So far Harry hasn’t treated him like a former Death Eater, he’s only treated him like someone he actually liked. And hadn’t that been something that Draco had been yearning for years?
Harry snorted then shrugged, grinning smugly. “That’s alright, at least then they will have a piece of me to keep them warm wherever they go.”
“Nice to know I made a good decision to keep my affections secret,” Draco said with a grumble. He felt Harry nuzzle his neck again. Blaise and Pansy nodded as if that made sense.
“Yup,” Harry said with a soft chuckle, following after her. Draco couldn’t help but love that Harry never once let go of him as they made their way after her.
“Yeah, they are already on the train, Ginny and I are just out here greeting the new ones and making sure everyone gets where they need to be on time,” Hermione gestured toward the train behind her and stepped aside.
“How rude,” Draco responded aghast. How dare he? What kind of thing is that to tell someone they are putting their absolute faith in?
In all honestly, Draco didn’t know how to respond. The past few days, he had come to terms with the irritaSeamusd embarrassing circumstances of his new-found relationship with the Saviour. However, it wasn’t easy, and he found most of his ability to accept it came from the oceans of calmness that Harry exuded at all times. He felt the need to touch Harry, he felt that all the time which he knew was the settling of the bond, but it was emotional times like these that he wanted to hug Harry. Like their consummation. Draco bit his lip and stuffed his hands underneath his lap to keep from reaching out, even though he was sure Harry could feel it, he bit his lip instead. “Thank you. For telling me that is.”
“But you did, and you managed to keep yourself together long enough. You kept me and mother out of Askaban,” Draco sighed and looked off. “I crumbled and I never really put myself back together again.”
It was Draco’s turn to be confused, he let it show in his face as he looked towards Harry. “What in Merlin’s name were you doing in Godric’s Hollow?”
"I bind together you and me. In this bond, I will know you, I will protect you, and I will honor you."
Harry actually looked confused as he laced his arm with Draco’s. His expression went from confused to thoughtful. “I’m not taking anything. Anymore. Herion used to be my drug of choice, but that doesn’t really induce calm. More euphoria-type haze shit. It actually wasn’t all that great now that I remember it.”
Draco growled and glared at him. He righted himself and turned angrily to face Shacklebolt. “Let’s get on with this!”
Harry tore his eyes from Draco and pulled the lid off the cauldron. Slughorn looked down into it and then a grin broke out of his face. “It’s perfect! Very well done boys!”
“If you want, Harry,” Draco conceded. He would never admit out loud how much he liked it when Harry would cuddle with him. They would curl up in Harry’s king-size bed and Harry would wrap himself around Draco like an octopus. Eventually, they would both fall asleep, but for just a moment, Draco could pretend. He could pretend that Harry truly was his, that the boy he’d always wanted he had.
“Oh, yes, can’t have baby second years trying against Saint Potter who can play professionally. They’d never win,” Draco drawled trying to keep his mind off the fact that Harry’s fingers were still on his ankle. He could feel the comfort Harry was sending through the bond. Now there was a spark of amusement.
“Technically,” Harry shrugged as if it was up for debate which house he belonged. “Draco’s all Slytherin though, the hat didn’t even have to touch his head before it called out the right house.”
Harry shook his head. “No, Draco. You have nothing to apologize for. None of that was your doing. None of it. I shouldn’t have told you that, I’m sorry, Draco.”
Draco actually jumped as around the courtroom’s lowest level runes etched themselves into the floor and a full protective space spread across. Narcissa and Shacklebolt rolled their eyes. Shacklebolt actually leveled a slightly annoyed look at Robards. “Really? I’ve got the Savior down here with me. I don’t need engineered magic too.”
Harry tugged Draco closer to him, he was nuzzling just under Draco’s chin. The blond couldn’t help but hold him just as tightly. This bond was actually turning out to be very helpful when Draco needed to avert panic. After a moment, he felt Harry’s hot breath at his ear. “Draco Malfoy. You chose what you did so you could better yourself. I ran off to America, Draco.
Draco felt his stomach drop. For now, they had been purely platonic in their dealings, did he mean to say they had to step it up? “What do you mean?”
Draco barely held back his snort of amusement at Harry’s reasoning. It made enough sense. He supposed he had to give the man props for improvisation. That was a solid cover-up. Hermione quirked her eyebrow in curiosity but she knew the specifics of the bond and how they were supposed to have their own quarters. “I’ll help you look for it, Harry, don’t worry about it.”
Then Harry quickly brought his hands back together in a loud clap like thunder and the runes were gone, as were the swirling colors that had taken over the floor. Harry tensed for a second before rolling out his neck and then his shoulders. Draco reached out trying to feel what was happening. He felt flickers of pain and fatigue. Just as quickly as it came along it was replaced by the heat and calm. “You’re welcome, Robards. Next time, don’t ask me to cast that just so you can get a quick heal. Go to fucking Mungo’s, prick.”
Draco's brow furrowed. Harry looked between the two Founders, realization trickled through the bond. What the hell did he just realize? He nodded though. "Yes, it was the only way they could monitor me as closely as they would like."
Draco jerked up. Did Harry really think he was at risk of turning dark? That was complete lunacy. “You have no risk at all becoming a Dark Wizard, Harry. It’s just not possible.”
Without further explanation. Shacklebolt started the spell. This spell was done in two parts. Draco could feel his magic rise to the call of the bond, and his eyes flicker over to Harry who was passively staring down at their locked arms. Shacklebolt clapped over their arms. “If you would say the words.”
“Draco, it’s been two years, none of that matters now,” Harry reassured. The calm was forcing its way through his panic. He brought Draco’s face to him, cupping his cheek. “Draco. I need you to breathe and calm down. You don’t meet the Founders like this, do you?”
Draco bit his lip to keep from telling Harry that he saw him. That he saw past the fame and fortune. He didn’t need to see it. He already had both of those, when he was younger and now on the opposite spectrum, why would he need more? So yes, he saw Harry. But he couldn’t tell him that, this bond was duty. It was for his freedom, not so he could get a quick lay. Draco nodded and Harry tilted his chin up with a couple of fingers. “Hey, why don’t we go cuddle for a while? I have to leave these quills to do their stuff and Kreacher is still packing and retrieving our books for school. Work on that proximity thing I know you want to increase.”
Draco watched as Harry’s eyes flashed brightly for a second as he held out his hands like a conductor. He tilted his head back and Draco felt the floor shift. “
“I didn’t think that included me, love,” Harry was smirking and holding Draco close. It was intoxicating. He didn’t know how Ginevra had stood it, if this is what it was like to be in a relationship with Harry Potter, how had she lasted and not burnt up?
Ice split through Draco’s chest. How were they going to go about it? Draco constantly fought with his want to show off the fact that Harry was his and he belonged to Harry. Consciously he knew that was a want that stemmed from Harry’s new-found attractiveness and the bond they shared now, but it was hard to resist with Harry calling him his Husband at least three times an hour. The calm bloomed like fire in the back of his head again. The never-ending calm of Harry Potter. “Oh, don’t worry about that, ‘Mione. We’ll get it figured out.”
Draco sighed and ran a hand through his hair. Merlin, he had no idea Potter had such a line. He might as well be a pureblood with that line. The only muggle he’s heard so far would be Harry’s mother. But even she was supposed to be a very fantastic witch. “Merlin, Potter. How many houses are you head of?”
“Draco,” She said standing up properly and tugging him along with her. She cupped his cheek and hugged him again. “I’ve missed you, darling. I’m so glad your back.”
Draco leaned forward and froze as everything Harry smacked him in the face. “The Quidditch Pitch, muggle tea, and treacle tart.”
“Yes, love,” Harry said with a wince as he rubbed his chest. Draco did not smirk at the slight pain that traversed the bond, he swears. “Sorry, Draco is my boyfriend, just my boyfriend, much to my dismay.”
“It’s gone. And this bond will leave a permanent mark on you, or it’s supposed to be permanent. You can choose to keep it if you want at the end of the year or if you don’t want it, I will remove it for you,” Harry was whispering. His voice low, only for Draco to hear. Draco didn’t know if he’d want to be marked at all. “I’d imagine you’d want it gone. But I also imagine I know very little about you after all this time.”
“I finally fucking remembered!” Harry responded turning to him with a grin. Draco sent every ounce of his irritation down the bond hoping it instilled the fear just a regular glare couldn’t. Judging by the firm calm and slight happiness filtering from Harry’s end, it wasn’t working. “Do you know where the Founder’s Quarters are?”
Harry was actually frozen for a second. He slowly turned to Draco with a wicked grin on his face as he sat back. “But you said the other ones?”
Draco crossed his arms as he processed this information. Harry did always have certain Slytherin traits that Draco had taken notice of over the years. He supposed that all made sense. Harry would have thrived in Slytherin, that was true, but would he have been the Savior everyone needed? Would he have the bravery to do what needed to be done? But- "Why did you ask to be in Gryffindor? You knew nothing about the Houses. If I recall correctly how you felt while getting our robes, you actually seemed worried about it."
By the time dinner had finished and everyone was more settled. Harry was once again in a semblance of his previous good mood. At least he was grinning and back to calling Draco his husband, so the blonde took that to mean he was back to normal. They were still sitting in the Great Hall with Hermione, Pansy, and Blaise. The other Eighth Years had gone off to find their dorms in the newly refurbished South East Tower, for the first time since he arrived at the school Draco felt at peace.
Draco crossed his arms over his chest with a huff. The embarrassment had reached its boiling point. “They might have been uttered at least once during fourth-year.”
Harry started to laugh. “Now, now, love. I wouldn’t let them hurt a single hair on your pretty little head. The pretend relationship thing actually might work, you’ll have to work on being more affectionate, and not cringing every time I touch you, but it has potential. Side note! I’m already off the market.”
Draco’s eyes widened. The whole fake relationship thing, he could deal with. He could handle that. But Potter is off the market? He’s taken? Anger bloomed in Draco’s chest like flames. He was on his feet in a flash. “What the bloody hell are you doing agreeing to bond with me for?! Why the bloody fuck are you here with me instead of them? That’s fucked up, Potter!”
“What do you mean you couldn’t face the country? What bender?” Draco crossed his arms and tried to make his tone as least offensive as he possibly could. Unless Harry was being an utter arsehole, Draco saw no reason to ever put malice into his words. Never again, would he.
To hear his name come out of Potter’s mouth in a non-biting manner was something Draco had been longing for, for ages. This was his chance for that too. He turned his head up in retention of his dignity. “Of course not, Potter. I can however suffer your presence to gain my education.”
Draco gaped at him. Sure, there were times when Harry was practically insufferable with that wit and smirk of his. But to apologize? What did Harry have to apologize for? Nothing came to mind. “What for?”
Harry’s laughter subsided into low snickering as Draco approached him. “At least now we know what our children will like, eh, Draco-love?”
“Came to see if you were alright, I mean you’ve been out here since Potions this morning,” Harry said coming over and sitting next to him on the rock he had claimed. “You forget we’re taking the same NEWTs, Draco. Except Arithmancy and Ancient Runes, definitely not taking those, not that I could if I wanted to.”
Draco pressed his fingers into Harry’s mark, forcibly cutting himself off. Draco was wearing long sleeves so his mark was covered. Seeing as Harry had all kinds of tattoos, he wasn’t as worried about covering his arm. Harry shook his head firmly. “I agreed because it was the right thing to do. I wasn’t about to allow anyone else to volunteer and then use it to abuse you. I wasn’t about to allow you to get hurt again when I knew I could stop it.”
“Me too, Draco,” Draco looked up at the sound of Blaise’s soft baritone voice. Blaise never really spoke loudly or even in a manner that draws attention to himself. “I’ve missed you. When Harry here told us you were coming back we could barely contain ourselves.”
“I did crumble,” Harry admitted with a harsh laugh. “I lost my fucking mind there for a little bit. I couldn’t stand to feel anything so I had to replace it. My emotions ate me away from the inside out. If it wasn’t for Molly and Narcissa, I never would have found myself again.”
“You think I know?” Harry responded an incredulous laugh escaping. “I realized a long time ago, I would only ever get what he means after the said event has already happened.”
Draco huffed when he heard Harry chuckle. “We’re fine, ‘Mione. We've still got a day and a half. Is Ron going? I don’t recall if he ever made up his mind or not? Robards seemed particularly pleased with his progress in the Academy though.”
Draco let his eyes drop from Potter’s face and looked at their arms. As a green and silver ribbons tightly tied themselves around their arms. It was hot, the entire bond burned, Draco could feel it burning itself into his being and he didn’t understand how this could ever be temporary.
“What do you mean? You don’t like sex?” Draco asked bluntly, taking a cautious step into Harry’s open arms. He needed to be close. He knew it was the bond, but he needed it.
Draco stared at him for a second before blinking and turning to their friends. “Do you three have any clue?”
Shacklebolt nodded and straightened a stack of parchment on the podium. Draco swallowed. If this was what he had to do, so be it. Fine. Just one more hoop. “Who? Who do I have to bond too?”
It was making Draco’s head hurt and stressing him out just looking at the boy. How can he do all of this at once and not freak out? On top of the fact that he was having Kreacher pack their things for school, and that he had earlier this morning before sitting down and starting all this arranged for their private quarters with McGonagall. And somehow he still had time for Draco, he still had time to grin every time Draco got his attention.
Draco scoffed at the thought and pulled back. That was obviously a lie. Blaise would never. “You liar.”
It has been three days. Three days living in the same house as Harry Potter. And Draco could say he was, content. Shockingly enough.
She then grinned and turned back to Harry, who much to Draco’s joy and irritation still keeping his hands to himself. “So the turnout is actually looking to be much bigger than we expected.”
“That’s alright, Draco,” Harry shrugged, the shrug was so nonchalant, Draco almost believed him. “Everyone heals at their own pace. For example, Ron can’t even look at the Castle without breaking down. He thinks Hermione and I are heroes because we were able to come back. Hermione thinks I’m insane because I can walk through the Manor like nothing ever happened. I ran away from my home because I felt like Atlas trying to hold the world up and failing spectacularly. You are no less amazing. You came back, Draco. You are trying. And that is all that matters.”
Harry started to move away and Draco nearly yanked him back. He didn’t understand that emotion either, he knew it was his though. He was starting to be able to tell the difference between his emotions and Harry’s. Harry’s emotions originated from the back of his head, his own emotions originated from deeper within. Harry took a step away and Draco watched as he winced, then he felt the pang of pain through his temples. “It hurts if I don’t stay near him?”
Cyrus hissed softly at Harry, who responded with a similar sounding hiss of parseltongue. Harry stepped aside and prompted Draco forward. Draco swallowed. He still had his pride despite the lion’s condescending remarks. He locked eyes with Armelia as he spoke his password. “Slay all Infidels.”
“Draco, who do you think I was describing when I said what the Amortentia smelled like to me?” Harry leaned back against the tree and cross his arms. His eyes were back to their preternatural green colors. Bright again. Draco shook his head and Harry sighed. “It was you. I was describing you.”
“The Room of Requirement,” Harry nodded letting go of Draco’s hand and approaching the painting. “Do you think it’s still there, Draco?”
Draco flinched back. Wait, did he still? No way. There was no way he still had a crush on Draco. “Is that why you agreed to the-?”
“Uhm, what are the boundaries of our pretend relationship?” Draco asked slowly spooning some eggs into this mouth.
Draco went rigid. How did he find him? How? Draco turned and saw Harry Potter standing there, his hands stuffed in the pockets of his robes.  This was definitely not going the proper way. “What are you doing here?”
Harry beamed at him and plopped down on the floor in front of his knees, leaning back against them. “Married, remember? No secrets.”
“Sal, be nice,” The blonde chided, smiling down at the two of them. “I’m not so good at keeping things hidden, so obviously, that’s Salazar Slytherin, but can you guess who I am?”
“Hmm?” Harry had been nuzzling Draco. He wondered if Harry was usually this physically affectionate or if it was the bond. Green eyes popped in front of him as the brunet leaned around. “What is it, love?”
“What?” The blonde ground out in irritation glaring at him. He pointedly ignored the other three who were snickering across from them.
“Draco you were on house arrest for those two years, as per your sentence,” Harry reminded him. Draco felt his hot breath rush over his chin, the damned wizard was like a furnace of barely contained Fiendfyre.
Draco watched as Harry threw himself in one of the booths. His bag went to the rack above them and his jacket on the table, the brutishness of his actions caused Pansy to squeak in surprise. Draco approached cautiously. Pansy was the first to notice him, she let out an excited squeal and nearly tackled Draco into the opposite side of the booth Harry had sat in. A flash of possessiveness flared through the bond only to be apparently smothered with Harry’s calm. The bond. Draco couldn’t help but feel triumphant that it made Harry just as possessive as it made him. Draco clung to Pansy, it was going to be fine. “Hello, Pansy.”
Harry scratched the back of his head. “Yeah, I mean, technically. My ancestor the one who founded the Potter Family was Linfred of Stinchcombe, he was known around Godric’s Hollow as “the Potterer”. He actually invented Skele-gro and Pepper-up. His oldest son, um, married Iolanthe Peverell, Ignotus' granddaughter, and as she was the last one of the Peverell line, the title fell through the Potter line. So, I suppose since I’m the last of Potter line, I kind of just inherited all that too?”
“That was him, his influence on my mind, we were so very close then,” Harry sighed and chuckled a little. “So very close, in fact, it didn’t matter if we were leagues apart. One was always able to just slip into the mind of the other. See what they saw. Do what they did.”
Draco blinked a few times and realized the person holding him was Potter. Who was speaking? How the fuck was he still just fine?! Draco couldn’t even formulate words.
He heard his soft chuckle but didn’t turn to look at the boy. Draco crossed his arms across his chest and turned his gaze on Shacklebolt. “Very well. Draco Malfoy you will be bonded to Harry Potter on the date of Tuesday, August 28, in the year 2000 and the bond will extend for exactly one year for the sake of our records. On the date of August 28, 2001, you will be free to walk amongst wizards as you are. No restrictions, no checks, no probation, I, unfortunately, cannot control the prejudice of witches and wizards. As Minister, however, I will make a solid effort to keep all personal emotions out of Ministry matter should we cross paths after this.”
Draco suddenly felt guilty. He knew how he would feel if had to force his affections on someone so they could have their freedom, and he wanted to tell Harry he loved his affection. Loved it when they touched. But how to do that without revealing his massive crush on the man? “It’s not so bad. I don’t know if it’s the bond, but it’s not so bad. You always just take me off guard.”
"I had thought as much," Salazar commented, he sounded as if all his question had been answered. "Even Fate requires a bit of choice."
Draco jumped onto the train and continued forward, he let Harry go first. He was suddenly much more unsure than he was before. He almost felt like apparating back to Grimmauld Place, the need to run almost overwhelming him. Harry, despite his normal extreme attention to Draco’s emotions, didn’t seem to notice. Draco thought he was going to have to say something when Harry stopped outside the door that led to the Eighth Year compartment. The next thing Draco knew he was being held tightly, the now-familiar burning hot touch of Harry’s hands running up his back. So, he had noticed.
“Draco, darling, what is so scary about seeing them that you are about to bolt?” Harry’s soft voice slipped through Draco’s ears and he felt his normal fight or flight response die down as he buried his face in Harry’s neck. “Love?”
, that charm only shields the damage of the space the spell is cast in within a certain radius, transferring the damage to the caster. With
“Oh, yes, that would be just dreadful, wouldn’t it?” Harry smirk bled through his words. Draco knew then, Harry would love nothing more than to put some arrogant younger years in their place. He couldn’t help the smirk that crossed his face, a smirk to match Harry’s. He will admit, watching Harry rain down his righteous wrath would be a sight to see, especially when that wrath is on his behalf.
Harry turned over his shoulder as the lift slowed to a stop, he tugged the blond gently into the Atrium. “Oh, Draco, love. There are so many things you don’t know about me.”
Draco turned to look around the hall they found themselves in. Something caught his eye, right on the wall where the Room of Requirement used to be. Had that portrait always been there? Draco tightened his fingers, grabbing Harry’s attention. “Harry.”
Draco starting playing with Harry’s fingers, basking in the calm and content that filtered through the bond. “So tell me about this Engineered Magic.”
“Well, it does,” Draco crossed his arms and he was not pouting damn it! He wasn’t! Harry let go of Draco completely and he felt cold. He wanted to tug Harry back but didn’t want to give him the satisfaction. And damn it, the prat probably felt that.
“You want the exact quote? I only mention it because as far as vague warnings go I think this one could take the cake,” Harry chuckled and rolled his eyes. Draco nodded, might as well. “Alright. He said, ‘Harry, one last thing, keep in mind the founding resemblance.”
Draco looked between Harry, the painting, and Hermione. Hermione swallowed nervously. “Well, I’ll take my leave then. I’ve done what I came to do. Goodnight, Harry, Draco. I’ll see you tomorrow morning.”
“Well, the only person I trust not to abuse the power of this bond,” Shacklebolt answered casting a Tempus charm, before sighing. What was he waiting for? “He should have been here before we even started. He’s been quite tardy lately.”
This time Draco couldn’t contain the snort. Hermione just rolled her eyes while the rest of them looked properly confused. Draco shook his head. “Would you like to join us now, Hermione? I regret we’ve had a rather long day and need our rest.”
When Draco was finished and dressed for their trip, he made his downstairs. He found Harry sitting at the table. The man was dressed in a simple white t-shirt that stretched across his fit body making it very hard not to stare, and a pair of black jeans just as form-fitting. Along with his usual dragon-hide boots and the twin pendants. Harry had a piece of toast in his hand and turned at the sound of Draco entering the room. “Morning, love.”
Draco jumped when the idiot sitting next to him slammed his hands on the table. So much for his bloody peace. “Draco!”
Draco felt a soft exhale of breath. Interest flicked through Harry’s infernal calm. “What do you have in mind?”
Draco almost couldn’t breathe as he was engulfed in a tight ring of Harry Potter’s magic. He knew it was his, he could recognize the damn signature. But this huge thing, was this really the power Harry carried around every day without crumbling? Was Draco so weak in comparison? Draco felt his knees start to shake, he definitely couldn’t hear Shacklebolt now. He would not fall. He wouldn’t.
That first day they argued over every little thing, over what to have for breakfast that morning, over what to do afterward, over how to fit Draco into Harry’s weird schedule. The first was the nightmare he thought it would be. The second day proved to be much better, they still argued but less, any squabbles they had were mostly due to Harry's incessant teasing. On the third day, they didn't really have time to argue as Draco was dragged along with the previously mentioned weird schedule. Which honestly, how did Harry Potter even keep up with it? Harry volunteered for practically a million different things and was required as the Savior to attend a million more, Draco was sure the boy would explode once they got to school and he had nothing to do.
“Stuff it, Potter,” Draco turned towards the wall. He could feel embarrassing heat seeping into his pale cheeks, could practically feel it as Harry chuckled across the room. He swallowed his embarrassment. “So what? Do we just pretend to be in a relationship? What about the fact that you constantly call me your husband? We cannot tell people and be completely serious, that we are married. Shoving in their face that you are mine is one thing, showing them I’ve taken you completely off the market is something entirely different. I’ll be mobbed.”
“The Founder’s what?” Draco’s anger was tempered by sheer confusion. He didn’t think the Founders even had rooms in the school. Now that he thought about it though, they could have. This school was a labyrinth.
“I forgave you the moment I almost killed you,” Harry told him, his hand dragging slowly down his chest. “You looked so terrified. I only realized it after I had run off scared out of my mind. I never meant to do that to you, Draco. I never meant to hurt you like that. I realized as I was thinking about it, no one who truly wanted to commit mass genocide would ever look that terrified of his own reflection.”
Harry grinned and nodded. “Why don’t you both take note of what you did with the potion and what it smells like to each of you?”
“The most shameless in the land,” Salazar deadpanned easily cutting Godric off. He rolled his eyes and eyed Harry with curiosity. He shouldn’t be surprised the Founder of his House preferred Harry. It was quite painfully becoming obvious what or rather who these rooms were specifically for and who had stolen Salazar’s heart. Harry and Godric seemed almost frightening similar. “I am however curious as to how you knew. I was under the impression most witches or wizards do not know our appearance.”
” Draco repeated as he locked eyes with Harry. His brain had slowed down so much he couldn’t even translate the words in his head and he didn’t notice that Shacklebolt had widened his eyes at Harry’s use of the original terms. He felt a tug in his head and his chest, as Harry turned his arm so their dragons pressed together.
Harry full-on laughed at that, his eyes practically glowing when they locked with Draco's. “Oh, they wouldn’t dare. It’s nothing damaging, at least not to you. Nothing like what it probably makes you think of. It's just while within the space I define in my head all damage to parties within gets transferred to me. Magical or physical.”
“I’m aware,” Harry said tugging Draco’s hands away from his chest and slowly running a hand up Draco’s arm to rub a thumb over their bondmark. The Dragon. “That’s why it was so easy to pick me to bond with you, so you can have your freedom. I don’t date or anything along that nature. Just not worth it.”
Draco felt nostalgia ooze off of him in waves, whispers of long-forgotten pain. Nothing to worry about, just twinges of memory. He focused on the sound of Harry’s voice, watched his fingers toy with the pendants around his neck. “I went to America. I lived in a shabby apartment for six months before Narcissa and Molly launched a search party. That’s where they found me, I was tattooed, pierced, and at the time high off my ass.”
Draco jumped violently and shut his eyes. His knees gave out and he could breathe again. He was very well aware however of a very hot arm around his waist and a burning in his left arm, right where that damn mark is. What, in the name of bloody Merlin, had he done?
“Yeah, thanks,” Harry smirked a little. Draco almost rolled his eyes at the mischief he felt from Harry's end of the bond. “Just if we can’t find it tonight, I’m sure I won’t get any sleep.”
“I see, we were told there would only be two of you,” The Lion narrowed its gaze towards Hermione. The Snake bared its fangs and hissed in her direction as well. “I count three.”
Draco wasn’t too sure it was just luck at all, the way Salazar eyed Harry curiously, it looks like he wasn’t convinced either. Godric only nodded in response, clapping his hands together once. “Information is information, doesn’t matter where it comes from. Besides, Harry, you’re infinitely more awesome. You’re the Gryffindor Dumbledore asked us to let use our quarters?”
Harry started at him again and then shook his head. “Because you’re perfect, for me that is, we blend well together. You infuriate me to no end, and drive me absolutely crazy. I’ve never wanted anything more than I want you. You’re absolutely gorgeous and you’re sense of humor is pretty damn great. You’re adorably obsessive about how things should be. You get excited over little things you think are cool, but you play it off, because Malfoys don’t get excited about things like that.”
“Only every other hour,” Blaise said with a scoff. “You always had something to say. And the damned incident with the tree? You just had drop-down and look cool for Potter as he walked by and you talked shit instead of snogging him as you should have and saved us all pain.”
“You mean other than the fact that I was born there?” Harry asked with a slight chuckle when shock took hold in Draco’s face. He hadn’t known that. The similarities between the Founder of Gryffindor and Harry Potter were becoming even more in line. Draco nodded despite himself. “I own property there. It’s a nice place if you ignore the fact that there’s a monument to my parent’s death outside the front gate. I figured if I wasn’t going to use it, I might as well fix it up, maybe rent it out or whatever. I was looking through the records in the town hall just to see if I could possibly move the monument, increase property value, that kind of thing. It’s really not some grand mystery, I was just lucky enough to share a birthplace with the Founder of Gryffindor.”
“Ooh! Ouch,” Harry brought a hand to his chest for dramatic effect, laughing softly as he laid a hand on the small of Draco’s back. “Stone cold killer. Alright. That was fun, Dumbledore got his kicks. Hey, Founders! Sorry about my outburst there, I couldn’t help myself, it’s just too funny. I’m Harry Potter, and my lovely companion here is Draco Malfoy.”
Potter glares at him, the expression magnified by his goggles, stealing the threat of it with how ridiculous he looks.
“Thanks, I learnt doing Pansy’s nails. This is her nail polish, actually, I was meant to bring it over earlier, but then …” Draco trails off. Then his visit with Potter had taken longer than expected because Potter barely managed to trudge himself up to open the door. Pansy’s nail polish lost priority.
Potter squeezes his waist, holding Draco tight and secure as he lathers more marks onto him, traces them with his tongue and scratching with his teeth, making a canvas out of Draco’s skin.
(If he is being honest, Draco doesn’t mind all that much. He is surrounded by Potter, every single one of his senses clogged with him, his soft skin and his scent fill the air, sneaking into Draco’s brain. Potter is all he can see and all he can hear, flashes of his smiles and commands to yield. Draco thinks yielding wouldn’t be too bad, if it were to Potter.)
“Okay, yes, I’m a dreadful student and I cost you all your dreams, the world is cruel, get over it. What
Draco almost feels like he could stay like this forever, the taste of Potter on his tongue as the man himself sings his praises, his fingers gentle in Draco’s hair except when he can’t help himself, when Draco does something clever that has him shouting, has him pull Draco closer and never letting go. Yes, that would be a life well spend, Draco thinks. All that is missing is seeing Potter, eyes blown wide from pleasure and mouth open in a moan.
Draco, all things considered, isn’t unhappy with that development. He is rather comfortable, now that he is over the shock of Potter knocking into him. In fact, they align rather nicely, only the minimal amount of bones grinding and digging unpleasantly, but that is to be expected. Perhaps, if Potter could shift a tiny bit higher, then they would both be more comfortable. (He also has very pointy elbows, but Draco is afraid of mentioning those; Potter doesn’t need to know more ways to use his body as a weapon, his fingers far too apt at poking and his feet made to stomp and squash.)
Draco has years of experience in avoiding Pansy’s inquisitive judgement, he knows how to play the game. Well, there is no
Pansy snorts, a plebeian expression meticulously cultivated to aggravate her mother specifically, but used freely and gleefully whenever she sees a chance. And because Pansy is an opportunist, she snorts an unholy lot. “You don’t have any other friends, only us. I can assure you, none of
“What are they magicked for, anyway,” Harry grumbles, not looking forward to this expedition on bit.
to do. Then again, Potter doesn’t live in the shop, as far as Draco knows. That isn’t a good excuse, though.
Point is, things have been good. They found a way to get vaguely along, Harry learnt not to complain about Malfoy’s preference for heavy furniture and Malfoy … Harry isn’t sure if Malfoy is actively doing anything to ensure the peace, but even if not, Harry discovered ways to shut him up more efficiently than shouting insults ever did. Apparently that is not enough for Grimmauld anymore, and Harry is denied sleep and treated to faulty heating. Lovely.
He doesn’t think he wants to know. Ignorance is bliss, that is what they say, and Harry might have always thought that saying a bit lacking and oversimplified (what you don’t know can still make your life miserable, wars have a way of driving that point home) but here he is inclined to agree with it.
Draco sinks against the cool wall, rests his aching head against it and thinks that it’s not as comfortable as Potter, not in a long shot, but that it will have to do. At least until Draco can open his eyes again and hunt the bastard down. He stays there, the cool seeping into his brain and settling over his skin, everything slowing down as he waits for Potter to return.
More understanding than Potter himself, who doesn’t look at the tea, back to pretending he doesn’t like it. Draco frowns; he didn’t miss this little ritual of denial.
The sharks are still screaming, scribbling notes and taking pictures, pressing Potter into the wall and circling him.
doing what people tell him to do, but it will make things more complicated, nonetheless. Narcissa Malfoy is not a woman you want to cross, and even less so when you are married — and intend to
And, so, Draco doesn’t say anything on the misconduct of proper pet care. He just offers Darlington for Harry to hold and relishes in the small smile that earns him.
They had this talk before, and Harry feels like an arse for bringing it up again when he knew how much it pains his friend.
It looks even better with Harry's friends on it, arguing over what movie to watch and which food to place where. Harry missed this. It’s irrationally possessive, but it isn’t the same when they aren't gathering in his house. Now that it truly feels like
, admitting that is a humiliation Harry could have spared him. Then that is a stupid question to ask anyway, even people who do know what a movie is. Favourite anything is a stupid question, really, Harry was never a fan. Huge parts of that is that he never knows what to answer, because favourites are fickle and liable to change at all times, but especially when put on the spot like this.
“Besides your giant crush on your husband, you mean,” Ginny suggest, voice saccharine and smirk firmly in place.
he would do that, given that the house vastly prefers Malfoy and the git also legally lives here and has thus every right to stay, but it feels good to say anyway.
to share a bed with. He gets peevish, and nightmares that wake him at odd hours of the night, and he doesn’t share the blankets, but, even for him, that was a bit heavy. He'll have to apologise later, do some grovelling.
Everything seems as it should be, the low light of morning filtering through the curtains, their clothes neatly sorted into the closet because Draco hates the mess (but he also hates cleaning, so he makes Harry do it), and — Draco!
It’s amazing how much better Harry feels knowing that Draco is as unsure of the situation as he himself is. Really, it’s quite funny if you think about it (or that might be the nerves and tension finally tearing, but Harry will take what he can get), and Harry can’t stop the chuckle building up in him. This is all so absurd.
At some point, when Draco was distracted, when he look away for a bit or was hunched over his plans, Grimmauld has become his home.
They stand their vigil, ears straining for another sound, muscles tense and ready to jump, hearts beating loud in the silence, snow falling gently around them. It’s eerie, Draco will admit that, even if only to himself.
“Should just burn this bloody thing down; would be nice and warm, too,” Harry grumbles, turning over and pulling the blanket closer around himself. The temperature drops another few degrees.
Everyone looks up at the sound of Draco’s name (first name, too, not Malfoy as they must have expected because Harry couldn’t put into words the simple joy calling him Draco brings and consequently didn’t tell them about this development) staring first at Harry who spoke and then at Draco, who was spoken to.
He didn’t notice before, or perhaps he didn't care, but Ron seeing him like this heaves things into new significance. Seeing Ron is a reminder of what Harry is supposed to be, the life Harry was supposed to lead. This isn’t it, sitting numbly in the house all day, trying to think of everything and nothing all at once.
“Right, do you need me to tell you how ridiculous that is?” Harry hopes he doesn’t, that Malfoy catches himself and can act like a normal person again, blush or scowl or get in on the joke or do anything but
His letter must have been a mess of shame and hurt and longing, pleading with Draco to come back, to explain. Suddenly, Harry is grateful that he doesn't remember the details, it's much less embarrassing this way.
am the one to be blamed for everything?” Potter is instantly furious, temper flaring up like wildfire and scaring the badger away. “
saying you don’t — no, you know what? We aren’t doing this right now. You'll tell me whatever was worth waking me up and then I can
“We are going to bake!” Potter announces, thankfully without drums. Although the drums might have helped, because at least then Draco would have been sure this was the announcement and perhaps he wouldn’t have spent quite this much time blinking at Potter, trying to comprehend what he revealed there.
“What the hell was that, Malfoy?” Potter, for someone who survived literal attempts on his life, doesn’t handle accidents well.
It sounds incredibly sordid, even knowing that nothing untoward happened. Whatever untoward means in this case, they
are the one who decided to turn this arrangement into a constant battle, granting me not one minute to breathe and infesting every single room with these wretched rodents! I wish
that is the answer, but it’s the only thing Harry confirmed. Or perhaps it’s the giant crush on Draco that Harry developed, which came as a surprise to him, but Ginny insisted it was predictable and well-known. Unlikely that Ron meant
Draco lifts his head, inclines it towards Potter and his tempting, tempting lips, curled into a smile of anticipation and satisfaction. Why didn’t they do this sooner? Draco can almost feel Potter’s kiss already, his eyes fluttering shut on their own accord so as to better focus on the sensation of Potter against him—and then a violent wave pushes through Potter, starting in his stomach and hiccuping out of his mouth, onto Draco.
to—to recognise his voice. He melts back into the chair, safe and at peace now that he knows Potter is here with him, that he didn’t leave.
“If you hurt him, we will hurt you.” Granger catches his eyes, makes sure he understands how serious her threat is. Draco understands, he would do the same for his friends. He saw how much Granger cares, what she is willing to do for her friends—she doesn’t need eloquent threats or gory details to be terrifying.
(Harry never should have thought he could fake-marry Malfoy without being forced to acknowledge some very real feelings. Ron should have warned him.)
Draco is still scared, still unsure and hiding, but his hand is forced by the ancient laws of marriage. It doesn’t matter anymore what he wants, he is being pushed through the glass and can only hope that Potter will be there to catch him.
The thing is—this isn’t easy for me, you know? Writing these letters, telling you how I feel—I always think, for one moment, that this is the one I won’t send. That I’ll stop now, that I won’t tell you anything else and act like you never came back into my life. But the owl is insistent and she won’t leave without a letter and so I wrote them, never quite expecting to actually
Harry doesn't wallow in self-pity like that, shutting all the doors and drowning himself in darkness, and, while Grimmauld is a very convenient scapegoat, he does have to accept some of the blame. Perhaps Harry can fault Grimmauld for giving him the opportunity, tempting and haunting Harry, driving him ever closer away from sanity and duty, until he fell down into the abyss, to splash around in the guilt and loathing like he never permitted himself to do. It would have meant death before the war was won, not only Harry's death, but those of countless innocents.
However, there is one sort of letter Draco never wrote. Pride forbid it, wouldn’t let him get the words out even if he might have needed to.
Perhaps there isn’t enough friendship to serve as a solid foundation of love and concern required to make this sort of influence, in the very least understandable. Perhaps Draco is insecure and trying to impress Harry while he considers Pansy his sister in all but blood, which means she is intimately familiar with all Draco is, insecurities and impressive abilities included. Perhaps there is nothing more to it than Harry being
Draco blinks, just once, but when he looks at the world again, its a different one than he closed his eyes on.
It’s more than Malfoy’s imperviousness to manners though, he doesn’t look too well. Harry has no idea where he was all day, but he looks exhausted, frail almost. He doesn’t lose his meticulously cultivated posture, doesn’t slump in on himself or lets his hair fall into disarray, but there is no spark in his eyes, no arrogant irritation in his voice, no
“That doesn’t explain the door thing, you know.” Curse Ron for always being his most observing when Harry has something to hide. Harry never seems to learn from experiences like this, realising that he should keep quiet on the more embarrassing details only when he already spilt them and everyone is waiting for him to elaborate.
“You are not. No more than for not liking spinach, at least —” Draco interrupts him; he resents being compared to
“Oh don’t worry, you are extremely dashing. The dark hair really suits you.” Weasley nods wisely, like he has any understanding of what looks good, like he hasn’t just delivered the worst news possible.
in about who exactly is in trouble. The entire park is full of people ‘celebrating special occasions’—why is it
“Malfoy?” he asks, because clearly his sleepy mind can’t be trusted not to go to preposterous places with no new input.
Draco does not do that. He turns around, realises this is some sort of carnival with dancing animals everywhere, and freezes. He just, stops. He is
Potter has never possessed Draco’s decorum, though, and he grows somber. He pushes himself up, prodding his chin up on his hands, elbows digging into Draco’s chest but it doesn’t matter, because he looks at Draco, eyes burning with an intensity Draco didn’t see since Potter first realised Draco is here to play hero, when he ripped Draco apart to see if he is worthy of that honour.
Harry did his best to say all the right things, he really did, but in the end he just nodded and hummed at what he hoped to be appropriate places. For one, he didn’t think Draco would take kindly to an interruption of his wild gesticulating. The other thing,
Malfoy sits upright in the bed, blankets fallen down around him and his wand calmly trained on Harry, whether to defend or attack Harry isn’t sure. This is markedly different from the last time Harry woke Malfoy in the middle of the night. Though to be fair, it wasn’t technically
“Because I want to do this, Harry. I want to do it for real, out in a world that isn’t built of your mind, where we can be equals. I want to kiss you and take pictures of your smile. I want grass stains to remember this day by.” Draco doesn’t know what he wants, wants the vast endlessness of possibilities and the uncertainty of life, wants to grow and change and build a home with Potter.
Draco has the strangest urge to reassure Weasley, fiddling and pacing. Perhaps because he knows all too well that it feels like to be uselessly waiting, wringing hands because they can’t do anything to help but he also can’t hold them still. Draco knows what Pansy looks like wrecked by worry, what his mother can take before her composure breaks, what Blaise looks like lifeless in a bed just like this one.
They both lay there, huddled into their respective blankets, Harry’s fingers half-tangled in Malfoy’s hair and half stroking his face, gazing into each others eyes without either of them saying a word. It’s not an uncomfortable silence, not as such. It’s not even awkward, doesn’t make Harry itch to move and press an answer out of Malfoy like he would have bet it would, had he been asked prior to this weird night, where nothing seems to be as it should. The silence feels almost pleasant, something gently building between them, taking all the time in the world as they just … lay there.
Harry immediately lets him go, feeling all kinds of horrible as he watches Malfoy shake and spit some disgusting mixture of coffee and saliva back into the mug Harry drank from. There is only so much Harry can blame on being tired and annoyed here, and kissing Malfoy when he explicitly state he doesn’t want to is crossing a big red line.
“I’m sorry, Draco.” Potter looks up at him, eyes green and startling in how suspiciously shiny they are.
I’m sending the owl back one final time, you’d do well to keep her this time around. Don’t you dare send her back, Malfoy!
A clock, Draco is looking at a clock. The pendulum swings, glinting in the light and following the tick, the glass before it polished and shining. Her hair is gracelessly mashed on top, locks curling around the body of the wood like ivy, getting caught in the hands of the clock and tangled up more than she stands any chance of freeing. Granger looks
Potter looks at him with wide eyes, starts lifting one hand like he needs to touch, to anchor and make sure that happened.
Potter gives him a grunt of complaint and waits a whole 5 minutes of companionable breathing, before he is back to gnawing at them.
Potter’s face lights up in understanding and Draco’s decision is made, he wishes he could subtly retreat and
It’s obvious Potter doesn’t take great care of his skin, scars aside Draco is positive he could do better. They don’t share a bathroom, but they don’t need to for Draco to know that Potter doesn’t have the best products to treat his skin — if he has any at all. He seems like the kind of man who fell prey to the rhetoric of 'true men don't spend much time on hygiene' and consequently buys the product that claims to have the most functions, all in the same bottle. Potter spend a long time tracking through the wilderness during the war, and Draco would not be surprised to learn he kept up similar routines of personal hygiene even after that.
It's not possible, of course. His father might have shuffled his priorities beyond recognition, but his mother is still as predictable as she ever was. Which is to say not predictable at all, she is far too clever for that, but Draco has a good grip on what is important to her and what she is willing to do for it. His happiness is important to her, and she already proved that she would be willing to do anything to get him there; interrogating their official hero and saviour is probably already neatly scheduled in her calender. There is no way around that, Draco can't reassure her from afar that he is happy as reasonably feasible, and so it’s only a question of time until they have to face her, but Draco would rather postpone for as long as she allows it.
“You want romance, Malfoy? Want to be wined and dined?” Potter raises his eyebrow at him, cocks his head like he can see Draco better when the world is skewed. Or perhaps he can think better that way, shake around those grey cells of his.
“A Potter-less existence, yes.” Draco nods, his head in Blaise's lap, which makes the movement a bit awkward, but Blaise—who paid more attention in the lessons on hair and braids and is thus allowed to put his hands on Draco’s head—doesn’t mention it, carding his fingers gently through Draco’s hair like they aren’t being disrupted by the movement of Draco nodding. “I never existed without Potter before; I don’t think I like it.”
Draco heaves himself up from the accommodating table, looks at Theo, equally slumped over, and says: “You should kidnap her. Then you can show her the secret house you bought and the life you could have. She’ll see that you could live there and not on the run and eventually, she’ll see reason.”
He probably only meant to get away, but in effect he ends up stumbling right into Harry’s arms, flailing widely and looking horrified.
for calling them stupid, they are very intelligent in their own way. They are masters of camouflage in both snowy and shady habitats, and they will often climb a tree backwards with their hind legs until they're in a handstand to urinate, effectively and deceptively marking their scent higher up. Unless
And then Draco is unceremoniously shoved back onto the couch, their momentary bond against their cruel oppressor over and done with as Blaise passes by them to make some noise in the kitchen. Problems aren't discussed on an empty stomach.
Draco stares at him, tries to understand what he is seeing and utterly fails. Potter, yes, but what happened to his hair? Did Draco die and go to hell? That is the only explanation, the only possible explanation of why there is not a single hair on Potter’s head.
It’s not elegant or well-coordinated—Draco almost chocking as he misjudges how much he can take, too eager—but it ends with Potter’s cock in Draco's mouth and Potter curved over him, both hands buried deep in his hair to keep him exactly where he is. Draco counts it as a stellar success.
Ron doesn’t agree. He raises an eyebrow at Harry in a distinctly mocking, somewhat condescending gesture that is awfully familiar, where did Harry see that — “Parkinson! You said you talked to Parkinson!”
Draco dragged her here though, and there is no avoiding the absolute train wreck that is about to happen.
Potter’s stroking stops, as well as his praise. Draco misses them both with a pang that leaves him cold, aching to have them back.
got that one, because Draco is too small to easily reach the top and he refused to let go of Harry’s hand for something so trivial; prime opportunity for Harry to play the hero and be obnoxious about it) because nothing will happen that wasn’t carefully written down by Blaise. Blaise assured him they were foolproof, so simple a preschooler could follow them.
Harry keeps Draco down as he gives the room a last sweep, a few cursory spells for anything his eyes might have missed, as well as the house beyond the bedroom walls. It’s all fine; no threats, no danger — just a slow morning, sleep already calling to him again.
“Before you ask, this is Robin Hood, the entire story told in animals. I think you should go find a mirror,” Weasley-the-bear suggest, and Draco feverishly prays for all the mirrors to be gone from this world. Whatever Weasley meant, talking about red, Draco dreads it enough to avoid vanity for the duration of his stay.
They land on soft grass (grass that might not even stain, given its cerebral existence; although Draco wouldn’t be surprised—and indeed rather charmed—if grass stains were Potter’s favourite part about grass), Potter tumbling into Draco without pause, talking about how his ear twitched, Draco clinging to him and desperately searching for balance long lost.
Marrying Malfoy, who would have thought Harry would ever be this desperate? It’s not the marriage part Harry has a problem with, that’s the least concerning thing of this whole mess. Harry always wanted to marry. He only thought he would be a little older and marry someone he loved (a woman most likely, too, though he is flexible) but yeah, marriage was always part of the plan.
to — no, don’t freak out! Jesus, Malfoy, I’m not going to kiss you again, relax. I already apologised for that, so you can — actually, it doesn’t matter. I wanted to, well, you look like you could use a hug?” Harry’s voice comes out strangled, pulling the end of his offer up and making it sound like a question. Because apparently the situation wasn’t awkward enough yet. Well done, Potter.
Draco might have forgiven Harry for the ferrets (don't tell him) but it took a lot of coaxing from Pansy to get here. Every time Draco thought the ferrets weren't too bad, that he survived the trauma of 4th year well enough, he will feel something claw up his leg, hear the ominous rustle, and after overcoming the inevitably following panic resolve to never forgive Harry for the first ferret.
“Of course not, that would be rather stupid.” Draco is floundering, and Pansy knows it, raising her eyebrow at him from where she presses her face onto the ferrets head. It could almost be acceptable, docile and securely held in Pansy’s hands, absorbing her affection.
“What, Harry Potter has nothing to say? I didn’t think the day would come.” Draco tries for teasing, increasingly uncomfortable on this strange lake. This cannot be how the movie goes, is it?
“Yes, yes, I’m brilliant, I know.” Draco waves him off—awkwardly, with his left hand, because Potter crushed the right one—and tries very hard not to preen under Potter’s nod and smile. “What
that thing? It's always in the way and hoards dust and garbage, aesthetically unappealing and cumbersome — Draco flops down onto the soft cushioning in a truly ungraceful move he’d be mortified by if it didn’t make Harry smile every time, just a little bit.
20 minutes. Draco needs to tell them. They must know, by now they must, but they still need him to say it. This was his job, he is the professional here and he is damn good at what he does.
, this time, who is the ferret. Metaphorically speaking, Harry checked. Still, Draco looks at him with such disgust that Harry checks again to make sure he didn’t somehow turn into a ferret, after all.
Given that Potter is way behind and there are still more dishes in the kitchen than there are in the shiny thing, Draco proclaims his job done—quietly, lest Potter hears and gives him a second task—and settles in to watch Potter work. He can focus on the last, most stubborn specks of flour later, perhaps Potter even has a Muggle thing for it, since it seems impervious to magic.
“Don’t you ‘darling’ me, Parkinson! I’ve told you before that your bloody owl is a menace and a danger to society that should be locked away.” Theo is
You have since pointed out, in very strong terms, that you did not care for my company. (That, too, was done in unnecessary rudeness. Am I to understand that was in cold deliberation? I so far took it a sign of thoughtless harshness, but your apparent penchant for rudeness casts new light upon these events.)
“I don’t really see the problem here, darling. You have been drooling over Potter for years, constantly talking about him and his oh so green eyes — called them sparkling emeralds and burning and all-consuming, I believe, which is rather embarrassingly infatuated — his smiling and his scowling and his anger issues — trust me when I say you have been thirsting for a chance to tumble into bed with Potter.” And that’s it, all Pansy has to say on the topic. That simple.
“Hearing problems, Malfoy? That can’t be a good sign at your age.” Potter frowns at him, laughs as Draco pokes him in the ribs for it.
Except that he isn’t, Draco knows that he isn’t. He was in there, talked to Potter and saved him more often than he thought he would get the chance to (back then, when Potter saved his life too often for dignity not to count and hurt; Draco swore he would pay his debts) and Draco knows that Potter might
It’s not that Draco didn’t know, he doesn’t shove all of what he is behind the comfort of ignorance, but the vehemence of the feeling is something else in theory than when it hits you in the chest. He would miss them all horribly should they decide to leave one day. Draco wouldn’t know what to do without his friends, and he is suddenly desperately scared of losing them.
Second, Draco is the cousin. Draco grew up in thoughtless splendour, given things with a reckless abandon and no thought to there ever being something he couldn’t have while Harry existed only in what was denied to him.
feels confident going off nothing but the flowers in my kitchen, what more do you want?” They had this very same argument already, when Potter asked Draco for the address and Draco insisted he show him.
Then Malfoy (Potter, now??) grows impatient and tugs him down and their lips crash together and it really hurts, as far as kisses go, but Harry doesn’t care because they are
, and then Malfoy would bring up that Harry already agreed to anything and everything covered by the term ‘renovation’ and be all smug and self-satisfied, because that is what
Draco, unfortunately, doesn’t know the way. Not anymore. He used to be able to manipulate Potter into doing anything with a few well-placed words, tug his strings and watch him dance, but too much has happened, pain changed Potter too much, and Draco doesn’t know him as well as he used to.
“Let’s get on with this, I know how we get in.” Draco is the one giving orders now, as he should have been from the start. He’ll never let Harry plan anything again, this was a disaster.
, exactly. They shared the bed because neither of them was too proud to refuse the only bed not frozen and to sleep somewhere else, where they would have risked loosing a few toes (odd, Harry would have thought if there is one thing they both have in abundance, it’s the unhealthy pride that should have kept both of them far away from the sanctuary of this bed, perhaps in form of competing to see who can bear the cold with more grace) and naturally gravitated towards each other’s warmth. Simple enough.
Writing the letter was easier than saying any of that to Draco in person (not insignificantly because Draco wasn't there to interrupt him, but they could perhaps make that a rule for their big emotional heart-to-heart), which might be explained by the fact that Harry didn't know he was communicating with Draco in any form at all. If Harry sat down now to write some of what he has been thinking, how he misses Draco but doesn't think he understands him, how he needs more time to process but also feels like he waited too long already — well, Harry couldn't do it.
“I’m simply answering the question, Potter. You asked about the requirements of a pure-blood marriage that Grimmauld would accept and one of these factors is the consummation.” Draco almost manages to bring it out smoothly this time. Maybe it will get easier with every repetition? Because that is pretty much what it was, a repetition of the exact same thing he already said. Draco had hoped it might break the tension strung high in the air, like a thread connecting him to Potter.
. Potter will be the death of him. (Draco rather suspects he’ll accept his fate gladly when it comes.)
Malfoy heaves a long-suffering sigh. This sort of thing is exactly why Harry would prefer the git to exploit the system and use his privileges, leave Harry be to knock him down later.
I would like your help. Do you have anything worthwhile to add or was I right to drop you the first time?” Draco realises too late that he has no idea who Weasley is in this world, if he holds the kind of power that could make this a lot more cumbersome than it already is. Pushing back against Weasley has become enough of a reflex that he doesn’t think about it anymore, could probably do it in his sleep.
It’s actually rather more charming than if he concentrated his efforts into tempting Draco, given the context, and Draco can feel hope blooming in him, treacherous and strong.
No, nothing there, everything of it to be taken up by the drawers once they are closed. That’s disappointing but won’t stop Draco.
to the thing. He feels strong sitting on it, Draco knows without Harry admitting to it, like a conqueror, the same triumph echoing through him that they celebrated when they got Grimmauld to allow the couch in. And Draco understands that, he
Kissing Potter is odd. It’s not what Draco was led to believe, rather more awkward than anything else. Potter’s lips are chapped under his, warm and impassive and they both just … stand there. Draco because he doesn't know what the next step is and Potter presumably because he is still in shock at Draco’s show of initiative. Well, whatever it is, it’s quite passable. He should be more relieved, perhaps, that this isn’t half as bad as he feared it would be, but Draco is more disappointed than relieved. At least, he
Harry can barely imagine Draco somewhere outside wilder than a decadent garden, the lawn meticulously watered and the pristine exterior kept up by millions of unseen hands dedicated to preserving a fantasy. Even there, Draco would sit in a gazebo, shielded from the sun and watching tamed nature through the alluded walls. He wouldn’t make it a day out there, not with the most fancy tent magic can draw up. He would mope and complain and be altogether miserable, worried and fretting about noises that are perfectly natural.
“Sorry, just woke up.” Which is a lie, sure, but most likely to placate Draco into settling back down.
Draco doesn’t know what to do with that, wouldn’t know what to think of it even if it didn’t sound like a secret, forbidden. Draco feels like Potter shared something Draco wasn’t meant to know. Which is ridiculous because
Harry suspects it was more of an accident than a subtle message, that Draco forgot for a few precious moments, but it was nice to hold him again, to lay on that couch that Harry might seriously owe his life and happiness to. Harry didn’t voice his suspicions.
Then Harry sinks down on one knee, and all the answers and comments Draco might have had go flying out of his mind.
Harry doesn’t understand it as such. His eyes light up in challenge and he leans forward, pulling Draco in with nothing but that spark. Draco is helpless to do anything but lean in further, an awed fool come to marvel at Harry's glory.
for Draco to deal with, has he? They would hardly be in this situation if Harry would, just once, behave like any of the people Draco usually surrounds himself with. Draco doesn't know how Harry would react.
Should Harry go and get Pansy? Nothing he says seems to help, in fact Harry is pretty sure he is making it worse, but the thought of needing
“I accept your reasoning so far.” Potter grins like he already won. “But none of this explains why you have to marry at all.”
“They are in the kitchen, probably not cooking and making the entire restaurant go hungry,” Potter answers, fondly exasperated with his friends. Draco understands, he only saw them here and only in snippets, but he has no doubt that the two of them can be insufferable when they put their mind to it.
“I change the deal, then. You aren’t getting this room.” Harry is stubborn, always has been, and if the price for it is Grimmauld going back to hating him for a while, he is fine with that.
He remembers Potter’s surprise at seeing Draco, remembers how he didn’t trust Draco to be real, that he would be here to do what he asked and save him.
The river stretches a lot longer than Draco thought it would, no interruptions or monsters and Potters least of all. Draco would think Weasley gave him wrong directions, if such a thing were possible.
in turn never subjected his hair to—friendly banter, insults exchanged with a sincere smile in the spirit of mutual fondness. Safety.
“I promise I will write you the most glowing review! I’d sing an ode to your talents, if only you’d let me.” Draco doesn’t let his smile waver, nudges the tea closer towards Potter.
“We can’t all be pretentious bastards, Malfoy, some of us don’t grow up knowing ballroom dances and proper dinner etiquette.” The way Potter says it sounds very much like he
Potter needn't have worried; the way Pansy talks about these two, she would be willing to commit at least as many felonies as Potter should something happen to them. She would look better doing it too, if you take her word on that, though Draco personally always found something magnificent in Potter’s anger.
“Merlin, Draco, I’m so sorry! I thought you knew. You asked so many questions, and I never wanted to outright say because I didn’t want to be that wanker that hands out labels for his own convenience, just going around pressing people into boxes — I gave you hints! I thought you might start doing your own research, discover everything organically and see how it fits, you know?” Draco doesn’t. He doesn’t know; that is rather the point.
It’s harder to remember the closer Harry gets, and when he shuts his eyes, Draco is hit with the ridiculous thought that it could be
alright with it to be doing it in the middle of day (although, Harry was supposed to be at the Weasleys’ for at least another hour, Draco probably thought he would have more time), then Harry surely would have noticed sooner!
Although, considering what Harry said so far, perhaps he shouldn't say anything more. Asking Draco about his favourite movie — what was he thinking? First, Harry is relatively certain Draco doesn’t know what a movie
In a flash of utter brilliance at a very young age, Draco decided that he would need a secret door to escape the house and the oppressive force of his parents when he would grow to be a rebellious teenager. Obviously that never quite happened. Whether that is to blame on the war or Draco’s lack of initiative isn’t quite certain, but the door is there in any case.
, but not even the Dreamless Sleep (enough of it to knock out a fully-grown troll) helped. He’s never getting to tomorrow at this rate.
Before he can change his mind and try to erase Harry’s memory in panic, Draco pushes the shelf aside and gestures Harry through, pulling the door closed behind them.
Right, they will start on the living room next. That is fine. It’s good, even. Draco is sorely missing some bookshelves.
Hermione looks at Ron, too, equally impressed but far less lewd, thank Merlin. Ron doesn’t seem less pleased by Hermione’s admiration though, which makes sense because they have been in love for far too long for Parkinson's weird advances to matter. Harry nods to himself, satisfied. His friends might be a little bit stupid about this, but not stupid enough to give each other up.
and moved in together, and Grimmauld was rather pushy for a stuffy old house — it shouldn’t came as a surprise that they had gotten closer in the process. The crying and the hugging was unexpected, as was the laughter, but looking back, Draco doesn’t see how it could have been different. He doesn’t
Theo would know, he always finds his way out of social obligations while remaining perfectly amiable and impeccably polite. Blaise would just get up and leave, Draco could simply follow him under the guise of scolding him. Pansy would have a wonderfully entertaining, unsettlingly threatening answer for Potter to chew on. Draco needs them here, needs all of them and needs them now. He cannot deal with all of this, with
“Right. I won’t lie, Potter, I’m not convinced. I rather believe she was doing her job, which is to deliver letters to you.” Draco could have phrased that one gentler, yes, especially given that owls are a sore subject between them, but it seems to do the trick.
That isn’t to say that no one knows about his secret; his friends know for sure because they are horrible snoops with no understanding of boundaries, and Draco is pretty sure his parents felt the distortion in the wards, but Draco never
“What do you think, Malfoy, did you managed to save him?” Granger asks and she definitely knows something Draco doesn’t, smirking at him and not concerned with Potter laying in his bed, frail and possibly still comatose.
instance —” Draco can always name a myriad of instances, but usually Pansy sweeps those off with a wave of her hand and a charming smile.
Luna, too, isn’t here when she would be invaluable. Luna has a strange dislike for movies and the TV and rarely joins them. She tried explaining it to Harry once, but it sounded remarkably like old people warning the uncouth youth about their eyes going square and their brains turning to mush and Harry tuned her out on instinct before he fully realised what he was doing. He didn’t ask again.
“You are smiling,” Pansy points out, voice soft and, for once, not teasing him about having Feelings. Draco wishes she were; he could snap at her and write it off as Pansy being Pansy, no need to think about the words or their meaning.
This is exactly where Draco wanted him, he would have to be stupid to stop now.  Draco knows what he has to say next, Blaise raved enough about the romance books he likes to read that at least in theory Draco is equipped to handle every possible situation.
Yes, this is Potter’s sanctuary, the one place where he can be himself in a world full of raging hatred, the port in a storm and the fruit of hours upon hours of labour. This is
Draco is a journalist, his word is gospel when a few years back, people barely deigned to spit on him—he will write an article on Harry Potter.
Why isn’t he touching Potter? Why is he kneeling here, like a bloody imbecile, when he could have that glorious cock in his hand?
Better yet: Draco is going to deny all of this. It’s more than likely that Harry is teasing him, that he doesn’t know his mother at all. Yes, that must be it. Harry thinks he is clever and hilarious, congratulating himself to a prank well played. He doesn’t know Draco’s mother and he is not going to see any embarrassing pictures of Draco. Yes, exactly. Draco nods, satisfied with the result he settled on.
Pansy grabs his hands for support, looks at him very solemn and Draco is getting worried — what happened and why is he only now hearing about it? Did Pansy already kill someone and needs them to cover up the tracks? Does she plan another risky act of crime and liberation to free animals from their cruel prison and is asking him for help after he nearly died the last time and she promised him he would never have to come along again? But why would she need Potter for that? Does she want him to protect her from societies scorn?
to help you anymore.” Weasley sticks his tongue out at him—that is the level of intimidating he is—and turns around to walk over to Granger and curl up under one of her wings, helpfully lifted for him.
“Wonderful, then get to it.” Granger breaks the moment, blundering between emotions she has no patience for. The bond that she cares about is the contract Draco signed, his signature under the pledge to do all that is possible—that’s all she needs. No promise is better than a contract.
would see it that way. I didn’t think you would care about animals, let alone to that amount.” Weasley says it as if that excuses his laughter, which is
“Well, have you talked to them?” Draco is relentless, spoon feeding Harry the realisation he just decided he doesn’t want to have. Harry wishes Draco would shut up, that he stayed in the living room, inappropriately cosy with Parkinson. But the question is asked, and whether Harry voices it out loud or not, the answer is ringing in his mind just as clear.
“How about we start with St. Mungo’s?” Draco watches Potter carefully, seeks for any signs of upset or flight.
“Alright,” Potter laughs, not terribly put out. “Since you asked so nicely, you may open your eyes to this unending beauty.”
“I already locked away the infernal bags of fur, warded the room thrice to be sure, so they won’t be in your way,” Malfoy finally concludes, smiling brightly at Harry. It's an unsettling sight to say the least. Malfoy doesn’t
Then Potter shushes him, warm and sure against him and Draco remembers that the wall was awfully hard, that he didn’t like it and wanted for Potter to return. He does miss the cold, though.
Nothing, not all the anticipation and waiting in the world, couldn’t have prepared Draco for the sight of Potter when he is making an effort.
Hoping to hide his burgeoning smirk behind the mug he quickly takes it when Malfoy offers, taking a gulp of coffee and pulling Malfoy closer — unsuspecting and smug as he is, he is easy to move once you get past the shocked flailing — to hold him against himself and press a kiss onto his mouth, graciously sharing his coffee with him.
“The dragon riders are … mystical figures, I suppose is what you would call them. There is no definite proof that they ever existed and common sense tells you that dragons would sooner eat you than allow themselves to be petted, but the stories have persisted. Perhaps it’s the thrill of danger, the illicit temptation of freedom just beyond our grasp, waiting for those brave enough to jump.” Draco used to dream of being a dragon rider, of flying high over the clouds and leaving behind whatever problem he was having, growing smaller and more insignificant with every beat of these wings.
“Right, obviously,” Draco echoes, completely normal and composed, because he very much is over his crush, thank you.
to scare Harry into making him breakfast in bed for three months, lest Draco feels slightly unhappy and call upon him his mother’s wrath. It’s what family does, how they show they care.
, Potter, I’m rather certain that qualifies as knowing someone.” Draco doesn’t understand where this hare-brained idea comes from, why Potter is this insistent that Draco ‘meet his friends’.
He doesn’t say any of that to Ron; Harry has the feeling he wouldn’t approve. Instead, he makes a vague humming noise, to be interpreted anyway Ron chooses.
He dreads having to justify this to Malfoy, who probably won’t be too pleased when he wakes up and finds himself smothered, but for now Harry really likes this. It’s a contrasting kind of intimacy, stolen as it is at the moment, one that feels more profound than anything else they shared. Harry can almost see it, how easily they might slip into domestic bliss form here. They would start sleeping in the same bed on their own accord, not because Grimmauld pushed them to, and wake up like this, tangled together and peaceful, weirdly intimate conversations held at night that Harry won’t have to doubt because it’s simply part of how they work, a beloved tradition that started right here.
“Indisposed at the moment. I’m sure she is making her way up. You should answer Harry, by the way, he is quick with that pan and ruthless. If he knocks you out again and I have to stick my tongue up your ear to wake you, I will be very cross.” Weasley doesn’t
Little good as it did as an argument, they all already know each other. Draco was right in that, and he was right in worrying about the impression he left, too. He might not have outright admitted to that, but Harry isn’t stupid; he can read between the lines. Draco's shame was practically screaming. Harry didn’t know what to say to that (he still doesn’t know, what
“How could it be cheating if I never claimed anything else?” That is … actually, that is unfairly correct. Technically.
who dragged them down first, because he was holding — Capt'n! Draco hasn’t seen her at all since the world shifted, and there is only one possible explanation for that, growing bigger and more horrifying with every second that Draco doesn’t have clear confirmation.
“Alright then, tell me about your never ending love for the prat and then we can eat ice cream and make plans on how you’ll get him back, alright?” Blaise, because he is a good friend and Draco should always tell him about all his problems, contains his exasperation to the bare minimum. For that alone Draco should perhaps spare him the worst of his pathetic longing.
“Did you mean that?” Draco asks, because he has to know. His voice is terribly small, and he doesn’t
Well, that probably means Draco won this round. Potter is unconscious and Draco had the last word, nasty ones at that. Draco definitely won. Even if he is also the one who has to deal with the giant hole in the floor.
“What are you saying, Draco?” Draco doesn’t notice the new quality to his voice, doesn’t realise how much depends on his next words.
No, the only thing Draco didn’t admit to himself was how close he was to breaking over it and how little it would take to get him there. Harry, as ever, succeeded in finding his weaknesses.
panicked and Harry has no idea what he did to provoke that kind of reaction but whatever, Malfoy leaving the bed to him means he doesn’t have to share, anything else can wait until tomorrow. If only because Malfoy is already out of the door, so he would have to get up and run after him and try to convince Malfoy to stay and really, that just isn’t worth the effort.
“Wherever you want to go,” he answers, taking Potter’s hand back and planting a soft kiss on it. (He ignores the vaguely panicked spluttering sound Weasley makes at
“Weasley,” Draco hisses, not taking his eyes of Potter getting his life squeezed out of his body. “Weasley, what is going on?”
Dust flies up to dance in the light, falling on the bed in the middle of the room like it’s illuminating a prize, guiding Draco’s eyes like he could look at anything but Potter.
The sounds rings warm in his ears, the way Draco says his name, hesitant as if fearing Harry might insists on Potter, rich and golden like honey. Intimate, above all. Yeah. Harry much prefers this to Potter and Malfoy.
Draco is still talking, narrating the meticulous and not actually that complicated process of preparing coffee, complaining about virtually everything. It should not be endearing. It shouldn’t be and Harry valiantly tries to remain stoic, but soon he finds himself smiling, caught up in Draco’s little frown and the dramatic distaste he holds for everything even vaguely connected to coffee. How far would Draco go, Harry wonders, how long would he rant for and what else would fall under his wrath-covered embarrassment?
“Why shouldn’t I? The only reason I married you at all is so Grimmauld would give me a break. It doesn’t, so you aren’t holding up your end of the deal,” Potter spits out, watching in satisfaction as Draco staggers back at the words.
Potter looks tired. That’s the first thing he notices, the bags under his eyes and the slump of his shoulders, the general air of defeat hanging over him like a vulture. His pyjamas are ill-fitting and baggy, his hair a tousled mess and his glasses crooked, shoved onto his face with little care. He looks like a man in dire need of a holiday, a month of nothing but deep sleep and good food.
Pansy will make him talk anyway, about flowers and breakfast and heavy furniture carried through narrow corridors.
Logic still doesn’t matter, though, and the man screams in pain as the not-sword pierces into his back.
“It took its toll though, on her and all of us. Now I don’t know who I need to be. My father has taken to gardening, which, trust me, is far more disconcerting in person than words. I don’t think he cares anymore if I go into politics or become an underpaid teacher, as long as I drop by for tea and to admire his Geraniums. He is a different man these days, and I don’t think I know that man. Mother acts like nothing is changed, not in the essentials. And who knows, perhaps she is right. She tends to be. But she always wanted me to be
He drapes himself across Draco’s chest, warm and heavy like a giant Kneazle, and Draco doesn’t hesitate before burying his fingers in his hair, feeling it between his fingers, smooth and full. Draco closes his eyes, allows himself to get lost in the repetitive motion, in Potter’s breath soft on his neck.
Then Potter emerges out of the cabinet and makes a triumphant noise, a book clutched in his hand. (Why does he keep books in his cabinets? Hasn’t he heard of bookshelves?) He holds the book up like it’s a grand prize, like he is
instinct has always been to be an insufferable brat. “There is no cure, nothing that helps; I tried everything.”
“Who would have guessed you are such a romantic? But what kind of fiancé would I be if I didn’t satisfy your bleeding heart? How about this: Dearest Harry, love of my life, apple of my eye, light of my mornings and moon of my nights, I will gladly marry you.”
ruler (he wouldn’t, that’s a lie for his campaigning, don’t tell the peasants), he can count himself lucky that his pretty head remains resting on his elegant shoulders.
People are supposed to look peaceful in death, at rest. Potter doesn’t. Potter looks tense, lines of a hard life etched into his face and a heavy absence hanging over him like an ugly vulture. No, Potter doesn’t look peaceful in death. Near death. Granger made it very clear, several times, that Potter isn’t
Interspersed by cruel laughter as his source might have been, Harry did learn some useful things, too. He learnt of the negotiations, of the three of them sitting down to talk and flesh out rules, discuss how they were going to attempt this. Harry didn’t believe a single word Parkinson said, solely on the account that it’s
dedicated to him, come to think of it), because the man is still huge in crouching, blocking Draco’s way towards safety and sweeping Potter out of here.
, wold you?” Granger is sneering with determination now, the expression ugly and wrong on her face. She wears it well, though, convincing and cold. This is exactly why the entire world is justified in being terrified of Hermione Granger.
Harry won’t let him. He will protect this room — this window to the past and failed futures and people he never knew — with whatever it takes, no price too high. If Malfoy is half as smart as he likes to think he is, he won’t push Harry. If he has any of that famed self-preservation, he’ll leave and forget all about the room.
what you are wearing?” The officer gestures at Harry, at the torn jeans and the worn shirt, at the entire low-effort-ness of his outfit. “No way is this man”—rude thumb pointing at Malfoy—“going to marry
Draco doesn’t get a proper answer before there is movement again, too small to be a wolf. Potter and Weasley both hold their breath, baited in anticipation, as Granger makes her slow way up the hill standing against the clearing.
you were a Hufflepuff, I would certainly like you more than I do now.” That hurts. It shouldn’t, Draco already knew all of that, but it
Draco, unaware of the doom quickly approaching to announce the end of movie nights, heaves a long suffering sigh.
This is … this is odd. Honestly, Draco would have sooner expected him to laugh than be impressed beyond words (and the more time passes without Harry whirling around to ridicule him, Draco realises how unlikely that was to happen). Objectively, it’s only a room, with books and toys and a bed, nothing that warrants speechless astonishment. Not that it doesn’t flatter Draco’s ego, he gladly takes Harry’s silence as a compliment.
Draco has managed to hide from Potter for a week now. As well as you can hide from someone when the house you share doesn’t know personal boundaries and is insistent on pushing you together. Draco does his best to sneak out of the rooms they suddenly find themselves shut in, but Grimmauld has turned horribly on him, cutting off all his escape routes. It has been a week of tense silences and speculating looks from Potter’s side of the room that Draco did his best to ignore. If it were at all feasible, Draco would have gladly gone on like this.
It means wiping out that smile as he reminds Potter of what he doesn’t want to think about. Ironic, how you need to face some things in order to escape from them.
Harry would love to see, they never liked Harry so much as carrying them to the bathroom but seeing Malfoy almost be drowned by angry ferrets might make their little quirk worth it).
“I did save you, only you. I stumbled into my arms, defeated and bloody, and Shan Yu was towering behind you. If I had kept to the rules, he would have slain you and all of us with you. You would have lost, Malfoy, and I would have waited for the next hero to come along.” Potter is staring at him, like he is parting with secret knowledge he wants Draco to have,
to play a few more of them, just a few. And then his fingers were moving on the strings, slowly but with increasing surety, faster as he went on to discover more and more, everything tinged in the joy of remembering old dance lessons except better, because
“You really want to go back to how things were? To me blindly taking whatever I want, and you gritting your teeth through it? To lies and no trust and this pushy house the only reason we are even still married?” Harry doesn’t wait for an answer, growling and ripping away from Draco.
“Yes, Malfoy?” Potter says, because he is a prick and doesn’t care that Draco is trying to protect his fragile ego here.
“You don’t have to be ashamed of your love, Pansy dear. Quite the opposite, in fact. You won me a favour from Potter.” That immediately gets all the eyes on him and Draco curses his compulsory sharing of anything Potter.
, or anything else soft and fluffy you might have called her. The owl is a ruthless beast and terrorised me into writing letters so that you could spoil her.”
“Cut my hair?” Potter backs away like Draco threatened to cut it right now, clutching at the strands brushing his shoulders to protect them from evil scissors.
(It only took that one time, standing in front of Sirius’ room, the calming intimacy they shared a heady drug Harry missed the moment they let go of each other.)
They would still have what Draco treasured, as evidenced by their current position, but maybe Harry would find some other way to slake his desires. Maybe he will find
is sleeping, like they dropped into it while going about their day as usual. It’s a curse, Draco feels pretty safe in saying that, given the dragon out there and all. It’s Muggle magic, of course, but Draco recognises a curse when he sees one.
They both grin at him now, unbearably smug. If there wasn’t that favour on the line, Draco would leave them to their own insufferable company. (He would come back, because he can’t leave Potter the way he is, but that doesn’t matter.)
“Right, if you could both sign then please? I do have other things to do than watch you two flirt.” Ron looks like he accidentally bit into a lemon, glancing between them meaningfully enough to convince the blind, as if there was any way Harry could have misunderstood what he meant. Merlin, Harry
?” Harry makes sure his words are infused with mocking, reflecting Malfoy's own phrasing back at him to make him confront how ridiculous it is. Malfoy doesn’t appreciate it.
Draco reminds himself of that as he watches Harry add salt, reminds himself sharper as he watches Harry add sugar and he almost says out loud in an official reminder as Harry gets up to collect more things from the pantry. It’s all good, Draco didn’t expect to cook anything perfect so adjustments are … good. He can learn from this. Mistakes are a crucial part of improvement. He doesn’t care about the cooking anyway, therefore it doesn’t matter if Harry silently judges him for being terrible at it. Honestly.
Draco leaves and he can taste Potter’s disdain like bile in his mouth, cruel words echoing in his mind, laughing, taunting him.
. Where Draco is concerned, Harry never has problems figuring out if he should run, something he is completely unable to judge in his mother. Thankfully, Draco is here, too, acting as translator between the two of them. Going by the irritation pressed into one quick glance and a vicious stomp on his foot, Harry is barely still safe. Not that Harry needed the warning; he is well aware he almost gave away their ruse with his comment.
introducing them, he just sought to make this situation as smooth as possible. That used to mean keeping his parents informed on a factual level without forcing them to acknowledge the reality of his marriage by inviting them over for tea.
Yes, Draco decides, he cannot take this seriously. It’s absurd, the entire situation is utterly absurd — Harry’s quirked eyebrow, the smirk tugging at his lips, the hand now causally pouring in ever more of the lemon juice. Draco is oddly calm in that absurdity Harry created. After all, what does it matter if Harry finds out he has been kind-of-not-technically lying to him? It doesn’t matter at all, because Harry is ridiculous and he doesn’t care about how many fancy meals Draco is able to cook. He is uncultured like that.
What Harry truly needs, since Plan A failed, is an ally. He has plenty of people to choose from, so that should be easy, but Harry has an inkling that it won’t be. After all, would he need this elaborate planning if it were easy?
“For the love of Merlin, stop!” The entire pub falls silent at Ron’s outburst, people grumbling and staring, evenly parted between disgruntled and intrigued. Harry waves at them, grateful that they chose a Muggle pub and they are getting attention for the odd choice of words and not the odd scar on his forehead.
“They are said to have lived together in small groups, tribes, united under a leader who set the course. The legends disagree on how many of these tribes existed, whether there even was more than one, and most stories are focused on the same tribe. The Captain’s tribe. Mother told me stories about her and the adventures she led her people on, about the dragons and the creatures they met. She was the only logical choice to name my own dragon after.
“Seriously? It’s looking pretty clear to me.” Maybe Ron needs to see a memory, needs to see Draco’s face when he told him the truth. Ron couldn’t possibly be this stubborn if he heard the malice in Draco’s voice, the disgust and hurt and anger and —
“Out of the way,” Potter barks at him, manoeuvring a heavy plate dangerously close past Draco’s head.
that. They don’t care about it, too stoic to trigger the hunters instinct. They look for something smaller, something warm and squirming, slick with blood and screaming in agony. They look for something to swallow whole, hide and hair.
“Don’t fall asleep on me, Malfoy,” Potter says, and Draco feels the words rumbling in Potter’s chest.
Theo won’t do Pansy any good today — Draco won’t tell them a single thing. He’s managed this for so long — years of fascinated bewilderment and feeling lonely and alienated — and Draco will make it through the shattering end of his marriage, as well. And in the end, when they’ve signed all the papers and divided their property, when they’ve fought viciously over Grimmauld and dredged up every bit of possibly painful information and insight they have on the other, once they’ve utterly destroyed the image they held and loved so dearly, then Draco will still have his friends to return to. Just like it has always been.
Perhaps it was Potter, sparing him from the fire and making him incombustible. Perhaps it was luck and Draco stood far enough away.
Instead of facing two Malfoys trying to pin him down with his faults and crimes, which is what Harry expected and prepared himself for, he now has to deal with mother and son making polite small talk, and trying to find something intelligent to add so he doesn’t seem dull or disinterested. Every time Harry allows himself a moment to contemplate how to turn this situation in his favour, Narcissa notices, exploiting his carelessness to shoot him a question Harry answers without thinking, revealing all kinds of unflattering things about himself — ranging from his tendency to raid the fridge after nightmares, up unto the admission that he currently sleeps on his best friends’ couch.
(Using his stance as hero and saviour to excuse less glorious deeds — Harry never wanted to be that kind of person, the kind that abuses power and influence to make themselves feel better about the horrible people they have become. Harry literally
Just when Draco thinks Potter finally gathered enough wit to have a response (he used to be faster than that, his snark and objectively good looks are literally the only thing that make him bearable) Potter stands up, wraps the blanket around him like a king would his coat (Draco resents how much Potter forces that king metaphor onto him. He is resolved to see nothing kingly about the prick anymore.) and struts out of the room in icy silence, head held high.
“Malfoy? Come on, don’t faint on me.” Trust Potter and his obnoxiousness to save Draco from losing himself in his thoughts.
“No yelling in my kitchen, Malfoy. Now grab the flour, it’s in that cabinet.” Potter points at the cabinet in the upper right corner—because of course he does, Draco is he won’t be able to get the flour without embarrassing scrambling—and Draco, perplexed but endeared, goes to do as he is told.
“Wait — why did you say Weasleys then? Unless Granger and Weasley managed to sneak away from all the papers and rumours without anyone noticing and remarking on it — Granger might be smart, but that requires a kind of intelligence I seriously doubt either of them possesses, possibly they never even heard of it— they aren’t married,” Millicent points out, because she can be tediously insistent on matters such as this. It comes in handy quite often, but Draco has long since given up counting the times Millicent ruined his rhetoric masterpieces by clinging to her technicalities. Judging by the smirk she only makes a token effort to conceal, Millicent is well aware of and thoroughly enjoying Draco’s irritation. Lovely.
“I don’t think I have to tell you what kind of people I am related to, or what kind of grotesque toys I received in response. Looking back, I am honestly surprised how many of them were willing to indulge the pleas of a child. But willing they were and I collected countless toys, some of them even charmed but not a single one cursed, which my parents were very concerned about and led them to test each and every toy several times. They didn’t want to let me keep them at first, after they found out what I had done, but I insisted. Capt’n needed friends, and I was so very pleased with how my scheme turned out, I didn’t even care that they were all creepy. I loved them dearly and so they stayed.
meet him, and their potential friendship died a slow, agonising death. It was too late at that point though, Draco had developed a weakness for their Golden Boy, and there was nothing he could do about it.
care. So you better stop being a wanker, or I’ll have to stomp onto your foot again and, as we just established, neither of us would like that.” Potter looks triumphant for all but one moment, before he abruptly falls again. Draco barely manages to catch him, swooping him up in arms and holding him close.
“I wanted to ask if you had reconsidered yet.” Draco smiles his most charming smile, straight white teeth and all unholy glee about getting his fingers on Potter’s story hidden behind professional excitement.
Harry thought Malfoy might scowl at him, or wrinkle his nose, something silly and endearing while he mutters about propriety and discretion — but
friends but being kind enough to not make a fuss about the lack of welcome she received. “As for the plate, I don’t think I shall need one. I’m sure I will find a kind soul to share with me.”
, despite how sure Hermione was they could be mature about this. Ron at least never expected Harry to be responsible and level-headed when it comes to Malfoy, but admitting that they are still no better than the tiny 2nd years they used to be, fighting over who has the best broom (Harry, without a doubt; Malfoy’s might have been newer but there was a
“I am talking about how you take more than what we agreed upon. You want your entertainment? Fine, you may have that. You want something to do, want to bite and mark and bleed your frustration until you feel better — all part of the deal, all part of your due. But you have
"For the last time, I am not going to marry just so I can keep living in a judgemental house!" Harry might not have grown out of his temper as much as he likes to think. At least it usually hits intrusive reporters who deserve it or Hermione, who barely takes a second to look unimpressed before going back to her notes and references, trying to intimidate Harry into compliance with terms longer than his own name. It works scarily often, but Harry already made his mind up on this one.
“Why? Why would you ever want to leave?” Potter asks, sounding so painfully confused it hurts. Draco wants to hug him close and lie, tell him there is no reason, that the world is simple and perfect and that they can stay here forever.
“Was that part of the movie? Should I have stayed and saved Potter in some different manner, more pleasing to the almighty movie god?” Draco, at this moment, feels very much done with the whole thing. Is saving Potter even worth it if the git always leaves at the end?
“You are talking about Potter’s Weasley and Granger!” Blaise finally says, triumph written over his face. Draco doesn’t point out that they are
It’s very impressive, actually, how Weasley stands his ground. Draco remembers him in Hogwarts, remembers a boy flighty from insecurity, his bark louder than his very hesitant bite. Weasley is no longer that boy, unsure of his place among friends and the world at large. Weasley has grown into a man, sure of himself and his ability, gaze heavy on Draco and telling him to get out.
plan of yours.” Pansy doesn’t believe him, but that’s okay. Draco will convince her. (And if not, well, it’s not
“Ron,” Granger admonishes, finally taking a positing in the debate. Draco is pretty sure she is on his side, though she is suppressing an awful lot of laughter to be rightfully indignant.
“No, mother, you are perfectly aware of the situation.” A little too aware, if Draco had his way, but he never stood a chance at concealing anything from her, let alone his pathetic and stubbornly persistent crush on Potter.
Potter’s cock feels even better than it looks. There is something soft like velvet about it, unforgiving and yet soft to the touch, and Draco loves the contrast.
“Then I met you. It was in Madam Malkin’s, the first clothes I got that weren't hand me downs from Dudley, clothes that didn’t only fit properly but were
“I think it does, yeah.” Potter smirks at him, smug and satisfied and dizzy. Draco wants to see him like that every day.
Ron doesn’t seem to know what to answer to that, or perhaps he is giving Harry time to process what he said, but Harry appreciates the following silence in either case. He has a lot to think about.
“Let me do introductions, so that you may know what a good choice you made, begging for me to take you back. I am your mentor, here to teach you the art of heroism and the skill of saving Damsels in Distress.” Weasley bows, deep enough for his horns to brush the surface of the water. Draco is tempted for one very short second to splash water into his face to pay for making him grovel, when Granger watches him with narrowed eyes. Weasley comes up back dry and none the wiser.
Draco—because he likes his life and he isn’t foolish enough to underestimate her—nods his assent. There is no sense arguing with them, now that they made their mind up. Trying to dissuade them would not only be futile and frustrating, but also waste time Potter might not have. Draco plain doesn’t know what put Potter in this bed, if it’s eating at him this very moment or if he could lay here for years to come, his condition unchanged. Granger is right, they need to go immediately.
“Lovely,” Granger says, as impressed as Draco with these two idiots. If things keep going like they are, she might grow on Draco. (He is almost looking forward to it, there are worse people to be friendly with than Granger, whip smart and influential.) “Can the jokes wait until
not to break away out of pure stubbornness—this is Potter’s table, after all, everything is possible. There is only the lamp, massive and sturdy and practically
a good friend, but a vile double-agent, corrupted by the snake in his bed. He isn’t the least bit repentant about it, either; he wasn’t as he told Harry the
His hopes were severely disappointed. Grimmauld made no moves to accept Potter, as if doubting their marriage, and so they are still forced into close proximity more often than not. Draco is tired of it, has been for a long while now, and he doesn’t know what else he needs to sacrifice to afford Potter the freedom to leave him be. What more does he have left to give?
name, and not only would that twat be horribly smug about it, Harry Malfoy also sounds really bad. After Malfoy refused to take Harry’s name, as was to be expected, and everyone agreed a hyphenated name would be quite the mouthful and defeat the purpose of presenting as a unit to Grimmauld, there was nothing left but Black. All in all, by far the best option. It’s Sirius’ name, after all, though Harry suspects he never wanted it any more than he wanted this house.
“Hilarious, Weasley. I don’t think I will, though, you see—” Weasley doesn’t wait for Draco to explain himself, taking a menacing step closer like he would physically shove Draco through the Floo, if necessary. (Draco wouldn’t put it past him; Gryffindor brutes, no appreciation for the gentler persuasion.)
“Does anyone have any objections?” This is their last chance to walk away from the door and try their luck in the corridor stretching away from them. Draco wants to give Granger and Weasley at least the illusion of a choice.
Initially, Harry was relieved to read that, glad that he was right about one thing and that they could talk about it, and Draco could explain what is still very much an absurd idea to Harry, but that hope was disappointed a few words later. Draco is even more confused than Harry as to what exactly that means for him.
By then Draco hesitated for too long, and Granger’s face grows grim, like a suspicion she didn’t like proved true. Because Draco didn’t change after all.
“I would appreciate your opinion on the couch I picked for the living room. I have concerns about your menagerie of friends fitting.” Draco tries hard to give the offer as unstudied an air as possible, to pretend his heart isn’t shaking in his chest at the possibility of Harry exploiting this, demanding more than Draco can give at the moment and crowing in victory when he takes it from him anyway.
take on the recipe. Harry’s never understood how Draco can be glued to the letter when it comes to potions and skip whole sides when it comes to cooking, but it might have something to do with the fact that, in cooking, it’s
Heroes consumed by unfocused wrath and with no personhood left are dangerous for everyone — you need to read just one Batman comic to know that (and Harry has read several, Dudley was a fan for few weeks, until he decided the depicted violence wasn’t worth the required reading).
“Fine, then, I consent, you can do whatever you want — always could. Does that make it better?” Surely it must? Draco doesn’t have the patience to deal with Harry’s guilt, not on this. Harry feels guilty about everything, all the time, and Draco understands it concerning the war (they
“But that is what you thought?” Harry is well trained in pressing answers out of Draco, even when he already knows the answer, when he already knows he won’t like it because it’s either a lie or, what’s worse, the truth.
Yes, now that Blaise says it, that sounds about right. People don’t get kidnapped for marriage anymore, it’s gone a bit out of fashion. Draco supposes that’s a good thing,
Careful to project his movement and intentions, Draco gently disentangles his fingers from his hair. Harry doesn’t protest, blinks at Draco and lets him guide his hands down, smiles when Draco gives them a slight squeeze. Draco would do far more than bear a little discomfort to be allowed to make him smile like that.
“My, Malfoy—I had no idea! Right here?” Potter clutches at his throat, looking scandalised but also like he truly does consider going to his knees, practically unprompted, and be indecent in public. Draco thinks he might have discovered something there, something that will require more thorough thought later.
each other. I could see the future like that, could see meeting Draco’s friends and parents, finally burning down the kitchen when we got too ambitious for our miserable cooking skills, and perhaps, if I dared to think that far into the future, remodelling a few of the useless parlours and guest rooms into nurseries.” Harry would have asked Draco to draw up some plans, they would have bickered over colours and what kind of toys to get, debated the use for a nursery at all because Harry would be loath to let any child out of his sight, at least in the first few months, probably years. The child,
to know better what kind of trauma Potter is refusing to acknowledge. You did a lot, Draco, more than would usually be expected from you. If Potter is too hurt or too blind to take the hand you offered, then that’s on him. It doesn’t excuse him from behaving like a decent human and treating you kindly. Or telling you if he can’t do that, I suppose. There is no excuse for abusing your desire for a relationship and he apologised for the yelling and I’m prepared to forgive him for the uneven nature of your beginning, but let him take the next step.
“This is the last chance you are getting to save your life,” Draco lies; the creature is already as good as dead. “Set down the man and no one needs to be harmed.”
“I still don’t understand why we have to sneak in here. I thought you said you had a good relationship with your parents?” Harry makes enough noise to wake the dead, moving with all the grace of a stumbling fawn. It would be more entertaining if Draco didn’t have very good reasons for the secrecy.
going to lose,” Potter begins to protest with a vehemence that would make his Weasley proud. Pity it’s all delusions.
For now, Draco moves past them, fingers pressing along the warm skin behind them, stroking and searching—Potter yells, pushing Draco down and pressing himself closer, cock pulsing and spilling in his mouth, making garbled sounds that might be Draco’s name.
Harry has had many chances to watch that particular behaviour over the years, flustered indignation leading to panic-struck defences and increasingly ridiculous explanations to avoid the blatant truth. This is how Ron seeks to hide trivial things, like eating the last piece of cake when Harry knows for a fact that he did, as well as his giant and obvious crush on Hermione. It’s endearing and exasperating and great fun to poke at ever now and again, Harry still hoping his friends will finally realise their love is not actually unrequited. He should probably stop hoping. Unsubtle hints and pushes into the right direction haven’t worked in the last five years, it’s unlikely that’s going to change in the next five. Maybe it’s time for something more provocative, something more drastic.
It will make Malfoy even worse and Grimmauld even more protective, but Harry is no doormat and he refuses to be walked over into their perfect little fantasy. Harry lives here, too, and it’s time Malfoy acknowledges that.
“Yes, I want to.” Draco could grow drunk on this, addicted to Potter trusting him with his hope, his vulnerability, making him feel like Draco could share anything with him, like it will be treasured and protected, like
to love, not whoever his parents chose because of their money or their power or because his father lost a bet. (It has been known to happen, Draco isn’t even making this up. Pure-blood marriages are horrific.)
Draco has to adjust to having a cock in his mouth, jaw opened wide and teeth concealed behind lips. There are the hands in his hair—two, now, Draco could crow in delight—and Potter’s yelled ecstasy ringing in his mind. There is Potter’s body bent over him, snapped forward at the unexpected heat engulfing him. There is his smell, musky and cloying and deep, spreading through his mind and quickly the only thing Draco knows.
And then Draco is thrown back, a burst of energy ripping them apart and throwing Draco onto his back, Potter’s eyes shut tight in pain or denial or both or neither. It hurts, his back and his heart and that stupid hope taking root in him again, weathering the winds and storms to bloom at one tiny smile from Potter. Draco is doomed; there is no way this isn’t going to hurt him.
It’s kind of touching, in a terribly selfish way, to see him care so much about Harry’s comfort. Then Draco’s face contorts into anger, and the warm feeling disappears.
“That’s a shame, but I wasn’t really worried about that.” Suddenly her face lights up and she smirks. That can’t be a good sign for Harry. “Right, I’ll go play with the Weasleys, you have fun here, darling.”
Potter looks up at Draco, green eyes wide and honest, smile small like he doesn’t dare show it fully, holding out his hand as if he has a ring to present.
Potter’s undivided focus, all of it centred onto Draco and his green eyes searing deep into his soul—Draco missed him, missed
dealing with any of the things he learnt in this brief conversation. There is no way he could handle more, not without some respite to coordinate his thoughts to his feelings.
, but he knows he can’t. What Harry is offering is perfect, but it’s so far from an equal partnership that Draco shudders to think of how Harry must feel about it.
It’s only the thought of Pansy standing right behind him and that she wouldn’t let Weasley take out his frustrations on him that keeps Draco standing upright. “Pansy is a ferocious animal-rights-activist, you see, and she was appalled at how Potter treats these unfortunate ferrets the two of you dragged in.”
Draco sacrifices one hand holding Potter to poke the bastard between the ribs. Serves him right, snatching Draco’s dreams away on a technicality.
—or is a wedding not special enough for you?” Harry makes his eyes wide, his voice innocent, casts himself the love-drunk fool who didn’t think he was breaking any rules. “Do you truly want to forbid us from celebrating our love?”
There is music, now, quiet enough not to be intrusive but very clearly a call to dance. It’s low and sweeping, growing as Draco starts leading Potter through the room, turning them a bit more than perhaps customary, grinning as Potter laughs and his dress twirls in the air.
to be saved—Draco can only hope that Potter won’t look too closely at the laws of nature, and that he switches the scenery faster than the last few times (or the fall is longer than expected, much longer. Draco would be okay with that, too.)
Granger is shocked by his eager compliance, as well, considering Draco and trying to judge if he gave her wrong directions to mess with her. Draco didn’t, didn’t even think of it until it was too late. But she does throw him the letter, so, whatever Not Negotiating they did here, Draco is alright with it.
hear her and not find anything witty to say in defence of his dignity. There is nothing to say anyway; she is tragically right.
Maybe that’s best, maybe this is Harry’s silence to break. He is the one who created it, after all, even though he seems less affected by what he revealed than Draco feels. This isn't Draco’s place to say something, to impose even more where he doesn’t belong. (One might point out that this is still
Come to think of it, those judges were all old men Hermione deemed overdue for retirement. Harry remembers because Hermione went on a lengthy rant about the patriarchy and its prevalence in today's allegedly equal society. Harry had been nodding along dutifully, knowing from experience that a ranting Hermione (no matter the topic) is better not interrupted for any purpose, not even to ask questions. Parkinson has that very same energy to her, prepared to take on the world and willing to run into the ground anyone who might be foolish enough stand in her way. Harry is begrudgingly impressed
He thinks of dancing with Potter, of his myriad of dresses and whether he might like to wear some now or if they were only part of the movie.
In conclusion, no one was all that excited to hear that Draco would join them in watching a movie today. Where Draco was restless and frantically checking his hair and tugged his selves, their guests had what Draco likes to call ‘the moral righteousness of winners’. Somehow Harry doubts it’s a compliment. It’s part of this big angry rant about social context for grudges (as in, the good guys can do whatever they want and the bad guys will be glared at for sneezing too loudly; Harry summarised and simplified for himself about the third time Draco muttered about it) and the much more familiar ‘bloody smug Gryffindors’.
“Dashing,” Millicent adds, with a wink meant to be lascivious but falls short enough that even Draco notices.
“Do you really need me to save you again?” Draco asks after they have lain in peace for a while. The point seems worth discussing, especially when the alternative is staying here in this armchair, his legs dead under Potter’s weight but not a care in the world. What would he even need his legs for?
They developed an unexpectedly intimate relationship, considering they don’t have a conversation outside of Potter’s flowers, but Draco has taken to buying three cups of tea: one for Potter, one for Mary, and one for himself. Out of the two of them, Mary is far more appreciative of Draco’s attention, laughing as he flatters her and wistfully talking about the grand life they could have, if she were 20 years younger and Draco more interested in women. Draco didn’t anticipate this, but he
“Great, now that we are all up, let’s get up a bit further.” Weasley speaks louder than necessary, blundering into their moment and breaking the tension that build between them. Draco is grateful; this isn’t the place and he is
Whatever the reason, Draco couldn’t stand Harry taking anything more than the gratitude and couch he offered. It’s a concession, a break in the tradition Draco avidly followed, despite how it kept them living in what feels like servants quarters only less personalised. Draco has had enough of that. If he has Harry to catch him where the tradition ends, Draco is willing to risk letting go.
Fine then, Draco is done. Let the trap snap his neck, let it be over. At a certain point, they say, death is a mercy; put it out of its misery. Pansy hates that line of reasoning, has entire speeches prepared to point out just how wrong that is, how it’s not the hunters decision to make and all that, but to Draco the concept never sounded more appealing. Especially not when it’s Harry dealing the fatal blow. Wasn't it always meant to be this way, anyway?
far left and higher but then lower again and suddenly more left after all) and shove his physical superiority into Malfoy’s face.
Which is exactly the problem again, the minor detail that all talk about efficiency and desire can’t get around.
“No, I will almost certainly deny it,” Draco adds, throwing a mock glare at the quill still hanging in the air.
“That is correct, we do. Yesterday was an exception! I was visiting them, and things got late, and I got rather drunk, and instead of stumbling home like that and waking Draco with my clumsiness, I thought it best to sleep it off on their couch.” Harry tries his best to smile under her scrutinising eyes, praying that she didn’t catch the lie.
(it’s fine, in minds especially, magic is much more about intention than words), sending wolves flying left and right. There are more, always more of them, their fur dark and blending them into the night, their eyes shining green and their teeth yellow and wicked. They run towards him, forming out of the darkness and attacking, but Draco pushes them away, growls and snarls and loses himself to something primal, something untamed and wild, something frightening.
It’s a good bluff—scary, too, with the intensity of Granger's glare and the sudden memory of her fist against his jaw—but it’s a bluff all the same. Draco could demand they shave off that horrible rats nest Potter calls hair and they would do it. (It would even do him a favour, rid him of that monstrosity and pave the way towards better taste.)
Back there, Draco didn’t tell him that he wanted to introduce him to Mary. He didn’t tell Potter of their friendship and the tea and he didn’t tell Potter to pick a nicer shirt because no, Draco is not nervous.
They are watching Ghostbusters again and Harry sincerely regrets letting Seamus choose the movie. Not that Ghostbusters is bad! It’s just that Malfoy will hardly be shocked by that, he walked in on them watching it often enough that Harry is fairly sure that, by now, Malfoy knows the entire movie. He must also have reconciled himself with the
“I think it’s only fair that I get to decide on what we do next, given that you got to choose skydiving.” Potter keeps his hand hostage, gripping it hard as Draco realises he ran into a trap.
Potter is tense where Draco hangs over him, like he doesn’t know what is happening, but he also stopped apologising, which is a good thing. The
“Right, total mystery how that happened.” Draco would rather not start questioning his life, he has enough problems as it is.
“I want your hands off me!” Draco struggles in Harry’s grip, barely manages to move at all against Harry’s strength.
be the one crawling back? Harry isn’t the one who failed to live up to the agreements they built their life on. Then again, Granger did admit to not knowing the details of what she is talking about, and it’s better if Draco doesn’t trust her words too far.
More importantly, Harry is still holding his hand after pulling him up. It’s nice, grounding, a steady presence next to Draco. Draco feels like he could do anything with Harry by his side.
“Tell me you didn’t.” Oh how Harry wishes he could. He can’t though, so he stays silent and watches in stoic defiance as Ron’s face slowly goes from amused to horrified. It’s oddly satisfying. “Seriously Harry,
Ron doesn't say anything. Fair enough, Harry doesn’t know what to say either. Well, except the obvious, the wretched, miserable, obvious.
‘CAN PUMPKIN JUICE WARD OFF VAMPIRES?’ No. No, it cannot, and Harry refuses to believe the stupidity of these people.
Carding his fingers through Draco’s hair, his other arm slung around his torso, Harry realises that, maybe, he needed this hug too. Not as much as Draco, sure, but there is something grounding to being close to Draco like this, to holding him tight and losing all his senses to Draco, the smell of him and the sound of his breathing, his hair and his clothes and the feeling of Draco’s hand gripping him right back — it feels like that first hug, when Draco single handedly kept Harry’s world from breaking apart.
That would be all kinds of embarrassing and melodramatic, Draco needs to remember that. There is a pleasant barrier between Draco’s body and his mind right now, a thin, fragile thing that lets Draco float a bit above himself. He would very much like to keep it, his only shield.
Draco understands it now. He wants to share them with Potter, these moments, even when Potter is blind from hurt. Who knows, perhaps a nice sunset would have been exactly what Potter needed to see.
Friend! He’s Draco’s friend, that’s why, and he thought Draco should drink some more, but drinking alone is sad, so he drank, too.
“You know I want you to, don’t you?” Potter asks, lips wrapping around the words and presenting them like a gift, permission and plead wrapped in one. “I want it too, Draco, everything.”
Draco had completely forgotten about the dreaded song, the last push that should get him to kiss Potter.
Mind racing as Draco searches for options—jumping over the man; using his moment of pain and distraction to walk over him, stepping on his head first and viciously to smash it against the roof; fiddle for his wand and … do some magic?—Draco stands petrified, watching in slow dawning horror as the man stands back up, growing impossibly larger in his fury.
Draco has barely enough time to determine that Potter might have supplied him with a monster but not a sword (and that his wand remains curiously missing, thanks Potter) when the beast breaks through the tree line.
Draco watches them, aware that he should relinquish Potter’s hand into the care of his friends, but he can’t bring himself to let go. He watches Weasley wipe away a few tears, watches Potter weakly punch his shoulder and Granger hit him over the head and he doesn’t let go of Potter’s hand because he doesn’t think he would get it back if he were to let go.
couch — you might have known that had you read the contract you signed. I can’t have something as hideous as that associated with my name.” And, because Potter looks like Draco slapped him with a wet fish, he adds: “
“I am, yeah. Are you going to help scheme what I can cook or are you just going to criticise?” Because as lovely as this was (and really, it was mostly just horrifying and Harry wishes he could forget most of what was said) Harry does have to plan a bad meal that will send his husband running for the hills.
will owe you, and we all know you like to hold debts over our heads.” Pansy makes a convincing argument, Draco
They sit like that, enjoying the fire and each other, not speaking as they soak each other in. Draco could sit here forever, stay right in this criminally comfortable armchair with Potter on his lap, drawing circles onto his back and feeling Potter hum against him. This is what heaven feels like.
The creature howls, the sound pure agony, and it falls immediately, legs giving out under it and hands loosening around Potter as it tries to catch itself.
Draco didn’t think his thoughts showed on his face, but either Potter knows him better than he lets on or Draco needs to be more careful, but Potter seems to know exactly what he is thinking, hurrying to reassure.
“No. This one is off limits. Do what you want with the rest of the house, drape it in that hideous Slytherin green if you have to, but not this one.” Harry meets Malfoy’s glare head on. He is not intimidated by his squawking; Harry faced greater opponents over less.
“Yes, isn’t it brilliant?” Right, of course Weasley would enjoy being a lizard, a weak descendant from dragons that can’t even fly anymore because Muggles shot them out off the sky often enough to warrant a fear of it. If you don’t use your wings, they regress and leave you stuck on the ground, a mere memory of old splendour and what could have been.
Draco must be aware of how quick Harry is to regret his offer; before Harry can blink twice he is bombarded with clothes that Draco deems acceptable to wear for a quick food run and is ushered out of the floo with strict instructions to bring home ‘something nice, Potter’.
“First, that isn’t true. I said I was contemplating showing mother what I did with the house, perhaps ask for her opinion on some of the rooms I’d tell her I didn’t get to yet. I never said anything about introducing Harry, and much less about bringing my father along, too. I didn’t give a single thought to the garden, as, apparently, that is what matters to him these days.
“We are back? This is good, isn’t it?” Weasley, of course. Draco is almost relieved to hear his stupid questions.
“You don’t know?” If it weren’t so quiet, no one would have heard Theo. But it is quiet, because no one knows what to say to Draco after his confession, and they all hear Theo’s aghast question.
influence that made this room a proper kitchen. (One might argue that plants do not a kitchen make, but Draco respectfully disagrees.) The plants are everywhere, covering every surface it’s safe for them to be on, thriving and growing high, colours going well together and complementing each other.
(He couldn’t do that for Draco, who deserved to be listened to more than anyone else. Instead, Harry yelled and hurt him, proved himself guilty before he even acknowledged the verdict. Draco deserved so much better than what Harry gave him.)
And then Potter is done, the slumped husk of a man utterly spend. Draco pulls off his cock, slow and careful, gives the head one last suckle to make Potter groan from over-stimulation and then suddenly it’s done, Potter has come and Draco kneels before him, lost.
Draco … Draco doesn’t know what to comment on that, so he doesn’t. Strictly speaking, he isn’t supposed to know most of that anyway and as long as the bets aren’t recorded on anything more permanent than a napkin, intended for only a trusted few and then very quickly the trash, Draco would much prefer not knowing anything.
his hand held by you. Do you understand that?” Draco nods, because Blaise is still right even though Draco likes it even less now.
, he protests the very idea — "It's the only possible option, Harry. You want to keep this house and make it into something Sirius would have liked, which you won't be able to do if you can't even
Weasley looks terrified, opening his mouth ever now and then to interject but Pansy doesn’t even stop to glare at him, forging on with her points and steamrolling over him. It’s beautiful.
Potter doesn’t move at all, leaning heavily against Draco, suppressing his struggles and taking his air, and then he is gone, his hands off of Draco and his tongue out of Draco’s mouth. Draco desperately gulps down air, every heaving gasp bringing him further away from the panic and closer to reason and logic.
“Yes! Yes, Malfoy, curse you!” Hearing Potter’s voice is better than Draco could have imagined, low and raspy, words forced out past the madness they are hurtling towards. The way Potter said his name, gasped out and helpless—Draco couldn’t have stopped from devouring him even if this wasn’t what he waited for.
“I do know, but I also know that you are very good at it when you need to be.” Weasley winks and Draco contemplates whether it’s safe for him to insert himself into the conversation, act offended and wounded that they had to spent the last minutes in tense silence when instead they could have spent them in awkward smalltalk.
As a matter of fact, I did not like the apology, no. It’s truly astonishing how you managed to miss so many of the things customary in an apology and still remained in its technical requirements. As stated before, your apology was noted, which is the most I could have done with it.
Now that he knows what it feels like, the pride of being able to offer Potter peace, not just anger and sly remarks, the satisfaction of learning that Potter must feel
are the one who sabotages all my plans and can’t let a moment go by without being actively hostile!” Malfoy sneers at him and it’s like a switch is being flicked, Harry's mind once again abandoning all reason.
“And there was the wistful sigh! That means I won, Blaise.” Theo rips Draco out of his melancholy, snapping his mind back to the familiar and well-trodden banter between his friends.
None of that, however, means that Malfoy gets to mock Ron for his feelings or the lack of actions following them. Malfoy looks like a bad comic villain —
How does this keep happening? Draco was so sure he had him this time, that Potter would agree to try. He never knew Potter to give up easy.
“Don’t judge my recipe book; it belongs to the house.” Potter gestures at the cabinet where he pulled the book out from, as if that should comfort Draco. (It doesn’t, in case that wasn’t clear. Nothing in this house should be trusted.)
Draco is careful in his approach, hands raised the entire time and projecting his movement clearly, steps slow and soft, everything done under Granger’s sterns supervision. It feels like a small lifetime before Draco stands in front of her, sweating like he run a marathon and no clearer on what he wants to say to Weasley.
. He immediately wishes he had thought ahead and brought Potter a carnivorous plant that could surge forward and eat him alive to save him from this misery. Anything would be better than sitting in the awareness that he ruined his second chance at a genuine,
It doesn’t matter. Harry made certain to know as little as possible about their flirting, relationship — whatever they want to call it — and now he basically knows nothing.
Sometimes I think they failed, all their sacrifices for nothing. I won the war, sure, but I also died. I won too late, after so many people died, at his hands but for my sake.
That might have been exactly what happened, come to think of it. The dangers of sharing one bed, no control over what your mind decides to share when exploiting the fact that common sense and preservation instincts are currently asleep. Harry never talked in his sleep, but it’s entirely feasible that he dreamed of hearing Hermione's disappointment again, scolding him over the latest escalation and yet again telling him he needs a better relationship to Malfoy if he wants this to work. Which is of course what Hermione never properly understood: Harry knows how to share the house with people who would just as soon see him dead, Malfoy is nothing against the Dursleys. Still, perhaps his sleepy brain manufactured a scenario where he listened to Hermione (and why shouldn’t he, listening to Hermione always served him well) and it led to, well, whatever you want to call
If Draco hadn’t already realised this is a bad case of miscommunication and resolved to forgive him, this would have swayed him.
fine and Harry has no idea what to do, only that he wants to take it back, wants a Time-Turner to knock some sense into the idiot who was so annoyed at having to carrying some furniture that he completely forgot all boundaries.
“I will say this once, and only once, Malfoy; you hurt Harry. We don't know what you did or why, but you hurt him badly. He is willing to overlook that and take you back with no regard to himself, which is stupid and generous, and you better be sure before you answer him. He deserves better than being the punching bag for your games. When he inevitably asks you if there is any chance that you can move on and ignore what happened, you will apologise. Regardless of your answer, you will apologise for hurting him. And if you decide something and then later on change your mind for some inane reason, I will make certain that you can never answer a question again. Is that clear?”
it, doesn’t have the slightest idea what Potter is thinking, but should something drastically change Draco will notice. Which is all he has in terms of comfort at the moment.
There is someone here, close and humming and coming closer as the humming grows louder. Harry hears it too, protestations about his temporary muteness dying before he fully expressed them, his attention focused on listening.
Malfoy gasps, which is either genuine or a genuine love for dramatics, but appreciated either way. He allows Harry to take his hand, meets his eyes for the soulful and important gazing moment and actually looks as overwhelmed with the entire affair as if it were a real wedding.
. You know shit all, Malfoy. All that Slytherin pride about being subtle and picking up on secrets and it’s all lies, isn’t it? You couldn’t take the hint, no matter how often I dropped it.” Potter sneers at him and Draco doesn’t understand the world anymore. None of this makes sense! It hurts,
(From the looks of things, it has been very real for Draco for a long time, but Harry isn’t ready to face
Draco watches in terror as Potter moves one heap after the other onto a plate that convention implies is meant for Draco. He then numbly takes the plate and doesn't give in to the temptation of dropping it, because that would be rude and his mother raised him better than that.
Whatever Harry meant in linking Draco and Dudley together like he did, he didn’t mean it as explanation on why Draco should let him go.
One would think sleep comes easy to him, after living on barely a few hours of it for the last two weeks because Draco insisted on filling him up with coffee and going over
on his knees for him, his eyes trained on Draco and yet blind to a view Draco has been assured is fantastic. If Draco had even the slightest suspicion that Potter has any clue what he is doing, it would be insulting. Since Draco is almost certain this is the first time Potter so much as
“I still won’t give you an interview, Malfoy.” Potter sprawls in his chair like it’s a throne, uncomfortable by nature and indignant with the flagrant disrespect in Potter’s posture.
At first glance, the hidden corner is much like the main part of Draco's room. There are more books, of course, though you wouldn’t know these are the ones closest to Draco’s heart, dearer even than the ones neatly lined up in the bookshelves of his room and especially than those in the library. There are pictures and souvenirs and
Of course, his ideas were fraught with oversights and failures to think things through, but that is hardly the point. No one can think of it all, and Potter eventually would have realised that creating a good place for everyone must, above all, mean, that everyone—which means
him. So much hatred—Draco hasn't felt so reviled since he stood his trial, tiny among the sneers of the Wizengamot, his sins weighing him down, stripping him of all else.
“Well, you still refuse to kiss me, so no,” Potter says, but he is smiling, almost. It’s more of a pout, mollified out of his anger and left floundering between that and wherever they were before. Draco is so relieved to see it that he laughs, feeling like a weight was lifted off his heart and now it’s soaring high, singing silly songs and rejoicing in the glory of life.
Technically, they could ask anyone. They could even hand Weasley a beginners book on Legilimency and see how he fares, keep things in the family, but not even the pride of the victors is enough to disillusion them like that. Draco is the best Legilimens there is and Potter’s mind is a carton of eggs. If they allow the wrong person to poke around in there, they might as well start to pick out flowers for the funeral.
He is well and truly past that, of course, content to be sort of friends with Potter due to the bewildering merging their respective circles of friends have undergone, but that doesn’t mean Draco is keen on tempting the beast. Marrying Potter, living out what his younger self lay awake dreaming of, well, that might well be the textbook definition of challenging the universe.
“You would be, too, if you hadn’t eaten all day because you can’t open the pantry or any of the cabinets in your kitchen.” Harry’s stomach grumbles again, a wonderfully dramatic emphasis on his looming starvation.
behaviour. It implies an intimacy that might or might not be exaggerated, one that Draco is very fond of.)
last night) had a heart-to-heart the likes of which Hermione had been urging him to initiate since he signed the papers. Apparently pretty much every book recommends that you ‘foster intimacy’ with your spouse as soon as possible to make the marriage agreeable to both parties, something ‘immensely facilitated after building an environment where everyone feels safe and comfortable expressing their needs and desires’. Harry heard the lecture often enough that he could recite it his sleep.
Draco doesn’t spare the room more than a furtive glance, stumbling out of the floo and pulling Harry along, heading for the couch (the ugly one Harry refused to get rid of; Draco grew oddly fond of it — he is pretty sure it’s Stockholm-syndrome). Tea with his mother went in a million directions and not a single one of them as Draco expected; he is quite done dealing with the world today.
“I’m judging the entire house, Potter. It all needs a major overhaul.” It does, Draco said it before and he’ll say it again: the best thing they can do to this humble hovel is to tear it down and build something new on the smoldering ruins.
she have to take his name?” Draco glares at Theo. He always delights in a good debate and consequently does his best to stoke the fires, but Draco has no intention of becoming the centre of attention again. How is no one talking about Pansy’s doomed-to-fail love affair yet?
knows Draco can barely name all the figures of chess. The exact workings of his deceptions escape him, but Draco somehow convinced a not insubstantial part of Hogwarts that he was, in fact, the best chess player there is. He never played a match, of course, that would have given away the ruse, but he must have started enough rumours of fantastical victories that people were inclined to believe them.
“You aren’t supposed to touch Capt'n,” Draco says, because it’s true and just because Harry seems to be the exception to every rule Draco ever had, doesn’t mean he shouldn't know. Draco would have allowed Harry to hold her eventually — did in fact already promise him the privilege as part of his apology, though the very real physical implications of that promise didn’t hit before Draco saw Harry
“Do I look like I care about your precious beauty sleep? You can sleep as long as you want, an entire month for all I care, but that doesn’t give you the right to ignore all personal boundaries.” Draco is still screaming, the grace his rage usually holds nowhere to be seen, and nothing left in him but indignant panic.
. Well, Draco found the monster, certainly, kind of hard to miss with all the ruckus it’s making. The damsel is also easy, that’s Potter—oh! Draco wasn’t using the
“Splendid. See you in front of the altar, Potter.” And then he is gone in a whirl of green fire. (Harry notes that he didn’t even need to name his destination, let alone use the powder — he didn’t think Grimmauld would have let him go that easily.)
. They both know what is wrong in this relationship, and Draco is determined to end that, here and today. He is committed, for better or worse, no matter the price.
Harry nods, not up to talking, as Ron guessed, and takes a sip of his tea. It’s hot enough to burn his entire mouth, fire spreading down his throat and leaving a burning trail. Harry relishes in the feeling and takes another sip.
He loves the thrill, though, loves how forbidden it feels, the certainty that they would cause a scandal were anyone to know. Draco loves the symbolism, if not the act. He focuses on Potter’s hands, on the exhausted panting and broken moans leaving his mouth. He takes everything Potter gives him, finds pride in it even as he tries not to linger on the taste he swallows.
“Because, Malfoy, for special occasions we are allowed to see our friends in this covid induced nightmare of isolation and social distancing. A wedding is the specialest of occasions, wouldn’t you say?” Potter winks at him, all charming wit.
Considering how Potter is glaring daggers at him, that might have been his plan all along, the revolting piece of furniture bought only for that exact reason. Draco could almost respect that — what kind of Slytherin would he be if he didn’t appreciate a good scheme when he sees one? But he doubts Potter would think of the required subterfuge, let alone approve of it. No, if Potter wanted him blind he would do the honourable thing and do the deed himself.
Harry’s face is set, grim and stern, pinning Draco down as real as his hands digging into his arms. Draco can only guess at what he is thinking (did Draco accelerate the realisation that he is an undesirable partner, and Harry is, right now, deciding to leave?), but it’s not good news, that much is undeniable. Harry is upset, and it’s Draco’s fault.
, Potter, it could have been some weird corm. You should cut it if you want to avoid that happening again.” Draco doesn't
“You don’t get to judge me, Malfoy,” Potter says, every word pressed out through gritted teeth, ground into a dangerous growl.
Maybe he should, because Ron seems to have completely missed the problem here. If that is what playing by Ron’s boring rules brings him, Harry doesn’t want to do it anymore.
“I told you that would happen, yes.” Granted, Draco didn’t think it would be this bad—or this soon—but he did tell Potter it would happen. They can’t allow Potter to disappear, just can’t.
Ron nods at him, all the endorsement he is going to give. That’s fine, Harry doesn’t need more, he just needs to know that Ron will listen as he confesses his sins.
with it?” Potter’s laugh is a marvellous thing, enough to sooth old wounds, wounds that sting more when prodded than Draco expected. He isn’t as far away from that boy as he hoped to be, not as
Ever efficient, Grimmauld neatly pulls the rug out of under Draco’s disobedient husband. Harry stumbles, grasping for balance at nothing, and then he falls, landing heavily on Draco. Not ideal, not ideal at all, but at least Harry is warm and here and, really, who needs to breathe, anyway?
He wants Potter, yes (denial seems pointless, at this point) but not like that, not as a transaction and not in some weird scenario born of Potter’s comatose mind. Informed consent is practically impossible under these circumstances.
who had woken him that night. Still, that had turned out far more pleasant than this night promises to go, even if he was too busy freaking out to enjoy the development the last time. That is the one thing that hasn’t changed: Malfoy’s propensity to indecently alluring pyjamas. This time Harry isn’t too self-conscious to admit that he would like to slowly strip him of them, or maybe open them just far enough and enjoy the picture of debauchment.
It’s an unsettling thought, the idea that Potter might be breathing his last breaths while Draco stands here, outside of his mind and useless in any fights that Potter might be fighting. Draco is tempted to make some dig against Weasley (he knows what he would say, too: he would—very innocently—assume that they are all familiar with the complex and highly theoretical process and the incantations needed, make Weasley look like a fool when he has to admit that he is the only one who doesn’t know, who needs to be told) just to get his footing back. But Granger already warned him once and they had this weird and intimate moment of understanding—Draco can’t abuse him like that after they agreed to focus on Potter.
The dwarfs are getting restless, mumbling about dinner and whether it will be ready soon. Draco—who grew up on the firm belief that, if it’s you waiting on the cook instead of the other way around, you have lost control of your life and should consider discreetly packing your money and disappearing—turns his nose at them and leaves them to their musings. Potter is here, he knows he is, Draco just has to find him.
“But I so enjoyed looking at you, are you sure you can’t be persuaded to put this dance to a hold?” Draco leans close, brushing the words directly into Potter’s ear as he whispers: “I would like more time to express my appreciation.”
, things never seem to be easy for them, but they might have stood a chance. Draco would have needed to tell Harry then, when they were calmer and more awake. They still would have fought — it’s too big a break in what Harry thought to not fight over — but fights don’t necessarily have to be bad. They could have had a
a life is because he trusted other people to have his back and take care of themselves. He assumed that trust would stretch into every aspect in his life. He didn’t foresee the marriage, but it doesn’t change the ethos.
“This is a lovely shop you have here, Potter,” Draco says instead and watches the way Potter blushes at the compliment.
“I don’t think I will, Malfoy. Sleep well.” Harry smirks at him, his wish ominously accompanied by another rustle of the bedsheets being moved. He leaves Malfoy there, pats him on the head because Malfoy’s hair looks soft and rumpled and the late hour makes Harry stupid, and leaves.
He experiments with that, with teeth and tongue and how to combine the two, creating a sting before soothing it, pressing Potter tighter against his teeth and playing with the pressure. Anything that makes Potter shout he repeats, again and again, his hand around Potter’s cock never wavering as he holds him there, standing by Draco’s mercy. Potter’s hands cling to his hair, holding on as Draco pushes him to oblivion.
The world kind of stops around them. Or perhaps it’s Potter who stops, who freezes as he catches Draco already watching, who realises that Draco leans closer than necessary, his head almost resting on Potter’s shoulder. Their faces are so close their noses might almost be touching and Potter freezes, words trailing off as he stares at Draco, eyes wide where they meet Draco’s.
the man, Potter can’t do anything much worse than that. (What is he going to do, insist they have a honeymoon after all?)
Harry's words hang awkwardly in the air, trailed off where he didn’t draw his conclusion. Honestly, he expected Draco to interrupt him, he doesn't know where he is going with this rant. He is also very busy
?” Draco is sympathetic for his friend, he really is, but it still needs pointing out when despair drives him into stupidity.
Draco made a big mistake, waking things that should be left sleeping and forgotten, but Harry doesn’t care about Draco anymore, not right now.
Draco joins them, because what else is there to do? The tune is easy enough, and soon Draco finds himself almost enjoying this weird world Potter conjured up. (Though it would be better with Potter here, smiling and whistling without a care in the world, like he never knew hardship and fear.)
They both gasp at the contact, Potter’s hip bucking up violently and Draco holding him down as much as possible with only one hand, overwhelmed by the relief of finally touching, the burning hot lust cursing through him, the sudden awareness of his own painfully hard cock, the dizzying sparks of Potter pulling his hair—it’s
“I thought for sure you would demand I should hurry up when you did that frowny thing—” another hiccup, breaking the sentence before Potter moves on like it never happened, “—but you forced yourself to smile and stand still and it looked so painful!”
And as if all that wasn’t enough, Harry has to actually get up and leave the house to experience it. That is the greatest indignity of them all, making Harry do all the work for a mediocre evening. They should have just stuck to Grimmauld, everyone had agreed that is by far the best option, hatefully poking cushions aside.
Potter remains still for a moment, gazing seriously at Draco just long enough to say: “Never doubt me”, and then he throws his head back, laughing as he opens himself to welcome the heavy rain.
Even in the — much more likely — case that they don't spontaneously run away together into the rising sun, having Draco breathing and real in front of him would have its advantages. For one, Draco is wonderfully expressive. He doesn't know it, would die of mortification if he knew, but Harry can read him as well as he can read Ron. Better, sometimes, Harry feels.
That’s the crux of the thing. Draco can’t judge if Harry is seconds away from laughing at him, if he is the kind to cast off all ties to childhood the moment he turned 17 and will belittle Draco for treating his own ties differently.
is why they are his friends, because they are loyal and supportive and bring food and books when he needs them (even if it's all a set-up so they can tell him he's a moron and that it's high time he accepts his fate).
“Those papers look alright to me, Harry,” Ron informs them, rather more dismayed than Harry thought he would be at what constitutes as Good News these days. But then,
Because it’s that easy; figures, that Potter would think that. There is no archetype for marriages, hardly any firm roles you have to keep to. Smile to make sure everyone knows how happy you are, make sure you don’t lose any of your fortune and produce an heir so the bloodline — oh, consummation.
Heroically standing in starting position, Harry places one hand on the back of the couch Draco is dying on, doesn’t make sure his grip is secure because there is no time, and jumps, propelling himself onto the other end of the couch. No flip, but Harry thinks it rather impressive, regardless.
Potter does it again, hiccup smaller this time, and he resolves into near manic giggles, all the lovely build up meant for Draco poured into his laughter as Potter rolls off him.
There are less people the higher he gets, only guards remaining until even those disappear, Draco winding his way up a staircase, higher and higher, towards Potter.
"Too bad I'm here then, when you so hate me. Even worse for you, you addressed me by name and I heard your proposal, which means it's valid in eyes of the law." A quick glance at Hermione confirms that yes, the bastard is right. "If you could loath me in silence, I have a
Stupid, because Potter this close is a dangerous thing. It’s near lethal for Draco’s quick wit and charming personality, for one, and sure to expose Draco’s weakness for this man. Draco must look a right fool, desperate for Potter’s company and to earn his smiles, reaching out endlessly and now progressed to physically pulling Potter close. Desperation is not a good look on anyone, but Draco likes to think he wears it with dignity, at least.
Draco wants him as close as possible. Not only does it bode well for his… seduction? Rescue mission? Whatever you want to call it, it will be a lot easier if Harry is amenable to finally
Ron — the brilliant, compassionate, far too forgiving friend that he is — nods in acknowledgement of all the that Harry didn’t say, smiles in a silent reassurance that he understands, that it’s alright, and answers the question.
It’s that last one that jolts Draco, makes him move limbs that don’t want to be moved, and groan their protest.
So when suddenly there is a marriage to be consummated with a man Pansy assures him Draco has been interested in forever, well, it seems like Draco is dragged past the newly flimsy barrier of glass. Draco wants both, for it to be a solid wall shielding him and to not be there at all, to be finally embraced and accepted. Maybe Potter is the right person Blaise had been hinting at? Draco hopes he is.
“Harry!” Weasley yells, loud enough that even a deaf wolf would know of their presence. He runs forward, past Draco and into the noises coming from the dark.
). If his friends weren't just waiting for Draco to back out and tease him about it, he would have been gone before he set two feet into the room. Instead, Draco sits at the table, glares at the rose petal swimming in his champagne (an accident? Surely, it cannot be a sign of affection, not something this impractical and aesthetically unappealing) and waits for Potter to dish out what he prepared.
Harry often wondered where Hermione would draw the line in this whole house-and-marriage thing. Never would he have guessed that it’s bodily harm.
is, they have been pathetically pining after each other without either of them gathering enough of that famous Gryffindor courage to speak up about it. And now Pansy is pining after them, too, only slightly less pathetic because it hasn't been as long yet.”
Specifically, Draco has always had a passion for the violin. His father hated it, insisting on him learning the piano first, but Draco’s passion was always reserved for this, for the elegant curves and the sturdy strings under his fingers, the notes high and clear and thrumming in the body of dark wood, resting on his shoulder and moving with him, through him, much closer than the damned piano his father insisted on. Draco loved the violin, would have learnt anything his father deemed prudent, as long as he got to keep that feeling.
Draco doesn’t want to know what Harry has to say, because he knows he won't like it. Harry might be right in what he is saying, but Draco can’t bear hearing it, listening and analysing and deciding what to do with it. It’s not fair, and it’s not what Harry deserves, but Draco deliberately ignores him in favour of crawling under tables and chairs to find the ferret.
at Draco, which, in turn, leaves Draco blushing and speechless, and then he is out of the door, leaving Draco no choice but to follow.
There are the huge goggles strapped around his head, a thousand cogs and gears whirring around the lenses, presumably to make extremely important adjustments to the fine tuning, magnifying Potter’s eyes and rimming them in a gold that does wonders for his brown complexion and pronounces the little specks of gold in the chilling green of his eyes. Draco has always been weak for those eyes, memorised every tiny detail and analysed the emotions passing through them, lost himself trying to learn their mysteries — this is excessive and unfair, how is Draco supposed to concentrate like this? Did he look this good yesterday? The first time Draco was here?
Enough weight to feel smug and proud for a moment, knowing that Pansy will pretend to hate him for it when she hears. It’s the same with his mother, who Draco would never admit to
his instruments, unaware that he sounds like a tosser and unconcerned with Draco’s presence, tea and flowers deposited on the counter for him.
“I hear you started cooking for a man you don’t at all want to impress?” Ginny doesn’t even pretend to watch the movie, turned towards Harry and studying him intently. Why hadn’t Harry learnt from his past mistakes and started avoiding her yet?
He fought his destiny and reputation, trying hard to blend in and escape the burden and pain that comes with being chosen.
ship, where she would be the captain and travel by the stars. A brilliant idea, of course, I immediately committed to the name. However, I was rather small and struggled with proper enunciation. I … I had the unfortunate tendency to smudge my words together, so I had to undertake some name changes.” It took Draco quite some time to admit that he would need more care and precision to live up to Captain than he was willing to spare, stubborn pride making him want to just say it right without investing any of the time necessary for complete mastery of it, and that it would be much more reasonable to make concessions on the name and spend his time playing with Capt'n instead of brooding over naming her.
is the one in the dress and that it doesn’t suit him half as well as Potter—and then the hulk is back, roaring up from his position hunched over and snarling, blood red eyes boring into Draco, not looking away as he pulls the sword out of his back.
Harry likes to think they made their choice independently, and because they realised they can live just fine together, even after all that has happened and needs to happen still — but that would be delusional. They
“Now, Pansy, that’s just rude,” Draco sniffs, taking up his drink again in lieu of an actual answer.
“Problem, Malfoy?” Potter purrs, looking between the high pile of bowls and the severely diminished space in the dishwasher.
First, Draco is a wanker for not only bringing it up, but the way he brought it up, too. Fair enough, Draco knew that before he opened his mouth. Draco didn't know how very much he would wish to take the words back, no, but he did know he shouldn’t say them.
, that’s quite enough.” They are getting more insulting and less entertaining with every word. If they are not going to take this seriously, Draco doesn’t want to know what kind of hero he'd make. The one that grows old and grey because he is smart enough to stay out of trouble, probably. Which is a
she tried to kill me after I refused to write you any more letters!” Potter, against all expectations, is quickly losing his composure. He stands up from his table—finally fully instead of straining against it in his excitement of arguing with Draco—and gestures widely, starting a new list that he counts on his other hand and lets fall immediately.
Potter laughs into his kiss but he does as Draco asked, one of his hands landing on Draco’s cock without hesitation.
The only surprising part about this is that now, apparently, that person he imagines sharing his life with is
they don’t end up stabbing themselves, don’t blind themselves, and don’t bleed all over your floor.” Draco points at the top of the knives safely contained and Potter snorts, sneering at Draco’s explanation. Draco shrugs; if Potter wants to murder someone ineptly in his kitchen, he’ll have to call someone else to come and help with clean up.
Malfoy, Harry has the distinct impression, has been up for a while. There is a jittery flutter to his movements, something hectic that hints at too much caffeine to keep his falling eyes open. Harry wonders what god-forsaken reason Malfoy had to pull them both out of bed so early (actually, he doesn’t care about Malfoy’s sleeping habits too much, but Harry draws the line at Malfoy messing with his own sporadic sleep) but then he realises he can move his legs again and he pats over to the fridge, eager to soften the bitter coffee Malfoy thought an appropriate apology for having him thrown on the hard floor.
He should probably feel worse about that, now that he’s remembered Harry is soon going to announce that he is leaving, that he can’t stay in a relationship so unfulfilling. Draco
“That’s precisely the problem, Pansy dear. Your fun rarely ends well for me.” A slight exaggeration, perhaps, but it’s true enough in principle.
Draco looks like a deer caught in headlights (this is one of the few time the phrase actually applies, the startled grace from a creature that seconds ago thought itself alone and unwatched, the unmitigated terror at the
It’s somewhat shocking, that Harry would have taken this long to realise Malfoy is keeping what seems like a rather important secret from him. Not that Malfoy didn’t offer him his soul in gift wrapping and with a bow on top, it’s not like they really
