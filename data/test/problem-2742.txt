Nobody else raises so much as an eyelash.
Harry read, passed it to Arys, and nodded and mouthed ‘Thank you’ to Malfoy multiple times.
He’s plastered on his “Minister for Magic” mask, now, and he brings it around the table; a few seconds for each member of “Cupboard”. Hysteria Greengrass raises an eyebrow.
Despite that they just had, right.
Harry spun and grinned. Not at all Gilderoy-like.
“Ron. Ron. Oi, Ron, shut up.” Harry took his glass from Ron and cast another wandless Quack-Attack. “Ronald!”
“”Course, dear. I just came to say I didn’t tell the Aurors any specific length of time so let’s go with seven months. Can you do that? Is that too long?” Harry chewed.
Harry rolled his eyes as he shook his head. ‘Don’t even,’ he replied. Arys tacked her index finger on the spine of the play to attract the others’ attention.
“This is amazing, Hermione, congratulations.” He whispered into her hair.
Ron opened his mouth to say something, but he quacked.
The first thing you have to do --”
“Your hair isn’t orange and your face is back on. Not an improvement. I preferred  the orange, myself.” Harry retorted.
“I, well, I was asleep. I woke up to the ward going off. It took me a while to inspect it and figure out what was going on. Then I heard sirens and saw the body from my window.”
“Just the question I was going to ask you, Harold James.”
Harry grunted, “Morning.”
“Yes, just doing our jobs.” Rosier gleamed unpleasantly.
“She is here, so Kreacher will be departing now."
“Ask Memene. You’re dashing.” Arys grinned.
As convincing as her act was, Harry knew she had some alternative reason for wanting a Ministry Guard around the square. He supposed he could go along with it, for now.
“Malfoy, shut the fuck up, please. Sorry. That’s probably not the best way to go about beginning to ask you for a favour.” Harys amends.
"Must we review Tea etiquette once more? I don’t want you being churlish with the President’s daughters. They’re very nice girls. Buck up.”
“Sorry. Arys, I’m really sorry.”
Harry made a raspberry.
Changed into simple jeans and a white t-shirt, Harry burst into the parlour.
“Right, so, we’ll be back when things are sorted. Anyone else care to join? Right, I figured not. Have a splendid day, all,” he pulls a last face at the remaining and seated.
Ron opened his mouth in realisation. "Harry! You've shagged all of Gryffindor's famous Quidditch captains!"
“Wonderful, fawn.
“Oh. I was under the impression something terrible was ALREADY happening. My mistake.”
Harry bit the insides of his cheeks and nodded. Arys handed him a new note back.
The girls kissed his palms. The elder stroked the sleeves of his robes. Sage green, Memene rarely failed.
He hangs from a battered Nimbus 2000 by his knees. His face, or Arys’ in the flames, is most certainly upside down.
He mucked about with all of the guests in the foyer, introducing himself and going through the “Close Friend’s Charity Gala pleasantries” -- Arys had a list of ‘pleasantries’ for every type of event they encountered -- until finally an hour later he was able to escape his “Harry Potter: Celebrity” duties and find Ron in the ballroom.
“I didn’t say leave!” Harry calls. “It’s Friday! I’m all alone. I’m so lonely!” He play-whinges. really whinges.
“Spinach?” He managed. She was so preoccupied looking behind her she didn’t hear him.
“Officially Auror business now, Mr Potter. Any details you think your celebrity status earns you no longer apply.”
The pointy pens, pencils, et. al., clatter to the table. Perfidy’s eyes are glued to it.
“Well, yeah, of course. What else was I going to do?”
He looked up, agitated, more and more agitation this night, and was about to tell her off SILENTLY, when he realised she was looking not at him but at someone behind him.
She toyed with a loose strand of hair, chewing the insides of her mouth.
“Yeah, sorry about that. If I’d known, I wouldn’t have allowed it. The thing is a vulture, I swear.”
“Not at the moment, Mr Potter. Again, we’re both very sorry that this has happened so close to your home, and very thankful that you were there to get us on it immediately.”
“Shall I make more tea?”
“Give.”
“Ron, there you are! Christ, it’s --” Harry stopped himself when Ron and his companion turned. Reliable as ever, Ron was doing some upchatting of his own, and to the Minister no less.
“Arys, are there any more “Close Friend’s Gala pleasantries” I’ve got to perform?” Harry balled his fists into his closed eyes and pressed.
“The fuck was that for, arsehole?” Ron yelled over the orchestra. "You made me look a tit! That was the bloody Minister!"
“Let me in, let me in, by the hair on my chinny chin chin," Harry sang. Malfoy gaped.
Harry’s in his bedroom in a very compromising position.
“None. They should be here soon, I’d presume. Let’s please get you dressed into something orderly.”
“Arys. I need some air. Outside.” He excused away the wizard.
“Arys, I’m there with you. I know. I care for you the same. Well, not the same probably, but, you know. I do care.” Harry glared at her daggers, but was sincere in his words. She knew, and smiled melancholic.
“Superb.” Arys said, in Harry’s chair. Harry (Harys) handed Arys (Arry) his glasses. Arry put them on, pouting, and picking at her foreign skin. She moaned.
“So, you’re not going to tell me anything? About a murder, that I alerted you to, that just happened outside my bloody --”
His publicist sent a hundred dis-armed fists to rap on the door.
they chugged more champagne from the next tray that passed.
Other than the red and gold.
“Timey-wimey?” Malfoy hissed.
14 April, 2002
“Believe me, mate, the better you are for it!” Harry yelled back.
“Likely you, mate.
Fourth, he was already an idiot for what he was considering, but he really had no other options at this juncture.
“Yeah, you’re welcome, for saving your arse all those bloody times I did, and saying nice things about you to the Wizengamot, and to the Prophet, and, oh, right, for not punching your stupid pointy nose back into your stupid pointy face every time I see you.” Harys muttered.
“Something terrible did already happen! Someone was murdered outside my fucking house, Malfoy! And then I... I did some stupid shit, that I don’t need to go into detail with you about, and I made something up that I can’t possibly do on my own. And you’re the last person the Aurors would think I’d go to for help and the best person available to do the favour. Probably the only one.” Harys almost begged.
A bang returns Harry to the table.
Harry’s stomach grumbled as she mentioned it.
They had Tea in the Ministry’s fancy tearoom. They were served chocolate jam and Belgian waffles. Harry’s stomach was not at all complaining.
I’ll be at yours, 1400, sharp.
The owl was an owl in species only: every other single characteristic she possessed was more vulture, to Harry. She was black with gigantic, swooping wings, -- hovering the way Snape’s black cloaks used to -- coral talons and cherry red eyes. Harry swore Arys’ had Charmed them that way, but he couldn’t prove it and she’d never admit to it. And then, she went and named the thing, “Lucy”.
“Mr Potter.” Whittery interrupted, peaceably. “First, let us thank you for your alerting us to this, devastating thing. It was the right thing to do.” He placated. “However, as the matter is now under Auror investigation we can’t give out any more details than strictly necessary. I’m sure you’re very unsettled right now, and all of this is of course extremely stressful. If it’s your safety you’re concerned about, we’ll happily arrange for a Guard to watch over the square until we’ve... well, solved this.”
“I,” Harys closed his eyes as he reveled in his own humiliation, “I told the Aurors’ I knew that the murder was magic because I had a ward up that could detect Dark magic in a hundred metre radius from Grimmauld. I told them I invented it.” He flushed. At least he wasn’t wearing his own face. “The Spell-Masters are to come late this morning and inspect said make-believe ward, and I need it to not be so make-believe by then. Can you help me?” He opened his eyes and tried to appear as miserable and helpless as he could, with Arys face and all not withstanding.
“Fuck."
“Brat,” Harry mutters to himself as he lifts his head from the carpet. “You can’t be a brat at twenty-three,” he tells the still-hanging Nimbus 2000.
“I’m so fond of you as well! So much love!” He yells from the floor to Arys’ retreating curls.
Whittery assured. “And again, if you’d sleep sounder with a Guard outside, just say the word and we’ll have them here in a jiff.”
“Am I to stuff these in your cupboards?” Arys said.
“Lucy.”
"Tis I, the Frenchiest fry," Arys said. sober and chipper and bright.
Harry was almost too afraid of Arys’ retaliation to leave the house. But she was a Slytherin, and she was predictable in that way, so he knew she would wait good and hard for the opportune moment. He wasn’t worried, they had been through these sorts of games before. They were rather fun, after all.
Arys passed him another parchment.
“I guess when I’ve still got people trying to off me, or trying to creep through the windows, or chasing me home for a surprise snog, I’ve had to find new ways of protecting myself. And my friends.” Harry defended. He was heating up again, and Arys began her patting.
“Fine, fine. Give me ten minutes.”
She laughed and dragged Harry to the far side where he had spotted Hannah.
“Yeah, I was just saving you from the embarassment.”
“Great, Mr Potter. I’m happy to hear it. We’ll see who we can spare and send them over as soon as we get everything in order.” Whittery reassured, Arys and Harry.
“What?! But!” Harys’ stammered. Had anyone ever refused him help before? Surely not recently, he thought. He was really getting carried away with this celebrity lifestyle, wasn’t he?
“Great, thanks.” Harry removed his fists. His headache was worsening. Too much champagne. Poor fawn, Arys said with her big mean eyes.
either huddled and spring sprung new friendships
Harry felt Arys come through the wards, 1400 sharp.
Amongst the scuttle of hands Harry spots one boldly giving the Minister the finger.
“No, Arys. I’ll be fine. Is there anything on for tomorrow?”
“You could’ve just Flooed, you know.”
“Lovely, fawn.” She gave him a face that was anything but.
fighting pic Gala goes gaga after Malfoy misbehaviour
He escorted the two Aurors down to the kitchen where Arys had done a dab hand at cleaning up the mess Harry had left. She even managed to spell her bathrobe and into a suit and heels. The pool of goo was gone from the floor, and Harry pulled out chairs for the three of his ‘guests’.
"YOUR WIFE?!" he yelps.
“A bloody girl standing behind you in your pocket mirror, say?” Harry mimed an innocent face.
After the Unbreakable was sworn -- during which Malfoy grumbled endlessly about necessary and uneceassary precautions and fools not being suffered gladly, and so on -- it was past dawn. All and all, things had only taken about three hours. Arys left from the Dark Room, Malfoy left from the Dark Room, complaining but immensely self-satisfied with the work he’d done, and Harry went back up to the attic to try and sleep some.
Harry found Rosier and another Auror at his door, (Whimbly? Whimbers?).
Next she would try to manouver his fringe into a side-part. “Can’t you just,” and give up after a three minutes. “Nevermind. Late!”
“Well, you told-rabled me so! To you, the smartest wizard of our age!"
“AND NO GODDAMN DUCK, DAMMIT!” Malcker barks from the hallway. “Quietus,” he finishes.
“You look absolutely Hellish.” Arys chimed pleasantly.
Harry crumples to the floor in defeat.
Harry was perfectly polite in return. And charming.
Arys Stung Hexed his back, and then slapped the spot heartily.
“I didn't choose them. What is that goo?” Harry asked warily as she combed his fringe to the side, as she had attempted last night.
“Yes, all right, Weasley. Calm yourself. You two’ve been married since the second year in my mind; I do not care. However, the entire Wizarding World is going to know, and care, in about five seconds if you don’t stop thundering on about it. Unhand me Potter, and we’ll forget this unfortunate misunderstanding ever happened.” Malfoy says.
“Malfoy, just shut up. Right now. I never thought I’d say this, and believe me, I never wanted to, but, you owe me. You know you do and well, I’m cashing in. That desperate. Please.” Harys paused for a breath, “And I need it tonight. Like, now. Before tomorrow morning. And you have to use my wand. I think. Most likely.” Harys grimaced. He knew how Malfoy would despise everything he said but Malfoy did owe him and he wasn’t too noble any longer to cash in on those debts if needs must.
1400     Grimmauld Place, London
Harry Turns, and gives a bended elbow to the Minister. “As one?”
"Too far!"
“Don’t they all die at the end?” Harry asks.
“Harry Potter! It is a true pleasure.” Msr Tepouge disregarded his proffered hand and kissed his cheeks, one, and the other. Mr Renninger laughed at Harry’s mild expression and clasped his limp hands jovially.
“Tis I, the Frenchiest fry,” Arys turned around, her arms crossed against her chest.
“Me.” Arys commanded, and they Apparated to the Ministry, only three minutes behind schedule.
“Of course, Mr Potter. It is, in your circumstances, probably very necessary. Please, do believe me when I tell you we aren’t casting any aspersions on you, or anyone associated with you. We just need to follow procedure, be as thorough as possible. You know that. Of course you do, with Weasley as your mate.” Whittery assured again. He had a voice that was just the right volume, and just the right pitch, to put everyone around him at ease. Harry wondered if it was a charm of some sort. A ‘legal’ charm. He snickered behind his tea mug.
There’s a thick silence.
“Malfoy, you’re not gon'o use that thing on either us. You know inclimidation doesn’t work on me an’longer, but as’lways good efforts NOT.” Harry pauses to Invisible-Incarcero Malfoy, “Ron, but we all replied for August? I though the wedding was -- what happened! ARE BOTH OF YOU OKAY?!”
Lucy continued devouring the rinds, ignoring Harry entirely.
What this meant, Harry knew, but nice to have confirmed by Arys all the same, was that the Aurors, or at least Rosier, positively suspected him of some sort of lying or treachery in this affair. Of course they did. That was the whole point of the murder, Harry presumed.
“You’re welcome, by the way.” He called out as he entered an adjoining room.
Harry looked aghast. "Oh, mate, no. I was so happy! Stop!" Harry shouted at Ron as the orchestra grew louder.
“Merlin, Potter, really, announce yourself kindly. Someone could be severely damaged, I’d hate for it to be me.”
(See the end of the chapter for
“Harry Potter for Ministry of Magic, Auror HQ, Urgent.”
“And why should I?” Malfoy looked a bit mollified, but glared up at him all the same -- Arys was, in heels, taller than the both of them.
“How did you even get in here?”
President Harpone and his daughters.
but in the papers the next day runs a pic of the 3 of them
"What?"
“Oi, ferret-face! Don’talk ‘bout my WIFE LIKE that at her GALA YOU dirty cunny!"
Belgium.
Harry looked at her.
“Go.” She commanded.
“Quack, QUACK!” He waved his hands. Harry lifted it and sloshed a bit of wine while doing so. “All right, all right.” His red ears and off-balanced grin made Harry wonder who was the more drunk in this conversation.
Harry acquiesced silently. When Arys referred to him as “Harold James”, no matter how many times he protested that wasn’t his name, it meant she was upset. Supremely upset. And nobody could get upset with “Harold James” quite like Arys.
“Lucifer,” Harry greeted.
Harry stomped over to the laughing idiot, threw the Invisibility Cloak over the both of them to be doubly safe, and grabbed onto the twat’s elbow, yanking him, Apparating through his wards and into Harry’s Dark Room.
“Yes, well, Saviour complex or none, this isn’t any more of Mr Potter’s concern than it is his sleeping neighbors.” Rosier smirked.
Oh my God, I can't believe I wrote HOUSE-ELVES who were not in REVOLT like Jesus FUCK MAN! Oh, the shame.
MORE AND MORE I THINK THIS FIC IS ABOUT HOW FAME SUCKS AND IS STUPID BUT ALSO A USEFUL TOOL AND ALSO HYPOCRITICAL
He sits, forearm forgotten. Waiting for Phineas’ response.
“Harold. Close your mouth when you chew.” Arys said and poked his ribcage with her wand.
“Our room is very private.”
“I, erm, reckon we’d better go back to Hogwarts, then. Minister?” Harry tries.
“I don’t think --” Harry rose
“Not a mite.”
“Shut up, Malfoy, and come on.” Harys, becoming Harry now as the room grew blurred, began Transfiguring Malfoy’s bedcovers in an effort to make him move faster.
“Right. Okay. Cancel with Gellian, will you? Please.”
NO POTHEADS I EMAN I FORGOT I CHANGED IT OMG
The wards emitted a high-pitched laugh.
Harry fumed, but couldn’t really see any other options. “Fine.”
TOPIC: IMPORTANT MATTERS RE TONIGHT’S GALA
From ancient grudge break to new mutiny,”...
And the afternoon passed in a similar fashion.\
ANYWAY
Malfoy leans in closer to Harry and lowers his voice, “I’m jealous. I’m hurt. I can’t be held responsible for my actions.”
He suspects it more likely that Malcker simply flushed himself into the Ministry one day, Transfigured the old Spin Wizard (Bertram Yule) into a chair, sat upon him and started yelling and cursing at everyone in -- and out of -- range. Harry’d not long ago coerced Ron into going through the Ministry’s Employee Database to check up Malcker’s family records. Harry had earnestly believed it at least 5% possible that the Malckers had Dementor on someone’s side.
“Looks like you guys have been having a lot of fun. Are you ready for lunch?” Harry and Draco both nodded. The adults helped put the figurines back in the cabinet, and then the 4 of them headed down towards the dining room. Draco led the way, holding Harry's hand and telling him all about the things that they were going to do together as cousins/new best friends.
Dinner, as always at the Malfoy household, was lovely and delicious. Once dessert had been finished, the boys went to play in Draco’s room while Narcissa maneuvered them into pajamas and getting relaxed. She finally gave up, and informed the boys that it was okay for them to stay up but that they weren’t allowed to leave Draco’s rooms. She left the giggling boys and went back down to where Lucius and Severus were enjoying a scotch together in Lucius’s study.
“I swear, Rowle, if you put one mark on my son, I will revisit the same on you one hundred fold.” Lucius could see that Severus was almost crackling with rage and power, the air around him charged like a lightning storm. On the other side of him, Remus was growling low in his chest. His eyes had taken on a golden sheen. If Lucius hadn’t known that it was almost the new moon and not the full, he would have feared for his life. But all he could think about was the tiny boy in front of him. He was smaller than Draco, but he was brave and strong. Not caring about being taken, he still fought to protect his family.
“Severus Tobias Snape, do you swear on your blood and your magic to take Harry James Potter as your son? To protect and guide him in the ways of magic and life?” Severus stood tall to his impressive height.
“Harry, it's very late. There are many things that we will need to talk about, but we can do it in the morning. You should try to sleep. “ Harry slipped under the blanket and sheet, marveling at how soft the sheet was and how thick and warm the comforter was. Severus watched Harry for a moment. “Can you snap your fingers, Harry?” Severus made sure that Harry could snap his fingers to turn the light off and on, and then turned to leave the room.
“Remus, I have some important brewing tasks, and I was hoping that Harry could stay with you for a couple of hours before our Christmas Eve dinner.” Remus could have sworn that Severus was fidgeting. “Perhaps you could illuminate him about some of the more interesting features of his new friend.” Remus smiled gently, not wanting to show his elation at being able to spend time around Harry.
The rest of the week went smoothly, with all the midterm testing the children kept mostly out of trouble. That was until Thursday evening, when the peace that had mostly become normal for the Snape family was broken spectacularly.
Half of that Hogwarts wing was destroyed, and it filled Draco with rage. Suddenly, he felt something cold in his throat. Blaise, who was closest to him, turned and pointed his wand, causing a pause in that part of the grounds. Everyone had their wands pointed at each other, except Draco who had the Bellatrix dagger stuck to his throat.
Footsteps echoed wherever he was, and the sound of something sliding.
"Thanks.", Draco hugged her, feeling like crying. Harry would not live, but if their friends could, to continue the fight on his behalf...
"Never.", Draco almost choked on his own spit. Potter came his way, crawling until he was at his face. His eyes were shining and Draco gulped. In less than a minute, Potter had his pants out of his body, only his Muggle underwear covering his dick, and Draco had a lapful of Potter.
He just managed to smile.
Then came the blouses. Fitted, clearly feminine blouses, that hugged Potter's small waist and made his figure look much smaller than it already was.
"Hmmmm, want to keep your cock inside me forever.", The little confession was followed by Draco turning him to face the crowd, that again stopped the game to watch the show.
Draco caressed Potter's thighs, feeling the softness of his skin covering his muscles. The brunette had his body covered in goosebumps as Draco tried to feel every inch of his skin.
"And there's that too. When did… how… did that happen?", Weasley approached.
Potter did exactly that, and Draco got behind him, sliding his knickers to the side to meet his hole already filled with a plug. He didn't say anything, losing his patience with just the thought of Potter wearing this all day.
"So can I do something else with you?"
"It is foolish to think that the Lord would not kill his archenemy for that reason alone."
What.
When Draco finished talking to the Death Eater at the Mansion, he found himself sprawled on the couch in Severus' office. The Potions Master was in a dark mood, searching his drawers for something.
"Severus.", The Lord's voice was cold.
"I will not give up.", Harry took the shirt in his hands, and kissed Draco's knuckles. "Trust me?"
"Please talk to me…", He sat down, listening to the sobs, not really knowing what to do. The hug he received was surprising.
"Tense. Many children have nowhere to go. It makes me happy to have sold the mansion to the Ministry to make a Shelter.
"Did you see what I was talking about? You would have neither pride nor honor when fighting for him!", The next few seconds were a blur. The Lord's snake attacked him, but before he could protect himself, Longbottom appeared with a sword and cut off her head, just as the snakeman let out a cry.
It's so like him to have a good thing right before he dies.
"But Dumbledore…"
The light tissue in contrast to the dark skin did little to hide the erection, especially when an amount of pre-come left the head region almost invisible. On top of his underwear, Draco traced a straight line with his tongue across the length of Harry's cock.
"I heard that you shared the night before the day of his capture.", Draco turned his face away, not wanting that man's voice (was he still a man?) to tarnish the memories of that night. "Oh, don't be shy. Something normal should not be a cause for shame. But I come here, Draco, to make a proposal."
"Do you want to come, puppy?", Draco shook his head greedily. "You want to fill me with your cum, do you? I'll let you."
Harry almost felt sorry.
He had a decision to make, now.
"Truth."
He went on, getting up and sitting at a maddening pace.
"Did this one count?", Draco asked, lifting Potter again until he was sitting in his lap.
Following those instincts, he went around the mansion. There was a smell… no, it was not a smell in itself. It was a magic trail. A trail that made his nerves go wild, a shiver down his spine and his dick getting hard against the jeans fabric of his pants.
Draco let his forehead touch the other's, his eyes closing in the meantime. A sniffle lifted him out of the post-orgasm cloud.
"What?"
Draco Malfoy loved Harry Potter, and he was now dead in his arms.
"Oh, Draco…", She touched his arms.
"Let me take care of you.", Potter's body fell limp under his care, the moan that left his lips cut by the kiss they exchanged.
"Is it true you and Granger fucked in the prefect's bathroom?"
There was a pause. But Harry, Ron and Hermione stood up applauding, whistling and raising a wave of new applause.
"What do you have in mind?"
"No, with so many Death Eaters being old Slytherins they can get in. It is very dangerous to take risks, we don't even left the little ones there. Speaking of them, can you take them with you?"
"Father."
Draco thanked every deity that gave him his endurance, and grabbed Potter's buttcheeks, markings his ass with only his hands, scratching the skin.
And then, to make Draco's peace of mind go straight out of the window, the boy started wearing skirts.
Draco ran off. How… how would he know where to look? Hogwarts was still huge, and he only had a few hours.
Draco still loved his mother enough to not want her to suffer for his failures.
His Harry.
Conjuring a glass and a pitcher of water, he drank half the content, getting out of bed to go to the bathroom. He cleaned himself up, the cum dry on his body a reminder of what will happen hours ago.
Severus nodded as if he understood. He went to the body and took something from it. Draco did not want to analyze the situation.
"I wish we had our time, without war.", Harry spoke. It was something he thought about in the silence of his cell.
"Since Mr. Potter so humbly spread his legs like a whore for you, son. Who knew Gryffindor would act so…"
It didn't take Harry long to realize that the hands that covered his eyes as soon as dinner appeared were Draco's.
"They… don't deserve to die. Nobody deserves to die for something they have no control over. And ... there's nothing wrong with all of this."
Draco rolled his eyes, but she finally stopped lecturing and announced they would play Truth or Dare.
"Draco, dear. The Dark Lord wishes to have a word with you before we go to the station."
Pansy and Blaise approached him.
"Two.", Potter finally said, with a breathless laugh.
"You can. Horcrux is the Ravenclaw diadem. Search and destroy it at any cost.", He looked at his arm, and Draco knew that the Lord was calling him. "Go. Now."
"I thought we could stay in the Slytherin communal.", Screams of 'what' and 'are you crazy?' were heard.
He stood up, supporting his weight on his knees, until he had only the head of Draco's cock inside him, sitting hard against the blonde.
"Luna, what are you doing? You have to take everyone to a safe place, the Lord will arrive at any moment!"
What reminded him...
Draco felt that tug, and noticed his wand still on the floor beside him.
"Why didn't we become friends long before, Harry?"
"Treason?", Draco felt taken by the same fury that made him put Fiendfyre in the Diadem. He turned to the other students, who were now paying attention to him. "None of you had to spend the summer locked at home with a maniac! None of you saw ... HE DOES NOT CARE ABOUT THE PURE BLOOD CAUSE! HE ONLY CARES ABOUT POWER AND KILLING! How many of your parents didn’t come back late at night hurt after hours of torture? He doesn't even care who serves him, they are all the same for him: insects that he can crush whenever he wants. And I'm not going to let the name Malfoy go to waste because of it. Regardless of which side wins, that's what we're going to be! PAWNS ON ONE SIDE AND PARIAHS ON THE OTHER! AND I'M TIRED OF BEING MANHANDLED THIS WAY!
"Granger, regardless of the problems we had, they are just children, and most importantly: they are not me. Please, they are not to blame for what is happening…"
"Say it to them.", Draco whispered into Potter's ear.
"Hm… Terrence Boot?", Harry asked, teasing the blonde who released him.
"It's not like it happened to us, Siri. Remember that time…"
"Welcome. This year, full of changes, will be one of the most difficult we have ever faced. We all went through a war, where we lost loved ones and made new friends. Our world needs young people like you, who did not let themselves be beaten even when the chances were small, who did not stop fighting for what is right, to guide our entire society towards better and fairer times. On this first day, I would like to make a toast to the houses, as each in its own way protected the castle and saved the lives of many. A toast to the Ravenclaw!"
"All right. Draco. But you'll still call me Potter."
The Gryffindor wiggled his ass until it was aligned with Draco's cock, and giggled (GIGGLED) when he felt it already hard.
Merlin was the first wizard in the world, and the most powerful in history. He had one student, Morgana Le Fay, and the love of his life, Nimue. They were the first witches in recorded history. Merlin used his magic to help Kings and Queens and common men around the world. The most famous of these was King Arthur, the King of Brittania and the Celts. Arthur was the most honorable man in the world, but he was betrayed by his wife Guinevere and his best friend Lancelot when the two of them fell in love. Arthur sank into depression and despair, and lost sight of the fact that one of his knights, Mordred, was plotting against him.
“HARRY!!” he heard a small, childish voice cry out. Seemed he had less time than he thought. Rowle ran into the garden, holding Harry against his chest and covering his mouth so that he couldn't cry out and alert anyone to where they were.
“And what is to stop him from just attempting to kill Harry when he finds that he can’t escape?” Severus turned to Lucius, his face stone cold but fear behind his eyes. “I will not lose my son, Lucius.” The two men stood there for a moment, wracking their brains for how best to track Rowle and Harry, when another figure stepped out from the ballroom behind them.
“It's perfect, Father.” Severus touched one of the tiles with a snake on it, and bubbles began to form in the tub. Severus turned back to Harry and gestured at his pajamas.
“I can help teach you how to ride, and you can come over and eat candies and pastries and hot chocolate and spend the night and we can play all the games, and I can introduce you to Theo and Pansy and Blaise and Crabbe and Goyle and we can have camp outs in the garden and we can see if anything else reacts like the little toys. Do you have any other surprises?” Harry just followed, wide-eyed, and occasionally looked back at his father in wonder. Did Draco ever breathe?
“I am going to escort you today, but I think you will be able to go over by yourself in the future. If you are comfortable with that?” Severus always made sure that he asked Harry before just making decisions, a little way for him to give Harry a measure of control in his life.  Harry nodded slowly, and Severus held out his hand.
Harry could see that the dragon was pacing back and forth over Draco's palm like it was agitated, like the dragons had on the store table. Harry held his hand out so that the tips of his fingers were touching Draco's hand. The little dragon stopped pacing and turned towards Harry's hand, sniffing as if it had smelled something tasty. The next thing that either of the boys knew, the tiny dragon galloped over onto Harry's hand and flipped over on it's back, rolling around like a cat on a catnip field. Draco's mouth dropped open in surprise.
Severus comes to an uncomfortable realization, then does something about it.
“The first day is always the hardest, Severus. He will be fine. Now, I was planning on checking and seeing where he was on the basics, then get him started on history and the basics on Magic Theory. Unless you have any objections?” Severus had thought about this right after Narcissa made the offer.
“Are you my Master?” Harry didn’t think so, but he didn’t want to do anything else without talking to his father first.
**********
“The evil man was trying to hurt you. But your parents, your... mom, she protected you. With her love, with magic. And when the man tried to hurt you, his spell backfired and he disappeared. No one knows what happened to him. “ Harry looked down at the table. Severus knew that this conversation was going to have repercussions later, but he didn't want to have to lie to Harry or give him false platitudes. He knew that Harry was stronger than that.  He put his fork down and slid off his chair to kneel next to Harry.
“I am sorry for scaring you, Tippy. Everything was so big and open, and I was so scared. I'm so used to my cupboard under the stairs. The wardrobe just felt safer and smaller.” Severus processed this for a moment, wishing that he had been able to mete out some sort of punishment to Petunia for her treatment of her nephew. He also tried to think about how to give Harry a place where he felt safe while also helping him heal.
“We are going to be traveling by magical means. It will be easier for you if I carry you. Okay?” Harry nodded, and Severus picked Harry up and propped him on his hip. “This might be a little uncomfortable. It will get easier in time, I promise.” Severus took a breath, and Apparated.
Also, just a note, Albus doesn't THINK that he's doing wrong. HE knows where best to use the support of the House of Potter. For the Greater Good (TM) and all. Gods, he makes me mad though.
“A thousand years of peace.” Severus muttered. Remus had gone white at the comment about the “wolf”. Severus grabbed the glass of fire whiskey out of Lucius’s hand, ignoring his indignant “Hey!” and drained it before slumping into a chair.
“And what is my part to play in keeping Harry safe?”
Harry was sitting on the couch waiting for his check up. He looked cleaner than the last time she saw him and was wearing clothing that actually fit him. Poppy noticed that his eyes were red, as if he had been crying, but he looked a great deal better overall. Poppy's eyes welled up as she saw how well Severus was taking care of his new son. But she shook the tears from her eyes and got down to business.
“Harry, do you remember the things that you weren’t supposed to talk to anyone about?” Lucius called. Harry blinked for a moment, and then something in his eyes changed. Lucius swore that Harry aged a hundred years in front of him.
“That is where you lose me. And frankly, where Albus did too. And Madam Pomfrey. I don’t understand why you and Madam Pomfrey think that Albus is a danger to Harry. Or why he would lie to me about Harry’s well-being.”
“Um, Mister... um... Snape. What do I call you?” Severus smiled to himself, glad that Harry was willing to talk to him.
“F... Father?” Severus paused at the door to the room, his chest tightening at hearing his title for the first time. He blinked a couple of times to make sure that there were no tears in his eyes before turning around.
Harry was writhing around on the center of the bed. His face was red and he was shrieking almost without stopping for breath. Severus moved to the side of the bed to comfort and sooth Harry back into sleep when he noticed something. The scar on Harry's head was angry, red, and gaping as if it was a fresh wound. Severus hesitated to touch Harry, not sure what effect it would have on Harry. He wasn't sure what he was witnessing, but he was more convinced now that the Dark Lord wasn't gone than ever before.
“I know, Ari. I am sorry, I don't know why I get so angry. Maybe when Harry comes to hang out, I won't get so angry all the time. “ The house elf nodded, and began to clean things up. Draco left go to find his mom and tell her his great plan.
As soon as the classroom was clear, Severus made his way back to his chambers. He quietly opened the door, and was surprised to see that Harry was asleep on the couch. The book that he had given to Harry with animals from around the world was open on the couch next to him, and the journal was next to his head. Severus sighed, and smiled. He was happy to see that Harry was relaxed enough to be able to fall asleep so easily.
“Harry... he...” Lucius nodded sadly, and touched his friend's shoulder.
“The serpent and the wolf…” murmured Lucius.
Severus couldn't hold back any longer. The warmth that he had shared when he adopted Harry had eroded some of his icy demeanor, and he felt a fondness for his closest friends welling  up inside him. These composed and careful friends of his, who had been through hell at his side. A chuckle started in his throat and grew until it was full throated laughter.
As soon as Severus realized that the table was a distraction, he ignored it and started shoving through people to try to get to the terrace. He had hoped that when he got there he would at least get a glimpse of Rowle or Harry. He pushed down his panic, and started moving down the stairs, straining to listen for any sound of struggling or movement from the garden. He couldn’t hear anything because the garden was lit, and Lucius’s stupid fucking white peacocks were screaming and walking around. Severus was half a step from setting them on fire when Lucius came running out.
“I am sorry Father, but Shadow was telling me to go with him, and I was told by…” Harry was speaking English again, but paused for a moment and looked at the floor. “I was told that I should trust my instincts, and I felt like it was important that I go with Shadow. And I talked to a gargoyle statue, and a friend who needed me. Well, I think it is. I was worried about leaving the chambers, but I can show you where I went if you want?” Harry held up the basket in his hands. The egg in the basket rocked back and forth, and Remus and Severus could both see a glow from inside shift as the inhabitant of the shell moved. Both Severus and Remus jumped slightly as Harry hissed again, this time directed at the egg.
“Lucius, I know that you guessed my loyalties were not completely with the Dark Lord years ago. I also know that you would do nothing to risk your family.  Should the Dark Lord rise again, I will do everything in my power to see him ground to dust before he lays a hand on my son.” Lucius reached out to hold Narcissa's hand, remembering how his previous actions as a Death Eater had almost shattered their marriage. “It is my thought that you should help me. Help me teach Harry about his heritage and the traditions in our world that are so important. Help me do everything to put that bastard in the ground.
“Very well. The boys are very well matched. We spoke about the history of magic, and Merlin, and the many forms that magic can take. And then spoke of magical creatures, and where they can be found throughout the world.” Lucius nodded.
Harry gets some things off his chest, and takes a large step towards healing.
“You never have to worry about being in trouble for something you didn't know, or something that you didn't have control over. If you do something that you know you aren't supposed to, I will ALWAYS talk to you about it. I promise.” He could feel that Harry was starting to cuddle against him for comfort, and that he had stopped crying. Severus lifted Harry into his arms and sat down on the side of his bed.
"Three."
Draco was dueling Voldemort?
"I trained with Bellatrix."
The rest of the room gasped loudly, as if them having sex wasn't as shocking as them kissing. They kissed hard and deep, tongues caressing each other. When they finally stopped, they spent some seconds looking into the other's eyes.
"What?"
She answered.
"Use the fireplace to communicate your success to the mansion, and then go down to my office."
"I came to bring food to the prisoner.", Junior, then. Harry sat against the cold stone wall and rested his forehead on the rail. Draco wouldn't be able to pass, not after the last time he went down and got caught.
Before the rest of the room could even look away, Draco was slowly fucking into Potter again, this time with a pace so slow he was almost not moving at all. But the brunette was very sensitive, squirming and whimpering, while Draco showered his neck and shoulders with open mouthed kisses.
"Please, you need to take them all to a safe place. He would never... I would never forgive myself."
"Draco!", Harry's voice came through the sterile walls.
"I know. I know.", He let the other hug him, until he fell asleep and Draco could put him close to him, hoping for any greater force to keep them safe and alive.
"What?", Draco and the Weasel asked at the same time.
"When?"
"Father, hold those dogs. They will not touch Potter until he is dressed.", A hand on his arm pulled him back to the bed, while a look of contempt studied the blonde. If his own nudity wasn’t enough evidence, the used and dirty sheet laying on the floor and the clothes scattered were indicative enough.
"Huh? What was that?"
"You've been a very obedient puppy, Draco. One day I'll still put a collar on you, and make you walk on all fours in front of everyone. What do you think?", The pleading sound that came out of Draco's throat could not be completely classified as a moan or a cry. But the tears were there, now streaming down his face. Ice Prince of Slytherin, thought Harry, what would your subjects think if they saw you like this? "As you were a good puppy, I'll let you have your reward now."
"They are receptacles for parts of someone's soul. The Dark Lord has six."
"Uh… did I miss something?"
Malfoy still seemed to process what Harry said, but his fingers moved quickly to the pajama top, quickly tearing the piece off and throwing it across the bed. Harry soon took off his own dirty and soaked shirt and threw it on the floor. And then they kissed. Chapped and cold lips against soft, warm lips.
He sneaked down the halls, until he reached the headmaster's office. The password, which he obtained by obscure means, came out of his lips in a shaky whisper. The door opened.
Potter had come on his panties and his cum was sliding to the floor.
Draco waited in a corner where he knew Potter would be walking by alone. Don't ask how he learnt where and when he walked alone.
"You heard the dare, are you going to back down?", Pansy smiled that little smile that meant she wanted entertainment.
He snorted. What kind of mansion has a dungeon? And even more one with a bathroom, even if in the open, a good mattress and a table?
"The young ones? THEY ARE CHILDREN, HOW CAN THEY BE MORE SKILLED THAN THEIR OWN PARENTS?"
Potter finally looked him in the eye, and nodded.
"Just before coming back to school. He said he wouldn't torture Harry if I did."
"Get up, Potter.", The brunette staggered but got up. Before Draco could do anything, the jet of green light came out of Voldemort's wand.
"I have failed in many things, Mr. Malfoy. I believe that now I have to pay for these failures."
"Nuh-huh. Shut up.", He blew on the dick in front of him, watching the barely visible hairs on Draco's legs stand on end and the muscles in his thighs spasm. "So big… ah, your dick is going to tear me in half, Draco. Is it as tasty as it looks? What if I…?"
"Draco, what you are talking about is…", Blaise looked pale, his black skin taking on a shade of gray.
"HARRY! How could you?", But he was laughing, even when he sat down. "I think McGonagall is doing very well in the position of headmistress, isn't she?"
, I mean
“Go away and I will find you when I’ve finished. Then you’ll know.”
“Look, I’m just. I’ve got a feeling. And if you don’t hurry the Muggles are about to cart everything away and we’ll lose this one.”
“Late!” She hooked their arms. “With me.” And tugged him to their destination, hoping they wouldn’t be late.
DO NOT BE LATE
“For that I am grateful, Potter. Truly.” Malfoy yelled, muffled by some bodily movement going on in the other room. Harys had a horrfic suspicion, just then.
He opened the door.
Saturday
“Merlin, all right!” He shoved off the pecking ‘Daily Lucifer’ from Arys and opened the sealed parchment.
, I mean
Malfoy shook his head.
Magical Creatures and Beings’ Rights Foundation
“I know. Well, I didn’t know until after I had already put it in place. Like months after. And,--” Harry was beginning to ramble and was hoping on an Arys interruption.
“Better. Stop messing your hair. Now go say hi.” Arys pointed, “There, Gringotts Board Member Albert Tepougé and his partner, Cary Renninger. No, left. Yes. Squeeze them, please them.”
"'Potter's puppet pals'" -- they love alliteration over there," Harry remembered.
Wow, what a gearshift!
“Ha, ha,” Harry said around another cracker and cheese. “Either, I suppose,” he admitted.
Harry watches him retreat. There’s something about Malfoy he’s darned forgetting here.
“I appreciate your invitations, very much so. Unfortunately, I’ll be quite busy the next couple of days. Perhaps we can schedule an outing to Diagon Alley, or something, erm, next week. Have you been yet?”
“Fine. As you will," Arys says. "And you’d better learn the proper name of Ms. Granger’s Foundation before tomorrow evening. I’m not helping you, don’t give me that face.” Arys rolls some of her silver hair into a curler. “I’ll make arrangements with Memene now. Tomorrow, 1400. See you then, you sodding brat.”
“One person may never know.” Malfoy stepped out from the closet, dressed spectacularly in another one of his black dress robes, and smirked. “How’s my hair? Will there be photographers?”
“We’ll be late!” She shouted back.
BUT LISTEN THERE’S NO POTTER DAY SAINTS (THIS FIC AIN’T THAT!)
And that's a wrap, folks! I'll end this four chapter and seven year old fic with notes I wrote in the original document like 2 years after I'd written anything new.
“Is this finally happening, then?” A voice behind Harry prompted. He spun around and so did the room. He slapped a hand upon the window to right himself.
“Great.” Harry forced a grimace. “Thanks.”
His spine was aching, his formals somewhat crumpled, (Memene would not be pleased, Harry had a feeling these were meant to last a season at least), and their  sleeves and his chin drooled all over.
And withdrew his head from the fire.
“Thank you, Hogwarts, for your time and your enthusiasm.” Perfidy beams once more. “I’ll be carrying the fond memory of your smiling faces with me blah blah dad joke boring Ministry tripe.”
Harry huffed.
Harry swings like a pendulum.
“Five.”
“Harry, old sport! I was wondering when you’d turn up! How do you?” Minister Phoebus Perfidy doffed his shoulder.
Rosier stuck her index finger into her cup while eyeing Harry.
“... Mother’s sacrifice, I can’t begin to fathom, but I do care so dearly for you, Harry...” Arys monologued on, letting Harry work through everything in his mind.
“Arys.”
Arys Wronsky
Harry nodded, mute, again.
“They aren’t matching, fawn. Not after that Prophet page 6."
Ron pointed from Harry's hand and made a dirty gesture.
“I REALISE THIS, POTTER. THERE ARE MORE IMPORTANT THINGS AT STAKE PRESENTLY THAN THE STATE OF MY HAIR BUT THANK YOU FOR NOTICING. YOUR ATTENTION TO DETAIL IS AS ALWAYS PRECISE.”
“Honestly, mate,” Ron leaned in, breath smelling like fizzy alcohol, “I suspect,” he paused for dramatics, “she bribed some of them. With BLACKMAIL!” He said proudly.
“Arse.”
Harry awoke some time in the late morning. He’d gotten to the part after Romeo and Juliet meet and the party ends before Apparating himself upstairs. He didn’t fall asleep on couches anymore; Harry Potter was not the kind of person who fell asleep on couches or loveseats anymore. It was most likely something Arys had knackered into him, either that or, it was the result of having endured too many nights with Phineas waking him up, repeatedly, and in various loud and annoying ways. (One time, he somehow managed to get all of the dead Headmasters and Headmistresses to join him in a terribly pitchy rendition of some Muggle song called “Back in Black”, (which then led Harry to seriously question what exactly McGonagall got up to in that office).
“Let’s get it done with.”
"Tis I, the Frenchiest Fry," Arys said through clenched teeth and jaw, puckered lips and a whitening face.
That ever so special smile you typically reserve for people you actually enjoy? Use it. Abuse it. I don’t care. It’s crucial we make a good impression on the President. He’s currently in talks with the Minister over some nasty Auror and Chocolate Frog business. We need you to charm them up...” Arys went on, but Harry stopped listening somewhere after Chocolate Frog. He was really hungry.
“Not again,” someone down the table quietly prays.
“What, why do you get to wear a suit?” She was in a grand, fitted cloud-coloured number.
She closed her eyes, as if Harry was the most trying person on the planet and making the most impossible request a person could possibly make.
A crying girl and two policemen were huddled near enough that Harry could hear their conversation. The stranger was, apparently, walking her home from a second date. No, she didn’t know him very well. It was only a second date. She couldn’t remember exactly what happened after they left the theatre. There were flashes. Lights. And then he was bloody and dead. She only remembered him saying, “Red cloak. Gold mask.” No, she didn’t know what that meant. She didn’t know if he had any enemies. They met on the internet.
Ron blew his mouth into a big bubble and made a number of grotesque and threatening faces towards Harry.
Harry eschewed the Invisibility, chucked a handful of green powder into the fireplace and shoved his head inside.
No lates!
“You did got married! Can we go upstairs and you will tell me about it posthaste!” Harry smiles and tugs his best friend in the direction of the nearest staircase.
PS. I'm pretty certain
If Rita Skeeter had asked little Harry Potter, Champion of Hogwarts, whether or not he imagined he’d be returning to the place at the age of twenty-three, he might have said “sure”.
He looked behind him at a spelled-silent Malfoy, gesticulating madly. He brought his finger to his lips very pointedly, and nodded to the chair next to him.
This clearly wasn’t a coincidence. But it also didn’t make any sense.
He scrambled to the kitchen for tea, gulped it while showering, and changed into his sage green semi-formals.
No, the bloody body lying in the square would certainly not bode well for Mister Harry Potter.
“Fashionably late, egg?” Ron quipped, and laughed at both Harry’s formals and his own ridiculous joke. Harry snorted with him.
“Malfoy,”
“Is that your closet in there? You have a closet, that you can literally walk into, like a seperate room? I mean, mine makes sense, but how many bloody sets of black dress robes does one person need?”
“You. Us, wizards, whatever! Just hurry! Trust me!”
He used to trip unfailingly. He only trips about half the time now.
“Right, well, this way then.”
In conclusion, who knows what this fic is about!
Malfoy responded with a slightly withering stare.
“But hopefully only when this is all over.” Whittery mourned, and with that, he and Rosier took their leave. Harry walked them back up the stairs.
“Listen, Malfoy, this is really serious. I wouldn’t be here otherwise. You know as well as I do how terrifically we don’t get on. But I need your help, or something probably  terrible is going to happen.” Harys pleaded.
“I suppose.”
“Harry my BLEACHED ARSEHOLE.”
“Harold,” She mock-simpers.
“Thank you!” Harry called off, as Kreacher popped into the nothingness.
Unfortunately, Malcker’s good at something here, so here he stays; here, barking at the Minister for Magic.
Ron interrupts Harry’s fragmented thoughts, “Bloody hell I’m never drinkung again. Or getting married again. Only, there’s AUGUST!” he bemoans.
“Thank you. I haven’t even made it into the ballroom, yet.”
And then Apparated immediately home.
Tuckholm Malcker is potentially the worst thing to have infiltrated the Ministry since Lord Worst himself. In the course of a few months, he’s given the Ministry and its employees more grief than that Common Welsh incident two years ago. Someone must have hired him, Harry supposes, but he can’t recall who. Not even Hermione remembers.
“It’s Harry, Arys, and yes. I understand. It just, it happened so quickly. I didn’t know what to do.”
“Move.”
“Bring them down here. I’ll prepare the tea.”
“Just a joke, Minister. Just joking.” Harry informs, rolling his eyes along with the fluffy Spring clouds.
“Good and bollocksed!” he marvels, “Malfoy can’t say a thing.”
“Wanker. I’ve been here. I’ve only just made it here, that’s all.” He aimed a cute little Quack-Attack at Ron, for good measure and fun and all that.
President Harpone gave his daughters a stern glare, and Harry a mildly amused one.
Arys, dressed impeccably in a crisp charcoal suit, eyed him critically and entered.
It wasn’t often crimes (Wizarding, Muggle, or otherwise) occurred so near Harry’s place of residence. It had happened once before, and he was asked to speak as witness despite the fact he never saw the mugging take place. He only woke when the shouting began. Habit, he supposed at the time. What it was now, he had no idea and was reluctant to find out.
“Should? I can’t really have any shoulds or variables, Malfoy. See, I might be accused of murder, or lying, or some shit, if this doesn’t work, okay? So I need to know.”
“Harry, this’ll be a huge event. Everyone from Perfidy to yes, your friends, will be in attendance,” Arys insists. He curls up his stomach to touch the broom, then curls back down to touch the floor. Trying to listen. “I’ve got it from Zuri in Foreign Relations that dignitaries from various countries’ Magical Creatures branches will be present. It’s an international interest, fawn, you’ve got to look your best. Jared has it at least half the Prophet staff will be there!”
“Mr Potter, I’m Auror Whittery. Auror Rosier and I have some questions for you, if you wouldn’t mind.” He smiled politely.
“I am. Off you pop,” Malfoy waved Harry away. Harry took a moment to pause in the doorway to watch him work. It reminded him unsettlingly of Dumbledore and Voldemort’s Cave. He still couldn’t speak with magic like that, but it seemed Malfoy could. It was as entrancing, as eerie as it was when he had watched Dumbledore so many years ago.
Harry knew their names.
He smacks his hands slowly together, half-arsedly feigning enthusiasm, as Minister Perfidy beams and performs a little number of bows and curtseys. The students exchange faces a bit confused, somewhat bemused, but primarily unused. Harry had struggled to keep his own eyes open, if he’s being completely honest. But he’s rarely that, these days.
"As much as I wish I could do this all night, it's me, Potter."
Harry’s urgency made her less likely to comply, he was finding.
He stands, scours the scene for her. He watches a group of what looks like Slytherin first-years wave Perfidy off.
“Ron has something he'd like to say to you!” He said and grinned devilishly at Ron, who was now breathing heavily through his nose.
President Harpone was perfectly polite. He thanked Harry for his services to the Wizarding, and Muggle, worlds. (One of the few to add in the Muggle, Harry noted).
Mémene had outdone herself, sending the newest and bluest of formal robes. Robin’s-Egg blue, with the tiniest beige speckles, just like the bloody eggs. They weren’t unattractive, per se, but they certainly weren’t anything Harry would ever choose for himself voluntarily.
Harry gulps on a laugh. Perfidy, petrified, turns slightly aside towards his PR person, who -- along with much of the Hogwarts staff -- is attempting to cover their chortles with coughs and cups.
He peers under the red and gold fabric and watches Perfidy as he’s escorted down the Great Hall by no fewer than six Aurors, three PR reps, an Appearance Specialist and a Handler, one temporarily acquired Headmistress, and one flapping Indian Runner Duck. And no one brings up the duck in public, not after Calgary.
"Hermione’s going be having fuzzy Kneazles! SO MANY PEOPLE!” Harry mouthed.
“Did a little more than toying, but yeah. Fine. Take it.” Harry closed his eyes as Malfoy grabbed the wand.
“Harold! James! There is a bloody body a metre from your stoop and Aurors Obliviating Muggle police to Muggle oblivion. Explain, and quickly.”
IT'S ABOUT CHOOSING MINIMALISM DESPITE ACCESS TO EXCESS ETC AND HARRY FINALLY MAKES THAT CHOUES AND BECOMES HIMSELF ALSO ARYS IS RIDE OR DIE SO IS DRACO (EVENTUALLY!)"
“Oh, Harold, is that really necessary?”
“My house.” Harry didn’t feel the desire at the moment, or ever, to explain the intricacies of his Dark Room to Draco Malfoy. “This is my... whatever, erm... This is safest room in the house. I’m going to change.” He looked over at Malfoy, touching the walls and performing little bits of magic with his own wand, too distracted now to comment on Harry’s appearance, “Can you read all my existing wards from here?”
“Coming!” He shouted.
Harry and Arys dressed for Hermione’s Gala in the official “modé room”.
Harry drank his coffee standing, forked in a tumble of scrambled eggs, and the owl flapped its wings.
"Ask me!"
“Yes. I will.”
“Yeah, right, great, okay, cool. I don’t have time for a nap, Malfoy. Listen.”
Harry grabbed two glasses, passed one to Arys, and then a handful of cheese and one grape. For posterity.
“Said your mother, and then your father, and then your Auntie: Shoulda-woulda Condom.” Malcker pans, glaring at Perfidy all the mean while.
“You’ll be fine, fawn.” She pat his back. “Just don’t let them hear your stomach grumbling.”
“I can’t get over Goyle, I can’t, I really can’t, Arys. I just, what is Hermione thinking? I know, she’s being Hermione about it, and yes, Arys,” Harry interjected when he noticed the incredible look on her face, “I have asked her about it, believe me. Dozens of suppers. She just says he’s quiet and good at his job. I don’t get it.”
“Shit. Forgot. Need wand, be back.”
Harry Apparated upstairs to a more calm Arys sitting in the parlour, reading.
‘Room. Now.’ He mouthed and nodded to them both. They nodded back. They got up, Arys had spelled everyone’s movements silent but Harry’s and he grabbed her by the crook of the elbow into the darkness.
“You love her.”
“Bonjour, Msr Tepouge, and Mr Renninger.”
He pulled the parchment on the table closer.
“It’s the afternoon, Harry. Your time for breakfast has long since expired. You’ll eat at Tea, I promise. I’m not sure what, probably some Belgian specialty.”
“YEAH, MY BUGGERING WIFE! ALL RIGHT, MALFOY?” and Ron finally manages to withdraw his wand from his pocket and holds it up over Harry’s head and utters, “TARANT--” but Harry slaps his wand down.
“Ah, Phoebs, bloody genius. Let’s ask the table, shall we? Oi, woody, does the wand choose the wizard or is it the wizard chooses the wand HE’S GOING TO SHOVE UP THE OTHER WIZARD’S SHITTER IF THAT’S WHAT FUCKING GETS HIM MOVING OUT OF THE IMMOBILE FUCKING CHAIR. SHALL WE ASK THE CHAIR NOW, COME PHOEBS, LET’S HAVE A GO!” Malcker shouts, chucking his arms about in a bad parody of a Seeker, Harry thinks.
"Thank you.", Draco was serious. He didn't know what the next thing to say would be.
“Thank you, very much.” Poppy looked at the two of them standing next to each other. Maybe it was the adoption ritual, but the two of them looked like they had always been a family. A moment later, Poppy had headed back to the Hospital Wing.
Albus looked up from his seat at Severus’ arrival. “Ah, there you are, my lad. I have a small favor to ask of you. It seems that young Harry might be in some sort of distress. I informed Petunia when she took Harry that she wouldn’t be bothered by anyone from our world, but we should check on Harry just to confirm that nothing untoward is happening. Since you are familiar with the Muggle world, I thought it would be best for you to investigate. Subtly, of course.”
“What can Tippy do for Potions Master and Master Harry Potter?” Harry goggled at the creature with a tiny, squeaky voice. Harry thought that the creature might be a female.
Harry couldn't see what the woman who just walked in looked like, but she sounded like an older lady with an accent that he wasn't familiar with. He nodded in her direction, and then blinked a couple of times as something occurred to him.
“Blow,” Severus ordered. Harry blew his nose, and Severus could see that he swallowed down the rest of his tears. Harry smiled weakly at Draco.
After dinner and a bath, during which Harry's head would slowly droop then snap back up as he valiantly tried to stay awake, Severus helped Harry into his pajamas and into bed. Severus picked one of the chapter books that they had gotten that afternoon, The Secret Garden, and began to read to Harry. Harry was wrapped around his giant dragon and was watching Severus read. Moments after they had began, Shadow slunk into the room and jumped up on the bed. Severus noted that he had the tiny dragon in his mouth and was about to chastise the feline before realizing that Shadow was holding him very carefully. Shadow carefully placed the figurine on the bed and curled up against Harry's hip.
Draco thought that he had won the best friend lottery. Harry could do WANDLESS MAGIC. At their age! He knew that it was just knocking over the salt shaker, but he had NEVER heard of ANYONE who could do that as a kid. Ignoring his parents, Draco scooted his chair closer to Harry.
“This is the bathroom. The next door is my private chamber. This is my private space, as your room will be your private space. Harry lifted his head to look at Severus with wide eyes.
Thank you for supporting me all this time!
“Uncle Sev! Uncle Sev! Tell my father that he should let me have the cat that I found in the garden! It wants to come home with me!” Harry didn't know what to make of the blond haired boy, but he thought that he sounded a lot like Dudley and looked a little bit like a girl. He had fine features and long, almost white hair.
Severus’s good mood was shattered the Monday before Winter Break started at Hogwarts. He was summoned to the Headmaster’s office for the first time since he had adopted Harry. Severus called over to the Malfoy’s and requested that Harry stay there for dinner, and then made his way up to the Headmaster’s tower.
Despite his blurry vision, which he was used to, he could tell that he was in a large room with many beds. The walls appeared to be made of some sort of stone, and standing next to his bed was a slightly plump woman in a grey dress and a white apron, and a tall man with black hair, black eyes, and black clothes. Harry didn’t know where he was, or who these people were, and so he didn’t say anything. He knew that often, if he didn’t say anything, it was less likely that he would be in trouble. His stomach clenched in fear, but he didn't know what to do.
“And what did Lucius have to say about that?” Severus asked hoarsely.
“Severus.” He said warily. “Is Harry okay?”
Narcissa lifted the edge of her skirt and inspected the tear. She sighed, knowing that the elves would be able to repair it as if it had never happened, but she would know. Lucius swirled his Firewhiskey in his glass, thinking about the possible repercussions of his friend's actions.
“Oh, thank the Founders, you are back. I am reminded, quite vividly, why I don't teach potions.”
“Please, don’t let him out of your sight until I come back. We need to make sure that he’s safe.” Pomfrey merely nodded, busy on the charms that she was using to heal the tiny child in the middle of the bed. Severus followed Minerva out of the infirmary and through the halls, listening to her mutter under her breath. “Bloody Muggles, I KNEW that we never should have left him there. I ought to go there and give them a piece of my mind..”.  Severus knew that no matter what else happened, watching Minerva go off on Albus was going to be the highlight of his evening.
He got to 100 on the last step, and in front of him was a large wooden door with carvings all over it. Shadow appeared to be waiting for him, and Harry took a minute to look closely at the door. It was almost like a story. There was a sword being held out of a lake, four people standing in a circle holding hands, a snake and what Harry remembered was a griffon, holding the snake in it’s claws. There were lots of symbols around the outside of the door, and in the middle was a picture of an island with a crown hovering over it. Almost feeling like he was still sleeping or walking through water, Harry walked up to the door and touched the picture in the middle, right over the crown and the island. A moment later, the door opened with a soft click.
“Oh, Harry. You don't have to earn your way. You only have to learn how to be a little kid again. To play, and learn, and make friends. All I want is to see you happy and healthy, and smiling.” Severus sighed, and ran his hand up and down Harry's back comfortingly. Recognizing that Harry might feel better if he was able to help someone else, Severus turned and looked for Tippy.
“Yeah, that would be very helpful. I am going to take Severus and Harry back to the Manor, make sure Narcissa and Draco know they are okay. I will meet you at the gates once I take down the wards.” Remus nodded, and Lucius went to help Severus up and take him back to the manor. Remus watched the serpents move back towards the hedge.
“All I wanted was for them to love me like they did Dudley… but when Father found me I was sleeping outside, and I just wanted to stop hurting. I thought I was going to die.” Narcissa’s eyes closed as the tears she had been holding back slid down her face. This beautiful child had gone through so much, and every trauma that he described felt like physical wounds against her. She swallowed to clear her throat.
**********
“Can I ask you a question, Mr. Lupin?” Harry asked quietly. Remus tried to smile reassuringly.
Remus sighed as he made his way home. At least he'd made a step, and gotten Severus to agree that he would get to spend more time around Harry. He decided that the first thing he was going to do was gather some things that he had from when Lily and James were alive.
“I am okay. That was really scary, and I was worried about Father and Lucius and Mr. Lupin. That bad man was going to hurt them. And maybe me too.” Draco’s eyes were wide. He hadn’t realized that his father was going to be at risk.
+++++
“Master Snape, there is a nasty book breaking all the things, and I cannot find Master Harry!” Snape blanched. Which book was wreaking havoc in his chambers? Was Harry hurt? Severus dashed to the Floo and called Minerva, who he knew had a free period.
I eye it suspiciously.
I collide with Draco’s body “ow” I mutter, pushing him off me.
“Yeah I was” I reply sharply “I just wanted to say” pausing I watch as Malfoy flitches at my tone, instantly I regret it.
"Hey Potter?"
We both start to drift off when I shoot up.
here are some random 2020 Hogwarts headcanons/aesthetics.
Hermione lip trembles as tears began to spill down her cheeks, a sob escapes her chest as she drops her books and flees.
"Potter" I say frantically.
Draco moves in front of me “I was being serious Potter, watching what Moody did? That was bloody horrible, and I imagine it was much worse for you, and I just wanted to make sure you were okay, but since you were a bloody prat about it, you can stay like this” he says, the last part smugly.
“Oh bugger off Malfoy” I angrily reply turning to leave.
"I care because I don't want you to die" he says simply, exhaustion in his voice.
"We saved the wizarding world, does it even matter?" Potter boasts.
“That was bloody rough” Ron grumbles as we walk out of earshot of everyone else.
"You dressed me" I say slowly embarrassment creeping across me.
"Shit" I hear a voice mutter and water slosh as someone touches me, it's all so lost on me and then all I feel is coldness.
I feel my body tingle and go stiff, unable to move, I cannot even speak.
“Oh, I am” I start “actually, yes, lets go” I tell Neville, realising the Great Hall is exactly where Malfoy will be.
My head is pounding and mouth is dry pushing myself up I feel weak.
Confused by Draco’s kindness, but also his callous behaviour after I am left trapped with thoughts of Draco for what seems like hours before the door opens and a gaggle of first year Ravenclaws walk in.
Alright we all know the muggles are sneaking in manic panic and bleach and Filch has no idea what it is so it doesn’t get confiscated. Third floor bathrooms, Friday nights, Slytherins and Ravenclaw’s will bleach and dye your hair the colour of your choosing, Hufflepuffs bring snacks.
“Immobulus” Draco says.
Rumpling his hair he sits on the side of my bed not breaking eye contact.
"Hermione, this is stupid, I'm never going to understand this and I don't know why you made me come back. The ministry offered me a job already" Potter grumbles from the row over.
I head up to the fifth floor unnoticed, entering the prefects bathroom I fill the tub up and undress gripping my wand tightly I climb into the deep tub disappearing under all the bubbles. Only once the hot water starts to burn my skin and my head starts to feel light from lack of oxygen do I let the tears fall.
“Bloody hell” Ron says looking me bewildered, he bends down picking up her books and shrugs heading off after her “see you at dinner” he calls over his shoulder.
Pushing myself out of my armchair I head into my room, so few students returned for the eighth year we each got our own small room within a single dorm instead of houses for our eighth year. Grabbing my pyjamas out of my drawers and a clean robe I head out of the common room and slip quietly into the corridor.
Softening my stanch, I bite my lip, “I just wanted to say thank you,” I tell him, my voice much softer this time.
I had a headcanon I posted on tumblr awhile ago "I always wondered if Snape uses a version of Sectumsempra as a form of self harm on himself." which inspired this piece.
“I just wanted to make sure you were okay” he mutters “that can’t have been easy” Draco looks at the floor.
Pushing my glasses up my nose I sigh, as I start to make my way back to the common room lost in thought. A firm grip on my arm pulls me out of my thoughts as I am yanked into an empty classroom.
A moment later Potter rips the covers back "Stop" he demands his face furious.
"Look I know how that sounds, but we both did things and followed people blindly because we loved them and believed they were doing the right thing. Those choices made us hate each other. We were just children Malfoy" he says sadness radiating off his body, I can see tears coating his eyes. "But now, we've both lost so much, and this summer, I did a lot of thinking. How can I hate you? I don't even know you, you've been such a big part of my life but I know nothing about you and I want to change that and I can't do that if you die. So drink this" he says standing up and filling the goblet up again "and please for the love of Merlin don't try and hurt yourself while I try and get some sleep now that I know you're not going to die" he says.
Pushing myself up, I can feel my face flushed "What do you care Potter?' I spit I can see my reflection in his glasses my cheeks are flushed.
"Oh yeah" he says sheepishly, a blush spreading across his cheeks as he lays back down next to me "well I figured it would be awkward if you woke up naked with me in your room so I dressed you"
I sip the potion slowly, as what happened slowly dawns on me, I feel my body growing hot with embarrassment. Finishing the potion I place the goblet on my bedside table and lay back down staring at the ceiling.
Heading back over to my desk chair he tucks his lanky body up, cramped he looks ridiculous. Thinking about what he just said I realise the prat is right which is irritating.
"I guess the whole eighth year knows" I ask flatly.
Opening up an old potions book Snape had leant me, I get lost in the familiar pages, his notes soothing me.
"Draco" Pansy's nasally voice interrupts me as she slides onto the armrest gently stroking my hair.
Potter looks grateful as he untucks himself and comes back over to the bed laying down next to me.
"You look ridiculous over there, just lay next to me" I say finishing my potion.
Malfoy relaxes, his his twinkle, and he smiles, I think it's the first time I’ve actually seen him genuinely smile.
"Because Harry, your education is important, how are you going to succeed in your job if you haven't completed your N.E.W.T.S?" she explains patiently.
I hear the sound of something hitting him "Sorry" he mutters sheepishly.
Malfoy leans against a desk as he rumples his hair, he looks uncomfortable.
She flitches and hops off the armchair "I just missed you at dinner and wanted to make sure you were okay" she mutters sulking off.
"Its a blood replenishing potion" he says "now drink"
A short mousey looking girl unfreezes me, shaking off the spell I mutter “Thanks” before quickly rushing out of the classroom ready to hunt down Malfoy and give him a piece of my mind.
"Mmmm" he says looking over me, I realised he's taken his glasses off and his green eyes are glowing.
I run into Neville in the corridor, “Hey Harry” he says smiling at me “heading down to dinner, I’ll walk with you”
Dodging her hand, I slam my book closed glaring up at her.
"What?" I snap.
"Yeah" he replies sleepily "I want to know more about that snitch tattoo" he mumbles as a snore escapes him.
Slytherin‘s always sleep late when they don’t have Quidditch, and some how have endless supply of good coffee.
Entering the Great Hall I tell Neville I will join him in a minute, looking around I can’t see Malfoy at his usual spot at the Slytherin table.
“What do you want Malfoy?” I ask weary
Ravenclaws set up a muggle postal service, so you can order make up and other muggle items but have them set to Hogwarts, they have a list of the muggle siblings or parents willing to help, they charge a nice fee too.
"What?" I say shocked, a laugh escapes me, throwing my head back I snicker "you don't want me dead Potter? That's a joke"
"No one knows, I carried you back here under my invisibility cloak and stole the blood replenishing potions from the hospital ward," he tells me, his tone is hard to determine "I've also cast the Imperturbable Charm around your room and its locked down, and a trusted house elf has been bringing food and water"
“Not looking for me are you Potter?” I hear him say softly from behind me, whirling around I glare at him, squaring my shoulders back ready for a fight. Meeting Malfoy’s eyes I see a softness in them, one I’ve never noticed before. Something inside of me freezes, making me rethink my rage.
Severus slowly opened the doors of the wardrobe and found Harry curled on the floor, his blanket wrapped around him as if to protect his head and back. As light shone into the wardrobe, his head came up. His eyes were wide and startled, his face red and streaked with tears. He was breathing heavy, almost hyperventilating.
“You have an idea?” Severus nodded.
Narcissa smiled at the boys.
“When I grow up, I am going to make sure that kids aren’t hurt by their families anymore. I am going to make it a rule.” Severus smiled at Harry.
Harry wiped his face on his blanket, and got up. He went to the bathroom and got a cloth from the shelf next to the bathtub. He began dusting the bookshelves closest to the floor. He carefully dusted the spines and tops of the books. He was surprised at how little dust there was, even at the corners. He made his way around the room, and then moved up to the second shelf and moved the opposite way around the room. He felt better for cleaning something, since this was the first time in as long as he could remember that he hadn't been cleaning something.
“Harry, it’s time to wake up. Your father is here.” Harry opened his eyes and blinked at her, and she realized that being able to wake immediately was one of the things that he had learned at the hands of those people. She smiled down at him. “Are you feeling better dear? That was a lot to talk about.” Harry nodded.
“Harry, I would be honored to teach you to help protect our family. We will have to wait until you have a wand, and I am sure that your father will be teaching you things as well. Until then, I would be more than happy to teach you how to deal with people and recognize when they are trying to manipulate you. We will help you protect your father. ” Without even trying and without either of them knowing it, Harry had appealed to Lucius's greatest weakness and had earned his loyalty.
Minerva walked in first and glanced around the ward to see if there were any students in the beds. Seeing that the ward was empty, she opened the doors to give Severus room to bring Harry in. Madam Pomfrey bustled out from her office, notified by the charm on the doors that let her know when she had a new arrival.
“Harry, this is Mr. Remus Lupin, the man I told you was friends with your parents. He’s going to be teaching you some things in the upcoming weeks.” Remus nodded at Harry, who blinked at him.
Severus was so lost in his thoughts that he almost ran into Remus Lupin, who appeared to be heading down the hall to the Headmaster’s office.
Harry stood up and walked over, gently running his fingers over the dragon and the unicorn curled together. He smiled.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Severus? I was wondering when we would hear from you. Draco was quite overwrought when he came back from your quarters, but he wouldn't say why. I didn't think that he was that upset over a kitten that he found in the gardens.” Lucius stepped into the room, closely followed by Narcissa. They both looked impeccable, as they always did.
“What about Dumbledore?” Severus sneered.
“I wanna bath too!!” Draco yelled, and wiggled out of Lucius’s arms to chase after Severus and Harry. Lucius looked down at the chocolate smeared on his clothes, and Narcissa and Remus both chuckled.
“Uncle Sev, who is that?” He demanded. Severus raised an eyebrow.
“I finally get to see him again, guys. I get to help take care of Harry. I promise, I will take care of him, as much as I can.” Lupin thought over what he had learned from his meeting with Albus and subsequent meeting with Madam Pomfrey. Albus had been all smiles, happy that he was able to offer Remus a place to live and employment, as well as a safe place and access to the Wolfsbane Potion. Remus had heard of the potion, but had no way of obtaining it to see if it really did what advertisements said or if it was just a quick way to poison and dispose of those with the lycanthropy curse.
“I like that name. It sounds very heroic!” Harry exclaimed. Severus smiled at the exuberance that Harry would not have shown when he first came to live with him.
“Are you okay, Harry?” Harry smiled his old man smile up at Severus.
**********
“Thank you for saving him. More than I could possibly say. I tried to get close to him, but was stonewalled by Albus. He said that Harry was fine. I can't tell you how grateful I am. There isn't anything that I wouldn't do for that boy.”
Severus stopped and turned to look at the cat, and directed Harry's attention to the cage. A black cat sat at the front of the cage, looking at the two of them with highly intelligent golden eyes. It had a white star in the middle of it's chest, and was just a little bit older than a kitten. As Harry leaned closer to the cage, the cat leaned out and tapped Harry on the nose, making a “Mrrt” chirping noise. Harry giggled. Severus wanted to know more. He called up to the shop boy.
Draco was ecstatic. He had never had someone so fascinating to play with. Why did all the animated toys react to Harry that way. It was like there was something extra special about him. Draco liked the idea that he had an extra special best friend, and he was excited to find out what else was extra special.
“All of the other guests are being escorted to the Floo. I have already set the wards so that he won’t be able to leave EXCEPT by Floo, and he will have to come back to the house to do so. He won’t take Harry away.” Lucius tried to comfort Severus.
“I can't think about this anymore. I am going to go home, and look through my books. You do the same here. We will talk about this again this weekend. I am hoping that I am going to have some ideas by then. “ Severus put the tumbler on one of the side tables and made his way to the Floo before turning back. “Lucius, thank you. I can't tell you how much it means to me that you are supporting my family.” Lucius smiled and nodded. Severus turned and went through the Floo.
Thank you all, so much. Once again, nothing is mine.
“I do!” Remus went to his bookshelf and pulled a book down. He moved his chair so that they two chairs were side by side. He opened the book to the chapter he marked. “So, your friend, Nala, is an Occamy…”
