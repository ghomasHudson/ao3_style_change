Once they've come back to Harry's house, Draco rubs Harry's back as he vomits up most of what he consumed at the party, then pulls off his shoes, socks and jeans to put him to bed. Harry tries to wrap his legs around Draco and pull him in for something hot and heavy, but Draco admonishes him with a firm, "You're drunk," and goes off into the corner to borrow one of Harry's shirts to sleep in. He doesn't even think about what he's doing until he's got the shirt halfway over his head, filling his nose with Harry's scent, and he pauses for a moment to just really see himself. Wearing Harry's things, sleeping in Harry's bed, taking care of Harry. He loves all of it.
Draco's body aches; that's the next thing he's aware of. He feels out of sync, his body a lead weight that accepts little to no input from his sluggish brain.
"Here we are," Ron says, laying out a hodgepodge of mugs with the same tea Draco had been served at the Burrow. As he pours boiling water from the kettle over each one, he says, gruffly, "Haven't quite got the same knack for kitchen magic as Mum," as if he's embarrassed he has to hold the kettle with his hands.
But she sighs. "The thing is, Draco, you're just not exciting to me. I thought—well, honestly, I thought that if I made a real problem, I'd get
"Oh," Harry says, with a gentle chuckle, and reaches up to push a hand through his thick hair. The right hand, with its scars across the knuckles, and the indelible words from fifth year. "It's—well, it's actually this. At work, I just... It's a charm I cast, but it gets—wobbly, sometimes."
A younger Harry might have asserted Malfoy got what he deserved, then, but Harry as a man knows there's nothing that could make his reckless attack on Malfoy right. "Then I'm sorry, Malfoy. I should have never used that curse on you. I didn't know what it did, but—that doesn't make it alright."
"Naturally," Draco returns, smirking. "Upstairs with you. You haven't left me enough time to lay out your clothes yet."
She brings her hand down. Draco is sent head over heels, leaving a bloody trail across the floor as his side opens up and he wails against his will. His wand hand shakes violently as it comes up again. "Expul—" And again he's knocked back, this time with a fresh wound to his chest.
Potter shakes his head. "Didn't see the point. And now that I look like this, I... I don't know. I asked for you because I didn't want to think about it. I really did think you'd just pull another perfect design out of your arse, I'd make my mandatory appearance, and that would be that."
"You must," he agrees. He's quite sure his outfit is on point, but he turns to her anyway. "How do I look?"
"I think," Granger says, as Weasley returns to the table, "that for all that we miss Harry so very terribly, you're the one who needs to talk to him."
And just like that, Draco knows how the rest of the outfit will look, almost unable to put ink to parchment fast enough. The outer robe, hem trailing three feet behind the croquis' heels, fills in with an embroidered forest scene. Draco hardly cares if Potter sheds the robe early in the evening to keep from dragging its weight around all night, so long as it's seen when he first comes in. A herd of deer weave between the blossoming trees, under a bright full moon; when Potter moves, so too will the deer, their silvery hooves picking their way across metallic bluebells and dark silken soil. On the right front of the robe will be a magnificent stag, the leader of the herd, his massive antlers blooming just as the trees do.
"I need to put bird netting down. You may help me if you like, though I'm sure you'd rather die than work with your hands."
Malfoy could have Disapparated all along, but Harry had been so reliant on walking everywhere these past weeks he'd practically forgotten it was an option. Malfoy had never needed his help getting off the mountain; he'd probably just wanted to derail Harry's day, and Harry had fallen for it.
Wherever Malfoy might be, Harry doesn't see him at the pub that night for supper. He doesn't run into Malfoy anywhere the next day, either, or the day after that, and he supposes that's about right—he went weeks without seeing Malfoy before finding him at the pond, and it took him several days to run into him again in the mountains.
"Here," the orderly says, and Draco realizes with a start it's the same orderly who gave him information on the victims' magic draining. Before he can quite grok what he's doing, he's clutching at her hand, and she looks at him with a mix of alarm and confusion.
The news comes to Draco by way of a hastily penned owl from Narcissa, which includes the time and location of her Portkey arrival, given that she is forbidden Apparation. Ink blots surround her words from the speed at which her quill must have moved, and still her letter has only just beaten the Prophet to the manor's breakfast table.
At first, Draco says nothing, walking a wide circle around the edge of the hospital room. Despite the room's size and other empty beds, there are no other patients housed here. A translucent pouch of clear liquid hangs nearby, and Draco thinks he remembers that it's spelled to release hydration and nutrients within the paired patient's body at intervals. When Pertinger continues to simply watch him, he edges closer.
That stops Draco cold, and he inadvertently jabs Potter again, right in the chest. Potter flinches, but keeps his suddenly intense gaze fixed on Draco's face.
Between Dr. Fiddlewood encouraging him to make plans with Harry, and his own previous words to Harry—
Draco considers, in the two steps it takes to reach Potter, where to start. With any other client, he'd simply start with the chest measurement and move his way down, before coming back up for back and arm measurements. With any other client, he'd also likely take the bare minimum measurements, able to eyeball how a pattern ought to be drafted based on measurements he's seen so many times, with little variable. But Potter is new territory, at least in this regard.
"Draco!" Pansy exclaims, face full of devilish delight. "Are you going to have sex? I'm going to call for Blaise!" And she lifts her wand to her throat, ready to fire off a Sonorus—
Draco draws his bottom lip between his teeth, then hears his mother's voice telling him it's uncouth and releases it. "Right. Of course."
The problem is that Draco as he is now absolutely hates Draco as he was, before he met Harry all over again. Before Harry, before Ron and Hermione accepting him as well, before regular dinners at the Burrow. Molly Weasley giving Draco a bone-crushing hug of induction into the family was transformative. Without them, Draco would have never grown to be the man he's become, worthy of the love of good people.
"You're welcome, you blathering prick," Harry sighs. "Think you can get off the mountain without breaking your delicate neck so I can carry on?"
Draco pulls his satchel into his lap, clicking it open to send a small sheaf of square parchment to his right with a flick of his wand. "Normally, clients have a fairly strong idea of what they want, and I refine it." Quill and inkpot make their exit from the satchel next, floating to Draco's left, and then a tap of Draco's wand turns the satchel into a very modest drafting table fitted over his lap, just large enough to accommodate his sketching supplies. The supplies in question arrange themselves neatly on the tiny table's surface. The maker called it a draftsman's satchel, and it's been one of Draco's favorite investments to date. He looks at Potter expectantly. "So what is it your heart desires, Potter? A three piece robe set? A Muggle tuxedo?" Draco considers Harry's current look. "A tracksuit, perhaps?"
"I know you don't want to see me. I know I'm a manipulative cockroach." Draco keeps his hands up as he takes ever slower steps closer to Harry, walking in a loose spiral toward the bed. "But I need to know how long you've been in here."
Draco owls back that Thursday will work for him, keeping all his theories and jokes firmly to himself. He's got to save them for Pansy, anyway, he's pretty sure she'll laugh at the secret life thing.
"I'm, er." Potter pins the approval form to a side table to sign it, then straightens as he hands the parchment back to Draco. "I'm a bit tired now."
"Mm." Harry's non-reply is hummed into his glass, eyes closed with enjoyment. He lays back slowly under the umbrella, wine glass held loosely at his side so it doesn't tip over.
"I shared a dorm with you," Ron says, leaning forward to pin Harry with such a look of finality that Harry leans back in turn, looking thoroughly flustered. It's clearly a checkmate. Draco thinks he understands from context, especially given the way Hermione seems to have excused herself from the conversation and right into her mug, but oh, he's going to enjoy dragging that one out of Harry later.
"Death throes. You big ninny." Harry makes his way down to Malfoy, holding his hand out with no consideration for Malfoy's previous raving about not wanting unasked-for help. "Come on then."
"Yes," Harry sighs, "but if I'm your guide, and I want to take you to a particular location, then this is the wrong direction."
"What, sleep for a day?" Draco realizes now that the itch he's been feeling is a lock of hair poking him between the eyes, and he starts trying to blow it away from his forehead, mostly in vain. It pokes him in the eye, instead. "I didn't do it on purpose. Take it up with the Sleeping Draught they gave me." He assumes that's what it was, anyway.
"A vest! Not whatever you're thinking," Draco snaps. "Don't be daft." He pulls the robe the rest of the way free of Potter's body, giving him a full view of the other end of those stretch marks he'd seen last time. Potter's chest is soft, with just enough fat he might qualify for a brassiere, thatched with dark hair. His dark brown areolae are actually a bit larger than Draco expected, and it's that thought that alerts him to the fact that he might be staring. Worse, he's being a pervert.
"Don't do our Harry wrong," Ron tells Draco next, in that same put-on deep voice as he'd used earlier.
"I told you, you can't have my mum," Hugo tells Draco before Ron's massive freckled hand covers his son's face, pushing him backward into the house.
"Pansy told me to come out here with my eyes closed to tell you dinner's being served," Ginny calls out. "I thought she was being funny, but I see now I'll have to live with the regret of not heeding her advice for the rest of my days. And that I'll also have to shout at her for very obviously setting me up."
"Everything," Harry promises. They hug again, Ron pounding Harry's back as he visibly resists outright bawling again. (Draco is, again, glad he reinforced the organza robe.)
Harry nods, with only a heartbeat of hesitation. "Yeah." He picks up the shroud, turning it over in his hands—and sets it back down. "Yeah, I'm ready."
Draco stills. "I'm sure I could, given I'm an adult with both hands and eyes and a reasonable sense of coordination between the lot."
"Terry Boot. Ernest Macmillan. Michael Corner. Penelope Clearwater, if that doesn't violate the 'bro code,' or what have you—she courted one of the Weasleys at some point, didn't she?"
"That's rich, coming from Little Lord Fauntleroy himself," Harry says as he toes off his boots and starts unbuttoning his jeans.
the drain. Now she's a bonafide Squib." She presses her fingers to her mouth. "I shouldn't say that."
"Learning to make clothing was the first time I truly felt in control of myself. The first time I didn't feel like a pointy, ugly git, either." Draco should be moving around to Potter's front now, adjusting the fit of the robe's collar, and yet he gives into his natural cowardice and hides behind Potter where he has no more pinning to do. "So—so yes, it's more than just fabric."
Potter hums a little, drumming his fingers on his shins. "You make it easy," he says, and suddenly Draco forgets how to breathe.
"It all fits!" Draco says, pacing Harry's office with the door closed. "The victims aren't just losing their magic suddenly, it's being
"Easy?" Potter asks, but Draco has already nudged Potter's arm up so he can get the measuring tape around his bicep. He moves quickly, holding the tape only long enough to register the number before he whips it away to get the next measurement. It feels strange to handle Potter's living body, even just his arm, but if Draco doesn't look up, Potter's no more than a warm mannequin.
Harry breaks away, but he doesn't let go of Draco, putting his forehead to Draco's. "Good?" he asks, with a breathy grin.
He had, not for the first or last time in his life, pretended that his mother had been calling him, and left the table before Griselda Yaxley could frighten him any further.
"Well, it's our house." Draco doesn't bother correcting himself. It'll always be Harry's house. "Where is Hermione?"
Far harder for Draco to professionally ignore are the swathes of stretch marks that sweep across Potter's upper arms, radiating from his chest through the armholes of his undershirt. They're not fresh, either, pale from having already healed into scar tissue. They echo Potter's famous scar, in a way, but Draco thinks they look more like underwater shadows.
The way Potter rolls his lower lip beneath his teeth tells Draco that was too far, but he's lived his entire life going too far. Draco taps his drafting table with his wand, and it neatly refolds itself back into being a satchel, from which he extracts a Never-Ending measuring tape, as well as the approval form yet again. "If you'll sign this, we can get on with measurements and I can get to work."
Here, the oldest photos, from the place where they met as adults. Each of them had been solo vacationing in Connemara National Park—not far, in fact, from where Draco had finally found Harry. They hadn't meant to run into each other, and Draco remembered what a nasty surprise he'd found it to be, to have Harry bloody Potter ruining his holiday, encountering him again and again in what was supposed to have been the vast wilderness of Connemara. They also hadn't meant to talk to each other; before Harry had disappeared, he and Draco could never agree on who had initiated their first real conversation. They hadn't meant to grow to like each other, isolated from the rest of the wizarding world and everything that might be said about Harry and Draco laughing together after the war.
After another hour and a half of conversation, during which Harry lights the fire pit and Arthur breaks out several packages of Jaffa Cakes, Draco spots Lily hanging about the back door looking both anxious and bored. He tugs on Harry's shirt, and nods in her direction. Harry takes a glance at their daughter, and nods at Draco in turn.
"You only want to hold hands when you want me to agree with you," Pansy says, giving him an accusatory little knife of a look.
"Honestly, I don't know what to do with either of my children," Granger says with a defeated sigh, gesturing at Rose as the girl skips right past her and out into the garden. "Sorry, Harry."
"I just want you to understand." Harry's chair creaks, and then so do the floorboards as Harry crosses the room. The mattress dips beside Draco as Harry sits next to him, still holding the photo album, and Draco leans away. There's that feeling of wanting to die, again, or at least wanting to cease existing. Harry's so close, and he still remembers so vividly what it was to bury himself in Harry's arms, pillow himself against Harry's chest.
There are so many ways Draco could reply. He could be cheeky and ask Potter if he'll be staying for dinner, as well. He could ask if he's meant to eat the pasta; just as cheeky an option, really.
He cooks himself lunch, pores over a tome on the history of curses, eats his lunch leftovers for dinner, and switches to a book on magical theory and spell construction. He lights a fire in the sitting room hearth, struggling to read by its light even as he settles into its warmth. There's a more advanced book, somewhere in the library, that deals with magical cores and their coexistence with the human body, but before Draco can get up to look for it, he's succumbed to the warmth and semi-darkness of the room and the monotony of the words on the page, and fallen asleep.
Instead, Potter reaches down to take a firm grip of Draco's skinny bicep, and yet again, Draco is being Side-Alonged inside Twelve Grimmauld Place.
Ginny excuses herself and Pansy to the bar, though not before hugging Harry one more time. Pansy makes an obscene gesture as the pairs part that only Draco sees, something with a circled hand and her tongue poking the inside of one cheek, and Draco flips her off in return, mouthing a vehement
Draco doesn't wait. Harry's strong body is tensed, rooting him to the floor with rage, but when Draco's fingers close around his wrist he lets himself be taken. Amid a jumble of
"Well, now I don't want to choose them," Potter remarks with arched brows, finally sipping at his whiskey.
“Haven’t got any, won’t trust any you’ve got.” There’s a waver in his voice that reminds Draco of how young Harry’s mind is. This truly is not his seasoned Auror husband—this is a boy running on luck and hard-won experience. “If you’re really Hermione, and you want me to trust you, you’ll sit here until I know you’re not Polyjuiced.” He points at the ground with his wand. “No food, no drink, no spells.”
Draco brandishes his wand. Harry's hand moves from his shoulder to his back, a comforting weight and warmth.
"Well, yeah," Harry says, straightening. The headpiece combined with the robe makes him look a little like a demigod, Draco thinks. "I know you see me as a little more human than that."
"Ron. Hermione." Draco scowls. "I don't know the whole collection, alright? There's a handful of them."
It became known as the Rabid Dog Curse, despite the incantation translating to something else entirely:
"Just let me finish making the tea I should have started as soon as Malfoy walked in," Weasley says. "And I call myself an Englishman."
" he says, quiet under the barrage of cruelty coming from Harry. A silver rabbit leaps from the end of his wand under his cloak, and sits expectantly in front of him. "Go to Ron, or Hermione, whichever you can find first," he tells the rabbit. And then, touching the rabbit's throat, he says, "I've found Harry. My Patronus has the coordinates. Please Apparate as quickly as you can."
box as she appears on the arm of a rather handsome American woman. They're all so happy to see Harry, and that happiness seems to pick away at Harry's fear with each new jubilant call of his name, each thrilled hug. Harry even meets people's recognition of him with a singsong
Draco's crying. He's crying, and he can't stop it as he holds his glowing wand to his chest. Worse, Harry is gathering him up into his arms, the wand pressed between them, and now Draco is sobbing into Harry Potter's shoulder, uncontrollable and loud and uncouth.
"I would rather die," Draco says, straightening just enough to look Harry in the eye. "I would rather
"I've got my cup," Harry says with a shrug, suddenly clutching a mug Draco hadn't seen before; there's a telltale tag on a string hanging from its rim. "That one's for you."
Once again, Draco flings his cape over his shoulders, stepping out of the atelier in aggressively high-waisted trousers and pointed boots with a loud block heel that Potter will definitely hear coming. The tall waistband of the trousers is lightly boned, making sure he won't slouch, and his shirt—with a subtle semi-sheer tonal stripe in the lavender cotton, the only visible color in his ensemble—billows from the top, accented with a matching jabot Draco thinks looks fun. Pansy likes to tell him it's fussy, but he knows if she actually thought that she'd never let him leave the shop.
The orderly at St. Mungo's recognizes him. She remembers that she didn't much care for his apparent experiments with her patient's wellbeing, yes, but she also remembers him as a Ministry employee in some capacity, and she lets him see Pertinger one more time.
"Git," Harry sighs. "I meant here, in Connemara, in all this," Harry waves at the trees around them, "nature. You're completely unprepared and totally out of your element. Oughn't you be in your palace, being waited on hand and foot and pretending to camp out fifty meters from your front door?"
any quip he tries now will come out as a stammering, unfunny mess, and focuses all the harder on his stitching.
"This is a lot of color," Harry murmurs when he emerges from the bath, naked as the day he was born. Draco ignores that fact pointedly; they're on a timetable, here.
"You know what, Malfoy? You're so right. Throw yourself off the nearest cliff for all I care." Harry rolls his eyes again, and sets off for the peak again.
But Potter shakes his head. "Perhaps, but nothing to do with you. I'm aware of the work you've put in. Hermione says you dressed her for an event."
"I believe that's what people said when I first opened my atelier, so forgive me if I don't accept that answer," Draco says, arching his brows. "You'll tell me before the night is through, you'll see." He glances at Ron; bog-standard navy dress robes, like so many other Ministry men.
Harry looks over his shoulder just in time to see Malfoy lose his footing and land right on his arse on a particularly pointy bit of ground. "I told you those boots were no good," he laughs, turning the rest of his body around so he can really get a good chuckle in.
—he decides he, too, must be out of practice at socialization, as he so elegantly put it. He firecalls both Blaise and Pansy at once in the massive kitchen fireplace in the manor. Pansy picks up, her head appearing on one side of the fire.
Harry shouts, a manic hand running through his hair, dangerously close to knocking his headpiece askew. "Me, a-a-and the way I look, fancy clothes or not, and all my, my craziness—me! Go on, Draco, tell me the truth!"
"I know what the public perception is of me," Potter says. He hasn't touched his food yet. "Pigheaded. Holds a grudge." A smirk tugs at one side of Potter's mouth, for a few brief seconds. "Can't talk to the press worth a damn. But I've, erm, had a lot of time to myself. Obviously." Potter gestures to the
"During all hours," Harry corrects. "When I lobbied for you, I made sure it was understood you and I would be working late nights."
"You know, I think I'll see you at the pub tonight," Malfoy replies. He takes a step back, smirking as he clasps his hands behind his back. "Au revoir, Potter." With that, and a resounding crack of displaced air, Malfoy is gone.
"I would like you to take this folder," Potter says, giving the folder another nudge toward Draco, "while I look over your research, if I may."
Draco closes his eyes, thinking of that hug from Molly. He thinks of Ron and Hermione standing in his wedding—no. He thinks of Hermione, wary and tired, holding months-old baby Hugo out to him. He thinks of the warm, fragile weight of Hugo in his hands, Ron's held breath as Draco cradles Hugo to his chest and falls in love with the sensation. That had been the moment when they'd first started to let him in.
"There." Draco snatches the parchment from his drafting table, whipping it around so fiercely to face Potter that it creases in the process. "Will that suit His Majesty?"
"Just a quick check-up—" Larch says, just before the edge of Potter's robe whisks after him into the office and the heavy wooden door slams in Larch's face. "Alright then!"
Maybe the way Potter's shifted his whole body on the sofa to look at him expectantly. Or the sleep deprivation that might also be behind the tremors in his hands. Draco's body is
"Mr. Malfoy," Elda whispers, one Tuesday afternoon. Draco startles, and realizes he's—not dozed off, not quite, but certainly slipped into some sort of fugue state.
"Good, because you look a right mess," Draco says, flicking a bead of sweat off Harry's temple. "You need to shower and get dressed."
"Oh." Malfoy's face is blank for only a moment, before it begins to curl with a devious smirk. "Why, Potter! Do you have a picnic blanket secreted away somewhere already?"
"I knew you had it out for me," Malfoy says, putting a woeful hand to his forehead. "Even now, when we're old and grey, you make an attempt on my life for grudges you can't leave in our sordid, sordid past."
Malfoy tumbles, gasping, to the banks of the pond. "Bastard! You bastard!" he shouts as he sits up, running frantic hands over the length of his body. "You don't just Side-Along someone without fucking telling them, Potter! You egotistical maniac!"
fleur delacour's look is inspired by a few different pieces in this balmain collection: https://tinyurl.com/adjkzrhv
Harry's eyes flick open, regarding Draco lazily. "Of course I did. I didn't make it easy for you, did I?" He chuckles. "You fought so hard to pull me out of my own stupidity that I hated you all over again, in the beginning. And you did it more than once. So yeah, of course you're brave, Draco." Harry's eyes start to slide closed again.
He could never ask Potter to trust him, not in so many words. He knows he has carved himself into an untrustworthy person with his earliest choices, no matter how much he's chipped away as an adult.
It is the ultimate shutdown. There is no combination of words Draco could ever come up with that would make for an adequate response.
he'd been about to say, and he'd only meant it as a joke, really. But it's one of those things Dr. Fiddlewood doesn't like him to say, and he's in no mood for the detour about being kind and gentle with himself. About accurately assessing what it is he does and doesn't deserve based on his humanity, and not the past he regrets. He rubs at the back of his neck, taking in the flowers on the chair again. There are big, garish rhododendrons in with the daisies.
By the time Draco goes to bed, it's usually about two in the morning. Which leaves him about two hours to sleep; three if he's feeling indulgent, but he rarely ever is.
later. "First you liked my new design for you, then you absolutely hated it and threw it at me, then you cooked me a very sexy lunch, after which you confided a bit of childhood trauma to me, and now you're learning I eavesdropped on you so you're going to tell me off for not having changed since school after all and then you're going to, just a guess, tell me to fuck right off and die, preferably outside your home." Draco finds he's dizzy, his mess of a sentence all coming out in one breath. He starts to push himself upright, all the better to go fuck right off and die, and for the sake of his spine, as well. "Did I get all that right?"
"Okay, but you literally took the robe away from me as you're telling me to try it on," Potter points out.
"Ugh!" Malfoy resurfaces with more water pouring from his mouth, his short hair curtained across his eyes. Harry can't stop laughing, barely able to see Malfoy through his crinkled eyes. "Is this what Gryffindors do for fun? Bruise each other?"
Potter likes him. It's more than just tolerating his company for the sake of a job; Potter seeks that company out, finds ways to steal away more of Draco's time. Maybe he's being delusional, considering Potter never
Harry shrugs at his old friend. "It's summer hols, Hermione. Besides, the kids don't like physical media these days, don't you know? She could be reading loads of books, for all you know."
Draco takes Harry's hand, without hesitation. "Happy birthday, Harry," he says, a clear bell ringing across the garden. Harry's friends turn as they hear him, and raise their glasses in a wave, echoing Draco's words.
Draco still has flowers, though. With summer comes the peace lilies and their move to the outdoors, where Draco will keep a passive eye on them like children told to play outside. Such a temperamental plant—but they had been so important for Harry. A tribute to his mother.
Both men are rusty at kissing, but it doesn't matter. Not to Draco, and not to his body, either. His nerves buzz when Harry's much fuller lips press against his, the buzz becoming a deafening roar when those lips part against Draco's pressing tongue. He'd forgotten what it was like, feeling the heat of another mouth, but this is Harry's mouth, Harry's lips and tongue, those are
"Is there?" Ah. There's the danger. Draco had thought he'd climbed out of the particular sandpit that is Pansy's disappointment in him. Ever since their harrowing conversation in which Pansy had casually threatened to take over the atelier as majority owner, Draco had been making an effort to juggle
"Draco, I really didn't hear anyone," Pansy says from the door of the sitting room, and Draco shushes her instantly—the intruder could make another sound while she so noisily offers her opinion.
"Maybe both." Draco gives his hips as much of a roll as they can, trapped beneath Harry. "You'll have more time for this once you're unemployed."
Early into his days of becoming a real couturier, Draco realized two things. One: He'd never be satisfied with standard sewing spells, with their harsh, mechanical stitches and almost no affinity for fine detail. Two: He was getting older, and long hours of stitching by hand led to hands cramps and inflamed knuckle joints. So with Pansy's help, he devised the happy medium of stitching spells. Stitching spells accomplished the physical act of pushing the needle through textiles, but required as much supervision as a Muggle sewing machine, guiding the needle with precise willpower. From simple running stitches to at least fifteen different embroidery stitches, Draco could do it all, and without sacrificing his hands at the altar of fashion.
them. I just want to see her reactions, and then back to the Ministry's darkest cubicle with me. I promise." He can't even look up anymore.
There are plenty of things she already knows, too. She knows about his schoolboy obsession with Potter. She knows what that grew into, even as his family served a man dedicated to killing Potter. His crush on Harry Potter had bloomed into something carnivorous and ugly, and so he had pulled it like a weed, like all the other feelings too tumultuous to keep in the garden of his mind.
For a moment, Harry doesn't move, still staring at where the stairs disappear into the ceiling. Then he sighs. "Alright. Off we go, then." He starts off for the sofa, Draco waddling behind him without disentangling himself from Harry.
The awkward quiet doesn't last, though. Harry agrees he'll let Draco take him to Dr. Fiddlewood's office, though he's not ready to commit to a particular day yet. His backlog, he says, as though he's not out in Wiltshire right now ignoring that backlog in Draco's company. Draco sighs and makes a note to nag Harry about it later, and they fall into easier chatter.
Potter doesn't look entirely convinced, but he's not thanking Draco for his time anymore, either. "You're sure?"
"You did say fashion's rotted your brain," Harry sighs. He pulls Draco closer with an insistent tug at his hands, slides off his headpiece, and leans in to press a kiss to Draco's neck, just below his ear. It sends a jolt straight to Draco's groin, and he gasps.
It's nothing like the eyes Draco saw just a few minutes ago. These are wild and shiny, as furious as they are pleading.
A young man with twisting hands and a buzzing energy greets him at the door that leads to the Auror offices. "You must be Mr. Malfoy?" he says, as if he's unsure.
Bill Weasley turns up, though all Draco can focus on is Fleur Delacour and her dress made by a Parisian rival atelier.
There is no mood. He's a professional. And he's going to take the rest of Potter's measurements now, while he's facing away from him, because he's a professional who takes his clients' comfort seriously, no matter who they are.
Draco sighs. "I mean, yes, I've been hiding something, but I told you myself I would be in early and out late—"
The owl from St. Mungo's arrives two days after the Dendron incident. Confirmation that more victims, surviving only through medical intervention, have lost their magic, in the same draining way as Pertinger had.
Even now, as he takes a careful bite of crumbly pastry, nothing is strange or amiss. The top of his tray is mostly invoices from suppliers for textiles, trims, and findings. There's an invoice from the repair service that fixed the sewing machine that had fired its central mechanism sideways across the room last week, and Draco snorts at the memory. There are client letters, ranging from heartfelt thanks for beautiful garments to annoying requests for major changes on nearly-finished products. Draco will be sure to charge them appropriately for the offense, though he'd never express such sentiment to a client's face. No, his atelier's reputation is more important than that. Still, this is looking like a tea sort of morning. He can already imagine the bergamot scent filling his nose.
"He's—he's hiding something," Potter rambles, eyes darting about the room, no less wide. "Dendron, he's—"
"Umbridge? I always thought she looked more like a toad," Harry says, tapping the part in his unruly hair. "That fussy little bow was like a fly she was about to eat."
All Draco wants, in this moment, is to go to Harry. To wrap his arms around his waist from behind, pillow his head against his shoulder, let him know quietly with his body that he's not alone. He finds compromise in rising from the table to stand just next to Harry, close enough to touch but not touching yet. "You're not ruining my life," he says, almost a whisper.
After that, there's no one topic that holds them for long, meandering from one to the next. Together, Harry and Draco make short work of the whole spread, and Draco does conjure a bottle of Pinot Grigio directly from the manor's wine cellar, because a little cup of tea doesn't quite quench the thirst brought on by a stellar Iberico.
So he does. He takes Potter's hand again, after scooting closer as precisely as he can to keep from mucking up his trousers. As he starts to rub those circles again, he feels just outside his own body, and does his best to gather himself back into his skin.
"Sometimes I think about the stunts I pulled on a broom when I was younger, and I can hear all my joints creak at once," Potter agrees. He holds his arms out at his sides as Draco carefully divests him of the outer robe, making sure the pins stay in place
, but he'd never actually told Harry. "I just—" He sets the mug down. "I said you pull me back together, but it's not that simple, is it? I still lose control. I still hurt people."
"You're my husband." It comes out before Draco can stop himself, and just as he looks at Harry's hands.
right now. Worse, Potter says nothing, and Draco's misfire of a joke hangs between them as they continue to eat, joined only by the sounds of silverware scraping their plates.
He considers just leaving. Yes, he was invited, more or less. Yes, Harry had asked him to please come because he grounded Harry. But Harry looks quite grounded amid his friends and adopted family, and Draco isn't part of that family.
"Alright," Harry laughs, "get back inside before you catch your death of cold. I'm going to work." And he pulls away, starting the walk down the secluded cottage path.
Eight deaths lain at his feet. Eight deaths because of his slow spellwork. Eight families mourning because he's been too afraid and sad to approach Harry, to tell him that whether or not he's a manipulative cockroach, the spell needs finishing
"If you tease me again I'm leaving you here, and you'll have to patch your own clothes up if you tear them." Draco crosses his arms, then his legs, though the narrow skirt of his dress doesn't leave much room for it.
From the lobby, at least, the trip isn't so long. They Floo one after the other to St. Mungo's; by the time Draco has stepped through, the Boy Who Lived Again has already put his celebrity status to work and skipped the bureaucratic nature of St. Mungo's waiting room, led past the desk by an orderly. Draco scurries after them as the orderly takes her first of many turns.
"What—?" Draco whispers, tracing the letters with one finger. The handwriting looks like Harry's, only shakier, less focused.
"You can say I look like I've been peeled off the floor of a pub, I won't immediately start raiding your liquor cabinet," Draco scoffs. His hair is thrown into a loose ponytail, off center with flyaways aplenty, his beard could most charitably be described as shaggy, and his clothes consist of a rumpled, untucked button-down shirt in a pale green viscose, paired with plain black slacks and short black boots. (For all that Pansy told him to keep his nipples to himself, today Draco's failed that imperative at last.) "I'm clean, I'm dressed, I'm here. Shall we?"
There's a very pregnant pause as they look at each other, and Draco swallows around a tight throat, wondering if he's imagining how dark Harry's eyes seem to have gotten. Then again, the room itself is dark, so he must be. Then Harry laughs again.
"Water for you, then, I suppose." Within seconds, a self-propelling Collins glass nearly sloshes water on Draco's parchment, and he snatches it only just in time for the spill to land on his trouser leg, instead.
"Yes. God, yes, fine. I bet you've got the documents drawn up already, haven't you?" Draco has every intention of reading whatever he's meant to sign to within an inch of its paper life, then blasting it with detection charms for good measure. "If that is you, Potter," he adds, for another good measure.
Narcissa doesn't stay the night. Just being in the manor, for her, is like being riddled with tiny daggers that grow in number with every corner she turns. That's what she says, in her melodramatic way. "But oh," she says, tapping at a door with her wand. "I've left all these doors locked. I'm sorry, Draco." The door she touched swings open just an inch. "I'll—"
"Thank you," he whispers, and is on his feet and exiting within seconds. Draco stays in the mystery room for a while longer, finding that now he, too, needs to reconnect with his corporeal form.
Pansy slams Draco's office door shut before he can finish his outburst. However much Potter made him blush today, it is nothing in comparison to the searing heat that rips through Draco's face now, spreading instantly to his ears, neck, and chest.
His head bumps each step as he's dragged down stairs. Downstairs. Into the basement with the blood stained floor. His attacker doesn't seem to be in any kind of hurry, so at least each thump of the back of his head is slow, less painful than it could be—the only positive he can find in this moment.
It doesn't land, though. Potter's tiny smile fades, replaced with an exhaustion that seems to wash over him until he's underwater. "I'm sorry. I'll go." And he begins to turn.
"I know what pride gets you," Draco goes on, heedless of the warning tone in Potter's low voice. "And that's
Potter is the only person in the interrogation room with Dendron. He takes a seat with his back to the glass, shifted over just enough to give Draco a clear view of Dendron if he stands to one side of the window. Williamson stands beside Draco, arms crossed over his chest.
Harry finally pulls his hand from the kettle, and lights the fire beneath it with a wave of his hand. "A while." And then, "Five years."
"You ask as if I have any experience with this event." Draco hasn't seen one flashbulb go off yet, which he expected at the entrance. "What do you think, Harry? Have you got the lay of the land?"
"For fuck's sake, Harry, at least call me by my name while you're rejecting me!" Draco spits, before whipping around to hide his face from Harry. He doesn't
"I hired you to design an outfit. You're the most celebrated designer in wizarding Britain," Potter says, flinging his hand out as if gesturing to wizarding Britain itself. "So design something."
"Oh, sod off," Draco mutters, attributing the flush he can feel on his face to the general heat of the kitchen. He does as he was silently asked and goes to set the table.
"No, you couldn't have. It wasn't the right spell you were trying to use. You were trying to mend a broken bone that you didn't have." Harry shades a flat hand over his brow, scanning the way ahead.
It took twenty four hours, and all four patients woke on their own, heaving themselves from their hospital beds and out of their rooms. They wrenched wands from their waiting loved ones, and all through the corridors of St. Mungo's, the words
"I don't think that's how Unplottability works," Draco snorts. As he listens to Potter clunk down the stairs, though, the strangeness of being interrupted by a Muggle delivery person subsides, leaving Draco with the sobering facts again. Potter didn't just hate his latest design, he thought it was
He doesn't know how to approach the owl currently hopping about the stonework, though, and honestly, he doesn't want to. He calls for Archimedes, his much statelier barn owl, who not only accepts the letter to the Granger-Weasleys, but who also seems to herd the miniature owl out with him.
"Touché," Blaise snorts. "But what I'm up to hasn't got to do with my dead husband. It's been a year, Draco."
"You've missed my cleaning," Draco retorts, with an attempt at a tiny smile that falls within seconds. "This place is a disaster."
There's just something about Potter that makes him act out. If he were alone, he'd knock his head to the wall a few times.
There is no sex. Draco's fantasized about it, there's no mistake about that, but if he's resolving to enjoy Harry, then he's going to savor things. "You have work in the morning," he says as he adjusts his robes, and flicks his half-lidded gaze over to Harry to let his words be transparent.
"That's not helpful," Harry snaps, choosing and pulling on a different T-shirt. Draco pretends he's not eyeing Harry up every time he changes his mind about what shirt to wear, but also they all look the same to him.
"On the table by the stairs." No reply to Draco's challenge to the shimmer's identity, which he doesn't like. "There's a pen."
Draco turns to see that Harry's laid out a blanket, the sea of gold parted in a neat square to accommodate it. There's a massive open umbrella laying on its side in the blanket's center, like the sort of umbrellas people take to the shore, providing extra shade. And Harry's laying out plates on the other end of it.
"I have to ask, again," Harry says, shifting from foot to foot as he tries not to laugh any harder, "have you been staying here for an entire month so far with nothing but a guided tour, an interrupted swim, and a failed attempt at hiking under your belt? Have you just been sitting in your cottage for weeks?"
The Manor is still in the family, because Narcissa refuses to sell it, no matter how regularly Draco once badgered her to do it. He stopped once her rebuttal de rigeur became badgering him, in turn, for grandchildren. He doesn't like the idea of her banging about the old place all on her own, he'll say; she wouldn't be alone if she had some grandchildren to entertain, she'll fire back.
"I don't know why you're looking at me like that," Malfoy scowls. He's wearing shorts hemmed to mid-thigh, his skinny legs blindingly white, all the more reflective for the dusting of platinum blond hair that runs the length of them. Everything else Malfoy is wearing—a short-sleeve button-down shirt, his same boots with transfigured barely-there treads, a hat that looks like a pith helmet's second cousin—is somehow still second to the spectacle of his shorts and bared legs.
Potter kneels on the rug of a sparsely-decorated room, facing away from the door with both hands on the back of his shorn head. He rocks gently in place, which does little to alleviate the way his staccato breaths sound like he's drawing them in through thick fabric.
Pansy lunges forward, gripping the arms of Draco's chair, and he can feel his arse slipping off the edge as he sinks lower under her towering presence. "And now, after an unapproved client request, after off-premise faffing about, after an
"No one's ever really helped me through these—these episodes, before," Potter murmurs as Draco works, or whatever it is he's doing.
Blaise whispers something to Pansy, low enough that Draco doesn't make it out in his focused state. "We'll be here," Blaise says, and the pair of them withdraw. Draco shakes his head as if to reset himself, and steals down the long corridor and around the corner.
Draco picks up his quill, dips it gently into ink, and sets it to parchment to finalize the details of his Luna moth design.
It's as fair a question as any, and Draco has no solid answer. There's just something that's been trying to jump out at him from all the data he's seen so far, but he can't put words to it yet. "I have a feeling," he says, nearly wincing as he says it. A child's reason.
"Not naked, were you?" Malfoy says, and he strides off, chuckling darkly all the way back to his clothes, where he folds his clothes around the camera.
"It's my vision. I have to do it," Draco says, as he slides the first ring onto one of Harry's fingers. He has to hold Harry's hand to do it, and he feels so silly for how intimate it feels. "What's your obsession with public Muggle figures tonight? Are you the Queen or the Pope?"
That gets Draco a sharp look from Harry, but it subsides quickly. "I just don't want people to make that connection, is all. Cooking isn't that for me. The weight came on when I first started staying in and I didn't know how to take care of myself, and once I did start taking care, only a bit of it came off, and... Honestly, I didn't care to try and lose the rest of it." He shrugs deeply, as though he wants to hide between his shoulders.
"Ginny knows where I am. We've plenty of time to stick tongues in plenty of places before the night is over." Pansy's heels click as they approach, and the tulle of her skirt overlaps Draco's legs as she sits beside him.
He's kidding. He's heckling Potter because it finally feels safe to do so. But Potter, Potter who had only moments ago referenced Draco's awful past in order to call him a prick—he nods, eyes darting anywhere but Draco's face as he scratches the side of his face with a sheepish finger.
Which is why it's a bit confusing when he realizes he's wandered over to his drafting table, instead.
"This way, it's your choice," Draco says, not waiting for whatever it is Potter looks like he wants to say. He holds out the tulle. "Be seen when you want to be seen. Hide when you want to hide, come out again when you're ready."
It takes him another twenty minutes to find the Burrow, a towering, haphazard building on the edge of town. It takes him another ten minutes after that to find his courage and knock on the bloody door.
This is a nervous outfit. He knows it, as he knocks on Potter's door, but he can't imagine Potter will notice. He
"I think you already know the answer," Draco says, glancing around. "I keep running into people who are asking me if I remember meeting them when I was six months old."
Draco spends the rest of the night pretending he's not waiting for Archimedes' return, reading the same page in a book on the history of Dark Magic in fourth century China that was so interesting when he purchased it a year ago, and fixing himself a dinner that he both undersalts and burns in his distraction. When Archimedes does come back, Draco throws his hands up to say, "Oh, thank Salazar," and is on his feet in seconds to let the owl in.
"If you're so convinced this measuring tape is my weapon of choice," Draco says, with a shrug that fails abysmally at being casual. Oh, it would have been
"Are you sorry for calling Hermione a Mudblood? Are you sorry for tormenting Ron for not having as much money as you? Are you sorry for slandering me? For attacking me? For leaving me injured, immobilized and invisible on a train with no one on it?"
"You put the barest approximation of treads on your boots," Harry says as he grips Malfoy by the forearm and pulls him up. "Of course they've got no grip."
"You don't need to tell him that last part, Harry should already know I'm always right," Granger snickers, before sobering again. "Please, Malfoy. Draco. Go to Harry. At least to finish the spell; then perhaps you'll have a way in for us."
He signs his name to pay her the owed 30 Galleons; Gringotts has made some forward progress since his father's time of heavy sacks of gold needing to be carried and passed around. He agrees to his next appointment in two weeks, same time and day as ever, and makes his exit.
He does his best to be methodical again in his next measurements. Side seam, armhole to waist. Side seam, waist to hip. Center front, from Potter's collarbone to his waist. Chest, waist, hip again, measured simply from side seam to center front. All of those a second time, this to center back. He might be missing something, but his brain feels fuzzy. He fumbles for his wand, casts a small Cushioning Charm, and kneels on it in front of Potter because his knees are too old to touch the hard floor. Side seam, waist to floor. Draco moves toward the next measurement he'd naturally take, and—oh no.
"An apology would be a wonderful start." The harshness that accompanies the words hurts, but it's better than her unfriendly calm.
"Hermione says you're dehydrated and need to eat." Harry points at the nightstand, where Draco now sees there's a glass of water and a lopsided sandwich that looks like Harry made it.
The pub is open late into the night, which is all very good for Harry because he's starving when he finally returns from his second attempt at scaling the mountain. By the time he reached the peak it was too dark to much appreciate the view, and he took a page out of Malfoy's stupid book to Apparate to the foot, the better to grumble about how Malfoy must have been planning to ruin his day.
project. Potter's hands brush against Draco's as they trace the beads, a glass fawn pausing to investigate his fingertips.
"A rabbit Patronus?" he snorts. "That tracks. A creature that runs and hides at the slightest hint of danger."
"Well," Draco says carefully, "you did say you like to make friends quickly. So how about Thursday?"
He stops just as he closes the door behind him, eyes darting around the room before settling on Harry Potter. "Please," Potter says, gesturing with one hand before clasping it with the other again. "Sit."
"I say it's pertinent to the case," Draco says, sitting up straighter. "If you're happy to be helpful, fetch it for me."
"Harry," he says, plunging ahead before his rational self can intervene. "Did you mean it when you said you thought I was brave?"
Harry's heart seizes, and if he thought he could hear his heartbeat before, it's nothing compared to the rolling thunder in his ears now.
"Considering a divorce, that's what," Hermione says, patting her hair and smoothing her dress. It's a very pretty gown, a diaphanous thing made of multiple shades of lavender tulle that makes her dark skin glow, and finished with tulle roses at the hem and cuffs. He doesn't think he's ever seen Hermione in a neckline so daring, and he makes a mental note should he ever dress her again. Her hair is laid flat to her head with complex braids woven with silver that matches her jewelry, ending in a cloud-like Afro-puff at the back of her head.
But it seems to satisfy her, somehow. The session finishes out with her usual check ins on his breathing exercises and mindfulness, at which he certainly could do better. She asks if he's had any panic attacks, dissociative episodes. He'd felt detached the whole funeral, but certainly still both feet on the ground—no dissociation, no. An improvement since three months ago, when he'd begun therapy.
"The Legilimency healing, he means," Hermione clarifies. "His five days with Harry have finished, and as far as the Healers and Harry himself can tell us, it was a success!"
Draco shifts, folding his arms and resting them on the table as he glances down the lonely length of the table. "I thought you didn't want to be seen. I thought you wanted to..." He rolls his bottom lip between his teeth, considering his wording for once, but he shakes his head.
"I'm surprised Granger hasn't done something about all this muck before, to be honest," Draco says, as a way of keeping a lid on himself. Not that it's much better, he supposes, than telling Harry not to act like a farm animal.
"It's not even—" Draco checks his pocket watch. "It's only barely after noon. And it won't take longer than a few minutes."
Well, actually, maybe it's just messy, Draco amends as he ventures deeper inside. Harry's home is warm because it's his, and because he's re-painted the walls in pleasing shades of gold, the big Gryffindor, but his home is chaotic past the entryway. It goes beyond "lived in," and as Harry leads Draco in, he seems to realize this.
Harry looks at Malfoy, at his high forehead, his pointed chin, his thin, pale lips. "No." Because a cruel spirit was and is the ugliest thing, to Harry.
Draco calls over Pansy and Blaise to take his mind off it, because he must. And Greg, too, because nothing will keep him from erotic thoughts quite like listening to Greg talk about his new passion, which is beer and the brewing of it. Bless his friends and their annoying approach to hobbies.
"I just like to enrich myself, even when the enrichment is foul Muggle stories that are apparently misremembered by the general Muggle public." Malfoy dips his head beneath the water's surface, and comes up with his hair dark and plastered to his high, rounded forehead that constitutes so much of his face's real estate. Harry snorts at his own observation.
"Thank you." Harry's voice is still tight, even as confused faces in the crowd begin to turn away from the shroud's aura of forgetfulness and distractibility. Draco Malfoy is not quite as interesting as whatever they
Harry reaches out in an instant, his fingers wrapping around Malfoy's wrist beneath the surface, holding him in place. He can hear his blood in his ears, hear his wildly thumping heart. He doesn't know what he thinks he's doing, but—
"If you blot all those details out, this silhouette is as basic as basic gets. And the Mandarin collar with dragons and a—why did you do this?" she asks, poking the asymmetrical closure and all its golden buttons. "Is he supposed to be a general in a fantasy Chinese army?"
"Because I don't know if you've noticed," Draco says, waving at his surroundings, "but you've been going through this whole ordeal like you've been sent off to die in war." He instantly knows how poor his choice of words were, but there's no time to self-flagellate over it. "And this is the part where I need you to stand with your knees apart so I can get your inseam. And your front rise," Draco adds, in case Potter thinks it'll be over too quickly, "and your back rise."
"I already know you don't need it. You can Apparate anywhere you like, including right back here once you've inevitably fallen into a bog with no other escape."
"R-right," Potter says as he stands upright again, his arms festooned with cheap plastic bags. "I mean, thanks." He kicks the front door shut, then heads for one of the many other doors at the far end of the hall.
like this with clients. He wants to blame Potter for being such a little baby about clothing, but it's always been too easy for him to want to blame Potter. If anyone is a little baby, it's Draco for not having outgrown this particular tendency.
"Well, I don't even know if you like this yet," Draco says, picking at the organza with two pinching fingers. "The other one is the one you approved, and this is the one I
He begins by going upstairs. It's not that he's ceased going into the master bedroom altogether—after all, he hasn't moved his wardrobe downstairs—but retrieving clothes are about the only thing he's gone into the room for, keeping his eyes down as he walks. He pretends, as he enters the room this time, that he is not surrounded by his husband's memory's ghosts, and gets to his knees to pull a large, bedraggled white box out from under the bed. He grabs framed photos from the bedside table and the dresser in quick succession, and hurries back to the safety of downstairs. He collects other pictures from around the house, and brings it all to the kitchen table where the blank photo album and Spellotape are waiting for him.
"Please, Harry," Draco pleads, in spite of Harry's previous reaction to his first name. "I need you to come home." He can't cry, but he is anyway, tears burning his eyes as he reaches for Harry's left hand.
Draco drops low in an instant. Years of wandlessness has made him cautious. He has some talent for wandless magic, but with a Trace like his mother's on him as well, it's never been worth keeping it up. He keeps his eyes wide, watching the figure from between the tiny yellow petals and their much larger leaves.
"Bloke like Draco looks like he needs a bit of doing wrong," Ron says, leaving Draco absolutely baffled and Hermione putting her face in her hand.
Draco has no retort for that. He wills himself not to be defensive with Dr. Fiddlewood, given he hardly pays her 30 Galleons a fortnight to rebuff her suggestions and keep secrets from her.
"No!" she gasps, with just the right amount of drama as she presses a hand to her collarbone. "I thought he hadn't been seen in years?"
thank you to everyone who's read, kudos'd, and commented so far; i've been having such a good time writing this fic and re-exploring third person, and it wouldn't be that without the readers who've enjoyed it this whole time. the whole of the fic is now taking shape and i believe i know how the rest of it will go, and how it will all end, BUT!! comments and input from readers have swayed me before so if you have thoughts, theories, what have you, fire away in the comments. just saying 👀
"I know he is," Hermione says with exasperation, accepting a cup from Ron and immediately stirring it with nervous little clinks of the spoon that was on the saucer. "He's also not letting his brain leak out of his ears staring at a little screen all day."
"I can't, Hermione. Just take him to the Burrow, let Ron and Molly go berserk without all the dour husband talk." He makes an attempt at a wan smile. "You'll know exactly where to find me."
Malfoy pauses, looking at Harry with a frowning consideration, mouth open mid-complaint. He shuts his mouth firmly, and says, "No." Then he looks at the pond, the shimmering surface of it. "Seems like I never have a choice when it comes to you and this puddle. Either you're driving me out or dragging me in."
He tells himself, as he leaps from rock to rock in a valley, that it's for the best; one night of heavy drinking does not a friend make, nor does it make Malfoy a good person. He reminds himself, looking up at the endless sky over the grasslands, that he already has friends, waiting for him outside of his vacation bubble. Whatever connection he made with Malfoy is irrelevant. Unnecessary. And not just because he thought about kissing Malfoy.
"You'll never get Harry," Draco growls, not because of anything he knows, but because he wants her to feel unsuccessful. It's all he has.
Harry and Draco spring apart, Draco flinging himself to the far end of the bench so quickly he nearly falls to the ground, instead. Harry clears his throat as he bends to pick up his fallen headpiece, while Draco straightens the front of his dress and thinks of Walburga Black.
But Harry's eyes are cold, and he takes a step back, away from the bench and closer to the door. "I don't owe you my feelings, Malfoy."
"Me, because I don't look like a styleless lummox," Malfoy says, without a second thought. "And I'm a wizard who knows healing charms, so there."
, not because I planned to be goggled at by my client." Draco takes his needle in hand again, and begins stitching down another pearl. "I dream of your food while I eat my gruel and stale bread crusts, alone in my flat." He glances up for a moment. "That sounds like a joke, but my own cooking is only one step up from gruel, seeing as I was raised to be a pompous little prince, waited on hand and foot."
"Well," Weasley says, as he retakes his seat, "stranger things have happened, I suppose. Have at it, then, Malfoy."
"Oh, who do you bet on, then? Those blasted Chudley Cannons your blessed Weasley loves so much, I'll wager."
With Draco trailing half a pace behind him, Harry manages to find his old friends in twos and threes, and when he hears the first whispers of recognition around them, Draco makes a flimsy excuse and tears him away to find the next.
"No! No. No, I mean—" Harry slaps his hand over the whole of his face, dragging it down and setting his glasses askew. "Third year. Straight into fourth year. God, I thought he was fit."
"Well, what I tried to say, anyway," she says, with a contrite smile. "I saw you looking at me at dinner like I was the wolf to your sheep. I'm not going to kill you." And then, with a thoughtful upward glance, "Not for any old reasons, anyway. Don't give me any new ones."
Can he be Harry now all the time, not just when Draco is alone with his embarrassing fantasies? Does Harry—does he
"I don't know, I think I'm clever enough," Harry replies with a shrug and an easy grin. He holds out one curled hand. "I managed to bag the most talented couturier in Britain as my date to the biggest event of the year, didn't I? Takes a bit of cleverness, I think."
"Oh. Kreacher passed a few years ago," Harry says, turning his tea cup this way and that on the saucer. "He was already very old when I inherited him."
"Harry Potter won't find you, but maybe I'll keep your body in stasis for a little while," Griselda hisses through her awful grin, "and bring it to him so I can show him all the ribbons I cut you into, before I kill him too! A lovers' reunion!" She throws her head back, her laugh feral and loud, a hyena before it makes its kill.
If he's right, then the curse has a life of its own within the cursed victim. Not just a victim anymore—a
Today, he's got to ask Pansy to make the headpiece for Harry's third and final ensemble. Which means he also has to reveal said ensemble, and come clean about his double life working in both the atelier and in his flat. On his knees, if he has to, and there's a high likelihood.
"Is that what you were hoping for?" Harry quips, but it's good-natured as he finally reveals what he's brought. A long, narrow wooden box.
Unfortunately, his theory has nothing to do with the source of the curse—not yet, anyway. It's ultimately a small piece of the puzzle, more to do with the curse's function than anything else. His entire next week—dutifully glued to his desk, as per Potter's instructions—is spent scribbling stream-of-consciousness notes on what his new findings mean, and how
Nine months. He takes Dreamless Sleep to force himself to get rest. He doesn't find anything to say when his friends visit anymore.
that is Potter's inner thighs, just barely pulled apart from each other. Draco thinks his hand is melting a little as he holds the end of the measuring tape to the point where all four seams meet in Potter's boxers, pulling the tape down to the floor.
Yet Harry saw the breadth of their love in those photos. He saw his own happiness, as well as Draco's. He heard their stories in Draco's trembling voice. And he made his decision.
"At first, I thought I would just get away for a bit. Just a bit," Harry says, with a rueful twitch of the corners of his mouth. "From the press. The, the pressure. The expectations, the demands. Being called, erm, a diva. For not liking the attention." He glances Draco's way, but doesn't hold his gaze for longer than a few seconds. "It was when I saw those photos from my birthday party that I just—I couldn't take it anymore."
"I'm a lout," Harry replies, just as quietly. "Don't know anything except how to cast Expelliarmus, remember?"
"Please, we're not teenagers. I don't care if you drink." Malfoy rolls his eyes with his whole head this time, proving he's at least closer to drunk than to sober. "Go on, show me up. Take a drink from this godforsaken thing."
The silence that follows feels like the pressure of the deepest oceans, pressing on Draco harder with every passing second.
A knock at his cottage door interrupts Harry in yet another one of these loops of overthinking the very idea of Malfoy, and he goes as hot in the face as if he'd been caught wanking under the sheets. He leaps from his seat at the tiny kitchen table, and clears his throat. "Yes, er—who is it?"
His eyes flick up to meet hers. She's promised him again and again she's no great shakes at Legilimency, even if it wasn't a massive violation of her clients' trust and autonomy. Dr. Fiddlewood just
"You're being dense, and I can't even tell if it's on purpose," Hermione grumbles. "You think the thought of seeing Ron again was what brought Harry out to the Gala? Surely not."
"—with all your weird, ostentatious Malfoy shit. I'm not you! I don't dress like this! And what's more—"
The news is finally broken. Harry Potter is presumed dead, after a hushed-up disappearance, and the fact that it breaks via the front page of the Daily Prophet means that Draco can't refuse to mourn in peace. Although the masses are held back fifty solid meters from the funeral, he can still feel their eyes on his back, still makes him feel as though he might as well be burying the casket right in the middle of a public thoroughfare.
His attacker finally stops. The same hands that were dragging him sits him up neatly against a wall, arms at his sides, feet together. The same voice that blinded him whispers, and suddenly his eyes are full of daggers as light re-enters them. He squeezes his eyelids, and the voice laughs.
"Draco," she says, just barely audible over the crash of the surf behind them as she puts firm fingers to his jaw to make him look at her. "I know this can't be easy for you."
A year. A year since Harry's departure, since he kissed Draco on the threshold of their little blue cottage and promised he'd be careful. The Ministry finally admits they've had no contact from Auror Potter in the past eight months.
Harry's body tenses against Draco's, his fingers digging into Draco's side. Draco pries those fingers away, but when Harry gives him a betrayed look, Draco only slips his hand into Harry's with a firm grip. Hermione's eyes zero in on it, and she meets Draco's eyes with such a smug expression he can only glare in return.
Hermione's mouth opens soundlessly, then shuts. "Well," she tries again, "I don't think it's good for her eyes!"
The pain of the Cruciatus curse hasn't been familiar in a long time, and yet Draco remembers it vividly as it floods his body. Every time he was punished for being a failure as a Death Eater, or every time he was a stress reliever for Voldemort or any of his followers looking for a terrible outlet, all of them pale in comparison to the sheer magnitude of Griselda's Crucio. He can't even hear himself screaming anymore.
"Well, that last one might be true." Draco leads Harry to the sofa, lit almost entirely by the fireplace. "But my hard work will not go to waste so long as you, the client, enjoys it."
Draco finds Harry, at last, in one of the upstairs bedrooms. The curtains are pulled shut and no lamps are lit, but when Draco throws open the door, the light from the landing paints a bright yellow stripe across the bed within, where Harry's huddled form lies with his back to the door.
"I see." Malfoy's sudden reticence is so laden with—oh, Harry's too drunk to properly identify the emotion, but it's not fun, and he's too drunk for that, too. He looks at Malfoy again.
"I hardly know what that is. A boat? I can't imagine why I'd want to spend my holiday stuck on a boat. Really, Potter." Malfoy eyes the distance between the top of the boulder and the ground below it.
"It's not the same, Harry." Draco rests his cheek against Harry's curls, sighing. "Come on, let her be. We can watch a bit of telly before bed."
Draco begins to count Potter through his breaths, steady beats up to the number seven before counting back down to zero. "You're okay," he reassures Potter through numb, disembodied lips. "You're okay."
Harry, but also because the strawberries look ripe and the petit fours look like something someone might feed their lover by hand.
"But I did." Draco gathers up one of the piles of clothes and presses the bundle into Harry's arms. "Would you put these away?"
A photo of the day they moved into their cottage, standing proudly together on the threshold with their arms slung about each other's shoulders, Harry beaming as Draco kisses the side of his head. Molly had taken this photo.
It takes three hours, during which Draco’s legs and hips fall asleep over and over no matter how he sits on the uncomfortable, rocky ground, before Harry finally agrees that Hermione is Hermione. He doesn’t seem to have the same concern for Draco’s identity, presumably because trust was never at stake there.
. His break from the embroidery, on one occasion, is to cut pattern pieces from his completed yardage of golden linen, squeezing his leaden eyelids shut between pieces. That's about when he realizes he forgot to acquire lining for the inner robe, because the atelier has such a well-stocked selection of lining-appropriate fabrics that he can't remember the last time he had to think about lining. He'll have to sneak some out of the atelier.
"Tell me how you're going to make it up to me, business partner," she says, her laughter tapering off as she smirks at him.
Potter turns around so quickly he almost hits Draco with his shoulder. Draco quite literally bites his tongue to keep from saying some awful faux-flirtatious thing, as he might to Pansy or any of his other friends, but he can't keep the surprise off his face.
"You'll get your godforsaken money! You won't even have to come into the office anymore!" Harry holds his hand aloft again. "
"Not all of us weigh about as much as a sparrow," she says, pushing at his shoulder. "And I like wearing heels out and about. Don't change the subject."
Draco starts pasting photos in, scribbling around them with a self-inking quill as he goes to note dates, places, commentary on how the weather had been scorching or how Harry had just bought this particular shirt only to sacrifice it to his inability to eat neatly at an Italian restaurant. Draco peppers in, whenever he really feels it, how proud he is of Harry, and of their relationship, and how in love he is. And because he feels it near-constantly, even with Harry's recent rejection, he writes it all over the photo album.
His name spoken into the silence makes Draco jump, his heart thumping even after he berates himself for being so high-strung.
"I suppose if you want to go home I'd better pack up," Draco says, already beginning the process of tidying his bevy of parchments into a neat pile that might, with some effort, fit into his satchel.
Potter's silence in return makes Draco's face burn as he plays back his own words in his head. His chewing sounds so
"Then I'd be touched you cared enough to not want to," Draco says. "Don't I deserve a bit of life-ruining, anyhow?"
"I am, but I'm not upset because you behaved like someone who'd just lost his father," Blaise snorts. He seems to regard his wine, then puts the glass on the table to trade it for a madeleine that he does not bite. "Draco, did you know I've started dating again?"
"There'll be a big dinner at the Burrow at the end of this week," Harry adds, looking the most contrite he has since arriving to Draco's garden. "Goodbye."
The death of a prominent and documented Death Eater is front page news, and true to the Prophet's history the article borders on salacious. Draco doesn't even mean to read it at first as he picks over his toast and eggs; the Prophet's purpose in the Malfoy home is mainly to line the floors of the owlery, though Archimedes is its only permanent resident. He tells himself, as he scans the page, that he's only reading it to have a dark chuckle at the media portrayal of his father.
"Well, you know Malfoy men," Draco says, gesturing toward the manor where his father's body waits. "Bastards, all of us."
Pertinger's personnel file paints a woman at the top of her game. Clever and shrewd, with a high solve rate; she's noted for casting particularly forceful hexes, with someone writing that her
Dr. Fiddlewood wouldn't want him to say he isn't. She would want him to agree with Harry. "I don't know," he says, splitting it down the middle.
Draco snorts, pawing Harry's face away with his better hand. "Incorrigible. Absolutely horrible. Don't kiss me anymore." Harry laughs, just for a moment, kissing Draco's hand as it bats at him instead. And then—
under that. Everyone close enough at the Gala will see them, with only mesh and thin gauze between them and the world.
"In here," the orderly says, standing five feet from the door at which she's gesturing. "Do you want me to wait for you?"
much easier to get Potter's chest and waist measurements before Potter turned around. He wishes he'd lied.
"Well, cheers to being tired," Harry says, picking up his gross lager and holding it up. Malfoy blinks with surprise, then raises his wine glass to clink delicately against the brute of a glass in Harry's hand.
"Are you embarrassed by me?" Harry asks. His voice is thick, the corners of his mouth tugging down and trembling. "To be seen with me?"
"Hey!" Draco pushes himself up on his arms, glaring at Harry. "Does no one care I'm an invalid? Stop jostling me around!"
"How would you remember someone too young to have ever attended at the same time as you?" Blaise snorts. "Nobody believes you're in your twenties, Pansy."
right. Draco is kissed out, lips swollen and buzzing, body thrumming with arousal, and it's the afternoon.
As it turns out, Quidditch was the right answer for light conversation, because somehow by the time Harry's finished his stew and lager and successfully ordered a stout to follow it all, neither man is finished talking about the game. On Harry's third pint, they've shifted to talking about Hogwarts Quidditch; Hufflepuff has been dominating all year, much to everyone's surprise; Slytherin and Gryffindor, in fact, seem to be battling it out for last place, much to both their chagrin.
"Suppose it will be," Harry agrees, checking regardless before opening the door. Ron and Hermione are on the other side when Harry throws the door open, arms already wide to give Harry the hugs he's due. Harry is a nervous host, despite his first guests being objectively the easiest of the lot. He shows them too much of the ground floor before letting them into the garden, and Hermione saves Draco the trouble by being the one to tell Harry to calm down. Draco is glad, not for the first time, that they agreed to ask everyone to leave their children at home. Harry is barely ready for adults who love him—teenagers who hardly remember him are beyond him.
to prod or pry. "All these failed hobbies, then, and none of them stuck? Is your new hobby watching me?"
Auror Larch—the young man Draco had thought to be a secretary—arrives in the doorway as if Summoned, and Draco scoops up the Ministry folder with a barely-concealed huff. He knows better than to press the issue; it may be a full fifty years after the way before he feels comfortable throwing his negligible weight around. He still can't stand it.
Draco looks at Harry, tender and peaceful under the bedclothes he's kicked into a twisted mess. Harry would want to go with him. Is supposed to go with him. He's not just the savior of the wizarding world, he's Head Auror, and one of the most powerful wizards alive, besides.
"You can't see them," she says quickly. Draco is getting used to being denied by this point, which is frightening to consider. But he doesn't need to see them.
"You're disgusting," Blaise murmurs as he sidles up to Draco, swirling the wine in his glass with an elegant gesture. "Stop looking so soppy where people can see you, or I'll simply have to pour this down your front."
Draco elects to keep his tea opinions to himself as he smells the cheap mixed black tea wafting from the cup Weasley offers him. When he shudders at the taste of it, he mumbles something about being cold, despite the late spring weather outside.
"And, er, I thought I might also introduce you to Draco," Harry continues, to which Ron and Hermione both frown.
Twelve Grimmauld Place is nothing like he remembers it, and of course it isn't. Harry wouldn't hold with troll leg umbrella stands, mounted house elf heads, or any of the other Pureblood trappings his Great Aunt Walburga had so proudly displayed. Harry's version of the Black family home is warm, and somehow invitingly messy, nothing like the office he keeps at the Ministry.
Draco sighs, and walks over to where Harry's standing, six feet away. "If you're not ready, Harry, then you're not ready. We can go. There's a little cafe round the corner I like, and I want to see if noted hermit Head Auror Potter has ever been."
Draco fiddles with his wand in his lap, and Molly pulls it away from him with delicate fingers to set it on the coffee table. "It hurts worse, this way," he mumbles, and she rubs his back.
It gets easier with every new acquaintance they find. Neville Longbottom's married Hannah Abbott and is, by Hannah's telling, the favorite professor of many a Hogwarts student. Luna reappears, a man neither of them recognize trailing behind her; Luna says she "forgot to mention" she has twin boys, headed for their first year at Hogwarts in the fall.
It's that realization that pushes him the rest of the way awake, because he has no memory of climbing the stairs, much less into his marriage bed. The bedroom is full of light from curtains that have been pulled back, there are murmuring voices coming from downstairs, and most alarmingly of all, Harry is sitting in the far corner, on the chair where he used to pile his clean laundry rather than fold it in a timely manner.
"I'm not, though!" Frustration turns his volume up, and he takes another deep breath, trying to swallow that feeling. "I'm not. I—"
He wants to walk up behind a busy Harry, take advantage of his extra few inches of height to put his chin on Harry's shoulder, pillow himself against that broad back. He wants Harry to turn and smile at the sight of Draco, open his arms to him. He wants to be enveloped in those arms, feel the softness of Harry's front at the same time as the muscle in his biceps. (Draco knows it's there—he's felt enough of Harry's body today to really fuel these impossible fantasies.) He wants—
Harry is gratified, at least, by Malfoy's stunned expression as he looks at the swim trunks. "You just—had this?" Malfoy asks, posture straightening into one of uncertainty. And then, "Where are yours?"
"No. This is the first time it's come into the atelier. All work prior to this," he says, tapping the edge of the hoop, "was done in my flat. On my own time."
Thirty-five had been the age he'd picked out a casket to bury in his husband's name, instead, and now it seems he has no husband anymore. And so the nursery remains under a layer of dust.
"Potter," Draco says, taking a careful step forward, and Potter huffs violently, as though a giant's pressed on his ribs to squeeze all the air out of him.
"Eleven on a Monday morning, Harry?" Draco scoffs. "How aristocratic of you. Didn't you just say you have masses of work to get through?"
"If I'd told you, would you have listened? Or would you have charged on ahead and made me stay behind?" Draco huffs as he meets Harry's gaze with his own defiant one. "I did what I thought was right. I'm not sorry."
Harry laughs, and puts down his tea to help gather it up, but Draco waves him back with an irritable grunt. "It's alright to be rusty, you know," Harry says as he sits back down. "It's been fifteen years."
"How dare you!" Draco gasps, and he's only half-joking. There's plenty of interest in his sketch, with fine fabrics and plenty of glamour.
"I don't even know if I know," he said with a gentle puff of air from his nostrils, not quite a snort or a sigh. "He—he was smiling, right up till the end when it looked like he wanted to say something. And I woke up when I tried to go to him."
Within a few angry strides Griselda is upon Draco, hauling him up by the collar and jamming the point of her wand into his throat. "And you're not going to fucking stop me, of
"Unlucky for you, I've got ears," the barkeep says, giving Malfoy a disappointed look. "I've also got free rein and not much patience for nonsense, so now you're both out for the night."
been drinking, that's why I keep saying it over and over again. I'm not an id—" He catches himself. "I'm not
"Nobody's going to come barging in before you're ready," Draco reminds Harry, as he holds up the finished outer robe. "Relax."
"About you summoning me here without telling me what for," Draco says, voice as haughty as he can make it, the better to mask his nerves. "I don't know your intentions. They could be
The chandelier was never re-hung, following Harry’s escape from Malfoy Manor. A reminder, Voldemort had said, of the failures of the Malfoy and Black bloodlines to serve him—a reminder to do better, to work harder to achieve the Dark Lord's ends. It has lain, shattered and askew, in the center of the drawing room growing furry with dust, and Draco has not seen it since the day his mother began locking rooms.
What a stupid delivery. He sounds like a pathetic teenager. Any moment Harry's going to get up and leave, too good to laugh but too uncomfortable to stay. He should say something else, something more mature to take the pressure off so Harry knows he can tell him to fuck off. "You can ignore me, if you want, it was stup—"

"Harry!" Granger's voice rings out across the dark lawn, and she comes pelting out of the house to hurl her entire body at Harry in a tight embrace. Harry's breath gets knocked out of him with a big
"I'm here, aren't I?" Draco groans, taking his seat at his desk and ignoring Pansy's jab. (Yes, yes, he's got a Potter problem, he's heard it before.) He can't attend to all the adjustments he needs to make to Potter's robes and trousers just yet, faced first with a mountain of paperwork. He would have done well to be on time.
Suddenly Malfoy is zooming through the water for the shoreline, and his long, narrow body rises from the pond like an underfed Godzilla, water streaming from broad, bony shoulders. "I should have known you'd figure out how to drive me off no matter what you said," Malfoy snarls, marching for his own pile of clothing. He keeps his back to Harry, which Harry is quite alright with—if the way Malfoy's underwear clings sheerly to his buttocks is any indictation, Harry would get an eye-searing show if Malfoy turned around at all. Malfoy stomps into his trousers, making the seat of them wet instantly, but he doesn't seem to care as he rounds on Harry.
The box is full of photos, thrown in higgledy-piggledly by Harry himself. They'd agreed, once they started buying frames, to be choosy about which photos had earned the real estate of being displayed about the house, but too many photos were still too precious not to keep. Draco reaches in.
Draco finishes his piled-up work late, the last one in the atelier again, and bids his work on Potter's robes goodnight. He'll have to come in early to work on them, his body aching with the length of today. He shouldn't have pulled that little stunt with falling to his knees at Twelve Grimmauld.
"I don't know what 'myself' is, anymore," Harry admits, biting his lip. "I feel like—like I only exist in extremes, and none of them are the 'myself' I remember, or want to be."
, of Harry kissing his neck in some shadowy corner of the venue, the sadder he'll be when the time comes. He won't be entering the Gala on Potter's arm, but more likely three feet behind him, checking that Harry's three-foot train is intact and draping correctly.
"Oh, I just wanted the real destination to be a surprise," Harry says, holding out his arm. "I mean, it's somewhere we've both been, but that's a little bit of the point. Now come on, Draco."
"I mean," Harry says with a shrug, "nobody knows my hair's grown out. A wee hours appearance at St. Mungo's is not really when I want to debut a new look. Or old look." He clears his throat. "Don't look at me like that."
Where Draco had just felt nothing, now he burns, staring at the etched metal cradled in the valley of Harry's palm. "I don't want it." He doesn't want this final, physical evidence that his marriage is over.
His thirteen year old self would mock Potter. His seventeen year old self would simply leave, neither harming nor helping. But Draco at thirty-two crosses the distance between himself and Potter, and kneels in kind as he puts firm hands on Potter's back. "You need to breathe," he says, impersonating his therapist.
Ron and Hermione are here, naturally. Luna and Ginny have come, but the twins have the weekend with Luna's amicably-divorced ex-husband. Neville has come alone, holding his beer with two hands and listening to the main conversation with a nod so constant it might as well be set to a beat. Blaise and Pansy have made it, as well, and Draco prays Pansy hasn't said anything too wicked. He holds no such hope for Blaise.
"And your friends, they're here too," Draco adds, quickly as he turns back to the room. Ever since this whole business with Harry started, he's blushed more than he has in his entire life, he's quite sure. "I saw them."
But he won't be leaving the Manor. He finishes his dinner, does his own washing up, and pens a trite response to his mother that acknowledges her mundane European adventures and utterly ignores her plea for his company. He mentions, with just a few words, that he's been contracted by the Ministry; she'll like that. Then he ties the letter to the leg of Archimedes, his very moody horned owl, and spends the rest of his evening reading a Muggle novel before heading to bed at a reasonable hour, in one of the only bedrooms left unlocked.
Draco's mucking everything up. "Your hair," he says, despite keeping it to himself twice before now.
"Oh, don't get all sackcloth and ashes about it," Pansy huffs. "Will you promise to stop being so woebegone and let us back into your tedious little life?"
Harry tells himself he's 25 now, there's no need to confront or even acknowledge Malfoy's presence. He's a grown man, perfectly capable of not having his holiday ruined by former junior league Death Eaters who publicly claim to have reformed. He's definitely above noting that Malfoy's hairline is already receding like his imprisoned father's, or that Malfoy seems to have already acquired a sunburn. What a stupid git.
"It's beautiful," Potter breathes. The silver of the embroidery seems to reflect in his eyes as they flick from detail to detail. He can't take his hands off the robe, the pads of his fingers running along the branches of the trees, the roundness of the moon, the stag's branching antlers bearing tiny flower buds. "It's so much more than I—" He swallows. "I almost can't believe it's all real."
he's not satisfied. Will I ever measure up to the royal standard? Will I ever be able to smell a wine at ten meters and know exactly what its barreler had for breakfast in 1675?"
The smile drops from Potter's face, and now Draco wishes he hadn't said anything. He doesn't want to be the person who stops Potter from smiling, not anymore. Not ever, really, even when he thought he did.
When Harry tumbles into the canola fields outside the Malfoy estate, dragging in breaths so deep it makes him dizzy, he looks up and Draco Malfoy's head is haloed by the brilliant sun, the ends of his tallow-colored hair lit like fire. He's something ethereal, a being of light offering his strange generosity.
"Stop!" Draco says, and he's embarrassed to find that his breaths come quickly with panic. "I—I don't think he wants to hear from me."
"I'm not naked," Potter mutters, and Draco stifles his laughter. It's such a silly response to Draco's spiel. "Fine. You're a professional, and all." The charm melts away, though Draco thinks he's never seen a charm dissipate so slowly.
Draco swallows around the knot in his throat, and breaks the connection between them. "Thank you," he says, much more stiffly than he wants to. He wants Potter to know he means it.
"Nice to see you haven't gotten any less difficult," she snorts into the flute, taking a sip. "I'm sure that's how you charmed Harry."
"I don't," Hermione says. "And Ron works in Sports, he'll have no business talking Auror cases. It is, Malfoy, quite literally your job to speak to Harry about this."
They're quiet again, the only sounds the breeze, the buzz of insects and chirp of birds, the clink of the heavy wine bottle against the fragile wine glass as Draco pours his own serving.
Harry gets up abruptly, yanking out his chair as he does. "Shakshuka, is it?" he says, pulling down his jumper where it's ridden up from sitting. And he leaves the room.
"You were just—you were very loud," Draco tells Potter's socked feet. That's as far as his limited courage takes him at the moment.
He has to get up. Draco throws back the coverlet to get out of bed, instead, shaking his head violently as he hunts for his trousers. He's annoyed to find them on the floor, rumpled from being in a pile all night, but he finds his wand on the bedside table, and taps his trousers to puff them full of steam that smooths out every wrinkle in the blink of an eye. This would have been so much more aggravating without magic, and he pauses to be grateful to have his wand back again. God, he's going to miss it once the tracking spell finishes its work.
Draco flushes. "I don't think I'm capable of inspiring that kind of feeling, but it's a lovely thought."
"I'm already good and disgraced. It's you who's in danger of being discovered for the lout you are."
in its place. Elda has just saved him from having his head put on a pike outside the atelier, he's pretty sure.
"Not just here. Other places, too," Potter adds, as if worried Draco might feel too special. "It's, er..." He looks around. "It's beautiful here, though." Draco senses that wasn't what Potter was going to say.
Harry startles, enough that Draco can finally push his wand down without meeting resistance. "I—what do you care?"
find a way to get a final jab in, but Draco nearly smiles as he pops the lid back on and tucks it into the cold cabinet.
"I just don't want you to think it's what you want after—" Draco sits up to count on his fingers, straddling Harry's hips. "Well, it's only been a week since your little romantic picnic, and not even two months since the start of the case."
Draco's balance shifts, and he stumbles noisily in the canola stalks. The figure turns abruptly, the whites of their eyes shining and wet in the silver light from above.
Blaise frowns before his eyes go wide in realization, his mouth puckered with surprise, and then he's grinning so fiendishly Draco wishes he'd just said he was a gatecrasher. He could have at least worded it some other way. "
fit the bill. But to say Potter looks taken aback is an understatement; the man's physically taken a step back from him. Draco closes his eyes, taking in a deep, shuddering breath through his nostrils.
"What if you get there and they all see just how beautiful you are?" Draco all but whispers. "What if they're all in awe of you for being so brave?"
"Good." Her firm hand on his shoulder still gives him pause. "I'm happy for you and Harry. Come by again."
The pub door opens. "I said get gone, the both of you!" the barkeep shouts. "You're both pretty, now back to your bloody cottages and go sleep it off!" The door slams shut again.
Lucius could not live with his regret, no. After years of cycling through several reactions to his incarceration—fury, pleading, attempted bribery, and finally unabashed sadness—he had fallen to listlessness, and could not be convinced or forced to eat or drink. He died, in fact, much like victims of Venari Virtute—just with less screaming.
"Yes, I'll burst in past all your wards and set fire to the house if I see so much as a fork out of place."
"It's not." Granger kisses the forehead of another, taller child with a bushy mane of ginger curls, dismissing the girl from the kitchen with a few quiet words. "We just came for a visit, but Molly and Arthur are out right now."
He'd feel it, if Harry's life force had been snuffed out somewhere. He's sure of it. And so, even as he attends Harry's funeral, stony amid a sea of wailing and sobbing, he considers his next move.
"Depressing," Harry agrees. Then he convinces Malfoy to share a boot with him, because if they're on holiday they should try weird novelties, and because it's massive. The barkeep only agrees because they're not fighting this time.
"Oh, well then!" Harry scoffs. "What a moment of growth for you. You hate Little Lord Fauntleroy on its own merits, and not just because its creator didn't own a wand. I'll mark you down as 'reformed' on the list of evil gits responsible for the suffering of others, shall I?"
And then six months are up. Any day, now, Draco will hear the creak of the gate that needs oiling, and Harry will be coming down the cottage path, looking exhausted but happy to be home. Draco will pretend Harry's only been gone a day, stand steadfastly ignoring him—oh, who is he kidding? He'll fly down the path, and collide with Harry so hard that Harry will have to pick him up,
"That would be lovely, thank you," Draco mumbles. He finally looks down to discover he was working on a totally different order, and immediately begins checking it for similar mistakes.
Except, of course, that's not how Draco dresses at all. He considers his style of dress masculine enough, and yet he loves playing with silhouettes in his clothing. He just—
"Is that something you want in real life, perhaps?" she asks as she stops writing, though she keeps her pen at the ready.
"Night, Pans." Draco does his best to swallow his yawn, or at least hold it off until Pansy's good and gone.
Again, Draco feels as though the words have been borrowed from his own thoughts. "But you're not like that here."
like it has. Potter is nowhere to be seen, which feels like as much of a dismissal as an actual goodbye. Draco doesn't even know if he himself can Apparate in the house, but after what Potter pulled, he's not much interested in trying, and heads for the stairs.
committed the sin of Orientalism, not me," she says, prim as she holds the parchment back out to him. "Did you forget Potter's part Bengali? You can't put him in this. It's just weird."
He's still tired; six hours is no replacement for night after night of little to no sleep. Draco comes downstairs to find Potter in the kitchen, plates of hot and delicious food waiting on the table.
Potter sighs, pushing a hand into his curls. "Of course I am, nobody wants to be overheard when they're, er—"
"Why don't you want to sit with me?" Harry comes closer; the way he peeks out of the shroud is jarring, making the charm spotty.
"It's too much." He flings the part of the robe in his grasp to the floor, joining the rest of the garment without much fanfare.
"I don't suppose you're planning on wearing that thing underneath your suit," Draco says, eyeing the offending shirt.
From there, Hermione calls the children into the kitchen to introduce them properly to Harry. Rose is eager to prove she knows all about Harry, with a rapidfire listing of all of Harry's most famous moments, and Ron pulls her away with an
he'd shouted for emphasis, before pulling out yet another drawer full of emptiness and disappointment. "And if I need Potter's attention, it's to the work I'm doing for—"
It's at least a bit softer of a room. Instead of a fireplace, heavy curtains hang over French doors that seem to lead out onto a small deck, when Draco peeks behind them. Mauve velvet seating makes Draco feel cozy as he sets his satchel down, popping it open into drafting table form out of habit. The edited sketch is already atop it, the Mandarin collar swapped instead for epaulettes sporting the same crested buttons as featured on the front closure. He likes the added militaristic vibe without any lapels. Draco's been toying with the idea of adding spikes to the epaulettes—like the ridges on a Norwegian Ridgeback—but it might be pushing the envelope for the shrinking violet Potter's become. That, and perhaps the particular breed comparison is a little too personal for their history, he reminds himself, chewing his bottom lip. Now they're like the ridges on a Hebridean Black.
Twelve Grimmauld Place, clawing its way out from between numbers Eleven and Thirteen as Draco recites from the parchment owled to him earlier. A familiar address, once he's thought about it long enough; one of the handful of London satellites of Pureblood ancestry he visited as a child. This one belongs—or belonged, he should say—to his mother's aunt. He wonders if Potter's kept up the taxidermied house elf heads he's pretty sure he remembers from those childhood visits, and a wry smirk twists his lips. Wouldn't that be something.
"Make you what?" Harry murmurs against Draco's skin. A soft clank is probably the headpiece being dropped to the courtyard tiles.
"Indecent," Draco finishes, as Harry presses closer still, kissing each corner of Draco's mouth. "In this outfit."
Potter puts his face into his hands, leaning forward until his elbows rest on his knees. He says nothing as well, the silence between them filled with birdsong, the daytime scurrying of bold small animals, the wind whistling along without any trees to slow it down.
"You've what? Hired a private investigator? Sent some dogs out after him?" Blaise interrupts. "I am trying, Draco, to be as sensitive as everyone else, and Hecate knows it's hardly in me to tread lightly. But you are in dangerous waters."
Then Draco explains, at last, that even if Harry hates him now, which he must, the spell still must be finished. The spell that will hopefully put an end to the Rabid Dog Curse. Granger asks intellectual, curious questions about his spellcraft and theory, and Weasley groans as he sets about cleaning up the empty tea cups instead.
Whatever he feels eating food Potter made specifically for him, or being so close to Potter as he works, or exchanging little bits of trauma with Potter—it's natural, surely. Draco's well-liked by his other clients.
He busies himself sketching a new, more stylized suit, with an asymmetrical closure that leads to a tall Mandarin collar. The trousers are slim without being tight, fitted just right over low boots with intricate brogue detailing. Gold crested buttons march along the jacket's closure, and at the jacket's cuffs; he'll have them cast himself if he can't source any with dragons. He fills the jacket with interlocking drawings of various dragon breeds, at least those he can remember off the top of his head; these will be gold embroidery on a bordeaux silk taffeta that will make the whole thing gleam. Arcing over the croquis' head, he scribbles an impression of a Hungarian Horntail in flight. Pansy will make that incredible.
"Sprained my ankle, what's it look like?" There's not much bite to Malfoy's words, though, as focused as he is on his healing charms. "This sodding mountain hasn't got any firm footing. You'd think there'd be a path."
"With that," he says, pounding one fist into the flat of his other hand, "we should be led right to the source. The original curse caster."
Well, Draco can be professional, too. He's getting paid for this, after all. "At first," he says, tugging his thick sheaf of research from his bag as neatly as he can, "only what made the papers. A viral curse, turning each witch or wizard it affects into a rabid host looking to cast the curse next. But it's clear to me that this curse has a root." He lays his parchment next to the folder. "That much must be clear to Minister Shacklebolt as well, as he's asked me to find that root."
For a moment, Harry is prepared to tell Malfoy that anything he has to bear is still better than he deserves. Beyond the war, Malfoy has just never been a good person—cruel, petty, cowardly, delighting in the suffering of others.
"How embarrassing to be so worried," Blaise drawls, over tea a week later. Draco agrees, all the more for being called out on it so many times.
"What about ale?" Greg asks as he walks back in. "I can recommend you some good summer ales." He glances at Draco. "That's no good for your back, Draco."
, to make sure his robes don't spontaneously unravel, or that his hair doesn't turn into a bird's nest before dinner," Draco corrects. "Yes, clearly, or I wouldn't be here."
"Is that the whole picture? Does Master grant me permission to speak?" Pansy asks, arching both brows.
"That doesn't make any sense," Draco chuckles, flipping his French curve to complete his line. "You're Pansy. You'd be late to your own child's birth."
"Yes, I was planning on laying you down on it, but I had to buy the biggest one they had to accommodate your massive head," Harry replies, hurrying past Malfoy so he doesn't have to school his face into passive calm anymore. His head is filled with images of pressing Malfoy into the tall grass, making his ears flaming hot, followed by his own mental voice shouting that these aren't his own thoughts—he's just alone with Malfoy and an overactive imagination, is all. If Ron and Hermione were here, he'd never consider it.
"Might be. The last time I went out there was, hmm..." Harry pulls a hand out of the pretzel of his arms, and counts on his fingers. "About six years ago?"
"Oh." Malfoy hasn't got anything to say to that, it seems, and conversation dies again, until he says, "I always thought you hated to be alone. Every single time I saw you at school you were always surrounded by people."
Second: Pertinger has lost her magic. It's not even something actively tracked at St. Mungo's, given that magic levels fluctuate naturally with health and mood, but the utter absence of magic could not be ignored.
"Ha! And I'm here to hold Ginny's drinks," Pansy says. "Good one, Malfoy. Madam Malkin must be absolutely
"Pans," Draco says later, while Greg is hunting for the nearest lavatory and Blaise is downstairs judging the Malfoy wine collection, "let me paint you a scenario, and you tell me what it means."
That'd be no way to earn himself future work with the ministry, true. Draco heads home with a heavy sigh, back to the echoing mausoleum that is Malfoy Manor. There's a moment where his hand lingers over parchment in the study, tempted to owl Pansy and invite her and Blaise over for a day of so-called bereavement—but he's not ready to be dressed down for his atrocious behavior at the funeral, no matter how much he deserves it.
When Draco closes his eyes, all he can see is Harry as he's come to know him, soft and open in moonlight, happy and loving in sunlight. Harry who cooks for him, Harry who likes him, Harry who casually admits he fantasizes about taking Draco on holiday. Harry who fixes him a friendly romantic picnic and silently hopes Draco will kiss him for it. Harry who shares his fears with Draco, Harry who opens himself to Draco's fears in return.
"In wizarding Europe," Draco corrects. He'll duel every magical couturier in Paris for the title if need be. Milan, too. He knows he's good.
Draco's pulse thrums through his chest, his arms, his trembling hands. "I—" He could put down the bag. He could say he meant accessories, and oh no, he's forgotten them at the atelier, what a shame. Why does it feel as though he's working up to a romantic confession?
"I know that in school I was a prat," he says, taking himself by surprise. "More than a prat. I was a bigot. I was a narrow-minded idiot. I was a pig."
"This is not what I invited you here for, you know." He takes an irritable sip of his wine. "I wanted to apologize to both of you, not be interrogated for things I told you
"What will my life be now, without panic attacks and a pathetic inability to speak to dear friends?" Draco scoffs. "What sort of wretch—"
"That was before I tried it on and realized I was fucking drowning in it! All this is supposed to do is hide me—"
Strong arms pull Draco in, and Harry is embracing him, crushing Draco's skinny frame to his own. Despite every self-loathing thought in his head, Draco returns it, his fingers clutching at the back of Harry's shirt as if for dear life. He doesn't understand how he came here to rescue Harry and yet here he is, crying into Harry's shoulder as Harry rocks him back and forth, feeling Harry's heartbeat against his own.
"Well, I'm going up to the manor to have an ice bath," Draco says, a bit more stiffly than he means to.
"You didn't tell me you were going to the Gala!" Draco fumes, as Harry struggles to socialize beside him. "What on
"Perhaps," Draco says, pressing his palms together at his waist to quell their fidgeting. Williamson is right, and it unnerves him that the quiet, mostly-retired old man in the corner opposite his is so on top of Draco's schedule.
"Are you inviting our entire year from Hogwarts, darling?" Draco calls down into the kitchen. "Because that's the message I'm getting from what you've just sent to the tables."
Harry doesn't meet Malfoy's gaze, too afraid of the weight of it. Too afraid of what he'll find. Instead he looks up at the ominous clouds. "Rain's coming," he says. "We'd better pack it in."
Harry gives himself another reminder that he's too old for such pettiness, and that it doesn't matter what Malfoy's life is, anyway, and takes himself to the front of the tour group.
Harry Potter stands before Draco, and Draco knows it's him because he recognizes that defiant expression, that certain nose, those green eyes, all of which he recognizes before he spots the lightning bolt scar under Potter's hairline. But—
It had been rough, transitioning from their holiday romance, built in a month of being ensconced in the Irish wilderness, to their real lives filled with terrible history, expectations, responsibilities, and very, very shocked friends. Especially Harry's. A theory that Draco had drugged Harry with some sort of lucid love potion went around, and Harry was dragged to St. Mungo's for thorough testing, but he came back with clean results save for his mild dependence on sleeping draughts.
Draco struggles to sit upright, feeling as though his energy's been drained away. "What's happened?" he wants to know. "What are you doing here?"
Draco leaves the Ministry building, but he certainly doesn't go home. No, instead he heads out to make his own private investigations, because he knows anything else he tries to do right now will produce only failure and irritation. He's met with a lot of closed doors—no Auror authority means no answers, usually—but still he forges on, cursing under his breath between each stop.
The shepherd's pie is hearty and flavorful, though the salad is overdressed and basic. Draco comments on the former, and Harry beams. Harry's bought a Bordeaux from just a few years ago, and Draco can't help but say something about its age, but it just makes Harry snicker. "Oh, not that bit with the wine barreler again," Draco groans, which only makes Harry laugh louder.
That explains a lot about Potter's fashion sense during their school years, whenever robes were not required. Although Draco remembers, with the accuracy of long term obsession, that Potter looked like he got dressed in the dark long after first year.
"I just think it's funny," Harry says with an extra chuckle. "I can't imagine Draco Malfoy, age 11, thinking he'd ever call himself that."
"Well, you didn't have to shout it out, Hermione," Harry says, sheepishly, "but yeah, as of a bit earlier today, yeah."
"Alright, that's enough standing around." Molly's voice cutting across the yard heralds the arrival of the food, which makes its way to the tables in a jumbled midair queue. Harry, Ron and Ginny intercept the platters as they arrive, arranging them by hand; Molly's levitating charms don't have quite the accuracy they once did. Arthur appears with an armful of bottles of pumpkin juice and sparkling cider for the kids, and Draco darts over to help him set them down before he drops them all.
"No!" Draco barks, and then slaps both hands to his face, groaning. "No. Charlie didn't do a blasted thing. I'm sorry for shouting, that was boorish of me."
"You know, I think I knew a Griselda," Greg muses. "That bugger Yaxley's daughter. Horrible little girl."
"And you are now?" Draco smooths both sides of the collar across Potter's chest, considering his work.
The Fiendfyre. The sum of their terrible, tumultuous relationship as children. Draco wonders if Harry can read his eyes as clearly, if he can see Draco's self-loathing, his ardent teenage desire for someone he taught himself to hate.
"Auror Blair Pertinger," Draco says, trying to sound conversational as he stands just out of arm's reach from her bed. Her arms are snug under the restraints, but there's no sense in trusting bits of leather. "Do you know who I am?"
"Fine. But only because you're being violent and I'm afraid for my life." Malfoy finally accepts Harry's hand, and Harry takes at least a little pleasure in yanking him up so suddenly that Malfoy stumbles a few paces. "Potter! Be careful, you idiot!"
"You tell it, then," Ron says, sticking out his chin in challenge, but Draco can see the affection in his eyes.
"Stop making everything so complicated," Harry says with a roll of his eyes, but he looks affectionate, not annoyed. "There doesn't have to be a logical equation to someone wanting to be with you, Draco."
"You've been Obliviated," Draco says, just as it dawns on him. "Har—" He stops himself. "You're thirty-eight. Not twenty-three. Please put your wand down," he adds, with a glance downward.
Draco scowls, putting his wand in his lap as he sits back down and picks up his glass again. "We're coworkers. You know this."
"Right then," Draco says, snatching up his tape again as he gets to his feet. He opens the drawer of his drafting table, pulling out a notebook, quill and inkpot. A Dictaquill is so much more convenient, but he thinks saying every measurement aloud for the sake of an enchanted quill might be what kills Potter at last. "Let's get measuring."
"Do you talk to Harry? Is he alright?" Granger is leaning forward again, her eyes glittering as she reaches for Draco's wrist.
Fenrir had said, that time. And again, and again, in different rooms all over the manor, never doing much more than trapping Draco with his weight and taunting him but always inciting the same fear.
save lives, whether Harry is in the mood for him or not. Perhaps Williamson will burst in behind him, to add... something, Draco's not actually sure what. He could go either way, really. He frowns as he glances out the window.
"I'm going to go collect my drink from my favorite botanist, then," Blaise says. "I'm coming to the manor next week with Pansy and you've no choice in the matter."
"Here," Draco says, "look." He signs the document with a flourish, or as much of a flourish as a disgustingly mundane ballpoint pen will let him have.
Draco doesn't give himself time to think. He surges forward, long arms wrapping around a startled Harry. Harry doesn't take long to comprehend what's happening, though, because he hugs Draco back in an instant. Draco doesn't have the right words of comfort, not for something like this, but he has this. He can offer this.
"Wonderful, you haven't gone totally blind. Weasley and Granger-Weasley will be thrilled to hear about it. Now put this on before I Stun you and wrestle you into it." Draco holds the robe up all the more aggressively, staring at Harry through the organza.
"Your fault for wanting a difficult man," Draco replies, but he feels heady, disconnected from the earth. Giddy, that might be a term that applies here. And then— "You do, don't you?" Draco falters. "Want me, I mean."
"I thought robes were brilliant, when I was eleven, you know." Draco has nothing left to pin at the back, and he fidgets with the strap of his pincushion, snapping and unsnapping it. "Plain black robes with the hem taken up—they fit everyone basically the same way. Nothing stands out." Potter glances to one side, but not enough to see Draco. "Before I came to Hogwarts, the only clothes I'd ever worn were my cousin's massive hand-me-downs. Didn't matter if they were stained, or threadbare, or faded, or...whatever else can go wrong with clothes."
"I'm sure they're better off." Harry busies himself with pulling another cup down as the kettle starts the low notes of its trilling.
His tongue is loaded with pleas to their friendship, barbs about her coldness, at least one smug comment about the recognition the Malfoy name commands that hers never will, another about his loyal clients that will follow him anywhere. It's second nature to him, to fire those shots. They'll find their mark, no doubt. A decades-long friendship would be so easy to shatter, at least for him. It's a very special Malfoy talent, he thinks.
When Harry's owl returns one more time, Draco doesn't open the message, too engrossed in his three concurrent stitching spells, the effort of which makes him feel barely lucid.
Harry taps the door beside him with his wand. "And you had this door open, too. Reliving the glory days, were you? Smug about escaping Azkaban?" Draco doesn't even realize which door it is until Harry is taking another sudden, massive step forward. Draco's heel catches on an imperfection in the grout and tumbles onto his arse, looking all the way up at Harry. His wand clatters against the floor, and Draco rushes to hold it again, drawing Harry's eyes to it.
The dream is, of course, inaccurate; Draco at seventeen, barely a man, could not cast the curse that stole Albus Dumbledore's life away. Not a coward for that, Dr. Fiddlewood has said, many times. Brave, she said, to value life enough to hesitate to take it. Human, she said as well, to hear Dumbledore's appeals to his better nature.
"Don't be an arse. At least tell me why." Pansy puts gentle fingers on Draco's forearm. "Please, Draco."
And judging by the size and placement of the manor on the horizon, this is the exact spot in the canola fields where Harry had pulled Draco after the Dendron incident. The spot where Harry had finished Draco off, really, calling him by his first name and more than that calling him
"I think you'll find I've got plenty of pull where I'm at," Harry says, with another step closer. "Enough to get the Trace waived for you until the end of the case."
His eyelids slide shut as tears crowd his lashes, threatening to spill down his cheeks. "I would never—I had nowhere left to—" The tears make good on their threat, and Harry hiccups as they roll down his face.
to address Harry's little joke. Why let Harry remind him of reality?) Harry pulls him up with such strength that Draco stumbles several steps. "Harry!"
"Why would you even try it, Malfoy? What's to be gained? Because that's what everything you do is about. Getting something out of others."
Draco does his best to give her a broad smile on the fly, and she returns it with a hesitant smile that's much smaller, fluttering off her face in a matter of seconds. Then she returns to her task of laying out plates, ducking her head down.
"Oh no?" Blaise asks, arching one perfectly-shaped brow; it's hard to tell if he's being sarcastic, honestly. "A pity, and a lost opportunity as well."
The tone of the article, if one could call it that, was grossly salacious, especially when the author bragged of how
The wind is vicious on the other side of the portal, icy as Draco's cloak billows and snaps in its capricious grasp, and yet still it's drowned out by the crash of the ocean at the bottom of the cliff he's standing on. Draco tastes salt on the air. Draco sees, as he turns around, that he's on a tiny crag of an island, and the only thing to look at besides sea and sky and rock is a dilapidated shack in the center of the land.
"Because you don't like doing payroll!" Draco protests, but that's all he gets out before she stands inches away from him, leaning over him until he realizes he's leaning his chair back, too. Her charmed halo of tiny pixies seems to flare, the pixies looking just as cross as she does. He thinks they might be crossing their tiny translucent arms, but he doesn't get a good look because Pansy grabs him fully by the jaw, forcing him to look at her.
a lot. "My face." He gestures at said face with both hands, and ends up splashing himself in the mouth.
"But then why didn't you show me this?" Potter's voice asks from above Draco's head. "Why did you finish—Malfoy!" A hand shaking Draco's shoulder forces his eyes to refocus.
"Well, er." In Draco's peripheral vision, Harry unfolds his arms and finally sits up. "I suppose really my hobby became cooking, but that's not something I can do all day, not when I live on my own."
“The birds,” Hermione replies, and Draco realizes for all he’s learned about Harry’s friends, he has no idea what she means. “
"Lunch on a blanket, in a field, in the middle of the day," Draco says as he approaches the blanket. Cushioning charms below keep him from feeling the firm earth and pebbles under his knees when he kneels. "Yes, a bloody picnic." If he weren't so
"Gone home?" Draco repeats, upper lip curling as he looks first at Larch then at Potter's door. "Without so much as a by your leave?"
"Oh, you're trying to be clever, I see," Draco says, watching Harry heave himself up. "It wasn't a very good attempt, but points for effort."
The shimmer of the charm paces, closing the door on its way past it, then reopening it on a second pass, only to close the door again seconds later. "I know," Potter's voice says, nearly a minute delayed. There's enough distress in those two simple words that Draco chooses to put his measuring tape down, waiting silently for Potter to work out this particular anxiety.
"They're little patty pans, not Hagrid's giant pumpkins. Is it really so hard to just put them in the basket?"
Alarm spreads through Draco's chest, squeezing at his throat. "Do you think they're wondering about us back at the Ministry?" He doesn't even want to say it, could spend the rest of his life here in this field being soft with Potter, but it's too late. His mouth is a defense mechanism against his own self interests.
, and he manages through sheer force of will, staring the tea down so he won't miss the perfect moment to remove it from the water.
Harry dips his head underwater, letting his wet hair cool him against the humidity and heat of the day. He lays back in the water, ignoring Malfoy for a moment as he takes in the canopy above, dappled with the early morning sky between its leaves. "You know," he murmurs, letting the windswept current of the pond carry him along, "it really is beautiful here, when you're not caught up in arguing with someone."
"Just saying! Thought there might be some kind of special occasion. But maybe we all ought to be dressing up for the sake of it." A laugh. "Take care, Harry."
He doesn't like the feeling of bright light needling his eyeballs. The memory of Griselda restoring his sight is still fresh. He tries to put a hand over his eyes and doesn't get much more than moving his hand from his side to his thigh.
"No, I'm Ms. Parkinson, half owner of an atelier that doesn't even bear her name, and you're a muppet." It's almost funny how something so cutting can be said so delicately.
"Well, you still can't come to my flat." Draco flicks one of his many persistent flyaways out of his face, and pins the front armscye by one sixteenth of an inch. Every tiny increment counts toward the perfect fit. "Not until you're no longer a paying client."
The larger owl that returns bearing a plate of jasmine rice, grilled caulini and a spice-rubbed pork tenderloin under a stasis charm should have been a surprise. The note that comes with it just reads
After that, other guests start arriving by the minute, Draco stationing himself by the door to greet the blur of Harry's friends. Blaise makes a surprise appearance as well, bringing the Greengrass sisters with him. ("I didn't want you to feel left out again, while you get to know my friends properly," Harry says, later.)
"To tell you the truth," the orderly confesses, "I'd noticed a dip in her magical levels beforehand, but I attributed it to her terrible health from the curse. That, and her magical levels didn't disappear overnight—they plummeted, yes, and it was so quick there was nothing we could even try, but they didn't just vanish."
"There's just a lot." Harry sighs, maneuvering around until he's lying on his stomach, facing the food so he can grab a cracker, which he tops with a bit of Chevre. "We don't have to talk about this, you know. I brought you here to enjoy yourself."
There's an intersection of those two ideas dancing at the tip of his mind's tongue, but Draco can't quite spit it out. That, and his father's casket is fading from sight, the last of his mother's spellwork moving it to its final resting place in the catacombs. Draco shudders to think there's been a space for his corpse there since the moment he was born.
"Clearly." Draco flexes his fingers, wondering if he's hung on too long. Probably. He withdraws his hands.
"Oh, you know me, I live for danger," Draco says weakly as Harry takes a few steps back. Harry waves, and then the displaced air of his Apparition tousles Draco's hair.
"Get out so I can fix it, then," Draco says, shooing her with one hand while he pulls his inkpot closer with the other. "You're distracting."
"The Gala's been canceled?" Potter snorts. He leans against the door of the sitting room, tugging at the sagging cuffs of his jumper.
"I told you I renovated it. The house actually liked expanding a bit for things like a library, once I got started. There's all sorts of fun rooms in the house, if you want to see them after the Gala. I know you're too busy now."
"I'd pull your chair out," Harry says behind Draco, as everyone finds their seats, "but, you know. The bench is attached to the table."
If he goes to the Ministry now, Harry probably won't see him. So Draco will have to find a middleman.
"You're a prat," Draco murmurs, thumb stroking at the back of Harry's hairline. His thighs ache from kneeling and being bent backward; he's just not flexible. Oh, and his wine glass has spilled all over the blanket, Pinot soaking into its fibers and the earth below. "Is this part of making it up to me?"
"What if I can't do it?" Harry sobs. "What if I get there and I fall apart? What if I'm too i-i-insane to be around other people, what if they photograph me being insane and they—"
"Draco was just telling me I sound like an old crone because I wish Rose would do something other than look at her mobile," Hermione says as Harry sits next to Draco, slipping his arm around Draco's waist. Draco leans into him, closing what little space is left between them.
He's so close this time, and yet Griselda slashes him again, across the shoulder of his wand arm. This time there is no gasping, only a cry of pain as Draco nearly loses his grip on his wand; Griselda laughs, full-throated and delighted. She doesn't even let him try to get another hex in, sweeping her hand low to slice at Draco's thighs.
Malfoy inspects his hands, hanging between his loosely parted knees. "I could have a child, if I wanted, you know. Being gay doesn't mean I can't have or want a family, Potter."
As the crowd makes its procession into the manor—the rites won't be held in the catacombs, but in a ballroom, after which the casket will be sent to the catacombs as part of the funerary spells—Draco sees Blaise and Pansy walking ahead. He wants so badly, for a moment, to call out to them, to apologize for being such a sorry friend, but once a coward, always a coward, and the words remain trapped behind his Adam's apple.
He smooths a hand down his face, composing himself and the evenness of his breaths. "The Gala is three months away," Draco says, in the voice he uses with unfamiliar vendors and prospective clients. "As you've lost time with me, I will do the work of finding a suitable atelier to take on this job, at no cost to you." His eyes won't focus, but he's not trying particularly hard to focus them, either.
Draco very fastidiously un-musses Harry, and smooths his own dress over and over until Harry insists he's stalling. Draco still feels strange taking his seat at the table on the dais as Minister Susan Bones stands at the podium, but in a sea of mostly middle-aged faces, he can't find one that's sparing him even a glance. (Well,
Draco presses the organza into Potter's hands. "It's not done yet," he says, watching Potter twist and pull the organza to find the golden stitches Draco's lost so much sleep to, to flatten it into planes and see the larger scope of the image Draco's made. "But it's close enough that I thought I could show it to you."
"Soul-baring is what you do when you're drunk," Harry says, holding up his hand to count poorly on it again. "I had, uh—"
Again the urge to flee seizes Draco by the throat, but he roots his feet to the tiled floor. "Don't make this about us."
Draco thought then that comparing his troubles to a measly tick seemed trivializing, but she hadn't really been wrong, in the end. Draco's tick was just particularly big, and strong, and stubborn, and perhaps even had some demonic quality giving it that extra dose of tenaciousness. He imagined his tick to have horns.
know what this is supposed to look like." Draco kneels by his satchel, opening it fully to retrieve his headpiece with careful fingers. Pansy had surprised him with this one. It's nothing so intricate as Potter's, or any of the other pieces she made for Gala clients, but he thinks it's perfect. The phases of the moon float in a ring behind the wearer's head, turning slowly in one direction in perpetuity. There is no physical body but the tiny charmed clip that will easily hide in Draco's hair.
"Maybe a potion," he mutters one night, which is wearing long. The offices are empty except for himself and Harry, so he's migrated his work to Harry's desk, sitting in the Head Auror's chair while Harry continues to work on the practical end of the spell. Draco wonders, looking at him, if there's just something wrong with Draco's communication skills at their center.
"Goodnight, friendly rival," Potter says as he steps away, and the crack of displaced air that follows his disappearance makes the canola stalks wave around where he'd stood.
Blaise is the only one who sees through him. "You're up to something," he says over tea, lounging across the sage green sofa with narrowed eyes.
Harry is frozen in place. He'd gone no further than two steps past the grate, and now his eyes are wild, scanning the crowd as if every last guest is a known enemy. His hands curl and uncurl at his sides, and when he spots Draco just behind him, his arm swings back, scrabbling for Draco's hand.
"You," she says, abandoning the client requests to stalk around his desk, "accepted this client request without consulting me, your business partner who was kind enough to grant you the office with a door that closes."
The third sketch of Harry's Gala ensemble—because in the safety of his own home, Draco's become comfortable with thinking of him as
Not that they'd even decided yet how they'd acquire the child that would give the nursery its purpose. No, that had still been in question when Harry had left on his mission five years ago, but they'd most definitely agreed they would be parents by the time they were thirty-five. Harry was just so taken by the idea, once it had been put on the table, that he couldn't help but collect furniture, toys, knick-knacks, and all other sundry baby items in the second bedroom, bit by bit. Draco had managed to convince him not to buy baby clothes until they'd finally decided whether to adopt or have a surrogate.
"She doesn't come over." Harry's hand seems stuck to the handle of the kettle as he glares at it. "Nor Ron."
"It's not that," Harry murmurs, trying to refocus his eyes. He's here to escape the war. He pinches the bridge of his nose, dislodging his glasses as he screws his eyes shut to chase away visions of Cedric, alive or dead. He sighs. "Listen, Malfoy, do you need help getting down the mountain? Frankly, I don't even know how you got up this far."
Thaddeus was quick to spot the wand, quick to put together all the pieces of the strange and threatening scene and shut himself into the shop, but the clerk at Flourish & Blott's just next door hadn't had the time to be so quick. Thaddeus knew her to be a recent Hogwarts graduate, a rising star known to have excelled at all her studies who worked at Flourish & Blott's while she wisely thought over her career choices—by all accounts, a powerful witch.
"Because you made them feel they can't." It's a statement, and the only thing that keeps it from being a shout is Draco grinding his teeth. "
"No?" Griselda sneers, and she holds up her hand. "Let's turn it up a little." Her hand slices through the air, and Draco gasps as pain sears its way across his chest, cutting a precise line through his robes and shirt. Warmth soaks the fabric of both garments. "What about now? Is it familiar? Put the pieces together, Draco, I know you think you're so smart these days."
Draco can't get the bad feeling out from under his skin; it feels like too much, too soon. But he lets Archimedes out for his nightly hunt, and tells himself it's just that
"Right. That. But—I don't know, you took the wind out of my sails a bit, didn't you?" Another sigh. "Fuck you, Malfoy, that was a private moment. But also, I don't think I've known you to ever had better intentions in your slinking about. So thanks. Sort of."
before heading inside. Draco doesn't even know what to make of that, but he hurries after Harry, not about to be left outside.
He does have to assure an irritated Pansy and aloof Blaise that he really is okay, but then Greg wants to know what could have made him not okay, and he
Without exploding, Auror Potter discovers where the rest of the children have been hidden in the house, behind a false wall in the basement. They are similarly bony and dirty, but they are
of bodies in my time working as a couturier. I have seen many of them topless, and some of them naked as well, even though I certainly didn't ask. You are
It's Draco's turn to jump when Potter lays his big, heavy head against his shoulder, his breaths finally coming evenly. His whole body radiates fatigue and pain. He doesn't remember doing this with his therapist; usually by now he'd be sitting back in a big, cushiony chair, finding all the nerves in his skin again. There are no cushiony chairs in this strange room though, and now Draco is afraid to move.
"No! No, Harry, when we were drinking!" Malfoy cuts across Harry, and the use of his given name alone is enough to stun him into subsiding deeper into the water. Then he thinks about what Malfoy is saying, and comes right back up again.
"It's you or the idiots in the rest of these shacks who won't give me the time of day because of my particular surname, so don't get too excited." Malfoy uncrosses his arms just to cross them again. "Give me an answer."
Pansy calls Draco an old stuffed chair for preferring quills to pens, but the Muggle writing implement gives him hand cramps after enough writing, and he doesn't like how they dent and otherwise destroy perfectly lovely parchment. He keeps all this to himself and approaches the table by the stairs, as instructed, and starts his detailed inspection of the document.
It doesn't last. He knows full well he set himself up by accepting Harry's invitation—invitations, plural, if you count all his weekends spent at Twelve Grimmauld Place. He was social practice for Harry, and clearly that practice has paid off, if Harry's high spirits are anything to go by. Draco has no place here, no matter how many years it's been, and after tonight, Harry will have no need of him—at least, not until the next Gala. In five years.
"I had the dream again, too," he says, soft and quiet the way he gets when she's peeled back enough of him with her gentle prodding. "The second version. Without Dumbledore."
Unfortunately for Draco and his nosy mind, Potter is not his only client, nor is Pansy the only other person working. It's also Monday, and Elda arrives soon after Draco's little Primark-related tantrum with the paperwork necessary to process payroll, which means he won't be walking the floor of the atelier to check on various projects for some time, and he'll be fucked for time if a single new client walks through the front door. All because he'd forgotten himself and whisked himself away for hours at the slightest mention of Harry James Potter.
"You're the first person, Potter, that I've been able to—what would you call this? Accountability?" And he looks at Harry as though he really means the question.
"It's not your job," Harry says, lightly, but he leans into Draco's touch anyway. "I can't rely on you to keep me from falling apart. I can't ask you to stay with me. And I should have noticed you were being left out." He sniffles, looking out over the courtyard. "I need you because I just
"If I'm going to get called Saint Potter in the papers they might as well make it official, don't you think?" Harry laughs in return. "Careful, Ron. If you muss me Draco'll be cross."
"Yes, well." Draco pulls his work back over, and Pansy seems to finally notice it, her gaze sharpening as the cork top disappears under the masses of organza. "Lately I haven't been sleeping." He spreads his hands across the silk organza, around the wooden hoop that holds part of it taut for embroidery work. "Because of this."
"Next time you see me, you can apologize some more," Harry says. "Can you find your way back from here?"
Molly makes a visit, and just as she had within the first year of Harry's disappearance, she brings him lasagne, meat pies, hearty stews, heaps of roasted vegetables, and all other kinds of recipes usually meant to feed an army of Weasleys. She brings him desserts, too, like an enormous seven-layer trifle, a raspberry-lemon tray bake, and a rich-looking chocolate cake, all floating in behind her under miniature shielding and stasis charms as she Floos into the cottage.
"That's laying it on thick," Draco says, as delicately as he can. Will Potter ever just pick up his damn fork and eat a bite of pasta?
"What?" Potter looks down sharply. "Fairly attached to not showing all of wizarding society my arse, yeah.
"Good morning," Draco says, to be louder than the argument with himself currently brewing in his head. Harry looks up, and gives Draco a smile so much like the one in his fantasy he wants to run right back into the hall. "Ready to get sacked today?"
He wonders if Harry will serve him divorce papers, now that his death certificate has been rescinded. One piece of parchment for another.
Draco is here to work. But Potter's become broad enough that when Draco's fingertips finally do meet at his back, transferring the end of the measuring tape from one hand to the other, there's only a few inches between their chests, Draco's face angled away. Here, there's no escaping Potter's shaky breath, or the heat that radiates from his body, far from the warm mannequin Draco has been envisioning. For a second, he's simply embracing Potter.
"Not yet you aren't," Harry says, pulling the stew closer. It's a little on the grey side. The lager he ignores.
"Not an interrogation. An interview." Potter barely nods at him before leaving to reappear on the other side of the glass, and Draco has no time to ask why it's not being conducted in the Head Auror's office if privacy is needed.
Voldemort had evicted Lucius and Narcissa from the master chambers to take up his own residence there. Almost funny, now, to think of Lord Voldemort needing a shower to wash away his semi-human stink after a long day of terrorism and murder, a toilet where he might sit too long contemplating his next evil plot and rise with tingling legs. A bed where he might perform the very vulnerable action of sleep. A dresser within which to keep his ubiquitous hooded black robes, perhaps ordered in bulk by Wormtail, because he could not imagine Voldemort taking the time to place an order with Twilfitt's. A footman, Voldemort had said, to help him prepare for bed or for the day. Draco's job during the occupation. There was nothing untoward about his time in Voldemort's chambers that had once been his parents', but Draco vividly remembers buttoning and unbuttoning Voldemort's robes, feeling his strange heartbeat under icy skin; pulling those robes onto angular shoulders or pushing them off; he remembers the numbness of his fingers at the fastenings of He Who Must Not Be Named's trousers, of all things. They had fastened at both sides of his hips, and Draco had counted it as a tiny, tiny blessing.
"I'm in my forties now. I don't want to hold grudges, even if they never heal. I don't want to hold onto the past."
Draco laughs. "Of course I want you. I want you madly, Harry. I sit at your table and dream of you pinning me to it. I go home to my flat and wish I hadn't."
"Yes, so. I felt bad, alright? I—" Harry swallows. Draco fights the urge to pull the teabag out of his mug—surely the tea is burning by now. "I just wanted to fix it. To make it up to you."
His first raid as a leader sees him and his team into a den of Dark Magic, the squalid air thick with red bolts as the criminals inside the house scatter. Their own wards, designed to keep them hidden from Muggles and wixen alike, keep them from Apparating out and Harry himself strikes many of them down. It's not until he reaches the center of the house—a house so easily hidden for being on a quiet Muggle street—that he sees what they were truly up to.
The truth of the matter is that even if Draco did want to "go to" Potter—and he does, desperately, despite having no idea how he might—there's no point of entry for him. It's not just that Potter has real friends. It's that Potter at the Ministry is entirely the same as he has been, which is to say a far cry from the curly headed man smiling under the moonlight. His hair is shorn, his words are clipped, and his face barely moves, with an expression so cold Draco might shiver under that gaze.
There are no more house elves in Malfoy Manor, either. Draco cooks his own meals, chopping vegetables and sautéing meat like a Muggle—by hand. He's purchased a few modified appliances to make the job easier—a food processor and a stand mixer, charmed to be able to work in magical homes—but they're poor replacements for cooking spells, which are still a distant second to elf-made food. Oh, and he's had to buy a refrigerator.
"Hermione!" Harry cries, as if she'd said some horrible slur. "Why would you say something like that?"
"No, you just didn't say it right, I know words!" Harry insists. "Stop being mean to me, Malfoy, I'm drunk."
He closes the cabinet firmly at the thought, though, and tells himself to ask Potter for tea when he comes back down.
The words rip at his throat until it feels raw, but he doesn't care. Two pairs of running feet are pattering in the corridor just out of sight, and he can't be seen like this. Not by Harry
"That would run the risk of seeing him in the atelier, and then you'd have to run this business on your own because I'd be in prison." She fixes him with a sharp look. "Here's another question—does he
He doesn't know what to do with Potter if he's not being snide and cruel, or more newly, working through the case of Venari Virtute. Snide and cruel comes easily to him, as much as being craven and duplicitous.
"Wait," Draco says, although he's not sure why, which means if Potter asks him why he should wait he's unlikely to have a satisfactory answer.
"Stupid," Draco tells himself again, plopping himself on a courtyard bench. It doesn't matter if he's in love with Harry. It doesn't matter if he thinks he had some grandiose artistic vision of "flaunting" that love by designing an impractical outfit that no one but Pansy and Fleur have even noticed, and only to mock it, and him by extension. Draco's brought him out of the bubble the pair of them existed in for the past months, and now he has to cope with the results. Perhaps Harry will still want to be friends, in the sense that he might send Draco an owl once or twice a year.
"I'm sorry," Harry says, and he puts his hand on the door knob of the back door. "I'm going to go now."
Draco doesn't know what to say. There's plenty running through his mind. That Potter had blasted through Ministry wards, that Draco could have been splinched. He wants to ask
Draco shows them his wand. When they react with mild horror, he explains that no, it's fine—Harry Potter has gotten the Trace taken off him for the time being. He can perform as much magic as he likes. And he shows them that, too.
"They're squash, how careful do you have to be? You'd have to chuck them against a brick wall to smash them."
" Draco says, and his wand takes a winding path through the air, so unlike the stabbing motion associated with its sister spell.
"We're just going to comb through your story," Potter says, "see it we can't pick out any new details."
"Can you—can you do that thing again?" Potter asks. Draco finally sees that his hand is still trembling, though not as dramatically as at the ministry.
Harry's breathing slows, evens out to the rhythm of Draco's circles; Draco finds himself doing the same. For several minutes, neither of them speak, both focused on Harry's hand.
Instead, Potter's hand pulls away from the knob, rejoining its compatriot behind his back as he looks at Draco with mild curiosity.
"You know, Draco," Pansy says, as Blaise excuses himself to the lavatory inside the manor and heads off, "Blaise and I have both noticed what a recluse you've become."
"I'm just—I'm not interested," Harry says, keeping his arm tight to his side. "Please don't ask me again."
The crowd falls silent, all heads swiveling to look at Draco, who suddenly wants nothing more than to be a blade of grass. Small, innocent, certainly not under the scrutiny of what feels like a thousand Weasleys and their cohorts.
Harry's curiosity supersedes his annoyance. "What did you do?" he asks, approaching Malfoy to get a better look at the ankle.
"Don't shout it out," Draco says, but he's starting to grin, too. He's got Harry in his sights, watching him talk animatedly with Weasley, Granger, and Luna Lovegood. "It's only been since Monday."
They lapse into a much easier silence as Draco finishes his work. Draco sets the last pin into the hem, finding the robe's perfect front length, and straightens with a groan.
He tosses the powder in, and the flames flash green. "Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry," Harry says, each word enunciated, and steps through, his robe trailing behind him.
