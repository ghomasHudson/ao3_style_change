“Anyway,” Harry checked the time and swallowed his guilt at having to leave, “I’m off. Can anyone find me the original plans of Malfoy Manor? It’s not urgent.”
Harry listens, fascinated. He imagines a small boy covered in sand, possibly wearing a sailor outfit with the most adorable hat to protect his delicate skin from the sun, beaming at his mum as they’re building a misshapen representation of Hogwarts. “You were happy,” he guesses.
Harry leaned back, pressing his back against Draco’s torso. “Maybe.” He lowered the heat under the pan and turned around, tangling his fingers in Draco’s hair. “How did it go?”
“So, not puff pastry then.
When he joins Harry in the dormitory afterwards, he knows his chest and neck are a bit flushed, and the heat of the water isn’t entirely responsible.
“Hey, sweetheart, what’s wrong?” As he pronounces these words, his brain is screaming at him because it’s a stupid question.
“If those tunnels split, no.
“Why would anyone listen in on you?”
Draco closed his eyes and basked in Harry’s affection. His left hand found its way under his shirt, and the feeling of Harry’s ring against his skin grounded him. He let out a sigh. “Yeah, I’m good.”
“Second year. Basilisk.”
Harry massaged his bruised ribs. “How many Galleons? Ron lost 8.”
It used to be quite a big deal for him before the Dark Lord fucked things up for everyone. When his housemates fooled around, when he walked in on Blaise and Tracey… it seemed like he’d die a virgin. Or be condemned to sleep with the woman his parents would force him to marry. During the war, nothing could be further away from his mind though, and now he’s just happy to be alive. He wants to blame Harry for reawakening his sex drive, but he also wants to thank him for winning and ruining his parents' plans for his future.
“You know your father; he’s pretending nothing has changed and struggles when it comes to our employed elves. As a result, they no longer obey him, serving him only when I request it. He also finds the time to take offence to insignificant details and rarely leaves his office.” She leant forward, grasped his hand and rubbed his skin with her thumb, then let go and drank a sip of her tea. “I am thrilled to see you, my darling. I shall invite the Greengrasses for dinner later this week. What do you think?”
No one visits the dungeons. Slytherin hasn’t had any visitors this year, even with the door wide open, and Draco wants to be surprised, but he’s not. When he thinks about it, he swallows the bitterness on his tongue and carries on. Sometimes, he finds refuge somewhere else, because perhaps they won’t be so reluctant if he’s away, but when he asks the portraits in the common room, they tell him no one dared.
Neither got sick during the ride; a miracle, for sure. But after going through the wards, Harry couldn’t help but think that if it hadn’t been so freaking cold, Draco would’ve fallen asleep right here and then. Harry held him close, and let him lead the way towards the boathouse, the snow cracking under their feet.
(Image: A potted plant with a single Christmas bauble dragging its tip down.)
“Ah, silly me, I didn’t notice.” Draco bends down and kisses Teddy’s hair. “Hi you. What’s all this?”
“Are you okay?” Harry asked, feigning concern. “I’d love it if you came with me to the Burrow for Christmas, but you don’t have to.”
Strangely enough, he did, and if the shuddering breath he let out was any indication, he must be in some sort of pain now. Harry’s memory of Madam Pomfrey’s most common spells kicked in, and he got to work. It helped that his adventures in the Forest of Dean were still fresh as well. A Diagnostic Charm revealed the depth of the gash, and it looked worse than it was. Harry did his best to clean the wound and numb it, and Transfigured a rock into a long (and slightly rigid) bandage, wrapping it around Malfoy’s thigh despite his protests (Malfoy seemed very reluctant to show his bare leg. Coming from such a poncy little prince, Harry wasn’t surprised).
"Many are from the Malfoy vaults or were gifted to me. The most expensive are Muggle, but there are some from my family vineyards in the same price range. We can open a bottle for Christmas."
quill, ink and parchment.”
Draco and Harry weren’t into some of the kinky fantasies Ginny and Pansy imagined. Hell, they didn’t even have sex that often, because Draco had zero interest in it. He didn’t mind it; he liked it, but if he spent his entire life without it, he truly wouldn’t be bothered. Harry was attracted to him like a moth to a flame, but he liked their intimacy better. It had taken some work, and many conversations about boundaries, body language, and consent, lots of trial and error, but now they worked together like well-oiled cogs in a machine. They loved each other; Harry couldn’t ask for anything better.
Draco puts an arm around his waist and they step outside under the Christmas lights decorating the pub. Harry breathes in through his nose. “Thanks.”
). He was also like a magpie collecting shiny objects: there was a display case in his living room with old trinkets that Draco had once seen on Dumbledore’s desk. But his most annoying trait, the one Draco would never understand, was sending Kreacher on holidays twice a year, likely seeking the Granger Seal of Approval. Draco knew it’d be a heated topic when he moved in, but he had given up arguing about it.
, Narcissa crosses her arms and stares at Draco, who feels very much on alert. “So. I read him a story about a hedgehog last night, and he believes that the spines are legs. He won’t hear reason. Do you, perhaps, have an inkling as to why?”
He doesn’t ask, but Malfoy goes on: “Before I invented this potion, I went to rehab. Dreamless Sleep addiction. Caught early, but it fucked me up. Luckily, it annihilated my marriage prospect with a reputable Pureblood girl, who is very lovely of course, but who liked the idea as much as eating a cactus.”
And that’s what happens.
He squashes his pride, stands up and attempts to walk, but he’s too weak and stumbles. Something’s wrong. He looks at the staff table; no one is paying attention because the
“Huh?” Ron wiped his mouth with his napkin.
Yes, but magic will fry anything with batteries, so Furbies are out.” And thank Merlin for that. Harry spotted the Star Wars Legos collection and pointed at the Death Star. “I’m getting that one for Teddy.”
The lobster was now on the table and Scorpius climbed on a chair. Earlier today during breakfast, Potter had Transfigured it so it would be higher without forcing the child to use a baby chair, like he often had to at the hostel. Draco served himself a cup of tea and sat next to him, enjoying the moment.
“You what?”
“Wha—no!” Many emotions passed on Malfoy’s face. “I—I can’t!”
Potter’s presence in the Slytherin common room becomes a regular occurrence. Draco understands that he seeks some peace and quiet, and outside of these moments, he starts observing him carefully. He’s done this for years, obsessively, learning about Potter’s favourite foods, his habits when he eats, the way his mood translates into the position of his quill on parchment. The biggest lie about him is that he’s spoiled. Anyone who has a functioning brain can see that his family is neither loving nor caring. He got better at hiding it, but Draco remembers the tiny, malnourished boy he met in Madam Malkin. He won’t forget how little he ate when he came back to Hogwarts, how the quantities increased slowly over time then diminished in June as he got ready to go home.
“’m not a baby!”
“Aww, that’s just sad.” Harry rubbed Draco’s ankle. He loved the softness of his skin.
"Thank you for trusting me with your darkest secrets." Harry made a show of bowing, his glasses almost falling into his empty plate. "Who stocked your cabinet, then? I don't know shit about wine, but even I have heard of some of those."
“No more bucket.”
“Yes. There’s something there.” He brought a hand close to its surface, not quite touching it. “The air vibrates. Why are you standing back there?”
A huffed laugh comes out of Malfoy’s throat. “I was well-behaved most of the time, I’ll have you know. Hey, my constellation is visible,” he points at the sky.
Harry barks a laugh, startling him because Draco has rarely heard him laugh so loudly. “Just got that money back, actually. Gringotts banned me from the building until I paid for reparations and the cost of the dragon.” Draco blinks at him in confusion. “Er, we freed the dragon they’d chained up in the bank.”
, of all things.
“I refuse to speak of this with Potty in the room!”
“Noodle and Pansy would get on fabulously. Gossip mongers, both of them.” Draco glared at the snake, then took a few seconds before continuing. “It doesn’t feel good to be in danger because of who I am. I figured you might’ve wanted to go home, after what Baalu told us.”
“So.” Charlie smacked his hands on his thighs, startling Harry and Draco. “Nice picture in the
His lab didn’t smell awful anymore. He peeked into his classroom and found it clean and safe. Good, he wouldn’t have to cancel his classes come morning. He turned on the MagiMusic player. (Yes, he had more than one, scattered where he usually dwelt. Yes, there was one in Potter’s quarters. No, Potter didn’t share his love for heart-wrenching, exquisite tunes—they made him
Transforming back into a man, Sirius shrugged. “I live to annoy you.” He’d taken the news of their time travelling shenanigans and their marriage with an equal amount of disbelief.
“You have no idea! He kept changing the password and would try to duel us, and he even let Sirius into the common room because he had the list of every password for the past few weeks, courtesy of Neville. He was proud of it, too.”
(Image: mistletoe)
“All right, I’m in. Do you remember the spell?”
“Everywhere else is warded. This place has a different type of security system, which means the Elves can’t hear us. I may also have mentioned the need to bring a bottle to Professor Flitwick, but Mother couldn’t use an owl for this.”
He takes a break and hears the door opening. He glances at it, expecting a fellow Slytherin, and loses his grasp on his quill.
Harry tightened his hold on the quill. “So, they’ll just find another way in a few months. Is there anything else I can do?”
Harry gaped at him, and his heartbeat sped up. Was he kidding? Could Harry trust his reading of Draco’s expressions, when he’d gotten them so wrong in the past? Yet, a few seconds after uttering these words, Draco’s skin flushed, and he attempted to hide it. So, Harry wasn’t wrong then. He swallowed, palms suddenly clammy. “I’d like that.”
“Ferret! Where the fuck have you been and why do you look so bloody old?”
Potter swallowed a bite. “The bell? Teddy painted it at school.”
It happens suddenly. They’re outside watching a meteor shower. It’s the first week of August; the evening is warm, the air smells like fruits and flowers and a bit like the nearby sea. Draco’s staring at the stars. The sky feels like it’s closing in on him, enveloping him in a soft embrace, and the stars get closer.
Draco’s heart leaps in his chest. It takes a second before he realises that he’s tall again, and Harry is grinning and squeezing his hands, and it’s his Harry, twenty-four years old and in love with Draco. They’re kissing before Draco can say anything, grasping at each other’s clothes and crying, and Harry takes Draco’s face between his palms and brushes Draco’s nose, cheeks and eyelids with his soft, slightly chapped lips. “I’m so proud of you. I love you so much, and you did it for me, you survived. I’ll never leave you again.”
Harry’s grin widens, and they shake hands.
“I’m not saying it didn’t affect me,” Harry replied with a shrug. It’d given him flashbacks of the cupboard under the stairs. He wanted to tell Draco how touched he was, but he’d always been terrible at talking about his feelings. “Thank you for worrying about me.” He let go of Draco’s wrist and bit his lower lip. “Feels like we need a drink. I’d toast to our life on the road.” Perhaps it was his imagination, but it seemed like they’d reached a new step in their friendship.
Some of Draco’s habits infuriated Harry; he clung to Harry like an octopus at night, threw fits if he found a stain on his clothes—but left messes everywhere because he’d never been taught to clean up after himself. Harry would only pick up dirty socks a dozen times before he started yelling. Kreacher helped, thank Merlin, but he shouldn’t have to. For a Slytherin, Draco had a strange concept of self-preservation, and Harry would find him experimenting with an open flame near flammable material, leaving his cigarette on the sofa and not checking if it was still burning, or gathering Bubotuber bulbs without gloves. He spent so long in the bathroom every day to achieve his looks (“it’s called négligé, Potter”) that Harry always had to use the bathroom downstairs, which was tiny and hosted a massive, purring Puffskein that watched Harry pee. But Draco was also funny, and sarcastic, and charming, and he brightened Harry’s life.
It’s January, but the students aren’t back yet. Harry still sleeps in Slytherin, but mostly in Draco’s arms now. He barely ever wakes up during the night; his nightmares are no longer a threat to his health, even if they still happen. He leaves early in the morning for his training, comes back for lunch, and they make out in-between essays and confessions.
“Is that for me?” he whispered, and the reptile nodded. Nervous laughter escaped him, but he quickly smothered it, fearing his family would hear. When he took the paper and read it, he could only blink, as if it would help shatter what must have been an illusion.
He ended up hugging the pillow to his chest and staring at the wall. Back in their time, he could spend hours daydreaming, content. This bed wasn’t comfy enough for that, but tomorrow, they’d live at Number 3, and their new bed would have an expensive mattress, luxury sheets… he couldn’t wait.
(See the end of the chapter for
Harry asks him to move in with him at the end of the school year, and Draco agrees.
“I’m not!”
Harry broke the kiss and fumbled with Draco’s pyjamas bottoms. “Fuck, let me—” He groaned. “Why are you wearing those?”
Those quick changes freak Draco out, honestly, but they’re also pretty funny. “So, Slytherin; what did you think?”
“Ruminating again?”
“It’s just—we were having fun. I enjoyed cooking with you.”
Harry knew that by now, but he still enjoyed hearing it. He smiled, suddenly shy.
He liked the Snargaluff pods and leaping toadstools, though. And the gnome. There was only one, but it seemed to live there now. Jim said that the Muggles couldn’t see the real garden and the real house, which was good, because when the gnome destroyed Aunt Petunia’s flowerbeds, she had no idea it came from Harry’s new home. Harry may or may not have thrown the gnome over the fence to see what would happen.
Reaching for his wand, which lay on the coffee table next to the scrying bowl, Draco hummed. “Same feeling?” He conjured a misty representation of the bubbly monstrosity Harry had seen with Professor McGonagall.
His best friend held a folded parchment with a proud grin, and Draco, who at some point had taken off his shoes and revealed green socks with moving snitches etched into the fabric, snickered and mock-glared at Harry. “What would you do without us, Potter? Come on, bring the Compass.”
“How was Iran?” asked Theo, who had ditched his dark robes for a style reminiscent of Professor Lupin’s. It was fitting for the librarian of the Museum, perhaps, and perfect for a young man who favoured lurking among dusty books and rejected his father’s teachings.
“Okay, so that gives us one week, and I don't know how we’re going to do this, but I’ll get enough people. I think.”
“Two apartments,” Lisa explains as she opens the door on the right.
Draco froze. “What?”
Fuck, now he was thinking about his crush. He pinched the bridge of his nose and stared at the ceiling. As if he’d read his mind, Warrington snapped his fingers.
Draco’s only real friends, Pansy and Greg, had tried to keep him from leaving at first. As he grew older, Draco became more distant with the people who reminded him of his mistakes, but those two stuck with him no matter what. Unfortunately, they had left England shortly after the war. In these quiet moments, when he was alone in a nearly silent room, a sad smile would find its way onto his lips, and he would wonder if they were happy. Now, the distance was much greater. His friends were nine years old here. He’d lost them because he chose to follow his husband.
And so, they came back at night, as unwise as it sounded. They left the safety of their tent under Harry’s invisibility cloak, and with a clear image of the brand new hole in mind, they silently Apparated away from the campsite. The salt flats gleamed like a geode under the moonlight. The temperature was pleasant compared to the heat of the sun, but unlike the nights in the Iranian desert, it was still too much to stop sweating. Hottest place on Earth indeed.
“Tony and Lisa are watching them.” Cho showed him a Galleon—and Harry’s smile turned more genuine. It was her DA coin. “Terry says his office is clear.”
“Kreacher?” Harry coughs, his voice sounds so raspy.
“Don’t fight,” Slytherin snapped. “You two haven’t changed much, have you?”
That sounded unsafe and stupid. The repressed Slytherin Harry liked to pretend wasn’t lurking in his mind was screaming at him. He had only listened to that part of himself during the summer when self-preservation was vital, and it had done its job in keeping him alive until now. Dealing with Malfoy didn’t appeal to him in the slightest, but neither was letting him bleed out in the exact spot Lockhart had stood before losing his memories. In all fairness, Malfoy wasn’t a threat any longer. He might never have been one. The Wizengamot had judged him for his part in the war, and if it weren’t for Harry, he’d be rotting in Azkaban. Harry didn’t think he deserved it. He also knew that Malfoy’s aggressivity this year was his way of protecting himself.
only shows you a vague direction. That one draws a line towards your target. It wouldn’t kill you to read a book, you know?”
Two instances of accidental magic in one day aren’t unheard of. After dinner, once Scorpius is asleep, and Slinky is dozing off in his cage like the lazy lump he is, Draco and Harry barely talk about what happened before finding a better use of their time. Harry has to be at Hogwarts early tomorrow, and Draco is still a little sore from last night, so they keep it simple and quick and fall asleep in each other’s arms.
He had been given his mission to kill Dumbledore and repair the Vanishing Cabinet in exchange for his mother’s life and knew he was doomed to fail. And then, he’d been seen crying by Harry bloody Potter, of all people, and it made everything so much worse.
They passed the curve of the tunnel and found a split straight ahead. Choosing to head left, they noticed carvings on the walls, most of them snakes. Harry hissed at them, asking for directions. They didn’t reply but turned their head as if indicating they were on the right track. Or sending them to their death. Malfoy hesitated, but Harry pushed him forward (and got his hand slapped in return).
“I thought it would just be bones,” Harry claims, walking closer to the creature. He touches its scaly head and gently rubs it, and Draco marvels at his strength. If that thing had come after Draco with the intent of eating him, the trauma alone would have forced him to stay far away from it.
Perhaps it was because this was technically Knockturn Alley and Harry’s presence here always attracted attention. Knockturn didn’t deserve its reputation. The less savoury, dark arts-oriented or disreputable establishments still thrived since the war, and hags and vampires favoured the place, but no, it wasn’t the dangerous hive of scum and villainy people described. Otherwise, Ginny wouldn’t be working there.
His fists clench as anger builds up inside him. Why can’t he be like them? Why does he have to flee every social event as soon as he’s able to? He doesn’t laugh at his friends’ jokes, he doesn’t dance or offer new rounds of drinks, he doesn’t even talk. It’s not like he has anything to say; he used to think he did, but he realised his friends would talk over him, so he stopped trying. He’s aware they weren’t doing it maliciously, and that he’s seeing too much into it, but he can’t help but think they’d be better off if he wasn’t there.
As the thought of the slow development of their relationship crossed his mind, he grinned, and with a spring in his step, he passed the threshold of Draco’s parlour.
Hermione leans over his shoulders from behind the couch when he unfolds the parchment. “Harry, who sent—oh.”
The title for this chapter and the previous one is from
Harry’s reflexes made him cast first.
They didn’t let go of each other. They bought a bag of chestnuts, and Harry burned his fingers, trying to peel one. Draco turned to face him and held Harry’s hand close to his lips. Harry felt like time had stopped.
“Very helpful, thanks ever so much, Potty,” he said with a sneer. “I’m not staying here. Mopsy!”
“I don’t mind.” Honestly, as if money was an issue. “You didn’t like the ham?”
With a slow blink, Draco ended his quiet admiration. Truthfully, he had no clue how Mother had made them, but he couldn’t disappoint his cousin. The climate spell would keep the statue from melting until it either malfunctioned or disappeared on its own at the end of March. “I guess we could make a snow dragon, cast
Of course, Harry snorted. He sipped his cocktail, eyebrows raised, as Draco peered at him.
“We don’t care.” Pansy ran a hand through her short hair and drank a sip of a bright orange drink, leaving the barest hint of cherry-red lipstick on the glass. “He only attracts people we want nothing to do with. Granger wanted to shut it down though.”
Sometimes, they still wake up screaming, startle at sudden noises or the sight of certain spells. No magic on earth can heal their minds with a quick flick of a wand, but they have each other’s support when things get dark.
Harry’s left eyelid twitched. He gave up on denying his feelings since it seemed the whole world knew. “What do you suggest? Would he expect a courting ritual?”
She muttered about Arithmancy, runes and the Marauder’s Map, to Harry’s growing confusion. He knew better than to disturb her in those moments; he stood up and tiptoed out of the room, heading back to the kitchen to fill the kettle and prepare a nice pot of tea.
Draco snuggled closer. “You picture us together in a year?” There was undeniable hope under a tone he was trying to keep casual, so Harry kissed his nose and rubbed his back, emboldened.
Prompt for this chapter:
Cho shook her head. “I know. I’m not proud of it. Anthony isn’t, either. We should have been helping Ron and Terry from the start—did you know they’ve been working on this thing since they finished their training?”
"I—sometimes I forget we're both rich. Okay. Christmas. Come with me to Andi's, bring your mum if she wants to."
“You saw something shiny and couldn’t wait to get your grubby hands on it!”
“I expect a reward.”
“I’m not sure I’d find a flat. No one would rent anything to me, or they would sabotage it.” A sneer transforms his features. “Theo went through that, and no one took him seriously when he reported it.”
Lavender winked. “You too, Harry!”
Potter seemed surprised. “Well, the usual. Respect my privacy, I’ll respect yours. Clean up after yourself. You can go everywhere, but you might want to keep Scorpius out of the fenced part of the garden. I grow potions ingredients. Fenced it because Thor loves digging.”
Longbottom and Ginevra flanked him, their wands pointed at Smith and his friends, who were still hammering on the wards.
“Remember what you said you’d show me if I was good?” Draco purrs, feeling the pull of a smirk at the corner of his lips.
Just as he got worried, Draco pushed his hand away and handed him a pointy shard of metal.
Draco huffs in response and holds out the candles. Harry duplicates them, and soon, they have enough light to read without straining their eyes. Draco drowns himself into his revisions, and Harry opens his copy of
“She wants to know if you keep me hostage.” She was part of the group of people who couldn’t get over Draco’s acquittal for a long time. After the elimination of the Dementors, she grudgingly agreed he wasn’t all bad, but she now acted like a nosy relative worried about Harry’s well-being despite having barely interacted with him for the entirety of Harry’s life. Hell, the longest conversation Harry had with her was an exchange of stilted greetings and well-wishes at Neville’s twentieth birthday.
Aah, the Weasel and his eternal grudges. If Draco cared, he’d hide his and Potter’s relationship from him forever to avoid a mental breakdown—but Draco didn’t mind burdening him with that knowledge. As they neared their one-year anniversary, keeping such a secret was becoming bothersome. “I can’t believe I’m about to ask that question, but what do you know about cucumbers?”
“I’ll be fine. Go back to sleep, P- Harry.”
Being stuck here was like having travelled back in time. The food was always from the Founding era; the clothes had belonged to people who’d been dead for a thousand years; there was no tea (to Malfoy’s horror) and no pumpkin juice. Then there was the privy, and the weird toothpaste (Freshening Charms only went so far), and the tub, and the lumpy bed, and so many things Harry’d never thought he’d ever see or use… Malfoy had had a harder time getting used to it. He must have missed his beauty routine, though Harry believed it hadn’t been a priority for him since sixth year. Not that Malfoy wasn’t attractive. With Slytherin’s nagging, he was also getting healthier.
Croaker continued working on his repair project, warning Harry that the entity might one day find another lantern to get out. Harry would deal with it when it happened, but it was no use worrying about it now. He intended on enjoying himself. Walks, shopping trips, visiting friends, taking Draco out for dinner, without having to interrupt anything, and run away. The Ministry even offered him his job back. Harry laughed and refused. He helped more of Draco’s customers and purged wider expanses of land without looking over his shoulder, and found it rather fun.
“MANGO JUICE!” Teddy shouted.
“I had my reasons.”
“Shut up.”
, his father’s voice echoes in his mind. As much as the idea of getting dirty makes him uneasy, it’s far from the shivers of disgust he used to get when he was younger. Getting covered in blood and forced to crawl and humiliate himself to entertain a monster fixed that for him.
“Did you like Andromeda’s tree, too?”
“Merci!”
“Adoption. It would take longer to organise, and I’d need to keep it quiet, but if you can both agree to shared custody, the kid will be protected for life.”
“Fuck,” Draco hisses, biting on Harry’s lower lip. He moves faster. The friction makes Harry’s head spin.
, thank you.
“Why would I need Polyjuice when I can do this?” Teddy turns into a carbon-copy of Professor Trelawney and points at Draco with a shaky finger. “I see your future, oh my poor boy!” They switch back to themself as Draco snorts. Teddy doesn’t change their appearance much aside from their hair. They enjoy looking like their parents too much.
Harry’s hands are unsteady. He hates this. He should be happy about the gifts, but if he lets go of his thoughts of Draco for a moment, he’ll lose it. His limit reached, he searches for Hermione’s gaze and tries to convey his emotions without speaking. He could lie about an emergency at home, but it would break Molly’s heart. She gathered so many people who are important to Harry, and they all brought him thoughtful presents. How egotistic is he? As he ponders an escape, Molly herself brings him back from his turmoil by raising her voice:
It lasts until Harry asks if taking that potion before a speech would help with nerves, or if it’d make him too drowsy. As much as he tries to bury his head in the sand when it comes to his supposed obligations, there’s one upcoming speech he can’t avoid, and it’s the one he dreads the most. Now that it’s back at the forefront of his mind, he finds his body tensing. He glares at his feet when Malfoy doesn’t reply instantly, and when he does, the edge in the other man’s voice shows he’s walking on eggshells.
“I know a good artist,” Malfoy replies. “Let me know.” Loki clicks his beak. “What time is it, anyway?” He casts
Draco’s words came out a little choked up as he asked why she was here, why she hadn’t told him she was visiting.
Draco tilts his head and looks at the cucumber closely. It does have a rather phallic silhouette, now that he pays attention, and his mind latches onto Harry’s words. “Think you need to?”
Harry’s stomach twisted in horror. “You think he’s going for Scorpius.”
The elf, always ready to get away from the kitchens, popped in front of them and bowed. “Is Mistress Cissa’s graceful baby boy wanting something?”
And Draco needed him too, desperately, which was the reason he’d followed him into the past. To fix things. For their tiny selves. Too bad they’d miscalculated and landed almost a decade off their goal.
Standing by Draco’s side, Harry crossed his (not that muscular!) arms on his chest, and to Draco’s surprise, didn’t say a word. He didn’t yell at the woman or step between her and Draco to protect him. This wasn’t the righteous Golden Boy who’d irked Draco so much at school, the chivalrous defender lauded in the
Harry lets go of his arm, which he’s been holding a little too long. “Did you have plans? Mine are ruined.” Harry wanted to spend some time at the beach — there’s a small one he could Apparate to. It’s not accessible through land, and that makes it perfectly quiet. The town is a popular holiday destination and at the moment, it’s quite crowded. Harry might be feeling better, but it doesn’t mean he has the strength to mingle with hundreds of people.
That evening, the place was quiet, its wall sconces casting long shadows and soothing Draco’s nerves, alight after Apparating near a disapproving crowd. He spotted his friends, ordered a Mojito at the bar and slid into an open space on the banquette seat once served. Blaise greeted him with a wink and raised his glass.
“Call me Draco, we’re beyond that.”
It was Draco’s turn to stare at him with wide eyes. “You would?”
The door on the left was open and showing an incredibly messy room that obviously belonged to Potter. He smirked, but his old self’s unhealthy need to mess with the Boy-Who-Lived didn’t rear its ugly head. Instead, he left it alone and opened the other door.
He blinks. That’s three gifts in one. The first one is a freaking stuffed dragon, or rather a fluffy ball with bulbous eyes, tiny wings and a long tail. It’s purple and green and absurd. Draco checks that Harry isn’t observing him and squeezes it. It shouldn’t be that comforting. He loves it instantly. Keeping it in his lap, he focuses on the lovely pair of gloves next. They’re quite tasteful, and he can tell they’re both expensive and sturdy.
The child glared at the owl, whose unimpressed hoot reminded Harry of Hermione when someone tried to find an excuse for being late. “Grandma always says wasting food is
“I may well become a believer in fate, Snakelings.”
She relaxed her posture and smiled. “Of course. A simple
Still, he worded his vow carefully, swearing to attempt to stop the bleeding in the next few minutes. It was too risky to say anything else. He offered his best impression of innocence in response to Malfoy’s affronted snarl.
If he could, Draco would revive the Dark Lord and kill him himself to take revenge. For his situation, his family’s, those who died - friends or foes - and for his House’s reputation. Salazar Slytherin might not have been an angel, though historians contradict themselves and no one knows what he believed, no matter what they claim, but Voldemort destroyed the honour of wearing silver and green. Draco struggles to be proud of anything nowadays. He detests the man for it.
Malfoy paid heavy war reparations, and while he’s still rich compared to the Weasleys, losing access to his familial vault was part of his sentencing. Harry doesn’t remember how long that’s supposed to last, but apparently it’s still enforced. Narcissa is in France now, living with family. If he’s still an apprentice, Malfoy doesn’t earn enough to rent a broom cupboard in London, and if he lives in the Manor alone, it must take a toll on his mental health.
Noodle found a ray of sunlight to bask in. Harry observed the metal piece in the box, now open on the ground. “So. Any idea?” he asked.
Going to Muggle London was always an interesting adventure—and a giant toy store? Draco was intrigued. But why groceries? Didn’t Kreacher do the shopping?
“Daddy! Daddy! Tis snowin’! Daddy!”
“There you are, sir! One vanilla latte, and one hot chocolate with hazelnut syrup, whipped cream, cinnamon, vanilla beans, chocolate shavings and roasted nuts.”
Draco straddles him as soon as he sits on his bed. Snogs the life out of him. Harry keeps breaking the kiss and asking if it’s okay, if he wants more, and Draco moans and grinds his hips down on him. Harry’s hard and burning hot in his shaky hand, and the wet spot on Draco’s trousers is getting larger. He sucks on Harry’s tongue, licks into his mouth and groans at the friction when a palm presses against his cock and finally frees it from its confinement. Harry tugs, Draco rolls his hips. A thumb slides under his foreskin and he bucks.
“Let’s buy Number 3 and move in.”
I'm overwhelmed by all your amazing comments! I'll reply at the end of the month when I finish posting, but in the meantime, thank you!
While he thinks about assassinating the person who sent him the message, he still takes the time to read it.
“Great.” Harry took a bottle and read the pompous description at the back, then put it back on the rack. He fought against the growing unease that threatened to overwhelm him each time Malfoy’s treatment at the hand of their schoolmates was mentioned. Harry was tired of fighting and hoped others would have the decency to leave the Slytherin alone, but Malfoy was like a magnet for everyone’s anger. Not necessarily unjustified, true, but Harry wished everyone would simply ignore him instead.
Ah. Siege wards. Sensing aggression, lasting longer if there was animosity within them, able to seriously injure those who might be a threat to the beings within. A fantastic system against traitors.
By sheltering him, Malfoy gave Harry long-lasting protection in a house Harry didn’t despise. Only the strongest entities like the one that had chased him down were still able to harm him; living in that house meant Harry’s existence was shrouded from the weaker ones. But it also allowed Harry to use his ability to see entities to help others, which satisfied his Saviour Complex (which he grudgingly agreed he possessed). While Harry did run errands, he only did it because—well, because that was kind of what a couple did for each other.
An owl slams into them and they jump apart. “HOOT!”
It was the right thing to do.
Harry took some of this peace and wrapped it around himself like a shroud when he Apparated to the alley beside the Ministry. He needed it to prevent any accidental flare of power that could see him on the front page of the Prophet.
Warm hands slid around his waist and lips pressed a lingering kiss on the back of his neck. Instinctively, Draco canted his hips, enjoying being the little spoon. Harry always knew when he was a bit too nostalgic.
“Do you think we can do it? Me and Malfoy, just, get away from all the bullshit, live our lives the way we want to? Be free?”
“Let me know if you need to leave,” Hermione whispers in his ear, before letting go.
He was frustrated that the carvings on the wall hadn’t been directing them towards an exit, but at the same time, he was relieved. It was odd to feel so much weight lifting off his shoulders just because Malfoy had lost his shroud of misery. Harry had never seen him genuinely carefree, and he found himself thinking he wanted to commit that smile to memory.
The week before Christmas exhausted Draco more than the first few nights in the shitty Muggle tent in Iran; everyone wanted to see him, he still had some last-minute shopping to do, and Mother required his assistance to set up a temporary exhibition on magical plants. Draco headed to Hogwarts to speak with Longbottom and wrestled with an escaped baby Devil's Snare, then was invited to stay for the evening meal in the Great Hall when the Headmistress saw him. He didn't remember how, but he'd then gotten drunk with Hagrid, of all people, and woke up on the couch in Longbottom's quarters with the world's worst hangover.
It was where the small sailing boat and the gondola were stored, but also where their human warden, a Squib who’d been killed by the Dark Lord, had been living. He’d taken care of the plants around the property for as long as Draco could remember. He’d also been civil when Draco had shown him nothing but disdain and had messed around the boathouse to annoy him.
Draco takes the first step inside and Harry follows close behind. The entrance is snug and leads directly to a staircase. Lisa gives the general dimensions of the upper floor as they climb, and once they’re gathered upstairs, she gives them a tour, blabbering about the ideal location, the quiet, the lack of traffic, the friendly neighbours, things that should be important but that Harry tunes out. The stairs open on a square room painted in white, with beautiful wooden floorboards. Facing North-West, above the entrance, two rooms offer a fantastic view of the sea. Facing South-East, though, is the heart of the home. The bathroom is quite classy, all in dark grey tiles, but it’s the sitting room Harry falls in love with. Round black stones cover a portion of the wall, and it looks lovely against the white paint. The same stones adorn the kitchen which shares its dark theme with the bathroom. A door in the corner reveals another staircase, this one leading down to the large garden below. The harbour is visible from there as the house stands on a rather thin strip of land, and Harry thinks the location couldn’t be more perfect. He looks back at Draco, who is standing in front of the widest window with a soft smile on his face.
” had been left on the table, and “
Harry had no idea how to describe this place. How could it fall under the radar so much? Why hadn’t he ever heard of it before? The otherworldly beauty of sulphur ponds, salt formations, geysers and bubbling pools of acid took his breath away. Natural chimneys let out white fumes, the ground was scorched and scarred, going through every shade of brown, yellow and green. The colours were so bright! The wind was burning Harry’s face, and he believed that those fumes might not be entirely healthy: most of the Muggles wore masks.
“Please never listen in on us when we’re locked in the bedroom!”
Oh, so that was why Draco had received a note at breakfast inviting him to get drunk after work. Harry wondered if Draco would be wise enough not to Apparate with alcohol in his blood. “I’m so happy for you!” He saw some tension on her face, so he added, “if you need anything, let me know. We’re not letting you go through this without us! Right, Ron?”
He snorted; he had been getting ready for many questions, but this was not one of them. “You know, she thinks that name is hilarious now.” He almost laughed at his housemate’s expression. “When we were together, her entire family was grieving Fred and I avoided the Burrow because some of them could be cruel to me. Telling me that your trial was like I spat on Fred’s grave. Gin hated it. She came to live with me. They were pressuring her to marry me, because living together was just not proper without a ring on her finger. Anyway, we just fell out of love. Ended it together, decided to stay friends and keep being roommates, because why not. Her family wouldn’t listen when she told them she wasn’t with me anymore. They didn’t believe us, because why would we be living together otherwise? One day, we went on a double date, the Prophet got involved and all hell broke loose. That’s when I left London.”
Unsure of what to say, feeling both intrigued and wary, he watched as a yet unseen side of Malfoy revealed itself to him. His arch-enemy was almost bouncing with excitement, eyes alight, skin flushed. It was a surreal experience after the darkness of the war and all they’d both been through. Malfoy went from barrel to sack, from sack to basket, over and over again, revealing their contents like an archaeologist who’d just discovered a hidden city. Rye, mead, dried meat and fish, cabbage, wheat, cherries, garlic, honey, cider—and in a corner, Roman amphoras with imported wine. Malfoy grabbed an apple and bit into it, grimacing a bit. It was probably sour.
“Blimey! No way! But how? No, wait, I don’t want to know.” He leaned over her side of the table, looking for something, and frowned. “You’re so thin!”
The elf appears and peers at him. “Harry Potter needs to drink his tea and get ready for the speech Harry Potter hates to make. Harry Potter can go home afterwards.”
Older Harry didn’t say a word until Harry calmed down, and when he did, he just offered him a tissue. Harry had been forced to be strong, mocked for showing emotions, so he had built walls around his heart—and his older self had just shattered them. If older Harry looked like this, then things must have gotten better for him, right? Hope, so often squashed all these years, flared in his chest, bright and burning.
He didn’t bother with an envelope. Who cared, at this point? “Regulus, wake up.”
Draco ducks his head as his cheeks take on a rosy tint, and Harry’s heart sings.
Harry laughed and kissed Draco’s cheek. “He married little Draco, too.”
“I don’t see why it wouldn’t work.” Malfoy enunciates each word slowly. “Why are you going?”
Potter narrowed his eyes, and Draco knew just what he was thinking. Heir of Slytherin and familial link to the Dark Lord—those weren’t things Draco could make fun of.
He’s allowed to leave the infirmary if he takes it easy; he’s told it was a very near thing, his death, and Harry has already written to his mother to tell her he’s awake. She can’t visit, she’s still on house arrest.
“No way. But since you made me wear that stupid Santa hat, you, boss, will take care of Minitree for the season!
ran a tragic story of forbidden romance that began in their fifth year, complete with quotes about “intense, burning passion” and “all-consuming obsession”. Romilda Vane is to blame for those. Once Draco’s vaults were released from the Ministry’s clutches, Harry gave the key of their two-stories house to Ginny, and they bought a sprawling beach-front property in Pegwell Bay. People are convinced they’ve eloped, and they’re front page news at least once a week. Merlin forbid they go anywhere with Teddy if the kid decides to turn into a mini-version of them. As a Marauder-in-training, he does it on purpose. Their friends find endless entertainment out of it, and Harry isn’t even that bothered anymore.
He knew the moment it noticed him watching that it wasn’t something he’d ever heard of. The figure divided itself like the cells in Harry’s primary school biology book, only to reform and grow until it towered above the graveyard like a mass of rolling, bubbling clouds. Holes opened all over its body and shifted into crescents, like dozens of grinning mouths. Harry quickly found out it was only visible to him. A worried Minerva side-along Apparated him to Hogsmeade, convinced the shock of the war made him hallucinate.
“No thanks, you’ve left enough of them on me.” Malfoy tilted his chin up, nose in the air. “You didn’t answer me earlier.”
“I’ll have to wait until your climate spell melts that snow,” Harry said in an attempt to appear competent, and not like a drooling mess. He gestured at the expense of land. “Do you want to let magic create a home, or give it specific instructions?”
“You know, this is much simpler than it seems,” Blaise said with a small smirk. “Draco isn’t Hermione. As surprising as it may sound, he won’t need you to prove your intelligence and organisational skills. Thank Merlin, because we all know you’d suck at it.” His smirk widened at Harry’s outraged hiss. “Draco will want to spend time with you. Don’t go out of your way to impress him, because you’ll look stupid. He knows you, so believe me, you should be yourself.”
Potter grinned. He looked well-rested, which was a good look on him and wasn’t a common occurrence. Draco wondered if the Chamber prevented nightmares. If so, he might just start living there. Permanently.
“Go where? Potter—”
“You don’t like pool.” It’s kind of odd. Harry has no issue picturing Malfoy playing it.
Harry smirks and shakes his head, muttering something about Slytherins and smart cookie - Draco doesn’t know what that last one means but it doesn’t sound negative. He’d rather be a cookie than a ferret.
Theo is looking at him and Draco, and rolling his eyes. “Pans, they’re being cute again,” he grits out with a disgusted expression. In response, Draco kisses Harry’s cheek, and Pansy throws her arms in the air and declares she’s not getting involved this time.
“Just don’t advertise in the
A groan escapes Harry’s throat, convincing Hermione that she guessed exactly what was going on, and Harry is waiting for that inevitable sensation of being cornered, trapped, and misunderstood. It doesn’t happen.
“Everything here is yours. These books were mine when I was at Hogwarts. I want you to decorate this room as you please. If you want toys, books, anything, let me know, and I’ll get them for you. At first. Afterwards, it’ll be for birthdays and special occasions.”
When he’d voiced his opinion to Slytherin, who visited the small frame in his room shortly after Potter and Draco parted ways, he’d been told how throwing Squibs out of families, forcing them to join the Muggle world, was just as bad as welcoming Muggleborns and letting them leave again without taking a Vow of Secrecy. And it made him think.
Draco sniffed, nose in the air. He hid it well, but Harry could always see right through him. Secretly, Draco was delighted that his mini-him (not so mini anymore) had seen the light and said yes to a triad marriage. Mother was ecstatic, and Father had reluctantly agreed to have the ceremony on the Manor’s grounds. This version of Draco had made him age prematurely by getting a Muggle degree and collaborating with Hermione on the Wizarding Space Project.
“Forgive me for asking, but why do you wear that thing?” He gestures at his body.
Draco frowns. His eyes feel itchy, and there’s something stuck in his throat.
“Do I need to check you for signs of Obliviation?”
— And there was sunlight, and no more liquid, and an intake of fresh air. Harry registered Draco’s panicked voice without understanding his word, too busy staring at the freshly cut grass he was kneeling on. He coughed, wheezed, and tried to control the violent shivers wracking his body. The lantern had been smashed to pieces, and a thin shard of glass had embedded itself in his palm. He yanked it out.
Draco lasted another night, but he woke up with a runny nose, a fever, and a throat so sore he could taste blood on his tongue. The mattress hurt his back, and he tried to find a more comfortable position, groaning in discomfort. Buried under a mountain of clothes and an old quilt, he couldn’t find the strength to get up and go to work. Sure, he could drink some Pepper-Up, but he could also pretend he didn’t have any. The boathouse was sapping his energy.
Square one being that night, three months ago, in 2010. Draco had wanted nothing else but go to sleep after an admittedly brilliant blowjob when Harry had rushed back into the room, stark naked, his toothbrush in hand.
The Malfoy vaults are currently locked for the duration of his mother’s punishment. Draco cannot get control over them until he’s 25, because his father is still alive - and because the Ministry finds it convenient. He can’t bear the thought of living at Malfoy Manor anymore. He knows the Wizengamot didn’t appreciate Harry’s testimony, so they will be looking into legal ways to make his life difficult after Hogwarts.
“I apologise for the lack of food; the magic in the Chamber still thinks it’s the tenth century. I had to pull some strings so it would serve breakfast.”
He was reminded of Kreacher’s absence when his stomach let out a loud and undignified growl as he was sprawled on the couch, enjoying Harry’s fingers toying with his hair. He sighed and squirmed, then met Harry’s amused gaze and rolled his eyes. “Yes, Potty, I’m starving.”
over it, then Vanish the snow.”
“That I’m a burden to them? No bloody way. Who were you supposed to marry?”
Harry folded the parchment and put it back in the envelope, then smiled at Teddy. “It’s from your cousin.”
The rock moved, but not enough, so Malfoy cast the same spell and held it. They were both powerful wizards, so the strain on their magical core was minimal. Once the cloud of dust had dissipated, Harry kneeled and stared at the uneven hole, just wide enough to fit a human being.
The man's grin turned positively shark-like.
It’s summer when he goes back to work, and it takes a few days before he’s assigned desk-duty for reckless behaviour. He drowns his sorrow in endless, unresolved cases. He accepts the Weasel’s company in the quiet corner of the cafeteria where he sits to flee the noise—Draco’s very sensitive to the outside world now. The Weasel needs some peace, too. They leave the Auror department on the same day, without having planned any of it. Granger invites Draco for dinner, but that’s Draco’s limit.
“Fuck!” Lavender interrupted them mid-giggle, almost falling off her chair. “I’ll be late!” She grabbed her belongings and the file she needed and rushed outside.
Then, at last, Hogwarts had removed his Mark, neutralising the spell that would have turned his organs to stone. He hadn’t thought it was possible. He’d been told attempting a removal would kill him in the most painful way possible—and he’d believed it because the Dark Lord would have found it entertaining.
“Not at all, I enjoy the feeling of melting ice on my skin. It’s good for my complexion.”
Draco’s memories of what happened are blurry. He can’t feel his body, aside from an odd tingling sensation in his hands, but when he slips out of his half-dreamy, half-conscious state and realises he’s still alive, he gasps. That’s when he hears it. Potter’s voice. Calling his name, calling him
“Yes, the third-wheel, the lonesome prince, the cursed beauty, the mad genius—”
“They look kinda like stars, but they move.”
“Well, I am the only one who can issue these papers and they’re reserved for abuse cases.”
. “I’m pretty sure you know him, yeah. It’s Draco.”
The man told him the truth about his parents, about why he lived with his horrible family, about a school called Hogwarts, about magic. Harry cried like he’d never cried before. Held tightly in a pair of strong arms, he let go of everything and didn’t feel a hint of shame. The man was him, after all. He must have cried, too.
Scorpius comes back just as Mother recommends Cyprus for their next outing. So far, her ideas have been a success, so Draco adds that one to his great Wooing Potter list. It’s a work-in-progress.
“You’re going down, Malfoy!”
“I’m sorry.” And he was. He clung to Draco, unwilling to let go, until Draco mentioned ice cream, because when Draco was uncomfortable or emotional, he craved sugar. That hazelnut flavour he bought yesterday woke his hunger. “Let’s go home.”
“I’m a painting. I don’t know. But I do know you cannot leave it here.”
Harry rubs circles on Draco’s back. “I Floo-called her. She was busy, so she sent a note back.” He smiles and kisses Draco’s nose, and Draco melts into his arms against his will. “Yes, I made sure Scorpius wasn’t in the room, and I put the powder back in the safe. He didn’t even sneeze.” Harry is probably looking out for any of Draco’s dramatic reactions when it comes to allergies. It’s insulting; Draco is not
.” A flash of light forced him to close his eyes. When he looked again, the leeches were gone, but the atmosphere hadn’t changed. That meant more nests to find.
He’d fucked off to Scotland shortly after.
Harry put his shoes on the rack instead of leaving them across the floor, and hung his coat on a hook sculpted like a screaming ghoul. He brought the drinks in the parlour and left them on the table, before heading upstairs to check the master bedroom and en-suite bath. Kreacher was nowhere to be seen.
Their food arrived, and Ron devoured his shepherd’s pie like a man starving because some things never changed. Hermione had ordered her usual fare but without the alcohol this time. Harry almost choked on his fried mushrooms.
“Grandma, what the
From the living room, Sirius swore and yelled at them: “I hate both of you. I am not a peacock, and I don’t want to be Snivellus’ colleague!”
Twenty minutes into the tour of the Manor grounds, Harry duplicated his gloves and handed them to Malfoy. If Harry didn’t know any better, he’d say Malfoy was all right with this situation, but of course, he wasn’t, he just pretended it didn’t bother him. Draco Malfoy would never enjoy living in a bloody hovel. At first glance, it shared similarities with the Burrow, but only on the surface. It reminded Harry more of Hagrid’s humble abode, but at least the things in the jars were dead. He hadn’t expected something so miserable when he’d Apparated, and he worried for Malfoy’s health if he stayed there any longer. Sure, warming charms existed, but they only lasted so long. Malfoy had looked so thin and pale in his oversized jumper that Harry had wanted to bundle him up and force him to sit in front of a roaring fire. Merlin, he was turning into Molly Weasley.

Harry raises both hands in surrender, letting go of his tie. He steps back and sits on what would be Theo’s bed had the boy returned (Draco lives alone in the dorms, but the usual number of beds are there anyway). It’s where he’s apparently decided to sleep tonight. “You’re still weak.”
“Ah, not tired enough to lose your snark?”
He did need the bathroom, though. Perhaps, if he ran, the covers would still be warm when he came back. Warming Charms were not the same and they made his skin itch when he cast them himself.
They walk down into the dungeons as Harry explains he’s not very keen on spending time away when a friend is on his own in the castle, after having narrowly escaped death. Draco bites back some retort about not needing pity, because there’s that word again, and Harry’s holding his hand and not letting go. The truth hits him and takes his breath away.
Mouth set in a grim line, he nodded. Their little boy wouldn’t meet the Dark Lord this year.
Draco had never met a Muggle before. He’d never even
Draco knows that; as a teacher, Harry is allowed inside, and he spilt the secrets of every House in a letter a week after he took the job (he also reported finding Draco’s bed and the engraved “Potter Stinks” on the bedpost). “Of course you do. No one else could be trusted with weapons. The Ravenclaws would try to study the sharpness of the blade, and can you imagine what would happen with the Gryffindors?”
Harry catches his lower lip between his teeth and pushes Draco against the tree.
It was positively maddening.
Salazar was a wise man, even if Draco didn’t appreciate his every word. He was a wizard who’d been directly affected by the fear, intolerance, and cruelty of Muggles, yet still allowed Muggleborns into Hogwarts. “They’re in more danger than you, little Malfoy,” he’d said. And they were. He saw that now.
It’s Mother who decides to take him home, to where she’s living now, in the South of France. It’s a castle rising above lavender fields and a vineyard, and it doesn’t remind him of Harry at every corner. Draco eats little and sleeps his days away, locked in dreams where he’s laughing in Harry arms, where Harry brings him flowers and where they race on their brooms until they reach the sun.
Draco’s delight hypnotised Harry.
Their relationship, now two years old, is almost a running joke, because everyone thought they were already dating in secret by the time they moved into their first house. The
Teddy’s disgusted groan could be heard nearby, and of course, Cassius bloody Warrington muttered something about blackmail material and Draco’s dignity.
“What about school?” School meant Dudley. It meant teachers who thought he was lazy, who blamed him for every little thing.
Grinning, Harry relaxed even more. He could see that Malfoy’s eyes kept darting at the pictures on the walls and he imagined he must have many questions; he wasn’t sure if he should just talk and hope it would encourage him to speak and ask whatever he wished, but he guessed Malfoy wouldn’t share information willingly if Harry didn’t say anything first. So, he broke the ice.
“That’s good. I’m not bad at it either. We can take turns. I use magic to clean, most of the time, so stuff mostly washes itself. If— if you want to use a wand, the Ministry won’t know it’s you.”
“I’ll think about it.”
The sight of the room made him wish he’d chosen that one as his own space instead of selecting Sirius’. The bedding had been changed from its old-fashioned flowery style and was now pure white. Kreacher had swapped the heavy velvet curtains for a translucent fabric and had bought new candles, and the tapestry had been stripped to reveal dark wooden walls.
.” He leaned forward and put the sandwich on the nearby desk. “Okay. Smith. Fuck. What’s going on?”
“Perhaps, but it means spending time with me.”
Harry bristled. “Draco Malfoy is not abusing his son.”
“Kreacher heard Masters complain about being too hot, so Kreacher

”. Harry’s heart filled with a dizzying warmth as he remembered Draco meant to get that picture developed weeks ago. It was both of them napping outside with baby Pygmy Puffs all over their clothes. When Pansy visited, she had a tendency to snap pictures of them with Draco’s beloved camera.
. Draco felt like a bubble of hysterical laughter was about to burst in his throat.
“Yes! The stakes rose every year!”
“Not sure what I expected,” he mutters to himself and Harry laughs. That may be a completely private place, but there’s no way they’ll ever have sex down there.
He talks about how it makes him feel when he’s surrounded, how he’s disconnected from everybody’s lives, and needs her to understand his boundaries. He tells her he doesn’t know who he is, or where he’s going, but he’s working on it, step by step, and sometimes he leaps backwards. He moves on to his symptoms, how they fluctuate so much he will keep avoiding the whole world sometimes and doesn’t want to be judged for it. Hermione keeps wiping her tears with her sleeve, but she doesn’t utter a sound. Heart hammering in his chest, Harry explains what happened with Draco. He expects worry, perhaps a question about his sanity, or at least if he’s sure, and is once again surprised when it doesn’t happen.
After putting on a robe that had belonged to Regulus Black, according to the delicate letters etched on the inner pocket, he exited the bathroom in a cloud of vapour. He followed the scent of warm bread, sneering in distaste at the dark green tapestries plastered on the wall of the stairs. They were just as foul in the morning light.
Harry hums, gaze riveted on his work.
Draco’s lips formed a pout. “No, I can do it.” He’d make the best damn quiche in the whole world and Harry would never see it coming. That’d teach him to doubt Draco’s abilities. “Just read the recipe to me.”
“What about cleaning and cooking?” At Harry’s raised eyebrows, he rolled his eyes. “I can do both. I’ve lived as a Muggle long enough. Turns out cooking is a bit like potions.”
“Of course, it is. Perhaps we’ll even witness a Slow Comet.”
As the wind picks up and chills the air, he clears his head and brings Teddy back inside to dry him off and dress him. Draco stays in the garden a bit longer, but he’s there to greet his aunt when she comes for Teddy shortly before dinner.
The Weaselette answered one of his silent questions, nodding at the pictures of the toddler. “This is Teddy. Harry’s godson.”
Draco didn’t make any gesture indicating that Harry should let go. “I guess I’m just—nevermind.”
Oh! He had so many questions, now that he knew his parents hadn’t been drunks! He fidgeted, and older Harry chuckled.
Harry opens the door to the basement when the trunk almost crashes into him (Draco flicked his wand and he didn’t do it on purpose, he swears). Teddy used to have a nice room upstairs, but when they visited for Christmas in their first year at Hogwarts, they claimed the basement as their own. It’s like having their own apartment, and Teddy doesn’t mind living underground, so Harry and Draco agreed and turned that space into Teddy’s home. It has a private bathroom, too. Draco brings their trunk down the stairs, Harry on his heels.
Draco looked up and readjusted his woolly hat. He looked cute with it. “I’d love to walk a little if that’s all right.”
“I need to see you—” Draco gasped as Harry slammed into him faster, pulled out, flipped him around and slid back inside in one long, slow, agonising movement. Draco yelped, his spent cock laying against his stomach. “
Their initial idea was to go back in time and prevent Snape from hearing the Prophecy. The consequences of this, however, would have been too significant. In 1981, Voldemort was winning the war, so if he never went after the Potters, he wouldn’t be defeated. As much as it had pained Draco to tell Harry that saving his parents wasn’t possible without taking huge risks, they had to think rationally.
“I think it’s romantic.” Lavender leaned forward with a dreamy smile, and Harry sputtered. “Oh, don’t deny it, you’ve been pining for years!”
The sight of him sat on Draco's favourite, expensive furniture was enough to make him giddy. Harry gave him a soft smile. "I'm fine now, and tea would be great. Thanks."
Draco's breath caught in his throat. His crush was out of control, and he had to do something soon, or he'd go insane.
Eager to know more about what was happening, even if it was a dream, Harry sat on the floor and let the snake crawl into his lap.
Minitree!”
No matter what, Draco was grateful.
Draco stepped inside the empty house. He glanced to his left, saw the cupboard and immediately destroyed it, leaving the whole area under the stairs empty. He heard Harry snort and turned around to find him grinning like a loon and looking up at the ceiling.
“Thanks for getting me out.”
was just delivered. There’s no choice. He opens his mouth to ask for help, but before he can utter a sound, strong arms wrap around him and steady him.
Harry huffed and crossed his arms, but changed his mind when he nearly lost his balance. He climbed down from the barrel he was sitting on, still glaring at Malfoy, who was busy trying to call random House Elves.
“For what it’s worth, I apologise,” Draco murmurs, almost too quietly.
Rolling his eyes, Harry carefully moved closer, having spied blood under Malfoy’s torn trousers. Of course, the prat would call for an elf—but none came. Malfoy tried again, and Harry joined in, asking for Winky (his heart constricted painfully: his first thought had been to call Dobby). He’d gotten out thanks to Fawkes last time, so perhaps House Elves couldn’t come down here? The bird didn’t appear either.
There was a whooshing sound, and the door of the cottage shot open. Unwilling to tear his gaze away from his enemies but terrified that someone else had found the Floo password, Draco turned slightly to the right, just enough to see the intruder—and to almost weep in relief.
He won’t. Seeing her brings back too many things he’d rather forget.
“Scared, Potter?”
Draco gave him a pointed look. “I can’t stop you. Deal with Salazar on your own once he finds out.”
(See the end of the chapter for
Drinking a few drops of cider, Harry scratched his neck, a small amount of guilt gnawing at him. He’d often celebrated at Hogwarts or Andromeda’s house, ever since Hermione and Ron’s divorce. Molly had been too vocal about her disapproval of Morag at first, so Harry had fled the awkward dinners and side-glances, unwilling to go through the “Bill and Fleur debacle” all over again. It hadn’t helped that Ron and Morag had started dating only a week after the divorce, with Hermione’s blessings. After the birth of Sorcha in 2006, Morag had been welcome at the Burrow and was now close with her mother-in-law. Still, Harry didn’t go back every year. This time, he and Draco might be too busy wandering the globe to even think about it, but if they came home, Harry would likely stay at Andi’s. Teddy’s grandmother couldn’t visit the Burrow: she’d never recovered from the war, and a noisy and crowded house was too much for her. Harry didn’t want to take Teddy with him and leave her alone, so it was often a choice between his beloved clan of gingers and his godchild unless Andromeda visited Ted’s relatives in Spain.
“I’m finally joining the Chosen One on an adventure,” Draco whispered with an exaggerated eagerness. They left Croaker’s office and followed his advice; a park would be a nice spot to attract the entity.

She was on his shoulder now, flapping her wings when Harry moved a bit too fast for her. Hedwig didn’t need a cage or a perch in the compartment. She had her human perch. Harry didn’t mind one bit.
“Hah!” The Slytherin pointed at a smooth rock barely reaching his waist, walking around it with his lip between his teeth, in that cute way that Harry secretly enjoyed.
“The whole thing is for sale, though, right?” Harry doesn’t want to share with a stranger.
Malfoy bristled like an angry kitten, which Harry thought was a brilliant comparison. He also couldn’t help but be fascinated by Slytherin, feeling terrible about what had happened to him. How hard must it be, to see yourself losing your mind as you age, helpless, just watching from a canvas hanging on a wall? He was about to defend Muggles when he remembered the Dursleys. With the power of a crowd behind them, they would be the sort of people to burn him alive, wouldn’t they? The thought chilled him to the bones.
“Why?!”
Shit. Had Harry been so blind that he hadn’t recognised it at this time?
So, could Draco survive sharing a home with the man he lusted after? It went beyond lust, which was part of the problem. There were
Draco’s happy. He’s so, so brilliantly happy. They step out of the shop, and the street is full of people. Many are only known to him from pictures Harry hung in their apartment. But there’s Astoria, and Grandfather, Grandmother—they’re all here.
“But you’re brilliant!” Harry ducked his head when Malfoy’s eyes widened. Embarrassed, he rubbed the back of his neck. “I mean, you’re the best in our year, right? After Hermione.”
Draco took a napkin and wiped the tomato sauce Teddy had dropped on the table. “I’ll have you know, Potter, that the Manor’s ice sculptures were quite a sight. Anyone would have wept at their loss.”
The presence of a phoenix within their home was soothing; Fawkes would sing a few times a day, bringing a smile on everyone’s faces, and he even played lego with Scorpius, handing him random blocks and enjoying himself. Thor liked him, and all was well.
The gift opening session lasts nearly half an hour. Special wards screen Harry's post, but even with the filter, some unwelcome packages still reach him. There’s a collection of poems, chocolate that Draco knows is laced with Amortentia (Harry sets the box on fire) and pictures that Draco instantly regrets looking at - some people have no shame about flashing their bits to the Saviour. In the end, Harry stops opening anything that comes from a stranger.
He stares at the gift, then at the sleeping young man nearby, and back at the gift. He’d been hoping, but it’s still a pleasant surprise. He grits his teeth, slices through the wrapping and opens the box inside.
“Is there a volcano somewhere?” he asked as the salt cracked under his feet.
Harry brought him red orchids in a stone vase, and Draco fell in love with him all over again. After such a thoughtful gesture, he couldn’t believe their priority was to talk about some obscure marine creature instead of enjoying their summer night under the starry sky of Brittany. They ate a light meal on the terrace, watching the beach grow wider as the tide receded. When the moon rose, Harry smiled and pointed at each little bat flying above their heads, and Draco admired the way his eyes shone. There was little left of the scrawny kid who fought the Dark Lord; Harry Potter, trainer for the Auror department, looked incredible with his toned body, short beard and messy bun—longer hair suited him; Draco loved those untameable spikes and loose curls. His thoughts drifted to the way those curls felt between his fingers, and his cock twitched, so he drank the last drops of wine in his glass and stood up.
“If Croaker’s right, we need to get closer.”
“Hi. Thank you for your gifts. It was thoughtful of you.”
There was something haunted in the man’s eyes when he looked at Harry. “My daughter made mistakes when she was dating an arsehole. I know a bit about coercion. Now. You’re assuming exclusive guardianship of Scorpius Hyperion Malfoy until September 3, when his father’s probationary period is over. If Mr Malfoy is convicted again, if the Ministry screws him over, you’re not keeping that guardianship.”
Malfoy made another funny noise. “What?”
“Ah, bliss!” Sitting in the shade, Malfoy rested his head against the wall of the canyon and pointed his wand at the sky, conjuring a parasol. “Next time, shall we head to Antarctica?”
Bristling, Draco considered telling him how he could do it if Potter didn’t want to help, but the truth was, Draco sucked at Conjuration. He’d earned excellent results in school because his creations weren’t meant to last, but building an entire house was completely different from making a quill appear out of thin air. Some people (aka Potter) were gifted with stable magic on top of that rare ability to manipulate the land and shape it into buildings. Draco was not one of them. He shared his thoughts as if they didn’t embarrass him, and still, he felt the telltale heat of a flush on his neck and ears. Pansy would say he attached too much importance to Potter’s opinion of him. She’d be right.
,” read Draco, after a lot of eye-rolling. “Alright, so that would work because?” He sneered, and Hermione’s expression reminded Harry of all those times he and Ron had said something she’d considered stupid: a mix of sympathy and pity for their poor,
Malfoy’s tongue ran up and down his shaft and flattened against the head. Harry groaned, using the stacked barrels behind Malfoy to ground himself. He bucked his hips forward when Malfoy took the tip into his mouth and tongued his slit, something Harry never thought he’d enjoy so much. Then he took him in deeper, sucking and palming himself through his robes, his other hand still wrapped around Harry’s cock and squeezing. The Gryffindor’s toes curled in his shoes, a litany of swear words falling past his lips. He couldn’t help but tug at Malfoy’s hair, but now it was more so he could keep his head in place while he struggled not to fuck his mouth. His grip on the barrels tightened as the pressure built in his balls. Malfoy relaxed his jaw, and Harry slid in deeper until the other boy’s nose was buried in his pubic hair. It almost sent Harry over the edge. Just in time, Malfoy pulled away, giving one of his infuriating smirks before he, once again, pushed his tongue into Harry’s slit for the briefest of moments.
“Not everyone is a reckless idiot,” Malfoy snapped.
“Do I? I had no idea.” The kitten reaches Malfoy’s hip, and Malfoy scoops him up, his movement scaring away the Fwooper. His hair is the messiest Harry has ever seen it. The kitten lets out the tiniest mew as Malfoy holds him up to his nose and squints at him. “Animals love me,” he says, and Harry believes him.
Perhaps Draco wouldn’t write a resignation letter just yet.
“You have work tomorrow.”
What would have happened if they had Scarhead among them? Reputation-wise, it would have done wonders, but perhaps it’s better this way. Who knows what the Carrow twins, Flint or Warrington, would have done to him.
That meant Legilimency. Harry groaned and sat up, the sheets bunching up at his naked waist. At least Draco had entered his mind painlessly, without leaving a headache behind, but Harry had a complicated relationship with Mind Magic. He reached for his glasses and put them on.
“But what about you? Don’t you want your space, your marble floors?”
“Freshening Charm?”
"So," said Potter, breaking a silence that had been surprisingly comfortable and blowing on his tea to cool it down. "I'm starving; want to eat something?"
“You’re not that big!”
“I don’t have the emotional range of a teaspoon anymore, and I’m not blind. Whatever you get up to, I don’t want to know, but just tell me if I need to prepare Ethel and Sorcha to be your flower girls.” Ron narrowed his eyes at the arrival of a group of Arrows supporters, then pretended he hadn’t seen them, to Harry’s amusement.
“Be careful,” Harry said with a cough. He forced himself to ignore his arousal, and soon he was alone. He couldn’t help but think about the Horcruxes and how they reacted when destroyed, and he found himself praying—to what, he didn’t know—that they weren’t making a mistake, that Draco wouldn’t die down there. He looked at the dark water and thought it might be difficult for Draco to find his way back, so he dipped his wand under the surface and cast
The man stumbled out of the bathroom, looking like he’d visited Longbottom’s greenhouses and survived an encounter with the Devil’s Snare. His hair escaped from a loose bun in odd spikes and curls, reminding Draco of the bird’s nest he used to carry around before he figured out that long hair would be easier to tame. His glasses were crooked, his trousers ripped at the thigh and his shirt partially tucked into the waistband, buttons askew. “Oh thank Merlin you’re here!” Potter shuffled closer, a sock still covering his toes but not the rest of his foot. “Help!”
Dropping it in the ocean was starting to sound like the perfect plan for Harry. Perhaps in the Mariana Trench or even inside an underwater volcano to avoid being found by Muggle scientists. Magic-suppressing safe boxes would take care of any leaking magic. But what of the other pieces? He frowned and spoke his doubts aloud, leading to Malfoy turning even paler.
When Harry watches the first memory, which is his parents’ wedding ceremony (with Sirius and Remus flirting in the background), he’s rendered speechless. He looks up when it ends, and Draco thinks he’s about to cry. A few seconds later, he’s engulfed in the tightest hug he’s ever felt, and he squeezes back.
It’s a globe of memories. The magic is sophisticated, the runes under its base have never been used in this manner before, as far as Draco is aware. It’s similar to how the weather in the Great Hall works, using a combination of charms and conjuration. Flitwick gave him tips, and Draco sacrificed many November nights studying Pensieves and portraits. He’s proud of his accomplishment.
Draco flicked his wand at the mess around him to start packing. When he was done, he penned a brief letter to Pansy, cringing at the thought of her high-fiving Blaise and Greg, and taking bets on when Draco would end up in Potter’s bed. She would never let him live it down if he hid Potter’s generous offer from her, so Draco was wise enough to tell her instead of letting her find out—he’d never survive her wrath otherwise. He waited for Regulus to come back and hoped he wouldn’t get pecked to death for daring to send him on two errands in one day.
With the shield dispelled, Teddy’s hair went back to normal. He climbed onto the stool and grabbed a gingerbread man and a brush, and went back to decorating his creations. Some of the biscuits were darker than they should be, and Harry blamed the old oven and its messed-up magic. They’d still taste good though. They certainly made the entire house smell delicious.
“Why not sell it? You could move out with the money.”
Harry, instead of offering his hands, stepped forward and hugged the man. Sirius shuddered against him and embraced him so tightly that it almost hurt, but Harry let him. He knew Sirius needed hugs. He’d lost all his friends and had just gotten out of a horrible prison. And the embrace brought a familiarity that made Harry relax instantly and burrow his face in the crook of Sirius’ neck. He didn’t remember any detail about his time with his parents, but he recognised
Harry laughed, and by the time they reached their room, Draco was already moaning.
The trip to the dusty, spider-infested cellar was worth it. They shared the wine and ate until Harry thought his stomach would never be flat again. The conversation switched from leeches and how many nests Harry had got rid of, to Kreacher’s new favourite song to hum in the dark. They watched the sunset on the terrace and fed the Pygmy Puffs, had ice cream as the moon rose, and Draco smoked for a bit, the elegant curve of his wrist as he held the cigarette enchanting Harry, who kept surprising himself by falling in love with Draco over and over again. He enjoyed their quiet times. He enjoyed what followed because Draco initiating sex was a rarity, and they fell asleep cuddling, turning Harry’s romantic heart to mush.
“Oh, no, you didn’t, he’s all right.” Draco pulls him into a hug. “Hear that? He’s not making that sound when he’s unhappy, right?” Scorpius hesitates, then nods. “I’m sure he had fun. I’m just telling you to be very careful in the future, but you didn’t do anything bad.”
With everything they’d both been through, Harry didn’t mind Malfoy anymore. Sharing a dorm with him and being the only one willing to talk to him at first had changed things. Malfoy was still quick to anger, prickly and snarky, but he was also funny. Harry believed he’d been truthful about his change of heart. He’d also apologised to Hermione and often worked on assignments with her — to Ron’s dismay. That didn’t mean Harry and Malfoy didn’t argue. In fact, they might be fighting even more now, but it was different. Ron called it banter, and Harry had learned about an ongoing betting pool with stakes ranging from murder to marriage. Thinking back on it, Harry scoffed. Marriage. Right. Harry blamed Seamus’ drunken ramblings. Thanks to him, news of his sexual orientation had spread like wildfire through the entire school, leading students to wonder about the nature of the tension between Harry and Malfoy. A
Everything stops and Draco’s back in his hospital room. At the foot of his bed, Harry watches him, arms crossed on his chest. He’s wearing Draco’s favourite cashmere sweater, the one with the wide-open neck that reveals his shoulders. He looks fantastic, even if he paired that sweater with an awful pair of trousers that Draco swears he threw away at some point.
“His magic isn’t mature enough,” Harry points out, but Draco shakes his head. That’s untrue. Eleven is an arbitrary age set by the British Ministry; most countries don’t have the same restrictions. He tells him so, which makes Harry’s eyebrows climb up to his hairline. “What do you mean?”
at the empty space in front of him. An iron gate appeared and swung open, and Harry jumped inside and fell to his knees.
Eyes fluttering shut, Draco leans back. “Father did me a favour by being conspicuously absent. Mother was frazzled; Scorp transfigured Albert.” Draco tells him everything. He twists his body until he’s facing Harry, and he can guess by the gleam in his gaze that their son’s antics amuse him. Harry doesn’t have the same relationship with magic as Draco or another magical-raised parent. He’s just proud to see Scorpius do anything new; he doesn’t care about power levels. Draco does, still, to this today. It’s not because he wouldn’t love a child without magic, but he’d be worried about their quality of life. Though, really, the ritual that conceived Scorpius used Harry’s, Astoria’s and Draco’s magic. It’d be surprising if Scorpius were a Squib.
Harry startles. “How do you—”
“Do you mean sea cucumbers?”
Harry stifled a yawn, scrunching up his nose (why was he always so cute?) and stood up, Draco’s eyes following his movements. He walked closer, placed an enchanted Galleon next to his hand and gave him a soft smile that Draco returned. The Galleon was inspired by Dumbledore’s Army enchanted coins but vibrated instead of heating up, mimicking mobile phones. Draco tilted his chin and closed his eyes for a kiss, relishing in the feeling of his husband’s hand rubbing his back, before opening the book and getting ready to scribble notes in the margins.
a week ago were nowhere to be seen, though he knew Harry’s friends didn’t all agree with his dating choices. He’d been apprehensive about allowing these people through the wards, and not just because they might hex him behind his back, but if he paid close attention, he could hear it.
Harry drinks a full glass of water, wondering why Draco bothers buying those bottles instead of squeezing an actual lemon. “It’d taste better,” he adds after voicing his thoughts. “Less like dish soap.”
“Irregular, how?”
should be enough.”
Draco's stomach grumbled in agreement. "Great, I'll be right back." He grabbed his "Muggle World Only" shoulder-bag and a warm coat, aware that he was still dressed for East-African weather, and Apparated quietly to St. Mary's road in Ealing. There was no way he'd get subpar pizza from one of those overpriced, low-quality chains. He'd get authentic, wood-fired Italian goodness from the very best. The owners knew him, not as Draco Malfoy, ex-Pureblood supremacist, but as a regular customer who was polite and charming. As expected, they were delighted to see him again, a stark contrast with the judgemental reactions he still provoked in the wizarding world.
Time slowed. He forced himself to blink. His eyelids stayed shut long enough to convince him he’d never see again, but he fought and opened them. His gaze zeroed in on the lantern carried by the creature, because it stood out so strongly, its brightness fighting against the encompassing shadow. The longest he stared, the more detailed the lantern became. The light was warm, welcoming, almost loving. Harry’s paralysing fear faded.
“Oh, did you meet someone? Is that why you missed pub night since March? Oh Harry, who is she?”
He takes a sip of pumpkin juice. There’s a bitter aftertaste that alerts him immediately. He feels the blood drain from his face and casts more spells on the goblet, trying to identify what it contains and when he gets a result, he’s close to panicking. He’s out of breath, unsure if it’s because of the substance or not, but he doesn’t know what cyanide is and he’s terrified.
(Image: a pair of gloves shaped like hedgehogs)
“What happened?” he asked. Potter’s reply was inaudible. “Repeat that?”
“Do you want to get in trouble?” Harry said, amused. “
Groaning, Harry sat down on the floor, spotting two spiders fleeing towards the safety of the shadows. He checked the label on the nearest bottle of wine, which looked very old, and had to bite back a laugh.
Draco sneered, wiping flobberworm remains from his hands. “And if Kreacher doesn’t do his job, I’ll make sure he gets a raise and more holidays. Why, I might even send him to a spa.”
“Harry, what’s going on?”
Now there’s an odd gleam in Harry’s green eyes, but he’s opening Draco’s gift, and the previous conversation is put on hold. Just like Draco’s breathing. It was challenging to find a present without access to his money, so Draco made it himself.
He stopped staring, feeling the heat on his cheeks. Malfoy was standing in front of a door covered in tiny carvings of various magical creatures surrounding a coiled snake. Harry hissed and shuddered when the round door slid into the wall.
Huh. So the road and rocks also hid from Draco’s senses. Interesting. Behind them, the portal was still showing the real world, but Harry’s heartbeat sped up as the colours melted into each other until there was nothing left. His shoulders tensed. Croaker said Draco’s Sight would help find a way out, but he needed to know.
He must have dozed off because he was groggy, and his legs and arse were numb. He wondered if he should just go back to sleep, but he suddenly felt something in his hair. He thought it was a spider, but before he could open his eyes and move his hand to swat it away, he realised it was a hand. Malfoy was touching his hair. Should he stop him? It felt nice. He was surrounded by the scent of Malfoy’s expensive shampoo. The one that lingered in the shower long after the Slytherin was done getting ready in the morning. The one that Harry could smell in Potions class when Slughorn made them brew Amortentia.
“Okay, just pretend they didn’t happen then. I’m trying to have a conversation.”
, Harry thought. Far above them, a light moved, and Harry smiled as he remembered Draco’s story about the slow comet. “Kiss me? No one’s watching.”
When Harry, traumatised by war, quit the Aurors less than a year into the training, he’d been at a loss, with no idea what to do with his life. Lavender, similarly affected, became a good friend, so when Harry founded the company in 2003 (and earned a Charms Mastery in-between shared “Teddy-sitting” sessions with Draco), he hired her instantly. Ron still didn’t understand why. He was stuck on the “Won-Won” times, and Lavender herself enjoyed teasing him about it. She was also good at her job; while she wasn’t a Werewolf, the attack left her with more than scars, and her magic evolved. She could feel the earth’s density and composition beneath her feet, a valuable skill when it came to house expansion assessments. Nobody wanted to ruin a home’s foundations because they’d built it on a swampy area.
A scowl replaces his good mood. He’s not ready. He’ll bring the brownies to Andromeda’s tonight, and he’ll make a new batch without rum for his godson. He shakes his head to push away unwanted thoughts, and it works this time. He whisks the sugar and cocoa a little too hard, spills some, checks the chocolate in the saucepan and adds the cherries. As he’s working, he brings up the discussion with Malfoy once more, and a weight lifts off his shoulders. He stops questioning it. If Malfoy soothes him, let him.
Lee Jordan had prepared activities to keep the kids occupied, and Merlin, what a crowd. Many of these children were toddlers, easily distracted, but Jordan kept their attention because that was just the sort of person he was. The tent, a last-minute addition by Parangyo and Brown, was a welcome reprieve from the cold, and the food, cooked by elves or by human hands, received endless praise.
“Take-out?”
“Budge up.” Harry slotted beside him and kissed his cheek, sliding another pan on the stove.
Malfoy shook his head wildly. Harry let go of his wariness and took Malfoy’s fists in his hands gently. The other boy didn’t flinch. Encouraged, he moved close enough to notice very light freckles on the bridge of Malfoy’s nose.
Oh. Right. Harry keeps forgetting. “Do you want it back?”
He feels his eyes start to sting, and he sniffs, gathering his thoughts. Just in time, it seems, because Harry stumbles out of bed, looking hilariously ruffled. He reminds him of the oldest, crankiest bird in the owlery. Even with his glasses on, he still hits his foot against the doorframe of the bathroom. The muttered swearing that follows is almost sexy.
The owl doesn’t let Harry ignore it, hooting and extending its leg. Harry takes the piece of parchment and unrolls it while Draco closes the window.
“You’re not worthy of kissing the shoes of the Boy-Who-Lived!” She twisted her body around and cooed. “Oh, Harry James, I knew you’d save me, oh, my, look at those biceps—”
“I’m so sorry for leaving you alone. But Draco— where is our son?”
“I’m your boss, and I’ll fire you.”
. Not confusing at all.”
As they walked together, Harry kept casting subtle spells to keep him warm because Malfoy didn’t want to expose his hands to the elements to wave his wand. It delighted Harry that Malfoy had swallowed his pride to ask him for help, but it said a lot about his desperation since Malfoy was so hung up on the Fiendfyre life-debt and hated owing anyone anything. Especially Harry.
He knew how.
“Look at the bright side: we can drink.”
Kreacher drew himself up and gasped. “Master Regulus would be honoured! Kreacher knows! Kreacher will go get Master Regulus clothes, yes, and he will be so happy that the beautiful Malfoy boy is wearing them!” With an excited and sinister cackle, he disappeared again.
Theirs, back in 2010, was inspired by the Burrow without the mess. Draco didn’t think he would like that sort of countryside cottage look, all-natural wood with knots, but it had grown on him. It was comfortable, cute and homey, and he fully supported Harry’s idea to transform Number 3 that way. It would be easier for both of them if they could feel at home here.
“Bollocks! I owe Seamus 8 Galleons.”
He didn’t expect anything less. He vaguely heard one of the Aurors who was examining Hestia mentioning the Imperius Curse, but forgot about it when a tiny blond Bludger ran into his legs at full speed, yelling “DADDY!” and giggling.
Startled, Harry managed not to injure himself. He couldn’t look Amanuel in the eye.
Draco sniffed and brought Harry back to the real world. “Will you ever let go of my foot, or do you have a new interest? Because I’m telling you, a foot fetish is definitely
Prompt for this chapter:
Excellent question. Harry wasn’t sure. He shrugged and balled his gloved fists in his pockets, then relaxed them, choosing not to respond. “Whatever you want, I can’t get the foundations up if I can’t see the soil.” He spotted the instant Malfoy tensed. “You’re planning on living in that boathouse until then, aren’t you?”
Harry learned magical theory and watched it in action. Jim didn’t want him to practice too much at first, but soon he would be authorised to use Jim’s wand. Harry’s excitement at the prospect grew every day. After Christmas, Jim had said.
Harry wrinkled his nose and unclenched his fingers, which were wrapped tightly around his ankle.
He looked around, likely trying to figure out if they were going to be bothered by anyone if they kissed, but they should be safe. Two old women, utterly lost in each other’s adoring gaze, sat on the other end of the room, and another table was occupied by a quartet of Brazilian tourists and their guide, who didn’t seem to recognise them.
“Perhaps.”
It’s odd, being in classes with Granger when the other two aren’t there. It’s weirder when she talks to him.
As soon as the train left King’s Cross station, Harry rushed out of his compartment and ran. His heart was beating so fast! He wanted to meet the small version of Draco. He’d been told not to expect him to be nice, but Harry thought it was dumb because the big version was only prickly on the surface. Like a giant cactus. Jim was so lucky.
Teddy loves the place because it’s Harry’s, and kids have an odd fascination with their beloved family members’ belongings. Harry turned the smaller room into a kid’s paradise, with toys everywhere, and he bought movies Andromeda would approve of. They’ve watched
Harry tilts his head up so the chubby little hand doesn’t grasp them, and Victoire gurgles. “She’s huge.” It’s true; Victoire is growing at an even faster rate than Teddy did, it seems. Speaking of Teddy, Harry now has a tiny growth attached to his leg.
He hated how his chin wobbled. Blinking back tears, he thought about the slaps he wouldn’t get, the food he could steal without consequences.
“Fireworks,” he grumbles. “Green ones. Who the fuck decided it was a good idea?”
“If they want to, of course.”
“Sure looked like it to me.” Tentatively, he reaches for a strand of hair brushing Draco’s cheek, and tucks it behind his ear. Draco doesn’t move. “I don’t know what I’m doing.” Harry’s fingers play with the laces of Draco’s shirt, twisting them, and doubt creeps in, but before it can stop him, Draco’s hand is on the back of his neck, the other cupping his chin, and that’s it, Harry’s heart is about to soar—
“Yes, I’m sure she appreciated that—insane old bint. I’ve told her that place should be torn down but did she listen? Of course not.”
“Draco.”
“And, Potter, remember: there’s nothing he won’t enjoy if you’re with him because he’s obsessed with you.”
“Aah, yes, Weasel, how I missed the sweet sound of your voice.”
Clutching the box, Harry wets his lips. “I’m not worried, I’m just surprised. Why are you doing this?” Why do you care is not uttered.
“Kreacher witnessed the fall of the Ancient and Noble House of Black!” Kreacher wailed.
“I don’t understand,” Harry muttered. Was this a trap? Did Slytherin lure unsuspecting victims down there with the promise of food, or was this really just storage back then?
“Ah, yes. Thanks for the room, it’s nice.”
He doesn’t overcook the pasta, but it’s a very near thing. The evening is warm and humid, and Harry’s temples ache from the impending thunderstorm. As he fills the plates, a flicker of concern flashes in Draco’s eyes. “I’m fine,” he mumbles, and Draco raises an eyebrow. “Really. Just a headache.”
Absurd! Potions never required to touch the mixture, how idiotic! “I’m not doing that.”
Harry didn’t have a Muggle degree and he certainly didn’t earn any Mastery that would grant him a chance to go near the Department of Mysteries. It would’ve required studying. The thought of putting any effort into writing essays and doing endless research made Harry shudder. He preferred action, thank you very much.
“Mh.” Another flash. “Circe, I forgot what it was like. Would you like a drink? I’m up for something warm.”
Harry doesn’t let him go back to the Slytherin dorms alone; instead, he brings his books and his pillow and smirks at Draco’s raised eyebrow.
Draco barely had time to take off his coat and boots before a child raced down the hall with only one sock and his shirt inside-out. “Hi, Draco! Look! I drew a peacock.”
“If you need any help, yell.”
). The mistletoe that trapped Bell and Wood couldn’t be altered by magical means without bursting into thousands of copies of itself. They could reach up and detach it from the ceiling, but would they think about that?
Harry huffed angrily. “Stop calling me Snakeling! I’m a Gryffindor!”
Draco has to admit he expected her to be less decent than that, but it’s his jealousy talking. He realises he should reply, and he chooses to share his secret too. “I’ve wanked and been wanked, that’s all. You’re not the only one.”
Draco turned around. “It’s great. Thank you.”
Kreacher’s mad cackle was loud enough to startle Harry, and soon the elf vanished. Harry sighed and joined Draco on the sofa. “Budge up.”
Draco shuddered, remembering the creepy sight of an arm emptied of its bones (he’d been lurking nearby and witnessed it all). “I can hold your book for you,” he offered, flushing and berating himself for being so sappy.
But freezing his arse off in the boathouse endangered his health. Under these circumstances, he could control himself and push Potter away.
Harry frowned, lost in thoughts, likely trying to figure out how to make one or what it was. One could never underestimate the depth of someone’s ignorance when it came to foreign cuisine. “Okay, what’s the dough like?” he asked. Not a lack of knowledge, then.
“Sorry to be the bearer of bad news, but there are few people in this world who are as forgiving as you. It may be gone, but the things I’ve done are unforgettable.”
. He sips what’s left of his drink, pretending to be unbothered while his soul ascends to a higher plane. He’s not dreaming, right? Draco won’t run away if he discovers what Harry thinks about at night, after all. There’s something between them. If Harry is honest with himself, their intense relationship has never been
This is not the kind of talk Draco is ready for. Not so early, and definitely not when his cock is acting up. But he’s burning with questions and feels like he might never have another chance to satisfy his curiosity. “Have you ever-?”
“Did you transfigure Albert to entertain Scorp?” he asks, and Mother narrows her eyes.
“What did I miss?” Ginny asks, levitating a tray of drinks while Ron brings the other one.
I'm back! Dragon's Roar is done, so I can focus on this story. Though I'm going on vacation next week so you'll be waiting again after this chapter.
“It’s just a runny nose—”
could decipher it.”
Scorpius’ favourite spell is
“Talking is good.” Pub night isn’t, but he doesn’t mention it. It’s unnecessary, she gets it now. Maybe. “I don’t know how to tell Ron,” he adds, wincing at the thought of trying to have a conversation about feelings. Emotional range of a teaspoon still applies. As he pronounces these words, something quite obvious occurs to him, and he wants to bash his head against the table. He’s approaching this all wrong.
Light falls onto the rumpled sheets and turns to darkness.
There was a soft smile gracing Malfoy’s lips. Bollocks, but Harry’s crush was getting out of hand. His mind turned into a whirlwind as he planned on decorating his best guest room. Malfoy liked light and airy spaces, and the master bedroom in Grimmauld Place had a huge window with a view of the back garden. Yes, it would work just fine.
“And this is just a test. Indulge me.”
“Glad to hear that you find my murderous tendencies reassuring.”
He summoned small floating bulbs of light to see what he was doing and vanished the dirt all around him. In his Moleskine bag, he had enough random materials to get what he needed with magic: soon, a slab of concrete covered the soil, then he placed a few layers of isolation and another solid block. Walls rose. Pipes extended and connected, a magical heating system and water pump replaced Muggle machinery. He now had two rooms in front of him: the smaller one was quickly turned into a tiled bathroom. A shower, sink and toilet grew from the resized furniture Draco had put in his bag yesterday, and when he connected the pipes, he heard a shout from above and rolled his eyes. What had Scarhead done now?
“You watch too many crime documentaries.” He thought about extending the blood wards with runes, to be sure. A Fidelius was almost foolproof, and Little Harry’s room would be included in it, but it couldn’t hurt to shroud it in Lily Potter’s protection either. He knew many ways to do so and all of them required to keep the initial location of the wards physically linked to the extension, which explained why they couldn’t just kidnap the kid. As Harry often said, tampering with blood wards for anything other than extending them, carried unimaginable risks.
“Ronald will be delighted if you offer to play chess with him. You don’t need to go somewhere or meet up with everyone in our year, he only cares about having fun with you. Take your brooms and go flying. You’ll be—” a series of quick knocks startles her. “—fine,” she frowns and looks behind her shoulder before leaving her seat. “Why would anyone use a crow to send messages?”
Merlin, but finding Malfoy attractive would be his downfall. Since his Big Gay Awakening (courtesy of the portrait he now carried with him), Harry’s mind had focused on two types of people: dark and mysterious—reminding him, to his everlasting shame, that maybe, just maybe, he’d harboured an inappropriate crush on his godfather—and pale, blonde and mouthy. He blinked, coughed and crossed his arms, acting as if he hadn’t been staring. “That’s the one?”
So that’s why the Hat took so long! A horrible thought goes through Draco’s head. “It was because of me, wasn’t it.”
“Kreacher will clean, and Kreacher will open the window for nasty Masters who are up to things Kreacher does not want to think about.”
“Fuck you.”
“Why?”
“Ah, yes, pardon me, every single thing you did had a noble goal back then.” Malfoy shuffles closer. “Can you find Ursa Minor?”
Big grey eyes stared up at him. “Daddy, I’m not sleepy.”
and drinks the rest of his tea. “Could you take me home after the speech?” He doesn’t want to walk to the edge of the wards to Apparate, and he also doesn’t want to mingle with the crowd, which will definitely happen if he goes anywhere outside.
It took a few seconds before Blaise, who lived off his family fortune, strolled into view with a glass of wine. “Well, what a surprise! Aren’t you at work?”
Pureblooded parents exposed their children to the elements too, but never looked deeply into why. It was just something they did. Draco had discovered that wizards didn’t question much in their lives, while many Muggles spent their existence trying to figure out the secrets of the universe. It used to drive him mad.
The sharp shift in topics couldn’t be a coincidence; Mother’s observation skills hadn’t dulled over the years. She’d known he was gay long before he realised it himself, after all. He pretended to have no clue what she truly meant and kept his expression neutral. “Annoying as ever.”
Malfoy mumbled something that might have been “fuck off” before sitting up, shaking. The hatred on his face lasted until he looked around, assisted by a
“It’s illegal, Scorpius,” Harry murmurs, just loud enough to be heard. Not very convincing.
Said plan was written on a large piece of paper stuck to the fridge, and at the moment, Harry was staring at it like he often did; as if the list was a puzzle he was determined to solve. He looked particularly handsome this morning, with his long hair pulled in a messy bun and his short, scraggly beard. Gone was the starved child hiding under clothes much too large for him. Being a happily married Wardmaster and spending so much time in the field on assignments with Bill Weasley or the Aurors agreed with him. Draco, as an Unspeakable, felt like he couldn’t compete with his physical appearance (thankfully, Harry’s sense of style was as terrible as ever). While Draco had always been rather pretty for a boy, taking after his mother, he was a bookworm, and his job didn’t require the use of his muscles. He was still extremely pale and had none of Harry’s athletic frame; his body was softer, though he hadn’t gained much weight over the years. But he did not doubt that if he didn’t stop eating sweets, he would regret many of his decisions in a few years. He wasn’t too bothered anyway: Harry worshipped his body and Draco still liked what he saw in the mirror, soft belly or not.
“And many years after that, yeah.”
He’ll be good, alright.
“Who in the- Mr Potter!” The middle-aged wizard stared in amazement, his moustache twitching. Harry didn’t recognise him, nor his name, so he must be one of the new hires. After the war, the Ministry had started to hire masses of Muggleborns and Half-Bloods. Unfortunately, they were still suffering from the war and made decisions that resulted in more spilt blood and injustice in the name of revenge. What they tried to do to Malfoy was just another check mark on their list. Harry was curious to see if this man agreed with their anti-Pureblood propaganda.
A few seconds later, time seemed to stop, as the ground cracked and Harry fell. The saltiness of the water stung his eyes, and he swam back to the surface, gasping for air, heart beating a mile a minute.
Gabriel, Draco and Harry watched them Disapparate.
Draco wasn’t stupid. This event would be a tremendous boost to his reputation. These suspicious glances he’d earned by gracing the front page of the
Jim kneeled in front of Harry and ruffled his hair, smiling. “Are you ready?”
Potter cleared his throat, a blush dusting his cheeks. “You can tie me up later. Just help me fix this first.”
Harry levitated the books away and scooted closer, tracing shapes on the fabric of Draco’s shirt, still breathless. Thanks to Draco’s Occlumency skills, putting aside all thoughts of sea cucumbers was a smooth process, and he drank in Potter’s features before sliding a hand through his hair and pulling him closer. Harry stole a kiss from him, then another—longer, harsher—and straddled him, grabbing his face and deepening the kiss.
aura.
Last year, Wood had asked Hagrid to play the part, and Draco had been horrified when he’d found himself pressed against a coat that had not been washed in decades. There had been bugs crawling into Hagrid’s beard! He’d given them
“Potter!” Draco yells from the floor below. A crack later and he’s standing in Harry’s living room with his wand out. “
Draco shook it. And that was how Harry met Pansy, Vincent and Gregory too.
He reached blindly for his wand. Picturing the first time he’d held baby Edward Lupin, he cast his Patronus (a fox. Mother had taught him). “Tell Wood I’m sick.” He then proceeded to cough his lungs out.
“Brats and cauldrons making life difficult for Kreacher, what would poor Master Regulus say,” Kreacher muttered.
“My sort?”
“I’ll head to bed if that’s okay,” he said quietly. “Let’s do this again soon. And I’d like it if you called me Harry.”
Blaise was next to get his hooks into him and drag him to his house so Draco could see Matteo (Merlin, he'd grown so much!), and Draco barely had any time to breathe before Gringotts demanded to see him regarding the museum's funding.
He’d almost forgotten this existed. He thanked Harry and went back to bed, uncorked the vial shakily and drank his potion. Relieved, he soon lost consciousness.
Before Harry is able to protest, Malfoy Apparates away.
When he wakes up, it’s still dark outside. The eighth year dormitory is above the lake, created by Hogwarts herself when she noticed there was a need for extra space in the other Houses. Slytherin didn’t need any, not with only Draco coming back, but she still separated him from the lower years. Draco believes this dorm already existed; there were times when the student body was much larger than today.
Indeed,
“I did it yesterday.” It’s true; birds kept eating them, and Harry thought Draco would be annoyed. He was so proud when the fruits first appeared.
Harry blinks and looks at him. “Huh. No?”
Harry let him escape, understanding the urge to be alone and perhaps cry in peace. The gash in Malfoy’s leg was gone, healed by a potent lotion found in a cupboard, but Malfoy still needed to apply it on the wound to strengthen the new skin. Harry waited for him, still surprised to feel so worried each time Malfoy seemed on the verge of crumbling, and astonished that Malfoy opened up to him, little by little. They just clicked. Here, in their bubble, far from the awed stares or the angry mob, they weren’t the Boy-Who-Lived and the Death Eater, but two teenagers scarred by war, who knew all too well what the Cruciatus felt like and how a man sounded when he died. They were Harry, who spent his life trying to fly under the radar, underperforming at school, beaten black and blue by his cousin, ignored—at best—by those who were supposed to take care of him, starved and treated like a slave. They were Draco, born and raised in the lap of luxury, adored by his parents, educated and smart, expected to always do his best, spoiled and well-fed, feeling like a failure if he didn’t perform well, his pain minimised by everyone just because he’d had a privileged upbringing and thought he had no right to feel sorry for himself. How many times had Harry heard it from Ron this year? How Malfoy didn’t have a right to look so sad and lonely, because he still had his money and family?
Malfoy’s eyes flicked towards him. “You can do that?”
Draco wrapped himself up in several layers of mismatched clothes and led Potter outside in the snow.
His eyes snapped open, and he grabbed hold of the wall as ropes of cum painted the stone wall. He gasped and kept pulling at his oversensitive cock until he couldn’t stand it anymore.
He leaned forward, hesitant, and kissed him again. Malfoy let him, stroking his tongue slowly, far from their earlier frenzy.
It would depend on Potter’s meeting at Gringotts, so Draco didn’t have an answer. “We’re still figuring it out.”
parchment—no, fuck!” The scroll slapped Draco’s nose and Harry snorted. “
It’s unexpected, but Draco guesses that Weasley must be a decent person to be Harry’s best friend and Granger’s boyfriend.
A groan reminded him of Malfoy’s presence, and wasn’t that just great? He tightened his grip on his wand.
A brief memory of being stuck to a wall until they both calmed down flashed through Harry’s mind, and he flushed in embarrassment. Malfoy took a few steps, let out a loud breath and sat beside him, fists clenched and hair ruffled.
They shared their new tent more than once instead of Apparting back and forth, and on the last morning, Draco woke up in Harry's arms. He froze, cheek resting on a naked shoulder. He had no idea how he'd gotten into this situation.
. “What do we do?”
He climbed up the newly built stairs, and his eyes widened. His lips twitched, and he sighed in fond exasperation. Harry was drenched from head to toe, holding a faucet and glaring at the kitchen sink.
But if he makes his own money, he can pay for an apprenticeship, a roof over his head that won’t give him nightmares… he can take care of himself. An entire Basilisk is worth enough that even if he never gets access to the Malfoy vaults, he’ll live comfortably for the rest of his life. Unless he starts buying a dozen mansions, he’ll be fine.
“Latin. Look at the dates.”
“Is Harry Potter needing something from Kreacher?” There’s thinly veiled concern in Kreacher’s tone.
“You made up with Granger. I hope I didn’t bother you,” Draco drawls. Or tries to. It doesn’t work so well when his voice sounds so warbled.
“You’re not getting my house,” Harry says, taking in her delight and the twinkle in her eyes. “You cut your hair,” he realises, used to seeing her with a waterfall of fiery locks.
The distance between them and the group grew until Draco stopped. He was standing on top of a series of terraced pools, next to a vent as tall as his waist. Harry took a picture.
“Ah, tell you what, we can go to the Christmas market and see if they have ice statues.” So what if Draco wanted to go back? This was the perfect opportunity. “If they don’t, we’ll go to the Manor, and I’ll try to build one for you.”
The elf’s ears quivered, and she vanished the twig with a snap of her fingers. “Mistress Cissa is being at the Museum. Is Master Draco wanting to wait?”
. “Well, he is fun to be around.” He was itching to tell her all about Turkey and Iran but didn’t know where to start because his mind drifted to memories he’d rather take to the grave (or to Pansy). He took a deep breath, Occluded, and managed to describe the wonders of Cappadocia, the saffron pistachios he’d developed an obsession with, and the colourful wizarding area of Isfahan. He’d loved both countries equally and would one day visit again. It didn’t fool Mother, but she didn’t ask about Potter after that.
Then it hit him: he missed Harry. He’d been gone for two hours, and already, loneliness threatened to swallow him whole.
Only Draco’s fast reflexes prevent his inkpot, precariously balanced on the couch, from spilling all over the fabric. He has no words, and Potter laughs, the absolute arse. “You’re fucking lying.”
“I didn’t laugh when you threw up, Potter,” Draco hisses between his teeth.
But Scorpius still manages to find a loophole, and the next time he stays at Malfoy Manor, Albert the peacock sprouts extra legs once more. Only, this time, Scorpius did it on purpose, and he’s not sorry.
The familiarity of Hermione’s rant is quite nostalgic. How long has it been since Harry spent time with her without the urge to run for the hills? He takes a seat on the cream-coloured sofa and picks at the wool of the blanket, hearing the kettle boil on the other side of the thin wall. The flat is tiny; Hermione earned her Mastery in Arithmancy from the Magical Institute of Higher Education a few months ago and found a job in the Department of Mysteries soon after, but she has yet to earn enough money to afford a better place. She often talks about moving to Edinburgh, citing the need to live far from London but still benefit from a bustling city. That’s part of what drove her and Ron apart. Harry frowns; he lost track of that story. When Hermione comes back with two cups of flavoured oolong tea, Harry bites his tongue to avoid asking her about it. He’ll find out soon enough.
Harry throws up when they land.
“Why? What’s wrong with it?” Deep down, he already knew.
The air entering his lungs reminds him of all the times he held his breath underwater to empty his mind. The colours of the world surface again. He has his glasses on; they’re crooked. A hand straightens them, and Harry tilts his head up and lets out a watery giggle. It’s not even funny, but he can’t help it. Malfoy is crouched at eye-level with him, because Harry is sitting on the pavement and resting against a wall like a rag doll. He doesn’t remember how he got there.
The Malfoys had celebrated Christmas because it was an excuse to spoil Draco, who got presents for Yule too. Any excuse to shower him with gifts sounded great in his parents’ mind. As an adult, he didn’t see the point of celebrating both. Not anymore. But for Teddy (and Potter, his traitorous brain added), he’d celebrate anything and even dress up if needed.
“Well, aren’t we looking sexy tonight, Malfoy. Who would’ve thought you could tan. How long did it take before you went from lobster to sex on legs?”
“That’s why, Granger.”
“You know, groceries, maybe have a look at Hamleys—”
Harry liked snakes, but snakes did not carry messages. Doors didn’t appear out of nowhere either, so he figured he must have been dreaming. Aunt Petunia would faint if she could see that; it would be brilliant.
Once the lotion is absorbed through his skin, he gets dressed in clean clothes and uses the Floo before he changes his mind. The temperature is pleasant, so he wears jeans and a form-fitting bottle-green t-shirt, instead of hiding under a hoodie.
For some reason, Ron has the attention span of a goldfish tonight, which is good news, because when Dean mentions a new brand of Firewhiskey, he stops speaking about Quidditch. Harry takes this opportunity to hurry inside.
Harry served her a cup of tea. “He’s at Hogwarts.” The portrait had used the magic of Grimmauld Place to hop out of his travel-frame, found Phineas’ painting in the attic and followed the link that tied it to the school.
“Come in.”
“Endless drama!”
Before stepping inside the house, he glanced at the neighbour’s car, a Ford Escort, and idly wondered why he felt that something was missing; as if there were details here that he should remember but couldn’t quite catch. He had only seen glimpses of the men who had moved in a week ago, but Uncle Vernon and Aunt Petunia didn’t approve of them in the slightest and wanted to call the police on them for “obscene behaviour” (whatever that meant). Aunt Petunia was continually staring at their garden from the window, but they were never outside. Harry thought anyone his family disliked that much must have been brilliant.
“I’m fine!”
“You have no idea of the torture I go through.”
Prompt for this chapter:
Draco glances at him. “You like beans.” It’s true; especially those, roasted with onion powder and bacon. They’re amazing, and Draco usually has to give him a second serving.
Malfoy takes Harry’s arm, but before they Apparate, Harry takes a second to observe his expression. His eyes shine as if Malfoy was on the verge of tears, and a muscle is pulsing in his jaw. His mouth is set in a grim line. Harry realises that against all odds, Malfoy cares about him.
“Did you decide what to do with it?”
Draco hung his head in dismay. “Why? He’ll blame me for not seeing the movies.”
He’d taught students for a decade. Quite a long time for someone who said teaching wasn’t his calling, but he’d needed that time to heal and grieve. After a few years, he’d rediscovered the hidden part of the Chamber of Secrets.
More photos were hung in the living room, like Teddy flying on his toy broom, or some of Harry and Draco’s school pictures. The kitchen was usually home to Draco’s ridiculous notes: “
“It’s too bad it isn’t cold enough in London to build an ice dragon. Draco loved it,” she continued with a glint in her eye. “But he cried when it melted in the spring.”
The realism of the painting stunned Harry. Not just because it had probably been painted around the Founding in a style that was pretty much never seen at the time (at least he thought it wasn’t), but because it was so well done, it looked like a photograph. It depicted a Middle-Eastern man with handsome features, dressed in a dark green tunic, a sword at his belt and a dark, unvarnished wand at his fist. He sported wavy black hair streaked with grey and striking sea-green eyes. Harry found himself blushing, to his horror. He liked girls, didn’t he? His eyes darted away from the portrait and landed on his rival, taking in his delicate features and his jawline.
“What you don’t know could fill the Black Lake,” Malfoy drawls.
“You win the House Cup.”
Hermione Floo-called to make sure he was alright. She listened as he explained he needed some time to himself, didn’t berate him for it, and only requested to see him a few days later. Today’s the day.
“Draco,” he began, standing even closer. “I’m going to do something very Gryffindor. Please don’t slap me.”
With the box tucked away, Draco helped him place the rock back in its original position, and they flew away as soon as Harry erased all traces of their spells. Despite the complete separation of the magical and Muggle governments, they didn’t want to cause trouble in a country where the Statute of Secrecy was taken to an extreme that made Britain look like a playground. They both had enough experience with politicians attempting to screw them over; they didn’t need to create new problems for themselves around the world.
