a lot of them seem to have an idea as to why he played so badly that he does not even have himself, sharing knowing nods and sighs with each other rather than giving him the shit he suspects he deserves.

and Harry in despair, mutters in defeat -
“No. I didn't always want one. I am more than happy with the child I have. He is and always will be perfect. But yes, I think she would be like you. I would be proud – to have you for a daughter, and so would your parents. Think about it, and we'll speak of it no more unless you wish. And now I believe you had something to tell me?”

The real truth is he
feeling, not feeling is the only way.
Ten years ago and a hundred thousand extra years, he's dawdling, he knows it, the Harpies are well up ahead of them even on their way to the Quidditch grounds and he hopes this does not portend anything for their matches to come. Gods he's ready to fly, here more than ever.

“Okay.”

“Yes?” Hermione answers without turning round; when she does turn and see who it is her face snaps closed - “Mrs Malfoy,” she says coldly, closing her book and standing up from the sofa defensively, Narcissa realises, not deferentially. The girl opens her mouth for a brief moment, on the verge of saying
but still implies an

“Oh I'm just getting started. Really. I'm still trying to imagine anyone growing up here, it looks like a place to eat children, not raise them.”

Harry stifles a snort -
“Well, never mind -” Hermione goes on quickly, saving him, glaring at the other two – simultaneously Harry notices, even though it requires her looking to each side of her which takes some mad Hermione-only skill. “I wouldn't worry about it Harry, I just can't believe you hadn't noticed before now.”
“Guess he figured I had something to say to you?”
do you have these? Oh my god, is that an actual Boticelli?”
“Quite,” she says. “Then live for us, you always did anyway, you don't have to be a different person to change, not when the core remains the same. You live for us -” she leans across, takes his hand, it is the only thing that stills him, stops the fidgeting - “Live

And so, taken altogether, in the end the feeling that prevails the most when he thinks of Draco is one of frustration.

would imply it – hitting at Harry where he knows the spike will sting, just like he has always been far too capable of doing.
was good at these things! She is also struggling because this still doesn't help her pinpoint Bill Weasley from the others. Fleur swears heavily in French – the cursing is surprisingly strong and at least breaks her spell a little -
- then he comes crashing back to earth and there's a dartk mark in the air above their heads, a horrible wavery green that makes a lot of them – especially towards the back of the room where the older students are – gasp and look around nervously.

means – as he props the broom against the stone and attempts to push his hair back out of his face – it's only barely sucessful, and Draco thinks for the millionth time, how he wants to be the one to do that. It occurs to him that if Harry was to simply push him into this wall and kiss him right now he'd let him, in fact, he wants that more than any other scenario he can imagine. The crackling air feels static around them for his realising this.
be something you'd do.” They lie for a long time hand in hand, both afraid the other will hear his heart beating out of control. Eventually Draco turns over, reaches half heartedly for his clothes -
It seems obvious now; they were always destined to end up here.
“Doesn't mean it isn't real. I
Harry hopes to heck he doesn't go red, this being far too close to the truth;

much he could find to bite back in reply but instead what comes out of his mouth is a frighteningly old familiar -
“That – is not exactly what I said.”
Moments and seconds. Harry trying to make it look as though he was not watching Draco at breakfast, checking that he ate. Narcissa making it look as though she was not watching Harry watch Draco. Lucius noticing the boys holding hands one morning, opening his mouth and closing it again with a sigh and a nod. Arthur showing Lucius how the telephone worked. The way Lucius looked at Luna with an expression that changed his whole face into that of somebody he could grow to like. The look on Draco's face when his aunt handed him baby Teddy to hold and the way Harry laughed and took him off Draco quickly.
hating Potter and when he realised – he supposed it was some time in their second year – looking back it may have been connected to playing Quidditch together after all – that Potter was enjoying their enmity just as much as he was – it had almost made up for their not being friends. It had not occurred to him until maybe three years later that he had been half way in love with him the whole time.
There have been a lot of mirrors over the years. He remembers them becoming the enemy when he was sixteen; of course he became drawn to them, not sure what it is that has always made his enemies somehow enticing. There was a fine line between vanity and self loathing and for a while there it was a tightrope act. He remembers – remembers seeing someone in the glass he was shocked to find out he didn't like; someone who was chosen only for failure, chosen for a victim – chosen – really, for nothing at all. After the war, he decided he never wanted to see his face red-eyed and tear streaked again, so he started with eyeliner. You can't cry, he reasoned, through intricate eye make up; it would be too much of a waste to see it go into streaks. It was the same with music; couldn't hear your own nervous heart beat, your internal neurosis over the sound of a good beat. His father had said it was vulgar –
“You're a monster.” Draco stretches contentedly, cat like, and beams.
She's applying to the Harpies, she tells him; it's Quidditch or nothing. Do you remember that game when – by the time she's done, he's actually laughing. They'll have to fly together again some time. Dance together too – remember the Yule Ball? Yes, she went with Fred, but to be honest she lost track of which of them she danced with and when that night. She was fairly sure they were pranking her somehow, and they were, of course they were.
And other new catchy slogans, Rita Skeeter forcing her camera into their faces until Draco had looked seconds away from panic. Harry had wanted to leap in front of them and fight them all off.
“Do you ever – I mean is it normal to – say, think about a certain person?”
“Oh yeah,” Draco sneers - “That's right. Remind me what I owe you. Thought you were entitled to me did you? Thought you could just do what you wanted then get rid of me? Is that all I – gods, never mind, I don't care, I don't give a fuck, do you hear?”
it fucking hurts his head, this song when the music starts – all that green floating above the stage and the smoke around Draco and the band in the same sickly shade but the song itself –
“Oh it's not just faces,” Draco smirks.
he watches him all the time, just like he always did, loving the lines of him in the candlelight, the silver of him in shadow and the gold in his hair in the morning. It terrifies him that he has fallen so hard, scares him to near paralysis to know that he might have condemned him to death by not being able to stop himself from loving him. Sometimes he feels himself unable to let him out of his sight for fear of losing him. Sometimes even that isn't enough – not when so many of them where
“Draco -” Harry takes a step towards him - “wait – are you – we need to -”
“It's not cowardly not to kill,” Harry shrugs. He has thought about this for so long it seems obvious. “Sometimes it's the bravest thing you can do – it was for you, and I don't care what they told you, it wasn't weakness – it's strength -”
I am listening to it right before the last match against Greece. Is in my head the whole time. Beautiful. I am looking forward to the show tonight – is first time I am seeing you live.”
“Yeah. I do. I think it's that bad -” he pauses just on the verge of telling her that the thought of Draco at the mercy of an angry mob makes him feel thoroughly sick but stops himself. He's been looking at their pictures in the papers for weeks now, Lucius half broken and confused – well perhaps he deserves it – Narcissa, inscrutable and proud and Draco -
“Harry?” Taz calls back over her shoulder - “Earth to Potter?” and he blinks, startled, not realising, until the blink makes him break eye contact with Malfoy – that he has in fact been keeping it up the whole time, Malfoy's gaze as level and challenging as it has always been, his eyes smirking at Harry while his lip remains curled.
up Pansy.”
“Because -” he works it out as he says it and perhaps it is only for the opportunity to work it out that he actually says it at all - “Because the person singing that song, the character and the point of view – they're someone who hates the person who rescued them, someone who's over it, someone who gets to just
“Make me,” Draco grins, he actually
“I don't think -” Lucius tries to summon up a glare but his heart is not in it and Narcissa cuts across him -
It's not that he doesn't want to let Draco out of his sight it's just that he – doesn't want to let Draco out of his sight. He sighs to himself; it's like sixth year all over again – except without being convinced that Draco is up to something or being afraid that he might hurt anyone; anyone other than himself anyway. Turns out – and yes Harry now gets to feel shitty of ever thinking otherwise, oh yay – turns out Draco's only destructive tendancies are focused on himself. It also turns out that's the person Harry wants him hurting the least, so in many ways nothing has changed. In many more everything has.
“Because of course, you think only you can do poorly, but I ask you this Malfoy – who is losing the Triwizard Tournament?”
“Should we?”
“Draco, please -”
instantly.
“Shut up.
Harry finds himself petting the sleek soft head in his lap idly, running his fingers through Draco's hair like stroking a sunbeam.
“Aww, is it Cho?”

And now she breathes out and nods and thinks they might be alright. She knows she will not really be gone long, but it is so very far to go, and distance can feel like time sometimes.
“As if! Don't lie up all night thinking about half naked Seekers right?”
“Fuck -” Draco says from somewhere near the window, his voice growing tense again - “You were right, there's

He closes his eyes in bliss as they kiss face to face, his hands on Draco - hips and arms and holding onto his shoulders - who arches into every touch with greedy ferocity and jerking hips and it is not nearly as long of this as he has imagined before he's hard as hell for him again and Draco repeats the order -
“No -”
to control himself around more. What a fucking mess. He groans, wrists resting floppily across his knees, banging the back of his head softly against the picture frame behind him.

“They went together?” she wonders aloud.
“Look,

Anyway, she has no intention of staying around and being privy to all this girly gushiness; if it's not about her she's not especially interested, which reminds her – she gets up without comment and heads upstairs. She may not pay overmuch attention but she still knows where to find the younger Monsieur Malfoy at this time of day and she raps on his door smartly.
But isn't this what he wanted? Hadn't he just begged Potter to follow him with everything but words? Why, after all, did he want help – if he
even if he was not reaching for Harry like a child grasping for a toy, breath takingly sweet, almost innocent even alongside such beautiful arousal – his voice would have killed Harry before it let him do anything other than what Draco wanted. He finds himself captivated by the bossiness of it, tingling electrically at the sublime arrogance, the certainty in that voice of getting what it wants – at the same time, he can hear a layer underneath that assuredness, a note that is more like a plea, a fragile neediness trapped in Draco's chest. It occurs to him that he is owned by that voice, body and soul and that he

His brain catches up to what he said before, and his lip twitches into something that almost resembles a grin and his shoulders jerk with a huff of amusement. Potter catches on to half a smile like a fish to a hook and reaches out his hand to Draco's right. Draco has to practically sit on his hand to push it out of reach because his instinct shrieks at him just to take his hand but he won't. He remembers a viciously made vow to himself from years ago – that whatever else happened – they could kiss, they could fuck, they could kill each other but he would

he shrugs.
“You're so obtuse! Both of you! You've been being obtuse for ten years, now that you're finally at least snogging I think it's time to sort it out, don't you?”
“Get out of my way.”
“Fuck you.”
Ginny scrunches her face up.
the words sound good in his head, like they go half way to curing something. There's a reason he thought about flying the first time he tried a Patronus; actually there are a few reasons, but he's not quite willing to think about the others just at the moment, beyond the sensation of rising into the air – no, there was more, there was definitely another factor, a late night thought that he puts away by morning and would rather not raise now with the uncomplicated pleasures the day seems to be bringing. Quidditch Practise at Hogwarts! It's like he could pretend he was a kid again before the war and death and the fallen fifty ever happened. He's ready to pretend again; he wonders if this is a good thing.
Harry looks down briefly; when he looks up again there's a curious merriment in his eyes. Oh no. It was that – that stubborn resilient brightness in him - that got Draco so obsessed in the first place, all the way back in first year – so he
Harry follows, hating him.
“Potter! Oi! Potter!”
And here he is now, stuck in a stupid cupboard because it's better than going out and facing the world.
“What, and you have now?”
“Yes,” Harry says, and he starts a little; he had not meant to voice the question out loud, he feels half a jerk of embarrassment but Harry kisses the back of his neck, pulls him a little closer, runs his fingers across the sensitive part of his hip and soothes the surprise he feels at having dared whisper it out loud - “ - the realest. The best. Most real thing there is.” He punctuates each phrase with kisses , until Draco rolls over.

Narcissa finds herself at a loss in what was once her own house. She wanders back upstairs, thinks about knocking on Luicius' door, realises she does not want to apologise and is not going to speak to him until he speaks to her – a battle they always have after a row and one she always wins. She walks on, thinks about knocking on Draco's door but hears him moaning in his sleep and simply goes in. He

She turns from him and runs up the hill.
“Yes, that's like you dear. It was the same with Ted and I –
“Rarely these days, I'm afraid,” Narcissa thins her lips.
He shudders enormously. “Just to feel it, I think – the power, to enjoy scaring me. To prove that he
“The Dark Lord -” he flashes Harry a look, one designed to challenge him not to look away without him having to see too deeply himself. “I think he was – I don't know. He hated anything with a hint of goodness in it, happiness – or – or sweetness – because music's not always happy, nor should it be – he hated even the sound of it. We were lucky any of the music collection survived. Or the peacocks. Everything he destroyed he left us

“So – you mean – this -” Draco taps his - “

“No she did it for us – for me I suppose – because we asked. She actually wasn't against us helping you, you know. In fact I think your mum and Hermione – well anyway, that's their business. Yes, technically you can get inside, but you'd be surrounded.”
your groupie either – and she's coming tomorrow with the Granger-Weasleys and Krum.”
“I'm not exactly standing at your door mate.”
It feels like a relief to have something to say and then something to do as she pours tea, glaring at Ron as he mumbles something about going to wake Harry and retreats. She makes an internal memo to take him to task later for leaving her here as lone mediator.
The boy dithers for a moment before running off. Draco looks at Pansy with a raised eyebrow - “What?”
“No! Hell no! Get up! Look!” Draco throws the massive brocade curtains open dramatically. He does everything dramatically, though the curtains are so heavy there's really very little option. This is the room he used to have as a child, he told Harry, the first time he finally persuaded him to come and stay.
idiots aren't they?”
he thinks, with a swell of the heart like a swell of melody.
“- I stand corrected.”
“So -” she stands up and nods - “I'm going to bed. I told your mother – and alright, so your aunt Andromeda's visiting tomorrow, and you can see her if you want, she's agreeable either way. You're mother's going to, and – well it's up to you, alright?”

“You low down, cowardly son of a -”
you I'm not gonna do that.”
“You got yours over a scar, and I scarred over mine -” Draco muses. “It's like we balance each other out.” He says it with a tone of sarcasm that he does not actually mean, but Harry takes this as a good sign, if Draco can be sarcastic then he's probably fine. Draco picks up Harry's arm, holding it by the wrist and looking closely -
“Pfft. Ron won't even
“She actually said that?” Draco sounds incredulous; it raises his vocal levels of posh by at least twenty percent - “Granger. She specifically and actually said
“Not a chance Blaise, not a bloody chance. Think I'm going to -”
The court ripples with people chuckling. Harry only notices that Draco is not one of them. There was a time when he would rather have died than not front the
“You and I. We are very alike I think. We see but we do not say – and they say beautiful cannot mean clever,” she scoffs. “We will speak again”.
“I do not know,” Fleur does not sound much like she cares either - “I just found the letter. Since I was not looking for either boy I suppose it was not meant for me, so I am only reading it briefly.”
Hermione suddenly can't cope – at least not over anything she may have just said. Of course, they're all not coping, the people in this house; this is the house of not coping. Maybe Ron's coping and then she and Gin are remarkably okay but that's why they're not here, in the healing house. Actually, she thinks, as she makes her way up the stairs, footsteps creaking as she goes – it's not a very

“Draco. Right. And again I say, why me?”
“God yes -” Harry almost whimpers it, and his mouth is on Draco's and Draco can feel the thing in his chest fucking clawing to get through, to break through him into Harry and scratch them both to pieces and wrap them up together in the tatters of their former selves; he reels with the force of how much he wants. They grab at each other very like a fight and he feels positively furious with lust and neediness, and for a while he lets it be all he feels rather than having to fight the thing in his head, which tells him in a snooty, logical voice that it's not true, of course; Potter cannot possibly love
he hears the line in his head from somewhere and with it somehow in mind he carries on up the stairs rather than turning back.
“Only up until the seventeenth century, so obviously not me personally. But also, it was
“You -” Harry sits up, it hurts –
“What? You want a fucking lullaby or something?”
Is that how it is?
“-wanting to give me up to the Dark Lord,” Harry nods. “If I make a public announcement that she made a valid point there do you think people will let her off the hook?”

room and his chest burst and tightened repeatedly in a flurry of feelings he was not quie sure how to name. The last time he remembers thinking this was about two years ago; he can remember it exactly. Not long after his father had been sent to Azkaban and the Dark Lord appeared in their house as though taking his place. He remembers waking up one morning, as he has just woken now and then, like now, after the first few moments of neutrality, remembering where he was and what was happening in his life. Back then it had been a sick dizzying feeling of unreality, like all of this, this worry, this tension, this sudden new expectation of threat and pain – could not possibly have so suddenly replaced a life which up until then had felt entirely his own. He still remembers that gruesome realisation that all illusion he had ever had that he had any control over what happened to him was false, of knowing there was nothing he could do, no decision he could make that would be the right one.
He feels his lips move as she dips her head and goes, remembering the moment when he realised what was really important to him. It had been half way up a staircase as Hogwarts crumbled around them, wandless and searching frantically for his son. The staircase had suddenly swung out in a direction he had not wanted to go and he had felt dizzy with helplessness and sick with the motion of it, dropping to his hands and knees on the stones, feeling as though he might fall.
Home. It's not that he hasn't seen it since those bad years. But it's been a year now since the wedding and he has not seen it at all since then. Being busy, sorting out the new house, learning to be happy again. It's all taken work and the truth is -
He stops, almost nose to nose with Flint, who stands in front of his team as though protecting them from this onslaught of glitter, shimmer and arrogant petulance. Harry finds himself blinking rapidly, like some of that silver dust cloud got caught in his eye and he cannot help but take a step forward frowning at the same time as the silvery – gold head turns to stare at
“Nailed it,” he says - “Alright Potter?”

She punctuates every utterance with cushion punches shared out between the two boys, who blink at each other sleepily and shrug.
yet quite dare to say but Draco just nods, a very small fervent nod, his forehead against Harry's already, nods like he knows, like it's been that long for him too and Harry does not dare wonder if this is true. He can't speak for a moment; kissing Draco feels so right, like luxuriating in the sweetest drink he's ever tasted, removing his shirt with shaky fingers is like stripping the night sky from the stars until the whole sky blazes with stardust and he's drowning in it and it's the best death he has ever experienced.
George looks at him for a searching moment, trying to detect a hint of sarcasm. There isn't any, and he nods.
“Yes tell me, tell me you want me -”
He hears her, feels her even, but god help him there are flecks of flame amongst those sounds, crackles of fire, red and orange and tawny and bright that lap all the way across his skin and he wonders how he ever forgot the thing he realised that day in the weak sunlight on the bridge that he's repressed ever since. He wants to collapse for it, wants to wail
“Guys, shut up!”Hermione attempts to elbow everyone simultaneously and practically succeeds - “Fireworks are starting.”
“Does it hurt? Maybe we can find a way of -”
“What does it do?”
this?”
finally turn to look at him and Draco finds he cannot stand it, not that look on his father's face, the guilt and shame and yes, he is genuinely sorry and it is the last thing Draco can stand to hear.
“See Gin, this is why I wanted you to hush it. He's going to be insufferable now.”
“Bloody saviour with your bloody hero complex,” Draco snaps - “Maybe some of us are sick of being saved - did you ever think of that?”
“English?”
“Are you shitting me? I'm not that bored yet.” George goes silent. “Give me a bit, okay? I wanna just do something here.”
He didn't mean to come up here; fuck, how he didn't mean to come up here. He stops half way up the staircase, wondering why his treacherous feet have done this to him, what imp in the brain whispered that this was a good idea. Maybe it's hangover from his late night wanderings in sixth year, since that was the only other time he can remember being restless and troubled enough to wander round the castle late at night. Somehow, back then he had come back to this place again and again as though a part of him remembered something that had not happened yet, or he was rehearsing his steps for that final scene.
” Draco has to grab her by both arms as she tries to stalk off - “What did you say to me just last night? No cracks remember? You're not a coward are you?”
glad of it, though he cannot help but wonder where the frightened boy he caught glimpses of at Malfoy Manor and later in the battle – where that boy has got to. If he knows Malfoy – and somehow he's always rather felt as though he does- more completely than perhaps he should – then that's boy's still in there, hiding under the lip gloss and glitter. Why does he have to think about this

a whole world out there beyond the two of them, he grudgingly admits, and right now it looks like Ginny, standing glaring at them with her hands on her hips but – it must be said – with a faint smile in the corners of her mouth.
know, not about that, but since Ron and Viktor high five smugly over Hermione's head at this comment he assumes it's probably something that only happens when you have sex with other people, and he really doesn't know what to say about that.
Draco announces, containing slight hints of red and green, yellow and blue. Ghastly. Even so he finds himself catching Harry's eye as they stand getting pinned and snorting at a memory.
exactly the same no matter which of us you're talking to? Are we just like some homogenised ginger mass to you?”
no. Every time! Every time I left the Slytherin common room for a late night – whatever – I end up running into you and – well you know – I'd started to think you just
(he finds himself gulping on the immediately implied togetherness) – should be looking for somewhere to live, just the two of them. He never even asked Draco about wanting this, and it is only the assumption behind this that makes Draco even halfway wonder if he does. He had still half envisioned himself returning to the Manor with his parents. In the end they come to a tentative decision to stay here, with the place looking so bright now, so inviting, it seems a shame to put all their recent work on it to waste.
“Me too,” Ron nods - “Guess everyone likes what they don't get enough of – no offence!” he lifts his hands at a glare from Hermione. “I meant back home – the Burrow was always bloody noisy, wasn't it? Nice, yeah – but noisy. Give me a bit of quiet any day.”
- but instead he just shrugs -
And this time, like every other time, whoever is the dreamer and whoever is the holder – the holding is not enough and Harry's still whimpering , twisting in his arms, this boy, this idiot, this man now that he once so loved to hate and hated to love and is now just the other half of a glorious

It enrages him that there was a time when he was not in Potter's.

“Hermione, would you -” Narcissa draws herself up - “If it's alright with my sister, would you join us in the drawing room? Mr Weasley, would you be so kind as to fetch us tea?”
yes? So did it occur to you it was the place, not you?”
she watched the woman's lips twitch in what seemed to be a savage interior battle before she asked cautiously if Hermione might be able to ask Andromeda to visit with the child some time?
“Sounds right,” Ginny nods
He turns, grinning sheepishly, not actually letting go of Draco, never wanting to – not any more – it seems like he can't ever have enough, like it's the worst drag to ever stop touching him – now that he has finally given in to these sensations, he cannot be so harsh on himself as to deny either of them anything. Still there
he can feel himself moving closer like someone in a trance, unable to stop his own feet just needing to be closer to the sound and the beauty. It's like his own soul is up there to see in the colours emanating from the makeshift stage – his soul on display – or Draco's – in the moment he's not sure if there's a a difference.
But they're not thirteen any more and when their faces break apart Potter is glaring at him with clenched teeth and hate and confusion, his hand curled in a tight pinch at the back of Draco's neck -
“I can't – I -” he has to get out of this place - “I'm sorry I can't – not here -”
Although, as it turns out, the double four poster with the heavy green and gold drapes and the matching floor-length curtains were

“Yes I suppose she is also – what is the word – insidious? That is maybe not the word. Never mind. No. She is hugging her sister. It is all tres dramatique -” she rolls her eyes, not disapprovingly. An English person could never pull the expression off.
and Harry had to wheedle this out of him like untangling jewellry – ever think she deserved to die, and he certainly did not want her eaten by a snake. In fact Draco, Harry realised only after a very long time, never did, never would, wish anybody dead and hated physical violence, backing off from it every time like you'd back away from a slug.
Harry thinks, curling around his idiot protectively, Draco wriggling for a tedious length of time, packing blankets around himself, clutching a pillow, and wriggling his back against Harry's chest
“Double it is, Malfoy!” George grins - “Double on everything.”
“Good. Leave me alone.”
“I -” there are spots of brightness in Draco's cheeks, the battle against denying it all visible across his face - “I

The least human thing about Fleur, or so Bill has always said, is her abilty to get up bright and alert first thing in the morning. In fact, she does not seem to experience any of a normal person's transitional period between sleeping and waking. She simply wakes, blinks twice, stretches –
“Get out of my face and out of my way, Potter.”
“Shit,” he says to clarify, almost a question as he realises how it must have sounded to Draco, how Draco always misinterprets him so easily even at the best of times, how quick he is to doubt that he means anything to anyone, let alone Harry. He stares at Hermione helplessly for a second; she simply stares back with her eyebrows raised like it's obvious -
had he gone all this time ignoring it? Not that he had set out to fuck himself silly over the thought of him, but there he always was, his face, his hair, the infuriating fucking shape of him, fuelling every late night whimper, every savage wank. So many times his lips had shaped Malfoy's name in silence as he came, wanting to scream it. So many times when he had punched him or threatened him, been held back from him by his friends – he'd been hard for him too; it had been at least half of the reason fueling his rage. Really, thinking about it, Malfoy's annoyance levels, his petty insults – they had not been nearly enough to get under his skin the way he had let them, setting it prickling with the frenzied need to get closer to him – even if he had convinced himself it was only an urge to wipe the smirk from his face. It was
He thought Burbage was an idiot. He has told Harry many times, like this, curled up and sniffing in bed, half shaking, half still crying. He mocked her in school, scorning her classes – which he never actually attended - her appearance, her mannerisms, her views. He would have hated her, he told Harry, if he had considered her worthy of even that consideration. He thought she was ridiculous, backwards, a joke. He did

He swaggers like the he thinks the floor owes him something for walking on it, and Harry wishes he could see better through that dazzle because he could swear to all the stars he only ever knew one person swagger like that and it sets the hairs on the back of his neck prickling – not unpleasantly, to hear that rather shrill voice insisting -
“- from the people we lost,” Harry nods solemnly.
Draco hisses, lip twitching, but he's scared, for all the spite he manages to force into the word - “Don't ruin it, Potter.” He waits until Harry inclines his head ever so slightly in an agreement they both read as
There is a far away look in Narcissa's eyes, the gaze of looking back over an ocean of time and reasoning. Andromeda nods -
Hermione looks at her as though expecting more. She has noticed that people do this to her a lot. But she does not feel a need to explain herself further; it's none of their business after all. She has never been the kind of girl who other girls like and while she suspects that both of these girls are the same in their way, she has never been particularly interested in being otherwise. She

Draco says with a heavy sigh - “It's about being stuck in a burning building and getting rescued by -” he stops and looks away cagily, picking at a non existent thread on the oilslick black of his sleeve. It's quite specific, now he thinks about it – it's about being rescued from the fire that was a bit your fault to begin with by someone you loved who you'd kind of assumed would just leave you to die – as soon as he words it in his head he realises he can't say that. Not to Potter.

Luna says, nodding as she follows him - “It's quite special, isn't it?”
“She has eyes,” Luna shrugs - “They're very pretty, don't you think? I've seen her a lot. Anyway she tried going out with Harry before she worked out she was gay, so of course she worked out that he was too even if he didn't – or bi, maybe, she says she's not sure, either way it doesn't matter just now since he's been in love with Draco since first year.”

There's a bed and a guttering candle flame and a moonbeam thrown hastily over two sets of legs like a blanket that will always leave something cold. There's a hand pulling a real blanket up around them and the silence of not knowing what to say that also covers not needing to say anything. There is one boy who starts to cry because his feelings are too big for his body, and the other who holds him, and in the end says -
“Does this mean they're – getting on? I thought -” she flaps a hand - “Well we heard them after breakfast, raising voices in the hallway, and I think – I think -”
“Argh!” Hermione yells - “You two! Milennium! Fireworks! New year! Trafalgar Square! Idiots!”
Nobody is exactly rude to her at breakfast but she feels the iciness when she walks into the room and stiffens herself in return, pulling herself up straighter than ever, jerking her head up higher, aware that this will only alienate her further but knowing no other retort. The Potter boy at least makes an effort to smile at her and she is appalled by how grateful it makes her feel.
“Yeah -” he risks a cautious sideays glance, but Draco's face is that bewildering blank that he both uses for truth and hides behind. “I wanted to tell you straight away – when I realised – but I couldn't find you and there was so much happening -”
Pansy's lip curls almost ferally back from her teeth - “Fuck's sake – Draco's completely -” she pantomimes a melodramatic swooning gesture, “-then?”
“Yeah? Come to stop me, have you?”
“I most certainly did -”
“You love me.”
She stops, half breathless with the effort of this speech.
want to hurt Draco, that has pictured the bruises he could leave on that perfect skin so many times, he has torn rents in him with his fingernails repeatedly in his mind, but he won't, not now, not much. They're both only half dressed when Draco drops down onto the mattress he previously derided and it's him who pulls Harry down on to him, insistent hands and angry lips that want to bruise themselves against him, and that's fine, he thinks, when Draco's kisses hurt with teeth against his throat; we were always meant to tear each other to pieces, break on the shores of each other, it's right, it's good – he kisses back almost as hard. Then the little bastard touches his cock through his pants, and he almost screams. He touches right back and for a moment they stare at each other in a frightened, quiet lust-drenched stillness, terrified of how urgently, how violently they want this and terrified of so much more, that thing Harry named once and certainly isn't going to name again just this minute. Thank God there's a spell to take clothes off; both of them mutter it now almost as one mind.

but as it comes to his lips, so it comes into his mind – the fact that ever since he can remember, people have commented on that stupid scar, acting as though it was the marker of his entire personality, in awe of it, heaping accolades upon him for it – everything other than anybody ever trying to simply kiss it better – like this was so simple nobody even thought of it. It strikes him as painfully
Harry cannot quite control his nervous laugh -
“Good, I hate you too and we're not little kids any more rubbing off in closets. Slam it into me, Potter, fuck me hard with all that hate, make it hurt -” he looks shocked for a moment as though all of this was absolutely not what he meant to say and just spilled raw from a pit of him that has wanted to say it for far too long. Harry gets it, he really does -

“Talk to them.” He means it to be a question but the inflection does not quite come out - “You want me to talk to Harry? And what -?”
“Draco Malfoy,” Luna nods “They're very sad and often angry and when he wants to cover up his feelings they go all flinty because he's trying to be hard but he's not – but underneath all that they're very kind eyes, like his mother's only silvery.”
He tugs his sleeve down to the wrist and holds it there, spins around and marches out the room almost at a run.

It's exactly as he feared; everyone stares at him. He forces himself to sit down even though it makes him feel positively sick, and for a moment he just breathes. He had hardly realised this – how scared of the dinner table he was – any table apparently, any group of people like this. He stares down at his hands, white knuckled and clutching the table edge – for a long while without looking up. Then he looks up, and obviously it's Potter, he's sat down right opposite him and though everyone else is doing their best not to watch him, this idiot isn't, is he? He's staring at Draco like he's an affront to their breakfast table, like he would quite like to hex him right off it. It is all he can do not to tremble. Instead he focuses on turning that chin wobble into a twitch of the lips, and it feels like a wash of relief when he feels it, and the sneer allows him to glare back at Potter across the table, sodding saviour with his fucking hero complex, Draco
“Can we expect your husband's presence?” Andromeda finally asks with faint shrill.
“So why do it?” Potter asks, his voice gentler than Draco has maybe ever heard it – especially talking to
“Oh, when you put it like that -”
“Shut the fuck up Pansy, what's -” a first year Slytherin student comes scurrying up to them and stop, staring at Draco for a moment with round, starstruck eyes.
“That is – you know that is not a healthy relationship my dude.”
“He would have said I -”
“Show me.” Why does he have to sound so demanding? So authoritative? Under other circumstance it would have been quite painfully arousing.
Harry has to remind himself for the hundredth time that Draco actually
“Does it have to be? No. No two experience ever are the same but I – I have grown up believing I could do anything, spoilt, yes, like you I think. I thought I was perfect, that I could never fail at anything in my life and when I was chosen for my school's Champion I am nodding, I am thinking, yes yes of course it is me because I am the best!

doesn't watch him go in his cloud of glitter and silvery shimmer, trailing starlight and sandalwood behind him. He doesn't stare after Malfoy until he's a dazzling pinprick at the far end of the field and the distant crackle of electric guitar joins the crackle of autumn leaves under Harry's feet. He doesn't do that at all.

“You think I brought you all here because I'm such a big fan of your family? No. No way – alright, your mother is – I owe her and she's decent – I think – but I saved you all because of you. You twat,” he adds, just to keep it light enough for Draco not to run away. It works. When Draco rolls his eyes and sighs -
“A pain in the arse,” Ginny clarifies - “A knobhead. A mega dick. Honestly, I don't know how much clearer you need me to be. He won't shut up, keeps calling me names, singing that rude song about the turtle day and night and I swear to shit Georgie, every time Luna and I try to – I mean try to do
“Show me?” he smiles gently.
“Here -”
“Manly,” Draco announces, dripping sarcasm. “Really. So. You're here, are you? Merlin's ballsack, it stinks in here.”
“She's a good egg, McGonagall,” Luna nods - “She let me stroke her behind the ears once – as a cat,” she adds when Blaise looks at her funny.
“We've – never been introduced – no,” he manages, proud of how cool it comes out.
It feels to Draco as though he has to be struggling, the push of his body against Potter's is so vicious, so intent, every fibre of him so hard it can only mean violence. But he

“So what's new?”
“Just over the next rise,” he finds himself murmuring out loud. It is the first thing either of them have said in quite a long time and Harry looks at him directly for the first time in a while, Draco looking back and raising a caustic eyebrow to mask any nervous anxiety -
“When are you going to stop wearing that stupid scarf anyway? We've been out of school four years.”
“Look -” Harry tries to help him - “What I said -”
“Fuck's sake – what do you

“Nope. Definitely only twice. And I'm not doing it again either.”

He finds that he has to acknowledge – just about every time he looks at Draco and sometimes even when he doesn't – how utterly in love with him he is. He then has to follow this thought through to the panicky conclusion that everyone he has ever loved has died. That every single time one of them left him he had sworn to himself he would not open up his heart that quickly again. Because he always has, hasn't he? He has always accepted all the good things that ever came his way, friendship, affection, attention even. It had taken him

“Luna -” Harry says slowly, oh that's

“Harry – did you never think of – of – of trying to make friends
“Blimey -”
“Thank you Mr Potter that will do. You may be seated. Mr Malfoy, please rise.”
They go home.
He closes his eyes and thrusts out his hand.
All of the above were excellent reasons, in Harry’s opinion, to regret coming to the reunion.
He's more worried about where working with his father might lead.
So I think they both expect your participation.
Just then, her snores stuttered and she opened her mouth in a yawn, emitting an almost bird-like trill, her tail flicking upwards and away from her eyes which remained tightly closed. Draco’s own eyes widened and he realised he was holding his breath.
“Have they found anything?”
“I'm the
Harry Potter
A stage Draco’s already been through, and which passed in a flash so brief he sometimes can’t believe it happened at all.
He took Harry’s arm. “We’re getting out of here, Potter,” he said. Harry understood immediately: he was going to Apparate them out. Except… Malfoy screwed his eyes shut, tensed as if about let the Apparition magic flow through him, and then—
You...like it? Me doing this journalist...thing?
Draco had shuddered.
He no longer smells like an ad for expensive cologne and Italian holidays. He smells like sex, like spunk, like heated skin.
Draco furrowed his brow. Of all the parts of his demonic life he had become accustomed to, Jeff the Niffler sure wasn’t the one he’d thought would follow him into his human adventure.
“We might be gone an hour,” Neville added.
“Wait.” Harry had grabbed his wrist, his lips a breath away from Draco’s. He’d gazed at him through half-closed eyes and grinned. “I got you a birthday gift.”
“I’ve received the books and leaflets we ordered,” Hermione had continued as if Harry hadn’t said a thing. She’d rummaged in her school bag before handing a stack of books to Draco. “Here. You’ve got more material on the Muggle personality and career tests we talked about: Holland Codes, Myers-Briggs, NEO PI-R... If you take these and apply the formulas you’ve showed me, you should be set.”
“I need a special type of quill to sign the legal agreements for the Romania plant, but I can’t seem to find it,” he drawls. Despite his clear annoyance, he has a bored expression carefully in place. Harry knows it can only mean one thing: that Draco Malfoy’s been in this cupboard for far too long and is coming at his wit’s end.
to build it, Harry.”
Hermione’s steady gaze was unnerving. “Perhaps it was in a book,” she mused, “but you clearly took the advice to heart.” She leaned over the parchments covered in Draco’s neat scrawl, Arithmancy formulas based on the personality tests he and Harry had taken the previous day. “Harry was excited to be paired with you,” she added almost as an afterthought.
It’s just that… it’s a bittersweet irony, isn’t it?
I never said anything about gay.
“It was pretty amazing for me, too.” Harry hadn’t intended to blurt such a truth, especially not in front of Draco Malfoy. But now that it’d been said, he couldn’t bring himself to regret it. The loneliness, the sense of being apart from the rest of the world, the sense of being wanted for whatever people saw when they looked at him—it had lifted in the past hour he’d spent with Malfoy.
Malfoy’s hot breath hits Harry’s cheek as he speaks, but Harry keeps looking resolutely straight ahead. Every one of his nerve endings sings with Malfoy’s attention; with the minute, purposeful movements of his fingers now twined with Harry’s on the armrest.
“Merlin!” Harry threw his hands up and stepped back and away from Draco. “Fuck, you’re just as selfish and heartless as you’ve ever been, aren’t you?”
“I know you're lying, Draco,” he tells him quietly.
a little voice at the back of his head whispers.
“Yeah, yeah,” Ron says, lifting his hands. “No Auror mode tonight. Which means I’ve a desperate need to get sloshed and eat a tray of canapés. I reckon it’s time we go celebrate your crush’s thirty first, yeah?”
“That’s… lovely,” he tells Ernestina,” but can I have some eggs, still?”
“Shut up.”
“Is that it, Headmistress?” Harry asked next to Draco. He sounded calm, the opposite of how Draco felt. McGonagall leaned forward slightly. She looked at them from over her spectacles.
As Malfoy moved up the queue, and Harry stared some more, Ron gently grabbed him by the shoulder. “Come on, Harry. If you’re not going to finish…” He nodded towards Harry’s plate. “Time to go back to the office. Let’s go.”
“A wife?” Malfoy snorts. He flicks Harry a once-over. “Way to work on that plan.”
(oh, for fuck’s sake),
“Wha—” Ron asked around his mouthful of sandwich when he noticed Harry staring slack-jawed over his shoulder, a forkful of salad halfway to his mouth. He turned around and simply said, “Oh.”
“You wish, Malfoy. I’m only here to help a friend.” To stress his point, Harry clapped Longbottom on the shoulder. He stalked closer to where Draco and Luna were sitting, glaring at Draco. “In fact, if I’d known you’d be here, I would have picked another day.”
“Do you?”
“Then why do you refuse to even hear me say how I feel about you?” Harry bursts.
Harry’s eyes glinted, hot and turbulent, and he set the crate down before plastering on his own version of a disdainful smile. The stupid bastard looked as fit as he did in Draco’s ridiculous daydreams, and Draco felt a flare of embarrassment and annoyance.
Draco wanted to ask what Jeff was seeing in him that was so grim, but before he had time to open his mouth, the Niffler had Disapparated, leaving behind only a puff of purple, sulfur-scented smoke.
“Hold on,” Hermione lifts a finger at him. “Harry, before I give any of my hard-earned money to my dear husband, can you please confirm what's going on between you and Malfoy?”
“Not in the slightest.” Draco gave her a small smile. This time though, it was entirely genuine. “So, the Prothimioscope.”
to walk. Come on.”
It’s just that Harry doesn’t really want to let time heal that particular wound. Because it feels too good. It burned too bright.
Luna took his scarf and cloak. “Thank you, Draco. It was a nice room. That’s very kind of you to say.”
to contact me.”
“Whether they’re
He’d caught Harry’s wistful eyes across the table. Everybody knew about Fred Weasley’s death in the Battle of Hogwarts. Draco had heard his parents discuss it during the days leading to the trials. He didn’t really know Fred Weasley, yet the thought of another classmate’s life being lost to the war had left him feeling strangely bereft for weeks. Retrospectively, it must have been a symptom of his numbered demon days.
Draco sidesteps their group and walks faster. He wishes, idly, that he could have brought his running clothes. Lets out a rueful laugh at the thought. Running would help him think, for sure — but the streets are full of Muggles, and he can’t be arsed to hide and transfigure all his clothes for the half hour it would take to run home.
“I remembered how I used to watch you, to follow you around.”
Mephistopheles bristled like he always did when he wasn’t sure whether Draco was pulling his leg or not. Given that Draco did it every occasion he got, he was surprised the demon hadn’t dropped dead from sheer irritation yet.
“Fuck,” Harry gasped. “Yeah, like this—”
Draco pushed her hand to look at it.
“And now you live your life as a charity donor.”
Luna’s kitchen.
talk?”
Do you want
She laughed. “You wish.”
Merlin, no. I think I’ve always known. I never had time to acknowledge it until recently, though. And then Ginny told me she thought she was attracted to Luna, and—”
It brought back a flood of memories.
“We need to move,” Malfoy’s voice was matter-of-fact, very close to him.
“I only know that it’s emerald and silver, and that it has been handed down from one generation of Malfoys to another for centuries. Other than that,” he shrugged, his demonic tendencies kicking in with every minute of horrified incredulity he put Jeff through, “it’s nothing but old metal and stone to me.”
And in turn, it makes it much easier to observe the habits of the people he’s missioned to spy on. In this case, Draco and everyone in his orbit.
Draco sighs. “You know how well he deals with change. Thanks ever so much for that.” He smiles at the thought. “I still can’t believe you’re leaving.”
“Sorry,” Hermione smiles at them in apology, “my boyfriend had some unpleasant experiences with Acromantula in his youth. He does love and support them, though!”
“Potter,” he says, his natural drawl loaded with a showy nonchalance. “I was just about to go for a run. If you’d like to join me…?”
his lashes were, how much darker than the rest of his hair. How his eyes burned like embers despite their paleness, their unique shade of silver and ice. How smooth his skin looked, how Harry itched to run his knuckles along the sharp line of his jaw—
“Look at me, Draco.”
Potter turns, watching him warily — something in his demeanour like a deer in a circle of wolves.
This time, he’s nervous for entirely different reasons. The first time he was here, he’d half expected Draco to turn him down — to bring him in for an interview as a joke, then send him away laughing — and secretly he’d hoped it would be the case.
He’d started talking to him, mesmerized by Malfoy’s glinting eyes behind those glasses, his thin lips curled in disdain or amusement as he and Harry had fallen in conversational stride. There was no casual chitchat with Malfoy. It was all or nothing, tension springing out of the most harmless comment, challenges hidden in every word.
What can Harry tell Ron?
“You’re my bloody
I managed to say the names of five vegetables during our staff meeting this morning and Harry chimed in and added three more, so technically Team Aurors wins one more round.
At Potter’s admission, Draco’s head snaps up. Potter is looking at him, eyes hard, chin up.
“Kill Harry Potter?” He hoped Mephistopheles couldn’t see the bobbing of his Adam’s apple as he swallowed. “A ridiculous and utterly useless plan, if you want my opinion, but if it makes the bosses happy...”
Draco’s mouth went dry. His hands dropped to Harry’s arse cheeks, tentatively pulling them apart. Harry let out a soft whine at the touch, and Draco was powerless to resist. He dropped to his knees, his hands on Harry’s hips, his face level with his arse. Harry glanced at him over his shoulder, an almost nervous glint in his eye.
“Glad you approve,” Draco murmurs back, and they’re kissing again. It’s a blur, really. Harry is everywhere. Hands in Draco’s hair, fingers pulling lightly; tongue in Draco’s mouth, hot and unbearably soft; taut body crowding Draco’s against the door, erection sliding against Draco’s own, and it’s good, so good,
Harry sniggered. “Exactly, yeah.”
“I think Draco would love to discuss this with you,” he tells her earnestly.
he coughed, “—to this conclusion without your

“What, like it’s
“That’s what you like about me.”
“Well, now is as good a time as any,” Harry says, nipping at his jaw, down his throat, licking a hot trail down his collarbones.
“You have to promise me this secret stays between us.”
There’s a fair chance at least one of them will get hurt in whatever it is that they started, but in this moment, it’s a chance Harry is willing to take.
But the back of his hand brushed Harry’s, and he didn’t pull away. Harry smiled all the way to their destination.

Because Malfoy had lived a fascinating life the past twelve years, and Harry realises he really knows nothing about it.
He can feel Malfoy’s frown in the dark. “It wouldn’t be going public. Just telling my friend about the amazing sex I just had.”
In front of them, Hermione Granger turned and scowled.
Malfoy exhales carefully. “I could have sworn… That night, at the Chamber of Commerce, I was certain you were…” He stops, bites his lip.
I am done exposing myself, worrying how every one of my words could be understood or interpreted. I need to do what is good for me. And I’d decided, years ago, that what was good for me was staying away from the media.”
standards
“Over here, Auror Potter,” she pulls him by the arm, gentle. “I can sign the transfer forms.”
Smith seemed to mistake their schoolboy collusion with yawns. She stood.
The atmosphere, hushed and intimate a moment ago, changes abruptly. The room feels several degrees colder, and Draco’s expression shifts from open to narrow-eyed focus. Harry has the sense to give a minute shake of his head. His heart is hammering in his chest, his body is cold, frozen on the spot. His mind rifles through the emergency instructions of the Ministry,
She huddled closer, even though Draco’s Warming charm still held.
Dear Madam Bulstrode,
“Mistor Potter is too kind. Sorry the kitchen is a mess, sir!”
The bet was to fart in a Ministry lift containing no less than three people. When Plinius, Kingsley and Gawain all walked into the same lift as me, I saw an opportunity and took it.
He just stands here, shoulder to shoulder with Draco, disoriented. Another round of flashes, and Harry shakes himself, panicked. He impulsively pushes Draco away from him, charges the journalists, hoping to make a quick, easy exit, while the journos bleat at him:
“I said I had news,” Draco says quietly. He waves at the parchment in silent suggestion. Harry casts a wordless Lumos
Coming with a muffled sob, all over the sheets, letting his orgasm tear through him at the sound of Draco’s voice. Letting his breath slow down after, his cheek still resting on Draco’s hip. Draco’s fingers carding through his hair, soothing, lulling him to sleep.
“Harry?”
When Draco hears his son, he turns mortally pale, his purple-ringed eyes fixed on Harry. There’s a plea in them, in the desperate tilt of his brows. Harry can read Draco’s thoughts as loud as if Draco had spoken them:
Disclaimer: this chapter earned me a marriage proposal.
“You. Me. Nothing in between.”
and I might need your help.”
“I would have never accepted this mission if I couldn’t protect you and your son the way you needed me to.”
“Think about the outcome, mate,” he says. “Think about the good it could do if Malfoy turns out to be the bastard we suspect he is. Plus, you get to stay in London for a while, and we get to work together on another case,” Ron adds more cheerfully, elbowing him lightly in the side.

family, regardless of whether they’re related by blood. He supposes even someone like Malfoy has best friends. And, knowing him a little bit better, he’s not as surprised as he might have been a week ago.

Two: I happen to know several other gay men. And people all over the LGBT spectrum.
Harry held out his hand. And Draco smiled, and took a step towards his future.
See? They drive me to distraction. They put me in a poetic mood.
He circles an arm around Malfoy’s shoulders, patting his back. It’s late, and he’s both blissfully tired and mortified to be having this conversation, and deep down Malfoy’s not wrong. Harry’s not ready to come out to the world. And least of all with Draco Malfoy — a thief, an ex-Death Eater, Harry’s old nemesis —  on his arm.
Draco curled his hands around the book. He took a breath, and said:
Draco sighs. He had hoped for more time… He thought he could at least go for a run, take a shower, feel blissfully empty by the time he’d meet Harry. On the other hand, Harry’s here right now. Might as well pull the metaphorical bandage, see where that takes them.

apparently.”
“Scorpius is autistic,” he says. “He was diagnosed with Asperger’s syndrome about three years ago. He has regular appointments with a special needs therapist. She helps him with reading social cues and communication, self-soothing skills, handling his magic, and so forth. He’s been doing much better since we were able to determine what made him...
“Well, shit, Pansy,” Blaise murmurs in the stunned silence.
Draco’s face is in shadows, but his eyes gleam in the low light. They’re fixed on Harry, and Harry can’t move, can’t look away.
Hermione walks into the foyer, pushing the pushchair in front of her. It’s a light, compact little thing, but it’s actually indestructible. He’s seen Ron and Hermione push it around the streets of London and the dirt roads near their house alike.
deliberately not caring whether it hits Draco as well as himself. He pulls his pants and jeans back on. The glittering lights of London and the sweet summer air of the evening seem to taunt him, mock him. He’s not sure he wants to stay here much longer.
“I know,” Harry repeats. “I can wait for him—” he gestures in the direction of the parlour, drops his hand at Ernestina’s raised brow, “—or I can come back later.”
“Wh-what?”
If the person sitting across from him was a girl, Harry’d have a name for the butterflies in his stomach.
“Oh,” Harry hesitates. “I— I don’t know if I should… it’s— it’s family time, after all.”
“Alright,” Draco said, and they looked at each other, smiling. A snowball landed on Harry’s shoulder, snapping them out of their moment.
PS: oh, another betting pool, you say? That’s one bet I’m willing to put good money on.
“I’m not betraying you,” Harry murmurs. His fingers slide between Draco’s, back and forth, a reminder of their first touch.
On the breast pocket of his shirt, a small but unmissable rainbow-coloured badge.
Kingsley fixes him with a level look. “They’ve been on Malfoy’s case for years. Zacharias Smith leads the auditing team and swears they’ve never found any irregularities in Caduceus’ statements. In appearance at least, Malfoy is clean. Too clean. Not only does his company display impeccable financial records, but he also owns and runs several charities for which he donates substantial amounts of Caduceus’ profits. Still, there’s something about the way it all started that makes us suspect that Caduceus — and by extension, Malfoy — are not as guiltless as they seem to be.”
“The only thing I’m saying is that you’re still alone all these years later, and so am I. There’s a reason for it.”
“Then what do you suggest, Draco? That I keep going back to Kingsley, telling him that the only information I have on you is what an outstanding citizen you are and hoping he’ll take my word for it?”
Draco lifts an eyebrow. In the half-darkness, his sarcastic expression looks almost cruel. “An outstanding citizen? Is that what you call your shags?”
“Draco—”
Hermione considers him with lifted eyebrows that tell him the conversation isn’t over. “Then you’re clearly not doing your bit, Harry. I’m starting to think you don’t want to meet anyone.”
Before sleep takes him, the thought crosses Harry’s mind that it doesn’t matter what he’s allowed to tell Draco. He’ll keep proving it to him. Actions have always spoken louder than words.
“Granger and—” Harry had stood up from the bed. “How—?”
“Erm,” Harry says, brushing his palms down his Auror uniform. Draco rounds on him, gaping. He’s about to say something biting and snarky, Harry’s sure, but Penelope Clearwater smirks, putting her arm over his shoulder.
And sinks to his knees.
It’s a slow, exploring kiss. The swell of Malfoy’s lower lip is soft under Harry’s tongue; the angles of Malfoy’s hips, pressing into Harry’s, are shocking and wonderful in their maleness. For a passing second, Harry’s mind rifles through the kisses he’s shared with girls. The mental inventory crumbles to insignificance when Malfoy opens his mouth with a soft moan and lets Harry in. Harry surges in, deepening the kiss. He brings his other hand up to cup the side of Malfoy’s neck, his jaw. He tastes cigarettes and the bitter sweetness of his own come on Malfoy’s tongue, and something melts in his chest, hot and trickling. He could get to his knees for Malfoy in this moment. He could drop to his knees and free the erection he can feel straining against his own and suck Malfoy until he hears him cry—
Draco’s stomach flipped. He could feel the tips of his ears heating. “He was?”
Their little chat, though, seemed miles away from Harry’s mind. Yards below Draco, spurred on by their teammates’ cries, Harry was barreling towards the fluttering golden ball at a vertiginous speed. Draco, rooted to the spot, didn’t even try to catch up to him.
He places a hand in the small of Draco’s back, where his shirt sticks to his sweaty skin. He murmurs a negligent Scourgify
Harry smiled, hands in Malfoy’s hair. “Come to mine. I think it’s soon enough.”
“Now,” Draco says, eyes staring into the middle distance. His voice sounds thick. “Now I’m going to pick myself off the floor, make myself a cup of tea, and clean up this mess…”
Draco wants to melt into him. He opens his legs to let Harry slip a thigh between them. He pushes his hips forward, his cock hard and rubbing against Harry's leg, hoping Harry's as eager as he is—
“We need our best agent on the case. We want you to infiltrate Malfoy’s inner circle and help us identify which lead we need to follow so we can be ready to strike and catch him in the act when he steps out of line.”
Ha. That’s my job, isn’t it?
“That’s what they want you to think, Draco,” she answered with a sweet, candid smile. “Mainstream media, that is. It’s not your fault. You work for them, after all.”
Should I tell him?

“Pure-blood wizards rarely leave the Wizarding Quarter,” Draco said quietly. He
“Harry, regardless… if you were to act on it, you’d be starting a relationship with your prime suspect. Who knows you’re working on the case. And would have to either be stupid not to mind, or have ulterior motives. Ethically speaking… it’s a nightmare.”
Not that Draco could really count himself as one anymore.
a normal situation. Malfoy complied without even lifting an eyebrow.
The closest Apparition point was below Westminster Bridge. When their feet hit the cobblestones of the quay, the cold air that filled Draco’s lungs made him cough in surprise.
It seemed as though the Hogwarts staff had decided that the Christmas decor had to be truly over the top this year, as if to make up for the remainder of destruction still strewn across the castle and grounds. The gutted walls, the torn paintings and tapestries, the fallen trees and impact holes; stark reminders of the war remained everywhere one looked. Yet the trees were festooned with gold, the fairy lights glittered along the path, Hogwarts was all decked in resplendent colours. It all brought winter holidays to mind. Outside, everything was covered in a thick layer of fresh, crisp snow and scattered with illuminated trees. The landscape didn’t look like the battle scene it had been, only half a year ago. It looked like the Hogwarts Draco had always known and loved, mere days away from Christmas.
Harry turns to Draco.
Then several things happen at once, as though in slow motion.
“To be fair, it often does,” Harry says, softly, encouragingly.
There’s a stunned pause, during which Harry can practically hear the gears switching in his friends’ brains. Hermione sits very still, anxiety rolling off her. Ron leans back, a shade paler, his freckles stark against his white skin.
“Is it alright, Headmistress?” Harry asked. “That we don’t have answers yet?”
Harry frowns. “It doesn’t affect my ability to work, Ron.”
“Voldermort didn't manage to kill me, but this evening very well might.”
“Oi!”
“Of course you’d say that.” Draco snorts a bitter laugh. “You’re… too
Harry’s mouth watered, and he licked his lips.
And Malfoy had left him completely thunderstruck.
Hot, bitter come filled Draco’s mouth in sputtering spurts as Harry shook and thrust into him, all to the pleasure of his climax. Caught in the moment, Draco didn’t think of pulling away. He swallowed it, tasting Harry all the way down his throat, come and saliva leaking down his chin as he licked Harry clean. He hadn’t realised he was panting. Carefully, he pulled his finger away.
Draco looks so cornered, so vulnerable, Harry desperately wants to take his face in his hands and kiss him. Instead, he wraps his hands around his knees, takes a breath.
I was on the right side. At first, I believed in the ideals my parents had been feeding me for years. It was only after seeing those ideals in practice that I realised how horrifically wrong I had been. By that point, it was too late for me to back out.
He’s not sure what Harry sees in his expression. His eyes are closed, and he starts when Harry’s hands come to rest on the dip of his waist.
“You’re the best,” Weasley told her, pulling her close to him with an arm around her shoulders and kissing the top of her bushy head. “Helping Malfoy...you truly are an angel,” he added playfully.
Dear Drake,
“I would have thought it is, now that you’re neither.”
“Hey—
Apparently, there are people who DON'T KNOW WHO EDITH PIAF IS. We need to remedy this situation, people. This is
“Mistor Draco is sure…?”
Do you still think of yourself as one of the ‘bad guys’?
But apparently, an ex-Slytherin, ex-Death Eater lover was not advantageous enough for the Saviour’s public image.”
“I’ve come to appreciate them early on in life,” Harry says. He hopes he manages to sound earnest and not sarcastic. Next to him, Ron lets out a sound that’s equal parts cough and whimper. Harry’s going to need wine to keep his acting up to Hermione’s standards.
“Me too,” Draco tells him mindlessly, arching his neck into Harry’s touch. “Me too,” he says again, just because he can.
After Draco’s left, the light of the sun fades entirely. Night settles; Harry forgets to cast a Lumos
“You certainly didn’t seem to mind a minute ago.”
Not just my cock in you
Harry wants to fidget with the hem of his t-shirt.
“My solution is anything that gets you out of your post-divorce funk—” Pansy had said, leaning forward, elbows on her knees.
Draco is watching him, his chest rising and falling with each of his quick, heavy breaths. The features of his beautiful face are twisted like he’s in agony, his hands clasped in his lap like he’s stopping himself from reaching out. Harry wants to crawl over to him on all fours, take Draco’s face between his hands, cradle it as he kisses him. And kisses him again.
Draco can’t blame him: he hasn’t come so hard in ages. Speaking of…
“I want you to suck me off again.”
pricks, not because I
Hermione, meanwhile, was working with them on the best way to close the topic once and for all. She was certain that the only way the Ministry would ever drop the case against Draco was if Harry told Kingsley the truth about the three million Galleons from Nesting’s payout. The main hurdle was ensuring Ernestina wouldn’t be charged for her shares in the company, and that Draco wouldn’t be blamed for protecting her. Draco had dug his heels in at first, something Harry easily understood. He wondered if it had been the same for his aunt, once — if she’d been on the edge of telling Harry the truth for years, only to swallow it, keep it under wraps, until Hagrid had showed up and forced the Dursleys to reveal their secret with one swift, life-changing kick at their door. While Draco hadn’t hidden anything that unsavory, he’d never thought Nesting would come under the spotlight. From Harry’s standpoint, Draco’s secret seemed inoffensive, but Draco had spent years living with it, the once-small matter growing with time, becoming foundational to Draco’s present life, to Caduceus, to Draco’s friendship with Ernestina. Harry knew it: the older they got, the more it hurt when the secrets came out.
“So,” Harry says. He doesn’t know if he should smile or scowl, so he settles on watching  Hugo play with his fingers.
A ball of light, blue and blindingly bright, burst from the tip and fell in the dark. It reverberated on worn, humid stone stairs before disappearing long seconds later.
he said authoritatively. Harry felt a shiver of misplaced excitement shoot down his spine, and the door flew open.
It looked like all he could thank for it was a spliff and an almost-kiss with Harry Potter.
Most people tittered and Ron Weasley put his arm around his girlfriend’s shoulder, kissing her cheek. “No one would ever dare accuse you of bunking off, ‘Mione.”
Draco fought the impulse to grab Potter by the collar of his shirt. “Well, it must be like looking in the mirror for you, then. Which is your favourite activity, isn’t it?”
All of it implied. And it only serves to infuriate Draco more.
He taps on Draco’s arm when he finally reaches him. Draco whirls around instantly, as if he’d been expecting Harry to do exactly that. He gives his shoulder a sharp jerk, away from Harry’s touch. They’ve stopped running. They’re facing each other, panting. Rain plasters Draco’s hair to his head, his fringe to his forehead, droplets of water running down his long nose. His eyes are no longer cold — they’re blazing, furious, and the thought crosses Harry’s mind that maybe he should have let this one slide. He distantly registers that he’s getting cold and wet, too. Yet he’s burning up, lungs and legs and heart on fire. And Draco is just staring daggers at him, and he won’t be the first to speak. For all the stunned anguish Harry’s feeling, he’s glad that Draco’s reacting with anger and not his usual distant coolness.
going to be your experimental gay phase.”
Frustrated, Draco closed his eyes and pinched the bridge of his nose. He pushed his fringe out of his eyes before returning his attention back at Luna.
Draco stared at the tiny dragon in mild horror. He had to admit she was pretty, with a back adorned in shimmering moss-green scales and tiny spikes. Her webbed wings were purple, as were her snout and belly, and they glittered opalescent against the firelight while wisps of grey smoke spiralled up from her gently fluttering nostrils. Her thin green tail curled around her body and over her eyes, as though she was shielding herself from the light.
In the tense silence that follows, the clicking of nails in the marble corridor is unmistakable. Balzac appears in the foyer with a friendly

She sauntered away to meet her laughing girlfriend, and Draco was left to discreetly glance upward, wondering if he’d catch a glimpse of his supposedly beautiful aura.
“I'm not – I mean – nobody. Shut up.”
“Come on,” he says after far too few seconds of hug - “Let's do this.”
“Hey! Hey I wasn't. Actually I think it
- “Brilliant. You were beautiful – everything -” he blinks, tries to get a gip on himself - “Except that one song – it was all the wrong colours.”
For a brief, painful moment, he relishes the look of hurt and anger that flashes across Harry's face before he turns away in silence to rummage on the floor. Draco forces himself to ignore him as he pulls a bag out from under the bed and starts filling it with things from his wardrobes – most of the contents of his wardrobes, in fact – the old extendable charms on these bags hold fast – then books, and for some reason his fifth year school bag,

is transformed in Harry's head into a crashing rainbow paint splash of colour. And in the middle of all that colour is Draco, the one thing that has always both kept him grounded and made him fly, ivory and gold in the middle of all that colour.
“We're all just human, Hermione. If we only learnt one thing this whole time I think perhaps that's it.”
“Half? Are you mental? It' three times the rate for you, you twonk; actually fuck it, you can shop for free – it's what Fred would have wanted.”
He sees Hermione close her books, asking Luna if she's got this now – and Luna has – before hugging Narcissa Malfoy, appraising the others with a nod and going home with her parents, taking Ron with her, introducing him to the family for the first time as he goes to spend time with them; in return, she says, for all the time she has spent at the Burrow. He sees Draco snort a laugh at he expression on his mother's face when the girl hugs her, and he sees the wry smile Narcissa makes when Hermione's back is turned. He sees Hermione shake hands awkwardly with Draco before sighing and just enveloping him and Harry both in one simultaneous hug. She comes back every couple of days now to visit, bringing things for the house and for them all, smiling with a flush in her cheeks for the first time since the war.
“Yes, that makes sense, I suppose,” Draco stalled, not actually knowing where to go from here. “Well, have a nice weekend,” was all he could apparently come up with.
“So what about you? I would have thought you and your wife would have had at least three children by now.” Draco purposely steered away from using Ginny Weasley’s name. For some reason he still couldn’t say it.
Terry shrugged. He didn’t look terribly impressed.
Then a thought struck Harry. “Does Corentin normally work in the British Room?”
Lunch had been unquestionably nice, conversation flowing as easily between them as it had in eighth year and Draco had realised he felt completely comfortable, settled in a way he hadn’t for a while now.
to bring Malfoy something. She’d been held in his dungeons, for fuck’s sake.
The Slytherins obviously weren’t part of that, though: they were massively underrepresented at this wedding, as most of them, like Draco and Astoria, had fled the country, but, unlike Draco and Astoria, had had no wish of returning yet, not even for a wedding, the way they’d been treated after the war still not forgotten.
Harry obviously didn’t know what to make of Draco’s question, either, then just opted for a smile, slightly subdued perhaps, but a smile nonetheless. “I’m Head Auror. I think I should be able to find an address if I wanted to.”
Draco smiled, knowing exactly why Potter was here, because Blaise was that kind of friend. “Then why don’t you?” Draco moved closer still, just shy of actually touching Potter’s ear with his lips, wanting to push him just a little bit further, see how far he could go. “Still don’t care to dance?”
“Well, okay,” Draco said. “I should be able to come over for a short while,” he added, giving himself some leeway, because he wasn’t ready to promise he’d be there all night: he wasn’t going to make a promise he might not be able to keep.
“But I-, I can’t be-?” Draco really couldn’t bring himself to say it.
“Yes, I suppose it is.” Draco couldn’t quite keep his own opinion on his Patronus from lacing his words.
“For what?” Harry asked, although he did have a pretty good idea.
Draco had been on assignments out of the country most of the time: he hadn’t even been able to visit his mother every week, like he’d wanted to. So, besides work, there had been preciously little time left to visit London.
close, but his voice was loud enough, easily ending the talk Harry had been having with Luna. As always Ron’s volume had obviously increased with the amount of alcohol he’d consumed.
Well, and of course Draco’d had to go and hit that particularly lucky jackpot. As if just being a Death Eater hadn’t been enough of a problem, already.
Harry felt a sudden, unexpected chill that went all the way to his core. No Slytherin friends either, then. “But
It probably did.
What was the sodding twat doing? Damn it!
Work on the flat had proceeded quite a lot since Harry had decided to start helping Draco again. The larger pieces of furniture were mostly in place, the walls had obviously been painted, the kitchen had been fitted, of course, and today the bathroom had been redone.
“No, I-, I rather hoped we could, you know, do it again?” Harry’s own voice wasn’t just tinged with hope now, it was positively swimming in it.
Malfoy had most definitely never been Harry’s friend, not in any sense of the word, but something just felt terribly off here.
Harry hadn’t noticed a spell had grazed his hip, until he saw Draco watching it. Something had cut Draco’s arm, causing his right sleeve to hang in loose threads, the blood underneath dry already.
What wasn’t simple, though, was Harry standing at the bottom of the stairs. “Hey, there you are. I already thought I heard you come down.” Harry’s voice was conspicuously lacking the annoyance Draco would have expected to be there and Draco found himself staring at Harry quite unintentionally. He’d been determined to leave fast, whatever happened, but somehow that message hadn’t quite reached his body, so here he was, stuck, watching Harry.
So, that’s why Harry was currently staring at Draco Malfoy, who was standing across the huge ballroom, being completely at ease of course. He was leaning against the bar, elegantly dressed in formal robes that were cut to still tease at his tall, slim physique. His white-blonde hair was longish again and would be reaching to his jawline if it hadn’t been slicked back. It was a hairstyle Harry had never particularly cared for, but Malfoy still managed to look undeniably good.
When the pain caused by the Dittany came again it really
It was true and Ron knew enough of the workings of the Auror Department not to even ask why Harry apparently had to come into work on a Saturday.
Malfoy’s face did something that Harry wasn’t quite able to read, but that on anyone else would have looked suspiciously like hurt, before he checked himself, and answered, slightly loud, as if forcing himself to just say it: “Yes, I did, actually, but that’s nothing for you to worry about.”
started to hurt, like hell, really. “Not much.”
“When Zabini started the club?” Harry ventured.
Harry just looked at him for a while, the anger in his eyes visibly building. Then he exploded: “You think
Draco didn’t quite know what he’d been expecting, but it most certainly wasn’t this.
“You were hit with a Stunner,” Draco stated, still sounding in control.
saved them today.
Playing chess with Potter turned out to be much more fun than Draco had anticipated. The set they used was Muggle unfortunately (Potter told him he got it from Hermione, so Ron could teach him the basics without all the distraction of pieces actually hitting each other), but Potter wasn’t half bad at it and although Draco still won most of the time Potter actually gave him a run for his money a few times. Besides Potter wasn’t a sore loser, laughing at himself whenever he made a stupid mistake.
“Well,” Luna’s voice was both light and thoughtful, “Draco did seem to have bruises most of the time.”
Potter just looked at him, still somewhat shocked and obviously completely unsure of what to do next.
Harry nodded. “Yeah, she has.”
After which he made short work of cutting the tomatoes in annoyingly thin slices by casting just one well-performed spell.
Harry wanted to say something about Malfoy not having been used to doing things himself and bruising easily, what with that incredibly pale skin of his and all, but Harry found he didn’t really believe that himself. So he just didn’t say it, taking a sip of tea instead.
So Draco tried to step back, but Harry just shook his head, very briefly, and pulled him in slightly tighter, saying’: ”It’s okay.” His voice was soft, sounding like he actually meant it. “It’s okay,” Harry repeated, still not letting go.
But Potter didn’t leave it at that. “Why not? You could even decide what you’d like to have for lunch yourself. Now I always get to pick.” Potter smiled again and Draco could only describe it as cocky. Then Potter added, obviously seeing that Draco was actually in doubt: “Come on. It’d be good not to be cooped up here all day. We’ll make it quick, so you won’t lose all that much time.”
Robards ended his letter to Harry.
Zabini just smiled knowingly, before answering. “We’re not that sort of partners. Let’s just say we have an understanding.”
Harry felt himself frown. “So, nothing we need to take into consideration?”
Harry shrugged. He had deactivated it in order for Draco to be able to leave his house, but Draco was right: he hadn’t taken it with them. “That thing is supposed to keep you in. At this point I’m more concerned about keeping others out. Besides, we’re going to sleep in one room anyway. I just got us this one room and to be clear: I’m not leaving you tonight. Those thieves will be looking for you.”
They’d been talking so easily, as if that was completely normal, as if there was no history between them at all.
Blaise was still grinning. “That’s why you like me.” Then he got up. “But as amusing as this conversation is, I will have to leave you and your undoubtedly very impressive dragonfly.” Blaise smiled. “I promised Ginny I’d meet her and some others in Hogsmeade tonight, just for a few drinks before we all go home again tomorrow.”
“Thinking, Potter?” Draco’s voice was so close that Harry could actually feel his breath hot against his ear. Apparently he had sneaked up behind Harry after putting their orders in. “You know your Auror mode is not allowed in here. No thinking tonight.” Harry could hear the smile to Draco’s voice, warm and genuine. He turned towards it without thinking, like a sunflower to the sun, finding Draco’s lips again, his whole world zooming in to just this.
“This is for my sister,” he yelled while throwing something that looked a bit like a black rock straight at Harry.
that Harry easily evaded.
It felt exceedingly awkward sitting here all by himself.
Harry smiled at him again, and it was all soft and sweet. “Okay,” then the humour was back, ”I bet that whole Veela wing thing takes a lot of energy.”
that had Nott’s curse bounce off just in time.
And then it hit Harry that he didn’t know what Blaise had meant, when he’d said Harry had to be patient. Should he wait here, in the hallway in front of Draco’s flat, or was the waiting more like something he should do in the long run, hoping that Draco would come to him at some point, when he was ready?
One ill-considered kiss wasn’t going to change that. He wouldn’t let it. Furthermore he’d made his resolve not to chicken out this time and he’d keep it.
And Potter hadn’t been entirely accurate, either. Draco hadn’t been acquitted so much. He and his mother just hadn’t been imprisoned, mainly because Potter testified on their behalf. The Malfoys
Mathew was about to cast at Draco again and the only thing Draco knew was that that couldn’t happen. It. Just. Couldn’t.
“Blaise thought it was time for me to appear in Britain again and this ball basically was as good an opportunity as any,” Malfoy elaborated.
“We’re going out to dinner,” Astoria just stated next, making Draco feel even worse about himself: Astoria didn’t usually make these sorts of decisions without acknowledging him in the process: he must look absolutely atrocious.
“Yes, bathroom closet, top shelf.” Here Malfoy lifted his arm slightly, just to crack open one eye. “And stop gloating.”
He didn’t.
Silence stretched uncomfortably between the two of them for too long, as Harry was struggling to find the right words to say.
Ah, there was the Malfoy Harry remembered. The Malfoy that would do anything to be in the limelight, the Malfoy that wanted to be seen and admired.
Harry didn’t like his Veela heritage. Harry didn’t like
“So, do you think we could still have this dinner you made? I’d like us to: I haven’t really had anything yet.” Harry’s eyes were so open, so beautiful that Draco couldn’t do anything else than go along with it. Of course he couldn’t.
Somewhere at the back of his mind Harry had apparently feared someone had found them, but now he saw they weren't in any kind of danger. It was just Draco, obviously having a bad dream: his brow creased and his eyes shut tight.
“So, how are you and Malfoy doing?” Harry didn’t like the malicious undertone of Terry’s voice one bit. Well, Harry had decided he really didn’t like the whole of Terry all that much, come to think of it.
he knew, because over the last few weeks Hermione had taken every opportunity to make absolutely sure he understood its significance – and that’s why he’d come in the first place. He’d never actually liked dances in the first place and something like this: a formal banquet with speeches and all, followed by a ball. Well, he would gladly have forgotten all about ever even having received the invitation.
“I wasn’t thinking anything much, really,” Draco answered. Harry cocked his head a little as if he didn’t believe him, but he was smiling all the same. “Just that it was quite a delightful evening,” Draco decided to add.
“Okay, and erm-,” the next question was obviously going to be embarrassing, because the intern started blushing even more vehemently. “Well, what about erm-, sexual desire? It tends to peek the years prior to the transition, especially in males.”
Like the first night Harry had seen him work, it was quite clear that Malfoy knew exactly what he was doing, mixing a drink while pouring another and talking to people easily at the same time, smiling at them as if they were the only people in the world.
“What does it mean?” he asked Corentin, indicating the remaining black lines.
She didn’t seem to think any of it, though. “Yes, I have been asked to escort you there. We will arrange for your luggage to be brought up, too.”
Harry felt the feeling of repulsion that came with those wards wash over him. Then, realising it wasn’t actually
Something like concern seemed to cross Zabini’s face, quick like rippling water, before he answered: “Not really. He did seem a bit distracted when he came in today, but that’s all. Draco’s …” Zabini didn’t finish that sentence, adding: “I think you’ll find that whatever happened, he didn’t have anything to do with it. Oh, and you can talk to him in my office. Draco knows where it is.”
So this was the dragon Weasley.
?” Harry couldn’t quite believe that. “Did you put in a request?”
He also knew Malfoy never would, though, so in the end he didn’t even bother to ask.
Harry nodded, starting to tell Zabini about the rest of yesterday: how he had been brought in and how Draco – Harry had decided he’d keep calling Draco by his first name whatever Zabini might think - had most likely located the Cartel’s headquarters. He ended his story by telling Zabini that Draco had been in late and quite exhausted, most likely having been rather unpleasantly questioned.
Harry had served them both a generous measure of Firewhisky, that Draco took a sip of, just to have something to do. They were on Harry’s sofa, Draco sitting next to Harry, whose gaze seemed to be transfixed on him, watching him swallow.
Draco only managed a half-smile in return.
“Would you like to use the Floo? You know, to go home?” Potter asked, almost as if he’d known what Draco had been thinking. Draco winced, the hurt of those words almost comparable to that stupid curse for a moment. Of course Potter still wanted him to leave. It was Potter’s house and he wasn’t even supposed to be there.
So Draco talked to them, Hermione and Neville, not looking at anyone else. When a burst of laughter came from the other end of the table, Draco had to look though. Harry and the others on that side of the table were obviously having fun: Harry laughing uproariously, apparently at something Wood had just said and for some reason Wood took that opportunity to move his arm to hang loosely over Harry’s shoulders. And stay there.
“And I’m glad you’re happy,” he squeezed out next. He meant it and Astoria knew. He’d been around her long enough to be able to tell that she knew.
Malfoy watched him as if it took him some time to process. Then he smiled languidly and kicked the door to the suite closed behind him, steadying himself on the wall at the same time. “I really don’t care where you sleep, Potter.”
Potter seemed to realise that too and the look he gave Draco was startlingly soft, but he didn’t say anything, just held his gaze.
like it’s got any caffeine in it. It’s more like the water that’s left when you wash up the coffeepot.” Malfoy sounded every bit the condescending twat Harry had always taken him for, but there was an amused glint to his eyes and he was actually smiling, taking the edge off.
“Here you are. Your schedule,” Agatha said briskly and Harry knew exactly what would be on the parchment she’d put on his desk. He’d actually asked for it himself.
Hermione shrugged: “The first gift to my Foundation was accompanied by a letter of apology that I accepted. I think he actually wants to make amends.” Well, he certainly hadn’t made amends with him, Harry thought rather resentfully.
Potter rose to the challenge all the same.
This didn’t really ease Harry’s confusion, so Malfoy added: “They’re just the usual things, you know. It’s why I moved to the Continent in the first place.”
Fortunately that was when Harry’s Floo came to life, revealing Luna’s head.
Only when the sickening sensation of apparition had stopped and he was in his own flat again, did Draco give himself permission to let them come. For the first time since he’d come back to Britain, since Astoria had found happiness with someone else, since he’d seen Harry again and had known it would end.
And Harry watched. There was an elegance to Zabini’s movements that was almost enticing and seeing him slowly undo all the layers of spell work was really quite alluring. Harry was reminded of the reason he had ended up with Zabini, that one evening, in the first place. He knew it was this kind of grace that he was attracted to.
“Thank you,” Draco managed politely, indicating the water. He was leaning back into the wall behind him, tipping his head back to take a sip, acutely regretting it wasn’t whiskey, preferably a whole bottle.
And he decided to ignore the glint he thought he saw in Potter’s eyes at that: they most certainly didn’t allude to the club at work.
Malfoy shrugged, keeping his gaze down, but Harry thought he could have been looking amused.
It was later that Sunday afternoon, still in the library, that Harry saw the object for the first time. It was a cube shaped box, made out of what looked like expensive, black wood. It wasn’t all too big, perhaps four inches on each side, but it undoubtedly had a magical signature and a very powerful one at that.
They had won.
When Harry had finished briefing Zabini, he pushed Draco gingerly: “Draco.” and Draco’s eyes snapped open again. “Can you stand? We can’t Apparate here.” He heard the panic lacing his words.
And Harry was just so utterly fucked.
The prospect had made Harry quite happy. He knew he would be good at teaching, knew how he’d liked it back at Hogwarts and he was really glad to have a chance at doing it again after having been an Auror for so many years.
“Looking for the gorgeous blond?” the bartender asked, when Harry had put in his order for his usual pint.
As if on cue the atrium started to disappear and Harry felt himself quiet down. A few shaky breaths later he was able to open his eyes, turning a little to find Malfoy hovering over him, a soft orb of light hanging suspended in the air beside him.
Blaise cocked his head. “I don’t recall specifying the ‘you’. It could have been either of you really, but something must have happened. Tell me.” His voice was both demanding and oddly sympathetic somehow.
“Do you know who actually worked with their curse breakers to get your Wards to yield?” Ron sounded so indignant that Harry suddenly doubted he had noticed their state of undress at all.
The office that they were lead to now was situated at the very end of a long hallway, as far from the Minister’s offices as one could get. It was small, just large enough to hold two desks shoved together and two chairs.
So, even though Harry hardly felt like sitting on the floor again, he sat himself down next to Draco, just enough distance between them not to crowd each other.
Harry was slightly surprised at himself. Why had his thoughts wandered off to Malfoy of all people? But when he looked at the schedule in front of him, he knew. Malfoy was the first person on there: next week Tuesday.
Who had owled him to come and try a new range of products for the shop. And who had subsequently showed up on Harry’s doorstep when Harry hadn’t come around to answering him straight away, taking Harry to the shop himself without preamble.
And the thing was: he did know. He knew exactly what it felt like to want what Astoria meant: someone who really cared, who thought you were the only person that mattered, someone to love, someone to give yourself to completely, someone who would not shy away if you did … .
So Harry just proceeded to look for the things he needed in his Auror robes as both were standard issue. It didn’t take him long to find them.
Draco frowned, thinking. “I think the statuettes are actually projecting wards of some kind, although not the ones we’d normally use. These seem to be darker.”
He just hoped he would still be able to get out of Harry’s house before Harry’d wake up.
He’d been mistaken.
“You didn’t bring the cube. You know, the one that is supposed to keep me in,” Draco mentioned once they were done eating. He sounded slightly astonished, as if he’d just realised it wasn’t there and it surprised him.
Draco was still watching him. “Not really,” he eventually just said, not quite looking at Harry. It sounded clipped and distant. “But
Really, how stupid could he be?
“No, not like th-. Draco, you’re hurt! There are lacerations and-, and they’re bleeding. How didn’t anyone notice-?”
scarred.” That made Harry look up at him again, making Draco’s silvery gaze shift away instead. “It would have been justice. A reminder,” Draco attempted to explain.
“It’s almost ready,” Harry now broke into Draco’s thoughts, “Plates are in that cupboard over there, glasses over here and the cutlery’s in that drawer.”
“Why didn’t you tell me?”
Harry took a steadying breath, completely at a loss for a moment.
“I’m always stunning,” Draco paused just for effect, “Potter.”
feel a lot better and more importantly he just hadn’t been able to think of another way of changing the subject.
“Let me guess: you didn’t even finish all the books on Quidditch?” Draco teased.
“Harry, I’m glad you’ve agreed to do this,” Robards said, sounding decidedly pleased, “but only one small matter remains to be discussed.”
Zabini eyed him levelly, then cast a quick disillusionment charm over the three of them.
His touch was light, gentle and the air around them felt charged all of a sudden, going thick and almost stifling in a heartbeat. “It’s a pity I don’t really remember seeing them. It must have been quite the sight.” Harry’s voice was as thick as the air around them, filled with something that Draco’s whole body responded to without thinking.
Harry watched Draco get up, too incredulous to say or do anything at first. Then he just managed:  “Draco, you heard what Corentin said. You should sleep.”
“Is it okay if I-?” Harry asked, indicating the phial. He didn’t finish his sentence, but Draco nodded anyway, not even saying anything when Harry once more started unbuttoning Draco’s shirt. The wound had obviously been bleeding again, but Draco was right. It had dried and there was no fresh blood.
And Harry found it drove him up the wall. It was even more infuriating than Malfoy’s arrogance, which was damn well saying something.
“So you don’t know who’s been teaching Curse-Breaking for the past seven months?” Blaise was not just wearing a smirk anymore: it had now transformed into a decidedly
Thoughts of how Draco was going to be entirely gone from Harry’s life later today. And of how much Harry resented that.
Harry all but cut her off. “No, I’d like to take my own luggage up, if that’s alright.” He’d never liked being waited upon like that: for some reason it made him feel uncomfortable.
“Kreacher has made us breakfast. Do you think you’re up to it? Or is your stomach still giving you trouble, after last night?” There was a slightly mischievous tone to Harry’s voice now. So, Harry had obviously decided to address this whole thing with humour. It was something Draco felt strangely grateful for: humour was infinitely better than contempt or anything else Harry could have reverted to under the circumstances.
guide him and not chicken out like last Saturday.
straight after it. It hit and her wand flew into Harry’s hand, being replaced by a second wand in the witness’ hand almost immediately. What the actual fuck-?
“I was about to ask Luna to come over, because I think she’s off work and I wanted to talk to her about something, but it can wait,” Harry now said. Especially the last part actually took Draco by surprise and he felt a jolt of happiness that was completely foolish and uncalled for. “You’re not drunk this time, are you?” Harry proceeded to ask, however.
There was none.
There had been a time Draco would probably have done so without thinking twice.
“Oh yes, thank you Professor,” Anthony Harris’ face lit up: he was extremely clever, definitely the Granger of this particular group, and it made perfect sense he would be interested in a book like that. “But I thought you said I would be getting it in Defence class next week.”
Harry liked the way Draco looked. Which made him remember again: tomorrow Draco would be gone, out of this room, out of Harry’s house, out of his life completely.
“You’re looking for Curse-Breaker Malfoy?” Draco’s colleague Penelope Lassiter asked. She was a prim looking witch with unexpectedly friendly eyes that Harry had consulted on more than one occasion. He nodded.
“Mr Malfoy actually was obliviated,” Harry told him, just a slight bit of victory hiding in his voice. “The Healer at St Mungo’s was absolutely clear on that. I even have a written statement.” He waved the piece of parchment at Terry, slightly more of the victory creeping in.
Draco only managed a warm smile against Harry’s lips, before they were kissing again, soft but insistent, breakfast all but forgotten.
This Chapter was written to:
Perhaps Hermione was right. Perhaps Malfoy
“Harry,” it wasn’t Ron’s voice, but it was soothing somehow. “Harry.” The voice was very, very close and Harry felt a hand gently shaking his shoulders. “You’re dreaming.”
Harry pulled his gaze away and eyed the crowd, looking for Ginny, because even though they had broken things off ages ago, she still accompanied him to these sorts of official gatherings. It was something she was rather good at, seemingly always knowing what to say to whom at the right moment.
Harry had been right about wanting to teach when he’d agreed to take on this job. Yesterday afternoon he’d taught his first class – the group of first years - and he had taken to it like a fish to water.
Except for Sundays
It was much later in the night that Harry found himself talking to Blaise again. Just for a short while.
“Oh, no need to worry, Draco. The powder is quite harmless in itself. Its effects will wear off within half an hour,” Nott added, after having studied Draco’s face for a moment. “And I have to admit that even though Potter wasn’t meant to snog
Draco poured Zabini his tea, obviously knowing exactly how he took it and Harry felt something stir inside of him that he wasn’t particularly proud of.
“Well, I wouldn’t be too sure. This certainly doesn’t
Harry really, really wanted to kiss Draco again and he almost made a move to do so, but Draco saw and shook his head ever so slightly.
Before Draco knew it they’d started eating in an easy, comfortable silence and it was all so homey, it made Draco ache.
Draco got up off the bed, feeling slightly guilty for Harry being there. Draco was perfectly fine, could easily have gotten home on his own, but it was nice to have Harry here all the same.
very attractive like this: relaxed, strands of his blond hair falling into his face, lighting up almost like silver in this light.
This week had flown by. There were so many things Harry needed to acquaint himself with, so many things to do and decide, that all of a sudden Harry found it was Friday again. And just like last week, after Harry’d had lunch, Malfoy sauntered in, this time only nodding in his direction, not saying or doing anything else.
Draco sighed. “Of course I did, Potter.”
“Yes, it is,” There was a warmth to Malfoy’s voice that reminded Harry of the low purr that Malfoy used at the club sometimes and it sent a small tingle through Harry’s spine that he definitely hadn’t asked for.
Harry woke to the grey of Draco’s eyes, his arm firmly over Draco’s waist now and their legs all tangled up together. It was much more enjoyable than it had any right to be.
“I-. It’s my mother’s birthday today.” Harry could have known, of course - Malfoy had told him when he’d bought her a book a few days ago – but he hadn’t actually realised it was today.
Now Malfoy turned, setting a plate of food down on the table and like much earlier that morning Harry noticed he looked tired. And rather skinny, thin, in his pyjamas that were obviously too wide for him.
always do.”
Perhaps he actually
“You had this made?” Harry asked, his voice so thick with emotion it actually sounded like he had difficulty saying anything at all. Draco just couldn’t make out whether he was extremely happy or tremendously angry.
“But he had all of you, the Slytherins,” Harry observed. He still remembered how Draco had always seemed to be surrounded by people, at least at Hogwarts he had been.
Blaise just looked at him in surprise for a moment, obviously not quite sure what to make of this, whether Draco was being serious. Well, Draco was. Dead serious. And Blaise realised soon enough, cracking up with laughter. Draco had never seen him laugh uncontrollably before, but this seemingly was what had done it. "Apparently
“Lines?” Janet seemed genuinely baffled for a moment. Then she laughed. “Oh no, I didn’t have to do anything of the sort. I just-, well, we had to undo a curse on one of those cube things that we use in training and I made a right mess of it. Professor Malfoy got me out of trouble, though, and then he practiced with me throughout the break, until I actually got it right,” she was positively beaming. “I can take down that curse now.”
“We could use my phone.” Draco sounded slightly reluctant, almost shy.
, now Draco seemed at his lowest, Harry actually saw him. It hurt Draco more than it had any right to, not after all this time.
Draco’s voice contradicted his words a little, though, and Harry watched him for a beat before getting the other vial to treat his healing wound with Dittany: the cut a long, red mark now.
So it was only completely logical he found himself on that same road now, of course, because, well, he was like that. At least when it came to Potter he was, apparently.
Earlier that week there had been conferences on the place of wizarding society in the modern world: they had been discussing how different wizarding societies worked with Muggles (or how they didn’t) and how the wizarding world would be able to cooperate more, but also and especially they’d been talking about what it meant to be a witch or wizard in these times and if or how they should relate to modern technology.
And this morning he had been absolutely fucking sure he would make an absolute arse of himself. He had shown up here, anyway, though, because it was important that everyone would see, that everyone would know, that they knew who Draco was to Harry, that they knew Draco was his boyfriend. And if he made an arse of himself while doing so, well, so be it. Harry could handle that.
The table had apparently been available indeed, because Abbott had taken them there. It was rather inconspicuous, tucked into a nook completely at the shadowy back of the establishment. “I prefer to sit here if possible,” Harry explained. “I don’t really fancy being gawked at.” He grinned. “I hope you don’t mind?”
“Yeah, if you’d like to go,” Harry smiled, already knowing Malfoy’s answer. “Anything I should or shouldn’t wear?” Harry made it sound like a joke of sorts, but he also vividly remembered the whole clothing thing in the club they’d been to yesterday.
“Come, let’s dance.” Ginny’s voice startled Harry out of his gaze. She was leaning over his shoulder from behind and talking in Harry’s ear to make sure he’d hear her over the music. He gave her a short nod and made his way out of the booth. Harry wasn’t great at dancing, but a club was hardly the Yule Ball, now was it? Here you just had to be able to sort of shift your weight from one leg to the other and
Now Harry looked his way, Draco registered.
Draco closed his eyes for a moment. “Of course I do. Everybody likes you, Potter.”
Draco nodded, just once.
There would have been a time when Draco would have feared that, but now he didn’t, not at all: he welcomed it, welcomed the moment that Harry’s magic washed over him, almost as familiar as his own.
They were going through.
Harry found he couldn’t even be offended.
Ron looked confused, just for a moment, which was when Harry realised he’d called Draco by his first name, but eventually Ron just nodded. “Yeah, that too.”
Harry passed him a sidelong glance. And found Draco watching, confusion in his eyes and incredulity and something else, something so vulnerable that Harry just wanted to draw him in closer, not letting him go. Not ever letting him go.
It was more than Draco could say for himself. He was still awful at losing, but Harry didn’t even seem to mind that very much.
“Yeah, I am,” Potter answered plainly. “We’re off for summer now, though.”
“Well,” Draco pondered, “I think I might actually be off at a reasonable time for once.”
And suddenly there Harry was, with his warmth and his scent and …, and his everything. And Draco didn’t have the strength to push him away, like he should. The cold he had felt was gone immediately and Draco just melted into Harry’s embrace, leaning his head against the side of Harry’s.
“I thought you could probably use this,” Potter said, his tone suspiciously like concern, while handing Draco a glass of water a little while later.
Then Draco’s alarm went off, so softly that it made Harry shift a bit, but didn't wake him up. It
Harry fortunately seemed to have similar thoughts.
“Yes,” Harry answered, walking towards Draco, “but I’m off tomorrow and I’d like you to-. You know, if you want to.”
Potter startled out of his conversation. “Malfoy. You’re here.” His voice sounded slightly surprised, but that strangely wasn’t all.
Harry to touch them. To accept them.
“I stuck around for almost two weeks, camping in the woods nearby, but I didn’t find a way in. I did see you go in and out, though,” he told Zabini who looked over at Harry briefly and Harry, like Zabini by the looks of it, realised this could mean Zabini had actually been working in, or close to, the Cartel’s headquarters all along.
Potter obviously understood and smiled, genuine and almost warm. “Well, I haven’t read all the books in there yet, if that’s what you mean.”
This time Harry found he had difficulty watching the spells, though: they were coming back in angry black and red lines over Draco’s unmoving body. It couldn’t mean anything good.
Draco didn’t assume that had been a coincidence.
Was it that obvious?
anyone was saying.
Draco had been faster, though, having Nott bound and gagged again quite effectively. Harry shot a furtive glance in Draco’s direction to ensure that his cushioning charm was actually doing its job, then turned his attention back to the incoming guards. He really wanted to make bloody well damn sure no one was casting anything at Draco now.
Harry gazed at him for a moment. “Yeah, quite sure actually. What is this-?”
The students apparently thought so too, because they were watching Malfoy with rapt attention, much like Harry who had to make an effort to tear his eyes away, thinking it would probably be best to leave again before anyone would notice him.
There really was no reason not to, because since they’d shared that first night together, being apart didn’t cause them any discomfort anymore.
And perhaps that was good, Draco debated, perhaps it meant they could have the slightly tentative friendship that they’d had just a few weeks ago. Perhaps it meant Harry wasn’t angry at him anymore, or at least not enough to shut him out entirely.
Then silence. The guards, both out now, eyed him constantly, while Harry switched between eyeing them right back and taking in the vast grounds beyond the fence where nothing seemed to move.
“I don’t know about you, but I’ve had a hell of a week and I’m going to have a glass of whiskey,” Harry stated, when Draco had magically washed up their things after their curry dinner, joining Harry on his sofa. “Do you think my Healer would agree?”
“I know,” Harry said, lightly kissing Draco’s neck now, “So it makes perfect sense to take a shower together. Saves us time.”
The burn started to recede almost immediately, his vision unfocussed and fuzzy at the same time. “I-, I-.” Draco heard himself mutter indistinctly before his eyes fluttered shut and he drifted off to sleep once more.
“Well, now we’re
It would almost have been funny, if it wasn’t so painful.
Draco wanted to quip that he was indeed in and would very much like to keep it that way, but he didn’t. It was Harry on his doorstep, after all.
Draco inwardly smiled - thinking, no,
Draco just nodded his gratitude, happy not to have to explain anything.
Harry didn’t take the dare and smiled. “I’ll have a better look at your bathroom later, you know, when you’re not in it and for now I’ll just cook us something and leave you to it.” He decidedly didn’t look down at Draco’s body anymore.
Draco regained control quickly, arching his eyebrows at Harry who was momentarily and quite satisfyingly, silent for a beat, just eyeing Draco’s naked torso, then down and up again, before he apparently found he could form words. “I couldn’t find you, so I thought you’d be in your new bathroom.”
Harry just nodded, feeling helpless too. “Why didn’t you write to me?” Harry eventually asked. “You must have guessed it could still be at Grimmauld Place?”
“Of course you were.” Malfoy didn’t quip, but merely stated, quiet and completely serious. “Annoying, aren’t they.” There was a hint of humour there, but it wasn’t at Harry’s expense, more of an attempt to lighten the mood a little.
Potter made remarkably quick work of it, gazing back at Draco again when he had finished, his eyes lingering on where Draco’s shirt was still open.
So instead of getting up, he crawled under his blankets and hoped that if he closed his eyes again, the dream would return.
dance with him, though? You know, since you brought him here.” It sounded rather base even to his own ears.
The man at the fence yesterday.
“I really do hope our assignments will get better over time,” Harry complained, when the Ministry Wards around the premises had been put up and they were finally leaving the scene for the day. “Now I just seem to be guarding a house that no one actually wants to enter to begin with.”
It most definitely was time for him to go to bed.
Malfoy smiled right back. It was a slightly hesitant thing, though, and Harry couldn’t help but notice how soft he looked again: his hair all tousled and falling in his face in places he would never have allowed it to throughout the day.
They’d had lunch and moved to the sofa in one of Harry’s drawing rooms, where they’d started going over everything that had happened at the house. Then, for some reason, the topic had miraculously changed to Draco’s Patronus, which had led to Draco truthfully telling Harry he still really resented the form it had taken.
“No, we didn’t.”
that left her completely unable to do anything else. Next he levitated her out.
something.”
Not good. Not good at all.
“Yes, well, that’s what being gay generally means, especially in combination with the maypole bit really.” It was the sort of condescending reply that probably would have pissed Harry off, even a short while ago. But now Harry just laughed.
And she was a marvel to work with too: clever enough, but also having an acute sense of human decency, something Terry quite obviously lacked.
“I’m sorry,” Harry apologised, when he saw. “I didn’t know you had company.”
This time it took at least a full five minutes for the pain to fade to a manageable level again, but it didn’t completely subside anymore.
Draco just shrugged. “That’s just the way it works.” He tried to make it sound matter-of-factly, sort of succeeding this time.
Harry noticed some of his standard Auror Wards had been broken now, though, but luckily he had also cast less common ones on his house, including some of the more recently developed Wards that not all of them used, or even knew about, yet.
“Did you tell anyone?” Harry felt his full Auror mode kick in now.
Draco just nodded: he could easily understand how that would require his attention, so he made his way to room three without complaint.
Malfoy seemed to know exactly how his Muggle phone worked and he explained elaborately. Harry knew he wouldn’t remember half of it, but it was nice all the same. While he was explaining Malfoy’s eyes lit up, pure liquid silver, and his enthusiasm, especially for something so completely Muggle, held a surprising attraction all its own.
It was the sound that meant he was supposed to leave, because that was how this sort of thing worked: you got what you wanted, what you needed – and it was astounding how much Draco had actually wanted and needed this, even though they hadn’t even actually done that much – and then you left. It was how it had always worked for Draco, no strings attached, and Draco was quite sure that Potter wouldn’t want this to be any other way either.
Now the division was made up out of teams of two, just like was normal in the Auror force, but in this division one member of each team was an Auror and the other a Curse-Breaker.
At that particular moment Draco couldn’t bring himself to care though, because Potter was kissing
“Oh, and they don’t speak English very well, so I’ve taken the liberty of asking the only one of our colleagues who speaks French to join you. He’ll translate,” he heard Agatha say to Potter when he rounded the corner on Monday morning.
“You could just go there and talk to him.” It was unmistakably Luna’s light voice, although Draco hadn’t noticed her approaching.
It had taken two owls – why couldn’t Slytherins just answer fucking owls? – and some convincing on Blaise’s doorstep, but now Harry was in Blaise’s living room, apparently having intruded on a dinner for two, if the dinner table was any indication.
But she probably still wasn’t employed anywhere.
. The Healer didn’t say it however. Instead she just said: “On
“Draco what exactly?” Draco was just standing there, eyeing them suspiciously, almost angrily, his jaw clenched and his grey eyes very nearly shooting daggers at them. Zabini, completely unfazed, stepped back from tying the bracelet around Harry’s wrist. He had obviously worked with Draco before.
When they finally let go, coming up for air, Malfoy’s breathing had sped up considerably. Which in turn was completely enticing: knowing that Harry had the power to do that to someone as in control as Malfoy usually was. Harry wanted to do it again, possibly multiple times.
“I’ll make us a sandwich.” Draco said, as soon as they’d exited his Floo. Harry had wanted to get lunch, so apparently he could use something to eat and to Draco it seemed important that he didn’t go hungry.
He fell asleep almost immediately.
“Do you have somewhere to be tonight? You know, should I dress up?” Harry tried to sound casual, playful even, but he probably didn’t get it right, because Malfoy shot him a slightly confused look. “I only meant, do you need a bodyguard tonight?”
His engagement to Ginny Weasley.
Working with Lisa Turpin had been as much of a pleasure as the day before and although Harry still very much looked forward to being with Ron again on Monday, working with Lisa was remarkably easy too.
Still, it had left Harry feeling slightly off. It had been his first night with a bloke and although their interactions hadn’t gone much beyond them kissing and a ridiculously brilliant handjob, he felt somewhat insecure about all of it. For some reason he found himself hoping that it had been good for Malfoy too.
that made his target freeze in place straight away, while Harry cast an industrial strength
“No, he didn’t. But he did leave again shortly after,” Draco answered. “I don’t think he’ll be coming back anytime soon.”
So Malfoy flicked his wand in an elegant succession of movements, muttering a spell under his breath.
Zabini shook his head. “Not much, really, no, although I
Harry’s first reaction was to ignore it, to pull the duvet over his head and to see about this whole thing tomorrow, but it was probably better to let Malfoy know he had arrived.
“So that’s why he wakes up when you call his name: to make sure that whoever is doing the torturing will be able to ask questions?” Harry felt anger boiling under his skin, almost spilling. It was a good thing that the sodding piece of shit that had cast this damn curse wasn’t here now.
“Yeah, exactly. And you definitely still need to recover, which would be completely impossible in your own flat, all alone.” It was probably not meant to be taken too seriously, but Draco registered how absolutely sincere Harry’s voice had gone. And it made something warm nestle in Draco's chest. Something that was there more often than not when he was with Harry.
“So, some of these bruises were in places where you could actually see them?” Harry heard the Auror in him ask next.
It felt utterly satisfying.
So that’s what Malfoy did, whizzing a tablecloth, plates and everything else onto the table with a few graceful flicks of his wand. And it wasn’t like Harry didn’t know it could be done like this, because he did. It was just that he himself didn’t usually use magic for this sort of thing.
Getting smaller.
When he finally left the cubicle to get himself a towel from the heated towel rack, he felt completely relaxed, drying himself off slowly, feeling warm and rather sluggish: his exhaustion from not having slept for quite a while finally catching up with him.
Harry shouldn’t have worried, though, Draco’s eyes were warm and completely fond.
Harry looked at him incredulously. “Oliver? Really? You don’t mean-? Draco, he’s a good friend, but nothing more, nothing more at all,” Harry said with emphasis. “Never has been, never will be. Is that what this whole thing is about?”
“Fair enough,” Draco conceded with a smile that was probably too warm. It was nice to be talking to Harry again.
Draco nodded. “So, you had problems with this in training sessions, I presume?” His voice could easily have been defiant and previously it probably would have been, but now it wasn’t. Draco
not with Potter watching.
Of course Harry didn’t agree.
Draco’s lunch break on Wednesday had been utterly boring: he’d known he liked having lunch with Harry, he just hadn’t realised how much.
By the looks of it, this particular house was not going to pose much of a problem, though. It had been taken months prior, which probably meant no one was actually hiding in it anymore and although there were bound to be some dark objects in a house like that, there was no evidence to indicate anything really menacing.
“I’m sorry,” Harry said and he really, really meant it, feeling he wanted to comfort Draco, but also quite sure he wouldn’t be permitted to. “So you erm-, you don’t really like me very much just now?” Harry asked, feeling guilty - because of the letter he’d stupidly missed – and quite at a loss as to what to do next, where this was going.
Of course Harry had known these kinds of intricate wards – because whatever Zabini had said they seemed rather complex: Harry had recognised a few basic wards, but they seemed to be used in a different way altogether - had layers that needed to be taken apart, but he hadn’t been prepared for how beautiful that looked. With an almost lazy flick of his wand and a muttered spell Zabini had revealed the complicated layers the wards were noticeably comprised of.
As he had known he would from the start, really: it was much too exciting and new to pass up on.
Okay, granted, that would most likely have been, because no one else would have wanted to work with Draco: a former Death Eater, but it was what had persuaded Draco more than anything. He had been embarrassingly happy to know his partner on the Division would be Harry.
Harry considered him for a moment and Draco feared Harry had seen right through him. That didn’t seem to be the case after all, though, because Harry only said: “You know you don’t need painters to do the painting. You just need to know the right spells.” There was amusement in his eyes.
After Harry had called Hermione, he and Draco had had dinner brought up to their room.
He found himself watching now, though. Slightly surprised. Ron and Hermione were dancing. He hadn’t seen very much of them all evening, but now they were there, dancing and they did a good job of it, too. Ron had obviously learned.
“I’m fine.” Draco sounded more in control than he actually looked: his hair a very uncharacteristic mess and his clothes rumpled.
“Well, that’s a good opportunity,” he said, his words laced with a genuine warmth that she obviously picked up on, shooting him a grateful smile.
Malfoy didn’t say anything for a beat, just going slightly pink. “You’re welcome.”
“Draco? Anything wrong?” Harry watched him with concern. “You looked like you were miles away.”
Harry couldn’t do anything but stare for a moment. Okay, so Harry knew that the Ministry had taken everything the Malfoys had ever owned, so he did understand some of the reason why Malfoy wouldn’t be able to pay extra for food, although he didn’t think a bartender actually made that little money. But it was something else that was nagging him: Malfoy actually took the family he was living with into consideration: he didn’t eat with them, because he thought they didn’t have enough to spare, even though Nurie would probably allow him to eat for free.
