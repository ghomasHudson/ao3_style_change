"Oh, come on! Can't you see that you absolutely gorgeous," Ginny huffed. "I didn't even have to change much. But your hair! Well, it is not as messy as usual, and I am not going to give you extensions to wear." She thought for a moment with her hand brushing her chin before digging in a drawer. "Ah, ha!" She held out a black ribbon, which she quickly changed the color to match the dress, and tied it into a bow. She clasped a clip through it and fastened it to Harmony's short hair a little above her ear and towards her face. "Now go out there and make me proud."
"But still we are wizards, not barbaric muggles. We need to develop our magic," Theodore Nott retorted.
The sky was a sheet of white and brightened the entire area. When Harmony stepped outside, she pulled her scarf close to her neck and trekked through the cleared path. She got to the Gryffindor section and spotted Ginny with Luna.
Harmony soon realized that the best way to alleviate her cramps was to eat a little of just about everything. Her plate piled with much missed foods.
"You're too old for her, old man!" George complained. Charlie crossed his muscular arms and smirked at his brothers.
"I would too," Harmony tried to smile, "I'm so sorry. You were right, we shouldn't have gone...It's my fault." His eyes caught hers.
"The hell?" Harmony muttered. The stuffed statue started growling. It rose on its hind legs, looming over their heads. To Harmony's dismay, the bear wasn't as stuffed as she had hoped. Luna grabbed Harmony's hand. Ginny immediately turned to face the brown bear and gave a surprised yelp.
"Don't hurt her," Draco almost pleaded, "she is nobody." Sirius Black's face was fresh in his mind, and he knew what his father was capable of.
"Uh, I dunno, we found him like that." Snape should know better than to ask Crabbe a question that required the use of a brain. Harry saw that Malfoy began to calm as the potion coursed though his system.
Draco Malfoy clenched his fists tight enough for his short trimmed nails to dig into the fleshy part of his palm. He stared angrily at the top of the ceiling to his bed, at lines that crosshatched from the abuse of many spells. The morning sun had come up by now, but there were no windows to see it. He put a fist to his head and pushed down hard enough for the bed to groan in distaste. "It's all wrong," he said aloud, not having to be quiet since he never had to share a room with anyone. He hadn't been following the plan; the plan for him to best Potter. Draco had been sure that it would be easy and simple. He had played the charmer, hid his disgust, crafted his face to be the image of absolute desire, and the most he got in response was marginal trust and reluctant acceptance. Sure there were some instances where it looked like Potter and him were making progress, as if she would be interested in something more. But Draco wasn't sure anymore if he wanted to continue. And he had no idea why.
Hermione gasped and checked the time before grabbing Ron's hand and saying a quick goodbye and that she would return later. Harry couldn't help but laugh at Ron's happy face at holding hands with her. He did feel better that they came, and hoped that Dumbledore would return. Madame Pomfrey came back into the room when she saw that the visitors had left.
"Teachers don't usually allow that till you actually have another class in mind, she'd probably send you back to Divinations; plus she has a class right now with the third years. How about I show you the classes at this time, since Divinations is basically an elective it doesn't matter if you get into a class filled with other grades."
"First," Draco held her hand as they walked, "if you agree to go out with me." If she hadn't been holding his hand, she may have stumbled over her high heels. His steel gray eyes filled with determination and Harmony smiled up at him.
Harmony got bored watching the game, and trailed her eyes on Draco. She needed to fly with him again, and maybe snag a snitch so that they could compete. It was much more fun than actually playing quidditch. They could practice getting better without their teams, and fly without hands, or ride it with only their feet like a surfboard. Harmony snapped out of her thoughts and realized that wasn't what she was supposed to do. She shook her head and knew that doing those things with him would make her like him more. Harmony couldn't afford that. She couldn't lead him on like that either.
But she didn't listen. She stepped forward to the Dark Lord, right in front of him, not even flinching or looking away as he turned his wand once more into a knife. Draco didn't see the knife as it stabbed her, but he saw the blood pool at her feet within moments. She hunched forward as the life went out of her and she slid sideways to the ground with a final thud. And this time Draco screamed out, silently in his own mind, as if he were choking.
Ron whimpered, but kept his eyes on the Professor. "This is the third detention this week, and each time Harry has done nothing. Last time you gave him a detention for dropping his quill."
"Not try, Harmony," Draco replied, "we will be good friends." She didn't respond to him, instead she brought the now bitter tea to her lips.
"So you just happened to be walking down this hallway, a complete coincidence that we meet, right." She was beginning to wonder if he had some creepy sensing radar.
"Well, Mary Poppins is a famous witch who breached wizardry laws and performed magic within the sight of muggles to teach children to behave or some nonsense like that. Well, she had invented the flying umbrella, and it has been banned since." Even though McGonagall was pulling the lecture mode, Harmony felt amused. "Everyone knows the story of how she was struck by lightning, but the muggles seem to have over looked that fact."
"Being here near you is better than anything else I could imagine." Sirius sat at the mouth of the cave, and made a fire at his feet. It gave off no smoke.
"Nah," Draco stretched his arms over his head, "I'd rather just hang with you. And Snape would never let you be held back, he wants you out as soon as possible, so you'll probably be expelled first. So why are we skipping classes?" he asked, "is it because of the Slytherins are giving you hell?" Harmony shrugged her shoulders.
"We should go," Ginny muttered to Hermione and Ron. It looked like Ron had a lot that he wanted to say and do to Malfoy, and it did not matter that the faking liar was apologizing. But the way his sister latched to his arm stopped him. "For Harry."
As he walked through the halls, it didn't hinder his mood that he couldn't actually see her whenever he wanted. Draco had the letter addressed to his father and he chose a random school owl, figuring that his eagle owl may be intercepted. He gave the owl a treat before sending it off, and Draco hoped that his parents would respond. He hadn't heard from them since Christmas either. Anger had stopped him from sending them anything since then.
"Let's take turns," Luna said, "till we figure out how to destroy it." There was a ghost of a smile on Harmony's lips.
"You know, there are only two answers to that. Either Draco Malfoy isn't as bad as you think he is, or I'm not the good person you think I am." Harmony stated impassively. "So which is it?"
"Yeah, then you'll be all alone in 6th year." Draco brushed the hair from his eyes, and smiled from the corner of his lips.
"Well, it depends if I'm hungry or not. If I am, then I imagine the finest honey dukes candies. If I am not, then I imagine a happier world. Any way, does any one want to share their happiest thought?" A lone hand greeted Leighton after a few moments.
"I feel better," she said. She double checked that the cloak was covering both of them completely before walking away. They had to stop whenever someone got near, so it took them awhile to make real progress.
"Wait, would you ever want to go to Romania with me?" Charlie asked. Seeing her confused look, he added, "Er, I mean to study dragons more." He hoped that his ears weren't turning red, despite the laughter that Fred had disguised as a coughing fit.
"Come take a walk with me, and I'll tell you." Blaise said, steering away from the potions class, not looking back to see whether she was coming. He strolled into the nearest unused classroom, and Ginny followed, watching him as he sat at the front desk.
"Of course not dear, it is a flying rug. Carpets have too much surface area." Harmony decided not to question any further. "Do you want to say goodbye to them?" she said waving a hand where the screams had subsided. Harmony could see the fear in each of their faces as if waving objects spelled out decapitation or defecation, each being seemingly worse than the other. She gave a tight smile and a small wave as she then progressed to move her luggage onto the rug.
"Bliase Zambini, are you asking to be hexed?" Blaise walked with him through the doors, and Draco narrowed his eyes as the other teen pointed at his mouth which was currently filed with toast.
Harmony stood by Professor Snape's desk, the rest of the students had left. "You wanted to see me." She called to him. He appeared through the door, the very image of taught misery.
"Sorry, Sir," Harmony said. She kicked Draco's shoe when he didn't say anything. "Don't argue with him," she whispered from the side of her mouth, "I'll tell you later." Draco shut his mouth and returned to the cauldron. They completed the rest of the assignment, when they finished the potion and handed in a flask of the sorcerer's revenge. Snape took one look at it and nodded his head.
"Good," Blaise said, "you won us the game." Draco shrugged his shoulders, like it didn't matter. "You are different," Blaise commented, " I didn't take you for such a romantic."
The still clad girl, Harmony, tensed at the blond greeting her. She and Draco had left the tea shop, and he had continued to follow her, even accompanying and her when she went to buy shorts and a tanktop for her new class and recommending the shortest and tightest ones to buy. "You have got to be kidding me." Luna, however, continued to lazily analyze Harmony.
"Is that the best you can do?" he asked and stabbed the glass. The locket shrieked and Harmony's hand slipped away from it. The fang meet it again and again, till what was left were the shattered pieces of glass and metal. Draco dropped it to the floor.
"I came here to buy something, not to watch you fight, though the 'watch you' part may be accurate," he gave her a smirk. "Cause it seems like such great entertainment, go on, continue why you shouted that you aren't a weak little boy." He continued to eye her, and laughed a bit in a self satisfied kind of way. It made her knuckles go white.
"I can see him over there glaring at all of us, I doubt that he can do half of what you can, if not anything." The song ended and Draco brought her closer to the heat of the dance floor. The music started up slowly at first, but picked up, and the students cheered. Harmony moved with the music and brought her arms up, suddenly she was glad that no one knew who she was. She felt free to step close to Draco and smile like an idiot. She could be unknown, but also be his girlfriend, and this lie was so much easier to believe than the truth.
The next day Harmony came prepared. She wore her gym clothes under her school uniform and was almost glad to see Draco there. "Hello Harmony," he said, and Harmony rolled her eyes.
Harmony looked down at what she was wearing, and noticed that her black tanktop revealed the dragon tattoo on her shoulder, and that the silver pendant that curved in the shape of yet another dragon hung around her neck. "I love dragons." She admitted. It was true. Her respect for the creatures that began in fourth year when she faced the Horntail, had only grown. When she had found herself looking into the blood-red eyes of the Hebridean Black, raw unmitigated power stared back down at her. It was honestly a rush-even more so when the dragon didn't kill her.
She didn't dare call out to see if anyone was there. She timidly stepped into the wide hall where along the walls were statues of life sized men, with sour looks on the lot of them, staring down at her. There were empty portraits with silver frames that hung askew, vases with dead flowers, and a thin layer of dust that veiled the Victorian cabinets. The floor was a spotted marble, and light passed through the windows like ink splotches. Her wand was held out, and she took slow steps so that she could hear inside the rooms as she passed. Harmony looked back before stepping on a stairway, and tracing the rail that curved in a tight spiral. The tip of her wand let off a light glow as she descended into the dark. The temperature dropped, and the coolness chilled her heated face.
"I'm taking the scenic route." Draco brought up the papers in his hand to look at the map of Hogwarts with all the rooms labeled.
He flexed in the mirror and felt much better about himself as he replaced his silk pajamas with a school uniform. He spent a bit longer that day making sure that he was absolutely delectable. He found Blaise waiting for him in the common room, and walked with him to the dining room.
"You can't get rid of me so easily," Draco said, hurt and anger overpowering him. He leaned closer to her, grazing her leg against his own and feeling her body falter from his light touch. He trailed a hand up from her wrist to her shoulder where he could feel the warmth from the exposed skin of her neck. He watched her green eyes the entire time as they widened and watched him intently. He moved closer yet as she pressed her back into thick padding. His hand brushed the inside of her shirt as he finally felt what he sought. He pulled out the chain of a locket, and felt the final blow of her turning him down. He didn't look at her as anger swept through him. "This isn't the necklace I gave you," he said and dropped the locket against her chest.
"You will go to sleep for 24 hours which will dissolve the prior puberty stopper potion and you will wake up as a prepubescent girl. This will enable the transformation to hurt much less since you will be under a lethargic influence. Then over the summer you will begin all of the wonderful and fascinating ordeals of many young witches." Snape ended with unsuppressed glee as his hands danced a bit for effect on the 'wonderful' and 'fascinating' part. Yes this was a wonderful day for Snape. "I am at the final stages of the potion and it will be finished soon."
She gasped as she laid eyes on the ferret, it reminded her of a small polar bear. "wow," she said in a low voice and squatted down to see it better. "You're lost, huh, who's your owner?" the ferret made a ki noise before taking timid steps towards the girl.
Ginny passed the slip of paper over to Harmony to share the message. Harmony's eyes flicked over the parchment reading it quickly before passing it back.
All at once the water left her shivering body and Harmony noticed Hermione as she passed her with a worried look. Harmony nodded her head, and mouthed back a thank you. She didn't have enough time to change for Charms, to make all of the dampness leave, and Harmony sat at her desk with cold feet. At least she didn't have to worry about the Ravenclaws making her life miserable.
"Today we shall be brewing the antidote for some of the most toxic concoctions known to the wizarding world. Your attention is crucial today because you will be testing your antidote against several of these toxic poisons. And you wouldn't want to spend the masquerade party in the hospital wing, now would you," Snape said indifferently. Behind his back a list of ingredients appeared on the black board. "Turn to page six hundred and sixty six, and begin." Snape extracted from his robes a vial filled with a liquid that looked to be water, but most definitely wasn't, to the students' dismay.
Because of her, he didn't terrorize the first years. Because of her he didn't pick fights. Because of her, he was becoming something close to good. He laughed aloud. No. It had been inconceivable that he would change for anyone. As impossible as it was, he would risk it all for her. She made him crazy, torn up and elated. He smiled at the hopeless lure he caught himself in. He had been such a petulant child.
"It's alright Ron," Harmony said, "I don't care." Ron continued to glare at Draco to which he responded with a smirk. Ron looked a little put out and gaped at Harmony.
"At least it doesn't smell like rotten food like last year," Dean replied. The majority of the students in the small room were Gryffindors and Draco leaned against the shelves.
"Exactly. You don't have to go there with anyone, if that's what is holding you back." Draco watched her closely. "Unless you really want to be alone."
Behind him, he felt the presences of something else. It was a light vibration that normally he would not have picked up. He faced the noise, and under his breath he muttered a disorienting spell. A hazy blue light shot from his wand and struck a wooden wall, but not before he made out the outline of someone. He smirked at his success, and dove behind a ledge and shot another spell. He wasn't sure if he had hit the person, but he continued on. From the other end of the room, someone else was running atop the wall structures and jumping from ledge to ledge. He watched as the thin frame of the girl dodged different colored spells. He stationed himself between two walls that made a corner, thinking that nothing could then sneak up on him. But when he felt the presence of yet another, he had miscalculated. he had not created an exit way, and had essentially backed himself into a corner. He silently cursed his foul luck, and kept absolutely still. His wand was held out in front of him, and shock as he looked from side to side. He could almost feel the breath of that person standing over him, and he lashed out with his wand, firing with spell after spell. He took a few steps to run away, but something had grabbed his arm, Pushing him into the nearest wall. Large hands clasped over the back of his neck and shoulder, pinning his face into the wall. He knew that it had to be Professor Kingscross.
"I can't believe this," Harmony muttered and read on. 'It was confirmed that ten high-security prisoners, in the early hours of yesterday evening, did escape. We strongly suspect that the breakout was engineered by a man with personal experience in escaping from Azkaban; notorious mass murderer Sirius Black, cousin of the escapee Bellatrix Lestrange...'
"This, this is just an old charms essay." Harmony explained. Ginny reached over and pulled her hand straight. Staring at the ring there.
"This way," he shouted, and they went towards Hogwarts. Their handles pointed up, and they went along the castle walls, higher and higher. They passed the castle roof and continued on. Harmony looked to the moon and she held out her hand as if that tiny orb was a snitch. It was colder here, and soon they were forced to level out. "I have never been this high up before," Draco said as his legs nearly brushed hers. She watched the visible breaths that left his lips.
Draco knew that someone was in the room, and he would totally take house points off for being out at such a late hour, because whoever it was had indirectly tripped him and thereby insulted the respectable Malfoy name. He grudgingly picked up the silky cloth when he heard another noise.
Harmony had not anticipated revealing anything to anyone. When she choose to keep her identity a secret, to not tell even her two best mates, it was not just for their safety, or keeping things as simple and unchanged as if nothing were amiss. It was more than not wanting to hear their pity, their platitudes for a situation they would never understand and mark her even more as a freak.
Harmony noticed with the usual low whispering there were high pitched squeals and giggling throughout the room. She also saw some people pointing towards the staff table, and then she knew why. A new face had joined the Hogwarts staff, a face with a charming smile. He had umber brown hair and from where she sat, she could see his honey colored irises and tan skin. He looked to be in his late twenties and also thankfully did not look like Lockheart's lost twin. She could agree with the girls that he was indeed striking.
"Why are you soaked?" Harmony turned to see an amused Draco who had obviously finished his work out. He had a towel over his shoulder which Harmony eyed.
Harmony's eyes narrowed in annoyance. "We were talking about how wonderful my boyfriend is, and Hermione burst into tears. She just can't believe how lucky I am."
"Ron," Ginny pushed her brother away, "you're being a turd." Ginny was shining in her flaming red dress, and glared at her brother.
"Ron, lay off it, he only wants to make himself feel better by belittling others, so just ignore what he says, that's what I try to do." Hermione patted Ron on the knee. Harmony wanted to drown them out of her head, she was already forming a headache.
Skin peeled off Voldemort, and his body thudded against the floor. Bones visibly contorted and moved under his skin as he began to convulse violently. His red eyes rolled back and bloody saliva fell from his clenched teeth, and yet still he did not scream in pain. Magic seeped from him, crackling and scorching the walls. His three followers did nothing to help him. His head snapped up, facing Harmony. "It is Potter!" Red slitted eyes were on her. "He did this to me! I must know the prophesy." Magic seared against the door, bursting it open. She toppled over, thrown into the door behind her, which gave way. She fell on her back, feeling the straw prickling at her neck and arms. Without thinking, she sent magic to slam the door. Panic twisted her stomach, and she scrambled blindly, for any way out. A groan came from her left, and she shout out for light. On the floor lay the crippled figure of a man, whose fingerless palm and metal were covering his eyes.
"You!" he spat, and under his breath whispered a disarming spell. The spell ripped the wand from her fingers, and Harmony seethed. "Who are you?" he asked, wiping blood from his cheek.
"As much as I enjoy," Snape said giving Dumbledore a slight glance "…helping you Potter. Since I am the one administering the potion I must also make sure everything goes smoothly." Harry continued to stab daggers at him in his mind.
"The blood that Voldemort took from you had been infused with that magic and he took parts of it with him, along with the shield that your mother gave to protect you.
"Wah...Ginny," Hermione muttered, "Harry, it's not like that. Honestly." Hermione continued when Harmony failed to respond, "We just wanted to know, so that we could help." Harmony felt a migraine forming. "Harry, I'm so sorry about Sirius."
Ginny was the first to pass through, and Draco had not even the time to acknowledge her when she gripped his arms and pushed him back. "Draco," she whispered, "what are you doing to Harmony? She is even worse!"
"It's best if you wait a bit, Cub," Leighton said, "till you heal your heart." Draco twitched over a certain word and glared at him.
"Oh, right," Harmony replied as he whispered spells that immediately smoothed out her skin, removing the pain.
"Don't you dare lie to us. You have been a boy ever since we got your ungrateful hide. I ought to throw you out now and end all of this funny business." Vernon sputtered with venomous rage. "You are a freaky crime against nature and you're lucky I have put up with you." Aunt Petunia put a bony hand on his arm and nodded even as her bottom lip quivered.
Harmony looked from Ginny to the little hand being offered, and a tiny smile lifted her cheeks. "Alright," their hands clasped, and she realized that this was the first time holding a girl's hand, and completely not caring about it. "just so long as you aren't joining me to be close to the new professor."
"I take it that you havn't looked at the prophet today," she said and passed one over. Harmony didn't have to flip anything in order to see the words 'Massive Breakout at the Ministry' and mug shots of known death eaters. The worst had to be a crazed Beatriz Lestrange, and Harmony looked up and noticed that Neville hadn't been present since she got there.
"Alright, Fletcher," she said, " if you ever steal anything from here again, I will personally remove you from the house." The magic dissipated from his limbs and the man looked at both of them livid with anger.
He regarded her with a cool air, "I'm on prefects duty," he said and his eyes fell on Harmony. Which indirectly told them his reasons for crouching behind a door, and blatantly eavesdropping.
"She grew up hating her father, till she met Potter. Potter told her it was some other scumbag who betrayed his parents, not Black. He knew because Sirius Black is Harry Potter's god father. Then they became friends."
"He's picking up the speed, and watching at different angles," Harmony said, "soon one of them will begin to feign seeing the snitch, or when the score becomes more uneven, then one of them will catch it. Right now, they're watching-"
"For one, I know Draco well enough to tell that he's not mourning anyone right now. He's angry that he can't get what he wants, but we would be seeing a very different Draco if, well, if he thought that his girlfriend was dead."
"You know very well what is wrong," Harmony said, forcing her eyes not on his chest and at his face. "I can't change with you here." Draco's face lifted as he thought of the implication to what she just said.
"I don't know," McGonagall shook her head. She rejoined the other slumbering Gryffindors and read the book under her blanket. She was hoping for some hidden message within the text, but it was a common story of Snow White, similar to the muggle version. She closed the book, and shoved it underneath her pillow. Her last thoughts before closing her eyes were of the queen, as she gazed into the mirror.
"Well, no, we're just hanging out. For fun… Together." Harmony couldn't quite tell the difference between what she was doing from dating. But surely there was a difference. Surely she had seen Hogwarts students doing that exact thing. Like Ron and Hermione….. "Right."
"Your father was here on ministry business," Snape started, but frowned when he met Draco's impatient huff. "Knowing is too dangerous for you and your family."
"Well, if I were to lose that portkey among a sea of shells, then that wouldn't have been pleasant." Kingcross then pointed to the portkey. "A one, a two, and a three!"
"No one is telling you to listen to me, Potter. But if you want to pass potions this year, just a little cooperation is needed. I plan to get good marks, so do hurry up and get the ingredients while I set up."
Harmony didn't know what to think. She wouldn't have cared if she was a guy, so what would make her see him as any different. Had Draco changed? She didn't think so. She was just studying him, she told herself. Such a rapt attention she would pay anyone. If it were Ron, surely then she would be doing the same. The image of Ron drained from her mind as Draco's shirt revealed the muscles which were more developed than she had thought. Her gaze traveled up to his face, to the smirk and keen eyes he presented her.
She had a wand in a small purse that Ginny had given to her, and walked as fast as she could to the stairwell where she had told Draco to meet her.
"Let me check my schedule," he pretended to pull out a slip of paper, "nope, but I noticed that we haven't bonded in a while so I figured that you missed me." Potter gave him an incredulous look and Draco got comfortable on the opposite side of him. "So anything new happen…hmm?" The other boy chose not to answer. "You know it helps if you say something back."
"Strange," he said and really looked at her eyes. Eyes that he could have sworn he had seen before. He stepped to the girl with confidence.
"Then off to bed the both of you." Draco Malfoy slinked away into darkness. Harmony took a few steps then turned around. She caught up with the professor at his door.
"Cooking is improvising from a standard procedure, Potions is just way too precise and stressful for me," Harmony said. He gave a little laugh.
"Guess you aren't a marine animal, Frisker," Kingscross commented. Shite faced buggard, Draco thought bitterly. He wanted to drag the man into the ocean drown his sorry arse. Luna and Ginny stared at him, and Draco felt embarrassment next. He couldn't see Harmony, and pictured her forming gills, or with bulging eyes, but it didn't fit with his image of her. He examined his surroundings and saw that they were on a dirty shore, gray with foam and pollution. No wonder his mouth tasted like rust and salt. Harmony was to his side, lying on her back, looking deathly pale. He put two and two together, and figured that Harmony had suffered like him. Kingscross's head nodded sagely. "Now you all know what its like to be in a habitat that is most definitely not your own. Maybe our next lesson will be on swimming." Draco shot looks like bullets into their Professor's head. He wanted to yell at that man, for almost killing him and Harmony. He still felt weak, and his body trembled with cold. "Let's go back." Draco didn't protest as the portkey traveled through the air into the waiting outstretched hands of him and the others. When they returned to his office they brought with them sand that poured to his floor. Kingscross looked at the shivering bodies, two of which were on the floor, and at sour faces. He waved his hand, and the water dried from their clothes and disappeared from the floor. The smell of salt lingered. "Should we continue or end our session today?" Luna and Ginny looked at each other and down at the others. Harmony was struggling up.
Harmony waited for Ginny and Luna, and hoped that they wouldn't mention how close Leighton had gotten to her. She was wrong as Ginny grabbed on to her arm and leaned into her. "That was something," Luna said, as she skipped next to them. Harmony closed the door and didn't look back to see if Leighton was still there.
"Good," Leighton said softly. "I want you to picture something in your mind to act as a shield, and to only focus on that. Like a protonus, think of something that can protect you, or something that gives you strength and happiness. That will be the anchor to your mind."
"What's making that hissing noise?" Draco asked. The hyenas were turning their tails, leaving as a pack for safety.
Draco waited a few minutes until opening his eyes. He didn't know what to think or believe. It was impossible and illogical; people don't start exchanging junk like that. Potter was the Boy Wonder for something. If someone could survive a killing curse then it would be probable for them to defy nature's other laws. Potter would be Potter no matter what gender. Did this mean he couldn't muggle fight with him anymore, well not like he did such a barbaric thing anyway. Well Draco did hex girls as well as boys, so maybe everything would be fine. So it still would be fair to fight dirty. Yes, nothing would change between them.
"Nothing," he said, "there is nothing new to say about the boy." Voldemort screamed in frustration. He stood over Severus, like a hungry vulture ready to pick out the eyes of its prey.
"So you do prefer me to trifle with you," Draco smirked, leaning in closer, "but I hadn't anticipated that you would respond to that so nicely."
She took the locket from her neck and held it in her fist. She remembered the time when she had been a child with Ron and Hermione, standing in front of that very sink. It was time to open the Chamber of Secrets.
"But why would someone do that?" Ginny asked him with the locket shaking in her hands as if it could lash out and kill.
"So who is the other ring for?" Ron asked as they left the store. "What's her name?" Harmony laughed besides herself.
"Yes he can," Harmony stepped closer, "Kreacher I command you to retrieve what has been stolen." Kreacher gave a wicked smirk before a stream of magic shot from his finger and hit Fletcher. The man slumped to the floor pinioned and petrified. "I have inherited all that was my late God father's, and I want you to return what's rightfully mine."
"Yes, but only if it was so simple," Leighton said and pushed back his short hair. "He would have to repent for all of his acts of evil in order to become whole again, and I doubt that he could."
"She's not going with you, you already took her once today during breakfast to do your nails. Absolutely not." Draco cut in.
"Well I suppose that you wouldn't be able to follow the given instructions, but why would you know how to cook anyway?" She gave him a shrug.
"You don't mind me being there?" Draco asked. She looked at him sideways and Draco looked into her girl like appearance while he had the chance.
"Wait, so you want to be with Snape and our occlomency lessons?" Ginny's beaming smile dimmed a bit.
"For the prophecy," Dumbledore sighed, "or more correct for the answer to his ailment. But the prophecy wont tell him anything." At the mention of the prophecy, Severus clammed up, his face becoming blank. Dumbledore noticed that as well. "The prophecy still stands, but there is also a new one that I was lucky to witness." There was much pain behind Severus's eyes that he could not conceal, no matter how many years of masking his emotions.
"Let's go that way," Harmony pointed where the Death Eaters had come from. They ran, dodging broken furniture. Harmony put out her hand, when she thought she heard something strange. It was a piercing laughter. With a finger to her mouth, they crept along the blackened wall toward the only slightly ajar room. Her caracal form leaped to the ground, and slunk through the door. She could see the outlines of robed figures, black against the drawn, shredded velvet of the curtains. Her ears perked, as something large enough to be a body thudded and clattered to the floor, as the Death Eaters continued to yell hexes.
"I'm a bloody WHAT?" Harry couldn't say female, instead he voiced his distress in what sounded like the mating calls of a hippogryph. He was seething mad and could not find any objects to hurtle around. He meant to spring up and strangle the headmaster, but his yelling alerted Madame Pomfrey who forced the headmaster out, much to Dumbledore's relief and Harry's annoyance. "That's not right come back and explain it to me." Harry tried to say nicely, in order to convince the elder man that he was in control of his emotions, but failed miserably.
"Tomorrow our focus will be to become familiar with all kinds of weapons, torture devices, and such. To know the weapon, is to know its strengths and weaknesses. To defend against the dark arts, is to combat against them. Class dismissed." Leighton ended with a wave and ambled back to his office. Students ran for the door like a flock of startled pigeons. Ron and Harmony had matching looks of bewilderment.
"Is this really going to work? It seems too simple." Harmony asked, looking at the slipper Ginny had placed by the door. If anyone opened the door, the twin shoe was enchanted to start dancing, and the two of them would portkey back.
"Sure," Draco said. "Crabe and Goyle sleep in the dorm room. Blaise and Theodore's rooms are down that hall." When Draco opened the door the first thing that hit her was the smell. It was a boy's room all right, as if they had sweat in the sheets and had failed to wash it. She knew that smell, it radiated off Duddley like dribbles of mayonnaise. They must have snuck some food in there as well, because something sour and overripe permeated through the room.
"They should just stop following the mad man," Draco said without thinking and Snape slammed a hand onto his desk.
"Yeah, the Daily Prophet's abridged version. I was hoping that you could tell me more." Harmony searched his tired face.
The song ended and Kingscross gave her a small bow, and grinned as he thanked her for the dance. It was then, that Draco made his move.
She winced as her forehead burst in pain. A foreign wicked pleasure of having killed someone drilled into her scar. A name swept through her head, like a passing thought. "Dumbledore," she hissed and got down to a knee. A blue stream of magic fired at them, and Harmony watched as it bounced off a hastily casted shield and returned to the sender. The man shrieked, with a wand to the dark mark, and Harmony was hoisted up. Her head still pounded, with the drumming all she could contain. She saw the headmaster, on the floor, with a charred arm bent back at an impossible angle. She didn't know if he was dead, and it took all her effort not to join in on Voldemort's uncontrolled glee.
They sat there watching the other girls fall, till class ended, and Harmony almost forgot about Draco when she opened the changing room. She half expected to see him topless, waiting for her, but he wasn't and Harmony shrugged her shoulders.
"Good job," Leighton said, "also the females of this species are about a quarter heavier than the males." The hawk preened in delight, displaying her feathers and puffing up her chest. She landed on a branch near enough to the surface. The seashell lay between all of them. Though Ginny blatantly wanted to fly more, she began to shift back to her human state. She had dismounted from the branch with a crack and before her feet touched the floor, she was human. Draco thought the transformation looked absolutely hideous. But he had to admit that she was an awesome animal. He imagined all of the amazing animals he could be as he grabbed the portkey along with the others. The cliff left him in a swirl of molten colors, and was replaced by a vortex of darks and lights before they were thrown to the floor of Kingscross's office.
"You already gave it a lot of thought. Perhaps I should hex your room as well, so they can't entirely blame you on it."
"Ginny!" Ron expressed in a mild reprimanding tone. He waited a few moments till he said "well, I hope that the new professor is a good looking witch, so that I won't mind getting punished during night detentions."
"I had not the slightest clue that the hyenas would be there," Kingscross smiled in an apologetic way that only taunted Draco. "The meat was meant to drive the animals away from us, so that they wouldn't be hungry for human flesh." And Draco began to seethe in anger. Their professor was full of bullocks. The wand was still in his hand, and he gripped it tighter, ready for the spells that wouldn't come during the hyena attack to now rain down upon the man. For a moment he was going to do it. But he stopped. A small part of him knew that he had to bid his time, to calculate. Something rough touched the leg where the hyena had bitten him. At his feet was the caracal, licking him. He was surprised and stepped back. She looked up at him with round pupils. A warmth touched him as he crouched, and spread further as he brought a hand close to her. The contact of fur calmed him as he patted her, and he could see that there were no other markings printed on Harmony's fur. He smiled, and all of his anger was momentarily forgotten.
"Harmony," Draco stepped in front of her, "your hands." She hadn't noticed that they were shaking, and she clenched them into fists.
"And knowing you, you will pull up at the very last second and very much likely die." Harmony scoffed at that.
Draco skipped dinner and waited at the spot that he and Harmony usually met up before Leighton's lessons begun. He needed to talk to her, and tel her about the tiara. He hoped that if he was the one to tell her why Sirius died, then she would forgive him. It was not like she could mourn forever.
"But how would he know? It's not like you were walking around in drag." There was a lingering silence that was only disturbed by a rustling of a page being flipped as Harmony recalled a certain flowing cream colored sundress. "No, way!" Ginny whispered. Harmony's checks began to sprinkle a ruddy hue. "Oh, Merlin, that must have been a treat. Hey! I want to see too!" Ginny pouted. "Please!"
Draco only saw her once before she left on the train. He had asked Snape if he could go with Harmony back to where ever she was going, but he told him to stay. He wasn't even allowed to ride the Hogwarts express with her, so Draco stood waiting on the platform. The snow had picked up and he stood ankle deep in snow. When Harmony came, she had dark circles under her eyes that matched his own. Snape and McGonagall escorted her, and Harmony barely looked at him. He wanted to hold her tight, and see her smile. He didn't care that the professors watched him as he handed her a small velvet bag. He didn't seem to notice that his hair was messed up, or that he wasn't wearing a jacket. All that entertained his thought was Harmony. He wanted to tell her Merry Christmas, but he knew that if he opened his mouth, he would tell her not to go. She looked at the black bag silently before reaching into her own robes and retrieving a pair of bundled up socks. She passed it to him unceremoniously, and Draco felt his hopes rise besides the fact that he was given a pair of worn and fraying pair of socks. She left before he could say thanks, just passed him without a word. Snape looked back at him with a frown as Draco gripped the socks in his hands. He hoped that she wouldn't throw his gift away.
Draco kept a straight face, though his muscles tensed. He knew that this would have happened sooner or later, though not this early. "I cannot, father. I-," Draco paused, and met his father's unnerving eyes, "I do not want anything to do with him." Mr. Malfoy blinked down at his son in utter bewilderment.
The significantly large blob of a bear transformed into a slightly smaller large blob of a man. Draco didn't have to squint his eyes to know the grin on his face. "Then compensate for it, Frisker," he supplied and leaned against a tree, "make a trap for us." Harmony stood in her girl form next to Draco, the cold already seeping into her robes like frigid breaths. She could make out the flutter of wings against the starry sky, and Ginny landed close by on one foot. Harmony frowned as her bum began to sting, but otherwise ignored it. The last of the caracal's thoughts emptied from her mind and the rushing beats of her heart slowed.
The Death Eater that Ginny, Luna and Neville were dueling against suddenly ripped down his sleeve right in the middle of a hex, gawking at his forearm. The man bolted and mid-stride he disintegrated into black smoke that shot out of an open window. With their opponent gone, the three of them watched as one by one, Death Eaters across the room began retreating. "Is it over?" Neville asked with his wand still out.
"Fine, but don't think I'm done." Ginny returned to her book and gave out a big huff of breath. Harmony turned to her own essay and wondered if she should cross out the last sentence she had written.
"Snape's cupboard," she said, "he won't miss it." She smiled at her handy work and went to Blaise's room next. Naturally it was locked, which didn't mean a thing to her.
"Did you just...read my thoughts?" He looked at her in disbelief. "So Legilimency is what you do with Professor Snape." Draco began to laugh, "and yet, Professor Snape hasn't killed himself or you yet. Impressive." Harmony didn't even try to hide what she was doing with Snape.
"Then you aren't ready," Kingscross announced as if it was expected, "we will go back." Draco sneered at his surroundings. The professor must have brought him to the wrong place on purpose. He didn't live in a cage! He stomped to where the others were waiting, none of them said a word to him.
Then out of nowhere she had caught his eye. Even then, he probably wouldn't have noticed if not for the sleek dragon tattoo. There was something more than pretty about the girl. There was a flicker of danger about her, a ferocity hiding below the surface. He recognized the feeling from working with dragons. His hand moved to the shiny patch that wrapped around his forearm, a reminder of a dragon that had been unassuming. A runt that had seemed calmer than the rest before it had nearly killed him.
The spell sent Sirius backwards into a table and breaking it. Breaking Sirius too. Blood blossomed through Sirius's front robes and Harmony felt her chest ache. "No," she said, this could not be happening. She turned to Mr. Malfoy, to see the smirk there. A hate consumed her, and magic swarmed through her, crackling with a biting rage. She pointed her wand at him, and for the first time, she desired suffering for another. "Do you know what you have done?" she asked him and felt a cold dread. Mr. Malfoy looked down at Harmony, believing the girl to be no real threat. Draco looked stricken as he held his bloody foot, and watched his father and Harmony.
Harmony couldn't bring it and leave it somewhere, if she lost it, she'd have to go through each nook and cranny in the school. Harmony would just have to wait till the coast was clear. In the mean time, she practiced walking with the heels. They were uncomfortable, but at least she didn't look so short. She walked around the room and after a bit she wasn't hobbling. Harmony stared at herself in the mirror, and she hoped that she wouldn't make a fool out of herself there. The heels weren't sticks as she first thought, and as she tapped her foot and moved a bit, she watched as her body moved in the reflection. She was slim, but not like when she was a boy.
"You are lucky though, considering what's left. Imagine if I had to be with Pansy, and had to listen to her bash your girl all day." It seemed like Draco had gone back to ignoring his friend, and soon they were at the wall. "So did you let Potter in our common room?"
"Sirius," Harmony said to the wagging dog, "I'll visit you every chance I can." Sirius changed back to his human form, forgetting the bone in his mouth in the process. He sat next to Harmony.
"If you say so, but you missed a great night," Ron muttered. And he began to fill her in what she missed, about what she already knew. She had been there. Seen the costumes, heard the music, tasted the punch that Fred and George had tampered with, witnessed the neon pink of half a certain professor's robes. She had seen that all, and tried to look interested.
"Well, I do want to study to become an auror," Leighton replied ",but I feel it's something important that everyone should learn in dire-"
"Don't take me for one of your worshiping fans, I happen to have a free block of time, so they assigned me prefect duties. You know, escorting lost first years, catching kids skipping, boring stuff like that." From his robes he extracted papers. "And I know for a fact that you have Divinations, I have every students' schedule and all of the classes for this semester."
The Defense Against the Dark Arts room was situated between the two houses and Harmony was glad not to encounter any teachers along the way. She brought her hand to her face and brushed off the remnants of her face cream.
"Take care." Harmony gazed at her God Father once more, before putting the mirror away. At least now she had a lead. What could be in the Department of Ministries that Voldemort could want? Voldemort was seeking something. Her head began to ache. Like she was trying to remember something she had forgotten. She tried to calm her mind and meditate. To turn her mind into a blank canvas, an unwritten book.
"Dumbledore is after the missing students," Harmony said. Ginny's amazement showed briefly behind the girl's eyes before she put a hand to her face.
"I saw you holding hands with him at the funeral. What is it Ginny? Don't even try to pretend that there isn't something going on here," he demanded.
"A house elf gave it to me to destroy. He said that it was his last order before his master died. It won't break, no matter what spell I use." Draco was shoved sideways, and Draco glared at the red head who had stolen his perch. He took back his though of strangely liking her.
"I couldn't tell you how many people like you my father has killed." Draco countered. "And he did it for fun."
"Goodnight," he kissed her hand and looked into her green eyes. She smiled back and he watched as she turned to leave. He stood there, even when he couldn't see her or hear her heels click.
Potter is the hottest dark haired girl-if I didn't want to get murdered by Draco, she'd be an excellent girlfriend. Cho Chang could work, but she is too much of a sob case.
"Sirius," Harmony smiled back, "Have you been taking care of yourself?" Sirius chuckled at her and nodded his head.
He placed his cup down with a tap and met her green eyes. "All I want is to be your friend." They were going in circles.
"Again," she said, while still on the floor. She brought her hands down, feeling a rush of blood pulse through her extremities.
"Oh really? Tell us who and which animal you think would be their animagus form," Draco challenged. Leighton sighed a bit.
"Do you think that these detentions will show on our records?" Draco asked, looking for something that was light. "Because I'm wondering how it will look, by the end of the year with your 100 detentions with Snape."
It was like a billion hippogriffs ravaged his body at the same time, clawing and tearing, slashing and ripping every part of him. And all Draco could think as the pain took over his body was that he had failed, and his mother was dead. Thinking of his mother was worse than having the locket pressed against him, worse than the crucio and Draco locked the thought of his mother into a dark corner, so he wouldn't drown in it.
They didn't have to go far. Just a mile and a half away, she tucked the portkey in an abandoned nest-barely any flight time at all. She transfigured back into a girl up on the branches, and waited for Harmony, watching the feline climb its way up to meet her.
"They can't do anything to me," Draco said, "the worst that will happen is that they will figure out what I care about the most and try to destroy it. So in reality, they will hurt you more, knowing that it will give them the satisfaction of hurting both of us."
It was a gray afternoon that Dumbledore was buried, cloudy and seeping with undertones of orange. Harmony stood off to the side as Harry Potter, feeling as the cool wind played with her hair. The black lake rippled against the shore, with faces just below the surface, watching with yellowed eyes. Ringed around the lake, the centaurs had come to pay their respects. Standing solemnly with their bows slung across their backs and pawing their hooves anxiously into the muddy ground.
"Voldemort is trying to figure out why he is turning into a woman, or into something like a woman." Dumbledore twirled the end of his beard between his fingers.
"Just wondering how Potter has been since our last run in at the bookstore." Harmony turned from the window to see steel eyes locked in on her face. No. He continued to scrutinize her as if seeing the girl under her mask. He couldn't know, not even her best mates figured it out, and they spent half the summer together. This had to be some joke he was playing at. He wouldn't stop gazing. No. He knew.
"Damn it, damn it, damn it all to hell," she muttered under her breath. And damn her voice for sounding so disgustingly girly. She wanted to punch the mirror in front of her, but doubted her arms would even be strong enough to crack it. She bit her bottom lip and scrunched up her little nose in distaste.
"Yeah, that's a good laugh." Neville joined in, "With P-professor Snape leading them in with his g-giant nose." Ron laughed and back slapped Neville, hitting Harmony in the process.
A white bumble bee crawled against the wooden panels of a low ceiling. It crept like an old man, slow and twitching. It could have been mistaken for a speck of dust, or a star against the vastness of the blackened room. The door croaked open and the bee made one last step before dropping to the floor.
"Alright that's it," he said, "let's get back." Harmony held half of the potions as they carried them to their desk. Draco set up the cauldron and Harmony followed Draco's instructions. Soon the sound of chopping and stirring filled the room and Snape sat at his desk, watching the students with disdain.
Harmony's gray vest fell to the ground and Harmony glanced at Draco, wondering how this even started. He was topless with his hands unbuckling his belt, and Harmony turned quickly away. Even though she knew that he wouldn't do anything to her, Harmony couldn't help but think that something more could happen. Her heart beat faster, and she shook her head. What was wrong with her? She had seen so many of her house mates undress. She knew what a bloke looked like. But Draco was different. She had tried to suppress that kiss they shared, but it didn't stop her body from remembering. The hate between them had long gone, and she had already forgiven him. Draco liked her, and she couldn't understand why; Why he'd go through all this trouble for her. And even so, something was stopping her from relishing the feeling of being in his arms.
The entirety of the events was barely able to process in her exhausted mind. Leighton stood before her and produced a cup of hot chocolate. She gave him a grateful turn of her lips as the steaming cup contrasted sharply against her frigid fingers. How had this happened? Dementors don't just appear like that. Sure she had a mad raving psycho killer and his troop of monkeys out for her blood, but no one else really wanted to kill her.
"Lumos!" Kingscross said with a clear voice. The light blinded Draco's eyes. "Cub, congratulations." Draco opened his eyes a smidgen, and he saw a cat with its ears back growling in the direction of the hyenas. "Cub," Kingscross snapped his finger, "Harmony." The cat's ears twitched in the professor's direction. "That's well enough." Draco examined the cat from where he sat. It was just about over 100 cm, but wasn't as big as Draco had thought it would be, based on the racket it had made. It was nowhere near the size of a lion or any big cat. It looked at him, and he could see Harmony. She had long black ears with tassels at the end of each ear tip. Across her forehead was a black marking of a thunderbolt. Her nose was a dark pink, and she had the same green colored eyes. Though she was medium sized, she had impressive muscles under sandy golden fur. Her under belly was white, and when she took a few steps, it was like she was taught with power and feline grace. Her tail tapered between her legs and she moved it with delight. Harmony was a beautiful creature. She sniffed some raw meat on the ground and a curious tongue darted on the surface. Ginny and Luna came closer as well to admire the cat.
"Ugg, he likes to torment me, and does a good job at it. Sorry Leighton, I got to go, but thanks, Thank you for everything."
"And that's exactly why I have to do all of this," Ginny responded, "and anyway it is fun, like having a sister."
She trailed along the green leather chairs and looked back at Draco. "Where does everyone sleep?" she asked,
"Should we wake her up?" Harry reluctantly opened her eyes to see the mammoth Dudley and his monkey gang who tormented her as a boy kneeling over her. Immediately she went for her wand but stopped at Dudley's peaceful gesture.
"I was right," he said at last, "You do look better without those dorky glasses." She almost faltered in her steps, and did not dare to look back at him, or else show him her slight smile and held in laugh. He really must pull everything from his pompous arse.
"Harmony then," the professor said, through the silence her name bounced around in her head and as if it echoed through the hall. Behind Harmony's back, Draco narrowed his eyes. "Is there a problem here?"
When had his ambitions become so spineless? He had previously blamed it on the potion that she blotched and that had exploded all over him and made him sparkle in the light. He was sure that it had twisted his thoughts to see her better. And for a moment that had scared him when he found out that he generally liked the girl. But he knew inside his heart that it was all wrong. He knew that he could destroy Potter at any moment. But it disturbed him. He stared at his reflection and gave a heart throbbing smile.
"Very good," Leighton said, "but it's too late, the mouse just died." Draco glared at the man and tried the different spells on the mouse anyway. The mouse jerked whenever a spell hit it, and it looked much better without the ribs and innards poking through. It was a very cute mouse by the time Draco finished. And then with a final touch, Animum pulsare, the heart restarter, the mouse twitched and lived once more .
Mixed among the Hogwarts students, Harmony could spot members of the Order, looking solemn in their robes of black. Remus caught her eye, and Harmony reminded herself to listen as McGonagall said her parting words over Dumbledore's white marble tomb. She looked at her fingers hooked with Ginny's and she noticed that her own hands were just as soft. Everything felt surreal, almost peaceful, so when the black speck began to grow across the lake, Harmony wouldn't have believed the fire that began to rain down.
"What? How did you know?" Now this was getting scary, did Malfoy develop mind raping skills from Snape?
"This is ridiculous, Draco, I'm taking you back with me." Draco stopped in his tracks and did not cower from his father's frown and growing impatience. "You will come here."
"Okay then. I know a little listen will cheer you up." Fred said holding up a pair of mutilated ears.
"Silence! You dare mock me? I will carve your face out, throw your remains across Hogwarts. Death will be your only blessing." Harmony was beginning to have a headache. Her wand felt heavy in her hands and she lifted it steadily in front of her. She took a step closer, anticipation humming through her wand. This would be the end.
A ripple of syncope shrouded his body, and he bent over his stomach, slipping the book from his grasp. Parts of him felt like ice had radiated and burned to his very cells, as if a dementor had touched him. His tendons and ligaments stiffened like bark on a tree, while his throat constricted, barely allowing him to gasp for breath. The pain took over his senses, blurring his sight, and at last his head thudded against the floor.
"I don't know! The locket- it just," Draco stopped. He saw the open locket and Harmony's blank stare. "Opened." The vines wrapped around them, and Draco tried as hard as he could to hold on to her. A tendril cut into his throat, and he was forced to let her go and watch as she was dragged down.
"For the same reason that you kissed me back." She latched at his front robes, and not in the way he wished. Her small hands clasped tightly around the material and her eyes were mere inches from his own.
"Harmony, look out!" Ginny had thrown a huge ax her way, aiming at the bear, and struck it into the wall a foot away from Harmony's head.
"You mean anymore than you already do." Ron and Harmony turned their heads to face George and Fred. "Oh is the little Ronnie Pooh scared of mean old Quidditch tryouts?"
"Is it because of that girl? Who is she? I do not approve of her." Mr. Malfoy grabbed his wounded arm and hissed. "I'm doing these things for your own good."
"Whatever it was, Professor Dumbledore doesn't seem to be too worried about it. I guess that he was suspecting a whole fight to break loose. No one died, and it looked like The Dark Lord was running away. Of course the Headmaster had to get back to Hogwarts." Harmony wished that she could brainstorm with Hermione, but she doubted that Hermione would be able to figure something out.
"Sorry," she said, "he just lost a lot of money on a bet on who would win. Harry and Ginny, you can be friends with anyone."
"Alright, would anyone else like a turn against Black?" Snape asked from where he sat at his desk. Pansy stuck her hand in the air, and tossed her hair back. "Parkinson."
"You didn't respond to my letters," Draco said quietly. "Why are you here?" And why did you have to kill a man, was left unsaid.
Harmony rested her head once more on the desk, not meeting his eyes on purpose. "Perhaps something will change my mind by then, but who knows."
He let go of her arms and cast that hand to her waist. She could reject him again. She would have done that easily too three months ago. She could have laughed at him and punched his sorry arse.
"Strange," his father said, and strode to Harmony. Draco tensed before taking a step closer, not even aware of what he would do. This was his father, and there was Harmony. It was as if he was torn between the two and Draco knew with a sinking certainity that he could not stop his father from reaching Harmony.
"Uh huh, and I think you're mental," Draco said amused. Harmony had her mouth open to suggest that they do it over the lake when a biting gust of wind froze her words. Her whole body shivered, as if Dementors had struck her.
There was nothing nicer than sipping a well made cup of Earl Grey tea, with a beautiful girl at your side. Draco relaxed, wrapping an arm around Harmony. He had her full attention now, and he wondered how Ginny would react to being left with no one to talk to but a Slytherin like Blaise.
"Hey Harry!" Harmony was not pleased with having a hundred and seventy pound boy landing on her prepubescent frame.
"I'll see if I can get it later, just leave the title on my desk." Draco gave his thanks and left the room. He wondered what to do next; he had enough time to terrorize some first year Hufflepuffs and practice some new hexes. He continued to roam the halls particularly in the direction of the medic wing, till to his dismay he caught wind of Weasley and the infuriating Mudblood. He wondered if they hooked up or something, a perfect couple in his opinion; a mudblood with a muggle loving disgrace. They were heading towards Potter, but he needed a way to spy on him too. He slowly came to a halt as a brilliant idea forced a smug smile to grace his lips. He knew he was amazing for a reason.
"How am I to look like Harry then? I can't go around wearing a skirt to defeat Voldemort." Harry blanched considerably. "I can't stay with the Dursleys as a girl!"
Draco decided that being in a secret relationship was only fun if it stayed in fact secret. Draco didn't want to kid himself if he thought dating Harmony would be easy. First, he could only flirt with her when they were alone. Second, though most of the day they spent together they had to pretend that nothing more was between them. Well he didn't want the press to hammer that they were gay for each other. He wanted Blaise to stop smirking at him whenever he said something to Harmony in class. Theodore wasn't helping either, the way that he gave them the drop dead glare, like he was a blood thirsty vampire, every freaking time Draco happened to look up.
Harmony's lips lifted to a faint smile. Even though she may not be able to spend her first month with her friends, it would still be better than wasting away in the Dursley house. "So why use a rug to travel by, Professor?"
Harmony hugged the man beside her and clutched his thin robes. And though Snape would be furious at her for being five minutes late, she stayed with her head on his chest as if nothing else mattered.
"Nervous?" he asked. She shook her head, and betrayed her thoughts. He casually stepped till he was in front of her. She couldn't look away and gripped her broom tighter with it pressed against her chest. Why had she made this silly challenge?
Harmony and Draco were hanging out in a muggle mall, still trying to decide whether they wanted frozen yogurt or ice cream. It was quite pleasant at the mall. They were surrounded by hordes of people who didn't know them, and who they would likely never see again. She was quite pleased by the way Draco had dressed up. Once he had made up his mind to dress up as a muggle, he had not only turned into a convincing muggle, but a stylish one as well. Complete with designer jeans, Timberlands, and a fitting black shirt.
Draco stayed where he was, and ignored as Kingscross spouted his nonsense. He was reminded that he still needed to come up with a nick name for Harmony. He didn't want her to be referred to as Cub any longer. "And then you say expecto patronum. Any questions?" Draco looked up from where he leaned against the wall and picked at his nails. Harmony appeared to be worlds away as she stared blankly ahead. No one said anything, and Kingscross cracked his knuckles. "Alright, the begin."
"Did someone curse you or did you lose some kind of bet?" This had to be some sick joke and she hated his smug smirk almost as much as Snape's sneer.
Above her, Ginny circled ready to dive, but there was a roar that shook them all. Harmony faced the bear that was crashing through the forest towards them. Above the bear a lemur climbed swung further up the branches, and Draco looked for a place where he wouldn't be squished. Harmony stood her ground, awaiting the challenge of the brown bear. The caracal within would not allow her to run. She waited till he was nearly atop her before lunging away, barely missing the paw that swiped at her head. Her muscles were taught and powerful throughout her body, and it didn't take much to jump three meters into the air; onto the thick end of a branch where Luna hung, clutching cartoonishly at the swinging branch. Luna's eyes were two blue blurs, and soon she jumped from the branch landing delicately on the spot between the ears of the grizzly bear. Harmony got ready to pounce down on the bear as well, but the talons aiming at her behind surprised her. She yowled, unable to turn around to face Ginny.
"Even if I did tell you Severus," Dumbledore said gently, "it is like an unsolved riddle, and will unfold in time." A frown still lowered Severus's lips, and the news troubled him.
Harmony concentrated, making sure that they were the only ones there. "Do you know where we are, at least?" Ginny asked.
"Nope, I can't go in and introduce you like that, people may draw in connections relating us together. This is going to be so much fun! Here is the invisibility cloak and purse." Ginny grabbed her and stuffed the silvery material into Harmony's hand. "Now don't be surprised, you're actually in the girl's dormitory," Ginny laughed at Harmony's groan of disbelief, "Ah! Now how did you get Professor Snape to bend over his own detentions, hmm. Did you grab his cloak and get all close with wide eyes, or did you send him a love letter?"
"She wouldn't kill pure bloods," Luna said by Harmony's side, but Harmony knew what Voldemort could do.
"Yeah, I have watched how you do potions, and if you think you can bring that to this table we might as well just not do anything and Spare Professor Snape the trouble." Many of the groups at other tables glanced back at the two, feeling slightly better about themselves that they hadn't been so poorly matched.
Draco shrugged realizing that all this meant was less time for Blaise's talking and Ginny's interfering, shooting two birds with one spell. He sipped his tea content.
"Those nasty Slytherins cheated." Harmony frowned as she turned and saw some 6th years talking. "the Ravenclaws were much better. They were wining too, till Malfoy played a fast one." They saw her staring and Harmony resumed heating up by the fire. Fred and George soon joined her.
Though exhausted, Ron's snores and his mind's habitual course to depression would unsurprisingly keep him up again. Not wanting to spend a fruitless night tossing and imprisoned, he silently crawled to the end of his bed where his trunk lay. Harry didn't bother with changing, and he slid into his shoes, secured his wand, and draped the invisibility cloak over his head. The alarm read 3:42 and he withdrew from the room with the little light that issued from the window as his solemn guide.
The dirt was frozen under her fingers, and chunks of it shot into the sky as Harmony ran. Her lithe body dogged trees, and leapt over jutting rocks. Her eyes were almost completely dilated, looking like two hollow spots. She was low to the ground, crouched behind a fern bush. The Forbidden Forest held all sorts of magical fey, and Harmony let out her own mists of breath. She wanted to become part of the forest, the caracal part of her was taking over.
"A Black?" he narrowed his eyes in thought, "who were your parents?" Harmony caught Draco's eye for a second and frowned.
She didn't respond to him, and Draco was at a loss. Did she still wish to be alone? Or worse, would she never want to see him again? He would never be able to take that kind of parting.
"I wanted to see," Harmony paused, "Professor Snape." Draco chuckled, he knew that she was lying. He smiled smugly as he patted the chair next to him.
Was everything he had done all for nothing? Maybe he did have to lose everything to be with Potter. He put his hands through his immaculate hair and cursed aloud.
"Sure," Ginny transformed into a hawk and flew off. They didn't have to wait long as the girl came back on a broom with another in her hand. She threw one down at Draco who caught it. "Hop on, Luna," she said. Luna was already on her head as a tazier lemur before Ginny knew what plopped on her.
"Lumos!" he yelled, and he could see Harmony just below him. He grasped her just as they were caught by vines. "Harmony!" he pulled her close as the vines wrapped around him. Ginny and Luna thudded after him, and struggled to get near.
Draco's focus was so engrossed, that he failed to notice the two girls who were with Harmony, even though Ginny wore a phoenix inspired dress, and Luna a cupcake costume. He didn't care to think that he looked like a fool, standing and staring while bodies moved like smoke around him. His world was gone, and she remained. The music changed to a quicker beat, becoming less formal. People were asking for dances, but Draco couldn't go to her. He wanted to get closer, to look into her eyes, and know that her gaze was only set on him as well. But if he were to catch her attention, then all of his insecurities would trouble him. She was perfect by her self, and did not need to be marred by the lies that he fed her, and that were destroying him.
Harmony shrugged her shoulders and took off her outer robes, glad that she had on her work out clothes underneath. It was strange having someone there after being alone most of the time, and not having to do everything with the fear of someone finding out who she really was. Even going to the loo was sometimes awkward, and she had to wait for everyone to leave before going. The thought of too many people knowing her predicament didn't settle well with her. The word would go out some way, like it always did.
"STOP!" Draco howled, "NOT MY MOTHER!" But Voldemort didn't even pause, he struck just below the collar bone, carving apart ribs. "NO! WHAT ARE YOU DOING?" Draco swiped his wand aiming for the sword, and Voldemort knocked Draco's magic to the floor. Crooked black nails dove into the wound, tearing out her heart. Blood blossomed outwards, spilling to the floor. He raised the pulsing heart to his lips, and took a bite. Harmony felt her body freeze and all the fur on her body stood up. He had killed her, just like Cedric, and Harmony felt the numbness and disbelief of the violence of it.
"Yeah," he said glumly, "but I want to get her something special." Ron's brows knit together, looking at bracelets that he could never afford. Harmony had already bought hair accessories for Ginny, and a turnip shaped wallet for Luna, and had some galleons to spare. She took the money from her pocket and passed it to Ron.
"What are those things?" Harmony asked as she saw a demon looking horse situated in front of the carriage that they were about to board. "They were never here before."
There was a crowd of red headed activity in front of the fire place, and Harmony wandered over to see what all the fuss was about. Harmony paused and took off her jacket as she was blasted by the warmth of the fire. She saw that Charlie Weasley was over and visiting, and she was about to say hello to him, when she suddenly remembered that she wasn't supposed to know him.
"Yep," he took Ginny's broom as well, "I'll takes these back, they're closer to the Slytherin common rooms."
"Glad to see you on your toes, but if I were- say a malicious death eater -then…" Leighton said bringing his wand to her throat and pinning down both of her hands with his other arm, "you would be much less alive." He immediately propped her up, even straitening the glasses on her nose. "But at least you didn't knock. Too many foolish wizards and witches have breathed their last by rapping on a door."
"Someone hexed him. Bad." Crabbe surprisingly answered him. Well that was not elaborate at all. Harry got a better view of Mafoy's face and snorted at the growing purple spots.
"It changes," she said, and he stepped closer to her. "Sometimes I think of my parents, or my friends, of Sirius," she hesitated on the last name, "it's all different." Draco nodded his head, and almost felt sorry that most of those she loved were already dead. They were all people that she loved, and Draco wanted her to think of him.
She brushed his downy covers and saw that her ring now took on a light red hue. She looked at him to make out his features. His room really was too dark and she squinted to see better. He sat down next to her, and Harmony wondered if it had been wrong to be sitting on his bed. She supposed that it didn't matter now that she had already done it. "You know that they'll probably know that it's you," he said.
"Well, did you see where it went?" she asked and looked around her. "And how did you fit in here, anyway?" And yet he still did not answer. "Draco, are you listening?"
Harry started changing by pulling on a pair of pants that thankfully still fit her, though not for long she had to remind herself. She chose to stay with boxers and ignored the pink panties that she didn't even want to think how Dumbledore acquired such undergarments. There was no bra, but cloth for binding her flat chest down. After she got her shirt and tie on, she thanked Madam Pomfrey and left for the Great Hall.
After Lucious had a word with a woman at the front desk, Harmony was rushed to a private room, where immediate care was provided to her. Draco took a seat in the room and silently watched as the medi-wizards worked on Harmony. He was numb. Most of it he knew would hit him later, and he would deal with that when the time came for it.
"Thanks," Draco pulled his bag over his shoulder, "but I don't need any luck." Harmony walked off and didn't notice that Ron had watched her from ahead of her.
"The Hell?" Draco muttered as he watched the red head put her ear to it and the crack at the floor. "Are you eaves dropping?" Draco dropped to one knee, knowing that he was taking a foreign liking to the Weaslyleet.
"Harmony," he touched her shoulder. Harmony flinched away from him, and looked through eyes with such sorrow, that it felt like it had been he who had sentenced the murder.
"No," Harmony frowned, "but we could put toothpaste on his mouth, so that they think he has rabies."
"I don't care if I get a years worth of detention, and I could do other things with this wand, like shove it up your pompous arse!" He gave her another smirk.
"Wand up," shouted Madam Hooch, "Wand down." Harmony mimicked the other girls as they brought their wands up with the music and down again. "Wand up, wand down, spin." The dumbfounded expression she held dissipated as she witnessed Ginny move along with the dance. Ginny held the grace of a cat as she made basic steps more elegant. "Now shake those hips girls, and you too Harry."
There were dementors surrounding her and Sirius. She looked across the lake for her father, as the wand in her grasp waved, weaker each time.
The next two days strained Harry as she felt paranoid of being discovered. The end feast in the Great Hall mourned Cedric Diggory. He also said his farewells to Fleur and Krum. It was as if someone was watching her from afar. She was glad when she got on Hogwarts Express to find an empty compartment along with her friends. She didn't join in on their conversation preferring to stare out to the passing cloudless scenery.
"Oh, both my parents come from around here and moved east during the war, guess they liked it a lot over there, but I want to be here to help. I am sure they will need my services, so I'm trying my luck for the Ministry of Magic. I believe the Dark Lord has returned, and they definitely need aurors."
He's worried, Harmony thought, and watched his features closely. Draco noticed and flashed her a smile. For once Harmony didn't turn away. "Well," Harmony said, "don't expect this to be some kind of vacation."
"Home is no longer safe," Severus said, "and take to heart what is most important to you." Draco thanked him before leaving.
A surge of green and red magic met. Harmony watched as Voldemort's sneering face fell, as neither spell would relent. Both of Harmony's hands trembled as she poured her magic into the spell. She felt the ache of her heart as it pounded blood through her, almost violently. The red was slowly overtaking the green, and she watched the disbelief cross Voldemort's eyes before the green rebounded.
"Don't know anything! Of course I do Dudley or should I say Ickle Diddykins." Dudley spun around and really looked at the girl in front of him. Harry stood at her not so imposing height of five feet and half an inch.
"There is no rescheduling dates,' he shot at her in an acidic tone. "Perhaps only times, see me later before 9 on Saturday." Harmony thanked her professor and went back to the potions room to retrieve her bag. There was no evidence of the potion debacle she had caused. There was no sign of any students there either. She crushed her disappointment well.
"I think you're mental," Blaise laughed, "but I'll see for myself." Draco watched across the room as the Gryffindors chatted with food in their mouths. He couldn't bear it any longer, but enjoyed as Blaise was silent for once, digesting things over in his mind like a medium rare steak.
Whatever the Slytherin reactions had been to her traps, their violent behavior towards her dwindled. She knew that they weren't done, that they would undermine her in more subtle ways, but for now she had the satisfaction of showing them up. They knew that it had been her. Snape must have known it too, but none of them siad anything had happened. Theodore had bald patches in his hair for couple of days, and Crabe and Goyle scratched their head constantly like a dog with fleas, while Pansy had hot pink hair for a few days, courtesy of Harmony changing the girl's hair products into dye. But overall, she hadn't hurt anyone.
"Disappeared," Hermione said in a strained voice, "died maybe..." Harmony put the kettle on the stove, and then turned around to look at Hermione again. Her eyes were looking off into the distance as she attempted to blink back tears.
"Maybe you should live and enjoy your life now before- before whatever happens." Draco gripped the locket from under his shirt and brought it over his head.
"I need to destroy this," she said, and Draco could hear clothes being ruffled. "But I do not know how." Draco put his eye against the key hole, and saw Harmony sitting in front of Leigthon. Immediately Draco bristled. She was close to him, not even a foot away. She held up a chain for him, to which he was about to touch, but stopped.
When it was time for Defense Against the Dark Arts, the Slytherins were obviously split in two. Draco knew very well where he would have been if not for Harmony. Leighton must have noticed as well as he looked at their guarded stances. "I hope you are all thinking happy thoughts," he said, "because today we will be practicing the incantation." It didn't look like his house mates were so enthused, but Draco felt otherwise. His spirits were uncommonly high, and he watched Harmony from the corner of his eye. She stood with her dorky circle glasses and rubbed the side of her face. Draco noticed that he wasn't the only one spying her. Ron had his death glare aimed at the girl looking boy, and Draco wondered if she noticed. Harmony was standing next to Nevile, and Draco wondered what a scene he would make if he went over to her. It's not like his friendship with her was secret, and as long as they didn't know the complete specifics as to why he was so interested in her, Draco didn't see the harm in going to the Gryffindor side. Half of his house already despised him, and the rest wouldn't dare talk to him.
"Yeah," Harmony went straight for her broom. She did not meet his eyes for the fear that he would read what was on her face. Or had he already? She bit her lip. She took an unnecessary long time fiddling with her gear, but she couldn't help it, not with her hands shaking. Before long she felt his eyes on her. She slid her goggles on and turned to see Draco smiling.
"For goodness sake," Hermione said as she pointed her wand at Ron's throat, and hotly muttered a spell. "Ron, chew before swallowing." He gave her a 'how-would-I-ever-breath-blink-or-do-anything-without-you' look, to which she responded by shaking her head in frustration.
Ginny didn't have the energy to be angry anymore. She leaned against the stone halls, not knowing what she was going to do. If she hadn't had six older brothers to toughen her up, she would have been crying right then.
He knew that she wasn't dead. She couldn't be. He glanced down once more at the ring that connected them. It hadn't faded to silver, as it had when Harmony had fallen at the Dark Lord's hands. He knew that she lived. And as the weeks passed, Draco expected every day to see her return. He listened for a cry of triumph throughout the school as a short midget with glasses returned. But it never came.
Draco had seen her just the day before her fight with the Dark Lord on a hospital bed, barely able to move. She was so vulnerable. As the end of the school year approached, Draco knew that he had to find her. He just had to come up with the right plan.
"Only if you chose to, but remember James and Lily had faith in Peter. They may also be subjected to torture if the enemy found out about what I am to tell you." Harry gulped, anticipating many answers. "I first thought that you were too young, and needed to be happy, but now I see the threat of Voldemort's return may put you in extreme danger. I care for you so much that I wanted to shield you from all the suffering. You have already faced him multiple times and I am afraid there will be more burdens to fall on you. I trust that you are calm enough." Harry nodded, afraid that Dumbledore would change his mind and refuse to tell.
"I don't know if it's even possible. But we can start by not getting at each other's throat." Right after she said that, she knew that he was smirking, and she knew that was about to comment on the 'at each other's throat' bit.
Harmony leaned as far away in her seat from him, juggling the caldron between them. She felt the irritation bubbling inside her.
"No, the others just can't find out, nor can my family." Harmony considered that. Though unlikely, he may be labeled a traitor or disinherited by his family, then again the Malfoy's loved him too much for that. He probably just didn't want to be the negative source of the rumor wheel.
Draco wouldn't admit it, but whenever he sat with Harmony in potions, or was in the same class with her, he got the feeling that more than one person was watching them. He deliberately didn't say anything to her, and pointedly looked elsewhere from the girl who looked like Harry Potter. They had to do something so that no more people would figure it out. Had anyone else realized? Draco looked to Theodore and hoped not.
Some of the torches along the wall had burned out, and a cool draft persisted to permeate through the concrete walls. No one was there to hear her footfalls or see her as a girl, and Harmony wondered if she needed such caution. But she had to use it. She was going to spend most of the night celebrating with Sirius. In a few hours it would be Christmas.
"Expecto patronus," they said in unison. Draco let the kiss fill his mind, till his own lips tingled from the memory. A white light began to form from his wand, and a glowing mass lurched out. They watched as the light took form, and Draco almost smiled as a large cat like shape pounced through the room. They both knew what it was.
Ginny locked eyes on Harmony considering her. "So you're sure about this." Ginny stated. And Harmony replied with a shy smile, revealing some of the elation she had felt since that morning. "Send me a postcard?" Ginny concluded.
"If you teach me then not even Dumbledore is to know." He nodded his head slowly. "Yes, then I want to learn."
A large eye peeked through a crack as the door shifted a smidgen. It gave fearful rapid blinks before disappearing and being replaced by a pallid hand that opened a croaking door for them. "Hurry in children," she encouraged weakly, as if afraid of overexposure out of the room could cause some kind of fatality. Students passed her with polite nods.
Harmony brought her knees to her chest and rested her head. What did any of them know? They hadn't been there. It was her fault. She had brought Sirius into that room, and she had been mental enough to kiss Draco. A bittersweet mistake. She licked her dry lips and laughed at how stupid she was. No one in their right mind would love her. No girl or guy. And if they did, they would die from it. It always happened because of her.
"Thanks Ron," Ron smiled, "but, I don't want to be a third wheel with you two. I'm very much fine by myself." She tried getting past his lanky leg, but he was a persistent wanker.
"I believe it is for the new Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher," Hermione replied, "and I believe that he is going to need to know some defense against the female population, or they are going to eat him alive."
"Harry, Voldemort only had the first part of the prophecy, the part that there would be a child born at the end of July to parents who faced and lived three times against him. He did not know there was danger by trying to kill you, that he would be transferring his power to you, or that you would have 'power that the Dark Lord knows not'."
"Well," she began when she noticed everyone's stares. A groaning noise escaped the door as she leaned on it. "I am glad to see that all of our students have survived the summer and had not died in horrible brutal fashions." Trelawny scratched her unkempt hair with a long slim finger. "Now I know that each of you had exciting dreams that you scribed into a journal for me to grade, which you all will hand in at the end of class. Hopefully they are all pleasant, with at least one nightmare, or hornet." She said as she swatted a bee away from her face, which flew and rested on a windowsill. Student's eyes began to dull, as brain cells were induced to self destruct.
"We're just supervising, sir," Ginny said as she eyed the professor. "You look different, more young."
"Draco," Harmony grabbed Draco's arm, "you should really go now." The dog snarled at Harmony for touching Draco. "Please."
"Er, I dunno, we found him like that." The potion started to activate in his system and he embraced the numbness that coursed through his veins. The endless blackness filled his mind and he allowed sleep to overcome his senses.
"Below the cellar," Draco whispered, with a hand on the kitchen door. It opened soundlessly, and while their eyes constricted from the light, Harmony noted that no one was there. They took a few steps, while Draco lead them, and looked at the disarray. It wasn't the Manor that Draco remembered, she could tell by the look from his face as he observed the ripped paintings and the cracked ceiling and walls. They passed rooms, and soon Draco lead them to a bolted door. With a sharp click, it reacted to his touch, and they walked in the narrow passage that sloped downwards.
"So what color do you like better, silver or blue?" Ginny held out two eye shadow containers, to which Harmony groaned in distress. "You're right, what was I thinking, purple is so much better."
This time water engulfed him. Surprise struck Draco, and his immediate response was to lash out, splashing madly. He wasn't prepared for this. The water was frigid and something was sucking him further into the current. A wave went over his head, and he closed his eyes from the salinity of the water. He wasn't a good swimmer, having hated beaches and open waters. In fact, he barely knew how to swim. He broke the surface, to breathe, but water gushed into his mouth. The saltiness burned his throat, and his legs thrashed in all directions. He couldn't touch the bottom with his feet and he tried to keep above the waves. A cold dread was eating away at his senses. What was happening? His robes were dragging him down, and he struggled to strip them off. His wand hid uselessly against his belt, forgotten. Fear was making him desperate. He couldn't breathe. His arms scooped through the water, blind with determination. Draco's pounding heart demanded oxygen, and his lungs filled up with icy water. The current swept him down into the dark water, in different directions. He couldn't see, and his limbs were turning numb, losing the fight against the water. His head miraculously broke the surface, and he couldn't see anyone near him. Before he could call for help, a wave swallowed him like a rag doll into the sea below. Draco thrust his arms in different directions. Oxygen! He needed air! This wasn't how he was supposed to die. His arms and legs were limp under the water. This wasn't right. His eyes opened, and through the murkiness he could see light. His lungs ached with pain, and his brain was beginning to go numb. No. This couldn't be happening. He allowed the ocean to carry him. He wanted to live. He closed his eyes, hollow lungs now filled with water. There was no air. He was dragged further under, and the pain ebbed slowly away.
"Now, I have noticed over the years that certain individuals, not to be named," he ground out deliberately looking from Harmony to Neville, "need extra help, to put it nicely. And partnering those special students in need with someone equally inept will not allow them to learn," he then saw the red hair of Ron which he much rather wished to burn off. "Partners will be based on those who require the most improvement with those class mates who show the proper mastery of potions. Other partners will be based on equal skill. If I hear any whining, you will get a zero for the day, if I see any nonsense, then expect to see me for detention."
Even though she couldn't see him, she knew that he was smiling. And then light slapped her eyes shut.
They were ugly looking, and there ugliness multiplied in their sheer numbers. One elf in particular seemed happy to see them, and Draco saw in surprise that it was Dobby his old house elf. "It's Harry Potter," Dobby said cheerfuly in a high pitch squeal, "who came to see Dob...by," his smile fell as he saw Draco Malfoy. "Uh, Dobby still hasn't finished taking out the trash. Thank you Harry, for the Christmas present." Dobby waved at Harry, and ducked into the sea of elves.
But even that wasn't enough. Next came the decision that Harmony should be shut away inside, so that the neighbors wouldn't make the connection between the girl in the house and the boy from years before. She became trapped before she even realized what was happening.
"No!" Harmony jolted in her armchair, her jaw moving before her exhausted brain could. "I was with..er..Dumbledore! Yeah." She whispered, happy with her answer.
"18th row, seven up," an elf squeaked, who Harmony assumed to be female because of the two inch eyelashes. Harmony counted 18 rows, feeling sorry, that more and more elves were waking up. She recognized him by the socks she had recently given to him for Christmas tucked on his feet, going up to the elve's knees. She touched Dobby's arm, and the elf's green tennis ball eyes opened. He looked confused at her.
"That's because I am young, and the main reason I choose to look older is a matter between the headmaster and myself." The scratch on Leighton's arm disappeared. "Am I wrong to presume that you two, Ginny and Luna, will be frequent visitors."
"Yeah, Harry was staying with his relatives and then with my family the entire summer," Ginny said as she swished her eyes from the two. Luna continued to read as if oblivious of the intruder.
"But you're still here and won't let that happen. Maybe it's better if things stay as they are. Who knows what war will bring. I could very well die." Draco looked in to her green eyes. "But I will destroy Voldemort first."
"Glad to see you alive," he retorted, "show me the bite." Draco cleared the remains of his robe and allowed the teacher to bring his wand close to the raw looking flesh. There were puncture wounds were teeth had broken skin and the putrid saliva dribbled from his ankle. The pain disappeared immediately and his foot appeared unscathed. Draco didn't thank him.
She trained her eyes away from the creatures who looked like death's mount as she boarded the carriage. She sat squished between Ron and Ginny and tried to listen to Ron and Hermione's conversation, a lot of times she needed distractions.
"Bella is the most idiotic muggle in existence. She married a bloody corpse, when she could have hooked up with Jacob; a powerful animagus wizard descended from the Ancient and Most Noble House of Black."
"Enough, Harmony," Snape said in what could have been a gentle yet firm tone. "Come here." Draco could not believe it as she got up and went to Snape. Even more disbelieving was that Snape touched her shoulder, and she leaned closer to him. "Draco," Snape ordered, "alert Madam Pomfrey." Draco looked taken aback at that, but he stopped his mouth from protesting. He left the room soundlessly, and briefly wondered if he would trust Harmony with anybody. What choice did he have? Harmony would only push him away. Draco could feel dejection eat at him from the inside, but he would have to bear it if he ever wanted to be with Harmony.
Nothing bad happened as they looked at each other, there were no crazy fathers, friends, or intruders. It was just them, and Harmony couldn't have enough of the drunk feeling as if punch had filled her to the point she was almost intoxicated. "So I didn't scare you away," Harmony kissed him and it took him a few seconds to actually answer.
Of all of the transporting devises possible, Harmony would never have expected the flying rectangle coming straight for her. It was unmistakably her professor, but she couldn't identity what she was on. It wasn't a broom, car, or portkey. Professor McGonagall made an abrupt landing in front of the Dursley's garden hedge, unfortunately situated in the view of the living room window. For the next few seconds the Dursley household sounded like the set for a under budgeted murder movie. Harmony covered her ears as Hedwig joined in with Dudley's cries of 'the sky is falling mummy'.
"Harry Potter!" Voldemort screeched in every students' minds, "Do not make me kill every child before reaching you!"
There was something off about this whole thing. She wouldn't leave without saying goodbye. It wasn't like her.
Ron began to sputter in reply, as he visibly tried to stop his face from grimacing in disgust. People around the table all found interesting things to stare at; their hands, teacups, a distant tree. Hermione was looking away and had her head in her hand.
"The Dar-," he stopped, "Vold-dem-mort is a creepy wanker. But I still want to help you. I can't have you prancing about to er- you know who, and be naive enough to think that a simple spell like Expelliarmus will work." Draco put his hands to Harmony's shoulders, shaking her a little. "Do you even know what you are doing?"
"Sirius!" she called, "Sirius!" Though she was alone in the bedroom, this was not the best place for her to freely converse with her very much still wanted God Father. So she draped the curtains that hung on her four poster bed and cast a silencing charm so that she could hear very little from outside her bed, and no one could hear anything that she would say. "Sirius!" she yelled out, with the mirror an inch from her face much like that of a telephone. She could hear the creak of a door, and the ceiling moved to a face whom she missed.
"A telly," she supplied, "it's a main source of- er- muggle entertainment." He frowned as he scrutinized the blank screen, and couldn't imagine how it was a source of entertainment. He heard a click, and the screen lit up, shocking him as an image of a car chase and things exploding played before him. He watched as a huge man ripped open a car door, carrying a woman in his arms and some kind of long shiny thing across his back.
"What am I going to do?" The ferret stuck his head out, facing her, "Voldemort is-" the ferret squeaked at the name, but covered it with a half convincing sneeze, "out there." It brushed its head against her hand, wanting to play. "Aren't you scared, whom do you belong to?" The ferret ignored her, as it tumbled around. "It must be nice being a ferret, and not having a care in the world." The ferret huffed in response before running off.
"Let's go get tea." Draco ordered, and the group headed towards Madame Puddifoot's Tea Shop, where Draco made sure that he got a seat next to Harmony.
Nothing more was said as they walked through the doorway of the house on Privet Drive. Uncle Vernon greeted Dudley and squinted at Harry. "Oh Dudley, brought home a cute girlfriend, hmm?" Harry almost laughed when Dud began to stutter incoherently. Aunt Petunia walked in from the kitchen wearing a pink stained apron and gasped at the girl in front of her.
"Open to page 378," he grumbled, "today we will begin to brew the sorcerer's revenge." Harmony wondered when they would begin to brew something useful, like a sleeping draught, or the sorcerer's paradise. Like she was ever going to use any of this. Harmony lifted her head from her book and began to turn the pages without so much of an inch of interest. "Does anyone know this spesific potion?" Snape ignored the raging hand known as Hermione, and Harmony smartly looked down at a speck of dust as so not to be called on. "No one?" Snape said. If anyone could be a flashing neon sign, Harmony bet that Hermione could do it. "It's a potion that when mixed with any potion, magnifies the adverse effects of that potion and does not stop till it is completely out of your system." Harmony wondered why any of them would need to know such a useless potion. "Alright," Snape barked, "begin." In no way was what Snape doing even considered teaching. Harmony glared at her book as Draco read the ingredients that they needed.
The Dursleys had not been pleased when she had shown up a month early, announcing that she had no plans to return to school. It wouldn't have mattered to them if she had defeated twenty Dark Wizards. It turns out that the level of tolerance that they could show her for a day, didn't hold for long as the weeks went on. Especially when the Durselys were faced with the prospect that Harmony might remain indefinitely, with no foreseeable way of getting rid of her.
It didn't matter to her as the girl's ears began to elongate like an elephants. "That suites you too, Parkinson." Pansy cried out in alarm, and shielded her growing ears from those around her.
He opened the large doors and made his entrance knowing more than one pair of eyes followed his movements. Gracefully sitting at his designated spot he gladly began his succulent turkey roast dinner. Finishing his meal off with a custard delectable, he returned to his room in the Slytherin House. Draco had gotten a letter from his father who was in need of a certain one of a kind dark arts book in the restricted section of the library. Due to his impending Prefect status (in other words due to the fact that he practically owned all of the current prefects- such was their desire to stay on Malfoy's good side), he knew that it was best to venture out at two in the morning, right after Professor Snape retired to his bed chamber.
"You disobeyed me, you abandoned your family, you left us at the mercy of the Dark Lord. Now your mother is gone. And you did it all for that girl." His father stated, quietly. Draco felt his body tense as he pushed his emotions away, remaining calm.
"Alright," Harmony said, and when Draco still did not move, she grabbed his arm and pushed him away. The other students were already out the door, and Harmony realized that she shouldn't be touching him, and dropped her hand. "The detentions are my lessons with Snape, and he wants you to join us."
"I just needed to talk with wonder boy here," His voice stressed over boy and she wondered what Malfoy really did know. "Till next year, and remember what I said about the glasses." He left after dropping the glasses onto her lap and giving her a quick wink.
Blaise looked like he wanted to say something to Draco, then thought better of it. "Send me an owl, if you get bored." Blaise said instead. Draco nodded him off, and waited alone, as the last of his housemates made their way to the train.
Harmony's face fell as she thought of telling them about underwear shopping with McGonagall. What could she tell them? "Oh you know, Dursleys. The usual."
Upon entering the classroom, she was glad to see that the majority of students in their seats were wearing the red and gold color scheme to their school uniform. She soon spotted Ron in a far left desk along the wall and plopped down beside him. "Hey Harry, I didn't catch you at breakfast."
"I see vegetables, rotting under the sun." Harmony watched Neville almost fall off his seat before looking up into the large brown eyes of her teacher.
"Very good," he said and tapped the wood of his desk methodically. "Do you two need a break, or do you want to quit."
Harmony glanced down at Draco's tattoo, tracing her finger down the image of the Hebridean Black, watching it move under her touch. "Brazil," Harmony replied, "and why not?"
"Shudup! Point that fing' away from me." With raising voices and chairs falling to the floor, the house would soon awaken. "I've nothing of yours."
"Goodnight," they said, and Harmony straightened up as best she could. She still felt a bit winded, and she didn't want to admit that she had been wrong to think that wrestling with Leighton had been a good idea. She only thought of him as a friend, but that didn't stop her from being a girl. Draco still looked upset as he threw on his coat, and went for the door.
"To be in shape," Draco said and looked at her from where he stirred, "didn't you do it too?" Harmony shrugged her shoulders.
Something was different about Harmony. She had dark circles under her eyes, and Draco could not rid of the guilt that Sirius's death was haunting her this much. She had clearly not forgiven him, and it made wooing her all the more challenging. The last thing he expected as their ignoring each other progressed was for her to slide him a folded note. He hid his smile between tight lips as he watched her from the corner of his eye, bent over an open book.
Draco shrugged his shoulders, "it suites me just fine." She sat on his bed, the only thing comfortable in the room. "Class is almost over, they will come soon," Draco said.
"Yes, Tom's," Ginny almost whispered, "in my fist year." Harmony's eyes widened as unseen memories played behind her eyes. Draco did not know what any of that meant, but he shivered as Harmony whispered Voldemort's name. Harmony put a hand to her scar and shut her eyes.
"Because if you need to, I can take it back." Draco wondered how Harmony had become so selfless. She must have gone through Hell, wearing that locket for a week. He took some comfort in knowing that wearing the locket was helping her.
Harmony forced a smile, reminding herself that it was better if they didn't know the truth. "Don't worry about me, I have everything under control." They still looked at her funny.
"Indeed," came a low mutter from Snape which he didn't realize was very much audible. He then proceeded to cough a bit and shuffle away.
Lucius Malfoy walked over to the rubbish bin and dropped Draco's designer jeans inside as if they were nothing. "Why are you still with her?" His father asked.
Her magic engulfed the spell, and she began to shake. You bastard, her mind screamed, I'm going to fucking kill you! The spell was only wearing off, and Harmony's hand shook as if there were weights holding her down. She pointed her wand at Malfoy senior.
"Nothing," she muttered and got on her broom. He followed her and they soared into the night. Usually as she flew she could forget about everything and just enjoy the sensation of flying, but not now. Not with her feelings for Draco making her thoughts hot and dreadful. She couldn't be with him, how could she? His teasing her didn't mean that he had any interest in her. Why would he have any feelings for her anyway? She could imagine him laughing if he ever discovered her tumult.
The windows of the Gryfindor tower were shattered in the fight, and Ginny flew around it twice before locating Harmony's room. She perched on the windowsill, silently taking in the sight of all of her things still there.
"It is a Horcrux," Leighton said, "and don't think that it is only your burden to bear." Harmony bit her bottom lip, and shrugged her shoulders. "It would be foolish to try to destroy it by yourself. There could be irrevocable damage."
"As you like," she said and pulled out her map. It was true that foot prints were heading into their direction.
"Blimey, Ron," George whistled, "people have free will. You should know by know that Ginny won't listen to you."
"I don't know, all it says is that the Dark Lord was seen by aurors and early morning Ministry staff to have broken into a restricted section of the Ministry of Magic. It doesn't say if anything was taken, but the Dark Lord wouldn't just make an appearance like that for no reason. Something doesn't add up!" Hermione shot her hand up for emphasis, but Harmony was more concentrated on the students who were beginning to get anxious.
"The poisons that are odorless, tasteless, and inconspicuous are the most treacherous," Draco said, still wanting to add that Leighton was raving bonkers to have a jar of that stuff in his cloak. It was certainly illegal.
"Peculiar that dementors would be out like that." He noted when it ended. The lines of his face sagged with age and weariness.
Ughh. A tiny part of her wanted to. A persuasive part that didn't always listen to reason. She wanted to know what was his problem. Why he had to mess her up at every possible moment.
The darkness spread as it devoured the lights that seeped through the windows. She broke out into a run when she felt the air plunge in degrees as her gasps turned frigid. She was close to the book store which was nearly at her flat. A darkness engulfed the narrow alleyway. A crack in the floor tripped her and she skidded over icy concrete. She didn't feel the pain as she saw the black cloak above her head reaching down for her with its gray rotting hands.
"Damn you," Draco said through clenched teeth. This was their professor's entire fault. The animals continued to cry out, and the low hissing hummed through the tall grass.
They passed three halls and several classrooms before Draco started to wonder their destination. "Where you are going?" he finally asked.
"Voldemort is calling you," Dumbledore nodded his head, as if he had expected it. "He is desperate. Going so far as to break into the Ministry of Magic."
"It's still unsafe to be out." Snape said, ending his censored mumbling. "I need to get Minerva, and Dumbledore will surely know by now".
"What's the matter?" Harmony asked loudly from the start of a new song. Draco had been heading for the door. Her sweetness twisted something inside of him. She was too innocent, and though he had hated that about her before, now it made him want to protect her. And that was completely idiotic.
"Not for long though, we have potions class with the Slytherins again this year, and Snape will really go mental. I almost feel sorry for him," Ron bubbled out.
"Well, is there anyone that he is close to and who knows?" Harmony thought for a moment, less than a handful of people knew.
"And why did you listen to him?" There was a silence. Harmony began to feel a strange heat all over her face and behind her eyes.
"Like she would be interested in you Gordon, I on the other hand bet I can get her." She could make out the golden blur of the snitch reflected in the dragon's eyes. She was flying closer now and saw the fire erupt from its mouth heading for her.
Once under the cover of the forest, a hawk flew over the trees following the ravaging fire that went straight into the mountains. She hoped beyond anything that Harmony wasn't lying somewhere in the dirt, charred black. When the trail of scorched trees ended, Ginny saw with her hawk eyes Lady Voldemort's corpse. She scanned the area, circling around, catching the glint of familiar round glasses.
"Come on." Faces blurred, blanched and nameless, as Harmony stopped at the door. She let go of the two girls and faced them with a small smile. The unmistakable howl of a werewolf was followed by four more calls, and Harmony knew that she had to act quick, before the doors locked.
"Yep, I heard that he goes down there sometimes to observe, but those are only rumors. The worst part is if you want to graduate, you have to take it." She shuddered and was glad that the curtain was in place. She hurried on putting as much distance away as possible from the door.
"I'll go with you," he said. They left the party and Draco walked next to her with an arm around her back when he felt that the corridors were cooler there. The portraits eyed them as they passed, and Draco didn't allow their disapproving looks to loosen his arm. He already had enough of that.
She was not worried when she didn't receive any letters from her school friends; they probably wanted to celebrate in person. She gratefully accepted a gift from Sirius and carefully unwrapped the crumpled up brown paper. Inside was a note which read Thank God you were born. She knew her mouth would hurt since she rarely smiled for such a long duration. It was one of the nicest things ever said to her. Underneath the parchment was an antique looking mirror which oddly didn't reflect her face.
When he opened the doors he greeted the brightly dressed people and rock music with grim silences. The walls were adorned with colored paper streaming from end to end, and the enchanted overhead sky was dark with a full moon and shooting stars. Girls were awkwardly dancing in poofy dresses with their house mates, and at the table with snacks. Professors littered the dance floor, in neon attire. Dumbledore in neon purple, McGonagall in neon orange, Sprout in neon green, Hagrid in neon blue, and Snape in neon black. Students continued to stream in, and some wore the most flamboyant things Draco had ever seen. His disinterest turned to boredom, and he was contemplating ditching the school event. That was until he saw Harmony. And the dancing began.
"Potter," he shouted, "Remove your presence from my door this instant, I do not want to hear another thing from you!" He heard a squeak much like that of an animal and strode for the door. He was beyond being nice. Severus was livid with pain. The door burst open and he could see the small figure of Harmony running away, and he gave a small pained smirk before shouting, "no running in the halls! 25 Points from GRYFFINDOR!" There was laughter in the air, behind him, like a tinkle of a bell.
He hadn't wanted Harmony to spend the winter vacation without him, but couldn't think of a way to sneak off with her. He would have to face his father sooner or later...
"Why?" She wondered out loud, mindful of the four snoring boys. She sat atop her bed, waiting for twelve. It had only been two short months but this room didn't have its same appeal. Her surroundings were familiar, yet altered in some way. Like meeting an old friend again to find that though the face was familiar the friendship was gone. Or maybe it was the noise. Harmony didn't recall the snores of her slumber mates being quite so magnified.
"You are all wrong," Leighton concluded, " though Luna would be the closest. An animal with a look so menacing, so misunderstood, that it was killed on sight, and is now believed to be extinct. Severus would be the Thylacine," after noticing their blank stares he added, "more commonly known as the Tasmanian Tiger."
"Perhaps you should have gotten a more skilled wizard to resurrect you." Voldeomrt looked at Severus with loathing. "Or maybe it is something more." Severus was mindful of the books as he moved across the room, in thought. "Something that cannot be foreseen."
"You're smashed," Draco yawned, "talk to me when you're sober. Potter would never look good in a dress."
"Oh, I was taking my time getting ready, anything happen?" Harmony asked as she placed her head against the fine wood of the desk.
"Oh, anything will stick to the rug when it is in air." Harmony sat cross legged behind her teacher and freed Hedwig from her cage.
Draco was no master tracker able to see all the vestiges left from students, but he had a way of finding Potter. He knew that Potter and his gang were at the end of the train, and Draco saw red. The Weasley family practically swamped the train, with their disgusting red hair.
Draco leaned back in his seat, nearly touching the wall. "You didn't answer either of my questions," he said. Even from the darkness of the room he could see how her cheeks ever so slightly heated with color. With his head titled back, his eyes were slits.
"Er. Excuse me for interrupting, but this is Magical Fitness, right?" she asked. The professor turned around and Harmony was surprised to see Madame Hooch, whistle in hand staring at her. She was unmistakable with the yellow eyes and silver hair.
"Nearly midnight," Draco said and stripped his leather gloves from warm fingers. He had not forgotten to spell them warm before he left. He heard a loud bang as Harmony slammed her locker. "Something the matter?" He put the rest of his things in his own locker before spelling it shut.
It was close to the end of the year, so few professors had assigned last minute essays. He had one Defense Against the Dark Arts assignment, involving magical sprouting creatures, that he much rather put off. Setting his wand to wake him up later, he closed his eyes for a nap.
"Either Medimento or Vulnera Sanentur," Luna said, "Both will work". Leighton waved his hand for her to perform the spell. Next he presented the bird who flitted in the cage to Ginny.
"It's my present to you," she punched his shoulder, "so make her happy." Ron gave a lopsided grin before hugging Harmony. Harmony smiled back and looked all around at the fine jewelry and charms. Her thoughts wandered to what she should get Draco, and knew that he could buy anything.
Twenty minutes later as they were standing in front of Harmony's vault at Gringotts, Draco looked at the fat pyramids of Galleons with his mouth literally hanging open.
"I'm not how I was before." Dudley suddenly said breaking the silence. Harry arched an eyebrow. "I mean I don't beat up the smaller kids."
"I can't believe this, Harry," Ron scowled, "don't expect me to tolerate him! I'm not going anywhere near you and Malfoy."
He deflected the first spell that she shot at him as if it were child's play. It crashed into the wall and books crumbled into ash. The gasping breaths from Sirius twisted her stomach and she shot a blast of magic without her wand. It hit Malfoy, knocking him backwards into the door frame. In the corner of her eye, she could see Sirius staggering to his feet. She had never seen so much blood on a man before, and it scared her. Half of Sirius's face looked like raw meat, and blood continued to seep from a wound at his chest. "Sirius!" Harmony cried, "don't move." She took a step to him and something immobilized her body. She stood fixed with the same expression of shock and sickness that the spell had rooted her in when it hit her.
They went through stairwells and hanging portraits that stared at them as they walked. She heard a low pounding of beats, a rhythm coming from two steal doors. She concentrated on the quickening notes, she couldn't identify the melody, but it was soft and whimsical. She closed her eyes and smiled. "I did not know they offered music," she whispered, as to not to disturb the crescendo of trumpets and flutes that fluttered like butterflies to her ears.
Yet it was due to his bad press, and the fear that the Prophet would do some digging and uncover unfortunate truths that Harmony had her own issues to prepare for the day.
"Alright," Ginny said. They all said good night. When Draco left Ginny turned to her. "It's hilarious that he's trying to be your knight in shining armour."
"Sorry, Sir!" Harmony shouted back, before realizing her mistake. There was a muffled yelling, and the ferret bounced in her arms. When she ran far enough, she leaned against the wall, huffing, and slowly brought her bum down.
"I don't want to talk right now," she said and felt the locket pressed on the inside of her shirt. "Sorry." But she didn't feel sorry. In fact, she welcomed a foreign thought that they weren't her friends.
"Ron, stop it," Harmony glared at him, "it's none of your business who I become friends with." That didn't seem to settle well with him.
Draco made his way to a far corner and sat down glaring at the wall. After the first minute which he was cursing profusely under his breath, Draco attempted to find his happiest thought and found out that he was failing miserably to do so. He half heatedly pictured winning the quidditch tournament, but realized that he never had done so. Next he tried the joy of catching the snitch and frowned once again. He needed something bigger. His family would have been the ideal choice, except that his recent dispute with his father did not help. He knew he was just stalling about thinking about Harmony, because his happiest memory had been kissing her. But when Draco did think of that, the dream came back to haunt him. The harder he he focused on the memory, the worse the image of Leighton and Harmony played before him. Draco growled in frustration when he could no longer bear it. He felt hurt, as if Leighton had defeated him in his own mind.
A small fear settled in him, that he would lose her. And the fact that he had that small fear was more frightening to him. What was happening to him? It was Bloody Potter. He couldn't just forget that. Why should he care to see her with other guys? It was idiotic. Incredulous. He was only annoyed because he had a mission and couldn't afford others to steal her away. But as he witnessed that someone had managed to sneak her to the dance floor, he was livid. It was a cold fury that made him step closer. No one had the right to touch her. He was nearly ready to pounce between the two, but stopped as he recognized the man. It was Professor Kingscross, masquerading as a student. And Draco backed off. He detested the other man's well built form, his height, his overwhelming power. And even Draco could admit that he was dishy. But what made him frustrated was that Harmony looked comfortable and delighted to be with him. They looked good together, like a couple.
Harmony felt a quick tug on her shoulder push her away from the door, and where her head had been last, a jar shattered.
He took a quick step back, to gather himself and check to see that everything about him was dishy and enticing. It was. Without a second thought, Draco slid open the door, and meet the green behind the spectacles. The intrusion set off an uncomfortably silence as Harmony's friends gaped at him.
"He should be fine, the spell gradually wears off, and Poppy took out enough numbing potions to take down three bumbling muggles."
"You look a bit different Harry." Ron piped out. Harry's eye almost twitched, but he forced a smile.
Draco reread the letter once more before crumpling it in to a fist and bursting it to flames. "My mother, will she be ok?" Draco asked.
"Now if there happens to be a mace hurling at your head, you can't spend the time thinking about a spell name, or take the time to say that spell name. If you did, then you would never even need to use that pretty little head again." Leighton covered his mace with loving care before replacing it with a sledge hammer. "If you want a class that involves only the use of text books, then go to a muggle school, because this is a class where you will learn to survive in a world where wizards won't always stand against each other and take turns aiming and firing. Many wizards will fight dirty." Leighton took a few steps to a now vacated desk. "Your wand may not always be with you, and they will use that against you."
"You freak of nature," Vernon deduced. Some things will forever remain. Dudley stared about unsure, but the fumes from the kitchen tantalized his hunger and he left unnoticed.
"Keep hanging with me, and you'll soon lose your prefects badge." She said as the students passed. They walked side by side through the halls.
"Shortly before the time of your birth there was a prophecy made, and only I know its full contents. Voldemort found out about it, but not all of it. He wanted to kill you before you were to become a great threat. I am certain that he desperately wants the entire prophecy, and that is why it will be hard to tell your friends. He wants the knowledge of how to defeat you. I believe that you are ready to hear it now. In a room above the bar of the Hog's Head Inn I was seeing an applicant for the post of Divination." He took out his pensieve and with his wand withdrew his memory into the basin, instead of going into the memory, he tapped it with his wand and the figure of Sybill Trelawney emerged.
"Tell me what happened," Snape asked, and Draco did. The only thing that he left out was the kiss that Harmony and he had shared. It was maddening to think that simple kiss had started it all. And as much as it had damned him, it was worth more than he could have ever imagined. He had waited for that moment, when he knew with an absolute certainty that she would not have pushed him away. He had watched her innocent blushes, and had controlled himself. Till that very night when he could see her longing there and wanted to brush away all of her doubts and insecurities. Draco wanted to laugh at himself. He had been a fool, who had lost it all.
"Hurry it up Harmony, if anyone where to see you, they would laugh. Just trust me." Harmony removed her head from the wall, and realized that if any student had come by, they would have seen her bum in the air, and her head plastered into the floor. Harmony checked for students before her caracal form squeezed into the dirt tunnel, scraping her underbelly into plant roots and pebbles. When she made it through, she was amazed at how big the floor was spaced. And there was Draco, siting casually on a Victorian love seat.
"In a dream, I saw it," the torches flickered a misty gray as they passed. It was Peter Pettigrew who was locked up the last time she was there, she didn't want to imagine the students or Narcissa in a similar state. They rushed forward, till the main hall underground opened and leveled out. The ceiling extended to a dome shape and an oculus streamed in light from above. "I don't hear anything," Harmony whispered. They stopped, and Harmony stepped closer, trying to see if there was anyone behind the enclosed cells.
"Do not be so liberal with your words, Draco. Do you want to harm your family even more?" Draco looked anywhere but at his Professor who sat hunched on his desk like a vulture.
"Legillimens," Draco said and dove into her mind. It was as if all of her emotions were like an open book, that Draco could flip through. All he had to do was know where to look. He wanted to know what she thought of him. As he dug for that, he noticed that some of her memories slipped from his grasp, and he almost had to force his way into the heart of them. Draco saw a memory of Harmony and him played before him. He watched as she, as Harry Potter, watched him in potions class. She was sitting near him, and the Draco that was next to her had his finger on the book, and telling her instructions which she wasn't listening to. It was like looking at himself from a photograph, as if certain things that she liked, she stared longer at. He could feel the emotion coming off of her, this was a peaceful memory, and soon it dissolved from around him, either from it ending or from Harmony forcing him away. He hadn't known that she stared at him during potions. He had only thought that she was in her own little la la land, but he smiled now. It seemed like Harmony was trying to push his mind away, faintly like a huff of annoyed breath.
"Really? Where?" Harmony followed him to the back of the room where there were stalls to wash. "Huh, when did these get here?" There was a flimsy moth ridden curtain that had to do, and Harmony thanked him. She retrieved her school robes and Draco handed her his towel.
At the great hall, the Slytherin's brought their celebration with them. The hall was decorated with green and the Slytherins sneered the entire time. They gloated at their victory and laughed at the Ravenclaws and at any house who dared watch them. Harmony rolled her eyes when she saw that, but she had to be there to talk to Draco. He was sitting among them, but did not join in on the jeering.
He sat on that cold floor, and a cold understanding settled within him. It was his own trap he fell for. He opened his eyes, and directly across from him was a hole in the wall. Even though the castle was geriatric like a decrepit old dotard, it normally didn't have random holes. Any other time he would have missed it, but it wasn't so small, it was about the size of his head. He bent down getting closer. There was a strange light coming from inside. As he brought his body close to the floor, the hole began to get bigger till he could squeeze inside. Draco could see well enough and there was enough room for him to crawl as the path turned. It was strange though that he couldn't see so well beyond a few feet. But he was excited to find out where it ended. At last it came to an end. The room was red and grey, and too dark to really see. Lumos Draco said, but it came out as a squeak. He began to get frantic. He couldn't find his wand, in fact, he couldn't find his fingers! He scampered in a small circle, and discovered with concern that he had grown a tail, and had gotten very very hairy. He squeaked again, trying to call for help. He recognized this feeling. It was like when that crazed professor, Mad Eye, had turned him into a ferret. Draco stopped his body. It couldn't be. He whimpered, and fumbled in the dark.
The late summer air spilled through the high windows, bringing with it orange and golden rays. Soft foot steps padded the stone floor making little insects scamper about. Harmony slinked through the halls, not wanting to be seen. She kept her wand out, preferring to feel the reassuring touch of wood. The door she wanted to pass through appeared benign, but she could never tell. With one last second she glanced the halls for students before turning the doorknob and pushing it with enough momentum to swing her in. No one was there.
"Sly," she said softly, "I like it." He was tempted to reach out and touch her, to feel her soft unruly hair. Her eyes widened as if she had read his thoughts, and she stepped back. "I, er." Harmony stumbled through her words and Draco leaned against the wall once more. "Congrats," she said at last. Draco smirked down at her.
"No," Blaise got out, "I just think that you've been hanging out with them too much," he waved his hand where the Gryffindors were. "You need someone who thinks like you." The boy tapped the dark skin of his forehead and smirked.
"What are you talking about?" he asked, "I think your making stuff up in your head." Then why are you holding my hand? She wanted to yell into the night. Maybe she was driving herself mental.
She hadn't heard a student pass for awhile, and Harmony unlocked her room, to poke her head out. There wasn't a single Gryffindor in sight, and Harmony went as fast as her high heeled legs could go. She made it to the portrait and went through with relief.
"Oh dear, honestly both of you act like such children," Minervra uttered. Sirius wagged his tail and repeatedly whacked an angry Snape on the head and leapt away before Snape could curse something precious off. Snape shot up and immediately went for his wand, but was thwarted by McGonagall. He looked sour for the rest of the night.
Voldemort was silent as he digested what Severus said, "So my body is not complete, not without my Horcruxes."
This was her victory, but Harmony didn't have the heart to put on her mask anymore. She flew to her window, collected her meager girl belongings and left everything Harry related how it was. With one last look she threw the invisibility cloak over her head and mounted her firebolt. The beginnings of cheers could be heard through the castle as the last of the Death Eaters left, and Harmony shut it all out. She took off, knowing that she was leaving everything behind. She was done. Harry Potter would never be seen in the wizarding world again.
A faint sob traveled to Harmony as she saw a group of stricken Ravenclaw girls huddled together. They were coming from Leighton's classroom. She glimpsed again at her schedule at frowned at how many classes the Slytherins and Gryffindors shared. Everything about the two houses polarized. Dumbledore must be taking the sorting hat song to heart, or else he's just a sadistic dotard.
It didn't help that he was curious as well. It was all treasure to him, something that was a part of Harmony that he now knew. The first memory he caught was a very ugly fat man with a purple face spitting at a younger boy looking Potter. Draco passed up that memory quickly and turned to her thoughts. 'I can't' he picked up, "I hope he doesn't see'. This made Draco even more curious, but something in the way her thoughts were scared made Draco pull away. He left with a small thought of his own. 'You have to really want me out' Draco told her. Harmony gasped as Draco left her thoughts. She didn't look at him as she tried to catch her breath. Draco felt awful for intruding into her thoughts.
Draco turned his head and watched the other students. The Slytherins and Gryffindors were spread out through the room, and he saw that most of the lot had constipated looks. "Professor,"
After breakfast, Draco found himself once again outside the door to the hospital wing, repeating to himself over and over that it was to see if he could learn Potter's weakness. He was unable to hear any of Dumbledore's solemn tale, but he could certainly hear Potter boy.
At the Great Hall, Draco sat away from the few Slytherins who ate breakfast. He supposed that many of them had hangovers from last night. He could see Harmony from where he sat with Ginny, eating vanilla pudding by the mouth fulls. No one would suspect that their boy wonder was dating him. It made Draco chuckle to himself, except when Blaise strode in the Great Hall and sat next to him.
Alone again, Draco fisted the robes where Harmony had gripped not five minutes ago. Draco hit the green padded seat with the bottom of his fist. How could she? He had poured out his heart only for her to trample on. He hadn't done anything wrong.
The perfect scene was cut short as Draco jumped into the water. Blaise had a moment of apprehension as he realized that Draco was a lot more possessive than he had given him credit for. Possibly enough for him to hex somebody.
He could remember the plan that Dumbledore had outlined for him. And you will tell him. Dumbledore's words repeated through his head. But when Severus opened his mouth, nothing came out. Something was stopping him, a whisper in his ear, so faint, but it wrenched his heart from saying what he had been instructed to. Severus. It was a voice which haunted him, so small and soft. And he knew that he could not tell the Dark Lord that Harmony had turned into a girl. "Severus?" screeched in his ear, draining him.
"It will be late at night and no one will see it," Harmony muttered, not wanting the horrid smelling stuff near her fingers.
It was easy to slip out from the front without being noticed and she felt the reassuring presence of her wand inside of her pocket. When she got to the park's entrance she was glad to note that there were no children. Behind the grassy field she saw a cluster of lilac trees and she made her way to hide from the sun's glare. She gracelessly plopped down onto the soft grass and enjoyed the fresh earthly scent. She briefly wondered how her friends were faring before as she shut her eyes, thinking.
"Allow me." Harmony stood still as Draco stepped around her. She met his gaze and calm smile. He changed their course and she stared at his back. She reached for him, he was so close. Her body reacted, and with a sinking certainty that was in her heated face she knew that she was falling for Draco Malfoy. Shite. This was not supposed to happen.
She disappeared into the train, and Draco whispered a good bye to her. It would be a terrible week alone. A week stuck with himself. He unraveled the socks, and couldn't help but think that she really hated him. And though he ought to have been offended, he was incredulously thankful. In fact, he began to chuckle, for he realized that the socks were what she used to wrap the gift. Hiding in one large sock was a small ring, and as he put it on, colors swarmed around the band like ink. Dark colors that twisted around his finger.
"Easy. Wandless magic. It's all about taking the focus away from the wand and using the mind's power, the mind's memory as a means to control magic. In this case it is superimposing the image in your mind onto your face. A strong intent of concealing and protecting your face is also mandatory. Now you try." Harmony closed her eyes and her mind filled with Harry Potter, the planes of his cheeks, the glasses… she had grown up with that face, the many facets of Harry Potter all of the misery, the loneliness, the pressure, and the boyish fun. A headache began to form and her face shot up in heat. It was too much to picture, and yet so familiar.
"That was strange," she mumbled under her breath. Good thing her back had been to him, but otherwise, maybe now he would learn to keep out of her way. Madam Hooch blew her whistle and Harmony joined the crowd of girls and stood next to Ginny.
"I don't care what I said, never do that," Draco took a few moments to regain his footing, oh his poor beautiful face. "You guys know any good hexes that look really bad and don't hurt, but take a couple of days to heal?" They started at him blankly and he signed.
"There is a way to complete Voldemort," Dumbledore slipped the ring on his finger, on the charred hand which poison was slowly killing him, "and maybe even a way to regain his humanity." Severus looked at the headmaster, wondering if with greatness came madness. Not like there was a difference anymore. He felt the throbbing at his own hand, like that too was a poison slowly taking away his life.
Ron looked confused. Clearly he was expecting a different reaction. Or perhaps he had simply hurt his mind trying to come up with a reason why someone would want to date a Malfoy. "No. It isn't." Ron retorted.
Leighton's mouth remained closed, and as he tilted his head, a shadow covered his eyes. "It's something that should never exist. It will grant you immortality, but it will also seal your damnation."
"I don't know…start over today maybe," Draco stuffed his hands in his pockets, keeping his gaze set on the girl that looked like Potter.
Draco saw from above the girl's shoulder, Harry Potter making his way towards them. "Is Harry here now?" she asked and Draco pointed to the boy.
"You're being awfly nice, considering that you're wearing the locket" Harmony remarked and Draco sat on the bench that divided the lockers.
"Hmm," Harmony shrugged her shoulders, "I suppose." But Harmony didn't want to be persuaded into something she didn't want to do. It didn't matter if someone wanted her to go to the dance, she'd go if she needed to sort out what Draco meant to her.
"He doesn't gain anything by telling, plus he told me that he already knows, so if it does go out, he'd know that I would go after him first."
"Keep that on you at all times," he said, "since I am to be watching out for you." He pulled out his own mirror from his robes, and placed it on a cabinet near them.
In her excitement she had stood up and caught herself smiling. She was the only Gryffindor up, and realized the attention that she was drawing to herself. Others looked at her solemnly, as if she was some kind of traitor. "I should go," Harmony said, and waved at Ginny and Luna. They did think that she was his girlfriend and Harmony grinned as Ron shot her a glare. It didn't matter to her what they thought. She could cheer Draco's name if she wanted. They weren't really her friends anyway. Ron was a sorry git, and he could piss off if he wanted to. She left the stands and didn't stay to watch Draco circling the stadium with the snitch in his hand.
"Hello lovely ladies." Someone's voice had penetrated her sanctuary. Harmony's eyebrow twitched. I will not think about the owner of that voice, I will not acknowledge him. Will not…will not.
Reality slowly returned. Draco did not feel excited about his upcoming match with the Hufflepuffs. Not when he no longer had a team to watch his back. Plus, the Hufflepuffs were so easy without Cedric. Cho Chang was hardly any competition either. Would catching the snitch even impress her? He doubted it. Draco touched the ground with his foot and dismounted. He followed his white foot prints back to Hogwarts.
"Not many would have done the same, and Leighton, you have done this world a great favor. How old are you?"
Pansy strode to the front of the class with a smirk. Harmony could see the wand point sticking from the girl's sleeve. Pansy said, "Furnunculus," and a jet of gray shot towards her. Harmony slashed the air with her hand and the curse circled back, slapping Pansy in the face. The girl put a hand to her cheek in shock as boils began to erupt over her features and down her neck.
She watched as Voldemort picked the slender wand from Dumbledore's limp grasp, and lifted it curiously over his head. "At last," he yelled. Theodore Nott stood at the back, where Crabe and Goyle held the slumbering kidnapped students. Fenrir Greyback lay on the ground, a puddle of blood outlining his body. "Dumbledore is dead!" Voldemort laughed. "Nyeah eh hey!"
"Like a fool, he did," Severus laughed a humorless laugh, and Voldemort too showed his crooked teeth, in what could only be guessed was a smile. "You do not have to fear, my lord. He came to me, the poison concentrated in his hand, and I made sure that he would die within the year." And Voldemort laughed, a sound like a sword skewering a boar.
"It's alright, neither of you meant it in a bad way. Our heads are just in the gutter, where the gnomes are." Luna said.
When Harmony returned to the room, Draco hadn't realized that she sat next to him or that he was glued to the screen. His eyes widened as the show went on and after a few moments he noticed that the laughter wasn't coming from the telly. "What's so funny?" he asked, not even turning to her.
"Draco Malfoy, what is the matter with you?" Professor Snape asked but Draco couldn't tell if it was the Snape on his right or the Snape on his left that asked. His response though was to vomit all over Goyle who looked positively disgusted. He heard Snape ordering Crabbe to carry him, and Goyle was dismissed to everyone's relief.
"A moment Malfoy," Severus said, stopping them both. Harmony left the room, but stood close to the door trying to hear.
Draco looked down at his hands, and the words settled with a pang of affliction. His father had killed Harmony's father, and he had done nothing. He could not meet her eyes, without knowing that he had caused part of that sorrow. "I didn't know," he said quickly, as if to convince her that it wasn't his fault. He didn't know that Sirius Black was somebody dear to her, and he had not known what to do. "I'm sorry." Draco could see the marks of tears drip down her face, and he dared not wipe them away.
"It's nothing," she said, "just the cold." Without saying anything he reached for her palms, and slipped his fingers between hers. She looked down at their intertwined fingers and then at his smirk.
"You got the hots for Potter. If I didn't know better, I'd think the same as well. But you're not a poof, Draco. I can't exactly figure it out, but I know when somethings up."
"Harmony, it still would be beneficial to have someone teaching you the basic female etiquette as you undergo something so drastic. The later transition when everyone is ready to know the truth will help you fit more into that role." Harry knew that Dumbledore was a master at strategies for a reason, he had every step planned.
Ginny mulled this over, considering the fact that it was Ron who had charged into Harry's room, before anyone would have had time to hide certain things. She knew how squeamish her brother was around undergarments. If he had found anything he certainly would have caused a scene.
Harmony really looked out the window then, and spotted him. She regarded him steadily, pushed her window open wider and motioned him on in. Draco pressed himself flat against his broom and flew straight through the window, into Harmony's tiny room. His dismount was shakier than his usually elegant style, and he took a moment to collect himself before turning to face her.
Later that day, after the sun had gone down, Ginny stared at the impatient face of her friend in the mirror that reflected them both. She was carefully applying a second layer of mascara to Harmony's eye lashes, bringing out the vibrant green. She stepped back to enjoy her handiwork. Harmony was a gorgeous girl already, just a touch of eye shadow, and a hint of blush made an impact. Like always, Ginny enjoyed getting Harmony ready more than she cared for her own preparations. She looked at the mirror critically-Harmony was just about perfect, she just needed...
"You need to learn patience," Ginny huffed at him, "do you honestly think that Harmony will be happy if you storm in there?"
"She looked so beautiful-" Ron got smacked by a blushing Hermione. "And I went right up to her," he continued, still holding her hand, "And asked for a dance. I tore apart each of her suitors too. Hermione was so impressed by me, that she could not get enough of the handsome Ro-" she smacked him once more. "And then I took her to the balcony, and we were all over ea-"
"Er, what?" she asked and really looked at him. He gave her the dashing smile that he knew could win any girl. He reached for her hand and even though she dressed like Potter, she couldn't hide the subtle details that everybody but him would have overlooked.
Maybe that's why she started to hang out more with Draco, since most of them didn't want to go against him. No, that wasn't the only reason. She was more calm and had more fun with him. It didn't matter how cold it was, they flew on their brooms at night when the sky was white and the snow fluttered around them. Sometimes they would practice legillimens without warning, and Harmony put up her barriers as patch worked and flimsy as they were. He made her smile even after a hex left her limping and bruised. During class was the best time to escape.
"Ron," Harmony said with a flare of anger, "piss off." Hermione grabbed Ron's hand and began to push him back. She whispered something in his ear and looked at them with an apologetic look.
"I will master it, and thank you professor." She would not learn it out of fear, or to gain power. She didn't want to be messed with anymore.
"Yes, now what brings you here?" Many of the students stopped to watch her talk with their professor.
"Fine," Harry replied "except for the fact that I'm here, though I don't know why." Harry felt fear envelope his mind as he pictured all of the possibilities for his pain. If Dumbledore was there then it must be Voldemort related. Harry shivered as he thought of how Voldemort violated him by taking his blood in the graveyard. "Tell me, is there something wrong with me."
Draco would have to definitely go for blackmail, somehow get Potter's attention and then make him do humiliating things. He would then beat him fairly, or as fair as possible. Yes then after his fun, when the boy-who-would-soon-be-a-girl would be all emotionally disturbed and vulnerable, he would trick her into the Dark Lords hands. Draco smiled; his life was absolutely perfect, excluding of course the untimely plague. Maybe he wouldn't send Theodore to his grave, at least not permanently.
"At the count of three then. One. Two. Three." The two girls grabbed the rusty watering can at the same time. Ginny felt the jerk under her navel, which always made her think that she had been caught by a fishing pole and yanked far away, with the world spinning around her.
"The loo," Harmony replied while giving a coerced half grin. Of course she couldn't say exactly why she had been in there, not for the reason that it was inappropriate dinner conversation but because she was in there for her period. It had been an unwelcome surprise three days back when she found the blood once again. She couldn't believe that girls had this every month, it was the worst punishment she could think of. She had cramps now and the onset of a headache was beginning to form at the top of her head. It was almost intolerable. "What was the song about this time?"
When he awoke, he was determined to not let the locket get the best of him. He had more important things to worry about.
Harmony placed her hands on Draco's in an effort to hoist him up. "Come on," she said, "you guys promised that you would show me around. I heard the kitchens have millions of elves!" Harmony grinned when Draco got his stuff and she looked at Blaise next.
"Unfortunately I cannot leave the flat without Snivellus stepping on my tail, so I may have to bum around here."
"Yes, thank you dear, of course." Madame Pomfrey said, even more suspicious at the gentle manner with which Malfoy placed Harry Potter on a hospital bed. And the sudden manner by which he left. Draco's plans of spying were forgotten for now. What in the world was he doing, voluntarily touching Potter?
"Begin," Snape said, with nothing more to direct them. Ron waved his wand ferociously, and it was an easy matter to put up a shield. She waited for the magic to hit her shield, but nothing came from Ron's end. She could see how pleased Snape looked as the man lifted an eyebrow. "I said begin." Ron waved his wand once more to no avail. "If you must say the spell, than whisper it to yourself." There were a few snickers in the class while Ron did so, turning red. Harmony put up her shield once more, nonverbally. His spell was sent back, powerfully enough to break through his defenses, knocking him down and Ron fell on his bottom.
Blaise didn't need any more encouragement. He leaned down to kiss her, and Ginny felt as his hands wrapped around her waist, liking the way his lips moved against hers.
"Interesting methods to enable foresight," Trelawny dubiously said with a sniff, "do you perchance see anything?"
"I heard that you are some boxing champ, must have gotten a lot of practice." Dudley nodded his head fiercely. "A big step from the elementary kids and local children punching bags."
She wasn't going to say out right that Draco was on her mind, so instead she stuffed a huge piece of toast in her mouth, "Like voldemort," she said after a few seconds of chewing.
A cool glass touched Draco's arm, startling him out of his thoughts. "Cheer up mate." Blaise stated and handed him a glass. Draco took a sip of it, tasting through the cloying sweetness.
"I just keep wishing that things were different." It was the opposite for her, now that she had accepted Sirius's death. "The locket, it's telling me that I could never be someone you'd fall for. 'Give up' it says 'she's going to be dead anyway'. But..." Draco shook his head.
"Harry?" Harry turned to find that Hermione and Ron had snuck up on him, and immediately he wiped his eyes. No way would they find out that he was somehow a girl. "Are you alright?" Of course not, he was blatantly in there for a reason.
She said goodbye to Ron and Hermione and promised to keep in touch. They said that she could visit the Burrow and Hermione kissed her check sending Ron sputtering. She hugged Mrs. Weasley on the other side of the barrier and saw Uncle Vernon looking nastily along.
Memories of the two of them flicked through his mind; Harmony in a sleek silver dress smiling up at him, Harmony holding his hand on the way to tea, Harmony launching herself at the Dark Lord, protecting him. He had to say something.
"Thanks for covering me." Harry hadn't even known that Dudley knew that word since he never used it before on anyone with sincerity. Harry nodded and wondered that maybe Dudley felt scared that she would get her revenge on him later.
