“No,” Harry laughs, “it’s really not that scary, I promise. Just a bit gory. I mean, it’s kind of funny, actually.”
“Why are you here?” Draco snapped, whipping around to glare at Pansy. He saw her lips tighten. “I’ll meet you down at breakfast.”
been helpless to abstain from what Ron called his saving-people-thing and Hermione had rather clinically diagnosed a hero complex, something that never failed to irk Harry greatly.
Harry's earnest face, the pain in his eyes, it breaks Draco's heart. It isn't him, that's the thing. It could never be him.
to himself before term had even started that he wouldn’t get into fights with Malfoy this year — the blond was managing to rile him up in one way or another. “And
Like the war, Harry supposed this was something he needed to move on from. And he would, in time. Just as he knew that, in time,
“While Sirius was in Azkaban, you mean?” he asked, coming towards the desk where Harry had just pulled it away from the wall, opening up space on the other side for another chair.
And so maybe he was a little ruder to Potter than usual when he was forced to interact with him, but really, could he be blamed? It was Potter’s own fault.
But Harry decided not to say it. Because what was ‘virginity,’ after all, other than the first time one had sex? It didn’t mean anything. And he wanted this, it was all he fucking wanted after
"You have to relax," he whispered. Malfoy took in an unsteady breath and let it back out, eyes fixed on Harry's. He felt his muscles loosen, and Harry pressed the very tip of his middle finger inside. Malfoy's eyes closed and his head fell back against the wall. His cheek was so close to the window that Harry could see the heat of it fog up the glass, along with his quietly panting breaths. He gently eased it the rest of the way in, watching Malfoy's face, and stopping only when his knuckles were pressed against his arse. He slid his other hand under Malfoy's leg and lifted it onto his shoulder, giving him a better angle and making Malfoy blush.
“Sometimes,” Draco said shortly. He gave her nothing else, and it was worth the satisfaction of watching her squirm. A moment passed, and with a put-upon sigh she came over to the bed and sat down, leaving a fair amount of space between them.
parlour of all things, on a spontaneous trip they'd taken when they both had the weekend off. This had been extremely early on in the relationship, when everything was new still and they were obsessed with each other, unable to get tired of it, fucking constantly and not fighting at all. He'd been drunk on Harry's wildly intense passion, on the feeling of being in love, and he'd wanted to absorb that into himself somehow, mark himself with it, make it so there was a part of Harry etched onto his body.
And then he remembered in a terrible flash of clarity: Theo’s father was receiving the Kiss on the first of February.
Kenny’s friends were turning him over, for he’d landed on his front, and there was blood dripping out of his nose where it had presumably smashed into the floor.
, his idol, had been the one to destroy something which had existed in their family for more than a thousand years. This, Draco expected, was one of the things Azkaban’s Dementors would make it impossible for his father to forget, day in and out.
Draco picked up one of his shoes and chucked it at Harry, who didn't stop laughing even when it hit him in the cheek.
"Oh, one of these days I won't let you take this baby home," Mrs Weasley said, lifting Leo's head while he sucked on the bottle to press a kiss to his forehead. "Ron, you were never this easy."
without sex being involved? You two were at each other’s throats for six years, Potter. The whole fucking school knows it.” Theo gestured around the entrance hall with his wand, where a slow stream of students who’d finished dinner were now forming into a veritable crowd. “People who hate one another the way you and Draco did don’t suddenly become
When he lost to Ron for the second time ("It's good for you, Malfoy," Ron told him, "same as it's good for Hermione") he declared himself thoroughly finished, at which point Hermione — with a very coy grin that nearly made Harry burst into laughter — dragged Ron upstairs to the boys' dormitories. Every other eighth-year had elected to go home for the holidays, leaving the common room utterly empty.
Feeling sick, he used a spell he’d learned more than a year ago which removed bloodstains. Not knowing what else to do, he cleaned himself off with another charm, bundled up a bunch of toilet paper, and stuffed it inside his clean knickers. As he was doing his pants back up he heard the bathroom door creak open and froze with his fingers on the zip.
Malfoy nodded stiltedly, arms tightening across his chest, looking suddenly uncomfortable again and utterly unsure of himself, something that, to Harry, was intriguing to witness on somebody who had always, as long as he'd known him, been the very height of arrogance.
Now Draco actually does scoff, and his eyes flash in that way that’s always gotten Harry’s blood boiling. And then it’s always fight or fuck from that point. Tonight will be the former, because that’s all it can be.
Harry heaved a sigh and removed his hand from Malfoy’s back, using the pad of his thumb to drag down that bitten lower lip he’d been so focused on all night. Malfoy nipped lightly at the tip, bringing a fond smile to Harry’s face.
This was too much for Harry, and it was all he needed to know for sure he'd been right. A rage so fierce that it made his blood seem to boil beneath his skin overcame him within seconds; he barely even heard Hermione’s quiet, terrified squeak behind him before he was grabbing his wand from his pocket and pointing it at Kenny’s back.
He pulled reluctantly out of Harry’s embrace and went to his dresser, where he started pulling out clothes and a clean pair of robes. He could feel Harry’s gaze on him as they both dressed, and found, to his surprise, that changing in front of him was comfortingly domestic.
“I’m not upset!” Draco said shrilly, spinning on the spot with his blouse still in his hands, cheeks burning a hectic red. “
“No,” he said quietly, voice wet and miserable. The admission made his heart twist painfully. “And I’ll never be able to find out for sure … by the time they let us visit him, he wouldn’t even recognise me in my
, Harry," says Draco softly. If there's a note of pleading on his face, in his voice, he only hopes Harry doesn't notice it. "D'you really believe we can keep nipping it in the bud every time?"
who rushed me off to Madam Pomfrey like the big, glorious saviour of the world that you are, or don’t you remember?” He was gesturing with his hands, and Harry noticed that the once slim, aristocratic fingers of Draco Malfoy were exactly the same except a little bit smaller and a little bit more delicate (a
Incidentally, in spite of Ron’s yelling, in spite of everything he’d spoken to Ginny about, and everything he’d told Hermione and had been telling
"Shit," says Potter after a moment in which the two of them stare at each other with heaving chests. "Your neck ... I'm sorry." His fingers are desperately gentle when he skims them across Draco's throat, which feels exceedingly tender.
He and Malfoy walked to the edge of the building, where a very thin alley divorced it from an overflowing diner. Pulling two cigarettes out, he placed both between his lips, used a Muggle lighter to spark the ends, and then handed one over. Malfoy took it with a strange, indecipherable expression on his face.
Sometimes, in the middle of class, Draco would find his eyes drawn to Potter’s unruly head of hair, and if he was especially bored, sometimes he would simply stare for awhile. He would trace the hard line of Potter’s jaw — usually just this side of stubbly, no doubt because Potter felt he couldn’t be arsed, the same way he apparently felt about his clothing if those ripped denims and washed-out tees were anything to go by — and then linger briefly on his throat, the way his Adam’s apple moved when he swallowed. Often Draco became completely captivated watching Potter’s hands, too. He remembered the way they felt on his cheek, and not for the first time he marveled over what those hands had done.
don’t have to look at it.” And with that, he wriggled free of the trap and began stalking in Harry’s and Ron’s direction. Harry was a little stunned to see that Malfoy’s head was down, and because of this he didn’t see who he was walking towards.
“So, what,” he said, “you believe them? I thought you said you’d figured out where that group in Hogsmeade was hiding.”
They looked at each other hardly more than five seconds before Draco was pulling Harry into another kiss, which he went into willingly and with a short laugh. It was lazy and sweet and much easier than talking, Draco's hand on his jaw, and for a few minutes there wasn't even all that much tongue, just soft lips and shared breath. But then Draco pressed his tongue into Harry's mouth, drawing it out into something deeper and languid and with a subtle urgency growing behind it. Soon he was beginning to pant and Harry could feel himself starting to get hard again. No sooner had he acknowledged it than Draco's hand was skimming down his chest and over his jeans, cupping his cock.
like a girl. In light of that, there must have been some sort of build-up of tension. Draco imagined it as a sink filling with water each time Potter forced himself to refrain from tossing a punch in Draco’s direction. Once the sink had filled up, where was there for the suppressed anger and emotion to go?
The first was that, whatever had happened to the rest of his body, Malfoy’s face looked … well, it looked
Draco’s stomach did a funny sort of backflip and he found himself speechless. Potter took another step closer. Draco didn’t stop him. Something, some emotion, was making his throat feel tight.
Pansy nodded understandingly. “You poor thing. Have some tea, at least. You’ll be starving halfway through Transfiguration.”
“The Basilisk, yeah.” Potter’s eyes stayed glued to it, and Draco got the feeling he hadn’t seen it since he’d killed it when he was twelve. His hand moved to his arm, just above the elbow, and he rubbed it in what seemed to be a subconscious way. “Right where I left it.” It was meant to sound like a joke, but Draco had never heard anything less amusing in his life. Following some strange impulse that he decided not to ignore, he reached out and grabbed Potter’s hand, squeezing. Potter squeezed back.
Eventually they came to a wall, and once again Potter spoke Parseltongue to open it up. Draco got the uneasy feeling that what they’d come to see was just beyond, and his heart jumped.
Feeling full and sleepy and wanting nothing more than to relax in the common room before hitting his four-poster early, Harry dragged his feet along behind Hermione out of the Great Hall with Ron in a similar state beside him. Ron shot him a miserable look, his eyes pleading, somehow, as though he thought Harry might be able to come up with a way to get them out of this.
want to fuck Malfoy. He wanted to bend him over and sink as deeply into his body as he could get and pound him until he came.
"Well I do." Slowly, Harry slid first one hand and then the other onto Malfoy's waist, pressing him lightly back against the wall. "How about you just listen?"
“Well, you’re obviously one of them, Hermione,” Parvati said with a grin. “My Galleons would be on Malfoy as the other, he’s always been very good at Potions, hasn’t he? Although who knows if he’s been able to keep up, dealing with that awful hex this year … sorry, Harry,” she added playfully, “I know it’s
“Harry?” Hermione ventured softly. Without moving his head from the window, he looked over at her. “You’ve been very quiet today. Did something happen?”
A hand flew up to Hermione’s mouth, suppressing what was clearly laughter. Harry didn’t bother hiding his own grin.
to do it or risk looking like an arsehole. “I said you’re always happy to do guest lectures. That as far as your passions go it’s second only to playing hero.”
Goyle came over to them next and enveloped Draco in such a tight hug Harry nearly felt compelled to tell him to ease up, but Draco was grinning and seemed perfectly okay. While Draco and Goyle went to Goyle's mum, Harry, Hermione, her parents, and the Weasleys finally congregated together, sharing hugs and laughter and tears and congratulations.
was the one with a person growing inside of him. Seeing Harry break down this way had bolstered his own resolve, his own strength. “No one would be a better father than you.”
cut you out of my life for good. And the next time you presume to judge my relationship before talking to me about it, you won’t get a chance to apologise once you come to your senses.”
“That’s what I thought,” Harry said solemnly, ridiculously proud of the way he was successfully holding back his laughter.
.” Rough hands pinned him where he was, and Draco realised tears had begun leaking out of the corners of his eyes. The boy’s breath was hot on his cheek and smelled rancid. “Bet you love this, don’t you?” he breathed. His hands found Draco’s slim wrists and when they squeezed, Draco swore he felt bones grinding. He let out a little whimper of pain, but this seemed only to incise his assailant. “Knew it,” his voice was drenched disturbingly with pleasure, “everyone always said you like cock, you fucking fairy. Now you’ve got a pussy to take it with.”
"I was joking about the sacrifice but I'm actually starting to wonder now," Harry said when they went into the room, dimly-lit and covered floor to ceiling with dusty old books, the green-velvet armchairs and rococo lamps also maintaining a dusty look even though they'd been cleaned recently.
A noise from one of the windows broke them out of their intimate reverie; they both looked, and through a gap in the bed’s curtains Draco saw that an unfamiliar owl was tapping on the glass. Eyebrows dipped, Harry gave him a quiet “One second” before rolling out of bed and going to let it inside.
"Are we never speaking again?" he asks, staring at Draco with those sorrowful green eyes. "Will you refuse to be anywhere near me, pack up and leave any time I show up somewhere?"
The last time Grimmauld Place had been so packed there had been Order meetings going on. Harry's heart had been full to bursting the whole day.
“Harry …” she began, a note of hysterical and defiant disbelief coloring her tone. “Oh, Harry, you haven’t …”
, Draco. It’s all you, I’m fucking crazy about you.” He paused, eyes searching Draco’s face. Draco, his voice having temporarily fucked off someplace, stayed utterly silent and wide-eyed. “Please tell me you believe me. I
Ron blinked again, several times. Whatever the thoughts going through his head, they seemed to be causing him pain, for he was still grimacing, the muscles in his jaw clenching rhythmically. “Malfoy,” he said, as if for confirmation.
confused, but I also know you can’t choose how you feel about somebody, so … I suppose I’m curious, more than anything. Do you think we could go for a walk?” She held out the toast, and after heaving a sigh and deciding this was for the best, he agreed.
I can fuck you whenever I feel like it —" Draco shoved him and Harry laughed. "I'm serious, though, I'd really love it if you'd think about it. And if we can't stand it then you move out when you get a job, simple as that."
on his face when he came into the bathroom while Draco was brushing his teeth, leaning against the door jamb with folded arms and a stupid smirk.
but Malfoy looked good like that. His date was scowling deeply now, but Malfoy still did not turn back to him. “You’re an uncivilized fucking
His eyes squeezed shut at the first press against his clenching rim, the head popping through past the unresisting muscle after a moment of prodding, Draco letting out a long, low moan. Harry pushed relentlessly inside until Draco could feel his balls touching his arse, his hole stretched impossibly wide around Harry’s girth. His pussy was pulsing out fluid at an alarming rate with each shift, leaving the insides of his thighs sticky and wet.
“Tell me it’s only me,” Harry mumbled, nosing across Draco’s cheek and down to his ear. Draco put a hand to Harry’s chest, and beneath the skin he could feel his heart fluttering away madly. The words made his gut wrench. They sounded …
“Yeah,” Draco says. He lifts up and off of Harry, making him hiss. “And I’m still figuring you out, Potter.”
That finally does it — he shoves Potter's chest, satisfied when he stumbles back a few steps looking surprised.
Harry wished suddenly there was something more he could do, but try as he might, he couldn't think of anything more than what he was already doing.
He doesn’t give Draco flowers either, the way every single one of his exes had. The gifts he gets him are not premeditated and serve no ulterior motive; they’re things he sees and buys because he thinks Draco will like them.
“Yeah,” Harry breathed. A lightly trembling hand pushed some hair off Draco’s face, and he looked up to see that Harry was watching him with something akin to worship in his eyes. It was startling in its intensity, and once he looked, he couldn’t seem to look away again. “You feel …
“I’d like to ask him whether Draco can visit as soon as possible, before Lucius succumbs to the Dementors' presence.”
, but because they were always Harry’s busiest cases and they usually lost a good chunk of their time together.
And there it was again, suddenly — Malfoy glanced down at his mouth, so quickly it looked like a reflex. His belly clenched. Something in his resolve crumbled finally.

sorry for putting you in a position so many times where I’ve had to cancel, it was selfish, I wasn’t thinking. But I promise, no matter how busy I get, I’m always gonna make time for you.”
“Please move,” he breathed. Harry steadied his hands on Draco’s hips, pressed his face into Draco’s neck, and started moving.
there a moment or two — runs his thumb over Draco's throat, feeling his cock distending it slightly — before pulling out, lifting Draco's chin, and leaning down to kiss him. Draco has no breath to kiss back but welcomes the sensation anyway.
“I’m not going to touch you anywhere you don’t wanna be touched,” Harry assured him, squeezing his hip and touching a kiss to the corner of Malfoy’s mouth.
All through the rest of October and into chilly November the only thing Harry picked up on about Malfoy was that he apparently spent every waking hour studying, still guarded by Goyle, who had now actually punched somebody. Harry hadn't actually seen this himself — he'd heard about it from Lavender, Parvati, and Tracey, who had been excitedly telling the story to Dean and Stephen in the common room one night. According to them, a Ravenclaw boy and his Gryffindor friend had been taunting Malfoy about Azkaban, and eventually something they'd said to him had pushed Goyle past his limit. The Gryffindor had been the one to receive the fist in the face before both of them had reluctantly scarpered.
“Here,” said Weasley, holding out the Invisibility Cloak to Draco. “Let’s go wait outside the common room for Hermione, shall we?”
cliché is that Harry takes everything Draco’s ever known to be cheesy and boring about relationships and manages to effortlessly subvert them.
The fingers of the hand tangled in Harry’s thick black hair tightened. Eyes still squeezed shut, Draco’s sensual awareness shrank until the sounds of the library were nothing more than background noise and the only thing in the world that was real was the feeling of Harry’s mouth on his throbbing clit. And he was relentless — the pressure never stopped, not even to tease with the tip of his tongue; it was constant stimulation, the hot, wet suction of Harry’s mouth, and the orgasm that followed came fast and hard. Draco’s jaw fell open and his whole body shuddered as it washed over him, hips twitching against Harry’s mouth helplessly under the desk. Harry kept at it through the whole thing, as the exquisite pleasure climbed and finally peaked, and still he didn’t stop. One arm clamped down harder on Draco’s leg, holding him in place while the other migrated between his legs to slip two fingers deep into his pussy. Draco heard a gasping noise come out of his own mouth and had to slap a hand over it just in time for a second climax to bulldoze into him, little spurts of fluid squirting out of his cunt around Harry’s fingers.
“No, it doesn’t. But Hermione thinks that might be because they didn’t know about it when they made the Map.”
. It was just that surrendering over so much of himself that way had been an enormous undertaking, and he simply hadn’t found the courage to do it again yet.
"How are you feeling, Potter?" asked Pomfrey, pulling out her wand and hovering it over his bandages. "Any pain?"
“I know what he did,” she grinned. “He told me shortly after it happened; I only hoped Malfoy would actually go through with it. Ron’s really growing up this year, isn’t he?”
, leaving Weasley's party just because you see Harry with some bird ... what did you expect him to do, Draco, take a vow of abstinence? You broke up with him."
The very same night, with Leo in Ron and Hermione's room for the first time, Draco finally brought up the appointment he had for next Tuesday morning.
“I know what you said.” He kept his voice calm, not in the least surprised that even under these unbelievable circumstances — even after he’d
Thankfully, the Thursday of the week before Halloween Professor Boothby had the class divided up into groups practising nonverbal magic. The spell had been chosen in the spirit of the holiday,
He hasn’t been to the manor in almost a week and the guilt is eating holes in his will to wake up and go about his business every day. He misses Draco in the worst way: how he rolls his eyes and smirks when Harry makes sarcastic comments; how his hair smells like coconut, but in an expensive way; how he gives and gives and gives of himself endlessly when Harry has broken him down to that primal place where he loses all of the thorns he grew around his father.
The hand sliding beneath his bottoms paused, Harry’s fingers just a millimetre away from the dip of his arse crack.
He tosses his glasses onto his night table and spreads Daphne's long legs, crawling between them. The skirt falls onto his (or rather, Daphne's) stomach. He's completely thrown by the tits on his chest, but that doesn't stop it feeling incredible when Potter's large, warm hand cups one of them. He bends his neck to meet Draco in another kiss, which Draco can only moan into when he feels the hard shape of Potter's cock pressing against his cunt through the thin cotton of his boxers. Only a moment later though his fingers are back, and he buries two of them inside even as he swallows Draco's panting, gasping breaths.
Malfoy didn't respond, returning his attention to his book. He looked small and vulnerable bundled up in a winter cloak and plain green hat that covered most of his hair, cheeks pink with the cold.
Sitting beside Ginny and across from Ron and Hermione in one of the carriages being led towards the castle by a couple Thestrals, Harry thought if he hadn’t known about — if he hadn’t been a

“Thank you,” he said tightly, and giving a curt nod after a moment he turned away when nothing else seemed forthcoming. He’d only gotten a few steps when Theo called out again.
it," Malfoy huffed, his cheeks a bit pink. With frustration, maybe. Or maybe something else. "I've never seen anything so defiant."
“Hi,” Draco says back. He looks as he always does: effortlessly put-together, as if he’ll be in a meeting later instead of padding around his family’s grotesquely enormous home by himself. There are signs of his distress, though. Signs Harry has learned to pick up on over the last two months. Draco’s chapped lower lip is the biggest giveaway: he’s been chewing on it.
“We have discovered a potion that will reverse the effects of the hex,” she said calmly. As though a Stasis Charm had been cast upon him, Draco felt his body just sort of … freeze up. For one dizzying moment, the words replayed in his head but would not process. He gaped at her, aware only of the rushing sound in his ears and the furious knocking of his heart. “The complication,” she went on, voice quieter now, “is that the scans we did earlier have showed us that you’re about two weeks pregnant.”
"Potter —" he said breathlessly, pulling away from the kiss. His thin chest was rising and falling rapidly, his pupils dilated. "Wait, I have to ... I have to tell you something."
“It’s true,” Weasley said. “Harry’s not like other people, Malfoy. He’s better. He’s braver, and he’s stronger, and he’s a good fucking person, unlike most of the world. You don’t know him well enough yet to understand that he’s too … he’s too
"Yeah," Draco said with a wet laugh. "I get it, Potter." He stood on his toes and kissed him, a hand coming up to skim his fingers down Harry's cheek. "Thank you."
"Oh my god." Harry rolled his eyes, frustrated almost beyond words. He looked Malfoy in the eye and said, "You came in your pants, Draco, and guess what? So did I." Now it was Malfoy gaping, and Harry couldn't help but notice how pretty his mouth was. He also couldn't help noticing that, for as horrified as Malfoy looked, he was also breathing rather shallowly, and there was a glazed look in his eyes that said he was turned on. Harry's cock twitched.
He heard the shower start. He had half a mind to go in there and demand to be fucked, but decided against it in the end. Mostly it was that he didn’t want to
Draco looks away from him, out across the water and its soothing, hypnotic motions. The moon is huge and full and plump, reflected palely on its surface.
Draco’s tongue found the side of his cheek, mulling her words over, until finally he snapped his book shut and turned his full attention to her. “I’m sorry, Pansy,” he said, and saw the colour drain from her face. “You’ll have to do better than that.”
“One of them was a locket. Hermione and I were looking for the Sword of Gryffindor at Bathilda Bagshot's house in Godric's Hollow, but it wound up being a trap. She'd already died, and Voldemort's snake, Nagini, had, like ... possessed her body. I dunno ... it was the single most fucked-up thing I've ever seen in my life, I'll tell you that much. Anyway, Nagini let Voldemort know we were there, and I guess the Horcrux must have sensed him or
The desk he’d chosen today was tucked into a little nook off to the side. Plenty of students were grouped around the larger tables in the main section of the library, and more than a few were milling about nearby among the bookshelves, but there was nobody in his immediate vicinity to disrupt him.
“I think I said ‘very pretty,’ actually,” Hermione interrupted, looking far too amused. Harry scowled.
“I wanna be with you, Potter. Properly. I thought …” But he shakes his head, deciding that now isn’t the time to explain about his father. “I thought it was a stupid idea. Now I realise that it probably is, but that I don’t really care much. I’ve decided to ignore my better judgment this one time.”
Without hesitation, Harry leaned in and kissed him; he felt Malfoy smile into it and a hurricane of butterflies erupted in his stomach.
The second time it’s to make up for the first failed attempt, and Draco puts more thought into it. Not a
Harry let go of one of his hands and instead lifted it to cup Draco’s cheek. He leaned in slowly, and when their lips met, it felt quite as though Draco’s heart had swelled to double its usual size.
Most scars, like the ones on Draco’s chest, fade eventually to white. Harry’s is different, though — its lines are thin and imprecise and faintly pink against his dark skin, starting at his hairline and branching out into hectic patterns that take up half his forehead like a bolt of lightning.
"I genuinely can't tell if you're serious," said Harry finally. He expected Malfoy to burst into cruel, mocking laughter, but he didn't.
It was five o’clock when they were let into one of Azkaban’s visitation rooms by a guard. The Minister himself had greeted them at the entrance — probably, Draco noted, because nobody else looked too happy about the arrangement. He and Harry were not only on a first-name basis, but seemed to know one another well. He had even shaken Draco’s hand and given a respectful little nod. Afterwards, Draco had obsessively tugged at the left sleeve of his cloak, and he was grateful Shacklebolt hadn’t stayed.
“Maybe you weren’t planning on it,” says Draco mildly. He traces his fingertips along the underside of Harry’s straining prick, dancing along the nerves, every vein engorged with blood, leading him along a knife’s edge towards a feeling of frighteningly unfamiliar vulnerability and desperation. “But you were thinking about it,” he coos. “Did you picture it, Harry? Pushing him against the wall face-first and filling him up with your cock?”
It’s hard to hear, only Draco doesn’t know why. His chest hurts, not because it's bad but because it's too good. It's more than he deserves, really.
look he’d pinned Draco with, the one that said, “I know your father, and I know what he would do if he saw you this way.”
“That we can do,” he conceded, dropping his hands from Potter’s face and privately reveling in the fact that Potter’s hands stayed firmly planted on his waist. “Where do you want to go?"
“I’m taking the piss, Draco,” Harry cut him off. He reached for Draco’s waist and pulled him close, and before Draco could get his breath back from a short, surprised intake of breath Harry’s mouth was on his, warm and familiar and soothing. He brought his hands to Harry’s face and kissed back without bothering to hide his overwhelming relief.
"Are you calling me stupid?" Harry said loudly, drowning him out. The boy looked suddenly horrified. "Well? Do you think I'm an idiot?"
Earlier, he’d used a school owl to send a note to Malfoy, and it hadn’t been without a pang of sadness when he didn’t see Hedwig among the others.
It disgusted some part of him, that the idea of Harry not loving him anymore in his real body should make him hesitate getting it back. It was
Harry chewed on his bottom lip, wishing more than ever before he could do something to help, give him some
“Nothing.” Draco ripped his gaze away from the plate he’d been staring at and pushed it habitually towards Goyle, who took it in a state of similar habit and added its contents to his own meal. “I’m still feeling nauseous, that’s all. Hormones, I expect.”
“Really, Draco?” Theo drawled, lifting an arrogant eyebrow. “Don’t bother denying it, that look on your face when I said his name was answer enough in itself. I just have one question, though: why
“You’re so pretty when you’re coming all over my face in public,” Harry’s disembodied voice said beside his ear a moment later, and Draco at least found the strength to dig an elbow into the air around where he knew Harry to be. He was satisfied to feel it make contact, but the next second there was a quiet chuckle, and Draco scowled.
hates this Potter, but his cock is just absolutely eating it up. He feels nearly faint from the lack of blood being delivered to his brain.
Mrs Weasley came round the table and with a few deft flicks of her wand Draco's platinum blond hair fell to the kitchen floor, leaving him in the end with something much shorter and
With Malfoy’s hand on his boxers, finding his erection again, Harry made the split-second decision to act on a crazy impulse and leaned forwards, recklessly, to kiss him.
Five or six different people stopped by to wish Harry luck personally, slapping his back and punching his shoulder and telling him they were counting on him to flatten Hufflepuff. A particularly burly seventh-year, Kenny Helstrom, nearly knocked Harry’s bacon out of his hand when he grabbed Harry’s shoulder and shook it bracingly.
Harry fiddled with his empty tumbler, unsure how to broach the very topic which had sent him and Ron into a tailspin of emotion last week. Ron, however, seemed to sense this, because he said, “I’ll go get us refills, shall I?” Harry shot him a weak smile and watched him go back to the bar, where he ordered the drinks without once ogling Madam Rosmerta, something he’d been wont to do back in the day. This observation gave Harry a curiously mingled sense of fierce jealousy and exquisite happiness. Ron and Hermione’s relationship was blossoming so beautifully, and some part of Harry missed having that — a steady relationship, something easy and fun and treacly-sweet.
“Hello yourself,” Draco said, pulling away. Without thinking about it, he grazed his thumb across Potter’s bottom lip. Potter watched him, a hand lifting to circle lightly around Draco’s wrist — which, Draco realised too late, hurt. He hissed in pain and pulled it back, and immediately Potter’s eyebrows dipped with concern.
“Wh —” he started, and then broke off, looking irritated and a little bit interested, although Malfoy probably didn’t intend for him to see that last bit. “A
, and no sooner was he in front of Draco than he was gently pulling his legs apart, green eyes — no longer hidden behind those stupid glasses — bright with a promise that was as filthy as it was comforting.
There's some part of him that doesn't know why he's still doing this. Why he's pushing Harry away when he's trying so hard to communicate, destroying the assumption Draco's been clinging to with such savage, miserable satisfaction that their two years together had meant nothing to him. What he does know is that all his reasons for ending things in the first place are still true: they'd fought constantly, they had completely different ways of communicating, they liked too many different things, the list went on. So it doesn't matter, really, that he misses Harry so much he can hardly breathe sometimes, or that Harry's worried about him and maybe even still hurting a little bit too. Eventually they'll both move on and be better for it. His father had once told him that if it was painful you'd know it was the right decision.
"How did it go?" Hermione asked before Harry even got a chance. It warmed his heart in all honesty — the friendship he'd seen blossoming between Draco and Hermione was more than he'd ever hoped for.
The moment the door closes behind them Potter has him pressed up against it, their mouths glued back together, separating only so Potter can get both their uniform shirts off. Like last time it's hard to keep up with him so Draco gladly lets Potter do what he wants, moaning softly into his mouth when he brings their hips together and Draco can feel his hard cock against his thigh. Potter works open his flies and drags Draco's trousers down his legs, then turns him around and presses him into the wall. Potter's familiarly warm hand goes to his arse, fingers skimming along the seam but never dipping between his cheeks. Draco puts his forehead to the wall, fingers curling against it uselessly. His cock is stiff and throbbing already, but he doesn't touch himself.
“Malfoy,” he breathed, even as Malfoy’s hands were guiding him to a wall and pulling him down to a sitting position. Sitting felt better, his brain registered. “Malfoy, what are you —?”
He'd paused only long enough to tear off both their robes before sinking to the floor on his knees and fumbling with Harry's trousers.
At one point in their lives, this would have been enough to set Potter off into a full-on rage. Swinging fists would have been an easy guarantee. But like in the Quidditch stands, Potter seemed strangely immune to taunts these days. His face stayed mostly expressionless except for a knitted brow.
Grinning broadly, Harry slid his fingers through the back of Malfoy’s hair and gripped hard, pulling his head back so his throat was bared vulnerably. It was a devastatingly appealing sight to behold. He could see Malfoy’s eyes widen, could even feel his breathing increase again, but didn’t let go.
“You know you make much lovelier sounds than the guitar, just so we’re clear,” he said, and Draco, with what strength he had left, shoved Harry and watched him fall sideways laughing.
“Not without questioning everything I ever thought I knew about myself,” he said quietly. “If you were looking for a straight answer, I don’t have one for you, Gin. I don’t even have one for myself. That's why I wanted to wait to tell anybody. The whole thing is just … I mean, I can barely put it into words.” He dragged a hand through his hair and sighed again, watching the ghost of his breath linger in the cold air before disappearing. “It’s funny, really — Malfoy and Ron believe exactly the same thing — that I’ve forgotten who Malfoy is. That I’m just seeing a girl I’d like to —” He broke off, remembered whom he was talking to, and upon seeing the embarrassed flush on Ginny’s cheeks quickly amended his course, “Er — that I’m just seeing a girl, that is. The ironic part of the whole thing is that that couldn’t be farther from the truth. I don’t like him because I think he’s a fit bird, I like him because I like …
"Do you mean your physical safety?" Hermione interrupted. "Because nobody's going to hurt you, Draco, not after what happened with that Ravenclaw boy. And certainly not if one of us is with you."
“You don’t like me, Potter. I know that you think you do, and I think Granger even seems to believe it, but you don’t. What you like is this
Draco's heart gives a funny thud and there's a small contraction in his stomach as he looks up into Harry's eyes and sees the open uncertainty there. The pleading, the hopefulness. He
“Why?” Harry demanded, through what sounded like gritted teeth. One of his hands moved to Draco’s shoulder, pulling him back onto his cock to meet every thrust. “Tell me why not.”
“No, wait,” came Harry’s voice from behind him, and when Draco looked sideways he saw Harry had finally gotten his shirt on and was now just a foot back, looking at Pansy with his eyebrows drawn. “Hermione told me you’ve been avoiding her,” he said, bringing his unnervingly green gaze around to Draco. “If she’s trying to talk to you, Draco, you should at least hear her out.”
“Fuck …” Malfoy whimpered after several minutes of this, moving his hips impatiently and bringing his hands around to Harry’s chest, digging his nails in there instead. “God, Potter, I’m close again … faster,
He handed the parchment back to Potter, mind beginning to wander back to the ball that had ended just a few hours ago. The picture of Lily and James Potter above the monument to the dead. Potter, hiding beneath an Invisibility Cloak instead of soaking up the adoration everyone so desperately wanted to heap upon him. In fact, the Cloak and that Map together must have allowed Potter to become virtually unfindable, which was apparently something he valued quite a lot.
things, the ones that left Draco with knickers so damp he had to run to his dorm between classes to change them. Things like the crackle of magic in the air when he demonstrated non-verbal magic in Defence; like the way he gleamed with sweat and exhilaration every time he came off the pitch after Quidditch practice, reeking of sex-appeal.
"And I also told you a million times that night, I was unhappy when we were together. I hated the fighting, I hated that ..." He trails off before he says anything too honest, something Harry can latch onto like a metaphorical foot in the door and use it to pry the rest out of him. His resolve is only strengthened when he remembers that Harry's already seeing someone new. Even if some part of him had been tempted to give in, there's no point. One thing he knows for sure is that he can't be
“Draco,” Harry said softly, cupping one damp cheek with a large hand, “for you, I’d do a hell of a lot worse.”
“Your clit, yeah,” Potter said, and dragged his finger across it again, pulling another guttural sound out of Draco. “From what I gather, it’s quite sensitive.”
Having gotten quite good at nonverbal magic, Harry was busy helping Neville when someone’s mis-casted spell created a flash of brilliant green light from the end of their wand, and Harry’s heart instantly froze in his chest. His scar didn’t
“That jumper of mine,” he said, still watching Draco thoughtfully. Draco looked up, fingers pausing in a second exploration of Potter’s chest scar. “You wear it sometimes, don’t you?”
They spent a majority of their detention cleaning up the greenhouse in silence, Draco loudly making snide comments now and then and getting a little thrill every time he saw Potter’s jaw muscles twitch. He may not have wanted to be here, but at least he knew he was keeping Potter from one of the Friday evening Quidditch matches the students had put together this year.
“Your clothes came,” she explained, taking a seat beside the parcel and crossing one leg over the other primly. She eyed his exposed torso, breasts hidden beneath a silky brassiere, expression unreadable. “There’s a dress in there I’ll need to take home during the holidays. Mother says she wants to see me in it. I think she was glad for an excuse to do some shopping — she didn’t ask any questions even though I practically requested a new wardrobe.”
—sneering, drawling, pointy-faced, cold-hearted, ill-intentioned, wait-until-my-father-hears-about-this Draco Malfoy.
Harry lagged a little bit behind the others, even Ginny, who had caught up with a friend from her own year. He looked again across the Hall towards the Slytherin table, and to his surprise, he found Malfoy looking back at him this time. The eye contact held for only a few seconds before Malfoy looked away, and by the time Harry had gotten to his dorm and climbed into bed, he’d forgotten about it entirely.
Draco looked away, cheeks flushed, but his gaze found Potter again when a hand was suddenly gently gripping his arm — his
"You've been under it before, haven't you?" said Malfoy. It was difficult to place his expression, but he didn't sound too surprised. Harry merely nodded again. "How many times?"
“There’s no calculation, Harry,” said Draco. He pushed him back against a wall and pulled open the zipper of his windbreaker. Harry looked more bemused than ever. “Whatever his weight is, that’s also his weight in Chocolate Frogs.”
Potter kissed him again, slow and deep, leaving Draco feeling weak in the knees and embarrassingly high.
“Are you immortal?” Draco asks. Potter doesn’t laugh, although he does look a little disturbed for the first time.
Draco had heard stories. Mostly snippets of conversation illicitly overheard, hiding out behind closed doors with his ear pressed to the wall. That had been when he was younger, mostly. When he’d been curious for curiosity’s sake. Before his childhood had been blasted to smithereens and suddenly bullying Potter was the last thing on his mind.
"Come again," Harry said into his ear, slowing his hips down to a leisurely pace. Draco shook his head weakly from side to side on the pillow.
Before Draco was forced to think of anything to say in response to this, however, the house-elf reappeared with a
“Have you ever had your cock sucked, Potter?” Malfoy enquired. His voice was saturated with dark amusement. It made Harry’s cock twitch and when he felt Malfoy squeeze he bit back a groan.
"Boy," Ron said, "you think it was something telling Malfoy's mum you guys are having a kid? Wait until you tell mine."
Potter held the Map out in front of them as they made their way back inside the castle, and then up to the second floor, where Draco was absolutely thrown when they stopped outside Myrtle’s bathroom.
She was quiet another moment. "Come here, Draco," she said finally. His eyes misted a little with tears that he attributed adamantly to the hormones and he went to her; she lifted her hands to his belly, feeling the shape of it, and looked up at him. She, too, was wet-eyed. "How far?"
Pansy, horror-struck, opened her mouth to say something, but stopped when the bathroom door opened. Usually Harry just walked out in a towel, but with Pansy still in the room, he had apparently elected to dress himself.
things, Hermione," said Ron testily. Goyle grinned and looked at Harry, who grinned back. "That’s not how memory works."
He'd decided not to breast feed in the end for the same reason he'd had the cesarian section: the dysphoria was too strong. He'd become aware in the days leading up to it that the idea of giving birth in the traditional way wasn't something he could handle, and Harry, Pansy, and Hermione had all been invaluable support. Even Ron had, although he'd sometimes looked a bit green when it was talked about.
“Oh, yeah, absolutely,” said Harry, hurrying to take the last two out of his pack and handing them to the woman and her friend. He then used his little Muggle contraption to light both of them up, oblivious to the way they looked at him with hungry eyes.
Harry shrugs. He wants neither to spoil Draco’s excitement nor to acknowledge the possibility that this bloke could still very well reach out. He would be an idiot not to.
biggest load of hippogriff shit I’ve ever heard.” Harry strode over to him and tore the blouse out of his hands. Draco sneered, but it did nothing to deter Harry, who, if possible, looked more irritated than ever. “I spent half an hour eating your cunt last night, what the fuck d’you suppose that was?”
truthful, but it amounted to the same. It was back where it belonged now. He saw the surprise on Malfoy's face, which quickly returned to a neutral expression. "I fixed my old wand."
Malfoy stepped in front of him, face expressionless, and suddenly his hand was on Harry's cock, cupping loosely around the shape of it, and instead of pushing him off and demanding to know what the fuck this was supposed to be, he let his head fall back against the stone wall and swallowed hard.
Malfoy must have dropped his own cigarette as well, because he lifted the hand that wasn’t closed around the Snitch and brushed some of Harry’s fringe away from his forehead, not scowling anymore but not smiling either. He looked contemplative now.
“No,” Harry said flatly around his food, and took a moment to swallow down the rest of the toast and jam in his mouth. “We’re not dating or anything, if that’s what you mean. He’s only just recently admitted he likes me, too. We’re still just … trying to figure everything out, I guess. I know it doesn’t make sense to you guys —”
Draco dropped his gaze again and wrapped his arms around himself. "It was horrible," he said. "Being in there. Around them all the time. It was only two months but after the first three days I remember thinking —" he shook his head, eyes haunted and staring at a fixed point on the duvet, "— this is it, I can't survive this. Not even two months. I don't really know how I did, if I'm being honest. And even when I left ..." He didn't finish, but Harry understood. Even when he'd left, he hadn't really
“Do you realise, Draco,” his father said over him, “that looking like this, you are of no use at all to the Malfoy name? What good are you to me now?”
“Yes,” says Draco, pressing another kiss to Harry’s shoulder, over his damp shirt. He tightens his arms. “Perfect.”
They were gone too soon and Harry’s mouth replaced them, much gentler but still with a tangible sense of urgency about it.
“Stop talking, Potter,” Malfoy cut him off, and with his wand transfigured an abandoned old quill into a cup that he spelled full of water. Harry took it and forced down a sip. The cold was refreshing and helped to return him to the present. “Finnigan always was a bloody pillock.”
Now Draco laughs, mockingly, and he speeds up his hand. He starts twisting his wrist at the top, palming over the sensitive, engorged head, and dipping his thumb into the slit like he’s trying to coax out more pre-come. He looks like he’s barely restraining himself from leaning over and using his mouth instead; he’s got a good and proper fetish for Harry’s cock, an obsession that rivals only his love of riling Harry up on purpose just to monopolise his attention. It only makes it more impressive that he hasn’t done it yet.
Draco began pulling his things out of his bag when he remembered the book he’d left lying in the corridor back where he’d been assaulted, and there wasn’t a snowball’s chance in hell he was going back to retrieve it. Not alone, anyway, and he would have died before telling Pansy or Blaise what had happened.
The sentiment of Ron’s words was all well and good, but it didn’t mean that the attention wasn’t irksome while it was happening.
"Come here," he said, opening Malfoy's legs again and pulling him close to the seat's edge. Malfoy leaned back against the window, one hand wrapped around a thigh, the other clenched tightly over his chest. He was breathing hard. Harry took his wand out of his jeans and muttered a spell that coated his cock in lube, stroked it a few times, and then pressed his slick fingers into Malfoy once more. Malfoy's toes curled and his hips lifted slightly.
“I did a few months ago,” says Harry dismissively, stretching out his feet and resting them carefully next to the ashtray on the table, momentarily making the glass shake. Draco glares at him.
He forgot about all of this, however, when suddenly, with the abruptness of a flash of lightning, Draco became aware that something felt …
, and now, suddenly, an unbridled and utterly bewildering need to touch, and taste, and feel, and consume. They devoured one another, Malfoy's fingers digging painfully into Harry's face, pulling at his hair, while Harry's hands slid beneath Malfoy's shirt in search of skin. More instinct than conscious decision, he ground his hips against Malfoy's and had to press his face into that sweet-smelling neck to muffle his groan at the friction on his cock. And after that he couldn't stop, holding the gasping blond beneath him steady by the waist while he rutted against him, Malfoy pressing up into it and forcing their mouths back together none-too-gently. It wasn't enough — he wanted more skin, more contact, wanted to strip Malfoy naked and taste every inch of him — but it was impossible to pause long enough even to get him out of his shirt.
Draco let out a hoarse sob and was grateful when his mum pulled him into another hug, cradling his head against her shoulder, for they were now exactly the same height.
Harry had punched Kenny Helstrom, but the fact that it had been another Gryffindor was perhaps the most-discussed bit of the whole thing. Everybody seemed to have reached the same conclusion, though: if Harry Potter was swinging a fist at somebody, they probably deserved it. This was such a one-eighty from the way his peers had treated him prior to his defeat of Voldemort that it actually irked Harry quite a bit, and had it not been for his desire to protect Malfoy from becoming involved at all, he might have been tempted to start another fight just to prove he wasn’t a saint.
“Oh, cut the shit, Draco,” Harry said, voice hard now as Draco stalked away from him. “If you’re upset about something, you have to
“Hello, Harry,” said Parvati when he pulled up a third chair. “Brilliant playing today. I was just asking Hermione if it was true, what they were saying about you and Puddlemere in the paper, but she won’t say a thing.”
"Draco." It's Harry's voice, and it gives him goosebumps. He swallows hard and doesn't answer. "Can we talk for a second?"
?” he said, half-laughing, and his voice was coloured with pleasant surprise. Draco flushed furiously. Something dark and lascivious passed across Potter’s face, only stirring Draco’s arousal.
“He means Wonderwall, Harry,” said Granger, grinning. Harry finally smiled too, and although their little Muggle joke was lost on Weasley and himself he was glad to see that it had apparently been the prodding Harry needed to give in. He set his beer back down and went to get the guitar; something about the way he threw the thin and fraying strap over his head, the way his hands went effortlessly to their places, was unexpectedly attractive. The left one curled easily around the neck of the instrument, heavily-roughened fingers finding their odd positions on the strings, something Draco had always thought looked very painful.
"Yeah," said Harry slowly, looking back and forth between them, "and so did several other people, including McGonagall and Slughorn."
Malfoy. But if I had to guess, Harry, I’d say it’s possible he’s had these feelings for you for a very long time.”
“You can play Devil’s Advocate if you want,” Harry said calmly, making Draco arch a brow. The truth was, he wasn’t an Auror for nothing — he was an extremely perceptive person. And after years on the job, he was now able to read body language so well Draco often felt like he couldn’t have lied about anything even if he’d wanted to, because Harry would see right through it in a second. “You know he does.”
Ron was right — it often didn't feel like Malfoy at all. He did things like pressing himself into walls to keep as far as possible out of everyone's way; he never spoke in class, and generally the professors didn't force him to; he was almost never seen in the Great Hall during meals; he hardly even seemed to make eye contact with anyone save for Goyle. Now that he had begun taking closer notice of these things, Harry often found himself staring. It was easy to do, since Malfoy rarely lifted his gaze from whatever book he was reading or the floor.
me, so I didn’t have to find out from Slughorn at six in the bloody morning that my mother was here and knew everything.”
“That would be the best place to study, yes,” Draco said, thinking of Potter’s note and suppressing a grin.
"Neither did I," said McGonagall gravely. "And nor did Horace. It's a troubling thing, to see the extent of the damage that was done last year." Her face softened then, and she fixed Harry with something close to a smile. "Don't worry, Potter. Slow and difficult as it may be, we will get there."
him. His lips folded over the sensitive head, sucking lightly, and then he was opening wider and Harry groaned as he was taken into that wet warmth. It was like nothing he’d ever felt, the slight suction, the velvety inside of a mouth as it hallowed around him, the feeling of a hot tongue pressing up against his swollen flesh. And of course that it was
Draco froze at the unexpected voice, looking wide-eyed in the direction where Harry had been, but of course, he was now invisible.
“Potter,” Draco cut him off, voice low and strangled. Mental images were flashing through his head now, ones of himself waving boxes of sweets in Potter’s face, antagonising him about his lack of a proper family and how he’d never received any parcels from home.
His heart rate picked back up again, but this time it was because he’d sprung up from the stump and quickened his pace to a jog in order to get to the owlery.
"You've decided not to get Astoria anything, then?" says Potter. He goes to his bed and sits down on the edge, where he begins unlacing his boots and taking them off. Laid out beside him are his Quidditch robes, and Draco realises Potter had been about to go take advantage of the empty pitch. The randy bastard hadn't even hesitated changing course at the sudden appearance of Daphne.
His birthday came too on the Monday before graduation, and while Draco indulged Pansy in his company during the day, he spent most of the evening with Harry, Ron, and Hermione. They sat outside near the lake and ate dinner and laughed and talked and it felt silly and corny and wonderful to snog Harry in the moonlight with the sound of Ron and Hermione chatting nearby.
“You forgot the most important part,” he said after a moment. Harry looked at him in question. “They’re birds. They can fly. If you can fly, no one can ever trap you.”
The very confusing thing was that Harry hadn’t been lying when he’d said he could never forget that it was Malfoy inside that girl’s body. Nobody but Malfoy could make his blood boil the way it did when he was with the blond, could take his emotions and inflate them to such impossible heights. No, he could
He hesitated. Looked back and forth between Potter’s eyes, seeing the little flecks of deeper green this close. Then —
, Malfoy, you look so fucking good.” He lifted Malfoy’s legs under the thighs, propping them securely over his shoulders and using his thumbs to spread his arse immodestly, the sight of his tight, pink little pucker making Harry’s cock throb painfully where it was still trapped in his denims. He leaned forward and breathed hotly across it, in reaction to which he felt a full-body shudder move through Malfoy’s willowy frame.
Draco’s fascination is something of which he is very much aware, but has never been able to put into words. Not ones that make sense, anyway. All he knows is that to him, like to the rest of the world, Harry’s scar has taken on a legendary sort of significance, and it gives Draco the chills just to look at it, and to know what it is. What it
Harry pulled open Draco’s thighs and crawled between them, his cock hard and flushed red, dribbling copious amount of pre-come from the slit. Draco couldn’t tear his eyes away from the sight when Harry wrapped one large, square hand around it and pulled back the foreskin, wanking himself slowly, leisurely, as though he knew perfectly well the effect it was having on Draco.
Draco rolled his eyes, pleased by the way the comment had utterly cleared away any initial tension or awkwardness. “What a stupid subject,” he drawled, juxtaposing this haughty statement against a move to pull his knickers back to rights. He hopped off the desk and flattened the front of his skirt, then closed up his robes. “My father always says —” He broke off, eyes widening at the words that had so naturally come tumbling right out of his mouth. He looked around at Potter, and found that he had a closed-off expression on his face. “Er — I never thought it sounded very useful,” he amended lamely. Draco felt certain Potter would make a comment, but he didn’t.
Ron was enthusiastically explaining something to him and Hermione about the Chudley Cannons’ stats for this season when Harry noticed a muted expression come across Hermione’s face. He looked over his shoulder and saw, with a jolt, Kenny Helstrom and a couple of his other Gryffindor friends passing through the corridor. Abandoning any pretense of listening to Ron’s story, Harry watched the beefy seventh-year as he walked past, flashing a grin Harry’s way before his sights landed on someone else — Malfoy, leaning against the wall on the other side of the corridor. Malfoy went paler than usual, and a moment later his eyes flickered to Harry’s, almost like a reflex.
The weird thing was that Malfoy kept letting it happen. Harry had thought for sure after the second time intervening that Malfoy would have told him to bugger off, but he didn't. It was quite a good solution for the time being, the only hitch being the fact that Harry could feel himself beginning to obsess. Not over the situation, but over Malfoy himself. He'd done his fair share of that before, of course, but unlike two years ago, there was no mystery to solve this time. He just ... liked watching him.
“It’s all right, Draco,” said Harry, finger moving slickly in and out of his flexing hole, his other hand a steady weight on Draco’s lower back. Eyes closed, smelling his own sweat and the rich woody scent of his desk, Draco bit back a moan as Harry’s finger brushed once, carelessly, over his prostate. “I know you’ve been feeling so neglected lately, what with me doing my fucking
The use of Malfoy’s first name was a tangible presence between them, especially potent when their eyes met. Harry tried his hardest to ascertain what was going on in his head but found it impossible to read his expression.
, of all things — to think he had been only seconds away from getting drunk instead of coming to this thing seemed impossible now. “Before you ask me to give up something
Potter’s eyes immediately came back to Draco’s face. His expression was quizzical, like he wasn’t sure he’d heard correctly.
Privately, he doubted very much whether he'd end up taking her suggestion. Hermione wasn't often wrong, but he thought this might have been one of those rare times. If anything, Malfoy seemed quite like he wanted to be left alone, and it would really only make sense for that to apply double to him.
Boothby did indeed stick the Patronus Charm into their exams, but seeing as a good deal of students (with the exception of Potter’s disciples) could not produce anything corporeal, Draco’s shield form was more than enough to earn good marks.
, and it would have been so easy to. He believed that she knew Harry better than anyone else, he even believed that
of his world. I'm sure he looks just as repulsively lovesick when he's talking about his new girlfriend."
“Anyway, I don’t care,” he added with a note of finality, turning away from her again to pick up the clothing he’d lain out. “It’s one more year of school and then bollocks to all of them. Now, do you mind leaving so I can get dressed? I’ll meet you in the library.”
"You're so fucking stupid," Draco said into his neck, pressing his wet cheeks into Harry's skin and smiling. He lifted a hand, blindly finding Harry's face and feeling the scratchiness of his stubble against his palm. "Tell me you're always gonna feel that way."
Draco took deep, calming breaths as Harry continued pushing inside, something that seemed, impossibly, never to end. He thought he could feel it throbbing and pulsing inside of him, searingly hot against his insides, and it occurred to Draco that this must be his limit, Harry’s cock must have been stretching him as far as he could go, because when he felt Harry’s balls touch his arse, he could hardly even move.
eventually I was planning to ask you to marry me. One day, when, you know, we feel like we're ready. I just ... I already knew, I bought the ring so I'd have it when I knew the time was right. Because I do believe we can make it, it never even occurred to me that we couldn't."
“He was the one who started flirting with me,” he says, as if this should have been obvious. “And he was the one who said he’d like to get together sometime. So he’s the one who has to make the first move.”
Potter watched him for another few seconds; Draco couldn’t have begun to guess what was going on in his head. Finally, once he’d apparently come to some conclusion, he stuck a hand back inside one of his pockets and pulled out an old, ratty piece of parchment. Draco flashed back to a time when he’d seen Potter stuffing something like that away inside his robes. His eyes narrowed at it.
.” He moved forward, ready to physically grapple Weasley out of the way, only to be stopped by Granger’s voice:
“Thanks, I really appreciate it. I’ll see you later — nice to meet you, Potter,” he added to Harry, and then left. Harry watched him go and then turned to Draco, looking irritated.
“Are you cold?” He pulled off his jumper and handed it over automatically, and although his cheeks coloured when he realised to whom he’d just offered it, he didn’t retract the offer. Malfoy seemed to contemplate the article of clothing for several moments before taking it and pulling it over his small frame. “Parkinson been lending you clothes?”
," he says again, squeezing Draco's hand. "And I could never lose interest. I swear to you, we can figure these things out. All of them."
me to settle down with some bird and start a family. Every interview I’m forced into, that’s the question: ‘When are you getting married?’ and ‘Will you be an Auror when you stop playing Quidditch?’ and ‘How many kids do you want?’ It’s never-fucking-ending. I’m only
. He was confused, yes. Monumentally pissed off, absolutely. But sorry? Not even a little bit. “Good to be rid of her, to tell you the truth. Couldn’t bloody stand it having her here every time I came home from practise. Didn’t even let me take a bath without bringing me a sodding tray of tea and biscuits. Like I can be arsed to eat biscuits when I’m trying to have a fucking soak.”
Harry had a hand in his hair now, tipping his head just slightly back for a better angle. Both of Draco's were in his lap, clenching at his thighs. Mouth full, throat distended and breathing unevenly through his nose, his glassy eyes told Harry he was getting what he needed out of this. He slid deeper into his throat, feeling Draco gag, and then pulled out to let him suck in a more satisfying breath with a gasp. He lifted a hand to wrap around Harry's cock, sliding through a mixture of spit and pre-come, working him over with soft squelching noises that made Harry's gut twist. When he took him back in his mouth and sank as far down as he could go his nose touched Harry's shirt, so he pulled that off over his head and groaned when Draco swallowed around him.
Inevitably, his eyes lifted back to the most famous of Potter’s scars, and he brushed a thumb across it.
He lined up and slid in more easily this time. Draco breathed out a sigh and lifted his hands to Harry’s shoulders; one of them went further and took his glasses off, discarding them beside him on the ground. The urge came again, even stronger than before, and this time when Harry bent to kiss him Draco didn’t resist. The visceral grip of his emotions startled him a little but didn’t deter him: Harry stuck his tongue in Draco’s mouth with as much finesse as he was fucking him, and it didn’t matter it was sloppy because it reminded him how very alive he was in this moment. He took one of Draco’s hands and pressed it to the floor, linked their fingers together, moaned softly into his mouth. Draco hitched a leg up higher on Harry’s waist and trembled.
Hermione shifted uncomfortably, looking abashed. “Yes, and I very much regretted it afterwards. If you
“Draco,” Potter’s voice was gravelly. Draco wished he wouldn’t say his name like that. “I nearly killed you.”
Yet he was disappointed, too. The truth of the matter which Harry had come to realise was that he’d really enjoyed talking to Malfoy. This was an absurd notion, something that would have been laughable even just a week ago, but it remained a fact Harry couldn’t hide from himself. And while initially he’d done it purely (or what had
“Harry,” he said softly. He scooted down the bed until they were at eye-level and took Harry’s hand, then pressed a kissed to his palm. “It means the world to me that you’d want to show me your parents’ grave and the place where you were born. I only wish I could meet them.”
“You obviously weren’t joking,” Harry said in that you’re-not-as-good-at-hiding-things-as-you-think-you-are voice that Draco
“You told me yourself I don’t get to decide who’s forgiven, and you were right. I’m not some moral apex. I don’t know if you
"I love it," Harry insisted, "I love how open you've been with me, how easy it's been to talk to you. It's like there's this ... this whole thing between us we never noticed before, and I want ... I dunno, I wanna see what it is. Beyond the, you know ... the physical thing."
After another moment of silence, Malfoy said, in a soft voice, “He touched me.” One small hand indicated vaguely around his chest. Harry clenched his jaw. “Here. That was when I punched him.”
“No, it’s not right, Harry!” Granger shouted. She was pink in the cheeks, and Draco suddenly remembered a time, five years ago, when she had looked similarly before slapping him in the face.
Harry kissed him soundly, sucking at his lips and biting teasingly at the lower one, a vivid shock of heat coiling his belly tighter when Malfoy started fingering at the hem of his tee and then lifted it over his head. Those delicate, slightly cold hands immediately started mapping out his torso, but Harry didn’t give him long to explore before he was pressing Malfoy back onto the sofa and falling to his knees between his legs.
He clenched his jaw and looked up at the shelf. It was perhaps seven feet up, well out of Draco’s reach, and yet he stubbornly lifted onto his toes to give it a try anyway. Pointless, of course – his fingers merely brushed the edge, picking up a layer of dust in the process. He scowled and dropped back down, and he hadn’t even turned back around yet when from behind him someone said, “Need some help, Malfoy?”
something they'd done before, the only difference of course being that Draco was not in the body of a female this time. But it changed everything.
"Just once. Well, twice, but it was the same night." He laughed, but there wasn't much humour in it. "Actually I've been hit with all three of the Unforgivables."
That Friday, just over a week since he and Ron had had their row, Ginny cornered Harry after their morning Quidditch practice when he was coming out of the changing rooms, hair damp from a shower. She had toast in her hand, and Harry momentarily flashed back to being fourteen years old and stepping out of the Gryffindor portrait hole to find Hermione in a similar state.
“No. Thank you, Pansy, but I’ll keep this one on for now. The chill is getting to me and this thing works wonders for warding it off, hideous as it may be.”
“If that’s the case,” Harry retorted sharply, “you should stay as far away from me as possible, since
“Harry, there you are,” Hermione greeted him, pouring out a large glass of pumpkin juice as he sat down across the table. He took it gratefully and swallowed half of it down in a few large gulps, then began piling food onto his plate. “You didn’t see the notice that was posted in the common room when you left this morning, I expect?"
“You’re a right prick, Potter,” Malfoy bit out, but when he tried to walk away, Harry grabbed hold of his slim forearm and held him back. Malfoy turned back to him with a dangerous look on his face, like a snake who’d had its tail snatched.
He went to the window and sat down beside him. It was cushioned with green velvet that matched the curtains around the beds and looked exactly the same as the ones in his own dorm aside from the colour. Outside was an unimpeded view of the Hogwarts grounds, covered in a thick layer of snow and sparkling as prettily as if it had been enchanted to do so. The sight of it made Harry's chest ache with a potent combination of love and sadness.
fault for not falling for your stupid trick?” Potter scoffs. His hands are moving over the ground and Draco doesn’t bother letting him know the spectacles are at least five feet away.
“And stubborn,” Ron added helpfully. Harry rolled his eyes, but his lips found a smile regardless. “And completely self-righteous —”
think you’ve been acting incredibly immature these last couple years, and it’s only been getting worse.”
“You’re a cunt, Potter,” Draco muttered, trying and failing exquisitely to hide his breathlessness, nor the satisfaction of knowing he played a special role in something that meant as much to Potter as Quidditch.
In lieu of the sounds he couldn’t make, Draco simply nodded. For Harry, this seemed to be enough — he broke out in a grin that chased away the chill leftover in his bones from their terrible trip to Azkaban. The way Harry looked at him now made everything else irrelevant. It made Theo’s vendetta meaningless, made the prospect of dealing with the rest of the school’s reaction to their relationship seem like a small price to pay as long as Harry never,
“You,” was all Draco could manage to gasp out, flushing so hard at this wanton admission that it spread all the way down his neck, and god, he didn’t even
you to know me, Malfoy. The real me, not ... Harry Potter the Chosen One. And … I want to get to know you, too. As, you know, Draco.”
“Why the fuck do you think, Malfoy?” he growled. “I can’t eat your arse out here in front of The Red Lion, can I?”
Potter nodded stiltedly. “Yeah. He was … friends with my dad and Sirius and Lupin in school. Er — kind of …”
Malfoy lineages rest on my shoulders? According to my mother, my blood-tr — er — my cousin Nymphadora had a son before she died in the war.” Cheeks flushed, he knew Theo would be aware he’d been about to say 'blood-traitor cousin,' but he didn’t comment on the way Draco had broken off, merely seemed privately interested by the fact. “Don’t know who the father was, but he won’t have been a pure-blood, so their son is as good as a blood-traitor, probably a half-blood, as well, and even if he wasn’t, he would have taken his father’s name, not Black. My grandfather, Cygnus, only had daughters, so the Black name itself died off with my mother's cousins, Regulus and —”
“What are those scars?” he asked, nodding towards Weasley’s arms. Now that his attention had been drawn to one of them, he noticed there were half a dozen others, as well. Thin and white and hardly noticeable unless you looked closely.
“You’re a barbarian, Potter,” Draco sighed, nothing but fondness in his voice, and when Harry grinned, he did too. He raked his fingers through Harry’s hair mindlessly. “And I’m not going to get
Draco, half-hard, watched him light another and then took it when Harry offered it to him. He lit another for himself, looking completely, mind-meltingly hot for no reason at all as he checked to make sure he was doing it the right way.
"It was," says Draco quietly. It's not the whole truth, though. It isn't that black and white. Between them it never could be.
,” he said again, more sharply this time, but Draco only sank his mouth down as far as he could, sucking hard and closing his eyes when he felt Potter’s cock start pulsing against his tongue. Those hands were back in his hair as Potter’s hips ground up against him, shooting salty come down Draco’s throat in hot spurts. Draco swallowed down all of it,
“The new Herbology professor,” Malfoy says, finishing the sentence for him. “Yes. You can pick your jaw up off the floor now, Potter, you look more like a vapid tree frog than ever.”
"I love you too, Harry," he said, wondering in that dark corner of his brain if it would be the last time he could.
"I wouldn't have either," said Harry. "McGonagall's furious, she said she's gonna have to address it. Don't worry," he added when he saw the panic on Malfoy's face, "I'll talk to her, tell her not to make it a big deal or anything, that'll just be worse. I'm surprised that kid was able to ... you know, even
as upset about that as he'd have led them to believe. There were a lot worse things he'd deal with for his little boy.
“Father,” Draco said quickly, noting the dangerous look on Harry’s face, but before he could say anything else his father had spoken again:
The adrenaline of the punch wore off quickly, and when it was gone, it left nothing behind but a deep, empty-chested sadness that followed Draco all the way back to his dorm.
It was with shaking hands that Draco opened his letter, and in his mother’s own familiar calligraphy confirmed the impossible news. Somehow, his father’s sentence had been overturned. Life in Azkaban without parole … but no Kiss. According to his mother, the possibility of visitation would be revisited in six months’ time.
He looks in the mirror before leaving, taking more notice than he ever has before of Daphne's high, aristocratic cheekbones, the full lips, the cute upturned nose and shimmery blue eyes. She's really very pretty.
“Of course it fucking hurts,” he bit out, digging his nails in deeper and finding that he liked the way it seemed to spur Harry on. “Don’t stop.”
"He hasn't tried to talk to me," Draco retorts. His chest is tight suddenly, and his eyes are wet again but not from the cigarette. "He did
magic?” he demanded, unable to contain the note of awe in his voice. Something that felt very much like arousal prickled in his lower belly.
, wasn’t it?” Hermione said in a voice of forced casualness; beside her, Ron snorted into his own glass. She shot him a quick, disgusted look before leveling her watchful gaze back on Harry. “Just remember you’ve promised to cut yourself off after three —”
He saw nothing of the sort, and while it quelled that small, burning fear for now, it didn’t extinguish it entirely.
"He's sort of sweet like this, isn't he?" said Daphne, grinning at the way Draco had his face buried in Harry's neck at the moment.
“You’ve been up for a while,” Harry says. Draco narrows his eyes and knocks the side of his fist into Harry’s bicep.
“I said all right.” Harry raised an eyebrow at him, and even half-naked his presence and tone of voice was authoritative. “I’ll take care of it. I want you to wear that for me today, though.”
Mr and Mrs Weasley were there, along with George and Angelina, whom he was dating, Percy, Charlie and his girlfriend, Bill and Fleur and their newborn daughter Victoire, Andromeda Tonks with Harry's godson Teddy, Ginny and her new boyfriend, Luna and Xenophilius Lovegood, Hermione's parents, as well as Narcissa Malfoy.
He kept coming back to the Room of Requirement, but he didn't tell Draco that. He'd check it out himself first, and if it still worked, then he'd bring it up.
find their way to Malfoy’s arse, and his tits if Nott’s feeling bold, apparently. I can’t tell if Malfoy knows — on one hand, he doesn’t seem the type who would like being looked at like a piece of meat that way, but then again, Malfoy always
lapping at his legs as he pressed his head to Potter’s back, closed his eyes, and prayed to come out of it alive.
Feeling rather as though he must be dreaming, Draco merely stared at Weasley, having lost his ability to formulate words, let alone follow a rational train of thought. But Weasley seemed to have seen his confusion, because his cheeks darkened with colour. He didn’t, however, look away. To his credit, he looked stubbornly resolute.
“Harry!” he hissed. His cheeks bloomed with heat and he tried to close his legs unsuccessfully. “What the fuck do you think you’re doing?!”
Draco intentionally went to bed early every night the next few days, so even if Harry did get home at a somewhat reasonable hour he was already tucked away, precluding the possibility of sex. Normally if Harry was feeling randy it wouldn’t matter, he’d get into bed and his warm hands would coerce Draco from his light sleep just enough to engage properly in a lazy fuck before they both passed out for good, only he didn’t do that this week. And though Draco was
"So he is sleeping with her," Draco confirms. Weasley looks suddenly unsure of himself and Hermione's shooting him a glare.
He recognises Harry's voice the moment he steps out of the Floo into Ron and Hermione's flat. It's coming from the kitchen, deep and indistinct but clearly animated as he usually is around his best friends.
the worst thing in the world happened, if she couldn't handle this and she left," he said, looking intently into Draco's eyes, "I would still love you and I would still love this baby and you will always,
Draco flopped back onto the bed and threw an arm across his face, overtly aware of the throbbing between his legs.
“Wake me when you get home,” said Draco. Harry smiled, and Draco was surprised to learn that he could still get butterflies.
The weather as Harry boarded the Hogwarts Express Saturday morning was cruelly indifferent to his inner turmoil: the sky was a uniform, pellucid blue that reflected itself merrily in the dark windows of the train. Nor was there any hint of clouds — just the relentless glare of a winter sun, making the snow on the ground glimmer so brightly Harry had to look away lest he go blind.
She looked at him quizzically, but Harry could see it as understanding bloomed in her eyes, as she began fitting puzzle pieces together and seeing a much bigger picture than the one she’d no-doubt been struggling over lately.
“Merlin, I’m really sorry, Hermione,” he said into her hair. “I’ve been a shit friend to you this year, haven’t I?”
“This is arse-backwards, Potter!” Malfoy hissed, voice low to avoid anyone inside hearing them (although it was doubtful over the blaring music). Fist still clutched around the Snitch, he whacked the back of his hand into Harry’s shoulder. “You can’t just fuck me for a week straight and
It was delicate and excruciatingly sweet, the way Potter leaned forward to brush their lips together. Draco let his eyes flutter closed and tried hard to ignore his heart in his throat.
Over the next few weeks, as December approached and brought with it frigid temperatures and a massive increase in homework, Harry began noticing a small shift. Goyle was seen around Malfoy significantly less, something he learned was due to some remedial lessons that were being forced on him by the teachers whose classes he was in danger of failing. Quite a few, apparently. This information was shared with him by Lavender, who had been told by Tracey, who had allegedly spoken to Pansy about it.
"Then what is it?" Harry asks. He's frowning, concentrating on Draco with his whole being, and that feeling is just as intense as it always is. "What did I do that made you so unhappy?"
“Thank you for waiting, Draco.” The door to the little office in which Draco had been waiting, stripped down and forced into a hospital gown, opened up on Healer Penbroke clutching a thick wad of files and wearing a slight frown. Draco shifted anxiously where he sat on the examination table, barely able to meet her gaze. When she looked at him, her eyes were as warm and understanding as always, but something troubled had clouded them over. “Hop on down from there and have a seat with me.”
while he was pregnant, at which point both of them had positively lit up at the reminder that Draco was carrying their baby.
"Also," says Potter, pressing in lightly with his thumb and dragging a helpless whingeing noise out of Draco's throat. "I found out pretty early on Daphne doesn't like being choked."
"Completely." His cheeks darkened even further and he slid along the wall like he was preparing to dart around Harry and make a run for it, only Harry kept up with him, blocking his way. "Get out of my way, Potter."
"He is," said Hermione softly. She stood up from her chair and motioned for Harry to do the same, then looped her arms around his neck. He hugged her back, sharing a private grin with Ron over her shoulder. "You're such a good person, Harry. Ron and I are going to be here for both of you no matter what."
Hermione asked, amusement dancing in her eyes even as a hand moved to cover her mouth and hide her giggle.
“Well, Draco, you said you’re seeing somebody, right? Is he … I mean … considering what you look like at the moment, he can’t be …?”
from me?" asks Draco hysterically, voice pitched higher than usual and unsteady. He knows he sounds like he's begging, and maybe he is. "What the
"You're just a tad over 175 centimetres," she said. "I couldn't make any sort of good guess at this point as to why your height remains affected, that's something we'll investigate in the coming weeks and months in your follow-up visits. It's possible the cure targeted more of the severe symptoms of the hex, genitals and bone structure and organs, leaving your height as ... something of an afterthought, I suppose you might think of it. But again, it's very hard to say. We'll be focusing on that and try to get you an answer, Draco."
“Yeah, Malfoy worships his dad,” Ron added, as though determined to say something useful. “Plus, did you see the
“Course.” Harry’s arms tightened around him, some of his thick, wild hair brushing gently across Draco’s cheek. “You want me to walk you to Slughorn’s office under the Cloak?”
,” Ron said stiffly, standing up as well and dropping a protective arm across Hermione’s shoulders. “Slow down, mate.”
but certainly more forcefully than last time, and Draco lets out a choked sound of consent. Every other stroke his prostate is being stimulated, he's struggling just to get breath in his lungs, and somehow that heightens everything he's feeling, makes it all sharper and more distinct and
“Jesus, Potter!” he sniped, but when he tried to squirm away, Harry stopped him with strong hands around his waist. “Has anyone ever told you how
"Look," Harry said, planting a kiss on his cheek and then pulling away to grab a Butterbeer for himself as well. "If this is a grand gesture in your eyes then fine, I lied. But I only meant for it to be something small for us, without everyone else. Label or no label, whatever the hell you feel like calling this that makes you happy, it's
, Harry?" He laughed, and it sounded crazed. "God, do you know what you sound like? That slimy git nearly got my brother
"You did the best you could, Harry, I'm really proud of you," Hermione assured him. "That's all anybody can do if neither of them will listen."
Taking his Cloak with him and using the Map as an extra precaution to avoid running into anybody, Harry only shed it once he’d stepped inside the humid air of the mammoth bathroom, seeing that the tub was filled with steaming water, yet remained empty.
“Be gone, then,” Harry says with a wave. He puffs on his joint and tries not to feel sad. Draco must have believed him, because he’s grinning to himself as he readies to leave. And he likes that Draco’s happy, at least, even if he’d prefer to be the one doing it.
"Come on," said Harry, looking at Goyle and nodding towards the oak front doors. He would deal with Draco later, in private — right now his main concern was getting Goyle back to the common room. He kept shooting worrying glares at Ryan, who was shooting them back. Hermione and Daphne were gathering up all their things from under the beech tree.
"I literally don’t know how else I can explain it to you, Potter,” said Malfoy quietly. His hand moved slowly up and down the hard line of Harry’s cock, thumbing over the head and drawing a broken sound out of him. “You just defeated the greatest Dark wizard of the last century; if that doesn’t make you feel like fucking someone, I don’t know what else possibly could.”
Draco didn’t answer right away. He glanced at the bottle of wine on the table and thought about the way it always tasted a little sweeter on Harry’s lips.
“You did tell me you thought he’d had feelings for me a long time, though, back when I first told you about this in the library.”
"How did you know it was me and not someone else?" he manages to find his voice to ask. Potter only grins maddeningly. "Did you already know when you ... before?"
She takes in a deep breath, but after a moment she does indeed stand up. He feels simultaneously relieved and disappointed. The company is good for keeping him out of his head, although he supposes the point is defeated when she won't stop yapping on about all of it.
, bound at his lower back, just one of Harry’s hands sufficient to keep them there. The other was pressed to the wall beside Draco’s head. “You want me to treat you like a needy little slut, Draco? Will you quit
, I’m not taking the mickey or anything. Anyway, I talked to him earlier, after he’d spoken with his mum. I just …” He bit his lip, chewing away thoughtfully as he tried to find a way of making it sound urgent without revealing anything that didn’t need revealing at this moment. “I think it would mean a lot to Draco if he was able to ... see his dad while he's in this body before it gets to a point where Lucius might not be able to recognise him anymore.”
Harry burst into laughter. Draco rolled his eyes, fighting a grin. Being reintroduced to Mr and Mrs Weasley had been horribly awkward at first and he'd thought he might actually choke on all his guilt when he thought about how he'd been indirectly responsible for the state of their eldest son's face, but Harry had been there the whole time holding his hand, maintaining a steady, reassuring presence, and in the end it had been all right. Mrs Weasley took to Leo with every bit as much enthusiasm as Ron had predicted, perhaps more. She was instantly enamored with the mess of dark hair and green eyes, the pudgy cheeks and utterly heart-melting giggle.
Malfoy arched up obediently to let Harry drag his trousers and pants down his long, slender legs, and at the sight of his stiff, leaking cock curved up against his tight stomach, dribbling pre-come onto the sparse trail of fine blond hair leading down from his navel, Harry felt a little bit of his sanity drain away.
“Then you’ll be my beautiful son who looks more like me than his father these days, and I’ll love you just the same as I always have.”
Narcissa napped after her shower and he and Draco, with Teddy's limited but enthusiastic help, put together a sprawling dinner. Narcissa didn't eat much of it, but that was partly because she wouldn't stop holding Draco's hand with both of her own. Draco seemed unwilling to let go of hers either.
He speeds up and every brutal thrust is ecstasy, every push back inside is absolution. Draco lifts his muddy hands to Potter’s face and smears it on his cheeks, his lips, his glasses, the last of which he pulls off his face so there’s nothing between him and those messianic green eyes gouging his bare soul. When they kiss again he tastes rain and dirt and salvation.
But Malfoy was apparently already finished with the conversation, because he gave Harry another horribly stony stare. “Just don’t, Potter.” The tears were there again, still being held back but shimmering noticeably in his eyes, and Harry felt a very familiar sense of helplessness that always plagued him in situations he couldn’t control. “For once in your life, keep your enormous head
"No, erm — we're staying here, actually. All of us, Ron and Hermione and me ... it's our last year at Hogwarts, y'know? We thought it'd be fun."
The problem is, he never does. Draco has to fight not to let the shock and disappointment show on his face when Potter actually
"You're not in trouble," she said. "I'm going to go deal with him. It seems we're going to have to address this issue with Mr Malfoy more formally ... Oh, I don't look forward to telling Filius about this ..." She walked away with a sigh and Harry finally went into the Infirmary, where he saw Malfoy lying on a bed at the far end of the wing.
"I like ... being around you," Harry said, shrugging modestly. "I like how you're always blushing around me lately —"
. Enjoyable, even. Loathe as he was to admit it, Draco adored having Potter’s eyes on him. He loved the hunger he saw there, and as Potter had so coyly pointed out, Draco loved the way Potter seemed to radiate life and passion and powerful magic. For Draco, whose world had once burned bright with the warm glow of family, was now as cold and desolate as his father’s cell in Azkaban.
Harry, appetite gone, found that he couldn't rid himself of the mental image of Malfoy with his face lowered, as if the best he could do was hope they didn't hurt him too badly. It made him feel sick.
, you know?” To his amazement — and endless encouragement — he saw a nascent smile begin to form on Hermione’s face. “Does that sound crazy?”
Up in his bedroom, Draco throws on one of Harry’s Weasley jumpers with a big ‘H’ on it that he’d stolen several weeks ago, which Harry has never protested. Draco wearing his jumper and nothing else is decidedly all right with him. He himself merely pulls off his jeans before climbing into bed with Draco and his ridiculously endearing Snitch-covered sheets. He pulls him in for a kiss immediately that keeps a slow pace like before. His toes curl and his cock twitches in interest as he feels the texture of Draco’s chapped lip and reminds himself what the back of his teeth taste like. Draco slips a hand beneath his hoodie and plays with the trail of hair he finds above Harry’s boxers.
“Including yourself?” Harry cut him off loudly. Still holding Draco’s hand tightly within his much larger one, he stepped forward and lifted his wand so it was pointing directly at Theo’s chest. “What did you think was gonna happen, Nott?” he said contemptuously. “You thought you’d blackmail me into saving your father? Thought you might get a fuck out of it as well if you played your cards right with Draco? You’re pathetic. Get out of my fucking sight before I decide to let McGonagall know what you’ve been up to and get you expelled. And for the record, I’d have expected a Slytherin to be better at blackmail. This was just embarrassing.”
"No," she said, eyes flashing. Harry clenched his jaw. "I don't think I need to tell you that this has evolved into an extremely serious situation. You realise, Potter, that this student very likely learned how to use the curse last year, during ..." She stopped, and her face lost a little bit of colour. She looked suddenly as old as Dumbledore, and exhausted. "You weren't here, Potter. Thank
He handed the Cloak back once they were in the corridor — the whole school knew now. There was no point hiding himself. It took Granger two minutes to come climbing out of the portrait hole with her cloak in hand. She was a smaller person herself, but it still hung loose when Draco put it on, and while things like this had ceased to surprise him anymore, he still pitched a weary sigh when the sleeves fell just slightly past his fingers.
been. Because his adoptive family had quite literally starved a twelve-year-old boy and kept him locked up like some sort of sub-human creature.
to. Because whether they were fucking in his unlocked office or Harry was a million miles away saving everyone from a new Dark Lord, nobody filled Draco’s empty places the way Harry did.
He followed Potter to a sink that had a minuscule snake etched into the copper tap. The hairs on the back of his neck stood up.
In the meantime, Madam Hooch had overzealously agreed to reinstate Harry as captain of the Gryffindor Quidditch team. He wasn’t, however, fond of the idea that his recent defeat of Voldemort might have had something to do with her over-the-top enthusiasm, and he’d had to remind himself he’d gotten this position a couple years ago even without having slain an evil dictator.
Draco knew what was going to happen and still wasn’t able to do anything about it when Harry threw off the Cloak and pressed his wand right into Theo’s throat, backing him up several steps while his eyes bulged with shock and his mouth fell comically open.
“Of course,” Draco drawled, though there was no hint of real disdain in his voice. “Famous Potter, from the Chosen One to Undesirable Number One, it’s always
as pointy when he wasn't a bloke, it wasn't the same. No offence, Malfoy, but I prefer you this way."
Draco turns a subdued sneer on her before looking away again. He hates the smugness in her voice. Some part of him recognises it isn't

satisfying?” he said softly, taking one of Draco’s hands and brushing their fingers together maddeningly, so Draco could feel every callous, every rough patch of skin on Potter’s hand. The pads of his fingers skimmed over Draco’s palm, up the length of each digit, reverent in his exploration. And then, finally twining their fingers together, he leaned forward once more, warm breath ghosting across Draco’s ear. “When I was stealing it right out from under your fingers, Malfoy.”
have a vague, unpleasant memory of the Dark Lord mentioning this once in the drawing room, antagonising Bellatrix and his mother about their niece marrying a werewolf. At the time, Draco hadn’t put it together — he’d been too busy being horrified by his predicament. Now it hit him like a bludger to the head.
Potter shrugs again. He looks more interested in studying Draco than talking about his triumphs of nature.
"He's coming!" Ron hissed, and Hermione quickly levitated the surprise cake she and Draco had spent the last hour decorating into the pantry where Harry wouldn't see it. Ron was panting, as if he'd sprinted ahead to warn them, which Draco didn't doubt.
“Aye, m’lady,” he nodded loosely, toothy grin the very essence of everything Harry had ever come to enjoy about his Irish roommate. “Just a wee bit. Only way to celebrate, ain’t it? What d’you say, Potter?”
“I know you’re not a bloody woman, Malfoy,” Potter interjected. “I know that. I get it. Christ, do you think I could forget who you are?”
"Oh, they wouldn't have if I hadn't hounded them," Hermione assured him. Ron made a throaty noise of outrage.
Harry exhales a deep sigh. "I still don't understand what changed," he says, his voice having taken on a note of defeat. "We were so good, Draco."
with Theo. And Theo has for some time been harbouring suspicions about Potter and me. It was his luck the prat happened to be invisible behind me when he confronted me about it again. I might have been able to salvage the situation if Potter hadn’t jumped out from under the Cloak to play hero.”
In spite of both their arousal it tapers off to soft pecks and Draco’s hand finds its way to Harry’s hair instead where he begins playing with it. Harry reaches for Draco’s wrist and feels the watch there, then looks at his own. He feels more content and relaxed than he has in a week.
There's a moment of silence in which Draco assumes they're communicating with their eyes. He refuses to look up and check.
Draco shifted uncomfortably where he stood, taken aback not for the first time by Potter and everything he stood for. Everything he
Malfoy’s mouth dropped open to Harry’s utter delight, and because it was just too much fun crawling beneath Malfoy’s skin and watching him squirm, Harry pulled off his own shirt, unbelted his denims, and tossed both to the side, leaving him in a pair of plain black boxers, cotton as opposed to the silk he'd seen Malfoy wearing before he'd put his shirt back on.

"Twelve," Hermione corrected him unnecessarily; it was a habit Draco thought she simply couldn't help. "First of September is the cut-off date, you have to already
Currently however he was on Harry's lap, a thumb in his mouth as he looked around with sleepy yet still alert green eyes. Draco was curled up in an armchair next to them, also looking sleepy. Ron, Luna, and Ginny were on the sofa, Hermione still happily chatting away with her parents and Xenophilius.
Harry drops his head back and takes a hit, pulling the smoke into his lungs, holding it there, and then blowing it out towards the ceiling. He watches with fascination as it joins seamlessly with the larger cloud. He’s become completely neutralised to the smell of the weed but he keeps getting whiffs of Draco’s shampoo, a brand new one he keeps raving about that’s supposed to work all kinds of wonders on his scalp and hair follicles. All Harry really gives a shit about, though, is that Draco’s smelled like coconut lately, which he very much likes.
Potter's laughing softly, rhythmically burying his fingers in Draco's arse, amused apparently by Draco's incoherency. Still, he can hear Potter breathing hard and knows he's not the only one achingly turned on.
. As the seconds tick by his stomach contracts in on itself, making him feel sick. He stays in there another few minutes, collecting himself, deciding what he can possibly do, which turns out to be ... well,
Despite his draining enthusiasm for learning to cast a proper Patronus, Draco still looked forward to Wednesday nights more than any other night of the week. There was a part of him which he thought might never quite get used to his eagerness for Potter’s company, but for the most part, he’d begun allowing himself to simply enjoy it.
Wasting no time, Draco pulled Potter’s cock out of the confines of his slacks and marveled at the weight of it in his hand. The head was flushed dark red and sticky with pre-come, and when Draco brushed a thumb across it, he felt Potter’s hips twitch.
Those words make Draco's heart hurt. He turns slowly in Harry's arms and looks up at him, into his eyes and then down to his mouth, and when he kisses him it feels a little like giving in. He breaks away so he can pull off Harry's Quidditch robes and then dives back in, mapping out the warm, tanned skin of his chest under his cotton T-shirt with eager hands, fingering every small scar whose location he knows by heart, whose shapes and textures he'd memorised a long time ago.
After Christmas tea, he, Malfoy, Ron, and Hermione sat around in the common room for a couple of hours, Ron and Malfoy playing chess, Hermione contentedly knitting, Harry going back and forth watching the game and watching Malfoy. They were back on the same sofa next to one another, close enough that their thighs were almost touching and that Harry could once again smell the delicate scent of his soap.

After finishing a makeup year at Hogwarts and graduating with only one less N.E.W.T. than Hermione, Malfoy had, in spite of his déclassé name (and because of his excellent marks), managed an entry-level job at the Ministry in the Department of International Magical Cooperation. Within four years he’d risen far enough that he’d become a prominent figure in the Department, and had apparently been hand-chosen by the Department Head — Cadmus Bosley — to represent him tonight when his Israeli counterpart came in.
Harry hardly slept that night, and the next morning Malfoy didn't come down for breakfast. He said nothing to either Ron or Hermione, and that afternoon he and Ron went out to the pitch for a few hours where Harry spent most of the time trying not to think of the night before and failing completely. Hermione told them when they came back that Malfoy had seemed weird and jittery when he came down and that he'd gone right back up to his room after a quick lunch.
He loosened them but didn't let go as he lifted his head and looked down at Malfoy, his brain sluggish, skin buzzing, his cock still softening while aftershocks made his nerves tingle.
Commencement took place the day after everyone else left for London on the Hogwarts Express. Because it didn't fucking matter anymore, Harry and Draco spent the night in the Room of Requirement.
"You sure you're okay?" Harry said again, grabbing his wand and spelling away the come dribbling out of Draco's arse.
Harry’s smile faltered and he shifted onto his side, so they were facing one another. His eyebrows dipped and he searched Draco’s face — Draco felt his cheeks turning rapidly pink under this scrutiny.
“Are you serious?” Potter said after a moment where he appeared to be studying Draco’s face, the taunt left ignored. “It’s not a
He nearly said yes. It was a close thing, and that in itself was cause for some self-reflection. In the end, however, he simply couldn’t manage to talk himself into staying put.
Stubbornly clutching the dragon’s blood, Draco tried to manoeuvre his way around Potter and out of the cupboard, only to have his path blocked. He had to close his eyes and pull in a deep, steadying breath in order to calm himself. This was not only humiliating, but threw into sharp relief the difference that time had made of Golden Boy. Once, when they were eleven and twelve years old, Draco could have shoved his way past Potter.
The moment the common room has cleared out and he sees Potter going up to his dorm, Draco goes to his own and drinks the potion.
Malfoy opened his mouth like he was going to argue and then seemed to fall short of anything to say. Instead, he smacked Harry’s arm again, harder this time.
"All right," Harry nodded. He dropped a kiss on Malfoy's cheek before leaving and heading back to Ron out on the pitch.
This was a living nightmare. Perhaps not in the same way having the Dark Lord living in his family's home had been, nor the same way watching his father be sent to Azkaban and his mother sentenced to house arrest had been, but it was a nightmare of its own special brand.
After a moment, Draco said, “No.” Potter didn’t seem surprised by this, nodding as though it was what he’d expected.
“This must be nice,” he said, eyes moving from one piece of furniture to the next, smiling to himself each time he saw something that spoke to Malfoy’s personality. Sheets of parchment were on the little desk, but they weren’t haphazard — a neat pile of them sat off to one side while one remained in the middle, half-covered with writing, a quill set down on top of it like Malfoy had stopped before he’d finished. A bottle of green ink sat nearby. “I mean — having your own room.”
“Some loony in the village claims they saw a ‘suspicious figure’ heading up towards the school last night,” Harry said offhandedly, leaning back against one of the workstations and grinning at Draco. “You know, you have dirt on your face.”
"Of course, yeah," agrees Potter, sitting on his bed in just his red pants. His glasses are back on his nose and Draco can see sweat still glistening on his skin. His cheeks are flushed. He looks ...
“You know,” Ginny began, nodding inconspicuously towards the Slytherin table, “you would think some of them might at least
Meanwhile, Harry felt as if he would burst right out of his skin every time he thought about his and Malfoy’s last meeting in the Prefects’ bath. It still seemed surreal, to know Malfoy had, in very plain words, told Harry he liked him back. There was something taboo about it that somehow inflated Harry’s excitement and enthusiasm; this wasn’t just any blossoming relationship, after all — it was
forgiven him!” Harry roared. His fists curled into balls at his sides, like he was barely restraining himself from lunging. “Because he
"Right." Hesitant to leave but even more hesitant to stay, Harry lifted his bag onto his shoulder. "Well, I'll see you later then, Malfoy."
It was Wednesday when he finally lost the struggle over his own self-control, and it was because Harry Potter was and always
“Fuck, shit,” Harry muttered, plucking it out from between his lips and, with a roll of his eyes, chucking it perfectly into a bin some ten feet away. “Why do I do that every time?”
“You’re completely mad if you think I’m forgetting about this, Hermione,” Harry said tightly, pushing away from the wall. “I’m gonna talk to him again this week, see if I can’t get a name out of him.”
Harry was quiet for a minute, absorbing this highly logical trail of thought Hermione had followed, trying to let it sink in. It did make some sort of sense, that much was difficult to argue, yet knowing that didn’t make it all that much easier to digest.
"He's obviously attractive," snaps Pansy, voice still lowered. "But I have no interest in shagging him."
“I’ll keep that in mind,” Harry chuckled, standing up as well and eyeing Malfoy with a raised brow. “Does this mean I’ll be seeing you more often, then?”
”) and a lingering tightness in his chest. He was half convinced Pansy or Blaise would sense something, but while Blaise did give him a searching look at breakfast, Pansy was so busy prattling on about the holidays that Draco felt convinced she wouldn’t have noticed if he’d been wearing an orange wig.
to you,” the boy growled when Draco remained silent, looking up at him with defiant eyes and a set mouth but nothing to say. “Don’t you have anything to say for yourself, Malfoy? Your father
When it was over, Potter fell back against the chair with an arm thrown across his face and his cock softening against his stomach. Draco wiped delicately at his lips, as if he’d been enjoying nothing more than a popsicle, and raised an eyebrow from where he still sat on the floor between Potter’s legs. After several seconds Potter removed his arm and looked down, appearing utterly bewildered by what had just happened.
Harry didn’t answer right away, though. He’d buried his face in Draco’s neck and was breathing heavily, finally pulling out after a minute of letting his pulse presumably settle.
"You will come with me immediately," Harry heard McGonagall say, her voice loud but steady. "You too, Mr Langley.
Draco frowned deeply, despising absolutely everything about that sentence. He felt colour blooming tellingly on his cheeks, and Weasley looked far too smug to have missed it.
He sees shock on Malfoy’s face and only half a second before he drops the pot Harry realises what’s about to happen, darting forwards to catch it before it can explode on the ground.
him except that he grew up in a world that is utterly foreign to me. If anything, Harry … it sounds like you’re the one who understands him quite a bit more than you think. Enough to feel comfortable opening up to him about the war in a way you haven’t done with anyone else. Isn’t that what you said?”
"Yeah. I knew things would be ... the way they are. It's weird, because compared to Azkaban it's, like, you know, a bloody holiday. But I'm just ..." He broke off and shook his head, like he couldn't find a word powerful enough to express whatever it was he was trying to say. "I'm always
“We have to watch this last film,” he says. His lips move on Draco’s skin as he says it and his bottom lip brushes the velvet. His libido stirs, his cock twitching. “Make it an even thirty-one.”
Prepared to barricade himself in his dorm for the remainder of the year if he has to, Draco pushes off the wall to leave only to have his wrist grabbed. Even back in his own body, Potter can fit his fingers all the way around it. Draco rips it out of his grip, which isn't difficult as he hadn't been holding on very tightly. He's furious and ashamed and absolutely
"Yeah, that's right. Well ... probably one of the mouldy beds at Grimmauld Place, actually, I doubt we'll find a good place by tomorrow night. But yeah." He turned his head and kissed Draco soundly. "Definitely together, wherever we end up being."
like the attention, do you?” Draco asked, pressing his cold hands between his thighs. (It was still stranger than strange to feel his tits press together when he did this.) The flickering of the bluebell flame cast shadows on Potter’s face, making him look much older than he was, almost as if what Draco was seeing now was the man behind the mask. The person most of the Wizarding world didn’t
"I dunno," Draco said honestly. His free hand went to his belly, and that afforded him some comfort. He didn't know if it was a boy or a girl or some kind of alien life form in there but he did know that he loved it very much, and that as scary as this felt it had to be worth it. For five months now he'd been sharing his life and his body with this person inside of him. That meant something. That meant
It was nearing nine o’clock when Theo came back up from dinner, and he was carrying a plate of food.
. And I know you told Hermione, because every time I bring it up she goes quiet and changes the subject.”
Before Draco could say anything else, Potter had dipped away, back towards his group of friends, towards his real life. Draco stayed hidden among the shelves another few minutes before going back to his table and, instead of finishing his essay like he’d planned, he packed up his things and went to meet Pansy and Blaise at lunch.
Harry took out his wand and tapped the letter, fixing the smeared ink and the wrinkled parchment. "I'll take care of it," he said. "Just send it when you finish. You have an eagle owl, right? You'll be using that one?"
"I'll eat my wand if he even looks at it again before the last day of the holidays," said Hermione when he was gone. She managed somehow to make it sound sickeningly fond.
“I’m your best mate, Harry,” Ron said bracingly, and he even clapped Harry on the back with a grin. “Even if I don’t wanna hear it, it’s my duty to hear it anyway.”
“Harry.” It was Granger — she had pushed her way through the spectators and was now touching Harry’s shoulder. “Let’s just go, okay?”
A long silence ensued, Theo still watching him, Draco meeting his gaze and wondering what was going on inside that esoteric mind of his.
doing here, Potter?” His father’s voice had dipped to a sultry, antagonistic tone. “Scrambling for anything to get your face in the news now that the Dark Lord is gotten rid of?”
"You is too skinny, sir!" squeaked one of the elves with a look of disapproval almost uncannily like Hermione's. "You is taking more!"
His hair was styled differently too, perhaps having let Parkinson do it for him. Whatever the case, it was a bit more feminine, pixie-looking, and suited his bone structure.
They spent a week in Grimmauld Place before they found a flat they liked. A week after that, Harry began Auror training. In mid-August Draco finally found a job with an apothecary whose owner was too impressed with his skill to turn him away because of who he was.
Draco started off slow, running his lips across the skin on the inside of Potter’s thigh, inhaling the smell and letting it fuel the heat inside his belly. Potter’s fingers were alternately gripping and loosening on his hair, but it wasn’t until he started mouthing at the underside of his cock — running his tongue along the thick vein he found there — that he felt Potter’s nails against his skull.
No more than a week later, as Harry was heading down to dinner late, he was stopped by the Fat Friar, who appeared to be in quite a panic.
It was not fucking, he realised suddenly, when Harry gasped into his ear and stilled, reining himself back in. This was lovemaking — gentle, torturous,
Hermione, lips pursed and eyes narrowed, took a handful of Floo Powder from a vase on the mantel and disappeared into the green flames. Harry looked around at the glass all over his floor and, with a deep, resentful sigh, went to clean it up.
. No sooner had the word left his mouth — the feeling of saying it easing a little bit of Azkaban’s cold from his bones — than his father was shooting up from his chair and coming around the table. Before Draco could even think about reacting, Harry had stepped in front of him, and the very air inside the room seemed to crackle with magic. They’d had to submit their wands when they’d entered, yet it was abundantly clear right now that should Harry decide he wanted to do to magic, he would be more than capable of doing it.
Harry didn’t say anything in response to this; he bent his head to touch a kiss to Draco’s lips and then wiped a stray tear away from his cheek.
“Congratulations,” says Draco scornfully, and he casts yet another jinx that Potter blocks too easily. “Only a troll would’ve figured it out slower than you, Potter.”
you can’t tell me.” She kissed his forehead and wiped a tear away from his cheek with the pad of her thumb. “Nothing in this world could ever make me stop loving you. You are my
in ... well, he'd never seen him do it at all in a way that wasn't malicious, and actually it was quite nice. It didn't entirely erase that lingering aura of defeat, like something inside him had died, but it certainly lessened the effect.
The chair is definitely made for one person, but that hasn’t stopped Draco from making himself comfortable on Harry’s lap in an entitled manner reminiscent of Crookshanks. In fact Crookshanks, in Harry’s opinion, looks a bit annoyed at the stolen bit of real estate. He’s contented himself with Ron’s lap but he’s watching Draco with an almost human expression of contempt.
It was not unheard of to see inter-house mingling just a month after term began, nor was it only Gryffindor, Ravenclaw, and Hufflepuff doing so. Dean and Seamus were consistently seen hanging around Stephen Cornfoot of Ravenclaw, while, incredibly, and to the surprise of most, Daphne Greengrass and Tracey Davis had been seen getting chummy with Lavender Brown, Parvati Patil, and their little group of friends. Neville, meanwhile, had begun spending an awful lot of time around Hannah Abbott.
.” He shook his head, the tears returning in spite of his every effort to hold them back. Unable to meet Harry’s eyes suddenly, he tried to drop his gaze, only for Harry’s fingers to appear under his chin and stop him from doing so.
like, Harry thought, watching with his jaw open as Malfoy’s face started slowly but very noticeably shifting, like the bones beneath it were rearranging themselves.
Teddy, having grown bored of his pile of sticks, came toddling over and caught himself before he fell on Harry's knees. He looked up at him, smiled toothily, and suddenly his hair turned pitch black and he was making grabby-hands like he wanted Harry to pick him up.
He waited to see if Harry would say anything else but he didn’t. He only stared at Draco expectantly, arms folded, in all ways closed off.
“Harry —” he started, but broke off when an article of clothing was tossed to him across the room. He held it up and his cheeks regained their colour. It was a pleated white skirt, the same one he’d been wearing when Harry had eaten him out in that empty classroom. A lifetime ago, it felt like.
always that good, he can't blame Daphne for doing everything she can to make sure it keeps happening. Potter smirks, eyes shining with amusement.
"Tell me why you did it." Potter steps closer again and when Draco tries to step back he realises there's a wall behind him. Potter closes in on him, near enough Draco can smell him. "Tell me what the fuck was going through your head when you decided to Polyjuice into Daphne to get me to fuck you." His words are sharp but he doesn't sound
Draco let out a world-weary sigh and pinched the bridge of his nose. Knowing Harry was right, and hating it all the same. Several long moments later, he nodded and went back to the door, Harry disappearing into the en suite. “Come in, then,” he said to Pansy, and shut the door behind her. He went to his bed and sat down on the edge, but Pansy stayed standing uncomfortably in the middle of the room, arms folding tightly across her chest.
of it. His overworked mind was playing odd tricks on him. Malfoy was leaning back against the wall, arms crossed, white blond hair in disarray and ashy with smoke from the fire. There was a smudge of it under one eye, as well. He stared at Harry with a single eyebrow lifted, challenging.
The nearest toilet was just down the corridor, and it was after a moment’s deliberation — where Draco decided running into a group of boys would be far worse — that he went inside the girls’.
“I bear you no grudge, Theo,” said Draco eventually. Theo relaxed by a merest degree in his seat, and this was enough to make Draco feel as though they were on even footing again. “And I truly am sorry to hear about your father. Please pass my condolences on to your grandmother, what little they might mean.”
"Right, well, I should probably drag myself to Hogsmeade after all since I've got plenty of time," says Draco, shrugging his robes on and pulling Daphne's long hair out from the back. The cunt between his legs is still throbbing, and he can still feel his heartbeat in that little bundle of nerves Potter had been stimulating so relentlessly. "Astoria may not deserve the gift but

By the time he walked into the Great Hall to find Ron wolfing down kippers and eggs and Hermione reading the morning’s
before the anxious energy consumed him whole. His hands started shaking again; a frown-line had creased his mother’s brow, but for a moment she said nothing, merely stared at him. “Harry …
Draco let out a soft, embarrassing whimper and let Harry spin them around and press him against the door, cheek-first. He undid his flies himself and Harry tugged them down his legs and off his feet, allowing Draco to spread them slightly. Harry’s fingers were there immediately, sliding slick between his cheeks and over his hole. The memory of Harry’s hands on the guitar was still so fresh, his fingers changing chords effortlessly, sacrificing them to blisters and callouses and roughened skin for the music they created, and Draco closed his eyes against a fresh wave of arousal and another pang of emotion.
The soft smile on Harry’s face faded a little bit at these words. “Why don’t you finish eating first?”
Draco furiously continues fighting back any telltale sighs of emotion on his face, and he knows Harry sees this, because he rolls his eyes and bends to kiss Draco again, this time on the mouth.
“Theo,” Draco greeted him, attempting nonchalance and just barely attaining it. He was sure his eyes must be red from crying. “If you don’t mind, I’d rather talk later.” He gave him a small nod and kept walking, only for Theo to step in front of his path.
," said Harry, "it's just that they all really like it whereas you find it threatening for some reason."
"Okay," says Draco slowly. He's barely restraining himself from looking at Potter's mouth. His head is swimming, grasping for a foothold in this unanticipated turn of events. "So what now?"
She nodded, as if he’d confirmed her suspicions. Eyes still a little teary, she broke out into a brilliant smile that warmed Harry’s chest.
"He's in no shape to have dealt with something like that," Pomfrey said fiercely. "The curse itself does no physical damage but the thrashing around ... the victim can often become injured as a byproduct ..." She was hovering her wand over him, ostensibly checking that this hadn't happened. "Thought I'd seen the last of it ... an Unforgivable ... after
Harry shrugged but didn't deny it, because he thought it was probably true. "Well I'm sure that's what they'll want in an Auror, right?"
Draco makes a game of kissing his neck while he’s trying to roll the joints, causing him to fumble several times to the general chagrin of the room at large.
“One last thing before I leave, Draco.” She took her cloak from the back of the chair and put it on, then drew on a pair of dragon-hide gloves. “I’ll be talking to St Mungo’s today and I’ll send an owl when everything has been sorted. I expect you’ll have exams more often than before.”
than you are too. Then of course there was the Potter thing, that was the biggest tip-off. She's always called me Harry."
So Draco let his eyes slip closed and took in a deep, steadying breath as Harry started mouthing his way down Draco’s torso. His mouth was hot and wet and his teeth were sharp where he nipped and licked teasingly around sensitive nipples, leaving them feeling tight and hard when he moved on, lips skimming across quivering muscle down to the line of Draco’s knickers, where without hesitation Harry boldly pressed his searing-hot tongue against Draco’s cunt through the fabric. Draco keened and arched and fisted the sheets beneath him, and all the while Harry mouthed at him shamelessly, dampening the material further and driving Draco to the very brink of madness in his need for more.
The sight of him here, on his knees before a Muggle altar, would have robbed his parents of the last of their sanity far more effectively than a Dementor.
