She folded the paper and placed it neatly in an envelope and tied it on the owl, tight enough so it wouldn't fall by accident but loose enough so that it didn't harm the little guy. "Well, owl, you should know what to do." She opened her window and dismissed the owl, who gave an offended hoot before flying away.
"Lady Potter," she corrected thoughtlessly. "Why am I here, professor?  Surely you understand I have other things to do."
She walked towards her wardrobe and opened it up, her uniform hung neatly in the front of the other clothing. Gently pulling it down, she turned to her snake who was watching her curiously.
It was a haunting little poem, showed the threat the goblins possessed should they feel threatened. It was fascinating.
"Oi, sod off and pass me a biscuit will you?" Maeve cackled at Malfoy's pouty face, she leaned over and patted his cheek in a teasing way. He pulled away with a huff and crossed his arms.
"No, it was Peter Pettigrew."
She stood up and removed her wand from her holster in a swift motion. Normally she wouldn't need to say the charm to get her magic to do what she wanted, after all intent and focus was a major key in magic even working but she felt the need to keep her wandless and non-verbal magic in secret. Draco had mentioned that such an act was rare and she would very much like to keep Dumbledore off her.
The next class they had was Transfiguration with the Hufflepuffs and professor McGonagall, the head of Gryffindor house, was teaching the subject which would most likely set the Slytherins back. She was as prejudiced as any other self-proclaimed light witch and wizard, Maeve would warn her snakes to be on their best behavior because she had no doubts that the old bat would take points off for just breathing wrong. She wouldn't have someone degrade her snakes for being in a house supposedly classified as dark, it wasn't their fault their main attributes were ambition or cleverness.
After a few minutes of looking, she came upon an intimidating stone building.
She stumbled into her dark room, the cold air assaulting her immediately. Loki, who was curled into himself on her bed, lifted its head before unraveling and slithering towards her. She giggled sweetly at her best friend/familiar.
She hissed, letting out a laugh at the string of curses that left her friend.
"Alright class, today we will be reading a short story and writing our thoughts on how you'd best rewrite it." Mrs. Colt said, standing up with a stack of packets in her hands. She walked around passing them out. "Each story will be different so that it is unique to you. Take your time as you have today and the whole summer to finish It. It will be graded on how well you put it together, not on spelling or handwriting." She explained.
Maeve pulled out her card and allowed the woman to pay, she then signed her name and smirked at the bug-eyed look she received. “This will be the last time I shop here, I very much hate when adults try and patronize me. I do hope you fix your attitude. Have a good day.” Grabbing and her things and walking out the door, it was tiring having to put up with exhausting people.
|                   |               |Hufflepuff |               |                |
Maeve's eyes trailed from McGonagall to the old man who sat peacefully drinking from his goblet, eyes twinkling and instantly the dark haired girl could feel his magic coiling in a vaguely threatening manner. She knew he was planning something, something that no doubt would include her. He was a scheming old man, someone to be wary of. "We'll have to keep an eye on him, he's up to something. We'd just have to intercept should the need arise." She instructed, keeping her voice quiet so as to not alert anyone else.
Maeve was almost impressed, though less so as she caught sight of Granger who practically vibrated in her seat. The bushy-haired girl seemed to want to prove she wasn't a dunderhead, of course just like everywhere else, she'd only come second to Maeve.
"Excellent." Maeve clapped in innocent pretense. "I'll be going now, get to the hospital and get help and remember I was never here." She patted their heads before standing up and walking away. It was time to get back to the Dursleys.
"No need to be miffed, you wouldn't want to lose the plot, now would you?" Maeve playfully scolded as she nicked some grapes off his plate.
"What was that about?" Zabini questioned, Maeve shook out of her head and glanced at him and Malfoy, who had a worried expression.
Fred frowned and looked at his twin. "Before we boarded the train, mum was shouting out asking for the platform number around several muggles. We didn't know why seeing as she clearly knows where it's at but then she started looking around. She might've been looking for you all that time."
She pushed open the small door and hunched over to walk out. Her cousin, Dudley, stomped down the stairs. He shoved her out the way and headed to the kitchen where aunt Petunia was shuffling about.
~Up.~
Maeve giggled quietly at her blonde friends affronted expression, taking a small bite of her treacle tart. She ate her tomato soup silently, remembering how Draco said vegetables were able to help her grow strong and practically forcing her to eat them regularly. "I think it's sweet he cares so much." She teased with a small grin.
Maeve woke to harsh tapping on the cupboard door. She held in a growl, they were going to wake Loki up!
Daphne leaned forward and tapped the shorter girl on the shoulder before whispering, "Do you think since Draco is the godson of professor Snape we should let his father know of the treatment if it gets out of hand?"
Maeve was proud that it all went according to plan, she knew her godfather had to be innocent. He was her fathers best friend, why would he betray someone he considered a brother? And that Remus Lupin bloke, she honestly hadn't seen them being together coming. Though she supposed they were cute together, seeing them reunite had caused a pang in her heart that she didn't understand. She just shook it off with her being happy to have some form of a real family, they seemed nice enough. Hopefully they weren't in Dumbledore's clutches and if they were, oh well. She could find other people to have a bond with. Her boys were good candidates, loyal and protective. Maeve had read somewhere that those two qualities were found in family members and friends. They had those slots filled out.
Slytherin Vaults:
"I'm Remus Lupin, your parents best friend. And yes, you should not have been placed with the Dursleys. Your mother had forbade it from happening, considering neither sister had ever gotten along."
At last, only the Weasley twins were left singing along to a very slow funeral march.
'Pretty and mean and violent'
"I'm willing to bet Dumbledore had something to do with it, she's probably a puppet whose strings belong to that old goat." Maeve said she cared not about admitting her dislike of the mother of the two boys present. They were her twins now either way, they had offered their loyalty.
Soon the train was pulling to a stop, night had already fallen and the sky was filled with stars. They were told to leave their stuff in their spot that the elves would retrieve them. She whispered to Loki, making sure Malfoy couldn't hear, telling him to wait here  Every student from each year filed out, idiots shoving and playing around. Maeve rolled her eyes at the immature dimwits. They were hardly worth her time.
Everyone's eyes were on them. "Must you all stare?" Maeve asked dully, they all snapped their attention away and pretended to be interested in their food or the people around them. "Weasleys, if you'd prefer, you both are more than alright to sit with us." She said heading towards her table.
The two shared a glance before nodding. "We're with you, of course." Said Malfoy confidently. Zabini nodded with his words. Maeve slightly grinned, she'll show everyone exactly what she and all the the other Slytherins are capable of doing.
Your top hats sleek and tall,

"Sorry, love, didn't think it'd be this cold." Fred apologized. "Here, take this." He offered his scarf and wrapped it gently around her neck. His freckled face flushed as he realized how close he was to her.
Heiress:
/Parseltongue writing/
Upon entering the girls loo, Maeve was hit by the strong smell of lavender and vanilla. She scrunched up her nose in distaste as she walked into an empty stall to change as quickly as possible. The need to get away from the awful, most likely cheap, perfume is what fueled her into moving faster.
He slowed his pace, scanned the hallway and smoothed a hand down his robes. Then, with a final brush of his hand through his hair, he marched towards his desk, hoping everyone – mostly Robards – was too busy to realize he had been missing till now.
“How about you just tell me the truth instead, you chicken.”
His life had been going just fine just the day before. He enjoyed his job, even if the last case was killing his sleeping schedule. He loved his friends, even though they just left him a new headache to solve all on his own.
“As much as I hate to say it, ‘Mione might be right. Mate, Malfoy would choose torture over asking for your help.”
“Oh,” Harry blinked, surprised, “thank you.” He tilted his head when Hermione set a small paper bag on his desk. He peered inside the bag and smiled up at her at the sight of a delicious looking treacle tart set neatly inside. “How’s your research going?” he said as he fished out the treacle tart and peered inside the, now empty, bag again. He didn’t know why, but he expected to find a few chocolate biscuits in there too and, for some reason, his stomach dropped when he found none. Odd.
“Maybe there’s a connection with why Malfoy came to you for help.” Hermione said, entering the room as well, “or he would have never come to you in the first place.”
). but, in none of Malfoy’s reports — unlike in his journal — he had mentioned a Time Turner. Not the one Harry had seen in his office, at least. Not the one who had blown up and shoved a new problem into Harry’s face without his permission. Why did his life always have to be so complicated?
Ron hummed, "yeah. Feels like we have been missing something," he said as he passed a cup of coffee to Harry.
“Progress?”
"That face you're making," Draco answered, waving Harry's general direction with a distracted hand, "it always means trouble."
Harry huffed a laugh, and Draco whipped his head around to stare at him in disbelief, "you find this funny?"
The Auror shrugged a shoulder, "I've got to sound professional, don't I?" she winked. With that, she bid Harry goodbye and they left.
Harry dropped his gaze, watching his fingers while he fidgeted him them, "all the days I've spent with him since the day he disappeared."
“Since we meet him half an hour
Harry raised his head and found Hermione smiling down at him. “’Mione?” Harry said, hiding the paper with the dragon doodle before his friend could see it.
. I just want to talk. The disappearance of her son—” Didi merely blinked at him before shutting the door, not letting him finish.
“Looks like you’re the chosen one, Harry,” she snickered pointing at the now clear words spread across the page. “Maybe... could that be why it...?” she trailed off, as she turned her hand to study her fingers.
"I'll explain everything, but later," Malfoy said, as his steps grew urgent and he pushed on, further and further away from Harry's office. In matters of seconds, Harry found himself standing inside the lift, going who knows where, with Malfoy wiping his palms against the front of his trousers, before running a hand through his hair.
It was sunny outside, and Draco couldn't let this chance pass by. The moment he had pulled the curtains aside and noticed how clear the sky was, he had jumped on the bed and shook the snoozing man awake, "Potter? Potter! Come on, stop lazing around and let's go to the park."
Harry dropped his gaze back to the list and pursed his lips. Well, he was already sitting at his desk, a stack of reports and notes spilled over it, he might as well start working again. With a long, suffering sigh, Harry stood from his chair and went to get himself a cup of tea. Somehow, he knew his day was about to become very, very long.
“Alright, we’re done with the questioning, then. We’ll call you if we need anything else from you,” the woman said, “and please, if there’s anything else you think we should know, feel free to come to me,” she smiled as she stood and collected her things.
“Oh, Merlin. Don’t let Ron hear you,” Harry laughed while Hermione rolled her eyes at him.
— had turned out useful. From what Harry had gathered, Malfoy had worked on many of the artifacts Harry and his team brought back from their mission. Heavy, twisted magic swirled inside them, making it almost impossible for the Aurors to stand by them without feeling sick. Harry still remembered the
The folder contained the full collection of all Auror reports, made by Harry and his team, and of all the Unspeakable’s findings. But, that wasn’t what kept Harry’s full attention. The list, written in Malfoy’s neat calligraphy, contained many — very — familiar looking names Harry had scribbled down (over and over again) in the past week, as he worked in his latest, overcomplicated case.
"For ten minutes, Harry.
Harry spun on his feet, ready to glare at the other. He was so done with whatever this was. Harry had no time for Malfoy’s silly little games. Ron would kill him, if he found him missing from his office again. If Robards didn't do it first. Either Malfoy went straight to the point – like right in that
“Again?” Hermione perked up, “What do you mean ‘again’?”
And so, they went to the park at half past six in the morning, strolling down the path hand in hand.
Harry smiled, mind drifting back to the previous days.
"I can't even describe how weird the experience had been — so foreign, yet so familiar, all at once!" Harry leant forward so he could stare at his friend. "I know you weren't there, Ron. But you had to see it, mate. You had to see
Malfoy glared back at him, "Oh, but of course, it must have been
“Ow!” Hermione hissed and rubbed her fingers, as Harry collected the book from where it had fallen at Hermione’s jolt of pain and sat beside her on his couch.
“But you said the day he disappeared.”
“Just?”
. Something tugged at Harry's insides at the sight. Something was very, very wrong.
Harry stumbled and stared at the back of Malfoy’s head, because
“Really, is that how everyone calls the case now?”
, seriously?"
He stepped into his cubicle and took off his robes, shoulders relaxing at the avoided trouble. He was about to sit on his chair when someone cleared their throat, making Harry jump out of his skin.
"No. I only have enough kisses for one," Draco answered, kissing Mischief, their beloved pup — yes, it was a ridiculous name, but Harry had already gave it to him when he'd brought him home (also, Draco outright refused to call him
Harry gasped and pointed an accusing finger at Mischief, "are you
'10:03'.
(I really, really don't know why I didn't reply... I'm sorry)
Harry groaned. It had been such a long day, he was so not ready to have this conversation with Ron, or with anyone, really.
"Can I ask you something?" Harry asked some evening prior, as he made his way into the kitchen, where Draco was currently making dinner.
"This is different, though."
“Answers.” And with that, she left the office in a wave of curly hair.
Hermione raised a suspicious eyebrow at him but he only smiled innocently at her, “I brought you breakfast. I know you hadn’t eaten anything yet.”
playing in his head, like a broken record.
Harry stroke a finger over the leather of the cover and let the curiosity take over. He’d have just a little peek. Not that the owner would notice. Harry had done a few scans on the small book and had found it clean of detecting or overall dangerous spells. Harry sat back against his chair and carefully flipped the journal open.

“Oh, no, not that time. I still hadn't met him then.”
). Besides, after this chaotic little stunt of his, it suited the little devil just fine, — atop his cute head.
“Research? Wait, why are you showing this to me?”
Harry rolled his eyes, than shrugged, he knew he and the pup had already won the argument that was yet to start, "he was just so
. Harry knew about the secrecy of the Unspeakable's work, but he also knew that the Departments of Mystery worked with the Aurors just fine, as long as they all were oath to silence.
Harry stood by the door of the room, a small frown on his face. After the accident, Harry had been informed that that very room had been Malfoy’s office. He had never had any reason to access that particular floor in person, so he hadn’t been overly surprised at the revelation. Yet, the news had still changed his perspective as he stood there, scanning his surroundings.
Harry knew he was staring at the man standing next to him, but he couldn't find the strength inside himself to stop. Gone were the sneer and that bloody pureblood mask. A mix of emotions showing now on Malfoy’s face, all at once. It was such an odd sight that Harry found himself shocked silent. The constant thought of
Harry sat up on his chair and frowned at the worn leather-binding of the book, “What is it?”
“This is not the first time I open it and find that it has changed. It’s like the fourth time since I first discovered this cursed ink.”
, I’m just trying to do my job,” he said, waving the poor potato at his friends, a small piece of it falling from the fork and hitting the table with a small, wet
Harry threw his head back and swallowed, relishing the feeling of the blissful liquid sliding down his throat. Nowadays, he found himself opting for Firewhiskey over tea, which was clearly just not strong enough for this anymore. They had caught him snooping around Malfoy’s office — he had decided to go back and see if he had missed something — and now he'd been assigned to Malfoy’s case. He couldn’t decide whether he was relieved to having one less problem to deal with, or frustrated, because…
– or Harry was out of there. "Listen here, Malfoy. I don't know what exactly you're playing at but, frankly, I have no intention to take any part of it." he said, stabbing an accusing finger at the man, "so, you better get on with it."
"Seriously, mate?" Ron said as he poked his head into Harry's office, "I'm running out of excuses to tell Robards about why you’d be so persistent on never being on time lately."
Harry Potter was a stubborn man — many knew this well — but, Didi was just being a good house elf and was only following orders. So, instead of pushing on, he smiled weakly at the little elf and stopped himself from dropping onto his knees and starting to
“What?” Harry peered at the journal and pursed his lips at the sight of the ink moving to form only gibberish across the page. “it worked fine for me just now — ow!” his fingers were aching by now, and Harry was so ready to throw the book across the room, but Hermione grabbed his wrist and watched the ink move once more.
"I know," Harry sighed, "it sounds so stupid. But I know it's true."
“That’s everything?” the Auror asked once more, looking down at her papers.
and hummed, “I think it changes every five hours or so,” he said then tipped his head at her, “what are you doing?”
“Honestly? I don’t really know how to feel,” Hermione sighed as she perched herself on his desk, “his work is brilliant. All—”
“We think it belonged to him. It looks like some kind of journal, where he kept all his findings about his research and such.”
Well, that escalated quickly.
. “I never asked to be assigned to this case — actually it’s
than anything else really.”
Draco was lucky he had put down the grocery in the kitchen before moving deeper in the house, else the shocking surprise that greeted him would have had him drop everything and added to the horrifying mess that was scattered across the floor. Mess that, mind you, was
He tried a few more times that week but Didi was still a good house elf.
“Your and Ron’s brains are a waste of space, honestly,” she said, exasperated.
Harry opened his mouth, ready to tell Malfoy, how he couldn't be that good at his job, given how the Time Turner seemed ready to blow up and take them all with it, but he was cut off when Malfoy caught him by the wrist and, before he could register it, he was being thrown out of the room as the door shut behind him.
Questions began swirling through his mind, as on why would Malfoy possibly have the reports of that particular mission. Until he noticed the list, written after the short description of said mission. Harry took the reports with him, sending the rest of the folder back to its place inside the cabinet. He had some additional reading to do.
Hermione raised an eyebrow at him, “you’re telling me you haven’t thought of writing down what’s written on the journal before it changes?”
"How did he even
. I couldn't leave him there!" he reasoned. He smiled and bent forward to peck Draco on the lips, "I love you, and I know he already loves you too," he said, plucking the puppy in Draco’s arms and grinning when the other wordlessly cradled the small ball of fluff in his hands without a word, hard expression melting and smile tugging at the corners of his lips.
Harry huffed but didn’t protest. He sighed and leaned back onto his chair, “the day he disappeared,” he started, then took in a breath before meeting his best friend’s gaze, mind swirling back to that day, “he brought me breakfast.”
you?"
Hermione blinked, “date?”
Harry left the Ministry with the same skip to his feet as the previous day. Though, this time, he took a moment to first head home and fix his appearance. It wouldn’t do to go around, knocking at people’s door in his Auror’s robes. Who knew what they’d think! Probably that he'd come to arrest them, or something. He’d forgotten the first time. Maybe, that was why he was not even given the chance to finish his sentence, he mused.
The door opened, and Harry’s smile immediately brightened at the sight of the person now standing before him. “Hello! I wanted to ask, if you—…” he flinched, as the other all but slammed the door at his face. Harry stood there, shocked by the suddenness of the reaction. He blinked the surprise away and sniffed, staring at the door. Then, he turned and skipped his way down the steps
And then, a ping slapped Harry back to reality. He blinked and Malfoy was pulling him again, the soft hum of
Kudos? 🥺
. Because, all I do in my free time is mess up with unstable Time Turners and see if I can destroy time itself," he sneered. "In case you had not noticed, Potter, I am an Unspeakable. It is my job to study Time Turners. And, it has been for
“Great,” Harry sniffed, “I’m so honored.”
“That was an overly complicated expression. Besides, you wouldn’t dare!”
"Different as in
Draco pouted, glanced out the window then turned to Harry again, "well," he said, poking the tips of his pointer fingers together, "uhm, around... six in the morning?"
Despite the disaster left by the Time Turner, the room had been easily returned to — what Harry supposed — was its initial tidiness. The office was bare of any sort of personal decoration. There wasn’t much around, actually. The room had a minimalistic design, bearing only a dark wooden desk with matching chair, a large enchanted window and a floor to ceiling cabinet that took up all the wall it stood against.
—… in his defense, he was growing quite desperate and his sleep-deprived brain was not helping with his emotional state of mind. He moved his foot away, with a defeated sigh, “could you at least tell her that all I came for is to
Hermione hummed, “and?”
This whole mess was such… a mess. Harry had worked on those insufferable reports for days, and nothing —
The first part, as he had already gathered, was a full — and the only — report regarding the Time Turner he had been working on (the one that took him away, Harry’s mind reminded him helpfully). Yet, it was the second part that had him pause. There were several empty pages that seemed — no, blank, not
He was late.
“Of course I was. And flattery will get you nowhere, Harry,” she laughed before standing and heading to the door. “I’ll owl you later, I think I might be onto something.”
Hermione tapped the tip of her quill against her parchment then when to put her things away. “Well, for now, I’ll go through what I really came here for,” she waved a stack of papers — a copy of Malfoy’s notes about the Time Turner found in the journal, “in the meanwhile, you check on that ink and send me anything you think might be useful.”
“Why aren’t you despairing over my troubles? I thought we were best friends!” Harry pouted and threw a crumbled paper sheet at the other.
They had found a spot on the grass next to a tree, Harry laying against the tree and Draco sitting not far from him, laughing and cooing at their new pet. The puppy, so small and fluffy, was rolling on the grass and climbing over Draco’s legs to stick his little snout inside the sleeve of his shirt.
— display to watch. Harry dragged his finger across the page, watching in wonder as the ink slithered its way out of its little corners, until it darted forward, making Harry snapped his hand away as if burned. He hissed as he felt a stabbing pain shoot up his digit as if something had just pierced his fingertip, the shock and pain that hit at the contact making him drop the journal.
The plot is turning out to be more complicated than I predicted and planned. If you see any incoherence, I'd really appreciate it if you could point it out. Please? Thank you!
“You know I’m against wasting food. But, right now, I’m so tempted to give up my breakfast to let it collide with your face.”
Harry stopped; eyes trained to the moving picture laying before him. It portrayed the last moments of an Auror mission, judging by the number of red robes moving about and spells being thrown. The picture ended with a mad-looking witch, sneering, before a Stupefy had thrown her to the floor. Harry remembered the mission perfectly well; he had been the one throwing the stunner at the witch the previous week.
Harry sighed and picked the small journal up. He turned it this way and that, not seeing anything special about it. It was clearly old, but it’s owner took great care of it. The binding was worn by the numerous times of being used and carried around. Yet, there wasn’t any visible tear or stain on it.
He’d been surprised to find his team’s reports inside Malfoy’s office too, but the bitterness that came after was directed to the fact that, if only they worked together in person everything would have been so much
“Harry!” she chided, “it’s not a diary — okay, it probably is — but it’s still evidence too,” she said, trying and failing to hide a smile, “and you’re an Auror, be professional.”
“No, it’s not. Stop being a prick,” she laughed before kissing his cheek and stepping through the Floo.
," Draco scoffed, "I told you, we were out of eggs!" he huffed, though his protests melted away the moment Harry handed him their tiny pet, who had the audacity to lick the tip of his nose — he had the tendency whenever Draco tried to ground him. "You manipulative little pest," Draco told him, watching his little tongue lolling to the side as he gave a small bark. That was a good enough apology for him, so he just gave up all pretence of being mad and went back to the kitchen, cuddling the pup against his chest.
He stared at the thin boy dumbfounded as a stray tear run down his pale cheek. It made his insides ache and hurt. Somehow that single tear had a bigger effect on him than a full-blown sob would have had. It was as if that drop held all the pains and sorrows of the world. It screamed a kind of loneliness, heartache and hurt that very few could even comprehend. All of that contained in those gray, gray eyes. Once again, Harry wondered what else this man had had to go through to be so… broken, and asked himself how he’d never seen them before, the cracks in the ivory shell.
He lived for the moments they spent talking at night, in which we would remain silent while his friends relayed the pranks they’d played on their siblings, how they had driven Ronald up the wall and how they had
“So, wait.” Ron’s voice rose up. “You are telling me that Ferret here has spent every summer night at
because the they had so many house elves, his father barely noticed it. That summer, Leaf would apparate him to our room every night and with her help we would heal him.”
That, however, didn’t keep him from dreaming about a red-headed knight in shining armor coming to rescue him from his father’s evil grasp. In his dreams, he wore fitted dark pants and silk shirts in light blue, silver, lavender or peach, with billowy sleeves that hung from his elbows and reached the floor and would float around him beautifully when he was lifted in the knights strong arms and they rode together into the sunset on a majestic dragon. He obviously ignored those dreams as well. Dreams had no meanings. Dreams were stupid. But against his wishes, they kept coming. And a part of him wondered if the twins were onto something when they called him dramatic, because some of those dreams seemed to put even fairytales to shame.
there, less ten minutes prior, when he had left the house.
“The number at the top. I only guessed it was the date, but," he shrugged, "I don’t know."
Later that morning, Harry found himself hunched over a piece of parchment, as he scribbled down (once again) all details he knew about the case, when his door burst open, giving him quite the scare.
“Just hold it open for me so I can copy what’s written on it,” Hermione told him, as she hunched over a piece of parchment. “Were the previous pages like this?” Hermione then asked him, as she straightened her posture to read what she’d just copied.
! Stupid Malfoy and his stupid book written in stupid, bloodthirsty ink,” he grumbled as he stuck his finger into his mouth and went to flip through the book.
“Ah.”
Harry almost tripped on his own robes as he hastily made his way towards the lift. He huffed out a breath as its doors closed behind him and pointedly ignored the looks, he was receiving as the lift made its way down. He jumped out without waiting for the doors to open completely and rushed his way down the hall and towards his office, still feeling eyes boring a hole on the back of his head.
“Didi?” Ron raised an eyebrow from across his desk.
The sky was clear, and the park quiet, its silence softened by the birds' chirping, the chatter of occasionally passersby, and Draco’s bright laughter.
“Been talking about him since we set foot inside the restaurant,” Hermione sigh, raising her glass to hide the tiny little smile spread over her lips.
Let me tell you. I haven't forgotten about this fic — of course not, it's haunting my dreams actually. I just... made it overcomplicated, and now I'm just trying to untangle the mess I just turned my planned plot into XD
"Is it now?"
“How can you make me believe you if you don’t even deny to being disgustingly smitten and so madly in love?”
(See the end of the chapter for
Hermione hissed when the ink stung her again, then frowned and raised her eyes to look at Harry, “I can’t read what’s written on it,” she said, looking more disappointed than confused.
Harry reached for his wand, ready to cast a cleaning spell, but ended up squawking instead, when Malfoy all but caught him by the wrist and began dragging him out of his office. "I don't have time for this, Potter," the man had the audacity to groan in frustration when Harry tried to protest and pull himself free.
He opened his eyes, not remembering when they slipped shut, when he heard someone dropping on the now free seat across from him. Ron slid a small book over the desk and towards him, earning a questioning eyebrow from Harry, “we found this in the room where Malfoy disappeared.”
“I’m being completely serious, mate!”
Harry absently doodled at the corner of the first piece of paper that found itself under his grasp; since he was just a child, he had always been given something to do and, now, too many long office hours were making him fidgety and in need to do
She nodded and did as told, Axehammer began speaking in a language she didn't quite understand and suddenly she was in pain. She tried to stay still and quiet but she couldn't suppress the bloodcurdling scream and soon she began thrashing. The pain was unbearable, never in her life had she felt like this.
§Come on, Loki. Let'sss go sssee if thisss letter hasss arrived.§
"I'm certain that he is not the one who betrayed my parents. Now, if you'll excuse us, we mustn't be late." She followed Lord Malfoy towards the fireplace and watched him pull out a handful of green powder.
~what isss thisss? A ssspeaker?~
Peep protective Sirius Black and the tease that is Remus Lupin.
"So, is this like them offering a silent alliance?" Blaise questioned, with a tilt of his head.
Loki followed her out, opting to stay in the dark shadows. His eyes trained on his human, making sure no harm would fall before her. He watched as she calmly walked into the loud kitchen, head held high in a position someone who knows they're powerful could hold.
She ordered the lazy snake up, he hissed grumpily but did as told. Maeve opened her door and walked down to the kitchen where the Dursleys were at. Loki slithered alongside her, trying to stay within the shadows where its cooler.
"Good. Those of you who have finished eating, let's go."
The voice spoke again.
They ignored all the looks they received by having two Gryffindors walk alongside them, whispers followed them but would quiet down when Maeve would look at them. Rumors had begun being spread about Maeve becoming the next Dark Lady but she'd wear that title proudly. She was the first of her group to enter the Great Hall followed by Draco, Blaise, Theo, and then the twins. She knew the youngest male Weasley was most likely seething at his seeing his older brothers do what he hadn't.
Soon enough class was just about done and professor Snape had instructed them all to close their books and gather their things. Maeve did as told, followed by those around her, she didn't miss the grimace that graced Snape's face when he took in how well behaved her snakes were. He could make faces all he wanted as long as he never disrespected her and that he knew his place. They'd never be equals and it's time he realized that.
are proud to present
A student from the lion's side snorted at her proper way of speaking. Cold green eyes flashed towards them. Quirrell watched closely, seeing what she'd do.
"Well, I have spoken to your head of house and the headmaster of the way you've spoken to me during our first lesson." The female professor was the one to answer. "And I've requested to have a meeting to discuss why such behavior is inappropriate."
So if you seek
She was a Nephilim.
He was an upper year student who she saw constantly bullying the younger years from other houses and not once getting in trouble by their head of house. Although that didn't really surprise her as professor Snape seemed like a total git from what she's heard from passing students. His name was Marcus Flint, he was the quidditch captain and its chaser, he was known for his brutal attacks to win by any means.
“But you did. Both of you did. If you hadn’t been there, I wouldn’t be here now. Fred told me to stay, to fight and I did.” The reminder of how desperate Draco had been, that he’d only held on because the twins had given him the strength to remain with the living was a punch to the throat and he asked himself yet again how the hell he’d missed this. His pain, his suffering. Years of Malfoy-Stalking and he’d never truly seen any of it. He hadn't wanted to see it. At the thought of stalking, something came back to Harry’s mind. A horrifying memory of his biggest mistake to date. A bathroom, a crying boy, and so, so much blood. He wondered what would have happened if he’d hugged Draco instead of almost killing him.
“What do you want me to do?” He said determinedly.
! I held on, for him! Because I promised. I promised I'd survive and I did. I did! And now I am here but he... he..." George's hug became bone-crushing and Harry winced at the sight, thinking it would probably leave bruises behind. Through his speech, Malfoy's words became strained, as if uttering them aloud caused him pain. The redhead was now whispering something in the blonde's ear and he simply stood there as both boys hugged each-other while they cried.
The rest of the summer went by pretty similarly. The days were spent either hiding or in pain. The night spent in the twins embrace. What had been different though, was that Draco had found a small reprieve in the kitchens where no one would look for him. He spent his time learning to cook with Leaf and built with her a small Oasis in a house made of nightmares.
George gasped next to Draco at the sight of the insides of the box.
“So, little one. Thinking of who you’re going to the ball with?”
story.”
“Very. Loud. Snoring.” The two continued to bicker and Harry couldn’t help but chuckle. It was clear that these two were comfortable with each other and it was curious to see Draco’s dramatics in a new light. The Slytherins tendency to exaggerate was no secret at Hogwarts but it tended to be hurtful. Now, however, there was a playfulness to it that he could easily see fit well with the twin’s unusual antics. Their friendship became less and less strange the more he saw them interacting. George’s voice caught his attention as the boy knelt at the blonde’s feet in a supposedly humble way.
"What?" the other answered, voice echoing down the corridor. "What?" he asked again when failed to answer him. "Love?"
“Right. Is that why you were late then?”
The last part was said in a mere whisper, and Harry was not sure if he was meant to hear that, so he just chose to ignore it instead, "What are you talking about, Malfoy?"
"What didn't you see, Harry?"
Harry raised his hands and held them right before Draco’s face, the puppy he was holding greeted the blond with a tiny bark, and Harry smiled, "I found the poor thing in a box at the side of a street not far from here. Can we keep it?" he said all the while staring at Draco with wide, pleading eyes (he would have called them 'puppy eyes', but he wasn't sure whether he'd be able to pair the adorable tiny creature he had been cuddling with, on his way home.)
echoing behind him.
“Yes, but don’t tell Hermione,” Ron winked at Harry and laughed.
Ron grinned and threw the paper ball back at Harry, “I’m sorry, I’m just enjoying the fact that I wasn’t the one to be assigned to ‘The Malfoy Headache.’”
"Real?" Ron asked him, looking incredulous.
Andromeda looked sad and her gaze drifted upwards, as if she could sense her nephew through the floorboards. Who knew what pureblood magic could actually do, so perhaps she could?
If that wasn’t heartbreaking, Harry didn’t know what was.
But I do. For myself if nothing else. I won’t have the pleasure to choose what I keep to myself at my hearing. At least this time it’s my
did you say? Wonderful! Wonderful news indeed!” He said as he stood up quickly. “It was a great talk little one, but I have to leave, things to do, things to say, you know? I’ll see you around and yadda, yadda.” And with that, the ginger left, the grin still on his face and Draco stared after him feeling more confused that ever.
“Dancing to this music isn’t proper”. That furious glint that sometimes appeared on the gingers eyes when he talked about Lucius made an appearance, but it was soon gone again.
“...Who has done this to you and how we can help.”
He turned and his eyes met Fred’s who was now sitting down next to him. Too close and at the same time not close enough. He looked handsome, with his wild hair and tailored robes. His lips were red from the punch and Draco wondered if they'd taste like it, too. His eyes drifted upwards to meet the other’s eyes again and remembered he had been asked a question..
“Leaf?” He repeated. “I don’t… I don’t know. I freed her a year ago, things were getting too… too much and I… I couldn’t… She had to be safe and that was away from me.” His face crumbled. And it was such a heartbreaking sight that Harry wanted to hit Hermione with a pillow for ever bringing it up. Of course, it’d hurt him to think about the only being that had ever cared for him in that godforsaken household. The only mother, father, sibling, and friend he’d had until the twins showed up. Harry was perplexed about his reactions towards Draco’s pain, but he told himself it made sense. Draco may not have been an orphan but Harry knew what it was like to feel hurt by family. What it was like to ask for love and receive punishments in return. He told himself it was empathy that was making his blood boil and his skin crawl in an uncomfortable way. What else could it be?
“Where would you rather be? Where your pain lies or your heart thrives? I think it's pretty obvious.” With that, she skipped towards Malfoy and laid a gentle kiss on his head.
it to mean but… I simply couldn’t comprehend why on earth he’d want me like that. I couldn’t even have a public friendship with him, much less a romantic relationship. I couldn’t even give him a future, because I knew my father would simply sell me off to the highest bidder the first chance he got. So, I hid. For days. I figured that he’d figure how worthless it was to even try and if we didn’t talk about it, if we didn’t see each other then he wouldn’t have to reject me. I was terrified to lose the fantasy of being with Fred, but more than that I couldn’t bear the thought of losing my only friends.”
“After that we met every chance we got. Still the three of us but sometimes just the two of us as well. He was a light in the dark for me that year.”
“Why didn’t you go to Mal… I mean, Ferret’s Manor?”
“Oh, please your Highness, forgive this simple peasant that has dared to offend you honor!”
“Come on Harry, don’t be so naive.” His voice was low but there was a twinge of anger in it. And Harry was somewhat excited about that. Angry was good, angry was better than hopelessness, which would only lead to bad decisions. “Even if they don’t lock me up, even if they let me go. Who would want me? I’m a broken man, who is dirty on the inside as well as on the outside,” Fingers brushed the part where the Mark had been forced onto him. “I can't even hear my last name without collapsing into a fit of panic. Besides, I doubt I could love again…”
“After the Yule Ball, you started dating?” Harry’s eyes drifted towards Ginny who was looking intently at the Slytherin.
“Malfoy…” Potter said. The word came out of his lips in a soft manner he doubted he’d ever heard before. And even though the tone was much different than how
Harry understood that, and with a nod, he let his friend go.
during an entire summer?”
"I... I don't mean to be rude or anything but... what is Malfoy doing here?" Hermione, ever the one to not stand an unsolved puzzle, finally asked what they had all been thinking. Malfoy clung tighter to George and buried his face in the other boy's chest, giving a simple nod to what Harry guessed had been a whispered question.
For a while, there was just silence. Both of them staring out into the distance, the air wrapping around them in a soft embrace. Then,
She asked, not even once thinking that perhaps it wouldn't have a name.
§I sssee no light.§
“Would you just give me the price so that I may pay? I’ve no time to be wasting.”
The young Slytherin growled in annoyance. "No, it's not wonderful, and I would appreciate it if that old bastard could mind his own business. Do tell him that when you tell him I refused your hand in friendship. Have a good day...or don't, I really do not care."
With a raised brow, the woman did as told. She then smiled in a way that showed she was humoring the young girl. “Where are your parents, child? Surely you’ll need someone to pay for your things.”
"No, I hadn't realized that Sirius Black was this supposed traitor. When I read his name on my inheritance papers, I assumed nothing wrong. That was my first mistake, I should've asked why he was absent in my life." Maeve twirled a dark curl around her index finger and bit her lower lip in thought. "I believed for a long time that I had no living
Neville nodded. "The twins have a good idea and the highest grade I'd probably get would be in Herbology. I know my way around plants."
Maeve sighed, still quite peeved. "The whole little meeting with McGonnagal was a joke. She was merely vexed at the very thought of me supposedly disrespecting her during our first lesson. Brought Dumbledore and Snape, though the nasty git stayed quiet. Dumbledore tried to play his disappointed grandfather card, as if I cared what he or anyone else thought."
"Hello, Tom. I'm Maeve and I was hoping you could help me get into Diagon Alley?" She asked, hating how she had to act. But it always got the job home.
"Yes, so I know when I need it, they'll send their support. I need not worry of the small chance they'll betray me. They are a loyal and vicious lot."
A treasure
"Blaise is the same way, he's begun studying and practicing runes already. Perhaps you both can work together?"
"Oh, is that so? By all means ask away."
"I want those blocks off and loyalty spells gone." She stated firmly at his curious glance. "And would you be able to tell me who this Morningstar person is?" The curiosity had begun to gnaw at her once she saw the unfamiliar name. "Also, would you be so kind as to direct me to my vaults? I'd like to see all that I have."
"Aunt Petunia, you said mother was a witch correct?" She asked, looking at her horse-necked relative. Said woman nodded nervously. "Then obviously you'd know how to get to 9 3/4, right?" Her tone left no room for nonsense.
Dumbledore had gotten to his feet. He was beaming at the students, his arms opened wide, as if nothing could have pleased him more than to see them all there.
Maeve figured the bookstore could be last since she would likely spend a small fortune buying all the appropriate items to get her ready for her life in the Magical world. With that decision made, Maeve searched for clothing that would allow her to fit in properly. Twilfitt and Tatting’s was a shop much like Madam Malkin’s Robes for All Occasions except she had seen women exit nicely dressed, from that Maeve deduced that Twilfitt and Tatting’s had a more standing with the wealthy and the dark haired girl wanted nothing but the best. With that in mind, she made her way towards the beautiful building.
She crackles at something she clearly only thought was amusing. "Our blood is pure, yours is tainted by that mudblood of a mother." Pug face sneered.
"Welcome to Hogwarts," said Professor McGonagall. "The start-of-term banquet will begin shortly, but before you take your seats in the Great Hall, you will be sorted into your houses. The Sorting is a very important ceremony because, while you are here, your house will be something like your family within Hogwarts. You will have classes with the rest of your house, sleep in your house dormitory, and spend free time in your house common room.
You might belong in Hufflepuff,
"Bulstrode, Millicent" then became a Slytherin. That was the house she was mostly interested in.
Her attention snapped towards the doorway where Weasley appeared, panting and flushed a dark red. He scampered to the back after making eye contact with the dark haired girl, a smirk curled at her lips and green eyes lighting up at receiving such a wonderful response. The lanky boy was much like a skittish animal once he found out exactly who the predator was. Though it appeared that he still couldn't keep his mouth shut so she'd have to set him straight once and for all. She couldn't have a disobedient pet.
Vernon swaddled down the stairs in a hurry as he heard his poor wife yelling at the burden that was left to them. The floor boards creaked loudly as he rushed into the kitchen, only to stop in bewilderment at the sight before him. The freak sat calmly at the table, in his spot, while Petunia glared at her. She glanced at him, her toxic green eyes glowing ominously.
She hissed quietly as Loki's tongue flickered in amusement.
Pansy was the first to be called and Maeve knew she was hardly paying attention with the way she fumbled and messed up. "We'll be working on that during your detention, I hope you know that. Mister Crabbe, if you will."
~You ssshould get ready now so you don't get bothered by your roommatesss.~
"Well? Get to cooking, make sure you don't burn anything or punishment will be worse! Understood?" Petunia smiled nastily, she enjoyed hurting the little freak. Besides, she never asked to be burdened by her freakish sisters daughter. It wasn't her fault Lily died.
"Yes, when I was told a rumor of your supposed betraying be a lie, well, I just had to see for myself. Besides I'd rather live elsewhere then with the Durlseys. With you being family, Dumbledore shouldn't make me return back to them."
5.) 36+14=50  6.) 33+16=49
"On your eleventh birthday, you will be receiving a letter from a place where's there more people like you, with your abilities." Petunia carried on, she felt sweat trickling down her back. The demonic child was terrifying. "You'll be asked to attend school with them to learn to harness your magic more effectively."
(See the end of the chapter for
Braxton hugged his thick wool coat tightly against his body. The night air blew harshly, the trees swaying in the wind. He trudged further and further into the unknown parts of the woods. His heavy breaths filled the silence.
Maeve(age 7)
Touch me and you'll burn
Maeve had received a headache at their cut off speech, were all magical twins like this? Goodness, she'd kill if she found similar twins as these two. Well, at least she knew they were nothing like their brother, which earned them brownie points. "Would you two happen to know where the library is, since you both claimed your duty of offering assistance."
The table second from the left clapped this time; several Ravenclaws stood up to shake hands with Terry as he joined them.
A regal looking owl, most likely from Gringotts, flew towards her. "That's a bloody Great horned owl!"Draco shouted in awe and a hint of fear in his tone. Several students shrieked in terror at the owl. She snickered as he landed, perching delicately on her shoulder like royalty.
"We can meet up before breakfast on the quidditch field, Fred and I enjoy going there early every morning to watch the sun rise." George said with flushed cheeks, freckles standing out.
Maeve marched to the Slytherin common room, students roaming the halls immediately parted ways to allow her to pass. Anger poured off her small body, letting everyone know she's not to be trifled with. She walked down the cold dungeon halls and snapped the password, her magic acting quickly and slamming open the common room doors with a bang.
The clothes did nothing to help her cool down underneath the burning sun, as they once belonged to her overweight cousin and thus were hanging loosely over her thin, small frame. Luckily her long, curly hair that usually fell below her shoulder blades, was pulled into a tight messy ponytail with a makeshift hair-tie. Her eyes narrowed as she pulled the last of the weeds.
'She is fire and ice. You'll fear the cold and crave the burn.'
"Is this when you stood up for those two Slytherin girls?" Theo inquired, with a head tilt.
oop peek Maeve being a baddie~
"Of course, professor." She walked elegantly towards a vacant seat and sat, crossing her ankles in an x motion. Green eyes watched as the other two professors sat as well. "Now, may I know why I was called? I have no memory of doing anything wrong."
Theo cleared his throat and looked around at the other first years that were not so subtle at hiding their interest in the conversation. "It would be better to discuss this in a more private area."
McGonagall went back to calling out names as she started a conversation with Malfoy.
§Tell me Loki, would going there be a missstake? I already have full control over here, what if sssomething goes? What would I do?§
how to act.
"How was it so hard to locate you three? Had no one told you all that I was searching for you?" she asked exasperated as she sat beside Draco. "I had something to show you dolts, but now I'm rethinking my decision."
He had a sneer on his face and a cold look in his dark eyes as he looked around the classroom. Momentarily stopping at Maeve Potter who merely smiled mockingly, toxic green orbs glinting dangerously as she stared at him. He cleared his throat and instead turned his attention to the rest of the classroom, missing the cruel smirk that curled at the young girl's lips. "You are here to learn the subtle science and exact art of potion-making. As there is little foolish wand-waving here, many of you will hardly believe this is magic. I don't expect you will really understand the beauty of the softly simmering cauldron with its shimmering fumes, the delicate power of liquids that creep through the human veins, bewitching the minds, ensnaring the senses... I can teach you how to bottle fame, brew glory, and even stopper death - if you aren't as big a bunch of dunderheads as I usually have to teach." He spoke softly, capturing the attention of everyone with ease.
He hummed before looking her in the eyes, seemingly searching for something. "Well, I'll let you go off to look for your little friends."
The green eyed, raven haired girl only sighed exasperated, honestly couldn't this girl understand that her presence clearly isn't wanted any further? "Listen here you obnoxious little girl, I do not care for being respectful or obedient to a man who has tried to force a friendship upon me. Now, do be a good doll and leave me be, I've got things to do."
It was quite noticeable to all the professors how none of the Syltherins have moved to touch their food, instead opting to wait for their Slytherin queen to arrive. Severus watched with a sharp eye as Maeve sat down along with her friends and only when she gave a nod did everyone else began to eat. It seemed she had already established control, it went far beyond what he had seen in the common room and with her being the one in charge he could not speak to Dumbledore without being a social pariah as she essentially has more power then even him being the head of house.
She hummed as she sat down and waited for the questions to come.
"Messrs Padfoot would like to say I told you so to messrs Moony that I had always said we'd be the best."
"Potter," Snape's familiar drawl called out to her, the aforementioned girl refrained from rolling her eyes, but hummed in response, not bothering to look at him. "McGonnagal would like to speak to you. You remember she's your Transfiguration teacher, I'm sure?" Maeve mentally scoffed at the mention of the prejudiced old biddy.
Blaise watched, amusement thrumming in his veins. Their little dark lady was exceptional at words, he could see the way Draco was crumbling just to be of use to her and if that meant using his own father, so be it. "It's alright, I'm sure if he were to ever find out, he wouldn't be upset. It's for a good cause, after all." He smiled, cheeks flushing a light pink that stood out against his pale skin.
As the years went by, the Dursley household quickly fell into the control of young Maeve Potter. She soon taught them the rules they were to follow lest they be punished. Vernon Dursley was the first to learn that the hard way.
When the professor dismissed them, she let out a sound of disbelief. The first years centered themselves around the quadruple of children, as though creating a protection shield. And the four didn't even look surprised or bothered by it. They seemed to acknowledge it and accept it.
Maeve sat up in her room, she could hear her aunt Petunia running around like a headless chicken fixing up the house for her guest. She could only hope no one told Marge about her, that would ruin the fun. She was dressed in her favorite maroon long sleeved dress that fell just below her knees, black flats, ans her dark curls were let down, falling perfectly down her back.

The boy pursed his lips in thought, he could always bring up the minister and his incompetence, that always gets father speaking up a storm but what would he say should he get suspicious? He voiced that to the young witch, she would know what to say as she was brilliant. He watched her think as she tapped a small pale finger against her lower lip.
It appeared as if Harry had been wrong, this was anything but over and he couldn’t help but feel excitement at the prospect of what was to come.
“Well... ehm... I mean. We are young and you are very pretty and smart and amazing. And now you know how to cook so… I figured…” Fred’s eyes looked at anything except at those beautiful, beautiful gray orbs framed by impossibly long lashes.
“I fell” He amended which only made the twins scoff loudly.
“You’ve looked into this haven’t you?”
“A car that you father has
“What can I say Mione, you aren’t the only genius around, you know?” George said with a wink.

His first year had been mainly uneventful, he kept his eyes on the twins from time to time, feeling deep admiration for their antics and trying not to burst out laughing at many of their jokes. He tormented Potter and his minions after he renounced his friendship and generally enjoyed being away from his father for a while. How freeing it was to not be hiding in corners constantly, fearing every shadow in a house that should be a home just in case Lucius walked out of one. However, as the end of the year approached, dread began to consume him. The mudblood had better grades than he did in most of his classes and as the days passed, he became more and more subdued, studying late into the night, barely even sleeping and flinching slightly at any touch or sudden movement. Little did he know that two redheads had taken in the sudden change and that his behavior had triggered the boys' curiosity.
. Lee and I were one hair away from throwing him off the tower. If there ever was a record for pining, Fred would’ve broken it for sure.” Harry’s heart warmed at everyone’s quiet laughter. There were pained undertones underneath it, but it was laughter nonetheless and after so much suffering, he was grateful for small mercies. “After a week of that rubbish I talked some sense, or rather screamed some sense into my poor brother and he went to woo his prince.” Winking at the pouting blond. And everyone turned to stare at him.
He chided the redhead.
“Oh Dragon…” George had his arms wrapped around the trembling boy.
He remembered the shattering scream that had been ripped out of Draco Malfoy at the sight of Fred in the Great Hall only a few days back. Wailing as if his soul had been cut out of him right then and there. And at this moment, Harry felt like screaming, too.
“Look at you using big words. Who would’ve thought.”
“Shut it, Princess.”
He waved his hand and lifted the silencing charm but the quite remained.
for his unsatisfying grades. He knew what to expect though, through the years, his father had made sure that he knew his place, that he learned just how to behave in front of others, with others, and, especially, what was expected of him. Thankfully Draco had become a marvelous actor because despite his teachings, he had never felt as superior or hateful as he pretended to be, as he was expected to be. In truth, he felt smaller, lesser than most, especially his father, because why else would he hate him like he did if he was nothing but disappointed? If he truly were as “above them all” as he claimed, surely his father would offer him a smile, a hug? Instead, he got the end of his walking stick if he was lucky, the snake handle if he wasn’t.
“What is this about?” He asked.
And if that wasn’t the truth, Harry didn’t know what was. He thought he knew Malfoy. He was conceited, spoiled, rude and cruel. He didn’t care about anyone but himself. And now it turned out that he wasn’t any of those things. He just pretended to be to avoid his father’s punishments. It turned out that his
“What is going on?” Ron stood there staring just as much as he was. Unsure of whether to laugh or call The Janus Thickey ward.
I hope you enjoy this little snippet. Next chapter will have all the romance and all the drama.
George chuckled lowly. “Yeah… I… Listen. Auror’s will be coming for him any moment now and that can’t happen. I understand there has to be a trial but until then he can’t be shipped off to Azkaban. With everything that I know has happened to him and everything I don’t… He won’t survive it Harry. I know he won’t.” There was fear in George’s eyes.
“That it does”
“What’s on your mind little one?”
"I am not the only one seeing this am I?" Ron asked.
“I figured you would. I’ll tell you what I know, what I lived, but… Some of it is his to tell.”
The redhead in question knelt once again next to him and engulfed him in a one-armed hug.
Ron locked eyes with him and saw in his wide eyes that they were sharing the same sentiment. "I... I don't think now is the time to go into details, but... he's been giving us information on the inside for years."
What was even more astounding was that Malfoy did not push him away, or sneer like he usually did, but instead, he clung to him as if the redhead was the last thing keeping him alive.
His brain couldn't help but repeat George's words.
“Am I going to have to call you golden boys now? Because you are giving Potter a run for his money in the savior department.”
“Alright, how about I make us something to eat and we continue this story later.” Mrs. Weasley stood up rushed to the kitchen to everyone’s astonishment. Harry was grateful at this little bit of normalcy and went to help the matriarch while other hurried to set up the table.
"...gone George, he is gone."
“Not that.” Draco insisted. “You actually think there will come a day in which I no longer want you.”
“There were bars on his window! And a cat flap on his door!”
“Can’t say no to wonder boy.”
“When the end of the year came, we decided that we had to take Draco out of the house as soon as possible but we couldn’t. He was still a minor and there was no way that the Wizengamot would take custody away from Lucius, so we came up with a plan. Draco freed Leaf his first night back and then bound her to him and him alone, not the family. Because she was his personal elf before that
“I want you to know before then.” Draco said. Harry’s eyes met his and he was surprised by the fear he saw in the silver orbs.
“Yes, I can see that.”
“Dearie, You don’t have to tell us more, you know that right?” He heard her say to Draco.
The night air was cool and brushed softly against Harry’s face as he took in the beauty of the darkness around him. He’d always found worth in dichotomies, as a child he’d been afraid of the dark because it brought forth his loneliness but it had also been the only moment of true safety as the Dursleys had been sleeping and it meant no screams, no chores, no punches for him. He’d both hated it and loved it. He felt the same now. It was a beautiful night and he loved the obscure sky and the bright stars and the breeze brushing his hair, but he hated that a moment as pure and calm as this existed at all after the things he’d found out that day. His heart constricted further as he thought of the love and hope he’d seen but for an instance, in Draco’s eyes as he’d seen the box and its contents just for it to be quickly replaced by anguish, unlike anything he’d ever seen.
“You are welcome, Draco. You are very welcome.”
Draco entered the bathroom, still deep in his musings, and as he finished and exited into the dark hallway, he failed to see the figure lurking in the shadows. He’d been too distracted by his thoughts to see and then it was too late. A hand was around his wrist and only one word was uttered.
The Great Hall was adorned beautifully. There were fairy lights and glass sculptures, flowers and magnificent drapes hanging from the walls. Most of the students had really put an effort on their outfits as well. Even Potter looked decent and Granger looked surprisingly pretty.
"What is
“What an embarrassment.” He looked at Pansy, who was also looking at the twins, although for different reasons. Her eyes held disapproval in them. He hummed in response, hoping she’d take it as agreement. Draco had long ago found ways to avoid speaking ill of his twins. It just didn’t feel right.
“Don’t let him fool you with all the lovey dovey-ness” George intervened. “There were veeery awkward moments. I mean, we
Draco wondered, although, he guessed that if one saved the world one had the right to strut around naked if they so wished.
“George!” Draco’s ears had become the brightest shade of red which was strangely endearing.
Harry quickly decided that his godson was the most adorable baby he’d ever seen. He had rosy cheeks and big round eyes that changed just as much in colour as his hair did and were now set in a brilliant purple. He smiled and laughed, and it was such a nice change from all the hurt and sadness that seemed to be in the air these days that he felt as if he’d been born anew. Andromeda smiled at them warmly as they played, but there was always that tinge of sadness in them whenever she looked at her grandson. Harry understood that, she had lost everyone but him after all. It was after Teddy’s nap that their conversation took an interesting turn.
“You told George that if you could choose to go with anyone to the ball that you’d want it to be
Harry doubted he’d ever seen him do so before, at least in such a free manner.
“Don’t call me… that.” He clarified.
“We’d sneak him in at night, or when there was no one there, Lee knew of course but he is a good friend and kept quiet. We used the map to stay clear of everyone.” George said.
A while later, George and Malfoy had moved to a side, probably to hide from prying eyes, and no one had made further questions. A unanimous agreement spread through all the Weasleys that this was a matter best solved at home.
“What?”
Without uttering a word, Harry moved to Malfoy's other side and with George's aid they lifted him up. As he grasped the blonde's waist, he felt the strong urge to feed something to the boy, lifting him was like lifting air. The fingers, that he hadn't seen before, were ghostly; the fair skin almost see-through and veins shining through it like blue neon due to the contrast with all the whiteness.
. As if he’d become unlovable because of something that had been entirely out of his control, something he had never had a say in. He could see George going through the same thought process because his expression was confused, angry, and pained.
“He found me at night in the Astronomy tower. He brought me sunflowers.” He stated, as if it were the most wonderful thing to ever happen to him. A sweet smile adorned his lips and Harry found himself wanting to photograph that moment and freeze that simple show of innocence and goodness forever.
“You are serious.”
The Blonde and the Redhead crossed the room and sat on the sofa, curling into one another as if it were the most natural thing to do.
“Alright then, can someone explain what just happened”
The shards of Draco’s brokenness had been so evident, so sharp at that instance that they could have cut through anything at all. Gosh, how could life be so unfair? And why was he so invested in this? A few years ago he would have rejoiced in the blonde's pain, a few months ago he would have felt pity but nothing more. But now… Now he wanted to burn the world down to keep the pain away from the Slytherin and he didn’t know why.
“I appreciate that Granger.
“Listen to me, young man.” She said. Her voice stern even if it was torn with tears. “We may not know each other very well and I may not have any lost love for your family but from what I can see you are a loving, sweet young man that has been dealt horrible cards in life. Despite it all, you seem to have maintained enough good in your heart to gain one of my son's friendship and the heart…” At that she faltered. Tears shining in her eyes. “The heart of another one of my sons. I do not know the entirety of your story yet, but I can tell you already that you are not alone. Whether Fred is here or not, you are now part of the family because he would’ve wanted it so and because I can in no good conscience leave a sweet child like you on its own.”
“They are my favorites” he admitted. “They are just so bright, so… happy.” The green-eyed boy’s insides warmed at the simple explanation but a part of him wondered if it could also be because sunflowers were so different from everything his family represented. Sunflowers stood out, in a simple and warm sort of way, instead of in a regal and unapproachable cold manner. He’d bet his firebolt that such a common plant would never be found on Malfoy grounds. Perhaps Draco liked them even more for that and Harry wished he could question him about it but decided to remain silent.

Georges furrow deepened. Fuck, he’d have to explain himself later. He didn’t know if he was ready to tell him
“And you kidnapped Harry Potter of all people”
“You were a prick Ron, that’s what” George spat. Harry was grateful that he avoided to mention Harry's wand-less and wordless magic, he wasn't up to thinking about that just yet either. His brother’s face went red with anger and before he could start the yelling again Harry interrupted.
“Snape?!” Ron screeched.
“What is going on?” Ron asked softly, echoing Harry’s thoughts, who was still crying but wasn’t sure why. He didn’t understand what was going on.
The twins had been delighted by Draco’s new found passion in the kitchen and tried enthusiastically all dishes and sweets brought to them by their little one. They even discussed introducing a range of pastries that could be sold at the shop. Truffles that changed someone’s hair colour and cupcakes that made one sprout wings were one of the few ideas they began working on with Draco as the mastermind behind it all.
“That sucks. I don’t know how you can stand her. Her voice is worse than that Golden Egg of Harry’s, and believe me, when he opened it, it almost left me deaf.” He said with clear disgust which made Draco chuckle.
Unbelieving grey eyes looked up to her face and he could see his lips mutter an “I’m sorry”. Luna being Luna simply took his face into her hands and once again kissed his temple. She then sat down, taking his hands in hers and proceeded to tell him a story. Harry couldn’t hear what she was talking about but he could guess it was probably about Nargles. Malfoys eyes widened in astonishment and incredulity.
“Isn’t it obvious?” He said, setting one arm on the blonde’s black and raising their clasped arms, as if they were to dance. “I am being an adequately  proper, preppy gentleman and am going to dance with you.” He said with an exaggerated upturn of his nose which mad him chuckle. And then... Then they were
“Let me guess, it has to do with blondie over there.”
Maybe it was due to the shock of the situation, or maybe it was something else, but Harry obeyed and moved forward to help George move the still sobbing Malfoy.
“Not really” He sighed.
The Aurors came and, just as George predicted they went directly for Malfoy. Harry was surprised to see an army of Weasleys, a Potter, a Lovegood and a Granger blocking the Aurors way towards Malfoy. The world must really have gone crazy, he thought. They argued with Robards, who personally came for the “Death Eater Scum”. George had to be held back from punching him in the face for that remark. Harry ended up having to throw around his name to ensure that Malfoy would be secure enough under their watch and that there was no need to take him in. Kingsley, who had been elected functioning Minister had been called in to decide on the matter, and after talking with Harry and a suddenly, but not surprisingly, law-knowledgeable Hermione, it was decided that having Malfoy under house arrest at The Burrow under the supervision of ministry official Arthur Weasley was perfectly within the parameters allowed by the law and so the Aurors, a grumpy Robards, and an extremely amused Kingsley Shacklebolt left the Great Hall.
“You can have whatever you want, dear.”
smell flowery.” Mumbled Draco, glaring at Ginny.
Draco chuckled. The situation was absolutely ridiculous. These two boys were ridiculous.
“Of course I am, I want you as far away from that monster as possible”
“Oh god…” Draco sobbed followed by hysterical laughter. There was a hint of joy, to Harry’s surprise, but the pain seemed to drown it almost immediately. “Oh, God Fred… Why?! Fuck, why did you leave me, my love?” The pleading was whispered to the little box resting in white, white fingers and Harry’s heart clenched with the words. Draco was crying now, full tears streaming down his face and, to his surprise, most of the room was sobbing, too. Harry found his eyes were wet as well, he wondered how any of them still had tears left.
If Draco thought life at the manor had been bad before, he’d been sorely mistaken. The moment he’d seen Potter show up on the grounds with an unmoving Cedric, he’d known things would forever be changed. He just wasn’t aware of how much.
He knew there was still much to know about Draco’s story, but for now, it could wait.
“How did no one realize you were staying at Gryffindor?”
"Don't be stupid, little one. You've still got me." Something about that didn't sit right with Harry, but he chose to ignore it.
"WHAT?!" Was the unanimous answer.
“I…” Draco begun. “You’ll find out later, we still have a lot of story to cover, but Harry is right, not using my last name, helps…”
“There is one thing I don’t understand?” Ron said in between mouthfuls of food. “Why were you always a little shit at school? I mean, your father wasn’t there, right?”
“Yes, I do.” He answered, “Everything will come out at the trial and I’d rather you found out before then.”
George, who hadn’t let go of Draco once, tightened his grip around him and spoke. The other looked at him gratefully, as if he had to regain his energy before speaking again. Not for the first time, Harry wondered at how strong the bond between the Malfoy heir and the twins had to be.
Harry’s heart soared at the relief and love that exuded from the pair. Tears fell down both their eyes but for once, he didn’t mind them. These were tears of joy. Of loved ones finding each other again. A sniffle made him look to his right and he saw Hermione embraced by Ron in a tight hug. Her eyes glistened as well.
George had paced from one side of the room to the other muttering to himself all the ways in which he’d kill Lucius and all of his friends for ever laying a hand on his little brother. Fred was torn between comforting his distraught boyfriend and running off to dismember Grayback limb by limb.
“You don’t have to,” Hermione said, understanding and kindness in her eyes. Gods how Harry loved her at that moment for saying those words.
“Idiots is what you are…” He mumbled.
"Yeah. You never wondered how Potterwatch had so much intel? Draco has been feeding us information on what was going on at the Manor since this all started."
Returning home had been more nerve wracking and scary than ever. He’d been greeted by a morosely looking Leaf and one look at her told her this would be the worse summer yet. The house was full with guests that were spending more time than usual at his “home”. Guests he knew were death eaters, guests whose eyes would gleam in delight when he avoided them or cowed away in fright.
George snorted at that.
“For six-year. I… I didn’t know what that spell did.” George fixed his eyes on him angrily and Harry had to look away, unable to meet his gaze.
He wanted to ask, but, of course, he didn't.
many times. You don't even know. What... What they did... to me. You don't know." The last words were barely a whisper. Tears were falling freely, he knew, and even though Harry couldn't see his face, he suspected something inside him would probably break if he did. "I wanted to end it but I didn't, George. I
was quite… displeased. He decided to mark me. Usually, it's considered an honor, but even that was supposed to be a punishment for me. He wanted to brand me. To make sure that… that I was nothing but a pet. That I belonged to him.” A deafening silence washed over the room and he wondered, by George’s frown, if Draco had ever opened up about this to him. He wondered if Fred had known. “He gave me a suicidal mission. To kill Dumbledore. He expected me to fail and die. And my father had fallen out of his graces so while the previous year I had been off-limits to my father's colleagues. I was… I was fair game then.”
Well hello there. I am truly sorry for abandoning this as I did.
“Well then” He said, standing up and offering his hand to Draco. “would you do me the honor of being inappropriately appropriate with me?” He said with a smirk on his lips, although there was something else in his eyes. Nervousness? That couldn’t be it.
“I thought I told you to call me your highness.”
Sorry about the late updates.
“Yeah, that.” He confirmed. “Just, don’t.”
“Leaf!”

He wondered grumpily. The saviour looked terrible, he realised. He had bags under his eyes and his skin was ashen, unlike its usual dark golden tone. His usually unruly hair seemed… defeated, in a way. It made him want to scream. Wasn’t Potter supposed to be happy? He’d won!
Draco’s face had whipped around at the sound of the door and froze at the sight of the twins by the entrance. He was standing there in naught by his pants and all of his secrets, his fears and his shame were engraved on his skin, bare for them to see. His eyes darted across the room, trying to find a way out, a way to hide, but it was too late, they had seen all there was to see. They were now before the real Draco Malfoy, the one that was worth nothing, that deserved nothing but scorn, hate and pain. He hunched in on himself, preparing for the blow that was sure to come, the laughs, the humiliation. This action did not go unnoticed by the observant redheads and their frown deepened further.
“I don’t know.”  Harry nodded, it was a fair answer. His eyes drifted down and Harry saw that the engagement ring was on his hand. It was a beautiful piece. Refined like Draco but in a very different way, he’d expected. It was made of silver with elegant twists and small black stones embedded on them. In the center, a bright black diamond laid, with small golden sunflowers on each side of it. He’d never seen a more beautiful ring and he thought it perfectly suited this new Draco.
Honestly, people should just mind their own business. There was no need for them to gawk at him at every little misstep he did. Admittedly, it was not the first time he had come rushing through the Ministry like that. But the case he had been working on that week was taking a toll on his sleeping habits. And Harry couldn't possibly be blamed if he had overslept because of it. For a brief moment he wondered when was the last time he had a proper night sleep.
Hermione peered over his shoulder and gasped, watching in fascination as the ink moved across the page to form words that hadn’t been there a moment ago. “It changed again,” Harry murmured as he read.
“See? I told you it bites —
Harry sighed, slumping down his chair. He’d always hated this part of his job. No matter what role he played during the interrogation. “Yes,” he told the Auror again, “he came to my office. He dragged me to the Department Of Mystery and lead me into that room. We started arguing and the Time Turner exploded.”
