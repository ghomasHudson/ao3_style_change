“Hello Draco.” Snape said grimly. He looked so solemn Draco worried for a moment if someone had died.
“Brilliant! You did it.” He jumped up and grabbed Harry’s hands. Harry pulled him into a hug, grinning broadly.
“Run.” Severus placed his hands on both sides of Draco’s face and nodded solemnly. It was the most affection Severus had ever shown him. Hell it was more affection than his own father had ever shown him. He didn’t know what to think anymore. Who was this man? Why did he kill Dumbledore but continue to show Draco tenderness?
“Whatever, let’s not get into it right now.” Draco was fairly sure they had already gotten into it but he bit his tongue.
Draco sighed and tucked the letter away in a box. How was he supposed to wait a whole day (or possibly longer?) to meet Harry. Ever since he was a small boy he had been dreaming of this day. And now that it was so close he was a mess of nerves. What if Harry didn’t even like him? What if they never became friends? Draco pushed those thoughts away hastily. No of course he and Harry would be friends. They had to.
“You-” He pointed at Draco. “Could be killed, or tortured. And you.” He whirled on Harry. “He is just another way for the dark lord to hurt you.”
If it had been at any other moment Draco would’ve spent a good 20 minutes taking in the basilisk skeleton. However it was not any other moment and Draco was sprawled on the floor while everyone else was shouting.
“Sorry,” he called back. “Couldn’t sleep.” He dragged a hand over his face. This was ridiculous. He wasn’t dying. Yes. He was dying actually. Draco couldn’t stop thinking about Harry bloody Potter.
“You’ll do great, don’t worry.” He opened his mouth to thank her, but no words came out. She gave him a quick smile, then disappeared into the kitchen. The second she was gone a knock sounded at the door and Draco started. How she had known Harry was here he had absolutely no idea. Maybe mothers just had a knack for this sort of thing. He opened the door quickly, not even embarrassed about the huge grin plastered across his features.
It was nearing the end of school when Potter disappeared. He was used to this by now but it never got any easier. What made the whole thing ten times worse was that he had taken Luna with him. Luna was gone. She was gone and he was about to lose his shite. Scratch that, he already had lost his mind. The second he’d heard she was gone from Pansy he had sprinted Severus. Earlier that day all of them had had a confusing scuffle with Umbridge in which she threatened to crucio Potter. After she had said that Draco had knocked her out with a simple stunning spell. And everyone stared at each other before sprinting off in opposite directions. Now Draco was once again pounding on Severus’s office door.
Once all the students had gotten back, Draco was trying not to look too eager as he sat with Luna in the library. It was taking nearly all of his self control not to run outside and snog Harry in front of everyone. Which was a terrible idea, he knew this very well, but he could certainly dream.
“Oh.” Draco said, his shoulders sagging a little bit. He had been looking forward to seeing Luna on the train. It had become somewhat of a tradition over the years.
“I love you too.” He laid his head against the bars and let Harry brush the hair gently out of his eyes. He let himself feel Harry’s cold hand against his sweaty one, and their foreheads now pressed together. His heart rate began to slow as Harry rubbed slow circles across the back of his thumb. Draco stepped back and raised his wand. He closed his eyes, thought about running back up the stairs and out the door. But that wouldn’t do anyone any favors. The incantation left his lips and he opened his eyes to find Harry’s confused ones staring back at him. He bolted up the stairs and to his room. He grabbed a vase from his bedside table and threw it at the wall. He watched as the glass shattered and the tiny broken pieces were flung all over the room. He screamed along with it.
“Ay, student out of bed.” Flich said in a low voice. Draco could practically feel his smirk. Honestly, didn’t he have anything better to do?
“Mate!” Weasley’s voice cracked in dismay. He too was staring at their hands. Potter abruptly let go and wiped his hands on his robes. Draco blinked quickly. It was fine, it was fine.
“Hey, do you think it’s safe to get takeaway for dinner?” Ginny came into the room holding a small folded paper. “This Indian place looks really good and-” She stopped short, raising her eyebrows. “What were you guys doing?”
“I have not!’ He gasped, but he was smiling. Then his smile faltered a little. “What do you mean you think Theo likes me?”
Fuming in his dormitory that night Draco stuffed the letter into his box while blinking furiously. It wasn’t fair. Draco had tried to do everything right so Harry would like him. And now his nightmare had become reality. Harry didn’t like him. Harry didn’t think Draco was good enough for him. Choking a little Draco swallowed hastily before anyone could hear him. He wiped the tears from his eyes and left to go join his true friends.
“Draco, sir. My name is Draco.” He left out the Malfoy part, save someone decided to kidnap him by recognition of it.
“That’s fine.” he said, swallowing hard. His heart was pounding so hard he wouldn’t have been surprised if everyone could hear. She pulled him into a hug before motioning towards the door. Together they walked down the stairs. Towards the dark lord. He was still seated eerily at the table, tracing his fingers along the smooth wood of it. He was so pale, nothing about him was human.
“Er-” he began, not knowing what he was actually planning to say. But he was cut off as Granger stormed to him and slapped him across the face.
“Yeah mate come on we’re trying to sleep.” Theo mumbled. Draco hadn’t realized that he had been tossing and turning in his bed, clutching the letter to his chest.
“Hey at least we’re in this together.” Theo said, not quite looking at him. Draco had a feeling they weren’t quite in this together, as they had barely spoken in months since that kiss.
“I don't know.” Draco said, doing his best to keep his voice steady. No one said anything for the rest of the train ride.
I know I haven’t written in a while. But I am so angry at I'm not even sure who, and I don’t know what else to do. I don’t write in a diary. That seems like a bad idea. Anyway that’s not the point. Today Ginvera Weasley wrote you a Valentine. And I had to watch that dwarf come and sing to you. Now don’t think I’m mad because I care about you or something like that. We were going to have a proper duel finally. I was thrilled to at last get to fight with you in front of everyone. Or to fight you in general. It had been much too long since we had last stood mere feet apart, screaming at each other. I didn’t realize how much I missed the excitement of fighting with you until I stood there, facing you. I couldn’t resist the urge to make a snide remark, for I knew that would make you stay. Make you fight with me and ignore everyone around us. Hence the reason I am now pissed beyond belief. Ginny Weasley, the little brat, had to go and ruin it all with her dreadful Valentine. We never got a chance to finish Potter. We will one day though.
“Yes! Yes, he was talking about you. That’s what I just said.” She groaned. “Come onnnnn. What’s the worst that can happen?”
Sorry about my last letter. I was interrupted by my mother and the dark lord asking me to take the mark. No, I’m not joking. That was actually what happened. I’m a fucking death eater. I hate everything. At least he’s gone for now, I have no idea where he went and I couldn't care less. I have the house to myself right now actually. Mother and my Aunt have gone somewhere, Aunt Bellatrix looked like she was trying to stop my mother from doing something but I couldn’t imagine what. My Aunt was terrifyingly thrilled that I had “finally” accepted the dark mark. You should’ve seen the way her eyes gleamed when I showed her the new mark on my arm. I could hear my mother crying half the night after I was branded. I sat here and pondered my new task. I have to kill Dumbledore. The headmaster. The dark lord wants me (ME) to kill the most powerful wizard in the world. I am fairly sure he has given me this task so that I can fail. There is no way in the entire wizarding world that I could kill him. First of all, I don’t want to. And secondly, even if I did, there is literally no way I could. I mean, he’s Dumbledore. He’s on chocolate frogs and has entire volumes written about him and his achievements. I, a 16 year old boy, am somehow supposed to murder him? No, no of course not. This is a punishment for my father’s failure in getting something done for him. So naturally I am the one who faces the consequences. I wonder how my family got involved with the dark lord in the first place. Not that it matters now. I’m already stuck in this fate so there’s no use thinking about everything that could’ve been. Well this has been depressing. I think I will mope around and try not to think too hard.
Okay. So maybe that was fair. He didn’t know much about the dark lord because his parents had always tried to shield him from that part of their lives. And Draco was very glad for that. But now...he was back and there would be no shielding Draco from any of that. He wasn’t stupid. He knew soon enough he would see the dark lord.
“What’s wrong Draco?” Luna asked, sitting beside him in the library. He knew better by now than to hide things from Luna.
“Is she okay?” he asked Luna, motioning his head to where Ginny had run to. Mostly just to get his mind off the blood covering his hands.
Ginny rolled her eyes. “That can’t be, we know he’s not on our side now, he killed Dumbledore for crying out loud!”
“Get out of here Malfoy!” Weasley yelled. Draco wasn’t sure why he was yelling. He hadn’t even done anything this time. Potter met his eyes briefly, Draco could not read the expression on his face. An overwhelming desire came over him to run his hands through Potter’s hair and kiss him. His face grew even redder and he quickly ran the other direction, for he feared if he was there a moment longer desire would overcome him and he would do exactly what he wanted.
Draco tried not to feel the hurt pulsing through him. Luna was with Potter. She had somehow discovered the secret to being near him. He sucked in a breath.
“FIND HIM!” Bellatrix was screaming from atop the Slytherin table. Him. She had to be talking about him. Harry and Hermione had disappeared in the chaos, and he wanted to search for them...yet the thought of Bellatrix finding him and pressing her wand to his throat had already burned itself into his brain. And he was too fucking scared to go looking for them with her right there. So he ran. Again. Intending to find Luna and take her with him. Where, he did not know. Just away. Away from whatever was going to happen. He didn’t find her. He was searching the library when Amycus found him and told them they were going home. That the dark lord wasn’t going to be happy with him but he would still have earned glory. At first Draco hadn’t understood. Glory? Amycus had scoffed and looked at him like he was an idiot. Yes, glory. You’re the reason we were able to take over Hogwarts. And fuck, while we were at it we captured Harry Potter.
“No.” he said in a low voice, running both hands over his face. It couldn’t be over so quickly. They hadn’t been together that long. How could he have screwed it up that fast?
“Harry! Harry stop, we're right here!” Hermione ran after him, giving up completely on the pretense of being quiet. He hurried after her, feeling his insides already begin to heat up. Now was the worst possible moment for him to feel all tingly and mushy inside. He nearly crashed into Granger as he left the room, she was gripping Harry’s shoulders and shaking him slightly.
He gave the letter to a school owl and drew in a long breath. Hopefully his father listened to him for once. He was going to head to dinner but three sprinting figures distracted him. Potter, Weasley, and Granger were all running out of the great hall and burst out the door. No one else seemed to notice but Draco. He thought for one second and then took off running after them. He trailed them down to the school grounds where they ran into Hagrid’s hut. Draco stood on the hill overlooking the grounds, not knowing what to do. He stood there, and then decided he might as well wait to see what would happen.
I’ve just been scarred for life. I heard a broom closet rattling and I thought there was a boggart in there. But oh no, there was no boggart. There was one Ginny Weasley and one Luna Lovegood making out like the world was about to end. I got scared. I started having these feelings. Because Luna is like my little sister who is much much much smarter than me. And she’s all grown up now. Making out with someone in a broom closet. I don’t know why but I was so happy for her I almost started crying when I saw them. Ginny slammed the door in my face and I could only assume they continued to make out. Wow. I feel a lot of things right now Potter. And I just wanted to tell you because my last letter was oh so dreary. I think my best friend has a girlfriend. AHHHHHHHHH.
“And I was going to throw it away, because we can just make new ones now. But then I noticed that this one had a message on it.” She showed them the coin, even though he couldn’t read the message from here.
Draco put a hand to the back of his neck awkwardly. He didn’t know what to say to that. It was true after all.
“I’m glad.” she said, pulling him into a hug. He hugged her back, breathing in the scent of her lavender shampoo. All too soon she was gone and Draco was alone again with nothing but an undelivered letter under his pillow, and a lonely feeling in his chest. Draco didn’t write again for months.
“Severus was here?” He asked, not sure he had heard right. Harry stared at him with an odd expression on his face.
Three months later they got married on the front steps of Hogwarts, with all of their friends there. Hermione sobbed through the entire thing, Ron awkwardly patted her on the back and she blew her nose in his jacket as a response. He didn’t seem to mind much. The whole thing was really lovely, and Draco couldn’t believe he had somehow gotten happier in the span of one glorious day.
She gave Draco a worried look. “I can bandage her wounds after we staunch the blood flow. After that though...we’re going to need potions. And I don’t think the mending charm is supposed to be used on wounds like this.” Her eyes filled with tears and she moved closer to Draco so Hermione couldn’t hear. “We’re really going to need to get potions Draco. She might-she might die if we don’t.” She pressed a hand to her mouth and let the tills spill over.
“Cruciatus, Voldemort slapped me once.” He pointed at the bruise on his face. Draco’s chest squeezed and he reminded himself to breathe. He couldn’t lose it now, they still had to get out of here.
“Ginevra asked me to be her girlfriend this summer.” she said, all of a sudden grinning. A blush was also creeping up her neck and she rocked back and forth on her heels.
“I am his head of house.” Severus spoke in a familiar low and dangerous tone. “Come along Draco.” He drew up his mental shields and followed Severus out warily.
“No, we haven’t even been on the train that long, we still have half the ride left.” Blaise replied, looking around. No one said anything else and Draco wondered if perhaps some type of serial killer had broken onto the train when the car door slid open quietly. Pansy let out a squeak and the rest of the Slytherins drew their wands but Luna quickly said,
“Oh, well.” Theo was rocking on his heels and smiling a little. What exactly was going on? Was Draco imagining all of this?
“Come on, tell us! You worried us sick, we wanna know where the hell you went!” Ginny said, sitting up, nearly knocking Luna off her. Luna tapped lightly on Ginny’s leg, as if asking her to calm down.
“Thanks.” she smiled. “I better get back, do you wanna come sit with us?” And for a moment Draco thought about saying yes. He imagined that he was Potter’s boyfriend and he would be reuniting with him after a long summer apart. They would kiss and then he would hold Potter’s hand and smile like an idiot for the rest of the train ride.
Draco soon gave up trying to eat and perched on a chair, knee bouncing up and down in a steady rhythm. His mother was sitting next to him, humming softly. She seemed much happier with his father gone as well. Nowadays she actually smiled every once and a while.
It was only a couple weeks into summer and Draco was already miserable. He had barely seen his father and mother all summer, and thus he had no way to get Potter off his mind. They seemed to be fighting most of the time now. Over what he had no idea. Before this summer they had rarely fought. And even then it had all been in hushed whispers immediately quieted when Draco walked into the room. His father had promised that they would go to the Quidditch cup though. At least he had that to look forward to. The only thing he really had to distract him was Luna. They continued to write letters to each other over the summer and she told him all about the Quibbler and some bizarre stories about some sort of unheard of creature. Whenever he read her letters he was able to forget about Potter and his parents. For a little while at least. It seemed whenever he was trying to sleep and get some peace of mind Potter would always wander to the forefront of his thoughts. He never knew why this happened. Just that every night for Merlin knew how long, Potter had been the last thing he had thought about. Draco would have been more concerned if the feeling that came over him when he thought about Potter wasn’t so pleasant.
“Fine, I know. I won’t do it again. I’m going to go make some coffee, I have a headache.” And with that she stormed into the kitchen. Draco could hear the slam of the coffee pot and hear her hiss angry incantations.
Hellooooo. Here's the next chapter! And I actually like this chapter somehow so I really hope you guys do to. Next chapter should be up in a week or a little longer than that. And please review because I love reading them! *sends love*
Still neither of their feet moved from under the table. Draco wondered how long this was going to go on for. He was a tad worried that he didn’t mind the comforting weight of Potter’s foot on his. But it was comforting, and somehow steadying there under the table.
“OH NO YOU DON’T LADDIE!” Draco saw a flash of purple and watched in utter horror as everything grew ten times the size. He tried to scream but all that came was a high pitched squeak. He did his best to get to his feet but he realized that he already was on them. All four of them. He did his best to scream again and flopped onto his back. He rolled around the ground screaming for someone to turn him back. He was some sort of creature. He was a creature. Would he be like this forever? Strong hands came to grasp him and he stopped squirming. The hands were warm and held him gently. He was able to breathe again and settled himself against the person's chest. All too soon he was being ripped away and the same flash of purple light appeared.
“I think so, it’s mostly because of the chamber back in first year. It’s not really my place to tell you, but you can ask her later. She’s pretty open about it now.” Luna said quietly, as she peeled Hermione’s shirt off as gently as she could.
He felt a jolt of anger and annoyance. Why did his godfather always have to intrude on everything he did?
“They left! I have no fucking idea where but they’re not here and-and, I don’t know what we’re supposed to do.” She sobbed a little, wringing her hands out. Draco wanted nothing more than to join her in sobbing, however he took another shuddering breath and did his best to compose himself.
“Are you mental! We can’t leave him outside!” Ginny yelled. Draco could picture her with her hands on her hips, glaring at Harry. He was glad he wasn’t on the receiving end of that glare.
“Is Harry still in your house?” She asked, voice shaking. His pulse quickened and he fought the urge to begin pacing the room.
Draco felt hot tears burn the back of his throat, but he didn’t want to cry in front of Harry. Not right now anyway. When Harry was locked in a cell.
Draco half wished he had been placed in Ravenclaw. He loved the Slytherins, and all Malfoys were supposed to be in Slytherin. But it would be nice not having to worry about Slytherin things all the time. Ravenclaw seemed almost uncomplicated. What was he thinking? If he had been in Ravenclaw he would’ve been a complete and utter disgrace to the Malfoy name. His father never would’ve forgiven him. It was rather that the Ravenclaws were much more welcoming than the Slytherins. Or at least Luna was.
Many were dead and those who were still alive seemed to have a haunted sort of look in their eyes. Draco had hardly recognized his own reflection when he starred in the mirror the morning after. Though now after a few months of mind healing and quiet conversations he was doing much better. He hoped others could say the same. To be perfectly honest he didn’t know what he was going to do with the rest of his life. So it was a good thing really that he was going to go back to school with Harry and the rest of their friends.
“I’m sorry, hey it’s okay.” Tears had started to pool from her eyes and she wrapped her arms around herself.
“Er, hi. Sorry about not getting back to you.” Draco said with a small shrug. Pansy shook her head and glanced around to make sure no one was listening.
“How did you…” She stopped as well, her head tilted and eyes questioning. He shook his head. He wasn’t sure he should tell her about what he had done to Harry. Although she most definitely would’ve agreed it was for the best.
Draco did see Harry after. Only it wasn’t how he had expected. Everything had happened so fast Draco wasn’t really sure anything had been real at all. First he and Harry were searching for the snake, which they of course did not find. Second the whole school (besides a few Slytherins) had all rallied together to fight off the dark lord and his followers. Then Harry and Draco had gone into the forest and watched Severus get attacked by a snake. For a few seconds there Draco had been sure he was dead, however he shakily raised a vial to his lips and dragged himself to his feet looking around. Draco had run to him immediately, wanting reassurance that he was going to be okay.
“You idiot.” Ginny groaned, falling onto the couch. “You nearly gave me a fucking heart attack.” She covered her eyes with her hands. Draco shared in the sentiment.
Draco felt suddenly more uncomfortable. “It’s-” Fine. He was going to say. But it was still not fine. “I forgive you.” He said instead.
Draco twisted his hands and glanced at Harry. He seemed rather annoyed and opened his mouth to say something but Draco shook his head a little. Harry caught the motion and stayed silent. Draco never liked to mess with Severus when he was angry.
The rest of the night Draco lay awake in his bed, staring at the ceiling in silence. He tried to quiet his mind with other thoughts, but none came to them except that Potter was missing, once again. After a completely restless night, Draco left the Slytherin common room, an utter mess. He hadn’t slept at all, and there was a persistent knot in the center of his stomach that wouldn’t go away.
It didn’t take long for Draco to realize that he knew absolutely nothing about Muggles. Shite. He should've taken Muggle studies. Their currency was bloody confusing. Pounds and pence. He couldn’t understand any of it. After nearly an hour of talking with a more and more confused innkeeper, he managed to get a room inside the Motel Mirth. Draco was quite surprised to find that it looked much like his room inside the Leaky Cauldron.
Harry shook his head and smiled. “Morning.” he repeated. His mouth began to turn down at the corners and he grabbed Draco’s arm. The one with the mark. The sleeve had ridden up, exposing the dark mark.
“Okay okay! I will. So I still had one of these in my bag.” Hermione reached inside her pocket and pulled out the little gold coins they had used to communicate. Ginny opened her mouth but Luna nudged her, more firmly this time.
“Oh dear Merlin.” Tonks rolled her eyes and stormed the other way. Draco bit back another smile and followed them out of the train. As they were walking Draco wondered if he could hold Potter’s hand. Was that okay? Why did Tonks have to come right when they had been about to figure things out? And, what was going to happen to them now?
“Oh. How long have you been here?” he asked. Had she witnessed him on the verge of a mental breakdown? He’d probably been muttering nonsense while walking back and forth.
“ I think Harry is going to go to London later under the invisibility cloak, you should go with him.” Ginny said conversationally, crossing her legs to try and appear more nonchalant.
“It’s hot.” Hermione deadpanned, before snorting into her own cup. “You should’ve blown on it first.”
“Yes! Yes, she’s so sweet and she doesn’t call me names, and she’s pretty and smart and helps me find my shoes.” Luna gushed her eyes bright.
“Hi.” Draco replied, placing his hand on the back of Harry’s neck. He shivered a little and leaned closer. Their lips brushed softly, Draco opened his mouth to allow their tongues to sweep together delightfully. All the worry in his stomach vanished as Harry pulled back, grinned, and took his hand.
“Damn.” Weasley muttered, he hurriedly stuffed the thing back in his trunk and motioned for Granger and Potter to follow him. Draco couldn’t breath as he watched Potter. Look this way. He silently willed. Notice me please. Potter turned his head and his eyes met Draco for the briefest of moments before he turned his head away abruptly. A flush was creeping up Potter’s neck and Draco felt his cheeks begin to heat. They were gone and Draco groaned, flopping back against his seat. Luna was sitting very straight, her eyes bright and smiling.
So he found himself wandering the corridors at night, intending to return to the room of requirement. Not really to work on the wardrobe, the solution for solving it was fairly simple, he merely wanted to sit there so he didn’t have to surround himself with people he was constantly lying to. He hadn’t expected to get caught as he knew that Slughorn was having his little gathering this evening and students were likely to be around the area. However on his way to the room of requirement he realized too late that Ms. Norris had been tailing him. Bloody cat.
“Thanks-” He had been about to say something else but Draco couldn’t wait any longer. He kissed Harry Potter this time. And it was just as perfect as the first. It was as if their mouths were made for each other, they melted into each other and Draco was so happy he could scream. He let his fingers wander into Harry’s hair and felt the softness of it. He loved his hair so much. He loved everything about this boy.
“Shall we call the dark lord then?” Bellatrix asked, already clasping her forearm eagerly. Draco could feel his heart pounding in his throat. What had he done?
A few weeks later Harry told him about a funeral that he had gone to the previous night. For a giant spider named Aragog. That certainly had not been what he was expecting Harry to tell him when he said he wanted to tell him something. They were in the room of requirement, their legs tangled together as they sat on the couch that had appeared when they entered.
Blowing out a breath Draco folded the letter and put it away. He wondered if he would ever actually give these letters to Harry. Perhaps when they were older and all this was very far behind them. He didn’t know what to do. He was trapped in an ever enclosing box with no perceivable way out. If he pounded his fists on any side, it would topple on top of him and everyone he cared about. He drove the heels of his palms into his eyes and shuddered a shallow breath.
The crowd began to murmur and Draco hastily continued. “In Muggle London, he met up with me there a couple days ago. Apparently he assumed he could trust me.” He laughed, but it was hollow to his ears.
“Oh, it’s you.” He turned to face Severus, who had just appeared from behind the tall trees in front of the mansion. The man seemed to have a talent for making appearances at dramatic moments.
“GONE!” Draco yelled, in the chaos no one heard him. There was so much screaming around him it caused Draco’s head to feel distant. He felt as if he was watching the scene from another body. There was a ripple going through the crowd. The words he’s back passed from person to person.
“I can go out and check-” Draco started but was interrupted by the bang of the front door. The three of them pulled their wands out and pointed them at the intruder. Hermione walked in, yanking a slippery, silver cloak off her.
So you are alive. Well good for you. You’re alive and you won the house cup and stole it from Slytherin. In addition to you, I now hate Dumbledore. What horrid old man would embarrass a fourth of his school in front of everyone? Why does he even like you? You and your two sidekicks didn’t do anything spectacular. We worked hard all year and you-you broke all the bloody rules and still got the celebration. Guess that’s another thing to add to the list of reasons why I hate you. At least you're not dead. Then I would have to kill you myself for leaving me here with no enemies. Bye for now Potter. Have a rightfully awful summer and an even worse life.
She blinked and turned her head a little. “Figure out what?” He winced, he would need to be more careful with his words.
Hermione’s eyes widened, and a smile began to spread across her face. “The wards, I know how to take down the wards in your house Draco.” Well that surely wasn’t what Draco had been expecting.
“Hi.” he replied, following her gaze. A little ways away Potter stood awkwardly with one of the Patil twins. He tried to take in a steady breath and look as if he was unbothered. He was fine. Everything was fine. This was fine.
“Come on, Harry’s got something to tell you.” she nodded at Potter. And then her eyes swept back to his. Bloody hell. Was he going to walk away without a scrape? Thank Merlin. Weasley was turning away and Draco would have done the same but he noticed something in Weasley’s fist. His newspaper. Now he knew it was stupid to get so worked up over something such as a newspaper.  But it was the first piece of mail his father had sent him in weeks.
“How could you not tell me!” She yelled, gripping her hair in frustration. “I had to think you two were still kidding yourselves, coming to me for advice about the other person, it's been driving me insane!”
“I’m not. Down. Not at all. This is me being happy.” He tried a smile but was sure he only succeeded in looking constipated.
“Harry!” Hermione’s eyes grew wide and she shot an apologetic look towards Draco. “He rescued you, you have to remember that!”
“Shhh. I need to think.” Luna muttered. She clamped her lips together firmly, though Draco didn’t miss the fact that she was shaking like mad. He wiped at his eyes, now was really not the time for him to fall apart. But fuck it. He hated feeling so helpless.
“Urgh, what?” Came Ginny’s sleepy voice. He heard soft footsteps approach and Luna opened the door, her hair messily strewn across her face.
We don’t have to be enemies on Christmas right? I’m fairly certain that’s the rule. On Christmas there is no such thing as enemies. Because, it’s Christmas, duh. There’s not any particular reason I’m writing this time. Father and Mother love me I know, but they don’t have time for me sometimes. And I understand. But I would like to have a friend. Or enemy. To talk to when they’re doing, whatever it is they do. Honestly, adults are rather strange. Though that’s not the point. The point is, I’m grateful for you Potter. Even though we are enemies instead of friends you never ignore me. And...well that has to count for something? So have a happy Christmas Harry.
Harry rolled his eyes and nodded pointedly at the empty cafe. There were two girls kissing in the corner booth, and a half asleep waitress leaning over the counter. Other than that however, there was no one.
“It’s me.” Croaked Hermione’s voice from outside the door. His first instinct was to fling open the door and make sure she was alright, but he held himself back.
“Oh are you talking about sex? Obviously I know all about that.” Draco shook his head at Severus’ silliness.
Draco Malfoy is not in love with Harry Potter. Bloody prat that he is. He only writes letters to him as his own special therapy and coping mechanism for these weird feelings that seem to pop up whenever Potter is around. This odd warm (kinda nice actually) feeling is completely normal. Right? A story about letters, love, and the power of believing in each other.
Draco rose to his feet and crept up the stairs. He didn’t want to wake anyone with the terrible creaking noise they always seemed to make. It was so early in the morning it was basically still night. He was very sure Ginny would have his head if he woke her up at this hour. She was by no means a morning person. His heart stuttered a bit as he stopped in front of Harry’s bedroom. He could still destroy this letter. Half of him wanted to rip it to shreds and never think about it again. However the other half of him, the lovesick half, was filled with so much hope at what would happen if he gave this letter to Harry. He leaned his forehead against the door and took in a quiet breath. Slowly, he slipped the letter under the door and sat down on the stairs. He was surprised to find that he felt no sense of dread. Only excitement. Draco couldn’t help the smile that spread across his face. He didn’t even know what Harry would think of it. Yet he was already so blissfully happy, any sense of dread was banished to a faraway place in his mind.
Hey guys! Sorry it took so long for this chapter to be out. But it's pretty long so I hope everyone likes it. I'm guessing the next chapter should be out in a week or so. Anyway, happy reading :p
“It’s fine, I’ll get over it. See you around I guess.” Theo pushed past him about to leave but Draco quickly said,
Draco wanted to sprint in the other direction. Every bone in his body seemed to scream at him to run. This wasn’t his home. This was where he had been forced into taking the dark mark, where-
He ignored the way his chest ached as she said his name. “Alright then. I’ll send you the signal soon.” He took out his DA coin and nodded at her.
Madam Pince glowered at them for several seconds before sweeping away with one nasty look back. Harry was standing stiffly, rocking back and forth.
“I think I can help with that.” He was smiling even more now and Draco knew what was going to happen a second before it did. He glanced up and to his utter horror there was mistletoe above them. Shit. Shit. Theo was going to-
“I was-” He swallowed thickly. “I was forced to take the dark mark, as a punishment for my father’s failures.” Granger’s eyes grew wide but she said nothing.
“You’re going to need to put some of your blood on the house, and after that say your name. If I’m correct, which I don’t mean to sound conceited but I know I am, the wards should fall for a couple seconds. Then you can go in. Once you’re inside you can bring them down permanently since the house will have recognised you. You can get the potions, and then get Harry and you should be able to apparate right back. I think.”
“No, no, it’s fine. It will just make things worse.” He shut his mouth in horror. He hadn’t meant to say that.
“Hey! I know where Harry Potter is!” He screamed at the top of his lungs, doing his best to look confident. He crossed his arms and glared at everyone, praying the lot of them could hurry the hell up. All the chatter in the room went deadly silent, and hundreds of heads swept his way. Draco blinked, then continued.
P.S. I met this lovely Ravenclaw girl. I simply need to make sure you don’t make fun of her. I know you and Weasel have a talent for hurting people’s feelings. Her name is Luna Lovegood and I believe she was sorted into Ravenclaw. So...just keep your words to yourself this time. Please.
Oh. Now Draco felt a little less alone. Someone else he knew liked guys too. He tapped his quill to his lips and then wrote a reply. After finishing he sent the letter off with Theo’s owl, who had returned moments earlier, as if sensing they had another letter that needed to be delivered.
“I’m shite at Occlumency, they’ll find out soon enough.” About them. Everything they had done in the past year. No, not in the past year. In the past five. Draco shook his head.
Oh. Well he supposed it wouldn’t hurt to tell her. Or maybe it would. Perhaps it wasn’t such a good-
I'm back! Thank you so much to everyone who left kudos it made me so happy! The first couple chapters are probably going to be pretty short, but starting at year 4 I think they're going to get rather long. Just a heads up. Anyway, thank you so much for reading ;)
“You're leaving.” he said softly, turning his head upwards. The clouds had darkened ominously and Draco cursed himself for not leaving sooner. He was going to have to fly through the rain.
“Of course! She’s brilliant and amazing, and oh my goodness her hair is so soft and nice to touch.” Luna giggled and the sound was bright and bubbly. A sharp contrast to her tone only moments ago.
Those hadn’t been Draco’s terms but he was willing to compromise. He cleared his throat dramatically.
“I’ve asked you to come to my office several times of late.” It was true. But Draco was tired of being called in to have Severus lecture him about something or other. Lately he wanted to know what Draco had planned, how exactly he was going to accomplish this. And Draco was certainly not about to tell Severus that he had no bloody idea what he was doing. He was simply trying to stay alive, what else was there for him to do?
The dark lord wouldn’t just go running around Muggle London looking for him right? That would be ridiculous. Awkwardly Draco half stepped, half fell off his broom and swung it over his shoulder, getting a better grip on the bag as well. Thankfully, he had landed in a backalleway and there was no one around to wonder what the hell was doing. Draco didn’t really know himself so it would’ve been a painful hassle to explain. He jingled the money in his bag, he would need to go to Gringotts if he wanted to exchange it for Muggle money. Draco chewed his lower lip. Gringotts was open most hours of the day, would it be best if he went extremely early in the morning so there was less of a chance for someone to recognize him? Damn. He really hadn’t thought this through. Fuck it. There was nothing else for him to do. If someone recognized him, well he would just run in the other direction and hope they didn’t catch him. He swung open the door to the Leaky Cauldron and strode inside, doing his best to look like he had any place being in there.
“Don’t do that!” Luna said in exasperation. “I know it seems hopeless right now, okay? I’m not oblivious. I know it seems completely impossible from your point of view. But if there’s even the smallest chance in the whole world that you two might end up together you can cling to that. If you really do love him-Don’t look at me like that, you’ve always known I’m a sap.” Draco held his breath.
“Fine.” Draco turned away angrily and stormed the other direction. That wasn’t the end of it though. Moments later he saw Potter, dancing with Cho Chang. That turned his stomach more than anything that happened in the past hour. Hadn’t she come with Diggory? Diggory was nowhere in sight. Fuming Draco stormed out of the ball, looking forward to throwing himself on his bed and screaming. And maybe crying a tad as well. He was about to head up the stairs when Granger came running out of the ball as well. Her eyes were red and she looked livid.
Despite all of Harry’s reassurances, Draco’s stomach was twisted into fierce knots when it was time to return to school. He awoke much too early with a feeling of dread buried in the pit of his stomach. Harry was with the Weasley’s at the moment, so he was alone with his mother in the Mansion. Miraculously, she had escaped with only a house arrest for a couple months, and Draco had only been put on a two years probation. His father however, was in Azkaban for life. Draco couldn’t be happier about that. In the months since the war had ended life had been a blur for everyone. Draco had been to trial after trial, always with Harry at his side. He had met Teddy, who was still an adorable little bundle that only spoke in small whimpers and loud cries, but he loved him nonetheless.
If it was somehow possible, Umbridge’s eyes bulged further. She shook her head, a scary smile playing across her lips. “It. Was. An. Accident.”
I thought you were going to die there for a second. I mean, I’m fairly sure everyone thought you were dementor food. You fell and it looked like they were all going to swarm on top of you, and well, eat you. I’m just telling it how it is. You’re fine now. You ignored me as you walked out of the hospital wing with Granger and Weasley. Which is normal and to be expected. Something is very wrong with me, Potter. I felt happy when I heard you were okay. And I don’t understand why. I was happy that you were not dead. Why do I care, you might ask? Well to be perfectly honest I don’t even know myself. I don’t know why but I think I might care about you Potter. Not that it matters. I only care about you because you’re my enemy. That’s right. I have to go do some serious thinking now. I’m glad you didn’t fall to your death and imminent doom.
“Brilliant!” Luna smiled and her eyes held a luminous joy Draco had never seen there. At least he had made her happy. A little while later Draco, Luna, Theo, and Pansy were all freezing in the quidditch stands.
“I’ll get her some water for when she wakes up.” Ginny said, turning on her heel and practically sprinting out of the room. Draco pressed the towel to Hermione’s side as gently as he could.
“We have to tell Mcgonagall.” Hermione replied. “We’re wasting too much time just standing here doing nothing.”
Draco cleared his throat. Where on earth was Hermione? And where the fuck was Severus? Surely he didn’t expect Draco to deal with all these people alone, hell they could all murder him in a heartbeat.
All the Death Eaters began laughing to themselves before Severus hissed at them to be quiet, they were nearing the castle once more.
“Yay! See told you he’d say yes.” Pansy stuck her tongue out at Theo and smirked. Draco sighed, but smiled as well. At least they were happy. The day for the match between Slytherin and Gryffindor arrived and Draco was so nervous his stomach hurt. He wasn’t nervous for the actual match, he didn’t actually care about that. No he was nervous for when all of the Slytherins would burst into song and humiliate Weasley. And everyone knew no one insulted Potter’s best mate. There was a good chance Potter would curse you after that.
She studied him for a moment before continuing. “Okay...well, Harry gets really upset by everything that she says. And obviously it makes sense because it’s like she’s trying to turn everyone against him and make everyone believe he’s a liar. And seeing Cedric die was so terrible, and I hope you don’t think he tells me all of this. I'm just around him and Ginevra a lot now so I hear a bunch of stuff but that’s not that point. Anyway he’s terribly upset about Cedric’s death, and now Umbridge is trying to tell him that none of it happened and it’s all so terrible and awful and I hope a bunch of nargles crowd her brain and go out her nose!”
“How did you-how?” Harry stared at him unbelievingly. “Snape tried that a couple days ago.” He said in such a low tone Draco almost didn’t hear.
She gave them some spoons and sugar, before hurrying off in the opposite direction. There was a definite spring in her step.
“Grimmauld place.” Draco leaned back in his chair, trying to ignore the panic rising in his chest. He wasn’t sure what about the place made him quite so apprehensive. Perhaps the memory of his mother going there every year and coming back dejected, telling him about how the house hadn’t let her in, had tainted his feelings towards the place. He never understood why she kept going back there. She had hated Sirius, he thought. His mother had always wrinkled her nose at the mention of him. Yet every fall she had gone back, eyes bright when she returned. Once his father had told him about Walburga Black. The mother of Sirius and Regulus Black. Draco did not wish to relive that conversation. He had a vivid memory of feeling sick afterward. The story had left an awful aftertaste in his mouth. Thankfully his father had never repeated the story, or told anymore details of it. Draco was fairly sure his father admired their mother just a smidge.
“Alright.” A witch wearing bright green robes spoke first. “We will hear you out and then decide what to do with you.”
“Hermione and Luna are okay, they were being chased and they ended up bumping into dad.” Ginny brushed a hand against her eyes. “They’re safe now, and dad knows where Ron is so that’s good.”
“Clearly.” he set his cup down, not quite ready to taste it again. She rolled her eyes before casting a spell around them.
“Naturally.” He said in a low voice. Draco hurried out of the shop and tried not to look pleased with himself. Even though he was. Because perhaps he wouldn’t end up dead after all. He decided to stay hidden in an alcove for a few moments to see what Potter and his friends would do. He could hear them arguing and then seconds later Granger appeared out of the shadows. He held his breath, praying she didn’t see him. Her eyes were bright, and almost wild looking as she strode into the shop. He heard muffled talking inside the shop, but after only a brief minute or so she came back out, looking dejected and rather embarrassed.
You’ve gone back to pretending I don’t exist. This feels like last year after that kiss, except so much worse. I’m sorry, okay? But I had my reasons, I know that fact doesn’t excuse me from hiding this from you, believe me I know. I just didn’t know what to do. More like I didn’t know how to tell you, I was scared you would never look at me the same way again. Though I don’t have to worry about that now, you’ll probably never look at me for as long as you live. It doesn’t feel good to be invisible. Luna doesn’t understand what’s going on and I don’t know what to tell her. She deserves the truth but it will just put her in danger as well. I know you didn’t tell her about what I am, or else she would’ve confronted me by now most definitely. I wonder if you ever will. A part of me wants to tell her, because I know that she will be sympathetic and understanding as she nevers fails to be. I don’t like this feeling of loneliness. How could everything go from being so great to being so lonely and terrible? I can’t talk to my best friend about what’s going on and my (ex) boyfriend won’t even glance my way. Not to mention that all of this screws with the extremely flimsy plan that I had come up with. Well I’m not going to think of anything else because really, there is nothing else I can do short of killing Dumbledore myself. I’m just hoping that you don’t have me enough to dismiss the truth.
“Doing well Draco?” he asked softly. Draco pressed his lips together to stop them from shaking. Hot tears burned the back of his eyes and he squeezed them shut briefly.
“I’m gonna take that as a yes then.” she sighed and looked tired all of a sudden. “Look, I won’t tell anyone, alright? Just please, please be careful.” She massaged her temples and groaned. “Come on Harry, everyone’s been wondering where you went. And Draco too, Snape was looking for you.” Tonks turned her eyes upwards and heaved a great sigh.
“Death Eaters?” Neither of them said anything to that. They had really gone and fucked this one up. They had put everyone in the castle in danger. These people were ruthless, they wouldn’t care who they hurt in getting what they wanted done. Other business...Exactly what other business did they intend to get done tonight?
You think I’m bloody brilliant. I’m going to pretend I didn’t spend a couple minutes staring at my ceiling in blissful happiness because of what you said. I told you of my plan to hide our relationship (YOU CALLED IT A RELATIONSHIP). And you grabbed my hands and said it was brilliant, that I was bloody brilliant. You also asked me about my blood prejudices. So I told you the truth. They are not mine, they are my fathers. I don’t share the same sentiment and I very much wish to unlearn what my father attempted to teach me. You kissed me after I said that, and told me how proud you were of me. I almost passed out on top of you. Harry I don’t think I’ve ever been this happy in my entire life. Yes, many things have brought me happiness. But nothing feels the same as when I am with you. I know we have been together for only a matter of days. So what could I possibly know about relationships? I will admit although I do not know much, I know that you make me so happy I could cry. And maybe I did cry a little when you called me your boyfriend. So what if we’re a secret. You’re my precious secret to keep. At least until the war is over.
I hope you’re having a dreadful summer. Mine has been incredibly boring. I’ve been sending letters back and forth with Luna over the summer, and honestly she’s much nicer to talk to than you. I mean you don’t even write back. To be fair I haven’t sent any of my letters, but I’m sure even if I did send them you still wouldn’t reply. We hate each other, as you are well aware. So there is no reason for us to talk to each other outside of our extreme hatred induced battles. It’s not like I’m actually talking to you right now. I’m basically talking to myself but pretending to talk to you if that makes any sort of sense. Not that I care if it makes sense to you. In fact I hope this letter properly confuses you beyond belief and you can make no sense of it whatsoever. I hope you’re so bloody confused you miss the train and end up getting run over by a muggle car on the way back to your aunt and uncle's house. Anyway, I’ve been so bored this summer that I have no other options but to write to you, as has become tradition. My father seems to be on the edge lately. More so than usual. And he and my mother are always whispering about something or other. Oh, and didn’t you hear? Sirius Black broke out of Azkaban! That’s bloody brilliant if you ask me. Although my mother doesn’t seem to think so. She’s related to him you see. Not that you care, but she has been very troubled by his escape. Can’t imagine why. Well I suppose I should stop writing now as it is time for tea. Goodbye Potter.
Draco drew in a breath and took out a small knife. He slashed his palm quickly and held it to the house like she had said. Something in his chest pulled. Was that a sign it had worked?
“Yes.” Draco replied, trying not to let the guilt creep into his voice. He ignored the painful twisting of his stomach. Right now was a moment for celebration, not sorrow.
“Guys!” He called, his voice high and panicked. Normally he would’ve tried to be the calm one in this situation, but the fact that Hermione was bleeding out on the couch and he had no idea how to help her was scaring the shite out of him.
“Thanks for the room.” he said awkwardly, standing by the door. Tom nodded at him, pinching his brows together.
“No! Stay there.” Luna shook her head frantically and grabbed her hand. “You can’t move, you’ll start bleeding again.”
“I assumed so.” She bit her lip and gave a long sigh. “Can we go somewhere else? I want to tell you everything, but not here. It’s too depressing.” He tried not to feel too insulted. The corner of her mouth quirked up. “No offense.”
“Is it though? He’s really back, I know he is. And-and what’s going to happen Draco?” Her voice shook as she spoke. “We’re not learning anything about how to defend ourselves, I’m scared.”
“Good job Hermione.” Luna said softly, playing with a strand of her hair. “But why didn’t you wait for us to get up?” Draco turned to look at Hermione. He wanted to know the same thing. She had scared them all to death for Merlin’s sake.
“I don’t know, I don’t know! I was talking to Ginevra and she told me all about it. Apparently her brother and his friends from Gryinffdor are very upset about it.” Luna shook her head furiously. “I don’t understand why they would do such a thing! It’s not like Buckbeak did anything wrong.” A tear fell from her lashes.
“So…” Harry started, rubbing at the back of his neck. Draco turned his head to watch the raindrops race down the window.
“Oh, er...are you hurt?” Funnily enough, Potter’s voice brought him back to reality. His thoughts trickled down to a small stream and his vision grew less fuzzy.
“It’s Hermione, she went out again and came back. She’s hurt, really hurt, and I don’t know what to do-”
“Go.” This time he pushed Draco away from whatever was happening. People were still screaming and duels had broken out everywhere.
“I have a question.” Harry said finally, after they had stopped laughing. Draco nodded, although his heart was already squeezing with worry.
Harry stood there. With his box of letters in his hands. His box, filled with letters from over six years, was in Harry Potter’s hands. Except the letters weren’t in the box anymore. They were strewn all over the floor and the couch. Harry was staring at him, eyes wide and mouth parted.
Neither of them said a word. Draco and Harry continued to stare at each other, the silence stretching painfully. Ginny’s smile fell into a frown as she surveyed the scene.
“Dumbledore, Snape murdered him.” His voice was flat as he rubbed a hand against his nose. “He’s dead.” He repeated. Hermione had gone rigid.
(This letter is going to be considerably long so I decided to split it into paragraphs. Not that it matters since you shall never read this. I like things to be organized, alright?) The World Cup was fairly boring. Quidditch is...somewhat mediocre in my opinion. I know I play for my bloody team but honestly I have no motivation to keep doing so. As most things in my life are, it was my fathers idea. That’s not what I was going to talk about though. What I meant to say is quite terrifying. I think I finally know what my parents have been hiding from me. You and your little circle seemed to think my father is a current Death Eater. And I believe you are correct. I knew he used to be one, but he always told me he was under the imperius. So I guess he lied. I should have known, I know. My father lies about quite a lot of things. I need to apologize Potter. I was freaking the fuck out to put it plainly when you and your friends came running out of nowhere. I made some off hand comment about Granger. I don’t even really know what I said. Just that it must have been bad. I used that filthy word again. My fathers likes it when I do. But it makes me feel disgusting and rotting inside. By any means, I’m sorry nonetheless. I may not like Granger, yet I do not wish her any harm. I want you to know that I regret what I said. Even though it is highly likely you will never know my apologies for the things I say, I like to believe that you are actually reading these letters. It helps me sleep at night.
“Legilimens.” He was immediately flung into Harry’s mind and memories zoomed past. Damn. His mind was the furthest thing from clear. Then he felt himself come up on a wall. And the memories stopped. He was pushed back into the presence and he immediately grinned.
“I would wake up covered in blood. I was always terrified it was my own, after I was so paranoid I had killed someone.” Her voice was calm, yet her eyes held a faraway look that made Draco repress a shudder.
“Yeah...I’m doing alright.” He shrugged and made to leave the room, but Severus laid a hand on his arm, stopping him.
Luna crossed her arms and rolled her eyes. “Okay, whatever. I think wrackspurts are crowding your brain at the moment. Go clear your mind.”
Harry said something he didn’t catch, then turned away and ran up the stairs. Ginny inhaled sharply and fell back onto the couch. She landed on top of some letters and grabbed them, then flung them out from under her. Draco sat on an armchair, feeling hollow inside all of a sudden.
“Er-er, be-because it has a picture of you.” He said in a gush. Immediately both Potter and Draco flushed a bright red. That wasn’t even true, Potter didn’t have his picture in this issue. His picture had been in the last one.
“What are you doing?” He asked sharply. Draco didn’t reply. He was too busy scanning Harry to make sure he was unhurt. At least visibly. There was a bruise on his face, and he was rather dirty, but other than that he seemed unharmed. Draco blew out a breath.
“Where were you?” Luna asked softly, she sat on Ginny’s leg and ran a finger along her calf. Draco bit back the jealousy rising in his throat.
“What are you doing?” You asked, shaking your head wildly back and forth. I woke up after that. I hate myself. I thought I said we were going to move on. Why do I keep forcing myself to relieve these moments? I don’t want to remember. Actually moving on now, my apologies. I have a better plan now. Last night my owl, Ulysses, flew into the room I’m staying in. I sent a letter with him, one addressed to Hermione Granger. I know how incredibly risky it is to send letters nowadays, but he’s the smartest owl out there. He knows to keep to the skies until he gets there. I asked Hermione if she could give me some clues to the Order location, or hell, just somewhere we can meet up. So that I can tell her everything and we can formulate some kind of plan to break you out. This has to work. It is going to work. While I wait for her response I’m going to be staying in Muggle London. Some absurd part of me is rather excited. Father never let me go to Muggle London. Said it was dirty. Obviously now I know that’s not true, he was being stupid and closed minded as usual. Yet this small act of defiance he will never witness has my heart pounding. I can’t wait to go walk the streets and shite Potter, maybe I’ll even eat in one of those cafes. Oops. I’ve been writing for nearly half an hour. I meant to leave 15 minutes ago. Damn. I better be off now then. I wish you all the best.
He didn’t know what to do now. Everything seemed so fucking hopeless. Draco must have fallen asleep because the next thing he knew was Severus shaking him softly.
Draco felt his stomach tighten. He wanted to go back to a few minutes ago when he had been about to kiss Potter. He did not want to go inside the castle where there would be responsibilities and consequences and dark lord shite.
“Yes my lord?” he asked. He clenched his hands into fists to stop himself from making a beeline out of the room.
A couple weeks later the best and worst thing happened to Draco. He ended up in a screaming match with Potter. That wasn’t the best part, although it always made Draco’s blood sing to be
“Today you will be practicing the summoning charm.” Flitwick said brightly. Everyone in the class nodded and began muttering among themselves. Flitwick began the lesson and Draco did his best to pay attention. He was doing an okay job of it too until he felt a hand come to rest on his leg. Harry’s hand. On his leg. It took a lot of self control not to turn and kiss him right there in front of everyone. Should he do the same? It wouldn’t be weird, right? Potter’s hand was on his leg after all. Every part of him was warm and a sleepy, happy filling had begun filling his head. He tried to shake himself a little to try and bring himself back to reality. Very slowly he placed his hand on top of Potter’s thigh. Potter stiffened and then relaxed under his touch. His heart began pounding harder. He was so happy, even though he knew this wasn’t something that was supposed to make him happy. They were mortal enemies. But right now...they were something else. All too soon they had to move apart as they began to practice the spell. Draco noticed quickly that Potter was doing it wrong. Without thinking he placed a hand on Potter’s arm and traced it in the proper movement. He was warm to touch and Draco heard him draw in a sharp breath as he grabbed his arm as gently as he could.
“You mean to tell me that you couldn’t wait for one of us before leaving?” Ginny stormed back into the room and pushed a glass of water into Luna’s hands. She placed her hands on her hips and glared at Hermione angrily. “Look what happened to you! Why are you doing this to us Hermione? Why are you doing this to yourself?” Furious tears were welling in her eyes as she gestured at Hermione.
A few days later Draco was actually considering going to the hospital wing. There was this constant knot in his stomach whenever Potter was around, which was fairly often. And now there was this fluttering feeling that appeared when Potter would talk. He had noticed it whenever he would pass Potter in the hall and he would be talking to his friends, the fluttering feeling would start in his stomach and then make its way up his throat. He must have some sort of Harry Potter illness or something.
I have to inform you of something extremely important. It seems I have developed some sort of liking for you. Now I have no idea how, or why this has happened to me. But it changes nothing. I can like you and hate you at the same time, trust me. I’m Draco Malfoy after all, if anyone can like and hate someone at the same time I can. Well that was all I had to tell you. I hate you and like you. Lucky me.
“I know, but I’m fine really. How are you-” And Ginevra, he had been about to say. But then Harry walked in, head whipping around and Draco realized with a jolt he was probably looking for him. He stood and nearly knocked Luna over in the process. She whipped her head around to see Harry standing there, staring at Draco with a small smile on his face, his cheeks red.
“No, Draco. You are a Malfoy, you cannot be friends with Harry Potter. You’re too young to understand but promise me you will not befriend him.”
“Yeah, yeah I know.” Draco sighed. It wasn’t until a few days later that Draco began reading the books. One particular one caught his interest. A Guide to Gender and Sexuality Terms (what you should know). It wasn’t until page 136 of this book that it hit Draco. He was gay. And he, Dear Merlin. He liked Potter. No. No, that couldn’t possibly be what this feeling was. Sure he was gay, but he didn’t like Potter and his really nice hair, and eyes, and...Well fuck.
It was that same day Draco discovered Harry. It was much easier than he had thought it would be. The house had gone quiet and his mother had come to tell him that they were going to a Muggle village to investigate something or other, she had pressed a brief kiss to his hair before shutting his door with a quiet click. The second he sensed everyone had left he flung open every single door he could think of. He went quiet as he heard a quiet rattling from the dungeons. Damn he was stupid. Of course they would keep him in the dungeons. All of a sudden feeling much less sure of himself he crept down the cool stairs, wand aloft.
“Of course.” She put her hand in his and together they walked onto the dance floor. The rest of the night was nice. Until Luna left to go dance with Ginny. That wasn’t what made the night turn sour. In fact the two of them were adorable, giggling on the dance floor. Things really started to go wrong when Weasley came out of nowhere and yanked Draco behind a pillar.
“He’s-he’s dead.” Luna choked out. “Cedric is dead, look.” A few tears leaked from her eyes and ran down her face. She raised a shaking hand to point to where the two figures were lying. People had begun to surround them, Cedric’s father had run over to where they were, screaming. Diggory’s lifeless body lay there as everyone screamed. A stone seemed to fall to the pit of Draco’s stomach. What was going on? How had Diggory died?
First I’ll blab to Severus about how I can’t kill Dumbledore, but inform him that other Death Eaters will soon be on their way. After I tell him this I shall send a message to the Death Eaters to come through the wardrobe and into the castle that way the dark lord believes I’m still on his side and doesn’t decide to spotaneoulsly murder my mother. Then I’m going to give Granger a signal and she’s going to run and inform Dumbledore about Severus’s intentions. Although she continues to tell me that Severus has to be on our side I am not so inclined to believe her. This would be one incredibly elaborate scheme for him to be playing. Ah, it hurts my head to think about it. Okay moving on, Granger will inform Dumbledore and he will presumably lock them in the room of requirement. You see this is where the plan gets the tiniest bit fuzzy because the two of us are going to have to work extremely fast. Then he is going to call in the aurors and send them all to Azkaban. (Yay, no more Aunt Bellatrix) And that’s the plan. I guess. I am well aware there are a plethora of mishappenings that could occur on the evening of our oh so great plan, however I no longer care. Because now there is a chance that I might make it till next year. And oh! The best part of the plan is that afterwards Granger said I could come home with Severus. Since she continues to believe that he is not actually working against us, we shall see. I hope he isn’t a completely terrible person so that I may no longer have to go home and face the wrath of the dark lord. This does mean I will have to figure a way to get my mother safe though but do not worry. I’m sure we can all think of something. Well I have to go meet Luna. Granger said I should tell her about the plan in case something goes horribly horribly wrong.
“Wait, they're going to kill Buckbeak?” Draco said, astounded. “Why on earth would they do that? And who’s going to kill him?”
“Wait by the door. Don’t make a sound.” Severus said in a quiet voice before pulling Draco aside. In a voice so low Draco almost could not hear he said,
“Yeah, and I somehow managed to get this memory from Slughorn as well.” Harry shook his head. Harry had told Draco some about what Dumbledore was showing him in their private lessons, but not much. And Draco hadn’t pushed, he had many secrets of his own after all, he wasn’t going to try and force Harry to share his own with him.
“Oh, I’m very sorry.” she said, looking at the armor on the floor, sadly. She glanced at Draco and studied his face. “Something is troubling you.” She observed.
Luna’s eyes filled with tears of worry. “What if someone broke in? That’s not...not possible right? We put up wards…”
“I can’t tell you everything anymore Luna.” He said softly, trying to say it as gently as possible. She sighed and suddenly she no longer looked 15.
Draco shook his head no. “But I can’t imagine it will be too difficult, at least now we know what we have to do.”
“Yes. I have to do something, you can’t stop me.” Both of them knew very well that was not true. Draco had never worked well under pressure or spontaneously.
Everything. Anything. He could not go in there and sit next to Potter. Yes he would very much like to, however he was a death eater. And it was dangerous to be anywhere near Potter now.
“Come on Draco, it’ll be a good way to get all of our minds off the shite of the past few months.” Pansy said with a grin.
“Yes.” Granger’s eyes grew wide, and slightly panicked. Draco drew his wand when a disheveled Cedric Diggory and another 6th year boy tumbled out from behind the wall. Draco relaxed slightly then stiffened. Cedric liked guys too?
Ginny murmured something into her hands that sounded like I don’t wanna know. Draco swallowed, he wasn’t sure he wanted to know either.
“Did I just see what I thought I saw?” she asked, shaking her head back and forth. Harry cleared his throat but said nothing. There wasn’t really anything they could say at this point. She had seen them- Draco felt light headed all of a sudden. She had seen them holding each other close and smiling, like lovers. Except that wasn’t what they were. At least not right now because she had interrupted them.
“Yes, father?” Draco asked cautiously, eyeing his father suspiciously as he sat down on Draco’s bed.
When they approached the gate Severus looked angrily between the three of them. Uh oh. Draco knew he was going to get another lecture about this sometime soon.
Hey guys! I did not edit this chapter so...But I wanted to get this out before I go on vacation. Hopefully I will get a chance to update while I'm away but if not the next chapter will come out in around 3 weeks. But hopefully less. Anyway I hope you like this chapter because I had way to much fun writing it.
“Get in here.” Snape motioned quickly and Draco did his best to ignore his instincts to run in the other direction. They had already had this conversation. Was there really a need to have it again? Cautiously he entered the office and glanced around. He let out a small sound. Harry was here too, arms crossed and staring at the ceiling. When he saw Draco he stood, chair nearly falling over in the process.
“Good Morning.” he replied, giving the back of his neck a small squeeze. He was sore all over. Sleeping on the couch really had been a terrible idea.
“Draco you can open your eyes.” Ginny laughed. “It’s safe.” Draco felt himself flush bright red. Oh. He opened his eyes uncertainly and stared at the two of them. Luna was sitting on the counter, her ankles crossed. And Ginny was sitting behind her, chin resting on her shoulder.
Theo let out a small gasp and Pansy turned pale. They looked horrified. Draco shared in the sentiment.
We have not met yet, but I am sure once we do we will be the best of friends. Mother was telling me how we are in the same year, and I will be seeing you soon. Tomorrow we’re going to Diagon Alley to buy all of my school things and I just have this feeling that you are going to be there too. I bet we’ll go get ice creams together and look at the new brooms. You do like Quidditch, right? It’s the most brilliant sport there is. Anyway, I cannot wait to meet you soon. Tomorrow or in a few weeks it’s going to be incredible. Well, I guess this is bye for now. Even though you’re never going to read this.
“Have you ever been to London?” Hermione asked, giving him a glance as they strode down the busy street. “Muggle I mean.”
“I’m sorry.” Ginny said, she was surveying his face, hands resting comfortably on her stomach. Draco shrugged, not really wanting to talk about this anymore.
“Draco, what are you doing on the floor?” he asked quietly. Draco jolted away and grasped Severus by the shoulders.
Draco couldn’t say anything. There was a lump so big in his throat he feared it would always be there. He just shook his head and held her.
“Okay, towels.” He turned and went to go get Luna. He felt like he was going to be sick. What if she died? No. No she wasn’t going to die. Draco would not allow that. He knocked on the door where Luna and Ginny had gone to sleep.
“Hey guys, what’s going on?” Potter came over, blushing furiously. As soon as he saw Potter’s bright red face he could feel his own face begin to flush.
The rest of the story came tumbling from his lips after. Every last bit of it. He knew he was putting her in danger by telling her nearly everything. But once he began talking he couldn’t stop. The words were flowing out of him, he hadn’t realized how desperately he needed to talk about this.
“Er, do you think we could just do this in secret?” Potter asked hesitantly. Draco felt his heart drop a little but he knew it was a good thing Harry had asked that. (He was going to call Potter Harry now and no one could stop him) After all who knew what the dark lord would do if he got word of his death eater and Harry Potter kissing in the middle of the great hall.
Snape was silent for a moment, he had turned away and was studying the wall, hands clasped together behind his back.
Kiss him. Theo kissed him. Draco stood there stiffly for one horrified second before he pulled away, blushing furiously. What was he going to say? Oh shit. Theo looked terrified and he needed to say something before things got worse.
“Yeah, I’ll come inside in a second.” he replied, too tired to be embarrassed by the roughness in his voice.
Draco nearly spit out his coffee and proceeded to spend the next two minutes choking on it. “How-how-” he sputtered.
“There’s someone else.” he gasped a little, aghast to feel tears coming against his eyes. Theo’s face fell, and Draco’s heart sank.
He swallowed. “I’m not mad at you Luna.” He was a bit angry, sure, but not at her. He was annoyed that she had left him for Ginevra and Potter, but he could understand.
“Good. That way you’re out of danger and you can help us. Anything else you have to tell me? Anything that could help us?” She folded her hands together and leaned forward once more, her eyes now shining not with tears, but with anticipation.
“Don’t lie to me.” That was enough for Draco to turn and leave the room. He practically broke into a sprint as he flung the door open, and ran down the corridor. Some part of him expected Severus to come chasing after him and curse him. Then force him to listen to everything he had to say. What Severus didn’t understand was that they no longer wanted the same thing. Draco wanted to be free of this burden, to live a normal life with Harry. He wasn’t going to kill Dumbledore if he could help it.
“We already know the truth! Harry Potter is a liar and Cedric Diggory is dead from a misunderstanding!”
“Why of course! I knew your grandfather after all!” Slughorn seemed to always speak in a disgustingly happy tone.
Draco opened his mouth to protest, but then closed it. What his father didn’t know wouldn’t hurt him.
Harry pulled away gently and said in a rough voice, “You're beautiful.” ARGHHHHHHHHH. Draco couldn’t do anything except smile and kiss him again.
“We’ll apparate out if necessary.” Harry said in a low voice. Draco shivered. He could feel his warm breath on his ear.
Pansy sighed one of those extra dramatic sighs. “Yes, yes you better.” Draco gave her a small smile before dragging himself up and going out into the corridor. It was terribly boring walking back and forth down the corridors, waiting to catch someone so he could take points and perhaps feel a little bit better. He thought about what Pansy had said. She thought Theo had a crush on him! The very idea was preposterous. Of course Theo didn’t like him. She had to have been mistaken. Although she somehow had guessed that he fancied Potter, no idea how she had done that. He had done his best to pretend he hated Potter after all. Not pretend. He did hate Potter. He just happened to also have a small crush on him. Draco groaned and lay his head against the cool stone wall. This was ridiculous. Was his patrol over yet? It felt like he had been walking out here for hours.
Potter had officially ruined Draco’s Christmas. And he wasn’t even at Hogwarts. Draco had chosen to stay at Hogwarts due to his father’s very annoyed letter about his terrible grades. Which were not actually terrible just still behind Granger’s, as they had always been. And beg Severus to tutor him. Even though he knew he didn’t actually need it. Merlin knew if he could stop staring at Potter during class he might be able to pull ahead. But he no longer knew how to keep his eyes off of Potter. Even when he wasn’t looking at him he was constantly in his head. Which was absolutely awful. Draco drew in a frustrated breath and flopped over a chair.
“I-Yeah, alright.” Maybe if he was lucky he wouldn’t get sent to Azkaban. But perhaps he deserved it for causing this mess.
“You’re crying.” she repeated, her mouth open slightly as she looked from him to Harry and Weasley retreating down the corridor.
“Sorry, it’s not you I’m mad at.” She took a long breath and stood up. “Come on, let’s go.” She placed a wad of bills on the table and jerked her chin towards the door.
I am fucking terrified. Not for myself. Actually a little bit for myself but mostly for you. I watched as your name came out of the Goblet of Fire right after Cedric Diggory’s. I watched as you got picked as a champion for the next Triwizard Tournament. You're going to die Potter. You're actually going to finally die. You must have a death sentence written somewhere. You have the worst luck of anyone I have ever met. You got picked to be in a tournament for adults. Potter you’re only 14. No offense but how the bloody hell are you going to compare to them? Well you have gotten yourself out of numerous tight spots over the years. So I suppose you’ll have to squeeze yourself out of this one as well. I don’t know what’s going on but I think I do know one thing. My father has returned in service to the Dark Lord. I have no idea what this means for me, or my mother. I don’t understand why we can’t just be a normal family. Sometimes I wish we were muggles so we wouldn’t have to deal with any of this absolute shite. Don’t tell anyone I said that. If my father ever heard he would skin me alive. This is getting me nowhere. I’m still stressed.
Draco gritted his teeth and brushed past them. If he wasn’t scared out of his wits, he would’ve stomped up the stairs like a child. Once he got up the stairs he realized now was the time to bring the wards down. He raised his wand, closed his eyes, and let the feeling of magic rushing around him overtake him. He felt a tingle pass through him, and he knew anyone else in the house would feel the same.
You truly are insufferable. I still hate you. But a part of me wants to be you. Everyone loves you. I don’t, obviously. But you’re...something I suppose. I guess Gryffindor is a good fit for you. You’re always playing the hero and you clearly won’t back down from a challenge. I don’t even know why I’m still writing to you. We’re enemies and I am going to hate you until the day I die. But you can admire your enemies, right? You can admire them and steal all of their skills and use them against them and ultimately that will be their demise. And how bloody satisfying will that be to be the one who bests Harry Potter by watching him closely? Nothing’s changed. So have a terrible day and an even worse life.
“Yeah, yeah of course. That sounds good.” He tried to smile, except his mouth ended up turning down instead of up. She frowned but made no comment of it.
“Sounds like Harry. It was his idea wasn’t it?” She wasn’t looking at him, instead she was studying the couple a few booths away. They were holding hands, and after a brief moment of staring intently at each other, they began making out. Draco felt a pang and swallowed, trying to ignore the pain in his chest.
“Right…” Potter glanced at him and smiled uncertainly at him. Draco felt himself turn even redder, if that was somehow possible. He smiled back, feeling his mouth twitch upward uncontrollably.
“Draco?” his godfather’s voice asked. Draco started. He had fallen asleep draped over this chair. He opened his eyes, blinking the sleepiness out of them.
“I can defend myself best.” She said smoothly, brushing lightly at her sleeves. However the rising blush on her cheeks didn’t escape his notice.
“We ought to set a good example for Durmstrang and Beuaxbotons.” He nodded at the class enthusiastically.
He was considering giving up and going back to have some dinner when Dumbledore, the minister of magic, and another ministry official walked down to Hagrid’s hut. None of them noticed him, as he was sitting behind a large rock to avoid being seen by anyone. He inhaled sharply, realizing that the three Gryffindors were still inside Hagrid’s hut. Right as they entered, the three of them tumbled out the other side of Hagrid’s hut and ran up the hill right to where Draco was. Draco stiffened and prayed that none of them would see him, but to his utter horror they stopped as they reached the top of the hill, and turned. They stared at each other in shock. He immediately felt himself flush as he stared at Potter. He scrambled to his feet.
“I’ve got it under control.” he snapped, temper flaring. Could he get away with just leaving the room?
This summer has been the worst of my 15 years. My birthday was a few days ago and my father wasn’t even around. My mother and I sat quietly in the dining room and had a conversation about the dark lord. Sure brought down the mood quite a bit. She told me the responsibilities my father now held, and that he wouldn’t be around much anymore. I easily could’ve imagined it, but I thought she seemed rather angry during the majority of our conversation. Not that I blame her. I’m quite angry with my father as well. I don’t understand why he had to return to the service of the dark lord. Our lives certainly would’ve been much better if we no longer had to associate with him. Perhaps if the dark lord had never rose to power in the first place, you and I could’ve been friends. We could’ve been friends and eventually maybe more. I’m well aware I’m a lovestruck idiot, I can’t even focus on the dark lord for Merlin’s sake. Somehow my mind always seems to wander back to you. To be honest you’re the only thing that’s been keeping me sane most days. You’re not even here but it’s comforting knowing that once we go back to school we can argue once more. While we’re apart it’s nice to imagine that when we see each other we will greet each other with an embrace and then a kiss. I know it’s far more likely you or one of your friends will punch me in the face, but I like to dream. I should probably go. I’ve been in my room for several hours now hiding from my father. I guess I’ll see or write to you later Potter.
“What happens when young people reach...reach a certain age.” Snape took a very long, very deep breath and continued. “You see now that you’ve reached this age you need to know about…” He was drawing this out so long Draco was growing frustrated.
“No, no no no. Snape was-he was supposed to be-shite. We need to find Mcgonagall he’s going to let the Death Eaters in, Draco.” She made to face him, even though he could not see her expression clearly in the dim light he could tell that she was bloody terrified.
“Severus. I don’t know if he’s on your-our side.” He corrected himself before continuing. Hermione nodded approvingly, a small smile on her face now. “He’s been acting oddly though, when he’s around me. And I don’t know what to think. There’s no way of knowing now I guess, so it’s not like it matters much.” He shrugged, doing his best to keep his voice at a neutral tone.
“Muggle London is huge, how the bloody hell is that supposed to help us!” Someone in the crowd yelled.
“No, no I don’t think so.” he said stiffly, doing his best not to give anything away. Luna gave him a suspicious look but the champions began entering the room and the other students were herded to the sides. Draco did his best to breathe properly as he watched Potter walk with Patil. Luna looked equally flustered beside him. She was gazing at Ginny who was directly across from them. When the music began Draco realized something. Potter was an absolutely terrible dancer. It was shockingly embarrassing just how terrible he was at dancing. Had he even practiced at all?
“What were you doing wandering around the castle this evening?” He immediately began, narrowing his eyes on Draco.
“It’s Diggory!” Theo said, his eyes wide in terror. “And-and Potter.” Draco craned his neck in alarm, doing his best to see what was going on in all of the chaos.
He winced, waiting for someone to come running. The house stayed eerily quiet. This was fucking creepy. After no one attacked him, he flung himself down the stairs to the dungeons. All the thoughts seemed to flow out of his brain. Only a name was wrapping itself around Draco again and again. It was pitch black down there.
Draco was moping about the Slytherin common room late at night when Snape came into the room. No one else was around so Draco straightened up eagerly. He’d always quite liked his godfather, a bit more than his real father if he was being truthful.
After a few very long and boring weeks Draco’s father barged into his room with a scarily excited expression on his face. Draco couldn’t remember the last time he had seen his father this excited. Or excited at all really. It was very concerning.
“I don’t know. Luna must be rubbing off on me. Fuck I miss her.” Ginny set down her mug with a clack and sighed dramatically.
I’m going to leave my house today. I’ve been thinking furiously about when was the best time to make a break for it and I couldn’t see how one was better than the other. I’m usually alone most days. The dark lord has seemed to lose all interest in me. Actually I think he forgot I even existed. My father has returned, you see, and now he can punish him instead. I’ve had to go to a few meetings, the mark burns like mad whenever he summons us, but that’s all mostly. I’ve had some of the house elves bring you extra food, as I assume they’re not feeding you enough. I’m extremely grateful you haven’t been murdered yet, though I do not understand what is the point in holding you hostage. The dark lord has droned on for so very long about finally killing you, I would’ve thought he would’ve done it the first chance he got. Clearly I was wrong. Don’t tell anyone I said this but I don’t think the dark lord is quite as smart as he leads others on to believe. He’s a bit full of himself really. More than a bit actually. Sorry, off topic, again. Point is I’m leaving, and I’m going to find the Order. Don’t know how. I have no idea where their headquarters would be, as you never told me. Which makes sense, I would’ve put all of them in danger most likely. So I am going to leave my house and wander around for a while, whilst praying I do not get caught. I hope you know that I would take you with me if I could open the cell door. But I tried, multiple times, and it came to no fruition. The dark lord clearly placed heavy charms on the door, that I have no way of opening. So the only thing to do is find someone who can. I have only seen Severus once, and he barely even looked at me. I don’t know what to think about him anymore. At first it was oh so easy to believe he was a death eater like the rest of them, but now I’m not so sure. I don’t think he wanted to go through with it, even if it had been his plan all along. Just the way he looked, afterwards. Something about it wasn’t very Severus-like. Doesn’t matter much now though. I’ll be gone without a trace soon enough. I best be going, I want to get a good head start so that no one catches me. Well, bye then Potter. I will do my damn best to save you. Please do not die while I am gone.
“Draco! Brilliant, the dark lord will be pleased.” She made a hissing noise in the back of her throat and made to embrace him. Draco resisted the impulse to flinch as she flung her arms around him and squeezed tightly.
“Yes you! You’re acting like you don’t have any other friends. You still have us, and we all liked Luna Draco. She was really kind. I'm sure she’ll be back. And Potter isn’t the only boy out there you know, Theo, well I think he likes you.” She shook her head at him. “Just stop acting all moody, alright? You’re a terror when you’re this way.” Draco’s heart stuttered.
“Hermione Granger.” It sounded like Hermione, however Draco knew enough now about what went on during war to know about impersonations.
She opened and closed her mouth a couple seconds before responding. “Don’t listen to Ron, he’s just being stupid.” She huffed an angry breath. “As usual.”
“Fine, I’m fine. I have to go.” He shook himself out of Severus’s grip and ran to see Luna. He burst into the hospital wing and nearly knocked Ginevra over in the process.
Ron and Hermione never had a wedding because they eloped only weeks after Harry and Draco’s. Molly was pretty pissed about that, but she soon got over it when she learned Hermione was pregnant.
“True, I think we’re one step closer to defeating Voldemort now.” Draco flinched at the name. He couldn’t understand how Harry could use it so carelessly, especially considering everything. Then he straightened a little.
“Oh, yes I believe he told me that.” Draco wasn’t paying much attention to the conversation, Harry was nowhere to be seen. How odd.
Draco set the letter down gently, then wiped at his eyes with one hand. That certainly had not been what he was expecting when he had received a letter from Granger. It was still a shock to him that she had chosen him to confide in, rather than Ginny or Harry. She probably didn’t know how rubbish he was at comforting people. He blew out a breath and lay down on the floor. Suddenly, he felt very tired. He heard the distant murmuring of Harry and Ginny speaking, the sound soothed him into a fitful sleep. The last thing he saw before his eyes fell shut was his box of letters. That really shouldn’t be in the open for anyone to see. Draco reached a hand to grab it and hold it safe, however his eyes seemed to be like weights now and he knew nothing more.
Immediately proceeding this he heard the dark lord’s voice once more and his mark hurt so badly he was certain he was going to die. Everyone else ran out of the castle, and he thought he heard screams, though he was in too much pain to really focus on anything else. He considered asking someone to run the sword of Gryffindor through him when the pain suddenly stopped and he scrambled to his feet. Outside he heard people yelling, their voices indistinct. His stomach knotted in worry and he slipped outside, glad to go unnoticed.
“You’re not going to give up, and neither are we. We have the basilisk fangs so now more of us can destroy horcruxes. We only have two left.” Draco’s pain was fading and he struggled to sit up, vision blurry. Hermione had her hands on Harry’s shoulders and she was shaking him, hard.
“Fine.” Draco snapped, turning around and walking down the hall. He knew he shouldn’t be annoyed with Luna. He should be happy that she was getting along with Ginevra. He wanted her to be happy but he had always assumed that he was enough of a friend to make her happy. It was absurd, he knew it. Luna could have as many friends as she wanted. But what if he was no longer the friend she went to for advice? What if she no longer wanted to spend time listening to him drone on about Potter? Stopping suddenly he drew in a sharp breath. There in the train car was Potter, Granger, Weasley, Longbottom, Ginevra, and...Luna. She was laughing at something, and showing Ginevra the Quibbler with a brilliant smile on her face. And Potter was there, laughing along with her. It felt as though he had been punched in the stomach. Without thinking Draco flung open the door. Everyone stopped talking and turned to look at him. Potter blinked, and Luna looked horrified. She opened her mouth as if to say something but Potter said,
“Wh-” He shut his mouth in horror. Luna let out a small scream and covered her hands with her eyes. Hooded figures were flying together in the hundreds to the quidditch field. It was the most terrifying thing he had ever seen. Their black cloaks flapped in the wind as they eagerly swarmed towards the stadium. Students began screaming in terror as the teachers jumped up and began sending silvery spells the dementors way. Luna sobbed and turned her face into Draco’s chest.
“Thanks love.” Ginny winked at her. Draco squeezed his eyes shut and turned his focus back to Hermione.
“You alright?” Hermione asked, brows pinching in concern as she observed Draco’s pinched face. He did his best to smooth out his features and school them into nochancalance.
He snorted softly. “None taken, it smells in here anyway.” He stood and offered her a hand. She took it and together they left the motel.
Ginny and Luna were the first to get married, the both of them only 20 years of age. Molly was apprehensive at first, but after a gorgeous wedding on the beach (with lots of crying mind you) she hugged both of them and gave them a very large pile of sweaters. Draco gave them a seashell bookshelf which the two of them absolutely adored. Harry, Ron, and Hermione gave them a huge tapestry of all of them, arms around each other, with huge smiles on their faces. Ginny burst into tears when she saw it.
“I know, baby. But you have to obliviate me, I need you to be safe.” Draco’s chest ached, he couldn’t speak, he was sure. His throat was filled to the brim with angry tears and it felt like someone was punching him in the stomach over and over and over-
She swallowed and turned to go into the kitchen. “I just thought it would be better to get a head start on things.”
Smiling and blushing a faint pink, Draco set down the letter and picked up the one from Theo. His insides squirmed with worry, he hoped Theo wasn’t writing because something was wrong.
“Your father has displeased the dark lord greatly and-and he needs you to carry out a task for him. To bring-” She broke off, choking on the words. He reached a hand out to comfort her but she stood abruptly. She began pacing the length of his room.
“Wow, that’s brilliant.” he choked out. “I’m really really glad.” His father clapped him on his back and said,
She blinked rapidly and opened and closed her mouth several times before raising her cup to her mouth and taking a long sip.
I think I’m in love with you. I know I’ve said that before but I didn’t actually mean it. I don’t really think I knew what love meant. But after tonight I realized. I realized because I would give anything for you to be happy again. It was as if I could feel everything you were. It hurts me to see you that way Harry. I don’t want you to feel pain. I want to give you the whole world. And fuck, I know that sounds stupid and cheesy and I’m a kid so what do I know about love. I don’t know many things about our insane world. But I do know that Draco Malfoy is hopelessly in love with Harry Potter. And he really hopes that Harry feels the same way.
“Yes.” His voice was hoarse and to Draco’s horror he realized his eyes were glistening. Oh dear. Emotions. Now was when he was going to show emotions? Was he supposed to hug him? What-
“Now, if that’s alright.” She said quietly, not meeting his eyes. Draco guessed he didn’t have much of a choice.
“Er-yeah. He’s come almost every day actually, he doesn’t talk though. It’s kind of creepy.” He shrugged and came to stand next to Draco. He was shaking, his left hand kept twitching oddly.
I think you’ve broken a record for the most detentions you’ve managed to collect in the time since we’ve started school. It’s incredible really. I’ve been trying to catch you after class (to say what I have no idea) but you’re always in detention. And whenever you’re not in detention, you’re with her. Cho Chang. I can’t tell if you’re in love with her or if you feel sorry for her. I feel terrible. Cedric cheated on her and then died. Although maybe she didn’t know that he cheated on her. Who knows honestly. But still. And no one is helping this poor girl. She cries all the time for goodness sake! Which makes sense. I wasn’t planning on talking about Cho. I don’t know what the purpose of these letters is. My box is starting to get quite full. I don’t know why I can’t bring myself to throw them away. The old ones are of no use to me after all. They’re merely reminders of everything I wanted and desperately hoped for, that will never come to be. Being in love with your worst enemy is terribly painful. I would say I hope you never have to feel this pain, but I hope you feel just like this every time you look at me.
Severus shook his head and interrupted, “Your grades are fine Draco, you don’t have to take extra lessons to bring them up. I highly doubt anyone can pass Granger at this point.”
“Thanks.” She grumbled, taking the mug of coffee from him and dumping what looked like a cup of sugar into it.
“About what?” Draco snapped, not really understanding why he was feeling annoyed. He didn’t say anything for a while and Draco started to wonder if he had left.
“Hide. He wanted you to hide. From what? Oh this is terrible, we have to tell a Professor.” Her face was tight, he had never seen her like this before. It was scaring Draco to pieces.
But he never came out. He never came out and Draco was left there screaming for him to come out. He didn’t know how long he stood there screaming until his throat was raw and he slumped to the ground. What was he going to do? Luna was always the one who comforted him when Harry was missing. And now…
“I only had to wait ten minutes before Professor Snape came out. He didn’t say anything to me, but he knew I was there. He dropped this on the ground for me to read.” She fumbled in her pockets again and drew out a crumpled piece of paper. “Here.” She shoved the paper at Draco, spots of color still high on her cheeks.
“I’m sorry Luna, I can’t talk right now.” he said quickly, turning and practically running back to the dungeons.
Steeling himself he decided the first thing to be done was to go to Borgin and Burkes and pretend to be very interested in some dark sort of items. He managed to escape his mother well enough, but what he hadn’t anticipated was Potter and his two friends following him. He had first seen them in the robe shop, and all three of them had stared at each other for a solid ten seconds before Draco hurried out and left his mother behind.
“WHAT IS THE MEANING OF THIS?” Madam Pince bellowed, coming into view. All three of them immediately stiffened.
“Right.” Draco made to walk away but a strange sound stopped him. A rustling was coming from behind the corridor.
“Er, right. Can you walk?” Draco was finally able to draw a shuddering breath into his lungs and he stood, not looking at either of them.
Umbridge snapped her head in her direction, her eyes wide. “Why would you need to defend yourselves?”
“I love you.” Draco sobbed and grabbed Harry’s hand to keep himself upright. He pressed his lips together as they shook. It wasn’t supposed to be this way. Love shouldn’t have to hurt this terribly.
“Oh, that must’ve been hard for her. I mean the chamber and all.” He replied, fighting the urge to yank his hands away from the sticky blood. He closed his eyes briefly, willing himself to remember that Hermione would’ve done the same for him. At least, he hoped she would.
“Go on, go on. I’ll be just fine here.” She said impatiently, motioning them towards the door. Draco cast her a suspicious glance but she just smiled sweetly.
The next months passed in a blur so fast Draco could hardly believe any time had passed at all. One moment they were reuniting with Hermione, Weasley, and Ginny, and the next they were separated and Draco didn’t see Harry for weeks. In one spectacular moment of glory, Ginny and Draco managed to break into Gringotts and steal a cup from Bellatrix’s vault. Next thing he knew Severus came out of nowhere, shoved a sword into his hands, and left with barely a word. Ginny told him that “the silent bastard” had nearly given her a heart attack. It had taken the pair of them a rather embarrassingly long time to realize what exactly they were supposed to do with the sword.
“It’s going to be alright.” Luna pressed a kiss to her forehead and Draco joined Hermione in the kitchen, pushing the memories of kisses like that to the back of his mind.
“Yes,” he said automatically. This was the right thing to do. And it felt fucking amazing. Merlin knew he had made enough mistakes for a lifetime.
“Oh, alright.” But Draco found himself wanting to tell him. Because who else could he tell? However before he could open his mouth to spill it, Theo made a stifled sound and grabbed his arm. The one with the dark mark.
“Professor Slughorn, I discovered this boy lurking in an upstairs corridor. He claims to have been invited to your party and to have been delayed in setting out. Did you issue him with an invitation?” Draco flushed and tried not to look incredibly guilty. He hadn’t been about to do anything terrible after all. What was the point of him being publicly humiliated? What was he supposed to say to this? He hadn’t said anything of the bloody sort!
Draco had no idea what was wrong with him. There was some sort of knot in his stomach and weird pounding in his chest. Usually he would put his letters in a box, but tonight he couldn’t bring himself too. His heart was going so fast and it was scaring him to be perfectly honest. Was he dying? Oh Merlin, he was probably dying of some sort of ambiguous disease that was caused by your enemies when you hadn’t seen them in a long time. He should go to Madame Pomfrey. What if Potter wasn’t in the mood to fight and this feeling never went away? How was he supposed to focus in class if he was too busy feeling and sick and thinking about Potter-
“...10 points from Gryffindor!” Snape was saying. Draco snapped his gaze upward. Class was nearly over, Snape had just taken his customary points from Gryffindor. Weasley was shaking and red with fury, and Draco expected Potter to look the same but when he turned his gaze back to him, he realized that Potter wasn’t looking at Snape. He was looking at Draco.
“I know, I’m sorry.” She repeated, eyes still closed. Vaguely, Draco heard a door creak open and he realized Luna and Ginny were probably listening to their conversation.
“...a disappointment to the Malfoy name.” his father was saying. Draco realized he had spaced out in his utter horror. “Do you know what it was like to hear that a mudblood of all people had bested my own son?”
“Right, yes. Anyway.” He gripped the coin in his pocket and rubbed it like Hermione had taught him to.
“Marriage.” Harry finally blurted out, turning red as a tomato. Draco took a step back, hand covering his mouth. He felt tears come to his eyes, and his throat got all thick and choked up, but he managed to convey the message that yes. He absolutely adored the idea of marriage if Harry was also willing.
You’re gone and I’m here at Hogwarts for Christmas. I was not about to go home only to find You-Know-Who in my bedroom. Probably not in my bedroom, I mean I sure hope not but who knows where he goes. Anyway the point is, that I’m not about to go face the dark lord once more and have him murder me once he realizes that I have done absolutely nothing. (Not nothing actually but perhaps he’ll get to excited and break into Hogwarts or something, I don’t fucking know.) So now I’m here. Luna stayed, and so did Blaise, but everyone else has left. And Severus is here as well but I’ve barely talked to him. I feel bad for walking out on him, I guess he is trying to help in his own twisted way. I don’t want to believe he’s the bad guy now but isn’t he? You told me that Severus was supposedly a spy for the dark lord, however you didn’t quite buy it. I’m not really sure what to think of him anymore to be perfectly honest. I didn’t want to talk about this when I started this letter. My letters always get so insanely rambly I shouldn’t be surprised this is the direction I headed in. It feels like I can tell you anything. Although not really, because I’m not actually talking to you. I’m talking to myself pretending I’m talking to you. I’m a very complicated person Harry, I’m not sure how you like me. Even though I’m extremely glad that you do.
He couldn’t believe it. Every single part of him was practically humming with excitement. Harry hadn’t mentioned anything about the letter. But after a terribly awkward conversation he had agreed to let Draco go with him to Muggle London. Draco had absolutely no bloody idea what Harry was supposed to be doing in Muggle London, but honestly he didn’t care. Ginny impatiently waved them off.
“Right! And Hermione will be back to celebrate.” Harry grinned, not noticing Draco and Luna a little ways away. Draco’s heart squeezed and released, and felt himself let out the first real breath he had since he’d heard Harry was missing. It was as if he was watching from above as Harry and Weasley walked away, very much alive.
Draco was very miserable. He wanted to kiss Potter again, yes, that was true. But he wanted Potter to look at him and smile. He wanted Potter to be happy with him. He wanted to make Potter happy. He knew he could. He didn’t know how he knew but he did. Draco Malfoy could make Harry Potter happy but every single force in the whole entire universe was pushing them apart.
Draco could not believe that Potter had run away from the duel with him. They had been about to fight, but he had run off with his singing Valentine chasing him. It was unbelievable. Potter had to be aching for a fight as much as he was. They hadn’t fought since the slug incident, and that wasn’t something that Draco cared to remember. Even though it had been months ago now. Draco had forgotten how good it felt to fight with Potter. How it made him feel awake, how his very blood sang whenever Potter was near him. It was unfortunate that they hadn’t gotten a chance to duel.
“Stand back please.” He said in a low voice, raising his wand. Harry narrowed his eyes but did as he said.
“Yes, okay. Harry Potter is-” He broke off, horrified to actually see Harry and Ginny creeping slowly behind the crowd of people. The bloody hell were they doing? They couldn’t find another exit?
“Alright then. Draco.” He stuck out his hand before he could think twice about it. She grinned and huffed a short laugh before shaking his hand.
Draco’s father had always urged him to say the word mudblood instead of muggleborn. It’s their proper name, he had insisted. But Draco had never wanted to say it. He didn’t really know what it meant, yet he still did not want to say it. It shouldn’t matter, he knew that muggleborns blood was dirty. Or something along those lines. He wasn’t sure why it was dirty. That’s what his father had always told him, so he had simply accepted it as fact. Why then did he feel so utterly ashamed at what he had said earlier that day?
“You’re going to kill him?” His voice shook even as he tried to keep it steady. Severus looked pained for a moment so briefly Draco almost didn’t catch it. But it was there nonetheless.
Draco sealed the letters and placed it along with the rest. The box was starting to have quite the collection of letters. He sat for a moment in the quiet of his room wondering why exactly he was actually writing these letters. It simply didn’t make any sense. Why would he spend so much time thinking about Potter, looking forward to when he would be able to write the next letter, when he absolutely loathed-
“Nothing, nothings wrong. It’s just that your father and I aren’t going to be here for a few days and I wanted to make sure you'd be okay staying by yourself.”
Draco pretended his hand wasn’t shaking as he said, “Bombarda.” And the cell door exploded. Wow. Draco hadn’t actually expected this to be so easy.
I’m very tired of thinking about Potter. I don’t want to think about him anymore. I want to move on with my life and find someone else who might appreciate you. Of course it’s my terrible luck that I would develop a soul sucking crush on my worst enemy. But anyway, that’s enough about me and my sorrows. How are you? Have you sent any letters to Ginevra? You should, I bet she likes you an awful lot. Also, I hope you are staying safe. You-Know-Who is back. I’m certain of it. This isn’t a very cheery letter. I wish I had something happy to tell you. How are the wrackspurts doing?
After settling in, he realized that he had nothing to do but wait. And soon after that, he realized that he was much too chicken to go wandering about Muggle London by himself. No matter how much he was excited about the prospect of sitting in a cafe and drinking the strongest cup of coffee possible. But no, that was not in the cards for Draco. He flopped on top of his creaky bed and stared at the ceiling mournfully. He was turning out to be a complete failure at all of this war rubbish. He shut his eyes firmly, and fell into a fitful sleep.
“Thanks for helping me, you’re a much better teacher than Snape ever was.” Draco felt a pang of guilt at that. He never liked going behind Severus’s back.
Ginny continued as if she hadn’t heard him. “But he’s been having these flashbacks and memory blanks lately. I’m not sure the obliviate worked quite as you intended…”
“Uh, me too please.” Draco replied, feeling his face burn. She nodded and scribbled it down quickly, before seemingly skipping off in the other direction. Draco wondered if she was feeling alright.
“And I brought the invisibility cloak and waited outside.” Hermione continued, ignoring Ginny. Well that was sort of smart. At least she hadn’t broken in.
“CATCH HIM!” Draco recognized the voice of Dolores Umbridge as she chased after them, her wand raised, face twisted in fury.
He was only unnoticed for a few seconds, because when he realized Hagrid was holding Harry’s body, an animal-like sound shot out of him and he fell to his knees. He didn’t recognize the sound that was coming out of his mouth. It was painful for his own ears to hear.
“Great.” Draco almost smiled, then realized that was probably a bad idea. “I have to be off, and keep this safe for me please?”
Draco was sitting in the kitchen very early one morning, drinking coffee that Hermione had taught him how to make, when he heard a frantic knock at the door. Immediately he stiffened, and placed his cup of coffee down on the counter. Slowly he drew his wand from his pocket and crept towards the front door.
Footsteps sounded up the stairs and Draco stuffed the letter under his pillow. A knock sounded on his door.
“Don’t worry I’m not going to report you, and neither is Harry. He’s not that senseless, he still cares about you.”
“To Dumbledore.” Draco said simply, making up a rather terrible lie on the spot. To Dumbledore. Yes. That was exactly where they were not going.
The few seconds he had been gone Harry had disappeared and Draco realized where he had gone. Severus said there was nothing they could do now unless they wanted to be dead as well. Following this Draco started screaming and Severus dragged him off back towards the castle, muttering something under his breath. Draco pretended to believe that Harry would come back to him fully alive and well. He explained to Severus that they still needed to kill the snake, as Ginny and Luna had figured out the whole diadem ordeal. Severus nodded seriously and said after the dark lord was dead it would be easy to finish the snake off. At first Draco hadn’t understood what he meant. When the dark lord is dead. It was something completely unimaginable. How exactly was the dark lord going to die? If Harry was going to his death, how was he going to finish the dark lord off in the process?
“You might have the best year at Hogwarts yet.” Draco felt a lump rise in his throat and he quickly did his best to swallow it down.
“I thought you might be dead. I heard-I heard things over the summer, and I worried for you and when you didn’t respond…” She choked off and pushed him weakly. “Why didn’t you respond?”
“Ginny, there’s no use in getting mad at her right now. We have to help her.” Luna ran down the stairs to where Hermione lay on the couch, in a pool of her own blood.
“Shite.” Potter stepped away abruptly and Draco nearly fell over. He was sure he looked exactly like a tomato. Ms. Norris was watching them with her head tilted. Flich must be nearby.
“Are you alright Draco?” came Luna’s breathy voice. Draco paused. He was in the middle of the corridor and there was no one in sight.
“I know! Merlin.” She buried her face in her hands for a moment and moaned. “This was a terrible idea. Maybe we should’ve just gone to Dumbledore in the first place.”
“Wards.” Breathed Draco, staring at the letter in awe. His heart was pounding very fast now, and his mind was racing in excitement. Ginny, who had come to stand at his shoulder to read the letter, frowned.
“Mmmm.” Alecto rolled her eyes and groaned. “The dark lord will not be pleased that this is taking so long. He wanted us to do other business tonight.” Her cold voice cut through the wispy night air smoothly. Other business? Besides killing Dumbledore? Wasn’t that enough for one night?
You have officially driven me to the brink of insanity. Every time I pass by you my heart nearly shoots out of my chest. Even thinking of you makes my stomach swirl. It’s getting ridiculous. I do not understand why I cannot get you out of my head. I did not expect this to stay with me, I thought over the summer it would fade. Clearly, it hasn’t. I was watching you in Potions today (not in a creepy way I swear), and I couldn’t help but notice that you kept pressing a hand to your scar. I was wondering what that was about? Do you think it has something to do with Voldemort? I hope not but I don’t really know anything anymore. I better finish my Potions essay, it’s due in a few hours.
“I don’t.” Draco said, trying to think of a way out of this. “Obviously, not.” Granger was looking from Weasley to Potter and then to him and back again. She seemed worried, her eyes bright and hair a little more frizzy than normal.
“Get in!” Hermione’s voice hissed. Draco took a long breath to try and get his heart rate to return to normal and hurried into the classroom.
He was a traitor, did you know that cissy? Bellatrix’s voice came back to him. Last summer he remembered the hushed (on his mother’s part) conversation, where Regulus came up. He frowned and sat on the edge of the dusty bed, having nothing better to do than to sit there and try to distract himself. He picked up an old picture sitting on the nightstand. In it a young Sirius had his arm thrown around his brother, squeezing him close. Draco blinked. Odd. He wouldn’t have thought the Black brothers would’ve been close.
“Luna?” he asked slowly, not wanting to startle her. He looked around for Madam Pince. She was nowhere in sight.
“No.” he shook his head. Even though this was something he had known might happen for years now, he still did not want to believe it. “No, he can’t be back.” Draco, Pansy, and Theo stared at each other in pure terror. They all knew what this meant. They’re families would soon be recruited once again to the dark lord, if they were not already in service.
“And don’t forget to finish your potions essay.” Snape reminded him, snapping back into his usual self.
I want to make one thing very clear. I couldn’t care less about you. I don’t care if you live if you die. I am sure I can very easily find a new enemy if need be. You don’t mean anything to me at all. We are merely enemies. Enemies who loathe each other. I don’t care about you or your heroic life. I won’t be thinking about you at all this summer. And if I do, it will be to spit at the mention of your name. The very thought of you nauseates me.
“It is I! Severus Snape.” The drawling voice came from the hooded figure and Severus threw back the hood of his cloak to reveal himself. Shite. Was this a good thing?
“Oi! Malfoy!” He had no idea which twin tapped him on the shoulder. Draco tried his best not to panic.
“Right, okay.” He wondered if he could kiss Potter goodbye. Maybe they would never talk to each other again after this so he should just throw everything to the wind and kiss him? So he did. Draco Malfoy kissed Harry Potter and wondered if it was their last.
At the moment he didn’t have it in him to be feeling sorry for Harry. Even though a small part of his brain was telling him that he would end up forgiving him sooner or later.
“I think she was with Ginevra.” Theo said, shrugging. His eyes had brightened at the sight of Draco and Pansy.
“And he assigned me a task, to kill Dumbledore. I couldn’t refuse, I knew he’d go after my mother, so I agreed. Obviously I’m not actually going to kill him.” He reassured her, after her expression had grown more and more panicked. She nodded,
She wasn’t exactly wrong. Draco was still very stupid for getting himself into this situation in the first place.
