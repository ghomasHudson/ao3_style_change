Harry was taken aback by her immediacy and bluntness. He hadn't even finished what he was saying, but Ginny had already crossed her arms.
Draco took another drink of whisky and passed it onto Harry. He didn’t wince as much this time.
“Follow me, Potter.”
Granger softened. “I’m not going to do that, Malfoy. Even if you did deserve it.”
“Oh,” frowned Harry. “I just – you were there when I had to rehash my brilliant upbringing, weren’t you? That day at group? Yeah.”
“I’m still,” Draco paused. He cocked his head, gazing at Leonel and trying to read him. “I don’t know what you want.”
In fact, Harry hadn’t brought it up after Draco had told him the truth. He kept fearing there would be some sort of delayed reaction from Harry that wasn’t so positive. He relaxed only when it became clear Harry was acting just as he had before and he wasn’t treating Draco any differently.
He turned to look over at Draco, who was laying on his side, his head propped up.
Malfoy’s office, as it turned out, was not very far from Harry’s hospital room at all, and its door bore a shiny plaque reading “Healer Draco Malfoy – Head of Strife Feirold Ward.” Malfoy turned around and seemed to check if Harry was indeed behind him. Once he’d spotted him, Malfoy opened his door and let Harry walk past him into the office.
"One of the drugs, cocaine, is more of a 'hard drug.' Some are just more recreational, casual...no one has ever overdosed on them. But these harder ones can be dangerous. And I knew it, but I didn't care. It was part of the thrill. You take it, and suddenly you're more alive. Confident. You're untouchable. But then you keep using more and more and soon your heart is pounding in your ears so loud it's sickening and you wonder if it's ever going to stop or if you'll just die of a heart attack then and there."
“Have you been able to keep your food down?”
“What?”
Draco flinched at this sudden reference to Him and glared over at Potter.
Still, he’d vomited, joked about vomiting, and then Harry had told him he’d died so it really wasn’t the best night.
He turned his head away from Malfoy and opted to look out the window again. Apparently, there was a charm on it so patients could see outside it, but anyone on the other side couldn’t look in. Betty had told him that one morning.
“Draco,” Pansy said sharply, “I just don’t understand. I thought – why are you still doing this? The – the War’s over. It’s almost 1999, for fuck’s sake.”
Draco hated the eighth-year dormitory. The tower had been newly built during the reconstruction of Hogwarts and couldn’t be more different than the dungeons. It was disorienting enough being back at Hogwarts without having to room somewhere new.
But they were best friends for years. That had to count for something, right?
Harry twitched above him.
“This too,” Draco said, and Harry sat up to pull his sweater off, throwing it into some corner of his room.
“You’re talking an awful lot,” Draco said. “Take a deep breath.”
“You have any others?”
Draco watched as Potter processed these words, his jaw working.
“Yes, Healer,” said Leonel monotonically. “Honestly, I’m not a trainee anymore. Can’t you trust me to keep track of these things?”
“Oh God,” he said, and threw up into his bucket.
He smiled.
“Not that I know of,” Ron said, pausing now too to match Harry’s gaze. He was frowning. “I never even thought about it before, honestly. Maybe it just never occurred to the people who made St. Mungo’s however long ago.”
“You’ll see. Come on, Malfoy.”
“Mr. Potter. I’m sorry to interrupt but I just wanted to introduce myself to you as I haven’t gotten a chance yet. I’m Scarlett Mitchell, the Healer-in-Charge of the Potion and Plant Poisoning department.”
“Draco?”
He saw Draco shift out the corner of his eye. Kathy studied the two of them with a knowing eye – Harry was strangely,
“It’s not that bad,” Harry said defensively, squatting down next to Draco. Even now, being this close to Draco made his breath catch.
Draco grimaced; it didn’t feel like they were. “I hope so. He overdosed on a combination of calming potions, sleeping potions, and alcohol.”
“Fine,” he said, and because his mother had instilled manners in him as a child, he asked, “And you?”
“Why weren’t you here this morning, anyway?”
want to?”
“What…what is this?”
Estrada's hand had somehow found its way to one of the edges of Malfoy's robes and was now fingering the cloth covertly. Harry saw rather than heard Malfoy's light gasp.
“Well, as enjoyable as this was, Potter, I've got to finish my paperwork. And you should really try to get some sleep.”
Malfoy was right; this last one didn’t hurt nearly as much as the second one had.
He trailed off, unsure of how to explain it. Betty let go of the braid and it swung away, returning to its place behind her back. She chewed on her bottom lip nervously.
"No I wouldn't," he said defensively, glaring at her.
and he wasted no time in taking Draco into his mouth.
Harry wiped his sweaty palms on his jeans and ran both hands through his already-mussed hair.
“I have to agree with Hermione,” Harry grinned. “Sorry, mate.”
Blaise’s laughter suddenly broke off; he was now staring at Harry with an unsettling intensity. “This ‘someone’ better be who I think it is, because if not, Potter, I’ll personally dismember you and dump your remains in the River Thames.”
Harry could have sworn Malfoy colored slightly, but perhaps it was just the lighting.
Pansy didn’t say anything for a bit. Draco wondered if the others in the room were staring at them. His cheeks burned, but he didn’t move. He just kept staring at Pansy, who stared back. Finally, she spoke in a cool, even voice as she picked up her book.
Draco paled a bit when Harry told him but put on a brave face and nodded, accepting the invitation. Harry knew that he was worried about seeing the rest of Ron’s family, but they wouldn’t have invited him if they didn’t want him there, right?
“Er,” Harry said, uncertain of what he wanted.
“Horcrux?” Draco asked, pausing in his tracing. In all his years of living in the Wizarding world, he had never heard the term.
“Sorry,” Draco said.
The other three smiled and repeated his words, clinking their mugs against Draco’s.
“Bloody disgusting,” Harry mumbled.
It was Ginny again.
“Thanks, love!” Cait pecked Samuel’s cheek before walking off.
“Now go, or you’re going to be late.”
“Draco’s wanting to talk to you,” Ginny explained.
Draco untied the small scroll, but before he could even say something, the owl was gone. Frowning, Draco pulled the window shut and sat down in his armchair. When he’d unrolled the parchment, he had to blink and rub his eyes to make sure he wasn’t seeing things.
“There you go, boy, now get dressed,” said the mirror unnecessarily.
“Er, yeah, that’d be great,” he said quickly, realizing Damien was still waiting for an answer.
Draco’s eyebrows rose. “Wow.”
“Merlin, really? An Old Fashioned?”
– later.”
“The usual, I have a headache, nausea…”
you, Draco,” Pansy hissed.
“It matters cos you can’t even stand up, you git,” Potter ground out. “Now come on. We’re either going to Pomfrey or to get food, so choose one.”
They lingered on the unpleasant memory. Potter, strangely enough, looked just as shaken as Draco felt.
Harry studied Malfoy, thinking about how he was still a complete mystery to him. There was the Malfoy he knew during his early years in Hogwarts, the one he knew at sixteen and seventeen (he’d been more of a real person then), the one he knew immediately after the war, and now – most puzzling yet – the one that attended a Muggle mental illness support group.
“We don’t have anything to chase it with.”
"I'm going to...ignore that and ask that we switch back to the original topic,” Draco said uncomfortably. “I'm rusty when it comes to dating, but so is Potter, so that can either be a good thing or a bad thing."
“Potter, you don't –“ Draco stopped, then started again in a calmer voice. “You're in recovery. Your brain is getting used to almost everything again, and I understand that it is overwhelming, and feelings and thoughts will get jumbled, and there's a good reason recovering addicts are strongly discouraged from starting new relationships.”
“Well, how about we do a little assignment this week? I’d like you to think about the things that make you happy. Whether they are solitary activities, or ones you do with other people, I want you to make a list of them to bring for next time. Is that alright?”
“What – are you alright?”
"Don't remind me," Draco said, flushing with embarrassment. He looked away, momentarily lost in thought. "I don't know what I was thinking; I could have lost my job. And it wasn’t twice a week," he added defensively, glaring at Ira.
They made it to the young witch’s room and stood to the side of the closed door.
Blaise laughed and raised his hands.
“Don’t get me wrong, group helped too. A lot. I’ve made some good friends there, I think, and everyone’s been so nice. But Draco…he understands in a way no one else does. I mean, you obviously do too,” he added quickly, not wanting them to get the wrong idea, “But I just don’t want to keep bothering you-“
“ Draco whispered in a panic.
“Fine,” Harry sighed exaggeratedly but allowed Draco to turn back around so Harry could resume spooning him.
"What?" Ginny asked in a hushed whisper.
“Anyway,” Harry continued, “I think they’ve finally understood that I’m serious about this, and it’s not going to stop anytime soon. So it all worked out.”
“Good, you’re improving splendidly; your vitals are stabilizing. No sign of a fever. We’ll still be monitoring you, of course. I’d like you to stay here until at least this coming Monday. By then, it’ll have been a week since you’ve arrived.”
“Well, maybe build up to it a bit more,” Draco rolled his eyes. “How did you tell Granger and Weasley?”
he’d been feeling the past week. “I feel like…I can’t even keep track of what I’m feeling. One minute I feel like something horrible is going to happen, the next all I can think about is using, and the next I’m just
“Sorry to disappoint,” Harry responded, dropping his watch back on the bedside table and rolling to lie face-to-face with Draco.
“I did,” he answered.
“Morning, Harry,” she said as she took the pastry bag from him. “Come in.”
“I dare you to finish that sentence, Potter,” Draco threatened, his eyes dark. “You don’t have to make excuses for them.”
Draco considered it. He was already feeling the effects of the punch – it was clearly stronger than it tasted. He really wasn’t planning on getting completely sloshed, but then he thought, why not? It’s not like he had classes tomorrow. He’d just be staying in the castle during Christmas, unable to face his mother and the Manor. With his father in prison, his mother was beside herself, a mere ghost of the woman she once was. Draco knew that he wouldn’t help any by showing up looking what he did.
There was something strange in Potter’s expression, in his eyes, in the resolute way he was clenching his jaw. It was vulnerability, Draco realized with surprise. Potter was being vulnerable – willingly – in front of Draco. Weakly, Draco dropped down into the armchair again. Potter’s tense shoulders dropped.
"'S fine, Malfoy."
With that, Weasley nodded gruffly and turned back to reenter Gryffindor tower. Draco watched him go, unsure what to think.
“No, of course not,” Draco scoffed. “But I know – I mean…what about the girl Weasley?”
“Yeah,” Potter said. “I guess.”
Lol something about this story makes my writing 100000x times worse. Probably cause I started it in 2014 and I just revert back to then. SORRY
“Do you have any guesses as to what caused it?” Granger said, saving Weasley from having to speak.
Pansy didn’t seem deterred in the slightest. “It’s a compliment. You should learn how to take one.”
Draco jumped and went to the door. When he opened it, Harry’s hand was raised like he was just about to knock again.
He cleared his throat and his eyes looked impassively around the room, pausing only momentarily on Harry. He suddenly realized he hadn’t heard Malfoy speak in over four years.
me and I hate it. I want to move on but I just keep reliving it instead. I remember all the deaths I caused wherever I go – like every single place in this castle is a reminder of what’s happened and I can’t fucking escape it. But it might not even be that – Hogwarts isn’t what’s wrong - what’s really fucked up is my head, like it’s inside. Like I can’t escape. And I see them all in my dreams too – all the people I killed, and sometimes I can’t even tell what’s real and I just -
“Christ,” Harry half-laughed, running a hand through his hair.
He didn’t mind talking to Malfoy when it wasn't about all the ridiculous bullshit that was going on in his life. It helped in distracting him from – everything. It was clear to Harry how much he’d grown since Harry had known him. There wasn’t much about him that was recognizable from the Malfoy at Hogwarts, and though it was still remarkably strange, Harry had halfway accepted it. Malfoy wasn’t a complete tosser anymore.
“What?”
"Good morning, Mr. Potter," she gave him a small, nervous smile as she carried over the tray of breakfast.
into a glass he’d found on his bedside table and gulped the water down, relishing how it felt against his dry, scratchy throat. The taste of vomit and whiskey still lingered, but it was marginally better.
He had skipped the first match, Gryffindor vs Slytherin, because it was much easier to stay in bed that day.
“No,” Draco said immediately, looking at Potter’s hand with distaste. “I’m fine. I just need…a moment to collect myself.”
“You could just use magic,” Ron commented from where he sat.
“Nah, I’m not gonna bother,” Leo said, and he flopped down into the chair opposite Draco’s. “I’ll just leave a report on your desk by the end of the day. Will you tell me what’s up?”
“I’m fine,” Draco said quickly. “Sorry.”
“Drinks for everyone,” Betty said happily, placing them at the center of the table.
Harry tried to contain his smile by biting his lip. His eyes darted over to Pansy.
, Draco. That’s what I’m saying to you. You don’t look like you’re
“Is this what I think it is?” Draco asked, unable to hide the awe in his voice as he studied the fabric.
Draco sat up and took it. As he brushed himself off, he looked around at the ground.
Potter was sat in front of him, staring at him with green eyes that were shockingly different from Leo's.
Her voice was softer now, and Harry breathed a sigh of relief. He looked up to say something, but as soon as he did so, Hermione straightened up and said firmly, "But Harry Potter, if I ever see you with any drugs at all, I'll march you to Dr. Wolff's office myself."
“Does anyone else experience this?” Kathy asked the group. “Perhaps someone has some coping methods they’d be willing to share.”
“Hello, Cait,” Malfoy said smoothly. He looked over her head, peering into the crowd. “Where are the others?”
Potter was silent. Draco wondered belatedly if this had been a bad idea, but then he remembered that the idiot had
sort of idea that Draco didn’t feel comfortable eating in front of people, especially people who didn’t like them. Macmillan, who sat by Harry, was regarding Draco with haughty distaste, and Draco suddenly realized that he’d been one of the students who’d cursed Draco at the end of fifth year. And then he realized that the blonde girl sat next to him had also been involved in the attack.
Harry released the vice grip on Draco’s thighs and bent forward, closer, and then he was choking Draco.
“Did you think I forgot about what I said I’d do?” Harry asked back. He grinned, and Draco melted. “I wish I wasn’t hungover for it, but that can’t be helped.”
A pick-me-up. That was all.
Draco could already see a few students looking their way, curious to see what Harry Potter and Draco Malfoy could possibly be talking about. He nodded, and the two set off. Once they were far enough away in a deserted corridor, Harry began to speak once more.
“We of course have spells set up to alert us if Potter’s having a seizure,” Malfoy said, mostly to Hermione and Ron. He frowned at them a bit more before turning to Betty. “Could you preform the Foreign-Identifier Spell? I’d like to check the progress of the cleansing procedure.”
“They really don’t know?” Draco asked him on Friday afternoon.
“But do you think it will help?” Hermione asked gently.
“I’m going – Harry, I’m –“
Draco nodded. He glanced at the Gryffindor table as he left, and he could have sworn Potter was looking right at him for just a second. Draco focused his attention on leaving the Great Hall, his cheeks growing warm as he stared determinedly at the exit.
“Can’t wait.”
Samuel nodded. “But they weren’t always support groups. I’ve jumped around from hospital to one-to-one counseling to groups like these.”
Fuck, he would
They moved to the sitting room after breakfast, Kreacher dutifully cleaning up after them. Harry stuffed his hands nervously in his pockets and watched Draco, working his bottom lip and wondering what to do. Draco himself was walking slowly around the room, studying everything with great intensity.
“Great,” Draco repeated. “Fine.”
At seven, Betty came to give Harry his breakfast and check on his vitals.
Which led him right back to the question which had been bothering Draco since Potter had first cornered him in the bathroom: what was Potter doing hanging around him? Surely, he had better things to do, better people to spend time with. Maybe it was that Draco was just so pathetic and pitiful that Potter felt a moral obligation to help him. It didn’t make sense no matter how Draco put it, but he
She raised her eyebrows but answered him. “Yes, we are. Mum would never forgive us if we didn’t.”
“Fine, owl him. Ask him for his number.”
Harry looked up at the ceiling, embarrassed. “Fucking hell, Draco, it’s like you’re two completely different people.”
Harry shrugged.
Draco was almost glad that Potter’s back was turned on him, for he was certain he looked like a complete fool with his mouth hanging open.
"It's not," Draco said simply. "But you've got to start somewhere."
“Hope I didn’t interrupt any important Healer work,” Harry mumbled.
Harry glanced over at the glowing button before nodding.
Draco sighed. “It’s not your fault, Betty.”
Draco nodded, since that was only two days ago.
lie back down. He lowered himself back down and closed his eyes, letting sleep take him once more.
,” said Leo, the last word much longer than it needed to be, as he leaned forward and supported his argument through the use of excessive hand gestures. “I
“Leo, Betty.”
“It scarred, if that’s what you’re trying to ask,” Draco said shortly.
Potter rubbed at his eyes roughly, wiping the unshed tears away, but didn’t comment on it otherwise.
He closed his eyes. In, out. It was easy, right?
He looked up at Potter, and he found his gaze dropping to Potter’s lips. They were full but chapped. Draco wondered what Potter would taste like.
Draco agonized over it for a while. He did something wrong. He must have. He scared Potter off by reminding him of how much of a repulsive person he was. How he was deeply flawed and wrong and horrible, and Potter was a saint and savior and all things good, and really just the complete opposite of him.
Draco nodded. “And I don’t suppose you have an estimation as to when that started.”
Harry’s heart leapt to his throat.
“Good! I’m glad, Samuel,” Kathy said, smiling at him.
“Oh.”
Kreacher bowed and took his leave.
“Merlin, you’re strange,” Draco sighed. “I’ve got another question – what possessed you to invite me to your little group’s
, even, and Draco, impossibly handsome albeit the obvious worry in his face. He ran his free hand down Draco’s arm (the other was holding a supposedly nice bottle of elf-made wine). “More than fine, really. Gorgeous. I can’t wait until you fuck me into the mattress tonight.”
Draco grimaced at how the question came out, but Harry didn’t seem to mind.
been a year since he’d discharged Potter from St. Mungo’s, and perhaps eleven months since he’d last seen him. He hadn’t realized it, but it was true.
but Harry had gone enough years to know when people were gaping at him.
“I know. Blaise sent me an Owl last week…”
They parted and Harry took in the sight of Draco just centimeters away from him, his grey eyes vibrant and his lips swollen and pink.
Harry winced. “Split-versary, huh? Don’t think I’ve heard that one before.”
“Harry?”
“Thank you, Ernie, Hannah,” Harry said, obviously relaxing.
They whistled lowly. “Five years of silence and then this.”
“Thank you, all of you,” Granger, who had composed herself, smiled slightly. “We’re lucky Harry’s in such good hands.”
“I’m being serious,” Draco continued. He paused. “Whenever we try to talk about you, I just – make it about me. Like I’ve got any right to whinge about how hard life is when I’m the one who made a mess of it.”
“I’m bisexual,” Harry said slowly, as if testing out the word. “That’s the term for it.”
“Looking for you.” Potter’s answer was immediate, which surprised Draco almost as much as the answer itself.
They parted and finished their butterbeers in comfortable silence. When they went to bed ten minutes later, they lay in the dark and cuddled up against each other, and Draco said so quietly Harry almost missed it, “I’ve been sleeping better, too.”
“It’s beautiful,” Harry breathed automatically, and his face heated as he looked up at Draco.
he was. Their kiss deepened, and once again it was open-mouthed but somewhat calmer – less desperate and more appreciative. They moved in unison, neither too fast nor too slow.
“Er, yeah.” Harry scratched his head. “Of course.”
“Potter,” he managed in a tight voice.
Potter shifted, obviously aware of Draco’s traitorous gaze.
"Draco, fuck," Harry mumbled.
“That you love Star Wars.”
“How was it?” Hermione asked tentatively.
“Wow,” Draco said for lack of anything better to say.
“Hmm?”
It was October 31
“Don’t worry,” said Draco, only half-aware of what he was saying, “I’m used to it, remember?”
And he
Well, sort of. He had a few guesses. 1) He wanted to see himself suffer. 2) He wanted a reminder that this was real, he was real. 3) No, that was it.
"I was hungry," he defended, crossing his arms. "I suppose you could have some too..."
“Your body is still weaning off of the potions, so a single dose of Draught –“
“There’s nothing wrong with sex, Harry,” Luna said. “You shouldn’t be ashamed of it.”
Draco was stood talking to Kreacher in the hallway leading into the kitchen, wearing one of Harry's jumpers and a pair of his pyjama pants. Kreacher seemed to notice his presence and turned towards him right away, bending into a deep bow. Draco followed his gaze and smiled at Harry, his facial features melting into something Harry was much too weak for this early in the morning.
“I know, Hermione,” Harry replied. “Go on, it’s fine.”
“Er,” Harry said.
He walked faster, hot tears falling helplessly down his face. His throat was tight and he couldn’t swallow, much less talk. He had only reached the first step before a strong hand clamped around his left arm. Draco tried to pull out of Potter’s grip, but he was too weak. Too damned weak to escape Potter’s clutches. More tears fell, and Draco wiped them violently away with his free hand.
“I tell him everything, Harry!” she said defensively. “This isn’t an exception.”
“Don’t,” Draco said, scrambling for the right words. “Don’t feel bad about it. There’s no reason to. Harry, I’m…I know you said you didn’t want to talk about it, and that I shouldn’t treat you differently, but I’m worried.”
Time to bite the bullet.
“Are you certain?” he asked, his forehead pinched. “I don’t look too formal? Or not formal enough? Or should I just wear robes? Harry-“
“Because we’re in public, at school, where anyone could see us,” Draco answered.
“I don’t fancy –”
that Potter was fit. And even if this wasn’t their situation, he knew that Potter would never want him. For all he knew, he was still a snobby Death Eater in Potter’s mind. And of course, Potter had quite enough to worry about already, regardless.
Harry nodded. “Completely.”
“Yes. It’s not like it was the first time you were ever alone with Malfoy. How’d it go?”
“They will, Luna, after you’re through with them,” Harry said.
“Want to go?” Harry mumbled, his fingers playing with Draco’s hair.
Draco scoffed to himself as he opened the door into his bedroom. He shared the room with Blaise, thank Salazar, who was as neat and organized as they came. He also kept to himself, caring more about his own affairs than anyone else’s, which was certainly useful for Draco.
“You told her?” Harry asked.
Draco bit his tongue, not wanting to say anything embarrassing but Merlin it was hard, it was so hard when everything felt so
Draco could have sworn Weasley’s grip tightened; he bit down a smile. It was hard to blame Weasley, to be truthful, since Leonel was handsome and charming in a slightly nerdy way. Still, Draco didn’t think Granger could ever leave Weasley that easily, and there was also the small fact that Leonel was gay.
It was with a strong sense of déjà vu that Draco was stopped on the staircase, though this time he’d gone up far enough to be concealed by the curve of it.
Draco closed his eyes, and a few seconds later, he gasped as he felt Harry’s hot mouth slide onto his throbbing cock. He bit his lip, trying to contain all the noises he wanted to make, and blindly grabbed for Harry’s hair. He found it and pulled.
“Just say ‘Dr. Julia Wolff’s office,’” advised Malfoy.
“Yes?”
“Don’t…tell anyone, alright?” he asked Ira after a moment of silence.
“Right, sorry.” He snapped his attention away from Potter.
"Is there anything else I can do for you right now, Harry?"
“Is there anything else?”
Draco looked wary but released him. Harry was relieved he didn’t have to say anything else when Noc flew back in, swooping onto Harry’s pillow once more. He unattached the scroll and read Ron’s note:
“You can ask him,” Draco nodded. “He’ll gladly tell you about himself. Healer Estrada likes to be professional in the work setting, but he’s a really nice bloke, I promise you.”
A hand was touching his face – a palm caressing his cheek.
They walked over to the chairs to sit down next to one another.
“I’m fine,” Draco said, his throat tight. “You just caught me at a bad time.”
“God, Draco,” Harry mumbled, and refocused Draco’s attention with his hands, kissing him deeply.
“No, of course not,” hissed Draco, shaking his arm free. “Let’s not talk about this now. It won’t do either of us any good. Let’s just go to my flat, have breakfast, and have a civilized conversation. All right?”
a mark, Harry,” Draco said, disbelief in his voice. “It’s
Stay safe everyone!
and slid it out of its casing. “We’re watching it. Sit your arse down on the couch.”
He wrapped himself around Draco and burrowed his face in his chest. “Sure.”
“I…alright,” said Malfoy (or perhaps Draco), furrowing his brows. “Harry.”
Draco flinched at the name, despite it being years since he died.
“I’m fine,” he said sharply. “Stop gawking.”
think?”
Potter’s eyes were still closed, and his breaths were shallow, but he had confirmed that he could drink it. Leonel carefully tilted Potter’s head forward and tipped the vial into his open mouth. After ensuring that Potter had successfully swallowed it, Leonel laid his head back down on the pillow and put the empty vial away.
"You think I don't know that?" Harry asked impatiently. "I didn't even realize until Estrada said…
“And when I finally did,” Harry continued, “I couldn’t stop wondering what if would have been like if I’d had a ‘normal’ life. Would I have found out earlier? I mean, I didn’t know something...so significant about myself until now – it took me eighteen years. Although I didn’t even know I was a wizard until I was eleven, so maybe it’s pretty in-line with my life so far...”
Harry stared down at his hands. Why
“Six quid for you,” said Johnny. He shook out four of the pills and transferred them to a smaller bag.
Draco left Potter’s room, his mind now focused on finding a Mind Healer for Potter. They weren't in short supply after the war, what with the trauma and all, but Draco still wanted to provide Potter with the best treatment possible. Draco had gone to a Mind Healer himself, mostly at his mother's and Pansy's insistence.
They sat in tense silence for a moment, and then Slughorn addressed the entire class.
Draco flushed spectacularly and bit down a smile. He was sure Harry couldn’t see it, given the distance, but from her chuckle, it sounded like Astoria certainly did.
“And my wand?” said Harry, itching to have it back in his possession.
“I assure you, I’m anything but,” Pansy said. “I’ll never look at anyone like that, and thank Merlin for that. I don’t particularly want to be seen looking that foolish.”
“Oh.”
“It wasn’t a fucking compliment.”
“Alright. Tomorrow then. Good night, Harry,” she said.
“I’ll need you to fill out this form and update your contact information, please.”
“And then on top of all this, you fancy him,” Ira finished simply.
He guessed he was somewhere past tipsy but not quite drunk. He lost Pansy somewhere after the third drink, and Blaise had disappeared far before then.
“You can’t just excuse it all,” Draco said angrily. “I’m not a good person, Potter. I never was, and I never will be. Even if I didn’t have this fucking Mark on me, I wouldn’t be good. I almost killed your best friend, for Merlin’s sake, and Granger was tortured in my own bloody home!”
“She has a name you know,” Potter said, but he sounded less angry. “We talk. She doesn’t know what happened though. That’s actually…”
“Oh no, I was awake.”
Draco felt the hot liquid spread within him and leak out as Harry pulled out completely, his chest rising and falling heavily. Harry’s hand went from Draco’s throat to his cock and he pumped fiercely, panting all the while. Draco moaned, his entire being sensitive after being neglected; it was only half a minute before Draco came all over Harry’s hand and his own stomach.
“May I?” Draco asked, hands on the buttons of Harry’s trousers.
Draco started to turn to leave but Potter grabbed his arm roughly. Potter’s eyes, especially bright against the dark of the evening, were staring intensely into Draco’s own. His eyebrows were furrowed and his jaw was clenched. Draco wanted to look away, but he couldn’t.
Draco came just a moment later, pulsing deep into Harry as he cried out as well, belatedly releasing his hand from Harry’s neck.
Draco made it through the rest of the first day, though his mind wasn’t nearly as present as it should have been. He was now sat between Blaise and Pansy in the Great Hall, both half-heartedly talking about their first day back. Draco couldn’t find the energy to contribute to their conversation, choosing instead to move his dinner back and forth on his plate. He could tell Pansy was getting increasingly annoyed by his pointless actions, the way she kept pursing her lips and shifting her eyes away from Blaise to glare momentarily at Draco’s plate. With a sigh, he put his fork down and tried to listen to his friends.
“I don’t think I’ve ever had the pleasure. Formally, at least,” Samuel said, and extended his hand.
Harry moved his arm so it looped around Draco’s waist. His touch was warm, and Draco was thankful. They sat there in silence like that for a few minutes, and then Harry spoke, his voice soft.
Sure enough, at half past noon, Malfoy and Estrada came into Harry’s room.
A silver squirrel burst out of her wand in wisps.
“Let’s walk, since,” Harry gestured towards the Great Hall, just a few steps away.
All the commotion was intensifying Harry’s headache and making it even harder to think straight.
“You love it,” Harry smiled, seeing right through Draco.
He glared down at her. “No, I’m not.”
“Fuck, Draco,” Harry hissed, his hands now gripping Draco’s arse desperately. “You’re so fucking hot.”
“Hey boss,” greeted Leo with a grin.
“Fine,” he said lowly and turned to go. Potter’s eye seemed to catch on the broken mirror as if noticing it for the first time, and he stopped. “Sorry.
“Yeah,” Weasley added, recovering from his shock. “I doubt we’ll ever be best mates, Malfoy, but I appreciate it. And if Harry likes you, I guess you can’t be all that bad.”
“I’m glad you know you’re mental already,” said the mirror. “I didn’t want to be the one to break it to you.”
There, Malfoy kissed him more as his hand rubbed against Harry’s hard cock over his jeans. Harry impatiently untucked Malfoy’s shirt, allowing him to freely run his hands over Malfoy’s smooth skin. When Malfoy began to stroke harder, Harry let out a hiss and gripped Malfoy’s arse.
Draco listened interestedly, and was silently glad Harry didn’t think it would have worked.
Draco snorted into his drink before having some more. He savored the sweetness and the tartness that intermingled in his mouth, and the slight aftertaste of alcohol that lingered afterwards. He took another drink, his eyes once again falling on Potter. He’d never seen Potter drunk before, and it was almost surreal. It seemed not so long ago that they were both boys engaged in petty school rivalries, and now –
Even though Harry brushed this all off (how could he be a ‘wonderful person’ when he was actually the worst person in the world?), a small part of him warmed inside.
“I didn’t realize you were so sentimental,” Draco said to Ron, and Harry turned to look at him, pleasantly surprised. Draco was smiling a bit, seeming more relaxed. “Congratulations. I know it can’t mean much from me but really – like Harry said…it’s a good match.”
“So I wanted to tell you that I spoke to Ron and Hermione. I apologized for being distant and said that I should have just opened up to them earlier,” Harry took a deep breath, “And then I told them that I’m bisexual and I was seeing someone.”
now that Draco could finally see that Potter was indeed the hero that he was rumored to be. After years of just hearing about how great and brave and
"Benzos, cannabis, and ecstasy," he choked out, staring hard at his hands. "They were from people I just met in clubs before they turned into, er..."
Draco could hardly believe this was Harry’s first time sucking someone off, but then, it was so typical of him to be naturally good at everything. The things he did with his tongue, how he swirled it around the tip - Merlin. Draco let himself moan freely and move his hips, encouraging Harry.
“You ­
He might not have believed it if a naked Harry Potter (save for socks, Draco thought) wasn’t snuggled up next to him, but there he was. Draco laid there, taking it all in, unable to stop a smile from spreading across his face.
Malfoy wrote something down again.
“Morning, Healer Wolff,” replied Harry.
“It’ll be fine,” she said soothingly, her breath warm against his shoulder.
“You can sit down, Malfoy.”
“I thought that was Wolff’s job.”
of what you have, he’d have already been dead. Salazar, I thought your
“Have you ever been sucked off by a bloke before?” Draco asked lowly, gazing up at Harry in time to see him looking weakly at him. Draco felt his own cock push against the inside of his trousers. “Well, that’s about to be a yes.”
Ginny. They resumed things after the war, but it felt wrong. Forced. He was alive, sure, but not in the way he was before. He often wondered if he’d come back wrong after dying.
Finally, Harry turned to meet the gazes of everyone in the room – Hermione, Ron, Malfoy, and the girl from earlier, Betty?
“And why’s that?”
As Draco wrote this down, he spoke again.
“You can go
“How lovely, thank you boys. You must be freezing without your cloaks! Well go on, there’s hot food and drinks in the kitchen; Ron and Hermione will be in there too,” she beamed.
If Malfoy was going to say something then, Harry wouldn’t know; a young female server approached them with a smile plastered on her face.
Samuel shook it. “Samuel. You can call me Sam, though.”
“I know. Don’t worry. I’m alright – er, well, as alright as I can be.”
“They’re Aurors, actually,” Leo answered. He nodded towards Betty. “That’s why we think someone intentionally poisoned him with an intent to harm, or worse.”
“When? For how long?”
“And you know his friends, too.” It wasn’t framed like a question.
"What are you doing back there?"
Harry began to kiss and suck Draco’s throat, gently at first before applying pressure. Knowing how easily his skin bruised, Draco felt another little flutter of excitement at the prospect of being marked by Harry. And plus, it felt so incredibly good.
After marathoning all the Star Wars films Harry had (Harry told Draco that the next would be coming out soon enough, don’t worry), they had had sex and fallen asleep soon after.
“What, this?” Draco asked innocently, betrayed only by his wicked smirk and the fact that he had grasped Harry’s cock through his pants.
“I miss Harry already,” she said at one point, slumping forward and pouting slightly. “He was by
The front door opened then, and both Harry and Ginny jumped and turned to see who it was.
Harry nodded again and looked down at the parchment. Written neatly was indeed Wolff’s and Malfoy’s names and the addresses of their workplace. Below that were the names of four Mind Healers in the area and their own work addresses. He thanked Malfoy, folded the parchment into a square, and stuffed it into his pocket.
“I’m sorry, I’m so sorry...”
“Harry?”
Draco grimaced, suddenly assaulted by a vision of Granger and Weasley –
“About what?” she asked, a curious smile on her face.
Draco froze, and then he saw a wide grin spread over Weasley’s face.
"Well, my thing is rubbish. I'd rather have a quirky yet endearing habit."
“It’s not,” Draco assured him, “And Merlin knows it isn’t. But it’s what I have to do.”
George tapped Harry’s glass with his own.
“Hold your hands out.”
“You need to get out more, Sam,” Cait said. “We should all go down to the pub again. That was fun, wasn’t it?”
anymore. And I haven’t had any, er, escapades in a year.”
He stared down at his mobile. A blank message screen stared back at him. With effort, he slowly typed in his first attempt.
“Hey, you lot,” Harry said, going over to hug Ron and Hermione in turn. “Congratulations, again.”
“We do, yeah,” agreed Harry, nodding and walking her over to the fireplace. “Loads of stuff.”
“It’s true.”
Potter nodded. “Good. I’m glad.”
“Oh, Merlin, oh Draco, fuck-“
“Come here, I’m freezing.”
“You really should,” Ira advised with a smile. “You’ll feel loads better.”
“Y’know, Malfoy, I never realized how funny you were. Guess it’s easier to appreciate the jokes when they’re not made at your expense.”
Harry shrugged noncommittally. And then it sunk in that he was discussing Malfoy in fucking
He received a visceral reaction from Harry at those last two words; a startled blink of the eyes and a quick, sharp breath in. Draco relaxed in his chair, satisfied.
“Well,” Draco said, clearing his throat and suddenly feeling off balance, “Why don’t you tell her? Ginevra? You two still seem chummy enough.”
He scoffed as he said it. Astoria’s eyes widened and she smiled in a way that plainly said, ‘you’re having me on.’
,” Draco murmured in a voice that went straight to Harry’s cock, and Harry let out a breathy laugh. He stopped. “What?”
“It’s not a matter of weakness-“
tell you, correct?” he asked, voicing his thoughts with a sigh.
Back to the task at hand. Draco took a deep breath.
Samuel nodded as Harry spoke, encouraging him.
Harry was one hundred percent convinced that Draco Malfoy worried too much for his own good. He probably even
“Ron made me stop. It was getting out of hand or something."
“Before you leave,” Malfoy answered as he stood up.
Harry scoffed. “What did he need you for, anyway? He just worked for Voldemort until it wasn’t convenient anymore. Then he just ran away cos he's a coward," Harry told the card feverishly. "I was actually fighting against Voldemort, I
“Jesus, Draco,” Leonel said. He put the paperweight down. “Forgive me for caring about your health.”
Draco had drawn close, his eyes pained. Harry’s eyes dropped from Draco’s own, finding them to be overwhelming, and he focused instead on how Draco’s fingers were gripping his clothes way too tightly.
But Harry didn’t.
Ira raised their eyebrows. “Who says you can’t?”
“But what’s so wrong about it? It’s just a dream, isn’t it? Dear Scarlett isn’t going to fire you for something your subconscious made up.”
"Harry, you -" she stopped again. She stared at him. "So you really
Potter walked in, apparently unbothered by this, and sat down next to two vaguely familiar Hufflepuffs.
was too much for Potter; if Draco was the cause of a relapse, he didn’t know if he could ever forgive himself.
“God. If I’m hungover tomorrow morning, I’m blaming all of you,” Leo told them, glaring at the three of them in turn.
In spite of himself, Harry managed a laugh, a real one.
“I dunno, like they didn’t treat me
Harry shrugged. “Probably. It was obvious that something wasn’t…right at that point, and when they’d come over to my flat, I either didn’t have time or didn’t care enough to hide the evidence.”
“Yes, Healer,” said Leonel and Betty at once.
have a potions addiction,” he said calmly, “And we at St. Mungo’s are fully committed to helping you recover from it. But first, you need to focus on answering these questions and not interrupting me, if you please.”
“As do we, I’m sure,” Malfoy glanced back at Harry momentarily.
Harry looked away; Draco couldn’t read his face. And then Draco realized something, his chest sinking as he did so.
Draco was chain smoking. He knew it didn’t do his physical health any favors, but he needed it.
Johnny was waving a baggie in Harry's face. The white powder inside was tantalizing, and Harry smiled.
“Butterbeer, please,” Leo was saying to the bartender. Once he’d gotten it, he smiled and turned towards Draco. “Hey, boss.”
“I think I had a fair bit to worry about,” Harry disagreed.
"Draco, I…"
Draco’s smile grew.
“Alright,” Harry said once the Weasleys had Flooed away (they’d generously brought their own and left some with Harry and Draco – “it’s a housewarming gift”), “They’re gone.”
Potter had set the core on the grass beside him and was now licking his fingers. Sighing, Draco Vanished his garbage for him.
Draco watched as Leo took another long pull from his Butterbeer. He’d also chosen to wear Muggle clothes tonight, dressed in a t-shirt that advertised what Draco assumed to be an American Muggle band and dark-wash jeans. He looked good, Draco thought against his best interest, admiring Leo’s strong arms as he leaned back against the bar.
Draco began by licking the shaft of Harry’s cock and traveling up the underside of it, all the way up to the tip. Draco felt Harry’s body tense and shudder beneath him, and Draco smirked.
would do. Just as long as he wasn’t sober.
“Don’t do whatever it is you’re thinking. You’ve been doing so well recently.”
Of course. Of course, it was so bloody obvious now, looking back at it.
"Sorry, Harry, but that stupid git should be the last thing on your mind right now. You've got much more important things to focus on, like
Harry let out a sharp sigh and studied Draco. His expression was serious, but his eyes were soft, making Harry feel just a little bit better.
“Yup.”
"I am certain Mungo's would be happy to accommodate you for the time being. Do you have someone to keep you accountable?"
He walked briskly back to his hospital room (
He’d been slipping up and enabling Harry’s agenda of Make Draco Eat, which was the exact opposite of his own, Stop Eating. His was so simple, straight-forward, and ultimately superior in every way.
“I should hope so.”
Potter just stood there for a moment, staring at him with those piercing green eyes, before nodding and stepping back.
There, Draco took a quick shower and dressed himself, avoiding the mirrors and his own body as much as possible. Once clothed, he chanced a glance at his reflection. He combed his hair with his fingers and turned his head this way and that, examining and loathing every little detail of his face.
“What was that about, Potter?”
“Welcome back, Potter,” said Malfoy as soon as Harry had tumbled onto his floor.
Hermione sighed. “I didn’t think she’d be able to come so early, with both her and Blaise so busy –”
“Night, Harry,” said Weasley.
compromise your health for my own selfish reasons.”
“Yes?” he stopped in front of the closed door and directed his gaze at Potter, who was wringing his hands in his lap.
“All right, Scarhead, what about you?” Draco returned, and Harry laughed – he well and truly felt like he was a teenager again.
“Yeah, of course.”
“All I’m saying is, I haven’t seen aggression like that in ages, and I’m in university,” Samuel said, lifting his hands, a smile playing on his lips. “So
One of the blokes in group approached Harry while Samuel was talking to Kathy off to the side. Harry had first seen him the first time he went to a meeting – he was a black bloke with a wide smile and closely cropped hair. A few weeks ago, he had learned that his name was Damien and that he, too, was rather close with Samuel (in mental illness support group standards, at least).
“Now you’re the one being stupid,” he sniffed. “He kept himself alive out of pure spite, and I hope to one day do the same.”
“Well,” Harry said, and cleared his throat. “I’m still sorry for what I did…in sixth year. I swear to God I didn’t know what that curse did.”
“Hello, Granger. I trust you’re well?”
Wow can you believe I've updated so quickly? Me neither.
Harry woke up with a pounding ache in his head. He'd hardly been awake for two moments when an overwhelming urge to throw up overcame him, and he did so promptly.
for it in a way. No, he was dreading seeing Malfoy. Harry hadn’t spoken or even seen him since his confession two days past, with only Betty coming in to take his vitals and note his progress now. He’d been filled with a mix of relief and hurt – was Malfoy that put off by him that he’d send a trainee Healer in his stead? But of course, the last thing Harry had done
Draco scoffed and looked away, feeling his face got hot.
Draco crossed his arms and glared at Potter, who only realized it when he’d looked up from his plate. His eyes flitted down to Draco’s still-empty plate, then back up to Draco’s face.
Before he could say more, he felt a hand on his shoulder and he whirled around, seething. Harry was looking calmly at him, his hand now gripping Draco’s shoulder tightly.
“Oh, so there’s feelings attached?” Ira asked, leaning closer and voice changing. “It wasn’t just pure filth?”
“Look, Potter,” Draco ground out, “I realize that this isn’t an optimal situation, what with me being me and you being you, but when it comes down to it, I am your
“That’s all it is!”
Harry tried to keep glaring at her. “Fine. I guess. I dunno.”
“It’s better now,” Harry said, still avoiding the question. “It used to be worse, but now I hardly ever need dreamless sleep.”
Draco shucked his shirt off aggressively, tossing it to the side, and crawled on his hands and knees on top of Harry. Harry's breaths were short as he looked up at Draco, wondering what would happen next. Draco lowered his hips and straddled Harry, startling a gasp out of him when he felt just how hard Draco was. This made Draco smirk, his hair falling in his eyes as he did so.
Harry’s voice snapped him out of it. He was looking at Draco with concern – how long had he been lost in thought? Draco colored and stepped back.
“It doesn’t mean you deserve to die,” Harry countered angrily.
Draco’s throat was dry. “Well, I’m not shagging anyone.” When Potter looked over at him sharply, Draco amended, “I mean – I’m not busy. I can listen.” He was at least twelve hundred percent sure his face had turned pink again given the burning sensation on his cheeks. Potter was still staring at him, and Draco finished weakly, “If you want me to.”
“I’m sorry, I –“ Draco broke off, looking down and pulling nervously at the edges of his long sleeves. He didn’t like how difficult speaking to Harry was; it’d actually been relatively
“He was trying to convince me not to go to Hogwarts. He knew – er, what your father was up to.”
Draco shifted against him and let out a sleepy moan, drawing Harry’s attention to him being half-hard. He bit down a smile as he studied Draco’s face, his back, and his marked arm. God, he was beautiful. It still astounded Harry that someone so gorgeous could be interested in
“He’s sort of…well, something happened last time. We got into a row, and it just, made me feel alive again?” His statement inadvertently turned into a question towards the end. Harry’s cheeks warmed – he felt ridiculous saying all these things. To Luna in a Muggle supermarket, nevertheless. “It was like…before all this happened. The war, I mean. Y’know?”
When Harry didn’t say anything, Ginny nodded resolutely.
“That was in a different context and is a completely different situation.”
“Er, yeah – sorry,” Harry mumbled.
“You’re welcome, Potter.”
“Fine, I’ll stop bringing it up,” Harry said, and Draco relaxed. And then, only half-joking, he warned, “But you better mark your calendar, Malfoy, because as soon as my year is up, I’ll be sending you an owl.”
“I mean; I reckon he could be but…are you sure?”
Harry frowned and moved closer, pressing his thigh against Draco’s.
“No, it’s not,” Draco growled. “They can’t get away with this.”
Harry was feeling especially vulnerable now. Letting go of your secrets and revealing them to a Mind-Healer and his two best friends turned out to be exhausting.
Draco let out a humorless laugh. “With all of your baggage? At least one lifetime, I think.”
There was a knock at the door around 10 pm. Malfoy walked in with his clipboard and a Healer Harry hadn’t seen before. He was ridiculously handsome with his thick dark hair and bright eyes.
Potter must’ve planned this, thought Draco as he looked at the other boy. He had purposefully taken Draco down to the secret kitchen and blathered on to keep him there even after they’d eaten, just so Draco wouldn’t throw it up.
have weekly heart-to-hearts? Color me surprised.”
Harry nodded again, and then Malfoy flicked his wand at him. It’d been years since he’d felt this particular charm wash over him, but it was just as strange now as it had been then. Harry looked down at himself and saw to his satisfaction that he was properly camouflaged.
Draco saw Harry’s smile as he pulled back and thrust again, his cock tight and thick within Draco. His head dropped against the mattress and he forced his eyes shut, reveling in the raw, primal sensation of Harry Potter fucking him.
“Fine.”
Kathy seemed to sense that he wasn’t saying everything, so he reluctantly continued.
"I wouldn’t be surprised," Potter smirked, and Draco positively melted. "See you, Malfoy."
Draco and Harry found just small moments throughout the school week to meet. Apparently, Granger and Weasley had started paying more attention to Harry again after he’d told them the truth about what had happened in the forest. He found it harder to sneak away since the two of them were spending less time alone together. When he did slip away from time to time, Harry told Draco, it just seemed to heighten their curiosity for who he was seeing.
And amazingly enough, Draco did.
Feeling marginally calmer, Draco huffed and crossed his arms. “Then what?”
“It’s different, Potter,” Draco said, all the energy gone out of his voice, “And you know it. This is…intentional.”
“I’m not having a psychotic break, alright? Just the normal amount of mental,” Potter told him with a frown. “I couldn’t sleep, so I thought I’d just, er, walk around.”
“That’s sick.”
He was trying to think of something to say (
Harry drifted off, embarrassed. He still remembered his first time – how he’d felt self-conscious in front of the bloke, and how horrible it had tasted afterwards. Most of all, he remembered how great it had felt.
well, in fact. It almost seemed like Potter enjoyed his company, and Draco would easily admit that he enjoyed his time spent with Potter. He’d thought that they had been getting along better than ever, and now their progress had seemingly been undone. What had happened in the last day?
Malfoy glanced sideways at him, and to Harry’s delight and surprise, his voice was slightly slurred when he spoke.
He handed the empty bottle back to Estrada, who took it from him, closed it, and put it in his pocket. Harry regarded him for a moment, and then said, "Harry's fine."
Harry spilled all over himself and Draco’s hand, feeling his vision black out for a moment, feeling outside of his body and dizzy with ecstasy as he cried out and released. He watched as Draco finished just a couple seconds later; Harry felt it spread inside him and watched as the aftershocks carried Draco for a few more thrusts before he pulled himself out, his chest rising and falling unevenly.
“Oh, business as usual,” Blaise said in that silken voice of his. “It's a nice place, but there’s far too much greenery, if you ask me.”
“Granger,” he said nervously. “Weasley.”
“Can’t know for sure yet,” Harry said truthfully. “It’s only been one meeting. But I’m going to keep going.”
Malfoy rose to the challenge.
“There’s nothing to be sorry about,” Draco said softly.
“God,” he whispered, wondering how Draco could make him feel so weak.
“Fuck,” Draco breathed.
In a way, venturing out into the corridors in the dead of night was him "preparing" for the outside. That was when he saw Malfoy walking through the corridor alone. Harry's curiosity was piqued, and the rest was history.
Draco then fished through the bottom drawer of his desk for one of Healer Wolff’s business cards – simple little things with a framed Wolff smiling solemnly on them. He held it in his hands, frowning down at the black-and-white Wolff.
“Potter…” Draco was getting more concerned by the second.
“The blond bloke?” he asked once he’d turned back around. Harry nodded. Samuel frowned. “Name’s Draco. Haven’t talked to him much, to be honest, but he’s been here almost as long as I have. Kind of quiet. Keeps to himself. Why?”
He thought about his time during fifth year, compared to Harry’s, and felt that he was really the one who was sick. He went along with that cruel woman, blindingly following her lead. Blindingly following the leads of monsters could be the title of his autobiography, he thought.
“Even if you didn’t, why would you try to help me? That’s what you’re doing, isn’t it?”
Halloween always brought a flurry of emotions and thoughts with it, threatening to drown Harry with endless questions that could never be answered. What if they had never been killed that night? What if the prophecy never existed? What if Harry had just been a normal fucking kid with parents who were
“Nothing,” Draco said dismissively.
When Draco woke up it tasted like something had died in his mouth.
“I believe I’ve already told you that he
He shut his eyes and the fire took him far away from Malfoy’s office, dumping him out onto a carpeted floor.
Draco fell silent. Was Potter mad? Upset? Irritated, most likely, if the look on his face told Draco anything.
Draco gave an audible gasp and stepped back, his free hand coming to his chest. Weasley badly stifled a laugh.
The fact that there weren’t any for Wizards was a major shortcoming of Wizarding society, Harry thought. Along with the lack of the Internet, and ballpoint pens, and probably hundreds of other Muggle inventions. Someday he’d have to make a list of all the things the Wizarding world was missing out on.
His stomach dropped and he glanced away, embarrassed. “Oh.”
On the other hand, his mother was there. He knew she was lonely with only the house elves for company, and he hated that he couldn’t be there for her. She had asked if he knew what he was doing for break in her most recent letter. He hadn’t replied yet.
wasn’t coming from a room – it was following him. His tired brain suddenly awake and alert, he reached into his robes and grabbed hold of his wand. Draco drew it slowly as he scanned his surroundings. He didn’t see anything, but there
Harry narrowed his eyes. “And this is the same Draco Malfoy we’re talking about?”
He supposed that was fair, but it still…why did it leave Draco feeling disappointed?
“Great,” snapped Draco. “Lovely. I wasn’t aware that I was treating a five-year-old.”
“Wha – Ginny? She’s not my girlfriend,” Potter said, ignoring the other questions. He came closer and put a hand out, his face stony again. “Come on Malfoy, let’s get you to Pomfrey.”
“Just - with the war. You know.”
Leo only grinned cockily. “You’ll still let me though. So tell me, what is it? Hot date tonight?”
Harry nodded slowly.
He shut his eyes, trying his best to remember. The memories of that day were either fuzzy or not there at all.
Potter gave a hollow laugh. “Brilliant.”
“Oh,” Harry said. He scooched closer to Draco, touched that he’d noticed. “Yeah, it’s fine. Two beers in two hours is perfectly normal, Draco.”
“I’m surprised at you. Didn’t Granger start that pro-elf group back at school? SICK, or SPIT, or something?”
What was the point?
“Oh, well, thanks,” Harry said, “But could you get back to
“Nah,” Johnny said, smiling. “Just answer your phone more often, alright?”
“Is something wrong? I didn’t think Weasley was capable of waking up this early.”
Harry deflated. He couldn’t face Mrs. Weasley, not yet.
Speaking of self-destruction, Draco was currently holed up in the sixth-floor bathroom, purging himself of the little food he’d eaten at dinner. He finished quickly and went to rinse himself off, thinking about how Pansy had seemed torn between shouting at him and crying when she saw him leaving. Blaise wasn’t at the table, apparently too preoccupied to join them like he had been for the past few days. Daphne had barely blinked when he stood, but Astoria had regarded him with a soft expression, her mouth pulled down in a slight frown.
“Alright,” she said and approached him. “This is the Fever-Reducing Potion, and it’s rather self-explanatory.”
“Hmm?”
“I’m the happiest I’ve been in a while, Pansy,” Draco said truthfully. “Really. And even though being around Weasley and Granger brings up things I don’t want to think about, Potter makes it worth it.”
"You…sounded like you were sick."
"I don't bloody want to!"
“Anything for you, you prat.”
“How do you still not understand?” Draco interrupted, his voice colder than it had been in months. “Leave me alone. I don’t want you here, Potter.”
Potter spoke again, and a wand - Draco’s wand - came into view. He could barely keep up - he was the true master of the Elder wand - that fabled wand (it was real?) - except he wasn’t anymore, not since Potter “overpowered” him at the manor. Draco squirmed. He felt his family’s eyes on him.
“I’m pleased you’ve decided to stay,” Malfoy said evenly. “I really believe you’ll benefit from giving a full recovery a chance. I’ll go ahead and contact the Mind-Healers and see if any of them will be able to take you on. Don’t worry – I’ll be discreet.”
Harry took his glasses off and rubbed his eyes.
Draco went pink, and Harry sputtered. Samuel laughed next to Harry.
.’ He grinned to himself before letting her know he’d be over the next day around noon.
Finally, Potter stopped and took hold of Draco’s arm, tugging him closer. Draco looked up at the faces of Hermione Granger and Ron Weasley.
Harry was the one who broke the silence unexpectedly. “I feel bad now.”
“And nobody will know you’re here, either. Healer White and I will make sure nobody outside of this department knows, alright?”
“They don’t even know if the person I’m seeing is a man or a woman,” Harry assured him. “Promise they have no clue it's you.”
The good thing about Potter was that he understood on some level. They never talked explicitly about these particular feelings (besides their drunken conversation on Halloween), but Draco knew Potter had issues of his own. They had a silent, mutual understanding to not bring them up. Draco didn’t know if this was healthy or not, but it worked, and that was good enough for him.
“Ok,” Harry said, staring into those grey eyes as he did so.
“Right,” Harry said, tugging on the bottom of the dark green jumper. “Anyway, it’s not a date. Malfoy and I
“You’re right,” she said. “Harry, I’m sorry. I wouldn’t leave if I didn’t have to.”
Ron shrugged. “I mean, if it’s cause of a spell, there’s that ward in St. Mungo’s.”
"Well, you said you came over in the 90s, right?" Harry asked, and when she nodded, he said, "Then I reckon you already know who I am."
Abigail made a face. “I’ve only slept eight hours in the past three nights. But it’s nearly the weekend, so I think I might be able to catch up a bit.”
"You ok, boss?" Leo asked after Draco had given him a pre-shift.
“So let me get this straight. You jerked off a wizard in a loo. The wizard in question is someone who just happens to go to the
“So why don’t you stop?”
Draco took another drag. Potter seemed to be deep in thought.
“You don’t need to be grateful for what they did for you. Because what they did
what Draco wanted to see. “I’ll see you tomorrow, then, Malfoy.”
“Won’t you be cold?” he said instead.
"What sort of potions did you take?"
They had showered and fallen into bed together once more. He was impossibly comfortable, an arm curled protectively around Draco, savoring the feel of the other man’s warm body pressed against him and the sound of his steady breaths. He felt at peace for the first time in…he didn’t even know how long.
He pumped his finger in and out of Draco, his green eyes locked on Draco’s own the entire time. By the time Harry had put three in, Draco was flushing furiously and his heart was pounding, wishing Harry wasn’t staring at him so intensely.
“Maybe,” said Potter.
Even though they were both hungover and exhausted, this kiss was so much better than the first. Draco was clear-headed now and able to enjoy every little sensation. The gentle but firm press of Harry’s lips, his little intake of breath when Draco pushed his tongue into Harry’s mouth, the softness of Harry’s hair. He smelled good; his scent mixed with sweat somehow acting as an aphrodisiac.
“I dunno who’s going to be madder at you, Zabini or your coach.”
Draco suddenly felt dangerously close to crying, and Heaven knew he wouldn’t let Potter see him like
Harry nodded.
“Yes, well, Rose and I finished our errands early, so we decided to stop by,” explained Hermione. “So, you’ve finished moving in, then?”
“Good. Thank you, Betty. I’ll head on over there now. What’s the room number?”
“Draco, don’t say that,” Harry said. “I
“No,” Draco said quickly, and Leo’s grin only grew. The bastard. “I’m just…supposed to be meeting someone.”
Draco pushed forward. “We’re very committed to helping you. You just have to let us.”
Malfoy’s tongue was tied as well, it seemed, for he didn’t say anything in response.
He felt euphoric as he’d purged himself of the food he’d eaten that morning; a bit of porridge and cantaloupe. It had been a little while since he'd been able to and he forgot how good it felt afterwards.
“Have you told them yet?” Draco asked quietly. His voice was clear in the silent library.
Harry glared at him. “You’re such a prat.”
“Make house calls often, do you?” Harry asked, finally making eye contact with Malfoy again.
Draco fixed Harry was a tired glare. “Should I leave?”
Potter stared, as if he was trying to figure Draco out. The intensity of his gaze made Draco uncomfortable, and it made him remember the last time they had this much eye contact – seven months ago in the Manor. Draco felt simultaneously ill and aroused, making him even more disgusted in himself.
Draco swallowed thickly. His skin tingled at the thought of another man touching him – he hadn’t pulled since they’d broken up, and if it was Leo himself who broke the spell…
“Right,” Harry exhaled, feeling uncomfortable. “Well. Should we go back in, then?”
“I won’t be completing anything,” Harry shot back, his annoyance growing exponentially. Harry advanced on Malfoy, his lightheadedness forgotten in his anger. Harry gripped the front of Malfoy’s green robes and looked him square in the eye. “You let me the fuck out of here now.”
“Ssh. Sleep,” Harry said, and Draco did.
“You look
Harry grinned. Yes, he really did like Samuel.
“Harry…”
Malfoy’s forehead pinched, and Harry was worried that he would clam up again.
Embarrassed, Draco tried to backtrack. “I mean, of course, it’s completely fine if we aren’t, I was just wondering - “
Harry made his way over to where Hermione was cutting various vegetables. She handed him a knife and an onion, and he went to work.
Potter looked down at them; the slight smile grew.
"Why a…"
"Good morning, Master Harry," Kreacher said. "Young Master Malfoy has been asking for breakfast for both masters."
“Nothing,” Draco said. He studied his hands. “It’s all right, isn’t it? That you’re drinking.”
“I’m an idiot,” Harry said suddenly, and walked away.
“They won’t bite, y’know.”
Wolff nodded, writing notes as he spoke.
“Sorry, I just have a question,” Harry said. “Are you going to tell Malfoy about, er, everything?”
“I know,” said Potter defensively. “Betty’s nice. I just don’t know the American bloke well. He…”
“Not bloody likely.”
“You don’t need to do that right now.”
“When’s the last time you’ve eaten?”
about your findings. Did he seem to respond well to the treatment?”
“Thanks, Draco.”
Harry bit his lip and focused on the ground instead of on Malfoy’s tense face. A headache was beginning to form and he would’ve liked nothing more than to lay down in his bed, but he stayed where he was.
“Are you alright?” Malfoy asked, his grey eyes fixed on Harry.
Harry stopped, making Draco stop with him. He took Draco’s scowling face in his free hand and looked him square in the eye. Draco pouted but didn’t look away.
“S-sorry,” he stammered. “Merlin, that was – I’m sorry, that was, I shouldn’t have done that.”
eat, he felt nauseated, either "naturally" or through his own, fucked-up means. The feeling of food in his stomach had grown foreign to him. It had become unnatural, uncomfortable. Getting rid of it granted him some peace of mind, a sort of high, per se.
“It’s your fault,” Draco finally said, glaring at Harry. “You’ve been forcing me to eat every day and I need to – to fix it.”
“Where’s my wand, Malfoy?”
“Do you like being difficult? What do you get out of it? What could you
thought Draco as he stared down at the frankly appalling amount of food laid out on the table. And Salazar, he
Harry's cock twitched – it was morning, after all.
“He’s been acting strangely these past few days, and I don’t know what’s caused it. When I ask him about it, he dismisses it and says that everything is fine when it’s clearly not,” Draco told her. “It’s just – a bit worrying that his mood has shifted so suddenly and so close to his scheduled release, and even worse that he hasn’t told me what’s caused it.”
“Don’t.” Harry shook his head. “I er, wouldn’t have talked about it anyway. It was enough to know I wasn’t alone, y’know?”
"You're wasting your time, Potter."
“Salazar, you’re infuriating,” Pansy said between gritted teeth. Draco wondered if she would pull at her hair next. “You’re not even listening to me. I just asked
“I heard you talking to Estrada out in the corridor, heard him talking about
“Oh,” said Harry. He looked down at it in interest and skimmed the entrees. “Yeah, sounds great, Malfoy.”
Harry regained his composure and glared at Draco. “No, maybe not. But I can tell Madam Pomfrey. Or your mother.”
Potter frowned, and the hand that was in Draco’s hair froze. “You’re not a Death Eater.”
“Have you ever talked to them about this?”
“Thank you, Madam Pince.”
“Yeah,” said Potter, frowning all over again. “I walked in on them once, and it was – “
“But we didn’t hate each other then,” Potter repeated stubbornly.
Shivers ran down Harry's entire body, his brain going fuzzy at the thought. "Let you?"
"Um, I'll leave you to it,” she said, her voice a higher pitch than it usually was. She inched closer to the door, a fake smile plastered on her face. “If you decide to come, great, if not, also great. Right. Bye, Harry!”
Draco felt like crying as he scrutinized his reflection.
“I really like you,” Harry said suddenly.
“God, forget that, just fuck me,” Harry panted, releasing him. “Please. I need it.”
Harry wiped his forehead. “Thank Merlin.”
Pansy groaned and hid her face behind her hands.
“Right.”
Draco stared at his reflection with dead eyes, glowering as he focused on his swollen cheeks, the bags under his eyes, and his pale skin. It was nearly laughable just how similar this Draco was to the one of sixth year, in the midst of his mission.
“Yes,” said Draco slowly, “But he won’t be able to speak with her until Monday. I admit I’m rather…concerned for Potter. I don’t want whatever’s happened to derail his recovery.”
“Next week.”
He retrieved the patient’s files from the nightstand and skimmed over them. Bill Douglas was apparently brought in by his coworker at the Ministry at 11:48 am when he’d noticed Douglas turning a slight purple color.
Ginny accepted this with grace, though he could tell she wanted to know.
“I’ve been well,” said Malfoy, and then he went on to speak about his past week at St. Mungo’s.
Is there a bigger heartbreak than waking up to no drugs? :(
Draco huffed out a laugh. “Don’t even worry about it. I wasn’t going to be doing anything.”
They were sitting and enjoying each other’s company when something occurred to Draco.
“Yeah,” Harry agreed, though he rather liked the pointiness.
“Great. Thank you, Cait,” Kathy said as they all blinked to familiarize themselves once more with the harsh lighting.
“The one and only,” Draco said bitterly, and finally sat down in the chair across from Ira. He slumped in his seat and pressed a hand to his face. “What the fuck am I meant to do, Ira?”
And then Draco realized his sleeve was still rolled up, and that Harry’s hand was on Draco’s arm, and his Mark was out in the open, just a few inches away from Harry’s fingertips. Horror washed over him, amplified because of how empty he had been feeling just moments before, and he wondered if Harry had seen it, but he must have; how could someone miss something so glaringly obvious.
“Excellent,” Malfoy said in a voice nicer than Harry had ever heard it. “I'll reach out to Dr. Wolff today and schedule an appointment for you. When would you like it to be?”
“Harry,” Draco hissed uncertainly. Would it be safe to touch him? “Harry, wake up.”
Draco regarded Potter for a moment and weighed the pros and cons of his idea.
“And I don’t know about you, but I still had a good night.”
Draco opened his mouth to respond but instead woke up to the pitch black of his room.
It took him a few times, but Draco managed to write a response. ‘Because he was my patient.’
Harry grimaced at Hermione. “Sorry. Will you be able to Apparate?”
Draco responded by raising his mug.
“It’s all right,” said Draco. “Compared to the rest of that year, getting sliced up in the toilets was nothing.”
Draco blinked. It was hard enough to follow Harry’s ramble, but he had no earthly idea what that last part was supposed to be.
“It was only – I mean – “
“What do you do?”
Now, surrounded only by waning daylight, his empty room, and the soft sounds of Mulder and Scully in the background, Harry was left alone with his thoughts.
“You can mention alcohol around me, Ron,” Harry mumbled. “It’s not like I forget about it when you’re talking about other things.”
He shut his eyes again, marveling at his rotten luck, but also half-relieved that Potter was talking to him again.
Draco rolled his eyes and smiled the slightest amount. “Eloquent as ever. Now, can we continue?”
He glanced cautiously at Leo. He didn’t seem mad.
Draco knocked on the closed door of Ira’s office and heard their “come in!” a second later. He turned the knob and stuck his head in. Ira was sat at their desk, furiously scribbling on parchment.
“What, Potter?” His voice didn’t have the bite it used to. It took too much effort, truthfully.
“Harry,” Hermione whispered as she approached.
Betty nodded. “I’ve already finishing my morning rounds. Someone was just admitted though. Leo is taking care of him right now, but I thought you should know, Healer Malfoy. It was an involuntary poisoning, but the patient is stabilized.”
“Christ, Harry,” Samuel’s eyes sparkled. “I can hardly believe it.”
Draco thought he had an idea; it was probably similar to how much he wanted Harry.
Draco shook his head no.
“You said…that you'd gone to see Wolff before,” Potter said then, his voice causal but his mouth pulled into a nervous frown.
wanted to be one, per se, but it had been a goal of mine for quite a few years. I’ve always liked potions, and puzzles as well, and both factor into Healing,” Malfoy said. He paused, following Harry’s gaze and watching the ice swirling in Harry’s glass as well. “But I only began to think seriously about it when I went back to Hogwarts after the – the War. There aren’t many career options for former Death Eaters, I’ll tell you that much,” said Malfoy wryly. “Did you know it was McGonagall who really pushed me into pursing Healing?”
She beamed at them again and waved them away. “Go on, then.”
“He’s an old House Elf who’s been serving one of the oldest Pureblood families out there, Harry. Do you expect him to
Draco stood and went over to the full-body mirror that hung on the side of his wardrobe. He’d brought it from home and studied it every day.
Draco pushed into Harry some more, somehow aggressive and gentle at the same time. They were nestled on Harry’s couch, surrounded by blankets and pillows (courtesy of Molly), Harry happily molding himself into whatever position Draco wanted to be in. It was absurd but this seemed
“Right,” Harry said. “Come in.”
Harry didn’t seem quite like himself, whether it was because of the snow or because his friends weren’t here for Christmas or...maybe he wasn’t fine with Draco being gay after all.
Craved it.
“Just keep going. Talk –
“Oh.” Betty looked around in surprise. “Has Healer Estrada gone already?”
“Relax, Potter,” Draco scoffed. “You’re not that special.”
“Right, Draco…why that group? A…Muggle one?”
Draco knew Harry could find him anywhere (though he still didn’t know how Harry managed to do so), but he made his way to the lake after revising with Pansy and Blaise in the library. Draco sat himself down and pulled out a cigarette.
“Let me check.”
“Wait, is this the first you’ve heard from him since, what, last year?”
And then he caught Leo and Betty staring at the two of them. With a panic, Draco turned to Ira and asked, “How loudly was I speaking just then?”
I’m your superior, which means I am ultimately and unfortunately responsible for you.”
interesting.”
“I suppose,” Draco said, thinking on it for a moment, chewing his food politely. “Though it’s not saying much, since I’m sure he’s witnessed his fair share of er, shall we say – unconventional love. This
“Merlin, this isn’t going to work.” Ginny sighed as if Harry's uncharacteristic thanks was the breaking point. She turned to Zabini. “Sorry, I think you’ll have to leave.”
She didn’t ask it cruelly; she merely asked it. Draco looked over at Astoria in surprise, and she looked back at him evenly. Damn the
“And how are you, Harry? How has the past week treated you?”
“Some coward hexed me. Nothing life-threatening, so don’t worry your big head about it,” Draco added at the look on Potter’s face.
“Loud enough,” answered Leo helpfully.
“I’m sure Snape’d be glad balance has been restored.”
“Alright,” Harry responded.
, in fact, read Skeeter’s biography on you, though with a grain of salt. I tried to find material that was objective as possible, though, considering it’s journalism, objectivity is impossible. Still, I managed to find some illuminating information.”
Had to use a common Drarry trope to get the ball rolling, but I'm glad I can finally post a new chapter.

mentally ill – Draco took it all in stride and comforted Harry without being patronizing, something that merited an award in Harry’s humble opinion.
in there) and hospital robes and went to the bathroom. It was small, predictably, with a shower, sink, mirror, and toilet. Harry put the items down on the closed toilet and started by peeling off his shirt (how many days had he been wearing it?).
how important it is for this case in particular.”
“I’d like you to.”
“You must be new – I don’t think I’ve ever seen you here before.”
Draco glared at her.
“You alright, Malfoy?” Potter asked lightly as if this was all incredibly normal.
Harry made an incoherent noise as he pulled back to undo the clasp at Draco’s throat.
“Neither am I,” Harry repeated, though his voice was much huskier than it had been. He licked his lips and swallowed, Draco watched his Adam’s apple move as he did so. “God, Draco, you don’t know how much I want you. It’s driving me mental.”
“No, no, I was awake. Just…barely,” Draco admitted.
“See?” she mouthed.
“It does.” The smile looked more natural now. Harry reached over to touch the scarf; Draco shivered despite himself. “This is the closest we’ll ever get to a Gryffindor Draco Malfoy.”
He certainly wasn’t strong enough to walk all the way back to his flat. He didn’t have his wand, and he didn’t have any money. He was totally and unequivocally stuck. The panic was really starting to set in now; Harry cursed aloud. If only he’d brought his mobile. Then he could reach out to someone, anyone…
"The patient is Harry Potter."
Harry grimaced. “Not yet. I’ve just, er, got to figure out a way to tell them.”
"That's rude, Malfoy," Harry replied smoothly, watching Draco’s face as he quickened his pace. "I'm a Leo. Did you know, Leos and Geminis are sexually compatible?"
Though it was no longer the topic of conversation, Harry was still thinking about how Malfoy was supposedly gay. There were a lot of reasons that this supposed fact was so interesting. 1) How did he not know? 2) Really, after all those years in Hogwarts together. 3) Malfoy’s treatment towards him during their childhoods was a little more understandable. 4) Did Malfoy used to fancy him? 5) Did he used to fancy Malfoy? 6) Malfoy was, admittedly, extremely attractive in an annoying way.
“It just as easily could’ve been me putting him in the hospital that day,” Draco said firmly. “And I’ve hurt him countless other times as well.”
spend the night together, so why should they? I think it’s because it’s you. They still don’t trust you. I mean, if it was Ginny, they’d just be happy to know it was going fine and leave us alone.”
He swallowed thickly, wet his lips.
"What do you mean, what am I going to do? Nothing. That's what. The prat's still my Healer, so I'll just have to ignore him until I can leave."
But Harry was obviously fine with being seen with Draco, and that helped Draco be less anxious about it.
Conversation flowed easily between them, going from work to hobbies to heated debates between English and American things and back to work. Draco had always liked going out with his coworkers because it allowed him to see a different side of them. You could never know someone purely from their work persona. Ever since he’d first been invited out by Ira, he’d been amused by what he could learn when his coworkers had gotten a bit of alcohol in them.
Harry took another pull, long and deep, and Draco took the opportunity to admire his beauty. Draco was enraptured by his long neck, his Adam’s apple bobbing up and down with every drink. His eyes were closed, face less scrunched up than it was during the last two pulls. Harry pulled the bottle away with a little cough and his eyes opened, startling green and gazing straight at Draco.
Harry racked his brain and realized that yes, he did in fact tell Draco that, though it wasn’t in group.
Harry rolled his eyes impatiently and continued speaking, "- and I got jealous and so, y'know, I stopped talking to him and Malfoy just snapped and kept being a complete git until I just told him. That I think I fancy him, and he just acted - strange and tried to Healer his way out of it but that was yesterday and I haven't seen or talked to him since."
Draco agreed distractedly and left Scarlett’s office. He
“He’s still in the shower,” Ginny shot him an impish smile.
"I dunno," Harry said again.
“Yeah, why wouldn’t I be?”
Draco covered up his embarrassment by pretending to study his notes, though his loopy script was barely legible. It was a wonder how much energy taking notes consumed.
Malfoy turned his chin up infinitesimally. Harry nearly smiled.
“You’re not bad,” Potter nearly growled. “You were put in difficult situations and forced to do difficult things. It was all out of your control.”
a Death Eater," Harry reminded him. "And it wasn't your choice."
The offending arsehole was smiling at him, and it annoyed Draco even more.
“So,” Potter began impatiently, scratching the back of his head and making his hair stick up more, “So what are you saying?”
Harry nearly sighed in relief. “I’m fine, Gin.”
“Wait, could I invite one more?” Cait asked.
“That must be it.” She sighed again. “What an awful subject.”
Potter stopped and regarded Draco with wary eyes and crossed arms. He moved slowly to the side of the bed closest to Draco and sat down. From the close distance, Draco could easily see the heavy bags under Potter’s eyes.
“Ugh,” he said, and pulled away from Harry. “That’s disgusting. Come on, we’ve got to shower.”
“How could I not?” Draco scoffed. “You scared the living daylights out of me. I’d have nightmares of your disembodied head for days.”
“Wow,” Harry said for lack of a better word. He closed his eyes, trying to focus on the conversation and not his intense heartbeat. He opened them again and regarded Estrada. “How old are you?”
“Yes, well, I asked first.” He took another pull.
Harry tossed it on the floor.
“Ha – Harry!” she gasped between loud laughs. “
“They’re not his,” Draco said evenly, “They’re mine.”
“Are you...alright?”
“It’s…complicated,” Draco admitted. “The –“
“That was weak.”
"Bloody hell," Ginny said, her eyes widening. "So they've already...had at it, then?"
When Draco and Ira arrived back to the Plant and Potions Department, they bumped into Betty almost immediately.
Draco struggled with this information. “Why me?”
Harry flushed, suddenly remembering where he was and grateful that Kathy had stepped in before he finished his sentence. Although, what did the others think he would end his sentence with? The possibilities were endless – and all of them had the chance of being incredibly disrespectful.
I’ve got the pressure of starting anew – how will I make this year better? Will I hold myself accountable to my own impossible standards again? What new challenges are waiting for me? Will I be just as anxious and miserable and scared this year as I was last year? So, erm…yeah.”
“That’s wonderful, mate,” Samuel said. “I can tell they mean a lot to you – this is the happiest I’ve ever seen you. I know I barely know you so it can’t really mean much, but still.”
“My childhood isn’t what everything thinks,” Harry said after what seemed like minutes of silence. He was staring at a patch of dirt a foot away from him. “I didn’t have friends. I couldn’t, really, since my cousin, Dudley, made sure everyone at school hated me. He and his friends bullied me all the time. It got better once I found out I was a wizard, but before Hogwarts…”
When he put the glasses back on, Malfoy came into focus. His expression was strangely soft as he looked up at Harry from his desk.
Harry grimaced at her as he stood up, stretching out his back. They’d been lazing around Harry’s flat the whole day, much like they did most days. Harry still hadn’t finished that ‘list’ for Wolff, and that appointment had already been three days ago.
“Nah – well, maybe,” Harry thought for a moment. “But Dreamless Sleep was really the one that did it for me.”
The zipped themselves up and exited the stall, Malfoy in the lead. Malfoy washed his hands, his face steady as Harry's cum swirled down the sink. Harry's entire body felt hot as he mirrored Malfoy, washing his hands as well. When they were done, Malfoy opened the bathroom door and made to leave when they were ambushed by Cait.
"It is no problem," she said and cocked her head. "And how are you, Draco? Are you doing well?"
“Alright. Let’s get started.”
“All right, thanks, Mrs. Weasley,” Harry said.
he had to get better. Otherwise this would all be for nothing – being trapped in this room, having his friends see him like this, talking to bloody Malfoy about his own fucked-up state of being. He knew, somewhere deep within, that if he didn’t see Wolff and “fix” the underlying issue, he’d go right back to supporting his addiction and wasting away. That’s what had always happened, after all.
“We’ve got to go, remember?”
“Did Pansy say something?” he pressed.
“I just want to help you, Malfoy. You look like shite,” said Potter, his green eyes boring into Draco’s. “And besides, it’d be bollocks if this is what finished you off, after everything that’s happened to you.”
“Obviously it didn’t happen overnight.”
"Nothing's wrong."
“Yeah? What am I?”
“Just two? You sure, mate?”
“No, I can’t chance it,” Potter shook his head aggressively. “I’ve been completely clean since that final step of the Cleansing thing. I can’t risk it.”
“Oh, yes! Of course. My name is Katherine,” she said, holding out a hand. “I’m a facilitator of this support group. It’s so nice to finally meet you.”
Draco felt for Potter’s pulse, his wrist cool underneath Draco’s fingers. Like Leonel had said, it was weak.
They parted, but just barely.
"Merlin," muttered Draco as he sunk further into the protection of the covers.
Draco felt his cheeks grow hot at that and hoped Harry wouldn’t notice.
White ceiling. White walls.
“Do you think she fancies Draco or something?”
He lifted himself off Harry and went to sit on the bed; Harry climbed onto it fully. He pulled the curtains closed before they resumed kissing, Draco’s heart thudding and cock pushing against his trousers.
“You’re blushing so hard, Draco, it’s adorable.”
“So what is it, then? Pity?”
“Yes.”
“Is this the greeting party then? Just you?” came Daphne’s voice from behind him.
He watched impatiently as Harry pulled off his gloves, throwing them on top of the now closed trunk. As soon as Harry was close enough, Draco reached out and ran his hands through the hair Draco was so (begrudgingly) fond of. Harry’s mouth curved into a smile as he let his school cloak fall to the floor and kicked off his shoes.
Granger’s lips quivered slightly. “That’s wonderful.”
“Oh yeah?” Harry’s eyes were bright. “After the best blowjob of your life?”
"What's wrong?" Potter asked, his voice smooth instead of gruff, like Draco was now used to.
“What? Oh.”
Potter’s mouth twitched in amusement. He released the tight grip he had on his mug and took something out of his sweatpants pocket, holding it out for Draco to see it. Draco leaned closer – it was shimmery, a fabric, maybe? And then it registered in his mind, bringing him right back to Hogwarts, and to the Hogwarts Express.
Hearing Leonel say his name in such a gentle tone sent a chill up Draco’s spine. He felt his face grow hot as he leaned against his desk. Memories of them fucking on that very same desk flashed unhelpfully through Draco’s mind.
She smiled sadly and squeezed his thigh.
“He’ll be ok,” Draco said quietly. “I’ll make sure of it.”
Harry took the bag gratefully and pocketed it, his heart pounding just at the sight of them. He passed the money over to him.
“You did, didn’t you?” Ginny asked, her voice cracking a bit. “You fucking used, didn’t you, Harry?”
“Recover?” Harry asked, voice loud and harsh.
Harry nodded, and briefly wondered if it was possible to be readier than he was right now.
Draco shook himself out of his reverie and cleared his throat; Leonel took his hand back.
Harry exhaled slowly. He closed his eyes, trying to find the words.
Harry gave a weak ‘bye’ as Draco lifted a hand; Granger and her daughter were gone with a
“He didn’t know what the spell did,” Draco replied calmly, though he was begrudgingly touched by the emotion in her voice. He sighed. “He fucked up, I know. But it was a mistake. And we both know I’ve made my fair share of those. Ones that could have killed people.”
“Fuck,” Harry breathed.
“G-God, yes.”
“Shut up, Malfoy,” he mumbled without conviction. “I’m just saying, you must be hungry.”
“No,” sighed Samuel, “But as a student, I have to take all the free food I can get.”
“You don’t believe in the meaning,” Harry said, and he placed his hand on Draco’s arm once more. Draco winced but didn’t shake him off. “I don’t think you ever really did. I’m not defending Voldemort, Draco, I’m defending you. It
It was Ginny. Harry smiled at her.
“Fine,” he said. “You?”
Harry’s heart constricted in his chest. "I miss them too."
Malfoy took it. “You’re Samuel.”
“It’s not that big of a deal. I can – I can handle it. Everyone has nightmares.”
“Harry-“
"I don't...not since the last time Hermione and Ron tried to get me to stop. I only made it a few days..."
What about micro ) size kink where in Merlin decides to shrink Arthur to protect him as a last minute decision but starts to become filled of thoghts about what he could do to his helpless king whilst he's like this mabye Arthur could be quite scared Merlin can feel him trembling in his hands as well but nothing were Merlin really wants to hurt him. Maybe vore comes into it but if so not fatal maybe he could use magic keep him safe. Mainly I'd like to just see Merlin Turing Arthur small and becoming obsessed with Tiny sacred Arthur and not wanting to turn him back.
The boys arrived at the location for their new video shooting for a little outdoor home concert on Youtube. They have been planning that video for weeks with the team and are so excited for this day. When they arrive at the location tho something seems off. Namjoon is the first to get out of the car and its clear that something is not right. There is nobody around at the big forest. He turns around as the other band members get out of the car. He shots them a worried look. Yoongi walks up next to Namjoon frowning. The new driver of the car gets out of his seat and walks over to them. Before Namjoon can say anything he is faced with a gun pointed at his head. Yoongi turns to the driver to ask him if he maybe he just got the wrong address or drove to the wrong part of the forest when he sees the gun pointed at the band leader. He acts quickly without thinking pushing Namjoon to the side as he protectively steps in front of the gun shielding the other members who start to look worried. The man before them chuckles slightly as he puts a finger on the trigger of the gun. “What do you want?” Namjoon asks in Korean slightly trembling voice but still very calm and polite tone. The new driver has only been there for a week yet, he is an American Korean who just recently moved to Seoul. He looks at the half Korean man that now points the gun and Yoongi. “ I am sure we can work this out like civilized people. If its money you want we can call the agency right now so you can tell them your conditions. There is no need for violence! We will be cooperating with you so please put down the gun.” The other members try not to panic to much as they stare at the scene before them. The man laughs dryly as he looks directly at Namjoon. “I have enough money… that is not the reason for this. Actually I get payed quite well for delivering you guys here.” Namjoon freezes as he hears approaching footsteps. Before he can turn around tho he feels the barrel of a shotgun pressed to his head from behind. The gasping sound from the other band members tells him that the same just happened to them. “All of you put your hands over your head and turn around slowly!” a male voice states in English. Namjoon repeats the sentence for the others in Korean and all of them do as the are told. A team of 14 armed Americans face the 7 members. Every member now has one man in front  of them while the barrel of a shotgun is pressed to their backs by another one. They silently follow their captors into the forest. Namjoon shots Yoongi a warning look as he can see anger building up in the though rapper. He slightly shakes his head symbolizing his friend not to make trouble and stay put. Taehyung tries to turn around to find Yoongis gaze but the man behind him slaps him with the barrel of the shotgun hard telling him to keep walking. They follow the group to a clearing in the forest where a big house is located. The 7 boys silently walk inside the building where they are lead downstairs to a big room. There are 7 beds in the room that actually look pretty clean but what makes the members gasp in surprise is not the nice silky bed sheets or the comfortable looking pillows but the massive iron shackles attached to the ground next to ever bed. Every member gets led to one of the beds. “Take of your clothes!” A blonde man instructs the boys. And Namjoons eyes wide in shock. Yoongi glares at the man while Jimin and Jungkook yelp in surprise. Seokjin looked confused so did Hoseok. Namjoon saw Yoongi move and tried to stop the rapper but he wasn’t fast enough Yoongi crushed his body against the blonde man and threw a hard blow to his chin. Immidiatly all the guns and shotguns were pointed at Yoongi who angrily yelled at the blonde man who just chuckled as he punched Yoongi hard. “I said take off those damn clothes! Right now or dear Suga will have a bullet inside his skull. We can test how bulletproof he is right now!” He said as he hold his gun to Yoongis head while licking away some blood trickling down his chin. Namjoon repeated the order in Korean voice shaking now. The members stared at their captors with wide eyes. “Don’t…” Yoongi said while turning around too look at his Hyungs. BANG. A loud scream echoed the walls as Yoongi fell to the ground. The blonde man had fired his gun shooting Yoongi into his knee. “Don’t make me repeat myself! The next bullet will end him!” The blonde man said coldly pointing the gun he just fired at Yoongis head again. “ Not so brave anymore huh?” He chuckled at the boy on the ground. Namjoon could only watch in horror as the boys around him reacted with gasps screams and trembeling. Jungkook tried to run over to his Hyung but stopped in his tracks as he was hit by the man next to him. Namjoon couldn’t believe the words that left his lips when he told his fellow band members to take of their clothes, a single tear running down his cheek as he looked at Yoongi on the ground.
“Sort of.”
The table erupted into giggles again, and I assumed the duo were known for some epic fights.
I mean, Lucius wasn’t just a follower. He
First, my apologies.
I couldn’t have even told you what I was watching.
I nodded.
“Honestly, Potter,” I chided, leaning towards him to kiss him just above the ear. “I hope you’d expect me to treat you better than that….”
“She was a receptionist,” I added, unsure as to whether or not Williams had seen that anywhere in her journals. “So I don’t think we’ll be able to investigate anything until Monday, which will give us the weekend to go over the file Michaels sends tomorrow.”
“What are you
Malfoy stepped one foot between my own, forcing me to rock back onto my heels, one strong arm sliding around my waist, the other stroking up to cradle the back of my head so that I was completely supported by Malfoy.
I lowered myself onto him again, my hole opening easily around him thanks to the solid fucking that dildo had given me earlier.
“Someone’s a tad obsessed with this song, I’d say,” I replied, eyes narrowing as I noticed the lightning-quick glance Pansy and Blaise both had shot at Draco.

But this was my first time
“Because Draco’s being an arse and magicked away the prices because he’s not letting anyone pay for anything,” Micah piped up, shooting a vicious mock-glare in Draco’s direction.
“Well, to answer your question,” she began, leading us down the corridor towards Department Head Bones’ office.
when I’d warned him how strong it was and had continued to down shots like they were candy.
“I’d imagine they’re both wonderful,” I conceded, studying the two descriptions on the menu. “But maybe go with the Tropical Tincture. We can share, and mine is already lemony.”
Most people didn’t realise, even though they could grasp the sense of a place easily enough, and I often chuckled to myself when people said things like:
… to…
“So,” Hermione continued, clearly trying to make Tristan feel at ease. “Any plans to see our boy Harry again anytime soon?”
“What’s that?” I asked, using the spoon to mix my rice and egg together, my mouth watering as the aroma of the soy sauce and pickles reached my nose despite the unappetising mush of yellow and white in the bowl before me.
“Potter,” he spat out, leaning his left hip against the vanity, arms crossing in front of him, eyes narrowing to a positively frightful glare.
In this memory, Harry was
His big blue eyes were filled with tears threatening to spill over, and his little lip was quivering dangerously.
“I mean, am I a terrible Muggle if I say go for it?” Micah encouraged. “He’s not taking a fucking hint and being a skeevy gross perv and also, I kinda want to see what this tripping hex looks like….”
“Well, we’ve… erm… kissed, and… erm,”
I went and “killed” him off early on then became somewhat obsessed with the idea of Lucius simmering quietly and powerless in a corner somewhere watching Draco fall madly in love with Harry, so… he’s back.
“Or a Russian one…” he continued. “They’re more like a crepe, really.”
kissing. “What is it, Harry?” I murmured. “What is it my Harry wants?”
Potter merely groaned, and his eyes snapped open, staring at me with an almost frantic look.
Then we sat at the bar, waiting and watching, as the crowd in the bar continued to swarm around Harry and Draco.
“No,” Harry protested. “You’re not.”

How was that even possible? What could he possibly mean?

stayed, smiling and saying silly nonsense to each other, until Lily, James, Sirius, and Lupin all faded away and Harry turned and collapsed into my arms, sobbing.
“Anyway, if this person
“So, how do I measure up?” I teased, leaning closer to him.
We both worked in the Department of Mysteries, in the Thought Room. Hermione had transferred from the Time Room a few months earlier, and, after a few weeks of professional awkwardness, had developed a genuine relationship.
Harry opened his mouth to argue but Blaise reached out a hand, as though about to cover Harry’s mouth.
“Well,” she returned to business just as quickly as she’d left, flinging open the doors to the room.
Saviour of the Wizarding World.
Shit, I realised with a gasp, glancing over at Blaise to see if he’d come to the same realisation I had.
“And lube for you,” another vial landed in front of Pansy.
“How did you find this place?” Harry asked, chewing on a mini brioche stuffed with salmon, soft cheese, and arugula. “It’s bloody top.”
He was over for our usual Saturday tea but looked as though he’d just woke up.

“Yeah, he was great,” I admitted. “Why? Want to hang out again?”

I shook my head and turned my attention back to the meal sitting before me and followed the others in piling food onto my plate.
“Hi,” I murmured back, still staring up at him as one of his hands slid down to rest at the base of my spine, lodged just beneath my still-bound hands, the other stroking upwards to hold the nape of my neck, both drawing me closer.

Our sensitive, little dragon was a wee bit upset, it would appear.
She seemed to have just noticed the cauldron simmering on the stove.
“You probably don’t want to know,” Ginny replied with a laugh as we all turned and began walking back towards the Burrow. “Malfoy’s got quite the mouth on him.”
“Pulling blokes,” Ron answered for me, smirking. “Then complaining they don’t measure up to his standards.”
“I suppose you two ought to be thanking some deity or other that he’s not.”
“Getting comfortable,” I replied, rising up to a kneeling position so that my hips were in line with his face.
Later, as Harry impressively licked the last of his treacle tart from his spoon, sighing happily beside me, he grinned up at me.
Never really been to an un-fancy dinner party, either, unless the extremely laid-back affairs at Ron and Hermione’s
“I’m about to give up what

He had a definite shadow growing on his face and his hair was even more rumpled than usual, letting me know that Harry probably hadn’t been home last night.
sat staring back at me, all cheerfully grinning with far too much pink in their cheeks to be remotely sober.
Harry snorted some of his tea out of his nose and took a moment to compose himself before responding.
I didn’t respond, just tugged gently on the cord, watching, mesmerised, as Harry’s pink pucker clenched, then slowly gave way, the black ball pushing out obscenely, and I couldn’t help but stop pulling with it halfway out, groaning and tracing around the stretched-out rim with the tip of my tongue, deciding to give the sensitive ring another delicate swirl at Harry’s moan.
“I’m so fucking late,” I continued, dashing into my closet and grabbing a suit, shirt, and tie and, literally, throwing them on.
Ha, look at me, figuring this British slang out.
“Erm, would anyone else like more coffee or tea?”
Draco reached out and gently placed his index finger under Alfie’s chin, urging my child’s attention back towards him.
desires the most in the entire world, so it could be a dream, or goal, yes, but it could also just be a longing or lovesick desire. Actual dreams and goals are more linked to the brain and so they can be controlled a bit more by the individual.”
“Unfortunately, I fear I’m probably not even half as interesting as either of them,” Harry replied ruefully, selecting his own square of pastry and lifting it to his lips.
“Sorry, Hermione,” he apologised as he came stumbling through our office door, almost tripping in his haste to get to his desk, managing to look clumsy, even, as he wriggled out of his coat and sat down.
“Mm-hmm,” Draco replied as we mounted the wide stone step that made up the entry platform. “Is everything alright?”
“He’s not here, I’ve already checked,” he replied, eyes scanning the pub once more. “But it
in America.”
Hermione, Harry, Ginny, Micah, and I followed suit, but then I saw the look Blaise shot me, and the two of us lingered nearby.
“Well, then, this app would certainly make sure you don’t ever encounter a similar situation ever again,” Hermione assured me with a knowing smile that made me shift my glare to her and steal another sandwich from Ron.
Then again, I knew Harry was an orphan, and that Molly was the closest thing he had to a living mother, so maybe that was part of it.
When we’d parted, I’d told him it’d be a couple of months and that I wouldn’t be a Gryffindor, whatever the hell that meant.
“Did you imagine it sliding into that pretty, pink pucker of yours, spreading you wide open?”
“Glad to help correct that.”
After putting in our order, Harry and I strolled towards the Canal Saint-Martin, sipping on their signature Pink Flamingo beers, the bright pink balloon that would alert our delivery moped to our location clutched tightly in Harry’s right hand.
I could only groan again in response and I reached down to wrap my hand around my own leaking cock.
What in Merlin’s fucking beard was she talking about?
I just about murdered Harry when he merely glanced over at me, one brow raised.
Our server, Anne, rushed over to help him up, and he all but sprinted, not giving a second glance behind him.
and next second, a frail old man appeared, a joyous smile stretched across his bony face as he crossed the room, arms held wide.
Once the protection shield was up, the three of us gathered in the centre, wands raised, Mum and I following Fleur’s lead as the ceremony officially began, calling first for Air and the knowledge and renewal it represented.
I chuckled to myself as four little glass jars came flying at me.
“Yeah, however, that method doesn’t actually seem to be working, Harry,” I informed him, laughing again. “What are you worried about, anyway? Think there’s a chance he doesn’t like you? I mean, I don’t know… you’re fit and interesting, even without the wizarding part.”
But it never came.
hard to admit that I didn’t want to be mean anymore, and then I had to kind of work at it, so… I was
“Ended up on the right side, and all?”
“That was pretty extreme,” I admitted, downing the remainder of my pint, because, fuck, my cousin had pretty much just informed me that his kids were wizards.
He could have just found me a goddamned avocado and a plain old regular egg, and I would have been ecstatic.
“I changed my mind. Open me up, quickly, please… I need you now.”
“I’m so glad you and Draco finally figured it out,” she said, leaning forward to hug Harry and smiling over at me.
“Oh, bless your sweet little heart,” the woman replied, not seeming to have caught Violet’s slight.
I swallowed around him again, just for the satisfaction of hearing him groan, before hollowing my cheeks and sliding back up, popping him from my pursed lips with a smacking noise, tongue reaching out to lick gently at the delicate crease where Malfoy’s thick head connected to his shaft.
Harry
Draco about it?” Ginny asked.
The one I wasn’t sure if I liked or not.
The question was when?
I allowed myself a smirk in Draco’s direction and felt relief as the glacial coldness in Draco’s eyes began to thaw and he allowed himself a brief abashed chuckle and shifted his gaze to stare out at the hedge maze again.
She punctuated her sentence by having the platter of sandwiches set down with a resounding thud in the centre of the table.
“I suppose I meant
“Fuck, Draco,” Harry sighed, still holding me close, refusing to unwrap his arms or legs from me. “Where do you even come up with these ideas?”
“Draco, you
“Where is the…”
“Because… she’s Granger. And she can,” I said finally.
“Don’t deserve anything from you, Draco,” he replied, burying his head in the crook of my neck.
“Don’t want to share you. With anyone,” I clarified, lifting my face to look into his eyes, summoning every goddamned millilitre of my famed “Gryffindor” courage to do so.
“I have to be more honest with them,” Harry answered, shoving his hands into his pockets. “And I feel like this is a good starting point.”
“Good,” Malfoy muttered to himself. Harry watched, mind hazy and unable to cooperate as Malfoy wrote on his papers. He returned his attention to Harry. “Your vital signs are improving. Would you like some water?”
“Yeah, I did.”
“Harry,” Draco nearly moaned.
“No, Potter, I don’t think you care about me,” Draco finally said. “And I don’t see how that could be a surprise.”
Draco didn’t think he could ever understand Gryffindors.
“Known what?”
“Was this at your mother’s house?”
“Well, I
Betty flushed even deeper. “Thank you, sir. I really hope so.”
Ira rolled their eyes good-naturedly.
“Angry,” he said. “I’m no stranger to feeling angry,” he gave a short laugh at that, “But I’d still rather not…it just makes me feel like I’m fifteen again and that was, er, not the best year of my life. But – er, what I meant to say is, sorry if I’m being short with you or anyone else – I don’t mean to be a git. I just am, sometimes.”
“So…so how long have you known that you liked blokes?” Harry asked softly. When Draco hesitated, he added, “You don’t have to tell me.”
“But I
“Hermione told me, Harry –“
“You’re really obsessed with that, aren’t you?”
The world was still spinning, albeit less so now, and all Draco really wanted was to lie down. He felt like absolute rubbish; his entire body was aching and he knew that he would only feel worse tomorrow morning, which didn’t improve his already low spirits.
“She’s just being protective. It’s fine, Draco,” he said reassuringly, putting a hand on Draco’s arm.
“No, Harry,” Wolff said. “I take patient confidentiality very seriously and I will only repeat what you’ve said if you are intending to hurt yourself or someone else.”
I made two changes - Pansy's friends with Padma, not Parvati, and I pushed the timeline forward a week after Draco and Harry began their relationship. It felt weird to have all this drama and then another two and a half weeks of school. So nothing too major.
Draco knocked back the last of his drink, and decided that he wanted some fresh air. There were too many people here and he was sure too many of them hated him. He wondered if the Room of Hidden Things could produce windows or balconies or anything of the like, and then he saw a door appear across the room.
Harry shook himself out of his thoughts.
“We did it,” Harry said.
you, Draco. It wasn’t just my fucking addiction brain making things up, either. I look at you now and I’m a hundred percent sure that I like you, I want to be around you, I want to snog you, I want to do a thousand other things with you, and from what I’ve seen, I think you want the same with me.”
“I don’t believe you, Harry,” Draco said, and his heart ached as they looked at each other.
Ginny sat back down.
Draco's cheeks colored as Harry raised an eyebrow.
Draco regained consciousness from the floor, Potter’s voice slowly coming back to full volume. He felt strange and sick, and Potter was kneeling in front of him, his eyes almost comically wide.
If Draco was being honest, there really wasn’t much to do.
He trailed off as a waitress approached them. After she’d introduced herself and taken their drink orders (water for Harry, decaffeinated coffee for Draco), she left and they were alone once again.
Draco brought the cigarette to his lips with his free hand, eyes on Potter as he breathed in.
“Do you know for certain that she’s not in the country?” Mitchell crossed her arms.
“Of course, Healer Malfoy,” Burke said. “Erm, I brought a sedative. Should I administer it?”
“What happened afterwards?”
“I’ve been clean for over a month,” Potter hissed under his breath, suddenly angry and leaning closer to Draco over the table.
“I can’t believe – have you ever even seen them?”
Draco laughed – he had to – at the absurdity of it all. Potter had somehow tricked Draco into thinking it was
“I know,” Draco said, and left it at that.
“I’m sorry,” Harry said feebly. “I don’t know why – I just get so angry sometimes.”
was.”
"With someone who's also in group."
Harry couldn't help the moan from escaping his lips even if he'd wanted to. He clutched the sheets tightly, his left cheek pressed flush against the bed.
“I’m fine,” he lied and he reached for the whisky again. This time, Harry didn’t stop him, and he took several large gulps. He put the bottle down, gasping for breath and savoring the burn down his throat.
Harry stared at him in the moonlight; it reflected from his nearly white hair and hungry eyes. His cheekbones were more prominent than usual, the lights casting elegant shadows across his face. His lips were slightly parted, and Harry wanted to know what they tasted like tonight.
, “Or a child.” He looked pointedly at the four Star Wars tapes.
“Nothing you talked about over in – y’know.”
Draco stared down at Potter’s hand, and felt Leonel’s eyes on it too. After a few more moments, there was a twitch of movement in Potter’s index finger. Leonel glanced at Draco with wide eyes.
“Do you have lube?”
Harry almost believed him.
“Right, I’m still a bit hung up on how our favorite young bachelor is now shacking up with our favorite reformed Death Eater,” said Ginny.
“You’re right,” Harry said, sitting up with a smile. He looked down at himself, partially covered by blankets. “I need clothes.”
know, so you can look back and say, ‘oh, it's possible that I fancied Malfoy,’” she said, doing a passable imitation of his voice.
“No, there’s theory behind it all. That’s what’s interesting.”
"How long has it been?"
Hermione’s and Ron’s attitudes were much better than they were on Saturday, and Harry was beyond grateful. They were perfectly civil with Draco, even making light conversation and jokes. Draco asked about Hermione’s work, and she seemed pleased to be able to talk about it with someone other than Ron or Harry, who weren’t really into the specifics of it all.
“No, of course not. We
Draco was momentarily stunned. “Really?” he asked when he’d collected himself.
Harry blinked as he and Ginny appeared in his flat.
“Draco…”
“I hate it, Hermione thinks-“ Potter stopped himself abruptly. Draco looked over. His hair was mussed – he must have been running his hand through it. “Anyway, er, sorry. Pissed.”
“Oh, come on, Harry, you’re not that daft,” Ginny rolled her eyes. “It has everything to do with now. Some part of you has
“We can watch something.” Leo nodded in the direction of the television.
Not about his appointment with Wolff, of course. He was actually sort of…
He grabbed the front of Leonel’s shirt and pulled him down, their mouths crashing together roughly and without grace. By now, Leonel was exploring every inch of Draco, his fingers brushing over the denim covering Draco's hard cock. Draco moaned, the noise caught in their fervent kisses, and Leonel worked on unbuttoning and unzipping Draco’s trousers.
Astoria looked surprised, like she’d never expect Draco to want to tell her anything. She nodded politely, however, and watched him from where she sat on his bed.
Both men cursed under their breath, Draco standing up and retreating a good few paces away from Harry, who was hurriedly pulling his sweatpants back on. Harry was reaching for his shirt when a very pregnant Hermione Granger-Weasley walked into the living room, a small, ginger girl in tow.
Draco frowned at him.
and am useless to you if you won’t talk me, so stop being a coward and tell me what’s happened!”
He hadn’t fought with her in ages. He thought the last time they argued was during sixth year, when she tried to get him to tell her what he was doing. He refused, she got frustrated, and he got frustrated in return.
No, no. It wasn’t possible. Potter was presumably on his way to St. Mungo’s. He wanted help, right?
The rest had already left the room. Malfoy raised an eyebrow. Why was he so beautiful?
“It’s from before he left.”
He took a deep breath. No, he was
“Sorry – I’m not in the best of moods today,” he said quietly when he had put them back on.
“She’d be a Slytherin,” Harry mumbled to himself.
“I was drunk,” said Potter with a frown.
Kathy moved onto someone else. Harry looked down in his lap and took a deep breath. Hardest part is over, apparently. His hands were curled into tight fists, he noticed, and he made an effort to relax them.
The corners of Malfoy’s mouth turned up. “That’s very kind of you, Potter, but I assure you that I’m perfectly content with water.”
Draco blanched, feeling cold wash over him. Potter watched him as he exhaled shakily.
“A good starting point?” Draco asked faintly. He began walking again; Harry quickly followed. “They’ll think you’ve gone absolutely mad. They leave you alone with me for three weeks and suddenly you’re into blokes and dating me?”
It was repulsive. Yes, it
“Christ,” he panted. “Didn’t you ever hear of easing into it?”
His empty stomach churning, he wiped his mouth and hung at the edge of his bed, unwilling to show his face to any of the five people in the room. His weak gasps of breath came ragged and irregular and his chest moved with them, his hands gripping the edge of the hospital bed as he stared into his vomit.
Harry's hand slipped down to his own cock and he began rubbing it vigorously. Draco was still pounding into him and it only took a few moments before Harry came with a shout, his entire body tensing as he spilled all over himself.
“I know what I’ve been missing now. Even little things, like fresh air, or being able to think without puking or sweating or my heartbeat going so fast I can feel it throughout my entire body. But I’ve also been missing you. You and Ron and Hermione and everyone else. I’ve been missing your lives and it was so bloody selfish of me, but I want to be here for it now. It finally makes sense. I want to be the friend you all deserve.”

And he called
Anaïs turned her left cheek towards me, and the light bulb finally went off in my head, and I laughed as we kissed first one cheek, then the opposite, and then I went to step back, but Anaïs turned her cheek for a third kiss.
“The fuck do you mean, Gin?” I demanded. Only three.
Draco snorted and bent down to splash his face with water.
Sad tears, because would he have, maybe, found it earlier had I stood up to Lucius and demanded a better world for my child?
“It’s, like, you have this little creature that you love more than you can even describe, and who you’d give your life for in a heartbeat, but… at the same time, you just… want to strangle it.”
I paused because I’d come so very close to saying what scared me the most.
because Draco had, apparently, not thought twice to hex a poor boy who had misread or ignored the “I’m-not-interested-so-back-off” vibe he would send their way.
“I don’t know what information you’re looking for,” Draco frowned.
He frowned.
“When did you?”
To say that I had wasted countless hours of my life playing with this particular toy would be somewhat of an understatement.
Mum, who had been smiling at us fondly, averted her gaze to seek out our server, who arrived to take our orders momentarily.
I don’t think Charlie had always been so agoraphobic concerning the Alley, but nearly two decades working in the remote Romanian countryside had made him wary of gatherings of more than a few dozen people.

, still feeling guilty for obliviating him.
Well, trying to walk into the room, but this was proving rather difficult with Harry still wrapped tightly around me, still murmuring things about me being back and how I should never leave ever again, which was nice, I’ll be honest, except for the whole trying to move
“Erm…”
Anyway.
“Oy,” I whispered, nudging at Charlie as I nodded in Harry and Draco’s direction. “How long do you reckon before those two start a family of their own?”
“What if
“I don’t want to hurt you, Draco,” Harry replied, one hand caressing my face.
“Most people seem quite pleased when I shove my wand in their face,” Blaise shot back, a bit juvenile, yes, but funny all the same.
“Thought you’d never ask,” he admitted, walking towards me, and I decided that Potter smirking was a decidedly dangerous thing.
As always, comments are appreciated!
Draco’s face softened, and he smiled sympathetically.
me? Are you fucking
“Me,” he replied. “I do. I just told you so.”
Hermione took a deep breath and looked me straight in the eye.
I could sink my teeth into it before lifting my head, still perfectly dry, out of the tub, Harry’s head popping up at exactly the same time.
Shared bowls of their famous Bo Bun and Beef Pho were, apparently, the perfect ending to our afternoon in Montmartre, despite the snot and constant nose-blowing the pho (admittedly made quite spicy by our generous additions of the house-made chilli paste) caused.

“Oh.”
I’d got rid of Voldemort when I was seventeen.
But I had held my ground regarding them being stopped, knowing damned well Kingsley could do something about it.
“Scrawny kid who would always stammer at us whenever we met up in the corridor.”
I followed Harry, Draco, and the children in, and gulped a little at the immediate hush that fell across the pub.
“The fuck are you doing to me?” he whispered, almost to himself, mouth fastening to mine once more for a slow, thorough, somehow indecent kiss that had me scrabbling up against him, legs twining even more tightly around him, begging, needing, demanding,
pranks he might have played.”
Thanks to Ginny, I had jeans that hugged my arse and showcased the muscle of my thighs and knew to wear t-shirts or button-downs that fit properly and accentuated my sleek frame. I’d had no idea what Ginny was talking about when she’d told me this at first, but I’d had ridiculous success pulling blokes, so I figured she knew what she was talking about in the clothing department.
Our surprise visitor was now staring into the cupboard, at the little mattress, wrinkled sheets, and makeshift living space Harry had carved out for himself as a child.
“Harry, Draco, Blaise… all of you! Come here!” she squealed, bouncing excitedly and gesturing us over with her hand.

Seconds later, I was also crossing the office towards Department Head Bones’ desk.
Then again, could you imagine a Muggle bloke? If I drew him towards my seemingly adequately sized en-suite, waved my hand, and let it expand to this over-indulgent, obnoxious piece of luxury?
to grasp at his mother.
to see Harry’s emerald eyes staring at me curiously.
“No.” I scowled again.
“Constant vigilance, I suppose?” I sighed as we came to a stop before the double doors leading to her personal board room.
That was a silly question to ask you.
He knew damned well my history with Kreacher.
Harry and Mum talked most of the way, the tale of little Teddy Lupin’s first week at Hogwarts not having been exhausted yet.
I realised immediately as we entered, one wall lined with colourful
Swipe left.
“Please,” I whispered, eyes dropping to his mouth, then lifting back up to meet his own.

Why in Merlin’s name would Hermione ask Harry a question like that?

“Of course.”

I barely gave Draco a second to enjoy being sheathed inside of me before I was rising up again, then down, over and over, squeezing and rocking, trying to catch that spot, eyes rolling back in my head when he finally brushed against it.
I continued to gaze up at the distinctly Parisian buildings, hand tucked firmly in Draco’s, knowing I wouldn’t need to pay attention to anything else as we traipsed our way through the gorgeous French capital.
Touching Draco was like receiving jolts of electricity, and he did it again and again. He couldn't pull himself away, his hands searching every inch of Draco, wanting to know him all of him. After so long, Harry was on the verge of desperation and his heart thudded in his ears.
He finally had a chance to get a look at Malfoy without feeling like he might pass out or burst from anger. He’d grown in the past five years and held himself with more confidence (still not quite up to par with his Hogwarts days, though). His hair was growing loosely around his pale face, and there were bags underneath his grey eyes. Malfoy met his gaze evenly.
Harry’s bad mood was bubbling up within him again; he suddenly felt very irritable and back to
“Hello Betty,” said Draco.
“Harry,” she nearly whispered. She put a hand to his clammy cheek. “It’s all right.”
He then said, “Yeah. Not that bad, though.”
“Yeah, it is,” Samuel said, a nervous smile on his face.
Luna retrieved the mango juice and poured herself an ample amount. She took a sip and sighed happily.
He looked up into Ginny Weasley’s shocked brown eyes and took in her pale face, her fiery hair, and her trembling body. He realized that he was trembling, too.
“I just needed a break,” Potter said, though he didn’t sound too sure of it himself. “I love them and all, but…it’s a lot. It’s all – everything’s a lot.”
The tension in Harry’s face and body diffused; his eyes widened slightly. He finally put his quill down.
“Harry-“
Draco took over a minute later, his fingers long and elegant as they confidently grasped the base of it. Draco slowed down in his thrusting but moved with a force that wasn’t there before – drawn out and harsh – and Harry moaned without reservation. Draco took this as approval and his eyes were shining.
“You’ll see in a bit,” Harry responded with a smile.
Malfoy and Estrada. Estrada and Malfoy. All the unspoken words, how Estrada had looked away whenever Harry asked too much about Malfoy, the way they both had said they knew each other “well.”
They lapsed into silence. It was strange. Everything was strange, but this was especially so. The uncertain positions they were all in. He and Harry were dating, but their friends had been at odds with each other for as long as they had known each other. Of course, this had been the case for the two of them as well, but they’d since crossed the line from intense dislike to intense like (Draco smiled at the thought).
“Though I don’t remember much, I’m
They were all still crowded onto one table, McGonagall at the head of it, looking slightly less rigid than usual. All around Draco were the sounds of forks and knives clanging against one another, people chewing and talking and laughing. The smell of all of it made him feel almost nauseated, which he was actually quite thankful for.
“That’s fine.”
Leonel scoffed, affronted. “I think I have enough tact to not bring up my admiration at a time like this.”
Harry took a seat in the guest chair and gazed around the office. Framed academic certificates hung on the wall, a small calendar next to them. Her wooden desk was neatly organized, a large paper calendar taking up a quarter of it.
“After we’ve completed the cleansing procedure, we’ll focus on the psychological effects of your addiction.” Malfoy said, seeming to sense that Harry was about to interrupt with a denial. “It’s nothing to be ashamed of. The Healers at St. Mungo’s are completely prepared to treat you both physically and mentally through outsourcing. There’ve been changes made in the recent years so we’re better able to treat our patients and fulfill all their needs. You are not the first to come here needing addiction treatment, Potter, and you won’t be the last.”
Malfoy just took a deep breath and took a step closer.
“It wouldn’t have helped,” Harry answered shortly. “I know what helps by now, Malfoy. I wasn’t supposed to keep using at first, and I know it was stupid of me to think I really wouldn’t, but, well. So here we are. Back where I started.”
"I'm sorry, I shouldn’t have snapped at you," Draco said when he'd finally resurfaced.
She mused at him.
"See him again, hopefully."
“No, come in,” Harry offered, and she did.
“But, um,” Draco went on, while Hermione and Ron looked at him strangely, “Thank you again, and I’ll…leave if you want me too. I wouldn’t blame you.” He finished awkwardly.
Draco slowly rested his hand on Harry’s arm again. To his relief, Harry’s body relaxed slightly at Draco’s touch, though his chest was still rising and falling unsteadily.
He was suddenly struck by the absurd thought of this perhaps being a normal, regular thing – Draco getting a drink for Harry in his kitchen, leaning against the counter and looking effortlessly gorgeous. Harry wanted to see this sight every day, he wanted it to be commonplace and simply a part of his life
Their breaths grew rapid as they continued, the two of them pressed together in the tiny bathroom stall. Harry felt out of his head, his mind, his body – he could hardly believe this was real. With a half-laugh, he moved to kiss Malfoy hard, his mouth working desperately as Malfoy gave a little sigh. He bit Malfoy’s lip and pulled, causing Malfoy to stroke faster.
He watched as Potter looked away again and dropped his gaze to his lap, and Draco felt lost.
Draco cleared his throat.
Draco laughed.
Malfoy frowned. "Any symptoms out of the ordinary?"
Potter wiped his mouth roughly with the back of his hand.
“That’s one way to put it,” Harry mumbled.
“Listen, Malfoy – “
He hadn’t gotten that riled up in years. He hated being out of control - it scared him. It made him feel like he could just fall back into his old ways and there would be nothing he could do about it. The last thing he wanted was to go back to being the vile, aggressive shit he once was.
mates with Malfoy?”
Draco heard Weasley tell his girlfriend that there was still time left for Harry to change his mind as he passed them and hurried to catch up with Harry.
Potter gave a disbelieving chuckle and walked away again.
“Are you sure this isn’t just a horrible excuse to get me out of my clothes, Potter?”
“It’s not
ed and leaned back. He crossed his arms.
"Take these off," Harry muttered once they'd parted, hurriedly pushing Draco's clothes off. Draco kicked them away, and finally he was just as naked as Harry was. Then Harry said, "I'm a bottom."
Draco looked at him. He couldn't find it in himself to be that mad. He sighed.
“I know, Ron,” Harry said, biting his lip. “Thanks, mate. Really.”
Harry stiffened. “What kind of questions?”
“That was a bit weak, Malfoy.”
He was already walking away when Granger called out, “Wait!”
“You’re not just saying that?” Harry asked, finally finding his voice.
Normally, his frustration would have risen considerably, but he was drained after the events of the past few days.
“Please tell Leonel Estrada that I need his help in Mr. Potter’s room.”
“You don’t have a dog,” Draco said, dumbfounded. “I don’t have a car.”
“Ask Draco about it later tonight,” Hermione told him. Ron nodded, eyes flashing from Harry to Hermione and back. “He’ll clear it up. He’s the Healer, after all.”
, but he’d never pressed. He’d never given it much thought –
“You sure? I wouldn’t want you freezing to death.”
Leonel nodded, and Draco could see the anxiety in his face.
“Oh. There’s no need to thank me, Potter, I didn’t do anything.”
Draco shrugged.
“Umbridge,” Harry bit out. “She gave me detentions for telling the truth about Voldemort-“ Draco flinched but Harry went on as usual, “and this is what she made me do. Carve these words over and over again, as if it’d make it true. As if it’d mean that he wasn’t really back.”
Draco couldn’t help but smile at their Gryffindor logic and optimism.
“Come in,” Draco said, and stepped back to let Harry inside.
“How can you say that so certainly?”
“I’m not going to er, pressure you or anything. I’m more than happy just snogging you.”
“You don’t need to say you’re sorry, Harry,” Ginny said firmly but not unkindly. “You needed to let it all out at one point.”
It was a good forty or so minutes later before I found myself gasping, recovering from what, as promised, had been the most earth-shattering orgasm of my entire life, clinging to Draco Fucking Malfoy as we both lay collapsed on the couch, panting for breath, sticky with sweat and semen, limbs entangled, hands running constant paths
I pushed him backwards, gently, moving with him, so that he was on his back, me settled between his thighs, those long, muscled legs circling up around my waist, pulling me closer, holding me tight against him so that I couldn’t have pulled away had I even been able to try. We were still kissing, uncontrollably, hands twisting through each other’s hair, pulling each other even closer, not that it was possible. Harry was groaning into me and I was drinking in every fucking sound he made like they were more precious than air.
Draco frowned.
I couldn’t really even deny it at that point.
As though I could have harmed him, even if I’d wanted to.
Harry nodded, eyes still travelling down the menu.
“Well, why don’t you send him a text in a bit to see how he’s doing, or remind him that Draco adores him, and it’s obvious,” Hermione suggested.
“With what?” he asked, and I frowned momentarily.
Really, I thought as Draco’s arms wrapped around me for the side along, Tokyo must have been built by wizards, what with all the perfect little nooks and tiny streets just made for disappearing in and out of.
“Hello,” Hermione smiled. “May we have a bottle of the Sancerre

“It has nothing to do with anything,” Draco agreed.

“Morning,” I yawned, stretching out alongside him, circling my feet to loosen my ankles up a bit, wondering if when I turned thirty in a few months I’d just tumble straight over the proverbial hill or something.
“Come on, Draco, let’s go.”
Harry’s voice broke the silence once more, and three sets of eyes turned to stare at him curiously.

“Barcelona is just a wonderful city to get lost in, wander about, look at the architecture. And the
“No wonder you were such a pillock at Hogwarts.”
“Merciful Merlin, Potter,” he sighed, pinching his nose in exasperation. “You are so damned lucky I’ve already packed your stupid bag for you.”
“Uncle Vernon.” Harry was still gazing into the eyes of his… partner?
“Potter?” Malfoy’s voice questioned, somewhere to my left.
“Sorry, love,” Draco whispered, kissing my temple. “I have to pick up a file for work after we get our passports stamped, and then we’ll be on our way.”
I smiled as I selected the treacle-flavoured one — the one with the billywig essence — sending the others back, and returned to find Draco glaring up at me huffily, pouting so fiercely, it was almost adorable.
“Yes,” Harry replied, nodding emphatically. “I like the sound of all of that.”
“Do you want to find a table upstairs? It’s nice on the mezzanine with the light shining in.”
“Master Draco,” she said, taking an eager step towards him, eyes widening even further. “You

There was a slightly awkward pause, then I flashed a grin of my own in his direction.
“I like the spot you’ve picked,” I said, finally. “Spying on us much?”

“And… someone is after Harry?” she asked. “And they’re in one of these glamours?”
Fuck.
It was the weekend, my weekend, anyhow, and I was swiping my way through Grindr, looking to release some stress following the heinous practice schedule McLeod had adopted following our narrow win over the Falmouth Falcons
My fingers were sliding easily in and out of my more-than-ready hole at this point, but I felt like teasing Draco just a bit more.
I knew that voice.
! Draco!” he cried out
“He was bragging about some of his more grown-up skills and now he’s embarrassed to look at Mum,” Ginny answered, smacking Harry’s middle finger that had reached out and extended itself in front of her face.
“No,” Harry sobbed, arse still pressing up and back as I withdrew once more.
It means they’re delicious, but you
And maybe it had been mostly my subconscious whispering to my drunken self that I had to keep touching him to make sure he was still there — that he was still mine and I was still his.
I just couldn’t remember anything about it.
We were standing on a little raised curb in the middle of an apartment-lined square, four trees lining each corner, and an ornate street lantern standing in the centre.
know that neither you nor Harry actually needs to work, right? I mean, between your inheritance and Harry’s quidditch earnings, I’m sure the two of you would survive.”
I watched, sipping the fantastic whiskey Malfoy had ordered for me, as the rest of the group fell into place below us.
karaoke, apparently some Muggle tradition of singing along with songs with the lyrics displayed on the telly.
“So,” Draco continued, shuffling through some of his parchment. “What is the difference between obsession and love? When does the one slide into the other? And where does thought figure into all of it?”
By that time, he’d already started his demented slide into a power-hungry obsession, having heard rumours of the Dark Lord’s imminent return.
“Of course,” Charlie muttered darkly, crossing his arms and glaring at the screen. “Make the dragons the evil ones.”
“Look at you. Still grinding yourself on me and moaning like it’s the most amazing thing you’ve ever felt. Like you’re not grinding your arse on ex-Death-Eater-cock,” he said silkily, hips rising to meet my downwards thrusts.
I’d spent much of the morning anticipating my own summons, assuming it had to do with the Erised case, but so far, nothing.
“What, they’re gonna mess me up and toss me aside?” Ben asked.
when they would notice us and the thinly disguised disdain would appear on their faces — the accusing stares in my direction, seeing as it was basically my fault Lucius Malfoy was there to ruin their celebration.
“Not admitting it,” I replied with a firm shake of my head.
“I’m going to make that taste like fucking boiled broccoli, bitch,” he threatened and Pansy just threw her head back and laughed.
“Papa! Maman! Look! It’s Harry!”
“I’ll gladly pay for that later,” he called out, giving me a cheeky wink and zooming towards the other end of the clearing, rising up or dipping down to avoid the Bludger that George and Bill were

Rather than obey, Draco merely let out another series of anguished sobs as he shoved his plate of food away from him, dramatically hiccoughing and gasping for more air as he continued to howl and blubber.
Slut that I am, I made some stupid noise that showed how upset I was from the loss.
I was a powerful wizard, sure, but really, we all knew there was no one more powerful than Potter out there.

I could eat fish sperm-maggot sushi.
“But you
“It’s pretty rare… in most of Asia, really,” he grinned back. “Pretty sure it’s a dead giveaway I’m a tourist.”
Potter stared at me, confused. I was sure he had no recollection of me asking when he’d realised he was a cock-whore.
“Draco,” he whimpered, clutching at me when I buried my face in his neck, biting and sucking as I gave in to the deliciously tight squeeze of him around me, driving in and out of his velvety warmth with long, sure strokes, withdrawing almost completely before sinking back in, deep as I could,

Not a sound for weeks, and then, one weekend, there I was, relaxing on my futon, watching Will & Grace, when I’d heard a groan followed by the unmistakable, repeated thud of a bedframe against the shared paper-thin wall between our apartments.
“Merlin, can you imagine how fucking insane this nutter’s flat is?” I asked, shaking my head in awe.
“What?” Ginny frowned. “They did not, those rascals.”

“Probably just realised I’m fit after all these years,” I added, waggling my brows at her suggestively.
“Now I am thinking about that stupid case, though.”
He smiled and tilted his head towards the table.
He raised an eyebrow and I understood.
OMG. I'm so excited because I've got the entire rest of the story more or less "drafted" out and it's going to start just fireballing or whatever from here on out.
“So, Harry,” I sighed, detaching myself from his mouth reluctantly.
Claridges was only a short walk, and the weather was perfect for a short, early Autumn stroll.

Draco merely turned his head to smile down at the girl and her dining companion.
“I still have no idea what you mean when you keep saying that,” I informed him, draining my glass as well.
I was nearly howling with laughter, as were Charlie and Hagrid, at the thought of a teenaged Malfoy having to utter any of these absurd phrases to enter his dormitory.
“I was sure you would have broken yourself out of these by now,” he added, a nearly indistinguishable surge of magic tightening at my invisible bonds.
It was fucking chaos.
he gestured at Draco.
Later that afternoon, we’d played a match against the Cannons that had lasted all but three minutes before I’d swooped in and caught the Snitch, setting a record.
“And, my guess is that you two continued, because Harry, Luv, you were in a ‘certain mood,’ and Draco, having that… how did you put it?... That bloody

“Ron came up with it,” Draco admitted, and I couldn’t help but shrug and smile sheepishly.
There were two long tables inside the tent, and we ended up sitting, more or less, divided between the “adults” and the “children” — we “children” all being in our late twenties and early thirties.
“No, I’m not,” he countered. “I just want you to have the most incredible orgasm of your entire life. Every. Single. Time.” He paused between each word to press a gentle kiss against my mouth, ignoring my attempts to deepen the kiss each time, because, well. As already established, he was an evil prick bent on killing me through sex.
“I was horny. I wanted cock, and it just so happens your mate, here, has a bloody fabulous one, so…”
“That, she does,” I agreed, looking over to grin widely at my partner, making a mental note to gift him and Hermione some goodies next week as we walked into the pub.
I was already lost.
Like I didn’t even fucking exist.
My attention snapped back to the situation at hand when I saw that Bones was motioning at us to get more details out of Williams.
Wherein Harry discovers Grindr and sets up his profile. Will someone respond? (Haha, of course they will....)
She and Ginny breezed past Malfoy, who merely grinned at them before turning his attention to us.
From their appearances, to their personalities, to even how their magic manifested; Harry’s brash, almost crackling, like the air before a thunderstorm, and Draco’s, quiet and subdued, but no less dangerous or powerful.
“Yes,” he smiled back, kissing me gently.

“Must be really good sex,” she pointed out. I shrugged.
“Red and yellow fruit? I don’t know how you’d translate that to English… but… fruit.”
“I have some on my mobile, of course,” Mum continued as though I hadn’t spoken, and Harry scooted his chair closer to her and leaned in to get a better look.
Fuck Harry, for teasing me so cruelly like this.
“Pansy’s finally awake,” I informed her, only slightly jealous of my childless mates who still had the luxury of sleeping in on weekends.
Hermione smiled ruefully and took a sip of her pint, she and the redhead seemingly unaware of the imminent danger from the positively simmering dragon sitting between them.
“What’d I miss?” Gin asked, sitting beside me and stealing a sip of my coffee. “What are we talking about?”
“No one’s caught the damned Snitch yet,” he added, emerald eyes blazing furiously.
“We’ll see,” he replied, shrugging and finishing off his sandwich.
“You would.”
“What I

Draco and I nodded while keeping our eyes focused on Toshio’s tattoo as he pointed to the waves roiling on his forearm, understanding that he’d created this diversion to bring us close enough to discuss the potential diversion without suspicion.

I shook my head.
I turned.
“It’s a short walk,” he informed me, drawing me closer. “And I have half a mind to make you close your eyes for the reveal.”
“You think…” Ron began, then paused. “Fred?”
You know.
Ginny snorted.
I woke a few hours later to the sound of a mobile buzzing.
yelling and shouting when he was angry.

My hand circled my cock lightly and stroked gently, teasing.
“I’m horny as fuck and if that cock’s really yours, I can’t care less.”
“Fleur?” he asked, then smiled softly as realisation hit.
“Le Sacre du Voile?” Draco asked, looking surprised.
“Not only are they the minority, but you’ve got two of the most powerful wizards in Britain lookin’ out after you.”
Harry broke away from me then to chuckle, green eyes smirking up at me.

Don’t get me wrong; I loved Callum and spoilt him thoroughly, but I could see right through Alice’s scheme behind it all.
“This is for you,” he was saying, and I swear to fucking god, a bottle of wine just, like, magically appeared in his hands.
“Oh, well then, yes,” Draco replied, nodding this time. “Now.”
Draco was nervous.
“Me neither,” he responded.
“Oh, I’m sorry kitten,” he purred, standing up slowly behind me,
“What do you want?” I asked, circling that pulsing hole with the tip of my dick, as though I didn’t know exactly what Potter wanted.
“She became more and more obsessed as her love wasn’t reciprocated,” I explained, glancing cautiously at the Muggle policemen still perusing the flat.

“I mean, you know, with Grindr, and all,” I continued, making another round down his side, watching his eyes, still glowering down at me suspiciously.
“Although my studio was the one overlooking the courtyard, so it was nice and quiet.”
By this time, I’d brought my hands up to cover my eyes and had just revealed myself, thus commencing an absolutely riveting game of peek-a-boo, which lasted for several rounds, baby alternately staring intently at the hands hiding my face, wondering where I’d disappeared to, then giggling and babbling in delight when I revealed that I was still there.

“Ooh, do tell,” Ron leaned forward anxiously.
“Which mummy could do, but it takes a lot of time, so she just pops open a tin when you’re sick and need to feel better quickly.”
Harry’s eyes narrowed in concentration as the pebbles drew back once more, and I felt an odd, almost electrical surge blast through me, almost like the waves that used to knock me over when we went to the beach in the summer, and I saw a faint shimmering bubble around Draco.
“But I was serious, though,” he continued. “Do we think this bloke’s been keeping tabs on Draco from Boston? Or is he in England somewhere?”

“It’s just this way,” Ginny explained, leading us down the street to our right, and minutes later, we were at the theatre.

“I didn’t exactly have a lot of time to get ready this morning,” he replied primly, taking a sip, eyes flicking over to me for a brief second before returning to the scenery outside.
“Oh, fuck, yes, please….”
And, to be entirely honest, so did I.
A brief glance upwards told me that he and his mum were still deeply engrossed in their conversation, so I quickly swiped to the next photo, and actually did stop in my tracks.
“So that means you can join me in the shower, then….”
“Let me down!” he cried out, turning a frightening shade of crimson as the blood rushed to his head to flush his already anger-reddened face.

The wizarding world had let out a collective sigh of relief when she’d reappeared after Voldemort’s defeat, having cleverly staged her own demise and going into hiding upon learning of the target put out on her.
Honestly, kissing Harry was a dangerous thing.
Actually, I frowned and couldn’t help the little grin quirking at the corner of my mouth, “Harry’s” trousers were definitely much too long for him and definitely not Harry’s.
“Harry,” I murmured, nuzzling along his jawline and the delicate shell of his ear. “Wake up, love.”
“Where you can sober up and then,
“Stop. They’re not worth it,” Harry instructed, running a hand through the other man’s hair, and I couldn’t help myself a small smile knowing that Lily’s son had turned out so poorly.

“Why? Saw something you liked?” he asked, smirking at me.

I sighed and added a second finger, sliding both into the warm velvet of his mouth, leaning in to nip at his ear, lingering to whisper:
“Draco,” I murmured, feeling him hardening against my thigh.

I pointed as we headed
“I mean, just this afternoon, George asked what your father would think of the two of us.”
I groaned and buried my face in his neck once more.
“Other than that,” Draco’s eyes flicked over the menu thoughtfully. “Anything from their brunch selection is great. The Aubergine Schnitzel is good, too, as is their burger. You’ve got to get it with the truffled Brie,” he added, eyes snapping up to meet mine, as though daring me to order the burger plain.
“We’re going to wait an hour to get sushi?”
“Oh, stop,” Charlie chided, ruffling Malfoy’s hair once more before releasing him and pulling him close into a hug, Malfoy still struggling and pretending to shove away.

Oh, I realised with a jolt.
“This is where Draco grew up? No wonder his dad sounds like such a pompous twat.”
Harry seemed to notice our puzzled expressions.
Draco and I both turned our glares on her.
I rolled my eyes and tossed my bottle of shower gel at him with a spare washcloth.
“Do you mean to tell me that
And this was just the tip.
“It’s hard to explain, but you’ll see,” she continued.
“Ginny! Micah! Hullo!”

Alfie nodded.

Callum took the wand in his right hand carefully and turned so he was facing the hallway and held it up, then glanced over his shoulder for reassurance.
“Just behave yourself and don’t let any snakes loose, Potter,” he joked as we entered and I got to explore a zoo for the second time in my life.
“I’ll ask Bessie to prepare some tea and sandwiches. I have a feeling you’re all going to need something to nibble on throughout the night,” Narcissa excused herself, slipping out of the room.
“I didn’t like when you were gone,” Harry mumbled, grabbing my face between his palms and staring at me, pupils all but swallowing the green in his eyes.
Happy tears, because my Draco was in love.
It was Friday night, and we had gathered again for weekly pints at The World’s End — which was quickly becoming our favourite spot — and I couldn’t help but shake my head and glance over at Blaise while we waited on our next round.

“A family like the one Draco grew up in,” Hermione began again, more slowly this time. “I mean, the Malfoy’s are one of the oldest wizarding families in Britain.”
“Oh. My. Sweet. Merlin.” Potter was gasping, hands reaching to take the mobile from Mum so he could examine the scene playing before him.
“Tell me,” he sighed, pulling me closer to him with a tiny smile.
I grinned again as I remembered Draco’s look of shock and, honestly, disdain, when I’d told him I hadn’t realized he was upper class until we got to England.
“Sometimes we have to make decisions.”
“Well, don’t let my being awake stop you,” I encouraged, shifting us so that Harry was now laying atop me, pulling him down for a kiss.
“I don’t give a fuck about
Just watched as he stepped away from me once more, both hands plucking the toy from its magical grasp and running it lovingly through his fingers, eyes raising to meet mine with
“The tuna is candied in the treacle… it’s crazy good. Want to try?”
Blaise was seated to Ron’s left, and Pansy to Hermione’s right, with a sixth empty chair, presumably for Draco, between them. Directly across from me.
“How’d you convince it otherwise?” he asked, interested, and I wondered if anyone else had ever convinced the Sorting Hat to put them in a different house.
Malfoy began to kiss and suck a trail down my neck, nipping and sucking, leaving who knows how many bruises and marks in his wake, and I just moaned, pressing his face further into my neck, encouraging him.
“He got enough of an eyeful this afternoon to make an informed opinion, I’d imagine,” Harry commented around a mouthful of pheasant, grinning over at Father.

I had no idea what the nutter was talking about, but something about his tone frightened me more than any of the broken glass, balusters, or other disgusting displays of abnormality we’d been subjected to this day.

unfair, six-to-one, if you ask me, but I’ll give you my best shot.”
“Mmm,” I sighed, sipping my champagne and watching a shower of fireworks dance across the sky.
Forget his voice and the way he could command me to do anything he wanted.
Did you have any idea how lucky you were growing up in London?
A sweet, innocent, blissfully happy Harry — before the Dursleys, before Voldemort, before he’d been The Boy Who Lived.
“You called me Harry,” I blurted.
“Ok, then,” he acquiesced finally, releasing me and taking a step back and starting to walk back towards the bedroom.
“I’m not sure,” Hermione spoke up finally. “I’ve never left one up for longer than a few hours… how long do they last?”
“Yes,” he replied, nodding. “How did you even find this place?”
I awoke next morning absolutely dying beneath the heat of my comforter and realised I’d forgotten to cast the usual cooling charm I used to ensure I didn’t wake up a sweaty, dreadful mess.
“No,” I sighed, running a hand through my hair.
“So… you and Bill seem… friendly,” I blurted out finally as I cut some flowers with the muggle scissors George had found in his dad’s workshop.
Draco waved a hand, and the room doubled in size.
Any Muggle
“Well,
But nope.
“Yes,” Harry agreed, hips canting up to meet my own, and I couldn’t help but chuckle.
“What?” he asked, looking somewhat nervous again.
“I’m starving,” he added, eyes locked on mine as his foot began
Potter’s eyes were riveted.
I felt one of Harry’s legs drape across my shoulder then wrap itself clumsily around my back and I couldn’t stifle the muffled gurgle of surprise at the sudden, sharp pull around my throat, my eyes snapping open to see Harry, head thrown back against the wall in ecstasy, his right hand stretched down and wrapped around my tie, pulling it taut so that it continued to tighten around my neck.
“Merlin, fuck me,” Ron groaned, slumping into the seat next to me and dropping his head onto the table.
And then.
“One for dress socks and one for other socks,” he replied, as though stating the obvious.
“We were at St. John’s for lunch,” Hermione explained. “That Saturday when we got called in.”
“Pity I didn’t follow your lead,” I spat out, laughter dying away for the moment. “Then we might both be standing here, in all your Azkaban-worn glory, together.”
I frowned again and began thumbing through other journals.
“You believe these to be terrorist attacks?”
And then he’d met
I’m gorgeous — nearly as beautiful as you are (and no, you asshole, that’s not just ego talking, that’s every stupid bloke I’ve
“That he made Draco late for work this morning and, apparently, dress like shit,” Ron replied.
I mean,
And, apparently, Ben’s Obliviated one.
The game continued
“Erm. Conversation?” I managed, causing the group to laugh
“My mum,” Draco replied immediately. “Who else?”
“So… Mummy Draco?” Hermione asked, grinning.
“Tomorrow morning,” I replied, equally enthralled as they executed their “tonkatsu dance” to perfection before us.
“Tell me, Potter,” I asked, slowly pushing my cock halfway into him, then out, before continuing. “When did you figure out you were such a massive cock-slut?”
“What?” he demanded.
“Did you ever once imagine that it’d be like this?”
Instead, I closed my eyes and forced myself to pause before sliding back out, reluctantly, as Harry clutched and writhed beneath me, whimpering and groaning his dissatisfaction as I repeated this a few more times.
I didn’t answer.
“Oh. Yeah, well, they’d be

I nearly died from the relief that flooded through me.
They’d change their minds in a heartbeat, I thought with a smirk.

However, we were now in, far as I could tell, a giant cavern.
“Right,” I rolled my eyes. “Because nothing puts me in the mood more than ‘The Office’.”
That would
I paused and glanced up at Williams, who also seemed to be deep in thought.
, smeared some crème fraîche on it, then topped it with an odd-looking scoop of glossy, little black pearls using a special spoon that came with it.
Hermione collapsed into peals of laughter as she took over their impression of Drunk Harry, clasping her arms around Ron’s neck.
Davies sighed, brow furrowing as he took out some of his own parchment.

the truth.”
I shifted my weight to my right hand, the left gently palming the straining bulge in his pants as I slid my knees off the bed to kneel between his thighs.
At one point, when he’d been describing yet another one of Draco’s creative retaliations for distracting him from work, I’d burst out laughing, informing Harry that it must have been dually torturous for him, trying to fuck me, when, in reality, he’d just been dying to
“What are we going to do with you?”
And again.
On arching my chest up into his mouth as he latched on to first one nipple then the other, teeth nipping, his tongue following to soothe before his mouth latched on to suck, then repeating the process again.
“This is about you,” I went on, trailing kisses down his chest, sucking a dusky nipple into my mouth, eliciting another moan from Harry, before returning to plunder his mouth once more.
I rolled my eyes and groaned, as did several others in the room.
“Didn’t seem to be,” he replied. “They were all kind of in a jumble around the bed.”
Harry frowned again as he looked at the tables and then at the box of photographs before him.
“Really?” Williams frowned at me. “You haven’t figured that out?”
“No,” I said again.
“Did you picture me loosening that pretty, little, pink arse of yours with my mouth?”

“Oh gods,” I gasped, eyes snapping open to stare up at Draco, then our chef, dazedly.
take him with us.”
“Why would you think we’d want to make you sad?”
“Right, of course,” he repeated. “Second sock drawer… I’ll be sure to tell him to look there next time he has trouble finding them.”
Happy Sunday, all.
Ok, then, let’s say I had shown up at yours, sloshed, having just come from another bloke’s?
“He doesn’t,” Draco spoke up, leaning against the door frame leading to the kitchen, and then I remembered that Draco could read minds or something.
He stopped and rolled his eyes as we sniggered and snorted with laughter around him.
“Is this helping?” I asked a few moments later, still wide-eyed and innocent-like, gazing up at him as I continued to stroke him, the scent of treacle teasing me, and I knew it wouldn’t be long before I gave in.
way, but… he was just a kid, wasn’t he?”
I leant back in to take just the tip of him into my mouth once more, tongue swirling and licking up the pre-cum literally streaming from his slit as my hands stroked gently up his thighs.
“An unhappy relationship or a major argument,” Hermione replied, because,
“What do you love most about me?” he continued, still lazily swirling his tongue in and out of my mouth, twining it with mine
“Oh!” Violet cried out. “Yum! It tastes like strawberry ice cream!”
He smiled again and reached out to brush some hair from my forehead.

We were both silent for a minute, thinking the same thing.

I mean, honestly, I should have known better.
The public had not been the most accepting of my newly disclosed relationship, and while the team had stood steadfastly behind me, the jeers and jibes from the stands were
“I was an Auror because that’s what everyone expected me to do…”
“Yes,” she nodded, eyes shining fervently. “And I would do it again in a heartbeat, given similar circumstances. I didn’t want any Death Eaters or, heaven forbid, Voldemort, to be able to harm them or otherwise use them to get information, or, you know, to have lured Harry or myself, or Ron. It hurt, and it was one of the most difficult things I’ve ever had to do, but it was in their best interest. I had to keep them safe.”
“Sounds a lot
“Harry,” I managed, turning my head to press kisses along the flesh of his thighs and cheeks.
“Blaise, when have I
Also, because I know we all talk about building levels in different ways in different countries, for the purposes of this story, the entry-level storey that is level with the ground is the "ground floor" (not the first, like in the US and ?) So the second-storey in this chapter could be read as "third-storey" for anyone more familiar the US version. (And, now I'm convinced my note makes it even more confusing, but whatever. Sorry?)
“What?” Harry demanded, removing his apple from his mouth, soaked from head to shoulder, glaring at me, still dry.
“Do what?” I frowned, trying to keep my face as neutral as possible.
What other sweet spots could I find?
Without wasting another second, I stormed out of the flat and began striding down the street towards, hoping that Draco’s charm was location-based as opposed to person-based.
I nodded, and Dudley chuckled and shook his head.
I’d downloaded Grindr a few weeks ago and that was changing considerably, now that I could advertise, so to speak, to the right sort of bloke.

I barely blinked before tossing it into the room, flicking my wand at it to send it dancing along towards the coffee table.
“And it’s really a lot like football, then?”
“No, no,” I continued pacing.
Another turn now, to summon Water and its ability to bring peace, healing, and compassion, manifesting as a giant wave cresting over the dome, crashing down and sweeping through the circle, settling as a gently undulating cobalt pool in the West.
“I don’t know how to describe it,” Blaise added, still looking off in the distance.
Williams said nothing, but his smirk was all the answer we needed.
Draco’s smirk, and I couldn’t help but laugh aloud, as did several others.

Draco just stared at her for a few seconds.
"It could still be anyone.”
“Careful, Potter,” I sighed as he finally slid down, swallowing around my cock yet again, “You’re not going to be able to talk for the rest of the day if you keep that up.”
With a laugh.
All three women threw their heads back and laughed.
Our server returned to clear our plates and enquire about dessert before I could ask him more about his time in Boston.
From my job after a particularly dangerous mission when I questioned if this was maybe the last time I’d put my life in danger, knowing damned well that it wasn’t.
regal disdain you do so well.
How helpless he’d felt and how he’d hoped to just bring the man a small bit of comfort before the Unspeakable had arrived to take the man away.
“Great,” he muttered, lifting the bottle to his lips and taking a large gulp. “Just what I needed.”
Except, of course, that this one was tailored to Malfoy’s personal style.
“He did warn the both of you to stop pissing him off, honestly,” Dudley piped up.
“Draco,” I managed, between chewing and laughing, “I have to admit, Blaise is probably right!”
Draco started
“He’s
A remote part of my brain launched into a somewhat dedicated exploration as to what I had done to work Draco into such a frenzy.
And, with one goddamn sentence, you fucking
“We should snap a photo in each spot we visit, having a snog against the sunset, and we can make a little gallery wall to remember our travels,” he sighed, lips still brushing mine as he spoke so that I had to pull him even more tightly up against me and snog him properly.
“I don’t even know what that
Mum’s brief flicker of a smile told me she was thinking the same thing.
“You haven't?”
“And you asked for my cock.”
You know, the toddler ones they sell in Diagon Alley that barely hover fifteen centimetres above the ground so you can’t hurt yourself when you inevitably tumble off to one side.
“Dudley, dearest, have another cake,” I insisted, pushing the tray towards him.
“Why not?” I asked.
“I don’t see what we have to talk about,” I muttered, leaning into his caress
Draco had been glancing over at Harry, hands still working to disentangle himself from Ben, when they stilled suddenly.
And I’ll admit that I frowned a bit, despite not having really given a shit about being upper class for years, then
If I said his entire face didn’t light up, and that it didn’t do something funny to my insides, I’d be a bigger liar than Voldemort.
“I got tied up,” he continued, pulling his laptop and a minuscule stack of parchment from his briefcase, a quick spell unshrinking them so they returned to normal size.

“What do you want to eat?” I asked.

Harry responded by rolling his hips into the pillow and offering his arse up to me in a silent plea.
Draco, Williams, and I all burst out laughing.
Malfoy chuckled.

Safely out of sight of prying Muggle eyes, I shrank the journals and put them in my breast pocket and began walking.
Shit, Harry, I scolded myself. He can’t talk about work.

I’d always been verbose, but something about Potter made me go into over-drive.

This was a habit he’d always had — sucking his thumb on one hand and playing with someone’s earlobe with the other.
“We hate each other,” Malfoy stated.

No fucking way. I wasn’t ready to go there.
“Felt I really needed one, what, with this prat opening the door,” Harry continued, still gazing affectionately at Draco.
“Fuck, Draco,” he sighed, breaking our kiss, finally, his hips and thighs still working as he slid up and down my length.
“I need you to watch for me,” I added, pressing another chaste kiss at the sweet spot between his hole and his bollocks.
do, Malfoy?” she asked, switching her gaze over to him and handing me back my coffee cup.
“Harry,” he croaked, one hand reaching out to Harry while the other sought contact with Ben in any way possible, ending up bopping him on the cheek.
“Look at you,” he murmured, a finger gently probing at my slackened hole.
This is not to say that our first few weeks together were entirely blissful.
“Yes!” Lupin cried back, grinning and clapping hysterically, which
“What’s this ceremony for?” Ron asked, frowning as he chewed on a bit of toast.
“I was a right arse last time I saw you,” he clarified, wincing slightly. “From what I can even remember, anyway.”
The years away at Hogwarts coupled with a few years overseas had relaxed his accent slightly, Draco now leaning more towards the modern accent many of his generation were opting for, and I knew that now he only cranked his polished voice on sarcastically.
“I mean, here you were just telling me about how much work you’ve got with this case,” he grinned. “Clearly not the best time to ask you to step back from work. I should have realised.”
“Pansy,” I said, keeping my gaze on Draco. “It seems you have quite the stash on Malfoy. Once I’m finished embarrassing myself here, I think it’s only fair you share something for my trouble.”
Draco frowned and chewed at his lip pensively.
He leant up to press one of those goddamned kitten kisses into my mouth, and I immediately tried to follow his mouth down, but he raised a finger to my lips, a knowing little smirk on his face.
he’d moaned and cried out, enjoyed
Harry was on his side, facing me, one arm tucked up under his sweet little head, which was snuggled into the crook of my neck, our bodies turned towards each other, legs a tangled mess, and I couldn’t have been fucking happier.
“He… might be… at your Aunt and Uncle’s,” she finally admitted quietly.
Someone, ahem,

“What is it that you’re worried about?” I asked finally.

One must always use caution when dealing with dragons.
I frowned at Draco, then up at our chef, who was staring back at me with that sort of knowing glee a prankster has while watching his prank unfold.
