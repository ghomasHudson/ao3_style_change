Draco felt the firm arms that held him become restless, the grip almost steel-like. He could tell that Harry was trying to seek comfort from him, and the blond gave in with no hesitation—he burrowed into the warmth, hands anxiously fiddling with themselves as the feeling of barely-hidden guilt settled in his stomach.
“Gently,” repeated Ron, croaking a little, “but
He was alone. They were alone.
“No touching,” Draco added in quickly, the thumps of his heartbeat loud and clear in his ears.
the raven’s head perked up slightly, a wildfire of dark green burning in his eyes as the blond cried out, his near-wet lashes fluttering close tightly. “Please, it’s too much, I can’t take it, I—“
Harry stared at him expectantly, patting the pillow twice.
Potter barked out a short laugh, to which the other replied with a fierce glare that practically spoke fire. He ignored the scowling blond as his hand calmly reached for a glass on the counter, swirling with a golden honey that sparkled. “And you’re the one calling me a deviant, Malfoy,” he mused, lifting the drink to his lips.
“Stop what?” Potter asked, genuinely confused.
His cock was throbbing, flushed and red and completely past the hem of his shirt. Draco couldn’t help but moan as he watched precum drip down his cock, slick and leaking and pooling on the floor all pearly and white—
Then, a powerful silencing charm hit the door, making Draco jerk beneath him in surprise.
—look
Draco froze, and it seemed that with it, his train of thought too. His mind went blank, and his lips fell wordless. Potter knew, then. He knew who shagged the hell out of him at the party, Potter knew what he was hiding beneath the ever-so-thin cloth that sinfully clung to his throat—
“Fine?” the faint creak of a chair spinning, and then—fuck. The idiot must be facing him directly now, and Draco was doing everything he could to stop from squirming in his seat. Then, a light chuckle. “That’s all you have to say about yesterday?”
idea to drink himself drunk with Pansy on the night of his birthday.
“Bye, Malfoy!"
Draco faked a polite smile as he went past one of the security guards up front the main entrance. “Laurent.”
He buried his trembling fists in his pockets as he trailed behind the warden, a sudden whisper of his name making him halt.
Harry’s jaw clenched, his intense dislike for the woman growing stronger and stronger by the minute. Little prisoner, as if she were talking about a caged animal—
“Do you know—” A thrust. “—how fucking hot—” Another thrust. “—you are like this?”
Potter’s breath ghosted against his lips. “Do you want me to stop?” and this time, it was genuine, his eyes flicking to Draco worriedly.
Potter choked in protest, kicking Weasley—who, in return, cursed aloud. Draco only arched an elegant eyebrow, pursing his lips. “Potter shagged someone too, then?”
Draco’s jaw dropped, speechless. Sure, he and Potter had grown rather close over the past few years, working together as Aurors, putting their famed rivalry behind them—but not once have they ever gathered enough courage to let things get
Draco felt out of breath, every shuddering exhale coming out harshly through parted lips as half-lidded eyes went slightly unfocused. Potter let his hand slip down and under the blond’s silken skirt, trailing over netted thighs as his fingers left shameless trails of saliva at its wake.
And all of it came rushing back.
“You call that a
that fell from his eyes, his skin turning a deeper shade of crimson in embarrassment.
“That’s—“ Rolls of pain and clouded desperation assaulted him as Draco worried his teeth over his bottom lip to try and hide any more noises that escaped, but Potter’s scoff told him all he needed to know as his eyes rolled back again. “Ngh,
Hermione let him go. Harry swallowed the knot that stuck in his throat, letting his head drop down as he managed a small nod. The near-quiet clicks of boots on the stone-cold floor rung in his ears, beckoning him in—all the way to the stairwell in the far end, where he knew the most criminal of them were kept away.
Like he’s given up already.
His head spun around, his voice laced with a genuine concern. “You alright?”
out of prison!”
He wasn’t facing him right now, but he was almost absolutely certain that Potter grinned. “Either way, I’m gonna see you naked somehow, Malfoy.”
from the way she spoke of his name— “and I thought that you, of all people, would know that.”
"But you're—how the hell did you even get past the main entrance?"
for him.
Draco was so close, so fucking close—and it didn’t help that Potter looked as if he were too, seeing as there were short, huffed groans that rumbled from his chest as his clouded eyes went half-lidded slightly, low and fluttering and
The blond looked away in a haze, trying to shut everything out. It was too much—everything was hitting him all at once.
Potter threw him a dark smile; a sealed promise. He lunged forwards, making a move for Draco as one bristle arm pinned him to the shower wall by the throat. The Slytherin gasped, moist air hitting his skin as he felt cold water run down his back. Draco growled as Potter trapped his pale wrists to the wall at either side of his head, but it soon turned into a breathless whimper when a wave of pleasure shot up his spine.
They shared a moment of silence, long enough for the tension to seep in.
The warden let out an incredulous scoff, shaking her head. She didn’t talk until they reached another set of stairs at the end of the hall, and Harry could only brace himself as another wave of spells hit him—
“Yeah?” Draco felt his gaze drop to Potter’s forearms, swallowing at the lean stretch of muscle that braced against one another. “Try me.”
Harry threw Draco one last grin, and the blond returned it, just as confidently. It reminded him so much of the young, stubborn rivals they used to be—driven by a wild, raging fire that burned, burned and
A voice inside his head was screaming that he should just back out, that maybe there was still a chance to never go through this ridiculous dare from the bet he lost at all—but Draco knew his pride would forever be tarnished if he did so.
“Yeah, well, this wouldn’t have happened if you didn’t flaunt your little one-night stand with Weaslette in front of me!”
He might’ve enjoyed it—loved it, even—if it weren’t for the dark thoughts that circled his head. Draco knew it, but he was trying; he tried to slip in his tongue, savour the tingles that danced on his skin, moan softly and buck against the gentle hand resting on his waist, but all that came out was a strangled sob.
“Not yet, kitten,” growled Potter, pulling away and looking astounded at what he’s done to the Malfoy heir. Draco found himself panting, scrambling to grasp Potter’s hand away from his leaking cock.
“Explain?” Draco felt whimsical and light-headed. His body shook, his eyes blurred, and his breath reeled. “Gods, I should’ve
“Two weeks ago, I found out that the wards here are powerful enough to withhold any prisoner—” he leaned in, rubbing soft circles in Draco’s wrists soothingly— “but not one with the Elder Wand.”
Draco shut his eyes tight, his whisper quiet as he listened to Harry’s soft heartbeat. “I thought you didn’t want me.”
His mouth parted in a near-silent gasp when he felt Harry’s thumbs pry his aching hole open, and with no such finesse, shove his tongue in as far as he could past the rim, his nose digging into the ridge between his cheeks. Draco cried out, spluttering, unconsciously jerking back as a wave of pleasure swelled straight to his cock.
“Yeah, well—” Harry drew in a shuddering breath, emerald eyes flitting open just slightly as the hands on the blond’s back tensed, his voice laced with a hint of bitterness that made the other wince. “You’d be too if you were an Auror and you got a whole tower of damn
“Don’t bite your lips,” Harry informed him quietly, his voice filled with a wicked sort of danger that made Draco whine. “I want to hear you.”
He nodded.
you’ll look after I make you cry.”
“You—” Potter seemed to straighten now, awkwardly hiding the spill on the ground beneath his shoe. “You’re kidding with me, right?”
Draco nodded, or so what he hoped was a nod as he let out a shaky exhale, too hazy in the mind and focused on the crisp scent from the other to notice the hands curling from behind him, carefully unravelling out folds and folds of dark velvet that his pale skin, which trickled from all the over-heated sweat.
Potter leaned in, burying his nose between Draco’s arse as his tongue ravaged his rim roughly. He licked, sucked, thrusted inside the Slytherin with his tongue like a starving wolf, feeding off of the slick that secreted from his tight hole. Draco whimpered pathetically, trying to push back, but Potter was gripping his wet thighs so brutally he was sure he’d get bruises by the end of it.
and even if he couldn’t see, Draco was almost certain he was smirking. Harry had his hand around his cock, going up and down in a slow, agonising rhythm—he was keeping Draco from climax, the absolute
Eventually, it worked, because Draco finally melted into the warm touch, letting himself be cradled as he raised his own arms so they pressed against his chest—making it so that he could lift a palm to the other’s heart, and feel the steady, anchored beat that thrummed under his fingertips.
“You’re so close, aren’t you?” Potter whispered in a mocking tone, a cruel smirk on his face before snickering at the pathetic look that Draco wore. He pulled out slowly, lifting the blond’s shaking thighs as to guide him, giving the other enough time to let out a stuttering breath before slamming back in.
“What?” Potter questioned, his eyes sparkling innocently as he rolled down his collar, showing off his… his… fuck, there were
The pace was fast and ruthless and beast-like. Draco wanted to thrash and whimper from the ever-growing bliss that clouded his senses, but with the carefully placed hands on his waist, and the magic that emboldened the tie around his wrists, all that was left was the intense sensation of it all. The thrusts were almost impossible to bear, but it was also . . .
said Draco desperately as a sob wracked out of his frame, hiccupping into the other’s neck as more tears fell from his blurred eyes. Potter only continued to stroke him with his cum-splattered hand and into his slick cock, groaning softly as the last few thrusts rocked into him.
“P—Potter,” Draco tried, voice raspy as he attempted to move, but the grip on his tousled hair grew firm—enough to send him a gentle warning, but not too rough to hurt the blond.
“Goddamn,” Draco whispered out, his nose scrunching up as he sniffled. Harry had to hold back a grin, one that got him a harmless jab to the side as he tried to help his dazed boyfriend down on the couch. “I will
“A lesson,” said Harry faintly, his blood turning cold. He wasn’t entirely sure if it were because of the delighted thrill at the way she spoke, or the dark-hooded blurs that they slowly neared closer to. He recognised the void-like faces, the spindly fingers that he could’ve sworn he felt on his skin, and the past encounters that flashed before his eyes.
“Hurts still,” Draco admitted, sniffling again as he burrowed his face in his pillow. “Where’s my blanket?”
The fact that he was at Potter’s mercy—and it seemed that the raven knew that too, just from the look of arrogance that he wore and held over the blond’s head—and that he would do anything that the other asked of him, whatever it may be, made his a pit in his stomach burn hot as his body arched.
Draco felt hot warmth embrace his body, and he can’t help but bury his face in it as a body held him back with a lover’s gentleness.
Harry tried not to let his hands waver as he fumbled around his pocket, ignoring the brush of velvet on his knuckles as he drew out his wand. He stiffly looked at the woman as she smiled in delight, tucking his wand away without much caution.
Draco glanced to a tall mirror once more, taking in the lavish green that adorned his lithe body, the dark velvet that swaddled his hips, the silken gloves that veiled his trembling hands, and the tight knee-high boots that perfectly fit in with the rest of his bold attire.
and I couldn’t stop it.” Draco was trembling, his hands fisting the blankets drenched in his own sweat. He felt a tight knot form in his throat, and so suddenly, it was hard to speak. “I couldn’t—I couldn’t pull you up, and you—you just
interested to me,” Potter pointed out, cocking his head at him with a wild glint in his eyes. The smirk on his face was almost cat-like—promising, even. “Your Slytherin friends told me that you were quite good at it, too.”
Draco’s mind tried to hurry for an answer, or maybe even a small remark of defiance from him, but just the thought of Potter leering up at him with his lips twisted into a mean grin was enough for a quiet, desperate noise to escape him while a finger slowly circled his puckered hole.
“I get it, I’m sick—but I am
Harry could’ve smiled from the relief that washed over him, or maybe even chuckled lightly—but not with the forlorn look on Draco’s face. Not with the forced smile that graced his split lips. Not when he looked like he’s—like he’s—
He felt Potter’s hands sneak into the smooth curve of his waist, cutting him off as they slid further down with intent that didn’t feel so innocent. Nothing—
Potter neared him, watching his face, his vivid eyes nearly black from his lust-blown pupils. “Try me.” Without warning, he pushed in two fingers inside the blond all the way to the firm knuckles, making Draco cry out as he buried his face in Potter’s shoulder.
They both slept well that night, arms tangled and legs interlocked. It was everything they could’ve asked for.
Draco tried to shove the black-haired boy away, but it only made his lithe body press deeper into his muscled ones. A hitched groan of irritation echoed from his throat; his eyes fluttering shut.
Has he ever sounded like that? So broken and fragile? “No matter what I do, I’m still going to be the same Death Eater you hate, I’m still going to be the Malfoy you despise, I’m still going to mean
The warden arched an eyebrow at him, and for a moment, he could’ve sworn that her eyes narrowed just slightly as she huffed. “Never eats his meals, never talks, then makes a mess of everything else in his cell. We even found out that he would shatter his clock on purpose to see a guard, but eventually, he stopped.”
Potter murmured, “always so pretty,” with a small smile as he kept on with the unforgiving pace with his fingers. Draco choked, eyes fluttered shut, realising with mounting horror that if he were pushed any further, tears would fall down his cheeks.
She only smiled at Harry—he couldn’t tell if it was real or not. “Others would say that he was trying to escape,” she told him simply, turning away. “But I think the prison has finally broken him.”
Harry seemed surprised for a split second, but it was soon replaced with a half-hearted smile. He laid the towel to the side, caressing Draco’s face delicately as he planted a light kiss on his crown of blond hair. “As long as you want me to, love.”
“You’ll what?” murmured Harry, thumbing the blond’s bottom lip open with two fingers. Draco trembled, letting his mouth part, his pink tongue swirling around the digits that shamelessly explored him. “Funny, ‘cause I remember someone telling me that I wasn’t fucking you properly.”
“Two taps if you wanna stop, okay?” Potter whispered, pulling back just slightly to look the other in the eyes. Draco just realised then how beautifully
“Potter,” he breathed, mind clouded with an unquenchable thirst, because he needed to get out of these clothes, it was too hot, he could feel sweat trickle down his spine and unto the cleft of his—oh, it was right there, dripping over and bypassing the little rosy pucker—
“I don’t think you’re gonna like him,” blurted Potter all of a sudden.
“Love, please.”
“Can you . . . stay a little bit longer?” he mumbled.
The Slytherin fought the urge to shake his head at him, his hips shifting under his intense, emerald gaze. “Potter, you and I both know that I still have more books to go through. I haven’t even finished my summary yet about the Elfric Uprising during 1647—”
“Go ahead, kitten,” crooned Potter softly, dropping a gentle hand from the blond’s tangled hair and to his nape, then to his warm cheeks with a slight glide that felt—felt
“You’re beautiful like this.” Draco mewled in the boy’s arms, the two long digits pumping inside him in a torturous pace while a hand fondled his balls. “I want to do so many things to you, you know? I bet you like it hard and rough, me tying you up and fucking you ‘till you can’t see straight. Would you like that, kitten?”
“I bet you can’t even make me cry if you tried,” said Draco, a little breathlessly as he attempted to collect some semblance of the control that he had before. He felt proud that he had managed to say all that without a stutter, nor a voice crack, but the flame of confidence that burned inside him flickered out just as quickly when he caught the amused look in Potter’s eyes.
he demanded, his voice cracking. Taking in another deep breath, Draco grunted, trying to bring them both up once more, but all it did was make him cry out at the weight that had been addled unto his arm. “We’re—we’re gonna get out of here. Just a few more seconds. I can—I can do it.”
Even as his boyfriend’s face was buried in his hands, hidden from sight, he could see that the blond’s face was ghostly pale—lacking the pink, healthy flush that would typically sit atop his nose and cheeks. Harry’s worry only increased a ten-fold when he caught the dark circles underneath half-lidded eyes, and the evident
Feeling himself go red at his dampened state, he turned to Potter.
When Draco’s breath had evened out just slightly, his heart thumping in his ears, he blinked his wet lashes open to find Potter smiling at him in triumphant victory, one hand wrapping around the blond’s cock and making him writhe as he whimpered.
Hermione’s hands cradled her warm cup of tea, knowing had she not wasted her time by answering each and every one of her husband’s questions, she might’ve finished it a minute before. She watched as her breath misted over her window, her throat going dry.
that clouded his head. He whimpered at the teeth grazing the precious strip of skin behind his earlobe, jerked his hips back with a whine at the velvet-wrapped steel that slowly pushed inside him, trembled at the hand that wrapped around his slick cock—
Laurent offered him a small nod back, his eyes darting to the blond’s clothes curiously. “I believe you mistook this month for winter, Mr. Malfoy,” he said curtly, a heavy accent dripping off his voice.
Draco’s shoulders began shaking again, a wetness on his cheeks blooming. Harry brought a rough-palmed hand up to his shroud of blond locks, ruffling his hair before letting the blond bury his face in the crook of his neck—safe. This was what safe felt like.
Draco managed a weak snort, dipping his quill in an inkwell as his other hand sorted stacked papers on the left. “Unlike you, Potter, I actually want to keep my job instead of looking for someone who, pray tell, I don’t even remember the face of.”
Harry did. Work could
She daintily wiped off her imaginary tears, ignoring his stutters of indignation. “When will he ever realise that one simple martini could lead to something far more hot and interesting?”
—one whose fingertips were teasingly stroking his inner thighs, and another prying down trousers in desperation.
Draco’s stuttering breath left him as a soft, feather-light kiss was planted on his lips.
“Harry.”
“Draco,” started Potter, and all at once, everything came crashing down.
“Draco Malfoy,” he whispered quietly, and tensed.
Draco turned a lovely shade of red. "As much as I'd love your
Harry tried to ignore the knife-like pain that carved at his chest. “I know it is, but…one more time? For me?“ he glanced down to the silver ring, and without a second thought, slipped it on the blond’s finger—just right beside the wood-splintered one. It hurt to look at it. “For us?”
“The Aurors said that they—” the redhead’s muffled voice wavered for a bit, but he only continued further with a small choke— “they didn’t find any bodies.”
Draco’s breath caught in his throat, eyes going wide at the abrupt memory that invaded his mind. He unconsciously raised a hand to his neck, feeling the light powder of makeup shift under his turtleneck as he forced himself to walk faster through the aimless halls of the Ministry.
“You know.”
“We’re—we’re at work,” he whispered again, but couldn’t stop himself from parting his mouth in a breathless groan as teeth grazed the sensitive spot under his ear.
“Draco.”
“Don’t you fucking
Harry patiently waited as dark, lifeless greys peered up at him in fear. He waited as they took in his features, even as the shadows mostly hid them away from sight. He waited as the panic that had been painted on his face earlier vanished, taken over by confusion, then…
“Fuck, I’m so close,” Draco whispered, words stumbling out of his mouth hurriedly as his hips jerked back into the touch, making them both groan in unison.
Harry stared at him, freezing entirely in place, eyes wide as he searched the blond’s face all over. Draco shied away, thinking that maybe he should roll over so he didn’t have to deal with the embarrassment of it all—yet before he could even consider the thought, a hand snuck its way into his, flipping it over so that his palm was lightly stroked by a gentle thumb.
Draco yelped in surprise, jolting as cold gusts of wind hit his bare skin like ice. He scrambled to set himself upright, out of breath, taking a few moments to realise that Harry had single-handedly got him out of his clothes with no more than a small wave of his wrist.
Harry threw her one last look, taking in her face before he smiled—there was an etch of sadness there, he knew. “Bye, Hermione.”
He grimaced at the flame that glinted in Potter’s eyes, not realising his shoulders were tense as it died down to nothing but empty abyss.
The blond had to restrain himself from wiping the smirk off Harry's face. "Turns out my tongue's useful for other things," he clarified, noticeably checking Draco out from head to toe, "other than doing you, of course."
“Turn around.” So simple. Firm. Determined.
“Well, from the looks of it, you sound
He practically keened at the double meaning. “Yes,” whispered Draco, forgetting about what was left of his now-shattered Malfoy mask. At the moment, all he could do was think of just bolting out of the door and burying his face in his pillow to try and ignore the humiliation coursing through his body.
“Please.” Draco swallowed, his eyes falling shut as he attempted once more to push his arse down on the Potter’s finger. When the other refused, he felt a sob wrack his body. “P—please, Potter, I’d do anything, please, please—”
“—can you believe it, ‘Mione? They’re making up these stupid theories now about how Harry broke that
“Don’t you dare,
“Heads up, Malfoy. You have a visitor.”
“You know damn well for what.”
But Draco kept silent, willing his body not to squirm against the look that the raven threw at him—dark and so, so promising.
Ron’s face turned a pale shade of green. “You did it on his—” he coughed, rubbing small circles on his temples. “I don’t even want to know. Just—just tell Malfoy, but do it gently."
He felt Potter lick his earlobe slowly, tantalizingly. Draco’s head thumped against the wall as he let his eyes close, the tiny whine that left his lips hanging in the air.
“You don’t leave in the middle of a lap-dance, Malfoy,” Potter mused slyly, helping himself to a wicked grin when Draco couldn’t answer right away, his mind too hazy and distracted in the growing
“You’re joking.”
Hot, untamed magic thrummed in his veins as it tore through him, dancing on his fingertips with merciless rage. Harry only stilled as the echo of shattered iron and snapped chains clashed to the floor.
Harry hummed quietly, a melancholy tune on his tongue as he took the other’s hands in his—he always found them pretty. Even as cuts littered the blond’s ashen skin, and dried gashes tore his palms.
your hickeys?”
Silence overtook the cell.
Of course, that was until they’d look at the time and realise it was probably best that they go to bed.
another sneeze came out of Draco, and he stuck his bottom lip out in irritation; if anything, it made him look almost child-like. “I am not some
He could’ve sworn that he saw the warden’s nose scrunch up a bit, and even if he tried, he wouldn’t have been able to keep in the flame of annoyance that flickered inside him. She took him in for a quick once-over before casting a wordless spell.
Now, Harry comes home so late that the other didn’t have any choice but to give in to the sweet lulls of sleep that pulled him in. Sometimes, Draco wouldn’t see him for days, and their house would look untouched as if no one’s ever step foot in it—the only proof that Harry has been there would be the scattered sticky-notes on the walls, but even then…
“Coming so soon?” he heard Harry murmur above him, low and gravelly.
Draco, having already sat on his chair, stiffly crossed his leg over the other. He didn’t answer him for the first few moments as he wandlessly shut the door close, knowing there was a pair of bright green eyes staring at him intently.
Draco turned a murderous shade of red, and even more so when he let his own words sink in. He could’ve laughed at himself at how unnaturally wrong he sounded, at how he felt a bitter taste on the back of his throat, and the way his mind clung to one desperate hope to do
Harry’s heart thundered in his chest as the woman turned back to them, a sickly-sweet smile plastered on her face. “I am deeply sorry for that—” she didn’t
But most of the spare minutes that they’d have with each other now were almost an endless repeat—one that’s been going on for
Draco drew in a careful breath as he perked his head up from the pillows, snapping back to reality when he heard a thump echo from the living room. Confusion took over his face as he looked to door expectantly, then to the clock, then back at the door.
Draco swallowed anxiously on instinct, the other’s chuckle falling to his ears like sickly-sweet liquor.
Under normal circumstances, Draco would have put his Malfoy mask back on and sneered at Potter for being so inadeptly mindless, but at the moment all he could do was stare at that flushed, red-tipped—
He swung the door open without knocking, striding as quick as he could to his own empty desk on the right side of the room, all the while keeping his head down and avoiding eye-contact with
“N—no,” gasped Draco as one strong hand came to rest on his stomach, pushing him downwards on Potter’s cock. Fuck, it was too much, he couldn’t take it any longer, he felt like he was going to be torn apart even if it felt so fucking good— “W—wait!”
“What makes you think I would?” Potter countered smoothly, sitting on the leather couch behind him in a too-composed way that made Draco stare. He looked to him, the flicker in his eyes light and delicate. “It could be our little secret—I won’t tell anyone.”
“Ah,” she hummed, noticing that his attention went elsewhere—to the two aurors that stood by her side. “Boys, why don’t you take a short break for now? I’ll handle it from here.”
He secretly felt blessed that there were no important Auror cases to be dealt at the moment, because if it were otherwise, then Draco was more than certain that a bit of sweat was all it took to reveal what really was beneath Pansy’s lavish concealer.
wait later.
Harry couldn’t help a dry chuckle. “Yeah, well…” he felt shame settle on his shoulders, with how long the other man must’ve been waiting in this rotten cell—and all so suddenly, his throat felt too tight. “I figured it was time.”
Draco halted, too shocked to stop the sudden choke that spilled out of him, his cheeks turning a darker shade of red as he fumbled over his own loss of words. “What—what the
A whole five minutes must’ve passed, maybe even more, because he suddenly heard Potter musing above him, “Have you fallen asleep?”
you—you
that’s—that’s
Without noticing, Harry sneaked his hand down to his waist, stroking the pale flushed skin that went taut there ever-so-slightly. “What do you think, love?”
Potter threw him a look, one that no longer had the arrogant smirk that it had earlier—instead, it was replaced with a dark, riled stare that buried beneath the blond’s skin, noticing the way he swallowed in the timid tension.
“I’d like to inform you that my partner had been kind enough to—to leave only a few marks,” Draco snapped, hating how he stuttered at the last part as a flustered heat brought a flame to his cheeks.
“Haha, okay, you won’t mind if I just talk to Harry here for a bit, yeah?” the redhead laughed in a tight voice, obviously distraught by whatever Potter told him. Draco couldn’t help but gape incredulously as Weasley dragged the poor man in the direction of the exit by his tie.
“To hell with that,” interrupted Harry, his voice thick and low. When Draco’s eyes rose to meet his, his breath caught in his throat at the serious, shadowed stare that peered back. “I haven’t had you for two weeks because of this upcoming test, and I’m currently in the mood to fuck my boyfriend senseless tonight.”
Harry didn’t know when he shut his eyes, but he did—and he had only realised when he felt delicate fingertips brush over his cheek, whilst a scarred palm rose up to his dark, unkempt hair. He let the blond play with it, his grey eyes sparkling with amusement as the strands broke apart.
“Mr. Potter?”
Draco caught it with one hand, unblinking. He neatly folded it to one side, cursing Potter quietly for ruining the organised pleats. He hastily let his Slytherin green cloak slip from his shoulders, revealing a silver shirt of silk and black trousers beneath.
Harry kissed him.
The stern hold that he had on Draco’s silken hips became dangerously still, and the rest of the blond’s remarks instantly died on his tongue. He had wanted to see just how far Potter could be pushed over the edge—just how much it took to make Potter
Harry’s heartbeat could’ve dropped, and even if it did, he showed no emotion as to what she told him. He only walked slightly faster to keep up with her pace, and with one long breath, whispered— “How much food do they get every day?”
He made the mistake of locking his eyes with Potter’s amused ones, only for his gaze to slip all the way down, his breath hitching as he saw the stiff cock that sat upright, resting on his clothed stomach whilst tiny beads of pre-cum trickled down, soiling the thin fabric with a dribble of white.
“So fucking perfect,” growled Potter, using one hand to keep the Slytherin’s head against the wall whilst the other gripped his hips. Draco tried to keep quiet by biting his lips roughly, but Potter’s perfectly aimed thrusts hitting the little nub inside him was enough to make his dignity shatter.
Draco didn’t trust himself to speak.
That was until Potter unexpectedly nudged his thigh between the blond’s trembling legs, hoisting it upwards so that the other could

“Stop
Draco’s eyes narrowed, wringing her prying hands away from his face, blatantly ignoring the small voice in his head that told him the female Slytherin had a fair point. What if he
“What did you say?”
But what made his eyes widen the tiniest bit was when a soft groan came from the other. Was Potter uncomfortable? Should he stop?
Every voice in his head screamed wrong, that this was
The blond’s body instantly jolted, a hitched moan leaving him as he thrusted back into the flushed cock that stay inside him.
“I’m sorry,” Harry murmured again, gently taking the hand that rested on his hair as he held it for his own. The wrist was lithe, whilst the knuckles were tainted with a flushed red—he wondered if it was because Draco had tried to claw his way out before, refusing to take one blink of sleep until exhaustion crept up on him.
all in. “I take it that your day didn’t go as planned?”
“Have you not tried a comb while I was gone?”
Any human who stayed in here would be driven insane.
“D—do you actually want me to—to do
to you? This is a waste of my time, I’m better off doing something else—hell, I don’t even know how I can still
Harry smirked pleasantly against his cheek, right before his tongue went on with a savage, hungry rhythm, his hands holding an iron-grip on Draco’s shaking thighs to keep him from squirming as he let out another muffled moan.
Harry abruptly withdrew his fingers, wet and gleaming from saliva under the faint lamplights. Draco groaned, burying his face further into ink-splattered parchment, his cheeks hot. He dropped his right hand to the edge of the table, reaching down to fondle his throbbing cock, slick with the tiny pearl of pre-cum that leaked out.
“Fuck you,” breathed Draco as Potter quietly chuckled at him, right before throwing his head back with a stifled moan when a wet tongue lapped at his throat, its pace brutal as bruises bloomed under harsh teeth. The nails that locked unto his hips only went deeper, not enough to actually hurt the blond, but painful enough to warn him.
Draco’s skin felt like there was fire licking at him in slow, torturous taunts, thrumming in his veins with the power to tear him apart as each small touch made his body tremble in sensitivity. Wet lashes blinked as another soft, strangled moan fell from his lips, voice raspy and shattered when Potter slammed in one more time, his eyes rolling back with a cry.
He didn’t stop Harry from tilting his chin up, exposing his milk-white throat, still stark with the red-rimmed hickeys that Harry himself had left a few nights back. Draco’s breath stuttered, his eyes hurriedly darting to the abandoned notes on his study table, only to have that train of thought end when Harry started planting wet, open-mouthed kisses on his neck and up his jaw.
Ron gaped at him, his eyes wide as his ill-addled brain struggled to string one line of words together. “But you—I was—oh, that is
They stayed like that for a while, their chests rising and falling in a mellow pattern as time ticked by. He melted in the comfortable silence that filled in the shallow breaths they took, only disrupted once stern knocks echoed by the door.
So, Draco nodded. Still and carefully blank. “Just me.”

sound he had just made.
it was too fast—how could’ve it been so fast?
Potter made a sound, a noise that was low in his chest—and when Draco glanced to him in faint concern, he felt as if all the confidence that had been in him earlier wavered into nothing. In the raven’s eyes, the mirth that had once been there vanished, washed over instead with a blown, lust-ridden look that made him halt.
It was like an untamed fire he wished to burn in, leaving delicate tingles in its wake.
Harry fought the urge to grimace as they strolled down the poorly-lit hallway, each room having its own flat metal door with a serial number carved on it. He bit his bottom lip harshly when he saw a messy splatter of blood on one, dark enough to have been mistaken as pure black.
What he hadn’t expected was for the other to suddenly slip the rest of his finger in, all the way to the knuckle, making Draco jerk as he whimpered.
“Come on,” Harry whispered, quiet and tranquil. “Use your words.”
Draco’s breath stuck in his throat as a hand slipped into his in slight concern, but he only tapped three times in hurried pace in a desperate attempt to continue. Potter cast him a smile of gentle encouragement, just as the dark gleam in his eyes returned, replaced with a look that
He felt Potter smirk against him. Bastard. “So, what were you trying to say earlier?”
“I’m not mad at you,” the raven hurriedly put in, his head perking up from the pillows almost in an instant, eyebrows knitted together in evident worry.
Harry? I don’t want to be tired anymore, it’s…” Draco swallowed, his voice cracking, “…it’s
“Fuck, Potter,
Draco let out a breath he hadn't realised he was holding, his lips pulling into a tired smile. "Gods, Harry, I thought you were . . ." he trailed off, staring at his boyfriend, who was diligently taking off his invisibility cloak. "Wait—you're
“What is it, ‘Mione?” he forced out, harshly biting his inner cheek.
"Oh, come
he looked as well—with curled strands of black hair sprawled all over his forehead, just above darkened eyes that misted over his body with a sparkling hunger. “Three if you wanna continue.”
Potter tilted his head at him, and Draco suddenly realised that he was waiting for an answer as he quickly rushed for one, stumbling at his own words. “I—I do,
Those don’t appear as often anymore too.
Draco squirmed for a moment, trying to make himself relax and nestle into the other’s arms properly—and Harry must’ve sensed his distress, because he made a soft grunt of his own and rubbed slow, delicate circles on the blond’s pale skin with a gentle caress to soothe him into settling down.
Potter didn’t even blink. “Take the shirt off, Malfoy.” He cocked his head at him, his darkening eyes glinting and feral. Hungry. Starving. An invitation that could possibly turn things around for the both of them.
“I’m afraid I have no clue of what you’re talking about,” said Draco, his voice cracking when he attempted to try and sound nonchalant. He turned away, sniffling. “Now, if you excuse me, I have paperwork to finish.”
instead of an actual
As if the gods didn't want to embarrass him enough, Draco jolted in his chair, right before his eyes narrowed skeptically. "Who's there?"
built with a boldness that they always had for each other.
he pleaded.
hissed Draco, hating how his voice stumbled a bit as his face glowed a warm, embarrassed red. “You’re fucked in the head, Potter.”
Before Harry could ask what he was up to, Draco pulled out a delicate circlet of wood that was dappled with tiny bits of blood—and atop it, was a dainty, speckled leaf. It looked tiny and fragile, as if it could easily break at any moment with just one touch.
The raven intwined their fingers and carefully lifted Draco’s hands with his, taking his time to place one feather-light kiss on each knuckle. “You are letting out an adorable air of insecurity right now.”
Draco heard himself gasp out before he could stop the name from spilling out of his lips, his mind no more but a hazy thing that focused on the firm cock that sat still inside him, shallow and deep as his toes curled. He mumbled a mantra of pleas as the grip on his hips significantly went loose, and so did the bites on his skin that were soothed with a wet tongue. “Can I—can I cum, please?”
The blond swallowed the firm knot stuck in his throat when he felt Harry pull out, the calloused palms of his hands resting on his pale thighs. “What—” he inhaled sharply, the sound of knees hitting the floor thudding in his ears. “What are you—sweet fucking
“So responsive,” said Harry fondly, licking a broad stripe on the crease of his arse, making Draco shudder. It was so perversely delightful, so unbefitting for a prim and proper Malfoy like him, but just then, he didn’t care. “Don’t clench, love.”
Draco let out a stifled whimper, and he wants to take off his gloves, tear his plush skirt apart and the rest of the ridiculous maid-fit he wore, but Potter gave him no time to think as he lifted one hand to his chin and buried his nails in without any intention of being gentle. The blond let out a stuttered cry, forced to sit still as he breathed harshly through his nose.
Potter glanced at him thoughtfully. “Ah.” And the bastard, the utterly imbecilic bastard, ran his gaze down the Slytherin’s Quidditch-clad body noticeably. “Practicing laps?”
“Hm.” Potter smiled kindly at him, humming low in his throat as he trailed a rough-padded finger over each of Draco’s marks. He did it carefully, touching every single one with a gentle thumb, knowing which ones to press harder on to make the blond’s breath hitch.
“Potter—
“Well, since the first month I was thrown in here, I’ve been working on a little something too,” said Draco rather pleasantly, but before he could do anything else, a painful cough wracked out of him—enough to have his weak frame trembling once more.
The raven smiled crookedly at him. “With me? In the Gryffindor dorms?”
“You’re right,” said Potter quietly, every word right and measured, “I just meant that I’m here, you know? As a…as a friend. You can tell me anything or nothing at all—I don’t care.”
Draco’s pink-tipped knees shook, and he realised the only reason he hasn’t fallen was because one of his thighs were being lifted by Potter’s arm. “Don’t—don’t call me that.”
When the door swung open with a near-silent creak, the raven’s eyebrows shot up, evidently impressed as his gaze travelled up and down. Draco didn’t hesitate to glare at him through narrowed eyes, as if to threaten him if he dared do anything.
Potter seemed surprised for no more than a second before a laugh bellowed from his throat, filled with a wicked delight. “Gods,” he choked on himself, grinning at him. “I never knew I’d
“What’s there to talk about?” said Draco flatly, looking away before letting out a short bitter laugh. “You made it clear you’re marrying Weaslette in about a week. Congrats, by the way.”
of this was innocent.
That was what Harry told himself as he painted the world in bright, white-hot flames.
It wasn’t often that he became self-conscious, especially about his type of fashion—it was just that it wasn’t really popularly known that he, Draco Malfoy, rumored Death-Eater heir, expert Auror and Potioneer in the Ministry, wore soft
He could tell that the blond was ready to shake his head, most likely to argue back with him and refuse—but just then, Draco let out a tiny, kitten sneeze that left him shaking in the other’s arms.
“And this is why I can’t leave you alone for another minute,” Harry mused half-heartedly, though the anxiety in his tone was not pushed aside. “I’ll go get a warm blanket for you real quick, okay? The bed’s too far away, so you could just rest here.”
Potter?” he said in utter disbelief, his breath catching in his throat.
he demanded. “I do not want to discuss my sex life with you.”
“I could tie you to your bed for one week straight and you’d still get perfect marks in every subject,” countered Harry smoothly, towering over his desk in nonchalance, as if he hadn’t just directly glanced at Draco to see him flush pink.
“Oh, come on now, Potter—who else would it be?” Draco scowled, flicking his narrowed eyes to the other man before shaking his head glumly. “Should’ve known. It doesn’t matter, anyway.”
they’d take this little game of theirs—Draco tentatively rolled his hips, slow and tantalising. And even though the satin ruffles of his skirt prevented him to see anything else from underneath, he could’ve sworn that he felt something clothed and hard stir against his skin.
said Draco softly, curling in on himself as he glanced away—almost ashamed of the words that stumbled out of his mouth next. “I was just thinking that you… well,
“Okay, okay, fine! Even if you kick me out, you’re still my best friend, and what am I if not a good saint to help you heal your…” she paused, a hint of a smirk on her lips. “…bruises?”
Draco smiled to himself; perfect quiet. He neatly placed his quill on the side, savouring every second of silence that ticked by, then—
Draco gasped out, and everything tilted. The scorching fire that burned his skin was gone, melting into darkness. All white noise blanked out of his head, and all he could feel were steady arms holding him with a familiar sort of gentleness. No one ever did that to him. No one other than …
“Po—Potter!” Draco tried to break his wrists free, but Potter had an ironclad grip on him. Little sparks of pleasure arose and went straight to his erection as Potter continued his ministrations, swirling the soft skin of his earlobe before roughly diving back in repeatedly.
“Use your words,” Potter told him softly, a small smirk tugging at the corner of his lips as a faint noise broke from the other’s throat. Draco hopelessly tried to shift his hips so that the raven’s finger would curl up just right where he wanted it, but Potter kept pulling back with a sinister chuckle.
Draco was helpless to stop the little, wrecked mewl that left him, only serving to satisfy the other’s hunger for more.
Draco’s eyes slipped shut as he felt the hard length push in, his thighs shaking. “Fuck,” he whispered, “fuck, Potter,
“Does it look like I care?”
“Answer me, Malfoy.” The finger circled his pink rim, and whenever he thought it would push in, Potter would pull away and prolong the blond’s torment.
Draco tried to lead the wet, sloppy kiss, taking advantage of his higher position as he tilted his head down until their noses were painfully pressed against one another. Potter only chuckled in his mouth, the sound low and muffled just before the grip on the blond’s hair finally tightened and
“Could care less about that,” said Weasley flippantly, waving him off with a light shake of his hand. “But seriously—is it Matching Couples Day or something, or did you two both wear matching turtlenecks on purpose?”
“Look, I … I realised it was a mistake,” said Potter quietly, his words no more than a void to Draco’s ears. Empty. Hollow. “I just felt like there were—there were so many things, going on at once, and I didn’t know what to do.”
“Hey, look at me,” Harry slipped under the blanket as well, lifting it with one hand so that they were almost completely beneath it—only if it weren’t for the shred of light that fell on one of Draco’s eyes, making it seem like a silver pool of mercury, looking back at him with a hint of self-doubt that appeared once more.
his nails digging roughly into silken hips. He knees felt weak as they gave in, a quiet whine spilling from his lips as he couldn’t help a jerk of his hips against the touch. A furious heat rose in his cheeks from the lewd sound that just escaped him, and Potter must’ve heard it too, because he had thrown the blond a smug little look before leaning over to his flushed cheek.
After a moment of serene quiet, with Draco’s eyes almost fluttering shut, he managed a low murmur. “Why’d you come home so early?”
Draco’s breath hitched, taken aback. “Even when I look like this?”
Gathering his courage, his voice painfully strained, he mumbled, “I’m fine.”
“Fuck,” he mumbled, hating how he instinctively bared his neck for him, to show Potter, because he wanted
with—with those things!” he bit back, defensively raising a hand to play with the fabric of his own turtleneck, as if to protect himself.
Right.
Draco wanted to say that he wasn’t in his right state of mind, that this was him and no other, but the way that Potter looked at him like that told him that he knew; knew that this was all achingly
“Don’t—” Draco tried to close his legs, but all he could focus on was how the other was thumbing at his slit, and how he leaned in to pull the desirous Slytherin into a kiss.
“Don’t ever do that again.” His voice was muffled by the sound of his quiet sniffles and the shift of velvet blankets. “Please.”
let so much as a headache get to him, especially when he’s always taken care of himself pretty well.
“Eyes up here,” snapped Potter, pulling the distracted Slytherin out of his thoughts. Draco was slightly mortified to find his cheeks heating as the raven softened his tone. “Would you mind leaving me alone now?”
“Oh, nothing important,” said the redhead cheerily. “Just here to tell you that my mum invited you to the Burrow for dinner tonight.”
“I—” he swallowed, trying to focus on the emerald eyes that peered down at him as his mind screamed for
Hermione gasped out a pained curse, her eyes shut tight as she hissed under her breath. Harry instantly rushed over as his eyes widened, quickly throwing a glance to see what she tripped over—a thin thread of magic, lined up on the stone floor with a flutter of dark purple.
“Look at you. So perfect for me.” Draco’s mouth parted slightly, reaching a hand to provide the attention his dripping cock needed. Potter noticed it right away, gripping the blond’s delicate wrist in warning. “Don’t touch yourself unless I say so.”
Malfoy, or you’re not coming at all.”
“You’d think that the Deputy Head of the Ministry would know about the safety spells in Azkaban,” the warden said with a tiny, tight-lipped smile as she threw an innocent look back at them. “Turns out I was wrong.”
Another gasp left him as crimson pain trailed under the other’s fingertips, and Potter took his chance to slip in two fingers inside the warm heat of his mouth. Draco struggled, choking for breath, but a sudden hand that snuck from behind and pulled a fistful of his golden strands made his back arch, a sweet moan falling from his lips as his body couldn’t do anything but melt in the iron-like hold.
Draco raised his head from his hands shakily, wide eyes blinking up at him. “Potter.”
Draco faltered, the tips of his ears burning fiercely.
“I know a place where no one would ever find us,” whispered Harry into his parted mouth, his voice low as a hand gently slid to his face. “No more wars, no more prisons. You’ll never be alone again.”
“Do you remember yet?” Potter murmured, low and careful. Draco’s toes curled, trying to gather enough of his wits to retort back a snarky comment—but when Potter spoke in that deep, timbre tone, all that left him was a tiny and pathetic,
Potter smiled at him sweetly. “You’re coming on nothing but my cock, Malfoy, so why don’t you turn around for me like a good boy?”
Dinners no longer existed, as far as the blond could recall—they used to order cheap food from Muggle inns that usually went with priceless, red wine, and then they would swap a tirade of ridiculous stories of how both their days went.
at a drunken bar.
The blond went crimson, knowing that out of context, their conversation was not one for the innocent. “What does it matter to you?” he muttered under his breath, ignoring the faint ringing in his ears.
“That,” the blond said irritably, flicking his wrist in Potter’s direction. The other man murmured a faint ‘oh’ as the sound of fingers drumming against wood finally ceased, leaving the air still and empty.
. . . it wasn’t just his life on the line.
His eyes went to Harry’s hand almost instantly, only to find there was no bejeweled ring on it.
The table let out a dangerous creak forwards, digging into Draco’s skin harshly as Harry gave him one last, powerful thrust with a groan of his own. Draco cried out, his back sweltering and hitting Harry’s as they came, rough and brimming with a thrill that made another sob rip out from his throat.
“I didn’t—” he spluttered, defensively trying to cover himself up, “no one
Potter didn’t even react, pulling away from him easily with a shrug. “As you wish.” Before Draco could even snap back a snarky retort, the Gryffindor grabbed a thick maroon towel, throwing it to him knowing that the other could catch it.
“At least I’m not some masochist who likes having their parts
Harry realised she was analysing—thinking of the steel-faced guards that were silent as they walked, the soft wails of anguish that sounded way too human-like, the heavy spells that wrapped around the prison like a blanket.
That was until his knees gave out entirely, too weak to hold him up, making Draco let out a shattered cry that was torn from his strained throat as he bottomed out completely. He could’ve sworn that he whited out for a moment, eyes rolling to the back of his head as another moan spilled out of him, but all he heard was a leering laugh.
“Don’t you look
But he also wanted to play a little game first, because who was he, if not a Slytherin to the very core?

his idea) and shunted them to the side.
“You fucking—” he was almost certain his tears had already fallen, slipping down his face and running with the sweat that swathed his skin. “—you
he swore at himself, knowing just what he had done when Potter started laughing—a mocking, low sound that arose from his chest.
Just to see what Potter would do, exactly—just to see how
It went like that for a while—with the raven slipping out of his uniform attire, and Draco sitting there in a warm heap of blankets as he beheld the other with a wide-eyed gaze. It wasn’t until did Harry come over, plopping on their bed and lightly nudging for the blond to move so he could get in as well, did Draco turn a lovely shade of pink as he shifted a bit to offer some space.
“Malfoy?” The black-haired boy turned around so sharply that he knocked a lavender-scented soap down onto the tiled floor with a wet thud.
A whirl of embarrassment and white-hot arousal stirred within Draco, filling in the empty gaps in his head and vaguely constructing unwanted images that he’d rather not think about. He had only meant to take a nice warm shower after taking a few laps around the Quidditch pitch in the middle of the night, but he certainly hadn’t expected Potter of all people to be there.
“But something tells me—” Draco turned away from his papers, completely facing the other man this time, his eyes careful and calculative— “that you know who he is.”
Then, the familiar click of heels reached her.
The blond glanced to him, letting his tired body decide for him as he huddled closer, making a satisfied noise in the back of his throat as strong arms immediately curled around his lithe frame. He laid his head on one, with a hand from behind gently playing with tufts of platinum hair, whilst the other settled on the small curve of his back.
Potter grinned—a sadistic sort of grin, the bastard—as his shadowed gaze fell to the blond’s veiled neck, just like his own. “Turns out turtlenecks are great at hiding things, huh?”
at the flustered blond.
Harry had never seen him look so
“Theories?” Hermione didn’t turn, swallowing down the knot that stuck in her throat as she set down her cup. “What theories?”
Draco cracked an eyelid open, inanely wondering how he managed to find himself in Harry Potter’s arms, of all people. His lips parted to speak, to let out a single sound or maybe even curse the Gryffindor to hell, but nothing came out. His cheeks flushed.
Harry chuckled at him, just before stealing another kiss to his flustered boyfriend’s lips. “I know.”
“Potter,” he tried, his voice no more but a broken rasp to his ears as Potter hummed back, blatantly ignoring him as his hand went further and further, to the small of his back then to the clothed cleft of his arse. Draco let out a soft whine and bucked his hips up, clearly irritated as Potter took his careful time to pull at the fabric of his knickers.
Draco tried to come up with a response, maybe a witty comeback as he always did in their worthless banter, but nothing left his lips as they parted to speak. It wasn’t often that he was left speechless, but with Potter watching him and his every move like that, the emerald greens in his eyes long gone—he can’t help but feel pinned
Instead, there would be times when Draco would wake up with nothing but flicks of cold on Harry’s side of their bed. All he could rely on left was the earthly scent that lingered on his pillows—which was a rather pathetic realisation that dawned on him a few days back—and if he was lucky enough, then he’d get a kiss or two to his forehead.
For a different
But when thick, blank silence came to greet him, Draco was forced to look up in annoyance—only for his eyes to widen in pure shock as he
exactly, does she want me there?” he croaked out.
Usually, Draco wasn’t one to catch the flu, nor have the serious case of an upset stomach. Everyone knew that out of all people, the blond would be the last one to
Draco was careful with how he moved, and he was very aware of how vulnerable he must look at that moment. His shirt happened to be long enough to brush against his thighs, covering at least half of what he hoped was not hard from just the sight of the black-haired boy. Draco cursed for not having his wand with him; if only he’d known he would have company in the showers, then he would’ve brought the one thing he could use to defend himself.
He looked away.
Draco trembled, his lips parting in a shallow attempt to push his boyfriend away, only to let out a soft, tremulous moan when he felt a sensitive spot under his ear being stroked wetly.
Hermione shoved away the guilt as she walked to him, slowly, and held out her arms.
from alright.
Hermione’s breath stumbled, her heart thumping too loudly for her own ears. She decide to stay silent, holding Ron there in her arms, whispering comfort to not only calm him—but herself. They both needed it.
His lips stretched around the calloused skin of Potter’s fingers as he fucked his mouth, unforgiving and brutal and
Potter let out a raspy groan as the blond came all over his hand, a splatter of thick white into his palm as his hold on his waist slackened for a short moment. Draco’s shaking body went pliant as the hand curled around him again just as quickly, pulling him closer into each heavy thrust as the raven no longer bothered to be graceful with every little graze over the warm nub inside the breathless blond.
He shivered against another lash of cold, too late to stop himself from mumbling off-handedly, “Those don’t come off that easily, Potter.”
“Weasley,” said Draco tightly, wincing a little. Using every tactic and maneuver his father had taught him about proper pureblood manners, he offered the redhead a pained smile. “Your tie’s wrinkled.”
He was too busy kissing him to notice the emerald ring Harry had slipped on his finger.
The blond hid away sheepishly. “Thank you.”
“Potter,” he mumbled, trembling again as Potter pulled out slowly, his eyes dark with a sparked arousal. Draco’s breath hitched, the tips of his ears burning in humiliation as the other stared at him expectantly, raising an eyebrow as he gently twisted his finger around, crooking it perfectly to make the blond roll his eyes back with a broken moan.
