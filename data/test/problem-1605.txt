"Back then," I breathed. "It'd happened a few times with the Dursley's," I said. "It's the food." He nodded in understanding.
"What's wrong?" I said. My face showed curiosity and concern. He turned back around to face me again, and I studied his features. His face seemed to be expressing... pain? Tiredness? Sadness? It left me more confused than I had been previously. He took a deep, faint, slow breath, before speaking.
It hurts to see you in pain, Harry. Please, you cannot be afraid to talk to me. Be afraid of anything else, just not that. I hate not knowing if you're okay, Harry."
"...Has Wendy come out yet?" We looked around for him, but eventually shook our heads to Bonnie's question.
"Harry, I... I understand, but the prophet will reach everyone, including those who are doing this in the first place. They're already doing everything they can to not be found... disappearing without a trace... it's better to deal with this quietly."
After a second or so, he seemed to regain his bearings and looked up at me, before leaving to the bathroom. I stayed where I stood, watching him wash out his mouth from across the hall. I looked around, taking in my surroundings for the first time. Harry's glasses were set over legal papers, with Ginny's signature at the bottom. His wand was on the far right of the desk, and scattered around were various letters.
"Oh, that Muggle sport. Well, I have some time to kill before quidditch," she started before Wendy cut her off.
"But let's put some music on! To get us in shape for tonight, right?" I looked back at John, and he only stared back and shook his head. I grimaced, but I went on with it anyway, for some reason. I turned back to Gabriel. "Let's see here..."
"Hey, look at me, everything is okay. Look at me, we need to relax." He held me by the shoulders, and I gripped him tightly, getting a bout of lightheadedness. I felt a hand go to my chest, making me twitch.
I dragged myself to Platform 9 3/4 the following September first, and, much to Teddy's dismay, I was as quick as possible, noting the eyes that landed on us four the second we arrived- the whispers- the suspicion. Draco took my hand and squeezed reassuringly before apparating us, insisting
"It just looks like a full house to me. I mean, there's people in the kitchen, people on the couch, people outside..." he said, looking around.
In an instant, the quaffle was thrown, and a massive wave or cheers washed over the stadium. The players took to the skies, immediately getting to work.
When I opened my eyes she was long gone. I realized that Aminata probably never even realized I was in this compartment. Not with the rush of kids racing to sit with their friends. I decided to keep myself the way I was- red hair and all. Maybe if her posse doesn't recognize me, they won't pick on me.
We were stood in front of the front door of the neighbors house, Harry stood off to the side, close to me. Our hands were intertwined.
"Forget Shacklebolt. You took this case out of the good will of your heart. He answers to your demands, and if he has a problem with you putting your mental health above something that should have been fixed by his Aurors long ago, then he'll have to answer to me." My voice pierced through the air, carrying an almost threatening ring to it, against Shacklebolt. Harry didn't respond, so I softened my hard-set face, turning my attention away from the angering circumstances, and towards Harry.
"I have to get home... so I'll see you around... okay?" I eyed him wondering if this was the right thing to do. He didn't respond for a second, then he got up and went towards me. We made eye contact and held it for a bit.
After that, we were both laying in bed peacefully. He was playing with my hair, and I was just laying there, relaxed.
I rubbed my chin, distracting myself by feeling the newly grown stubble on it. I need to shave soon.
"Are we going to tell the public that we're basically preparing for..." the words got stuck in my throat. "Are we..."
We all went home as the sun set, and Scorpius practically collapsed on the sofa bed with Teddy, exhausted. Hermione said that she had written the essay, and was ready for it to be sent off to the Ministry. We told her about the Dragon challenge, as well as the many butterbeers, and the group of teenagers we ran upon.
Things have calmed down significantly since then, and he slept through this past night, which was surprising to me- he hasn't been sleeping much lately, but then again, neither have I.
"The rumors had already started by then. I know people thought of me, and still think of me, as a werewolf. A monster. So it said in the
"Okay, good. Now, I've been working on something for you to try," He looked at me, by now, the only tears on his face were dried. "It's something to help you sleep without waking up." I clarified. Do you want to try that?" He nodded.
My eyes kept opening and closing, tears just on the brim. I kept taking shallow, jagged breaths, and everything felt hot and uncomfortable. I choked back a whimper, and at the moment I just wanted to be on the floor, my surroundings didn't matter anymore. Slowly I was welcomed by the presence of cold, polished hardwood. I felt a hand on my arm, just there.
I blinked, reaching over to turn off the faucet, before grabbing a towel and stepping out. It was when I opened the shower's curtain and the cool air hit that I felt the angry burn of hot water and far too much scrubbing over such a long period of time. I glanced at myself in the mirror. My skin looked dry and burnt, and it felt raw and itchy, especially in the areas surrounding my scars. I opened the door for Draco.
It was a bit painful to deliver the news of your husband having been fatally wounded, and then not be able to properly react to the information before being wheeled in for birth.
"There's four floors; you, Teddy, and Scorpius can choose to all sleep in one room, or take separate rooms. We have more than enough space, and don't be shy to make yourself at home. We're happy to have you."
I took Draco's arm gently, and he flinched slightly before letting me guide him to the fireplace. Ron's glare never faltered. I took my wand out, and we disappeared with a pop, landing in the drawing room of Grimmauld Place. Draco stomped away furiously.
"Hi, I'm Bonnie!" She responded. "Pleasure to meet you all, but I was hoping to catch up with another friend of ours, Wendy... I'll see you on the train, Teddy."
I tossed the tomato slices into the bowl of salad that was prepared, then reached toward the cabinet for 3 bowls to put the soup we made.
Hermione answered the phone after only a few rings. I was standing outside of the bathroom, waiting for Harry to finish changing into a hospital gown.
"I should have paid more attention. How could I have missed somebody watching me, looking inside of me, all my life... all to make a stupid bloody story..."
I walked through the bedroom door and looked around, following the sound of the familiar voices of Draco and Scorpius.
"Hey guys!" I sat down at the table. My breakfast appeared in front of me, which I immediately began eating. I looked up and saw Gabriel and Bonnie opposite to me, eyeing me with amusement, giggling.
"Nothing I can't handle though." He said, I wriggled to get off of him, and stood up, a small smile on my face as I thought of his antics.
"Shh, don't worry Draco. I know. We're going to figure it out. Don't worry." One of Harry's hands was passing through my hair soothingly.
Just as I was about to begin the chopping process I saw a tiny figure zoom past me to the sink. Scorpius, with a wide smile on his face, reached under the sink to get out a step-stool, and then stood on it, beginning to wash his hands. I smiled at his childlike enthusiasm, I looked to my other side to see Draco with the same smile. The smile of a proud father.
"Well, I have to go see Madam Maxime, so... See you, Ted," Victorie quipped with a mischievous glint in her eyes.
"I promise... I'm alright... thank you." I quickly got the floo powder and made my way over to the fireplace. Before stepping in, I heard the echo of her worn voice bouncing off the pearl-white walls.
"Millie insisted we wait for her, saying she wanted to have a quick shower. So she's upstairs doing that." When Dudley said the words 'upstairs' I turned my head in that direction, eyes wandering to the cupboard just under it. I snapped my head back into the conversation.
I was now directly facing Luca.. Keeping my mouth tightly closed, I looked to John, fidgeting with my robe.
"Oh, wait, Wendy. My robes for tonight!" I suddenly shouted as I shot up, and I heard a sigh from Gabriel.
"I wish things were easier. I wish I could just prove to them how much you changed and be on with life. Maybe things would be easier if we all just saw you as a friend. Though that's not the case." He said. I held back a tear at the thoughts of how I used to be, and how much work Astoria put into helping me become a better person... I remember when we promised no son of ours would be raised like we were. I sniffled, realizing I had gone into a quiet sort of cry. I felt Harry scoot close to me, and wrap an arm around me.
"We'll work through it together. I'll stop that pesky mind of yours from thinking what it does long enough for you to get something in." He said, concern written across his face. "Don't worry about Ron and Hermione. I'll tell them to come later in the day. Right now, you need rest." I felt his lips land upon my temple briefly, before a rush of cool air and the quiet sound of the door being eased shut notified me that he was indeed gone from the room. And while I kept telling myself
"Of course." As she left I took a grateful drink of the burning strong substance, allowing the feeling of numbness to take me over.
"Even after all this time, there are moments where, in the blink of an eye, in the span of half a moment, I think I'm back at school, or the battle, or the Manor. It takes me a bit to regain my bearings- wake up, remember where I am.
I stood in my place silently for a moment, debating his words, before leaving the area, all pleasantries and manners forgotten. I trekked across the house, up the winding rickety stairs of Grimmauld Place, to our room, where, to my surprise, I didn't see Harry. But, I could hear him, I could hear his struggling breaths, and his bogey clogged nose that he tried to clear as he wept. This prompted me to believe he was hiding, so, I closed the door silently, as to not be disturbed, and not startle him.
"Do you think he might be in his office?" Draco suggested, glancing at those who noticed us popping in.
"Well we can still have a day," he pushed up the glasses that were sliding down my nose. "But I don't want you pushing things away. Especially since it's clearly affected you." He weaved his hand into my hair. "You know how I feel about you crying."
"Don't use that tone with her, Draco. She's concerned," snapped Ron. "We love him just as much as you, and have every right to see him."
"Maybe you both need to check your tempers! And you need to learn to respect Harry's decisions! The things you're saying don't really help, Ron! Haven't you gotten through your head that Harry, your best friend, could have died nothing short of two weeks ago if it weren't for Malfoy?!" Ron stayed silent.
"Oh, believe me, it does." I looked up and gave him a stink eye, before sitting up normally again, turning attention to my son.
I stared at the barely written letter. Thinking about how stupid and paranoid I must sound. I'm not even the one who overheard the conversation. What am I going to tell her?
I felt a sob escape me but stopped it abruptly, holding my breath before more than the small burst of tears fell.
"You are wrong. He'd be locked up in Azkaban right now not chasing Harry like a lovesick puppy!" I explained dumbly.
bed without having showered." I said confidently. There's no way on Earth he's sleeping in my bed dirty.
My jaw clenched. "Mother, not in front of him," I responded quietly, all too aware of my son sitting beside us.
"Get that out of my face, will you?" I muttered, taking the phone and holding it further away so I could properly see.
"Psst, Ted... Slughorn's about to begin." As I snapped my head towards the Professor's desk, I stopped at the barely noticeable sight of Luca's usually vibrant hazelnut hair, now adorned with grey streaks. I furrowed my brows. Luca noticed, his eyes widened, and he looked forward at Slughorn. He looks back at me, and I gesture at my scalp with a pointed finger, hoping he would understand. He sighs, quietly tapping his finger on our shared table. "I... Before you got to the table at breakfast, I got a letter from... from my mum," he whispers. The chattering filling the room quieted, and Slughorn prepares to start his lecture. I notice a few more slivers of grey starting to appear, but Luca mouths "later."
"I ran into him in Muggle America... we began speaking, and it just, happened." I explained, glancing up at the man every so-often, growing antsy over the sound of his pen harshly scraping the paper as he wrote whatever he seemed to find so noteworthy.
"I know he does; we spoke in the hospital. He apologized too- for Fred. I didn't think I'd ever hear those words leave his mouth." Said George. After some more quiet, he spoke again.
"Well that's pretty tough isn't it Malfoy. In case you haven't realized you're the first person I've opened up to in a decade. I don't know what I'm doing and it is far from my comfort zone." He then stood up.
With a huff, I got out of bed, quietly making my way out of the room. I didn't quite know where I was going. Not until I found myself in Scorpius' room. Lettuce must have come in at some point after me, because now he was rubbing his little head against my bare feet, falling over against them and purring.
But there's always something stopping me- something dark and cruel that starts in the pit of my stomach and spreads to my heart and my brain. It tells me that there's always a chance things don't go well. There's always a chance that this isn't a good idea. There's always the chance that it's better to keep your mouth shut.
"You need to carry the four from here to here and THEN you carry the ONE from there to the hundreds place." Said Draco in an exasperated tone.
Draco was the first to take a spoonful of the stuff, muttering a "You know, this extremely unsanitary. Nobody else will be able to eat applesauce from this jar."

I woke up at roughly four in the morning and found myself wrapped up in a sort of hug with Draco. It felt warm, soothing, and comforting. I studied his features as he slept. He looked relaxed and care free. He looked happy. I smiled at the thought that he was happy. Quickly though, I remembered that I'm in my own house, and Ginny is gone. I guilt came through me at the thought of how horribly my thoughts and actions betray her, and what we had for 10 years. I carefully got out of our hug and sat leaning over the edge of my side of the bed, putting my head in my hands and sighing. Ginny doesn't deserve this. She shouldn't have to deal with this, with me. I stood up, grabbed my wand off the nightstand, and left the room. Draco doesn't deserve this either. My problems are troubling enough. I've let him in, I've caused him to have to deal with more things.
"According to my neighbor, yes. I forgot the name but it starts with the letter G." He said while crouched down by the shelves where the beans were displayed. Meanwhile Scorpius was next to him, and I was standing against the opposite shelf, constantly looking around.
"Would you like to go first?" I asked Scorpius, He looked up at me before redirecting his attention to Astoria's name, engraved on the headstone.
"I like to read- you know that. Besides, it's not what it seems. Basically, a father develops that problem and it gets so bad that he loses touch with reality." He shook his head. "But this isn't Scorpius's problem. We can't walk up to Muggles and say he's seeing things-" I cut him off.
"It's okay. You're super strong, no monsters can get you." I said, returning the hug. His nightmares have always been ones of fantasy. Monsters chasing him, usually.
On the kitchen counter was a freshly cooked dinner- beautifully roasted chicken breast, potato wedges, and steamed vegetables- and a parchment beside it, that held, in scrawny handwriting, a brief note:
"You wish you were as good as me. Merlin wishes he was as good as me," shouted Ron from the kitchen, before coming over to me and Scorpius. "Dinner's ready, why don't you eat with us?"
"Rose, how about we explore the hotel, yeah?" Ron offered his hand to Rose, gave me a sharp glance, and they left.
Now, it's roughly eleven o'clock at night, and Draco had given Scorpius a dreamless sleep potion for the first time. I watched silently by the door as Draco tucked him in, assuring that everything would be fine, and that he'd wake up to a brand new tomorrow. He stayed sitting by Scorpius' bedside, stroking his hair until he was sure that he'd fallen fast asleep.
"I-I'm not quite sure... I was stressed, I felt kind of helpless I... haven't drank since 6th year."
"This isn't good for you," he whispered. "You know that." I shut my eyes, unable to look at him. His had already fluttered closed anyway.
"Carlito, ayúdeme con esto para que pueden ver." [Carlito, help me move this thing so they can see it.] The other man, Carlito, waved him off, and took something out of his shirt pocket. I recognized it as on of those sticks.
"If I were you I'd stop struggling." He said solemnly, cutting me off. "They won't hesitate to jinx you if you keep at it." He finished, kneeling towards Scorpius with a tentative hand on his shoulder. I shuddered.
nervous for," said Draco. "I've only seen them all, what, once, twice, since everything? And I've not exactly the best track record with them."
I shut my eyes tight to avoid the written contents of the parchment. I thought I could read this but I can't. I already know what it's going to be about:
Disclaimer: this is my most graphic chapter thus far, and features detailed imagery and descriptions of self harm, self hate, and blood loss. I will put a warning where the exceptionally graphic things begin. Please read at your own risk. Stay safe, y'all.
Scorpius looked frightened. I knelt down in front of him, taking his little hands in mine, which he took back for a second.
He shut his eyes tight, and I allowed us to hug. He sobbed silently, though I could feel his body convulsing. The knowledge that he's in so much pain made me feel awful. I placed a small kiss on the crown of his head.
"No, Please. It's fine really. I'll fix us all some tea. Ron, go check on Rose please." I said, trying to hide my rising stress. Ron replied softly.
"What if... What if- can I, ask... Dr. Gilroy's opinion?" I became shy, struggling to admit that maybe she actually could help me.
"Don't scratch yourself," Draco nearly whispered, his voice careful and smooth and light like a feather. He gently weaved our fingers together, keeping his gaze at my hand which he held. "Harry, I only want you going if you feel okay with being around them."
"I wanted to tell you, but... I never knew how to. And I kept getting updates from Mum, and everything is getting worse... I don't know what to do."
The topic came up when I asked him just how many Muggle things he had done in his time in America, because he clearly had the time to get used to and good at Muggle cooking. He spoke about his time studying for a drivers license, and how it took him so long because he really didn't know enough things about how the world worked. Then, he brought up movies, and brought up 6-year-old Scorpius' obsession with Spider-Man.
"They probably loved you, Ted... and even then, the people who took care of you when they left, those people probably care about you just like if they were your parents, even when they mess up, or when they look like they could be busier with other things.
"How did he even find out? An eleven year old shouldn't know those kinds of things." I argued, feeling the itch come back.
"Is that... Did you and Mummy do that too?" I noticed Harry come over to Dada's side and sit down criss-cross next to him. Me and Dada sat down like that shortly after.
"They said that since the press secretary at the Ministry was close friends with Harry Potter before, that she made these answers up to protect him. Is... Is any of this stuff true, Teddy?"
"Nothing can ever go back to normal. But I am going to make sure the problems and the tension stop. I promise."
"What can you expect, though?" began Wendy. "The Rowles were death eaters. I'm surprised that most of them aren't in Azkaban.
I didn't ignore my hunger after that. My shaking hand picked up the spoon next to me and I ate. It was welcoming. It filled my stomach, and it made me warm. It was soft, and the flavors weren't strong, but it wasn't bland either.
Draco found it odd to be around all of the Weasleys for the second time in his life. He kept muttering to himself, saying it's for Scorpius, or it's for me. There were times where we found our hands drifting together, and though everyone knew about us to some extent, excluding the children, it felt inappropriate, and almost rude to show any sort of affection in front of the family, especially when you could hear the obvious hesitance in everyone whenever they asked about us, if they even asked about us.
And of course, we kids were not worried about our parents- well, I wasn't... but we didn't mind leaving the house. Maybe parents secretly do mind it. Maybe they just wish they could hold on to every last bit of their child's dependence on them as they can.
"Oh it will go away- you will be able to control it again one day- I promise. It will just take A little bit of time." I let go of the hug, letting him sit in front of me. I wiped the tears from his pink face.
"Harry remember your medicine please. With food. I have to go off to work early today. And I may be back late as well." I nodded as I turned to face her and groaned.
I heard her sob from the other line. My mind started racing, thinking of who could have been sent to the hospital.
"That's adorable, Scorpius" I said with a fond smile, ruffling the hair on his head, which he tried to stop, smiling proudly.
I would be lying if I didn't say that I felt at least a dash of pride knowing that Teddy trusted me more than anyone else, except maybe Scorpius. I honestly don't know how it happened, especially when I was so ignorant of his needs when I had him. But, I was proud and grateful, and I wanted to be there for him now in any way that I could, without pushing myself too far again.
"It's stupid, really. I'm being stupid... he didn't do anything wrong." He admitted. I furrowed my brows.
It was all of this while that I was finally piecing it all together, that Harry finally muttered- minutely, really almost inaudibly: "It's overwhelming."
"I didn't go to St. Mungo's; it was a Muggle place," I corrected. Then, I hesitated. Teddy took this as a yes, and I silently cursed myself for not being able to answer him more quickly. His hair quickly changed between a sickly grey, and yellow, before he glanced up at it, and shook his head, forcing it teal again.
"The letter you got yesterday was from your Muggle relatives?" I tensed, before nodding in agreement.
"The medicine will help you feel better, come on. You can lay back down after you take it." I flopped around and looked at him with a bothered expression. His expression was a pleading one. I slowly rose, feeling my heaviness attempt to push me down and the fuzziness in my brain swirl and settle to the bottom of my mind, before taking my meds, and taking a sip of water, carefully positioning my arms in a way so he couldn't see my new scars. The ones flooded with guilt from going behind his back and not telling him. I laid back down.
"Okay, that's understandable. Well, our time here is almost out, but. Just before we wrap things up, let's go over your homework." I raised an eyebrow, looking at her. "Find an outlet for your feelings that isn't harmful. Next time we see each other, tell me how it went."
"It wasn't anything complicated, but the packaging insists that I use flour to make sure it doesn't stick."
It wasn't long before the blood was magically cleaned from my hand and arm, as well as the photo on the bed, and my clothes. Draco was cradling me gently, passing a worried hand through my hair in an attempt to calm me.
"Harry, I want to ask you another thing in private." She said, not waiting for a response as she dragged me back to the room.
I opened my eyes for the briefest of moments, trying to assess whether I'd imagined it or not. Draco opened his eyes too, stopping our snog, but quickly recovered.
"Dada!" We all turned to the direction of Scorpius and Rose who were both running towards the table where we were all sat. "Rose is hungry." He said, before leaning in and whispering something else to Draco. Then, he said aloud again: "When are we going to have lunch?" I froze.
Granger, Weasley, and I stood in quite the uncomfortable position, having to listen to Harry tell Teddy something that nobody was sure to be the truth, and now, his wife stood a few feet in front of the lot of us, giving Harry a heartbroken stare. I noticed she awkwardly scratched an itch on her arm.
"Please. It will help me know how to help you." He said. He then stopped our hug, making deliberate space between us. I felt a rush of
"Draco! Come on in, the kids are playing in the back yard." Said Maria, welcoming me into the house.
"Am I one of those mistakes?" I heard him say under his breath. It was as if he had just driven a stake through my heart.
One of her friends quickly grabbed her arm. "No, Jill... these two aren't worth it. Let's just leave, okay?" She threw a furtive glance at me.
I closed the door, taking a hearty gulp of my water, before making my way to the guest room, where Harry still insisted we sleep.
"You really are awesome though." He continued. "Don't worry though, I know that, they just won't get to be your friend." I gave another light laugh. If Rita Skeeter hadn't started those rumors, maybe I would have some other friends.
"Maria? What did she do? What happened to her?" Asked an absolutely frantic Scorpius, who was, quite understandably, scared out of his wits as Ron held him almost protectively by the shoulders, and Draco was, well, still in a full body bind, laying on the floor where Auror Berrycloth had so carelessly put him. If it weren't for the constant spinning of my head and hiding my now more-than-common shaking, I would have started a fight with him on the spot. I looked over at Auror Williamson, who still had both mine, and Draco's wands in his hand, standing proudly in his spot. I wanted to wipe the look on his face clean-off, but I could barely even handle the excruciatingly nauseating Floo trip we took over here.
"Still any day, it's honestly a bit nerve wracking, waiting for the baby to come. Even if I have dealt with it before," I chuckled. Mordecai patted me on the back.
I mentally cursed the state I was in, aware that every second I spent bumming out in my bed was a second I wasted by not preparing for Ron and Hermione's soon anticipated arrival.
"You had notes all over the bloody thing! On the margins, on your sticky notes, flags sticking out of all ends; It was madness!" I shot back in defense. She sighed, leaning over the counter and massaging her forehead with her hands.
"Why do I hurt myself and make myself remember all of the bad things?" He said, sniffling at the end. I wasn't sure how to answer.
"Why can't I control my pee-pee?" He asked, sniffling in- I was sure there was a bit of bogeys on the shoulder of my shirt where his head was resting. I felt as his small finger traced the small square-pattern weave of my sleeping shirt.
"Homenum Revelio!" I said, pointing my wand upwards throughout the house. Nothing happened. After that, I began to put up an intruder charm, walking around the edges of the house, muttering the words at nauseum. I had to keep the ever-growing pit in my stomach down though. I ignored Draco and Scorpius, making sure I covered the perimeter of the house up and down. My mind was spinning to the point of numbness, and I was shaking. I went to the next floor up, finding the nearest outer wall and continuing my rushed, alarmed chants. I was swiftly yanked by the shoulder from this inner world I felt myself falling into, and was faced with Draco. My breathing was ragged- I just noticed.
The lady smiled. "My sister's also a Hufflepuff. Man, I'd guess she's an even bigger fan than me. Well, anyway, here's the website." She pointed her screen at Ron, and Hermione leaned over his shoulder to read:
I served 3 bowls of soup and set 3 small empty plates on the table, before leaving the kitchen and going down the hall to my room, where Harry is.
"I never won the war, then? All of those people who died were never avenged?" I blubbered. Draco only held me tighter, rubbing soothing circles on my back.
"Don't worry. Everyone is fine, everything is okay. I'm fine, you're fine." I gave him a small kiss on the forehead before resuming my original hugging position, swaying him from side to side like I used to when he was an infant.
Scorpius turned over when he realized we were there, getting up and sprinting towards us. "Happy birthday dad!" Draco let out a soft 'oof' when Scorpius collided with him in a hug.
"Maybe back then Purebloods unfairly given the advantage, but most of it came from us working for our own power in the first place. After that, it was simply passed down, and it was up to future generations to keep up the income. Malfoy power no longer comes from our blood, mother, it's our money. And nowadays, anyone can work for that."
He then passed his thumb across my tear-stricken eyes, shushing me softly. "It's okay, I'm here. I'm not leaving." He whispered. "Talk to me. What's going on in that head of yours?" He coaxed. I felt a kiss land on my forehead. I shut my eyes tighter, shaking my head which was against his shoulder.
That was one thing, I figured: I am so horrid at masking my emotions, at blocking them away when people beckoned them forward, but I am masterful when it comes to hiding myself away all together. I hide myself, not my emotions. I leave my vulnerability and my hopelessness to myself, I don't spread the depressing mood, the anxiety, the fear, the memories, like an infectious plague that makes everyone become overly concerned with me, a disease that is clearly my own to spread, one I don't want to keep spreading, especially to Draco- probably the only person I've really opened up to since the war- no matter how many times he's insisted that it's okay, that he was there for me.
"Yes..." I felt myself begin to tremble slightly, and I suppressed it. "Scorpius, they raised me to have the same beliefs, and for a very long time I thought that Muggle-born wizards and witches were... lesser. I thought that they didn't deserve to practice magic..."
"Anytime." I replied. He shifted, turning and letting go of the hug so he could be at eye-level with me.
I peered over, curious as to why Scorpius had come into the room. He was holding a large plastic tub of applesauce and three spoons.
"Yeah. The last time I gave him applesauce he liked it, so I think he'll like it this time too." I sighed, laying down on the couch and propping my head on its arm, looking to the high ceiling.
Draco was holding my wrist gently, and my quill lay over the parchment bent and broken, a blot of ink slowly spreading throughout the sheet. My breath hitched as I stared up at him.
"I just don't understand, Draco. I mean, yes, you bullied me but I stood up to you no problem and you would back off and you- you just weren't- I- you changed... you changed you aren't the same Draco Malfoy from school. Dudley isn't even the same anymore, and I doubt he still has the same friends." I shuddered remembering Christmas. "I mean, at least he doesn't treat me like a total git every second he gets, but still."
Harry and I both looked up and out the window at Scorpius' comment, and I saw small flecks of white powder falling from the sky, onto the not-yet snow covered ground. I put my book down, getting up from the table where I had a cup of tea beside me.
I was tired. I was tired for me, and for my friend, for the weight that he had to carry every day since those letters had arrived.
"Come look! I got a dancing game, and a sports game, and a game called Mario, and a Mario racing game, and a toy truck, I also got a jigsaw puzzle, and I got this shirt that I'm wearing, and-"
Nobody tells you that magic feels cool to the touch when performed on your open skin... it was calming, and soothing. It let me descend from sobbing loud enough for the world to hear, to only crying silently, occasionally whimpering, like a wounded child. It only hurt slightly as I felt my skin pull itself together, stretching over the fresh wound, forming a bump of skin. Over my arm. Two identical scars.
We eventually stalked our way down the stairs and into the room where Hermione and Ron were waiting. Hermione, I noticed, had an increasingly flustered expression on her face. As soon as she laid eyes on us, she shoved her Muggle phone into both our faces.
I don't know when I found a blade, but I'd obviously used it and lost it all before I could realize I was bleeding the first time. So, the only choice I had really, if you think about it, was just, tear myself apart until I lost enough blood, until I knew I got what I deserved.
"I'll bet if he was awake he'd love some ice cream." I saw Harry struggle and fail to hold back a smile, he then opened his eyes.
Ron answered the door, looking disheveled and half rested, definitely mad at me for waking them in the middle of the night. I decided that having woken the king of snores was the least of my worries.
"I'm going too. I'm worried for him." Said Hermione. Her face showed one of embarrassment and shame, probably from dueling my sister.
Now even I know the answer to that question, and it isn't quite a yes. He had a panic attack the same day he was discharged, and spent the next several days sulking in his bed, not joining us for meals. But at the same time, he'd laughed with us and played with us and got to see Teddy.
"I don't know if I can go back." I whispered. The room stayed silent for what felt like 10 minutes, before I heard another sigh from Draco, who squeezed my hand tightly once more.
It was at this moment, I felt anger festering within me at her words. But there was something else in the back of my mind. She has no right to say that, but she is
We heard him scream all the way from the other cart, and that was the first genuine and hearty laugh I had in the day. It was relieving in many ways, expelling just some parts of the pressure held in my chest from the rides visuals.
After uncovering my quilt as fast as I could, I felt my stomach drop when I saw the giant stain in the bedsheets.
"Scorpius do you want me to separate your food so they don't touch?" Was she always this thoughtful? I answered for him as I helped him take a seat next to me.
I took a hesitant seat, and It's fair to say that both Dudley and Draco noticed. After we were all seated, Dudley cleared his throat.
"I'm sure she didn't mean to trigger you yesterday morning... and although things got out of hand yesterday, it is all out of concern for you... because we care so much. I..." he stopped speaking. I know Draco's right. I'm just stupidly procrastinating what I know will be another argument, as if Teddy hasn't heard enough of those at this point.
"That's a real shame, isn't it? Well, at least it's form-fitting." He tilted his head. "You could never be too safe. Lift your shirt and let me spray you-"
"I'll be right there with you," he replied. And in his eyes I could see he meant it. So, with all the strength I could muster, I straightened myself up, standing with determination. I dusted off my clothing, and went upstairs towards Scorpius' room, making sure Harry was close behind.
"It must be quite uncomfortable dancing in this small room, yeah? What do you say we move your game console to the living room," I suggested, looking over the area rug he had shoved out of the way. His eyes lit up briefly, before returning to it's neutral expression.
I slowly crouched up. I saw the quaffle, suspended in midair, with a gloved arm extended to catch it. And belonging to that arm was Bonnie's face, a little less than a metre away.
"That doesn't make it any better or worse..." I replied. "That doesn't make it any more or less likely..."
"Scor, you know that you'll always be mine, right? And that I'll always be there for you?" He nodded.
"I think maybe you." Said Draco. "I'm not entirely sure if it was the best change, but it's definitely made you stronger... also more understanding."
I took a seat next to the chair where Dada left his jacket before going off to talk with Harry some more. Rose sat next to me. I swallowed and sat as straight in my chair as I could. Rose, unlike me, was slouched over, and she had her fingers placed on the edge of the table, grabbing at the white cloth. After a moment, she fixed her hairpin, which looked like a pink flower. She was about to look up, and I quickly stared at the plates in front of me instead.
"Thank you dada-" I went back and gave him another hug, since I'm so tiny it was only up to his waist. He hugged me back with only his hands because his hands were what reached me. I felt him pat me lightly to tell me to let go.
"Oh... It's okay, Ted. It's okay, I'm here," Luca said, taken aback by the sudden rush to his side. Not long after, he put his hands on my back, and held me a bit tighter. I only increased my grip on his shirt.
I moved the pillow he had been hugging out of the way, and put his arm around me, getting comfortable. I saw hair in his face, as always, and swept it out of the way, which eventually morphed into me playing with his hair as I took in his features. He looked relaxed and happy. It made me smile slightly.
After putting away what we needed to put away, and keeping out what we were going to use to cook dinner, I swiftly made my way to Draco's room, feeling exhausted and bothered by the unleaving, ever numbing tightness of my left over anxiety. Less than 2 minutes later, he was walking into me laying face down on his bed.
The projectors shot up as the band stopped playing. The three champions proceeded into the maze, sprinting in right away. The Hogwarts champion slowed her speed down and took slow, cautious steps as she went on, while the Durmstrang champion walked forward with heavy footsteps. The Beauxbatons champion kept charging forward at top speed.
"I'm sorry about asking you those questions the other day- well... you know, the day when you... got stuck in the broom cupboard. I just... want to know what's going on. And dad is always willing to tell me anything except that. I just thought you might have answers. I didn't mean to freak you out."
My eyes opened, and I was met with rays of sun trickling through my window. I found feeling in my arms and my legs and the rest of my body as I woke up. My face, I noticed when I softly passed my hand over my eyebrows, nose, and lips, was stuck in a frown. I blinked a few times and tried to sit up in one slow movement, but I felt... a wetness in my pajama shorts.
"I wanted to make a scavenger hunt around the house. He does that for me sometimes." He said happily.
"I'm not going anywhere without Draco, and I just know Kingsley won't... what? Why are you two looking at me like that?" I fixed my position in my chair, leaning forward.
"I don't think so... She spoke about how she's missed Teddy. The last time she saw him was the just about a month after the battle..."
"What was that dada?" Asked Scorpius. Draco responded with "did you hear anything?" Scorpius shook his head.
"Hm? Yeah." A great sigh escaped me. "I just had a fit is all." As I said that, the feeling of brittle and borderline cracked lips, as well as a raspy throat, was brought to the forefront of my attention. I need water.
"Show me yours if I show you mine?" I swallowed, trying and failing to avoid seeing the lines neatly drawn onto his wrist. I glanced up at him, before looking back down at his arm. Snapping out of my daze, I pulled up my own sleeve, feeling my heart skip a beat.
I blinked twice as the sunlight cascaded into the room, flooding the old wallpaper of Grimmauld Place. Looking to my side where a weight once sank the bed. I smoothed the sheets over with an extended hand, and glanced around the room from my position, then finally sat up and rubbed my eyes.
I shook my head at the thought, focusing on the conversation. It was now that I'd noticed that Dudley lost a lot of weight. He looked quite fit for his age, actually. His figure reminded me a bit of a blond version of Neville. When I realized a response was probably expected, I opened my mouth to do so, but was interrupted by a feminine voice coming from the stairs.
Hi Scorpius!" He said, I saw streaks of his hair involuntarily turn from sandy blond, to turquoise. And while I was glad it meant he was happy, It worried me slightly. As long as he isn't changing anything too dramatically, hopefully, Maria won't notice.
"I remember this spot..." Harry walked forward, towards the outer rim of the clearing. "It's as quiet as it was last time."
"Because of what happened with the Boggart... we have something called shock spells. You get them once a week until you're better-" My eyes widened and I let go of the hug.
Harry was nervous, as expected, and I was too. It was a major risk, going to a Muggle hospital. But, we have magic at our disposal, and Harry's health is more important than anything else right now, in my opinion. Dr. Gilroy had given me the idea of using an alias, saying that it was perfectly legal, and that the option was put in place to protect patients identities.
Ron scoffed. "Of course you would say that about your son. The Apple doesn't fall far from the tree. Well, I reckon Rose is going to be a Gryffindor, like me and Hermione." Ron said with a proud and smug smile.
"There's nothing bad about this... he just wants you to come over on Christmas Day." he said, looking up from the letter with a soft confusion on his face.
"Hi Scorpius! How is everything?" I said, kneeling to his height. He turned to me. His face was red and his hair was messily pulled back by dry sweat. He looked like he'd just finished a summer quidditch match.
"Are you suggesting that we shouldn't have told Kingsley it wasn't bad? I would assume the fact that they don't think we're real is a good thing," commented Draco.
"You're alright, Harry. It's all going to turn out alright, you just need to stay strong, Harry. Stay strong-" his voice broke, and I felt his chest convulse as his own breathing hitched. He took a deep breath, his voice wavering.
She leaned back, looking defeated, before standing up with determination. "Don't worry. We'll figure it out... I'll do more research. Now that you're telling me Voldemort was the reason behind these books, I can try to find some more things. We know he can't have written them though, because-"
had thrown that remark at me, Luca grabbed my right shoulder, almost harshly, and hissed through a barely opened mouth.
I closed my eyes and focused on my barely existent breathing. I squeezed Draco's hand tightly, trying to stop my shaking.
"It's called a piercing, Lupin." He scoffed, dismissing me with his hand. I clicked my tongue, looking back towards the greenhouse.
When I moved to get up, Teddy hugged me tighter, signaling he doesn't want to let go. I took him in my arms and carried him. He was heavy, but I didn't let my struggle to hold him show.
"Yes. It's quite remarkable, actually. I still don't get it." Said Harry with a slight smile. He seemed better today. I still observed him closely.
"You know your mother and I named you after that constellation on purpose. Almost everyone in our family is named after a constellation, Scorpius."
"The pressure shouldn't hurt you, but can help relieve the feeling, sometimes. Also, the feeling of my calm breathing can help relax you if you feel feverish."
His breathing was ragged, and he kept shutting his eyes with every new bit of pain that would shoot through him. I didn't stop the cooling charms, paying extra mind to the section that was the source of the pain, where that giant scar was.
"Scorpius Malfoy." I introduced with my chin up and my chest out, trying to show as much confidence as possible. She giggled.
I stood there speechless. I didn't know what exactly to say, and I felt like saying anything would be inappropriate, so instead, I sat back down at my desk, and with shaking hands, I wrote.
"It's alright." I said, pausing. Scorpius and I have never really had a meaningful conversation before. And I don't quite know how to handle this. He slowly emerged from his spot.
I pulled out my wand letting out a small chuckle as I recalled how dramatic my son is being. I used to be the same.
As we got closer to mock-Hogsmeade, I found myself ever-so slightly drifting closer to Draco. Slowly, my strides became smaller, and I became skittish: scratching the back of my head, looking around, nearly bumping into people.
"Is that a yes?" I heard a sort of entertained tone to his voice, and I didn't need to open my eyes to know he was smirking, and most definitely up to something.
Finally!! Draco is starting to realize that he can't wait any longer to come clean to Scorpius about his past!!!
"Oye! Abre la puerta coño!" [Hey! Open the damn door!] I recognized Maria's voice being muffled by the door. Harry looked towards me.
We didn't speak for a few more moments again, the silence between us lasting a bit longer than last time.
"Mate, today, I was supposed to help George do inventory at the shop- he was going to keep it closed so we could do that... He said to be there at noon, I guess he got there a lot earlier.
"Luca, come on, let's get ready for dinner." Luca startled me from behind, taking me from Aminata and guiding me out of the classroom. It was only now, while looking around, that I'd realized the majority of students had already left, including Professor Belmonte. On our way to the restroom, we were walking the halls alone.
My breath hitched, and Luca spoke. "That must not be an ordinary mirror... what did you see?" I hesitantly let go, blinking and sniffling, wiping my eyes.
Letting him run off to his father, Teddy stepped up bashfully. He had been patiently waiting to say hello, and I was slightly surprised to know he'd been let out of school. Seeing as Ron probably wouldn't be able to say hello until we sat down for the lunch he was getting ready to serve, Teddy took his opportunity.
"Wait, before you knock on the door." I heard Draco say before I was met with a kiss. I closed my eyes, returning it.
"I know but I just... I was looking for a sign that Sirius might have forgiven me or that it was okay and the silence it just... and then the nurse closed the curtains to the window and-" He stopped talking, just squeezing me tighter, wanting to be closer.
It was with a slight shock that I found myself sitting at the Three broomsticks, and sitting at the table beside those teenagers from earlier. I shrugged my shoulders, playing with my sleeves and leaning away.
"You delivered a child, then named him after your father... he's not even your child." He said, finally looking into my eyes, which held a glint of upset confusion in them. I gave him a blunt face, unsure of what exactly he was trying to say. He took a large breath.
Just then, it clicked. It suddenly all made sense. I could do this. I can stop causing them pain and problems... I just need to work up the courage to do this. I let a single tear slip. I just need to find out how, and when, and what to do before then. that's all I need to do.
"So all of your friends love coming without invitation, don't they." I turned to Draco, standing with a kitchen towel draped over his shoulder.
While walking over to George, I slipped my hand in with Draco's, squeezing slightly. He returned the gesture, confident and relaxed. Before I could plan how on earth to start a conversation with him, we were right by the couch he sat on.
"Alright." I turned to leave before remembering the razor blade. I turned back around and bent over to pick it up. He eyed me carefully and I could tell the blade was causing tension. As I almost stepped out, he spoke, stopping me.
Scorpius was already sitting down at the blanket when we made it out. I squeezed Draco's hand three times softly, leaning into him slightly.
"They treated me like any other family member... we talked, caught up... it was surprisingly normal."
"I think yesterday is the latest he's ever gone to sleep. And I could tell he was fighting it too." He let a laugh escape "I am never carrying him again. If his mother could see him now..." he said, his voice trailing.
I looked at my watch. It's not even 11:00AM. I swiftly made my way to the bathroom, hoping he might be there.
"Never assume," I whispered back. "There were never any bodies. It was obvious they must've all gone into hiding."
"Well, with the trauma that was caused by...the war," Hermione began. "It's not entirely unreasonable that they're scared. What's odd is why they'd think it was you of all people. 'The savior gone bad,'"She said with air quotes.
I sighed, turning myself back to where he had sat, where his unfinished dinner now was. Then, I turned next to me, observing Harry's vacant seat, and his unfinished dinner. It made my stomach knot, and it was with a dull sting I realized none of us would be finishing our dinner tonight.
My blood boiled. How could these people, who don't even know him, be saying these things, these lies, about Scorpius? He's the sweetest kid I know. He's my best mate... and he is only 9 years old! These people... they're all grown-ups! What gives them the right to be doing this!?
I squinted at him. He seems to have said that offhandedly, but he was looking at me as angry as he could possibly look, puffed cheeks and all. Gabriel clicked his tongue and hung his head to the floor before looking up at me again, this time with intensity in his eyes.
I watched as the two shared their moment, and I could practically feel Harry's mind brewing with those thoughts that he always gets. I swallowed slightly. An after-breakfast snack may have been accomplished, but it's going to take a lot more work to get him up to full meals, and getting him to eat again later today will already prove itself a challenge. I just feel it.
"Thank you, Happy Christmas, Dr. Gilroy," I said, shaking her hand, and then allowing Draco to do the same.
"Every day since it happened I- I think 'what if Malfoy never showed up?' Would I have come home to see his body instead of-" she began to sob, and so did I.
I laid awake wrapped in my woolen bed sheets, arms and legs spread out beneath them. Time was moving as slow as it ever could have as Aminata's words swam through my head and projected themselves everywhere; in the ceiling, on the wall, etched on the bedpost. I felt like I could not carry my own weight, even while laying on my back, and sank deeper and deeper into the bed. Despite Luca's best efforts to cheer me up after that encounter with Aminata, I still remember it well. As if I wasn't reminded of that every day. But somehow, I found the strength to support myself and sit up, where I was greeted by a familiar face, who had just opened the door, though I barely heard the sound it made.
I fluttered my eyes, trying to blink away any sleep I might've had left in me, sitting up. My hand dragged itself up and down the sheets as I stared at it. The empty spot where he should be sleeping.
"Does that mean I can show her the bedtime stories you used to read to me about dragons and unicorns?" I shook my head, taking a deep breath.
"Relax, Merlin... I didn't know that." I calmed down a bit, seeing Draco deep in thought. "What do I do then? What happened... it-"
"Mrs. Granger, Reporter M. Dews, Wizarding World News, UK Division. Is there any information you can provide regarding speculation that Scorpius is not Draco Malfoy's biological son, but rather that of the late Tom Riddle?"
"You're just saying that. What's wrong?" Said Luna, taking a seat beside Neville, in front of me. I sighed.
"Because," he said. "Anyway, let's go to my room, I have a game I've been waiting to play with you." Scorpius promptly turned around and went upstairs. I turned to Uncle Harry and Draco, with a face asking
"...You know how to play it too?" He asked, though I knew he was confused by my lack of a timely response.
"It will... you'll see; people will forget after a while, or they'll see Skeeter and her papers for the rubbish they are." I reasoned.
"I heard what you told Teddy... About- about your PTSD, and depression... does it really affect you that harshly?" I swallowed, and received a nudge in the side from Draco. I only stood there, nearly gaping.
"We have word of two suspicious individuals said to be harassing a woman over by Knockturn alley. People say they were the Rowles. Keep this quiet, and go figure it out. Auror Williamson is waiting at the apparation point."
"Yeah," replied the fake Ravenclaw. "But you should read the books first, they're better than the movies. More detailed. And the movies cut out so many characters,"
"I considered pushing Rose back a year, but the truth is, I don't think they're targeting her kind. She's a half blood, much like Teddy. I really think he will be alright too. And Scorpius? Oh, pure blooded, he shouldn't have to worry at all. Not a single Half or Pure blood have been taken. Not one, Harry. Besides... it might be better if Rose stays away from me, and stays safe at school."
"Thanks..." I looked down in deep thought. At least I know that our relationship is less of a problem than I thought.
"Harry, it's me. Good morning." What startled me was that instead of uncovering himself slowly, he basically jumped, bolting upright and staring at me wide-eyed. I stepped backwards, slightly startled by his outburst.
Gabriel sniffed, turning his head towards me. He placed his hand behind his head. "Look, I... It's fine, y'know?" He gave a half-smile. Cheers were beginning to grow once again.
"Alright, I am out of the shower and we need to debrief Kingsley." Hermione opened the door, looking clean as ever, shaking through her curly hair with a towel.
There was a drawer taken out of its place in the dresser, settled on the floor, and half empty. Many shirts and even one or two shorts were scattered across the ground and surrounding Draco, hunched over, eyes drooping and head bobbing as he sat with a shirt half folded in his lap, fatigued enough to have stopped folding, and fatigued enough to have not noticed I even walked in.
"Miss Fernsby, Miss Loughty, Mister Olivemore, you will be the other three captains." I tensed slightly as Aminata stood next to me, leaning over and whispering.
"Hey, Teddy! We're over here!" I lifted my head up to see Victorie and her friends sitting down on a corner in the hallway. I held my breath and started to walk over.
"You won't be alone," I reasoned, soothing him as best I could, hugging him and letting him hug me. "You have Teddy, and Rose. Those are your friends. And you'll have all of those Weasley kids you met a few Christmases ago... that's a lot of Weasleys. You absolutely will not be alone."
"Then I'll take the owl to Hogwarts, and the cat can stay at home!" He smiled proudly. I smacked my own forehead.
"Yeah, dude, we're cool," I said, puckering my lips and scrunching my eyebrows, making both me and Gabriel laugh.
"To the right of here Quick Service Hog's Head, we also have the Dragon challenge rollercoaster, and the Hogwarts express."
"Well, I've heard that herbologists are working to find a plant that will cure hangovers. But until then, I reckon she'll do fine with some rest and water, eh?"
I woke up soon and realized I was lying down on the bed with Draco sitting beside me. There was no pillow under my head, but there was one under my feet. I looked around the room, noticing nothing odd, then turned to meet Draco's sympathetic gaze. The first thing I noticed about myself was my lack of glasses and the thumping pain on the back of my head, and on my bum.
"Well, he's exceptionally famous. Everyone in the Muggle World knows who he is... well, most of them, at least. Those who listen to music, especially around our parent's age. That's when he became popular- the seventies."
As soon as we pulled into the driveway I got out of the car headed to the trunk to start unloading the groceries, my chest still tight from previously. Draco went to open the car's back door for his son, and then opened the house door before joining me in grabbing grocery bags. Thankfully, there weren't too many.
"Aurors Berrycloth, Weasley, and Williamson have full permission by the Ministry of Magic, and the Magical Congress of the United States, on behalf of Minister Kingsley Shaklebolt, and President Samuel Quahog, to place Mister Draco Lucius Malfoy under arrest- for endangerment of the Statue of Secrecy, and suspicion of irresponsible use of the Obliviate charm on a Muggle."
Slowly, Harry lifted himself up, slowly rotating on his heel. Ron, Hermione, and I didn't dare utter a word. Kingsley, though?
under the table. Draco and Millicent were staring each other down fiercely. Then, while keeping a challenging eye on Draco, she spoke.
He grabbed the spoon with his shaky hands, getting a bit of the applesauce on it, and brought it to his mouth. He let it linger for a second, taking in the flavor, before swallowing. He took a breath, setting it down on his lap.
Luca hummed, then went below me, though I didn't look down. I couldn't. I gulped and winced, and I flew even higher to Victorie, clutching my broom as hard as possible.
Slowly, I made my way over to his corner, stopping at the sound of my door opening. I jumped, looking over to find Scorpius, who, with one look, understood that I cannot speak, and need a moment with Harry. He closed the door again, as softly as he could. I lowered myself onto the floor, beside Harry.
much worse... because, it hurts the people you love more. It makes the happy times become remembered as nothing but a helpless façade. Suddenly, everyone starts to believe there really was no hope. And the person that's gone leaves a gaping hole that not only could never be filled, but starts to feel like it was there all along. It makes hope feel like it never existed."
It's also been somewhat like this for the past months with Victorie and Luca. Not exactly going for each other's throats, but going at each other nonetheless.
He gave me another, and it sent me into bliss as we moved together, I almost didn't care what it meant as we let us, and only us, exist in that moment. Except... I do care, and it's been gnawing at my conscience all day. I hesitantly pulled away.
"Oh um, Ron, Ginny should be home soon. She doesn't know you're here. Thought it'd be a right pleasant surprise."
"How long will it take to bring them together? Is it... do we need to band them together immediately?"
I squeezed my eyes tight as tears sprang forward once again. My face twisted in pain and frustration.
"Yeah..." He looked into the distance, before turning back to us. "So, you and Malfoy. How's that?" Then, he leaned in toward me, putting his hand up to the side of his mouth. "Is he a good shag-"
The first Chapter to the sequel has been published as a work within this series! Go check it out! The title is Returned
"He's been weird like that since yesterday... more than usual." Said Ginny with a sigh. I don't know why. He won't tell me what happened. She glanced past the indoors to make sure Harry wasn't there listening.
I pushed the thought from my mind. and turned my head towards Professor Slughorn. He was strolling around the room, holding his wand behind his back. He reminded me terribly of a Muggle soldier, the ones you'd see in their history books. Professor Slughorn's staunch posture and mean demeanor softened for just a moment. I followed his falling gaze, and I found that they landed on Aminata. I looked away as quick as the Professor's lips straightened and their brows furrowed again.
I ended up seeing all of the Weasley's at her birthday. It was awkward, and finding conversation was difficult, especially with Ginny, who is now visibly pregnant. She doesn't like to talk about it, and she still doesn't know if she wants a baby shower. Everyone got excited when the baby kicked, but it was a timid sort of excitement. They were all happy about the immediate situation, yet the way it all happened still sat with everyone like a pool of unmoving tar at our feet. Nobody mentioned it at all.
As masses of students were walking through the main hallways and pouring from staircases, I took a glance at the Great Hall. Instead of the usual scene for dinner, it was lit more than usual, the candles dancing with more vigor and shine, and massive banners representing all the houses hung proud from the ceiling. All the Heads of House, including McGonagall, were lined up at the front of the Great Hall, like they had been when the semester had started. There was also a very tall lady who rivaled Hagrid's height, and a scruffy-looking muscular man who looked like he came straight from two millennia ago. Hagrid, instead of his usual wide, welcoming grin, had a small smile, and had his eyes set on the giant lady next to him.
"... people. He- he always tells me that being mean to people for no reason is wrong and he did it anyway," Scorpius explained, keeping his head down.
"They cared about me, and they told me I could reach the stars if I tried hard enough, and they took care of me when I was sick and they made me feel happy and welcome... why would I have let them die, when I know that they would have made the move to save me, just as I did for them? I tried so hard to keep us together and fucking Voldemort ensured we would never really be a family ever again, no matter how hard I tried, to be the perfect son, to obey, to stick by mother and father's side...
This yanked me out of my fatigue. I immediately removed myself from Harry's arms and sat up looking at Scorpius, worried that something may have gone wrong.
"I... don't want to move.... too much... energy." Suddenly I noticed just how done with everything he looked.
He's also been more worried about Ginny, who keeps insisting that she doesn't need help with the baby. She'd been really quite polite about it too, until one day she'd just had it, and she yelled at him, telling him she can't breathe when he's around her, and that she doesn't want to look at him, because "some unreasonable part of my brain keeps telling me that George got the idea from you."
"No. But," I thought for a second. "I believe she can hear us... Do you maybe want to go do that?" He hesitated for a second, looking at me, unsure. Then, he nodded.
"You do realize that you've never had a panic attack quite like yesterday night. At least not one that I've ever seen. So imagine my surprise when I'm chasing you halfway out of the house at one in the morning, in freezing weather wearing nothing but pajamas." I explained with a huff, before continuing.
"I tried," I panted. I looked to my right and saw that there were people giggling and looking from the door. I tried to raise my hand in a very weak wave.
"Hey, thanks for tonight. I don't think I've been able to spend that long outside of the house without getting an anxiety attack in at least a decade." I said, letting out a small chuckle. "Thank you for doing that." I saw him put his book down, putting his bookmark on the page where he'd left off.
With Teddy's help, I introduced myself to everybody in the room, most of them older than me. I'm used to being around Dada and Harry, so that didn't bother me much. But I had only seen kids younger than me one time before this Christmas. A few minutes passed, and Molly
"Not to be blunt Draco, but he has no mother. And he lost her so young that she couldn't have had such an impact on him... I mean, he'll always be able to
Arriving at Ron and Hermione's house, I was met with Rose, who was being kept from her parents by Luna, who was holding a crying brunet baby- James- and kept saying.
"Are you going to say anything? Agree? Disagree?" I didn't give any indication of an answer. "Can I ask you something?" He asked. I nodded.
"T-take then both. To your house. Don't let them know anything is happening." I felt a shiver go down my spine. I already know this isn't going to be much of a better day than yesterday. And it's my fault.
"It sounds to me like you've been listening to a lot of adult conversations." I said, trying to discreetly change the subject. He pulled away from our hug, and I saw a few streaks of grey in his hair, as well as his face growing longer. for a second, he reminded me of Moony.
"I... physically? Yes..." I huffed a breath, before walking in, being thrown into a hug around the waist by Scorpius, who then proceeded to climb me as though he were a five year old again. I reached down and picked him up with a groan. "Hello, Scor. Did you enjoy your day?"
My face became still and expressionless. My eyes flickered from the Poster on Hermione's phone, to Harry, Hermione, and Ron. I was too slow in getting the phone out of Harry's reach, because the next thing I knew, Harry was taking it from my hand. I stared at him.
"You too. I'm Maria, Draco's neighbor, I watch Scorpius from time to time. She said, letting them into the house.
"It's okay. It's a relief, I haven't really thought about the answer yet..." I replied, finally turning around, instinctually placing my hand on my neck. I looked at her.
"Let's go explore the hotel; does that sound nice?" Draco's offer was delivered with a smooth, sweet tone. I wanted to melt into it, letting him captivate me and never let go.
"Harry, take a breath, please lower your voice just a tad, you're getting worked up." I said gently, going towards him and taking his hands, which were trembling.
I stopped, knowing he was right. He was truly stuck in the middle- part of a generation of kids he can't spend so much time with.
"...America... stop... talking... please." My eyes widened slightly in realization. He's crashing because he hasn't taken his medicine in days.
Apparently my sour face was visible as I thought of it all, because when Ron opened the door, his face dropped, then furrowed.
"Petrificus Totalus." In an instant, Maria fell to the floor with a thud, stiff as a board. I turned around to see Harry a small distance away from me, with his wand out at Maria, looking absolutely panicked.
"He has averse side affects to them." I can't breathe, I'm drowning, needles pricking at my skin- Fuck,
In all the 31 years of my life, it shocks me that I never gazed upon the skyline of a busy city at night. Everything glows and it's all right next to everything else, looking across it's busy streets, and it's almost comforting in all of it's hazy, bright, colorful, cramped glory. It makes you believe that anything is possible.
It's currently midnight and I'm sat at a square table with Harry to my left, Maria in front of me, and another woman to my right. Scorpius is sitting on my lap, and we are all halfway through a game called dominos.
"That's a cool name." Dudley said, eyeing me with a small smile. I'll admit it was slightly unnerving- watching him smile without any malice behind it. After a while, I spoke, feeling it necessary to do so.
"Cedric was a Hufflepuff. He was killed at the end of the last task of the tournament. Harry Potter spent the next year trying to convince people it was Voldemort who did it." My face paled at Wendy's brief explanation as I connected the dots, and I wondered faintly if this was one of the things that bothers Uncle Harry so much. McGonagall continued to speak again, snapping me out of my thoughts.
"Young man I might as well be the best dancer my age. People stepped aside for me. I just don't dance contemporarily. Waltzing is my forte. Not..." I waved my arms passively at the paused screen.
"Everybody is alright? Nobody got hurt?" I said, looking around, Scorpius and Harry shook their heads. "Good. Good." I said, In a slight daze.
"Draco recommended it to me an eternity ago. I've slowly been working my way through it." He answered simply. I closed the door behind me, sitting down on the edge of the bed.
"And what about Teddy? You told me not to worry about him but it's really quite difficult to do so. He hasn't learned to control his metamorphagus abilities." I asked him, growing a frustrated sort of anxious. How had I not thought about this? Why was I so blind to trust Harry without asking?
Wendy rolled his eyes and supported his head's weight on his hand. "Well, reading certainly helps, but you won't make the team just by reading." He smugly looked at his nails. Bonnie puffed her cheeks.
We are together in peace, discussing little things. At the end of breakfast, Draco took Scorpius upstairs to do his hair.
"Hello Hermione, Neville, Ron, Ginny. Oh. It seems Draco Malfoy's gone away." She said, scanning the room.
"Well you seem like a smart little fellow, who're you?" Draco nearly glared at Dudley, but I stopped him by placing my hand over his underneath the table.
I put myself in the nearest bedroom. Everything is swaying, my clothes are itchy, everything is itchy. My nausea had risen from my stomach to my chest, keeping me with an overwhelming lack of oxygen, or so I felt. My thighs began to ache. I brought myself to the floor. My vision was now spotty, all I could hear was static, and the nausea was not leaving me. I forced an enormous breath into myself. It helped, but not enough. I felt faint. I'm struggling to keep myself conscious. I heard a thump, followed by an acute rush of air, and something on my arms, something warm, but I couldn't tell what it was.
Next, 'Makara, Luca' was sorted into Slytherin, 'Meuric, Jill'- another friend of Aminata's- was sorted into Ravenclaw. I noticed that she avoided looking at the Hufflepuff table entirely. She avoided looking at me. I wasn't sure whether to be grateful, or confused.  The last name that was called was 'Olivemore, Gabriel.'- who was sorted into Hufflepuff, like me.
"You'll see them all the time still. And I'm absolutely sure you'll find good people at school. Also, if the bullying gets too bad you can always go to your Headmaster." I told him. He just hugged me tightly.
"So, it's natural for children to want to know more about what's going on in the world. Let's begin with why you think it's not your place to tell him."
"Take this." He said, though it came through as a kind of mumble to me. My medicine was now sitting in the palm of my hand, and I missed the feeling of having Draco's hand in mine, even if it was just to hand me my medicine.
"Call her for me." I mumbled. "Tell her it's urgent." I tried to ignore my oncoming nausea, going to Scorpius's room. I knocked, proceeding to open the door.
"Look, everyone! Look! Harry Potter! He hasn't been seen since his marriage!" Swarms of people came towards us.
"Welcome." I said as I looked up towards him. We lingered for a bit before I pulled myself back into reality. And let go of his hand.
"I've already told you he has his own things to deal with." I said shortly, remembering the reason he wasn't taking care of me anymore. I could see in his expression that he wanted to say something more, but thankfully, he decided against it. His hair went back to its normal short, curly brown.
"He's been in the spare room an awful lot, but the times we've seen him he told us he was alright." Said Ron.
I'm not lying when I say I didn't know what to tell him. All I know is that I can't let it get as bad as it was last time. I held him closely.
"Do I want to know how you got hold of a blade when I strictly remember getting rid of them all a long time ago?"
Once I put my broom back and got my things, I immediately started walking back towards the nearest indoor hallway without waiting for Luca or Victorie. My breaths were quick and shallow as I walked, my steps becoming heavier and heavier asI stomped away without looking up.
My heart rate quickened again, pulsing through my body, pounding relentlessly at my skull. I trembled.
"I don't know... But look, Victorie's over there, and she's flying way higher than you. Might want to catch up," he said with a smirk, but I can see a slight bit of hesitance in his eyes.
"Oh now don't start with that, it's the third time in the last two days that you've said that," he replied. I rolled my eyes.
"Um, yeah! Sorry. Yes. I would, in fact, like to go with you to the Yule Ball, Vic," I said, rubbing the spot on which I hit myself, looking onto the floor.
"Does it have anything to do with why you won't let go of the cloak?" Draco asked. Luca's expression faltered briefly.
"Harry... Hermione says that we have to go... being here puts the reality of the Wizarding World at risk..."
"Who did that to us?" He said, looking upset. I sighed. "I don't know. Somebody. She knew a lot of things, this person." I wasn't going to indulge in the mystery of Joanne Rowling- according to Hermione, that's her name. I don't know if she's a witch, or if she's a Muggle with way too much information and a tendency to tell everyone in the worst way possible. Having published nine books about the Wizarding World, 3 of which were just Muggle versions of Wizarding books. A Muggle copy of
"You told me... You told me I could make something amazing. That I'd be great at school. Is- Is this why?"
"I'm fine," I assured, forcing my voice to stay as calm as possible. "You can visit right now, so you know never to come here in the future, son. This is where bad people lurk. People who will hurt you. Do you understand?"
Silence draped over the room until all that could be heard was each other's heartbeats and gentle breaths. The circular motions of Harry's hand were slowly but surely lulling me into a sleep, and I was slightly disgruntled by how comfortable I felt.
"Let's go. The longer we sit around twiddling our thumbs the worse he could be." Said Malfoy while going away with the two.
"I've been reading up on it," she started looking around to make sure others weren't listening. I wouldn't be lying when I say I felt slightly scared. "Here's the book. You'll find the information on him on page 437. Look, I know you're friends, but I just can't help but think that come next month you'll land yourself in the hospital wing because of him." I shivered.
Gabriel smiled, but he kept his eyes trained on me. Maybe he was also trying to see if he had seen me before.
We stayed that way for a very long time- our hold never faltered, never got loose. We never became uncomfortable, we just, stayed. I wouldn't be surprised if we got so lost in each other's hold that we dozed off once or twice. The silence and his warmth were comforting. I felt secure, safe.
When he was given the gown he had asked if there were long sleeves available, to which the kind nurse shook his head sympathetically. "You may keep your underwear on," he'd said, "but nothing else. It'll go into this plastic bag, along with any personals: phone, watch, jewelry..."
I felt Draco move slightly and he held my arms still, and soon his breath was tickling the skin behind my ears.
"Good morning..." He didn't move, but his eyes- his expression- showed that he was listening. "Talk to me." Getting straight to the point wasn't going to hurt today, it seemed, so that was what I did, sliding in next to him, waiting patiently for a response.
"Harry, it's me, Draco." My muscles flexed and I squeezed myself tighter. "Harry, the door is open. You can come out now."
"Yeah, like the fact that he assumes the books are one-hundred percent fact, and can't keep his head out of his arse long enough to realize I'm uncomfortable." The couch dipped as Draco took a seat next to me.
"Go on, if you won't speak to me you need to speak with someone. And if that someone is your godfather, then so be it." I stood timidly, taking the bowl from her hands, which retreated to cross her chest and stay there.
"We're going to make sure it's amazing." Draco moved to bring me into a hug. I put my mug down beside me, wrapping my arms around his waist. He did the same, bringing me into a kiss that I gladly accepted, before pulling away, to speak to him.
I thought stubbornly and incorrectly. "Yesterday he relapsed, if you will. It was his first time doing that since the beginning of this year." Draco explained. My jaw tensed.
"I-I don't know... there's no other explanation for what I heard, they were asking about each other's houses, and-" I stopped to catch my breath. "Things were, weird. They had American accents and any wizard with half a brain wouldn't mention something like that in public in the Muggle world... but what else could it be?" I asked, breathless from my rambling.
"Cool." Me and Gabriel responded together. As the bell rang and cheers erupted, three figures dived from the platforms above into the water. The projectors above depicted what went on when they went into the water, but the cheers died down some, as the three were just trying to get to the bottom at the moment.
Scorpius slowed slightly, thinking. "I guess you're right. And I would prefer to not have to use some other owl that isn't mine and might not be as smart or might not like me... what if we get one of both?"
Scorpius found and pointed to the spill shyly, and the two of them got to work, wiping up the orange juice.
"What was Teddy's Owl about?" He asked after a few moments of comfortable silence, reminding me of the letter I previously chucked to the side, that I had nearly entirely forgotten about.
"And the twins was on your own accord too?" I asked, knowing the answer was no. Harry didn't answer though. He just cried harder.
"It's... almost impossible... to think that my attempt at making things better for everyone just started this, enormous disaster, affecting every corner of all of the people I care about..." I swallowed, thinking about Teddy, Ginny, Hermione, Ron, Draco, and even Scorpius. The fact that it
!" And, in an instant, the stains were gone. I looked at Harry one more time after going out of my room. I thought of him as a stranger before, but now... he doesn't feel so strange. Well, he is strange, but not as much as he used to be. He was waiting for me to go out. "Let's go get some water."
Gabriel didn't move from his position. I looked away, pursing my lips, not really knowing what to do or say. I didn't hear anything from Wendy or John either.
"I didn't mean to snap." I mumbled, fiddling with my sleeves. A strand of sandy blond hair fell in front of my face as I bowed my head down in shame. "Sorry..." I heard her huff before the receding click of her thick heels engulfed the echoing tiles of the house. After a few moments I heard her clear her throat and I looked up at her. She was holding a long expression with stubbornly unshed tears and a bowl of floo powder.
"Yes?" He said while filling out a parchment, nor looking up. I stayed silent. "Yes?" He looked up then back at his parchment, before doing a double take. "Harry, Mister Malfoy. What seems to-"
I sent Scorpius to go play after our breakfast. This morning felt quite calm, like any other Saturday. I Decided to go to my room and read a novel I had there. About one chapter later however I was startled by the popping sound of appiration. Harry stood in my room in extreme distress with his eyes screwed shut in pain. He took out his wand and shouted a silencing spell on the room before allowing it to fall and he lowered himself into a ball while letting out a heartbreaking scream of pure pain. My initial confusion was replaced with overwhelming concern as I got up and went to him.
I was brought out of my hazy view of the night sky from the window at the feeling of two arms tenderly wrapping themselves around my waist, and Harry's chin resting itself on my shoulder. I leaned into him.
"Do you want another piece of evidence? My mark. It can't exist without him; that's why it's only a jumble of scars now," I explained softly.
"Yes, I know how to read." He grumbled, scanning over the written words several times with scrutiny. "He sent you an Owl, not muggle mail..."
"Who says she can't?! I raised Scorpius in Muggle America, for Christ's sake! I didn't know anything about the Muggle World, about America, and I managed for seven years alone!"
"Oh, I-I'm alright, really," I stuttered, grabbing the ends of my scarf roughly, nearly yanking on them, which made me pull my chin back in surprise, "I heard she's great at making sweaters, though." It took a second before I saw Victorie make an 'O' shape with her mouth and giggle, bending down slightly.
"I'm fine," he replied a little too quickly. "Just- I'm fine. Only a little bit stressed." He took another breath, his hands kneading at his pant legs.
"I'm siding with Scorpius on this one." I claimed, pointing at him with the same hand that held my momentarily forgotten letter.
"You don't have to be sorry about that either. I'm here by choice, and I was there by choice. I want to help you and I'm willing to deal with things." He said.
"Aw, I should've done that! I could have gotten Hagrid as my professor!" I fell backwards into my seat, now bummed out. "Tell him I say hi?"
"It worked? Yeah? I'll show you..." He grumbled fumbling to reach for a pillow from beside us, with which he proceeded to hit me over the head. I quickly moved the pillow away, revealing Draco, silently laughing so hard that he went red. I reached up and gave him a kiss, which, after calming down enough, he brought his hand to the side of my face and returned it.
"I know." He said. I sighed. This isn't going to go anywhere when I don't know what to say about it.
"Just... Be there, I guess. I'll be with some people, and I hear the guest band is especially brilliant this year. Supposedly they came over from America, I'd say that's reason enough to listen to them,"
My heart was in my throat and the pulsations could be felt from my neck, to my chest, to my fingertips. I had been nervous before to see Dudley, but now, I am utterly shocked at what's stood before me.
"Even if it wasn't so deep, Draco, he could have hit what are called the basilic and cephalic veins. All you need to do is open one of those veins. Depth and force are not what made this a deadly encounter. Harry, you are incredibly lucky." Harry remained silent, looking back down. I frowned.
"Oh, totally. I read the books when I was in middle and high school, and even saw Deathly Hallows part 2 the day it came out. I'm a Ravenclaw, by the way. Go house pride!"
"He's not back. The Rowles said so. Whatever they have planned, it's without him," I confessed, closing my eyes, the stress rolling through me in waves, making my head pound.
"Are you ok?" I asked. He only squeezed tighter, I took it as him saying he doesn't want to talk at the second. I closed my eyes and leaned into him.
"So... Are you breaking up with her?" He continued. I felt an impact on my chest, unsure of how to respond.
I gave a shrug, continuing to walk beside him. "I don't know. Maybe not today." I told him, keeping my head down.
It was around 11:30 at night, and Harry and I were sitting on the bed, my back was against the headboard, and Harry was leaning into me. The only sounds were that of crickets merrily chirping outside, and I was gently holding Harry's arm, which was resting on my lap. My eyes were fixed on his numerous scars.
"Yes! Have you not been reading?" Draco's jaw clenched and He gripped Scorpius's upper arm, holding him closely.
"I never lost Ron's family, and we became like a real family, even when everything was crazy and people were dying everywhere and Ron and I would listen to the news to make sure the Weasley's wouldn't be one of them- I'm rambling. The point is, Your dad," I took a breath. "He's made it through a lot, and I don't think he's going any time soon. He's too strong for that. Also, I get it, you're scared he's going to... die... and, I went through something similar, but I turned out alright." I said, offering a meek smile. "And, I didn't lose everyone, and neither will you." I finally finished, unable to even remember half of the words that spilled out of my mouth just seconds before.
"Okay, that's a lot, mate. Let's start with Malfoy's arm, it's been happening again?" Asked Ron calmly.
"Yeah. Yeah... Sorry." I said, moving out of the way. He closed the door behind me and I went back to the room, laying down in my original spot. After around 3 minutes, Draco came back. I turned onto my side, facing away from him.
"Now, Scorpius, it is very important for you to understand that you cannot tell people like Maria about this. You keep this between wizards and witches. Yes?" I said, clarifying once again the importance of keeping this secret.
Delphi? As in... Voldemort's daughter? (I do not like the Cursed Child, guys, but I have entirely separate plans with her, I promise.)
John and I were overlooking the greenhouse used in Herbology. Nothing much was going on there, except a Mandrake being pulled and several kids jumping back. We covered our ears for safe measure, even though we were at a considerable distance. Once we lowered our hands, John huffed out of his nose. Eventually, we heard glass shattering in the distance.
"And they understand. And they aren't mad at you. They want you to just be okay. We all do." I said, looking at him tenderly.
"Here, I had some stored. It should help the headache." I blinked up at Draco, eying the small vial in his hand, the light blue, thin liquid sloshing about. He uncorked it for me, bringing the cold glass to my lips. My hand joined his in tipping the potion back, and I closed my eyes again, waiting for it to take affect.
"Scorpius looks like he's had ten bags of sweets." Chuckled Draco, looking over his right shoulder to his wide-eyed son. "He's going to self-combust and go into a sugar high, I'm sure of it. It is rather sweet, though. They definitely did their homework with all of this." He swirled the contents around in his own mug, before taking another sip.
The dark room became pin-drop silent. The only thing that could be heard was Draco's heavy breathing.
"It seems you should know. After all, you go having conversations with her about me, so isn't it obvious?" I said, grumbling. I felt my metamorphmagus begin to wear off as my mind let thoughts swirl and fester into a self-deprecating storm. We entered the bathroom.
"I know we haven't hung out in a while, but... I have a question to ask you," she said as she let go of my hands.
Things were moving smoothly. Everyone was calm, and finally, for the first time in forever, I was able to actually talk to Ron and Hermione without a giant threat or disaster looming over us. It was the most at peace I'd felt with them since we were children.
"I... I'll stop now," said Teddy, shying away in his seat. His hair turned a slightly darker orange than Ron's. I abruptly stood from the table. Draco followed swiftly.
"You're safe now." He whispered into my ear, placing a small kiss on my head. I only continued what I was doing, feeling too overwhelmed for anything else. I only slightly felt his fingers weave into my hair, as he so often did, trying to soothe me as best he could.
It seems Harry isn't much different now... I was deep in thought, but was snapped out of it at the sound of Gran-Hermione's voice.
"Didn't you lot of idiots hear what Longbottom said on the phone? He's drinking again!" I said, rage coursing through my veins.
"Wait, guys, can I come with you? I won't be a bother, I promise," Victorie responded with an eager smile, eyes brightening.
We didn't talk at all after that. The crowd finally got to the front of Hogwarts, me and Luca being squarely in the middle. There was silence among the students as Professor Neville Longbottom, who had seemingly appeared out of nowhere, raised her hand in a shushing motion.
McGonagall's office was almost as imposing as she was. The towering shelves of books lining the walls seemed to stare at me just as my fellow students did before in the Potions classroom. I looked to the floor with that thought still in my head. "I've dropped Mr. Lupin off, Headmistress. With your permission, I'll resume my activities in my classroom. Hopefully the children haven't made an awful mess." I turned around and faced Slughorn, who waited for McGonagall to speak. A nimble, yet direct and booming voice traveled from the desk in the back of the room to the door. "You may go."
The flames subsided and I was met with a quiet, grey-looking Grimmauld place. I followed the solem sound of piano notes being played slowly, plainly. It wasn't music, they were just... notes. Ascending and descending, changing keys, just... patterns. I walked slowly finding myself in the drawing room. It was Malfoy who was playing those patterns on the piano- scales done slowly, as if he'd just figured them out.
I didn't eat it all, but I definitely ate more than I would've a few months ago, and that was more than enough for Draco to notice, and smile about it, which made me smile in turn, releasing a helpless sort of shrug.
"It still gives them no right." He mumbled sleepily into my shoulder. I turned around so that I could hold him for a while, instead of him holding me, and he allowed it, wordlessly falling into the same position I was in only moments earlier while my arms were loosely draped over him as he fell into me. I turned, letting my lips brush up against his neck before he turned and I gave him a small, gentle kiss on the lips.
"Harry, If you will," Kingsley began again, "I would like the three of you to join the investigation." Harry's mouth snapped shut. I was entirely too nervous to say anything, staying firmly in my spot and not getting involved. Harry placed his left palm firmly on the desk-on the statue case file- and leaned in close to Kingsley- dangerously close. I couldn't help but notice he'd forgotten to transfigure the scar on his hand.
I was briefly jolted from my mind as I felt the phone in my pocket vibrate. It was safe to assume that was Ginny checking up on me. I ignored it.
"Well, some people say it's because it makes them feel. Others argue that it stops them from feeling, as in, stops them feeling the pain in their mind. Many say that it's a cry for help- a sign that they want help." I blinked a couple of times, taking in her words.
"Yes. Draco Malfoy the pure blooded wizard, living in the Muggle World, cooking like a Muggle, going to the market, buying Muggle entertainment, watching Muggle movies, befriending Muggles-"
My head snapped up, and suddenly the entire flight of stairs I was missing was scaled in a second, before I found myself in front of Scorpius' room door, slightly out of breath, trying to catch it as quietly as possible.
"I don't know, I..." he sighed as we stopped, Professor Longbottom assembling us into files. As far as I was concerned, Luca and Victorie hadn't said a word to each other.
"You alright there?" I heard Draco ask, snapping me out of my thoughts. I looked up at him in confusion.
"Hey, I'll pick up Rose. You go home and fix yourself a nice cup of tea, okay?" She looked at me with eyes that could only be described as fiery and fierce, if they were directed at anyone else. But, I could see her silent resignation as she swallowed her pride, taking another deep breath.
"March second! Does that sound important to you?" He continued, prodding at the situation. That was when it dawned on me.
"He didn't want people to know he'd left. He was scared the Prophet would follow him." Interrupted Weasley's sister. "Besides, why do you want to know?" She added sourly. I was about to snap at her, when Hermione stepped into the conversation.
I shuddered, remembering that as one of the two times I'd accidentally electrocuted uncle Vernon, except that time, I knew about magic, and so did he. I felt an uncomfortable pit forming in my stomach, and suddenly everything felt cold. I turned my head and noticed Draco fell back to sleep, so I turned around and hugged him tightly, in need of comfort. He returned it. I felt my headache return, causing me to scrunch my face.
"I put your needs before mine... I went with you, I wasn't going to let you go alone." He hadn't replied to a word I said, and I wasn't sure if it was good or bad as I saw him tense to suppress the quiver beneath his bottom lip.
I took her into a soft hug, my hands shaking, but she didn't hug back, though I knew she was grateful for it. She leaned into me, crying. Things were stiff and silent.
Getting ready was... hectic. Everyone was scrambling around everywhere and the kids were beyond excited to go somewhere new and adventurous, especially after getting a look at the brochures.
The room had gone as stiff and silent as Harry. I discreetly went to take his hand. Dr. Gilroy sighed.
"I understand. Don't worry. It's not your fault that I did some wrong back then, and it's not your fault that the Ministry and apparently now the MACUSA have a target on my back." I said, quite plainly. After all, it was fact, and you can't deny something so candid and in your face.
bit of history, that Tom Riddle had a child. One more person," I scanned the room, eyes landing on a rather young reporter. "Yes, go ahead."
I sighed. "I just want to read my book in peace. Why are they even having a party? The holiday is tomorrow, not today."
"Harry." I started; taking his hands. "They're just kids that are probably on holiday with their families. They probably have no idea that you or I are even in this country." I reasoned softly.
"Just... With Wendy and Bonnie going to Luca. I-I know they're his friends, too, but we were going to meet up all the same." I looked down, sighing.
"Go on, you can sit right by her." I told Scorpius, gesturing towards her gravestone. This is the first time I visit her since she's passed, and I'm glad to be able to do it with Scorpius. I sat down next to him, in front of her. With a swift movement of my wand I cleaned it up, and then I conjured her some flowers, placing them next to some others she had there- probably from her sister, but I wouldn't know.
"The kids stay on the pullout couch, and us adults get either room," Hermione announced. I turned to her, almost ready to protest my son sleeping on the
"Agreed. I quite enjoy doing this with you," I replied, before turning around to face him. He grumbled and held me closer.
The conversation between me, Ron, and Draco carried on like that for a long time- awkward and tense. We could barely get through a sentence about the Ministry before I found myself overly agitated and biting out all of my words. Ron left just over a half hour later, giving me a pat on the back, and an "I'll tell Hermione you said hi."
"Ted, come on..." He was slowly sitting up, wiping his face. Wendy glanced at him for a second but continued looking through his bag.
"...Anyway." I said sheepishly. Luca looked up and wiped his tears. "We are close to winter break. What does that mean for you?"
I heard as  'Fernsby, Bonnie' got sorted into Hufflepuff. 'Loughty Aminata'- the girl who punched me last week- got sorted into Ravenclaw. A boy I don't know, named 'Lundy, Wendell' got sorted into Hufflepuff; then,
"And how on earth did Malfoy see it? Malfoy. I mean, how did this all change so quickly? How is it, that all thanks to Malfoy, now suddenly Harry talks to us again, only to go off and-" my breath caught in my throat. I couldn't say it. I'd said it before but now, I couldn't. I closed my eyes, allowing my self to just catch my breath as tears clogged my chest. I hugged Ron desperately, crying into him. I felt an arm come around me, rubbing up and down my back in comfort.
I stayed silent, waiting for the next thing to come out. Scorpius grasped his sheets, exhaling sharply, his mouth left agape.
I haven't spoken to Draco about anything of significance, and he hasn't either. It's a silent sort of agreement we have, I guess. Today though, I'm going to break it. I'm going to break it because I'm selfish and needy and this week has just been bad. I haven't slept in months, and now the nightmares are starting to come back. One night I woke up and left to the bathroom, where I got myself through a panic attack. I've also been carrying my wand on me since we moved, just in case.
I was fully aware that this- without a doubt- qualified as petty complaining, and that it wasn't going to get me anywhere, but I also couldn't help it. I cried, so what? It's better this way anyway. I don't bother people as much if I keep it to myself.
The conversation died down again, though. Luna still stood patiently in the corner and Draco had wandered back off to the kitchen while Ginny and I just... stood. With each passing second, it hit me a little more how much we'd changed, like a bludger to the chest.
"Ted, I... I'm sorry." Luca's face was red, and he looked down. "There's been so much happening, and there are so many... letters." He sniffled.
"You know, I don't really need the medicine so badly, Draco. We can just... go home." I told him. I saw his smile become serious, as had mine.
"Draco, it's the middle of the night. He could be anywhere. Let's stop. We'll keep looking for him tomorrow." Pleaded Hermione.
I sat up in the bed, not really sure what to do or say. I stared at him, long and calculating. But before I could open my mouth to speak, he did so.
They asked him standard things, I'm guessing. She rolled the questions out like routine: his age, possible allergies, medications, his last meal- thanks to me, his last meal was breakfast that very day. Though, it wasn't as much food as he probably should have had.
"I brought you a comfortable change of clothes, and a hoodie, since I figured you would want something cozy." Harry glanced up at me, letting slip the ghost of a smile. He got up and changed, leaving the room with me afterwards, wearing an expression of genuine relief. I brought my arm around his waist as we walked side by side.
"You are... SO bad," Gabriel said while bent over and trying to catch his breath. I saw him do this only because I was on the floor looking up and the three figures standing over to me.
I turned around in bed, unable to fall back to sleep because of the early morning sunlight trickling in through the shaded windows. When I met Harry's sleeping form, I couldn't help but sigh, feeling a sort of sad sympathy for him.
Draco jumped in with a retaliation on the tip of his tongue: "But didn't you say at the hospital last week that you were quitting? Just do it. What's the worst that happens, you get sacked? You've already put in your two weeks notice-"
I woke with a tremendous jolt, my breath in my throat, and shaking. I couldn't recognize where I was, and my mind trailed to my overly vague dream of being trapped again. It was just,
"I'm doing alright, Honestly. What about you? It's been a while, eh?" I felt stiffness seeping through my skin, giving me goosebumps. I shifted slightly in my seat.
I tell him everything, it... how could he possibly look up to me? Trust me? When I've been so vile and cruel... how could I possibly be expected to sit him down and say 'I'm so sorry, Scorpius, but your amazing father is not perfect, and he has done things so exceedingly unforgivable, that now the entire Wizarding world thinks we're both evil.' How can I sit him down and say it's my fault that people will want to stay away from him? That I ruined his life all in the name of... what? Something as stupid as saving my own parents? Mother and father... they were awful people, and I didn't care because they loved me and cared about me..." Draco's breath hitched, and he began to cry through his speech.
"Harry please look at me." I waited in silence for him to open his eyes, and when he did, they were clouded over, hazy.
"What do you expect from me?" I said with a smile, concentrating on the chicken beside me. "My son wanted black bean soup, and I needed an ingredient."
"My happiest memory was the one where I got to think of the chance to leave this hell! You-you hurt me. You punished me by locking me in-in that horrid,
I got up and left P-Harry in the room, and made sure Scorpius was in his room. Then, I went to the living room waiting for either floo, apparition, or a knock at the door. Soon enough, my fireplace roared to life, revealing a worried Ginny Weasley.
Moments went by, and the other students' conversations grew louder. Rose's face was her usual neutral expression, though she didn't look like she was frowning. Her eyes were alert.
"I-I don't know!" I said defensively. "She walked up to my house banging on the door, and when I answered it, she told me there was this movie, and it's about us! Us as Wizards! The Wizarding World. And she showed me a Muggle photo of people that look like you, Harry, and Ron." I told her, stumbling through my words. She looked at me in utter disbelief.
"It's okay, Harry. Shacklebolt said himself that Ron's recovering, just take a breath- St. Mungo's Hospital!" We were taken over by green flames.
"I'm going to make sure you keep taking them until I know a doctor has told you otherwise." He said matter-of-factly.
"Is anybody else thinking of that one Harry Potter character? Malfoy's son I forgot- what was his name?" asked one girl wearing round glasses. Water poured into the vehicle, soaking my shoes, and making a believable excuse for my now tense demeanor.
"Draco's right, mate," Ron continued. "I saw it with my own eyes. I even felt the pain in my own head when you hit the column.
I woke up the next morning facing the wall, and with Harry hugging me from behind. I slept the whole night, and I think he did the same. I turned around to face him, happy at the thought that he got a full nights sleep.
I went rigid, almost having lost my ability to speak. Placing a cautious hand on her shoulder, one she only slightly flinched at, I gently pried her from the pages of the book, ignoring the striking pain that shot across my forehead, the pang in my chest, and the twist of my gut as I remembered that day. She turned around, rising from the chair and taking me into a crushing hug, stifling sobs. I stroked her soft, brown hair as she collapsed into me, her grip becoming weaker as she held back emotions.
The Hogwarts champion had a choice, then: which one of the other champions would she choose to follow. There was no other way to go. Stopping for a few seconds, she eventually followed the Beauxbatons champion.
Draco kept glancing towards me, and for the life of me, I couldn't figure out what he meant with every glance. Dinner went by a bit too quietly.
"I'm... I'm gonna be there in a second!" Scorpius shouted. Draco and I hurriedly took two large strides into the house to discover that Scorpius was at the top of the flight of stairs. His breaths seemed quick, and he was swinging his arms back and forth and grasping at his vest. Draco's eyes widened in horror, and he became stiff.
"Alright, alright. Then yes, I guess his is fine." I answered, looking at him bewildered as he so monotonously listed off the worst things Harry could possibly be doing as if it wasn't absolutely horrifying to think of, let alone imagine. Then, painful realization dawned on me, like ice across my veins. I furrowed my brows, stepping forward slowly. "He's not..." I swallowed, taking a breath. "He's not... been doing that stuff... right?"
"Like what?" He asked. I responded by giving him a light kiss on the neck, before letting go of the hug.
I sat there for another few moments before getting up and leaving, deciding it would be the best thing to do at the moment.
"Harry..." She stood up with a sigh, getting her plate and Rose's, taking them to the sink. Teddy nudged me, gaining my attention.
"I was just speaking to Harry about the importance of knowing how different people may communicate their affection, and how we may not always realize the different ways people show us that they love us. If it would interest you, there's a book titled 'The 5 Love Languages' by Gary Chapman. It's an interesting read, and it talks about that stuff. For now, though, I think it might help if you both took this online quiz, created by the same man. Knowing your primary love language may help in continuing your relationship and making sure the two of you understand each other."
Suddenly, his determined expression was centimeters from me and both of his hands were gripping my shoulders harshly.
"That's okay." I whispered, before clearing my throat, speaking normally. "It doesn't matter how it happened, or what clicked in your brain... who cares that Hermione doesn't understand, or that none of us do? Who cares? Because it's here, and it's real. You've just proven that." I said as we stared into each other's eyes intently. "We don't need to understand everything..." we stayed still for a few seconds, and I broke the silence. "Are you alright?"
"The man whose hand you are currently breaking," replied Draco, though he was supporting her all the same as he complained about her grip.
His eyes turned at the wand inches from his face, and I could see Harry out of the corner of my eye, struggling to keep himself together.
"It was an interesting read, and if you want it for reference on our Astronomy assignment, you'll find what Professor Sinistra went over in chapter four." She said while rummaging through her bag. She turned around and handed me the large and heavy book.
I heard Rose sigh next to me, collecting her things and getting up. She looked at me, looking already exhausted. Glancing back up at her, I couldn't help but chuckle a bit. I'm glad she's here, at least.
"Really? Last year? " questioned Wendy, shaking his head. Luca nodded. "She's always doing things she shouldn't," Bonnie giggled, and Wendy let out a shy smile.
did to Maria, a No-Maj, we sent our department to rectify the situation, successfully, I might add, and-"
I didn't realize I was dozing off until I heard the front door open and close. Given that no alarms were set off, I figured it would be Harry. When I opened my eyes to be met with him staring back at me, I was proven correct. I blinked a couple of times before patting Scorpius's back, signaling for him to let me get up. He did so.
"Remember: if anything happens, call me immediately. Shacklebolt won't mind letting me go. He knows I want to be there for you."
"Oh... Hey Ted!" Bonnie exclaimed, a grin painting her features, even seeming malicious for a second. Wendy noticed us entering and gave a single wave in greeting.
"It's okay. That's actually the first joke I've heard you make in a while." I replied after a moment. I saw the ghost of a smile come, bringing a small chuckle with it, before both left his face just as quickly, without a trace.
We all sat down and began eating. I took note that although Weasley's eating habits hadn't changed, he was now much more neat about it. Rose has her foods separated. Teddy and Scorpius are the same. Harry and what seems to be his more recent small demeanor was eating little bits slowly.
"Happy Birthday, Draco," I whispered, pushing away the countless what if's that rolled through me, just focusing on the feeling of us and his hand in mine, and how he was squeezing, and how I could feel his smile and how soft and gentle and happy he was.
Things seemed really quite fine. Sensitive topics were brought up, but nobody pried. Besides, it's all in good nature when there are people catching up. You look for common ground. You ask and answer questions they want, to seem more interesting, and to build a strong network of people. Of course though, I was not looking to build a network with Vernon and Petunia anytime soon. Dudley though, seemed helpful. And maybe mending my friendship with Millie wouldn't be the worst idea. She was a strong ally back at Hogwarts. I was pulled from my thoughts when Vernon asked a question towards Harry, who was significantly more calm now than he was when we arrived.
The Hogwarts band was putting their equipment away. They played the opening waltz for the champions' opening, it was really quite pretty, though I wasn't really used to that music.
Every breath was painful, and I lay on the bed, gaping like a fish while I cried helplessly. I hated the wave of uncomfortable warmth that always accompanied this. It always made me feel like if I touched my face I'd burn.
"You're scared to tell him things because you get anxious when it comes to saying anything at all, at least anything that, in your mind, will cause something bad to happen. You rely on him in many ways, and if he were to react poorly to your words, you would blame yourself for it, because that's how you've been conditioned to think."
"I called you over because I know what happened with Ginny last week. I just wanted to let you know I didn't get the idea from you. I've thought it over plenty of times over the last decade." I felt my chest tighten, and my jaw tense. I suddenly felt a pressure on my heart that I hadn't felt before. It's never pleasant to entertain the idea of your own absence, not ever, especially not for a whole ten years- I should know, I've contemplated it for far longer without telling a soul.
I never told anyone this, but... the memory I use to cast a Patronus Charm is the memory of my 11th birthday, when Hagrid told me about being a wizard and going to a far off school. I was happy because of the sheer idea of getting a chance to leave the Dursleys."
I shoved it all to the back of my mind. I didn't want to be weak today, or ever again. I couldn't afford to have a panic attack like that in front of Hermione again.
"Maybe in America, but, No. I think what Arthur is thinking about is U.P.S." Hermione then shook her head quickly. "Anyway, No. It's not a package. Uhm." She grabbed a hold of Ron's hand and rested them atop the table for everyone to see. In that split second, my gaze turned to Ginny's. She had probably heard the news from Ron the day it happened, albeit having to decipher it from his hysterical crying. For a moment, even with the eternal distance that stood between us, we both felt mutual happiness for Ron and Hermione. We both smiled at each other. I said nothing as Ginny threw a quick look at Hermione.
Before I had a chance to react, the hat yelled "Slytherin!" as more than one set of cheers were heard from the Slytherin table. But I couldn't help but notice the stares that were being sent my way. Keeping the hat's words in memory, I hastily went to sit down, shrinking into myself as much as I could.
After that, I felt Draco stop hugging me so he could grab my wrists and hold them against his chest, pressing them down.
Scorpius had wet himself again, and Draco had to clean him and his sheets. I noticed that it's something Scorpius is quite embarrassed by. The nights when he does it, with short quick steps, and facing down, he'll go to the bathroom red-faced.
Y'all might scream at me for this chapter but I love it so much. The character development, the DRAMa... oh, this chapter is definitely in my top 10.
I noticed Harry seemed to be subconsciously scratching his arms. I moved my hands over to him to stop him by moving his hand away from his arm. Kind of like how I nudge Scorpius' hands down away from his face to get him to stop biting his nails.
"You're too old for this." I mumbled, letting him make his way to my back and hooking his arms around my neck and his legs around my waist.
My next intent was to make sure P-Harry was okay. That argument can't have affected him in any positive way, however, when I entered the room I saw him curled up and sleeping in the corner of the bed, as if he was trying to use as little space as possible. His face showed one of sadness, yet he seemed more at peace than I'd seen him at all since we reentered each other's lives. I decided to lay down myself, that argument, as well as today's events, had taken a bit out of me. I realized how close to the edge Harry was and put him closer to the middle where he wouldn't fall. We fell asleep next to each other.
After becoming eerily calmed, and having red lines over old scars on both of my arms, I washed the blade and hid it again, before rinsing the blood off and dabbing my small slits with toilet paper, which I then promptly flushed down the toilet. I took another deep breath, grateful to have been able to calm down.
"Guys really please stop... Malfoy looks like he's having one of those fits Harry used to get-" I tried explaining, while glancing towards Malfoy.
The anger was brewing in my mind, like a violent storm that was long overdue. I gripped my freshly injured arm, digging my thumb into the cut. Blood gushed and my insides curled. I hissed in pain before letting out a scream of pain, letting go off of reflex. My thumb was now covered in blood, it was under my nail, and running slowly to the rest of my hand, which turned into a tight fist, digging my nails into my palm. I sobbed violently.
"Then what's the deal talking to him about your problems? As my family would say: para de comer mierda y haz lo que necesitas. [stop eating shit and go do what you need to do]."
He was especially embarrassed the first time it had happened: I woke up when I felt his urine seep through the sheets of Draco's bed, and woke them both up, pointing out the stain, which was also on Scorpius' pants. He was worried because he 'didn't feel the pee'. Draco was confused as well, and it wasn't until I stepped in, saying I used to wet myself, that Scorpius calmed down.
"I was silent when I shouldn't have been. Kept quiet, even after seeing so much hardship around me." The pressure on my chest was unbearable. I gently exhaled after realizing my breaths were quickening.
Scorpius was sitting on his bed in front of me, waiting for me to finish writing, tapping his fingers on his knees.
The point is, they care about us because it's their job... They have to, even if they're bad at showing it."
"You'd think a four year old named them," he said, shaking his head slightly, a small smile fighting to try and reach him.
"Kingsley, If you need, I can work part-time here, since we're short-staffed, and this is all becoming so complicated... George will understand. And Besides," Ron turned to me. "I want to help."
I heard him take shuddering gasps, and it became clear to me he was crying. My actions slowed, and I realized that stubborn persistence was not going to help him. My body swayed as I stood helplessly on the other side of the stall door, listening quietly as the rustling and moving around began again, only interrupted by gasps and sniffles coming from Luca's attempts to stop crying.
I exhaled, trying to reassure myself, feeling my leg bouncing up and down. I stuck my head out of the cabin, craning my neck to look further into the aisle.
"What presents did you get, Scorpius?" Asked Rose. I smiled, taking a seat next to her and settled in to play with the other kids.
He shoved away from me playfully "hey, at least I went through the trouble of doing it the Muggle way..." I searched his eyes with curiosity, before it all clicked in my brain.
He scooted closer to me. "Are you sure you'll be alright? You're looking a little bit pale..." his voice trailed off. I could barely focus on him because all of my thoughts were stuck on this waiting dread that consumed me.
"I'm not his father, he's not my son, and I'd be overstepping. That's what Draco does and I can't take that from him I-I... He's- it's not..."
"Don't interrupt me!" I said, feeling as my breathing became of minimal focus. "You know- everyone knows, it's my fault! I need to take responsibility for this. I need to help Ginny! I need to help raise James-"
"I don't know why people talk to him, let alone come near him- especially you." I gave a puzzled look, trying to mask the hurt at her words. She continued speaking:
"I-I-I'm going to- to the- room." I stuttered, suddenly unable to properly speak. "I'll see you there later. Please."
"You're not as heavy as I expected." I heard him say in a strained voice, as he finally picked me up.
That was when the door creaked open, revealing Draco. Without a word, Scorpius put his wand back down on the bed and then promptly ran into him, wrapping his arms around his father's torso, squeezing tight. Draco instantly returned the hug, rubbing a comforting and fond up-and-down on Scorpius' back, a small smile falling onto his worn and tired face.
Teddy was using his Metamorphagus again, though not as much as he used to, still. He's growing up rather quickly, and he's quite the kind young man. He's respectful around the adults, and gets along with Rose, and Scorpius especially, given they were each other's first friend. I've also come to notice Teddy to be a bit shy.
"Hey." I whispered. "Dinner is almost ready." I said, resting my hand in his hair. He stirred, before muttering.
"Just be careful around him. Don't pull out your wand unannounced. And try to stay calm whenever you're around him..." she swallowed hard. I waited a bit before figuring this is where I need to say something.
I swiped the magazines on Sirius' bed aside, emptying the drawer full of parchments over the cleared area, searching. I found letters from my father, mother, and Pettigrew, as well as an overwhelming amount of letters from Remus, but no piece of photo. The notebooks were filled with writings and scribbling, from class notes to personal notes, and even randomly placed, out-of-order diary entries, but no photo. My haste grew with every failed attempt to find it, and I continued to search. I opened all of the drawer, cabinets and closets, my breathing picking up and shallowing as I searched in corners, under clothing, inside the pockets of so, so many leather jackets, and even under the mattress of his bed, picking up clouds of dust when I dropped it back onto its frame.
I didn't want to stop because my mind was running wild trying to understand everything. But as he hugged me tight, I realized he's correct. So I cuddled into him, my mind buzzing and teeming with thoughts. And eventually, we fell asleep.
"It May have slipped your notice, but people are meant to shower every day. Besides you'll smell even more 'decent' after a shower."
It's been about a week since Teddy and Scorpius had their play date. The Malfoys came for dinner yesterday, Thursday, and the kids gleefully watched children's films until it was time for them to part ways. It's quite interesting how they get along so quickly and easily. The 3 of us are getting used to being around each other now. There's always an awkward encounter, especially more between Malfoy  and I. I've only had one fit all week, that being on Tuesday. Ginny and I had gotten into an argument about me being involved in the family. Today, Ginny had the day off so we spent it helping Teddy with his studies. Now it was around 5 o'clock and I'm sitting on the couch with Teddy helping him read a book titled Big Nate. Soon enough, Ginny walked in from upstairs.
I thought to myself, almost as if I had just realized that. I quickly shook the thought away, getting out of the hug.
Shirt forgotten on the bathroom floor, arms veiny and trembling, supporting him against the sink, back arched miserably, tears down each pale cheek- pooling at his chin and dripping helplessly- hair ragged, messy, unkept.
"I'd had a dream. I didn't want to think about it. When I woke up, I just reached over to hug you, but you weren't there, so I got up."
Enjoy!!! I really liked writing this chapter and exploring the dynamic that is out enormous Weasley family.
I let his words settle in my mind, thinking them over. I supposed he was right to an extent. The care of a parent, it's... It's not even about that...
"The hospital is only trying to stop me from running around like a mad man and jumping off a building," he said casually. I tensed. "But it's not like I would do that, you know that. I told them that. I shouldn't have to stay here."
"How did you manage..." my voice trailed, awe-struck by the effort he put into tonight, and his nonchalant tone towards its end result.
Hermione turned to him before addressing the rest of the table. "Yes, but, I don't see any other possibility on who it could be." She clarified. Then, Ron spoke up:
"Ron and Hermione are going to be here soon to pick you up, so after this, we're going to get you in the shower, and ready for the day, alright?" I turned around at Draco's words.
"Hm?" Was what came out of his mouth as he remained in his position: curled up and facing away from me.
"When I call your name, you will put on the hat and sit on the stool to be sorted." Said Headmistress McGonagall. Listened intently for my name.
"No." He protested, still looking and sounding half-asleep. "What's up?" He moved to rest his head on my chest, wrapping his arms around my waist and snuggling into me. I sighed.
"Scorpius... you know that I love you, right? And that everything I do, I do it considering what I think might help you the most?" Scorpius nodded, and I took another breath, half from relief, and half to expel the last of my nerves.
"Dudley, Harry's cousin, and Millicent, his girlfriend. She is a witch, just like us. Dudley is not."
wrong. He'd be locked up in Azkaban right now not chasing Harry like a lovesick puppy!" She claimed.
"Easy for you to say isn't it." He shot back. I kept my head down trying to hide my anger. My leg was bouncing up and down rapidly. I focused on stopping the movement. Just then, Neville stood abruptly. "I'll be in the restroom." he said before leaving.
The pool was enormous- I mean, absolutely enormous. And I was only slightly jealous when a small group of teenage girls took to ogling my boyfriend. I retaliated by staring them down before tugging Draco by his upper arm and taking him in for a kiss. We smiled at each other, and admittedly, for a second I hated that he was wearing sunglasses; I couldn't see his eyes through them.
"We haven't done anything in a while. What do you think?" He said, voice low as he stared intently into my eyes.
"Right down the hall..." I said, still thinking about his first question. He stood from the table and put his dishes in the kitchen sink before turning towards the bathroom. I stopped myself from asking if he needed the toilet specifically. I had to trust him at least slightly with private affairs, but I felt uneasy. My hand subconsciously went towards my chin as that same same question lingered in my mind
I felt a shocking rush of cold air as Harry opened the shower curtain, at least, I thought it was Harry. Who else would walk into the bathroom knowing I'm fully naked?
"Look... I get that it's tough. I wouldn't want to do it either, but he just wants to know... and wouldn't him not knowing make life more difficult? When he gets to Hogwarts, well, basically everyone over there will know, and then you've got-"
"Do you feel better?" He whispered into my ear, hugging me close from the side, letting me lean into his chest and shoulder a bit more. I watched the blue light as it traveled from his fingertips, sinking into my arm, through my scars, into my veins.
"How could a conversation so good have led to what it did? Asked Draco vaguely, knowing I understood what he meant.
"Hi Draco... I'm fine. I'm better now. I've figured some stuff out that will make everything better."
Molly and her sister Lucy were both sorted into Gryffindor, and Dominique, Victorie's sister, was sorted into Ravenclaw. As soon as everyone was seated, Headmaster Mcgonagall began her speech.
"Oh, good morning Victorie... S-Sorry," I stuttered, rushing to help her up and pick up some of her books that had dropped to the floor. I extended my hand to her, which she grasped with a surprisingly firm grip.
Hermione and I both furrowed our brows in confusion. Draco just stared in disbelief, entirely unaware of what Arthur was talking about.
Thankfully, the next morning, Harry did not protest the idea of visiting Godric's Hollow Cemetery. Scorpius slept soundly last night, and although he wet himself again, it was no setback. Though I must admit, it's worrying me slightly. I need to find books and do research on that. Hopefully, he doesn't need a healer.
"You mean to tell me that I know how to work the buttons in your own car, and you can't?" I looked at him with amusement.
"The last type are what we call Muggleborns. They're wizards and witches who don't have any magic in their family at all. They're the only ones." I waited for Scorpius to nod or ask a question before continuing.
"That wasn't so bad. Although; I don't remember him ever being described as such a slim person." Said Hermione.
"He's always been 'floating through life' in a sense. He's only ever lived for seemingly one reason, and that reason is gone. I..." my eyes widened in realization. "Malfoy is part of that reason. Wh-what if. What if this is Harry holding on to the only thing people know him for. He's never not been somehow related to Voldemort and his death eaters... I... but Malfoy has been nothing like he used to be... No. It doesn't add up. And where on earth did the whole 'being into blokes' come into the picture? I mean. It's not like I never noticed... but he never said anything, he never did anything-"
I finished it in haste, focusing too much on my breathing and too much on what Scorpius brought up to really care about how the sandwich came out. As long as it looked presentable enough... Scorpius can eat this. It's fine.
"I-I can't. Please, le- I need air, light." I said through shallow breaths and a deeply furrowed brow.
"I had just thought about things. Some of the things that had driven us apart." I said, not really wanting to continue.
"Yes, well, let's see here," he started with a sigh, pulling out a parchment to read. "Draco Malfoy was hiding in the No-Maj world, and in the process, grew close relations with a Maria Jimenez-" another sigh "-in the height of what is possibly the largest threat to the statue of secrecy in history." He met my fury-laden gaze with a cold, soulless one. "Then, he seemingly obliviated her, and left without reporting the incident to MACUSA."
All of the students that were sitting looked at us, and I noticed everyone had empty golden plates in front of them. There was no food in sight. We all watched in silence as Headmistress McGonagall brought a four legged stool in front of the line of us first years. On top of the stool she placed a brown pointed Wizard's hat.
Harry... open your eyes, please." I didn't know anymore whether to listen to the voice inside my head, the one trying to trick me into thinking it was okay...
