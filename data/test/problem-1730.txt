Harry immediately walked around his desk, closing the distance between them. He stopped directly in front of Draco, staring down at him with concern. “You didn’t barge in. I wasn’t busy, I promise. What’s wrong, Draco?”
Roland began snapping his fingers at the young server across the room.
Draco hooked his feet around Harry’s waist, digging his heels in. His prick was already hard again, the leaking head rubbing against Harry’s hard abdomen, smearing pre-cum against Harry’s tanned skin as he roughly fucked him.
“I forgive you, sweetie,” Harry said softly, pressing a chaste kiss to Scorpius’ forehead.
It was almost impossible to believe that Narcissa would never mention the Malfoy lineage and all of their illicit involvements.
, his mind whispered, tears leaking from the corner of his eyes.
”How much?” Harry asked gruffly.
It wasn’t even the word that did it for him. It was what the word encompassed. He was Draco’s mate, his lover, the
Harry reached around his rabbit’s chest with both hands, pinching his pink, pebbled nipples between his clawed fingers. He slowly began rolling the small nubs between his knuckles, his cock throbbing harder with each whimper and moan the boy released.
, with eyes so light gray they almost appeared silver under the right light…
“You can stop whenever you want to, baby. I’d never let
Draco had Scorpius dressed in small green jumper that matched his eyes paired with khaki trousers. He was dressed similarly, though he had chosen a navy jumper with black slacks. For the umpteenth time, he nervously ran his fingers through his hair.
Harry trumped him in age and experience, but Draco was his chosen mate. If he wanted this
Draco shot up from the bench, tightening his hold on Scorpius. “I have to go.”
“If you insist…I suppose it would be all right, just for a short while,” Draco murmured.
Draco sucked in sharp inhale, leaning into Harry’s touch. “Why are you so good to me, Harry?”
Harry’s fingers slowed, imagining bending the boy over on his kitchen table and fucking him from behind. He would fuck him that way just to feel that tuft of fur brushing against his lower stomach each time he would viciously pump into his rabbit.
He leaned down and nuzzled Draco’s scent gland, lightly scraping his teeth over it, making the boy’s breath hitch.
After leaving Pansy, he rushed into the living area of his flat just in time to see the emerald flames flare to life within it, signaling the arrival of someone.
The vise around Draco’s heart infinitesimally loosened. “Did we do…
He gave Harry a shaky smile. “O-Okay, Harry. Thank you for inviting us. I hope your friends like us.”
”Then you’d see,” Harry hissed gratingly. “You’d see how much you
Harry pulled his shirt off over his head and stood up. He crooked his finger at the boy. “Come to Dada. Now.”
He’d escorted a few prisoners to Azkaban during his Auror days, and the interior of the prison remained unchanged.
Hermione nodded thoughtfully. “That’s an acute observation. Speaking of children, that’s why I popped by. Ron told me about Narcissa and her son. Do you want to tell me why you volunteered to take him in?”
“I’m from the Ministry of Magic. I’m Harry Potter. Your mother told me you would be out here. There’s another Auror inside asking her some questions, so I thought I’d come out and speak with you.”
He couldn’t discern Harry’s facial expression in the darkness but parted his lips eagerly when Harry leaned down and pressed his lips to his. It was a brief kiss, but their tongues swept against each other in a way that made Draco’s heart clench.
he became pregnant, he could hatch a plan to escape with his baby. He couldn’t let someone like
Harry groaned, peppering kisses against the boy’s hole, cheeks, and tender thighs.
Harry pressed down on the back of Draco’s head, sinking his shaft further down his throat.
“I’m doing all right. I’m just here to visit someone. Are you still working in the fertility ward?”
He felt unbearably hot, unable to tear his his eyes away from Harry wanking himself, a cruel smile on his full lips.
He bit his lower lip between his teeth, his cock throbbing under his touch. It was all wrong. His hands were too soft, he needed the rough touch of…
He quickly pushed to another one of his memories.
He knew that Lucius would be less than pleased when he learned the truth about Scorpius’ father, but he wasn’t planning on going anywhere and Lucius would have to accept that.
Who else is in love with Harry? ✋😔
Harry was standing beside the sofa, staring down at him with that emotionless mask firmly in place.
The scent that met his nostrils made him halt, a low growl escaping him. He hadn’t smelled it in a while, but it was unmistakable to him.
It was from Hermione.
“Yes, you may, but don’t eat any sweets. I’m making dinner soon and I don’t want you to ruin your appetite.”
,” Harry gasped.
His black-clawed fingertips pressed into the boy’s pale skin, red marks blossoming underneath them. It was obscenely erotic to Harry and obscenely

you, my sweet baby. Did you miss me, darling?”
The boy blinked, confusion evident in his large, pale eyes. His ears flattened against the back of his head and he wrinkled his small nose.
He ignored the stab of guilt at the mention of Theo’s disappearance and glared up at Harry.
Harry set the small, bristly creature in the middle of his bed and laid down next to him.
He couldn’t keep the derision from his voice, jealousy stinging him at the thought of his Alpha being around his
Harry swiped his thumb across his swollen nipple, hungrily watching as a dribble of semi-opaque liquid beaded on the rosy tip.
The only question left was…did Harry
He was thirty-six with set responsibilities and plans that didn’t include an eighteen-year-old Draco Malfoy or his young son.
Harry allowed it before craning his neck to glance down the boy’s nude body.
Harry sighed. “Dada has to run some errands, sweet one. I’ll be back shortly. Try to get some sleep. I’ll bring back treats.”
“It wasn’t your fault, Hermione,” he said softly. “You couldn’t have known.”
in his heart, Hermione almost couldn’t stand it. She couldn’t stand to think of her best friend letting something like that eat away at him until there was nothing left of the boy from their childhood.
Draco moaned and spread his legs as Harry pressed his hips between them. Harry smelled like alcohol, but his pheromones were still potent enough to overpower the scent, fucking with Draco’s head.
Harry leaned forward, his lips pressing against Draco’s ear before he whispered, “Do you think I’m a
It just wouldn’t do.
Draco shakily got his feet, casting Harry a warm, sated smile.
He shook his head, dropping his gaze to the floor.
“Why haven’t you contacted me in the past few months? I know you miss me, Draco. I could smell your scent change when you were in my arms. You were

Draco glared up at him, hatred seething in his gut. “I don’t care! I won’t stay here and be

“Maybe you’re right, Draco, but do tell me what you were planning to do with
and Draco felt rejection, the Omega inside of him wanting to prostrate himself at Harry’s feet and beg for affection.
For the umpteenth time, Harry wondered what the bloody hell was wrong with himself.
He looked mated—
Draco had found himself unable to tear his gaze away from the pallid young man, even sitting on the covered bed and just staring at the portrait some nights.
Harry scoffed, releasing his hold on his wrists, placing them flat next to Draco’s head. “Keep telling yourself that, Draco. It won’t change what sins she and her husband have committed. Above of all, the sins committed against my loved ones.”
He was beautiful.
Harry’s jaw was clenched, obviously uncomfortable with giving Draco alcohol but not wanting to argue with his request in front of his guests.  “I don’t know…”
Make it stop.
Draco turned to look back at him, worrying his lower lip between his teeth.
refreshed and had haphazardly finger-combed his hair, he ambled into the corridor outside of the bedroom and down the stairs towards the kitchen.
, Harry.”
Draco looked up, glancing around his fern. “I’m out here, Jellybean.”
He thought of the last time he had seen Draco. On his knees, begging for his mother’s life. His lovely gray eyes filled with tears, a protective arm around his stomach.
“Draco,” Harry said softly, feeling like a dolt, “what a pleasure to see you again.”
He lowered the cup back to his lap, using his other hand to pluck at a loose thread at the hem of his short-sleeved button-down that he hadn’t noticed before. He wound it around his finger, watching as his blood was cut off from the tip.
He couldn’t let sentimentality, or his forced mating bond muddle his ability to think logically.
Pansy rolled her eyes. “She won’t notice if you’re gone for just a short while. It will be quick, and I’ll cover for you if she comes to check.”

Draco held onto her longer than necessary, inhaling her unique scent. He didn’t know if he would ever see her again, so he basked in the now.
has many valued talents, I assume.”
Harry placed his hand over Hermione’s in between them on the sofa. “You’ve been good your entire life, ‘Mione. Ron can attest to that.”
“Mummy is nervous, Scorpius,” he mumbled, reaching down to push back a lock his son’s fair hair.
Harry took Ender’s wand and turned it right-side up, the handle no longer facing upward in his shaking fingers.
“Do you recognize me now, sweet one? Come here, Dada wants to see you better.”
“I knew you went into heat because your scent
Harry gaze snapped up, meeting his. “No,” he rasped. “You look...natural. You look—“

“Well,” Potter said with no inflection, “here I am.”
Harry propped his shoulder against the doorway and crossed his arms over his chest. “Standard procedure. I’m sorry we had to inconvenience you, Narcissa.”
Broken.
“Are you disobeying Dada?” Harry asked, smirking.
“I got a cut on my elbow, look!” Rose pressed one of her small elbows in Harry’s face.
When he was fully naked, he turned to help his rabbit out of his shirt.
Draco bristled, glaring at him with undisguised hatred. “
The girl was same height as him and roughly the same age, maybe a bit older. Draco couldn’t help but stare at her as she seasoned the raw meat.
Draco remained silent, staring at his bare feet.
Harry’s hands found Draco’s hips, slipping his thumbs under the hem of his jumper and pressing them into his skin.
Harry leaned down, pressing his lips to Draco’s ear. “And you will be nothing more than a

had done that.
”Hello, Hermione. I was just about to operate on this pitiful little wounded witch.”
When he realized what he had said, he froze. He glanced up at Harry from under his lashes, his cheeks hot with embarrassment.
Seeming like he was unable to stop himself, Harry leaned down further and pressed his nose into Draco’s hair, softly inhaling. “What’s there not to like?” he whispered, his warm breath gusting over the top of Draco’s ear and making him shiver.
The sound of his father’s study door locking by magic made a tendril of joy unfurl low in his belly, loving that Harry didn’t want anyone to walk in on them.

His daughter sulkily meandered over to him, wrapping her arms around his waist and burrowing her nose into his chest. Draco placed his hand on top of her head, smoothing down some of the flyaways from her dark hair.

Underneath all of the pheromones, slick, and instincts, this wasn’t what Draco wanted.

Sorry for the long wait! I hope you guys enjoy this chapter and thank you for being patient! 🖤
After an hour or two, Harry couldn’t keep his distance any longer.
In every sense of the word, Harry
“It will wane, Draco,” Harry said, his voice tight. “We just have to get through the next couple of weeks. That will be the worst of it.”
Lucius bristled, crossing his arms over his chest. “I’ll hear it from my son, then, Potter. Draco, what is your relationship with this man?”
Draco smiled, turning towards Hermione. They were both seated on her sofa in her living area.
Harry knelt, grabbing Narcissa by her upper arms and jerking her up to her feet.

Draco laid down, spreading his trembling thighs. Slick was still leaking from his hole, the sheets beneath it covered in it. He looked up at Harry for guidance, unsure what exactly he was trying to prove by making him do this.

He remained silent.
him and Draco was seeking out his scent as a balm for his frayed nerves.
With pale skin, light blond hair, and large gray eyes, the young Omega had made Harry’s heart stutter.
Sometimes, it unnerved him how perceptive his daughter was. It was why he was never able to forget what Alpha had fathered her. She showed traits of him every day. From the sly way she could get information out of people without even trying, to the way she seemed to be able to read his own thoughts just by looking at his face.
He had an idea of what that was.
Draco moaned, spreading his legs in surrender. “Harry, please
“Just leave me alone,” he whispered, feeling nothing but disgust for himself and his earlier forced confession.
of you. Don’t try to tell me how I feel. I left Ginny because of my feelings for you and I would leave the Ministry if it meant I could be with you.”
Harry leaned over slightly, the smell of his pheromones overpowering that close up. An errant strand of Harry’s dark hair brushed his cheek. Draco had to smother a whimper that was attempting to claw its way up his throat.
Harry’s smile faltered. “I’m here with Hermione and Ron. They came to see Rose for the festival. Ginny came, too.”
When Draco just stared blankly at it with hot tears silently streaming down his cheeks, Harry kicked it forward and it slid closer to Draco.
The boy pressed further back against the back of the desk, curling inward.
Even though it helped, monetary means would never erase what had been done to him.

Potter leaned down and pressed his lips to Draco’s ear and whispered, “Don’t act as if you’re a
Draco worried his lower lip between his teeth, a niggling feeling of guilt gnawing at him.
Draco gave him a wan smile, trying not to flinch when he felt Harry’s fingers gently curl around his upper arm.
“Please eat, love, just a bite for Mummy.”
The man set down the papers on his desk and made a clicking sound with his tongue. Draco held completely still, not sure how to react.
She had cared then, and she cared now.
He giggled softly and playfully slapped his chest. “
you.”
Now all that was left was to be honest with his parents.
Draco tried to swinging his legs over the side of the bed, but his body was still heavy with the effects of the sleeping potion. He just ended up kicking one leg off the side, exposing himself to Harry.
His own admission to himself hung heavy in his mind, like a brand upon his
! I can’t hurt you, you hideous monster! Just let me go, I don’t want to mate with you!”
(Another Harry POV because let’s be honest, Draco ain’t thinkin’ bout much except bangin’ in this chapter.)
“What about your milk, Draco?” Harry asked, concern lacing his voice.
Harry was smirking, the scarred side of his face taut.
Harry seemed amused at his reaction but sighed exaggeratedly. “Let’s just say your parents and I have a convoluted history. Your father was a pompous oaf who got what he deserved.”
Or what kind of person their mother was
“Oh,” Draco said flatly, his smile falling. “That’s…nice.”
Harry slowly slid the bag off of his shoulder and walked over to Draco, handing it to him. He dithered for a moment, searching his mind for any possible excuse to convince them to stay.
Even though his mother and father had constantly pressed, he’d never revealed who the father was. It was a secret Draco intended to take to his grave.
,” Harry murmured, just before closing his lips over one and sucking.
He knew that this was what had been missing from his life. Raising Scorpius on his own had been met with its own challenges, but he never complained. He had been stubborn and steadfast about doing it on his own and had thought that Scorpius would only ever need

“Come in, Draco. I’d love to have lunch with you. Thank you for bringing him to me, Auror Ryker.” Harry stood from his desk and walked over Draco, placing his hands on both of the boy’s small shoulders. “You can leave now,
you what your body is asking for?”
Even though Narcissa appeared older, she looked completely unscathed. It seemed as if her time on the run hadn’t been too strenuous. Her full lips were pulled into a impatient scowl, her perfectly groomed brows regally slanted over her blue eyes.
Scorpius giggled and patted Harry’s chest with his small hands. “Werewolf!”
He shivered.
Harry cupped the tot under his arms with both of his hands and sat the pup on his thigh. Scorpius immediately reached up and pawed at Harry’s five o’clock shadow, making him grin.
It burned his throat on the way down, making him grimace and splutter.
“I’m sure that’s not true, Harry. Have you tried talking to him?”
“And you’re a prat,” Harry said dryly, smiling smugly at his friend across the table.
this, Harry.”
When it was no longer bleeding, Harry pulled back and ripped off Draco’s pyjama bottoms with his hands. He pressed Draco’s knees back until he was almost folded in half atop the table, cool air against his wet, exposed hole.
”So wet,” Potter groaned, sinking his finger into Draco’s hole.
His heightened sense of smell wasn’t doing him any favors in the shop, the stale smell of piss and
“It’s right here, Mr. Potter. She was put on suicide watch a couple of times, so we had her moved to a cell closer to the guards’ station.”
“S-stop it, get your hand out. I don’t want it,” Draco stammered, trying to pull away.
“Look at me, Draco,” Harry ordered, surprising Draco enough to make his gaze snap up to his.
Harry clenched his jaw, feeling his claws sprout even longer from his fingertips as his inner wolf fought for control.

“Don’t worry about me. Have fun with your brother. I know you haven’t seen him in so long.”
Draco cradled his stomach with one arm, using his other arm to hold himself up from the floor. His entire body
If he tried to focus on using his magic, the collar would grow warm against his neck, absorbing his frenetic magic into the strange metal before he could even attempt to wield it.
Harry Potter sat in the kitchen of his home at 12 Grimmauld Place. A lit cigarette hung between his lips, the smoke curling into the air above his head.
The morning sickness had finally abated somewhat, and he found that he had more energy more now. When he would get out of the shower, he would examine himself in the mirror. He wasn’t showing that much, but he had always been naturally thin, so the small swell of his stomach made it apparent that he was with child.

He felt pulled in several different directions, unable to make a concrete decision.

”He has your hair color.”
Hermione smiled and reached over, clasping his hand within her own. “You don’t need to apologize, Harry. Everyone goes through rough patches. Just don’t shut us out, okay?”
When Blaise reached up and fixed Draco’s loosened scarf around his neck, Harry gritted his teeth.
Draco had been wrong.
Harry let out a deep snarl, pushing the boy aside and sweeping an arm across the top of his dresser. All the items on top of it clattered to the floor, some framed pictures’ glass cracking upon impact.
“Scared?” Harry asked, his voice soft.
He slowly looked up, his long ears flattening against the back of his skull.
Draco wanted love.
He brushed past Harry without another word.
Draco was still experiencing the effects of the potion, so Harry decided to play along.
“Show me your hands.”
“Scorpius will probably be asleep for another hour,” Harry whispered against his lips. “Do you think we would have time to—"
Harry gazed at the small boy, noting how he immediately hugged himself again, embarrassed by his leaking chest.
Kingsley stared at him from across his large desk, his dark eyes devoid of all emotion.
Draco’s mouth gaped. “So you were following me!”
It looked like a storage area, dank and dark. There were miscellaneous items strewn about, but that wasn’t what caught Harry’s attention first.
Ginny went back to stir the sauce on the oven. “I should only be gone a week at most. If I end up staying longer, I’ll be sure to write you.”
To Draco’s utter dismay, it was working.
Yes, work was something he could lose himself in. It always provided a distraction for him whenever he needed to get his mind off of more personal things he didn’t care to dwell on.
it, please.”
”Time for bed, little one. You need rest before your heat. I think we’ve had enough dramatics for one day.”
Before Draco could even open his shirt far enough, Scorpius latched on to Draco’s leaking nipple, making a contended purring sound against his skin.
He let out a choked hiccup, hugging himself.
”I don’t know, Ron. After the War, I’m not exactly onboard with keeping a herbivore in my home. Especially as a
His hand had become a poor substitute for his Omega. Thinking about Draco going into heat again without him made him
At Malfoy Manor.
It was only after he’d left London that he’d had any kind of reprieve from the intrusive public eye.
When the boy was spread before Harry, he swallowed thickly.
One side of Potter’s lips twitched in that infuriating way that Draco loathed.
Draco heard the distinct sound of Harry undressing.
Harry’s voice made him jolt, but he didn’t remove the covers from overtop his head.
Hope you enjoy 🖤
”Bashful, are we?” Harry chuckled. “Would it be better if I closed my eyes while I did it, sweetheart?”

Harry smirked. “Ha ha, your brilliant humor rivals your powers of perception, Mione,” he said wryly.
After about an hour, Draco rose from the bed and went into the adjoining bathroom in his room. He decided to take a shower to calm his nerves, his jellybean suspiciously inert since he had returned home.
, what signs had he shown?
“Good boy, such a good boy for dada,” Harry cooed, giving the rabbit a long lick against one of his ears.

Draco whined, his prick hard and his hole leaking a copious amount of slick. “I want you, Harry, please,

Harry wanted to lean down and take the boy’s mouth, show him how much he wanted him, how much he
The other elephant in the room, was their tenuous relationship. Their bond still wasn’t waning and Draco…didn’t want it to.
Harry felt as if his heart was being lanced, his instincts clamoring inside of him.
Please
The overpowering scent of Harry’s pheromones made Draco open his sore eyes.
“Let’s make a deal, then. If I can make you come on my cock, you’ll take back your hurtful words. I am your

Harry stared down at the envelope, his thoughts in turmoil. The envelope wasn’t entirely flat. There was an oblong object within making it bulge slightly from both sides.
Harry gave him another indulgent smile and walked into the cell.
Draco turned his head and pressed his lips to Harry’s ear.
Harry leaned down; his face wiped of all emotion. “Forgive me for being unable to move past my memories, Malfoy. Every time I’m forced to look in the mirror, they’re etched into my
Draco screwed his eyes shut, trying to adjust to Harry’s considerable girth as it stretched his lips. Shame made his ears burn, while twisted arousal made his prick throb and his hole leak.
Harry, he—he…” she trailed off.
The way Harry said ‘
”A-all right...” Draco said softly.
“Show me your hands,” Potter suddenly demanded.
Harry sighed deeply, running a hand through his hair. “Yes, I can give you something to wear. Do you really have to leave right now? There’s something I wanted to talk to you about. It’s important.”
”Are you all right, mate? You’re wearing down my rug.” Harry chuckled.
“But yes, there was a time when we were both young and mischievous. I think all we did was get into trouble at Hogwarts, but we always had fun together. Ron included.”
Harry’s trousers were covered in Draco’s dried cum, slick, and breast milk. His cock was throbbing from neglect, pressing painfully against his zipper. Draco had tried tearing it from his trousers several times throughout the night out of sheer desperation, but had finally given in to just rubbing his arse against it to get off.
Harry placed both his hands on Draco’s knees, lifting them and hooking them on either side of his outer thighs, spreading the boy wide atop his lap.
“You feel so good, sweetheart. So perfect for me,” Harry cooed, leaning forward to cup Draco’s cheek.
Harry smiled, but it was all teeth. “Are you questioning my loyalty to the Ministry, Kingsley? You and I both know that when I retired, I took an oath to protect any and all private information that I’d learned in my career as an Auror. I would never go back on my oath, of course.”
Walking was currently helping, so he kept pacing, his thoughts shifting to the letter he had given Hermione.

Harry’s grip tightened on the Prophet.

Draco was selfless.
”There,” Harry said in a low, soothing tone. “I can be magnanimous, pet. Do you both feel better?”
He looked frazzled.
Harry continued reading, his eyes drifting away from the staged photograph.
Relief, anger, sadness, regret, desire,
But he had to go. If he didn’t leave now…
Harry looked down at Scorpius, who was busy fiddling with one of the buttons on his dress shirt with his pudgy fingers.
The boy crawled between his legs, bumping his nose against Harry’s inner thigh, sending a bolt of pleasure straight to his cock.
“The Healer from St Mungo’s is stopping by next week. He’ll be checking on your health and will determine if you are pregnant or not. In the meantime, sit tight and be a
Draco glanced up, feeling himself blush under Harry’s intense gaze. Even though they had been intimate before, this was different. Harry was holding himself back, not showing Draco his usual kindness and praise.
Especially anger.
,” the man taunted before shouldering past Draco to return to the dining room.
Even if it meant sealing Draco’s hate for him. In the end, he had to remind himself what he had started this all for.
“And a perfect pure-blooded husband at his side to boot. You must be proud.”
Harry leaned down and…
Draco looked up in surprise, but Harry quickly averted his gaze, his lips set in a hard line.

He lost himself in the fantasy of choking the large Alpha to death for a moment, a small smile curling his lips at the mental image.
At the behest of Hermione, he’d agreed on taking out a newly divorced Ginny Weasley. She was Ron’s younger sister, and they knew each other from Hogwarts.
“What are you
Draco felt tears spring to his eyes, his hatred of Potter’s callous treatment of him warring with the unexplained arousal he felt in his presence.
When Potter struck him again, Draco couldn’t suppress the high-pitched moan that escaped him. His bottom felt raw and hot and he was unable to stop himself from spreading his thighs to try to lessen the ache building between in his groin and radiating towards his hole.

Cute.
“I can’t help it! I don’t want you; I don’t
When Draco had found Harry’s office, he had been surprised it hadn’t been locked to him. It looked as if the room had once been bedroom but had been converted. Floor to ceiling black mahogany bookshelves lined all of the walls, some of the books Draco even recognized.
on one of the knives from the magnetic strip above the stove and it flew to his open hand. He promptly dropped it and it clattered to the floor in front of Draco.
Draco made a sudden dash for the open door of the stall, letting out a small cry when Potter grabbed him by the back of his shirt.
Harry shrugged and smirked. “It’s my job to know your schedule, princess. I can come with you to your parents to pick up Juniper as well. You both shouldn’t be alone right now.”
Finally, Harry took over,
His fear of solitude and loneliness pressed in on him from all sides, his heart feeling crushed from the weight of his own hopelessness.
Harry stood, holding his hand out across the desk for Kinglsey to shake. “Perfect. I’ll take the boy home with me tonight, then.”
Kingsley took his proffered hand, giving it a firm shake. “There

This was it. He was going to rape him. He was going to impregnate him—

His eyes followed the long, white rabbit ears resting against his chest that were attached to a shock of blond hair, the same pale shade as his ears. The angelic face under that blond hair made Harry’s breath catch.
Afterall, who was he trying to look good for now? The bloody post owl?
Gringotts had repeatedly sent him letters about his captor’s vault and his instructions on how he wanted his wealth dispersed to his
Draco averted Harry’s cold gaze, his heart feeling as if it had been lanced. “It’s not like I didn’t
Nothing but a transaction.
Draco took a sip of his tea, ruminating over Hermione’s question.
“Feel good?” Harry whispered, hating himself.
“No,” Harry said tonelessly. “I’m fine, Auror Ryker. Thank you for bringing this to me. I have a lot of work to catch up on.”
“Take care with how you speak to me, Draco. Do not forget that your mother is in the Ministry’s clutches. If I wished it, I could make her stay at Azkaban much more…unpleasant.” Harry leaned down, running the tip of his nose against Draco’s jaw. “If you’re a good boy, I’ll rethink your harsh words. Perhaps your mother would like a visit from me. Azkaban is such a dreadfully desolate place after all. A word from me, and the Aurors on duty will make Narcissa their special project.”
Draco immediately felt guilty for his childish thoughts. He knew this night was important to Harry. He knew he didn’t have the right to feel jealousy when Harry and he weren’t even technically together anymore.
Harry was dressed in a dark gray button-down that hugged his muscular arms and chest. His long legs were encased in fitted black trousers, drawing Draco’s gaze between his legs.

Harry had never felt desire such as this. He wanted throw the boy back on the bed and
Harry smirked. “So you don’t want to know what has become of your son after your capture?”
Harry stared down at the boy’s swollen chest, transfixed. “You know, I could…”
This was exactly what he’d been trying to avoid for most of his adult life. Being a slave to his Alpha instincts, wanting nothing more but to please and impress his delicate Omega mate.
Even now, Draco’s scent saturated the air around him. It smelled divine to Harry, calling forth every one of his animalistic Alpha traits to the surface.
anything
He almost couldn’t believe that he had allowed Harry to take him to the Three Broomsticks.
Harry winced, disgust and shock washing over him at the apology that echoed throughout his mind. He pushed aside his inexplicable thoughts, turning his attention back to his needy Omega.
Harry carefully extracted himself, rolling to his back next to Draco, his chest heaving with deep breaths.
His need for alpha pheromones and magic was becoming hard to ignore as his pregnancy advanced.
His body yearned for his Alpha and it sickened him.
Harry tugged at his hair, eliciting a pained gasp from Draco. “Oh, but you
He had been licking the boy unwittingly, content to continue doing so until the boy was covered in Harry’s scent.
Pansy laughed, pulling him into a tight hug. “I’ll be happy to take on all of your assignments if it’ll get you to
their Alpha...
“Draco,” Harry said tiredly. “She’s Ron’s little sister and she is a dear friend. If I hadn’t invited her, it would have been impolite. We’re not together anymore, but it’s important to me that everyone in my life know that Scorpius is my son and now a permanent part of my life. Isn’t that right, love?”
She returned his smile, but it slowly waned. “Now only the hard part remains.”
Harry sat motionless on the bed, staring at Draco’s naked body with narrowed eyes. “I’m Harry Potter. Your mother, Narcissa, has been taken prisoner by the British Ministry of Magic. She’s being transported to Azkaban as we speak.”
”So brave, my sweet one,” Harry praised, beginning to clean the rabbit’s soft tummy with his tongue.
He closed his eyes and burrowed his face into the sheets, letting himself be lulled to sleep as Harry caressed his stomach, feeling his Alpha transfer some of his magic through his touch. It warmed him, seeming to reach to his very
Things had irrevocably shifted after Voldemort’s demise and herbivores were treated undeniably different now.
Draco sighed, smoothing back some of Scorpius’ wayward hair. “Can I please put him down for a nap and then we can talk?”
Draco looked down at Harry. His green eyes were filled with anger, his fingers digging painfully into the skin of Draco’s arms.
Draco could be moaning in need and no one was coming to ease his

Harry schooled his expression into one of deep thought. “Well, I’m growing older. You’re one of the ones always hounding me to settle down and start a family.”
”Bed time, sweetheart,” Harry had said gruffly.
The dark velvet drapes on the tall windows in the room were partially open. It had grown darker outside, dusk fast approaching and the grey overcast skies outside now slate colored as the sun had begun to set.

He felt sorry for the Alphas who were to be assigned an Omega so young. It would be like taking care of a child, but you had to get said child

Draco was suddenly envious of them.

When Draco didn’t deign to answer, Potter sighed exaggeratedly.
When Hermione had become pregnant with their daughter, Rose, Ron had sequestered Hermione away in their house. He hadn’t allowed her to do anything for herself, waiting on her hand and foot her entire pregnancy.
Draco had been shifting non-stop for the past thirty minutes, presumedly coming out of the sleep potion induced coma.
. All omegas always have an ulterior motive. They’re good for nothing but laying on their backs and spreading their legs. It’s in their nature to deceive.”
Harry shook his head. “You’re not, Draco. I’ll come with you and I’ll make dinner for you both tonight. It’s no trouble at all.”
He wasn’t a burden.
“Come along now. I’ll show to your room and send Pansy up to go over the details of your assigned duties while you remain here.”
Octavius disappeared back to the front of the shop.
He wondered if his new clothes were a reward for being Harry’s

The sound of someone’s breath hitching made Harry look up.
Harry went rigid above him. “Fine,” he said coolly, “I have another idea, pet.”
Oh, yes. Harry knew Draco desired him. Just not as much as Harry desired
Draco’s breathing became shallow, his resolve weakening at Harry’s words. “Because…I just can’t, okay?
Another tear escaped, sliding down her cheek. “I still love him, you know,” she said hoarsely. “He was my best friend. My family.”
The numbness seemed to spread throughout him, enveloping him. Whenever he thought about
Harry’s eyes slid shut in bliss, lapping at the boy’s skin and spreading his saliva over the gland to mark him.
Even though inside he was emotional wreck, everything on the surface remained pretty much the same.

His thighs were still submissively spread, his prick hard and soaked with pre-cum. His pink nipples were stiff, standing out against his fair skin. The rim of opening looked stretched, irritated and drenched with slick.
He knew that Harry was denying him the attention and worship he needed as Omega to thrive after a mating bite, and it infuriated him while simultaneously making him feel a gaping

His mother was dressed in a modest floral-printed summer dress that matched the teacups, most likely deliberate on her part. His mother liked to coordinate.
The sight of him took his breath away.
“Have you had any schooling?”
The dildo rubbed against that rapturous spot inside of him, making him let out a high-pitched moan, his eyes rolling back in his head.
He quickly tamped down his irrational direction of thought.
Draco mewled softly, shutting his eyes as Harry rubbed his pebbled nipple. “I-I don’t want you touching me at all, especially not
Harry was masturbating, his long, tanned fingers sliding up and down that thick shaft with unhurried ease. His green eyes were riveted between Draco’s legs where the dildo was halfway impaling him now.
His arms tightened around his pup, his heart aching with worry and guilt.
Had Harry always been so much bigger than him?
? What if Scorpius had been home?”

Harry had ordered Kreacher to care for the boy until his heat was fully upon him. He didn’t trust himself around Draco right now.

His mind was a constant loop of
Draco giggled. “I think Mummy’s baby is jealous.”

“Now, now. Don’t be shy, little one. I didn’t say that I didn’t enjoy your pathetic attempts to seduce me. It’s quite amusing. Go on, touch me. I’ll show you just how unaffected I am.”
Harry’s stubbled cheek was rough beneath his palm, his whiskers abrading the soft flesh of his hand. He let his fingers slide upwards, towards Harry’s hairline. He buried the tips of his fingers into the man’s thick, black hair before he quickly slid his hand back down.
Harry sighed, pulling his hand out from under Draco’s. “I suppose one won’t hurt, but no more than that.”
If he had been an Alpha, maybe he could have protected his mother better. Maybe they both wouldn’t be in the situation they were now.

The doors closed with a soft thud, the lift slowly propelling Draco upwards towards the man he vowed he would never set eyes again.
Auror Thorne gave a quick nod. “Sure thing, Mr. Potter. Just tap on the door three times with your wand and I’ll come to let you out.”
Harry quickly undressed, wanting them to touch skin-to-skin.

He cut off that train of thought before it could finish.

scent gland.
When Harry added a third finger, he curled them, pressing against his prostate. The suction of Harry’s mouth and pressure from his fingers tipped him over the edge, making him come with high-pitched moan. His vision briefly went white, heat licking up his spine and making his body feel as it were ablaze as his orgasm inexorably ripped through him. Harry swallowed his cum, pulling back to lick up the rest of his release that dribbled down his cock.
As he watched Harry cuddle their sleeping son, he knew that Lucius could never compare to how Harry was as a father.
She had stated that it was imperative he keep his name and identity a secret, lest the consequences be damning to their family.
Draco knew Harry was hurt because of his dishonesty. By attending his dinner tonight, he was making an effort to move forward. If Harry wanted Scorpius to be a part of his life, Draco would support that.
Harry cleared his throat, banishing the erotic images from his mind.
The memory of their pup’s first ultrasound.
Harry reached down and loosened his restraints, pulling him up by one of his aching wrists. He tugged him close, and Draco was suddenly pressed against the man’s broad chest. He was much shorter than Harry, the top of his head only reaching the man’s collarbones.
The flash of hurt in Ginny’s brown eyes was quickly shuttered, her lips turning up in a defeated smile.
He could see the ghastly headline splashed across the front page of the Daily Prophet already.
begging, could it?
Ron walked over to her, blocking her from view of the Minister and the other officials.
Slick was pouring from his hole, coating them both in the hot, wet fluid. A flush of heat spread from his chest and down, making the flames within him ignite with even more vehemence than before.
Arlen smiled, hefting his bag higher on his shoulder. “Let’s go in together.”

His daughter, Juniper, was still in her high chair at the table, playing in her mashed potatoes with her fingers.
After finally collapsing together in bed, he allowed himself to process.
Draco knew it was all Harry.

Hours later, Harry and Draco laid tangled together on the bed, exhausted. It was dawn, the first rays of the morning sunlight filtering in through the parted drapes on the tall windows.
Harry held him closer, his heart cinching.
The kiss was desperate, drawn out and
Scorpius only gazed up at him, letting out a string of incoherent babbles in response.
A muscle jumped in Harry’s jaw, his eyes hardening.
For the umpteenth time, he smothered the urge to cry out for Harry.
The apology was on the tip of his tongue, but he couldn’t get it out. If he apologized to Harry, it would be conceding to something…
Towards Draco.
He quickly dropped his gaze down, feeling decidedly
. As if I could ever love a pathetic thing like you.”
”Now,” Harry said, “I’ll leave you here to get...accustomed to all of this delightful news. Maybe when you can behave, I’ll release you.”
Harry dressed the boy in one of his old T-shirts. It fit him like a dress, the hem hitting him just above his knees. After dressing his rabbit, he took him to his kitchen to see if he could make him something to eat.
“I don’t need
Harry hooked one of his finger’s into the boy’s cleft, his claw meeting what could only be the boy’s leaked slick.
Harry’s eyes immediately found Draco’s and he couldn’t help wincing.
Pansy had finally convinced him into it.
“I wondered if you could get a letter to my mother in Azkaban. I just want her to know that I’m not angry with her and that I love her.”
He scoffed and turned down another corridor, halting when he heard a familiar voice.
Even though Draco would never admit it, the cruel man was
He averted his mother’s seeking gaze and looked down to where Harry still held his hand, drawing strength from their burgeoning bond that seemed to only grow deeper the longer they were together.
She suddenly shot up from the sofa, her heart and mind on overdrive.
Draco rested both of his hands palm-down on Harry’s strong thighs, trying to take him as deep as he was able to. Harry’s impressive length hit the back of his throat, making him splutter for a split second before moaning when he realized Harry was subtly rocking his hips as Draco sucked.
Draco arched a brow. “Been through?”

Draco tucked Scorpius’ head under his chin, holding him close. He knew that he probably looked awful.
Would he want more pups? He probably looked devastatingly
“Draco?” Hermione asked, her voice laced with concern.
His fingers bumped clumsily against the side of the glass, knocking it over. The water spilled out and onto his lap and belly.
Hermione’s smile faltered. “No, Draco, for your birthday. It’s your birthday today, don’t you know?”
Harry arched a brow. “I don’t what you’re talking about, Hermione.”
Draco sat on the sofa, his top pulled up to expose his pale, rounded stomach. He looked so
on Draco’s face was too visceral, too much for Harry to bear.
Harry leaned in closer, inhaling Draco’s sweet scent that never failed to drive him mad with want.
His heart contracted painfully, flinching inwardly. “What do you mean?” he asked, a little too sharply.
“Y-you can,” he said softly, his eyes glassy.
Draco felt the snap of Harry’s magic and pheromones being suddenly withdrawn, leaving him achingly bereft.
Draco’s cheeks suffused with heat, feeling guilty. Blaise was only trying to cheer him up. He had to stop thinking about Harry Potter and enjoy time with his friend, who had been endlessly patient with him the past few months.

“We can play later, love. It’s nap time now.”
Draco had lifted one pale leg, unknowingly baring himself to Harry.
people?” he asked, his voice sounding strained.
It was nothing like Malfoy Manor. He suddenly missed his mother’s flourishing garden and the verdant grass of his own manor’s kempt lawn.
Kingsley hadn’t done himself any favors by introducing the new breeding law and his reformation decisions were beginning to tally up against him.
He stepped closer to the mantel, clutching the envelope to his chest. This close, he could see the filament cracks in the painting, a map work of aged veins that interspersed throughout Sirius’ dark eyes.
Harry leaned down, pressing his lips to Draco’s ear. “You’re so lovely, so

Draco and Harry immediately sprang apart, both of them pressing against either side of the shops.
As if a spell were broken, Potter’s heavy-lidded gaze hardened, glancing over Draco’s head.

Harry’s mouth went dry, delighted at the submissive stance.
Harry groaned, his thighs rigid beneath Draco’s trembling fingers.
Draco undulated atop the table, his little broken sobs and whimpers the only sounds in the kitchen accompanying the obscene sounds of Harry’s tongue against his slick-covered genitals.
“But it’s true,” Draco whispered, letting his thumb caress Harry’s cheekbone, “you are my Alpha, and you are Scorpius’ Alpha. I’m not denying it or trying to hide it anymore.
“You’re obviously wet behind the ears, kid. I can smell that you’re an Omega. Let me guess, your master is using you as a fuck toy?”
on him to protect them both…
on the matter.
He lowered his head and began licking up droplets of water from the boy’s velvet ears, letting his tongue occasionally dip inside to taste the warm, delicate membrane on the inside. His fur was sparse on the inside, the peach fuzz rubbing against his rough tongue with each lick.
Draco shook his head, tears brimming his eyes. “I-I just want to get away from you! I can’t do this anymore, Harry!”
Ender jolted and missed catching his wand. It landed in front of him, sparks still shooting from the tip until finally, it fizzled out.
The photo depicted a teenage Harry, maybe even at the age that Draco was now. He was leaning over the side of the covered wooden bridge, his black hair mussed from the wind. He was laughing, a white owl perched on his outstretched arm. A striped scarf was haphazardly wrapped around his neck, the emblem of his House on his school jumper visible just beneath it. He looked impossibly
When Harry didn’t reply, Draco glanced up at him.
Harry’s house was like the man himself, imposing and dark.
Potter unhooked the riding crop from his waist and raised it to point it at him.
Uh, warning. Some squick? Listen, there’s gonna be some ✨stuff ✨ going on between these two in their animal/half-animal forms.
He crawled over the trembling boy, his tail brushing between Draco’s inner thighs. His heavy cock hung between them, pressing against the boy’s own slowly hardening prick.
Harry sat in one of the darkened guest bedrooms of his house. He had his elbows resting on the arms of the wingback chair, his fingers steepled beneath his chin.
enough…”
He lifted his hand and sifted through Draco’s sweat-dampened hair with his fingers, smiling as the boy purred contentedly under his touch.
“Why isn’t it enough?” Harry asked, his voice hollow.
He was glad Ron had taken his daughter to Diagon Alley so that Hermione and he could have some time alone together to catch up. He didn’t like being away from her, but he didn’t want to bring up certain things about his past in front of his daughter.
It all sounded so impossible, but he had to at least
Harry ignored Ron’s questioning gaze, turning to leave Kingsley’s office.
“And the way Scorpius has warmed up to Harry…” She smiled and gave a pointed look to Scorpius, still sleeping on Harry’s chest, his legs and arms lazily spread out. “I think it speaks for itself.”
—I can smell you all the time—” Harry dropped his head and kissed Draco’s marked gland, licking it.
Harry slowed his pistoning cock, just barely moving inside of him now. “Tell me you love me, and I’ll make you come.”
His cock instinctively reacted, blood swiftly filling his shaft until he was rigid beneath his trousers. His fangs lengthened, erupting from his gums, slicing his lower lip with how fast they slid down.
And he would have to live with that.
The thinly veiled threat hung in the air between them. Ron’s eyes darted nervously between Kinglsey and Harry.
Draco stepped closer to Harry, panic welling within him. “Please, Harry, you promised—”
Was it worth it?
“Mhm,” Harry hummed noncommittally.
Draco’s gray eyes appeared more alert now, the effects of the potion tapering off.
Draco tried to look up, but the hand around his mouth tightened. He could scent that the man was an Alpha.
Draco shuddered, baring his throat even more for his Alpha’s attention.
There, that hadn’t been a lie. He
When their pup had nudged one of their feet against Harry’s palm on his stomach, something akin to excitement bubbled forth within Draco, something he hadn’t felt in a long time. When he had turned his head to look up at his Alpha, beaming up at him, that feeling was quickly doused.
The situation must be more dire than the Ministry was willing to let on if they were enacting such draconian methods to increase the chances of magical conception.
He looked up, his gaze catching on a booth across the street. It looked to be a game of Fairy Lights. He could remember playing it back when he had been going to Hogwarts as a student.
He had a feeling she was tired of him moping around the manor. The past few months, all he’d done was take care of Scorpius and try

“Come back in here after you give them it. I could use some help plating,” Pansy said, flicking her knife and making droplets of blood fly across the countertop.
He was choked with fury and embarrassment. Grabbing two fistfuls of hay beneath him, he refused to react.
He realized that they had been at each other’s throats since meeting again and he didn’t know why. They were adults now.
Harry drew his brows together, giving a low chuckle. “Before?”
and Harry forcefully blocking it made him feel
His mother smiled, but it didn’t reach her eyes. “We’ll see each other again, darling. You just have to be good and wait for me to retrieve you. When the time is right, I will.”
”Be careful, Omega,” Potter whispered darkly, tipping Draco’s chin up with his fingers. “I went easy on you this time. Perhaps I should pick up my riding crop and
“Want to get you pregnant again,” he whispered roughly. “Fill you up with my seed again, until you’re swollen with another one of my pups. I want it so bad, Draco.”
Draco closed his eyes, trying to get his thoughts under control. He refused to interfere with Harry’s life any more than he already had. He didn’t need some teenage
She paused, her knife now poised above a slab of bleeding meat, glinting under the recessed lighting from above. “So, if you’re not a fuck toy, what are you, kid?”
He had hoped that as their pup grew, Harry’s treatment of him might change.
”I’m your new owner, little one. Your master, your captor, and eventually...the father of your children.”
Draco let out a choked sob, knowing that Harry was right. He had been treating Harry the exact same way and now Harry had given him a taste of his own medicine.
She looked up at him, half of her face hidden in his shirt. “I love you, too, Mummy,” she mumbled.
Harry growled around his nipple, sucking even harder. He reached up with one hand and cupped Draco’s other small breast, gently kneading it. The pressure from Harry’s hand made him leak even more milk, the warm fluid sluicing down Harry’s fingers and the top of his palm.“H-Harry,
The next evening, however, he found himself back Harry’s office.
! You never tell me anything! What has my family done to you that was so horrible?” his voice dropped to a whisper, “what have
Harry picked an invisible piece of lint from his shoulder, looking unaffected from Draco’s earlier cruel jab. “I’ll leave, but I’ll be there to pick you up in the evening from your shift at the hospital. You get off at seven, right?
Draco sifted his fingers through Scorpius’ hair, smiling. “I see it got in his hair, too,” he said wryly.
It was becoming difficult to focus when he was at work, only excited for when his pup and Omega would appear at his Floo every night.
After removing his jacket and hanging it in the closet, a sharp knock was the only warning he had before a small girl came barreling in.
“I-I don’t think that’s a good idea.” His breath hitched when Harry’s flat stomach brushed against his rounded one, inciting a traitorous spark of arousal.
When he became aware of his own twisted feelings, he knew he had to choose.
Better than nothing, he felt
Gardening, knitting, cooking, and writing to name a few.
Draco attempted to wriggle away, not wanting Potter to notice his shameful arousal.

Harry’s hatred for Lucius and Narcissa was something she wouldn’t be able to understand.

He sat on the edge, just next to the boy.
When he willed it to slowly dissipate, he pathetically tucked his head against his arm, lulling himself to sleep using Harry’s scent again.
Bunny Draco with long bunny ears, yum, yum. 🖤
Not verbally, but his demeanor was telling to Harry.
The boy nodded dazedly, turning his head to press a soft kiss to Harry’s throat.
, Draco thought drily.
Harry groaned, gingerly pressing his finger to the boy’s wet hole, feeling it clench against his fingertip.
But he would never let Harry know how much his words hurt him.
Arlen remained silent, walking into the lift after Draco. When the doors closed, Arlen cleared his throat.
Draco clenched his teeth, staring at the wall across from him.
His inexplicable emotions because of that scene had confounded him since leaning the manor.
Harry’s own eyes skated back down to Draco’s stomach. “How soon do you need an alpha? For the...pup.”
on your part? Should I fall to my knees and thank you for
He had taken on a lot of hobbies over the years that he had been too afraid to try when he was younger.
“And…what will become of Draco?” she asked softly.
Harry stepped closer to him, sending reassurance through their bond in strong waves. “I don’t need anyone
Draco froze, his breath hitching.
He was clad in just a pair of white pyjama bottoms. He was trembling, a fine sheen of sweat noticeable on his pale skin.
if you want me or not? Do not mistake this for anything other than it is, Draco. You are nothing but a carrier for any children I want. Do not insult me,” he scoffed, “
But instead, he averted the man’s eyes and inwardly chastised himself for thinking such inane thoughts.
He strode to the door and put his hand on the knob, his vision blurring due to his tears.
Draco set his jaw and nodded.
“I don’t want to listen to your pleas anymore tonight, pet.
Draco moaned softly, the painful stretch and artificial feel of the dildo unpleasant against his sensitive hole. Each ribbed edge caught against his sensitive walls as it sunk deeper, splitting him open.
“I understand, Harry. If you ever need to talk, you can always come to me.”
Harry was glowering down at him with hardened eyes, his lips set in a grim line. “Like I said, don’t think you can weaponize your body against me, Draco. The only thing you’ll give me is children, and the only thing you’ll get from me is my cum. There will be nothing else connecting us.”
“No!” Scorpius whined.
. It seemed to burn his tongue while making his own salivary glands gush.
“Mother, please. Nothing was stolen. There’s no need to involve the Ministry!”
Draco held Scorpius close, rocking him. “I just don’t think I should, Harry. I think the best decision is for me to go back home.”
Floo powder plumed out from the hearth, particles floating around the space in front of Draco’s white uniform shoes.
The people at the inn had barely spared Draco a second glance when they’d rented a room for the night, all of their eyes drawn to Harry.
to Scorpius. Scorpius loved Harry and was always ecstatic to spend time with his “werewolf.” Harry never pushed Scorpius to call him daddy, but he knew Harry hoped that in time, Scorpius would call him by that.
,” Draco moaned, pressing his small nose against Harry’s neck, mouthing at his scent gland.
Potter dragged him further into the stables and unceremoniously threw him into an empty stall. His back collided with the back of the wooden stall, a sharp exhale escaping him upon impact.
Auror Jack Ryker stood in the open doorway of his office, a wrinkle between his dark brows.
He turned his head, pressing his lips to Harry’s jaw. “Can I have a goodnight kiss?”
Harry slid his hand back up, his long, rough fingers gliding smoothy due to his wet skin. He cupped one of his aching breasts, letting his thumb press against his nipple.
“Why does my rabbit smell like
Draco stared down at his feet. “Is it because of father that I have to go away?”
”P-please go slower, sir...it

A normal predator’s reaction to such submission from their prey, would be breaking the rabbit’s neck and devouring it.
He had owned a stuffed rabbit as a pup that he had christened ‘Nibbles’. Perhaps that’s what she meant? But he had certainly never done anything sexual with it…
Several large framed paintings adorned the corridor walls. Witches and wizards with dark hair and eyes stared down at him with disdain, the pallor of their skin the only brightness in the paintings. The house seemed to exude sadness, the bleak atmosphere only making Draco feel more hopeless and alone.
Draco sighed tiredly and smoothed back some of his daughter’s curls as he held her. ”You can let yourself out now, Potter. I have things I need to do.”
“Scorpius is mine.”
“Come on, sweetheart. I know somewhere we can be alone. Will you go with me?”
It didn’t happen instantaneously.
Draco eagerly arched his back, pressing back against Harry.
“Don’t act so scandalized,” he hissed, “you’ll be overjoyed to hear that I honored your pathetic little request. I never fucked you from the front, so dry your tears.”
“I changed my shirt just last...” He clenched his jaw, the past few days a blur. “Was it Thursday?” he mumbled.
”S-Scorpius,” he murmured, holding deathly still.
Just another person he had lied to, another person who was angry with him.
. He couldn’t take it anymore. He unzipped the front of his trousers and pulled out his heavy erection.
Harry didn’t speak and Draco knew he was leaving it up to him to tell his mother. Even though he knew Harry would do anything for him, he also knew that there were some things in life that he would need to be brave enough to do on his own.
Hermione sighed. “This...” She gesticulated to all of Harry with floundering hands. “Depression, sulking,
Rejection hurt but knowing that Harry was trying to move on and let their bond dissipate hurt even worse.
Harry only stared at him with those cold eyes, his face wiped of all emotion.
Harry’s grip on his breasts became painful, his fingertips biting into his sensitive skin. “Do you think I’m an idiot, Draco? Do you think I’m not listening and watching you at
Fear skittered up Draco’s spine, his body stiffening under Harry’s rough hands. “I-I don’t know what you’re talking about.”
Harry wasn’t that type of person. He would use the baby as leverage. He would use their unborn child to get Draco to do what he wanted.
Hermione’s keen gaze sharpened. “It’s all right, Draco. You don’t need to apologize so much. You have nothing to be sorry for. Forgetfulness isn’t a crime.”
Draco had sleepily turned his face towards Harry’s wet tongue, a small furrow appearing between the boy’s pale brows. When a contented sigh had escaped the boy’s parted lips, Harry had felt a swell of pride and arousal.
His hat was suddenly snatched off of the top of his head, making him startle. He whipped around, arching a brow at Blaise.
Harry turned and grabbed the boy’s wrist, yanking him against his chest.
“E-excuse me, Potter?”
Harry pulled back; his pupils dilated so much his eyes appeared fully black. “This is the way it must be.”
The boy’s long ears shifted, perking up slightly from the back of his head.
Draco closed his eyes, trying to recede into himself.
Harry growled, stabbing a hand through his hair. “All I ever wanted from you was
Something had happened to Harry.

“Yes,” Harry said coolly, “
Potter smirked. “See, that’s where I think you’re mistaken,
Draco quickly nodded. “I should go, Harry. Can I borrow some clothes?”
Roland gave a derisive snort. “I think Draco can speak for himself, Potter.”

“That you
”Mister Weasley is here to see Master Potter, he is,” Kreacher snuffled.
It appeared to comfort him, Harry smirking as the boy nuzzled against his chest hair.
It was the first thing Draco could think of in the moment, latching on to any familial relation that Harry might have had with the man.
A muscle jumped in Harry’s jaw. “You forget yourself, Draco. I

When they had made love, Draco had been so open, so needful, and so honest. Where had it gone wrong?

Draco’s dada was standing in the entryway of the kitchen. He sniffed the air, his eyes darkening with suspicion. He emitted a low growl, making the short hairs at the nape of Draco’s neck stand on end.
“Please don’t hurt him, Harry. He is a

He quickly sat up, smacking the tangled sheets from his hips.
A flicker of what Draco could only assume was pain tightened Harry’s features, but it was quickly erased before he could discern it.
When he was done, he opened the stall door to find Harry Potter blocking his way, glowering down at him.
In the middle of the exam table, laid the most beautiful creature Harry had ever laid eyes on.
The only warning Draco had was the overpowering presence of Harry’s pheromones attacking him from all angles, loosening his limbs and making his prick leak even more pre-cum before he heard the hated man’s voice.
Even though he had drawn all the attention, Harry had kept a proprietary arm around Draco’s waist.
the young Omega and his pup.
He stood up, yanking Draco up with him by his wrist.
Draco nodded, his lids feeling unbelievably heavy. “I will. I’ll tell them, Harry. Can we go to bed? I’m tired.”
pretty
Draco gave a coquettish lick to his dada’s throat, inhaling his unique scent for courage.
Draco shifted his sleeping pup in his arms, pulling his shirt back over his bare breast as Harry watched in weighted silence.
The pairing of an alpha and a beta was rare, but not unheard of.
“That’s my good boy,” Harry praised, his words a low murmur.
”Oh, sweetheart, I’m sorry I’ve hurt you. Come on, let’s take a bath together and I’ll make it better, baby.”
Lucius and Narcissa Malfoy had caused some of the most painful losses in his life and had contributed to the death of his parents and the injury and death of some of his closest friends.

Just last night, Draco had reduced to audibly begging for Harry’s presence.
His hand shot out, clamping around the boy’s ankle. With a low growl, he dragged the rabbit back towards him. He wanted to shift, to change to his wolf form. His instincts were screaming at him to

Harry smiled, returning her hug. “I didn’t know you were back from your work trip already.”

like this.
Or maybe it was when he realized that Draco loved their pup unconditionally. Even if it was fathered by a man who was ceaselessly cruel to him.
“Stay alert, Auror Pierce,” he said flatly, brushing past the younger man and entering the mansion.
Harry felt the head of Draco’s hard prick brush against his stomach, smearing pre-cum against it as he undulated under him.
Draco let out a huff of disbelief, his eyes widening. “There’s nothing going on between Arlen and I!”
,” Draco said, squeezing Scorpius to his chest.
In the following weeks after his captor’s arrest, both of their faces had been plastered all over Wizarding news outlets.
Harry pulled away with a gasp, standing up and taking a step back. He tucked his waning erection back into his trousers and shoved a hand through his hair.
“Harry...Ron told me about...Draco.”
In a fucked-up way, it helped. Harry was his mate, and the sudden projection of his familiar pheromones calmed his anxiety, the tension slowly disappearing from his shoulders.
Harry threw the boy onto the bed and gathered both of his wrists one hand, stretching them over his head. He conjured rope and twined it through the metal bars of the headboard, tightening the knots until the rope dug into the skin of the boy’s delicate wrists.
He could only hope that she was doing all right  without him there.
Harry tentatively raised his hand and began scratching at the base of one of the boy’s long ears, knowing how he loved it.
His daughter closed the distance between them, banding her small arms around his waist.
”The wards on my home don’t allow anything in without my approval, but they also don’t allow anything
No magical pregnancies meant no witches or wizards. If there were no more witches or wizards, that meant no more magic. It meant the extinction of their kind.
Draco quietly padded over to him and lifted a hand, placing it on his back.
Harry felt odd, almost as if he couldn’t bear to be away from Draco. Ever since he’d left him to talk with Kingsley, a voice in his head rebelled at being so far away from him, an animalistic roaring in his skull that reverberated with frightening intensity. His entire body felt strung too tightly, remnants of Draco’s sweet scent seeming to stick to his skin and seep into his pores until it felt as if the boy was living
Harry lowered his hand, pressing two fingers against Draco’s seeping hole. He let out a low whine, clenching and unclenching against Harry’s calloused fingertips. The tips of his fingers breached him, his slickened hole seeming to suck the digits in.
Looking at him physically
Scorpius’ remembered nickname for him sent a sharp pang to his heart.
“They look so prettily swollen. Do you wish me to suck on them to ease your pain?”
Harry bounced Draco on his cock, groaning each time he would bottom out. He gripped Draco’s hips, supporting him.
The Pensieve was shoved in the far corner of the room, a large cabinet of confiscated memories bottled within.
Harry grasped Draco’s upper arms with both hands, tugging him closer. “You know why, sweetheart,” he said softly.
“That’s good, Draco. Now,” Harry shifted, pulling his leaking cock from the front his trousers, “suck me off.”
Draco’s lips parted, his breathing picking up.

Something about the heated way Harry looked at him made him flush.
They both wore bright, friendly smiles, but Harry knew that the relationship was all business.
“I love you,” Draco blurted.

His rabbit lay panting and flushed on the bed, his spend glistening on his pale chest under the soft light of his bedroom.
Truthfully, he didn’t have the proverbial green thumb that his mother had. Every plant he touched seemed to wilt and die within a few days, but he still persisted in trying to garden.
Draco let his thumb brush against the edge of Harry’s lips, surprised to feel how soft they felt. He let his hand slide lower, his fingers encircling the man’s muscular throat. When Draco’s fingertips brushed against one of Harry’s scent glands, he snatched Draco’s hand away.
, Mum.”
Hermione had attributed his stoic behavior to growing older, she had never questioned if something was truly bothering him. The war had affected all of them and Hermione had thought that maybe Harry just wanted to lay the past to rest. She never would have thought that he still harbored such ill will towards the Malfoy family.
“Harry, what you saw wasn’t—”
It made him look…
Pansy pulled away and smirked. “Yeah, I know. I’ll see you at the hospital tomorrow. I’ll bring you tea and scones for breakfast.”
Sure enough, there was a plain brown envelope on their kitchen table. It looked rough, stained with some unknown substance and claw marks from the owl adorning the front.
Alpha dominance. With raven hair, olive skin, and a muscular form, he was what every Omega would yearn for in a mate.

with Draco Malfoy.
He gritted his teeth, clamping his sticky thighs shut.
Draco gave him a small smile, a small plastic container beneath his arm. “Hi, Harry. I hope you’re not too busy. I brought you lunch.”
He followed Arlen down the corridor off to the side of the reception area and to the lift. Arlen paused, turning to face him.
And they were soon to dissipate completely.
Draco glanced up, eyeing the portrait of the young man with haunted eyes.

The darkened room was lit by the dim glow of the strung Christmas lights hanging on the front of the inn. Some of the reddish light spilled into the room through the frosted window and semi-parted drapes, casting a reddish swathe of light across Harry’s handsome features.

“Are you feeling all right, Draco?”
”Perhaps Narcissa chose to shield him from that part of her life. As a mother, I could understand. A good parent would want the best for their children. Maybe she thought it would be better if Draco never found out about them being Death Eaters at one time.”
. You pick, but nothing else.”
“I took this one. It was on the bridge outside of Hogwarts. I thought myself a professional photographer back then. Harry was my favorite person to photograph. He was a natural.”
Harry crossed the room to him, Scorpius content to just cling to his shirt. He stopped right in front of him, looking down at him with concern. “You’re not ruining anything, Draco. I told you, the blame lies with me. Don’t blame yourself. I reacted carelessly last night and took advantage.”
He carried Draco over to a bale of hay and sat down on it. He roughly turned Draco over in his arms so that his stomach was pressed against Potter’s solid thighs.
Scorpius huffed indignantly and pursed his lips, recoiling from the bite of applesauce Draco was currently trying to coax him to eat.

Draco winced. “Not yet,” he said weakly.
this, Harry.”
life where you can pretend as if we don’t know each other.”
After he had left, Draco had begun crying.
Harry straightened and picked up his fork. “You should eat. I can drop you both off at home before I go into work.”
“Is that so?” Harry asked, a predatory edge to his voice.
Potter stepped into the enclosed stall and reached into the inner pocket of his jacket, pulling out a rolled cigarette. He produced a box of matchsticks next, taking one out and striking it against the heel of his posh boot to light it.
The object of the game was to catch the ‘fairies’ in the water container using your wand. The fairies in question were just charmed flashes of light. They would bounce and zigzag throughout the water, quick as a Snitch. If you were able to freeze one using your wand, you won a prize.
”Sweetheart?”
Harry was sitting at the kitchen table, sipping a cup of coffee. His raven hair was attractively styled, his face freshly shaven. Draco’s eyes traveled down his throat and his cheeks suffused with heat. Love bites dotted his muscular neck, distinctive teeth marks against his tan skin. One particularly deep one right on his scent gland.
Draco himself had basically ended things between them. It was of no use to keep worrying about him.
Harry stopped his ministration on his nipple. “Do you think that because you’re pregnant now, I won’t
Draco didn’t seem to give a fuck and neither did Harry. Everything was suddenly narrowed down to Harry’s cock pistoning in and out of Draco at a fevered pace that had him harshly panting and Draco emitting sharp, stuttered moans that seemed to echo throughout his office.
Roland’s eyes hardened, his gentlemen guise dropping completely.
Over a month ago, Harry had approached him while he had been reading a book in his bedroom.
He let out a strangled sob, unable to accept the inevitable.
Hermione slipped an arm behind his back, rubbing her hand in comforting circles against it.
He had never seen Harry smile like that. At least, not for
“Honestly, kid, do you even know how to follow
The boy remained mute.
“Like what you see, little one?” Harry teased, drawing Draco’s eyes back up.
Draco went pliant, making a small, strained sound as Harry pulled his finger from the boy’s tight, wet clasp. He brought the finger up to his mouth, licking away his sweet slick.
”You can’t keep avoiding me, Draco. The Ministry assigned me to watch over you while they look into Notts’ disappearance. Using your magic to knock over a display of fruit in the middle of a Muggle market in order to slip away from me isn’t what I would deem
Harry was silent next him and it seemed deafening to Draco.
—so sweet,” Harry groaned, returning his hot tongue to Draco’s hole.
Draco laid Scorpius in his small bed, pulling his favorite fleece blanket up to his shoulders. Scorpius huffed sleepily and put his thumb in his mouth, his tiny blond brows furrowing in his sleep.
It had been an
Harry shuddered.
“Are you going to even introduce yourself?” the man asked.
After everything they had been through and everything Draco had put Harry through, he was unsure if his Alpha still
His lips curled, excitement and anticipation warring with the sudden violent wave of possessiveness he felt.
Draco lay panting on the bed, covered in sweat, slick, and cum. He dazedly watched as Harry stuck his cum-covered finger in his mouth and sucked. Harry’s eyes closed for a moment, making Draco flush.
“Then by your own admission, you disobeyed my orders.”
Draco tried to pull away from Harry but was harshly jerked back into his embrace.
His sweetheart had been acting...
Draco hugged her back, his lids sliding shut.

Scorpius looked tired and had been acting cranky the whole last week.

Draco’s mouth gaped. “Have you been

“S-stop it, Harry,” Draco cried, lifting his hips to meet Harry’s tortuously slow thrusts.
Draco’s gaze snapped back to him. ”I don’t want to speak to you at all!”
Warmth suffused the skin that Harry was touching, making Draco want to purr with satisfaction.
Harry blew a plume of smoke against the front of the Prophet, his insides twisting with pleasure as he watched the wisps of smoke curl around Narcissa’s regal features.
His sweetheart was...
Watching them both from the kitchen doorway, he felt unbelievably guilty. Scorpius needed his father and Harry...needed his
Draco held his breath, his fingers tightening around the neck of the bottle.

“Narcissa?” Harry asked at the same time.
Harry began pumping into him with shallow thrusts, sliding the hand on his hip up his thigh and hooking his fingers under his knee.
His rabbit’s lower lip wobbled, his eyes turning misty. “Dada.”
Draco wasn’t one to mete out revenge and he had no desire to dredge up the past. He wanted to move on with his life and he had been, but there was something that he was ignoring.

“I didn’t know you’d be back so soon! I wanted to surprise you with dinner being ready.”
To be one.
“N-no! Just…Scorpius fell asleep before he could nurse and I’m…” his face turned crimson.
His mother nodded, a small smile turning up her full lips. “I have the utmost confidence in you, Harry. Now, what is the meaning of this little impromptu meeting? Is everything all right?”
When Draco came back out after putting his daughter to bed, he was surprised to find his kitchen clean and the mess from dinner gone.

He lurched from the chair and was on top of the boy, yanking the offensive dildo from Draco’s limp fingers. He threw it to the side with a disgusted snarl, returning his hands to the boy’s pale thighs, shoving them open.
Draco sat up, rubbing at his eyes with the back of his hand. “I’m not curious about you. Not in the slightest,” he said indignantly.
“Beg me, little one. Beg me for your release,” Harry snarled against his skin.
Pansy’s eyes softened and nodded. “I know, Draco, but without an Alpha’s magic and pheromones, your baby won’t grow like they’re supposed to.”
“That’s odd. Had they been home at the time of the break in?”
need Harry to pleasure himself. He just needed to focus.
He was dressed in a black, formfitting equestrian jacket, and matching trousers that molded to his strong legs. Black leather riding boots encased his feet, ending at mid-calf.
Hope you enjoyed this chapter! 🖤 Thank you for all the love! 🥰
“Why does that not surprise me…” Draco mumbled.
“What...what was Harry’s mother’s name?”
Draco whined, the ache intensifying and demanding attention. He undulated against Potter’s lap, rubbing their erections together roughly in attempt to stave off some of the ramping desire within him.
Draco closed his eyes, his prick hardening against his will. “Please, stop.
”You should know that I love the taste of your hatred. It gets me hard, little one.”
“Do not ask me such questions and do not ever go back in the room without my permission

Harry quickly stubbed out his cigarette in the ashtray next to his sofa and stood up. “It’s all right, Draco. Did you need something?”
The sofa was small, but Harry would
The small village was decorated for Christmas. Red, green, and blue Christmas lights were strung up across the front of the quaint shops. Enchanted candles floated within the snow-dusted trees and different holiday game and merchandise booths were set up for the students and parents that were visiting for the festival.
Draco nodded slightly. “
“Want it that badly, do you? I’ll give you what you crave, little one.” Harry used one hand to line up his cock with Draco’s hole, roughly yanking his hips lower with the other.
“He’s excited,” Harry said, chuckling as he wiped a bit of the egg from his bare chest.
”So pretty. Do you touch them often?”
Harry continued to give the rabbit tongue baths because of his aversion to water. Each bath, the rabbit became more and more relaxed under Harry’s care.
He adjusted Scorpius on his hip, his eyes flickering down to his son.
Harry shoved a third finger into Draco’s stretched hole and flattened his tongue under his prick at the same time, teasing the sensitive skin on the underside of his shaft with slow, languid licks without abating the rapturous suction of his mouth.
When he felt Harry’s foot nudge his erection, he whimpered around his length.
His loved ones.
innocuous.”
“I’m sorr—” Draco cut himself off, mortification and disgust overtaking him at what he was about to say.
How had Harry known where he would be?
It wouldn’t be long now.
Harry knew Draco was hesitant to tell his parents the truth and Harry didn’t want to push him to do it. Their trust in each other had finally been established and he didn’t want to ruin what they had built so far.
Scorpius began wriggling in his arms, showings signs of wanting to feed. “No plans of marriage?” Draco pressed, instantaneously regretting such a blunt question.
Draco alongside him. He eventually pulled him into a narrow space between two shops that were lit with strung lights, casting a red and green glow to the darkened area.
Sighing, he lifted up the hem of his jumper, examining his pale, flat stomach. He placed his free hand on his belly, rubbing it softly.
Harry growled, dropping down and allowing Draco to wrap his arms around his neck. The boy pulled back to look at him, his eyes flicking down to Harry’s lips.
His mother looked enamored, the obvious affection in her eyes something unfamiliar to him. It was surreal to see his mother in the photo, in a life before having him. She looked happy and young.
Draco was in heat.
to look, not to sift through this woman’s memories.
Potter’s green eyes darkened when they flicked down over Draco’s hard nipples, exposed due to his torn shirt.
of carnivores, though.
The raw desperation in Harry’s voice spurred him on, leaning forward and grabbing his cock. When Harry hissed out a breath through his teeth, Draco parted his lips and gave the head a coquettish lick.
Harry rolled his eyes and grabbed his wrist, unlocking the stall door and pulling him out alongside him.
Harry couldn’t wait to see the slick Draco could produce.
“Hermione,” Ron said softly. “It’s not your fault. It’s not Draco’s fault. It’s not anyone’s fault except Harry’s.”
Harry let out a low groan.
Kreacher always made sure he ate at least three meals a day, becoming stubborn if he refused to snack in between.
Harry wondered what exactly he meant by that, but he decided to press further.
Lucius nodded and gave Narcissa a smug smile. “Well, I guess that settles it, then.”
“Just what?” Harry purred, leaning down to nuzzle against Draco’s
“No,” Draco said hoarsely. “I’m not. I got upset because Hermione brought up an old friend of mine in the letter and it made me...sad.”
He knew that his obsessive thoughts about the boy needed to stop.
that my husband is missing, Potter. I wouldn’t even be here, entertaining some stranger while we discuss my body’s current biological needs. It’s embarrassing and I needn’t be reminded of the cause of this situation.”
Harry couldn’t stand it anymore. He gathered the boy into his arms, pulling him onto his lap. “
Harry backed Draco up against the side of the shop, returning his kiss with equal fervor. He reached down to grab Draco’s thigh, hitching it up on his waist. His Alpha ground his thick erection against Draco’s own covered prick, growling low as he plundered Draco’s mouth with his tongue. His entrance was swiftly gathering with slick, his body
He held completely still beneath the covers, shaking.
He took a deep breath and made his way to the terrace, Harry’s comforting presence at his back.
Pansy pulled him closer and said in a hushed tone, “I need you to bring something out to the stables for me and give it to the man working there. I’m much too busy today to go myself.”
Draco vehemently shook his head, begging Harry with his eyes.
The rabbit had softly growled in displeasure, pawing in the air as a sign for Harry to continue.
Hermione let a dry bark of laughter. “You’d pick another adjective if you had to live with her.” She smiled warmly. “But she does a good job of cheering us up when we’re in foul moods.”
life. The boy is at the perfect age and with his mother being shipped off to Azkaban, he’ll be under the care of the Ministry indefinitely. Omegas are such vulnerable creatures already, weak and reliant on the protection of others. With an Alpha to take care of him, Draco will be better off, and the Ministry can keep an eye on him. This seems like a perfect solution.”
His mother placed her hands on her hips. “Maybe you should take him over to visit with Blaise. You haven’t seen him since the festival and Scorpius would probably love to see him. It would do you both some good.”
Not just fucking, but also
Without another word, Harry slowly sunk into him.
Scorpius hiccuped and giggled, reaching for Harry.
The domestic scene in front of him made Draco’s chest tighten.
“You weren’t acting so shy in front of that fucking Healer today,” he hissed, tipping up Draco’s chin with the fingers of his other hand.
“Mione,” Ron said softly. “There’s some things about Harry that we’ve been…unaware of over the past couple of months.”
“I feel okay now. Thanks to you,” he mumbled, feeling his cheeks heat.
“You don’t have to answer me right now. I know it’s been a rough couple of days for you. Are you feeling better after last night?”
“Eh, I understand that. The manor can become a bit stifling.” Theo released his hand and canted his head towards the mare. “Go ahead and try to pet her again, but this time behind the ears.”

He watched in horror as Potter pulled off one of his riding gloves with his teeth and then brought it down to press it to Draco’s mouth.

Draco’s head snapped up, his eyes connecting with Harry’s. “W-what?”
“Keep your legs
to be a part of his life.
What was
Harry grabbed his arm and yanked him down, impaling him on his hard cock.
“Just wanted your friends to like me,” he murmured, scrunching his brows together when he felt his stomach briefly roil.
Draco flushed hotly, Harry’s words inciting a flare of arousal deep in his belly. He knew his parents’ home wasn’t the most appropriate place to become aroused, but his mate always seemed to make him desperate for it no matter the location.
At first glance, he couldn’t see Draco in the room. The bed was empty and Harry’s eyes traveled down, locking on the edge of the sheets sticking out from the side of the bed on the floor.
“Your manacles had rendered you magically null. The island has an Anti-Apparation jinx on it. Without a wand, escape is almost impossible.”
Draco came awake suddenly, expecting to feel the aches and pains that always clung to him after his intense heats. Usually after his heats—especially after having Scorpius—he would wake up feeling as if he’d been hit with the Crutiatus Curse.
His mum turned her sharp gaze to Harry, arching a brow. “And what about you, Mr. Potter? Are you in love with my son?”
Harry lightly pressed his palm against Draco’s stomach, shooting him a devilish grin when their pup kicked in reaction to their Alpha’s touch.
It felt…good.
Harry looked like he wanted to say something but had decided against it, returning his attention to his food.
He had hated it.
Harry carried over two plates of pancakes and slightly overdone scrambled eggs, placing them in front of Draco and Scorpius on the table. The syrup, butter, and utensils were already placed on the table, ready to be used.
Ron’s ears flattened, his amber eyes casting Harry a look of disbelief. He could become so surly at times, but Harry knew it was because he was a fox breed. They often lost their temper for the most trivial things.
“Wait,” Harry grabbed Draco’s forearm, stopping him.
Several Unspeakables glided silently by him in the black-tiled corridor of Level Nine. He knew where the Pensieve was kept.

“You’re dripping water all over my floor.”
His voice broke on the last word, going quiet for a beat before continuing.
”I want this one.”
want?” she hissed, her voice hoarse from disuse.
Along with the moors’ dreary atmosphere, the manor itself seemed to be barren of anything that held any semblance of joy. There were no family portraits, only haunting tapestries that depicted scenes of brutal hunts or the grey moors itself.
Draco stood at the entrance to the drawing room, hugging himself. “S-sorry! I didn’t mean to interrupt…”
?” someone called out softly from the entrance to the stables. “Draco, are you out here?”
Auror Thorne brandished his wand, using it to unlock the reinforced door. It slid open with a heavy groan.
Harry felt twisted satisfaction at Draco’s admission, delighted that the boy wasn’t currently with an Alpha.
The boy turned over and nuzzled against Harry’s chest hair, purring contentedly.
It was undeniably mad to keep having these thoughts over the boy. He decided that he would push the boy from his mind and focus on work.
He was trying to keep it together for the sake of his daughter and his pregnancy, but it was becoming more difficult with each passing day.  The last thing he wanted to do was admit defeat and move back in with his
It didn’t help. His cock was hard and ready for his Omega and wasn’t waning anytime soon.
The scent led him to a door at the far end of the corridor to left. He used his magic to unlock the door, turning the handle and entering.
Draco shook his head, droplets of water falling from his damp hair with the motion. “Please don’t hurt him, Harry. It was nothing,
Harry narrowed his eyes and pulled out his slick-coated finger before lowering his head between Draco’s legs. Without any preamble, he swiped his tongue up Draco’s hole, collecting the leaking slick into his mouth.
“So, what was the plan, pet? I’d really love to hear it. Would you seduce me into fucking you tonight and when I was finally asleep, bash me over the head with an object, like you tried to do when we first met?”
Draco shook his head, his eyes appearing watery. “No…I don’t want to use magic or potions. I’m afraid it wouldn’t be safe for Scorpius to consume my milk if I treated my pain with magic. I tried to use a Muggle breast-pump once, but it h-hurts.”
The bond that would form between him and Roland if they signed the contract would be a farce. Just an exchange on paper that would inevitably have stipulations and addenda.
With begrudging acceptance, he allowed Potter to press the cool leather between his teeth.
“You need to scrub harder. That’s why the floors still have grime.”
It reminded Draco of…
at him.
A plate and a glass of water landed in front of him on the table. A fork and spoon were tucked to the side of the plate. It was a simple meal of eggs, bacon, and oatmeal.
“Sorry,” Draco said sheepishly. “Do you need any help?”
When he’d gotten pregnant, he’d had to leave school before his last year. He wanted to go back this year to sit for his NEWTs and get a high-paying job so that he could support Scorpius on his own.
Harry’s refusal to allow him
Harry found things attractive about Draco that he had never noticed on another person before: the curve of his full lower lip, his pale, slender wrists, and the column of his elegant throat...
happened.”
,” Draco begged.
Jack smirked and shook his head. “No. I’ll be in my office if you need me, Auror Potter.”
He hadn’t seen another rabbit in a long time. He gave a surreptitious sniff, scenting her.
He’d been trying to wean him for the past two weeks and he’d been able to get Scorpius down to only feeding for comfort rather than hunger.
Is this what he survived for? To be raped and bred like chattel?
Draco nodded, one of his small breasts pressing against Harry’s chest, wetting his shirt. Harry felt the wet spot against his skin, seeming to burn him.
Draco’s trembling worsened, his fear and arousal warring inside of him.
“Sirius?”
Each memory seemed to snap an already fraying thread that held his mind together.
Harry glared down at the fidgeting Auror.
It was usually a process reserved for young, but Harry supposed he could make an exception for the vulnerable creature.
Draco reluctantly opened his eyes.
Draco gritted his teeth and picked up the toy again, pressing the head of the dildo against his hole.
upset you?”
Draco nodded; his blond hair plastered to his forehead from sweat. “I want it, too, Alpha. Want it
Harry was quiet for a few tense moments before tugging Draco towards the sofa. He sat down, pulling Draco on top of his lap, facing away from him. He placed his large hands on both sides of Draco’s stomach beneath his jumper, gently kneading.
Draco sucked in a sharp breath, coming in his pyjama bottoms.
Draco’s heart did a ridiculous flip-flop in response, shyly smiling up at him.
Harry groaned low, throwing his head back and shifting his legs farther apart to give his Omega better access.

Harry grasped Draco’s hips with his large hands, pulling him closer. “Still full, though?”
He wasn’t broken.

“I’ll take care of it, Pansy,” Draco said curtly, not wanting to continue the conversation. “It’s only been three months since Theo’s disappearance and I’m still trying to get my life back under control while it’s in its current disastrous state.”
Simply put, he desired a
“I should go,” Harry rasped, finally looking away from him.
He really didn’t like coming here.
Harry desperately wanted to be that person for Draco, and he wouldn’t fuck it up by going
“With
“Master Potter requires all new staff to meet him before starting. He doesn’t trust people, really.”
The past few months had been torturous for him. He couldn’t even use the excuse of the investigation anymore. His Aurors had been pulled from watch duty at Malfoy Manor nearly two months ago by order from the Minister himself. The investigation was ongoing, but it seemed that the Malfoys were in no immediate danger.
Harry groaned and scrubbed a hand down his face.
“I-I, um, have to go nurse Scorpius now,” Draco stammered, turning to quickly walk back inside.
He wasn’t going to make this easy for him. Harry wanted him to admit his feelings.
Harry narrowed his eyes. “That’s not what I meant, Draco.”
Harry’s lips were parted, his emerald eyes alight with something Draco couldn’t discern.
“Closer.”
Draco was limp, both of his legs still bent and spread. Some of Harry’s cum had unfortunately seeped from his opening, mixing with the pooled slick beneath his hips. His long ear wasn’t bleeding anymore, the wound sealed off due to Harry’s saliva.
“Y-yeah. It’s just, um, hormones,” Draco stammered, his voice thick with emotion.
He let out a startled yelp, involuntary taking a step back. His foot caught on his plush rug, causing him to stumble.
t-this?” Draco cried, trying to squirm away from Harry’s punishing grip.

It was different now.
Harry shoved a third finger into Draco’s hole, quickening the pace. His hole squelched noisily around his fingers, brushing against
Harry Potter stood in front of him, his eyes flicking down and over Draco’s stomach.
The chime from his Floo alerted them to someone’s arrival.
Harry wondered if the Minister had ever even
Harry smirked and leaned down, pressing his lips to Draco’s forehead. He pulled back and met Draco’s eyes.
Draco’s eyes were slitted, glazed with desire as he watched. He was undulating against Harry, his cute little Omega prick rubbing against his abdomen, covering it with pre-cum.
Harry ran a hand through his unkempt hair and sighed. “I know. I’m sorry for my behavior the past few months, Hermione. There’s no excuse for me to completely shut out my friends. I didn’t mean to worry you.”

Harry pressed his fingers to his hole, smiling. “Already wet for your
”Let go of me!” Draco shrieked, trying to twist out of Potter’s grasp on his shirt.
Draco would wake up in the middle of the night and find himself curled around Harry. He would feel instant revulsion, immediately recoiling from the cruel man.
“So wet, sweetheart. Is this for me, or the Alpha you were with?”
His hat was once again slipped off of his head, Harry’s long fingers burrowing into his hair as they kissed, pulling him closer. When Harry began tugging Draco’s coat down from his shoulders with his other hand, he pulled away.
The man gave a noncommittal hum, his eyes traveling over each of Draco’s slim fingers. The firelight reflected on the man’s dark hair, giving the illusion of a flickering burgundy glow within his raven locks.
Harry’s face fell, making Draco hate himself even more.
Draco knew he shouldn’t be here. He shouldn’t have sought out Harry like some
Draco let out a choked sob, throwing his head back on Harry’s shoulder.

Two large warm hands settled on either side of his hips, making him stiffen.

“I’m just trying to
Ignoring all of his instincts, he pressed the dildo further, letting the bulbous head stretch past the tight ring of muscles.
“Werewolf!” Scorpius shouted, reaching out for Harry.
The liquid still dampening his clothes suddenly vanished, leaving him completely dry.
“I love you, Draco,” he whispered, closing his eyes. “I love you so much. When you refused me, I wanted to deny the way I felt about you. I tried so hard to deny it, but deep down, I knew you’d left an indelible mark on me. I knew I’d always love you, even if you would never love me back. You’re my mate and you are all I’ve ever wanted.”
Harry’s eyes softened. “What is it, baby?”
“Oh? Your mind might not want me, but your body does, little one. Let me show you how much control you really have.”
Harry mentally berated himself for the thought. Draco wasn’t
The scent of Draco’s breast milk, pheromones, and slick was making his mouth pool with saliva.
”Do I taste
A tall man with dark blond hair was leaning against the side of the stall of the mare, a smirk turning up his lips.
“Oh, baby...” he said softly, disgusted with himself.
Draco worried his bottom lip between his teeth before slowly nodding. “Okay.”
Harry raked his eyes down Draco’s body, flicking back up to linger on his chest.
Harry stood and ran a hand through his hair. “Kreacher, go put scent and sound blocking spells around the boy’s room.
That blasted Witch Weekly had just recently printed an entire article dedicated to Harry’s seemingly perpetual bachelor status since breaking it off with Ginny. He had become so infuriated, so excruciatingly

, Harry,” he whispered. “Now,
. You were one of our top Aurors at one time, and we would be happy to gift you the boy as a show of good faith.”
Draco writhed beneath his mouth, his hard prick laying against his flat, pale stomach and messily drizzling pre-cum across his abdomen as he squirmed.
When his rabbit gave a needy whimper, he couldn’t resist.
“I can be a bit late. I hadn’t expected you and Scorpius to stay over and I didn’t want to leave you after last night. I was afraid you wouldn’t feel well when you woke up.”
It had been the most beautiful thing Harry had ever witnessed.
The thought of Draco and Scorpius under the care of some strange Alpha,
He pushed the words through their bond, hoping Harry understood.
He wished he could tell Hermione everything. He wished she could take him away from all of this. He wished…
Harry swept the dishes on the table to the floor with one arm. They crashed to the tiled floor next to Draco’s bare feet, making him flinch.
and swift through his heart.
A compendium of small black birds dispersed from the spindly balustrade next to the carriage and flew up, circling the highest turret of the manor, adding a foreboding effect to the image that would unsettle even the most taciturn man.
Harry pocketed his wand once more and shrugged.
He could remember bits and pieces of the night before and one particular image stood out clearly in his mind: straddling Harry’s lap and rubbing against him as if he were in heat.
have anything to do with his child’s upbringing.
Harry’s mouth flooded with saliva, his cock hardening at the sight. It was so viscerally…
“What do you say to visiting your Aunt Hermione and Cousin Rose in London?”
remember, Draco?” Harry’s long fingers curled around his ribs, dangerously close to one of his nipples.
He shifted Scorpius on his hip and looked up Harry shyly. “You could have woken me up, Harry. I could have helped you make breakfast.”
Draco inwardly flinched, not liking the memory of that terrible day. Harry had been upset after discovering the truth out about Scorpius and sought him out to confront him.
. That had been Harry taking what he wanted.
Draco switched Scorpius around in arms, letting the pup latch onto his other nipple before responding. “I-I don’t know, Mr. Potter. I don’t want to intrude…I feel so silly making such a fuss about this…” Draco let his finger brush across one of Scorpius’ cheeks absentmindedly as the pup suckled.
,” Draco begged, pressing out his chest and his leaking nipples.
He sat in Harry’s kitchen, at his table. He held Scorpius in his arms, alternating between trying to keep his pup entertained and trying not to stare at Harry as he prepared dinner for them both.
He felt blocked at every turn, an impenetrable wall always in the way in the form of Harry Potter.
anything for them. That’s all I was trying to say.”
Draco ran his knuckle over his son’s cheek, marveling at how he could have created such a perfect being.
No matter what reassurances Harry cooed, or how many ear scratches he gave, the rabbit remained in his animal form.
“Mmm,” Draco hummed noncommittally. “Speaking of friends, did you have fun at the neighbor’s?”
Harry grabbed his wrist, pulling Draco’s hand down. He kissed the inside of his wrist, his stubble lightly scraping against his skin and making him shiver.
Harry slid his hands upwards, just beneath his aching breasts. He raised his thumbs, pressing them down into the tender flesh beneath his swollen nipples.
Draco continued to eat his food, an awkward silence following.
Draco’s head snapped up, his gaze connecting with Sirius’ in the portrait.
Harry’s eyes flicked up, his fingers tightening on the envelope.  “Something you want to say, Jack?”
The simple black collar around his neck had been designed by Octavius. He had informed Harry that it was designed to negate his magic use. He had also told him it was charmed to adjust to his size. That meant that when the rabbit decided to change back, the collar would adjust accordingly.
On the front page, however, was an article dedicated to Narcissa Malfoy’s capture.
?” Draco squawked, unable to process anything else.
He was sickened to realize that his prick was hard between his legs, trapped between both of them.
A contended purr sounded from his chest as Harry’s magic suffused him, losing himself in the dizzying influx of his Alpha’s magic and pheromones suddenly overtaking his body.
Theo?
His daughter nodded. “I put it on the kitchen table. Can I go to my room for a bit and read my comics?”
Harry was the first one to slowly pull back, smiling as his eyes darkened. “Another one of your firsts that belongs to me,” he purred, quickly leaning forward to swipe his tongue against Draco’s trembling lower lip before pulling away again, “and what an impassioned first it was. Where is that hate you always speak of, Draco?”
He stood and quickly dressed, trying to be as quiet as possible.
Draco glanced back at Jack and gave him a shy smile. “Thank you, Jack. I’ll try to bring Scorpius by sometime and I’ll remember to bring some baked goods for the rest of the team the next time as well.”
That simply wasn’t the truth.
Draco’s earlier harsh words made him inwardly cringe. He hadn’t meant to be so cruel, but Harry’s own insult had angered him in turn.
Harry gritted his teeth, taking another harsh drag of his cigarette.
His cum shot up and splattered against Harry’s stomach and chest, the pearly cum catching in Harry’s sparse chest hair.
Harry sucked and licked at his hole, his long fingers still pressing his legs back.
He knew that he had to stop having these obsessive thoughts about the boy, but he seemed unable to fight his baser instincts. Draco was an Omega, a

Muggles passed him, on their way to work or whatever other obligation they had to rush off to.
“Hello again,” Draco said shyly, nervously adjusting his pup on his hip.
He stormed from his office, making a direct path for the Floo Network with only one destination in mind.
Harry turned and Draco’s heart tightened at what he saw in his emerald gaze.
he whispered, his voice cracking on his name. He cleared his throat before speaking again.
Harry stared down at them, suddenly feeling as if the collar of his shirt was too tight.
Harry gave a low chuckle. “I want you, too, Draco. Are you coming home to me tonight?”
Pansy let out a strangled sigh. “Draco, I understand your reluctance, really I do, but you need to do this. If you don’t, your baby will suffer.”
“Maybe she would have been better off if she never had me. Perhaps her life would have been…happier. I also can’t help but wonder, if I were
He missed Draco and his pup. He wanted to see them again, talk to them,
Draco suspected it was because of his own mood. He had been admittedly sulking the past week and dreading the fallout of his admission to Harry.
Draco inhaled deeply through his nostrils, trying to be patient with his eight-year-old whose budding magic was on the cusp of adolescence.
“Naughty boy,” he hissed. “Attacking your Alpha and then attempting to escape me? There is no escape, Draco. You belong to
He would give his mate anything, just as Harry would do the same for him.
Harry relinquished Draco’s prick from his mouth and stood, placing one knee on the sofa beside Draco’s hip.
The boy's slender arms were stretched taut overtop his head, his wrists bound and tied to an eyelet hook that was bolted to the exam table above his head.
Harry was dressed in black slacks and a dark green button-down that complimented his olive skin. His dark hair looked unkempt, as if he’d been running his fingers through it repeatedly.
Harry was only wearing a pair of boxer briefs, his tail unconsciously flicking happily next to him on the bed due to the sight of the boy slumbering on top of him.
His dark hair was wet, errant droplets sliding down from his temples and curving over his sharp cheekbones.
all of the sudden.
Draco licked his suddenly dry lips before replying.
When he had Scorpius, he had thought that broken thing would be magically fixed, but that wasn’t the reality. Children weren’t magical Band-Aids for the soul when you had them, no. They could be a catalyst for self-healing, but not a solution.
Draco opened his eyes and turned to glare at him. “Do you think that’s a

“What the hell are you doing? Put your clothes back on and get away from me!” Draco shouted, scrambling backwards on the bed.
He wanted them to be close again. He wanted Harry to look at him like he had that night in Hogsmeade, like he was deeply,
For Harry
“They’re getting bigger,” he said and smirked when Draco tightened his arm over himself.
“What’s wrong? Are you too tired to walk?” His gaze briefly dropped to his belly. “Is the pup all right?”
When he had found out about his pregnancy, he had so much to think about and plan. He had known that Harry was an Auror for the Ministry, and he hadn’t wanted to interrupt his career and life for an unplanned pregnancy.
He needed to get on with his life, or at least attempt to.
He smiled and shook his head. “I think I want it to be a surprise, Arlen.”

scent all over the boy. Mark him until he only smelled of
“Fuck you!” Draco shouted, scrambling to the side of the bed as much as the rope around his wrists would allow.
“Well, I suppose that would be all right,” Draco said softly.
Scorpius opened his eyes and stared up at Harry.
Before Harry could finish his pleading, Draco leaned forward and grabbed Harry’s cock with one hand, sucking his shaft into the back of his throat in one go.
“They recommend I pick a new alpha by the end of the month,” he murmured. “It’s just...hard for me.”
Life with Ginny would be uncomplicated and organized, and that was the way Harry wanted it.
Harry looked at his friend, guilt gnawing at him for being so emotionally and mentally vacant the past few months.
He shouldn’t have been taking comfort in Harry’s damning touch, but he
No, that couldn’t be it. He thought he must surely be mistaken.

Draco turned to look at Harry, who was holding their sleeping pup.
Draco shook his head, pressing the back of his hand to his mouth. A single tear slid from the corner of his eye and fell to photo, the droplet landing on Harry’s face. It warped his image, making his features indistinguishable.
, Omega.”
He held the Daily Prophet, his eyes narrowing.
Draco studied the moving photo, his eyes immediately drawn to Harry.
Harry pulled back, a cruel smile on his now wet lips. “Listen to yourself. Begging for that prick. Do you want him, Draco? Could he even make you as wet as I can? Would you spread your legs like a whore—”
to his pup and any future pups he would give the boy.
The following silence seemed deafening to Draco, his aching heart beating a staccato rhythm against his rib cage.
Unable to stop himself, he dropped to his knees in front of Harry, wanting to show his Alpha just how much he wanted him.
And that wasn’t doing much because Potter towered over him by at least a foot.
When Harry had seen the boy naked for the first time, his gaze had been immediately riveted between the boy’s soft, pale thighs.
He felt cornered.
”I-I’m sorry, Master Potter. I’ll be sure to keep a close eye on him from now on. It won’t happen again.”
Harry glanced up and smiled. “Good morning, Draco. I made coffee and breakfast. Are you feeling well enough to eat?”
Draco pursed his pink lips and took Harry by surprise by suddenly straddling him on the sofa.
He knew that Draco was a virgin and felt possessive satisfaction settle over him in thick, proprietary waves.
Harry rammed his cock deep, Draco’s slick allowing his knot to effortlessly pop past the tight ring of muscles. Harry sank his teeth into Draco’s gland, groaning at how good it felt. When he was seated all the way in, he came, shooting his cum deep inside of the boy, filling him up—
He had lurched backwards, pressing himself against the wall on the other side of the bed.
Draco felt shame wash over him, mixing with a heavy dose of guilt. He had just let his abusive captor fuck him and had

if it hurts? So pathetic...just like your parents.”
Draco pulled back, his eyes widening. “W-what? I can’t do that, Harry…”
Harry stepped in front of him, almost blocking his view of Roland.
In the very back left corner of the cage, was a rabbit.
“It’s small but it’s there. Take a look, Draco.”
He was a
He realized that there was still so much he didn’t know about Harry.
“Take care of yourself, Draco.”
He repeated the mantra in his head until his heartrate had slowed back to a normal rhythm and his breathing evened out.
”I didn’t mean to corner you like this, Draco. I’m sorry again that I took you by surprise. Please know it wasn’t my intention to interrupt...” Harry’s green eyes flicked down to Scorpius, “feeding your pup.”
Draco knew what Harry wanted, but he didn’t know if he could actually go through with it while conscious. He knew that when his heat would take over, there wouldn’t be much of a choice at that point. He knew he would willingly spread his legs for Harry, eager for him to soothe the ache inside of him that only an Alpha could ease.
Harry nipped at one, accidentally nicking it with his fang.
Harry grinned, carrying him up the stairs. “I’ll have to let the Ministry know that Firewhisky is a much better truth serum than Veritaserum.”
Hermione chuckled and took the photo from his hands, replacing it with another one.
His hopeful expression shattered and revealed an aching vulnerability beneath. It slowly morphed into begrudging acceptance before it was wiped from his face altogether.
The boy rolled to his back on the bed, his pert nose wrinkling. The dress shirt had ridden up his thighs, almost revealing the tip of his cock.
“Ginny?” he asked, stepping up behind her at the stove.
Rose giggled and shook her head, her long red hair swaying with the movement. “You don’t operate on small cuts, Harry! You kiss them better!”
His rabbit’s eyes were closed, his eyes moving restlessly beneath his lids. Harry watched in avid fascination as a droplet of perspiration slid down the boy’s neck and caught on the back of his collar.
After a few moments, he let his tongue trail lower, licking the rabbit’s spine and then back up to his face.
“W-wait,” Draco stammered, placing both of his hands flat on Harry’s heaving chest. “
! I meant, you could just wet your fingers in your mouth and…rub them,” he finished weakly. “That would be less…
Even though the smell of rain and the stables surrounded them, Draco could scent that Theo was an alpha.
. I missed you, Harry.”
Harry lifted his spit-covered fingers in front of Draco’s widening eyes and stuck them in his mouth, licking at Draco’s saliva and dried slick.
“Mummy, play?” Scorpius asked, his green eyes bright as he gazed up at Draco.
He hated the desperate lilt to his voice, but it was becoming clear that his mother intended for him to be sent away for a long while and they’d never been parted for more than a day since he was born.
spirits
Draco’s blond hair was longer now, pieces of it stuck to his flushed cheeks and forehead. His gray peacoat was open at the throat, a dark green scarf thrown around his pale throat haphazardly. He wasn’t wearing any gloves, his slender fingers reaching up in an attempt to try to snatch his hat back from Blaise.
father
Harry took the lit cigarette from between his lips. “What has to stop?”
He thought of Harry cleaning up his kitchen and giving Juni her doll after she had dropped it.
Harry was his mate and the father of his pup and his body knew that. It eagerly welcomed his touch and his jellybean continued to grow stronger because of his transference of magic. His heart, however, was an entirely different story.
Draco’s smile fell and he hugged himself tightly, making Harry’s heart clench.
It was heavily warded, but Harry had the authority and the magic to open it. The memories contained within the cabinet belonged to prisoners of Azkaban, Ministers before Kingsley, and even of witches and wizards long gone from this world.
He had used a disposable Muggle camera to take them. He had taken them all when Draco had been unaware. In this particular photo, Draco was noticeably pregnant. He had fallen asleep in Harry’s office on the sofa, his jumper tight against his rounded stomach.
Harry leaned over the boy and flicked out his tongue, pressing it against one of the boy’s hardened nubs. His sweetheart mewled, undulating under his tongue. After leaving both of the boy’s nipples coated in his saliva, he moved up to his long ears. He cleaned each one with long laps of his tongue, the fur soft beneath rough tongue.
time.
The rabbit only stared blankly up at him, the small puff that was his tail vibrating.
Harry set the phial on his desk and pulled out a small folded letter that had been in the envelope too. He opened the letter, flattening it out on the top of his desk to be able to better read it. That, and his hands were shaking too much to hold it steady as he read.
Draco’s own prick was hard underneath his joggers, but he didn’t even care. The shared bond was the most intoxicating thing he had ever felt. To feel his mate’s most secret, inner feelings was the most pleasurable thing he had ever felt in his life.
, he would need someone by his side through this. If the Wizengamot found him guilty, he would be serving an unknown amount of time in Azkaban as punishment. Even if Harry was truly guilty of the heinous things he had admitted to, he was still Hermione’s friend. Years of friendship, trust, and love didn’t just
“S-stop it, Harry. It’s already so hard for me and you’re just going to mess it up by
Draco let out a sharp cry before spraying his cum into the back of Harry’s throat, his back arching off the table with the force of his orgasm.

Draco was distracted, so when he felt a blunt nail scrape against the heel of his hand, he let out a startled gasp at the pinch of pain that followed.
No, there had to be
Scorpius would occasionally ask about his ‘werewolf’ and each time it would send a pang to Draco’s heart.
“Draco? What’s happened, love?”
, a strangled whine escaped him, reveling in the feeling of Harry’s tongue against his sensitive skin.
Draco groaned, slouching over on Harry’s sofa in the drawing room. One drink had turned into three. His head felt fuzzy and skin felt too warm. He had stubbornly insisted on continuing to drink even though Harry had warned him against it.
He blinked, fighting back tears, averting Harry’s gaze when he saw him smugly smirk.
Draco’s head was resting on Harry’s chest. His eyes were closed, his breath gusting across Harry’s chest in slow pants.
”Don’t be frightened, I won’t hurt you,” Harry whispered.
Draco opened his mouth to reply, but another sharp pain in his back made him grimace.
Hermione snorted delicately, turning to arch a brow at him. “Yes, but with
The familiar deep timbre made him instantly straighten and whirl around.
He had never had anything like their bond, and he was fine with waiting until they were both ready again.
A large checkout counter that appeared to be one hunk of raw black granite, came into view. There were slivers of luminescent light within the granite, flaring at different intervals and casting an otherworldly glow to the craggy wizard’s face sitting behind the counter.
Once they were met with the cool night air outside of the posh restaurant, Draco halted, digging his heels into the paved sidewalk to make Harry stop.
“Oh?” Draco breathed. “Who are you here with?”

Pansy’s dark eyes softened, and she took his blistered hands into her own, gently squeezing them.
Harry stood from the bed, staring down at Draco as he silently sobbed. “You’re coming downstairs with me. You will eat and you

He stepped forward and swept the boy up into his arms, holding him bridal style. When his sweetheart’s breath hitched, he knew his hole was hurting him.
Not only that, it seemed his Alpha wasn’t helping him wean their pup.
She gazed blankly at the patterned rug beneath her heels, following the intricate octagonal design with her eyes. Ron had purchased it as a surprise for her on one of his business trips to Egypt as an Auror. Harry had been with him on the trip when he was still working for the Ministry…

Draco gave Harry a wan smile. “Sorry about him. He wants you to hold him. He’s notoriously cuddly.”

Draco nodded stiffly. “Everything is all right, Mum. We just…have something to tell you.”

“Can we please hold off on talking right now? I miss Scorpius and I want to nurse him.”
to walk in on that,” he said dryly.
Harry suddenly took Draco’s chin between his strong fingers, turning his head to meet his gaze.
His father had gotten a flat somewhere in Muggle London, choosing to live on his own for awhile. He didn’t say it, but Draco knew his father had been disappointed in him for becoming pregnant so young. Even though he silently supported him, he knew that Lucius didn’t approve of him being a single parent.

“I w-want—“
Not that
Harry turned, his murderous expression morphing into one of genuine concern.

Before Draco could react, he was yanked in front of Harry, clumsily stumbling due to not being on his feet for so long.
Harry was wearing a dark coat, a burgundy scarf loosely wrapped around his neck. His thick black hair was dotted with fresh snowflakes, his lambent eyes rife with...
When he had been met with Harry’s detached gaze, something had further wilted inside of Draco.
Draco let out a despairing sob, the thought of his poor baby in the arms of a monstrous man like
My face the entire time writing this chapter: 😀
“I’m forever grateful for the Ministry’s hard work, especially when someone took down the wards.” His mother picked up one cup of tea, waving her other hand with nonchalance. “Pity they couldn’t catch the perpetrators.”
“Hmm,” Harry hummed noncommittally. “Sometimes, but I don’t miss the exams.”
Hermione snorted delicately. “That’s putting it lightly, but that’s not what we’re talking about, Harry. It’s been months and you’ve barely left your home except for work.”
Staring down at Narcissa, all he could see was
“I know you were special to Harry, even if he refuses to tell me what happened to you. I also know that my family probably had something to do with your death.”
He trailed off, biting his lower lip between his teeth as he sucked in a sharp breath.
he said, derision dripping from the last word.
The charred remainders of the photo floated to the stone floor between his legs as he watched.
Draco sighed and hefted his bag onto his shoulder. “It’s better this way, Mr. Potter. Last night shouldn’t have happened and I don’t want to be responsible for getting in between your relationship.”
Harry cupped one hand under Draco’s leg and lifted it, hooking it back over his hip.
Draco didn’t know why, but it rubbed him the wrong way.
He knew his pup needed a nap but was too keyed up to relax.
Memories bombarded him from all sides, Narcissa mercilessly inundating his eroding mind with images of Draco growing up.
His sweetheart had avoided him, even
Harry growled, his ears stiffening.
Cracking open one eye, he surveyed his surroundings. He jolted and sat up, his mouth falling open.
His cruel taunt was a bit much, but Harry had hurt him, too. His words stung because there was a thread of truth to them. Draco had been born and married into money and his marriage to Theodore had been arranged by their parents to ensure their bloodline remained pure.
, all those years ago at Hogwarts. They had been just boys...
Harry sat across from them in front his plate, smiling. “Has it been very difficult to wean him?”
Remembering last night, how Harry had curled an arm around his stomach, supporting him as he pounded into him from behind. Needy whimpers had escaped him with each thrust, his head turned to welcome Harry’s lips against his own—
? You were the one who
break down and beg for Harry to touch him. If he did that…he considered it to be losing the final piece of himself that he was trying so desperately to hold onto.
Harry let out a strained chuckle. “Are you
“He’s coming with me.”
Harry strode up the walkway and towards the entrance.
The man stiffened behind him and Draco glanced to the side, seeing Pansy standing completely still next to them. Shadows hid her expression from view, but Draco could see the knife still clutched in her right hand at her side.
his cock and his healing saliva.
Draco looked up from under his lashes at him. “It’s no problem. It’s nice to get outside for a while.”
”So needy,” Potter hissed out, sinking his finger deeper. “Maybe you are an omega whore after all.”
Hermione grinned, her brown eyes alight with beatific delight. “Does that mean you’ll go?”
Well, he was
Did all Omegas feel this helpless to their inherent nature?
“There it is,” Ron announced excitedly.
Draco swallowed thickly, letting out a soft gasp when the alpha began dragging him toward the front of the stables.
The door to the exam room suddenly opened and Harry walked in, coming to an abrupt halt. His eyes immediately zeroed in on Arlen’s hand pressed against Draco’s bare stomach.
When Draco had read about how sexual contact was encouraged with their Alpha during an Omega’s pregnancy, his ears had burned with embarrassment.
He knew Harry wasn’t comfortable keeping up the charade for his parents, but he did it for Draco’s sake. Even though Harry was eager to become a permanent part of Scorpius’ life, he wouldn’t push Draco about the issue of telling his parents the truth.
Draco scoffed. “We would be here for hours if I were to try to think of every person that held contempt for my father, Auror Potter. I know of your reputation and your history with my father. You could even be a suspect if we’re being honest.”
There was no winner. No good ending. No forgiveness.
Narcissa and Lucius both turned, Scorpius letting out a delighted shriek when he laid eyes on Draco.
He heard Potter get to his feet. ”You should take care with the way you speak to me, boy.”
?” Draco gasped, twisting his neck to look up at him.
, wet kiss, Harry knew he was done for.
Without Theo with him, he could already tell it was taking a toll on him. Even though joining the AIP was something he definitely did
Everything was closing in on him, his parents, Harry, his inability to keep
But it wasn’t the rape of his body that bothered him the most, it was the rape of his
”I promise I won’t bother him!” Rose zipped from the room before Hermione could say anything else.

, his mind whispered.
Harry reached up and began unbuttoning the boy’s top himself, his fingers clumsy in their haste to bare him. “I can’t see you in such pain. I’m an Alpha and my saliva can help, you know this.”
Harry arched a brow, halting his movement. “Why does it matter?”
No, he liked Draco the way he was, and he had never wanted him to be any other person except
Harry gritted his teeth, jealousy piercing
Draco was trembling, his eyes brimming with unshed tears at Pansy’s obvious disappointment in him.
Harry’s heart felt tight once again.
The conviction in Harry's words made Draco's heart flip-flop. He knew that Harry was telling the truth. He never felt so protected and loved in all his life.
“Now walk, Draco.”
Draco nodded, kissing around Harry’s fingers now. “Yeah. Especially d-during my heat. They burn if I don’t rub them...” he murmured between kisses.
“Well,” Harry said, standing up from his father’s chair, “then I guess there’s nothing left for us to discuss. I’m sorry for misinterpreting our relationship. You’re his mother, Draco, but I
Fear was evident in his voice, his glassy eyes wide with terror. He spread his legs submissively and pressed his chest out even more with a small whimper, not looking away from Harry.
Harry lifted his hand, cupping his cheek. He lightly slid his thumb along Draco’s cheekbone, and he was helpless not to lean into it.
He had never been treated as thus and had no one had ever seen him so exposed. He let his head drop to the hay in defeat, cursing his position and the man who held him close.
The skin next to Harry’s eye twitched, but he remained otherwise calm on the surface. “I’m so excited to see if we’re expecting, sweetheart.”
Draco didn’t think Harry even knew what the word love meant.
He didn’t…have sex with Harry during his heat, had he?
Draco grasped his erection and began slowly sliding his hand up and down, smearing his pre-cum along his shaft. He closed his eyes and tried to focus on alleviating his tension.
Or more specifically,
“What’s this now?” Harry chuckled in bemusement.
ya'll I need to go outside and touch some grass after writing this chapter. 😏
“What I feel for you is
,” he hissed, derision dripping from his words. “You cannot blink those pretty eyes at me and expect me to fall to me knees like some brainless beast being led around by his cock. Your wiles are
Harry let out a dry bark of laughter, giving him a quizzical look. “What a direct question. This isn’t like you. What game are you playing at?”
And if he was pregnant…his baby wouldn’t be able to survive without Harry’s presence and magic.
In the next second, the covers were ripped off him, making him let out a yelp of surprise.
He didn’t know how to fix it, but he was
Draco shook his head and stepped closer to the island.
He wanted to shift, the familiar symptom being his skin feeling too tight against his muscles.
He rearranged his features, slipping into the persona of congenial host. With his mask firmly in place, he made his way to the Floo.
“Yes,” he said softly. “You’re both my family.
Harry appeared over top of him, his lips glistening with slick and his own
The boy whined, raising his small hands to burrow his fingers into Harry’s hair. He sifted through his hair, grabbing the base of his pointed ears and gently pinching them between his fingers.
Inside of the iron cages, were collared herbivores.
“Do you like your new clothes?” he asked in a gravelly voice, his fingers trailing up Draco’s spine.
“I can’t,” Draco croaked. “I know you don’t understand, but I just…”
"Did you miss this?" Harry murmured against his throat, lightly kissing the sensitive skin above his collar.
If Harry had knotted him during his heat, there could be a babe already growing within him at that very moment.
would.
Draco suddenly yanked his and Harry’s fingers from his hole and lurched out of his lap. He staggered forward before whipping around, his legs trembling. “W-who are you? Where am I?” he asked shakily.
It was always Draco’s mother who swept his father’s wrongdoings under the rug and tried to shield him from the truth of what was really going on.
Everytime Harry had come, he had pulled Draco in for a heart-wrenching kiss that seemed to shake Draco to his core no matter how many times they did it.
“What was
. They were just two bodies occasionally stealing moments of pleasure from one another.
“That’s probably the Watchwizard they sent from the Ministry,” Draco said mulishly, smoothing out the wrinkles from his emerald Healer scrub top. He was showing, but not much. A small, rounded bump under his top was the only evidence of his pregnancy and his baggy top hid it well.
He adjusted Scorpius in his arms so that he was laying across his lap and lifted his borrowed shirt, exposing his breast. Scorpius latched on and made a contended humming noise as he began to nurse.
“The reason I asked if you had gone to school is because these hands,” he paused to squeeze one of Draco’s hands in his own, “are not the hands of someone who has been working most of their life. You have no calluses on your palms and your skin looks completely untouched by the sun.”
“Told her I was going to a friend’s place. She won’t worry,” Draco mumbled, purring contentedly against his Alpha’s neck.
The rabbit let out a breathy sniffle that sounded suspiciously like a sigh.
(See the end of the chapter for
Their bond pulsed, sensing each other’s presence and reaching out to connect. It took everything in him not to run to Harry and kiss him. They hadn’t kissed in what seemed like forever and Draco was
without my approval. It was pulled from her bag before she left, Draco. Kreacher brought it to me.”
Unlike the man who had abused him, he would face his fears head on. He didn’t want petty revenge. He wanted closure.
Enjoy. 😏
Harry stood and walked over to the bed, stopping directly in front of Draco.
Questions plagued him about what would happen to his body if he actually became pregnant. His mother had never liked talking about his father or her pregnancy with him. He knew it had been painful for her to remember those things, so he had never pressed.
Draco felt his face grow hot with anger.
He smiled fondly at her, watching the blonde halo of her curls fall around her round face as she tilted her head. Her blue eyes were narrowed in concentration, her small tongue poking out of her mouth as she smashed her potatoes into further mush.
saliva could provide.
“Go on, I’ll let myself out,” Pansy said, placing a comforting hand on his shoulder. “Just try to be civil, Draco. I know this all seems like it so much right now, but we’re all here for you.”
“Because of our ability to use magic, we’re able to see things a little more clearly. Muggles have to wait till at least six weeks gestation to see their little ones, but we’re able to see sooner. We can even determine the sex earlier. Anyway, I’m getting ahead of myself. Let’s see if anything is there first, shall we?”
Was the boy telling the truth?
The boy turned his head, his large eyes connecting with Harry’s.
“It’s only natural to be curious about your Alpha, Draco.”
One side of the man’s lips twitched. “So you
Feeling flayed by Harry’s obvious punishment, he sucked with irritated fervor, reaching up to gently palm Harry’s heavy sac as he sucked.
Draco was still shirtless and the room was cold. He hugged himself, rubbing at his exposed arms. Harry had probably left him half-naked on purpose, wanting him to feel as vulnerable as possible in his presence.
Harry pressed his tongue flat against the boy’s sweet tasting hole. He slid his hands up, using his thumbs to spread the boy wider. He stiffened his tongue and stuck it in the boy’s hole, curling it upwards as much as he was able.
Draco flinched when Harry shook his head.
Draco stared at the applicant in front of him. He’d picked the man from the folder he’d gotten from the AIP the week before.
“Harry,” he breathed, feeling inexplicably
Harry
“Whoa, look, Mummy! They’re hugging!”
Harry stared down at the both of them of them for several moments in silence before releasing a heavy sigh in return. “Let me help you, Draco. It’s not safe for you both to be on your own right now. The Ministry is only trying to err on the side of caution.”
Ginny smiled, but it didn’t reach her eyes. “Okay, I’ll see you inside, Harry.”
Draco shivered, moaning softly as even more slick oozed between his legs. The scent was enough to make Harry’s cock twitch against Draco’s, feeling the boy’s small prick spurt more pre-cum against his shaft.
He also thought about the fact that if Scorpius wasn’t currently with him to nurse, he knew Draco’s breasts were probably painfully engorged again. Swollen and dripping that sweet ambrosia that Harry knew tasted like
“Why?” Harry asked, his voice achingly absent of any emotion that had been freely shared between them last night.
“Kiss me, Harry,
Harry slowly stood and turned to stand in front of them.
The room—a study—looked empty at first, but Draco’s eyes snagged on a large form hunched over in a leather sitting chair behind the large mahogany desk in the center of the room.
The young man’s pup was sitting on his hip, his tiny fists balled against Draco’s chest. Draco’s gray eyes were reddened, his arms wrapped tightly around Scorpius. Draco’s blond hair was in disarray, the collar of his dark gray button-down slightly askew.
