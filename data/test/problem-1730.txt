mocked us to all the others I got an idea of how that felt, and I knew I deserved everything I got from him. I don't think I'd ever be like that again, but that hardly undoes what I did in the past. I don't even know if atonement's really my thing. So now you think, what? That there's a heart of gold beneath the jibes and the sneering? There's not, there's just me -”
It's not and Harry knows it, he could have killed Rita Skeeter in the aftermath of the war, the things she said about Draco. He knows it wasn't just the papers either, even if it has all died down now. God knows it took Ron forever to accept the two of them but he doesn't care, he was past caring what anybody thought of him by the time he was fifteen. Draco on the other hand -
Draco reaches for him with wretchedly needy arms, shockingly afraid of his backing off now - “Kiss me. Touch me – don't stop until you want me again -”
looking like that too and asking him to fuck him. He's only human, and he's wanted this for so long. He lunges in, shoving Draco back against that ridiculously over sized bed and pushing him back onto it.
Draco turns his head for the first time, looking at Harry back over his shoulder. Harry steps towards him and he does not waver; another step, and another.
He does not step back when Harry asks, but Harry allows himself to halfway breathe because he thinks perhaps – just perhaps – he would have already done it by now if he really meant to.
Funny how all that time ago using Draco's first name had been just about the most affectionate gesture he could make, now using each other's second names is either a term of endearment or faux – angry flirting.
He practically throws himself across the room and yanks open the door, slamming it behind him and standing in the corridor, breathing heavily, leaving Lucius still sat on the edge of the bed. He is still standing there, fists clenched, nostrils flaring, lip curling with a thousand unvoicable furies and bloody bastard fucking sodding Potter rounds the corner, stops when he sees him and raises an eyebrow in prelude to a question.
“You know what?” George stops walking in the middle of the flow, claps Draco on the shoulder and grins - “I
When he opens his eyes again, blinking hard he catches Pansy watching him curiously for just a split second before she looks away.
like Harry has not seen in years and his heart does fireworks as he pulls him close again with a savage tug. He kisses him fiercely, furiously, hating that he does this, that this isn't the first time and won't be the last, hating that his heart, his body always drag him back here on an assumption of hate that would be so much easier if it were true. It's always been a battle when they kiss and it's always been the only fight he has ever enjoyed. He needs this like breathing, needs
“God, you know what Malfoy? Shut up,” he grins and takes his lips in a kiss before Draco can say anything more. At some point he breaks away to look at at Harry with bright, glittering, feverish eyes and says -
adults? Weren't we? Now we're being asked to be kids again – it's like – do we even know how to do that?”
Harry looks at him with an entirely unreadable expression, moves back into the space of his breath and puts a hand back on his neck with agonising tenderness -
just imagining Draco's face if she tried, it makes him simultaneously want to laugh and die. Thankfully, she does not.
“Hilarious. Shut up Potter.” But he smiles benignly and lets it slide - “My mother first brought me here when I was five, as soon as I could fly on my own; she said the constellations were as good as a family tree; she said – don't laugh – that the stars were there so that we could never feel lonely.”
But he finds he does not have to say what he wants, because Draco is kissing him, lips soft and hot and hungry, like he, Harry, is the one thing he's not afraid to consume and if he can say
“It's not a good enough reason,” Narcissa says, knowing his explanation wihtout him having to say it. “You have to let go of the bigotry, Lucius, because if the remnants of those old prejudices are the only things holding you up then – then you deserve to fall.”
as he snaps at him one afternoon when trying to point this out, Harry giving him a face like he hates him again, grumping
an idiot,” Draco nods, leaning his head in so that their noses are touching, Harry thinks he will never feel anything in the world so tender as the tip of Draco's nose and he knows he's lost to this love forever. Or found.
They look at each other for a moment, and Harry feels his lips pull in a snort at the same time as he sees the wry smirk at the corner of Draco's mouth. He wants to kiss it, he always has. He wants to grab him right now and hold him so close he could never possibly get away. He wants to seize on to his scrap of starlight with everything he has and keep it close, keep him safe. He wants guarantees that everything will always be alright, that they will be forever, that nothing bad could possibly happen to either of them again. He wants too much and he knows it.
thanks Malfoy. You twat,” he adds affectionately, grinning - “You know what Harry? Your boyfriend's alright.”
Malfoy. Though it's a ridiculously tiny word for what he's feeling, has been feeling now for years, a twelve year old word. I mean of
were listening to me, weren't you Harry?” she wails, positively pleadingly. Harry is still only just sitting up in his sleeping bag on the floor, rubbing his eyes and yawning.
“Careful! If they see you at the window -” he trails off, shoves a hand in his pocket for the cloak that's always there -
night. Sometimes I'd wake up and she'd be there, sliding up the bed. I can't -” Harry takes a step towards him seeing the tears spring into his eyes - “I want to go back – to the Black House. I can't – how can I ever – Potter?”
“Yes, alright damn you, yes,” and Harry smiles again and shakes his head because he knew already, should have known long ago just like he should have known what his own feelings were, but it's like he hasn't aged since he was eleven – not in terms of emotional maturity anyway– they had to get old so fast that parts of them that should have grown up never had a chance to. It doesn't matter now; it feels like he has been given a reprieve, a chance at life and it feels – touching Draco, talking to Draco, loving Draco in the days that follow – as though he feels the same. In the end when they emerge from the bedroom they hide nothing, not smiles, not tenderness, not
it was beautiful, it was poetry, it was utterly stolen from Oscar Wilde but that didn't change any of the previous facts. Nobody ever said anything like that to him in his life, it makes him positively weak in the knees that it was Potter.
“NOW!” the others swinging round from all sides to form a circle around the Malfoys and Harry, wands drawn. When they apparate out, Draco clings so tightly to Harry's hand Harry thinks it will feel like splinching if he ever lets go.

to be melodramatic? On the other hand, he suspects this is so much more than a fleeting thing, that this bright, blanketing love will not die out with adulthood, that the odds against staying with one person forever are odds he could easily defy after battling and winning against so much else. If he
They troop down to the front hall and just stand there a moment - “Actually,” Draco says brightly, quite pleased with how successfully he is making it sound like he is Over Everything and Doing Fine - “Just over there is where I saved your life.”
“Why you -” Draco's eyes narrow in a flash of something half remembered, and for a split second George grins, just a kingfisher flash of a smile;
“Yeah, drop it Granger,” Pansy bounces up - “Like you don't have double the shenanigan potential of the rest of us.” She gazes at Viktor a little too wistfully, who smiles pleasantly back at her before she makes a garbled sound and breaks eye contact quickly.
He starts, in the corridor, hearing an echoing thump to the thump of his door and turning to see Draco march out with what looks like a similar level of decisiveness as he has just displayed himself. They look at each other, both frozen for a moment in each others headlights -
“His name's Teddy, he's Remus and Tonks'. He can change his hair like she can but he has kind eyes like Remus. Do you know who else has kind eyes?”
him, hates him intensely. It feels as though the world narrows to a spirally point at which nobody exists but the two of them, trying to kill each other with their eyes.
eyes darting round the room for danger. The second thing – the thing that stops him starting up – is the weight against him, an arm draped heavily across him, legs tangled up with his own. For a moment he loses track of whose limbs are whose, and yes, of where he ends and Harry begins.
“When you said I should be given to Voldemort. I'm sorry about how everyone else reacted. I wouldn't have – I mean – well shit – I gave myself to him half an hour later anyway, didn't I?”
Potter. Bloody sodding Potter – that's the thought that would have seen him dead the most quickly. It's also the reason he's alive, the reason he's
attractive.” The women stare at each other for a while, Andromeda clearly wondering if this is all of the truth or if by some miracle her sister is joking with her. She sees enough in Narcissa's face to answer her the former and she bursts out laughing.
“I agree with Luna,” Draco tries to nod, finding it trickier lying down than he had expected - “Sorry guys -” he cranes his neck over the sofa to indicate the adults. “We
But I believe it was a lie for which we can all be grateful. Is that -” Almost nervously, she indicates the quiet bundle in her sister's arms.
“A pain in the arse,” Ginny clarifies - “A knobhead. A mega dick. Honestly, I don't know how much clearer you need me to be. He won't shut up, keeps calling me names, singing that rude song about the turtle day and night and I swear to shit Georgie, every time Luna and I try to – I mean try to do
“Oh I'm just getting started. Really. I'm still trying to imagine anyone growing up here, it looks like a place to eat children, not raise them.”
“Hmm,” Hermione nods, thoughtfully, leaning back in her armchair - “Yes, I've been wondering about that.”
“I believe since shortly after breakfast. Not long, I am aware, but I felt it was worth you knowing.”
“To be honest -” George has thought about it too; he is surprised to find out how much Malfoy's thoughts could align to his own - “they don't even want us to
‘You’re welcome. I think maybe you should keep it hush hush for a bit though, we don’t want to upset the others, do we?’ She nodded seriously. ‘I have to find Teddy and head home sweetheart, but I’m sure I’ll see you very soon.’ Her shoulder dropped and he felt awful. ‘I know, but all good things come to an end sometime, to make way for the next big adventure.’ That seemed to pacify her.
He glanced down at Teddy and saw that the little boy’s face had also fallen. Well done Harry, scare the poor boy more.
‘Going somewhere?’ He asked she bushy hair sticking up from behind one of the boxes. Hermione’s head shot up in surprise.
Draco’s left hand let go of the wheel to reach for the gearstick when the car made a loud grinding noise. “What the fuck was that?!” Harry’s palms were sweating from a mixture of nerves and the inability to take control of the vehicle, which was veering off to the right while Draco shrieked.
But now there were papers strewn everywhere, some of which were from before he’d started coming here, and he couldn’t handle it any longer. He started with a stack of mail which had accidently been delivered to this address. The new owl he’d purchased he’d left behind in France in the furore that had been in incident and he’d simply assumed Spungen had been looking after her. He wasn’t really sure now.
a lie in!” snapped Hermione, who they notice for the first time is already dressed, has a cup of tea and is attacking her hair with a brush.
“Yeah right, like I could tell him that. I think you all forget how much I used to hate him. It's all just happened so fast, I'm only seventeen, Hermione, did you remember? Cause I'd sure as hell forgotten. It's too much – I can't -” he sighs enormously - “I can't suddenly tell him he's the world to me can I? He'd do a bloody runner.”
“Shut up Malfoy -” it comes out aggressive, almost angry, but it isn't anger, just lust, just need, just the fire rushing out of the chest and into Draco's mouth when Harry kisses him again, savage and demanding and needy. Draco's kiss back is as brutal a fight; and neither will ever win, he realises – both of them get it – almost at once in this kiss – that it never
“Sorry to disappoint you,” he murmurs - “I didn't want you dead, that's all. I didn't want – didn't want anyone dead – or hurt, and I'm -” his eyes skitter across the floor beneath them as though he can still hear the screams - “I'm sorry about what my aunt did to Granger. That was – gross. Sorry,” he says again, mumbling.
petrifies him for too many long seconds. Sometimes he cannot help but be spotted in this stupid fear. The first time it almost led to a row (“Why are you looking at me like that? All I said was -”
“It's nothing Malfoy, loosen your corset – I was just picturing the look on your father's face if I ever introduced him to my Uncle Vernon.”
Draco cries out and it shatters the room until Harry knows – if he did not before – that he does not have to stay quiet, and he can hear him self growling like a monster gone feral in the room, his hand is wet where Draco is thrusting into it, shaking and coming and crying and shuddering under him and he's breaking apart, bursting from the woods where he's gone feral and emptying himself into Draco's body half howling, half snarling for the exquisite brilliance of it.
“For the record -” Hermione says, grinning a suprisingly Slytherin smile as they head towards the Quidditch pitch at speed - “You meant Ron, of course?”
It's like a bloody bombshell, one that everyone else might have already seen land and in the debris of which he has been obliviously running for years. This is more than just lust. How had he never seen it before? How long had it been like this? In fact, only in the face of realising that it is more than lust can he acknowledge to himself that he
and half way safe. At least people keep saying he is safe – but it feels like a lie. Maybe it's just that it's too hard to believe, he has forgotten how to imagine it even. The only thought that sounds like it's really his own is
“With actual lying in?” Harry adds - “No offence, Hermione, but it's eight o'clock in the morning and we didn't sleep until four.”
bad, but mostly trying to compartmentalise his feelings. He's never been good at it; he feels like he's maybe always felt too many simultaneous enormous things to deal with, and in he end he always just explodes or fights with brief and sudden surrenders before settling back down into his churning scylla of whirling thought.
“Greedy -” Harry's hand on his hip, under his shirt, on his chest, another in the small of his back yanking him tight against him, they're both strong, both fierce, arrogance and hunger and years of flying and fighting making them hard and deadly in tension and strength - “bossy -” he yanks Draco against him, like a push but towards him, not away from him - “Bastard,” he finishes, cupping Draco's cock through his trousers and almost making him shriek.
“Draco,” Lucius says again, and he feels his weight on the side of the bed, hears the wood shift - “I know you're not asleep. Come out of there.”
no I can't do that. Sometimes I smell pictures though. But that's not magic Harry. It's a normal thing. Some muggles get it, too.”
“I keep thinking -” Draco says, not looking at George - “I keep thinking it has to get better. Everyone keeps saying it -” George nods, face scrunching up,
Draco's words feel like a wash of pure water through his core - “God yes. I never wanted to be different, you know. I never wanted praise for living, god anything but that, especially when so many have died. This
“Actually I never left” Percy gives a sweeping look around that indicates the whole of Hogwarts - “I mean – I have
“I know,” he says, because he does, he can recognise just about every one of Draco's nightmares by now, but Draco has to say it anyway, as though naming it is at least something he can do towards facing the fear -
“Amazing,” Pansy wheezes when Draco winds down and she has room and ability to breathe for laughing - “What
“Yeah well -” he looks away again, cringing from the brightness of admiration he can see in those green eyes - “I never did like for a thing to die. Not if I could help it.”
The letters were something of a surprise on several different levels. Not so much that McGonagall knew exactly who was living together – this apparently is a must have talent for any Hogwarts head – but that an eighth year was happening at all. Somehow – easily enough, perhaps, in the trauma and nightmare of their seventh year – they had all rather forgotten that they had none of them quite finished school, forgotten that they might still be children, in that respect, at least for maybe a year more. The letters catch them at a point where Hermione and Ron are visiting; somehow it seems obvious that they did, as though McGonagall would have known that too – and they all of them gather in the newly rainbow upstairs living room to discuss it, the children – if that's what they still get to be, sat around on the sofas and the adults perched around the corners, letting it be known that they are there for support but that the choice is up to the ones holding the letters.
“We're not – I mean – oh for fuck's sake -” Draco exhales heavily, looks up at the ceiling as if for patience, but also to stop his eyes from leaking, George knows the look - “Sometimes -” Draco whispers very fast and sudden - “Sometimes I think there
“You're not listening Hermione – I must have – I shouldn't have – I was too fast, wasn't I? I shouldn't have – I dunno – poured out my entire heart? Or I shouldn't have kissed him? At least one – maybe both? He fucking
“Uhhrrrr -” Harry's moans, head dropping forward towards solace on Hermione's shoulder, except she steps back sharply.
best made sentence and that her vocabulary would do well to catch up to being awake as quickly as she does.

eager to drama the fuck out and prepare for the worst. Because you're a moron and an utter utter twat.”
He gets up and stalks away almost immediately rather than wait for an answer, not sure what scares him more – being understood or
“Oh my -” Malfoy's hanger's on – Harry assumes they must be band members, producers and assorted team but Malfoy just makes everyone around him look like hangers on – have caught up to him by now, and are watching him and this exchange as though every word he utters is just poised to go down in history. “How we
“So why do it?” Potter asks, his voice gentler than Draco has maybe ever heard it – especially talking to
“Also I've decided – the bathroom is now off limits for angst, crying or otherwise brooding. New house rule. Okay?”
“Of all the awesome magical things we could be doing to usher in the new Millennium and you're all dragging me to some crummy muggle festivity -” he gripes happily.
“So when I get them off, I want the Order to be there to apparate all three of them back here before that can happen. What do you think?
was good at these things! She is also struggling because this still doesn't help her pinpoint Bill Weasley from the others. Fleur swears heavily in French – the cursing is surprisingly strong and at least breaks her spell a little -

to control himself around more. What a fucking mess. He groans, wrists resting floppily across his knees, banging the back of his head softly against the picture frame behind him.
sound of pitiful amusement when Harry sighs about it. Finally he tries to talk, to explain himself, he always feels as though he needs to explain, excuse, deny these moments -
“S'what Fred said. He asked me if I had actually made a joke – said I hadn't made once since I was – actually it was the last thing he ever said.”
“Yeah well,” George shrugs and adds the greatest compliment Harry thinks he could have had from anyone - “Fred would have said so too. C'mon you wankers, you can buy me a fire whiskey!”
Draco smiles; it comes out more tired than usual because it's a true one and he waves her away as he goes to his room. It's funny, he thinks, they weren't really like this in school – there for each other like they are now, too busy with their own failings and crushes – Pansy's was on
and every small sitting or drawing room he tries to dive into has at least two people who turn to stare at him and he has to run away from those terrible looks on their faces that imply they are going to try and speak to him, express their shitty delight at his appearance out of his room or ask him how he bloody bastard
“We all need to apologise, Miss Granger – all of my generation to all of yours – don't you -” if she had been anyone else she would have clasped the girl's hand. Instead she extends one hand a fraction and lets it hang - “Don't you miss
After the kiss several things happened very quickly. Firstly, he had looked up and there were Ron and Hermione, stood behind Draco, staring at the both of them in shock. He had just stared at them moronically for what felt like far too long, Draco as silent as if he had been stunned, watching him with what had looked like curiosity for what he would do about this, just about registering the dark mercurial flash in his eyes, the blush to his cheeks and the delicious slightly swollen, parted lips that begged him to just carry on kissing.
“Can I -?” though he's touching him already, sliding his hands under Draco's shirt, pulling him closer by the waistband, suddenly it's easy to say - “Need you. Please. It's been so long,”- so easy he wonders why he never did, wonders how he
She's not oblivious at all, of course- he has come to realise this about Ravenclaws; sneakier than Slytherins when they want to be, even Luna. He finds that he has started to catalogue in his head some of the things he has seen from the people around him under the guise of Helping Luna Spring Clean.
“None taken dearie.” She looks fondly at the boys as they join the group in the square by the lion statues; she pauses just on the verge of ruffling his hair, Harry pleading at her with his eyes not to,
I mean it really does make sense! I'm sorry Mrs Malfoy I don't think I can tell you what you want to hear.”
It all suddenly seems quite comically familiar, like he's twelve again and just about to hear that the Slyherins have booked the pitch in advance of them to train their new seeker. Only Flint's with them now and he
he stretches, yawns – thinks again how good the sleep felt – it's the first time – he realises with a shock – the first time he has slept without nightmares since he can remember. What a fucking cliché. He frowns, looks sideways – Potter –
They traipse through two more rooms of paintings, a long gallery that apparently was once – and is still very occasionally- used as an upper ballroom, another hallway full of sculpture and a music room that makes Harry have to fight hard not to say
“It's perfectly normal, Harry,” Hermione had said, seeming glad to be able to reassure him on this part if nothing else - “It's called synesthesia actually, seeing music as colour rather than sound. You can get it with all sorts of combinations of senses – like Luna said.”
“Hate you -” he mutters as he fucks him, because there is so much love in him right now he has to say it somehow - “Hate you I hate you, you disgust me -”
ever again. Draco closes his eyes and raises his eyebrows all at once, which is an expression Harry has never seen anyone else make, nor is he sure that anyone else
“Yes -” Draco shakes his head in despair at Harry's scattered thought processes, and now he can see faint smears of glitter and shine on his cheeks, in the corners of his eyes, silver shimmers out of his hair when he moves his head - “You didn't.”
“Harry and Draco are – still asleep,” Hermione finds herself apologising for them, despite it's being nine in the morning, ergo at least three hours before Draco usually emerges and fairly early for Harry - “Ah, here's Ron with tea!”
“Just – please – step away from the edge?” Harry's voice is tense; this is the last place he wants to be, the last place he ever wanted to come to again, the last thing he wants to be doing – alright then, the second to last thing. Coming back to school in the first place was decision enough without finding himself bloody well
“Yes -” there is more, there are words full of feeling that hover on Narcissa's lips, but they do not find their way out.
“Wendell and I couldn't have children. But we talked about it of course, what we'd call them – all of that – we always said that if we had a girl, we would call her Hermione. After
“Wow,” Harry says, intelligently when he finally finds a word. It's nowhere near good enough but he supposes he has to try.
“Look, I just wanted to say -” honestly he hadn't been sure what he wanted to say, just that she was Draco's friend and he found himself caring – to be fair he had not thought about it from the Luna perspective at all - “I agreed with you.”
to be selfish. So he listens as she explains in hushed tones that there's something going on between Draco and Harry that they don't even seem to realise is going on yet.
that now. I may as well get lost before she kicks me out anyway. That or the dungeons again, no thank you very much, uh – uh no way, like I say -”
He's still feeling pleasantly wrung out a minute later, stepping out of the shower and wrapping a towel round himself, feeling the warm wash of vague – if nowhere near quite enough – relief. All the same he lets out an actual shriek as the changing room door flies open and an unwelcomed pointy face peeks in, nose held even higher than usual.
sparkle and the one in the lead, striding towards Flint with more assurance and aggression than the rest – almost hurts Harry's eyes the way he catches the sun, some kind of glamour Harry reckons, lining him like silver like the edge of a cloud, a stream of silver chiffon billowing out behind him. He swaggers like the he thinks the floor owes him something for walking on it, and Harry wishes he could see better through that dazzle because he could swear to all the stars he only ever knew one person swagger like that and it sets the hairs on the back of his neck prickling – not unpleasantly, to hear that rather shrill voice insisting -
“Shut up, Malfoy.” Harry turns and Draco arches an eyebrow as Ginny pushes her way forward, all elbows and steam - “And maybe grow up?
“On the other hand we don't want to be back in separate dorm rooms, in different houses, unable to spend night times with the people we love do we?” Luna offers - “Not when we've been fucking all summer.”
“Oh what, like I've never been in here with half naked Quidditch players before? Don't flatter yourself.”
It would be so easy to go to him, to sink back into that bed with its memories now that tingle him delightfully and just carry on in this state of pleasure and calm broken only by passion. He swears internally –
to make the choice to fight them or not and yes alright, she admitted a lot of us would have chosen the Dark Lord's side but she said she wasn't going to judge that either, not after some of the things she saw – I think she meant

the last great fuck up in a long long line of stupid fuck ups. He thinks about the last kiss to the back of the neck Harry had given him just last night before he fell asleep, remembers calling him
much -” his words feel inadequate to his own ears, nowhere near enough to demonstrate a tenth of the the tight heat of wanting that coils in his chest, running down every nerve of him, deep beneath his skin, in the places Draco has
“Oh fuck off,” Draco spits, turns back to his door, remembers that his father is still in there and he cannot face him again and dithers long enough for Potter to
“I do not know,” Fleur does not sound much like she cares either - “I just found the letter. Since I was not looking for either boy I suppose it was not meant for me, so I am only reading it briefly.”
“Ahhh -” Draco raises an acerbic eyebrow accusingly at the mattress - “What a truly marvellous compromise”.
seems ridiculous. But then – perhaps it's pathetic, but it also feels as though without one particular person's approval, everything that just happened could be swept aside as meaningless. He wishes it was otherwise, but in vain.
and his palms are itchy – sweaty but the back of Draco's neck is so cool and he doesn't pull away when Harry curls his hand around it, in fact he stares at him with wide wondering eyes for mere seconds before they flutter closed and he utterly unintentionally moves his face towards Harry's. Harry's fingers – desperate to find whatever will still their shaking, cool this heat, brush the edge of Draco's jaw, butterfly brushing their way up his cheek, his thumb finding the edge of those lips and following that edge in wonderment. He wants to find the words to say how beautiful Draco is to him, how beautiful he's always been, words to wonder at how he came to be but instead he just leans in, failing to believe he is allowed this -
The memory of that panic, that fear shoots through him like a sudden nightmare, a flashback onto horror and his own sigh turns into a suddenly screamed -
Draco watches her for half a moment before nodding to himself as well, and striding straight over to Blaise who turns round from the sound system before he can speak -
The least human thing about Fleur, or so Bill has always said, is her abilty to get up bright and alert first thing in the morning. In fact, she does not seem to experience any of a normal person's transitional period between sleeping and waking. She simply wakes, blinks twice, stretches –
“Like drunk only stupid,” Luna adds - “What?” She shrugs when Pansy frowns at her - “Stoned is a state of mind, just think yourself into it if you really want to be.”
he says heavily, and to George's surprise he hugs him hugely. It's a very un- Percy thing to do but he can't say he hates it.
The truth is – and Draco has never been a huge fan of honesty, so any train of thought that starts this way is absolutely doubtless to end in grief – still, the truth is – he hadn't been expecting Potter. He cannot help but feel a little bit foolish – spending the last four years visualising what has always felt like an inevitable reunion, he never once imagiend that it would come
She waits, semi patiently, while she hears a grunting and shuffling coming towards the door and finally Harry opens it a few inches and peers out yawning, hair sticking out in all directions -
Yes, he was thinking about that and not the game when the Snitch was released. He was wondering why music, why glam rock –
“Sit down Potter, you look confused.” He sits down himself, back to the wall, and Potter frowns once and sits down beside him.
He groans out a sigh and pushes back the covers, glaring at his father. Just at that moment he discovers that he hates him – he would probably have hated anyone who disturbed him at that point. But this is his
Draco cannot control the jerk of his hips when he says it, the rub of their cocks so sweet, delicious and nowhere near enough, only rendering him weak enough to hear himself voice these silent prayers of so many years out loud.
“Shit,” he says to clarify, almost a question as he realises how it must have sounded to Draco, how Draco always misinterprets him so easily even at the best of times, how quick he is to doubt that he means anything to anyone, let alone Harry. He stares at Hermione helplessly for a second; she simply stares back with her eyebrows raised like it's obvious -
“-thank you,” Draco says stiffly, awkwardly, but with a curious quiver around the lips that suggests he means it deeply - “I won't. I hope -” he raises his head a little, pulling his chin up as though with a great effort - “I hope you – I hope it works out for you – you know.”
“It's the right word yes. I confess I find it hard to believe that someone like you could ever have felt themselves a failure.”
There seems to be more of a thought half formed at the end, and for a minute George thinks he is going to go on, but he doesn't. They all do this now then, trail off from their ideas, half-baked and lost, ghosts in their own skin.
“Yeah,” says Ron - “I don't get it mate – arent't we supposed to be rounding up Death Eaters, not rescuing them?”
“So -” she looks at Blaise challengingly, tosses her head like she's forgotten how short her hair is and puts her hands on her hips - “What did I miss?”
“Fuck -” Draco says from somewhere near the window, his voice growing tense again - “You were right, there's
the sunlight. That makes sense. His sunlight is glaring down at him with hands on hips and an expression of utter disgust.
understand, but she supposes she doesn't need to, purebloods and their riddles; yes, but they're still sisters after all, it seemed, and reconciliation can only be a good thing?
that. He had learnt so much more than Occulmency over the holidays – how to keeptears to himself, how to disconnect, how to start escaping himself so that all of it was happening to somebody else, so he wouldn't have to see his mother's mask of indifference when all her husband's failures were taken out on her son.
“Hell no – you were a dick. Besides being enemies was so much more fun, wasn't it? But we weren't enemies like that – you never wanted to use me or control me, you just wanted to piss me off and call me stupid shit – and you never cared about all that
Harry half runs, half walks up three flights of stairs, until he finds Hermione in the library, cursing at the books.
” Draco has to grab her by both arms as she tries to stalk off - “What did you say to me just last night? No cracks remember? You're not a coward are you?”
just anybody else - “Please just step down from there and let me talk to you. It's hard to think with you standing there -”
He turns and runs then, hurtling down the stairs just like last time, and he knows logically he can hear Potter shouting after him to wait but it sounds terribly like the after echo of
just want to help. God knows he hadn't dragged Dra – Malfoy in here with the express intent of a sodding make out session – had he? No, he hadn't, he tells himself this extremely firmly. He had meant it that he wanted to help. He knew Draco was hurt, that he'd been hurting for a long time and he had managed to fail to help him time and time again. Usually when he asked people how he could help them he got
It took him years to realise that he might even have done something wrong, how he could have failed to impress. A
too much too soon too fast, but he thinks perhaps it doesn't matter any more and if he can just wrap himself up in Draco's body it can be the thing that will heal him like he has needed for so much longer than he realised.
“Of course he doesn't know! I can't tell him! I have to be stronger than this don't I? For everyone. As bloody usual.”
“This is Teddy, um – it's a baby?” She wonders what it is about Luna that makes her start stating the unnecessarily obvious. Possibly an idea that Luna might actually not know.
and the sound makes Harry's head spin and he's beyond thinking, has to claim the body that arches beneath him, pushing back, offering himself up without being able to help it; he pushes in and it is so much more than just pleasure, though it's possible nothing has ever ever felt this good. He has to pause for a moment, buried deep inside, gritting his teeth to keep from coming in the instant. Bastard would never let him live it down if he did. He digs his fingers in at the juncture of hip and thigh, getting a spot which he remembers makes Draco scream – he tries not to, but it seeps from his anyway, a long stuttering cry – and he rocks gently into him at first, trying to get used to bliss, his breathing feeling
“I should -” they both say, then stop. Harry waves a hand for Draco to go on, Draco wishes he hadn't.
to be there every time now – because he could never let this boy cry alone in a bathroom again, even if the boy is nearing thirty. He's still such a child when he cries, it rips at the heart like a frantic creature scrabbling at him.
house – maybe she should clean it. Yes that could be a start – get rid of the fusty old portraits and creepy horror movie wallpaper – Luna loves muggle horror movies, they're so funny, she's been showing Ginny, late nights snuggled up on the sofa at the Burrow which is blissfully quiet these days with everybody else here. Anyway yes, the horror movie wallpaper and the ancient heaviness of Purebloods past. There's a musty great layer of oppression over everything in this place as well as the dust. That's that then; as soon as she's spoken to Harry she's going to start cleaning. Maybe speaking to Harry is cleaning too. Maybe she should ask him before she starts overhauling his house.
“Well – I mean someone succesful, beautiful if you like that sort of thing – well hang it all I'm not going to just sit here and compliment you!” he sneers a little - “You know you're perfect.”
Draco was just about to go running after Harry when he returned. He marched right up to the counter Draco was standing next to and put a vial of yellow potion down in the middle with a bit too much force. The contents splashed up against the seal and Draco watched anxiously as the surface rippled as the level settled.
When they landed just outside the house, Teddy caught them both in a hug, pushing them into each other and forcing Harry’s arm around Draco’s shoulders to keep them balanced.
It would be far-fetched to say that Draco was in love with Potter. How could he be when he’d never even been on the receiving end of one of his smiles? Or known what it was like to deserve his kindness. But he knew he had the capacity to love Potter, if such a thing had ever been on the cards.
‘Maybe?’ The tingle in his palm was gone as quickly as it had arrived, and he wasn’t sure he could do it again if he tried.
“I suppose I can't stop you.” Hermione puts her book down, and perches on a stool instead of settling back into the sofa. Narcissa waits for a gesture from the girl before taking a seat, noticing, when she eventually gets the gesture, that the girl does not take her left hand off her right arm.
Harry thinks, it probably did, the whole arm probably still hurts. Draco holds his left arm in his right hand, almost protectively across his chest.
The girls turn and start getting Quidditch balls out as the rest of the team turn their back on the glaring glam rockers, getting into position.
“Oh my dear, sweet fucking -” Draco pushes the hood down, all the better to really stare at him - “You
“Mm,” Molly needs - “The kids've been through so much, best to give them space, eh? My George, he -” her lip wobbles and she cannot finish.
improved his attitude immensely in the last few years, though at times like this it's hard to remember. Although, then again, in this case -
“Do you know,” Harry frowns. “Due to a sudden merciful fire you never did have to answer me about that.”
-”” from a subtle vantage point just a little down the hill, Pansy and Hermione watch as Draco and Harry tentatively begin to talk, unable to actually hear the words - ““
on that stage – like he's walking on starlight. The hot crystal of his voice and its dangerous, deeper undertow. Draco is a river that could cleanse him of every ill or drag him to his death and he aches with pride and hope thinking –
Because this time it's Harry who whimpers in his sleep and Draco who turns to hold on to him. Time and again back and forth this never ending stream of nightmare and comfort. Harry responds well to touch, settling into it like a cat into a stroke. Draco sighs, resting his cheek against the head which turns on the pillow, untameable hair tickling his nose and lips. He hears his own voice
Draco – on the Astronomy Tower that night – I know what you tried to do, what you couldn't do – I know why you tried and I know that you couldn't have and if I had not loved you before I think I might have loved you then, when you were your

like being drunk; he reaches what feels like a far too floppy arm for Draco, wanting - “You do the music.”
“Yes. She – well she didn't want to at first – but I told her how much you'd, well, changed and she said she'd see you, and she'd like to meet Draco – but she won't see Lucius; um – sorry.”
Next comes the twisting, jerking away from him, fighting with the sheets until the skin beneath Harry's fingers feels sweaty and shivering, as though the battle with the blankets is a losing one, inarticulate noises too that rise into a recognisable
Draco's mouth twists back into the old smile, the real one, not the sneer or the smirk, but the one from the boy who first offered to be friends; second name terms is always their code, as it it were, that things are alright again, the disdain with which they say them a humorous parody of what it once was.
“Her name is Hermione. I rather think you should. Talk to Draco, see what he can tell you. The Lovegood girl – she could spell it all out for you – how to live, how to change, how to be decent. I am
He stays standing there for some time, in the storage room, staring stupidly at the door as though it might actually reopen and Draco could come back in. It takes far longer for it to occur to him than it should that this is absoloutely
“I used to see Voldemort in my dreams -” Harry waves it away - “I saw you through his eyes. I saw you not wanting to do any of those things. I know what he would have done to you if you didn't. What he
“Oh, did you like it?” Molly beams, oblivious - “I never tried Slytherin colours before, you know, wasn't sure how it would work out!”
He hears himself whimper when Potter's hand slides up under his shirt, warm against his skin, a hand that moves on him so savagely he can imagine it digging through his skin, reaching between his ribs and yanking out his heart and he opens his mouth and is on the verge of whispering
Draco makes a grunting sound in agreement and is halfway out into the corridor before calling back -
struggling, he's just never kissed anyone so hard in his life, it feels like a battle. He remembers this – though it's been what, two years at least? He remembers it always feeling like a fight, always leaving him more satisfied than any other sensation he could imagine, or experience. He's so hungry – he had had no idea how desperate he was for this and he suspects the feeling's mutual but it is the first thing that has felt good in a long time and he kisses Potter like something feral might attack it's prey, like it's life saving, nourishing, necessary to exist. His hands are everywhere and it feels like they're pushing but they're not they're pulling closer like they could please, please inhabit the exact same space and there is a hand on the back of his neck, pinching at his skin and pulling at his hair and it makes his head spin and he's so hard, grinding it against the boy he hates in rage and urgency and need and it still feels like he could cry at any moment.
He finds himself having to grip onto his broom as though for dear life, swearing internally because dear gods he never expected Malfoy to sound like
beautiful, so pale and almost shining; he wants to touch everwhere, kiss every inch of skin, but he can't, not now - he needs to be inside him far far too badly. He casts his eyes wildly around the room, not really wanting to tear them away for a second, panicking when he doesn't instantly find what he wants -
George finds he knows how the kid feels so hard he stands up, approaches the sofa, nearly sits down, realises Draco is sat on the right and he can't sit down on the left so he bites his lip and jerks his head -
“It's been a year,” she begins and after they have called Hermione's father down and reversed the spell on him, she sits down with them both and relates as best she can the events of the past year leading up to where they are now and her deciding to do this for Hermione.
Hermione nods, rolling her eyes and shaking her head, and then the doorbell rings and her parents are there and they can finally all smile for her as well.
“I saw Draco rescue a spider from a leaky tap once,” Luna informs them vaguely, and slowly everyone leaves, leaving Harry awkwardly alone with Ginny, Ron and Hermione tactfully excusing themselves and hurrying into the next room.
“I think what I wanted to say – what I wish you to know – is that yes, you feel like nobody is as bad as you, nobody has ever, hmmm – sucked so hard? But I did, I felt that way before I met Bill, but he got me back on the feet again. Now I know yes, I am lousy champion, but I am learning – from Bill – to be a better person; without him I might have been, I do not know – apathetic as to which side to take in the war? But I am choosing and I am fighting – if it was the right choice, this was more by luck than anything else – and who I had around me. You also, chose based on circumstance and options and the people around you. This is not defining you. Do you see?”
“Yeah.” Harry stops in the corridor, students all around them - “I did. It's just – ah, I dunno Hermione - he didn't say it back, did he? For all I know, he hates me – more than ever after – after -” he makes a helpless flap of the hand and starts walking away down the corridor, Hermione trotting after him, sick of this.
She grins. He grins. He thanks all the powers that they have managed to return to this – what they should always have been really – friends. After the break the first year had been difficult, but since they started flying for rival teams it's gotten better. Since finding out Gin now flew for The Harpies in more ways than one, it's got better still. Everything's felt like it could be mending – if only a little since he started flying again himself, since quitting the Aurors and joining The Wasps – now more than ever, he nods internally at the good decision that had been.
sometimes he has felt as though the title mocked him, inherently blaming him for all those who hadn't.
There had been a certain dreadful peace to it, a kind of contentment – most of all, it had been absolutely true. It had seemed to him then that this was all his life had ever been for, that
And here he is now, stuck in a stupid cupboard because it's better than going out and facing the world.
“Right,” he says, but he still utterly fails to take the offered arm. In the end Draco has to grab his arm and slip it under his. He tries not to think about the warmth of Draco's body against his, the feel of that arm beneath his hand. He focuses only on remembering not to squeeze or stroke – even then he suspects he did something wrong, because Draco arches an eyebrow at him, flickers him the ghost of a wry grin -
Fleur swears, rolls her eyes and sits down in the bedroom chair simultaneously - “You are so in love it is ridiculous,” she sighs - “I think I am seeing why my lure does not work here, you cannot even feel it. All you see is
Now, lying here, Draco's head on his shoulder, curled into him, not quite asleep but drifting happily, he feels awash with horror at how ready he had been. To have died then, and never felt again – to experience nothing more, because there
“'Cause surrendering me to anyone who wants a piece of me -” he cannot believe they're joking about this but apparantly they are and it feels brilliant.
“Look, we'll go again after lunch,” Flint sighs - “Take the rest of the morning to get a grip Potter, work it out and come back ready to play this time, not – look never mind, just sort it out okay?”
“Because Blaise is a useless bloody arse and forgot that our stage effects could be done with smoke and glamour?”
“You wouldn't,” Draco drawls, draped across the majority of their sofa, head on Potter's knee, repeatedly poking it and wriggling and positioning Luna's squishy cushions against said knee to try and make it into a more comfortable pillow - “I bet you thought
“Just put the bloody thing on and check out the window, Malfoy,” he grumbles - “- and shut up while we're at it.”
“Anyway – sure about that are you? Here I am, merrily interfering with a couple of ladies' love life and I hear there's you – wandering the old Black house like a ghost, aren't you Georgie?”
He never saw it coming. Perhaps when your whole world falls apart so hard you never do, never could, even if all the warning signs should have been obvious, stacking themselves up over the years. Somehow you're falling before you ever knew you'd slipped, gone from glory to helplessness in seconds and you're crying in a bathroom like the miserable wretch you never thought you could be.
So they're alright. Lucius will be alright – perhaps she thinks this second with a mite less certainty but it seems at least like a possibility. She collects herself again, and nods and apparates out.
“Ugh -” Draco drags both hands down his face, as though ironing it out. “My fault. Obviously. I -” he makes an expression and heaves a sigh that says he only just realised this part - “I fucked up.” He sags - “I should -”
“It was -” Luna wanders in - “Draco just stormed out the front door. He looked really miserable, Harry.” She says this so accusingly he has to ask -
his own voice, in retrospect so weak, so insincere. All illusion that he had any choices in the world, any kind of power or strength, had died that night with Dumbledore. Senses, memories, all roll around inside him like a House of Horror ride that he cannot get off – he can see the voices, hear the green, taste the skitter of Dumbledore's wand across the stone. It occurs to Draco that one does not necessarily experience memory with the correct senses. None of it makes sense, and all of it is just one big sensation like threads of a spider's web closing in on him in one big prison. Why come up here? Why? Like the nightmares of that night weren't enough, reliving the sick horror of realising what he'd let into the school, thinking about what he had been sure/ not sure at all he was going to do – imagining taking a life, saying those acid green words
Draco rolls his eyes; he's already holding a little green glass bottle out between his fingers, and for a brief flash of a moment Harry thinks of snakes and gardens and apples. He takes the bottle, frowns at it -
“I suppose a gendered insult is a small price to pay for a genuine apology from an unapologetic toss bag,” Blaise shrugs, slapping Draco on the arm.
He hears Luna's voice as though she's been trying to reach him for a long time. It's only on hearing it that he finds himself registering that the music has stopped, like the loss of it was too much to bear all at once and he's still just standing there staring at the ghost of sound, staring up at Draco on the stage with the cello in front of him, his coat fanned around him like a skirt, and he's frowning down at Harry with an expression Harry cannot read. In Harry's head, for a shockingly vivid moment that probably goes on for far too long, he puts the instrument down, drops down from the stage and turns his face to Harry, eyes glittering and lips a little parted and Harry kisses him right there with the music swirling red and gold in a fire rainbow around them.
And they're laughing breathlessly, messily, half crying with the relief of it as the winds around them fall still.
Draco's lip curls; whether he means the disgust or not, it's a gesture well practised enough to come naturally and his eyes flash for a second with something that makes Harry think
Draco had said, and it felt to Harry as though those words had freed him, exonerated him and taken the pressure away.
Harry has ever heard, but then considering some of the things he had to say about it Christmas day, he supposes he should be grateful.
Harry? That's literally why I asked? You've not been yourself these last few days, maybe a bit longer, and I think it's since we started planning for next term – is it something to do with that?”
Because he's gotten ahead! Damn it! Harry kicks his broomstick as though it has been a truculent horse, even though he has been the one getting distracted, and he races forward to catch up. They can never not be at least a little bit competitive, even now, even in fun, always especially when flying.
“In the bath – I wondered if any amount of washing could get it off – then I couldn't stop – still can't – like – if I scratch off enough skin would it come off then? It can't go all the way down to the bone – can it?”
“I don't know -” he begins apologetically, though his cock apparantly does and is pressing itself against Draco's opening without knowing what's best for it. Draco gives an impatient groan and leans half over the edge of the bed to rummage in a bedside drawer, wondering if enough impatience and technically knowing what to do will make up for his having no more of a clue than Harry. He twists round to hand Harry the bottle -
because he needs to be so much anyway, even though he hardly knows what to do but Draco is a tide and he is caught in it and it's move this way or be dragged under. Draco shivers out of his trousers like a snake shaking off its skin and he's pulling Harry hard against every inch of his nakedness and there's no option in the world but to drag his own clothes off and swim in that tide. Draco turns, pushing himself into the wall, arching his body back in offering, twisting his head to try and see Harry at the same time and Harry can hardly

trying not to be a dick quite so much, whereas if Lucius is being less offensive it is not necessarily by choice.
“Shut up Potter, I was ten. He was my favourite, had one tail feather that kept growing green – every time father would pull it out so he didn't
elderflower cordial,” he sulks, sipping it, actually gulping it. It's good and he was thirsty. It's too hot for late October and the flames Blaise is now having put out across the pitch haven't helped.
“Don't apologise -” Narcissa makes a minute brushing gesture and sighs. “We are all sorry about Lucius.” She does not say that she has tried speaking to her husband so many times over the past few days, but that he reacts like a man in another world, one he does not know his way around. He has said he does not know the world he finds himself in, that he cannot keep up with it. Twenty times a day he says
Instinct again had sent him running the instant he had found out otherwise, running to throw Potter his wand because nobody else would know he was unarmed, nobody else could even react quickly enough, and then there was no choice but to leave, his mother screaming at them, dragging them away. He had been almost certain of death every minute from then on – from Voldemort before he knew he had been defeated, and then from the Ministry when they had come calling.
be ready. One day, all of a sudden they're in Madam Malkin's getting fitted for eighth year robes – which are
And so, taken altogether, in the end the feeling that prevails the most when he thinks of Draco is one of frustration.
wish I was Fred, you know. Or you, or Gin. Or Bill or Charlie. Sometimes even Ron. These days, a lot Ron. You all don't know how how lucky you were – are -” he gives a deep sigh - “
that was it,” Flint rolls his eyes as though he knows something Harry doesn't and he catches Ginny's eye for a quick second before she sighs and shakes her head, looking away again quickly to hide an expression just as knowing. He really doesn't know what they're all on about, and it does not make him feel any less irritated.
“Thank you Malfoy.” Ron and Draco both snort at the sight of their fathers doing a brief hand shake of solidarity.
“I concur,” Draco agrees, looking round. “This place is great. Just what the Wizarding World needs right now.”
“Everything changes,” she says simply, and realises as she says it how true it is. It had not occurred to her, in seeking to help Hermione, to think about whether or not she and Draco were friends and is surprised to find herself more selfless than she realised.
Hermione suddenly can't cope – at least not over anything she may have just said. Of course, they're all not coping, the people in this house; this is the house of not coping. Maybe Ron's coping and then she and Gin are remarkably okay but that's why they're not here, in the healing house. Actually, she thinks, as she makes her way up the stairs, footsteps creaking as she goes – it's not a very
“I'd already lost one sister. I could not bear to lose another.” Narcissa says it almost without emotion but Hermione notices Andromeda's eyebrows raise in surprise - “Until I could. We had – not agreed on a vital point- perhaps more than one.”
he says, though he has to explain that one – kisses him on the cheek, and bounces out of bed. No bed hair for her, she wakes up gleaming and groomed. Not like him who has to groan and struggle to remember how his limbs work – although to be honest it's been easier in the last couple of years, his senses sharped, his alertness less human itself.
“It's been so long,” Narcissa murmurs, taking a few steps down the hall, looking about her in wonder. For a moment she looks quite shockingly young, a small girl's light coming into her eyes.

“Yeah, sure Malfoy. I go and get a permanent tattoo of something like this just to take the piss. Absolutely, you tosser,” - though he says it affectionately, even (especially) the
Draco looks back at him and his eyes are so big, so searching, a heartbreaking flicker of hope gleaming like a star in their depths -
“- but I did it because I wanted to. Because – well – you need help, alright. We all need help, don't we? You and Harry most of all, because if something can be fixed it
“I'm Luna,” she says helpfully. “Luna Lovegood. I was in your dungeon for half a year. It wasn't very nice, but it's it's alright now. You don't have to speak to me if you don't want to. I'm looking for Harry Potter. You have a very nice wife and child. Goodbye.”
being rude, even sarcastic; she quite likes it. “Hate to break your bubble, but I'm really incredibly gay.”
“I want -” it's not quite true, but it's the truest thing he can admit to - “I want to not be here. This whole – whole circle jerk of comfort? A house of fucked up people trying to talk each other better? It's not for me. It might be good for Weasleys – good for mother, I don't know. But I just – I just -” his chin wobbles and he feels suddenly very small, painfully young, like a boy who would like his mother here right now please and thank you very much - “I just want to go home.”
is next, a two second dip in the lights apparently being enough for Draco to disappear and reappear with a complete change of costume – a silver variant on what he was wearing that morning. It's angry, but not as angry as
“That – as you said to me about Mr Potter – is because you don't know him. I have suspected for a long time now that your friend is the only thing – the only
“In my last year at school, yes, when we were at Hogwarts, the boys, they were fourteen I think. Always they are looking at each other, always – like they are – how do you say? Magnetic? But they do not see it, they only know they must be close and it is making them angry – always so close to fighting, but it is not fighting they would like the most.”
she shrugs apologetically - “But Harry really, it's actually quite terribly obvious you know, whatever it is -”
He gulps. For just a split second his brain did not hear the sarcasm, for just a moment he lets his face betray him that maybe it bloody well was, and in that moment of facial betrayal Draco's eyes go wide at the possibility that his sarcasm might actually have hit home.
“A pleasure,” Viktor takes his hand and shakes it enthusiastically - “I know your music of course. This song
“Obviously for the run up to and for headlining the as yet un-named celebratory week Potter, same as you.”
“Fuck you -” Draco whispers, almost crying because it does, self preservation scattered to the winds - “ - yes, yes it's good, you bastard – please -”
“Love me,” Draco orders, something like confidence creeping back into his voice for the first time in so long and it sounds like this is something he has always wanted to say, hiding the honesty of it all this time beneath a supercilious arrogant attempt to impress - “Want me. Worship me -” he makes a moment of sharp eye contact that asks Harry if this is going too far, and when he finds nothing in Harry's eyes but a willingness, nay, desperation, to do exactly this he smiles, crookedly, and adds - “- but touch me while you do it because
He can feel terror behind his own eyes, straining through his head as he stares fixedly at Harry's face, wondering if he

“She asked me if Draco was still alive; she did it when I said yes – I think by that stage she just wanted to save him.”
“She's sort of with the Order – well, not with us, but linked enough. Turns out she was family enough to get in.”
After the last few days working on the books with her, Hermione had, at that point finally got up the courage to mention Andromeda, and

that tomorrow and it'll be okay. He -” she stops herself from talking with an actual hand to her mouth. She had been about to say
Harry chokes back laughter and shock – he has never seen Walburga beam before, and thinking about it – he rather wishes he never had.
His face feels scourged by the stinging September wind, and he shivers, wanting warmth, wanting balance, wanting this answer desperately for all he makes it sound as though he doesn't.
“Ughh,” Harry groans, looking at Luna properly for the first time and trying to smile. Well that's something at least. “All this time I used to think
but they can all hear it in his voice, as though the ghosts of his parents, Sirius, Remus and the others are ranged around the room with the other adults watching.
He takes another step forward. If he had his wand he would have magicked him to move back; they would have been fighting up and down the length of the bathroom by now. But he doesn't, and Potter's too close now, in his space; in the past this always led to furious, beautiful fumblings in broom closets and empty classrooms – but they're not stupid kids any more, and fuck knows where this can go now. He can read confusion all over Potter's face, uncertainty, anger – he wants to hurt him, yell at him, but now he's unsure of it because Draco's crying and there's something else, of course there is, there has always been something else. It hangs in the air between them, so thick you could cut it. His chest heaves with it, wants it, wants to lean in at the same time Potter does but when Potter's hand does reach to Draco's face he flinches, and it feels natural and ugh god when did
Draco scoffed. ‘What, you think I’m going to tell you everything without knowing that? Are you a fool?’ He was being mean again, but what did he expect? Draco was a Slytherin after all, he knew all about self-preservation.
“Are you feeling ok?” He asked her with a half laugh, though he couldn’t see her because he kept his eyes closed.
‘Harry?’ Draco asked him quietly. He was facing away from him and in the darkness, it was impossible for Draco to see his face.
‘Don’t you dare make comments on the state of my marriage. That’s none of your business.’ He spat icily.
‘A psychotic episode.’ He whispered. He bit his lip as it started to tremble, and he wished more than anything that the floor would swallow him whole.
‘You can’t tell anyone this, the Ministry is trying to keep it quiet, but you remember Kingsley’s secretary?’ Draco thought about it. He remembered the young woman who couldn’t tell her arse from her elbow who’d been in place when he’d worked here.
“Oh for heaven’s sake!” Pansy burst out. “You Gryffindors always make things so difficult! Tell him the rest, would you? Before he implodes.” Pansy fidgeted in her seat and Draco’s stomach sunk to the floor. She has that familiar maniacal look in her eyes that told him there was a terrible plan afoot.
“Can I help you gentlemen?” Draco asked politely. He didn’t look Pansy’s way, but he could tell she was tense. The room had stilled unnaturally as the two wizards tried, and failed, to stare Draco down.
The pain was quite literally blinding. It seems to get worse with each second as his pain receptors continued to fire and the sensation flared. He unceremoniously batted the crazy animal away and curled into the foetal position on the bed, biting his lip so hard to keep from crying out that he drew blood.
Harry has never heard Draco talk this way. It’s not as if he doesn’t have feelings per se, it’s just that the Malfoy family as a whole isn’t especially expressive. In fact, for the first six months Harry was partnered with Draco’s twin Orion, he was convinced the guy didn’t like him at all. Then he found out Orion actually volunteered Harry’s name for promotion, even though it would split their partnership up. Slytherins. They’re impossible.
‘Alright. But you promise you’ll floo call me if the slightest thing happens, and you won’t use any of the kitchen appliances?’ He really wasn’t sure about this, but Teddy was nodding furiously, and he supposed he would have to do it eventually. ‘Then I suppose I could. Only for an hour though. It’s a trial run.’
Harry scrubbed his hands down his face with frustration. “And it’s always you in my dreams! You always lead me to Draco, but you can’t even tell me why! Who is he? Why is he so important?” It was a fruitless, a one-sided conversation, but since he had woken up something had changed for Harry. It was no longer a case of
‘I can’t tell you that Draco. What I can tell you that there’s a man out there who loves you more than he loves life itself, and a little boy who thinks you’re his world, and if you love them too all you have to do is let them in.’ Draco thought of Harry. How he’d felt that morning after their little get-together after Teddy went to school. He should’ve known when he hadn’t jumped straight out of the bed and left and proceeded to cry himself to sleep in Harry’s arms, that his decision had already been made.
He didn’t recognise the street they were on. It looked like an alley, but slightly wider than Knockturn and not as open as Diagon. Perhaps they were somewhere in muggle London. He stood behind Harry and felt a surge of jealousy when he noticed Harry’s hair was mussed in a way Draco recognised from all the mornings they’d woken up together.
After a few minutes there was a scraping of furniture and a click of a lock. He wanted to push the door open and swoop right in, but he knew he had to let her come to him. He waited patiently as the shuffling inside stopped and the door creaked open slowly, revealing a little girl with swollen, red eyes and tangled hair. He was so shocked his heart nearly skipped a beat.
Harry didn’t stop until they were out of the cathedral and stood by the river. There weren’t as many people loitering around since it was still cold outside.
‘Ella has just been telling me about the books she got for Christmas.’ Daphne told him. ‘Come on then missy, you’re done. Go and sit on that chair over there and we can talk about what we’re going to do with this beautiful hair of yours.’ Ella squealed with delight and bounded off towards one of the styling chairs.
‘I’m not playing games, Potter. I’m on the verge of getting you the evidence you need to prove the clinic is involved in this damn case and to be honest the sooner this case is solved the better. We’ve been monitoring Hopkirk and Runcorn for weeks now and we’ve still got no tangible evidence to link them to the case.’ Draco’s fuse was very short at the minute and Harry had always known how to get under his skin.
Every single muscle in his body tensed when he saw the first ripple of dark cloak. The stench of decay made him gag and he turned away from the cell door to no avail. Even without looking at the dementors it was impossible not to know they were there. Draco could see his breath clouding around him as the temperature plummeted, the warmth being sucked out of the atmosphere the same way it was sucked out of him.
‘No. This isn’t your problem to deal with. You should go to school and talk to your friends and study for your lessons and have fun and just be a child. The war is over and I’m not a death eater and no one gets to use any of that against you.’ He didn’t know why he never thought about what his own reputation would do to Teddy. It had been somewhat improved because of Harry, but ever since they’d divorced it had naturally returned to what it was before. It shouldn’t be anything to do with Teddy. Draco had to deal with his own mistakes, no one else should have to do it for him.
It had started gentle, just the lightest brush of their lips, but it was quickly becoming something more. It felt like a wave had broken and was washing over the two of them, unleashing years of anger and resentment but also admiration and longing. So much longing. It’s possible Harry could have drowned in that kiss, if Malfoy hadn’t pulled away from him. The idea of what might happen next terrified him, but when she did pull away, she grinned at him with a smile so bright it could have blinded him, and he wouldn’t have cared one iota.
It was difficult to keep his head up. The ground was cold underneath him and the wall damp against his back, but it was already too dark to see much of the inside of his cell, and he was too exhausted and shivery to move. His chin fell against his chest and he held back a sob. This was not the way things were meant to go. It was impossible to tell how long he sat there, his head pounding and his thoughts whirring, but at some point, he must have fallen asleep.
Draco sucked in great lungfuls of air as he stumbled away from the pensieve. His heart was pounding, and his body was shaking. He realised now, now that he was getting better and he’d had time to come to terms with himself, that he hadn’t been protecting Harry from anything. He’d been lying.
‘You stole from me.’ Draco said flatly. He was furious. Did Harry have any idea how many days he’d set Draco back because he’d been a dose short.
‘Did she like it?’ Teddy asked him when he eventually found him upstairs. Draco nodded but couldn’t reply properly since the stairs had hit him hard. He was so over feeling like he couldn’t do anything for himself anymore. He wasn’t even 30 yet and he already heaved his way up the stairs like he was 75.
So that was how Harry ended up sitting upstairs in Luna’s house, in the guest bedroom which had become Malfoy’s, watching her write out a letter to a certain Remus Lupin. It was a relatively plain room with pale grey walls and blue bedding, but there were dreamcatchers hung up at the windows in a myriad of colours and there were piles of paperback books overflowing the shelves. Most of them looked read, but some were clearly brand new and stacked neatly in the corner. All muggle. Malfoy sat at a small desk with a sheet of writing paper and a fountain pen filled with dark blue ink. It took a good five minutes for Harry to get his brain wrapped around the concept of a Malfoy using a pen over a quill.
“Potter- Harry. I know we haven’t exactly seen eye-to-eye in the past, but you should know that we will support you in this. I mean,
Draco had nearly made his way to the lifts when a firm hand clamped down on his shoulder. He wheeled around, his wand out ready to defend himself, only to find Harry standing entirely too close.
“Very well then. If you’re done with your tea, I will take you to the library. But under no circumstances are you to be left alone with the manuscripts. Not only are you woefully unequipped to deal with the cataloguing system, I guarantee you have no clue what to look for.”
‘Six months. Just wait it out six months. I swear you can do all the planning and organising you need in that time, but don’t leave for six months. Can you do that, for me?’ He thinks about it.
Pansy came to sit on the piano stool with him. Usually he hated it when she did that but today, he didn’t have the heart to turf her out. “Draco, before you go, would you play for me…?” She rested her chin on his shoulder and looked up at him with puppy eyes.
“I don’t get it,” Ron said bluntly. Harry sighed. He had known it would be a long shot, and now he had exposed his growing madness to everyone who was important to him. But then, an idea formed in his mind.
‘I- yes. I should’ve talked it all out with you instead of writing it in a book, I know that now.’ He looked at Harry pleadingly, hoping he wouldn’t be offended. Instead, Harry gave him a gentle smile.
Getting caught up in the moment, Draco edged down onto the small gap between Potter and the edge of the cushion. His body was small enough for the fox to curl up right in front of his face, although he wasn’t sure he was quite that daring. He wanted to sit right there all night; finally able to get this close without fear of taking a hex to the chest or worse. Potter could be quite fierce when conscious, but asleep…
‘And take one of your FUCKING POTIONS.’ Harry yelled. He slammed the second mug down on the counter so hard it cracked straight up the middle. Draco flinched.
“Are you really here to help me or do you just want to make sure I’m miserable?” She pursed her lips.
‘I didn’t know you knew so much about this stuff. I didn’t even know you were interested. It’s…nice, seeing you come into your own again. A lot more interesting than the window in my opinion.’ Draco felt he’s cheeks burn with embarrassment.
Draco spend the next few weeks visiting the chateau daily, helping Spungen repair the internal fixtures and the subsidence. He spent hours trawling the narrow-cobbled back streets of wizard Paris, looking for books on architectural charms. He repaired the cracks in the ceilings, the damp on the walls, he reattached chandeliers and high-vaulted curtain rails. He learned specialist restorations charms for the portraits, carefully siphoning off layers of dust and debris without damaging the structure of the paint beneath. He re-varnished the frames and replaced their hangings.
After a couple of minutes, he has a brain wave. “Can I have caput draconis?” He turns his head to find Harry staring at him. “What?”
‘Draco?’ A groggy voice called across the living room. Draco slipped his bookmark into the trashy muggle novel he’d been reading as Teddy appeared next to him.
“You just don’t understand, Potter. Hummus is life.” No, Harry didn’t understand, but what made matters worse was the frankly indecent sight of Draco licking hummus off his fingers. Even though it should have been disgusting, seeing Draco’s tongue moving like that made Harry’s mouth go dry.
“Alright, alright! If you would just stop squirming, I could get you out!” Harry said to the moving crumple of stiff curtain. The screaming only got louder, and Harry wished he had brought his wand with him, even though taking his wand to the bathroom wasn’t exactly something he was in the habit of doing.
with me?’ Her voice was so small and broken he just wanted to scoop her up in his arms and promise her the earth, but he refrained.
‘What was the big emergency?’ He asked, pushing aside the voices in his head telling him to scream accusations until his throat was raw and his voice hoarse.
‘This is great Draco, maybe the adrenaline brought out your magic! You should talk to your healer about it as soon as possible. Fascinating…’
He kissed Pansy on both cheeks as they parted ways, with promises of coming back here once he’d made the place structurally sound again so she could begin her designing. He thought she could use something to occupy her spare time. She was of course highly busy with whatever it was she was doing in Dubai of course, but reading between the lines Draco was sure much of what she told him what somewhat embellished. Twice now she’d taken last minute trips to visit him. The Pansy of five years ago would never have had the time to drop everything with no notice at all. He wasn’t oblivious. Still, she was ever the proud Slytherin.
Remus looked shabbier than ever. Harry didn’t know what he’d been up to since the last battle when he’d disappeared off to the Ministry and hadn’t returned. The letter he had sent hadn’t proffered any information, but whatever it was it didn’t seem to be doing his health much good. His clothes looked as though they’d been darned ten times over and even then, the cuffs and the collar of his jacket were ragged and frayed. The tension in the air was thick as Sirius and Remus regarded each other, then Harry and Lyra. Harry wasn’t sure exactly how long it had been since they last saw each other but he imagined it had been quite a while. Despite Remus’s ragged appearance, he walked like a man who’d recently had a heavy burden lifted from his shoulders. Harry sincerely hoped that were true.
“You have no idea what this is like.” Draco hisses at him. Harry doesn’t like the tone at all, but Draco stops his pacing to come right up in Harry’s face. “You’re an only child. You have no concept of what it’s like to have your heart living outside of your body. Because that’s what it’s like you know, having a twin.”
‘Don’t thank me. I love you and I want to do this. I’m just glad you’re still ok. I promised you I wouldn’t lose you again and I meant it.’ Draco just couldn’t bring himself to say it back, despite the tidal wave of feelings he was feeling towards him. He couldn’t and he wouldn’t say it until he knew Harry deserved to hear it. It didn’t stop him from pressing his lips right above Harry’s heart. Such was the mess that was their relationship. He felt more at peace as he fell asleep than he had in months, and he couldn’t decide why that was.
Harry’s face was flushed with embarrassment when they parted – Draco had been right. Coming back to himself, he looked around the room and found Teddy studiously examining another pile of presents and pretending he hadn’t seen a thing. Bless his heart of gold.
“No it wasn’t!” He exclaimed, probably too quickly. “People should get to hear you. It would be a crime to keep talent like that hidden.” It seemed important to tell her that. It didn’t matter that they weren’t yet friends or that at one point in time he had thought he hated her, right now all that mattered was that she saw in herself what he saw in her.
‘He decided having a secretary wasn’t working for him. He’s been making a lot of changes to the way the executive office works recently. He’s upgraded the role to a PA instead and-’
Draco was up and dressed long before Harry the next morning. He had a lot to do. He made some bacon and toast for himself and left some for Harry under a cover Harry had left a permanent warming charm on, with a note telling him all was fine, and he’d see him later. He floo’d to the orphanage before the children were awake and helped with making their breakfast too. There was a decent team of staff in place, but it was still touch and go a lot of the time. They hadn’t wanted to get catering staff in and give the kids too much of a life of luxury, but as it happened a lot of them were still too young to be in a kitchen and they were yet to find an appropriate cook.
“Ohhhhh,” Draco sighs, his concern that Harry had at least temporarily gone barmy abating with understanding - “Really? You have that? What colours am I?”
and tainted. He wants to break his way out of his own body, smashing everything around him on the way out.
“No I think she just -” Draco says out loud, “- worries about me,” at the same time as she says “- worries about you,” and they raise eyebrows at each other for a second and almost smile. Draco dumps the shoulder bag and sits down in the desk chair with a sigh -
“Don't be a dick, Malfoy. You have no idea. I already died, remember? And to be honest, it was the best few minutes I'd had all that year. You try waking up to find fifty of your friends dead and knowing that it's all your fault -”
“So if you've no more essays to write -” Draco holds out his right arm as though offering it to a lady for a stroll. Harry stares at the arm as though it has injured him.
next, sometimes it goes on for a long time and Harry bears it because he gets it, because he has heard his own soul scream like that enough times himself. Sometimes, after all, this all goes the other way around, but not as often. He's been building walls against the things that hurt him since he can remember; Draco hasn't. He's made himself hard in so many ways with all those walls; Draco hasn't. He simultaneously finds it adorable and despairs at his beloved's fragility. It does not matter; love, he has come to reason, is not a series of weights and measures, not when it goes both ways- it is not a balancing act, it is what the other needs when they need it, what each cannot help but to give, in the end it always evens out, no matter what.
Anyway, he doesn't get to sleep with the window open; Draco prefers it closed and he'll grumble if it's otherwise, and, as more or less per usual he gets his own way, just like he got his own way about the light they leave on in the hall all night because he
know it yet. And he does not give her more and that's alright, she just lets him cry and does not dream of telling him not to or claiming that anything is alright.
“You could probably charge about twenty quid a visit, get the English Heritage in, turnstile at the front door, gift shop in the lobby, over priced tea towels, the lot -”
“I figured something out -” Harry sighs; after all, he's been waiting three years to say this - “The evening after the battle of Hogwarts. You
Harry looks at him sideways, suspecting that this is in fact Malfoy for being actually quite pleased to be invited and positively Looking Forward To It. The fact that Draco then stretches out across the sofa with his head in Harry's lap as he continues to grumble also confirms this theory.
“The first duty in life -” Draco recites, looking at his hand resting on the window ledge - “Is to perfect a pose, what the second duty is -”
That was the rest of it, it slips out of him when he leans in for a kiss, half embarrassed because it is different this time, this time there's moonlight on the bed and a boy who's not a boy any more, who will always be a boy, just like he will, and he's a part of the moonlight and Harry is a part of the candlelight and they mix silver and gold into each other, haloed in a light that does not really exist.
it just to stay alive, and when Draco makes no move to object – indeed moves almost impercptibly into him, tilting his head up just the faintest fraction, he falls into him with fierce hunger, not simply kissing him but seizing hold of him as he does like he's a life raft in a storm, swearing as his glasses fall down his face and chucking them off heedlessly. There is nothing sharp about Draco when he's here, in his arms; he is simple softness and light, melting like a pool of warm sunlight, insubstantial as a moonbeam; Harry cannot shake the notion that it's like holding starlight in his arms, that he needs to hold on tight, hands moving everywhere, fast and hard or all that glttering sweetness will just melt away like light leaving a deluminator. He wants to touch Draco everywhere, take possession of him with his hands – he never had anything like this before – he never had anything much before – he can feel how possessive he could get so violently it frightens him and he breaks off with a great gasp for breath.
“I -” he says, but he doesn't know what he wants to say, just that his head is still ringing with a panorama of sound and the colours – he half wants to clutch on to Luna to stay standing – he never saw anything like it. It occurs to him like he's watching himself do it that he's crying. He's not sure for how long he has been, but Luna, when she notices, just nods as though she understands and he's glad it's her, not any of the others.
“Oh please. Death Eater, remember? The worst?” the words are soaked in bitterness; he half thrusts out his left arm as a reminder, reaches a hand to push back the sleeve but stops suddenly, clenches his fists tight and prays Potter won't notice.
He finds himself looking beseechingly across the sofa as though Harry actually could have an answer to this, but all he can say is a very soft -
He waits for a day he knows Draco is going to be gone the whole day, visiting his mother for a shopping day in London actually – which Harry finds quite deeply adorable – a
“Everything,” George echoes dully. “Even me. Yeah.” He stares off into the mid space for a while, absently. It's easier like this, he finds, to absent himself. He wonders where he goes when his brain goes out like this. He wonders if Fred's there. Something tickles the back of his mind, he remembers – that was it – he was having a conversation – with Hermione Granger. Something about Harry and Draco Malfoy, yeah, that was it. Was she waiting on him for an answr? He wracks his brain, trying to remember what they had been saying. Had she even asked a question? Shit.
So many moments, drawing together through the house like shimmering ribbons around a bag half embroidered. Draco laughing at Fleur for her feather duster and apron, asking her if she has any little forest friends who want to help her clean – a result of Harry's introducing them all to Disney movies – and by connection to television in general, much to Arthur's extreme delight.
It wasn't what Harry had expected to hear himself say either, even though he had been ready to only minutes before. He still finds himself breathless, shocked to have said it just like that. He supposes that if he had thought at all he would have assumed he'd be another three years at least dithering about it, getting frustrated by it and constantly semi – convincing himself that it wasn't true after all. He never thought it would come out like that, so matter of fact, but in truth it has been a matter of fact this whole time and everyone else has known it too.
“Oh fuck off-” He's talking more to himself than to Potter, trying to snark away the prickling feeling behind the eyes – how did he manage to hold back tears so sucessfully every time he had to over the last two years, but now he's just a sodding waterfall? Like Potter might be safe to cry in front of, where the Dark Lord wasn't? He has to remind himself otherwise quite fiercely - “Fuck off, Potter, this isn't a pity party”.
“Everything?” Potter breathes, holding the back of his head, pushing himself as close as he can to Draco given the shitty angle they're at.
to take more than a bit of weird, off kilter music and a voice like molten stardust to throw him off like this. He kicks the ground in annoyance. Flying has always been such a release, a time when he can let go of the responsibility of being anything else other than bloody good at what he's doing. The very sensation of it – sliding into the air like diving into a river – has always refreshed him, calmed him and felt as though it was cleaning out his head. Now his brain feels clogged up and swirling with thoughts like a rainbow in a penseive. The last thing in the world he needs right now is to hear a mocking voice calling -
he'd been waiting his whole life. He rocks forward and can feel how hard Potter is under him, how fucking big he must be beneath his trousers, and he knows as he feels it that Potter must be feeling him too and one more rock will brush their cocks together and he'll probably fucking come just from that. His head falls back, eyes closed in bliss as he offers up his neck for the kissing. He doesn't even need to offer, it is taken anyway, hot lips on his throat and just the hint of teeth. He can hear his own breath coming out in gasps, echoing round the awful stone walls. He heard his own breathing here once before, just as loud but it was panicked then, like a frightened animal facing down death, and that was crazy when you thought about it, because wasn't he the one threatening death?
He never threw a punch before. It's like a lightning bolt hitting him, flooding him with shock and guilt and a fizzing kind of delight. Also – he shakes his hand, wincing -
“It's like I'm reaching out a hand to him over and over again and he never takes it, not even in my dreams. I can't believe I just told you all of that – I hardly even know you – I mean that is we're not – I don't even
from Lord Voldemort if nothing else, thank god for that little bit of her capacity to internalise that she had managed to pass to him.
“Maybe I wake him up,” she shrugs, standing. She peers across the corridor to where two women are hugging, at least one of them crying, in the opposite drawing room.
“I do.” It sounds to Harry like a marriage vow. Draco swears softly and closes his eyes for headiness, reeling back into the kiss like the first one had just been a taste, one that had made him hungrier for more, and he can't stop once he's started, can't control his movements, his need for this; it's not like a dream this time, not like this morning, it's visceral and rough and angry and mean, like one of them could still turn this into a punch up at any moment and it's
“Yeah right, like I could tell him that. I think you all forget how much I used to hate him. It's all just happened so fast, I'm only seventeen, Hermione, did you remember? Cause I'd sure as hell forgotten. It's too much – I can't -”
