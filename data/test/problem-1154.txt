They made it all the way to the edge of the forbidden forest before Draco took his hand. Everything was a blur after that. There were trembling bodies and breaths not breathed; there were hands fisted in soft jumpers and fingers carding through hair and lips—oh, there were lips on lips, and it was unbearable, that sensation. It was pleasure, bright and cutting like a knife, and Harry thought he might die from it. Minutes passed, hours perhaps. Above them, the star-speckled sky shone softly like hope.
It might start earlier than that, if I’m honest. Several days earlier. It might start with the newspaper article. I don’t read it, of course. I never do. But still, it goes like this:
“You didn’t tell me he would be funny,” she whispers loudly at him before turning back to Harry and clearing her throat.
Each word is like a blow, straight to your face, and you can feel the copper-salt taste of blood on your teeth. You feel tears, heavy-hot behind your eyes. Shame, too. Of course, Malfoy’s right. Of course. Malfoy sees straight through you, to the darkest parts, the parts you need to keep buried and never think of again. Malfoy knows that he’s struck a nerve with his words: you can tell from the glint in his eyes and from the shape of his scissor-sharp smile. It fills your stomach with liquid-cold fear until nausea wraps its green fingers around your throat and you feel like you’re drowning. You can’t let those parts of you see the light of day again, you can’t. You need to go home to Ginny, you need to take her soft hands in yours, and you need to make her smile, and you need to be happy with this life, with just this life, with this lovely girl and your lovely home. You need to remember it’s everything you ever wanted, it’s everything you survived the war for (and not bone-sharp shoulders, not stubble-rough chins, not comet-blond hair.)
Harry is led through endless corridors and into a large, airy room with dove-grey walls and antique golden oak furniture. There are flowing white curtains and two beige sofas arranged around a low table on which a bouquet of fresh lilies sit. It does not look anything like the Manor here remembered, where everything was dark and overwrought. Mrs Malfoy is still smiling as she gestures for Harry to sit.
Just as I push myself to my feet and prepare to go back to work, I feel the skin of my calf heat up.
“My father.” Her reply is sharp and stinging like a whip. I write it down too and add a question mark.
I’d take your cock in my hand while you stroked me. I’d learn the hardness of it, the softness of it, too. I’d commit it all to memory. And as I come, I’d tell you that I love you. That I’ve loved you for a while. That I don’t think I've ever loved anyone as much as I love you.
The next morning, Draco’s already spent most of the morning at the house when Harry arrives. There was a meeting with the historical building committee he needed to attend. He presented his plans for the renovation, and some people on the committee brought him archive pictures of how the
That’s a hard question. I think I have, but I didn’t know it at the time. The family I grew up in, they wouldn’t have approved of the boy I had feelings for. Because he was a boy, and for other reasons too. And you’ve got to understand how important it was to me that I pleased my family, then. It was the most significant thing in the world. It sounds silly now that I’m not a child anymore, but for the longest time, I was taught that family was all that I had, and all I’d ever have, and that if I didn’t live up to their expectations, I wouldn’t have anything anymore. So I never admitted I had feelings for the boy, not to anyone and especially not to myself. Might have been just as well, really. I don’t think he thought very highly of me. I would likely just have embarrassed myself.
Draco lets out a pained whimper at the sound of his name and licks a wet stripe along Harry’s collar bone without slowing the punishing motion of his hands, inexorable and pleasure-quick.
“I can’t really explain in a way that doesn’t make me sound crazy.” She pauses and laughs, dry and hollow. It sounds like nerves and exhaustion. “And Merlin forbid I sound crazy in front of an Auror, lest he dismisses my case entirely.”
Your body is electric and fight-ready, every cell is awake and alive and screaming underneath your skin with want and need. A dreadful sense of loss, too. The sound goes straight to your spine and spreads, deadly and flammable as lighter fluid, to every inch of your body. It seeps into your bloodstream, and you need something to happen, suddenly. You need to turn yourself inside out, you need to claw at your stomach with fingernails and finger bones, you need to scream at the sky and cry out the ocean you’ve been keeping inside you for longer than you remember.
“Nothing! I’m not going to do anything, Iris! I can’t! Don’t you think I asked him to stay? Don’t you think I begged? He asked me to let him go. He said I hurt him enough already. What was I supposed to do?”
I add. Then, I read it again and cringe. “So much for not being a gothic heroine”, I tell the krup with a broken leg that’s curled up on my bed. “Merlin, I sound like such a mental case.”
When you see Malfoy, it is a punch to the gut. He’s sitting at a table, and the low light of the pub is making his hair glow like liquid gold. His eyes shimmer like quicksilver. You remember that you hate him.
The rain is dripping into Harry’s eyes, and his hands are slippery and cold and he runs them over his neck. He is frozen to the bone, and he pretends it’s the weather that’s sending chills running over his skin. (Not Draco. Not Draco.)
“I think I still love you, Harry.” Draco’s face is inches away from Harry’s now, and Harry catalogues the soft eyelashes, the alabaster skin and the quicksilver eyes. Everything in that face is beauty and pain all at once, like diving in the arctic ocean or staring at the sun, and Harry knows he loves Draco too. That he has loved him through years and continents and hasn’t ever stopped, not for a single second.
Draco keeps on crying, sobs wracking his slender shoulders. Harry does not know what to do with himself, or about it, or at all, really.
He steps away. You tighten your fist until your fingernails dig into your palms. You think only of the pain in your hand and not of that in his eyes. You’re not gay, you remind yourself, and you need to be clear with him if this is going to work out. Establish boundaries. That’s what people do, isn’t it?
You lose yourself in the motion of fucking Draco until your body is made out of light and you feel the pleasure rolling down the mountain slopes of your chest like an avalanche. You’re holding him, and you’re calling out his name, and he’s matching every thrust of your hip, whispering dirty come-ons ionto your naked skin.
too much, it’s entirely too much, and Harry thinks he’ll die with the overwhelming sensation of it, but Draco whimpers and cries out Harry’s name every time Harry moves just so,
After that, we seem to settle into a comfortable routine. We take turns asking each other questions. One a day has become our unspoken rule. We write it early in the morning, and we usually wait until evening to discuss it. It feels nice. Familiar. Some nights, when I undress, I stare at myself in the mirror and contemplate his handwriting crawling on my skin with a warm feeling behind my ribs.
The softness of your words, or perhaps the meaning of them, surprises Pansy. She stops rubbing at the bridge of her nose with stress-headache fingers and looks at you. For the first time, her black eyes are filled with silence, and not with judgment or annoyance at all.
And when you finally push the door of your flat open, you undress in calm, deliberate motions, and you take a shower. The water does not burn you. You do not punch the tiled wall. You do not even scream or cry. You decide you’ll never see Draco again and you don’t feel a thing.
Let us think, dear reader, about what it means for these two men to cross paths at that instant in time. One is desperately in love and spends a solid hour or five every day staring through the window at the object of his affection. The other is also desperately in love, albeit in a very different way. The other doesn’t feel like he’s worthy of affection or attention at all, so love turns his heart into a painful pincushion, turns his skin into Armenian paper and his bones into chalk.
It becomes a regular thing, after that. He shows up at your door. You meet up at ministry functions, in shitty hotel rooms (but not in his home, never in his home). You trade barbs, you fuck each other, you never stay the night and you never talk about it. And it’s fine, it is, why wouldn’t it be? It’s just sex, after all. People do it all the time. It doesn’t have to mean anything.
“I don’t think we’re working out, Draco and I,” he sobbed into her hair as she drew him into a tight hug, her face full of concern.
Harry barely lasted six months until he decided he needed a change of scenery again. Luna was in Iceland, at the time, looking for an imaginary animal or other and suggested Harry join her. Harry did, and he spent weeks traipsing through volcanic rocks and along jagged cliffs above the sea. Then, as surely as he did the first time, he grew restless again.
It is not exactly a lie, about not being a Muggle-born. Besides I imagine the second day you’re talking to a boy is a bit too early for a detailed exposé about your abusive family.
“That’s fucked up,” Ron says, in a strangled kind of voice. As he hands me my beer, I catch his eyes, briefly. Worry is written plainly on his face.
Behind the mountains, the sun is slowly starting to set and the last rays of it are setting fire to every wall. The sight of it is breathtaking.
It’ll all be worth it because you’ll forever love him, with every single inch of your being, so when he tells you he wants you, he’s wanted you for longer than he can remember, you answer, “You have me. You have me for as long as you want.”
“I’m glad you’re here too, Draco. I’m glad we’re doing this together,” Harry replies, and it’s every bit as beautiful as he promised Draco it would be, once, on a rock by the sea. It’s every bit as warm with affection and blinding bright with happiness, and there are still days when Harry thinks he might burst with the intensity of the love that lives in his chest.
He lets you, and you take an armful of him. You touch him, and you hold him, and you pour everything that you feel into the contact of your skins.
Sometimes, after Draco leaves, you take showers so hot they scald your skin, the burn-red caress of boiling water erasing all the evidence Draco bit your neck and scratched your back. It hurts, the water coming into contact with your skin. You tense your muscles. You don’t move. You let the pain bite into your flesh. And if you cry? No one can tell.
The interview was a disaster, of course, and the papers are dripping with drivel about you and Nicholas, about your perfect romance and how much you deserve a man who makes you happy. Draco must have read it, you know, and Draco must have believed it, too. He’s broken, when you see him, the way the face of a cliff is broken when sheets of it crash down into the ocean below. It’s a deafening kind of broken.
I like to think it is possible, yes. I don’t think it comes naturally, though. I think you need to make the conscious decision, every day, to be honest with someone. We’re always going to want to lie. Sometimes, it’s because we’ve done something wrong. Sometimes, it’s because we’re ashamed or embarrassed. Sometimes, it’s because we want to spare the other person’s feelings or because we don’t want to bother them with our problems. I think you’ve got to be careful with the truth, but you’ve also got to be careful with lies, or they end up taking over your entire life and you can’t talk honestly anymore. I think I’d like a relationship with as much honesty as kindness will permit. It is healthy for some people to have a secret garden and some couples don’t need to tell each other everything, but I’ve grown up with too many lies and too many half-truths and I’ve promised myself to stop lying when I left my family behind.
, where Björn Bottlebottom describes the use of the spell in rural Herefordshire in the following terms:
“He’s in Sweden,” she answers in a soft voice. “A place called Marstrand. He always goes there when he’s not doing well. There’s something about the sea, I think. Something that always makes him feel better.”
Sometimes, after Draco leaves, you’d give anything for him to walk back through the door, cradle you in his arms and kiss your hair. Sometimes, after Draco leaves, the emptiness in your chest crushes your lungs and ruptures your spleen, and you collapse to the floor in a panicked, choking heap.
I am not. Since the war, it’s been easier to use Muggle things, though. Fewer memories associated with them, I guess.
So what becomes of Jemima, you ask? Well, reader, if you were to visit Jemima in, say, a year, you’d find her in a field in the Andes. She’d be wearing a pair of corduroy overalls and bright yellow wellies. Her hair would be long, flowing down her back, and she’d be carefully feeding a bottle of milk to a young orphaned Mooncalf. Rest assured, reader, that she is happy in this new life of hers, far away from burning streets and illegal extensions and report forms. And rest assured that the other protagonists of this story are happy too, as they learn to live and love and trust and to not set anything on fire.
Really, it’s not that Harry ever meant to buy a sanatorium, but the mountains were breathtaking in the cool February air, dressed in white like brides or shroud-wrapped bodies, glittering in the late-afternoon sun, tall and silent and austere. And when Harry saw this house, sitting on a hill, nestled against the steep slopes how could he not fall in love? It was a thing of beauty, all sharp art deco lines and large glass conservatories, an impossible shipwreck in the middle of an alpine valley. On the beige facade, red letters read: “Le Rosaire.”
Draco rubs his neck, naked and glorious amongst the satin sheets. And how can you not be in love when he’s this beautiful?
This chapter got away from me and is a bit heavier than I intended. Warning for mentions of death & grief and for discussion of Pansy's trauma. Be safe.
Harry exhales softly, sitting back on his heels and letting his fingers fall to his lap. They sit in silence on the too-cold floor for a while as they try to make sense of the sadness in their chests and of all the pin-cushion words in their throat.
“Getting desperate, Potter?” he taunts as you close the door behind him. “With your fame, I’d imagine witches would be all over you. Maybe you can’t get it up with them, mmh? Is that the problem, Potter?”
Wait. Let us stop here, reader. Can you feel it? This is the moment where everything finally falls into place. Come. Look closely. Look at the way Harry’s eyes widen almost imperceptibly as he realises he’s been in love with Draco for longer than he remembers, look at the way his mouth hangs open and empty of words. And look, reader, look at Draco’s face, too. Look at the soft light of hope behind his eyes, look at his careful armour of distance fissuring like ice shelves in the summer.
I know you won’t open this letter. I don’t even know why I keep writing. Hope, I imagine. Stupid, stupid hope. Love, too. So much love. Love really does make fools out of us.
“I’ve talked with the ghosts,” Draco says as Harry leans against the balustrade next to him. “Mrs Brodard is every bit as awful as Iris said she was, but I don’t think they’ll be a problem. They’re all rather excited to have living people in the house again, and they’re relieved they get to stay.”
I don’t know, and yes. That’s how you’re supposed to know who your soulmate is. Don’t worry, though, the writing fades after a day or so.
When Jemima Graves, Ministry Official and Qualified Specialist in Architecture Legality Assessment is called to the scene, her report goes thusly: “George Weasley did not mean to invent the exploding extension, and Harry Potter did not mean to set it up. It is all a big misunderstanding, and I have been assured it will not happen again.” There is a note spellotaped to the bottom of the page, requiring a new set of official ministry robes on the grounds of hers being charred black and burned to a crisp in several areas.
I step through the Floo immediately, only too happy at the prospect of delaying the inevitable moment I will need to fall asleep,  coffee cup left sitting cold and forgotten on the kitchen table.
When their bodies crash together, it is beautiful and inexorable, like waves against rocks; they kiss like they’re drowning, violent and desperate, with grabbing hands and halting breaths.
Iris’ voice is firm and matter-of-fact. Harry does not open his eyes, does not lift his head from the soft, dark wood of the pew.
Instead of dwelling on it, Harry treads slowly through the meandering street and breathes in lungfuls of iodine and lilac. There is a blocky castle sitting atop a hill, and Harry strolls along its ancient bulwarks, staring at the sea in the distance. He realises he doesn’t have the first idea on how to find Draco, but it’s only noon yet, and how difficult can it be to find someone on an island, after all?
“C’est pas qu’on voudrait pas le vendre,” a man in green wellies told Harry, leaning against his tractor, “mais il va falloir des garanties, vous comprenez? C’est une partie de l’histoire du coin, notre Paquebot. Faudrait pas qu’il soit dénaturé, voyez?”
“I’m glad you came back. I’m glad you made good on your promises to fix the place. You really had me worried, you know? What were you thinking, leaving this idiot to mope all alone in the chapel? How on earth did you ever think he was going to do anything useful on his own?” she adds, jutting her head towards Harry.
Still, when I drop the glamour, I have to push all the words through my teeth when I tell him about the dreams. I don’t want to leave anything out, in case it turns out to be important, so I make myself go through everything: the forest and the sea and the white lab, the way he looked at me, and the way he talked to me. The kisses. The sex, too. By the time I’m done, I feel nauseous and exhausted.
He asks me this less than one week before we’re due to finally end this… arrangement we have. It’s not his first question of the day; I woke up in the morning to a short line on my ankle asking me what my favourite subject in school was.
It’s the only thing you can think of. You grab his wrist and tighten your fingers around it. Your joints hurt. You want to squeeze more. You want to hurt him. You want to bring him down and make him sob, you want to ruin him and break him and make him forget how you moaned and whimpered under his fingertips.
And, just like that, there was hope, growing brighter and brighter inside your chest, until you turned into a lighthouse.
(You can’t be gay, because you know, deep down, that behind the masks of the saviour and golden boy, beneath the fragile veneer of glory and fame, under the weight of medals and dress robes—you’re still a freak. And you can’t stand the thought of anyone else knowing it but you.)
“Excuse me, gentlemen,” Jemima Graves says after a while. “There are some forms I need you to fill in if you don’t mind.”
“You remember me, right? Aaron Woodbridge? Used to play chaser for Ravenclaw when you were in Second Year?”
“I’m so sorry I hurt you,” you continue, “I know I’ve kept you at arm’s length because I was afraid, Draco, I was terrified. Of what it meant that I could never stay away from you, that I always sought you out. I tried to tell myself that it was just out of curiosity, but…”
There were the times when Draco took his time taking Harry apart too, with his fingers and tongue. He’d be gentle, then. Reverent. He’d lick and caress every inch of skin, unbearably slow and bone-shatteringly careful, whispering words of affirmation all the while (
“Look, Potter. I’m not going to coddle you, here. You’ve hurt him. You’ve been hurting him for months, and I can’t even begin to tell you how many times I’ve begged him to just walk away from you. You’re very distraught now that he’s gone, of course, but how do I know you’re not going to go straight back to hurting him the minute he comes back?”
“What do you mean, you bought a house?” Draco asks, his eyes like sea glass (unknowable and smooth. Unbearably gorgeous too.)
No identifying questions, remember? Also, even if I knew him, I don’t think I’d want to tell you about him. With all that’s been said and written about him, I think it’s high time the boy gets a bit of privacy, don’t you?
Draco’s face is unreadable and still like a granite cliff (but Harry is the waves, is the sea—there is desire enough inside him to wear the stone down.) When Draco finally speaks, his words are hard and sharp, with no softness around the edges:
Harry smiles and thanks her as he walks on, slowly. Iris floats gently beside him. Draco trails slightly behind.
I let the nib of my pen rest again the paper, immobile, for a little while. I want to argue that he deserves love and forgiveness, but I know him well enough by now to know he doesn't take kindly to be told he deserves anything at all. So instead, I write:
You aren't entirely sure how it happens, but you are sure that it happens and it’s all that matters because Draco's mouth is on yours, soft and sweet and impossibly warm. You kiss him, and you kiss him, and you kiss him, and this is it, isn't it? This is what the poets write about, this is what the singers sing about. This is everything humanity has been celebrating since the beginning of time, and it's glorious, and you've only just come to understand why.
(He doesn’t need to know that you watched him sleep and, in the soft, silent darkness, pretended you were good enough for him to love you. Doesn’t need to know the awful feelings spilling inside your chest, choking you with shame and unbearable desire for what you can never have.)
Ron waves his wand in the general direction of the kitchen and summons three bottles of beer from the fridge. He uncaps one for Hermione who grabs it with a grateful “thank you” and takes a long drink before she answers.
The quote goes on for a boring quarter of a boring page and this is the point where I can’t take it anymore.
Her voice light and matter-of-fact as though she were talking of the weather, but there is steel in her spine and, as she opens a small cabinet and takes out an ornate crystal bottle, her fingers clench around the glass so tightly that her knuckles turn white.
I’m never as honest as when I talk to you. I’m usually a pretty guarded person. I find it difficult to open up, I guess. I feel comfortable with you. And it feels good. I think I’d like honesty in a relationship too. I think I’d like to make the conscious choice to share. I like the idea of deciding to trust the person I love, over and over again, with all the important things in my life. Is it silly that I think about you as one of the people who knows me the most completely? You don’t even know what I look like. I could be ugly. Even if I’m not, I could be the complete opposite of what you find attractive. Maybe I’m not at all your type.
I end up promising Pansy that I’ll look into that apothecary if nothing else. I know I shouldn’t because new cases should be run by my boss, but thinking about Draco’s death has never caused me to make a single good decision in my life so I tell her I’ll see what I can do. She stands up brisk and businesslike, wiping the smudged traces of wet mascara from her cheeks, and she shakes my hand.
“I was going to tell him I love him, and I’m afraid I was going to be extremely persistent about it until he agreed to have me.”
“You shouldn’t be expected to, Harry. It’s not right. This whole rotten thing never was, can’t you see? They were adults and you were a child, you should never have been expected to put yourself at risk to save them.”
Then, when I’ve quite finished feeling sorry for myself, I resolve not to let him run away from me. I take my journal out of my pocket and decisively walk back to room 50, sheepishly smiling at the old ladies as I walk past them again.
you wordlessly tell him with every whimper and every moan. You watch him come, and it’s the most beautiful thing you’ve ever seen.
“I’m going to the bathroom,” he says, draping the sheets around him and getting out of bed, “and when I get back, either you’ll have your shit together, or you’ll be gone, understood?”
You nod. You don’t thank her. You don’t think she’d take kindly to it if you did. Instead, you tell her about the interview on the radio that Lee is letting you do. You just want Draco to hear it, you say, just that, and you’ll let him make his choice once he knows the truth.
But if Draco were a different person, reader, it’d be a different story. It may be lucky then that Draco only knows how to be himself, just as Harry only knows to set things on fire, just as Jemima Graves only knows to do her job when everything is burning down around her. And so, reader, because everyone only knows how to be themselves, things aren’t different and our story unfolds. Slow. Strange. Beautiful.
“I was so scared I had fucked it up completely,” you add because the words crowding your mouth want to spill out and because you’ve lied quite enough for an entire lifetime.
Then, the door opens and a blond figure is standing in the doorway, and Harry’s heart stops for an instant.
“Please,” Harry acquiesce. Then, he lets out a brittle little laugh. “I think we all needed to build ourselves anew after the war,” he says, perhaps more to himself than to his interlocutor.
whispered into hair or soft skin. (The blade-glint hope cuts deep gashes into Harry’s skin at the thought.)
“I don’t… I don’t and I do at the same time... I remember some of it...” Pansy withdraws her hand from mine and buries her fingers between her knees in a nervous motion. “Have you ever had those dreams that you can’t remember entirely? Like there are entire chunks missing from the story, and it’s right there at the edge of your brain but you can’t seem to ever remember them? That’s how I feel about the last two years.”
Theodore is not at all the person I remember from school. He’s dressed in a healer robe that’s seen better days, his hair gathered in a messy bun at the back of his neck. He looks overworked and worried, not at all rich, or posh, or self-assured. For a reason I don’t quite understand, perhaps because he reminds me how much we’ve all changed since the end of the war, I instantly feel a little more at ease.
When Harry steps into the deserted streets of the town, the sky is still dark and stretching the bright jewels of its stars above him. He walks: past the port and across the beach and on the small earth paths amidst the Queen Anne’s lace and the maritime oak. There is a dash-dash-dash glow of the lighthouse in the distance, guiding ships safely to port. Harry lets it guide its footsteps too. (I
The witch does not smile at me. “Shh,” she hisses, a tattooed finger pressed over her blood-red lips. Then: “Come in”. She points me to a Muggle-looking plastic garden chair in the middle of the corridor. “Sit,” she orders before she leaves.
Who wrote this? Were they being paid by the word? Were they even trying to speak English? My brain hurts from trying to figure out the meaning of the sentences and I feel like I haven’t learned anything useful. I thumb through the book. The chapter is sixteen pages long and I immediately decide I’d rather die without ever breaking the spell than read it to an end. I let the book drop to the floor and sprawl dramatically on the sofa.
“I love him too,” you repeat, “and I’m ashamed it took me so long to be able to say it out loud. I’ve never been this in love with someone in my entire life, Pansy. And I can’t bear the thought of losing him. And it’s been awful what we’ve had. It’s been broken and full of anger and lies, and it’s left me empty and hollow some nights. But it’s still the best thing I’ve ever had. It was brilliant and exhilarating because it was him, Pansy, because there is no one else in the entire world I’d rather have. And I’d go through it again without as much as a second thought if I had to make that choice again because the fact that it was him—it made it all worthwhile.”
Inside Harry’s chest, everything is fragile and crumbling like chalk or old clay with every word. Harry ignores it. It’s just that he needs to fix that house. (It’s not Draco. It’s not. Not anymore.)
“Can I?” Draco asks, tugging at the band of Harry’s trousers. The lightning in Harry’s chest spreads to his limbs and throat and mouth. He does not give a coherent answer. He throws his head back, instead and whispers Draco’s name like a mantra or a prayer until Draco’s fingers are on him, gentle and tender and reverent. It is pitiful, how broken he sounds. How needy. How hollow. He tries to keep the desire behind the vault of his ribs, but it is too bright, too vast, and entirely too much. There is not enough space in Harry’s lightning-storm body to hold in exactly how much he wants Draco in that instant, how much he craves his ruinous touch, his match-stick gaze. He can’t move. He can’t. So he stands still, leaning against the bark. Want-frozen. Shame-cheeked.
She rummages through her small handbag (smooth charcoal leather,  posh and expensive) until she finds a torn piece of paper that she sets on the desk and pushes towards me.
Charming. This morning, my skin was inquiring about my mental health but it appears it’s moved on to judging me now. I toss the parchment aside.
Draco doesn’t say anything, but he stops and turns around. When Harry feels the soft, familiar magic of a gentle drying charm wash over his skin, he resists the urge to close his eyes, even though it feels like cashmere and Earl Grey tea (like lilacs in a vase in front of an open window.)
“—it’s no use thinking about it, he’s gone now,” Harry bites out. In his words: a barely contained rage at the universe for letting him have the love he’s craved his entire life before taking it away for good, for letting him heal only to tear him apart again.
“You don’t owe them anything,” Draco drawled when Harry told him. There was a cold kind of fire in his eye, something that reminded Harry of ancient descriptions of hell. “It’s not like they care about everything you had to sacrifice to save them the rest of the year.”
I’ve been getting carried away and falling in love, but I don’t get to do those mundane things, do I? Because as soon as he sees me, I’ll be Harry Potter again. I’ll be the hero and the saviour, and he’ll forget all about the anonymous boy leaving chicken scratch words on his skin. I take out my journal, hoping he’ll see my words.
Inside Harry's chest, his heart is a lighthouse (on fire.) He’s alive, and he’s burning, and he finds that he can’t tell the difference between both these things. (Perhaps he never could.)
Draco, are you going to be pestering my girlfriend every time your ex shows up at your door? I’m not averse to it, but if you are, I will be having a word with Harry. We need to work out a schedule for his lovelorn break-downs so Pansy and I can go out on dates without a flurry of owls losing feathers all over our food.
At the words, Harry pulls Draco into a hug and holds him tight, in the glorious sunlight of early afternoon. The air smells like monk’s rhubarb and goosefoot. They do not let go for a very long time.
“Or what, you’ll continue burning things down?” Draco replies because he doesn’t know how to express all the things that live in his chest.
They’re standing at a safe distance from the last dying flames. Harry is wearing a ratty pair of jeans and the Holyhead Harpies T-shirt Ginny gave him last Christmas; Draco is wearing impeccably pressed gabardine trousers in an elegant shade of slate-grey and a soft linen shirt with the sleeves rolled up.
“He came to the Manor, you know? The day after you left. He stood in the dining room, and he listed everything he blamed me for. I think it took the better part of an hour. He wasn’t dignified about it either: he screamed about the war, and about letting Lucius entertain a genocidal madman, about the loneliness of never feeling that my love was unconditional. Then, he cried as he told me he didn’t know how to be loved. It ruined his relationship with you, he said, and he didn’t want his relationship with me to go the same way. I cried too, that day, for the first time since I was a child.”
So Harry loved Draco. He loved Draco immensely and patiently like the sea loves the sky. He loved Draco with everything he had, with all his blood and every single one of his breaths. Still, Draco sometimes wouldn’t speak to him for days at a time. Still, Draco wouldn’t tell him he loved him, and Draco wouldn’t move in with him. “Don’t rush me,” he told Harry.
“It’s the least I could do,” Draco replies with a sad sort of smile at the corner of his lips, “after everything that happened.”
Harry doesn’t know why he opened the message this particular owl brought. There were many owls, tapping at every window and sitting on the roof and all over the street outside his door too. He did his best to ignore them.
You can’t fault her, you’ve been a shitty boyfriend. The press is all up in it, of course, and your life is hell for a while. You don’t mind. It keeps you busy, avoiding the reporters and turning away all the owls. It stops you from thinking. Then, Celestina Warbeck wears the wrong dress at a gala or serves breakfast tea at four o’clock or something and the media frenzy dies down.
He crosses the room slowly, without looking at you. There’s the weight of the entire world on his thin shoulders. As soon as he closes the door behind him, you run away.
I don’t know. It’s not that I’ve not done things that I regret. I mean, I was in a war. People I loved died because of the decisions I made, and I can’t ever say that I don’t regret that. But I’m not that person anymore. And I’ve also learned that the stuff that happened happened, you know? You can never take it back. You can never change it. You’ve got to accept it if you want to stand a chance to forgive yourself for it.
“I guess I thought that because he didn’t love me, I had the right to hurt him as much as he hurt me,” you finish. You feel defeated and broken and entirely overwhelmed by everything, like reality is suddenly too much for you to take in.
“I can’t believe you came,” you whisper like you’d pray a soft Ave Maria in the hallowed silence of a church.
It is an entirely absurd way of harassing your ex, and of course, no one but you would ever [words smudged]
And just like that, Harry decides he’ll go. Immediately, a weight lifts off his shoulders. Immediately, there is laughter bubbling in his throat, and when it spills from his mouth, it echoes against the flagstone floor and reverberates across the vaulted ceiling until Harry can’t tell if Iris has joined in, or if he’s laughing alone, but he finds he doesn’t care because, for the first time in years, his life is his again to steer in the direction he wants. Because, for the first time in years, he wants to take a chance, he wants to jump off that cliff and find out if he can swim. Because, for the first time in years, he’s realised some things are worth fighting for.
“The one on my thigh, though, that one’s about minding my place as a woman.” She takes another long drink. “Asks me if I know what happens to women who are too loud and don’t know when to shut up and insinuates it might happen to me too. I think the placement of that particular sentence gives me an excellent idea of exactly what it is it’s talking about.”
When Draco finally starts stroking your cock, your vision blurs entirely and you cover your face with your fingers. The sensation of Draco’s fingers tracing colour-bright strokes of pleasure on your skin is almost too much to bear, and you’re entirely sure you’re going to catch fire or turn to liquid. You’re entirely sure you’re going to physically come undone from the feeling, entirely sure your muscles will dissolve, entirely sure your bones will turn to chalk or dust.
You crowd Malfoy, you push him against the wall with violent words sitting on your tongue and fight-tight fists. You know this, you know the contact of your bodies, vicious and shock-sharp. He’ll hit you, you think. He’ll hit you, and you’ll hit back, and the skin over your bones will stain purple-black with his fists. And you crave the pain, oh, you do. You need the shatter-pain contact of his knuckles with the bone of your jaw. You need the blood-crack of split lips and the taste of iron and salt on your incisors. You need to wipe away the sticky salt-red and smile and taunt, your entire body reckless and alive. You need it like a missing limb or a broken tooth.
There was something different about Draco in those moments where they were both naked and panting, something open and vulnerable that went straight through Harry’s heart. There was something in the way he let Harry pull him apart slowly, with his fingers and tongue and cock, the way he moaned Harry’s name as Harry plunged deep into the tight heat of him. It drove Harry entirely mad with desire. Entirely mad with an abominable kind of love too (the kind of love that filled the entire room or flooded the entire city. The kind of love that might have been infinite, had Harry let it.)
“I…” Draco starts, then stops to run a hand over his face. “It can’t have been easy being with me,” he continues, quieter. “I wasn’t the best boyfriend. Hell, I was pretty shit, if I’m honest. I was in a pretty shit place too.”
I knew him, you know. Not well, mind you, but we crossed paths a few times. I don’t think anyone knew him all that well, if I’m honest. His friends maybe did, but not us. All we saw was a symbol or a celebrity. A weapon, a tool, a menace. I don’t think we ever saw the person he really was. No use regretting it now, I guess. But I always try to be a little more considerate, now, a little kinder. I always try to remember we’re all human.
Let us start before that. Let us start with a quiet shop in a bustling wizarding street. Let us call that shop “Patrician Potions”. It is small inside, spartan but tastefully decorated. If you were to ring the delicate bronze bell sitting on the cold, smooth, black marble of the counter, a blond man would appear and ask you in a calm voice how he can help you. But let us not do that, reader. Let us not bother him—he’ll have trouble enough when the story finally starts in earnest.
“Yes.” Draco’s voice is rough as pumice and sweet as honey as he answers. “Anything you want, love. Anything at all,” he adds as his motions become slow as treacle dripping from a spoon. His hand on Harry’s cock slows too, coaxing every feeling of pleasure out of Harry’s chest and onto Harry’s skin.
“Thank you,” he tells Iris before he leaves, when the laughter has died down and the light outside is beginning to fade.
Then, there were bad days: dark and awful and too many to count. Days when Draco didn’t want to be touched at all, and there were days when Harry thought the loneliness of not being truly loved would crush him entirely. There were days that were bad for other reasons too, because the atrocities of the war weighed like a stone on Harry’s lungs or because Harry drowned in the wine-dark sea of grieving for everyone he had ever loved. Draco never stayed, on these days. He never knew what to say or how to act. “I can’t always be there for you,” he told Harry. And: “you’re not the only one who hurt. I’m not strong enough to pull you back to your feet.” He never said he was sorry, and Harry gasped for breath in empty rooms, trying to slow the panic-scramble of his heart, trying not to drown in the dark air around him.
“I… I really need you to say something, Draco.” (A soft, sad plea, whispered by a breaking boy, in a broken voice.)
The anger in her voice sets fire to the terrible, ancient things in my chest. I look down at my quill. I haven’t taken a single note since she started talking about Draco’s funeral. I write
His soft grey eyes are on you and you forget everything about leaving and healing. You want to smile and kiss his forehead. You want to yell at him that you know you’ll never be good enough for him or right enough for him, but would he let you pretend just a little more? Would he love you today, just for a while, would he kiss your hair and hold your hand?
“We broke up, Harry,” Draco says slowly, the words cold, like dead fish in his mouth. “You left. Years ago. I haven’t seen you since.”
On the day the writing first appears, I break down in the loo of a Muggle cafe and cry for an hour, sitting in a dirty stall. I don’t know why it happens, some face on the street looked too much like Fred, I suppose. The couple at the table next to mine made me think of Lupin and Tonks, perhaps. Later, I’ll think about it and realise these things are bound to happen. I’m still grieving, I’ll tell myself. I might never stop grieving. It’s normal. When it happens, though, it feels the furthest thing away from normal. It feels wrong and hopeless and unreal, so I fish a pen out of my pocket. It is black and it feels smooth in my fingers. My mind healer made me carry it with me in case I feel like journaling. I did not tell her that no one outside of books ever felt like journaling. I did not tell her I wasn’t a gothic heroine and I wasn’t paying her to make me sound like one, I was paying her to make my emotions be normal again. So I pocketed the pen and here it is. I take the cap off. Press it to the textured peach wallpaper above the tiles. “I FOUGHT TO LIVE AND NOW I DON’T KNOW WHAT TO DO WITH MYSELF,” I write in big, shaky letters.
, Pansy Parkinson. The hero of the Wizarding World was seen nursing a glass of wine, wearing a frown. Not even best friends, Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger, managed to bring a smile to the face of the heartbroken saviour as he watched the love of his life marry someone else. Witches wishing to mend that heroic heart will have to find the man first: since he dropped out of Auror training, our Harry has been virtually invisible and his London residence has been empty. Where has the lovelorn lad been running away to? We wish we knew!
This is what we’d see if we went inside, but let us not, reader, for the story does not begin in the shop. The story begins in the office on the first floor, with a dark-haired young man looking longingly out the window. The young man’s name is Harry Potter. He does not work here, not really. He’s agreed to help out because his friend Ron, who does work here, is on Paternity leave, but this does not matter to our story. No, what really matters to our story is that Harry Potter, who is currently sitting in an office on the first floor of Weasley’s Wizarding Wheezes at a desk full of bills and tax forms and paperwork, is desperately in love with one Draco Malfoy, Master Potioneer and owner of “Patrician Potions.”
I find myself, days later, irredeemably lost in some back alley of wizarding London with nothing but a glamour on my face and an address on a bit of parchment.
(You’re still waiting for the vines to break your bones, for the fruits to poison your bloodstream, for the orchids to clog your lungs.)
“I’ve been trying to let go of who I was before the war,” she says. “I hope you can tell from the remodelling, though I must confess that interior design was not the most pressing change.”
Harry learns that Draco does indeed come to the island regularly and usually rents a little holiday cottage. He doesn’t come into the town much, but there is a lighthouse on the far side of the island, where everything is flat rocks and seawater as far as the eye can see. He might be there, the man tells Harry. And: go find him.
“We’ve just got to figure out how,” I say in a low voice, and Hermiones shoots me a small, relieved smile.
“I’m so sorry I couldn’t tell you how much I loved you,” Draco continues in a broken whisper, “I don’t think I’ve ever loved someone as much as I loved you. I don’t think I ever will again, you know? Some days, I feel like you were my soulmate and I’ve missed my chance at being with you. Some days, I almost can’t live with myself for not having held onto you. But I wasn’t in a good place then, and I couldn’t do things any differently, and I just need to learn how to forgive myself for it.”
New nuisance in the yard today. Black-haired. Poked about my burrow so I bit him. Very satisfying. Hope he will not come again.
“It… Harry… We can’t….” There is no violence in Draco’s words, no conviction (only the utter terror of a man standing on the edge of a different cliff.)
“I’m going to fuck you, Potter,” Draco whispers into the skin of your shoulder. “I’m going to fuck you like you’ve never been fucked. I’m going to make you scream, and I’m going to come inside you, and it’s going to feel so good. Oh, you’re going to be so good for me, aren’t you, Potter?”
There is every emotion on his beautiful face, like time-lapse clouds in front of the sun sweeping patches of shade across the ground.
The case Robards called you for turns out to be a disaster. It’s a hostage case, and several of your colleagues are in danger, and the adrenaline burns clean through your veins. You get hit with a curse on the side of your neck, and still, you keep fighting. And when it’s finally over, you’re on edge and in pain, and everything around you tastes like war and death. Ron grabs your hand and squeezes.
Iris swoops delightedly, then stills in mid-air, stretching her stocking-clad legs out before her and crossing her legs at the ankle. She’s wearing peep-toe shoes with chunky heels.
You mutter something about needing to consult Nicholas about how much to reveal to the press and invite the dicta-quill wielding nuisance to interview you in your home the next day.
(Because here’s the thing about Malfoy: it hurts like an open fracture or a heart attack that you love him, but you love him. And you need him like you need air, and you’re entirely certain that if you were to leave, your flesh would turn into chalk and you’d crumble down entirely.)
“You feel so good, Harry. You feel so good. Do you like this? Does this feel good? Tell me what you want, Harry. Tell me. You can have it all. Anything you like. Anything at all. Tell me.”
She leaves after promising that she’ll make Draco listen to that interview if she has to tie him down herself, and threatening you twice more for good measure.
Mrs Malfoy’s face is perfectly composed and perfectly neutral as she politely listens to Harry, her porcelain hands demurely joined together in front of her. Harry continues:
To the discord channel who knows this chapter under the delightful title of "ghost porn": thank you for making me laugh and giving me motivation to do this.
“Harry, you said you bought a house,” Draco repeats as Harry turns the key in the lock of one of the French doors. “Why on earth did you acquire this giant mess of a thing?”
“Do you have any recollection at all of anything prior to that engagement party?” The question is awkward, of course, if only because my voice sounds deafeningly loud in the wake of her pained whisper, but I figure it is the best way to help her stop crying. Pansy’s never liked having people pity her, and I can’t quite bring myself to entertain the emotion anyway.
Our burrow is getting crowded. Aunt Gnomina will not stop talking my ears off. Decided on digging a new burrow by the cabbage patch. Dug ten inches. Took a nap in the hole. Good day.
The daughter, it turned out, studied biology at the local university and spoke almost flawless English. Everything was easier after that: the building had once been a
Harry can still feel the hum of the house inside his chest, he can still feel the hope and the life of it. When he tries to paint the walls of the upstairs bedroom the next morning, the paint does not fall to the floor in strips.
When they tumble down on the rocks, when they pull at each other’s clothes and Harry’s back rests flush against the cool rocks as Draco touches him with hands careful and reverent as a saint holding a rosary, there is a light so bright in Harry’s chest that he thinks he might catch fire with it. (That he might burn and burn and burn until there’s nothing left of him but ash on a rock by the sea.) But he is not a pyre, and he does not consume, so instead he loves, and loves, and loves. Instead, he holds and he touches and he is touched until moans of ecstasy echo the faraway cry of seagulls.
Draco’s voice is breathy and high, shattered by pleasure, by his own incommensurable want, and Harry can feel the desire in his bones. There’s Draco’s hand on his cock, and there’s Draco’s hair in his hands and Draco’s hands on his face, and fireworks erupt inside Harry’s chest as he comes with Draco’s name on his lips.
“You have me now,” Harry wants to say, and: “you don’t have to forget ever again,” but he finds that every syllable that comes out of his mouth is forever a rosary of
When they finally kiss, it’s slow and tentative at first, like a peace treaty after an endless war or the first signs of spring after a long winter. Harry cups Draco’s face in his hands, and Draco runs his fingers through Harry’s hair. When they finally break apart, they stare at each other, wet-eyed and unmoving, their faces all painted in awe and disbelief and a fragile sort of hope.
And Harry knows he’ll never be the same again, never be alright again. He knows he should push Draco away. He knows he should keep his shirt on, should keep his head on his shoulders and his heart inside his chest because it’ll ruin him, the burn-shock contact of Draco’s skin on his. It’ll gut him like a fish and turn him inside out.
Have had an idea. Will make blond-haired read the parchment so my friend will come back. Have talked cousin Gnorothy and great-grandma Gneodora into helping me. They will make noise until maybe-Draco comes out and then I will run and place the parchment inside his home.
“There you go, Harry,” he finally says, pouring the brightly coloured potion into a cup. “The finest headache potion you will find anywhere in London if I do say so myself.”
It was awful and it hurt, seeing Draco so distraught, fists clenched tight and mouth drawn, but there was a little piece of Harry, there, right there, at the bottom of him, that was glad of it. (At least Draco was looking at him now. At least Draco was talking to him now.)
The first day, Harry walks along the port, breathing in the salty scent of sea air and letting the wind blow through his hair. The skies are grey and heavy with clouds, but Harry finds he doesn’t mind. He loves it here. It is too early in the season for tourists yet, but there are young children with their parents and loud seagulls fighting over fish, and everything feels so beautifully alive that Harry wants to commit it all to memory, hold it in his hands and cradle it to his heart. He’ll show Draco too someday, he thinks, when they’ll be so deliriously happy that this entire ordeal will be just an anecdote, a laugh and a kiss and
I squeeze her hand briefly. I feel guilty for making her spell it out for me, guilty that she’s shocked and shaken, yet she still has to do the work of explaining why she’s hurt.
“I’m sorry too, honey,” Ron says from behind me. I lift my head from Hermione’s curls to see him standing behind her, his hand on her shoulder. “I should have understood it was about more than threats the first time you explained. I should have listened better.”
The word is whispered in a language Harry understands. The wind hasn’t spoken it, nor the lake, nor the leaves crunching underfoot.
“Oh, he loves you.” Pansy says the words like she would spit a cherry stone, hard and quick and like she doesn’t want them in her mouth.
There are tears streaming on Harry’s cheeks by the time the soft wetness of Draco’s mouth closes around him. How did they get there? It doesn’t matter. It only matters that Draco is beautiful, and beautiful, and touching him in ways he never dared to hope.
At the words, Sara picks Iris up by the waist and twirls her around as peals of laughter echo through the room.
“Yes, I will continue burning things down until you talk to me,” Harry yells. Charred pieces of wood are falling all around them. Gold-bright flames are licking at the once-orange walls. Jemima Graves has just Apparated a mere handful of metres from them and is staring at the half-burning street with a face full of disbelief and exhaustion.
Draco runs his fingers over the skin of Harry’s chest and around his erect nipples as he pumps Harry’s cock in long, slow strokes, and desire builds in Harry’s chest, bone-shattering and bright.
Draco’s eyes are still closed, and his face is a renaissance painting in the low light of the bedside table (A pained Madonna without a child. Saint Catherine walking to the wheel.) There are no tears on his cheeks, but when he speaks again, his voice is ocean-wet and bark-rough.
And they should have been happy, then. They should have held onto each other. They should have healed and been healed and been safe. But they weren’t and they didn’t. In the real world, Draco felt like a granite cliff, immense and cold and entirely unmoving, and Harry kept running headfirst against the solid stone of him.
Hermione shakes her head. “I usually lock the door to my office when I go, but plenty of people have keys that give them access to the entire floor.”
“I love you,” Draco says as he holds Harry through his orgasm. Inside Harry’s chest, happiness pools warm and rich, like honey or gold.
You can’t be gay. Fuck. You can’t be gay. Not on top of everything else. Not on top of the nightmares and the trauma, not on top of being singled out and hunted down by the press every time a minute detail in your life changes.
Draco doesn’t move. Doesn’t say anything. Tears run silently down his cheeks and kiss the corners of his mouth. (Harry’s heart breaks at the sight.)
“If there’s a chance at all that I can see him again, I’ll take it. And if there isn’t, at least I’ll have helped someone who cared about him.”
I try not to wince at that. I try not to tell her that there are days when Draco’s funeral is all that I can think about. I try not to show that Draco’s death is still etched into every single one of my bones, a terrible sort of tattoo made entirely out of pain and loss.
“You can’t deny that you are gay, Mr Potter. We have pictures proving the fact. But we would appreciate confirmation, perhaps an interview? It would be a shame if we had to publish those pictures without your approval, now, wouldn’t it?”
You don’t say anything. She’s right, of course. You’ve spent months hurting Draco because you were too wrapped up in fear and anxiety, because, for all that you are a Gryffindor, for all that you are good at rushing into danger, you were never quite brave enough to own up to who you were, to let others see you, judge you. (Love you, too.) And now, you’ve gone and fucked everything up, and it’s all your fault. You start crying again.
“I loved you,” Draco says, staring into the distance with tears on his face. “I loved you so much. I was too broken to tell you, too afraid of rejection. Too afraid you’d leave one day and I’d be left with a hollow heart and no way of ever patching myself up. I loved you and it broke my heart, seeing you give and give and give everything you could to people who never deserved it. It broke me to see you attend memorials and galas and speeches. You always came back so drained and were sad for days afterwards, but still, you went. I could never protect you like I wanted. I never knew what to do about it. I wish I could have told you this then. Told you how much I loved you. Begged you to keep what little flame of happiness you had in your heart, to let me tend to it until it turned into a fire again. I could never, and then you left. It was my fault, but it still hurt, you know? It was important to me, what we had. You were important to me. I wish we could have said goodbye.”
“It called to me,” he answers as Draco ponders over the results of his diagnostic spell, hanging in the air in glittering gold lines. “I saw it and I knew I had to save it, no matter how much it costs or how much work it would be, you know?”
cutting his heart into ribbons. Pain radiated in his chest as he forgot how to breathe or how to talk or how to cry. In the silence, Draco moved swiftly towards the door. A soft click: Harry was alone.
I do not wish to interfere with your private affairs, but I couldn’t help but notice the dreadful sadness emanating from you when I looked at those pictures in the Daily Prophet. I can’t imagine how it must have felt like for you, watching Ginny on the happiest day of her life and knowing that you’ve lost her forever. But, Harry, I come bearing hope for you, for I am quite certain that Ginny wasn’t meant for you.
sits like a stone on his tongue (heavy and cold.) Before he can find a way to form his lips around it, Draco turns around.
All sorts of conflicting feelings immediately bubble up inside Harry’s chest at the words. He is speaking before he can stop himself.
“Draco,” you moan, because you’re entirely incapable of using words anymore. “Draco, oh, Draco.” His name has become a mantra that keeps you safe, that keeps you sane, that keeps your demons at bay, and his fingers on your skin. You taste every syllable of it on your tongue like citrus fruit and brown sugar. You swallow up all the words he spills onto your naked skin, and you beg for more.
That night, after I fall asleep, I dream of him. I’m holding him in my arms and he’s whispering his name into my hair and, though I can't quite make it out, I am filled with the bone-shattering certainty that I have never felt this happy in my entire life.
His entire face is alight with the challenge of cracking the mystery of Harry’s house, and Harry remembers the glimmer in his eyes better than he’d like.
“I’m a ghost, Sara,” Iris replies, a playful pout on her lips. “It took some creative thinking, making things work between us! What is their excuse? They were both tangible from the start!”
Harry’s almost ready for bed by the time there’s a soft knock in his door that evening. Draco’s in the corridor, wearing the same soft jumper and flannel trousers as the day before.
“No, Harry. I think I would have been targeted either way because the message about Draco, the one on my arm? That’s the important one.
“We couldn’t figure out which one, though. Couldn’t find any mention of a potion that does anything similar anywhere.”
(Later, when you grieve for that future in earnest, you’ll realise it never was your happy ending at all, and you’ll bury every last scrap of it in a shallow grave in his memory, and you’ll cover it in daffodils and nostalgia. But it is not later, not yet, and you’re leaning against the cool wood of the door and choking back sobs, and you still believe you want it in earnest.)
A little over an hour later, I finally find the letter. It’s written on disgustingly pink, disgustingly rose-scented paper and it goes like this:
It feels lush and lovely, and you can’t remember the last time you felt so alive. You’ve felt alive with Draco, yes, but it was a different feeling altogether. You were a lightning storm, then, or a forest fire, wild and dangerous, destructive and ravenous. You were the kind of alive that can only stay alive until it’s devoured everything in its path, the kind of alive that was always going to starve away sooner or later. There are vines hanging from your ribs, now, weighed down by orchids and lush fruits.
There’s Draco’s naked skin on his, Draco’s soft-hard erection against his belly, Draco’s warm-solid thigh against his groin, and this—this is when Harry knows it’s really happening. They’re going to make love there, on the forest floor, and how can he ever survive this? How can he ever remember how to be alive again now that he’s a lightning storm, now that he’s forest fire and a tidal wave and an avalanche?
So Harry walks, and all the while, the lighthouse lamp goes round. And round. And round. And Harry lets it guide his steps. (
“Hush, darling,” she whispered back, her hands warm on his back. “He’ll come around. Give him time.”
When Malfoy fucks you into the mattress, later that night, it’s rough and vicious. He pulls at your hair, and he leaves bruises all over your skin, and he doesn’t try to kiss you.
“And I hate it,” she continues, ignoring me entirely. “I hate it. I hate the message whoever did this decided to write on my skin. I hate the fact that it’s written on my skin. I hate the fact that they’re making me carry this on my body.”
Understanding hits Harry all at once like a tidal wave. He’s spent a lifetime of running away from everything—from grief and from the war, from impotent rage and from heartbreak. From love too, from settling down somewhere and making a home. And it was never healthy, any part of it. Underneath all the Portkeys and the adventures, underneath the silent awe and the solitude, throughout every forest and every desert, on the edge of every cliff and every sea, he was always going to be the heart-broken boy who loved too much and was never loved enough. He was always going to be the grief-crucified boy who lost everyone before he was ever properly grown and who walked to his death before he had ever started to live, and—
Marstrand is beautiful and quiet, with cobbled streets and old houses and lilac bushes spilling in soft hues of purple and mauve over every fence. Harry books a room for himself at the
And it was all you could think about, that hope. The brightness of it dispelled all the shadows of your doubts and your fears. It filled you entirely with something anxious and restless until you pulled on your travelling cloak and stepped outside. It’s all you could think about, and now, you’re standing on Draco’s doorstep and it suddenly dawns on you, the immensity of everything you’re doing. Everything it means. How terribly badly it could backfire.
“I’m glad you’re both here,” Hermione says when we break apart, wiping the wetness away from her cheeks with the sleeve of her jumper. “Now, I need you to help me figure out who did this, so I can make them pay.”
Harry and Draco walk up the winding path in silence, taking in the mountains and the meadows and each other’s comforting presence. Then, Iris appears behind one of the large Lebanon cedar trees and nothing is quiet anymore.
Were Harry Potter a different person, reader, a more emotionally healthy person, perhaps, he’d simply resolve the issue by knocking on Draco’s door. By inviting him for a drink, maybe. By ringing the bell on the counter and requesting a potion, even. But you must understand: things are not that simple for Harry Potter.
I wish your fingers were stroking my skin right now instead of your words. I wish I could touch you right now. I want to touch you so bad.
The journalist looks surprised for a second, but then, his dicta-quill is taking notes, and you’ve gone and made a statement because of course you have. (Lately, every word that spills from your tongue is something that should stay forever in your mouth.)
“What happened?” I ask because there’s no sense in asking if they’re alright when it’s so clear they’re not.
I’ve got dark hair. I've been told have pretty striking eyes too. And you know I work with animals, shovelling manure all day has definitely given me muscles. Dubiously scented muscles, but you never said anything about smelling nice. So I ought not to be too much of a disappointment when we meet.
There’s something fierce burning behind Iris’ eyes: it ignites something deep inside Harry’s chest. (Something that has been dormant for a very long time, something like hope or desire or the will to fight.)
I toy with the idea of finishing that paragraph with: you. I want him to be you. Anything you are. Anything at all. This is what I want, if you’ll have me.
You should really define what you mean by knowing someone. Is it even possible for a person to know themselves entirely? Is it possible to be aware of every emotion? Every motivation?
he wants to scream. He wants to tear out his hair or crush Draco’s wrists between his fingers or pin him against the wall and kiss him like a wolf bites.
You climb into bed and softly shake Ginny awake. She looks at you with sleep-heavy eyes. She cries when you tell her you’re sorry, and she kisses you when you tell her you love her, you really do, and you’re going to be better now, you’re going to make her happier now. She falls asleep between your arms, her head resting on your chest, her ginger hair on your face. You can smell the green apples in her shampoo, and when you remember that Draco smelled like cedar and smoke? You shove it down and decide to never think of it again.
You want to tell him everything, but you can’t remember the words. So you stand in the middle of Diagon Alley with a knife through the heart and a boulder on your tongue, and you can see the cracks in the careful porcelain of Draco’s jaw. Of Draco’s throat. (Of Draco’s heart.)
You can’t hurt her anymore, you decide. She’s done everything for you; she waited while you were walking to your death, and she held you in the aftermath, and you love her, you love her so much, you’ve always loved her. (You do, oh you do. Don’t you?) You need to be better, for her, you resolve. You need to make it right, take every feeling that bubbled up to the surface when you were held tight in Draco’s arms, when his breath was on your neck and his leg in between your thighs and shove it down, down, down into the deepest pit of yourself and keep it there forever.
I take a deep breath. No helping it now. I was in school with the man. He was on the other side of the war. I realise I don’t even care who he turns out to be, I realise I love him whoever he is. I take another deep breath. Then, I set out to find our meeting place, striding quickly across room after room of delicate objects and priceless treasures. When I finally find the shield, there is a man in front of it. A slender man with hair a shade of blond I’ve never seen on anyone but…
“Potions and misogyny…” I say after a while, “do you think the same people responsible for this are also the people responsible for drugging Pansy?”
The words feel like lightning, cutting you clean into halves from the top of your head to the soles of your feet.
“I thought you didn’t love me,” Harry admits, sitting on the bed and staring at the tarnished pine boards under his feet. “I thought it was what it meant.”
They met for the first time since the last battle at Snape’s funeral. The Ministry had deemed it better for Snape not to be buried with all the other victims of the war when wounds were still fresh and grief clawed through everyone’s heart like wolves. The peace was still fragile, that spring, the opinion of the people too easily turned, and Harry boiled over with deep-set rage at the idea that the man who had sacrificed everything to win the war was hidden away like a shameful secret while those who hid at home and let children fight in their place roamed the street freely with words like “freedom” and “justice” filling their throats and dripping from their lips.
I’d moan your name into your neck. Oh, you’d tell me your name, wouldn’t you? I’d whisper it like it was a prayer. I don’t think you’d even have to touch me to make me come.
Mrs Malfoy takes a sip of her drink. When she speaks again, her voice is clear and perfectly controlled:
“Talk to me,” Harry says again as an ember falls on Jemima's shoulder and her hair promptly catches on fire too.
“Auror Potter.” She takes a sharp breath in. “I have known I was a lesbian ever since I was thirteen and kissed Millicent on a dare. I have never as much as liked a man for a single second in my entire life. Yet, today, I woke up in the middle of my engagement party to Miles Bletchley.” She says the name like she’s spitting out a slug. For an instant, I think she’s going to start crying. She doesn’t. (She presses her lips tightly together instead.)
“I told her we’d do it without her,” she adds, clearly delighted by her own story. “I know she hates feeling left out.”
You collapse on the floor, and you pretend its cool embrace can protect you from the void inside your chest.
“Stay,” Harry begs—or perhaps he doesn’t say anything at all, perhaps there are no words spilling from his lips, only unadulterated loss, violent like a waterfall.
You Apparate to his doorstep, with a declaration of love on the tip of your tongue. He’ll listen, he’ll have to, you try to convince yourself as your good hand makes contact with the cool wood of the door.
“I want you,” Draco kisses into the skin of Harry’s neck, and Harry thinks he could weep from the words.
You’re tired and in pain, and you’ve just realised you aren’t going to be able to go back home quite yet. You’re still a bit drunk on everything that happened with Draco, on his skin and his hair and the softness of his mouth when he kissed you. And this, perhaps, this is why you turn reckless all of a sudden.
I’m sorry to hear, though I really should have expected you to have some bad memories because of the war. You did tell me you were twenty-six. Same year as the Saviour of the Wizarding World, isn’t it? Did you know him? What did you think of him?
“Maybe you need to be asleep,” he finally says. “Maybe if I could observe you as you dreamt, I might be able to understand it.”
So here I am. In the pouring rain. All the doors look the same. No sign of a clinic at all. No sign there’s anything here but rows of cheap council flats and a few choice rats rummaging through the rubbish bins. I double-check the number on my parchment and I knock. A middle-aged witch answers. She looks nothing like a healer. She’s got bright blue hair and she’s wearing Doc Martens.
“You were always too good for me. I caused you too much harm,” he continues in a broken voice, “I’m sorry I ran. That was not my most dignified moment, I’ll admit, but I couldn’t take the rejection from you. Not again. Not when I’d finally let myself believe there was some happiness to be found for me in the world. Not when I’d finally let myself believe I could have this.”
I squeeze his fingers in my hand and move closer still, our faces almost touching. He smells like vetiver and pine. His eyes are bright and beautiful and grey in the same way that a stormy sky is grey—dangerous and gorgeous and ever-changing.
He looses control then, grabs at Draco with lust-clench hands, moves his hips to meet Draco’s thrusts, faster and faster and faster until he can’t think anymore, until everything is blinding and burning and not enough, still not enough, never enough. And he begs him for more and Draco grabs the side of his head, and kisses the centre of his mouth, and calls him
At quarter to four, I am losing my mind behind a glass case containing an oddly shaped marble sculpture, mysteriously labelled
Finished digging my new burrow. Great-uncle Gnomer went on a three-hour tangent about how they used to dig burrows back in his day. Bit his arm to make him stop. Did not see blond nuisance today.
It’s not what I’m asking, not really. As far as I’m concerned, he could be fifty and I don’t think I’d bat an eyelash, but I want to know if he’s lived the war too. If we were in this together, if he’ll understand when I inevitably tell him that I don’t know how to grieve.
Despite Harry’s translation spell, he can’t quite make out what the man is telling him. Asking if something was nice, perhaps? Or was it the word for green? He smiles politely, fully intending to make his way to the door without getting dragged into a conversation he only understands a fraction of, before he realises this man might know about Draco. Draco’s mother said he came here regularly, after all, and surely people would notice those things on such a small island?
“And yet, nothing shows up on the diagnostics.” He sounds tired, defeated. I realise he was hoping to find something too. I realise he was hoping he might see his friend again.
“I shouldn’t have brought your role in the war into our argument,” Harry replies. He’s well aware this is not what he’s supposed to say, but the words have been burning his lips for too long and he finds he cannot keep them in his mouth any longer. “On the day we broke up. I’ve been thinking about it, and it was uncalled for. I’m sorry. It hurt at the time, that you left, but I understand why you did now.”
“Don’t,” he whispers instead, staring at his hands and without moving even an inch. “We could be happy, Draco. This time around, we could make it work.”
As I thank him, I promise myself that I will be making an anonymous donation to his clinic. A generous one.
Black-haired friend came back! Held a piece of crumpled paper and yelled very loud and banged against the door. Great-grandma Gneodora almost had a heart attack, but it scared away the large frog that was trying to eat cousin Gnolanthe.
And this, reader, is why Harry Potter decides that the thing where half the shop explodes and there’s a pissed-off Ministry official taking notes about everything and he has to sign at the bottom of several incomprehensible forms? It’s better than another second not seeing Malfoy, and it’s the only way he can go about it.
Something is seriously wrong. I notice it as soon as I’ve stepped into their living room. The air is tense and electric, Ron standing next to the fireplace with his shoulders hunched and a worried look on his face. Hermione pacing the length of the room with both hands pressed against her temples.
Then, the feast was over, and it was the early hours of the morning, and they found they weren’t ready to let go of the other quite yet.
There is a lake in the forest. Is it deep? It doesn’t matter. It is bottle-green and sunlight kisses it’s calm surface. Harry crouches down, plunges his fingers in the cold, clear waters. The lake licks at his skin like a gentle lover. Harry closes his eyes and exhales.
“This is all so new to me, and honestly, I’m a bit scared, but I want to be with you. I’d like to try,” you confess. “If you’ll let me.”
You drop the last remnants of your shield, and you grasp that chance with both hands. You feel it pulsate, warm and gold, against your skin.
If you could think clearly, you’d realise that you’re entirely fucked, because you’ll never love anyone else like you love him. Not with this all-encompassing intensity. Not with this wild fervour. Not with this bottomless trust.
The first thought Harry had when he arrived at the dragon sanctuary was that Romania was breathtaking. Everyone was lovely, and looking after dragons was hard physical work, the kind that made Harry’s body tired and heavy at the end of the day, the kind that stilled his thoughts in his head and wrapped all his anxieties in the gauze of exhaustion. Still, it wasn’t enough.
“When Draco came along, your magical core started to open again. It was a slow process, at first but within a week, your core was lighting up all over like a Christmas tree. We thought that’s what he was helping you with. That’s why I couldn’t understand why he left.”
“I want you to fuck me,” you repeat. “I want you to ruin me. I want you to tear me to shreds and pick me apart and destroy me.”
“Don’t apologise, you don’t have any obligations towards me,” he cuts in with flint-hard hurt dancing in his pupils. Your chest fills with the deafening sound of fissuring ice shelves. You did this, you realise. You put this hurt in his eyes.
“Well, you know me,” Harry answers with a small, self-deprecating laugh. “Always been one for hopeless cases, really.”
“I came for you,” Harry replies, still and breathless. (Teetering on the edge of a cliff, arms extended and eyes closed, a second away from the void.)
(This is the thing about pain: it’s always helped you know where you end and where the rest of the world starts. This is the thing about pain: it’s always helped you to inhabit your body again.)
When Jemima’s report ends up on her boss’ desk, for the first time in Jemima’s long career, it is not properly filled in. She’s taken liberties with the Infractor’s name and she’s got the name of the business all wrong. There’s not even a violation code. Instead, her writing sprawls over the entire page. The word “third” is heavily underlined and several words are written in capital letters - words like “EXPLODES” and “ME” and “NOT ANYMORE.” Next to Jemima’s report, on her boss’ desk is her Official Ministry Badge and a set of half-burnt Ministry Robes.
They sit in silence after that, their hearts heavy and raw with secret but their bodies warmed and soothed by touch.
“I’m sorry,” I whisper. “I’m sorry this awful thing is happening to you. It is not okay and you have every right to feel violated.”
I’m not the marrying kind, Draco. You’ve got to understand that. I’ve been bound to too many people already, everyone’s always expected so much of me that I’ve never really felt free to chose my path in life. I wish I could have accepted your ring. I wish I could have worn it, I wish I could have been happy about it. I can’t — and in a way, this is also something that’s been stolen from me. But it doesn’t mean I don’t love you. It doesn’t mean I don’t want to spend the rest of my life with you.
There is someone standing at the edge of the sea, and the sight of it fills Harry with lightning, crackling and violent and bright.
Draco doesn’t answer. His eyes are still closed, his entire face tense. He’ll break, you think, if you touch him too roughly. He’ll shatter like glass or turn to dust. And you—you’ve been quiet for so long, and you’ve been careful for so long, and you can’t keep the words on your tongue anymore. Everything you are spills from every pore of your skin, and your words dance around your head in the silence of the room.
I’d hold the back of your head and I’d kiss you, deep and passionate. I’d kiss you like I’ve always wanted to kiss you, like I’ve been waiting for you my entire life. I’d kiss you with all the urgency of a first kiss and all the indolence of a kiss that isn’t the last.
is the loveliest and she took the time to point out a few mistakes that I had left in this chapter. All remaining typos are strictly my own.
I pick up the receipt: Hawthorne’s Apothecary is written on top in a curly script. Underneath, an amount of galleons is penned in ink. No mention of what the galleons have been exchanged for. I turn it between my fingers for a while, then I spell it attached onto the pitiful notes I’d taken. I look at her and her face is equal parts anger and loss, confusion and resignation. I can’t think of any more questions to ask.
It isn’t a big thing, the opening ceremony, but state officials do come and give a speech or two. The entire building is gleaming in the bright August sunlight, and every room smells faintly of wax and floor polish. Every ghost is in attendance, dressed in their finest clothes and chatting excitedly among themselves. Sœur Félicie glows with pride at the newly painted walls and the freshly replaced window panes. The officials cannot hear her speak, of course, but that does not stop her from informing them that this place deserves to be loved and taken care of again.
When Draco shifts his hip against you, the heavens split into halves and lightning strikes your chest. Suddenly, your groin is rubbing against Draco’s firm thigh, and everything underneath your skin catches fire in the wake of that feeling. Draco guides your leg between his thigh, and this is when you lose it completely. It feels better than anything ever has, than anything even has the right to. He’s breathing against your neck, hot and heavy and wet. You moan and whimper, and you grab him by the hip, and you go fast, fast, fast, oh faster, like that, like that. You know in your bones you’re going to come hard, you can feel it in your teeth, and you can’t find the strength to care. You’re going to come against a wall in a back alley, against a man you’ve always felt more comfortable hating, and it is everything your life is not.
I wrap her in my arms and hold her tight. I know what it’s like to have something foreign on your skin and something foreign in your head, and to not be able to feel entirely safe in your own body. I would have fired every spell I knew at my scar, back then, if I thought it might have helped.
“He came to fix the house, you know?” Harry sighs. She’s become a friend in the short time he’s known her, and he knows Draco considered her one too. If she’s never going to see him again, she deserves an explanation at least. “I asked him and he said he would help me out—just this once, he said, for old time’s sake. Just this once and never again. Whatever happened between us was never planned, and I shouldn’t have assumed that he wasn’t going to leave as soon as he found a way to help me bond with the house.”
As I feared, the news of my nephew’s ailment broke out. As I was reading my newspaper in the morning room, the footman came in and informed me that...
If he could, reader, Draco would talk to him then. If he knew how to, he’d take Harry’s hands in his own and tell him that he’s been waiting for this moment for months and years, for decades maybe. If he were a different person, he’d kiss Harry right there and then, in the rubble and the flames, and it’d be an ode to the fact they did more than just survive a war: they survived the awful, fragile, brittle kind of quiet that came after it, too.
But everything in your life has been so wrong for so long, and Draco is making you feel alive with his solid, warm body, with his bone-sharp hips, with the sandpaper-roughness of his stubble on your neck. And Draco is making you feel right, finally, finally. Draco is filling up all the holes inside your chest, is mending all the cracks along your bones, is braiding the torn filaments of your heart back together and you never want it to end, the motion and the friction, the moans and the desperate grasping at each other, not when it feels this good, not when it’s the only thing that’s felt right since the war.
Draco nods, and joy fills your throat, sweet and tart like lemon sorbet. You take him in your arms, and you hold him because you’re allowed to, now. You’ve gone through hell, and you’ve made it to the other side, where there is sunshine on your skin and a smile on your lips, and where you can wrap your arms around the fragile form of Draco and never let go.
He’s good at cutting straight to the core of things. At finding the right words and asking the difficult questions. I answer him in the quiet of my living room late that night.
It’s not that you don’t want to stay. Oh, it’s not that you don’t want to watch him wake up, it’s not that you don’t want him to smile at you with sleep-fogged eyes. (You’d give your right arm for that. You’d give an eye or your lungs. If it was still yours, you’d give your entire heart, too.)
Draco’s hand, freed from Harry’s mouth, finds its way to his cock and starts stroking. Draco’s motions are quicker now, more frantic, and he’s babbling in earnest. And Harry loves him, Harry loves him, Harry loves him.
I walk towards him, not entirely certain what to tell him when he saves me the trouble by recognising me.
“I need to talk to you,” you say so you don’t have to think about the way his body felt against you, about the way his stubble rubbed against your jaw, about the way his leg felt between your thighs. (You realise you’ve grabbed his wrist at some point. You let it go like it’s made entirely of sharp needles and burn-glow embers.)
“No, no.” Draco grabs Harry’s wrists in his hands, and the contact of his skin strikes Harry like lightning. “Don’t. Don’t say that. You’ve always done that, you’ve always made your pain invisible, negligible. You’ve always forgiven and understood. I hurt you, Harry. I really did. I can see it now, and I could see it then, but I didn’t know how to do anything else. I thought it meant I was too broken for love, at the time. Still do, if I’m honest, but I regret hurting you. You deserved someone better than me, Harry. You deserved someone who could love you in all the right ways, who could tell you with all the right words exactly what you meant to them.”
There are nights when you feel everything at once, and your chest is so full of despair and sadness, of shame and anxiety that you think you’ll combust from the intensity of it. There are nights you spend lying on the floor, half convulsing and half crying, and you can’t bear it, you can’t, you can’t. Your blood turns to fire ants, and they’re burrowing into your chest, digging tunnels through your flesh and into your bones and you’d do anything for it to stop, but nothing works, nothing works, nothing works. And you don’t know how to stop being alive, because alive burns all your nerve endings, because alive shatters all your bones. The sounds are entirely too loud and the colours entirely too bright and the air you breathe is made entirely out of steel wool and wasp stings, and you can’t live like this, you can’t.
Ginny’s already asleep when you get home, half-drunk and petrified with fear. She looks so small and fragile in your large bed, you’re overcome with the desire to protect her and keep her safe. Then, you realise what you’ve just done, you realise how much it’d hurt her if she knew, and shame rolls over your body like a tidal wave.
“Det verkar vara något fel på din magiska kvintessens. Jag hade kollat upp det om jag var du, men tills dess så kan jag kasta en översättningsformel åt dig om du vill?” he adds, lazily waving and whispering a spell under his breath.
(I remember everything: the way the air stuck to my lungs like tar, and the way rain fell straight through my skin and pooled inside my chest, and the way the darkness behind my eyes swallowed the sun until the colours bled out of everything.)
“I want you inside me,” you finally manage when he’s worked you open and pushed you to the brink of madness and desire. The words punch the air clean out of his lungs and silence curls around you for a second. Then, Draco pushes you on to your hands and knees, whispers soft words of praise into your ear (
“Come to gloat?” you say instead, taking a swig of firewhiskey from the bottle and staring pointedly at the wall.
“Fine,” she exhales even though you’ve not asked her for anything at all. “I will intercede in your favour, Potter, but only because my best friend’s been moping over you for the past few months, and because he’s currently locked up in his childhood home, having an idiotic breakdown over you. And, if you hurt him, Potter—if you hurt him, I will kill you myself. Have I made myself understood?”
They kissed after the war, Draco and him. It started with an owl. This was unsurprising; there were many owls after the war (love letters and apologies and thank you, thank you, thank you.)
Their kisses turn savage after that, full of bruising fingers and teeth and love confessions hissed against hot skin.
The interview comes and goes. You do well, you think. Well enough that you don’t want to pick up all your words from the floor to shove them back into your mouth. Lee shakes your hand and thanks you and—it’s done, you think.
It’s just sex you tell yourself, when Malfoy shows up at your door at two o’clock in the morning, unshaven and wild-eyed.
Blond hair. Definitely. I’ve got a thing for blond men, it’s gotten me in trouble more than once. Elegant. My ideal man needs to have some sort of charm to him, class. He needs to make up for the fact that I have the social manners of an Erumpent and take the focus away from me in public. Quick wit, definitely. He’d have to make me laugh, but most of all, I think he’d have to make me think. He’d have to be able to challenge me when I have my head too far up my arse to make sense, too. I want someone who isn’t afraid of being blunt but who will also always be as kind as he can be. I want someone who’ll put up with all my weird quirks and accept me as I am, for who I am and what I can offer.
if Draco forbade Harry to say it too. The words were burning the tip of Harry’s tongue but “I’m not ready to hear it,” Draco said and Harry swallowed his love like glowing embers. He told himself it didn’t matter if Draco never committed to a relationship with Harry, didn’t want to come to Harry’s London flat either. They were fixing Grimmauld Place, and it was enough, wasn’t it, spending every daylight hour together? It was enough, it had to be. Harry would learn to still his greed-grasp heart, would learn to keep all his words inside his throat, and it would be enough.
The small, funny owl continued carrying messages between them, penned in the middle of the night and full of every feeling that spilt out of their chests in the hours between dusk and dawn.
Someone must have come in through the broken window in the west conservatory, Harry thought. (In the back of his mind, there was something clawed and dark scratching at his consciousness like a cat at a door.)
Every word is like a sea urchin between Harry’s teeth, their sounds scratching long bloody gashes on his tongue and inside his cheeks.
You nod. You don’t even need to think about it. You know he’s worth it. You know you want him. (You know he’s the one, you realise, and the knowledge of it spreads through your veins like liquid nitrogen.)
The weather is dreadful, the rain falling in thin but cold and unrelenting sheets. Still, in a desperate effort to forget that he loved Draco once, in a desperate effort to cleanse his skin of nostalgia for a past that sticks to it like glitter, Harry decides to go and work on the garden. It’s a ridiculous idea, but Draco’s already locked himself in the piano room and so he doesn’t tell Harry as much. (He doesn’t tell Harry that he’s impulsive and ridiculous and always doing the wrong thing either, though Harry knows he would if he knew.)
“I know he’s an idiot, Potter, I’ve met him. Everyone knows that he loves you, and if you can’t see that, then you might just be the one person in the entire world who’s even more of an idiot than he is.”
Do you believe in soulmates, Harry? Do you believe that someone out there will fulfil your every need, wish and desire? Do you believe there is someone out there who was meant for you? Many young people discard that idea as romantic nonsense nowadays, but there was a time when people believed in it. There was a time when people knew how to find their soulmates and there was a time where a certain spell was commonly used, among young people of marrying age, to ensure that they would be happily wedded and that their marriage would last.
It’s not that Harry ever meant to buy a sanatorium. Some days, Harry thinks he meant to do very little of what he actually did in his life. On those days, he hits the pub or moves to a different country or lies down in the woods and cries his eyes out. He avoids thinking about it too much, his life. The direction it’s going in too.
“Are you going to stop staring at some point? Or are insults your kind of foreplay, and we’re going to end up fucking against a wall again?” you spit. You’ve got nothing else to lose, there’s a hole in your chest already, there, just there where your heart used to be. Nothing matters anymore, now, and you savour the words on your tongue—you hope they hurt him, you hope they make him look away in shame or guilt. You hope they break this semblance of normalcy between the both of you, where you pretend that everything is still the same, that you can still trade barbs and be enemies and that the entire world didn’t go down in flames before you even were properly adults, that you’re not battered and broken and entirely out of place everywhere you go.
Black-haired nuisance did not yell today. Watched him knock on all the doors and windows. Very silly of him. No gnomes hide there. When he could not find a single gnome, he sat on the lawn and made dreadful sounds. Came out of my hole to investigate. The big, dumb oaf had his head in his hands and kept repeating how he just wanted Draco to forgive him. Very annoying. Bit his boot to make him stop. Did not work but was rather satisfying. Will bite the blond one’s wellies next time he forgets them outside.
Remembered where I heard the word “Draco”. My biscuit-bearing friend kept talking about a Draco who did not listen. Am beginning to suspect it refers to the blond-haired nuisance. If it is true, he is the one keeping the biscuit-giving human out of the garden. Unsure whether I should exact revenge. Have nibbled on his gardening gloves, just to be on the safe side.
As the world fades to black around me, Aaron’s smile is the last thing I see, and it makes me want to be sick.
“Ha! See, I told you I was keeping up with the real world! Well, what are you waiting for? Open the door! Let’s get in! Let’s go meet everybody!”
We need to set some ground rules if we’re going to do this. One: We do this one month. If there’s still nothing after a month, we meet and kiss and never talk about it again. Two: You never try to find out who I am. Three: We do not tell anyone about this.
You should let it go, you think, fiddling with the silver clasps on your travelling cloak. You should let it go, you should grieve the love that you’re not allowed to pour into the cup of his hands, and you should let yourself wallow for a while, do something stupid. Get a tattoo, climb a mountain. Whatever shit people do when they’re heartbroken.
When you’ve finally realised he isn’t going to answer you and you’ve gone almost entirely mad with the loss of him, you pick the lock and break into his flat.
“It is indeed!” He beams with pride. “It’s not as big as I’d like, not yet, but I can sell you some of the finest potions in London! Are you looking for something in particular?”
I think of Draco in his potion lab. He would know, I think before I remember that I may never see him again. I clench my fingers around the cool, smooth glass of the beer bottle and I don’t say anything.
Draco’s fingers map him, at first, with soft-trace fingertips. They learn all the curves and crooks of him, they classify and catalogue the colours and the texture of the skin, and only when they have explored him entirely, only when they have discovered every last secret spot, does Draco palm his cock in earnest and start stroking, in gentle, rhythmic motion. Whimpers and moans spill from Harry’s mouth like a strand of pearls or a waterfall. The sensation is blinding and deafening, pleasure courses like molten metal in Harry’s veins, curls into his every bone. It feels better than any sensation has the right to, Draco’s fingers on him, Draco’s soft lips kissing his side and whispering praise into his hip bone. (
It is the first time he offers information freely. My heart is beating in my throat. I can’t write my answer fast enough and then, I await his description of the ideal man with bated breath, feeling every bit the lovelorn heroine I’ve always insisted I wasn’t.
“It’ll be about twenty minutes before you can feel the effect, you really want to take it at once.” He smiles as one would smile at a scared dog or a fussy child, reassuring and patronising. I take the cup from his fingers. And then, because I can’t think of any excuses, I make my third mistake:
He balls his hand into a fist until his fingers hurt, white-crushed at the joints. He bites his lip. He does not say anything.
“I can try. They’re shy, though. And they won’t be able to speak English, you know? You don't magically learn every language when you’re dead. I only speak it because my mum grew up in England before she came to Switzerland to marry my dad. The rest of them only speak French, with varying degrees of awful, thick accents, might I add. Some people like Mrs Kolly never left the village where they were born before coming here, and it really shows. Then, there’s Greta and Vreni, and they speak Swiss-German, but I don’t think that’s going to help you to understand them more. Even we don’t always understand what they’re trying to say. You’d think some people lose their ability to learn at the same time as their ability to breathe, from the way they act! A hundred years to pick up a new language and they still can’t manage a proper sentence…”
You don't speak for the longest time. You've never been good with words, and what is there to say? Nothing, or perhaps everything. Perhaps every single word in the English language crowds in your mouth, and you don't know which one to begin with. You don’t know, so you kiss Draco until both of you are out of breath, exhausted and exhilarated all at once. When you finally part, his eyes are closed, soft blond eyelashes on soft porcelain skin, and you’re overcome with a wave of indescribable emotion, sadness and hope blurring into one. You cup his face in your hands, caressing the skin behind his ear in soothe-soft strokes.
“He loved you, Harry,” Iris replies, her voice soft and quiet, “and perhaps more importantly, you loved him. Love is a powerful medicine. It has a way of healing all the ailments you don’t realise you have. The ones you don’t want to think about too, perhaps .”
Her report, when she turns it in the next morning, does not state that the explosion was an accident. It is filled with sharp words and she’s underlined the words “highly illegal” three times in blue ink.
It was different, in the soft light of October. There was no rage, only a bone-deep sense of loss that filled Harry’s airways with quicksilver and his veins with lead. Then, Draco stepped in front of the casket, the mourning-black a stark contrast to the pallor of his skin, and the world grew still.
You mutter a curse in his direction and take another healthy swig of firewhiskey. Malfoy’s trying to set fire to your skin with his eyes, and you can’t read any of the emotion in his face. You take another swig, for good measure. It tastes like sadness and self-loathing. (Like grief. Like guilt, too.)
There are no words inside Harry’s mouth, then. They’ve all been replaced by desire as violent as a tidal wave and as destructive as a forest fire. He pulls at Draco’s jumper and fumbles with his belt. Draco throws his head back and whispers Harry’s name like a binding spell.
“Haft en bra dag, eller?” the man at the welcome desk asks in a booming voice as Harry walks past him to go out for dinner that night. “Himla synd att det har regnat så mycket på sista tiden, vädret brukar vara mycket bättre så här års. Men jag hoppas att du har haft några sköna dagar i alla fall?”
Harry raises his hand not holding Draco’s and gently runs his fingers down Draco’s cheek. Draco’s breath hitches softy.
“Harry? Harry Potter? I don’t think we’ve seen each other since we left Hogwarts!” He extends his hand towards me, a wide smile spreading across his face. I have no idea who he is.
Then, all of a sudden, there are three empty pint glasses in front of you, and you can’t take it anymore. You push yourself up, your palms coming into hard contact with the wood of the table. Heads turn to you, suddenly. You don’t look at them. You walk across the room.
“Draco,” Harry whispers back because the words have all left his chest, and everything that’s left is the feeling of home and the tangible form of the man he loves between his arms.
“You have come to the right place, Harry. Come, come, let us go at the back of the shop and I will put together a potion especially for you.”
Harry lets the warm-amber of the brandy trickle down his throat as image after image of Draco flash in his mind. Draco refusing to hold his hand in public. Draco refusing to meet his friends. The row they had after Harry, hurt and exhausted from never feeling good enough, had told Draco he loved him, despite Draco’s insistence Harry never speak the words.
, the locals called it. There was something tragic to its slow decay. Then, a group of vandals held a rave party within its walls and did quite a lot of damage. The city had been actively looking for someone to buy it ever since.
“Under no circumstances.” (In Draco’s mouth, Harry muses, every word is a knife. Gleaming and precise and capable of cutting gashes through his flesh.) “You’re welcome to come in and use the Floo like you’ve heard of civilisation, though. You look a fright and you’re drenched to the bone.”
The black-haired nuisance is back! He caught aunt Gnomina and swung her around before chucking her over the garden wall. An entertaining sight. Tried to catch me but failed. Noticed he was wearing gloves, this time.
There is safety in those words. It’s something you might have said in the courtyard at Hogwarts, or in the Great Hall, or on the quidditch pitch. Something warm and heavy settles behind your ribs, like a brick, or warm milk, or a pulsating swarm of bees.
“I did like you asked, Draco,” she announces, a mischievous smile dancing over her round little face. “Everyone has agreed to meet you both today. Not that it was easy, mind you. Agnès, the absolute bint, kept complaining that it was too early for her to be up and that she needed her beauty sleep. It’s quite incredible, the way some people have no concept of what being dead entails.”
“I love you,” Draco continues after a while, raising his grey-storm eyes to meet Harry’s. “I love you more than I can say, and I want to stay more than anything. But I can’t. I can’t. I’m so sorry, Harry. I wish I was a better person. A stronger person. Someone who could stand the pain of losing you a second time, or someone reckless enough to take the risk. But you’re the sun, Harry, and I’m forever going to be Icarus—flying too close and burning my wings and falling to my death. I’m sorry, Harry. I’m so, so sorry….”
Draco’s babbling against the skin of your back, he’s biting your shoulder and working your trousers open. You’ve never felt so good in your entire life.
He took Portkeys to anywhere, after that, visiting most of Europe and half of Africa. He walked through the arid heat of deserts and through lush oases. He stood on the edge of the Bering sea and watched the ice crack slowly in the tentative heat of spring, and he stood in the bogs of Denmark thinking about the people who had once died there and who might lie underneath his feet still.
Okay. Yes. Well, first, you need to know that if you’re a woman, I’m probably not going to be interested in you, so I’m assuming you’re male. Am I right?
(You remember how to watch his every move because he’s gorgeous, he’s gorgeous, he’s gorgeous—he’s luminous and warm, and you can’t tear your eyes away.)
I’d hold you tight against me. I’d feel your body, your entire body against me. Your flesh pressed against my flesh. It’d feel good, just knowing you’re there, in my arms. Then, I’d start moving against you.
“You’re not dead,” he finally says because he does not know what else he can tell Draco (because “I love you” and “You wanted me once” and “Could you still want me?” can never make it out of the cage of his teeth.)
spilling from his lips unbidden. He does not hold back. He does not try to protect himself. He gives himself entirely to Draco, and it’s reckless, and it’s glorious. And it’ll hurt him, oh it’ll ruin him entirely, it’ll hollow him out and it’ll burn him to the ground. By the time Draco’s done with him, he knows, he’ll be a shell of a human being, with sea-glass bones and armenian-paper skin, brittle and thin. Still, when Draco positions himself at the entrance of him, Harry fists his hands into his starlight hair and gazes into his storm-grey eyes, and whispers, “I want you. I want you. I want you.”
“I want to see you. Please, I want to see you,” he pleads, molten-metal eyes heavy-hot and resting on Harry’s skin.
“There will be difficult days, because neither you nor I are the kind of people who get to live happily ever after. We are always going to be the kind of people with cracks in their souls and bruises on their sense of self and there will be days when we’ll get swallowed by the dark until we can’t find a way out. But I want to hold your hand in the darkness until you find the light again, Draco. I will sit with you until you’re able to see again, if you’ll let me. And if you can love me for all that I am, for every scar the war left on my skin and every hole it left in my heart, I’ll give you everything else too. I’ll give you the infinite love that lives in my chest, and I’ll give you the early morning smiles, and the soft evening words, and everything in between too. I’ll give you everything, if you’ll have me, Draco.”
The ghosts must feel it too, and they begin to cheer and clap and laugh. Each and every one of them wants to congratulate Harry. There are questions too, and suggestions. Sœur Félicie wants Harry to know exactly how the place looked back in its heyday. She was the head caretaker, she tells Harry with pride. Made the floors gleam every morning and cleaned every window at least once a week. Before Harry can thank her, the ghost of a tall, slender woman in pressed trousers and a crisp shirt, wearing suspenders and holding a pipe informs Harry that she was an architect once and demands to see the plans. Harry answers every question, listens to every story and discusses the renovation plans with the architect for hours. By the time each ghost has had their say and bids Harry goodbye, he realises he’s alone in the room.
“I’m not gay,” you say, because you aren’t, are you? (And would he touch you again if you were? Would he call you love and gently brush his long fingers along the line of your jaw if you were? Your chest constricts with a painful kind of longing at the thought.)
His feet slowly tread the forest floor, where there are soft-worn roots and autumn crocuses. He doesn’t want to disturb either. There is an eerie sort of calm, here, and Harry knows the forest wants him. Loves him. Harry does not speak the language of the wind rustling in the leaves, but he knows it whispers reassurance in his hair all the same.
But you can’t, suddenly. You can’t. You can’t bear to hear ‘it’s only sex’ again. You can’t bear to be reminded that he doesn’t love you. And you know he’ll only ever give you the scraps, the unwanted crumbs of him. It hurts like an iron brand to the chest, and you keep coming back to it all the same. And it’s always so good, but it’s ever enough, is it? It’s never enough, and the black-ink void behind your ribs eats away at your liver and your spleen a little more each time, and when there’s nothing left of you anymore, what will you do then?
I love you. And I won’t stop telling you until you come back and kiss me. I won’t stop until you’ve told me that you don’t want me, and exactly why you suddenly don’t want me. Because I still want you, Draco. I still love you.
By the time Harry reaches the lighthouse, dawn has begun setting fire to the sky in earnest. Warm orange light is pooling in the crevices between the rocks and glittering softly on the crest of every wave. Harry could stay here his entire life, he thinks, stare out at the sea and the light kissing the water softly; he could calcify or solidify or turn to stone entirely. (He could be a part of this scenery, accepted and still, and not a boy standing on the verge of rejection like on the edge of a cliff, ready to jump and afraid of the fall.)
once looked. It might be a while, they said, until the plans were formally approved, but the renovation was respectful of the soul and the structure of the building, so they were confident approval would ultimately be delivered. Still, Harry felt oddly out of place in this bright meeting room in the historical city centre of Fribourg, where there was a river snaking between the grey-stone houses and high cliffs towering above him, but not a mountain in sight.
“Thank you, for helping out. I wouldn’t have been able to do it without you, and you really didn’t have to help, considering how things ended between us. I’m glad you agreed to help, though. I’m glad we’re doing this together.”
And you know you should get up from that bed. You know you should put your clothes on, and walk out of that door, and forget about this whole disaster of a night.
I don’t admit it to myself, but I feel unreasonably hurt at the thought he wouldn’t even kiss me to break the spell. It chafes uncomfortably with all my fears of being alone forever, all my doubts about my life.
The blond one came out today. Puttered in the prize roses for a while. Black-haired friend was nowhere to be seen. Very disappointed: would have liked another biscuit. I like those rather better than roots.
You try to offer a clumsy apology, you teeth catching on all the words. He doesn’t let you finish your sentence.
“I didn’t fight for you when we first broke up,” Harry continues as he slowly closes the gap between them, “and I didn’t fight for you in that hotel room either. I was so sick of fighting after the war, it was all I’d done my entire life, and though everyone kept telling me I’d won, I felt like I’d lost everything that mattered in the process. I was so sick of fighting, and I thought I could get away with not doing it ever again in my entire life. That was why I kept going to these galas, that was why the word
“Oh, you’re awake,” you say instead. Obvious observations, always a suave choice. Small wonder Draco hasn’t asked you to marry him yet with wit that sharp.
Still, that night, when he comes back to the inn, mud-covered and wet, disappointment is sharp as a needle in his chest. He thought he would have found Draco by now. He thought he would have an answer.
“I was there too. I remember it too. It’s unbearable tonight,” he does not add because you’re Aurors, and you’re professionals, and you’re not supposed to be affected by these things.
It was beautiful, inside, all solid oak floors and high ceilings and large windows that let light flood in. Harry walked slowly through all the rooms, his footsteps the only sound in the rich silence of the place. In one of the rooms, there were several ancient pianos; in another, the original art deco lamp still hung from the ceiling, all gleaming chrome and frosted glass. In the small chapel at the back of the building, the stained glass windows bathed him in vibrant hues of blue and red and gold, and he lay down on the flagstone floor with tears in his eyes and something fragile and precious like crystal inside his throat (tears or words or the feeling of coming home).
Under his fingers, Draco comes apart. The room fills with sounds of ecstasy (moans and whimpers and sighs.) “Let me come inside you,” Harry begs, his voice rough with pleasure and desire and anticipation all at once.
It’ll hurt, later, the way your broken edges cut into each other’s skins. You never think it won’t, because how could it not? But you offer everything you’re able to give all the same because he’s worth it. And he’ll tell you he loves you, months down the line, when you’re naked and satiated and still so very much in love. You’ll cry at the words. They’ll heal you, too. And in the soft darkness of your bedroom, you’ll listen to Draco’s sleep-rhythmic breaths and you’ll be so happy that you think your bones might break from the intensity of the feeling.
“I’ll save you,” he whispered to the star-high vaults of the ceilings. “I’ll love you with everything I have and you’ll never be empty again.”
“I feel like I’m drowning in the pressure of everything,” Harry told him when he didn’t ask. “I can’t even take wallpaper down and my own home hates me—how can I be expected to keep smiling at cameras and lie to everyone that I knew what I was doing in that forest and not actively trying to get myself killed. I know they need me to be their symbol of hope, I know they need me to tell them it wasn’t in vain, the pain and the loss and the grief. But I can’t! I can’t! I don’t even know it myself!”
“Yeah,” I say because I absolutely don’t, and give his hand a firm shake, “I can’t say I expected to find you here! Is this your shop?”
Every single feeling comes rushing back to you, and you feel your ribs fissuring at the tidal-wave impact of love and loss and longing. You reach out to him. You touch his hair. You need to know he's real. You need to know you're not imagining it entirely.
Harry raises his hand and cups Draco’s cheek. Draco’s still and soft under his fingers, shoulders trembling and hands clenched tight together. (The phantom-memory of their pain is heavy and throbbing in the air between them.)
After I’ve stared at my arm for a good quarter of an hour, I give up on the hope that any new writing will appear. So I take a pinch of floo powder, cast a glamour on myself and head into London’s Magical Library to elucidate the mystery of what the
“Harry.” Draco’s breath leaves a burn-humid trail on Harry’s collarbones. And Harry—falls apart in Draco’s arms.
Later that night, after they’ve gone back to their inn, Draco knocks on Harry’s door. He’s wearing the same soft cashmere sweater but he’s changed into a pair of flannel trousers and there is a certain domestic softness about it that fills the well of Harry’s chest with all sorts of dangerous feelings.
Up close, I can see the details she’s trying to hide behind her put-together facade—the sharp eyeliner highlights a redness in her eyes that belies too little sleep and too many tears; her hands are flat against the houndstooth fabric of her skirt, pressing just a little too hard onto her thighs, the finger joints just a little too white. Everything about her form is just a little too tense, the shoulders just a little too square underneath the soft pastel knit, her chin just a little too jutted. Whatever it is she thinks happened, she’s not coping very well at all.
“I want this building to look the exact way it did when it was first built,” Harry tells them. And: “I want it to be a place of beauty again, I want it to be a symbol of pride for the valley again, but most importantly, I want it to be a place for healing again.”
I smile at both of them. We’ll be okay, the three of us. We’ll be okay. We’ve always been okay, haven’t we? We’ve lived through so much and made it through to the other side, and we’ll just do it once again. We’ll do it as many times as we need to.
It took Harry a week of desperate hope and bitter disappointment to decide he needed to turn over a new leaf. A clean break, in a new place. Somewhere he could start putting himself back together.
Sometimes, something in Harry’s chest breaks and the world turns silent and grey. It never lasts, not really, and the loud brightness of reality always finds a way to open him up again like a sharp blade in an oyster shell. Still, in every single one of these grey instants, Harry goes back to the
But as August hung the sun high in the hot air of the sky, and as September drenched the cobbled street with rain and wind, Harry found that he couldn’t move on. Draco wrote that couldn’t either.
Harry doesn’t answer. Draco doesn’t stop watching the sunset, and Harry doesn’t stop watching Draco. Only when it is entirely dark, do they push themselves to their feet and walk back to their inn.
Harry bought a different kind of paint, then. Bought a primer, too. Painted the walls again, and again, and again, and every single time, the paint slid straight off the walls until Harry was at his wit’s end.
Pansy’s quiet for a little while. She stares at your face with think-serious eyes, like you’ve somehow written hidden answers in the lines around your eyes or the skin of your cheeks. You stare at your knees and the floor and you try not to tell her how certain you are that he’s the one.
“Potter,” Draco replies in a voice that sounds like granite or gravel, and Harry feels his dry-clay heart fissure behind his ribs.
There were days that stuck to Harry’s skin like tar, dark and sticky and pungent. There were days that wormed their way into his heart until he thought his entire bloodstream was poisoned with the terrible feeling of never being enough (mercury ran through his veins, then, dazzling as love and deadly as loneliness.) And slowly, like sand trickling through in an hourglass, it became too much.
. She worked on schools and sacred sites in eastern Namibia, but I think I might be able to apply her framework to your house since it was a hospital once.
Draco’s still sleeping when you wake up. You feel wrong-footed, waking up in his home. (In his room. In his bed.) You stand up, carefully. You slip on your clothes. He doesn’t need to know you were here, you decide. He doesn’t need to know you didn’t go yesterday, doesn’t need to know you spent the night in his bed.
“I’ve been drugged,” she declares, standing in front of my desk with her arms crossed and her manicured fingers pressed tight on to the baby-blue cashmere of her sweater.
“Can you hear me, Draco?” Harry asks in a futile attempt at dispelling the memory, his dry-twigs fingers stiff on Draco’s shoulder. “Listen, you’re not dead. You’re not dead.” (On Harry’s tongue, the words taste like grief all the same.)
Blond-haired came out and started yelling too. Then, he read the piece of paper and yelled some more, but not at black-haired friend anymore. (Side note: I would not like to be Pansy, the cow, the bitch, the traitor, who will die many painful deaths.)
and Harry’s filled with pleasure so bright that Harry thinks his lighthouse heart must light up the entire room—the entire city even. The entire country, perhaps. So he does not die, and he does not stop moving inside Draco, he does not stop turning into a beacon of hope and pleasure and he does not stop calling out Draco’s name.
The words dance around Harry’s ears like angry wasps, maddening and terrifying all at once. This can’t be happening, not now, not when they had finally found each other again. (Not when Draco held him and touched him and kissed him. Not when Draco finally told him he loved him after years of silence. Not now, not now not now.)
“One thing I remember is that Father received regular owls from this apothecary. It didn’t strike me as strange at the time, but then again I was being courted by a man and didn’t think it was strange either. It’s not his regular apothecary, though, and I’ve never heard the name before. He still buys his headache potions from the same place he always did, so it’s not that he’s changed shops. It’s not much to go on, and it doesn’t prove anything, but it’s the best I can give you.”
When you finally get home, after a long talk with Nicholas and too much paperwork, you close the door gently behind you.
“I know.” Harry huffs a dry little laugh. “We both were. Not easy living through a war before you’re even properly an adult, is it? It broke me, but you were broken too. You shouldn’t have been expected to fix me.”
You wake in your bed with vague memories of Apparating home and drinking your way through an entire bottle of elf-made wine. You don’t even register the headache that’s splitting your skull open; all you can feel is the unbearable sense of loss, crawling all over your skin like a million small, black spiders. Being alive is being on fire, and it is enough pain to make you start screaming right now and not stop for years.
Tears roll down Draco’s delicate cheeks. The salt-wetness of them kisses your fingers, and you don’t know what it means. You want to wipe the wetness away, want to soothe the sadness away, but you’re not entirely certain he’d let you. You’re not entirely certain where you stand at all, and your anxious-wait heart sends blood crashing against your ribs in frantic waves.
Draco hums and moans around him, and Harry turns into the earth or the sky, something vast and impossible and all-encompassing. Everything about him is burning, burning, burning under Draco’s pleasure-spit touch. His nerve endings light up like sparks. He turns into a constellation. He can’t think. He can’t breathe. There’s nothing else here but him, and Draco, and the natural-disaster pleasure unfurling in his chest. (A flood. A forest fire. A hurricane or an earthquake.) He’s going to come. He’s going to come with Draco touching him, stroking him, sucking him—and then it’ll be over, he remembers.
“Then tell me what you need, Draco,” you whisper against the crook of his neck because you know he’s broken too. Because you know it won’t be easy, being with Draco Malfoy. You know there are fissures running along his bones too, cracks on his heart and bruises on his skin, and you’re going to have to learn how to love him in ways that don’t hurt him.
“And it’s not like that—I mean, yes. I know. We broke up. But you’re still the only person that might be able to help. I tried the bonding ritual, you know? It didn’t work. The house rejected me. No one had any idea of what went wrong. I’m not trying to get you back or anything weird, I swear. I just really need you to help me figure out what’s wrong.”
“I am, actually,” I lie, and it is my first mistake. “I can feel a terrible headache coming on and I really can’t afford to take the time off this afternoon.”
“I want you inside me,” he says, his quicksilver eyes burning with a beautiful sort of passion. “I want to feel you, I want to be yours. Oh for tonight, just for tonight, I want to be yours.”
Fistfuls of bramble cut Harry’s hands with their thorns as the rain peppers cold kisses down his neck and weighs his woollen sweater down. It hurts, and it is cold, and every inch of Harry’s skin sings with pain. Still, it hurts less than remembering that he loved Draco (than remembering Draco never really loved him back.)
“You will explain to me exactly what this is about, Potter,” she demands, all high heels and sharp nails. “And if you even think about hurting Draco more than you already have, so help me, Potter, I will end you.”
“That’s bollocks,” Draco answered immediately in his knife-like voice (Harry only was beginning to be familiar with it then.) “You suffered more than all of them put together, and still they expect you to dance in front of them like a trained monkey. They did nothing to support you, Harry. This entire year, they did nothing but go on with their own little lives, leaving you behind to cope with all the wounds of the war. You owe them nothing.”
“I… What? How do you know? Did he tell you that? He’s never said it to me. Wait, no. It’s not that he’s never said it. It’s that he kept repeating he wasn’t in love. Every time, Pansy. Every time we met, he’d say it. Again and again and again. He's never once given me a hint he liked me at all, and... it hurt. Every time.”
Fuck you. Fuck you for making me feel like I do. Fuck you for making it impossible for me not to love you when you went and rejected me. Rejected me, Harry. Do you have any idea how that feels? I loved you so much. I loved you. I still do. I can’t stop loving you. [words angrily traced.]
Draco snaps, at those words, kissing you with so much violence there’s the taste of blood on your tongue. You’re incandescent with want. He sees you, he knows who you are. He’ll show you your place, he’ll force you to be everything you are, everything you don’t want others to see in you. He pulls at your dress robes, his caresses leave raised-red streaks on your chest. You moan and whimper under him.
“Oh, of course not,” Malfoy spits, his grey eyes unreadable and cold. “How would it look to the wizarding world, their saviour liking to be fucked by other men? You’re supposed to marry your childhood sweetheart and breed little hero sprogs to keep up morale, isn’t that right?”
It’s the first time he’s been this forward with me. This honest. We’ve always danced around the issue of our attraction to each other before.
You wave a gentle cleansing spell over him, and you lie down against his body. You pull the duvet over your body. (It smells like him.) You listen to him breathe deeply in the dark silence of the room and you pretend that you have this. That you have him. You don’t move. You don’t cry.
“Go be disgustingly cute somewhere else, girls,” someone yells from the other side of the room. Iris promptly gives them the fingers; the space fills with jeers and laughter.
Draco is standing in the corridor outside your office and every minute detail of the night before comes rushing back to you—the fear and the want, the shame and the recklessness, too.
“Please, Draco,” he tries again as he’s led through the ancient corridors. “I know it’s a bad time, I know it was always going to be a bad time, but I’m really just asking you to take a look at this house. Just this. Fix it for me, and you’ll never have to see my face again. Please, Draco. Please.”
“No, you were right. It did hurt, but you were right. You had all that weight on your shoulders and I didn’t want to hear about it. You tried to tell me what you were going through, you tried to make me understand, and I didn’t want to listen. I wanted you to be happy again, and I wanted it to happen without having to do any of the work of supporting you. I’m sorry, Harry. I really am.”
“I loved you, you know,” Harry half-whispers half-sobs. Draco’s fingers are still on his wrists, and Harry hopes they stay there forever. “I loved you more than anything, Draco. It scared me, sometimes, how much I loved you. I would have done anything for you. I’m sorry it was never enough, this love. I’m sorry I couldn’t be what you needed. But I loved you, and I loved you, and I loved you until it bled me completely dry. That’s why I ran. That’s why I didn’t tell you where I went, didn’t go back to break up with you. I loved you to the breaking point, and I loved you beyond that even, and one day, it was finally too much and I realised I had fallen apart long ago and had simply refused to accept it. I had to run to build myself back together, you understand? It wasn’t that I didn’t love you—it was that I loved you too much for too long and I had to remember how to be loved as well.”
“I can’t believe you came for me,” Draco continues, “you complete madman. Oh, you reckless idiot. Oh, you came for me. You came for me. Oh, I love you, I love you, I love you.” (Harry lets the words drip all over his skin, warm and sweet like honey.)
Draco closes his eyes, a quick, tight motion that would escape Harry entirely if he hadn’t known Draco’s body as well as he knew his own once. Then, he lets out a brittle laugh that sounds like dry clay crumbling or like china breaking and not like a laugh at all.
“There are some ghosts who aren’t the nicest to have around. Mrs Golay, for instance, has failed to learn how to shut up for a single second in the past ninety years she’s been here, and I wouldn’t want to compare her voice to nails on a blackboard but—no, it absolutely sounds the same. Mrs Brodard is awfully racist too. Some of us who died young and tried to keep up with the world as it moved forward have been trying to teach her not to use slurs, but it’s an uphill battle with her. What I’m saying is, they’re not all like me, young and hip and fun. Some of them are… lacking in the human decency and social graces department.” She pauses. “We’d still want them to stay, though!”
Have changed my mind about the black-haired one. When I decided to climb up his leg, he did not swing me all dizzy and throw me over the fence. Instead, he gave me a biscuit. He said some things about a man named Draco who would not listen to him. The biscuit was very good so I did not bite him.
