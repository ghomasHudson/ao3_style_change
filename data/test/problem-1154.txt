“It was fine, really. The primary source was this really interesting book about Muggle- Wizard/Witches relations, I can lend it to you if you like… or not, I don’t know. But, Harry, I’m sorry about earlier.” Seeing Hermione so perturbed about Harry’s feelings produced a small warmth in his chest and they walked back to the table to join their laughing, debating or just really
but Harry found himself unable to breath evenly. A feeling of nausea was settling in his stomach, forcing him to concentrate on his breath even more. What the
Everyone was still faintly surprised at the sight of Blaise and Neville when Luna jerked to her right, pulling Ginny into a kiss. “No way”, Ron whispered, grinning from ear to ear. Harry watched as his ex-girlfriend smiled at Luna kissing her once again. The two of them smiled radiantly and sat upright again, now sitting a little closer to each other than before.
A lot of embarrassment later (Draco had stepped out of the little corner while Harry was already talking to the customer, lips swollen and hair a mess) and said customer had started grinning.
"It obviously was for you", Draco replied and that same paint expression was on his face again. Harry noticed that Draco's hands were shaking.
“Potter, are you there?”,the voice he’d been hoping to hear all day was filling the small space of the videothek. Harry had already heard the bell when it had chimed, but didn’t get up immediately. So here he was, still kneeling on the floor behind the counter, various videotapes in his hands. Awkwardly, he rose from the ground, his face flushed. “Am I interrupting something? Some intimate videotape-sorting activity?”, Draco teased. Harry looked up to meet his gaze and saw that the Blonde was smiling one of his genuine smiles again. “Your sense of humour never fails to amaze me”, Harry said in a dry tone, but he, too, was smiling. “It shall never cease to do so”, Draco continued in an affectedly posh voice, an eyebrow raised. He took two tiny steps so that he was standing closer to the counter and silently pulled the movie out from somewhere of the apparently prodigious space inside his robe. “Thanks again”, he said.
His eyes wandered to the other empty chair, which was clearly occupied, a leather jacket placed on the back of the chair. His pulse seemed to accelerate since he knew whose jacket it was. “Better late than never, ay, mate?”Seamus nudged him playfully. Harry turned to look at him and gave him a wide grin. “Could have sworn we said 8”, he muttered under his breath. The vacant chair on the opposite end of the table made him gittery, he knew it was time for a drink.
“How awfully chivalrous of you, Golden Boy. See you”.
"Thanks for the food, guys. I'll call you if something happens". Harry left the building, still feeling quite nauseated. Hermione had suspected it. Why didn't she tell him? Why was that certain piece of information about Malfoy of such importance to him?
The next morning Harry woke up earlier than usual and made his way to the kitchen for a much needed dose of caffeine. It was empty, possibly due to the early hour and Harry decided to sit down at the kitchen counter on a high-stool and went through one of the many crosswords Asteria left lying around. He really didn't know what he had expected when he heard the room to Draco's door being opened but he really didn't think the blonde would approach the kitchen aisle, grab a cup of coffee and vanish back to his room without even looking at Harry.
Harry’s face suddenly got very warm. “Sorry, I always thought that this abbreviation sounds cute. Pansy uses it sometimes”
They fell into a silence, whether it was uncomfortable or not, Harry could not decide but inhaling the smoke coming from their cigarettes felt oddly pleasant.
"Harry, mate, there's someone on the phone for you", Francis called from across the apartment. Harry hurried towards the phone in the hall, leaving the pile of laundry he'd been folding the Muggle way behind. "Hello?"
“Alright, who’s next, then?”, Harry asked. Theoretically, it would have been Blaise’s turn to pick someone, seeing that his mouth was preoccupied, though, Dean took the initiative and asked Ron to either tell the group about his secret fetish (implying he had one) or try the
"Then let's make it"
"Are you busy?"
Harry decided that he was in desperate need for a cup of tea and poured water in the water boiler, patiently waiting for it to start cooking. He rummaged in their tea box situated on one of the marble shelves on the wall. He decided to go with chamomile, a calming and soothing tea for body and mind as Luna always told him. There was a clicking of a door in a lock coming from.. oh, perfect. "Are you making tea, Potter?", Malfoy asked as if the next reasonable step after announcing your support of the villain of the decade was to ask someone whether they were making tea. "Such a good observer", Harry muttered sarcastically. "Would you mind if I used some of that water?". Malfoy was slowly approaching the kitchen, as if he'd burn himself if he did without asking for permission first. "Whatever, Malfoy", answered Harry, joined by the feeling in the pit of his stomach once again. Harry took out a mug and just before he wanted to close the cup-shelf, he took out another, carefully sliding it over to where his new flatmate was standing. After putting the teabag in his mug, he poured the now boiling water into it. Just before he could flee the room, Malfoy let out an exasperated sound. "Potter, you can't just pour the water into the cup. I'm sorry, but you just can't". His tone wasn't mean or anything, still it made Harry want to punch him. "Well, believe me or not, but I just did".
"Counting stars? That's what you do when you avoid my eyes, then", Draco teased.
Determined to show no signs of weakness, Draco bit on his inner cheek, trying to ignore his shaky fingers and more importantly, Potter. When he had unlatched the belt buckle, he proceeded to pull the belt out of the belt loops in one fast, swift motion. And then it happened: he saw Potter flinch. It was such a minor movement, yet Draco suddenly was fully aware of the effect his hand working on the Gryffindor’s trousers had. Feeling bold, Draco brushed his pinky slightly over the other boy’s crotch when moving towards the fly. Draco took his time as he worked on the zipper, pulling it down in an excruciatingly slow manner, when he noticed another small flinch in Potter’s nether parts.
.”, Luna stated, eyeing the phial expectantly. “Well, well, well. I’m thrilled”, Blaise countered while he filled a glass with the bottle of firewhiskey, carefully adding a small drop of the silvery liquid in the phial. “How does this work, though? Does the drinker feel a physical urge to kiss the person they desire or does it merely reveal the person to them?”, Hermione enquired, biting her lip in a worried manner. “To be honest, Granger, I haven’t got the faintest idea.”, Blaise conceded, grinning mischievously. “How exciting!”, Luna exclaimed.
But as fulfilling as it was to see Ron in his element, Harry still couldn’t help but think about Tuesday night for hours every day. He’d been so sure they were both so happy something finally happened between them, and still Draco had left. Almost as if Harry was someone he just casually, occasionally saw. Well, maybe he was.
„Thanks“, Harry said lamely since he was not able to put into words what he was feeling.
Harry feigned a laugh and said: “Pansy made me do it” and with that, the beautiful smile on the Blonde’s face vanished.
“Okay, Harry”.
“Yet”
“Thanks so much for doing this, Harry, you’re the best”
Draco smiled, yet it was a different kind of smile. The carefreeness had vanished, the poise evaporated. This one reminded Harry of one of his own smiles, a tired one, one that was so desperately trying to convince people of the okayness of it all.
“I’m sure. Normally, you’d need an account here at the videothek but you can rent it in my name”.
“Wait”, Hermione intercepted, “before it’s your turn, Malfoy, I feel like I should reveal how the potion works”. Encouraged by the anticipating looks she got, she continued:”I think it works like that: The surer you are that your feelings are reciprocated, the faster you will kiss the person. Ron, for example, was sure I have feelings for him, too. Luna, however, wasn’t.” “That makes sense, Granger”, Blaise said and Hermione couldn’t help but feel elated and, frankly, excited to see how sure Malfoy was about his crush’s feelings...
Draco smiled at her, looking pleased, consequently shooting Potter a daring look. “Scared, Potter?”.
“Exactly. Yes. So inane”
"Is that a  problem? Are you scared he will force you out of that ridiculous abstinence thing?", Francis smiled. "What? No! Francis, I don't think you understand. I once literally slit his whole torso open during one of our fights." "But not intentionally, right? Did a spell or something go wrong?", Francis enquired, still not fully grasping the intricacies of this whole magic thing that Harry had explained to him over a cup of tea two months ago (a lot of tea was spilled and choked on during Harry's explanation). "I didn't know what the spell would do but I definitely intended to hurt him, Francis. He's the last person to lure me out of my abstinence"
“Will a Mojito do?”, the bartender asked, clearly amused by Harry’s lack of knowledge. Harry just nodded and returned to the table to carefully place the cocktail next to Draco’s Firewhiskey.
Sunday morning, Harry thought about their conversation 80% of the time. Lunch, it had increased to 85%, at dinner he didn’t even remember what it was like not to think about Draco Malfoy. It was night when a more urgent matter pressed him: Tomorrow he would have to take over the department. He still hadn’t told Ron and he still had no idea how to go on about the matter.
But to his disappointment, Draco only nodded and said: “Goodnight, then, Potter”.
Work in the Auror Department stretched across his days in the old, suffocating way. Ron’s Quidditch jokes remained the same, Willinger’s requests still were unnecessary and absolutely tedious. Harry didn’t know what he had expected when he had followed Ron and many others from Hogwarts into the Ministry, but it certainly didn’t look like this.
“And what? And I’m not someone you would like to be serious with? I’m not good enough to be that constant in your life?”
"There's no in between when it comes to you two"
"So, Harry, Draco tells me you went to school together. He also mentioned that you weren't particularly fond of each other". "We fought all the time, yeah", Harry replied. "'Bout what? Girls?",Francis joked, hoping to elicit a small smile out of Harry. "What's so funny?", Harry asked, confused again. He had told Asteria and Francis that after his fling with Ginny, he wanted to take a break from dating for at least a few months, adding with a blush creeping up his cheeks that he "wouldn't mind dating a bloke after the break, either". "Oh shoot, I thought I had mentioned it yesterday. But Draco and I met at a gay bar".
Draco’s acquiescence made Harry’s heart beat faster. And after twenty long minutes, Draco was standing at his door asking: “Just as a matter of interest, did you correct her?”. Hary just grinned and apparated them straight to Sarah’s doorstep.
“A baby bath? Or something like that. It was so mundane, the name almost instantly slipped my mind”
“How long does this take to work, Zabini? George didn’t tell me when he mentioned the
“Draco”
“Yes, but why would I call you Harry when I want something from you? Where’s the fun in that?”
friends- well, minus one: Draco wasn’t at the table when Hermione and Harry returned.
“Sorry, you probably don’t care. I don’t know why I said that. It’s just.. you see me for me, not for the prodigy everyone else thinks I am. I just thought..”
“Well- I.. Because you just left! You had your fun and just left me standing there”
“Potter, I know it’s Friday but I need to see you. My office in ten”, Willinger announced on Friday afternoon, just as Harry was making his way towards the fire network at the exit of the Ministry. Caught up in his thoughts, he’d almost missed Willinger completely and had run past him, but not quite. Unfortunately. He thought about what this talk could be about. Yes, he’d been late four out of five days this week and no, he hadn’t worked over the small errors Willinger had found in his report. Sure, his enthusiasm was lacking, his sleep-schedule was fucked and his emotions were sent on a total rollercoaster at least three times a day, especially today, now that he’d see Draco again tomorrow night, but being unemployed was something he didn’t want to add to his pile.
Harry was perplexed. He couldn’t process this right now, not with Draco leaning in their alcove the way he did, not with him as close to him as he was.
Harry stood, not knowing what to say. He accepted the cup and opened the plastic lid. A whiff of honey-scented milk filled his nose.
. Yes, it is indeed a Weasley product. It requires the drinker to kiss the person they fancy the most”, he made a dramatic pause while gazing around the group of Eight Years. Since the beginning of the new year, a small group of students had been meeting up every Saturday evening in their new shared common room  to “overcome differences”, as Hermione put it. Who would have thought this implied snogging whoever’s closest.
Alright, this was something Harry could manage. Out of the hundreds of movies he had seen throughout his life, he surely could come up with one that would please the three of them. It had all started out when he was living with the Dursleys. When he was sent to his room after dinner, he tried to sneak back into the living room as often as possible. His Invisibility Cloak came in handy in the Dursley’s living room almost as often as in the corridors of Hogwarts. The movie choices had always been the quite obvious, popular ones, like Disney movies for Dudley and later dense comedies for Petunia and Vernon. No matter how bad the picture, Harry had always been fascinated by the art that is filmmaking. Then later, once he got his own place, movies were what distracted him from his insomnia, placated him after a nightmare and enabled him to have a ugly-crying-session whenever he felt like it. So this should be easy, right?
The young Malfoy awkwardly waved at him with a huge smile on his lips and quickly walked away from the man, feeling like a complete fool, but a happy one. He really liked Harry and was thrilled about the idea of going out with him. He couldn't wait to owl Pansy, his best friend about this, she was going to be so jealous.
“Malfoy, you’re gay, why the fuck would you care?”
However, the mood was ruined when someone accidentally bumped into them, and as they were separated, something seemed to snap in Draco. His eyes became dark, he clenched his fists. He took a step back and stared at Harry like he’d seen a ghost.
“Shut up, Malfoy.”
arrived pretty quickly, and so did all of its changes. Hermione’s parents had fully regained their memory a few days prior and she had moved back in with them for the end of summer break, since they needed someone to look after them to make sure their state of mind was stable, and she had missed them a lot. Ron was going to move in with George since it’d be easier for work, and Harry was thinking about moving out as well, but he didn’t really know where. The only place he could think of was Grimmauld Place.
tw: mentions of suicidal thoughts and self harm at the end of the chapter
“Yeah, fine. I just hate having all of this attention on me.” Harry signed and Ron patted his shoulder, an understanding smile on his lips.
“Oh come on Potter, did you really not put your name in the Goblet of Fire? Like, for real?”
The Malfoy nodded and followed Harry to a table next to the big windows. They had a nice view on the gigantic streets of London. Draco loved the city, he lived nearby and spent most of his free-time in the muggle streets and places of London. He wasn't fond of Hogsmead, the Diagon Alley or even the Leaky Cauldron. He hated the whispers about his father. He had nothing to do with him, he was completely different, he was never a Death Eater, never did anything wrong, never acted for the Dark Lord. He thought it was pretty unfair how wizards treated him just because of his name.
Draco laughed – a genuine one again – and laid down as well on his own bed.
“Come on, mate. It didn’t bother you during the ball.”
“If you do this, Malfoy, I might have to murder you in your sleep.” The brunette yelled back, laughing.
“Of course.”
Harry took a last drag out of his cigarette before vanishing it with a flick of his wand.
“Everything is weird with us, Potter, in case you didn’t notice. We’ve been enemies since we were literal children because you rejected my friendship, we argued every time we saw each other in the halls at school, you tried to murder me in sixth year, I wanted to give you up to the man who wanted to kill you, and then you defended me at my trial. Honestly, I wouldn’t be surprised if you came here and beat me up and then professed your undying love and devotion to me.”
smart.”
“Of course I wanted to speak with you. I mean…” Harry took a drag of his cigarette, the smoke in his lungs and alcohol running through his veins giving him courage. “I thought we were starting to become friends.”
Ever since he had left Hogwarts after the final battle, Harry felt like nothing had meaning anymore. He had been raised – no, used – for the past seven years as a toy. An object. A weapon. He had been raised to be a weapon of war and now that it was over, what was he supposed to do? He didn’t know anything else. Destroying the horcruxes, killing Voldemort. That’s all he had been thinking about for a year and a half. And now it was done. What was he supposed to do with himself? Who even was he?
Malfoy looked up at him, nodding.
His nights consisted of night terrors, waking up in a cold sweat, insomnia, falling asleep again, and repeat. His days consisted of this sad, mourning face staring back at him in the mirror. Harry was staying at Hogwarts during the reconstruction. Professor McGonagall had told him to stay with the Weasleys, to take care of that later, to get some time off. But he didn’t want that. He didn’t want to stay with the family who mourned over their dead son, or brother, or twin. He needed to stay occupied. Or else he would go down in a spiral of self-hatred and guilt. So, everyday, he woke up, forced himself to eat something, and worked. He worked on restoring the castle, on giving it back its grandeur until he couldn’t feel his body anymore. Then, he would force himself to eat something again, and go back to sleep in the temporary dorm Professor McGonagall had set up on the grounds. It was sad. But it was all he could bring himself to do. He had to feel useful. Everyday, the few people who decided to stay at the castle to work on the restorations looked at him with admiration, and it only made him want to bury himself underground. What was there to admire? He didn’t save the world because he was brave. He saved the world because it was the thing he had been programmed to do since he had first gotten there when he was an 11-year-old child.
“Yeah, because a lot of people were there. But that’s different. We already have enough Slytherins here-”
“Is that code for kidnapping me?”
“Hey.” He said, taking out another cigarette. One more couldn’t hurt. “Where’s Angie?”
Since it was Harry’s first time alone at Andromeda’s house, he had been a bit nervous. He didn’t really know what they were going to talk about, and he was afraid things would be awkward, but the night went by so fast. After spending some time with Teddy and getting him to sleep, they ate dinner and Harry had a really great time. Andromeda was such an interesting woman, she had so many fascinating stories about her years at Hogwarts, her insane family, Sirius, Tonks. They talked for hours, and the conversations they had were sometimes hard, but she never once gave Harry the time to get sad. Andromeda was one of the strongest, most interesting and funniest people Harry had ever met. And it was clear she had been raised with Draco’s mother – she had the same posh ways to talk and carry herself as he did.
“No, it’s… We met accidentally one night, at a club, and we talked a lot after that.” Harry said, trying to keep as much detail as possible to himself. He didn’t want to tell them about the sort of vacation they’d had together. That was a story for later.
The blonde man was walking so fast he was almost running, and as Harry followed him, he realized where he was going. The Astronomy Tower. Of course he was, the dramatic prick. He climbed up the stairs behind Draco.
Ron knew very well that the two had broken up, but since he wasn’t always the most sensitive when it came to this type of stuff, he probably didn’t realize how uncomfortable his question could’ve seemed. Thankfully, since Harry and Ginny were still good friends, they didn’t mind. Harry laughed as Ginny reached over the table to punch her brother’s shoulder.
“Oh, please. You’re too Gryffindor for that.” Draco rolled his eyes.
. And for a dance. He didn’t even know how to dance.
“What?”
The young man was surprised by his own confidence, but he really wanted that kiss. He wanted to know that these weren't just words to make him feel better.
“Go ahead.” Draco said, putting his hands in the pockets of his robes. “I’ll wait here for a bit.”
“What are you doing here?”
Harry’s best friend gave him a sad smile, but she didn’t push it. She knew she couldn’t make him change his decision, and she had to respect it, even if she didn’t like it. So she changed the subject instead.
He looked around and calmed down slightly as he watched the decorations in the Great Hall, that had been transformed into a ballroom for the occasion. It had never looked so splendid, not even for the Yule Ball. There were chandeliers floating all around the room, giving it a beautiful gold lighting, and the ceiling was a velvety black colour, dotted with stars. The five tables had disappeared, leaving only round tables encircling a dance-floor. There were already a few people sitting and chatting, and Harry’s eyes caught sight of silky platinum blonde hair that he could’ve recognized among millions of others.
thank you for reading and happy new years! this chapter is a bit shorter but i had to cut it there. sorry for the slow updates, it's exam season and i'm super busy, but after jan 12th i'll be able to update more regularly<3
“The Prophet-”
“We have lost too much in the past few years as dark forces took over our world. We’ve had to fight and make hard choices. Our youngest students have lost a part of themselves they will never be able to get back – their innocence. Some of us have had to choose between our families and what was right, which is something no child should ever have to do.” She glanced at Draco’s table as she said those words. “And no matter the wrong choices some of us might have made – I have no doubt in my heart when I say that I am so proud of all of you, because we are now all standing here together, united.
Draco had went shopping for the big date and had his meticulously picked out outfit laying on the bed in front of him. He was completely naked and just staring at it, suddenly seeing all the flaws it had. What if Harry thought it was hideous? What if he didn't even come to the date? What if he only agreed to make fun of him?
“You did not just tell me I have a lack of survival instinct. I’m the bloody Saviour-Of-The-Entire-World. Don’t forget my title.”
“Potion-brewer? I always thought you’d want to be a magical historian or something.”
“Wait.” Harry said, and when Draco turned to him, he presented his hand for the blonde to shake. The parallel was striking. “I offer an official truce and civil relationship. And maybe a blossoming friendship if you’ll have it.” He offered Draco one of his rare sincere smiles.
Ginny put her hand on top of Luna’s, squeezing it. Harry didn’t really pay attention to the gesture, he knew how girls could be with their friends, they were most of the time much more touchy than boys.
“And you like dudes who won’t hesitate to have sex in club bathrooms. Honestly, Malfoy, that’s just unsanitary.”
“Don’t forget a stupid Gryffindor was better than you in potions in sixth year.” Harry retorted, smiling.
“You know what? I believe you now. I should’ve guessed you weren’t smart enough for that.”
Harry chuckled.
Although Harry was rather alarmed by Draco’s revelations, he didn’t show it and just gave him a comforting smile.
At around 8am, his door opened and Ron peaked his head inside, a small smile on his lips. He was clearly very tired and looked skinnier than usual. Harry got up and Ron pulled him into a fierce hug, not saying anything. He didn’t need to.
again, sorry for the late update! i hope you enjoyed this chapter<3 ily
“You know, I have some time before going back to the Ministry…”
“Could be better. I’m… Trying to keep it together. It’s hard at home, I don’t blame you for not coming with us. It used to be so cheery all the time and now not a day goes by without someone pronouncing his name and bursting into tears. But it’s going to be alright, we just have to – put on a brave face and… Go on with our lives. For him.” Ginny’s voice cracked at these words but she quickly regained her composure, as she always did. She never let anyone see her cry. Ever.
Ron and George were quietly discussing the upcoming reopening of the shop, and Harry couldn’t help but notice how empty George looked compared to before the war. Compared to before he lost his twin. He was putting on a brave face, smiling every now and then, but his eyes looked lifeless. It was heartbreaking. Harry hadn’t always been such an attentive person, but spending time with Draco had made him learn to look between the lines, since the only way to know what the man was really feeling was to watch him. Apparently, he hadn’t been so attentive since he hadn’t noticed Draco seemingly wanted more than just a buddy from him.
“Harry! I’m so happy you came. Come on, we saved you a seat.”
Part of the reason why they didn’t really do anything about it was because this whole trip didn’t even feel like real life. They were spending time together, two old enemies, in beautiful cities, away from all of the drama, the rumours, the attention, the hatred, the hurt. It all felt so surreal, but so natural. Like it was all meant to be, and everything they had been through had led them to this for a reason.
Harry laughed and gave Draco a small slap on the arm.
dates, and Harry was glad to see they’d finally admitted their feelings for one another. Everyone knew something had been going on between the two of them for years, except for them. Ginny joined Luna, and George met with Angelina, who he had been seeing on and off for a while. Everyone they walked past, whether he was familiar with them or not, gave Harry some sort of acknowledgement, a nod, a smile, and their eyes gleamed with admiration, which was pretty irritating since most of them had looked at him like he was insane during a lot of his time at Hogwarts, but he didn’t want to let this ruin his night.
“I’m not talking about the castle, I’m talking about the students.” Draco interrupted, sighing in obvious frustration. “I’ve received a letter from a very upset Pansy about how everyone is being arseholes to the Slytherins. Not just her – she’s a bitch, she kind of deserves it. But the little ones too. And I was wondering if…” Draco bit down on his lips, seeming a bit nervous. “I was wondering if you could do me a small favour.”
“Are you going to insinuate that I’m secretly in love with you every single time we talk? It’s getting old, mate.” Harry said, sighing.
Going back wasn’t easy. As Harry looked around, he noticed nearly every shop held so many memories. Madam Puddifoot’s Tea Shop, where he’d had a disastrous first (and last) date with Cho in fifth year. Honeydukes, where him, Ron and Hermione went every time they came to Hogsmeade to buy tons of sweets. The Hog’s Head, where they’d had the first Army of Dumbledore meeting, and where Aberforth had protected them when they came back right before the final battle to go look for the remaining horcruxes. The Three Broomsticks, where they’d go drink butterbeer, chat, where Harry had discovered Sirius was his godfather, and in front of which Harry and Dumbledore had apparated after getting the fake horcrux and before the man’s death. Zonko’s joke shop, where they’d always buy stuff to pull pranks on each other. The Shrieking Shack, where Harry had first met Sirius, had learned that he was innocent, that Scabbers was Pettigrew, and that Remus was a werewolf. It brought back so many memories, both happy and heartbreaking. But he had loved this place dearly for many years, had broken so many rules just to go there in third year, and coming back still felt like coming home after a long day.
As they went back to the hotel, they were joking around a bit, and talking about the places they had visited during the day, Draco going on and on about muggle architecture being much less mediocre than he thought. He discovered new things about muggles everyday, which made Harry think about himself when he had first arrived to the wizarding world. He was amazed at so many things, just like Draco was now that he was learning so much about muggle architecture, literature and technology. It was sweet.
Harry was so lost in thought he ran into someone who was walking towards him in the long hallway leading to the courtroom.
Draco was so lost in his thoughts he didn't notice Harry coming towards him, and bumped so hard into him he almost fell down. He blushed and looked up at him.
The blonde man got back up and turned to Harry with a malicious smirk on his face, a bottle of Ogden’s Old Firewhisky in one hand, and a bottle of muggle vodka in the other. Harry laughed, and summoned two tall glasses with his wand. This was going to be a fun night.
“This is the best birthday ever!” Harry screamed.
Yours sincerely,
“I’m going out to eat. Unlike you, I don’t fancy staying in bed all day and I need to eat to function. I don’t know if the Boy Who Lived’s body works differently but mine needs some food, or else I’ll die.”
“You’re the Chosen One, Potter, everybody knows when your birthday is. We’re going out tonight and I’m paying for drinks, I wouldn’t want to upset the Saviour on his birthday, or else I’m going to get Howlers from all of the readers of Witch Weekly.”
“Happy birthday.” Draco said as midnight came, smiling at Harry. Before the brunette could even realize what was happening, the blonde had two hands on his hips, and his lips on Harry’s. Whether it was because of the alcohol or something else, Harry kissed him back, wrapping his arms around Draco’s neck. He was in a total daze, not thinking of anything except for the soft lips kissing him, the warm tongue against his mouth. He pressed his body against Malfoy’s, wanting the moment to last forever. He felt invincible.
If Harry hadn’t been on their little trip with Malfoy, he would’ve never defended the Slytherins, but spending time with him had made him realize why they’d behaved the way they did in Hogwarts. Yes, Pansy was a bitch and she’d tried to sell him to Voldemort, and Harry didn’t like her, but he’d realized she’d only reacted like this to protect her friends. And Harry probably would’ve done the same if it meant protecting the people he loved.
“I spoke in his favour at his trial. And McGonagall wouldn’t have invited them if she thought they were dangerous.” Harry sighed. “We’ve been fighting for too long, guys.”
This will be an intense week but I hope you will be able to testify at each one. Please owl me back to confirm your presence.
“You alright, mate?” Ron asked.
“It’s fine, professor. I’ll do it. It’s just a week.”
“I don’t really know yet. I think I’m going to take some time to figure things out. And I’m sure Professor McGonagall would let me come take my NEWTs as an external candidate or something. But I really don’t feel like being a student for a whole year again.”
He arrived to the biggest courtroom of the Department, where all the important trials took place, and took his seat at the front row, where the people who testified all sat. Luna was there, and so was Mr. Ollivander.
When they arrived, Draco let go of Harry’s hand so fast it was almost offensive, and looked around them.
“Wait, wait. Are you seriously jealous?” Draco asked, laughing. “Honestly, Scarhead, I’m wounded. I’d never hook up with Blaise, I don’t go for the straight men.”
On May 28th, Crabbe’s will be at 9am, Yaxley’s at 2pm and Goyle’s at 5pm.
Draco, who hadn’t brought any clothes with him to Paris since this wasn’t really a planned vacation, had bought everything there with his muggle money – Harry had been very surprised to see how comfortable the other was with it, but after all Draco was full of surprises – and had also bought a small backpack, on which he had performed an extension charm, just like he just had on Harry’s.
Harry lied down on Sirius’s – no, his – bed for a few minutes, thinking. That wasn’t something he usually did on purpose these days. In fact, he did everything he could to distract himself from thinking, because most of the time his thoughts went places he didn’t want them to go to. But this time, he closed his eyes, and let the memories of Padfoot and Moony wash over him. The room still smelt like his godfather – old leather, coffee, and tobacco, with a hint of almond extract. He thought about them, his dad’s best friends, and the happiest memories he had with them. He wanted control. He wanted to be able to control his thoughts. He wanted to be able to think about happy things without death and misery clouding his brain.
After that, since it was nearing noon, everyone left for a break until Draco’s trial, which started at 2pm. Harry was so nervous for this one he wanted to vomit. Draco might have been Harry’s school nemesis, but he wasn’t a murderer. He wasn’t like the others, and he didn’t deserve to go to Azkaban. The raven-haired boy knew it was unlikely the blonde would be sent to jail, but still. He was nervous.
“Oh, Ginny, hi, sorry. I didn’t see you there.”
Harry bent down slightly and put a hand on Draco's cheek before pressing a soft kiss on his lips. Draco encircled Harry's waist with his arms and kissed him slowly, pressing his body against his date's. He couldn't believe that this was happening. He was finally kissing the man he liked after an amazing date with him.
The rest of the night went by in a blur of conversations, dancing and laughter. At one point, Luna had dragged Harry to the dance-floor and forced him to dance with her and Ginny, which had actually been quite fun. He had talked to a lot of his former classmates, and with some younger students he didn’t really know. He had even chatted with Blaise Zabini for a few minutes, and the man was actually quite nice. He wasn’t the stuck-up jerk Harry had expected him to be.
After McGonagall had practically thrown them out of the castle, they had all gone home at around 2am, and as Harry went to bed, he realized he was finally ready to move to Grimmauld Place. He didn’t know what had changed during that one night, but he had a gut feeling that this was the right thing to do, and of course Harry, being the Gryffindor he was, always listened to his instinct.
However, Harry’s increasingly good mood faded a bit when him, Ron and Hermione walked in the Great Hall to greet Bill and Fleur. His eyes landed on the exact place where he had killed Voldemort, and flashes of confronting the man who called himself the Dark Lord before having their final duel rushed back to him. His breathing sped up a little, and he tried to calm himself down, but Fleur seemed to notice because she squeezed his shoulder, giving him a reassuring smile.
“Potter?”
A few moments later, the doors opened and two Aurors accompanied Lucius to the seat in the middle of the room, chains immediately circling his wrists and ankles. And after the charges were announced, and Lucius defended himself, Harry was called to the stand. He presented himself automatically, his thoughts feeling a bit hazy, before beginning his testimony. Another advantage of being the Saviour-Of-The-Entire-World was that people let him tell his story without interrupting him with questions all the time like they did with other witnesses.
The two men kept glancing at each other from time to time, and at one point Harry saw Draco go out with Blaise. He felt a rush of emotion go through him, but couldn’t quite identify what they were. He tried not paying attention to it, but he couldn’t help but be bothered by it. He tried to associate it to the fact that he was now becoming friends with his former nemesis, but deep down he knew there was more to it.
“Wait.”
As he was getting dressed, Harry heard a soft tapping on the window. He turned around, startled, and was glad to see Moon. He quickly opened the window for her and ruffled the owl’s feathers, grinning.
“Potter, for Merlin’s sake, what the fuck are you doing? Are you trying to kidnap me?”
“I’m sorry but we only have one room left, it’s the middle of summer and we’re packed. It has two separate beds though, do you want it?”
That Friday afternoon, after finishing taking care of Regulus Black’s bedroom, Harry went to sit on his bed in Sirius’s old room. It was one of the few rooms in the house he hadn’t had the strength to sort out. Regulus’s had already been hard enough, and he didn’t know if he could handle going through his late godfather’s things. Since moving in, he hadn’t put his clothes in the wardrobe, he left all of his things in his trunk or around the house. He didn’t even dare look at the pictures on the walls.
At around 8:30am, he apparated to the Ministry – apparating without a licence wasn’t really frowned upon when you were the Saviour-Of-The-Entire-World – and went to the Department of Mysteries, as he had the two prior days. He knew Lucius, his crimes being the worst, was the first, then was Draco, and finally Narcissa.
“I take it you haven’t received any letters from Hogwarts?”
Ron muttered something under his breath that neither Harry or George could hear and downed the end of his pint before getting up to get another one. Harry met Hermione’s eyes, who seemed to have listened to the conversation, but she just shrugged.
“I wanted to see if you would follow me. I didn’t want to go up to you in the Great Hall and have your little guard hex me and I didn’t think you’d want to speak with me after… what happened.” Draco said, his tone cold. The usual facade he’d began to let go of when he was with Harry was back.
“There’s this thing called books, Potter, you should open one once in a while. I mean, Hogsmeade is such an old village. The architecture has barely changed since it was founded centuries ago. It’s insane! Same for Hogwarts, it has looked the same since it was bloody built. I love it, don’t get me wrong, and I wouldn’t change it for the world. But wizarding homes… Everything is just so old.”
“Oh my, is Draco Malfoy asking me out on a date?”
He was greeted by Neville, Seamus, Dean, Anthony Goldstein, Ernie MacMillan, Lisa Turpin, Katie Bell, Angelina Johnson, Terry Boot, Padma and Parvati Patil, Oliver Wood, Alicia Spinnet, Roger Davies, Cho Chang, and Susan Bones. There were a few other eighth years and over, but he’d never really talked to them, so they just nodded at him before going back to their business.
“What do you mean?” Harry asked, frowning in confusion. “Everything seemed fine when we were at the ball. The school is perfectly renovated and I don’t understand what could be-”
“We’ll take it.”
Harry’s heart ached when she mentioned her daughter. He was suddenly taken by an overwhelming feeling of guilt as he looked at the baby and remembered his parents. The parents he would never know, just like Harry. But Teddy would get a better childhood than him, he would make sure of it. Andromeda was a good woman and Harry would visit him as much as possible, and one day he would tell him all about his parents, and if Teddy hated him for causing their deaths, Harry wouldn’t blame him.
“Wait- abused? What the fuck?” Draco replied, calming down instantly.
“Did you drink?” He finally asked.
Harry turned to look at the receptionist, a tight smile on his lips. This was going to be… Interesting, to say the least.
And then Teddy’s round face and purple hair came into his mind, his godson, the only person who made him want to keep living. He hated the fact that he had only seen him once when he had visited Andromeda, but he needed to sort himself out before coming into that perfect baby’s life. He needed to live, to be stupid, but mostly he needed to find himself. And then he would be ready. He couldn’t let that child feel a single moment of sadness in his life, he wouldn’t allow it.
I hope you enjoyed this chapter, please let me know what you thought in the comments!! Don't worry, the angst is coming soon. This is just the calm before the storm.
Harry got up as well and followed him down the narrow staircase.
“Took you long enough.” Draco said after hesitating for a few seconds and shook his hand, grinning slightly. “11-year-old me would be thrilled.”
“What was it like back there, at your school? I mean, I've seen students from Beauxbatons during the Triwizard Tournament and Ron's brother married a French women but I've never been there.
I have also decided to go back to Hogwarts for my eighth year. Professor McGonagall came to the Burrow to talk to Ron and me about it personally, but I think she was mostly hoping to see you there. I told her you were on vacation. Which isn’t really a lie, right? She told us you weren’t planning on returning, but asked us to tell you that you would always be welcomed at Hogwarts, whether for studying or visiting.
“A bit.” Harry replied.
“I just don’t understand why you’d want to be friends with me.” Draco whispered. He sounded so small in that moment, and it broke Harry’s heart to imagine all the pain he must’ve gone through in the past years. “I know we were getting close in Paris but it’s different here. This is real life. Everybody despises me and I don’t understand why you don’t. They’ll think I have you under Imperio.”
The next morning, Harry woke up feeling more rested than he had in the past seven years. He’d slept like a baby, and even though his sleep had still been clouded by the sight of red eyes and a green light, he felt slightly better. Hermione was right; talking did make you feel lighter. He wished he had listened to her sooner, but he’d always been stubborn.
Harry pushed through the sweaty bodies, trying to make his way to the bathroom so he could apparate back to the hotel without bringing any attention from the muggles. After shoving a few people out of his way, he entered into a stall and quickly apparated directly in front of the hotel, not even caring that apparating into a muggle area was illegal. He just had to find Malfoy. This was bad. Something felt wrong.
“But it’s my thing.” Draco replied, mocking Harry’s tone.
“Oh please, Harry, call me Andromeda. I had a very pleasant time as well, thank you for responding to my invitation.” She smiled kindly at him, and he left.
During these past months, he’d found out he loved laughing with Malfoy. His laugh was contagious, and Harry wished he would laugh more. He understood why the blonde didn’t laugh much anymore, considering all of what had happened to him, but it still made Harry’s heart ache. And it made him realize just how much everyone had suffered during the war, even those who had made some bad choices.
“Hi”, Draco said softly when he was standing in front of the counter.
“I absolutely and most fundamentally agree with you, Potter- words that sound too good to be true.”
"You think so?"
----------
“Obviously, I’m trying it”, he quickly responded, now noticing that their bartender of the night was still rather busy. “I’ll fetch you a drink, love. It should be quite interesting, seeing you try it, I mean. I have a theory on how this thing works”, Hermione stated, receiving a few interested nods. The group knew that, sooner or later, Hermione would have worked it out but knowing that she had a conjecture made everyone excited anew. Ron took the shot, placing the empty glass in front of him when his head snatched towards Hermione, instantly meeting her lips. They parted rather quickly due to Hermione pulling away from the kiss. “I know how it works!”
"I can tell you're staring at me", Draco muffled, letting Harry snap back to the present. "Can you blame me?", Harry asked, his voice raspy from sleep. "Obviously not, Potter". "I go down on you twice and you still call me that?", Harry joked. Draco finally looked up and positioned himself so he could meet Harry's eyes. And the fondness and awe Harry saw there made him want to surrender to this beautiful man again and again and again until the sun would cease to shine and reflect on Draco's hair, so never or at least not in his lifetime.
. Since when did Draco wear sweatpants? Surely he was too noble to do so? Of course, Harry was aware of the timespan of three years that had passed since the lot of them left Hogwarts and many of his friends changed a bit, interest- and character wise, but sweatpants? A pair of denims, sure. But-
"You...what? Why would you go to a gay bar?", Harry asked, aware of the fact that the strongest emotion he'd felt in the last twelve hours was indeed sheer confusion. "Oh, no mate. I went there with a few people from the study group since most of them are queer. The music's really good there, too. I'm straight, you know that." Harry's whole bubble was burst. Malfoy was... not straight? Suddenly, Malfoy's comment about Harry being too uptight to hook up with him took on a whole different meaning, leaving Harry perplexed.
“...cliche?”
“I most definitely agree, Potter”.
"Lovely. Asteria is a vegan, too. She took her stuff with her 'cause they don't have that stuff where her parents live. She'll be back today, by the way". "Funny, the girl my father tried to set me up is called Astoria", Malfoy mentioned, as if it was bloody normal that they were making small talk at the kitchen table. Harry ate his croissant as quickly as he could and explained that he's "very busy today, goodbye", before hurrying to the door and putting on some shoes that he wasn't even sure were his before storming out of the apartment and apparating straight to Ron and Hermione's.
In his room, Harry was embarrassed. He busied himself pretending to read after he had thrown off his beanie and scarf. Finding neither his bed nor his chair an agreeable accommodation, he simply sat down next to his various plants on the floor, his back leaning against the cold wall.Lost in thought, he knocked over a plant with his elbow in the process of turning a page-a quite aggressive turn- and the clay pot was shattering on the ground. "Fuck", he muttered contemplating if he cared enough to pull out his wand to give it a swift "Repario", and deciding that he didn't. There were steps approaching his door, followed by a knock. "Come in if you must", Harry grumbled. A blonde head revealed itself. Draco looked cautious. "I can leave if you want, this time your contention about the rent does not apply". His tone was witty, yet compassionate. Harry didn't reply-again- and Draco interpreted it as nonchalance. The door was closed, and he entered the room.
"I was thinking about going outside again. Join me?"
“I liked it especially after I rewatched it. Obviously, it was genius to choose
“Well, never say never, Potter”, Draco smirked. “What do you think about my outfit choice? It’s quite lovely, isn’t it?”, he continued, obviously enjoying Harry’s startlement.
“Harry?”,Theodore managed to interrupt his thoughts yet again, just like he had done at the bar.
"You didn't answer my question earlier", Harry expressed, knowing full well he was headed into dangerous territory, possibly the territory of feelings. "True. You'd make such a lovely auror, with that memory of yours", Draco laughed and Harry knew then that he'd be willing to do anything to hear that rich, mesmerizing laugh again. Quite frankly, he knew he was fucked. Harry eyed him curiously, awaiting his answer. "You see, Harry, if you make wrong choices there will be repercussions, egregious ones, that, mind me, aren't unjustified. I can try as hard as I want and still most people will still think I'm nothing more than Death Eater scum", his eyes were suddenly sharp.
He locked eyes with Draco again and Harry was about to close his eyes and lean in even more, when all of a sudden, Draco increased their distance again and the feeling on Harry's lips as soon as Draco had pulled his thumb back was cold and completely terrifying.
sums it up quite well". Harry was at a loss. He didn't want to urge Draco to talk about things he wasn't ready for or simply did not want to, so instead of replying he simply kept silent.
But this night had been slightly different. Francis reminded Asteria and Harry that he, in fact, had a life aside from their flat-share-friendship. He was studying Law in his third semester, occasionally even attending a lecture instead of lighting a joint at a time most people would not consider appropriate. Francis had recently joined a study group - but rather because he was extremely infatuated with one of his fellow students who, incidentally was part of the group as well, than intending to suddenly gather his mind around studying ("Harry, I can recite all of what my professor's said for the past three months, I don't
“I’ll go fetch myself a drink, anyone else want something?”, Harry asked as he pushed the chair back to get up. “Just a Butterbeer for me, mate”, Ron, who was sitting across from him next to Hermione and, again, the wall.
Confused, he made his way to Grimmauld Place, saddened by the loneliness that was settled inside his heart. The sun was shining so brightly that it made it hard to focus on the road with its various red lights and Harry could not even be happy about the rays of sunshine he was getting, something very rare in London. He decided to watch a movie when he got out of the shower and decided to go with the most dystopian movie he had at hand:
“Oh, don’t apologize, Potter. Where would we be if we apologized for every thing we said, even when it was well-intended?”
"Potter was much too uptight to ever hook up with me", Malfoy said humorously, devouring every single word. Fucking fantastic, Harry thought. "That's the first thing that comes to mind when you're suddenly in my kitchen? Really, Malfoy?"Harry retorted, feeling simultaneously disconcerted at Malfoy's statement but chose not to pay it any mind (right now at least) and relieved due to the fact that he had managed to form a proper sentence. "You know each other?", Francis enquired, appearing amused and interested all at once. "You can definitely say that."
The three of them had decided to cook together (bad idea, Hermione and Ron were infamous in their friend group for always eating frozen meals, and it turned out they had been right to do so) and sit on their tiny balcony to watch over the city. A small weight was lifted from Harry‘s chest, still he could not quite explain what was troubling him. But this, this was beautiful. This was something Harry had been missing.
“Forrest what now?”
“Malfoys are not cute, Potter”
"I'm not leaving the house, Malfoy".
“But you should come! You know my address, right? Oh, and bring your boyfriend”
“Sorry, I just didn’t expect you guys to actually show up”, answered Harry.
... right? Draco thought about the alternative: seeing Potter make out with whoever he desired. And who that was, Draco had no clue. All these years it had been faintly obvious, seeing the raven-haired boy drool over the she-Weasel. But now? Who knew? Whoever it was, Draco decided, he wasn’t going to be a little baby about it, but deep down he still had the tiniest glint of hope that it was-
“The one that Sally told me about! She totally caught you. God. She was so embarrassed when she told me! But bring him! I’m kinda mad you didn’t tell me about him! Anyways, see you!”
“Stupid thing?”
But now, after two Butterbeers and one Firewhiskey, he could finally loosen up a little and felt a great relief at being able to actually follow the conversations again instead of drifting off after a second. Seamus, who was on his left, was carried away with Dean and Ron, passionately discussing the latest Quidditch results. Their conversation had started in a moderate volume but now made it hard to focus on anything other than their what seemed like well-practised debate statements. Harry smiled to himself and turned to his left, where Luna was talking to Ginny and Neville about something Harry could not quite make out yet, when his name was called.
The lights off his room were dimmed, the candles weren't burning anymore and the rush of noise from outside was audible through the small slot of his french window. It was quite windy outside and his transparent curtains were moving with each blow. Harry, again, found himself yearning for a cup of tea but the reasons to stay in his room appeared more convincing. Deciding that it was pointless to try to go to sleep just yet, he stepped out on his balcony and sat down on one of the two chairs he'd put there a few weeks ago. It was freezing, more so than yesterday but the blanket he had put around his legs was keeping him warm.
"By the way, Malfoy's queer", Harry mentioned, his mouth full with white bread. "Excuse me, what?!", Ron exclaimed, staring frantically at his friend. "Honestly, boys, it's always been quite obvious, hasn't it?",Hermione smirked, stirring an undefinable mixture in the pan. "What? No!", her boyfriend replied. "You think so, 'Mione?", Harry asked curiously, concerned about the fact that he hadn't noticed or even suspected it. "Well, aside from the stereotypical things such as his infatuation with grooming, especially his hair.. oh, and his nails, now that I think about it, that certain posture, that walk.. He really couldn't take his eyes off of Zabini for a while... and off of you, mind. And-" "Hermione! Are you mental? Are you suggesting Malfoy had a thing for... Harry?", Ron interrupted hysterically. Harry suddenly felt sick. Malfoy's statement from yesterday was playing inside his head over and over again.
. But a convenience.
“Can I get a Firewhiskey, a Butterbeer and a cocktail with mint and lemons, please?”
“Wait. Did you just call me
Harry was surprised and wondered what conversation might have lead them to Hermione sharing this and just wanted to reply when Theodore intercepted his thoughts by saying “Pansy, Draco and I have been really into Muggle produced movies lately so it’s really chill that we now know someone who works at a videothek”. Harry, not knowing what an appropriate answer to that piece of information could be, only replied with a “Oh.Yeah- totally”. He never intended for people to find out about his job, mainly because it seemed insignificant since he only worked there for a couple of hours a week but also because he had not expected for people like Pansy and
"Do you remember that time the Ravenclaw girl was walking backwards for two weeks straight?", Draco asked, clearly wanting to lighten the mood. Since when did Malfoy use icebreakers in a conversation? "She got everyone all worried, yeah",Harry remembered, carefully looking at Draco. He'd been staring at the tree right in front of him before. "Yeah". And there it was again, this private smile, that lingering gaze.
“Just for fun, I guess. Definitely not for the money”
"But nothing too bad happened, right? I can cancel with my parents for today".
"Malfoy moved in with you? Are you bloody
Harry was set on ignoring the turn of his stomach when he heard Draco's laugh coming from the kitchen table as he opened the door. He carefully closed the door behind him and met Draco's eyes, staring into his. "Hey, mate", Francis greeted, "is it raining?". Harry only felt capable of nodding, still feeling Draco's eyes on him. "Where have you been, Potter?", he asked. "Out", was Harry's reply. For Salazar's sake, now he was responding in a blunt manner, and for what? Appear enigmatic? "What's with the last name calling? Thought I heard you use each other's first name yesterday." "Oh, just a joke", Draco answered, looking at Harry. "Yup, all a big fucking joke", Harry mumbled, storming off into his room reminding Francis and Draco of a child throwing a tantrum.
“I pick Harry, then”. The boy in question jerked his head up, blinking rapidly. Clearly surprised, he cleared his throat and sat upright.
, Harry thought to himself while fiddling with the string of his hoodie, lying on the sofa of their living room. The intense, cedar odour of an incense stick lit by Asteria clouded the room and he felt as if it was clouding his mind, too. And then, the sound he'd been waiting for all night: the unlocking of the front door. Harry jerked his head towards the door, inwardly cursing himself for it. Draco entered the room, his hair surprisingly disheveled and found Harry's eyes. He smiled. "Missed me then, Potter?", he asked and Harry wasn't sure if it was mere antics or if a hint of solemnity was in it, too. "What? No? I... I was simply enjoying...my book", he finished off, looking alarmed. "Eloquent as always, I see". Harry rolled his eyes in return but found himself blushing. "I hope it's not too late for our little nightly talk, then? Or does the Chosen One insist on his beauty sleep?".
Harry desperately needed to come up with something witty in response and stop being so caught off guard all the time, but he only replied with a “Yeah, very clever, Malfoy”.
"I'd always hoped that one day you'd do, but if I'm being honest I've never thought you'd change... that much"
“It’s a he, actually. Mario and his husband just adopted”
“You absolute tosser”, Draco smiled and he took another drag from his cigarette. He turned his face slightly, as to not hit Harry with the smoke. The way Draco held the cigarette, with such grace and lightness. The way he inhaled the smoke, how his cheeks momentarily hollowed, and the way they returned to their full beauty as he exhaled. Harry could not help himself, he felt incredibly turned on.
What seemed like an eternity had already passed in complete silence, when Draco said:"I forgot to offer you a cigarette earlier" and he met Harry's glance with such persistence that Harry stumbled over his own words, so that only a cramped "er" was audible.
“Stop talking about my father when I’m trying to kiss you”
"Francis law studies rubbing off on you?", Malfoy joked, wearing that same little smile on his face that felt almost as if Harry was part of something private. Like a private joke they shared. It was a nice feeling and Harry hated it.
Next thing he knew, he was sitting in Ron and Hermione’s kitchen, a cup of coffee in hand. “I can’t believe you’re late to your own intervention”, Hermione was saying. She was sitting across from him, her dark green blouse reminding him of someone he wasn’t supposed to think about right now. “It’s not my own intervention, it’s an intervention about me”, Harry muttered as he rested his head in his hands and proceeded to massage his temples.
“Although my response might be interesting, I think I might.. try the
"I'm thinking about how the eyeliner really suited you, pity you wiped it off again"
“Why don’t you want to do it?”
“You’re such a mysterium. Everyone has been telling you how bloody amazing you are for decades, yet here you are, all self-effacing”
Draco’s hand in his face and along the beginning of his neck was soft and warm, softer than Harry had dared to imagine. They simultaneously moved closer and then their lips met, light, soft and heartwarming. Draco backed off a little to search for further consent in Harry’s eyes, Harry did his best to to his eyes transport the want, the
“He’ll come around. He knows Draco isn’t that bad. Just an asshole with a shit dad.” She said.
Once they were done with dessert, McGonagall announced the Weird Sisters, and Ginny immediately dragged Luna to the dance-floor. Harry looked around the room as a lot of people were standing up to go dance and caught Draco’s eyes looking straight at him. He maintained the eye contact and Draco suddenly stood up, going out of the Great Hall.
“I wanted to know if you’ve had news from your… Gryffindor friends who went back to school.” Draco asked, crossing his legs. No matter the situation, his demeanour always made him seem like a snob, but Harry didn’t really mind.
“Sorry, I forgot you were better than me in everything.” Harry replied, rolling his eyes. It was mostly a habit of Draco’s, but spending so much time with the blonde had made Harry pick up some of his quirks.
That night, Harry received a letter from Hermione. She had bought herself an owl, apparently. It was white, and it looked a lot like Hedwig, which made his heart hurt a little. But it was beautiful.
Ginny grabbed Harry’s hand, holding on tightly as they moved towards the main entrance of the castle. Nobody was uttering a word in their small group, they didn’t need to. They knew what each other were thinking about.
“Thank you.” Professor McGonagall said, and everyone slowly quieted down again. “Those we loved and lost would want us to be strong, and to live. And this is what tonight is about. Taking back what was taken from us – our joy, our happiness, our lives. I want tonight to be a new beginning for us, and for our school. I want your laughters to be so loud they will chase away all of the demons and hatred haunting these walls. I want us to live for all of those who don’t have that privilege anymore. Let the festivities begin.” The new headmistress announced, smiling, and suddenly a ton of food appeared on each of the table.
It was like his brain had tried to block out his most traumatic experiences, but hadn’t managed to finish the job. Because he still remembered. Not much, but the memories were there. The memories of dying, of being tortured, of watching his loved ones die to protect him. It was still there, haunting his mind.
“Shit. Shit, shit, shit.”
Harry laughed at Draco’s reaction. Dramatic as ever.
“I’m never leaving this bed. Ever.” Harry said.
Harry turned to lay on his side, staring at Draco. He really hoped spending so much more time together wasn’t going to induce… Uncomfortable situations. The raven-haired man dealt with a lot of night terrors, dissociative episodes and panic attacks, and he was scared of someone seeing him be so vulnerable. Not because he didn’t trust Draco – he had spent enough time with him to know he was harmless – but because he had never shown this side of himself to anyone except for Ron and Hermione. And he knew he shouldn’t be, but he was ashamed.
“Yeah, great work Ernie. Still a lot to go though.”
Draco laughed and shook his head.
“I understand. But I think they mostly get close to you to get a better look at me. I mean, I’m pretty handsome.” He said smugly.
“Is that a threat?”
“Gryffindors are stupid! They act all brave and shit but really it just shows their lack of survival instinct. And I’ve seen you in class and exams, Potter, you always had that dumb confused look on your face. It was sad, really.”
Harry frowned at his words.
She grabbed his hand and led him to a table in the back of the Three Broomsticks, where Ron, George, Luna and Ginny (who had both managed to sneak out) already were. Harry greeted everyone, smiling. He was glad to see them again, even though it hadn’t been that long. He sat at the table while George got up to go get them a pint, and quite a few people came over to say hi, eighth year students, older ones who had graduated, and even some that hadn’t come back to school for the year, just like him.
“Please. I’ve been waiting for you to ask.” Draco answered, smirking.
The girls arrived to the living room, bickering like sisters, and soon after George arrived as well. Hermione was wearing a dark blue dress and Ginny a cream one. They both looked beautiful, and seeing the look on Ron’s face as he stared at his girlfriend, he was thinking the same thing. They all apparated to Hogsmeade together. From there, they could see dozens of people walking to the castle, and followed them.
“Dear Harry,
“Right. Now if you’re done insulting me, we could go visit the city a bit.”
“Yeah, it sucks. But I’m tired of talking about me all the time – how are you?”
“Every single girl is going to fight to get a dance with you anyway.” Ron responded and Harry snorted. He wasn’t wrong. Although dancing with a man wouldn’t bother him either… He really should tell his friends he also liked men one day. But it could wait. Just for now.
“I have to go to the loo.” Harry announced to his friends, who weren’t even really listening to him, and quickly got out as well, following Draco.
“Malfoy.”
Harry had been delighted to find out the Healer’s at St Mungo’s had nearly fully healed the Grangers, and even though their memories were still a bit fuzzy, they remembered Hermione. He had also received a long letter from Ginny telling him they should officially break up, even though they weren’t really in a relationship anymore anyway, and they should go back to being good friends instead, which should’ve probably made him feel sad, but he was mostly relieved. He didn’t even see her as anything more than a close friend anymore, and the letter was mostly to clear things up. Draco had found that absolutely hilarious, “Oh Potter, being broken up with by letter after making out with dudes almost every night, you must be devastated”. He did feel a bit guilty about that but it wasn’t like they had acted like a couple the few times they had seen each other before Harry left, so it wasn’t really that big of a deal.
“So, where did you go?” Hermione asked, sitting next to Harry at the table, getting a few toasts in a plate.
“About what? Because if you’re talking about what I think you’re talking about, I’m going back to sleep.”
“Are you planning on going back?” Draco asked him.
“If only the Prophet knew their dear Saint Potter smoked. They would have a field day.”
“I’ve known Draco Malfoy since I was 11 years old. Him and I were never friendly, but if there’s one thing I know about him, it’s that he’s not a murderer. Two years ago, he was given the task of killing Albus Dumbledore. And last year, as he and Headmaster Dumbledore were alone – or as they thought – on top of the Astronomy Tower, Draco lowered his wand. He didn’t want to kill him, and didn’t. He was and still is a child. He’s a child who was raised to be Voldemort’s perfect servant. But after he received the mark, I saw him change, withdrawing from everything he liked doing – like annoying me and playing Quidditch. Two months ago, when I was brought to the Malfoy Manor by Snatchers, Lucius Malfoy asked his son to identify me. I had received a Stinging Jinx, but my scar was still visible. And I know Draco recognized me. I could see it. But he didn't say anything, and that made us gain time. He saved my life, consciously or not. I saw how afraid he was of Voldemort and I have absolutely no doubt in my mind when I saw he’s not a dangerous person and has learned from his mistakes. He was a child who made the wrong choices under the influence of his Death Eater father. Thank you.”
Eventually, after finishing his third pint, Harry got up to get something a bit stronger at the bar for him and his friends. Draco was there too, to get another glass. And if he’d chosen to wait until Draco got to the bar before going there too, well, no one had to know.
“I might be gay but I still have pride! She could’ve gone with her to the ball and avoid me the embarrassment! Merlin, I seriously wanted to slap her.”
“You don’t know that. You don’t know me as well as you think you do.”
“I totally get that, mate. Even if we didn’t have the shop to run, I wouldn’t have gone back either.” Ron added. “It would feel so weird.”
That day, and the next, went by in a blur. Harry testified, as did a few other people, and the newly appointed Wizenmagot didn’t even have to deliberate before sending the Carrows, Rookwood, Avery, Crabbe, Yaxley and Goyle in Azkaban for life. Every trial took around an hour or two but each of them felt like ten hours to Harry. He was exhausted, and seeing the faces of these terrible people who had hurt him and tried to kill him so many times made him want to jump off the astronomy tower. But it was alright. It was going to be over soon and everything would go back to normal.
“WHAT?” Draco practically screamed, stopping suddenly. “Are you fucking kidding me? We could’ve had the goddamn Chosen One in our house if it wasn’t for all of the prejudice your Gryffindor friends had against us? No. I refuse to believe it.”
Malfoy rolled his eyes, a playful smirk on his lips.
Harry’s eyes went wide and he opened the door, surprised.
Lunch with Ginny was – surprisingly good, and not awkward at all. They talked as they always had, and everything was just so platonic. Harry didn’t know what to think about the situation, but he didn’t mind. He really loved Ginny, even though he didn’t know in which way, and she always made him feel better. Her presence soothed him.
“Right.” Harry frowned a bit, staring at Draco’s face. That was something he seemed to be doing a lot these days. It was also something he did a lot in school, but back then it was because he always thought Draco was conducting an evil master plan.
“I don’t despise you, Malfoy, stop being such a drama queen. I wouldn’t have saved your ass during your trial if I despised you. You saved my life.”
“Nice work today, right, Harry?” Said Ernie McMillan as he approached him, a proud smile on his face.
He cut her off with a wave of his hand.
“Yeah, it’s… It’s nice. Really. It’s a good idea, I’m just not thrilled to go back there, but it’ll be fine.” Harry forced a smile, not wanting to seem like a buzzkill. Ron apparently didn’t have a problem with that.
“You wanna go out tonight?” Draco asked, breaking the silence.
“I know, I know. I was just bored.”
“Do you ever regret it? Choosing Gryffindor over Slytherin.” Draco asked, startling Harry a bit. He had already asked himself that question, and he didn’t really know what the answer was.
“Aw, what’s going on?” Harry gently took Teddy in his own arms. The little boy was usually really cute but his screams unbelievably loud for such a small human.
We really miss you, Harry. Be safe. Take care of yourself. And owl me or Ron or anyone else if anything’s wrong.
“We always go out.” Harry chuckled. “I don’t really like celebrating it anyway. Don’t worry about it. How do you even know when my birthday is?”
“I’m full of surprises.” Harry chuckled, and they started walking again. Very slowly. Neither of them wanted to get back to the party because they knew they’d have to go on their separate ways. Harry didn’t care that others saw them interacting but he didn’t want Draco to have to face the repercussions. He had already been getting nasty looks, he didn’t want to make it worse for him.
“Please, Hermione… Don’t. I can’t go back for now. I can’t. I’m sorry. I miss you too, but I can’t.”
“Once, when I was little. I don’t remember much, just that I was absolutely traumatized by the house-elf heads in the staircase. Did you remove them?”
Harry put his bag down on the floor and threw himself on the first bed, spreading his limbs so as to be in a starfish position, his face mushed into the many pillows. Was this what being in Heaven felt like? He had a huge smile on his face. Even his bed at Hogwarts wasn’t that comfy.
Love, Hermione
After returning home from the club at around 5am, both boys bid their goodnights and went to their separate rooms. Harry was quickly coming down from his alcohol-induced daze, his vision becoming less blurry and his thoughts less fuzzy. He didn’t like that. Falling asleep while sober meant overthinking. After triple-checking the lock on the door, he undressed and immediately went to bed.
Harry bowed to the Wizenmagot before rejoining his seat next to Luna and watched the rest of the trial without really paying attention to anything that was said. He was there, but his mind was elsewhere. He was thinking about Narcissa, who had saved his life. And Draco, who lowered his wand before Dumbledore was killed, who recognized him when he was taken to the Manor by the Snatchers but didn’t say anything, who was trembling and hurting when he was forced to torture people in Harry’s visions. Draco, who had been raised to become the perfect Death Eater since birth, but had become a shadow of the person he used to be after receiving the Mark.
Harry had to think for a second. He didn’t even remember it was going to be his birthday. He didn’t care that much either. Celebrating his birthday didn’t hold a lot of happy memories; he had only celebrated it a few times with the Weasleys and some Order members, but it always followed terrible events, so it had never been such a happy thing for him. His last birthdays had been tainted by the deaths of Cedric, Sirius, and Dumbledore.
Harry turned his head to look at Malfoy, who was staring at his hands, fidgeting.
Harry almost choked on his smoke, not expecting Draco to be so blunt. Merlin, there it was. The feeling of everything being so bloody surreal. But it was better than the feeling of everything being back to normal, if Harry was honest.
“Yeah, me too.”
That night, Harry walked to the nearest club he could find. It seemed nice enough, and he didn’t really care anyway. He wanted to do something reckless, without thinking about it, without wondering if it would put his life at risk. He wanted so desperately to live.
On the morning of August 20
So during the entire day, the students, professors, as well as the Ministry employees and some volunteers who arrived later in the morning worked on renovating Gryffindor Tower. It was really hard, they had to be careful as to not cause anything to collapse, and had to seal every stone with complicated spells. But they had already been working on it for a few days and as the sun started setting, they finished their work on the tower. Harry was bit emotional as they placed the last rock. This tower had been his home for years, and seeing it looking good as new again almost brought tears to his eyes.
“Why aren’t you mad at me? I mean, you were kissed by a Death Eater. I’d be pretty pissed if I were you.”
The feast went by pretty nicely, to Harry’s surprised. He had expected everyone to be gloomy and sad because of McGonagall’s speech but everyone seemed to have taken her words of new beginning to heart. They didn’t talk of the war, of course, but they chatted about Hogwarts and about what they were going to do in September. The girls seemed really excited to go back to school, and Harry was happy for them. He didn’t know what he was going to do with his life, but he was happy to see other people knew what they were doing.
Draco nodded understandingly and they finally arrived to the ground floor, just a few feet away from the Great Hall. There were a few people there, but nobody seemed to notice them.
There was some Firewhisky with the main course – that had been spelled so it could only be touched by people of age – and Harry was already feeling a bit buzzed, and apparently so did Hermione considering her red cheeks and the fact that she was overly touchy with Ron. It was sweet.
“That’s my speciality.” Harry gave him an over-exaggerated wink before turning back to check up on what his friends were doing.
We are pleased to inform you that Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry is hosting a ball in honour of its successful reconstruction on August 20
Draco rolled his eyes and sat down close to the edge, Harry coming to sit beside him. The youngest took out a cigarette from the pack he had hidden in one of his pockets and offered Draco one, which he accepted. He lit up both of them with his wand and looked out at the lake.
It was Harry’s turn to get quiet now. He didn’t have any idea that all of this was happening to him. He knew Draco didn’t believe in the “old ways” anymore but he didn’t know his father used to bloody torture him. But he didn’t show him any pity, he knew how awful it felt to have people look at you like you were a helpless puppy.
On the morning of May 25th 1998, Harry got up for yet another day of working on fixing the castle. His muscles felt sore and he had barely gotten any sleep, but he needed to do this. He got under the freezing cold shower, scrubbed his skin until it was almost painful, cast a drying spell on himself, got dressed, and went down to the Great Hall to get something to eat.
“Potter.” Draco turned towards him, and Harry couldn’t help but notice how nice he looked. He was wearing very fancy all black dress robes with gold details embroidered on the sleeves. It changed from the usual touches of silver on his Slytherin clothes. “Why did you follow me?”
“Inside with Lee and Oliver. I needed a break.” George answered, loosening his tie. Harry stared at his hand for a few seconds and looked away. Realizing he liked men also made him realize just the amount of blokes he had been attracted to at Hogwarts but had mistaken for friendship or admiration.
“Ugh, don’t get me started on that one.” Harry rolled his eyes as Draco mentioned Dumbledore and quickly downed his drink. These days, thinking about that man only made him want to break everything in his sight, but at that moment he was too wasted to get angry.
He was about to apologize grumpily before recognizing a voice which belonged to none other than Ginny Weasley. Was she still his girlfriend? Harry didn’t know, probably not, but he was glad to see her.
Harry rubbed George’s back as he put his face in his hands. He knew George kept to himself a lot and never let himself cry so he wanted to be there for him.
His only comfort was hanging out with Moon. It probably seemed stupid, but he loved talking to the owl and telling her about his troubles. Harry truly felt like she understood him, just like Hedwig had. He remembered late nights at Hogwarts, especially in his last two years, where he would stay in the Owlery for hours just to talk to her. And she always listened. Or didn’t fly away, at least.
“Yeah, well, I don’t expect being raised by Lucius Malfoy was much more fun.”
hi,, i'm really sorry but i'm putting this story on hiatus for now. i just haven't had the inspiration for it and i don't know how to continue it. i don't know if i will continue it one day but i will try my hardest to find the right way to put all of my ideas on paper. sorry
yes i cried writing the conversation between george and harry. hope you enjoyed<3 don't forget to leave a small comment if u want, it always makes me so happy to read feedbacks!!
“It seems like things are pretty bad there.” Draco’s face was like stone, not reflecting any emotions. Harry wasn’t really used to seeing him like this anymore. The Draco he had gotten to know let lose a lot more, but this one seemed upset.
“I was on my own. What makes you think I was with someone else?”
Love, Hermione.”
“What’s going on?” Harry placed his feet up on the coffee table. “It’s getting quite late.”
Harry felt taken aback by her question. How could she know he was with someone?
Harry slapped the back of Malfoy’s head lightly.
“We should still do something. Like go out or something, I don’t know.”
“It’s not even your birthday yet, Potter. Don’t jinx it.” Draco laughed, putting an arm around Harry’s waist, bringing him a bit closer. Harry barely noticed the gesture, too caught up in his ecstatic mood to react. It wasn’t the first time Draco became a bit touchy-feely while drunk, so he didn’t really think anything of it, it was nothing out of their ordinary.
“Friends?” Draco snorted. “The Saviour-Of-The-Entire-World, friends with a Malfoy? I don’t think Dumbledore’s fanclub would appreciate that.”
“He was nice to me.” Luna responded, her eyes and voice always so dreamy. “When I was a prisoner at the Manor. It was very boring there. But he tried to come talk to me and give me more food as much as he could.”
“The others I don’t mind, but since when do you defend Malfoy?” Hermione asked, raising an eyebrow.
“Hi.”
As Harry was about to call it a night and go back to his dorm without eating dinner, an employee from the Ministry went up to him, a neutral look on his face.
“I’m so sorry.” Harry whispered. “If I just had been quicker-”
Unfortunately, hiding away in muggle Paris meant that the Prophet had noticed Harry’s absence, and nearly every issue for the past week had an article speculating on where he was. Their favourite theory was that their precious Saviour was completing his Auror training in America. Harry and Draco had had a good laugh when the brunette had showed him the article Hermione had sent. Apparently, the wizarding community thought Harry couldn’t wait to go back to fighting dark wizards, as it was apparently his duty, when in reality he spent most his time with his former school enemy in gay bars.
He laughed and that was it, Draco was going to quit his job and run away.
“Shut up, Malfoy, it’s just cigarettes. I’m not on drugs or some shit. Just a nasty habit I picked up while trying to save all of your asses.”
Andromeda opened the door just as he was about to knock, a crying Teddy in her arms. She looked exhausted, had dark circles under her eyes, so the resemblance with her deceased sister was even more striking than usual.
“Dear Mr. Potter,
So that’s what he did. He thought about the Patronus lessons with Remus, the proud look in his eyes when he finally mastered it, the time he learnt Sirius was innocent, the first and only Christmas he had with him. He thought about the time Remus asked him to be his son’s godfather, and the time he contacted them through Umbridge’s floo powder network to ask them about his dad.
“Dear Mr. Potter,
The trial for the Carrows will take place on May 27th at 9am, followed by Rookwood’s at 2pm, and Avery’s at 5pm.
“So I’m just an object you come to when you’re bored? I’m offended.”
“Harry, don’t.” George took Harry’s hands in his own and looked at him in the eyes. “It’s not your fault. You saved all of us. You did everything you could. Don’t blame yourself. I know you feel guilty but it’s
“I know. That’s my entire personality.” He got a bit closer again.
Draco stared at Harry for a few seconds.
“It was good. Really good, actually. Quite unexpected. I didn’t plan to travel, I originally just wanted to stay in muggle London, but… It just sort of happened.”
Harry tore his eyes away from Draco, smiling as well.
They continued talking and laughing together while drinking their coffee during the entire date, Draco was really anxious about the whole thing but Harry was actually the nicest person he had ever met. He was funny, hot, had a lot of stories to tell and was very enthusiastic about everything Draco talked about. They were really comfortable with each other. After more than two hours, they got out of the café and looked at each other with soft smiles.
-It's amazing. The people, the teachers, the castle, the gardens, the food, everything. It was wonderful, I had a lot of friends and nobody treated me like some weirdo. We don't have such a good reputation because people who've only seen our oldest students during the Triwizard Tournament think that we're all the same, a bit shallow, superficial, but really it's just an image.
TW : panic attack and dissociative episode at the beginning of the chapter.
“I didn’t cheat!”
“Where did you get all these?”
The mood at the Burrow is a bit warmer than when I left. I think Molly’s new way of coping is to feed us until we explode and take care of us like we were all terminally ill. Everyone is still distraught, of course, but healing. I hope you’re healing too.
“Right, because I’ve bet you’ve been alive since the 16
“I thought you’d be here tonight, Scarhead.” Draco smirked, putting the cigarette between his lips and lighting it with the tip of his wand. This was an action Harry had already seen him do many times but it always fascinated him, the way everything Draco did looked so effortless and casual no matter what he did.
Barely a few minutes later, after they had talked about trivial things such as what Ron had eaten that morning, Harry went to the bathroom and splashed some water on his face. He looked at himself in the mirror and barely recognized the person staring back at him. He sighed and got dressed in simple but fancy robes that Mrs. Weasley had sent him for the trials.
“I was never exploited-”
“Oh shut up. I
Harry was only snapped out of his trance when the Wizenmagot announced a verdict: 15 years of imprisonment in Azkaban. It was much less than the others. If Lucius survived it.
“They’re Death Eaters!” Ron protested. “They’re the enemy.”
The blonde rolled his eyes and brushed past Harry, entering the hotel room.
He tried to push the thought to the back of his head and focused on Ginny who was talking about the new DADA teacher, a handsome Australian man with an equally gorgeous accent. He laughed a few times, trying to focus on the moment and not on Draco.
“Shut up, Ron. He was acquitted.” George protested, sighing. “I thought we said we didn’t want any more rivalries. The war is over.”
Harry had been contacted by Kingsley Shacklebolt – now acting Minister for Magic – two days prior, informing him that the few remaining Death Eaters who hadn’t died or been arrested right after the Battle had all been caught, and that he would inform him of the dates for the trials in the week. This was quick, Harry thought.
“I feel like you’re mocking me, Potter. I’ll have a Firewhisky, thank you very much.” He responded and went to sit in an armchair.
Harry nodded and looked outside, looking at the muggles walking on the side-walks, rushing to work, to meet with friends, to visit their families.
He set the letter on his bedside table and got up, stretching his aching muscles. Partying all night and sleeping all day really wasn’t having the greatest effect on his body. He was really bored, and tired of thinking endlessly about how odd the situation between him and the man next door was, so he decided to go pay Draco a visit.
Just like this morning, he was right on time and took his usual seat at the first row. A few minutes passes and Draco was brought in by two Aurors, like his father. His was so pale and thin his skin looked grey, almost transparent. He sat in the chair and the chains didn’t surround him. This was a good sign. It meant they knew he wasn’t dangerous. Harry listened attentively as the charges of torture and working for the Dark Lord were announced, and as Draco defended himself. He was then called to the stand. His green eyes locked with Draco’s grey ones and he felt his throat dry up.

“Famous Saint Potter is finally going to stop doing illegal shit to get wasted. Charming.”
He got up and went to the shower, scrubbing at his skin a bit less roughly than he usually did. His entire body was already very sensitive and bright red, rashes covering his chest due to scrubbing his skin with his fingernails on the really bad days under the burning hot water. He found that doing this was the only thing that made him feel some sort of control over his body, which had never been truly his before that night of May, not really.
However, all of the doubts and embarrassment vanished when they entered the room. It didn’t even look like a hotel room – it was more like a decent-sized apartment. Harry looked around him, amazed. They had a beautiful suite in a beautiful city. Forget the sharing a room problem – this was going to be awesome. What could go wrong?
Ginny made a small gesture towards the living room and they went to sit on the couch together.
“I don't think so, Potter!”
“Uh, no?”
So he let the tears flow, let his feelings of sadness and guilt and fear overwhelm him. He let himself go for the first time in weeks, because sometimes holding it all in hurt even more. He felt so helpless in these moments, he couldn’t stop thinking about all the people he had lost, all the families that had been destroyed because he hadn’t been quick enough. If only he had managed to destroy the Horcruxes sooner, if he had surrendered to Voldemort as soon as the Battle had began…
Harry nodded, agreeing, and turned his eyes back towards Draco. The blonde man had taken a seat with his Slytherin friends and they were all talking in hushed voices, ignoring the glares and glances some people were sending his way.
“I should ask the DJ to play a happy birthday song when the clock hits midnight! I mean, you’re used to the attention anyway!” Draco yelled in Harry’s ear.
(See the end of the chapter for
Harry unrolled the small piece of parchment and sat down on his bed to read it, a cigarette tucked between his lips.
After a few moments of intense staring, Draco raised back his head and met Harry’s eyes. They looked at each other for some seconds, and then the blonde winked at him before going back to his conversation. Harry felt a blush creeping up the back of his neck and lowered his head. Why did Draco have this effect on him? That was odd. That couldn’t be… No.
Harry was deep in conversation with George and Ron about the shop when the door opened again. He glanced up, and saw Draco come in. He was dressed in all black, except for a dark green shirt under his robes. His hair wasn’t sleeked back as it usually was when he went out, it looked like he’d just rolled out of bed. It looked good and Harry couldn’t help but stare.
-I'd love that.”
Draco laughed, rolling his eyes.
The receptionist took their information, gave them their keys, and the men went to their room in an uncomfortable silence. This was awkward. Great start.
Living there wasn’t very fun for now. Harry spent his entire days cleaning the place, since it had been empty since he, Ron and Hermione had had to flee a year ago. Only a few Aurors had come by over the summer to make sure Death Eaters weren’t using it as a hiding spot – thankfully, they weren’t.
Blaise and Draco were chatting, Draco leaning against the wall of a shop on the other side of the street, Blaise in front of him, and Harry felt like they were definitely flirting. He cleared his throat and went to lean on the wall beside Draco.
When everyone was finally seated around the Great Hall, Professor McGonagall made her entrance and went to the middle of the dance-floor for her speech.
“What’s going on?” Harry asked, as he let the blonde man in and closed the door behind him.
He had left most of the things in Regulus’s room as they were. He had just cleaned up everything and put most of his personal belongings in a box he’d stored in the attic. He didn’t want to throw away his things like he’d done with their parents’s. He hadn’t hesitated to destroy nearly everything he had found in their quarters. They had been awful and abusive, even worse than the Dursleys, and Harry didn’t think they deserved any kind of respect.
“What was that about?” Harry asked Draco, raising an eyebrow suspiciously.
“And I didn’t know I was supposed to keep you updated on what I do with my days.” Malfoy smirked at him. He knew how annoying he was, and Harry kind of wanted to slap him sometimes. But he liked getting to know this cheeky, playful side of Malfoy.
“Oh, uh, yeah, I’m sure. I want to move on from all of this. Taking my NEWTs just seems pointless, now.”
The Malfoys’ will be on May 29th, starting 9am.
“Nobody’s going to think that.”
“Am I part of them? To you?” Draco asked, his voice so low Harry wouldn’t have heard him if the room hadn’t been so quiet.
“I don’t know. It’s not like we have a lot of other options, right?” Draco answered, his face unreadable. He could be so unnecessarily mysterious sometimes.
They looked at each other in the eyes for a few seconds, before Draco broke the tension by getting up and going to the mini-fridge next to his dresser.
Was he stupid?
“Alright.” Draco’s eyes lingered on Harry for a few more seconds, and he then regained his composure, filling up their glasses with pure vodka with a simple flick of his wand.
Harry nodded and got up as well, and they went back to the Great Hall together. Harry suddenly felt much lighter, as if a huge weight had been lifted from his shoulders. He hadn’t realized until now how much he had needed George’s forgiveness. He went back to sit at his table and put his empty glass down. His sight was getting blurry and he didn’t want to be wasted in front of everybody or else the Prophet would have a field day.
“Oh, Harry, I just couldn’t imagine letting you deal with this alone. And I missed you. Ron is going to join us in a bit later, getting up before 8am isn’t really his thing.”
So he stood there. He didn’t know how to cope with this. He couldn’t stop it – Hermione had told him countless times to visit a Mind Healer, but Harry couldn’t bring himself to do so. He couldn’t let anyone see his weaknesses. It was too hard.
Harry rolled his eyes, smiling.
On the morning of May 27th, Harry was awoken by the sound of someone loudly knocking on his door. He grabbed his glasses from his nightstand and pushed them onto his nose. He looked around for a few seconds, confused, before remembering he was at the Leaky Cauldron. And he was going to be at the Ministry, in front of Death Eaters, in less than 3 hours.
“Yeah, well… I think I’ve fought with enough dark wizards for a lifetime.”
Draco looked up at him and stared with pure shock. Did the famous, handsome Harry Potter just agree to go out on a date with him? What the hell? And he didn't even drink Felix Felicis in the morning! He couldn't believe it.
“Oh, no, nothing like that. I just woke up and… Felt like coming back.”
Harry nodded, and Draco could see all the sincerity and compassion in his eyes. He didn't usually like pity but it was Harry bloody Potter and he wanted everything from him.
(See the end of the chapter for
The two friends sat on the sofa in Harry’s room and talked about the reparations of Hogwarts. Harry explained it all to her, happy to talk about something other than dead people and all of that nice stuff.
Staring at the ceiling, the man tried to empty his mind, but who was he kidding? He had always been bad at Occlumency, and trying to use it to block out his dark thoughts wasn’t going to help. Instead, he tried to go to sleep, but as soon as he closed his eyes, he saw Voldemort’s face. And then his face was replaced by Cedric’s, Sirius’s, Dumbledore’s, Lupin’s, Tonks’s, Fred’s… And the worst part was he had trouble accessing most of his last memories of them. He had forgotten most of the things that had happened during the Battle of Hogwarts, or during any of the other times he had had to fight for his life.
Harry smiled slightly and held the letter close to his heart. He missed his friends, he really did. Even though the way they babied him sometimes annoyed him, he knew it came from a place of deep love and care. After all they had been through together, after all the fights, the pain, but also the joy, the laughs… He knew nothing could ever come between them. Not even his own dark thoughts and terrible mood swings.
, Harry went on a short trip to Diagon Alley with Ron to buy new dress robes for the ball. Unfortunately, the place was packed, which got Harry a lot of attention. People rushed over to him to shake his hand, thank him, and he felt uncomfortable. He accepted it, offered them smiles, but he felt undeserving. He wasn’t the hero they thought he was. He was a wreck.
“Hey! You weren’t better than me, you cheated, and I didn’t.”
“Ouch. Hitting me right where it hurts.” Draco said, clutching his heart dramatically as Harry snorted.
“I didn’t think you’d be interested into going back to… The wizarding community.” Harry hesitated slightly, not wanting to offend him.
The door opened, and Molly Weasley gave Harry such a warm and happy smile he could feel all of his troubles go away.
Harry nodded, swallowing nervously. His hands were trembling. He didn’t know why he was so anxious about this, he knew it was coming, he had told the Ministry he wanted to testify at the trials of all of the marked Death Eaters. He quickly opened the letter, wanting to get it over with.
“They’re bad for your health. And for your teeth.” Hermione argued, crossing her arms on her chest.
The raven haired boy chuckled humourlessly. Of course he had to. That’s what everyone was expecting of him. He had to do it. He wanted to do it, anyway.
Harry rolled his eyes.
“Yeah, yeah. ‘M fine. I’m gonna go take a nap.”
Harry rolled his eyes and shoved him playfully.
After combing through his hair – which was, as always, unnecessary – he went back to the room and the three friends apparated to the Ministry. The security was reinforced, there were guards everywhere and everyone was controlled with very expensive looking objects in case some of Voldemort’s fanclub members wanted to get revenge for their master. Harry and his friends, who had been nicknamed the “Golden Trio” by the Prophet, walked to the Department of Mysteries, where the trials were to take place, and Harry stepped inside, not sure if he was ready to testify, but telling himself it was going to be fine.
“Now you’re interested in my sex life as well? Damn. You really are obsessed with me.”
“You’ve been in the loo for like 30 minutes, Harry!” Hermione exclaimed, a stern look on her face that reminded Harry a bit too much of McGonagall. “We thought something happened to you.” She sniffed the air, her nose wrinkling. “Have you been smoking again? I thought you stopped!”
“Is everything alright?” He asked.
“It's okay Draco, and I told you to stop calling me boss, it makes me feel old!”
“Right. Just wait till the Prophet finds out you’re a closeted queer. You’re going to have a brand new title after that.”
“Six shots of Firewhisky, please.” Harry asked the bartender, leaning slightly on the bar top.
“He told me a bit about that.”
“What are you doing?”
Harry didn’t see Draco again that week, but they did communicate a bit through letters. They talked about mundane things, like what they were up to that week. Harry learned that Draco had been working on some potions lately in his flat, and had already received complaints from neighbours because of the foul odour that sometimes emitted from his cauldron. Harry told him that he was still working on the house, and by Friday afternoon he was almost done.
Hermione still looked a bit sceptical, but she didn’t say anything indicating that she disapproved of the whole thing.
Harry could smell the alcohol in his breath, but he didn’t care. He looked up at him, and couldn’t help but glance at Draco’s lips. They looked so soft and rosy. And inviting. Part of his brain was screaming at him not to do it, but the other part, the little devil on his shoulder, was telling him to just say fuck it and kiss him.
“I think it’s his teeth. He’s not even 4 months old yet so he’s a bit young but it might be it. Nymphadora was an absolute nightmare when hers began growing.” Andromeda caressed the little man’s blue hair fondly while Harry was cradling him. He calmed down slightly but was still whining.
“It’s Malfoy.” The familiar voice responded.
When all of this was done, he took a quick break to eat a sandwich. Harry still had a hard time eating, but the sight of food didn’t make him feel sick anymore, so that was a good step forward.
The pair laughed and Draco gave Harry the rose he had bought a few hours earlier.
Harry could obviously see something was wrong, but he figured if Draco really wanted to talk about it, he would have, and his old nemesis was probably not his first choice to talk about his struggles anyway. The blonde left the room, and Harry went back to his novel.
“No, I swear!” Draco exclaimed as Harry was laughing like crazy. “I was looking for Pansy, my freaking Yule Ball date, and found her making out with Daphne outside in the bushes! I was so mad!”
He only had a few memories of the past night, none of them involving Draco. Well, his plan had failed, but at least it seemed like he’d had a good time. He got out of bed, quickly got dressed, and checked out, memories of doing that with Draco in Paris rushing back to him. Merlin, he was fucked. He really missed him. But he tried to push these thoughts away and went to a dark alley to apparate to the Weasleys.
“Thanks. And I’m finally gonna be able to order drinks without confusion charms!”
“That’s because your Pureblood family has been living in the same place since before baby Jesus was born you dummie. A lot of wizards live in normal, modern houses, not in huge scary manors. And the Ministry is modern. So is St Mungo’s.”
“Ginny! I just did your hair, stop touching it!”
“Muggle hater? How original. If you must know, I’m actually quite the sympathizer now. Who knew their alcohol was so much better than ours?”
The two men chatted for a few more minutes before Harry decided to get back to his table with the shot glasses they’d been too lazy to come and get themselves.
“No, I know that because he told me, because I’m not a brat with a superiority complex, and he liked me.”
The raven-haired boy nodded curtly at him before leaving, walking fast towards his dorm. He just wanted to lay down and take the time to mentally prepare himself for what was going to unfold over the next few days.
“Only one minute left.” Harry responded, smiling widely. Draco was looking at him in the eyes intensely, his pupils dilated, his breath smelling a mixture of mint, weed and alcohol. It wasn’t bad. He quite liked it actually. Wait, why was he thinking about Malfoy’s breath? That was weird. And a little creepy.
“Well, someone’s in a good mood.”
“Right. It’s not a big deal.”
Surprisingly, he was actually quite looking forward to this pub night. He missed Hermione and all of his other Hogwarts friends a lot, and he really hoped Ron would be able to come. Knowing him, he would. He never passed on a night of drinking a few pints. He was also wondering if Draco would come… But even if he didn’t want to, his friends would probably force him to go.
He had only been reading for a few minutes when he heard a soft knock on his door. He put down his book on the bedside table and went to open the door, coming face to face with Malfoy.
That night, Harry walked into the club at around 7pm, and was immediately welcomed by a warm hug for Hermione.
The blonde laughed, shaking his head.
“Don’t be. It’s not your fault. But enough about this, I’m taking you out to eat. You look like you haven’t eaten in weeks, Harry.”
Five days had gone by since Harry had come back to the Burrow. That was enough to remind him why he had decided to leave. Staying with the people he felt most guilty to have hurt triggered his panic attacks and night terrors like crazy. There wasn’t a single night where he didn’t wake up in a cold sweat at least twice, and it was now becoming a habit for him to have to go hide in the bathroom to have a panic attack in the middle of the day. Seeing so much grief in the eyes of those he had considered family for so many years absolutely broke his heart, and the worst part was he felt so, so guilty for Fred’s death. If he had just surrendered to Voldemort sooner…
“Evening.” He said, interrupting their conversation.
Harry laughed lightly, he knew Draco was agreeing with him but had too much pride to admit that the famous Gryffindor was right on that one. He was starting to know him better than the blonde thought.
“You bullied them for years. I don’t exactly feel sorry for you.” Harry laughed, stealing Draco’s cigarette from his hand to take a drag.
Ron’s ears turned a nice shade of tomato red, a sign that he was embarrassed, probably because he knew they were right and he was only making excuses to not dance.
“You’re right. We’ve all been through too much to continue these rivalries.” Fleur said, smiling. “Come on, Bill, let’s go to our seats.” She wrapped a perfectly manicured hand around her husband’s muscular arm and they went to sit at Percy and Penelope’s table. Charlie hadn’t been able to come, he was too busy with his dragons in Romania, and Harry suspected he’d rather spend time with them anyway.
“It’s fine, Draco. Really. Let’s just- not talk about it, alright?” Harry smiled at him, not even realizing he had called the blonde by his first name.
Harry smiled at her as she let go of him and invited her inside his room. It was big, bigger than the Gryffindor common room and his old dorm combined. It felt too big for him, but he guessed the Saviour-Of-The-Entire-World would have to get used to it. Even though he really didn’t want to. He hated seeing the looks of admiration he was getting all the time by Ministry employees and volunteers at Hogwarts, he hated the attention, and he hated being treated like some incredible being. He didn’t deserve it. He felt like an impostor.
And they went on like this for the entire night. Just drinking until all of the alcohol was gone, laughing until their stomachs hurt, and bickering over and over. It seemed so normal, the conversation flowing naturally, as if they had done this their entire lives. As if they were old friends. And of course the alcohol helped, but Harry felt comfortable with Malfoy. He knew it wouldn’t last, of course – once they went back to England, they were probably never going to speak again. But he was just so happy to be able to spend some time with someone who didn’t treat him either like a martyr or an idol. He finally felt like he had found someone who truly, deeply understood him.
Harry laughed, picturing a small Draco – which just looked like him now but much smaller – coming face to face with this horrifying sight.
But it wasn’t all pain. This place held some of their best memories too, like going outside after completing their exams, Harry and Ginny going on evening walks when they’d gotten together, going to the lake to play with the Giant Squid. And seeing it grow back to life after it had been destroyed by these Death Eaters was like meeting an old friend they hadn’t seen in a while. The atmosphere felt warm, and light. Like all the darkness that had clouded the air for two years had disappeared at the same time as the bodies, blood, and wreckage.
Harry was taken out of his daydreaming when a Barn Owl landed in front of him on the table, a letter in its beak. The raven haired boy took it, thanked the owl quietly as it flew away, and stared at it. It was from the Ministry.
“You were drunk. It’s fine. It just sucks that we don’t hang out anymore.”
“Yeah, right, you prefer gingers. And muscular French men.”
Malfoy stopped in his tracks but didn’t look at Harry.
“Harry! Ron! Guys, I’m so happy to see you.” Neville exclaimed as he walked towards them and gave a quick side hug to each of them. He looked good and healthy, though a small scar could be seen on his eyebrow, a reminder of his bravery. “Bill and Fleur are just over there.” He gave a nod towards the entrance of the Great Hall where, indeed, the married couple were talking with Professor Sinistra. “And I think I saw Percy and Penelope somewhere.” They chatted for some minutes, and then Neville left to go find Hannah Abbott.
Draco snorted.
Minerva McGonagall, headmistress.”
They stared at each other for a few seconds and Draco dropped his jacket. He went to sit on the bed opposite of Harry.
“You’re not planning on becoming an Auror anymore, then.” Malfoy stated.
“Oh don’t tell me you’ve joined SPEW, mate, it’s a jo-”
“Yeah, well. Maybe if he wasn’t such a little prick I would’ve shaken his hand and went to Slytherin.” Harry teased, and they started walking again.
He’d already seen the ones of the Marauders when he’d been here a year prior, but he couldn’t bring himself to do as much as glance at them again. It was too painful to see Sirius, Remus and his dad all being so happy, so careless with Wormtail standing right beside them, that person who had been their best friend, but also such an awful traitor.
Ignoring his bad thoughts, Draco took a deep breath and put on his outfit. The date couldn't be that bad, Harry was perfect, he wasn't mean.
“Of the dark wizards? Of course not, D- Malfoy. I wouldn’t… I wouldn’t have defended you in court, or asked you to stay here if I thought you were the next Dark Lord or something.” Harry replied, Draco chuckling lightly at his words.
Harry felt Draco’s stare on his neck as he regained his seat and didn’t dare look back at him. A few other people – Draco’s Slytherin friends – testified in his favour and, thankfully, the charges were dropped, the Wizenmagot stating he was too young to go against his family and had been manipulated since birth. Harry didn’t look at him as Draco left the courtroom and only raised his head when Narcissa Malfoy was brought in right after. In his testimony, he told the Wizenmagot all about how she saved his life in the forest that night three weeks ago, silently thanked her and left the courtroom after her charges were dropped as well. He just wanted to sleep for at least a week.
As everyone stared, the pain and suffering they were all feeling, reminiscing was so intense it could almost be touched. The last time most of them had been here, the courtyards were destroyed, lifeless or injured bodies were lying on the ground, people were screaming, fighting, dying. They’d never felt such pain before and going back made them feel it again, made them all go back to that night of May.
“I’m not just saying this because I’ve been drinking, Malfoy. I’m actually willing to try being friends with you. You’re not a bad person. You’re good company and you’re funny and I finally feel like my own fucking self when I’m with you.”
-Thanks, you don't look too bad yourself.”
Harry blushed furiously at this, not expecting Draco to be so blunt.
-Huh? Sorry, I was lost. I was thinking about the city. Do you often spend time in the muggle London?”
“Only a day? Did you not like it there?”
“Yeah. I know.” He responded with a small smile.
Malfoy looked absolutely stunned, like he had just received a Pertificus Totalus but without the whole falling to the ground part.
“Good evening, Mr. Potter. The Minister has asked me to inform you that he has booked a room for you at the Leaky Cauldron. He thinks it would be easier for you to stay there instead of travelling everyday for the trials.”
“I know, George, believe me, I do. And we talked about it a lot, and he’s sorry, he truly is. He’s not the same person he was in school. The war, it… It truly changed him. He knows better. And I don’t expect you guys to forgive him now, or ever, but he’s a better person now.”
“Merlin, Hermione, calm down, will you? I was just getting some air and smoked one cigarette, it’s not a big deal.” Harry sighed. He knew his friends just wanted the best for him but it was suffocating sometimes.
“That’s rough, man.” Draco whispered, painful memories of his own childhood coming back to him.
“Yeah, you did! You had Professor Snape’s old potions book!”
Harry laughed, shaking his head. His friend always knew what to say to make him feel better.
(See the end of the chapter for
That’s why, on that fifth night, he told the Weasleys and Hermione he was going to dinner at Andromeda’s to spend some time with Teddy and was probably going to sleep over. He felt guilty about using his godson as an excuse to escape from the house, but he really needed a break, just for one night. He was genuinely going to eat there, he just wasn’t spending the night and would instead go to muggle London after dinner, to the same club in which he had seen Draco three weeks prior. So at around 6pm, he left the Burrow and apparated to her front yard. It was the first time he visited his godson since his birthday and he was really excited to see him, he missed him everyday.
Once they had finished packing and checking out of the hotel, they went to the nearest International Apparition Point, which was much safer than regular apparition on long distances, and apparated to Florence, hand in hand.
But right as Harry was about to close the gap between them, a loud bang came from inside, and suddenly the Three Broomsticks erupted into flames.
They both turned their heads towards him, Blaise putting his hands in the pockets of his robes.
Harry apparated to London, smoked a cigarette for confidence and walked to the same club he had been to last time, hoping that Draco would be there again.
“They weren’t exactly fond of me. I was like- like a house elf, mostly.” Harry calmed down a bit as well, a smile still on his lips, but this one didn’t hold any trace of humour.
The door opened, revealing a very tired looking Malfoy.
“Merlin, are you always this dramatic?”
“I swear!” Harry laughed. “I swear I didn’t.”
When they entered the castle, however, it was different. People were staring at the reconstruction work, chatting excitedly, sharing stories… But Harry’s thoughts were interrupted when someone called their names.
“Mrs. Weasley misses you, you know. Everyone does.”
Ginny seemed to believe him, and if she didn’t, she didn’t say anything about it and changed the subject. They talked about Quidditch, about life at the Burrow, about Hermione’s parents. Just typical stuff. Harry hadn’t felt so normal in weeks, and he didn’t know if it was a good thing. Wasn’t his “normal” everything he had been running from in the first place?
Malfoy smiled slightly, clearly a bit uncomfortable. It was the first time they came close to talking about the war, and mostly the other’s allegiances, subjects they had both been avoiding for obvious reasons.
sorry for the late update! i was having a bit of writer's block but i'm back now. thank you for reading and i hope you enjoyed!
“‘Mione, leave him alone, it’s fine.” Ron said, putting a hand on her shoulder. “Come on, let’s dance.” He took her hand and she went with him, her frown evaporating instantly. ‘Let’s dance’ was a sentence Harry never thought he’d hear Ron pronounce.
But he didn’t say anything. He shut his mouth, just as he had for the past weeks. He bottled up his feelings, and ignored them. He didn’t have the right to complain. Not after all they had sacrificed to help him.
Draco ran his hand into his hair, struggling to find the right words. Harry was never going to say yes! He probably saw him as a child! Why did he have to be so stupid?
The eighth years have permission to go to Hogsmeade whenever they wish to and have a midnight curfew, so we’ve all decided to install a weekly bar night at the Three Broomsticks on Fridays. I hope you’ll be able to come. It feels weird to be back here without you and Ron, I miss you a lot.
“Honestly, it’s ridiculous. Their style is so nice and modern. Wizarding places have had the same architecture style for centuries! I mean, please, have you seen Hogsmeade? It’s like going back to the 16
“Shut up. I never investigated you, I just… Checked up on your devious plans.” He replied, making Draco laugh as well.
When Harry and his friends finally entered the school grounds, they were all amazed at how it looked, and sad at the same time. The grass had never been greener, Hagrid’s hut was bigger and the Quidditch pitch they could see from a distance had never looked so new. Even though Harry had participated in the reconstructions on the inside, he had never really paid attention to how everything now looked on the outside, especially considering most of this had been done after he’d left.
The young man was waiting in front of the muggle coffee shop with a single rose in his hand, waiting for his handsome date. When he saw Harry apparate a few feet further, he beamed at waved at him. The chosen one waved back and quickly walked towards Draco.
“Honestly, Potter, what was it like growing up with muggles? I mean, seriously, muggles! It must’ve been boring as fuck.”
“Malfoy-”
“Wow.” The blonde whispered, a small smile on his lips. “It’s splendid.”
“Really? I mean… That's great. I'll owl you the date and place and you'll tell me if it's fine bt you.”
Malfoy really looked like he was in his element when they walked in, and Harry wondered how he managed to always look so confident. He knew it was probably a facade, but still, he wished he could be more like him.
“Hey, ‘Mione, I didn’t know you would be coming!”
“Am I gay? Potter, have you seen me? Of course I’m fucking gay.”
When he finally went back to his room at the Leaky Cauldron, he collapsed on his bed and for the first time in months, his dreams were filled with grey eyes instead of red ones.
After spending the night in the hotel, Harry decided to go back to England. He had barely gotten any sleep and had spent the night thinking over and over about Draco, about why he kissed him, about why he left, about their trip together, about the fragile friendship that had been forming between them before everything collapsed.
“Let’s go back, yeah?”
“Smells nice.”
But the room was empty. Draco’s stuff was gone. And so was he.
“Dear Harry,
“The trial dates?” McGonagall murmured.
“Most of my time. I hate wizard places. Don't tell though, I don't want to get attacked.”
“My place?
Harry wandlessly summoned a quill from his desk and wrote a quick “I’ll be there” on the back of the parchment before calling Moon and attaching it to her leg.
Harry was running as fast as his legs could bear. He ran into the lobby, ignoring the confused-looking security guard, and ran up the stairs. All the man could think about was getting to the room before Draco had the chance to leave or worse. What if he hurt himself? Harry knew the man was very vulnerable, and this situation certainly wouldn’t help. He had seen it, he wasn’t stupid. He had seen the rashes around Draco’s dark mark when he thought Harry wasn’t looking, he had noticed the scars on his back, he had noticed how sometimes Draco wasn’t really there, how sometimes he would make self-decapitating jokes that were a bit too dark to be funny, how he had once said while drunk that Harry was the only thing keeping him alive as a joke, but it wasn’t really a joke, Harry knew that, and deep down Draco knew it too. And Harry had pretended not to remember. What an idiot.
As you know, I’ve been in Australia since the beginning of June to find my parents. I found them, Harry! I found them, and I took them to St Mungo’s, after a Confusion spell I’m not really proud of. I mean, they wouldn’t have believed me if I had told them the truth. Several Healers are working on bringing back their memory. I’m so happy. My spell was quite strong, so it’s going to take some time, but they’re hopeful, and so am I. I visited them last night, and my dad told me he felt like we had met before, which is a very good sign. I found them only two days ago, and I’m staying at the Burrow until the Healers manage to bring back all of their memories, and then I’ll go home for a bit. I’ve missed them so much.
“I see I’m not the only one who’s spent time thinking about the other’s career path.”
“I couldn’t miss the opportunity of seeing all of these people who love me so dearly.” Draco said sarcastically while glancing at the people in the bar.
“You're quieter than usual.
“He’s right here with you, George. He’s watching over you and he’s not going anywhere, I promise.”
There was a long silence following Harry’s words, who internally cursed at himself for saying too much. Malfoy didn’t need to know that. Oh, Merlin, he needed to stop talking. He was screwed.
“Right.” Draco scoffed as they entered the hotel lobby.
Harry sighed, leaning back in his chair. There it was. The long awaited conversation about his friendship with Malfoy. But Harry wasn’t planning on letting his friends debate on it – he’d saved the world, and he felt like that gave him a pass to become friends with an ex-Death Eater.
“I missed you too, Mrs. Weasley.” He replied, letting go of her with a small smile. Now that he was close to her, he could see how tired she looked, and a wave of guilt washed over him.
The next few seconds were a mess of shouts and hugs, the two lovers running to their best friend. Harry hugged them tightly, he had missed them a lot too. These past two weeks, he had realized that the resentment he sometimes felt towards them was unjustified, and was just what his guilt made him feel when it all got too much to handle.
“Well, they are students after all.” Bill replied, turning his head to the table as well.
He hadn’t dared ask Draco whether he was coming to pub night or not. Harry was always a bit afraid of reaching out to him, this friendship was so new to the both of them and he didn’t want to seem too pushy.
“I’m tired of having girls try to grind on me.” Was the only explanation Malfoy had offered when Harry had asked him why he wanted to go to a gay club, but the smirk on his face made the Saviour think there was more to it.
“Shall we?”
Talking to his classmates was the last thing Harry wanted to do, but Ernie had lost a lot too, protected him, and he didn’t want to be rude to him. He didn’t deserve to be on the receiving end of Harry’s frustration, grief, anger and trauma.
Hermione looked at Harry suspiciously, which made himself shift on his feet uncomfortably. Why did she always look like she could read his thoughts?
Harry watched as his nemesis buried his face in his hands, he was trying to hide his vulnerability, but the raven haired boy could see right through him.
“Of course I'd love to go out with you.”
Harry frowned. Now he was starting to get angry. Draco knew Harry hated when he mentioned Dumbledore and he didn’t understand why he was being such a prick about it.
The two men walked together to a fancy hotel in the city they had found on a pamphlet in a travelling agency back in Paris and went to ask the woman at the reception for two separate rooms. She looked at her computer, frowning.
So when he felt the familiar rush of anxiety, he would quietly go to Ron’s room upstairs and tell the owl everything that was bothering him. Most of it had to do with Fred, or with how he wished he could go back to London without telling anyone, but didn’t want to cause the Weasleys and Hermione any more worry. He missed going out dancing, he missed kissing strangers, he missed the feeling of light-headedness that came with drinking, he missed smoking with Draco, and he missed feeling like he didn’t have a care in the world. He missed feeling alive.
“Shut up.” Harry muttered, looking at the ground. “You’re being annoying.”
It was Draco's last day at work before Christmas break, and he wanted to ask Harry out. He would probably never have the courage to do so, but the bloke was very cute and also very much bi, from what Draco had heard. It was a relief, because he'd had a crush on him for months, and always thought he was straight and dating Ginny Weasley, a famous quidditch player, but from what the Daily Prophet said, they had been an item at Hogwarts but broke it off after leaving school.
Malfoy burst out laughing.
Harry smiled to himself and opened his eyes after a few minutes, coming back to reality. He felt that thinking about the people he loved in a happy way instead of trying not to think about them at all made his heart ache just a bit less. Maybe he could find peace one day. Maybe he could heal and ease his guilt. They did saving him, after all, and they wouldn’t have wanted him to dwell on the past, and on what could have been.
“Yeah, friends, you nitwit. At first I thought we’d stop speaking after going back home but then things started to change between us. But I guess I was wrong. And you know I don’t want to talk about Dumbledore.” Harry said coldly.
Harry laughed loudly, he liked how Malfoy made fun of his title of saviour. Almost everybody treated him as a hero, but the Slytherin laughed about it, and it might’ve seemed rude to others, but Harry knew it was just how Malfoy was. And it felt nice to not be put on a pedestal he didn’t deserve.
“Harry, be careful!”
Oh no. Travelling with Draco, partying with him – it was nice. But sharing a room? That meant spending a lot more time together. He wasn’t sure if it was a good idea. But they didn’t know the city and he really liked this place.
As Harry pushed open the front door of the Burrow, he was surprised to hear excited talking coming from the kitchen. It wasn’t common to hear people sounding so joyful in the house anymore, especially not in the morning. He walked to the kitchen, still a little drowsy and was welcomed by two very happy Ginny and Hermione and a defeated-looking Ron.
Draco smiled at him and unpacked his new clothes, folding them carefully, and putting them in the dresser next to his own bed. They had only spent two weeks in Paris and yet he had had the time to buy a whole new wardrobe, mostly made of black, brown, white and emerald green, the only colours he ever really wore. But Harry couldn’t criticize him on this considering his own questionable fashion choices.
The more he stared in the mirror, the more he felt like he couldn’t recognize his own body, or his surroundings. He felt disconnected from everything. He was starting to dissociate. Again.
“I don’t think I’m going to take anyone.” Harry said, shrugging. There wasn’t anyone he wanted to take as a date, and he was going to get enough attention as it was.
“Don’t get me wrong, she’s the most loyal friend you’ll ever have. She just has a temper. And she’s kind of mean but I am too, so I guess that’s why we’re so close.”
Harry laughed and Draco wanted to die. His cheeks were probably as red as a tomato now and he wanted to run away and hide under his desk for the rest of the day.
“What are these pricks doing here?” Ron asked, following the direction of Harry’s eyes. For a second, Harry wondered what he was talking about, but then he noticed that Draco wasn’t alone at his table. He could also spot Pansy Parkinson, Blaise Zabini, Millicent Bulstrode, someone he didn’t really know but he guessed could only be Daphne Greengrass, and Theodore Nott.
“Huh, sorry boss, I didn't see you.”
“Thank you so much for having me, Mrs. Tonks, I had a great time.”
“So, what owes me the pleasure, Potter? I thought you said you didn’t want to go out tonight.”
Harry laughed once again and shook his head.
“I’ve known Lucius Malfoy for several years. I’ve never seen him express any type of empathy towards me, or Voldemort’s victims, or regret of his decision of joining the dark side until Voldemort took residency at his Manor. He has tried to kill me countless times ever since I was 12 and tried to sell me to Voldemort when I was caught by Snatchers and brought to his Manor a couple of months ago. However, I do believe him when he says he regrets his actions. He didn’t fight during the Battle of Hogwarts, and I also believe him when he says he had been wanting to leave Voldemort’s side for months. But this doesn’t change all of the actions he has done over the years. That’s all I have to say. Thank you.”
“What the f-”
“I’ll write a letter to Hermione. I’m sure it’ll be fine, don’t worry about it.”
“You want something to drink?” Harry asked
“Well it’s true. But I had just been told the man who murdered my parents was a Slytherin so I asked the hat to put me somewhere else. If I’d known sooner that the snitch who told Voldemort where my parents were hiding was a Gryffindor, maybe I would’ve been in Slytherin.”
Harry laughed and Draco smiled, understanding what he wanted to say.
George smiled back at him and got up.
And sometimes when they were in the same room late at night some words were thrown around and they acted like they were all jokes even though they weren’t. They both knew how broken the other was, and they didn’t do anything about it, both of them finding comfort in knowing that they understood each other without saying the words out loud.
Malfoy was as broken as him, and Harry knew what this could lead to, and he hadn’t done anything, and now the boy was Merlin knows where, drunk, alone, confused, probably very pissed at himself, and had apparated while under the influence which was incredibly stupid and so dangerous, and Harry’s thoughts were all over the place, and he was starting to have a panic attack.
“Thank you.” Harry tried to smile but it mostly came out as a grimace and he hugged George quickly, tapping his back. “You’re going to be okay. I know it’s hard and it hurts but it gets easier with time.”
“Alright, fine, I’ll go. But only because I don’t want you to dance with another bloke.” Ron said, and Hermione went to sit beside him, pecking his cheek. “Are you two gonna go together?” He asked Harry and Ginny as Hermione glared at him.
In these moments, the man completely lost track of time. Nothing felt real. Had he been in the bathroom for 15 minutes or 3 hours? He wouldn’t have been able to tell.
Draco chuckled humourlessly.
It was silent for a few moments, both men seemingly deep in thought. Harry was thinking about Malfoy. He was so different from the mocking, bullying boy he had known in school. War changes people, of course, but there was a lot more to it. He seemed so much less judgmental, more educated, more open-minded. Harry had noticed his behaviour start to change in sixth year, when he had been given the task to kill Dumbledore. This was probably when Malfoy had started realizing how evil Voldemort and Death Eaters were.
He pushed the glasses up his nose and sat up quickly, taking in his surroundings. Unfamiliar. Where the hell was he? He had been planning on coming back to the Burrow early in the morning as to not raise suspicions on his… Nightly activities and just pull an all-nighter. This wasn’t part of the plan. Was he in a hotel? In muggle London, again? How the hell had he checked in so late at night? Well, at least he was alone and not with a random stranger, but he really had to stop spending so much money on hotel rooms or else he would end up broke.
He also saw a few Slytherins hanging out, but they only briefly glanced at him before going back to their conversations. He didn’t blame them – they’d never talked before apart from the occasional rude comments in the hallways and classrooms. There was Pansy Parkinson, Blaise Zabini, Daphne Greengrass, Millicent Bulstrode and Tracey Davis. They seemed to be the only Slytherins who’d come back to finish their education.
“Oh come on, Ron. They’re not Death Eaters, Malfoy became one against his will and his charges were dropped and the others were never charged with anything. And the war is over, there’s no enemy.” Harry said, rolling his eyes.
He looked at her and she smiled gently at him. He had daydreamed about seeing that smile and those beautiful eyes again for weeks, months when he was on the search for the horcruxes, but now he wasn’t sure how to feel about this. About them and what they used to be. About her.
“You wish. I was just looking at the growing pimple in the middle of your forehead, you git.”
“You’re gay?!”
He was panicking. Partying with Draco Malfoy was one thing. Travelling together was odd enough. But kissing? No. It must’ve been a dream. Why had Draco kissed him? And why had he left? What was even happening? Harry was so confused, but only one person could help him answer these questions, and this person was gone. He had to find him before Draco did anything stupid.
Malfoy looked up at him, frowning.
“What are you talking about, Potter? You despise me.”
“You’re a Gryffindor.” He replied, looking dead serious.
“Whatever. Pass me the booze.”
“You don’t have to do it, you know, Potter. No one would blame you.”
“I think I’ll pass. I’m super tired.”
It felt good for Harry to finally have someone who understood his jokes, who knew that he didn’t actually think they were funny but used them to cope. Draco always made him feel the same thing, every time they saw each other; understanding.
She nodded slightly and patted his cheek gently, in an almost motherly manner. Harry knew she was worried about him but he hated it. He didn’t want anyone’s pity. Not after all the hurt he had caused them. Hermione had erased her parents’ memories for Merlin's sake. Ron had lost his brother. Mrs. Weasley had lost her son. His godson had lost his father. He hated that everyone treated him like a hero or a baby when he was the reason for their suffering.
“Your house-elf is back, friends.” He said as he lay the glasses on the table before taking back his seat.
“Honestly, Potter, you’re a wizard, you should start acting like one. This spell isn’t that hard. How you could even survive last year is beyond me.”
“We talked. He changed. We get along. There’s nothing more to it. I thought you agreed that we didn’t need more rivalries.”
“Don’t flatter yourself.” He answered.
“Just because we’re not going out tonight doesn’t mean I don’t want to get wasted.”
It was midnight in a few minutes. Draco and Harry were dancing together in a club, their bodies nearly touching, only a few small centimetres separating them. They had smoked a bit with some guys they didn’t know in front of the club before going in and had had a bit too many shots, so they were completely wasted, as always. The music was loud, the club was packed, it was hot. But as with everything these days, they didn’t care, too caught up in their spiral of denial of their feelings, trauma and self-destruction.
“Who’s this?”
This didn’t mean he had compassion for Death Eaters – he hated every single one of them with a burning passion. But Draco was an exception. When Harry had had visions of what Voldemort had been seeing during the war, he’d seen Draco torturing people, and he didn’t think he could ever forget the look of sheer horror on the boy’s face. Because that’s what they both had been. Boys. Not men ready for war.
“We should go back before people start to think you’ve been kidnapped.” Draco said, getting up.
i hope you enjoyed! it was very short, sorry :( but its mostly a transition to the second act of the story. next chapter is going to be... pretty eventful. hehe
“Now that’s what I like.”
Harry had found a picture of Sirius and Regulus hidden away in the latter’s bedroom, though. They seemed to be around 13 years old, and were both wearing fancy evening robes. Sirius had a cheeky smile, his eyes gleaming with mischief. Regulus looked very solemn, clearly behaving with more decorum than his older brother, but Harry could still see the corners of his lips twitching as he was trying to repress a smile.
“What do you want, Potter?”
“Who invited this guy?” Ron said quietly as he looked at Malfoy.
Draco immediately nodded enthusiastically, he really wanted to go on another date with Harry. He liked him even more now.
“Spent a lot of time thinking about my career path, Potter?” Malfoy smirked.
Finally, after Ron kindly told everyone to bloody leave him alone, they entered Madam Malkin’s shop and bought some plain black robes, pretty but nothing too fancy, and quickly apparated back to the Burrow. Harry hated going to Diagon Alley. It was a place he once thought of as magical and wonderful, and now it just reminded him that everyone saw him as some sort of supernatural being, when he saw himself as nothing more than a complete fraud.
Harry was getting a bit bored, and he hated dancing, so he took his drink and went outside. He looked around a bit and saw George sitting on a bench, so he went to sit beside him.
“No offence, Harry, but you look terrible. Have you been sleeping well?” Hermione asked as she looked at him, her forehead creasing with worry. Bold of her to say that considering her dark circles were bigger than most of the stones Harry spent his days fixing at Hogwarts.
Harry felt his cheeks and ears flush but he played it off, trying to seem nonchalant about it.
“Nothing. We were just talking.”
“Oh, uh, thank you, sir.”
Draco smiled slightly, it was now or never. He hated himself for being so shy, it always fucked everything up with guys. He was usually really confident, but when he was in front of beautiful men, he was completely different. Seeing him not moving and staring, Harry smiled, amused by the situation.
And it was all he had left of Sirius. He didn’t want to sell it to the first person who offered.
“Don’t be a dick, Ron, they’re not all bad. Just because their parents are Death Eaters doesn’t mean they are too.” Harry said, frowning.
Harry usually was a terrible liar, but he thought this one was pretty believable. And even if she didn’t believe him, he wasn’t ready to talk about it yet. He wanted to figure things out with Draco before that, talk to him. But he had gotten to know the Slytherin and he knew it wouldn’t be that easy.
“I don’t know if you’re aware, Potter, but there’s this thing called a grocery store. That’s where most people buy their food.”
Harry laid back in his chair, watching his friends dance while sipping on his Firewhisky. He could see a lot of his loved ones having fun, and he was genuinely happy for them. They didn’t even seem to be paying attention to Draco, which was a good thing since Harry now knew how much shit he got when he simply put a foot outside. He could also see Pansy Parkinson and Daphne Greengrass dancing very inappropriately, making him laugh. It felt good to see everyone look so carefree after all they had been through, even the people he disliked. Nobody deserved going through a war.
“I’m not talking about that. You and Malfoy are buddies now?” He interrupted him, frowning.
Malfoy laughed before going back to his serious facade.
He didn’t really pay attention to it, though, his thoughts going to Draco, wondering if he was going to come. It wasn’t very likely since he avoided public wizarding places in fear of getting hexed by everyone he walked past, but maybe his friends would convince him to go. Harry hoped they would, because this might be his only chance to talk to him and clear things up.
“Didn’t dissuade you from coming too, I see.” Harry responded. He sat as well, knocking back his shot of Firewhisky. If the others wanted theirs, they could come and get them.
Harry tried grabbing Malfoy’s arm, tried to hold him back, to tell him that it was alright, that they were drunk and wouldn’t even remember it the next day, but Draco had disapparated in the middle of the club, not even bothering to hide from all the muggles, who were probably too drunk to notice him anyway. Harry’s brain was still fuzzy and holy shit he had just kissed Draco Malfoy. What the fuck. What the fuck? He ran a hand in his messy hair, the effects of the alcohol quickly evaporating.
“Don’t care.” Harry shrugged. “I don’t see anything wrong with it, so if they do, well. It’s not exactly my problem, is it?”
“I was just wondering, if, like, you would… Want to go out for coffee one day with me?”
“Come on. You and I both know it’s true.” Draco said, smirking. Harry finally noticed he’d gotten a lot closer to him in the past few seconds.
“They are. I’m a Death Eater, Potter. You don’t know how the entire wizarding world treats me.”
century!”
“I’m sorry.” Harry whispered as the elevator stopped on the atrium floor. They stepped out and made their way to the apparition points.
“Come on, Harry, it will be fun. We’re gonna be able to see everyone again.” Hermione said.
As 10pm rolled around, the brunette figured it was probably time for him to leave. Andromeda walked him to the door and hugged him quickly.
She linked her arm through his and began walking to the elevator.
He loved his friends so much, and he loved Mr. and Mrs. Weasley, but he was suffocating in there. He felt trapped, his mental health was shit, and he just wanted to go be young and stupid again. But they wouldn’t understand. It wasn’t their way of coping and Harry didn’t know if he wanted to face their disapproval. He was an adult, yes, but the last thing he wanted was to feel judged by the people he loved most.
Draco took a seat on a barstool next to him, getting a cigarette from his pocket. Merlin bless the bars that let you smoke inside.
Had Harry missed something? Of course Ginny and Luna were just friends, why did she feel the need to defend herself?
Harry sighed, running a hand through his already very messy hair. He jotted down the dates on a planner. This was going to be hard. Professor McGonagall put a comforting hand on his shoulder.
“What?” Harry turned his face to look at him.
“Quit staring at my ass, Potter, will you?” Draco said as he finished unpacking and turned back to face Harry.
Harry stared at him, and for the first time in his life he felt relieved to see Draco Malfoy. He would finally be able to talk to him and figure out why the hell he had kissed him and left. He didn’t know how he’d be able to get him alone, but he would find a way. He always did.
However, when Harry woke up on May 29th, he knew these weren’t going to be like the others. It was the Malfoys’ trials, he had no idea what to do about Lucius, who he knew had wanted to leave Voldemort’s side, and he wasn’t ready to face Draco.
The Great Hall had been the first place, along with the entrance, to be fixed. It looked almost brand new. The fake sky was a clear blue, with no clouds in sight, sunlight filtering into the room. It was beautiful. Clearly Professor McGonagall’s work.
“I don’t care about the stupid Prophet.” Harry interrupted him. “We were starting to become friends and it was fun going out together and I hate that we’re back to practically being strangers.”
The next day, Harry woke up at 9am. He had only managed to get a few hours of sleep, and he was exhausted, but his body just didn’t want to go back to sleep. So he went to the bathroom, took a shower, and looked at himself in the mirror – he looked like shit. His dark circles were worse than ever, his skin looked pale, he was getting skinnier, as if he wasn’t skinny enough already. He couldn’t believe the person staring back at him was, well, him. It felt as if someone else was in his mirror, a stranger who looked awfully familiar for some reason.
The owl pecked his hand a few times before flying downstairs, where she’d gotten used to getting her own snacks from the pantry. She was smart, just like Hedwig, and good at taking care of her own needs.
Ginny and Luna were talking very closely, Ron was still talking with George, but Hermione was staring right back at him, her eyes full of questions. Harry just shook his head and gave her a look that clearly meant ‘I’ll tell you everything later’, so she just got back to her chat without insisting. A few other people around the bar were staring at them, but Harry just ignored them. He didn’t owe them an explanation.
“You look gorgeous.
“Oh, shut up. You wish.”
“I’m much more of a Slytherin than you think, Malfoy. The Sorting Hat wanted to put me there but I asked it not to because I’d heard all Slytherins were evil dark wizards.”
“I am also proud of all of those who have fought valiantly and who lost their lives doing so. We wouldn’t have won this war without them, so I would like for all of us to take not a minute of silence, but a minute of applause in their memory.”
“I don't believe I am. Thanks Draco, it's really sweet.”
“What was that about, Harry?” Ron asked him, looking a bit upset.
“Yeah. Kreacher will kill me if he comes back here, it was his dream to have his head displayed there once he died. Completely nuts, that one.”
“What the fuck!” Harry laughed at Draco’s words. Apparently he wasn’t the only one to be amazed.
“If you count being exploited and abuse as boring, it certainly was boring as hell.” Harry said, laughing, not even realizing how dark what he had just said was. But Draco had.
Draco rolled his eyes but let him in nonetheless. It was the first time Harry came in Draco’s room, and it was the complete opposite of his. Everything looked neat and tidy. Harry’s was a complete mess. He went to sit on the sofa across Draco’s bed, the other man joining him.
The two men had spent the best day since they had left together. After unpacking all of their stuff, they had left the hotel and visited the city. It was absolutely beautiful, they had eaten at a small pizza place, and Harry had managed to eat a full meal for the first time in months. They had made some small talk, and were getting much closer. They actually had a lot in common, and liked a lot of the same stuff. They were both fans of wizard rock bands and had the same favourite wizard authors, though Draco had made fun of Harry’s lack of knowledge on the subject. A bond was forming between them, and though they couldn’t fully understand it, they didn’t do anything to stop it.
Ron and Hermione looked at him as though they’d just seen a flying Blast-Ended Skrewt.
“You wouldn’t have killed me.”
Percy hadn’t been to the Burrow in a few weeks. Ron had told Harry he’d spent some time there right at the end of the war to make things right with his family again and apologize for pretty much just being a shitty son for the past few years, and had then gone back home to his girlfriend. Things were alright between him and the Weasleys now, and they still didn’t see each other too often, but their relationship was becoming strong again.
The boy turned over in his bed, curling up in a ball. Some people talked about how they were so broken they didn’t have tears in their bodies anymore; but Harry had too much. No matter how much he sobbed, he always had more tears left to cry.
”Sally, right?”
“...so I wanted to know whether it’d be okay if I returned the movie on Tuesday instead of today?”, he finished. Harry’s heart sank, and he hated the fact that it did. Why was he actually hoping for Draco to invite him to his place? For what? A
Harry blinked, discombobulated. But Draco was blushing, too. Emboldened, he said: “Umm.. technically in about twenty minutes”.
“Well, how about
Harry suddenly noticed how they were still standing, in front of a perfectly suitable couch, so he sat down and pulled Draco with him who adjusted his position so that they were sitting across from each other, Draco’s knee along Harry’s thigh. Now it was Harry who initiated the kiss, lightly pulling Draco closer with his hands on the Blonde’s neck. As Draco was moving closer and readjusting his position once again, his knee was coming closer and closer towards Harry’s crotch and when he reached it, Harry let out a small sound into their kiss and he swore he could feel Draco grinning into the kiss.
It was like their bodies moved in unison, as if they didn’t need to communicate through words any longer. With a shift Harry sat down on the couch with his back now aligned with the couch back and Draco was in his lap, still kissing him fiercely. Harry let his hands run all over Draco’s body, first his neck and his back, the back of his thighs, which he began to stroke rhythmically. “Fuck, Harry, please”, Draco let out, breaking their kiss.
When Francis and Harry left Harry's room, they found the kitchen-living room area empty and the duvet was neatly folded on the sofa, almost like no-one had slept there. Francis was about to come up with some theories about the whereabouts of their new flatmate, when the front door was opened and Malfoy entered the flat, carrying a ridiculously large bag with "Baked Goods" imprinted on it.
. Harry could just go back to his room and hide in there forever but decided that he didn't kill Voldemort to hide from Draco Malfoy. Plus, the now opened bag sent out a delicious scent. Uncomfortably, Harry sat down at their kitchen island after pouring himself a very much needed coffee. "Oh, and I went to the grocery store to get some almond milk. I'm vegan, you see". Of fucking course. Draco bloody Malfoy was now moving in with Muggles in a Muggle area, buying vegan products because he's always been against cruelty. Fucking perfect. Harry felt pranked.
"You pay rent, right?", Harry asked.
The next thirty minutes left Harry speechless, witnessing how Asteria befriended Draco Malfoy. When Malfoy had seemed relaxed yesterday, then he seemed at ease now. He was making funny comments, actually listening to Asteria's stories and had a genuine smile on his lips throughout the whole conversation. "Did it ever occur to you that candles are just our attempt to hold fire as pets?" was the question that let Harry snap back to reality. "Now that I think about it... it's really adorable", Malfoy answered and Asteria giggled. Since when did Malfoy use words like adorable? Did he wake up and decided "I'm going to be a good person now"? This confusion was slowly turning into anger, Harry noticed. "Harry, darling, is everything alright? You're so quiet", Asteria asked in her soft voice. "Yeah, just tired, sorry. I'm gonna leave you to it. G'night", he announced, not caring that it was only after eight pm.
Luna took the glass and brought it to her lips, drowning the shot instantly. Everyone was staring at her, thrilled and sceptical all at once. A few seconds passed, but nothing happened. Luna was still seated, looking dreamy. “Do you feel something?”, Hannah Abbott asked curiously, glancing at her friend. “Not really. Just feels… nice”. A few disappointed huffs were audible, the anticipation dying down instantaneously.
“Yes. Well, no. I absolutely saw Claire and Bender ending up together”
Saturday evening was almost there and Harry was torn apart between malingering through the evening so that he wouldn’t have to go to The Bull Eye and showing up with a fabricated enthusiasm that he would slowly work up with drinks. After pondering about his possibilities and one urging firecall from Seamus later, he was standing in front of the bathroom mirror to tame his hair. His beard was finally freshly shaven again and he’d even got himself to wear a black button-up with linen trousers, a fashion choice he hadn’t made three years ago but was now able to pretend he felt comfortable in. Well, mostly he had managed to gather the confidence from the various compliments Ginny, Luna and Hermione (sometimes even Blaise, which was a boost Harry lived on for days after) had given him when he first wore something outside his comfort zone.
-----
"I went out to get croissants", he declared, leaving Harry dumbfounded.
“Why the hell would you think that?”. Draco sounded hurt. He was backing off more and more from Harry, seemingly decreasing their vicinity with every word Harry said.
“Oh, I know”, Harry said, just when Ron arrived, breathing heavily and beads of sweat on his face. “I’m here. I’m ready”
. Fine. Show me, then. Sorry, mate”, he nodded at Draco but already ensconced himself next to Pansy, knowing full well that this could take a while. At that, Harry stood up, wordlessly, and felt a few pairs of eyes looking at him with curiosity. “Um-“
"How many are there left?", Draco asked while the box was still in Harry's hand. It was only now that Harry noticed that not only Draco's hair looked unkempt, the blonde's whole face looked weary verging on exhausted. Harry almost forgot to reply but remembered that he'd been asked something, taken aback by the mystery that was Draco Malfoy. "5, so one for you now and then there's 4 more". "The Golden Boy can do maths, how utterly impressive". His voice was soft but somehow tired as well.
So when Monday arrived, Harry was a nervous wreck. He had called Seamus and Dean already to thank them again for wanting him to be their best man. After Harry and Draco’s almost-kiss, they had rushed towards their table again to find a crying Dean and an almost-crying Seamus, arms slung around each other, amidst people cheering and Luna opening a bottle of champagne. “Maybe not a baby bath, but definitely a wedding”, Draco had whispered into his ear and it had made Harry all fuzzy inside.
“I’m glad they did”
Draco smiled again and said: “Listen, I really liked the movie and I’d like to rewatch it tonight..”, he made a small pause. Harry’s heart stopped. Was Draco Malfoy inviting him to watch a movie together?
“When are you getting off, then?”
Reluctantly, he opened his eyes. He met Draco’s eyes, which seemed to sparkle with emotion, want, desperation. He crashed his lips on the other boy’s again, this time giving away all he felt. There was a crash of teeth but it didn’t matter, it didn’t make a difference. At this very moment, Harry suddenly knew exactly what he had to do. He opened his eyes again, met Draco’s again, who looked at him with curiosity. Harry brought his index finger in front of his lips- they needed to be quiet. He motioned to the door and quirked his eyebrow in a questioning manner. The Slytherin just smirked. Hoping they didn’t make a sound- which in hindsight, frankly, was pretty damn improbable but the two of them had no time to think- Harry got to his feet. Pulled from an emotion that both of them had been burying for too long, they rushed to the door on tiptoes.
“Wait, let me finish. That you don’t know if you want the job is something you need to figure out on your own. But you have to start believing that you deserve good things. You deserve everything you want. And I’m not just saying that because I am very tipsy, I’m saying it because I mean it. And probably because your cologne is very intoxicating”
“I dare you to sit in Hannah’s lap for the next three rounds or to try the potion”, Ron declared after a few seconds had passed. Draco shot a look at Abbot, who, of course, was blushing heavily. He rolled his eyes at the sight. Potter would never be interested in
“What? No! I just.. I just thought you didn’t want to be serious”
“Anything else?”, he asked, now standing and readjusting the collar of his shirt to make it less awkward. He looked at the round, but they were all shaking their heads. When his eyes wandered across Pansy’s face, something of a glint shot through her eyes. “Actually, Draco told us to order him something while he’s at the loo. Anything will do”. Harry again averted his eyes to the empty seat, a half full glass with Firewhiskey situated in front of it. Confused, Harry nodded and made his way to the bar. He knew Draco was quite dainty, leaving him with few options. He seemed to be fine with Firewhiskey, but just getting that again would be boring. Harry, frankly, never got around to knowing all too many cocktails, so he was at a loss. Something fancy, but not too fancy, it mustn’t look like he was trying too hard.
“So, what were you all dressed up for earlier?”, Harry asked when they had reached a small alcove, far away from the other chain- and occasional smokers gathered outside. Even though it was mid May, the shirt Harry was wearing didn’t suffice to keep him from shivering just a little bit. Draco’s hand was so elegantly holding a cigarette, he felt stupid without one. He didn’t know what to do with his hands.
"What? The kiss? Yeah. But only to see if you would actually move along with it". The blonde's voice was infuriated now and Harry felt his heart ache, literally. So it had all been a game from Draco's part, after all. He couldn't believe he'd been stupid enough to fall for it.
Harry was about to come up with a witty response when Draco continued:"You're right, 11 year old me would have declared this scenario his ultimate nightmare. However, the Draco that managed to think for himself when the war began would be kind of pleased with the outcome"
"But that has no class. A lot of the flavour is lost when you do it like that, actually."
“So I take it you haven’t corrected her, then?”, Draco turned to fully face him, his left leg almost touching Harry’s. He was standing so close Harry could feel his breath. “No, I haven’t”, Harry breathed out. “Good”, Draco replied and leaned in to kiss him. With one hand steady around his drink and the other tugging at Draco’s collar, Harry deepened the kiss feverently. For now, in this second, he didn’t care that he still wasn’t sure about Draco’s motives. He would ask him later. Right now, he had more important things to do. Like run his hand through Draco’s soft hair, or let Draco slip his tongue inside his mouth. Much more important.
Few people actually visited the shop at said hours, and if someone showed up it was mostly middle-aged lonesome men renting bad action or horror movies. Now that Harry and Ginny’s breakup was almost two years ago and the few dates he had gone on were something he’d rather forget about, Harry often felt sympathy for these men and occasionally the fear of ending up like them crept in, intruding on his comfort at work.
"Harry, it's me! How are things at home? You didn't call, so I figured you were either kidnapped and strangled or sharing a blanket with Draco Malfoy, counting stars", his best friend's voice echoed through the line.
Harry looked at him, and in the second moment of bravery of the evening, he leaned in closer. And just as he was about to close his eyes Ron shouted: “Harry, Draco! Seamus just proposed!”. And just like that, the moment was over.
. But even the people living in a dystopia had a more satisfying love life than he had. And while he watched the movie he couldn’t help but wonder what Draco would think about the movie.
“Thank you! What’s your name?”
?”, Harry suggested now. Fuck, why couldn’t he focus with Draco in his proximity? This was getting embarrassing.
"Even though what, Malfoy?"
While Ron tried to make sense of Harry’s behaviour tonight, now also remembering his initiative reluctance, Neville scooched closer to the Slytherin in question, looking so uncomfortable that it hurt to watch. “Relax, Longbottom”, Draco supplied, noticing Neville’s change of breath.
Harry wasn’t supposed to do this. Draco was the one who should apologize, or at least explain himself. Still, Harry found himself, all dressed up, sitting at his kitchen table, anxiously waiting for his owl (Herrman) to return. Ten minutes earlier he had found himself writing a message to Draco:
Feeling bold, Harry met his eyes. Musterring up every bit of confidence he had left in his cells, he stared back. The blonde’s eyes were becoming darker with every second passing, making Harry want to squirm.
to study") and therefore, had been out for tonight. Judging by the sounds coming from the kitchen, he had returned and brought company to their 4-room flatshare in the heart of London. A lucky find, as Hermione kept on reminding Harry.
"I merely let my facade drop".
“You did start calling me Harry years ago-”
He had seen that smile on Theodore’s face many times, but it was something only seen on rare occasions on the Blonde’s lips. That, and the many Firewhiskeys Harry had intus, made him say: “Sure, that would be great” when he knew deep down that he would have found some stupid excuse if it had been only Theodore and Pansy asking.
“I would like that. My shift starts at 9”, he replied. After a small pause he added: “I didn’t know you were one to be scattered”
?”,Harry pronounced carefully.
“Can I tell you something? I haven’t told anyone else”, Harry asked, not knowing whether the alcohol made him say it or his new found solace when in Draco’s presence.
“Well, then.”, Draco said and downed a shot, while Theodore, Luna, Ginny and Pansy drank, too.
"Join us, Potter. I think Francis here has a proposal to make", Malfoy stated, looking far too amused for Harry's good.
-------
“Don’t worry, it’s not poisoned”
It was a Friday afternoon and Asteria had just left her room, bedhead and circles around her eyes so dark it worried Harry. "You and Draco get along well", Asteria said. "It's a surprise for me, too". "That's really nice. You know what they say: there's a fine line between love and hate. Of course, I am not insinuating that you're in love but.." Asteria never finished the sentence, still the weight of it felt heavy. "You're a real sentimentalist, you know that?", Harry smiled and scooted closer to her on the sofa they were sitting on, intertwining their feet. They giggled at the touch. Harry adored her, simply because with her he could pretend things were easy. Asteria then launched into a detailed explanation about her dream and what it could possibly mean, losing Harry when the words primary-process-thought and Freudian's reliance on symbolism fell.
“Are you,now? Aren’t I lucky”
If someone had told Harry a sole
Luckily, the house had several bathrooms since the first two had been occupied. Upstairs, they had found an empty one. The blinds of a huge window with an adjoined windowsill were closed and there was a bathtub in the middle of the room, a wooden tablet situated in the middle with several candles adorning it. Harry sat down on the windowsill, watching how Draco slowly started to unbutton his shirt. He looked away once he realized how tightly the Blonde’s undershirt was on his body, making every muscle, every bone visible. “Don’t pretend to be so decent, Potter”, Draco said, not looking up. Harry, though bright red, fixated his eyes on him anew, strangely embarrassed but turned on. With one swift motion, the shirt was on the floor, but Draco didn’t even bother picking it up to clean it. Harry’s eyes were still on him as he made his way to the windowsill, his hips swaying so elegantly it was almost unfair. But Harry forced his eyes to stay fixated, looked into Draco’s eyes when he took Harry’s face in his hands and let his thumb brush across his jaw again, just like he did the other night. His lips were so full, so beautifully parted but Harry said: “I want to talk first”
“I’m gonna go outside for a smoke”, Draco announced ten minutes later, grabbing his leather jacket after he’d pushed his chair back to the table. This was Harry’s chance to explain himself. He’d passed the last hour embarrassed in his little corner at the table, listening to Seamus, Ron and Dean. Why was Pansy trying to humiliate him in front of everyone? Surely she must know that his and Draco’s history wasn’t exactly civil? So he excused himself a minute later and followed Draco outside.
Draco nodded.
For the first time, not even the Videothek enabled Harry to calm down completely. Even though Ron had been thrilled when Harry offered him to take the new position, Harry still felt at a loss. Emotionally, but now also career-wise. But Draco had promised to stop by. So that was something. Harry was sorting some videotapes in a hidden corner of the shop and the doorbell rang. Immediately, he could feel his heart racing and he quickly returned to the official part of the store, but it was only one of the men who dropped by occasionally. “Evening”, Harry said, “what can I help you with?” He was dreading an encounter with this man, since he now remembered that he’d talked about his dead cat for nearly twenty minutes the last time he had visited. Not that a dead pet wasn’t tragic. But
Harry watched how Malfoy’s bemused smile grew even further as Neville worked on his neck. He could only imagine what it must feel like to indulge into its taste- a mixture of bitter and honeyed, Harry presumed. How Neville now had access to Malfoy’s throat in it’s full vulnerability, feeling how the blonde’s adams apple bobbed up and down. How Neville now was able to smell Malfoy, really smell him. Him, and his ridiculously masculine perfume, somehow evolving into a mesmerizing, tantalizing odor Harry simply could not get enough of, not that he’d ever admit that to himself though.
