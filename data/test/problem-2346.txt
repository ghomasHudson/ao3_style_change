Hermione smiled brightly at him. “I will. What, er, what were you two doing when I came in? You looked very happy about something.”
Draco laughed and slid one arm across Harry’s stomach. “I think I can do that. It would only be fair.”
Draco shrugged. “I was a very bored fourteen-year-old, I suppose. Or a very jealous one, maybe. Of course, my jealousy was short-lived after seeing that first task.”
“When we were on the run, some of the Ministry Death Eaters caught up with us and when we tried to Apparate away, one of them had hold of Hermione,” Harry replied, shrugging. “So we landed but had to take off again straight away before he knew where he was. And there was a point we thought it might have passed to Bellatrix, but it hadn’t.”
Harry turned in Draco’s arms, lifting his own and wrapping them around Draco’s neck. “We were. But then you got me all riled up and I thought we’d better come straight home.”
They stopped talking as they reached Bookworms and Brews, quickly climbing the steps that led to the entrance. Once inside, they made their way past the café counter and into the high stacks. The lighting and smell were exactly the same as Harry remembered and he breathed in deeply, smiling to himself. They continued walking until they came to the first free alcove, which happened to be the one they’d sat in on their first ‘date’.
Harry laughed. “I don’t know. If they were to suddenly jump off the shelf, I’m sure you’d catch them before they suffered.”
“I say we just go with basic ribbon. Let the flowers do the talking,” Harry said, making his way back to the counter. “Plain red or green, maybe? Green might be better, since we’re using red and white flowers. And red paper?”
Harry nodded, turning the book over to read the back cover. “It looks it. Are we going to discuss it afterwards? Or whilst reading?”
Sighing, he headed back along the street to Paperwhite’s. They had an afternoon of wedding flowers to prepare and he was sure that he would need all of his concentration.
As he walked, Harry realised that their situation was probably a bit different to most people as he was sure that other people wouldn’t be spending so much time at their partner’s house after only two months together. But he and Draco had known each other for so long now that it felt natural. He smiled to himself as he reached The Leaky Cauldron. They’d never done anything the ‘traditional’ way.
“I think together,” Harry replied. “That way there’s not the pressure of knowing you’re being watched.”
“As a matter of fact, I have,” Draco replied, mentally breathing a sigh of relief. It always made him a little bit uncomfortable when Pansy started talking about her sex life. “She came to see Harry in the shop the other day. How long do you think it’s been going on for?”
“Oh, you think I do this for your benefit? No, no, I do this for me,” Draco replied with a shake of his head. “If you come in in a foul mood, I’d have to do all the talking to the customers because all you can do is grunt until you’ve worked your way out of your funk.”
Harry laughed. “You can count on it. See you later,” he said, walking backwards down the street for a few paces before giving Draco a wave and turning around.
Harry turned and caught the notepad that Draco threw at him, blinking in surprise. “What do you mean I need it more than you?”
“I just thought, after this it would be… awkward working together,” Harry faltered. “I don’t want to leave. I love my job. But I’d understand if
“Ah, it worked,” Draco said, appearing behind Harry again with a box in his hands. “It didn’t stay standing like that for that long before.”
Harry laughed and shoved lightly at Draco’s shoulder. “You win that round and can have another go, if you want?”
“Do you think one date will be enough for them to stop?” Draco said, tilting his head slightly as he looked at Harry.
“Shh. Alright, so I suppose I could say my type is… athletic? Rather than Quidditch specific,” Harry said slowly, looking at the list again.
“Just now. Mum filled us in,” Charlie replied, stepping into the room now, followed by Arlo. “We thought we’d come and see if you needed rescuing, but apparently not!”
Draco smirked to himself as he took out a duster and gave the till a wipe. The cleanliness of the shop was one of the things they prided themselves on, and they were constantly on the lookout for dropped leaves or soil. They had won business awards in the past, afterall. Once he’d finished with the till, Draco moved onto polishing the plaques that adorned the wall behind the counter.
“I hope not,” Harry said, making a face. “Although I suppose they might, considering I said Angelina’s cousin was too young.”
“Certainly not. Are you done with the bouquet now?” Draco asked, sitting back down on his stool. “They’ll be here any minute.”
Charlie smiled. “Don’t worry about it. Arlo and I were just finishing dinner, and now that we’re done, I’m going to go and find him for dessert.”
Harry stood up and followed Draco back into the kitchen where there was now a small dining table sitting to one side. It was set for two. “This wasn’t here before.”
Harry settled himself back onto the sofa with a soft groan. “You certainly know how to spoil a man.”
Harry grinned and pulled Draco in for a kiss before allowing him to lead the way to a small waterfront restaurant where they enjoyed pasta and wine.
“He lied to me. His friends haven’t been setting him up at all,” Draco said. “They haven’t set him up for months.”
“It ruined my afternoon too, but probably not in the same way,” Ron replied with a sigh. “I got soaked on the delivery run.”
They set about their nightly cleaning routine, working as quickly as possible in order to get everything done and within half an hour, they were putting their cloaks on and getting ready to leave the shop.
Harry glanced at Ron. “What do you make of that turn up for the books, then?” he asked, nodding at Blaise and Ginny.
Draco’s eyes widened briefly and he nodded. “Alright. I think I can manage to put enough on my plate.”
“What about cellophane? Did you check that?” Draco asked, turning to watch Harry as he moved through the room.
“I know where we’re going on our date,” Draco said as he made his way behind the counter. “Meet me here at six on Saturday. Well, outside.”
“Same here,” Harry said. “I didn’t get much as a child, until I got to Hogwarts anyway, so I’m sort of used to not getting a lot at Christmas.”
“Well, thankfully that wasn’t an issue,” Draco replied. “I didn’t have that many presents to go under it. Just a few from my parents and friends, really.”
“Me neither, but it makes sense when Valentine’s Day falls on a Sunday. No-one wants their flowers a day early,” Harry replied, shaking his head. “Even though they’re always perfectly fine.”
Settling himself on the sofa, he dug his fork into the noodles, twirling it around until he had enough on there to be counted as a mouthful. As he lifted the fork to his mouth, he groped for the remote control that he knew was somewhere nearby. Although he didn’t use it often, he’d managed – with Hermione’s help – to get a TV to work within the magic-infused walls of Grimmauld Place. Sometimes, on nights like this, he could think of nothing better than losing himself in some mindless TV shows. Switching the TV on, he scrolled through the channels until he landed on an episode of a garden remodelling show which was just starting. Smiling to himself, he put the remote down and began to eat in earnest, keeping one eye on the TV.
“No, I don’t hate them. I probably never did,” Draco said, shaking his head. “But Blaise probably doesn’t realise that. It’s not like I’m best friends with Weasley now.”
“So, let me get this straight, we stress about telling you lot about us and none of you are even bothered?” Harry asked, looking around the room.
“He didn’t really let me explain. I told him why I did it, but unfortunately he didn’t think it was a good reason,” Harry replied, shaking his head. “And he’s absolutely right. It was a terrible reason. I’m thirty years old, I should be able to talk to him about this, shouldn’t I?”
Harry looked around as they made their way along the central aisle. Away from the noise of the café, the sounds of soft jazz music could be heard. Either side of the aisle were high bookshelves of dark wood and everywhere Harry looked, there were plush sofas and armchairs covered in soft-looking green leather and low tables. Occasionally he caught sight of a wood burner at the end of an aisle, fire crackling away comfortingly. “Wow,” he breathed.
“Man,” Harry said, the blush on his face returning anew. “I know that much. Name is Conor, or something.”
“Yeah, I know what you mean,” Harry said as he opened the notepad. “Some things are just a surprise hit, I suppose.”
They’d been reading for an hour or so when Harry put his book down and looked across at Draco. “Do you fancy another coffee?”
Ron turned his head to look at Harry. “Nah. No point when I’m going to hand it to her. I’m going to take one of these too,” he said, picking up one of the potted jasmine plants. “It smells really nice.”
Before Draco could say anything else, Alice walked back into the room with her arms full of soft black fur.
Harry blinked as he looked at Molly. The silence that had fallen over the table registered in his mind. He licked his lips slowly, trying to put his thoughts into words before he spoke. “Molly, I appreciate your concern, I really do, but I am perfectly happy with the way my life is going at the minute.”
“I was thinking the same,” Harry nodded. “By the way, do we need to refresh that hanging display? It doesn’t seem to have held up as well as normal.”
“I’ll tell them we ate and drank, and that we might see each other again,” Harry said, shrugging. “I may or may not make up a name.”
Groaning softly, he went to the fridge and grabbed a packet of cooked ham and the butter. Then he made his way to the counter by the sink to get some bread so he could make himself a sandwich. For all he’d had twenty chicken nuggets and extra large fries, as he’d predicted, he was hungry again. Not wanting to eat a great load more, a sandwich was the perfect compromise.
“Witch. Where’s Theo? Chained to the kitchen?” Draco asked, shrugging his cloak off and hanging it on the coat stand.
“Of course you haven’t. If you had, he’d be yours,” Pansy replied with a grin. “Especially if you followed it up with that delicious treacle tart I know you can make. Did you know that’s his favourite?”
Pansy rolled her eyes and stood up. “I’ll go and find out. Would you like something to drink in the meantime?”
Hermione laughed again. “Alright, I won’t mention it next time I see him. Did business pick up any?”
“Why not? It’s been ten years since you were last there,” Draco said with a small frown. “And you wouldn’t have to stay in the castle, surely?”
Draco shook his head. “Not right now, no. I’m not even thirty years old yet, Mother. Why would I want to settle down?”
“Like I said, I can’t blame you for that. But if you’ve really fallen for him, don’t you think he deserves to know?” Charlie asked, his expression becoming serious again. “How can you work with him, knowing how you feel?”
“I know you mean well, Pans. I really do. But trust me. It can go no further than a little crush,” Draco said with a sigh. “It’s for the best.”
By the time Saturday came around, Harry was exhausted. “I swear, I think I might sleep all day tomorrow.”
“Oh, really? And why couldn’t that discussion have waited?” Lucius asked, throwing an enquiring look at Harry, who opened his mouth to reply.
“Exactly. Honestly, I don’t know where Hermione finds these people,” Harry sighed, downing the rest of his coffee. “That’s hit the spot. Do you want the baby or the birthday today?”
“Exactly. Hopefully this is just a precaution anyway,” Draco replied, stowing his wand away in its holster. “It might not be as bad as they think, I think it’s just because they’re not sure of the origin.”
“Well, which one was it?” Draco asked, his eyes wide. “You can’t just drop a bombshell like that on me and expect me to leave it alone.”
“No, you’re not,” Charlie replied, shaking his head. “You’ve done what anyone would have done in your situation. Merlin knows I thought of doing something similar when I was younger. Mum was obsessed with me settling down with someone. But I also had six brothers to distract her from me.”
“Well, you know, there has to be a reason for him to have kept the pretence up…” Pansy said, giving him a knowing look.
“No, I didn’t want to interrupt her Sunday,” Harry replied regretfully as he unlocked the delivery door. “It’s the only day she gets a proper lie-in. Ron gets the kids up and dressed and takes them out for a walk.”
“Yeah, I think so. It just needs the bow attached properly,” Harry replied, turning the vase around so that he could check the bouquet from all angles.
Harry made a face. “Nasty. Give her my regards next time you hear from her then. Hopefully she’ll recover quickly.”
quiet,” Draco replied, looking mildly horrified at the notion of speaking loudly now they were in amongst the books. “Just in case.”
“Alright, well let’s decide on Saturday, then,” Harry said, taking a sip from his cup. “We’d better finish this before the delivery comes.”
“Takeaway,” Draco replied immediately. “We can go back to yours, because we’ll pass that amazing Chinese place.”
Harry threw a piece of florist’s sponge at him. “Alright, alright. Well done, Mister Smartarse. Anyway, how come you don’t have plans tonight?”
Harry laughed and stood up. “I hope the chapters are quite short. Not because I want to spend less time with you, but because I want to know what happens in the end!”
“I think they should be in one of these boxes,” Draco said, frowning slightly as he looked at the pile of boxes. “I think it’s lots of green for the lead up to St Patrick’s Day.”
“I know. I feel better actually saying it out loud, you know. I think I was just trying to convince myself that I was imagining it,” Harry replied.
“We probably should be,” Draco replied with a shrug. “But honestly, these last couple of weeks have been so manic, I don’t feel like moving.”
This seemed to signal the end of conversation for now and everyone focused on emptying their plates. Harry mulled over what had been said as he ate, wondering if they all really believed what he’d said. Fortunately he was saved from his thoughts by a shriek.
“I know, I’m sorry. It’s always a little bit mad for the first few months of a new year, what with Valentine’s Day and then Easter,” Draco replied. “We should quieten off a bit now.”
“This is actually perfect,” Harry said with a smile. “I can only imagine how much effort you put into making the badges in the first place.”
“That is very true, but I still appreciate the thought,” Draco replied with another smile. “Isn’t it funny that we both chose something that has significance to us both?”
“Harry! It’s about time you brought your… oh. Hello, Draco,” Molly said, stopping short as she realised who was standing at the door. “I thought you were bringing Adam, Harry?”
“No, neither did I really. I mean, it started off really well, so I suppose we should have known,” Harry said with a shrug. “But I’m quite glad I was sceptical because this is gripping.”
Harry laughed and patted Draco’s stomach gently. “Come on then. We’ll take the Floo to your place and then Apparate to The Burrow from there.”
Harry fought the urge to roll his eyes. Despite him dating Draco for five years now, Lucius Malfoy had still not warmed to him. He stood awkwardly beside the table for a moment while Draco seated himself next to his father and then took the free seat beside Narcissa.
Thankfully, Saturday was so busy in the shop that he had no trouble falling asleep that night, which was just as well. Late on Saturday afternoon, Hermione had popped into the shop to ask him how he felt about going out on a double date with her and Ron the next day with a colleague of hers. Draco had snorted, which quickly turned into a cough as he disappeared into the back room.
“I know what you mean,” Draco chuckled. “Working with the dried stems is definitely tougher than working with fresh.”
“Keep your hands off! They’re not for you!” Harry laughed, holding the flowers out of his reach. “They’re for the ladies among us.”
“Already on it,” Draco replied, moving past Harry and into the back room where he lifted the bucket into the sink and began to fill it up with hot water.
“Ah, good choice,” Draco nodded, leaning over to pick the menu card up. “I’ve had that before. It’s good. I think I’ll just have the same, I don’t fancy any of the others today. Not to mention the tuna crunch is a no-no on a date.”
“Because I’m the one arranging it,” Draco said, giving Harry a look that said it was obvious. “There won’t be any uncomfortable small talk, or trips to juice bars. We’ll have a nice night.”
“Hi, Mrs Malfoy,” Harry replied, quirking his lips in a quick smile before nodding at Lucius. “Mr Malfoy.”
Draco nodded again. “Yeah, I suppose it’s to cater to the lunch crowd, but they should still do them on an evening too. Eating there sounds good to me, if you really want to.”
“No, how could we? We just got here,” Charlie replied, shaking his head. “Like I said, Mum filled us in. She also said lunch is nearly ready, so if Zabini isn’t here soon, he’ll be going hungry.”
There was a sudden rise in volume as everyone reached for the tureens full of carrots, peas and cauliflower. Harry stood up and reached for the tureen of mashed swede first, dolloping a spoonful onto his plate. Then he offered the tureen to Charlie.
Shrugging his cloak off and hanging it in the cupboard, he walked back through the house, lighting the lamps with a flick of his wand. He grabbed a plate from the cupboard and set about dishing up his chow mein. Then he went to the fridge and poured himself a glass of water from the jug. He looked at the table, considering whether he wanted to eat in the kitchen, or take his plate into the lounge to eat on the sofa. A split second later, his decision was made and he was walking through the hall and into the lounge.
“What are we putting in the hanging display now?” Harry asked ten minutes later, glancing across at Draco as they were about to make a start on sorting through the delivery.
“I can’t. They’re already worried about me,” Harry replied. “If I tell them I don’t want them to arrange more dates, they’ll worry even more. Well, maybe Ron and Hermione won’t, but I know Molly will. They were talking about me at dinner the other night, because Charlie has a boyfriend now.”
“I’m seeing someone,” Ginny said, taking one hand out of her pocket and pulling her ponytail free of her coat. “I have been for a little while, but I only just told Mum and Dad. Thought I’d come and see you, too.”
Draco groaned and pushed himself away from the counter. “You’re right. Sitting like this is no good. Alright, let’s draw.”
“Right. Let me just check which one I did last,” Harry said, turning back to the bucket he’d just put down. “I forgot to cross it off with George interrupting me.”
“But wouldn’t you rather go and… meet other people instead of keeping me company because I’m too afraid to put my foot down with people who try to set me up?” Harry asked, biting his lip slightly.
“Understandable,” Charlie nodded. “But if he said he’d been looking forward to going out with you, then that’s a good thing. There’s hope there, Harry. It might not be easy but I think you’ve still got a chance at fixing this.”
Shaking himself out of his thoughts, he gave the padlock one last tug to check it was fully locked and then turned on his heel, walking down the street to the Apparition point. As he walked, he passed many couples walking hand in hand in the opposite direction and he couldn’t help but smile. Many of them were clutching one of the extravagant bouquets that they’d purchased from Paperwhite’s. Valentine’s Day had never been a big deal for him, but knowing that he’d had something to do with their happiness filled him with a sense of pride – a far cry from his school days, for sure. At twenty-nine years old, he could now appreciate the good feeling that came with doing something for someone else. Finally, he reached the Apparition point and disappeared, transporting himself home.
“You can’t help who you fall for, Draco. I have to say, it seemed inevitable,” Pansy said with a smile. “Is it so bad?”
Folding the parchment again, he sealed it with a quick charm and stepped up to the counter where he was greeted by a tired-looking witch.
“No, let's not. Childhood was slightly depressing when I think of it now,” Draco replied, making a face. “So, dinner tomorrow?”
“I don’t mind sitting a bit closer,” Harry said, shrugging and making the cups rattle on the tray. “Do you?”
“I’m just wondering if you’re ever going to stop talking and kiss me,” Draco replied, his eyes widening slightly as the words left his mouth.
Before he could dwell on the thought, the fireplace roared and Hermione stepped into the kitchen. “Granger!”
“Me too,” Ron replied, nodding. “Me too. It’s got to just be a matter of time now. We’re getting closer.”
“Right, I’ll see you back here in an hour,” Draco said, turning to Harry as they locked the security gate. “You don’t need to worry about dressing extra smart or anything. Dress for comfort, and probably best to grab something to eat before you leave.”
“Oh… maybe?” Harry said with a frown as he fussed with the flowers and foliage within the bouquet. “I hadn’t noticed, to be honest. I’ve not been over to The Burrow for a few weeks, what with being so busy here.”
Draco gazed around once more, scrutinising everything in the shop as he did so. “Peace Lily!” He said triumphantly, turning back to Harry, his eyes shining.
“Interesting. Anyway, tomorrow evening, will you be able to get away to my place for five o’clock?” Draco asked, glancing across at Harry.
Harry looked around again for a few seconds before he lowered himself onto the sofa, gasping softly as he realised Draco was right. This was the most comfortable sofa he’d ever sat on.
“Oh, don’t I know it. You’ve never been one to give up,” Draco muttered, shaking his head. “Have another go then.”
,” Pansy insisted. “Draco, I know you. I can tell. Did you not think this might happen when you agreed to help him out?”
Harry looked around, taking in the room’s appearance. The decor took him by surprise as he’d imagined that it would be similar to Bookworms and Brews, with dark wood and leather everywhere. But the room he was looking at had no dark wood or leather at all, instead, the walls were painted a pale grey colour, and the furniture was natural wood with an incredibly comfy-looking sofa and armchairs arranged around the edge of the room. The window let in plenty of light and there were plants everywhere. “It’s all so light,” he said, unable to help himself.
“Alright, no problem,” Harry said, nodding. He was mopping the floor in front of the counter now, ushering Draco backwards so that he was behind the counter. “Could you really not go home to the Manor every week?”
Harry laughed too and shoved at Draco lightly. “Come on then, lead the way to the delicious buffet.”
“I know. And we’ve never once tried to kill each other,” Harry said with a laugh. “Seriously though, if he makes you happy then I’m glad you found each other.”
“Well, I didn’t want to go overboard, did I?” Draco asked, looking less anxious. “You might get a big head.”
“Oh, of course, that’s fine,” Hermione said, her voice betraying her surprise. “Sorry, I just assumed.”
“I could,” Draco conceded with a nod. “I might go this weekend. Don’t tell Mother though, just in case I change my mind.”
“I know you do, because you always tell me,” Draco replied, giving Harry a sly look. “Not that I think you’re repetitive.”
“Oh, we will. We’ve got a lot of orders to make up tomorrow,” Harry said, playing absentmindedly with his fork. “So even if we don’t get many customers, we won’t have to resort to ‘I Spy’ again.”
Hary sighed and pulled a chair as close to the bed as he dared. “I’m staying here for the afternoon. Can you let Robards know?”
At six o’clock that night, Harry was waiting outside Paperwhite’s when Draco got there. “You’re early.”
Theo groaned as he settled himself onto the sofa. “This had better be good, Malfoy. We were in the middle of something.”
“In all honesty, no. But I can hope,” Harry replied. “I’m going over to The Burrow again on Sunday for lunch so I’ll probably get quizzed then. Last Sunday was for the kids, so I escaped being the centre of attention.”
“Thanks,” Harry laughed, meeting Draco in the middle of the shop and taking his coffee. “If it makes you feel better, I haven’t watered anything yet.”
Harry laughed, but before they could continue the conversation, Molly brought the roast beef to the table. “Oh, wow, it looks great, Molly.”
Draco shook his head. “Next time, either wait for me or use magic,” he said. “I don’t want to come back to the shop after lunch one day to find you knocked out on the floor and the till empty.”
“Thank you. So, tonight, shall we meet at six again?” Draco asked. “I won’t be going to have dinner with Mother today, so I don’t mind if you want to meet at a different time.”
A few moments passed and then the door was flung open. “Draco!” Pansy exclaimed, swooping forward and kissing him on the cheek. “Come in, come in, it’s getting cold.”
Harry pushed himself away from the counter and opened the drawer to pull out a notepad. “Do you think we’ll have to change much this year?”
“I hope so. I think we’ve made a move in the right direction,” Draco said, standing up. “And speaking of making a move, we’d better actually move.”
Charlie,” Harry said, shaking his head. “No. We just messed around a few times throughout the summer. But then he had to go back to Romania, and that was that. Neither of us were after anything serious at the time, but what we had helped a lot.”
“Righto. I’ll make a start on tidying the back room up then,” Harry said. “I might as well while we wait for them to pick the bouquet up.”
Harry shook his head at once. “No way. I wouldn’t enjoy that at all. Maybe it’s a sign I’m getting old, but I like being able to hear you when I’m talking to you.”
“Ah yeah, good point,” Harry said with a nod of his own. “You wouldn’t want to drop anything on the book.”
“I’ll call and get some on my way home,” Harry said. “I’ll bring them with me tomorrow and we can compare them while we’re going through the receipts.”
Draco smiled. “Same here. I think this has been the best Valentine’s Day I’ve ever had, and I’m not just saying that because I’m lying here with you. It genuinely has been.”
“Trust me, if I could have swapped places with anyone at the time, I would have,” Harry said. “I wanted no part of it. Anyway, enough of that for now. Do you like your present?”
“I want to talk to you about this ‘date’,” Narcissa replied, sitting down at the table. She patted the surface opposite her.
“Honestly Mum, I don’t think you should interfere too much,” Charlie continued. “He’s twenty-nine. He knows his own mind.”
Harry tilted his head slightly before shrugging. “I hadn’t really thought about it,” he said apologetically. “I honestly didn’t think that they’d go on about my love life for so long. I thought they’d lose interest after a few weeks, but they seemed to get even more determined. And now we’ve started this, unless I talk about ‘Adam’ every time I see one of them, they’re apparently going to think that it’s fizzled out and I need setting up again.”
“Oh. Good thinking,” Harry said, smiling. “So, what will the prize be? A free bouquet or gift vouchers?”
“I’m not stupid, Pansy,” Draco tutted. “I only live ten minutes away. I knew what the weather was like before I left home.”
However, now that it was five o’clock, things were slowing down and Draco took advantage of a few minutes without customers to flip the sign on the door to ‘closed’. Turning to Harry, he breathed a sigh of relief. “I think that’s us done. Let’s get everything cleaned down, and we need to get that hanging display cleared out, too.”
“I can see why you like it so much,” Harry smiled as Draco led them down one of the aisles towards the rear of the shop. “So what is your plan for tonight?”
“Don’t I know it.” Draco grinned. “Alright, enough talking about the table. Come and get some food.”
Draco laughed. “Did the book help put things into perspective, though? It’s pretty evident that marriage isn’t the be all and end all of life.”
“Yes. Something I’m sure he’ll be grateful for at six-thirty tomorrow morning,” Draco said with a grin. “Although a quick hex would certainly wake him up.”
“Ah, here, give him back to me and I’ll get him sorted,” Ron said, holding his hands out to take Hugo from Harry.
Draco shook his head. “No, of course not. Come in, come in,” he said, stepping back to let Harry in.
Draco smiled and headed out of the kitchen and up to his old room. He’d sent his clothes over that morning with a note saying to expect him after work. Although Narcissa often popped into Paperwhite’s to check on how things are going, and to take the day’s takings to Gringotts, they never really got the chance to have a chat.
Draco gave her a smile. “Thank you. Again. You and Weasley will have to come for dinner one night so we can thank you properly.”
Draco shrugged. “I’m happy for him. If he’s found someone that he’s ready to settle down for, then it can only be a good thing, can’t it?”
Draco smiled. “No, you and me both. But I see where you’re coming from. This will always remind me of you. Not to mention anything else I might forget.”
“Helping Harry out,” Pansy repeated slowly, before shaking her head, her sleek brown hair swishing around her face. “No, that doesn’t add up. Tell me the truth.”
They lapsed into silence as the show began in earnest, happy to be in each other’s company as they listened to the host’s chatter.
“Okay, sure,” Harry nodded, putting the cup holder and paper bag down on the counter so that he could take off his cloak. “Coffee’s got your name on it,” he added as he went to the cupboard.
“I am somehow not surprised at that,” Draco replied with a smile. “It is the kind of thing that he seems to excel at.”
“Really? He’s going out with a Weasley… can you really not think of a reason he might keep that secret?” Draco asked, raising an eyebrow.
“I know, I know she does,” Molly replied, sighing again. “I still worry about them all, that’s all. Thank you, Harry.”
“No, I haven’t,” Harry said, shaking his head. “Mostly because I’ve been so busy at work, I haven’t had time for much else. This lunch is a welcome break.”
“I had to get out of there. I’ve worked with him for years and I thought we had a good friendship,” Draco said, shaking his head. “I thought we could talk to each other.”
Saturday arrived quicker than either Harry or Draco had imagined it would, and no sooner had they walked into the shop that morning, it seemed that closing time was upon them.
“Absolutely, but I don’t suppose there are many flowers that could give you a third degree burn while you’re tending to it,” Charlie replied.
“Yeah, let’s give it a go. I’m sure we have a sandwich board sign here somewhere,” Draco said, walking into the backroom to rummage through the cupboard. “Aha. Here it is.”
Draco nodded. “Unfortunately, yes. Don’t get me wrong, I did get toys and things as gifts, but we did not play games. Sometimes Mother and I would, but Father didn’t often join in. I’m sure that comes as a surprise to you.”
“I think you’d be surprised. They don’t really hold grudges,” Harry replied. “Well, Ron does but you’ve already got past that with him. The rest are easy.”
Draco shook his head. “Don’t be. I might not be able to have the same conversations with him, but at least that means he’s not belittling me for coming second to Granger, or you in Quidditch.”
Draco nodded as he took the cloak, pulling it around himself as he headed down the aisle without a backwards glance.
“Ah. Same as me,” Harry said with a smile. “Until some meddling friends of mine decided to take things into their own hands.”
Harry nodded again. “Yeah, no problem. I’ll run down to the post office and send an urgent owl. Do we just want the same as what we’ve got?”
“Oh, one of the junior writers, I think,” Pansy said, waving a hand. “I can’t remember his name. Very keen though.”
“I hope so,” Draco replied, craning his neck to try and see between the stacks. “It doesn’t look too busy so with a bit of luck it will be.”
Draco set the tray down on the table before doing the same as Harry and taking his cloak off. “Why do you like this alcove so much?”
“Well. I don’t think we can expect any more customers this afternoon,” Draco sighed as he slumped over the counter beside Harry. “That rain is really coming down.”
“Yeah, he, er, he went to school overseas,” Harry said, thinking quickly. He couldn’t believe that he and Draco hadn’t made this bit of history up. “Something to do with his dad’s job, I think he said.”
“I’m not really sure,” Harry replied, turning to look at him. “But something a lot darker than this. A bit like the Manor, I suppose.”
“We have indeed. It’s a miracle we all managed to turn our lives around,” Draco replied. “Anyway. Let’s not talk about all that. It’ll only depress us.”
“Mm, I suppose so,” Harry said thoughtfully. “Oh well, that’s even better. We won’t have to be as quiet.”
“No idea. The dried bouquets seem to be taking off now,” Draco said as he made his way along the hall. “So we’re finding ourselves making more of those. I can fully understand why, though. They do bring a certain something to the look of a room.”
“It’s a bit different coming into a room full of people you didn’t get on with at school though, isn’t it?” Harry replied, picking up one of the tureens and taking off the lid to reveal a pile of steaming carrots. “Carrots?”
“Then I look forward to seeing what the two of you can come up with,” Pansy said with a grin. “Will you be doing Christmas displays?”
“Fair enough,” Harry replied, picking up his napkin and tucking it into the collar of his shirt as Draco did the same. Then, grinning, he began to eat. “Mm, this is good!”
Pansy snorted. “Given how you two behaved at school, I would take it as one too. So will you do that again?”
“Any minute now, I would think,” Draco replied, checking the clock. “Hopefully there’ll be some fresh roses in it too. I know I’ll need some white ones, but what do you think about putting some pale pink ones in too?”
“And you didn’t stay with her? What’s wrong with you?” Harry asked with a frown. “Why would you come to a party on your own?”
“At least we’re on the same page, then,” Draco said, returning the smile. “Okay, how do you want to do this? Do you want to open first? Or should I go first? Together?”
“No need to thank me,” Draco said, shaking his head. “It was long overdue, I think. I just didn’t know how to bring it up with you after so long.”
Molly took her place at the table, levitating the roast potatoes ahead of her. “Arthur, can you carve, please?”
Draco shook his head. “No, not yet. I was just thinking of brightly coloured ones. Maybe sunflowers if we can get some.”
“Exactly. I have never been anything but honest with you when it comes to your work,” Draco said. “But I think it helped that the shop was established before you came to work here. That way it’s never been a big deal other than the fact you’re working with people who had links to the Death Eaters.”
“Then let’s see what we can come up with,” Draco said. “We need to be the best if we’re going to do it.”
“Are you alright, dear?” Molly asked, her face full of concern as she watched Harry mop up the spilled water in front of him.
“Quarter to five,” Draco replied, glancing at his watch. “They did say they’d be cutting it fine to pick the bouquet up so don’t worry that they’re not here yet.”
the worst in each other and when we’re on the same side, we’re an unstoppable force. Why wouldn’t I like that?”
started it!” Harry exclaimed, his voice rising enough to cause a few of the other patrons to turn towards them.
At quarter past six, Harry arrived at The Burrow. As he stepped out of the fireplace, he found himself thinking about how lucky he was that they didn’t mind him just showing up in their house unannounced. Although, he supposed, he wasn’t really
Hermione looked up and shook her head. “It’s not that we’re not bothered, Harry. More like we’re not surprised. You two have become so close while working together, it’s been quite obvious that you care for each other.”
Harry twisted his mouth as he thought. “Can we just say blond? That way it’ll be easier for me to remember.”
“Yes. I thought one of us could do them while the other moves the displays,” Draco replied, averting his gaze slightly. “I’ll start on the orders. We can swap at lunchtime.”
As the Portkey glowed ever brighter, they were suddenly whisked away from their kitchen and Harry closed his eyes. He found it helped with the nausea as they spun. A few moments later, he felt their momentum slowing and he opened his eyes again, thankful that he had managed to learn how to land softly now.
“Maybe next time she should set you up with a woman,” Draco suggested as the delivery van pulled into the bay. “It might be easier.”
Harry shrugged, pulling his cloak off again and taking it into the back room. “I don’t know. I’m alright, I mean, it’s not really been a priority.”
“Well, seeing as all of our ‘dates’ so far have taken place here, why not continue what we started? Finish the book?” Harry suggested.
Ginny turned back to study the arrangements again before marking a cross on the voting card and signing her name. Then she put the quill down and deposited the card into the box. “When are you drawing the winner?”
Charlie laughed loudly. “That sounds about right. Alright, so is this all that’s bothering you? That you’re avoiding blind dates by going out with a friend to read books?”
further up his leg. He had a sudden realisation of what could be causing the tickle and he dared to glance over the top of his menu at Draco, who was studying his own menu. Frowning, Harry turned his gaze down again. Then he gasped out loud.
Harry repeated. “Anyway. She somehow knew before I did and asked Charlie to talk to me. And that’s what we did, we talked and then talking turned into more and I realised that, apparently, I liked men a bit more than I liked women. Ginny was good about it, and that’s probably why we’re still good friends now.”
“Plus, we’d lose out on those badly organised people who come in at the last minute,” Draco said wisely. “That’s the real reason we’re here today.”
through it,” Draco nodded. “I’m glad it didn’t end up like that. I don’t think I could have handled an unhappy ending.”
“Ah, nice. I suppose that makes sense,” Harry said, looking around again. “You do have some electricity though?”
“Ron told me what’s happened. I did think it was unusual that we hadn’t heard from him over the last couple of days but I assumed he was just busy,” she said, straightening up and digging a hand into the pocket of her robe. “Here’s the antidote. I got it from the Aurors first aid supplies.”
Harry shook his head, closing the door behind him. “Don’t worry about it. He was alright by the time we left, although I’m not even sure how much of it he’ll remember in the morning. He said he’d had a fair bit to drink.”
“It’s in the backroom in a temporary pot,” Draco said, shaking his head. “We’ll have to see if we can get a new one to replace the one I broke.”
“I’ll look forward to it,” Draco replied with a smile, shifting across so that he could rest his head on Harry’s chest. “Should I warn my parents?”
“That was mine,” Draco said, averting his gaze slightly. “I made it, I mean and they allowed me to bring it in. The reason I didn’t tell you then was because you said you’d want me to make it for you all the time, and that gave me all kinds of anxiety.”
“Well, it depends. I’ll wrap it and then your mum can put them in one of her vases that she’s got at home,” Harry said with a chuckle. “Alright, it’ll take me a few minutes to put this together. Do you want anything else while you’re here?”
Harry grinned. “I know some would call it boring, or not fancy enough, but honestly I can’t think of a better way to celebrate Valentine’s Day than going back to the place it all started.”
“Hm, maybe,” Harry nodded, putting his plate down again and picking the sandwich up to take a bite. “Oh, that’s good.”
Harry shook his head, laughing to himself as he carried the sign to the door and putting it outside the entrance to the shop. He made sure not to block the pavement or the actual doorway and then stepped back to admire the sign again briefly before heading back into the shop.
Checking his watch, he stood up. “I’d better be going now, too,” he said, stretching. “Thank you for a wonderful lunch, as always, Molly. And thank you all for the lovely presents.”
“No, I agree. I don’t think that would be helpful,” Charlie said. “But don’t spend all your time apologising either. I take it you
“Hey, don’t bring us into this!” Charlie protested, shaking his head. “I’ve already given you my opinion on this.”
Ron followed, listening as Harry explained what each flower was called and what they smell like. Then he picked out several on Harry’s recommendation to make up the bouquet.
“I will, don’t worry,” Harry replied. “It’s about time I took charge of my own life. I’m thirty years old, after all.”
,” Harry said with a sigh. “I was just… alright, I realise that this is probably just going to make me sound insane, but I realised that if I wasn’t being set up on blind dates, there’d be no chance of coming here with you.”
“Good job we’re wizards, then,” Draco replied, pulling out his wand to Summon the water jug that he’d left near the sink. “I have to admit I didn’t plan to eat that much.”
“He wasn’t too bad, really,” Draco said thoughtfully. “He wasn’t particularly… friendly. But he was always fair with us when it came to house matters. We could go to him with problems, although he did prefer it if we went to a prefect first.”
Harry laid the flowers out on the counter and began to build the bouquet up, mixing the flowers with the greenery and Gypsophila. Then he wrapped string around the stems to hold the bouquet together before wrapping it in clear cellophane, leaving the bottom loose enough to fill with water. Once the cellophane was filled with water and secured, Harry wrapped the whole thing in coloured tissue paper.
“Look. I am happy for you, I promise. But it’s nearly one o’clock in the morning and I’ve had way too much to drink to be able to process this properly right now,” Ron said, placing a hand on Harry’s shoulder. “I need to go home.”
Draco nodded. “We’ll write them off as wastage. Which, technically, they would be if we left them here over Christmas.”
Draco frowned as he looked at Harry. “But we’ve been coming here for months because you said they were… why would you say they were if they weren’t?”
“That’s not a problem,” Alice said. “We can lend you one to get him home, and you can bring it back to us.”
A murmured chorus of confirmation spread across the table at the thought of the delicious sponge cake and apples.
“Barely any,” Draco replied. “So don’t worry. No-one is going to look at us and put us on the front page for reading this together.”
“Oh,” Harry said, immediately feeling a blush appear on his face. “Sorry, I… just remembered I… have no milk in at home.”
“I know you will. You always do,” Harry said with a grin. “So, are we changing the hanging display today?”
“I think we should, I can smell it from here and it smells even better than it looks,” Draco said, before looking up at the assistant. “Two lattes and two slices of the chocolate cake, please.”
“But still, he could have made sure we were alright,” Draco tutted. “The older students weren’t too bad, but as first-years, we were terrified.”
“Ah, maybe,” Harry replied, rubbing at his eyes under his glasses. “I think I have some in the house. I’ll see how I feel when I get there. I need some food first.”
“Well, yeah,” Ron said, a sheepish grin appearing. “She’s got a new assistant in her office, I think. Said she thought you’d get on well.”
Draco nodded. “I won’t be having dinner with Mother before coming back to meet you this time though.”
“Yes, now that you mention it, I’m feeling a bit tired too,” Draco nodded, a slight frown creasing his brow. “I felt fine before.”
“No, he was single for a long time. He’s only just taken his partner home to meet the family,” Harry said, beginning to strip the display unit of its flowers. “Molly used to worry about him the same way she was worried about me.”
Ron slid off the bench and propped Hugo on his hip as he left the room, collecting the changing bag as he passed Hermione.
“Thanks, Hermione,” Harry said, turning his attention back to Draco. He had a feeling that there was more to this than it seemed. One thing was sure, he wouldn’t be going anywhere until he had answers.
“Yes, we probably should. I feel like I’ve been awake for days, if I’m honest,” Harry replied. “I think the busy days are catching up with me.”
“I know. You’ve done a good job. I’ve enjoyed getting to know you,” Harry admitted. “It’s not something I ever saw happening, but there we are. People change.”
“Yeah, that’s a good point. I suppose we haven’t really been ourselves these last couple of months, have we?” Harry replied, glancing at Draco who shook his head.
“Oh, you’re still seeing him?” Ron asked, blinking. “You haven’t mentioned him, that’s all. We thought maybe it had fizzled out.”
Harry gave a huff of laughter. “Miles better. You know, I’ve never really been one for celebrating Valentine’s Day. Lord knows they never went particularly well for me at school.”
“No idea. We need to not do that again,” Draco said, shaking his head slightly. “I don’t think I could cope if we had that to do every week.”
Harry looked down at the list and then back up at Draco with a groan. “Oh my… you’re right. Why didn’t I notice that?”
“Here you are, darling,” Pansy said as she came back into the room again, a large glass in one hand. “Dinner will be ten minutes. Theo says hello, but he can’t possibly come out to say it in person as the potatoes will burn.”
“Probably,” Draco said with a nod. “It’s Valentine’s Day, most people will be out at some fancy restaurant, won’t they.”
Sitting down, he knew he should look over the paperwork for the next surveillance mission, but he just couldn’t face it tonight. He just wanted to eat his sandwich and go to bed. So that’s what he did. He stood up as he popped the last of his sandwich into his mouth, heading back into the kitchen to refill his glass before going upstairs and getting into bed.
Harry nodded again. “Yeah, I think having more red and blue will look more effective against the yellow.”
Harry laughed. “No, that doesn’t surprise me. I don’t know if anyone else would really care that they’re seeing each other though.”
“I’ve been the same,” Draco admitted, taking another sip from his mug. “I’ve spoken to Pansy a few times, and Mother, of course, but other than that I haven’t done much at all.”
“Here’s the blanket,” Draco said, pulling a soft woollen throw down from the back of the sofa. He shook it out and spread it across both of their laps.
Draco grinned. “You know what they say about great minds. Shall we eat before exchanging presents, then?”
“Oh, good choice,” Draco nodded. “I haven’t thought about it, to be honest, so let’s see…” He paused and looked at the menu board that was behind the counter. “I think I might just have the chicken salad again. I don’t really fancy ham today and everything else is a bit messy to eat while reading.”
“He does. It’s not a bad thing though, given what he’s been through,” Harry said. “He wasn’t himself for a while.”
Harry shook his head. “It’s alright, I know that you all meant well, you just all forgot to listen to me, that’s all.”
“By the way,” Draco said, sticking his head back around the doorframe and making them jump again. “That bouquet is one of your best.”
Harry nodded, biting his lip slightly. “Does it look alright? I know this is usually your department but I thought I’d have a go.”
“Well, I have to say I wasn’t expecting that,” Harry said, sitting down. “Wow, these chairs are soft.”
Draco followed a second later, picking up most of the same flowers as Harry. Then they stood side by side behind the counter and began to make up their arrangements.
The Burrow was warm and welcoming when Harry arrived, and full of happy, excited chatter from the adults and shrieks of delight from the children as they opened their presents. Overnight, a light layer of snow had fallen in Ottery St Catchpole making everywhere look even more Christmassy.
They both put their wands down and positioned the bouquets carefully inside the vases, turning them to see the display from all angles. Then they looked at each, each wearing a satisfied grin.
“Oh, sorry. Can I have the ham salad on white, a large latte and a slice of the chocolate cake please?” Harry said, feeling his cheeks turn red as he spoke, though he couldn’t put a finger on the reason why.
“Well, no, it’s not really a dessert for Christmas,” Harry said, shaking his head. “Not that I’ll complain if you
"And you didn't think to tell someone about the kidnapping?" Blaise snapped at him, sweeping his hand across his forehead with fear at what could have happened to Neville. The night just keeps getting worse.
It feels like he has just got rejected which really hurts and he fucking hates the feeling. His heart feels like it has broken into smaller pieces and now he feels as if he can't breathe. He did his best to act normal and breath. Its all he could do. Besides, there was plenty of fish in the sea, right? In fact, why did he even think he had a chance with Malfoy? It was highly impossible. Nobody that perfect could have feelings for someone like himself.
Harry felt the warmth rise up from his chest to his neck and with it, a blush that appeared on his cheeks. "Oh, why didn't you kiss me back then?"
"It's so good to be here!" Draco said with little enthusiasm, smiling. He just didn't want to sound too happy in front of this family. In the corner of his eye, he spotted Weaselette glaring angrily at him. He honestly had no idea what he had done to anger the youngest Weasley, so he ignored her.
Ron said he should tell Dumbledore about Umbridge and what she's doing, but Harry doesn't want to worry the headmaster as he knows he has other issues to deal with. Not to mention the headmaster hasn't spoken to him since June.
Harry sighed deeply and began to doodle on his parchment. He didn't really have a use for it during Charms class. He realized he was drawing quite dark stuff like broken hearts, sad faces, and even blades and knives. It appears he's even written a few things down like "Stupid", "worthless", "Why do I even exist?", and "Ugly". He frowned deeply at the words that printed themselves in his brain and starts to draw again. "I'm always so alone," he writes slowly in his slightly messy handwriting. "Even when surrounded by people that I know."
Lucius nodded and searched his drawers for a piece of parchment. Finally, he found a white envelope with a nice sheet of fine paper inside. "Can I possibly get a little help with this letter?" he asked her carefully. "I don't want my letter to sound anything but accepting." Narcissa nodded and walked around the desk to his chair.
Draco raised an eyebrow curiously, wondering if bunny rabbits do have a smell. He's never touched or been near one so he wouldn't know. Is it the fur that smells or the body? "Bunnies have a smell?"
Harry didn’t sleep at all that night after they got back from the Hogwarts express. He was too scared to. He didn’t want to have another nightmare of Sirius falling through the veil at the
"I saw you and Cedric out near a tree," Fred admitted to him and smiled curiously. He actually brought Harry out of his dark thoughts for a little while. "Seems like you were having quite the conversation if I do say so myself. Are you guys...?"
Ron and Hermione rushed over to Harry, worried for their best friend who's being kept in detention with Draco. "We'll stay and help you finish Harry," Hermione said, not acknowledging Draco at all and he was fine with that.
"Shh..." the boy whispered, staring into bright green eyes with worry. "I'm sorry...for what they did to you. I wish I could stop them."
"They were a mixture of Ravenclaw and Slytherin students," Ivy told him, wiping at her eyes with her palms and messing her black makeup up, making it smudge her cheeks and around her eyes. "One of the Slytherin guys was named Jacob, and his friends Michael and Max. I recognize a Ravenclaw girl as Kiely and her best friend Tobias."
Harry didn't know what to say to all his fellow Gryffindors. So, he just said, "Hi!" It's all he really could say right now.
"Have you ever been in a relationship before?" Harry asked him. He just had to know. It was curious, finding out if your friend has liked and been with someone when they didn't know. He felt like he was holding his breath when waiting for Draco to answer the question
Draco looked over at him and gave a slight small smile back. His head was killing him with all the millions of thoughts rushing through his mind about his cousin's state and how Pansy is helping her. He trusts Pansy to do what she must to help Ivy, but he does wish he were there with them. Ivy needs the help.
Suddenly, a loud groan was heard, Harry's fingers gripped onto Draco's hair violently tightly, and Draco felt the head of Harry's dick explode in his mouth. A flavour of fruit, pine, nuts, salt, and honey all at the same time satisfied his taste buds. The Slytherin kept swallowing and swallowing the semen filling his mouth, except for the film of sperm that coated his tongue and inner cheeks. He loved the taste of Harry more than anything else in the world. Including apples.
Harry pushed his way through the elongated branches from the Willow tree. They were pretty like always and looked like emeralds on a string. He shook the branches, watching as rain droplets would fall down and splash on the ground.
"How about both?" Draco suggests softly, leaning closer and brushing his lips over Harry's. He just needed to feel Harry's soft lips on his again. They were mesmerizing and every time they touched his own, he just forgets where he is, and his brain shuts down. "But we can get the couple photo together. Group photos can be after and then we can eat."
"Thank you," Harry says softly and a little gratefully complete with a forced smile. He went to reach for his trunk, but it wasn't anywhere in the room. It occurred to him that either Fred or George took his trunk up to Ron's room. They didn't have to though. He was able to do it himself and he didn't want anyone to do things for him.
Neville continued from where he left off just as Ginny got Luna’s attention once again by kissing her cheek. "How were your holidays, Harry?" he asked when gingerly patting his cactus on its skin where no spikes were.
"Anytime," Draco said and reached up to place a hand on her shoulder. "Just pick a date and time and I will arrange it for you. I promise this will help you. I know it would. I did my research."
The ferret bit Crabbe on the finger and played with him like he was a chew toy when he tried picking him up. Harry snickered and thought that Draco as a ferret is so adorable! There was a flash of white light and Draco was back, glaring at the Weasley twins with tinges of red on his cheeks from humiliation. Fred and George wriggled their fingers at Draco and blew kisses at him.
Draco let out what sounded like a squeak from the compliment and he blushed while biting his lip. "Thanks, Harry," he said sweetly and with his other hand, he pushed back his fringe to the side of his head. "You've got a gorgeous voice too."
Harry felt a blush rise from his neck at the thought of taking Draco to the Yule Ball and being his date. A guy can really dream about that. "I guess," he says in an almost dreamy voice. He closed his eyes and thought of the whole thing, of taking Draco to the Yule Ball, walking into wherever it will be held arm in arm with him and dancing with him. Then he opened his eyes quickly and shook his head. "I can't tell the professor about my dreams of dancing with Draco."
Harry supported Draco's weight as he moved to one side and flopped tonelessly down on the bed, drawing steadying, deep breaths in as he pulled his body back under control. He managed to say, "You didn't come." It wasn't a question.
Draco shook his head. "Horrible father, no. More like annoying as hell. But you can make up for that. The First order from me is to befriend the Weasleys." He smirked at his father's anxious reaction to the first order. "I'll think of other things soon enough for you to make up for."
"Heeey!" Harry said with a prolonged 'e' and wiped the cream off his nose, a blush creeping up his face and with it a wave of heat. All he could hear was Draco and Blaise laughing at him, Ron snorting, and Ivy giggling. He groaned as Draco did it again but this time with more cream. He would have looked like Rudolph but with a white and soft nose. And then Draco did something that Harry could have gasped from. He licked the cream off Harry's nose and then gave a kiss to the end of his nose too.
"Yes, and yes," Ivy said, nodding about those two questions the medic witch gave her. "I use foundation a lot but only on the parts of my body which will be seen by everyone else. It's why I wear jumpers a lot, but also to cover my... scars. Unfortunately, the age thing is correct but I don't want to stay young forever. I want to grow old with someone who I'll love forever."
"Oh," said Draco and he understands what Harry wants. A dance. He is still craving a dance with his Harry since they last discussed a dance together. "I would love that, Harry. Lead the way, please. I'm wanting to dance with you until my legs are jelly and body is limp."
Draco ended to hug and looked into Ivy's blue eyes which he knows are fake. But if they are fake how can he see the emptiness in them? "Alright," he said and knew what he had to do and how to help her. "How about I book you in for a psychiatrist appointment at St Mungo's mental Health Ward?"
Draco looked up at the bloke, right into his lime green eyes. They remind him too much of Harry's, but Harry's eyes are emerald green, the prettiest shade of green in the world. He wants to see those emerald green eyes again. He doesn't really want to dance but he doesn't want to sound rude and decline the offer, so he nodded. "Alright."
Harry shrugged. He didn't know if he should tell Cedric about the kiss or not even if it was the most exciting thing that has ever happened to him. "Nothing much," he told him, careful about saying anything that could relate to his health. "He just asked me how I was doing and how classes have been."
Neville smiles and pat Blaise on the shoulder, a little scared about what the Slytherin could get up to. He just hoped this master plan of Blaise's won't be too bad. "You do that. I bet Harry loves seeing a flushed jealous Draco because of a centaur."
Harry tried to hold back a laugh; his best mate looked quite stylish in a fedora and not even silly at all. It suited him very well. "Found anything you want?"
Joslyn pulled Draco away from her mother and into the lounge room. Her big sister, Harriet, looked up at her from her computer, then at Draco as he entered the lounge room. She looked so shocked and puzzled at the same time.
Harry, Draco, Ron, and Hermione reappeared into the Potions classroom. Harry and Draco were still hand in hand but they didn't care if people stared at them even if they actually were being stared at by everyone in the classroom.
Harry smiled at the thought of Draco, comparing him with Cedric. Why he was doing that? He had no idea. He turned and left for Gryffindor common room to work on one of his essays, even though he wanted to go and find Draco to have a chat with him.
"There, there, Ronny-kins," George said softly while stroking his younger brothers' hair. The easiest way to get back at him right now is to caress his hair and it always works. He and Fred will come up with a better way to get back at him sooner. "It's okay
"Hello, Malfoy," Hermione then spoke to make the silence disappear and also gave him a small smile at the loving gesture he gave Harry. She just adores seeing them together even if Harry looks a little down and isn't eating anything. It's worrying for her to see her best friend looking so down. She'll have to ask him about it later.
"Does my breath really smell that bad?" Harry asked gently, afraid the truth will come biting back at him someday if he forgets about this important spell.
Draco laughed quietly at his boyfriend, thinking about why he would want the compliments to be stopped when he obviously likes them. "But I love seeing your cheeks turn that beautiful shade of red, Harry," he says and reaches a hand up to move some of Harry's fringe away from his scar. It's so he could lean up and place a kiss to the lightning bolt scar.
Harry let out a snort, knowing too well his best mate would be hungry. Hungry is like an emotion to Ron. It's a mood that he always is in. "That's an understatement, Ron," he said and gave him a smirk. "You're always hungry."
"I- um," stuttered Harry and he rubs at his arm, looking sideways at the floor. Come on, this shouldn't be too hard to say. Where's that Gryffindor bravery gone? "I actually wanted to ask you if you would be my date to the Yule Ball."
Harry let go of the hug slowly and stared into dull brown eyes and those brown eyes stared right back into his green ones. The next thing Harry knew, George was leaning in. Harry wanted to stop the kiss as he didn't feel anything romantic for this Weasley brother – even though he knew George is kind of hot – but let himself be kissed. He still felt that very homey and natural feeling when kissing George. It was slow and Harry thinks it is supposed to be loving but couldn't tell. It was like kissing a brother – which he doesn't have – except for the Weasleys.
Draco nodded, winked, and flew off towards the castle. Harry ignored the flush on his cheeks and soared after Draco. By the time they got back to the Willow tree, dismounted their brooms, pulled on the invisibility cloak, and headed inside they were fairly tired. They had their brooms tucked under their arms tightly so the brooms wouldn't move the cloak upwards.
Draco stopped at a blank wall with two torch lights 1.5 meters apart from one another and turned to a confused Harry. He got out his wand, looked around the Courtyard and whispered "Alohomora," and pointed his wand at the wall. Harry saw the wall start to deform; the whole wall just sank down into the floor like it was being eaten up. Behind the sunken wall was a hallway, a dark lightless hallway going who knows where. The Slytherin took a step over the wall and held out his hand for Harry which the Gryffindor grabbed hold of Draco's hand and he let him lead him into the darkness. The wall behind them rose, leaving them in the pitch-black hallway.
Harry forgot about everything except chasing the snitch. He and Draco both fought to catch the elusive winged sphere. It was easier to spot the golden light against the dark of the Pitch but not easier to catch. They flew in a tight pattern, each trying twisting moves to lose the other. It was a far different game playing one on one with Draco. When they competed together there were always the bludgers and other players to look out for. Without those distractions, they both were able to push themselves to do more and more daring tricks. They were challenging each other to keep up.
Before Ron could say anything, Hermione came out of nowhere with her 'S.P.E. W.' badge formally presented on her robe. "What are you two on about now?" she asked her friends who seemed to be bickering.
Harry flushed at what Draco said that was true. He was enjoying looking at the view in front of him. "I-, n-no..." he stuttered and cursed himself for the stuttering as it's a big giveaway. "Yes, I am enjoying the view." He rubbed slightly at his neck and saw Draco turn his body around to look up at him from his book. He saw a flash of emotion through Draco's silver eyes: surprise, need and passion...? "Enjoying the view of me catching the snitch," he quickly corrected before anything accidentally came out wrong. That's when he noticed what Draco was wearing. A dark cashmere sweater with black fleece joggers and his usual Dragon scale boots.
"How are you able to afford it, then?" asked Dean, and his eyebrows gathered in a little in curiosity. She must live in the muggle world or something if she has muggle money to afford these things. "It's got to be worth thousands of dollars. Do you live in the muggle world too?"
Draco loved seeing Harry smile; it's been a while since he's seen an actual smile from this boy. It was attractive, adorable, cute... Oh, he could just go on and on. "I think owling each other would be best, then we can figure out where to meet up."
Harry looked back over at Draco; his face was as pale as Sir Headless Nick. He knew the article was bad, he just hoped it wasn't too bad and would cause Hagrid to stay inside his hut or even leave the school grounds.
"What did they do to it!" Harry said angrily as they walked up to the stadium. The entire smooth field of the grassy pitch was now a twisting mass of thick, tall bushes. No wonder Quidditch was cancelled for the year
Sirius rolled his eyes knowingly. He knew that look, James had always stuttered when talking or even thinking about Lily. "Mm-hmm," he said with disbelief. "Are you sure there's nothing you want to talk to me about or even ask me? You know you can talk to me, Harry."
"We also, in a hallway, went through a white hallway with the words RedRum painted in...what I don't hope is blood," said Neville, shuddering at the memory. This day was just too horrifying.
Lucius laughed a little softly; of course, spending time with he looked down at the photo, his son did indeed look like he was in love. The way he's staring into Harry Potter's eyes, it was beautiful to see. He then looked back up at his wife. "He is definitely in love. Do you know if they're dating yet?"
"What did you tell him?" Harry asked as he filled up two pots with soil and placed three worms in the soil of both. He grabbed a small rose bush, dug a hole with his fingers and planted it.
The two boys didn't even realize Pansy was in the room but even if they did they wouldn't care. The Slytherin common room was empty from when they first entered, so they knew they could do a few things without being seen. One of those things was Harry sliding his hand down Draco's stomach and under the waistband of the Slytherin's jeans while they continue kissing, and Draco's tongue was down Harry's throat.
"Knew it!" replied Fred but with a satisfied smile on his face and running his hands through his hair, flipping it back. Harry watched as Fred's hair flopped back into place. He had an urge to feel it, to feel another guy's hair but he didn't try to.
"I'll tell you after class, Seamus," Dean whispered back to him, smiling slightly at his confused boyfriend. Seems like muggle gardening does pay off after all.
"You were brilliant, Harry," Draco said, blushing from what he admitted and smiling from how red Harry's cheeks were.
He rolled up his other sleeve on his right arm and looked down at his bare right arm with a few cuts here and there. He grabbed the blade with his left hand and began to cut on his right arm. First cut, second cut, third cut and fourth cut. As he cut for the fifth, it was the deepest and stung the most. He liked this pain, even though it stung the most. He deserves it for being an attention-seeking git.
Harry smiled at Narcissa and embraced her in a comfy hug, knowing she needs it from what he witnessed earlier this morning. "Be safe, Narcissa."
Harry raised an eyebrow at Hermione but looked away, not wanting whatever this little shenanigan is to fail.
"Harry, what are-" Lucius dropped the rose petals on the floor and stared at his son's boyfriend. "Are you naked?" he asked awkwardly.
Draco felt himself blush and he shook his head. Being called an angel is pretty new to him and he likes it. "Harry, you have your scars, and that is alright.," he said while giving Harry's nose a kiss. "They are part of you and you're beautiful just the way you are."
"Oh, I forgot to tell you that Dumbledore's dressed as Gandalf," Harry told her when he placed his Niffler back onto a pile of gold beside him. He probably won't forget it. Sometimes he just doesn't see how cool Dumbledore can be when he's not sending him back to the Dursleys for the summer break.
After the broadcast, Harry held his wand up to Emmaline's mouth and she screamed loudly. It filled the corridors of Hogwarts and everyone had to cover their ears. Harry had to suffer a little bit of deathness, but he was fine with that.
With a flick of the professor's wand, the reindeer antlers on the five students had disappeared. "Alright students, it's time for your next class," the professor yelled out to his students who were all laughing joyfully.
Harry swiftly shook his head. Jealous? Who's jealous? Definitely not him. No way. "N-No..." He swallowed. Damn. The traitorous stutter. It always gives him away. Blaise just continued to laugh.
Harry quickly mounted his firebolt and flew towards the dragon, doing a barrel roll over the fire breathing dragon to escape its flames. Everyone in the stands had leapt to their feet, cheering and applauding Harry as he just escaped the dragon. Harry kept teasing the irritated dragon, soaring over its head, under its legs until the Dragon swung its tail at Harry.
Harry raised an eyebrow and thought about students thinking that he and Draco are shagging. The thought about doing that with Draco filled him with warmth and lust but pushed the lust feeling away.
When Romelia blacked out, her black hair knotting together against the corridor wall, Christina sighed and looked behind her at her brother.
"Fine," Seamus said with a sigh. He pulled up the covers of the sheets above his chest and laid down on his side, facing his boyfriend and closed his eyes.
Harry rushed into the kitchen just in time to see Sirius and Remus sitting by the Kitchen island drinking cups of tea. "Sirius! Remus!"
After lots of talking and discussing matters, Lucius finally joined his family again. "That was horrible!" he scowls at his son, who made him do this in the first place. "We're invited over for dinner on Saturday night. Saturday night! That's when I get my nails polished with clear sheen and wash my hair!"
Draco nodded but hesitated, staring right into green emeralds. He leaned forward, his hand on Harry's cheek was slightly pushing Harry towards him and he kissed the Gryffindor's cheek. Harry's cheeks felt so warm and soft to the touch. He leaned away after disconnecting his lips from Harry's cheek and smiled at the rosiness to Harry's cheeks. "Promise me you won't try to do anything stupid like this again?" he asked with an affectionate smile and felt the blood run down to his cheeks.
Draco walked into the room and split apart from the others. He wanted to find Harry because he knows Harry should be here somewhere. The song 'This is Halloween' playing loudly in the background and the freaks in the room danced to it while the students of Hogwarts just wandered around like lost dogs. Was that Professor McGonagall? He was sure he saw her stroll to the food table. Or was she floating like a ghost? He couldn't tell.
Ivy flushed red at the information she's being fed to by her cousin which is pretty much right. She has been shagging a few girls from Beaxbatons in secret, which she thought was in secret. Maybe she should lead them into the dorm later on in the evening like right before curfew. The luckiest part of her sex life if the spells in which she can make her cuts disappear for an hour or two. So, she can have clean arms, that aren't worrying, while she shags other girls.
Harry got out his wand, pointed it directly at Dudley's face. He knew he wasn't allowed to use magic, but he'd mock his cousin any day just to see him run away and looking all scared. And if it is the only way to get his alone time, then so be it.
Ron lay awake, thinking about the big day ahead of him. He couldn't help but think about who would win. Without hesitation he started asking questions, not knowing if there would be a reply or not. "Harry? Are you awake?"
"Well, you should read it," Hermione said earnestly and watched him eyeing the letters while she ate her porridge. It kind of worried her. She knew how sick and rude the comments in the letters could be as she's read a few when Harry was given them. "Could be somewhat important."
"So now? Would you still say the same things about me again?" Harry asked him and raised his eyebrows as he waited for an answer from the Slytherin. He really could take the Malfoyism, even on his worst days because it means he just has more to wallow in self-pity over when he's alone in Moaning Myrtle's bathroom.
"There's no need to worry about that, Harry," said Draco as he got out of bed and opened his trunk. He pulled out two sets of Slytherin school clothes and handed one to Harry. "I don't know if it will fit, but you can try."
Harry didn't even flinch from the door which slammed pretty loudly in front of him. He begins the slow journey back to his room, feeling his tears form in his eyes as he unscrews the lid from the bottle just to be ready. Goodbye world. The world only judged him anyway so why bother living? He angles the bottle to the side so two pills fall out onto his hand and he shoves it in his mouth without water for him to help the process of swallowing. Goodbye Ron and Hermione. He tips the bottle upside down until ten pills fall out onto his hands and he sighed. He could already feel the effects of the first two pills making him sleepy but that's not what he wants. He just wants this to end. Someone else can save the Wizarding World.
"Some of us have figured out we can cheat in every test just by using Morse Code if we know it," said Chelsea, smirking. Beside her, Zoe was snickering. "Oh, and we pass notes in Tolkien Elvish since none of the professors understands it."
Draco was so confused. What does that gesture mean? Did he do something? Beside him, Harry and Ivy were sniggering at him. What was so funny?
So, for the rest of the night, he just decides to sit up and just stare into the centre of the room, not caring about his sleep patterns as it has been ruined for a while. He doesn't need to sleep anymore. He pondered if he was allowed to be in the common room now. He knows he's not allowed out into the corridors until sunrise, but he just wants to stay up here where it was warm and...lonely.
"AUSTRALIA!" Hermione yelled at him in disbelief. She just couldn't believe this. How can this type of thing even happen?
Hedwig hooted, ruffled up her snowy white feathers, and flew back out the Great Hall to the Owlery. She was to keep a close eye on her owner and if she suspects anything, she'll go right to that nice bookworm known as Hermione and that food-obsessed Redhead named Ron.
Harry was just walking down the halls of 12 Grimmauld place when he heard singing. He knew it was Hermione. She was an amazing singer! As he neared her bedroom, he recognized the song to be Summer Nights from the musical 'Grease'. He honestly loves that musical. It's so classy and romantic. Just the type of musical for a get together with loved ones.
Hermione stopped eating the piece of toast with strawberry jam and looked at the couple with a bright smile. "Oh, we know," she said and remembered seeing the two snogging during certain events and in the common room. "We've seen you snogging at the Yule Ball, dance practices for the Yule Ball as well as in the common room. I'm very happy for you, guys."
As he sat down at his seat, he rolled his eyes. It was obvious to him that Draco was the one invisible and who sat next to him. He felt his cheeks go warm and his heart was beating wildly in his chest, Draco Malfoy, his friend but also crush had been sitting next to him for how long exactly? Harry didn't know but guessed it was since Draco finished his own potion. "Draco! I know it's you, " Harry whispered to the seat beside him though Neville was giving him curious looks. "No need to hide."
Hermione nodded at her. "Lovebirds they are," she mouthed back and was glad her favourite topic was now being discussed. "I've been trying to get Harry to talk to Draco about their love for one another. What about you?"
Harry then spotted Professor McGonagall down the corridor and froze. This was a little bad. What if she sees the wall moving upwards? What if the entrance doesn't seal and it just stays open? It would cause suspicion. "The professor, what do we do?"
I know you will miss having a furry companion, so I got you one. It may not be me, but I hope it will keep you company.
"Mhm," Harry said and nodded sadly. He would have chosen a different subject, but all the rest seem like hard subjects. Especially Arithmancy, whatever it is about. Just the name gives him 'you must have a big brain to do this subject' vibes. "All thanks to Professor Trelawny."
"I'm still pissed at you, mate," Ron said earnestly. He jumped slightly as Hermione elbowed him in the ribs.
"No," Harry said and shook his head slowly, not wanting to talk about the task right now. That was not on his mind and was the least of his problems right now. He just didn't want anything to do with the bloody task. Apparently, these tasks were terrific and difficult? Good. Perhaps he can die easily then.
She looked over at Draco, who was sleeping soundlessly in a snake-like position and scratched behind his ears. Draco woke up, stretched out as a cat would after a long sleep and yawned. Joslyn smiled and folded her hair chestnut coloured hair behind her ears.
Draco smiled and looked towards Harry, who was staring at him with those unnaturally bright emerald green eyes. Such a really pretty colour, almost like the Slytherin green but a little lighter.
Harry nearly fell off the chair as Hermione had startled him, but he managed to calm himself down from getting a panic attack. How can he warn her that panic attacks to him are common? Only when he gets scared. He gave her a weak smile and said, "Hey, Hermione."
"Please, Professor," Lavender said in a pleading voice, and she turned her piglet around so it could stare at the professor with its wide eyes. She hoped the pig would be enough to make her Professor realize how cute it is. "Can I keep it?"
"Well... I- Uh-." Harry stuttered and looked down at the ground a little sadly. "I was going to... but." He never wanted to disturb Ivy and knew he'd probably make it worse. It would embarrass her knowing her singing had been heard. He forgot Draco was still there, lost in his thoughts.
Ron and Harry exchanged glances. They knew that Hermione did all her shopping at Smythwick's bookstore, and there was no danger that they would be shopping there. They both nodded their head at their bushy-haired friend.
"Yes, Draco, you need to look your best For Harry," Ivy says with a little smirk just to tease him and she pats him on the shoulder. The best part about the cousinship is teasing each other. "We all know it."
Draco Malfoy was just minding his own business, scrolling through the books he needed for his second year when he heard a familiar voice as soft as a crup, but annoying as hell. He turned around and leaned against the railing. Of course, if it isn't Harry Potter and the Weasels. He glared at the red-headed family, but his eyes softened as he noticed those intense but pretty emerald green eyes, messy black hair and round out-of-style glasses. It has taken him a whole year to figure out he's crushing on Potter. He couldn't believe it at first when he first found out, he didn't even think of himself as gay. But, oh well, such as life.
Harry stopped as he was back in the lightened library and turned to Draco. Sadly, he has Divination which he knows his death will be predicted and he's not too happy about that. "I have Divination now. What about you?"
"Because I'm a Lesbian," Ivy said easily and she looked down the Gryffindor table and spotted a girl with dirty blonde hair. Lavender Brown. Such a sweetheart as she knows from the Patil twins and other girls in her year.
"You boys should get ready, then," Hermione said, smiling knowingly. "You want to surprise your princes, don't you?" Harry and Dean smiled at her, so she pushed them towards the boys dressing rooms. "Don't just stand there like idiots. Get ready!"
Fred looked up at Harry in surprise. He knew there must have been someone little Harry-kins has been eyeing. He wants to know who it is. Are they older? Younger? Taller? Smaller? But he sees Harry as a...bottom. He could be wrong though. "Oh, who is it?"
Harry smiles at this incredible feeling of being a little happy and presses his lips together, his cheeks pink with a blush. He admired how pink Draco's cheeks were. Or were they red? He couldn't tell because of the cloak and the little darkness they were in. He then winks at him and pulls the cloak off Draco, giving the Slytherin back to the outside world while he's still under the invisibility cloak. Deciding it is time that he departed and head to his own table, he got up from the table and walked away from the Slytherin table with a smile on his face.
Harry sat down next to Ginny, wondering if she knew anything about George's self-harming problem if he was correct that he had one. "What's up?" he asked her.
Harry was waiting by the Slytherin common room entrance for Draco under his invisibility cloak. He needed him, he wanted to spend the night with him, he wanted his first New Year's to be with Draco. Do wizards celebrate the New Year's though? He hoped he wasn't late to see Draco but as soon as he heard footsteps, he walked over to them and saw exactly who he was looking for. Except Draco was with Ivy.
"Get off me, Ron!" spat Ginny and tried pushing him off her. She placed her arm around Luna again. "But yes, it's good knowing you're not dead."
They glanced at each other with small smiles, but then Harry looked away and at his microphone. He doesn't know why, but this song...it's almost growing on him. it just feels so right, being up here with Draco and singing.
All of a sudden, 2 Rainbow Lorikeets, 1 Cockatoo and a Galah came out of nowhere, carrying what looked like a picnic basket. The air had suddenly smelt like Pumpkin pasties, Butterbeer and treacle tart. The boys watched in utter surprise as the birds slowly and carefully dropped the picnic basket onto the table they were sitting at. Draco opened the basket to reveal A couple of Pumpkin pasties, two Butterbeers and two little Treacle Tarts.
"Oh, well..." Cedric said and leaned closer to Harry. "You know the Prefects bathroom on the fifth floor?" he asked in a quiet voice. Harry had to think about where it was at first, but then he nodded. "Take a bath with the egg. The password to enter is 'Pine-Fresh'." He winked at Harry and walked off, making Harry blush a little and rush off to breakfast.
They sat there in befuddlement for a bit, having calmed down slightly. After a minute Harry couldn't help himself, no matter what the situation. He started laughing, "I always knew you were gay Malfoy. Just look at how you style your hair every day".
Harry walked into the Great Hall with Ron and Hermione by his side. He hoped word hadn't gotten out about his sexuality due to the dancing fiasco. The trio sat down at their usual seats, Ron gathering up all the food he could on his plate and Hermione looking at him with disgust.
"I don't mind at all," Draco replied with a smile, really wanting to show Harry these places and spend more time with him. What Harry told him... it sounded like Harry was asking him out. But it wouldn't be a date, he knows this. The thought sounded incredible, to be honest with himself. Draco's eyes trailed from Harry's emerald green eyes down to his lips, and he quickly looked away in case he got caught.
"Harry, who're you looking at?" asked a curious Hermione Granger, drinking a mug of warm of pumpkin juice. She was glancing around the Great Hall to where Harry was looking but didn't see anyone looking back at Harry or herself.
"I know, George. I know," Harry repeated with a sigh. They were still hugging, but that was because Harry didn't want to let go as the fear of what George could try next only made him tighten his grip on the older wizard. "Life is like a train journey." He remembered something on the Discovery channel back at the Dursley's when he was around fifteen, some dude was talking about depression. "People get on and off at different stations. When dealing with grief, all we really can do is move on."
Harry frowned and scratched at his cuts hard from under his sleeves, hoping it would give him a painful enough feeling to numb him. It did, he felt the wave of numbness hit him which he felt satisfied with. He pondered when the last time he cut was. Was it days ago? Weeks? No, it was days ago.
Joslyn walked over and sat beside him. She didn't really care anymore if he was half-naked. "Oh, alright," she said. Then she thought about what he just said. He mentioned Harry Potter. "So, about Harry?" she added, nudging Draco with her elbow in a teasing way.
Harry froze at the sound of his Uncle's voice and quickly managed to put his blade in the pocket of his hoodie. He didn't want to be found out, especially not by his uncle. Who knows what his Uncle would do to him then? "Yes, Uncle. I'm here." Can't he get some actual effin privacy? Jesus...
Harry tried to remember, but he was so scared and lost. He was still half asleep. "My cupboard," he whispered. "I'm in my cupboard, and I'm a freak. I know you're going to punish me... you're going to punish me because I'm bad!" He broke down in a heart-wrenching sob and couldn't stop, he was just so tired of it all! The pain inside was too much, it was too overwhelming. Harry scratched at his arm hard, knowing he was opening his skin back up.
Hermione didn't exactly know who she supported in Quidditch. It was all just so confusing, it was like soccer, but in the air with brooms. Much like the muggle sports, so she just wore her Gryffindor scarf.
Draco looked up at the Gryffindor table and saw Granger bending over and speaking into Harry's ear. Harry just didn't seem to notice her. He stared down at his plate and did not eat. From where Draco stood looked almost white on the skin of the Gryffindor. Draco wished he knew what was going on with Harry and the Weasel. First, they were speaking, then they weren't and now they were.
"A scream," said Blaise clearly, and Pansy glared at him for his feistiness. He smirked and crossed his arms, feeling a little proud but all he hoped was if Neville was okay. He has never heard Neville scream, but the thought was oddly nice, if he had him in bed with him.
"C'mon, let's just head to breakfast," Hermione said, and she placed a hand on his back, just hoping the little gesture will help him. She offered him a small smile and started heading to the Great Hall with Harry by her side.
Harry looked at him as he stood up from the table seat and he nodded. "I'd like that," he says as he knows and hopes he would get a goodnight kiss from Draco. It would be their first goodnight kiss and hopefully not their last.
Draco opened his eyes, noticing Harry was looking to the side of them. He quickly pressed a kiss to his boyfriend's cheek and then to his neck. It made Harry look back at him. "Who are you looking at, Harry?"
"A prank, yes," said Harry, smiling under his Freddie mask. "The whole killing spree thing was a prank for all you Purebloods and half-bloods who know nothing about the muggle world. It was hilarious watching you lot run around the castle screaming your heads off."
"If you keep that up, you'll make me hard," Draco slowly admitted, and he reached out and found Harry's waist. He tried pulling Harry back down onto him, but Harry kept resisting as he was a little shocked to hear that come out of the Slytherin's mouth. He knows what Draco means, of course.
"I told you, I didn't put my name in that damn goblet!" Harry spat out to him but in a quiet voice, so he didn't wake the others. Now he was getting annoyed with his 'best mate'. He scratched at his arm, feeling the relief of the pain once again. "I was here all afternoon as I came back from dinner. So, please, come off it!"
Harry stared at the scared Slytherin and chuckled, and Draco glared at Harry and said, "What?!" The Gryffindor looked down at the floor, just loving how Draco's being when slightly irritated. It always excited him. Oh, nothing, he thought with a smile and dug his foot into the mat. It's just that I find you adorable when facing apparent danger.
Harry just leaned his elbow against the counter and looked around the bar, spotting quite a lot of handsome blokes but they were mainly with woman. So many hot guys are either straight or taken. He continued to look around the bar, earning a few smiles from woman. He smiled back at them but focused his attention back on the males.
"Welcome to the after party of the Hogwarts Massacre," said Pennywise, grinning. He placed a hand on her back and guided her through to the party.
Draco sighed in relief as they were safe and away from students prying eyes. He doesn't mind if people see him and Harry together. Though they would know something is happening and he will let them guess. "That was a close one, Harry," He said and looked to his side at him. "Do you think Granger will tell?"
As he brushed his teeth, he pondered what Draco has planned. He said a restaurant, but which one? There are thousands of restaurants in London. Actually, does Draco even know where 12 Grimmauld Place is? Dang it! This was bad. How would Draco even find him?
Draco's frown turned into a small smile and he felt giddy as Harry called him a pet name. He also couldn't stop the heat and blush from rising up from his neck and to his face. He wrapped his pinky finger around Harry's and shook it. "I promise."
"Yay!" Ron said in a quiet voice just so he doesn't gain attention and began eating hungrily at Harry's nachos with a grin on his face. What? He's just a very hungry bloke.
Ivy sighed at him, waiting to get a 'Hello, Ivy' but nothing came out of her cousins' mouth. Rude little ferret. She still couldn't get the twins prank on her cousin out of her head. "Hello to you too, Draco and where've you been at this late of an hour?"
"Now you know how I feel," Draco says sweetly, and he licks his lips at the temptation to kiss Harry which is definitely hard to not do. "Perhaps if we're really desperate we could escape this place and find a corridor to kiss and cuddle in. Does that sound alright?"
Harry felt a hand grab his wrist and pull him towards an old looking bookcase filled with many old-fashioned books dating back to Merlin's time. He hopes that little scene wasn't too suspicious for Hermione. But right now, he just couldn't believe his eyes at what he was seeing. "Wow!" he whispered in absolute awe. He still felt Draco's hand on his wrist but didn't mind, it felt warm and cozy and was really calming. Draco grabbed a big black leathered book with a white rose icon underneath the title, 'Book of secrets' and pulled it down.
"I remain unable to tell you that, Harry," Dumbledore said earnestly. "Perchance, Severus is keen to tell you since he is your therapist."
Harry and Draco were still swaying to the music, feeling like they were in a dream. The night just felt so magical, like in a fairy tale. 'We are still kids, but we're so in love' was a very powerful message Harry and Draco held on to as well as 'Fighting against all odds' since they both were fighting against something. But the part that drove Draco to near-tears was 'I see my future in your eyes'. He could see his future in Harry's green eyes. It wasn't a clear future, but he could see it.
Harry chuckled, hoisted a leg over Draco’s legs until he sat on the Slytherin’s lap and did just that. He could feel the Slytherin's hardness under him and it made him start to harden a little as Draco’s body, whenever naked or not could always arouse him. Draco let out soft little moans that just made Harry rut faster and bite into the Slytherin's neck until he created a hickey that he felt satisfied with.
"Yes, but that was until Umbridge banned all clubs in Hogwarts," Draco muttered with a frown. What if she catches you?" He remembered waking up to find a lot of Slytherin's surrounding the noticeboard in the Slytherin common room. It was a shame because of whoever found out about the group. Couldn't they just keep their traps shut? He would even join the group. Well, maybe he wouldn't as he doesn't want to be expelled. Merlin, what would his father do to him?
“Well, none of us really told Mum our suspicions,” she said with a grin. “She would never have believed us anyway.”
“It feels like forever since we’ve been here,” Harry said with a sigh as they walked up the steps that led to the entrance. “Don’t you think?”
“One more day won’t make much difference, I suppose,” Harry said thoughtfully. “If there’s nothing suitable, we could put in a last minute order to be delivered tomorrow.”
Harry snorted. “Honestly, I don’t mind. This one had clearly heard of me and wanted the association. I can do without that kind of relationship.”
Draco chuckled, shaking his head. “You’ll be fine. If this one doesn’t work out, then there’ll be another one. Who wouldn’t want to be your date?”
Harry grinned. “I think we’ve probably ordered so many of these now that we’re worthy of the best chicken.”
Harry chuckled and they fell silent as they concentrated on the cleaning up, making sure that everything was ready for opening time the next morning.
Draco nodded. “That’s what I was thinking. We’ll see what we get and then we can plan from there. There’ll be plenty of other things we can do today. We’ll just maybe have to come in early again tomorrow,” he added apologetically.
Normally if Harry was late, it wouldn’t bother him too much but he had never known Harry to be over an hour late. The letter that had been returned to him unanswered had been concerning too. His owl had never once failed to deliver a letter to Harry in the past.
“Maybe nine,” Harry said with a little shrug of his shoulders. “But I’m not really strict about it. Later would be fine too.”
“Twenty, I think,” Draco said. “But we’ll double check tomorrow. They might have asked for extras, just in case anything happens.”
“I…” Harry began, before stopping. He’d been about to say that he already had a date, but then he remembered George’s first question. “I can come for a drink but I can’t be out all night,” he finished lamely.
“I can’t believe you didn’t tell me this sooner,” Harry said, shaking his head. “Like, ten years sooner.”
“I know. I think that’s why Mum worries about you.” Ron admitted. “She was worried Charlie would never settle down and that he’d be a permanent bachelor.”
Harry laughed. “Never say never. Alright, here goes,” he said, pulling out his wand and pointing it at the vase. He muttered a spell, changing the colour from off-white to a deep red. “That’s not bad, is it?”
“We’d better put this away,” Draco said, glancing at his watch. “We need to get closed up. We can do some more tomorrow.”
“Okay. See you back here at six-thirty?” Harry asked, pulling his cloak a bit tighter to shut out the cold air.
“I don’t know. It was a present from Pansy, so I doubt it,” Draco replied, smoothing the blanket out over his leg. “It’s very comfortable.”
Charlie smiled. “Seriously, Harry, there’s no hard and fast rule that says you have to be in a relationship by a certain time of life. Just enjoy doing what you’re doing and it’ll come.”
“I don’t know,” Harry said as he sat down in one of the armchairs. “It seems quieter in this part of the building, and the wood burner keeps it warm.”
“Definitely. I always like adding a new regular to our books,” Draco replied, smiling. “And if they want to sing our praises to all their friends, then even better.”
Harry nodded and began walking again, looking both left and right but finding only occupied alcoves.
“Well that’s a good enough reason to leave it a bit longer then,” Harry said with a laugh. “I’ll be honest, we only came up with the idea today.”
Draco kissed back, wrapping one leg around Harry’s as he did so. “Believe me, so have I,” he replied, his breath coming in short gasps.
“Not as busy as when we arrived,” Harry said, putting the tray down on the table. “I got us each a chocolate muffin. They look lovely.”
“Probably. I never went hungry, anyway,” Ron shrugged, picking up his knife and fork. “And I don’t intend to start now.”
“Hmm, alright, well I suppose I can let you off,” Harry said with a grin as he took another bite. “This
“You mean you haven’t already?” Draco asked, following him through the doorway. “I would have been straight onto her yesterday morning.”
Draco laughed. “Alright, I won’t be a moment,” he said as he moved across the kitchen with their plates.
“I’m sure,” Charlie laughed. “Although a couple of biscuits wouldn’t go amiss? I can’t have a cup of tea without having a nice biscuit to dunk.”
“They really do. These are going to make us a fortune in the run up to Christmas,” Draco said, his eyes shining as he grinned at Harry. “Maybe Pansy is a genius after all.”
“Fiction. That last book was very interesting, but I wanted something a bit more lighthearted this time,” Draco said as they turned down the smaller alley that led to the bookshop.
“And yours to me,” Charlie said, returning the smile. “It’s good to have someone other than a member of my family to talk to.”
“Only a couple of weeks to go and the big day will be here,” Harry sighed. “At least we’ll get a few days rest then.”
Harry shook his head slightly and moved around the table to sit beside Ron. He leaned over and made a face at Hugo too, grinning when Hugo giggled.
“Well, I wasn’t thrilled as you can imagine,” Ron said with a snort as he dolloped mashed potato onto his plate. “But from what I can tell, he’s not too bad. Better than I remember from school anyway.”
“I looked up the most romantic places in the world,” Draco shrugged. “And I couldn’t decide which one, so why not do all of them? Or, at least, most of them.”
“Time flies when you’re having fun,” Draco replied with a laugh. “Come on, this floor isn’t going to mop itself.”
“Good point,” Draco said, nodding. “I’ll speak to Blaise first, before I bring Pansy into it. I don’t think he’d appreciate it if I told her something that’s supposed to be a secret. She still can’t help herself when she hears good gossip.”
a table and you’re not eating off a tray in the lounge,” Harry replied with a grin. “Not that there’s anything wrong with that either, I suppose.”
“This is convenient,” Draco said, looking over his shoulder at Harry. “I like this particular alcove the best. It’s got the window and the fire, and it’s in the perfect position in the shop. Not too close to the café area, but not too far away either.”
“It was nothing,” Draco replied, his cheeks flushing as he concentrated on his chocolate cake again.
Harry frowned again and turned back to his menu. “I will,” he muttered. He didn’t know what Draco was playing at, but he couldn’t help but hope he carried it on when they got home.
“I’ve been telling him that everyone was setting me up, except… they haven’t been. Not for a while,” Harry admitted, ducking his head again. “I had to make up a backstory for the person I was ‘seeing’ – which was Draco all along – so because I was talking about this… made-up man, they stopped setting me up. But when I realised that meant no more ‘dates’ with Draco…”
Harry headed off down the aisle to where he knew the books were. When he got there, he was surprised to only find one copy of the book. Frowning, he picked it up and headed back to Draco. “There’s only one there.”
Draco glanced at his watch. “That time already? Yes, let’s get the sign out and hope for some customers this afternoon.”
“Oh, absolutely,” Harry nodded, moving around the counter and towards Draco to help with the hanging display.
Harry sighed as he pulled his own cloak on and cast a glance at the forgotten book. Picking it up, he made his own way along the aisle to put it back before he went to pay their bill. His stomach felt like it was trying to eat itself.
“You’re telling me. Look, I was sure of my feelings before today. Pansy helped me be honest with myself – not that I’ve told her that – but I still couldn’t tell you,” Draco said. “The fact you actually lied to me hurt. But now you’ve explained, I suppose I understand why you did it and I can’t really blame you.”
Draco shook his head again. “No. Mother didn’t want him anywhere near it when she was first setting up, for fear people would immediately associate it with him. So he’s never even visited. He’s supportive though.”
Harry laughed again and moved to join Draco at the counter and they both piled food onto their plates.
“He’s a Muggle-born wizard, seeing as the shop is on Diagon Alley and Muggles can’t usually get there,” Harry said thoughtfully. “And he played Quidditch as a hobby. I think that should cover everything they might ask?”
Harry placed his book on his lap, his hands folded on top of it. “Well, that was enlightening. I had no idea that it was commonplace for gay wizards to marry women but have a male lover on the side.”
“Working flat out, both at home and at work,” Ron said. “For some reason, every man and his crup have decided to bewitch random household objects this last week. It’s been non-stop.”
Draco stepped into the kitchen of Grimmauld Place, thankful that Harry hadn’t closed the fireplace as he sometimes did. Looking around, he frowned. Everything seemed too still, and there was no evidence of someone being at home except for a single knife in the sink. He looked closer and realised that the knife had the remnants of dried butter on the blade.
“I suppose I would have done too if I were you,” Harry said thoughtfully. “But what I don’t understand is, if it’s perfectly fine to have a gay lover, why can’t you just marry?”
“Alright then, we’re going to Bookworms and Brews,” Harry said firmly. “After going home to change, just like we did the first time.”
“That it’s with the same bloke as before,” Harry said, pausing in his doodling. “He said that because I haven’t mentioned him since the last date that they all thought it must have fizzled out. I’m going to have to start talking.”
“All the tension is gone,” Harry said. “I feel it too. I’ve missed talking to you like this, so I think I’ve been subconsciously holding tension somewhere.”
They were quiet for a few moments as they ate their sandwiches, occasionally meeting each other’s gaze when they paused to take a drink.
“An egg. I couldn’t bring a whole box, but I can spare one for you to have your fry-up,” Charlie replied.
“He said to apologise to you for shouting,” Harry replied, stepping inside as Draco turned to walk back down the hall. “I think it was a bit of a surprise.”
“No, not at all. I’m glad we’ve grown as people,” Draco said, absently stroking Harry’s stomach. “It’s much nicer than it used to be.”
Draco nodded, heading along to the lounge. “I did. I was worried beforehand. I know it was probably silly to be, but… old habits die hard, don’t they?”
“Good. Tomorrow morning we need to water the succulents, don’t let me forget,” Draco said as he passed their unit. “Some of them are looking a little bit worse for wear.”
“I’ve managed so far. We get along really well,” Harry said, a smile threatening to spill across his face. “I know that’s a surprise, given our history, but we’re definitely past all that now.”
“Yes. It seemed the safest option considering the position of the flat,” Draco replied, swallowing the mouthful he’d just taken. “I didn’t want to accidentally break the Statute because a Muggle happened to glance in my window just as I’m using my wand to light the lamps or something.”
Ron snorted. “I’ll say. Most twenty-nine year olds can’t say they fought in a war before leaving school.”
“No, I know it’s not,” Draco replied. “But it’s not something I want for myself. I’m quite happy with my life as it is at the moment.”
“That does make sense,” Draco said, nodding his head slowly. “I suppose I didn’t realise it before.”
“Thank you,” Harry replied, nodding at her before he turned and left the post office. He tucked the receipt into his pocket as he walked. He and Draco were not going on a date that weekend, so he had no plans other than relaxing and, if he was honest, he was quite looking forward to it. He’d deliberately nipped out to the post office that morning to try and make sure that he got a reply from Charlie over the weekend.
Harry stepped back and watched as Charlie threw the powder into the fire, calling out the address of the reserve before he stepped into the flames and disappeared. Then, he cleared his plate and cutlery away, washing them quickly and leaving them to dry on the draining board.
“He’s perfectly healthy, and he’s been microchipped and vaccinated,” Alice continued. “He’ll be better off as an indoor cat after not being outside for so long.”
“I have never forgotten that moment,” Draco said with a laugh of his own. “Of course, it was hilarious to me. But at the same time, I couldn’t help but be glad that it wasn’t
“I’m not entirely sure, if I’m honest,” Draco said. “The old woman I bought this place from told me it was the case, and I’ve never questioned it. She was as old as the hills, so I assume she was telling the truth. Anyway, follow me.”
“It smells great,” Harry said, following her into the kitchen. “I’ve been looking forward to it all week.”
Harry nodded, wringing the mop out for the last time and lifting the bucket to pour out the water. “Yeah, it’s a weird feeling. I always thought you got on with your parents well enough that you wouldn’t mind going home to them.”
“Well… just looking at those names, there’s a definite type. They’re all Quidditch players,” Draco said pointedly. “Seekers, in fact.”
“Probably not long after I started working with you,” Harry replied thoughtfully. “But we haven’t for years.”
Harry grinned and watched as Draco left. They weren’t in the same department at the Ministry, but it wasn’t unusual for Draco to go and investigate objects found during raids prior to them being brought in. Glancing at the clock, Harry groaned before getting up and leaving his office. It was time for his briefing.
“Well, what are you waiting for?” Pansy asked, frowning at him from her place on the sofa. Her arms were crossed across her chest now, and Draco could tell that she was certainly annoyed at him.
Harry pulled Draco closer as they continued kissing. He could feel his heart racing in the best way possible and he attempted to make contact with as much of Draco as he could, the hand that was around Draco’s waist sliding down to cup his backside.
Two weeks after the New Year’s Eve party, Harry walked into his bedroom to find Draco standing in front of the mirror and making a face at his reflection. Upon spotting Harry behind him, he whirled around.
Draco waved a dismissive hand in Harry’s direction as he left. Then he set about watering the plants.
Draco nodded. “Several of my father’s friends seemed rather indifferent to their wives and I always thought it odd, when compared to my parents.”
That evening, Harry sat down beside Ron as usual and leaned over to make a face at Hugo who was, once again, on his father’s lap.
“That would look nice,” Harry nodded, grabbing the sweeping brush and beginning to sweep the floor. “There’s a nice pink ribbon in the drawer too, plus plenty of white.”
Draco shrugged. “Not sure, I assume they must think it’s going to end up coming to our department so want us to get eyes on it before it comes in.”
“Something like that,” Harry said, pulling the Danish out of the bag and taking a bite. “I had a date on Sunday night.”
As they worked side by side, their shoulders pressing together, Harry couldn’t help but think that Draco smelled good. He glanced at Draco out of the corner of his eye every now and then, taking in as much detail as he could about the other man’s appearance, from the tiny curl of hair at the nape of his neck to the minute freckles that were just visible on his cheek. Yes, he thought, Draco was certainly a very attractive man. Then he groaned softly.
“Well that’s even easier than trellis, isn’t it, don’t be daft!” Draco exclaimed. “Give me some credit!”
“Did it feel good? Draco, you were one toe away from me seriously embarrassing us all,” Harry groaned. “I have no idea how I got through it.”
Harry grinned back and opened his mouth to continue, but before he could speak, the door to the kitchen opened again and Charlie walked in. As everyone in the room began to greet him, he turned and pulled someone else into the room.
“I knew you’d think so. It’ll be another five minutes or so for the food,” Draco replied. “So if you’ll excuse me.”
“We’ll probably have at least five more of these days this year.” Draco grinned. “And each one will surprise us again.”
“They don’t do things by half, here,” Draco said as he sat down carefully. “I like that they use bread rolls rather than sliced bread, too.”
“Thank you,” Harry said, laughing again. “I appreciate it. Right, well, have a good night. I’ll see you tomorrow.”
“Any time,” Charlie smiled., standing up and carrying his mug over to the sink. “Let me know how it goes with Malfoy, yeah?”
Harry laughed again. “Happy to help. So, is there anything else about the book you want to discuss?”
“Either is fine by me,” Draco said with a shrug, sipping his own coffee. “It’s not a massively long read so we should easily get it read in a couple of hours.”
“Oh, no, the bottle is fine,” Harry replied, feeling himself turn red as he took the bottle. “Yes, you were right. This is a comfy sofa.”
Harry laughed. “Well luckily I didn’t have to do anything that extreme. I, er, arranged my own dates,” he said before pausing. “I say dates, what I mean is ‘dates’.” He made air quotes with his fingers as he spoke.
“Oh, we’re not doing it outside of work hours,” Draco said, horrified at the thought. “No, no. We’ll do it here in the quiet moments, like you say.”
Any attempt at talking about something other than work was neatly brushed aside as quickly as Draco could manage it, but it didn’t stop Harry from trying. Occasionally he thought he saw a momentary lapse from the other man, but it was hard to tell because Draco was so adept at hiding his true feelings. By mid-December, they were so busy making up centrepieces and Christmas orders that there wasn’t really any room for conversation and so Harry was spared the disappointment of Draco ignoring his attempts to talk any longer.
“Of course I did,” Harry sighed. “Like I said, I’m not great at this. I thought, well I don’t know what I thought. I’ll understand if you want me to leave Paperwhite’s.”
Draco gave him a knowing smile. “That’s one of the reasons I like it, too. Why go somewhere that you can’t have a conversation with the person you’re with? It seems pointless.”
Draco shook his head. “No, none for tomorrow. We can’t really do the ones for Wednesday because they won’t look their best by the time they’re collected.”
“P… plants?” Draco asked, looking around briefly before looking back at Harry, who shook his head. “Alright then… paper?”
Draco turned to look at the clock. “About time we started the clean up. I don’t think we’ll get anyone else in today.”
They worked in relative silence until everything was clean and ready for the next day, then they grabbed their cloaks from the cupboard and made their way out onto the street. Harry watched as Draco locked up and then they both headed along the alley to the bookshop café that they had become so fond of.
“Well, thank you, they are gorgeous,” Molly laughed, sniffing the flowers once more. “I’ll go and put them in a vase in a minute. Go on through to the lounge, as you can hear, everyone’s in there.”
“Will she be put out?” Harry asked, tilting his head slightly as they carried the hanging display unit out to the back room where they could pull all of the flowers out of it.
Harry nodded, an apologetic expression crossing his face. “Yes. I’m sorry. I know it was wrong of me. As ridiculous as it sounds, I’m still not great at this stuff. I wasn’t great when I was fifteen, I doubt I’ll ever be great, but I didn’t want to lose this. I’ve really enjoyed coming here with you and I thought that the only way we could still do it was to come here on fake dates.”
“It’s good. We don’t actually work on the same team within the reserve, so we’re not constantly with each other which probably helps,” Charlie said as the kettle began to whistle. He lifted it up and poured water into each of the mugs. “But even if we were working on the same team, I think we’d be fine. With dragons, there’s no opportunity to let our guard down. We have to be at the top of our game the whole time.”
“No I don’t think we will either. It hasn’t been a bad day, though,” Harry said. “We’ve done a good trade today.”
Finally, when they could eat no more, they lifted up their wine glasses and headed back to the lounge, Draco assuring Harry that he’d take care of the washing up later.
Harry took Draco’s hand as they walked, laughing again. “Then we’ll definitely do that. We’ll just get coffee and cake at Bookworms.”
“I feel the same,” Draco said. “Even just those few weeks where we weren’t speaking properly made me feel like something was missing.”
to be in the dungeons… actually, your common room was in the dungeons! Where were you going when we all got sent back to the houses?” Harry asked as the thought occurred to him for the first time.
Charlie laughed before being interrupted by the roast chicken levitating onto the table. “Oh, looks like dinner is ready.”
Harry nodded, putting the badge back in its box and placing it on the table next to his glass. He smiled at it fondly.
Molly flushed, though she looked very pleased with the compliment. “Oh, don’t be silly. You’ll have to forgive me, Charlie didn’t mention that he was bringing a guest,” she said, giving Charlie a stern look.
“You mean you didn’t use an umbrella charm?” Harry asked, turning back to Ron with an incredulous look.
“Now? Now, I think we do this,” Harry said, breaking off to kiss Draco deeply. “And then we go and get dinner.”
“I know, I know, it just… never mind,” Harry said, shaking his head slightly. “Come on, let’s go and get sat down.”
“Nothing wrong with that,” George chipped in from his place on the sofa behind Ginny. “Look how long it took me and Angelina to get together.”
“Oh good, just wanted to check that Harry and Draco are still in one piece,” Charlie said with a grin.
“And my reserve was happy to have Arlo join us,” Charlie added with a shrug. “We were lucky and it worked out for us. I don’t know what we would have done if the transfer hadn’t been approved.”
“Don’t mention it. You might not enjoy those nights either,” Draco replied with a grin. “But I think you’ll like them better than the dates you’ve had so far.”
He thought back to when his mother had first opened the shop. There had been a few mornings when they’d come to open up and found the glass in the door or the window smashed. People were not so quick to forget what his family had done during the war, it seemed. Thankfully those mornings were a thing of the past now, and had been for a long time. Harry joining the team had been something of a surprise to everyone and had certainly helped. Even before that, though, people had come to accept that neither Draco nor Narcissa were of the same mindset as Lucius. The business had grown steadily since. Narcissa had been a passionate gardener behind the closed doors of Malfoy Manor for as long as Draco could remember. Seeing her so happy in the florist’s made him happy too. In fact, he couldn’t imagine doing anything else with his life now.
Harry rolled his eyes with a smile and made his way around the sofa. He placed the tray down on the low table and seated himself at one end of the sofa.
“Well, no, I hadn’t pictured it like that either,” Harry admitted. “Maybe we were naïve to think we wouldn’t be noticed at the party, though.”
“Then I apologise in advance if Theo’s meal is disappointing,” Harry said, catching the flower and depositing it neatly in the bin. “But I’m sure it won’t be.”
Draco tilted his head as though considering Harry’s words. “Nine out of ten, would kiss again,” he said with a grin.
Harry slowly made his way down to the Great Hall for breakfast even though he wasn't hungry. He sat next to Hermione and Ron at the Gryffindor table facing the Slytherin table. The first person he laid eye contact on was Draco who was eating muesli with Yoghurt. Harry faked a smile at him, and Draco smiled and winked back. Damn that wink, it got Harry good and made the blood rush to his cheeks, forming a blush. He grabbed a bowl of warm porridge which smelt of honey and almonds and started eating it slowly. The good thing about this morning was that he actually was feeling hungry and that made him kind of glad. He hates vomiting up his food, even if he knows he deserves it, but he hopes he won't be vomiting again.
"So, uh... how are we going to fix this ferret?" Harry then asked as he looked down at his ferret boyfriend. The ferret squeaked at him like he was trying to talk with him. He then corrected himself. "I mean Draco." He smiled at his adorable and little boyfriend. "Well, hello little Dwayco."
George looked up at Harry with tears streaming down his face. He turned away from him, not wanting to talk to anybody about why he feels so down. It's an obvious reason, actually.
"Hello Freddie, my dearest twin who just so happened to kiss Harry our dearest non-blood brother," George said, wiggling his eyebrows at them. "We have so much to talk about, Fred." He squinted his eyes, which had a twinkle of mischief in them. "Firstly, when did this happen? How did this happen? Why did this happen? Lastly, why haven't you told me you and Harry were..."
Draco had just made it up to the boy's dormitory with a smile on his face and entered to find Blaise meditating again! And Theodore lying on his bed while throwing and catching a strange yellow ball, but not the snitch, up and down. Crabbe and Goyle were nowhere to be seen. He walked his way to his bed to find an envelope on his bed.
Harry said nothing, he just couldn't. He didn't want his best mate finding out about the punishments he gets at the Dursleys. He knew Ron would think of him as a freak and unfriend him. He wiped away the tears in his eyes quickly and stared down at the blue fluffy blanket on his bed.
"Thank you, Hermione," Harry said, giving her a little smile. The blush was still formed on his face and he just couldn't get rid of it. "But I really don't like him like that..."
The professor sighed and pinched the bridge of his nose at the happy couple happily snogging in his classroom. "Boys!" he nearly snapped but kept his tone down. "Must you leave your snogging until after class?"
"No, who are you?" Draco hissed, wanting to get away from this creep so badly but he was scared the freak might stab him. Where's his father when he needs him? "And what is this place anyway? Freaks dancing club or something?"
As the song ends, they pulled away from the kiss to take a breath and to stare into the other's eyes. The music player buzzed again and started the next song. They danced to all three songs of: Fun - We are young, Bruno Mars - Just the way you are, and Ed Sheeran - Galway girl, ending in spinning, hip bumping, and laughter.
Harry frowns and really wishes a car can come speeding through the car park and hit him hard enough to kill him. While scratching at his cuts from underneath his sleeve, he slowly catches up to his relatives and follows them inside. As instructed to like always, he grabs a shopping cart and begins the slow journey of following his aunt around Aldi, only stopping when she puts items in the trolley.
Harry was about to shake his head but remembered something did happen. Draco. It's the only good thing that has happened since coming back to Hogwarts. "Yes, actually," he said with a halfhearted nod of his head. "Back in Care of Magical Creatures class, Draco made a truce with me."
Moaning Myrtle came out from her cubicle, looking all sad and mopey like she usually does. "Oh, Harry!" she sobbed and floated over to him, wiping the ghostly tears from her dead eyes. "We never had any of those back when I was alive."
Fred and George looked at each other and smirked, not thinking that they would be asked to be Harry's Yule Ball partner ever. "Freddo here is free," said George, pointing to his twin beside him. "I'm going with a Hufflepuff guy named Steven."
Harry sighed and grabbed a couple of Frankfurt's, squirted some tomato sauce on his plate and dipped a Frankfurt in. He didn't really feel hungry at all, but he ate a Frankfurt just to give him some energy for the rest of the day. He knew he'd just vomit the food out later, as he had been doing for ages now. It sucked. All of it including his life. Why can't he just choke on his vomit and die?
"Yes, Draco," Harry yelled back and turns around, watching as Draco entered through the doorway and stood there in shock, looking at their surroundings. "It's just Rowena's bedroom, I think." He smiled at the shocked Draco, wondering what size Draco's bedroom is. "Have you never seen a bedroom this size before, Draco? Don't you live in a manor?"
"My day has gotten better since I'm with you," Draco said in a sweet tone of voice, and his cheeks glowed as he moved a little closer to Harry. To his admiration, Harry blushed because of his words of choice. Maybe he should flirt with Harry more often than keeping it inside himself. Flirting with this Gryffindor is exceptionally fun, specifically when he gets to view Harry's reaction and see him blush.
"Good m-morning, Ron," Harry said reluctantly, his eyes blinking infrequently, and he was sitting on the end of his bed. These nightmares always scared him, in fact, they scarred him. Harry could never get rid of these nightmares, they just come out of nowhere.
Draco nodded. He enjoys annoying his cousin at times. He admits it is fun. But right now, he has a game to play. "Ivy, Truth or Dare?"
Draco sighed and rubbed at his brows. "Fine..." He said and quickly started re-potting a Sunflower and another rose. "Come on let's finish this. The sooner we are done the sooner we are out of here."
Draco walked with his mother away from Hogwarts so they could apparate back to the Manor. But the manor, it held many dark memories from the past three years and Draco didn't want to return but he did so anyway. As they landed by the large black gates, he hesitated. "Shall we get the elves to paint the manor pink?" he asked with a small smile. Although, he definitely didn't want to be living in a pink house. A purple house, he could do just not a pink house.
Hermione noticed her friend was staring and looked over to where he was looking at. Draco Malfoy. She smiled knowingly at Harry. "So, sending letters to each other?" she asked softly. When Ron was distracted by talking to Ginny further down the table, she continued, "That's adorable, Harry! Are they love letters?"
Draco's fingers turned into claws and dug into Harry's chest, scrabbling at the skin there and dragging hot, red tracks the length of his torso.
There were whispers and murmurs going around the Great Hall about the sudden event that will take place.
"Sure!" Harry replied whilst placing his quill and parchment back in his bag. He watched Draco go to the exit of the classroom but stay at the door waiting for him. He didn't realize until Draco turned to look at him that he was staring at his ass. He needs to stop doing that.
As soon as he finished eating, he nodded at Draco and pointed his head towards the door. Draco nodded back and got up and mouthed 'Library.' Harry nodded and waited for Draco to leave the Great Hall, then he followed from behind and caught up to him. "Hello, Draco."
Ginny smiled as Draco came out of nowhere and was leaning on the compartment door. Draco was staring lovingly at Harry as he heard what came from his boyfriend's beautiful mouth. "You must really love him, Harry," she said, winking at Draco and thought about if she can get Harry to admit anything else.
"Thank you, Neville," Harry says with a nod of appreciation but wondered how his dorm mate was able to get the Gillyweed. He didn't want to ask questions though. He then felt like there was something missing in him. Well, a someone. "I'm going to go for a walk." He had gone over to his own bed and began searching through his trunk. "See you later!"
"The only word that I can come up with is incredible, Harry," Draco says with a not-so-obvious blush to his cheeks and neck. He rubs the side of his neck, smiling down at the Duna and says, "You're incredible, Harry."
Ron grunted at this new information and Draco just ignored him. He turned his head to look at Blaise, "Ready to face the dark git?" He actually wants to run away, like a normal person would and not face these problems but he knows the Dark Lord can track down certain people, especially himself who has been branded with the Dark Mark. Disgusting tattoo that will stay on his arm forever.
"I know a few but they're muggle games," Harry said, biting his lip at the way Draco was looking at him. Honestly, he could just stay here all afternoon and have those pretty silver eyes staring at him and that handsome face so close to him. It was just him and Draco, alone in this room like nothing else in the world mattered. "Truth or Dare, spin the bottle, Kiss, Marry or Kill, and Never have I ever."
Harry smiled at his boyfriend and he pulled him closer a little. A moment of silence crept over the boys as they walked to class. "Let's hurry," he said and started walking a little faster with Draco in tow. He doesn't exactly want detention. "I don't want us to be late."
Harry nodded at his professor and felt a memory come back to him, an old one to be exact. Harry quickly ran through the corridors, finding someplace he could be alone. Finally, he reached the boy's bathroom, he ran inside and hid in a stall. The memory started coming back to him again, he started breathing heavily and remembered how much the punishments hurt.
Harry was really thinking about this. Does this mean he likes... Draco Malfoy? No. Surely, he doesn't like him. He's a git. How could he like him? How could anybody like him? He's just a fowl mouthed git! But he does have really pretty eyes... A handsome face...
Harry smiled at him, even if he wasn't actually in front of Draco. He was behind the three Slytherin's. He loves trick mirrors; you can literally go anywhere if you know where you're going. He winked at Draco, smiling brighter when Draco's cheeks reddened a little.
Draco blushed and opened his mouth but all that came out were stutters, "I-, I wasn't s-staring!" He smiled at the ground, realizing he and Harry are kind of flirting. He likes it though. "I just notice things..."
Cheeky Bugga's, Harry thought as he snorted at the two twins who winked back at him as he stared at them. It made a familiar heating feeling spread from his neck and up to his face.
Vernon glares Harry's way, knowing it's all Harry's fault for making sweet Mrs Figg act up like this. "I assure you my son has chores too," he told her. "Dudley helps make dinner, does the dishes, and cleans up after himself. He does the backyard, and Harry does the front yard."
"I am thinking of sleeping in Salazar's room, or even Godric's if we find it," Draco said earnestly, smiling slightly at Harry and how he thinks he doesn't believe him. Even he wouldn't believe himself for saying such a thing. But the rooms seem neat, and the cleaning magic still works in the room, so he has a good feeling that there won't be any rats living down there. Or so he hopes. "I just want to sleep as soon as I can."
Ivy nodded. She knew of it too, but Pansy didn't. "He has cuts, scars, memories," she said, frowning just slightly. "He kind of is just like me."
Joslyn sighed. Should have known better than to take him outside of her bedroom where questions would be thrown at her. "He's my friend mum. Mum meet Dra-... David Mallet. David, meet my mother," she said and really waiting for this to be over so she can show Draco the movies.
He felt tears of joy pool up in his eyes. This was far yet the most incredible gift he's ever been given. Underneath the rose was a Certificate of Authentication, meaning that this was real gold the rose was glazed with. Overall, the whole rose was dipped in 24 Karat gold. "Oh, Harry," he says and nearly sobs, he placed his hand over his mouth. On the back of the Certificate of Authentication was a message and he read it: The rose has long been a symbol of love and beauty. It is to the flower world, what gold represents in the realm of precious metals. These two timeless symbols of richness and beauty have been perfectly combined in The Eternity Rose. Your rose has been carefully selected, as its peak of beauty. It is guaranteed to last a lifetime and beyond.
Harry could see his ginger friend's ears and cheeks go red with anger as Draco rudely impersonated his own mother. At least he has a mother, Harry thought to himself sadly with a sniff. One that gives him love and attention, one who feeds him. He began to frown deeper and his shoulders drooped. He felt the need to go somewhere alone and get his little friend out.
Harry hesitated and looked to the floor at that word his godfather had said. Suicide. He wonders what it's like to die, to just... Whatever happens after death, there are many conspiracy theories about if there is an afterlife or if heaven and hell exist.
Harry nodded and stood up also. He gave Cedric a little wave goodbye as he walked back to the Weasley's tent. He knew Ron was probably sleeping already, Hermione was probably reading a book up at this hour. He knew they wouldn't be worried about him, only if he starts acting not like himself which he'll do his best not to.
"Draco Malfoy has officially changed our Harry, hasn't he 'Mione?" Ron asked Hermione with a sigh of dubiety. He fished out a sausage from a tray of Toad-in-the-hole after he had finished off his curried eggs.
Harry decided to not speak of anything else as he knew he made Draco a little provoked. "So, you still want to go to the bedrooms?" he asked just to change the topic back to what Draco wanted. Draco gave a nod, and a strand of his blonde hair falls in his eyes. Harry just wants to push that strand back from those pretty silver eyes... "Which one then? We only know of the Ravenclaw and Hufflepuff bedroom. I'm sure you don't want to go searching for the others this late."
Draco looked over at Ivy. He was startled at the sight of her cuts showing in the candle chandelier light of the common room even though he sees her before. "Ivy?" he asked with concern, tilting his head to the side. "Are you okay?"
Harry and Draco both walked out of the shop, hand in hand. They went back to the Floo in the Leaky Cauldron, grabbed some Floo powder and said, "Defence Against the Dark Arts office, Hogwarts." In two seconds, they were back in the office.
Harry sighed and glanced around the room for anyone that could hear him. He doesn't exactly want to come out now, but he knows Hermione will stay suspicious. "The song that George put on; it just made the dance much more magical," he started blabbering on about the dance instead of coming out to her. Harry smiled and stared down at the floor, watching a white balloon float across the floor where he and Draco once were.
They stay like that for a few more minutes until the drapes around Harry's bed open up like someone had just opened them. But Harry and Draco knew they were cast open by magic, and Ron Weasley and Neville Longbottom appeared at the end of the bed with tired smiles on their faces. The light of the sun immediately shone through Harry's bed and onto the faces of Harry and Draco. The Slytherin groaned and turned over, stuffing his face in Harry's neck, smiling with relief as it blocked out the sun and the best part was being able to smell Harry.
Out of nowhere, Anthony came running around the corner in his Chucky outfit wielding a knife, but he was unidentified as he was wearing a Chucky mask. He grabbed Blaise and stabbed him in the stomach. He squeezed the fake blood packet hard like how Justin told him too.
Once he got inside, he saw many taps and decided to try out all of them and see what happens. Surprisingly, the taps all gave off different effects in the water, as well as different smells and colours. He randomly chose one of the taps and hopped into the bath with a 'splash!' Harry felt his cuts burn under the water and hissed in pain but tried to ignore it as he liked the pain.
"That sounds like a great plan," Draco says with a nod, agreeing with the change of setting and beds. He'd like to have Harry naked on his bed again but this time making love with him for what feels like hours until he comes inside of his boyfriend. He loved the look on Harry's face when he first enters his arse, and when he's coming in him. It's beautiful.
And then Draco leaned up and stared down at this beautiful man underneath him. This beautiful man he's about to make love to and brand as his own. He leaned back down and bit down on that sweet spot he'd found while Harry gasps and bucks his hips up. Even if he tastes blood, he didn't mind and knew Harry was just enjoying it.
