"Yeah," he drawled sarcastically, "because every time one of us just walks right up to the other one out of nowhere and starts accusing them of things, it always ends well, doesn't it?"
Blushing slightly and deciding to change the subject, Harry gestured toward the table. "Did you find anything new?"
His eyes snapped open and he tumbled out of bed, knowing instantly that he was late. Stumbling into the shower, he bruised his knee on the porcelain and banged his head as he fumbled for the soap. He tripped and bruised his other knee attempting to struggle into jeans and was cursing profusely by the time he finally clambered out of the portrait hole. His nerves felt frayed and his stomach was jumping unpleasantly.
At the question, Hermione dropped her gaze, twisting a lock of hair around one finger. "I'm not sure, to tell you the truth," she admitted softly, speaking down to the floor. "But…I think he has a point, about seeing the house in a different light and hopefully getting some sort of closure to the trauma we all suffered there. I think…" she took a deep breath, glancing up at Harry, "I think that if he really is extending an olive branch as he says, then I think that I would at least like to try. I don't want the past to continue to haunt me. And maybe going there will only make the memories worse, but…" she bit her lip, "but maybe going there might just make it better. Maybe it will finally make those memories start to fade."
"Fine, Malfoy," he sighed, finally raising those famous green eyes to meet Draco's own. "I'll talk to the others, tell them about the change of location." He stood abruptly, signaling an end to their horrifying discussion. "I want these attacks stopped. I want this person found." His voice was low and threatening, sending a shudder through Draco, as well as the unexplainable urge to cry. God, he hadn't cried in
!" Draco babbled breathlessly, the words stumbling their way clumsily from between his lips and encouraging Harry to wrap one palm around the base of Draco's shaft, giving it an affectionate squeeze before adding strokes as he continued to suck, attempting to find a good rhythm between his mouth and his hand.
"Draco," he murmurs, and the two syllables dropping from that mouth light a fire in my gut.
"There's another one," Malfoy smirked, "Neither of us has seen each other's bedrooms."
Striding forward, Harry grasped the handles and pushed, gasping at the sight that met him. His very first thought was that the room was bloody enormous. Stepping inside, he gazed around in awe, noting that nearly every wall in the room was made entirely of glass. A huge domed ceiling stretched above their heads, offering an unbroken view of the grey sky above. A single long, gabled hallway stretched to either side of Harry, leading to two other large, separate rooms, and Harry could see that those were constructed from thick glass as well. In the corner, a delicate spiral staircase twisted gracefully up to a second level walkway that edged the outside of the entire main room. A stone fountain lay in the very center, the water still and silent, and Harry wondered if it was meant to be that way or if there had at some point been fish living in it. Blossoming trees and unknown plants spilled around the room, but Harry thought they looked rather sad and drooping for some reason, cast in the dim grey light of an overcast sky. Even the conservatory was darker than Harry had been expecting. Did the sun simply never shine down on this house? Did it never warm the walls with its presence? The thought made Harry shiver unexpectedly, suddenly feeling cold.
With a sinking feeling, Harry nodded. That seemed just the sort of petty thing the man would do. But would he want to draw attention to himself from the Ministry? Especially if Harry's suspicions were correct and he really did have a more-than-questionable background? All he could do was hope Zabini would not press it.
"Lord, how exhausting it must be for you lot to hold simple conversations with people," Harry muttered, spelling the next door open and entering first.
"He's not a fucking mole!" Moles were even worse than bats!
Harry couldn't help but grit his teeth at that, swallowing down the retort he longed to make. "Fine, Malfoy," he ground out. "Just be downstairs with them in the next five minutes. We need to get this shit sorted and find a way out of this fucking house."
"Bottom's up, darling," Pansy smirked, tapping her own glass against Draco's with a sharp sound before throwing it back.
"You know, I think you can have another five points to Slytherin for that," Greg said thoughtfully, stepping close to Blaise and shaking him roughly. "He's like a breathing puppet, isn't he?"
The sound of the stone entrance sliding open drew Harry's attention. Pansy Parkinson stood in the doorway and was currently glaring at Harry as if she wished for nothing more than another Voldemort to rise up just so she could offer Harry up to him again.
The image of Caelix swam immediately to mind—the familiar smile, the piercings, the hair that Harry could spot anywhere, the everyday cheer that Caelix draped around himself like a robe. He could always make Harry smile, always leave him in a better mood just through his proximity alone. They were friends, definitely. But were they more than that? Did Cae really want more than that? Did Harry? He wasn't sure. Did he think of Caelix as anything other than a friend? The man was obviously attractive, Harry could see that. And Harry loved spending time with him. But he loved spending time with Ron, too.
So before we begin the chapter, there are a coupla things that I would like to address real quick:
"I'll stay here too," Ron said, planting himself directly behind Hermione's back.
Harry did not move from that corridor for a very long time.
The words made Harry's chest glow warmly and he tightened his hold on Draco, knowing he could never be close enough to the man who held Harry's heart so effortlessly in the palm of his hand. "Good," he said simply. He hoped the night had been enough to convince Draco to never leave, but even if Draco
"I know," she sighed heavily. "All we can really do is hope that they can somehow bend the rules and speed up the process when they realize that all four of us are missing. And hopefully, by then, some of the others here will have been reported missing as well, so maybe they'll be able to do something about it more quickly than usual."
Draco chuckled as Potter's nose wrinkled, shaking his head firmly. "No, actually, you're right, I take it back, I don't want to know."
Where was Ron?
"You can definitely trust us not to wander off," Zabini said sardonically.
"Does he hurt you?" Tracey asked, reaching past Pansy to offer his arm a gentle squeeze.
"Come on, Malfoy," Harry finally mumbled, shifting closer to wrap one arm around the Slytherin's slim waist. "Let's get you to the Hospital Wing."
"No," he answered immediately. "No, I don't think you're up to anything shady. I just…I dunno why I'm here. I guess I just thought…" Malfoy's fingers twitched underneath his palm.
"Kinky," Draco and Blaise said simultaneously, turning to one another and sniggering.
A teardrop fell without Draco even being aware he had been so close to crying. "I know," he repeated, trying to hold back the sobs. "So did Harry."
"It's not misguided," Harry argued, shifting closer. "I was there, Draco, I
Smirking, Draco curled even closer. "My sweet, shy Harry," he teased.
"Are we, Potter?" Blaise asked curiously, studying Harry with a level of seriousness that Draco was not used to seeing from the dark-skinned boy.
followed
And finally, he told them about the pub.
Feeling restless and impatient, Harry wandered further down the hall away from the other students, pacing slowly down the corridor to the staircase and peering up and down in an attempt to spot Draco. Where was he? He was planning on eating dinner, wasn't he?
"Let's just go find the others," Harry said to them both, offering Draco's shoulder a brief squeeze before shepherding Anthony up the corridor in the direction of the stairs. He heard the others following behind him. Every step he took away from Bellatrix's bedroom made him feel as if he could breathe just a bit easier, and as he walked away, he did not glance back once.
Harry smiled. "Very first person I ever came out to. He outed me to the entire club a week later," Harry paused to chuckle at the memory, "and told them that I was still his son and wouldn't be hiding a thing and that if anyone had a problem with it, they could take it up with him."
She nudged him with her shoulder, laughing again, and he was unable to fight the smile that spread across his own face in response.
With a chalky horror rising in his throat he stepped closer, drawn in by the sight of the grotesque eyeball lying perfectly still and unmoving atop the thick velvet. As he neared, his breath caught sharply, painfully, as he noticed dark green surrounding the pupil, streaked through with hazel specks. Eyes so familiar he could practically feel them boring into his own.
"Oh, right," Pansy sniggered. "Lost all circulation in that leg and ended up having to get it amputated."
As he finally finished his paperwork for the day, he groaned and shook out the aching muscles of his right hand, sore from gripping a quill for so long. He rose from his chair stiffly, rolling his shoulders and cracking his neck as he waited for Ron to join him by the door. The redhead shuffled leisurely across the room, grinning as Harry tapped his foot impatiently.
Despite how adorable Harry was finding a flustered Draco to be, he decided to take pity on the other boy. "I thought it was very sweet," he promised, capturing Malfoy's pouting mouth in a gentle kiss.
"Nothing," Harry muttered, not looking away from Draco as he ignored the restless itch in his spine.
"Ah," Moony frowned. "That is some baggage. And he won't leave him? How serious is it?"
p.s. apologies if I went a bit overboard with the literary references. There were quite a few titles and names I had to force myself to leave off. I could list poets for years without stopping, and no matter how long, the list would never be complete. And like a true addict, I am now sharing my habit with you all :) I promise it all stems from a place of love.
The words made Draco panic. "He's not the only Death Eater here, Seek! Please! You'll only get us both killed!"
"Can't wait," Harry grinned. "But seriously, what animal am I?"
"Nobody?" Ron's voice was sharp. "Are you sure?"
"So maybe you could do that with France," Greg continued. "I bet it would make your mum happy if you went. Unless you want to come back to Germany with me," he grinned widely, "I'm sure your translation spells are much better than mine."
. The boy who had tormented Harry for years, ridiculed him mercilessly, publically humiliated him more times than he could count, and done it all with a fucking
"We've survived worse," Harry pointed out.
Even when the Dark Lord had been living in the Manor, it had not felt like
"Can you identify the bodies, Malfoy?" Ron asked, still frowning at the pile of corpses.
Hermione tsked. "Harry, by tomorrow afternoon the two of you will practically have the entire castle to yourselves. He won't be able to continue avoiding you without everybody else around."
"Misogyny and tit envy noted, Weasley," said Pansy. "Ta for sharing."
That's about it, though! The story in its entirety! I'm super dying to know how many of you called the ending! And now that its finally arrived, after a million kajillion years, I can now finally say that this mischief has officially been managed :)
Why did everyone in the world feel the need to involve themselves in both his and Harry's lives? Why weren't they allowed to date each other like normal people? Why was everyone always trying to make Draco feel even worse about himself? Would he
"Harry…" Draco whispered, unsure what to follow the two syllables with.
"I think you've forgotten how diabolical I am," Draco said breathlessly, at the same moment Harry decided to bend down low enough to suck a wet kiss into the skin of his throat. Harry leaned back up to press his lips against Draco's own, and he wondered if he really was the diabolical one between the two of them.
Glancing at Malfoy caused the sudden memory of the last time he
And now Draco hated himself and Potter was wanting to go public.
"The Tracers just got back," Caelix said, corners of his mouth tugged down. "I heard the details about what happened. Are you…are you okay?"
"What if it really is both of them?" Harry said quietly, trying to ignore the shadows clinging to the edges of the corridor. Lord, was there ever a time of day when there weren't shadows sticking to everything in sight in this house?
A warm hand settled on Harry's shoulder. "It's not your fault, Harry," Pomfrey said in a soft voice, turning him away from Malfoy's bed and leading him to the door at the far side of the room. "It's not your fault. Just keep telling yourself that, all right? It is not your fault."
"He hurt your feelings, Draco!" Blaise explained, shaking his head at the blank looks he was still receiving. "When you were trying to do something nice for him! You were
The fury from earlier returned and Harry sat up without warning, climbing to his feet and beginning to pace angrily around the dorm. "No, actually, we won't get it sorted. 'Cos the stupid insecure prat has decided it would just be easier if we weren't together at all. Because god forbid anybody should find us about us, right? Because literally nothing in the whole world could be worse than the school finding out about the two of us! He'll let me suck him off in broom cupboards but god fucking forbid I even
Picking up the nearest utensil, he stabbed moodily at his breakfast, wishing it was still the weekend. He had not seen Harry since their fight, spending nearly the entire weekend locked away in his dorm down in the dungeons, wishing he could fall from the world simply by willing it. He couldn't help but wonder how Potter had passed the time. Had he spent it thinking about Draco? Had he spent it in the company of his Gryffindor sidekicks? Or—Draco's stomach twisted at the thought—had he spent it in the arms of Ginevra?
He was brought back into the moment by a gentle squeeze on his nape. "Draco," Seek whispered, sounding agonized, "what does he do to you? Why are you with him?"
"I got a letter," Goyle glanced around uneasily. "It was…weird. I thought maybe I should come back. And then when I got here, Mum said that you'd spoken to her not too long ago asking about me. So I decided I'd better come here to see you." He glanced around the conservatory as if speaking specifically about that particular room.
They all seemed to hold their breath as they waited, the silence feeling tense and hanging heavy in the air as nothing happened. Nothing zoomed toward Hermione, nothing slapped into her hand; Harry could not even hear anything approaching.
"I bet you wouldn't think it was so funny if
The sound of heavy footsteps clomping down the stairs interrupted their rare bubble of privacy. One of the prospects rounded the corner, frowning at the three of them huddled on the sofa. His blue eyes flashed at the sight of them cuddled up to one another.
Hermione frowned as she thought it over. "I'm not sure," she confessed. "I suppose it's worth a try, but I honestly am not sure if it will actually yield any results."
"Blaise is the one far more likely to resort to getting sucked off in broom cupboards," Draco pointed out, still blushing, "we all know how desperate he is."
"Don't forget this," Harry broke off the kiss to plead haltingly. "Tomorrow, I mean. Just…don't forget this moment. Don't forget
Waving in agreement, he kicked off into the air, gritting his teeth against the ache in his shoulder and glancing back down at the stands. Blaise looked slightly less comfortable at suddenly finding himself alone in the company of his fellow Housemates. Harry watched with amusement as Draco advanced on the dark-skinned teen menacingly—he would never understand the mercurial friendships of the Slytherins.
. He did not know how to process any of what had happened in the last twenty-four hours. He did not even know where to begin.
Harry sat up more fully, raising one eyebrow at Hermione as he waited for her to realize that he still had the working use of all his limbs.
The girls exchanged a weighted glance.
"Of course not," Draco glared at the newspaper on the table. "That paper and all its articles are evil. And libelous. And probably mean."
"But what do I say?" How did he fix this? What words existed that would right everything that had become so horribly skewed? How did he get his boyfriend and his happiness back?
"He has no idea," Harry said heavily. "He was unconscious when we found him, and he says he can't remember anything."
"Mind if I come in, Malfoy?" He gazed around the large doorframe pointedly and Draco stepped aside silently to allow him entrance.
The words echoed through the empty house, accompanied by a deafening crack of thunder.
Just like the thought of Wolf hurting Draco.
"It's absolutely a real word!" Granger snapped.
"All but Death, can be Adjusted"—Emily Dickinson
"But you missed us desperately and found yourself often waking in the night after having dreamt of us and the laughter we once shared?" Blaise guessed, trying for his usual casual sarcasm and failing.
"Draaaco? Hellooo?" a voice called, and Draco's head snapped around to find Pansy and Blaise both smirking at him. "Oh, look at that, he finally heard me," Pansy drawled, and Draco flushed.
"Hi, Potter," Draco greeted shyly, coming to a halt less than an arm span away from the other boy.
? But Draco never got Valentine's cards! Other than Pansy's hopeless attempts at seduction when they were younger, of course.
thought of you as such." His tone implied that he thought Harry really very stupid for not understanding what was so clearly a simple concept. "Your eyes are perfectly green and your hair is perfectly black and your skin is perfectly perfect," he continued in a sing-song voice. "You're perfect, Harry." His head bent forward and his lips ghosted over the skin of Harry's jaw, who was standing stock-still in a frozen daze.
As they all pulled their chairs to sit down, Harry used this opportunity to come closer to Draco and whisper in his ear, “I heard your music playing back there. Were you giving them a show? Think I can have one tonight too?”
Draco opened his mouth to say a sweet yes but instead, “No.” he croaked.
The ring was beautiful platinum with glittering emeralds adorning it. It was simple yet breath-taking.
Harry gave him a flirtatious smile and walked away to shoo everyone out of their house.
“Uh, yes.” Draco said when he finally found his voice, “Everything’s fine, love. You can go back.”
“WHAT? No! No, you won’t Malfoy. I won’t allow it.” Weasley stood up to dash out of the room but Neville caught him with incredible speed that he didn’t know Neville possessed.
The sound of Neville spitting his drink out filled the uncomfortable silence that fell on the room, followed by Blaise gasping and laughing so hard he almost fell off the couch.
pair of the same sneakers last week? The ones that costed 200 Galleons? Each time?”
“Yes, shit.” Draco gritted out.
Harry looked beyond confused. Draco felt bad, really bad to be doing this to him when in reality he wanted to scream
Pansy thought about it for a minute but ultimately agreed, much to Draco’s relief. He wanted a break from hosting all these dinners and cleaning up the house the next day.
“Draco,” Harry’s voice brought him out of his daze and only then did he notice that Harry’s eyes were wet and his hands shaking, “will you marry me?”
Harry dropped the box in surprise and looked at him. Draco tried to speak in strong voice which was proving hard once he had to look at his soon-to-be-fiancé’s bloodshot and slightly puffy eyes.
“Oh simple,” she had that horrible look in her eyes again, “you just have to give Weasley a hard on in under 10 minutes by giving him a lap dance.”
Harry was so used to the people he loved being taken away from him that he had developed a separation anxiety of sorts. He would get restless if he didn’t know that his closet friends were alive and healthy every other day. Which usually resulted in them having to host a dinner or lunch every weekend. But Draco thought it was adorable, really. Though he’d never admit it.
Harry turned away and went to set up the table. Draco glared at the sniggering figures behind him, flipped them off and went to help his boyfriend anyway. Idiots.
“So, darling, you’ve lost. Now for the next two hours that we’re here, you will deny every request that Potter makes and no one in this room is allowed to tell him that in any way. Understood?” Pansy looked at everyone and swished her wand to cast the spell once everyone nodded.
Around one hour into the spell, Harry stood from his chair and raised his glass to make a toast. Draco looked up at him in confusion. Harry rarely ever made a toast and only when he was feeling exceptionally emotional. He hadn’t seemed any different to Draco these past few days though.
“Granger will you please go and see if Harry’s alright?” she got up immediately and went upstairs, “And you lot, are going to clean this table up for remaining of, “Draco checked the time, “the next 38 minutes while I decide how to clean up your mess.”
“That’s your ring, you git.” Harry chuckled, wiping his nose on his sleeve.
Harry and Hermione came rushing to the living, worry in their eyes. “Is everything alright?” Harry asked.
That’s where he had met Harry all those years ago after the war. At a strip club where he gave Harry a lap dance to remember and well, the rest is history. His stripper and pole dancing skills definitely made the sex much,
"And you gave Ron a lap dance?"
“You mean to tell me, you rejected me because of a bet?” he spoke slowly as if he couldn’t believe what he was asking.
Harry chose that exact moment to come into the room and stood near the doorway. “Draco, could you help me set the table?” he asked him lovingly.
Harry drew in a deep breath and closed his eyes. He looked tired as if he didn’t have the energy to deal with this.
truth to it Draco.” She said hesitantly.
“Now calm down Weasley.” Draco gently pushed him to sit on the sofa again. “No need to be such a prude, it’ll be over before you now it.” He said gently yet with a hint of seductiveness to his voice. Draco had entered his stripper headspace and everyone knew that there was no stopping him now. Even Weasley.
“Well put it on my finger then Potter.” He pulled the ring out of the box and placed it in Harry’s palm. “I’m self-absorbed, you say so yourself. I’m proposing on your behalf. You knew exactly what you were getting yourself into when you bought this. There’s no going back now.”
“Oh please,” Blaise scoffed.
“How about that private show you asked for earlier?”
Scenes from what could happen later that night came rushing to him and as he opened his mouth to reply back just as seductively but all he could muster up to say was, “No.”
Harry looked like someone had punched the life out of him and Draco was sure he looked the same. He whipped his head towards Pansy when he heard her say, “Shit.”
He turned around to face him now and he could hear him audibly swallow. Draco place his hands on Weasley’s shoulders and bucked his hips off his lap to perform a little dance, swaying his hips to the music then coming back to the job at hand. He was eternally grateful that both Harry and Hermione were in the kitchen right now or else a trip to St. Mungo’s was sure to happen.
“Come on mate, it’s just a bet.” He tried to reason with him.
Harry held him so tightly he couldn’t breathe but he didn’t care. All he knew was that he was in the arms of the man he loved endlessly. They pulled back and kissed each other as if they’re life depended on it. It proved to be a pointless effort since neither of them could stop the grin spreading on their lips.
“Perfect.” Draco replied and lifted Harry’s hand to place a gentle kiss on his knuckles, then proceeding to mouth a soft ‘I love you’ to him, just to ease the sting of having to say no. Harry visibly relaxed and muttered a tender ‘I love you too’.
. But to no avail.
“Draco,” he placed a hand over Draco’s quivering ones, “it’s alright. Really. I love you, no matter what. I’ll just put this back in the drawer ok?”
“Oh, darling but it is.” Pansy retorts sweetly.
He massaged his temples and went over his explanation that he would be giving Harry later and mentally prepared himself for the punch that he would likely receive. He didn’t realise that he had fallen asleep till Neville shook his shoulders and whispered, “Mate, the spells over.”
more enjoyable, not that anyone had to know.
“Fine lets settle this with a bet,” Pansy proposed, “if you win, we will never mention this again and we’ll be in agreement with you but if we win, “ she had a mischievous glint in her eyes that Draco simply did not like, “we cast a spell where you have to say no to him, no matter what.he.says.”
Draco admired the sight of his boyfriend blushing in embarrassment. He knew how much Harry valued all of them and tried to let them know the best he could and Draco loved him for that.
He tried helping, he really did but the blasted spell wouldn’t let him. Harry looked at him in confusion as he tried to force his hand to pick up a plate but chose not to comment on it. They called everyone to the dinner table and started serving the plates.
“Fine.” Draco agreed without thinking too much of it, he was going to win anyway, “But if I win, the next dinner is at your place Parkinson.”
Granger rolled her eyes and went back to the kitchen to help his boyfriend. So maybe it was true that was a softie when it came to Harry but he dared anyone to say no to that bastard once he gets his innocent puppy-like face on.
Harry visibly flinched at that and Draco immediately felt horrible seeing his face fall.
“So, what do I have to do?” he asked.
“I’ll do it.”
They walked downstairs, hand in hand, and stopped in the living room where an angry Hermione was hitting Ron with a cushion and the rest of them just looked anxious. Harry cleared his throat to get their attention and were immediately met by worried eyes.
He sat down on the sofa in the living room and restlessly waited for time to pass. He couldn’t even imagine how Harry must be feeling right now. True it was a surprise that he had asked him to marry at all but that didn’t mean Draco wanted to marry him any less.
“And obviously, this man here,” he continued, turning to Draco, “Draco, you’re the best thing that happened to me. If I could go back in time, I would force 11-year-old Harry to shake your hand. Ok maybe not but I really can’t imagine a life where I don’t love you.” Draco tried to look away. Even after six years of dating, he still couldn’t take Harry’s declaration of love without squirming.
“As much as I hate to agree with this cow here, “Weasley sighs,” she’s right mate.”
Draco felt Harry stand up from his positing, looking down and fiddling with the almost black box. Draco’s heart shattered to pieces upon seeing the broken expression on his partner’s face.
“Tell them they’re wrong.” Draco demanded.
“Oh, and Ron, you’re not my best man anymore.” Harry called out though only Draco could see his amused smile.
Or maybe Draco just loved him too much, but that’s beside the point.
“Nothing’s ever going to be easy with you is it?”
As the commotion grew about who’s fault it was, Harry pulled Draco flush against his chest and nuzzled against his neck, placing feather like kisses along the way.
“You still have to make up for breaking my heart.” Harry smiled against his lips.
"No," he managed to croak. "You hate me." The light kisses being placed on Harry's neck and jaw did not pause.
Weasley flushed angrily, muttering something beneath his breath.
And that is the end! This little tale of woe of ours has come to an ending at last! I hope nobody was disappointed by it! This story was actually written because of my own personal disgust regarding the legality of love potions in the original HP books and the way they seemed to be made light of. It's basically romanticized GHB, and I don't understand why they were never outlawed in the novels. It's something that has bothered me for years.
"Honestly?" Harry sighed. "No, I don't. If it really is Stephen, then he's been too clever so far to have put himself in such an obvious situation. Most likely, that's not the only door he's sealed shut. If he was smart, he wouldn't lock the door to whatever room he's hiding in."
"Just promise you won't start following him again, at least," Ron sighed.
"Oh, right." Harry had completely forgotten about the Parish case. The Parishes were a couple living just outside of Chelsea that had experienced two recent break-in's, the latter of which had resulted in the husband's confrontation with one of the burglars, ending in a trip to St. Mungo's, as well as the evasion of the crooks. As far as Harry knew the man would be all right, but he had been in hospital for several days now.
This is mostly just an optional
, would ever be stupid enough to openly threaten the three of them.
"And now it's over." His statement is oddly flat in comparison to the anger flashing in his impossibly green eyes. Green eyes framed by shaggy ebony hair—hair that seems to crackle in his fury.
Blaise's lips twitched as Pansy tried to disguise a laugh as a cough. "Goddamnit, Potter, ten points to you," Blaise said reluctantly, finally allowing his grin to break through.
Draco shrugged. "Because you were the only one who hadn't had it thrown at them yet."
"Very funny," Harry groaned. He knew he talked in his sleep. How many times had Ginny teased him for it in the past? "Fuck. What did I say?"
A loud sigh escaped Harry as he rolled his eyes. "You still haven't even told me what I'm meant to be showing you."
"He's here, Seek," Draco whispered, glancing around to make sure Fenrir wasn't already somehow sneaking up on him. "You can't come here,
"All right, we need to talk about something else," he said desperately. He had no desire to discuss the man that had been in love with his mother—pining after her his entire bloody life, for Christ's sake—and whether or not that same man had been
Flopping into my chair, I give in to the temptation to heave yet another drawn out sigh as I pull the stack of parchment and a quill toward me, knowing that until I finish this paperwork, I am unable to call it a day.
But his next words made Draco relax and even brought a ghostly smile to his face. "If you want Potter or Zabini beaten up at any time, for any reason, Draco, you know where to find me."
Malfoy's eyes narrowed. "You listen here, Potter, I will play you one-on-one anytime. Seeker's game, you and me. Anytime you like."
"Of course you can, sweetie," Blaise said with pouted lips, smiling patronizingly as he reached out to pat her hand.
Shoving everything into a large rucksack, he let Kreacher know where he would be and promised to call the elf if he needed anything. Harry wasn't sure if the Manor's wards would allow him to Floo straight there, but he decided he may as well try before attempting the trek from the drive to the front door that accompanied Apparition. Tossing a handful of glittering powder into the flames, he stepped through and called out for Malfoy Manor.
At the thought of the blond, Harry lit up again. Ron quickly caught the good mood and was cracking jokes and leaving Harry gasping for breath by the time they met up with Hermione in the Common Room. She laughed alongside them on their way to the Great Hall and as they ate breakfast, and for the first time in so long—entire centuries, really—Harry felt as though he really did have his friends back.
Malfoy didn't respond, remaining perfectly still as they gazed at one another in growing silence.
"Er, yes and no," Harry answered hesitantly. "But I can't really talk about it."
"Deal," Harry smiled widely, looking as though Draco had offered him the moon and stars on a plate or the chance to have had a better childhood or a cure for global suffering or something else completely impossible and miraculous. He sat up to rip the shirt over his head before tossing it somewhere in the room, a breathless noise escaping him as Draco reached up to trail two trembling hands over his chest. "God, it's almost too good having you touch me," the Gryffindor admitted in a low voice, and Draco couldn't help but smirk.
Malfoy looked amused but hopped down from the sill, gesturing for Harry to lead the way. The walk back was mostly quiet, excepting the occasional hushed comment passed between them. He walked the Slytherin as far as the second floor, parting company at the suit of armor shielding his belongings.
The loud rummaging sounded again, and Draco followed the noise, keeping as quiet as he could. The sound seemed to be coming from one of the large garages on the property, the ones where the members worked on the bikes and kept a few cars and pick-up trucks in.
more mature than you! You're practically a toddler compared to me! Hermione, tell him how mature I am."
"I mean I'm stuck," Draco groaned, sounding frustrated, and Harry couldn't help but smile to himself. He barely knew Draco and yet he had missed the sound of his voice. "My car is dead, and I have no idea what the fuck is wrong with it."
"It really does say all that, you know," Harry said softly. "Blaise wasn't lying."
"You what?" I breathe, hardly daring to hope.
"You're the one who made me use it," Draco told him, a small smile lighting up his face at the feeling of Harry's fingers raking over his scalp.
"Oh." For a moment, Dean looked disappointed. "Well, did you find Rhys?"
"It's all right, Weasley," he accepted warily. "I'm sorry as well, for…well…you know, just sorry." Ron nodded again and released his grip on Malfoy, who then turned to Hermione and opened his mouth, but she raised a hand palm-out to silence him.
Draco finally stopped retching and Pibby vanished the bucket with a snap of his fingers. Malfoy sat between Zabini and Harry, crying quietly, head bowed nearly to the floor.
"I love you, Harry." Draco gazed at him for several seconds, smiling a tiny, sad smile, before suddenly turning away and sprinting toward the open window.
"Well," Wisp began, copying Draco and taking a much larger swallow, "he's been receiving visitors. One visitor, actually. For nearly the past six months, at least once a fortnight, he receives a single visitor, according to the log one usually has to sign when visiting someone in Azkaban." His words were accompanied by a wide grin, letting Draco know that Wisp was one of the ones for whom that rule did not apply.
"Don't let Zed hear you say that," Wire chuckled through a mouthful of eggs. "Or her. He'll try to fight you and she'll try to cast a spell on you."
Right?
"I said stay away from me!" And without waiting for a reply, Harry turned and all but fled, not slowing until he was safely back in his dorm, hidden from the entire confusing, insane world behind his crimson bed curtains. Curling into a ball, Harry raised a trembling hand to his mouth, tracing his lips with shocked fingers. He had no idea what to make of any of what had just happened and was desperately hoping it had all been some fevered dream his brain had cooked up in a temporary fit of insanity.
"Knew what?" Harry asked, feeling curious despite not wanting to get sidetracked, but Malfoy's answer made him wish he had never asked.
"I dunno," she mused, tapping her chin in thought. "In my mind, that made a lot more sense."
"He thinks he's sexy like a cheetah," Draco rolled his eyes, finally unsticking his feet from the floor and allowing the others to continue walking, falling into step beside Potter once more.
Draco hopped off the desk and took a few steps closer, looking concerned. "Which shoulder?" he asked as he steered Harry into a chair.
"Nothing," Draco said tensely, now feeling embarrassment settle on top of his already confusing swirl of emotion that had somehow become unburied. Why weren't they still buried? They were supposed to be buried!
They lay together afterward in a tangled heap, warm and relaxed and content, Draco's head on Harry's shoulder and his body draped diagonally across his entire torso.
"What are you doing here?" he asked automatically, sending another quick prayer of thanks to the God he didn't believe in that he had already washed every trace of Seek off himself.
"Why do you even want me to speak to him?" Harry huffed in exasperation. "You don't even like him! And you've been pushing Cae on me and making all those comments and innuendos about the two of us! I thought you wanted me to be with Cae? I thought you liked him!"
"Never have I ever kissed someone just to make another person jealous," Potter said suddenly, grinning as Granger threw back another shot with a glare. He started laughing as Weasley tossed back a shot as well, followed by Pansy.
it, a deep void pit like an empty grave come to swallow them all whole, a yawning chasm of nothingness they would surely all tumble into one-by-one as it slowly devoured them, all lost forever in its cavernous depths. The dangerous energy that was raising the hairs along the back of his neck was radiating out from it, spilling filth and Darkness throughout his home like pooling blood still spilling from the body of a fresh corpse, staining everything it touched with oily fingers the color of ashen wine. But what was it? It seemed to be nothing but empty space, horrifying and hollow, just an onyx blemish of spilled ink instead of the brightly-colored spark Draco should be seeing.
"I thought I was Harry now?" Harry grinned, shaking his head in amusement at Draco's tantrum and somehow adorable pouting.
"Hi," the other boy breathed.
Draco narrowed his eyes in anger. How dare someone do that to Harry! "What a bitch," he said calmly, rubbing Harry's shoulder with one hand. "I hope you hexed her away from you. And then kept hexing her. And then never stopped hexing her. Actually, I hope you're still hexing her right now."
"Gross, Malfoy!" Weasley complained, nose wrinkling.
"No, you didn't," Harry agreed with a wry smile.
Draco chuckled. "I definitely will." God, just the thought of Seek's hands on him made Draco's heart beat faster and his fingers tremble with excitement.
"I'm sorry," Harry offered, knowing it was a hollow, useless platitude that did nothing to comfort in the face of grief; he had heard the two words often enough in his life to know how empty they really were, and how little it actually helped anything to hear them.
So far, it had been the best start to a morning he'd had in what felt like years.
Draco's first reaction was to deny having any such feelings, before remembering that he really did have those feelings and that he had professed them only moments earlier, and so denying them now would only serve to make him look a bit mental. "I dunno," he muttered, wondering if his face would ever stop being on fire. He honestly wasn't sure how much more embarrassment he could cope with before keeling over or combusting or fleeing the country or something else horrific that he did not want to do.
"Even if it's as a ghost," Draco smirked.
"Is someone telling everyone that your knob is a sad tiny Hufflepuff?" Blaise continued, earning a snicker from Pansy.
Morgue hummed, burying his face in Pansy's dark hair as his hands started to wander up and down her thighs. "But just imagine you and Trace together…"
him touching me—" His words broke off as a heavy sob wrenched its way free from his pained throat, another reminder of what had happened earlier with Fenrir making his words choke off.
He couldn't help but fidget in his seat, twirling a quill between his fingers as his other hand fiddled anxiously with the ends of his long hair. Potter should be arriving at the dungeons any second now. What would happen when he took the seat next to Draco? Would they speak? Would they sit in the same silence that had shrouded them throughout every Potions lesson since the beginning of their forced partnership? Would they acknowledge what had happened, or choose to ignore it? Would Potter smile at him, or glare? Had Potter perhaps already forgotten their shared kiss or did he wish to discuss it? Would Draco's heart beat its way free from his chest before the Gryffindor even had time to enter the room? His heart was hammering so hard he felt nearly faint and he glanced around himself, wondering if the other students could hear it as well over the low buzz of idle chatter. Keeping his gaze fixed on the desktop, Draco attempted to calm himself, drawing deep breaths and holding the air in his lungs for long seconds before releasing it with a quiet exhalation.
A sudden yelp split the air, startling Draco and surprising him even further when he realized it had come from him. With no sort of warning whatsoever, Harry had reached down and wrapped both hands around the backs of Draco's thighs before yanking sharply and lifting both legs at the knee. Before he had time to even be surprised, the floor beneath his feet was gone and he was finding himself suddenly held up in mid-air, still trapped with his back against the wall and with no other option but to wrap his legs tightly around Potter's waist.
"But they do seem to have adequate hearing, so that's a point in their favor, I suppose," Blaise allowed, and Harry snorted again.
Harry shrugged again, but more out of discomfort than anything. A hand reached up to rake through his hair and he sighed. "Yeah, well…I know that," he muttered, yanking on the longer hairs curled around the base of his neck. "But I just—I mean, I-I can't…not with her…anymore…" Why did Malfoy always bring out the stammering, idiotic version of himself?
Draco breathed, but Harry wasn't finished.
"That's sick," Harry repeated, trying to ignore the nausea churning his stomach. He could not imagine ever being forced to marry for something as awful as family politics as opposed to love.
Draco’s heart pounded. “Merlin,” he breathed. “I’ll be damned.” He turned to Harry. “I think she’s done it.”
“Yes, it is.”
“After all they’d done, my parents deserved what they got. They deserved more, frankly. They would have done it all again, if they were given the chance, and they would have done everything they could to create that chance.”
He nods. “Yeah. Do it.” It’s breathy and uneven, but he looks at me with such fire. “Fuck me, Malfoy.”
“Now they do, but before. Do you know where they went?”
“I thought you weren’t sure?”
“How is your vision?”
“No! No, Master Draco is… is… is a scientist, and is much more handsome—”
He made it back to his flat partially through force of habit. And though it wasn’t habit, something similarly instinctual drove him to the Floo. He knelt on the heart and called for Millie and Blaise’s.
“It was meant to go to your home if it couldn’t get you at work.”
The tension that built between Harry and Draco at McGonagall’s departure was interrupted by a thunderclap. They all jumped, and Hermione picked up where the headmistress had left off, casting several charms and turning to them. “Right then. We’ve reviewed the ritual and established as many safety precautions as possible. I’ll be in the library and have spare supplies if you need anything.” She patted a well-worn beaded bag. “If you need to send a Patronus to McGonagall, you’d better send one to me, too. Though at this point, nothing should go wrong. We’ve run through all the possibilities, and –“
“Thanks?” Potter’s still glazed over. Draco resists the urge to kick him.
“Magically?”
Potter flailed his legs, trying, with much futility, to right himself. “Thought you were a Muggle now.”
“Bespoke, Potter. The Huntsman house style. Hammick still does mine himself, and he’s both understanding and discreet. Had a wizard in the family, Hogwarts ‘63.” He cuffed a sleeve, revealing a sliver of fine green silk and the very tip of a wand. “He understood.”
“Crime is down 18%.”
My housemates may be less immediately amenable. They may be less amenable, full stop. But the silence isn’t too hard to withstand compared to Pansy’s bragging and posturing and screeching. And they are still Slytherins. They’ll come around to Harry Potter’s boyfriend even if they’re unhappy with me. And Pansy isn’t the only Slytherin. Blaise won’t hold it against me, and I’ve never really got to know the sixth and seventh years. Pansy can pout all she wants.
"'I suppose that's for me to know,'" Harry began, repeating Malfoy’s words back to him.
“You can do what you’re good at?” Potter turned to face him, backing away all the while. “You can keep doing exactly what you like and call it something else?”
Besides which, a quieter voice added, he would have believed him, then. Five hours and several lifetimes ago.
He nods. “Yeah.”
He moved anyway. Found himself just as eager to make more of them as he was to hear the first few. He stepped around to meet Potter’s eye, to rake a thumbnail over his chest, over a nipple, down, down, until he tucked his thumb into Potter’s waistband. With his free hand, he tilted Potter’s chin up towards him, and leaned in to nip at Potter’s bottom lip.
“Through your seventeen layers of wards?”
Harry nodded, extending his legs. He leaned back on his elbows. “I want to see you.”
“The drinks, obviously.” Draco’s lips were threatening a proper smile. “It will be quite perilous, you realise.”
“Yes, I’d gathered,” Potter said, trailing his teeth up the side of Draco’s neck. “Or hadn’t you noticed?”
Neither Potter’s proximity nor his vehemence stands a chance of selling me on that particular idea. It’s love, not dragon pox. They may be equally dangerous, but the former is hardly as contagious as the latter.
Harry jumps, stumbling over the untidy pile next to him.
* * *
Draco is still wondering about the usefulness of fear when he knocks on the door to 12 Grimmauld at 5 to 8 the next evening. Even with a lengthy afternoon nap, he’s vibrating with exhaustion. And excitement. And terror. And the strength of a resolution made in the middle of the night to, if he can’t be properly fearless, at least be properly fearful. To do whatever makes him most afraid.
Draco takes a step back. “Please. I’m fine without Quidditch.”
He seemed to teeter on the brink of asking, going so far as to open his mouth before closing it again and shaking his head.
“Mmm.”
He was glad he had come down early when he found seven place settings instead of the expected four.
“Merlin,” Draco breathed, and Harry felt the head of Draco’s cock come to rest against his hole.
“I know a place,” Draco said. “How do you feel about Apparating?”
“Yes, well,” Draco smiled. “When you’re on the go, needs must.”
She may’ve caught me staring. It was hard to stay focused in the face of that barely visible white line on the inner curve of her left breast, remnants of Goldstein’s impressively loud ejaculation.
She almost giggled. “I thought his jugular was going to explode at the bit about Ministry policies.”
“Merlin help me, Mill. I do.”
He’d’ve been an idiot not to look, and eventually he did, just for a second. Then blushed, of course, the naïf. He almost yelled his, “Of course not!” before he began mumbling to himself, calling himself an idiot. A new point of agreement between us.
. Trying not to think about how good Draco Malfoy made him feel, or how hard he’d come, or how much he wants it to happen again. Trying to think, instead, about those nice girls he’s supposed to end up with, who would never tie him to a shelf and suck him dry. Thinking about whether it’s their girlness or their niceness that leaves him wanting. Deciding that it doesn’t really matter, because when he thinks about nice boys and not-nice girls, none of them make him instantly hard the way his irrepressible, Draco-related daydreams do. None of them, not even his own made up fantasy people, are as interesting as Draco Malfoy.
“Draco.”
He’d always liked the blue rooms, though. Had thought them adult, stately without being as stuffy as some of the others. And now, more like his own flat; blues, whites, oak and mahogany. Nothing that looked as though it ever could’ve belonged in the Slytherin common room.
Draco watched him fidget through the first minute. He dug his thumbnails into the pads of his fingers, wiggled his toes. After a time, his shoulders relaxed. One corner of his mouth turned up.
“What do you mean?”
It still smells like wet streets, and now there’s sweat and come at the back of your throat and it’s not why you came here, it’s not what you come for and it’s all too much and
“The what?” Draco looked over, alarmed. “Muggle what?”
!” This time the outline of a stag appeared and took a few steps before it dissolved.
Draco laughs again. “Yes. Merlin, Harry. Yes.”
“Figure of speech.”
“Interesting choice of cover.”
Potter squeezes his arm and pulls a card with their two names from his pocket. He hands it to the herald and assumes his place at the landing as though this is second nature to him.
“Tell –” I realise what he means and am rather glad he can’t see my smile. “Of course. I’ll tell you. Just relax.”
Draco paused, and neatly lifted his tongs and fork from the table, balancing a snail shell neatly between them. “I imagine you’re telling me this… anecdote because you’ve heard the Department of Mysteries is expanding its work on Animagi.”
“Some things never change, do they?”
“Yeah. An unfortunate accident.”
It happened as Lee turned up the volume. His phone glowed. The lock screen read: Harry, and underneath it, the message:
’s favourite recluse. We could–We could pretend to be dating. If we showed up together we’d make the front page, guaranteed, and they wouldn’t dare write anything against me.”
“None who have had such a prolonged stay in a void, and with so few breaks.”
“My honour, Auror Robards.” He swallowed back the hint of bile that rose in his throat as he forced deference. “When do we begin?”
- Official crime reports
For all his focus, he almost missed Potter’s approach.
“Three.”
“Objectionably so?”
Why that ostentations Hallows replica gets her any credibility I’ll never know. Except, of course, I do; they’re all too foolish, too swept up in their saviour’s epic heroism, to think twice about it. Of
Draco nodded. “All right. Then give me time.”
“I’m no less worried about what it would say.”
“Not that one. You broke that one, and I’m not usually the one doing the healing. Use the other.”
“Please fuck you?” Draco murmurs, beginning to rut against his leg.
“Okay,” he said slowly. “Terms that have long included a promise that you and Greg can stay here. Have I ever made a point of breaking my promises?”
“No, it doesn’t,” Draco agrees. “But I do have some perspective on the matter. Really, Harry.” He inhales and lets it out slowly. “During the war, how many times—what would you have given to be fine? Just fine? To know everyone you loved was fine.”
Draco nodded. “I’ll have the elves come get the rest, and you can have more if you’d like.”
“All feedback on the performance of The Vanishing Department should be directed to the Wizengamot.” Draco steps aside. “The next item is a teak writing desk, mid-twentieth century. This design is influenced by Muggle trends, making it an unlikely candidate unless it’s a recent acquisition.”
Potter waited.
“I don’t know that it is. But it’s not a conversation I’ll want to have after… well.”
“No, it’s not the same thing. And no, I’m not seeing anyone.”
“Okay. Well. Could I maybe have an answer?”
“Oh.” Potter frowns, lifting the guitar strap off his neck. “Do we have to?”
He wonders if there’s more to be made of the photos. Potter’s got a pathologically overdeveloped sense of honour, and the press really didn’t turn out as well as it was meant to have done. Maybe Potter could be persuaded that it’s only right to go to another ball together, to try again.
“Is that a request?”
Not that it matters, particularly because, as he walks past Section G, he realises that Potter’s no longer visible from this distance. He must be doing it, then. Going through all those things .
“Yeah, true. We’re not, though.”
“Are you going to tell us what’s actually going on?”
“Why’s that?” The question is directed to his clavicle, and goosebumps spring up where my breath leaves its mark.
“Touch yourself,” I manage, just barely.
“And Pansy,” Blaise retorted, “has no appreciation for the avant-garde. We’d have to resign ourselves to spending long evenings on the overstuffed chintz dustrags she tries to pass off as antiques, bickering about the comparative propriety of various alcohols while you rot in a cell in Azkaban.”
“Then we reconsider the alternatives,” Croaker said.
Draco narrowed his eyes. “Shacklebolt?”
“We don’t have to talk about it.”
“It’ll stop though. Promise. It’ll feel so good when you’re ready for it. So full, so good.
“Yeah.”
There’s an unmistakeable hint of hopefulness in Harry’s voice, and he turns his head back slowly. “Other things?”
“I think you overestimate my oral powers.”
Harry smiled at him nervously. “So how do we—? Do we—?” He gestured towards the bed.
“And how far does that offer extend?”
D. F. E.
“Oh?” Draco sat back in his chair, hands folded on his stomach. “Sticking the Elder Wand inside of someone might cause a problem? I’m shocked, thoroughly shocked, to hear that that.”
“Not if you have any interest in getting Potter back.”
“For…?” Harry starts, but won’t quite finish the sentence.
“But it wasn’t you.”
“Fine. Any other incidents of unexplained magical outbursts from, near, in, related to him, in any way?”
“We have, what, two or three nights left?” I could hear the panic rising in my voice, unresponsive to my efforts to quell it. “And that’s it. And then what?”
Her glare didn’t have any bite. She pressed her lips together in mock disapproval, though he didn’t miss the way they turned up at the corners. “Suppose I owe you one or two. Go.”
“Photos, murmurings. How would you characterise the relationship between them?”
“Fine. Vibrators.”
Draco watched him carefully until he caught his breath. “How are you feeling?”
In his periphery, the edges of the discarded parchment sparked and smouldered but didn’t catch. He cast at the fire, and was overwhelmed by the wave of heat that came from the hearth. The room had grown cold, and he hadn’t even realised. He looked up at the clock and was surprised by the hour. The array of sketches in front of him seemed to confirm how much time had passed. He’d have to go to sleep, soon.
“Ever done anything that didn’t end with you coming so hard you saw stars?”
“But I don’t recognise it.”
“You’re not going to spend the entire day wrinkling things, either.”
“He’s not going to drive you out. It’s not his house or his choice to make.”
“No,” Harry said. “I don’t want to end like that.”
“Draco,” Millie warned.
“Trust me,” I interrupt. “It’s like nothing you’ve ever felt before.”
Harry nodded. “Okay.” He inhaled. Held it.
I adore him. Even in his fumbling attempts at imitating some combination of the Weasley matriarch, the headmistress, and the school nurse, he’s thoroughly charming. He’s so entirely sincere about it. There’s no coolness about him, no pretense. Oftentimes the opposite. There’ve been a fair few rows, though there’s little for me to say other than, “I’m sorry.” When he’s annoyed with my stubbornness, it shows through. Or, it doesn’t even show through, he just tells me it’s the case and to shut up and take the potions. It’s not especially Slytherin of me to transparently obey, but I still haven’t sorted an answer to his question about whether I want to be especially Slytherin. It wasn’t a bad question though. His acuity continues to surprise me, if not as much as it once did.
Harry’s heart felt as though it might break his rib cage. Blood raced through his ears. “I—” He stopped.
Draco had rarely spoken so quickly. There was only so much he could say on the Floo, and he wasn’t about to share his speculation on all the particulars of Potter’s repressed feelings, but the outline of his theory poured out of him, as did the story of their walk. When he finished, Granger was almost as breathless as he was.
At last, he’d managed,
“Right now?” Harry looked weary.
If Potter was unhappy about the suggestion, he didn’t show it. Just opened his eyes, nodded, and walked towards the open door to his sitting room.
Draco shakes his head to clear it. When he turns around Potter’s still on one knee, looking up at him expectantly, and he almost chokes at the images that come to him, none of which he can afford to entertain. “What?”
“Yes, Master Draco, sir?”
Harry shifts from one foot to the other and back again while Draco takes it in. “Do you—what’d’you think?”
“Yes.” Harry looked as though he was struggling to relax.
Draco considers. Harry’s awash in relief. If he’s managed to save this he’ll remember to throw a sickle in the Ministry fountain next time he’s there. “A particularly memorable one comes to mind.”
He did not expect Potter to drop to his knees.
Potter stiffened, as his fingers ventured further.
He fists Harry’s robes and pulls him backwards as they kiss, until his calves hit the storage chest at the foot of the bed. He almost stumbles; Harry catches him.
“I have to go.” He takes a step backwards, and then another. “I’m just – I don’t want to, to get you sick. So. I’m going to – I have to go. I’ll see you Tuesday. I’ll – I’ll see you then.”
He tried to settle in to the library with a nightcap and come up with a plan. Potter’s test results were ominous, but they were also overdue. Potter should’ve shown signs of magical atrophy much sooner. His symptoms still weren’t as severe as they probably should have been, but any loss of ability so close to the surgery was inauspicious. And if that was Potter’s performance with the Elder Wand implanted, Draco could take a guess as to how he would fare without it.
Shocked, Harry laughed and relaxed against the pillows. “When you put it that way.”
“Er.”
“I’m gonna fill you,” I whisper.
You can leave a comment here or on
Draco raised an eyebrow.
I kissed him again, pushing him back until I was straddling him, able to kiss his neck and follow the trail of his jawline, to feel him arch up towards me. I wedged my knees between his, then, and pushed his legs apart, rolling my hips into his erection, feeling his moan as much as I heard it. He began to buck up into me, seeking the friction of our bodies together.
“Obviously. But isn’t it worth considering, now that we know?”
“Yes.”
The tomatoes could do nicely. Not the first time someone had tried to Vanish an “heirloom” and sent the bowl along with the tomatoes. They’ve begun to liquefy and he can imagine the wet splattering sound they’ll make when they’re blown to pieces by the impact. If only he could throw them at the walls and see the results for himself.
“The implants don’t need to, and usually don’t, come from the original wandmaker. You must have known that.”
You know what to do with him. Your hands know, at least, and you’ve come to try to trust them. They move.
Draco refuses to look at him, aiming his wand at an ornate armoire instead. He lifts it and sets it down in the few feet between them, blocking Potter and his stupid boots and his stupid jeans and his stupid hair from view.
That this will destroy my reputation. As though my reputation is anything worth saving.
“Hobbies? Club memberships?”
Retorts floated to the surface alongside Harry. Something about the sofa, or the temperature. He could say any of those things and put Malfoy back where he made sense.
“Bait?” Draco couldn’t help the quickness of his response this time. “Beg pardon?”
Harry bends forward and the tip of Harry’s tongue skates over Draco’s clothed erection so lightly he can barely feel it. He comes up with a hungry smile. “Think I just need you to remind me.”
– On the continent. Wouldn’t know, wrong circles.
There was another funny word. As though Draco had one. The closest thing he’d have was the next minute or two to think on his feet. “What safety precautions will you have in place?”
“Your shoes. They’re covered in mud and leaves. You’ll leave tracks all over the department and I don’t fancy cleaning them up. Shoes off.”
“Familial, friendship?”
“Yes.”
“Mr. Potter, did you really obtain your NEWTS without learning how to cast an adequate
Draco closed his eyes. It was the only way he had any hope of thinking clearly. “Fuck me,” he said.
But first, he reached for the book.
As Potter stands there, his usual fumbling, gaping mess – albeit in a very nice, probably post-coitally borrowed jumper – Draco feels his last nerve begin to fray.
“It’s not for me to say.”
“Ugh.” Harry turned his head back into the pillow. “Right.”
“If you lived down the block, maybe. But as it is, if you’re asking me to think about rearranging my life in such a significant way, I’d like to be more intentional about it.”
It is 8:57am on a Wednesday, not quite community service hour 7,280 of 10,000, and Draco is already done with this day.
“Can we just do this together?”
“Pretty sure. Robards recognised the picture and and said it was a match to the name on the card. And we know of a few people he’s worked with before. We need their records too.”
Blissful like Potter’s mouth against his own. Blissful like Potter’s plump bottom lip between his teeth. Like Potter moaning against his mouth.
“For all involved.” Weasley looked back at him, refusing to give.
“A no-strings-attached arrangement with a Malfoy was always suspicious.”
She didn’t. “Not quite.”
. I’ve read
“Please,” Harry exhales. “Please, show me.”
Potter repeats it. “I did. I tried. I asked. I fucking
Malfoy quirked a brow and dropped his voice to a low purr. "You know perfectly well, Potter, that there's nothing boyish about me."
Turning on his heel, Draco strides towards the next section, coming to a stop in front of wardrobes and bureaus.
“Yes.”
“Pardon?” Malfoy’s levitating each pair of boots to the middle of the aisle, making a neat row behind him.
At last, Harry loosened his arms and she stepped back, smiling through tears. He reached onto the tea tray for a napkin and gave it to her to blot her eyes. She rubbed his arm and said something else, then stepped back.
He opens his mouth to speak. Draco knows what he’s going to say, can see it on his face – and when did he learn that face so well? – but he can’t hear it. He doesn’t have an answer for that question.
“I did?” Harry followed Malfoy’s gaze to the cut crystal decanter on the sideboard between Malfoy’s bookshelves. “Oh. I did.”
“I’ve wanted a lot of things over the years. They don’t always pan out.”
He studies my face, won’t quite meet my eye. “No,” he replies. “No, I don’t think so.”
“Thank you, darling. Do say goodnight before you leave, would you? If I’m still here, that is.” With a polite smile, she swept towards the front of the room.
“I’m right and you don’t want to admit it.”
“Discuss it? Not going to tell me what to do?”
“No. You don’t have to.”
“I’m sorry about that.”
She raised an eyebrow. “The silent auction? It’s just a few autographed books.”
“Might’ve yes. But not other things.”
He can see the hint of a smile as Harry goes digging in the pile behind him, coming up with another Firebolt and mounting it. “Ready?”
Croaker looked hungrier than a man within arm’s reach of an untouched tea tray had any right to look. “That his power could be like nothing we’ve ever seen.”
“Why?” Potter asked, shoulders tense. “Why ask for anything–for that–if it was that easy?”
He tried to keep his breathing even, but it was an uphill battle.
?" He paused. "And here I didn't think your body was big enough to accommodate any more ego."
“Out of the question!” Weasley’s yammering resolved into indignance.
“But you’ll be going back to Paris?” Millie asked.
After another moment, Malfoy cleared his throat. When he spoke, his voice was throaty and low. "Didn't know you could go that long without talking."
Draco’s heart ached. “You were perfect.” He reached out a hand for Harry’s cheek and Harry let him, turning his head at the last minute to kiss Draco’s palm. It felt like it shot through his arm, carried through his ulna and radius and humerus, straight to his heart. Magic in reverse.
He was two hours in, thoroughly immersed in the case of a Muggle-born witch whose double exposure to chickenpox and dragon pox had led to a drug-resistant, magically debilitating case of Shingles, and thinking of calling Amina in, when the Floo went off.
Quietly, he gathered his drawings into a tidy stack, running his thumb over the edges as he walked towards the kitchen. He’d been at it for hours; he needed a nightcap, and so, a tumbler. He shoved the pile of parchment into an empty drawer near the relevant cupboard, jamming them back as they caught on the edge, and left the room, glass in hand, to walk towards the bar and the glow of a roaring fire.
“Fine,” Harry half-snapped. And then, immediately, “Sorry. Bit nervous, actually.”
“Yes, in other ways.” He sighs. “You may not always see it, but my work does make me happy in its own way. I have been pursuing social occasions more frequently, as you well know.  You make me happy, and not only during the hours and hours of rapturous fucking.”
“Of course not!” Granger yelled, shoving her chair back and rising to her feet. “Of
“So?”
He’s surprised to discover the raw hoarseness in his throat. He hopes his nod will suffice.
Jealousy crashes over Draco, blood pounding in his ears. He had been right, then. There is someone. He squeezes his eyes shut and tries, silently, to regain his breath. He can’t reveal himself, not now.
“If I move in the night, you’ll feel it.”
Malfoy pulls a stack of forms from under the counter and turns to page B-16. Harry recognises his own handwriting on the page, but his focus is on Malfoy’s finger, which is pointing at a tiny, light grey line at the bottom of the page. “There.”
Draco blinked, surprised. She hadn’t ever seemed inclined to, except to goad Harry and Granger. “Do you want to?”
“You did. You certainly knew. You thought this was my idea of a promising career? It’s bloody community service, you incomparable arsehole. Ten thousand hours of it. Moving forward? Starting a career? There is no choice for me. I live in that bloody haunted Manor, I spend every weekday in Subbasement D, and I do it, all of it, because
At one point in his life, Harry had seen Malfoy so often that he had become a bit like the wallpaper. Or like a tear in the wallpaper—troublesome and a reminder that things were out of sorts, but so much a part of daily life that it began to fade into the background.
Draco’s heart betrayed him every time Potter fell asleep first. Which was to say, every time they did this. It was just that the only time Potter looked anything close to peaceful was when he slept, and Draco couldn’t help but look.
And of course Potter would be a talker, of course he would be as expressive in this moment as he is in the midst of a fight.
He hunched deeper into his collar and walked on.
It was more thrilling than Draco cared to admit. “Didn’t realise you knew much of anything about good manners. Or perhaps caring about them is simply beneath you? That must be the case, if all you can think to ask is whether you can escape your loathsome, onerous evening of standing around eating crudités amongst Britain’s most well-regarded artists.”
Dubiously, Potter cast
Watching Draco fade from view had carved a hollow in Harry’s chest, and as Luna spoke it seemed to fill with lead.
He had a plan, he reminded himself. He would find out what Malfoy had meant, exactly. Forearmed was forewarned.
Potter’s suddenly too busy studying the floor to reply.
“Draco,” she warned. “Watch yourself. And please disabuse yourself of the mistaken notion that observers of certain human behaviours are less knowledgeable than the participants. In my experience, it’s generally the opposite.”
“Okay.” Draco perched on the edge of a seat.
“I didn’t.”
It was well into the wee hours by the time Harry got home. Far too late to Floo anyone, and he had work in the morning besides.
I lied, of course. “It was wonderful. It’s so good to meet new sorts of people, to really understand how they live.”
Draco obliged. He kissed the head of Harry’s prick, sliding his lips, and Harry’s foreskin, down the glans to take the head of his cock in his mouth.
He pauses. “That doesn’t mean anything. Certainly doesn’t make it any more possible now than it was then.”
Harry followed a long sip with a long breath. “Never planned to. I don’t know about the other.”
“You too, Potter?”
Late at night, alone, he sometimes still wondered.
“Well, how lovely for you.”
Draco’s jaw dropped. He had to consciously remind himself to close it. “What? You… What?” He shook his head. “You’ll excuse me, I hope, if I have a hard time imagining it happening as plainly as you’ve said it.”
“Yes. And if nothing else, it’s a better fit than anything else we’ve got.”
“Okay.” Harry said. “It’s June, probably. Sunny, but not too sunny.” He opened his eyes. “I don’t know how to do this.”
Draco turned, arms folded across his ribs. “I won’t work with anyone who doesn’t trust my judgement, including my ability to evaluate what parts of a case require discretion. If Ms Granger is suggesting that I would reveal information about a high-profile patient—about
Harry leans forward to examine them. “Er, Maybe? There were a lot of pairs of old boots.”
“Do I? Rather like it’s unfair to come to a person’s place of business and start throwing them up against the shelving? Or staring at them too intently to focus on your own work?”
Potter’s face was a question.
“And take it home like that?” There’s a note of panic in Potter’s voice.
Potter nodded. He stared at it in his hand, turning his wrist to see the bite mark on one side and the unblemished skin on the other. After a long examination, he lifted it to his mouth and took a bite so small Draco almost laughed, though he stopped himself.
“Good morning.” Draco is composed. Clear. Exactly as intended. “Welcome to the Vanishing Department. How may we help you?”
He let everything slip away but the sound of Harry’s gasps, and the taste of him, and the warm arch of Harry’s hipbones under his thumbs. He had no sense of time, or of anything save this, until Harry moved his hand to Draco’s face, caressing his cheek and then running fingers through Draco’s hair.
“Of course. I would expect no less.”
Malfoy lifts the stack, preparing to file it away, and looks down to align the edges. It’s just an instant, but Harry knows there has to be some way to do this that doesn’t involve six weeks, nineteen owls, three Sickles and an unnaturally calm Malfoy, and his instincts have always served him well.
“No.”
And beyond all those things, there will be flying, for which Madame Pomfrey gave the all-clear if I wait till after Christmas. More of Harry’s quite decent breakfasts. Perhaps – I think definitely, if his response to the kisses we’ve been able to steal are any indication – there’ll be another attempt at going to bed together.
His fingers flexed against mine, and it served to draw me out of my head, thankfully. I returned his grip and then released it, moving to the hem of my jumper and pulling it over my head, barely managing to stay straight-backed between a chill in the room and his scrutiny as I turned towards him. There was nothing critical about it. Interest, yes, and curiosity. Attraction. He ran a hand down my arm and I couldn’t suppress a shiver. I don’t think it could’ve occurred to him to use that tell to his advantage. Instead, he just barely smiled at it and doffed his own top, dropping it on top of mine behind us.
And might've stayed longer if not for the sudden, clipped, "
“They’re not all—” Harry stopped halfway through.
Potter turned confused, questioning eyes to Granger and Draco in turn.
Potter shook his head incredulously. “Unbelievable. Bloody unbelievable.”
“Sort of.”
“More?” Draco asked.
* * *
Potter’s eyebrow falls back into place, as does his implacability.
“I’ve checked pretty thoroughly.”
He paused. “It hasn’t. Though that particular detail was supposed to escape yours.”
He reaches up for the buttons of Draco’s robes again. Stills when hesitation crosses Draco’s face. He won’t lose Draco now, can’t stand the idea of seeing him slip behind his professional façade again.
Draco tried to feign calm. “The practise of keeping them at the Manor also dates to Brutus Malfoy. So, since the mid-1600s. Not these particular ones, of course—”
Resentment tightened Draco’s chest. He would not let Potter make a fool of him. “Over, Potter, not on.”
Luna patted his shoulder gently. “If it gets to be a bit too much, you can always come visit the Humdingers. Just remember a Shield Charm. Better safe than sorry!”
Harry’s indignance is cut off by a sharp stare. He bites his tongue. Literally, unfortunately, but it keeps him quiet and he’s glad of that when Draco continues on.
“Funny how you didn’t mention any of this until after I upended my entire life.”
“Er.” Harry drops his hand, shaking droplets all over the floor.
She barked a laugh and then promptly clapped her hand over her mouth. “Don’t mean to make light! Of course, Harry, you must.”
“Draco?”
“Malfoy?”
He buries his head in his arm, hoping to hide the flush that’s creeping over his face.
Draco does shudder, and he moans. He can’t help it, not even if he hates himself for it, instantly and vehemently. It doesn’t stop him from tilting his head to give Potter better access, nor does it stop him from grabbing for Potter’s arse.
He plumps the pillows. Wonders if Malfoy’s celebrating. A dinner, perhaps. Something with his mother. It’s not as though the two of them have the sort of arrangement where you owl ahead.
He walks into the warehouse silently. He wouldn’t want to distract Potter with the door or his footsteps. Not that Potter would even notice, given the way he walks. Though he’s considerably quieter in those brogues, which really do look quite charming with that jumper.
“Your request,
“Ah,” Millie asked, gentling her voice. “And you? Do you want to?”
Draco turned and narrowed his eyes. “Did you know that their primary interest is in getting you up and running in time to go raise some money?”
Harry sat back on his haunches when Malfoy hissed and pulled his hips away. "Sensitive?"
“If that’s the case,” Pansy interrupts, “why would we need to ask him?”
,” Malfoy whisper-yelled. “Now!”
When he opened his eyes, Potter was looking back at him. Potter, with one cheek flushed where he’d rested it against Draco’s shoulder. Potter, with his curious green eyes. His low, creaky voice saying, “Morning.”
Draco had given Potter a bit of a wider berth than would usually be reserved for a single patient: a suite of rooms encompassing a sitting room, exam room, and private bedroom and en suite. He’d had the hallway outside included too. Better safe than sorry, and it gave visitors a chance to get their blanching and protestations over with outside of the patient’s view. And indeed, Millie looked less like a ghost and Granger less like she was about to give in to seasickness by the time they reached the door of the sitting room.
“Around the grounds?”
There was a room with more blobs, and maybe it was his own distraction, or that they seemed so flat compared to the room, but Harry didn’t know how so many artists could be so preoccupied with painting lumps and splatters. There was a room with more blobby statues. The idea of carving the blobs seemed even more absurd to Harry than did the idea of painting them. A room full of pictures that seemed like they were supposed to be visual puns caught his attention for a while, but he couldn’t help feeling a bit furtive about it; he was pretty sure that fine art wasn’t meant to be taken as a dirty joke.
Hopefully, too, you’ll be up and about by then. It’s not just because of those reasons. We haven’t really been flying together since things all started to sour, and I miss facing off against you. No one keeps me on my toes like you do. And I wouldn’t mind showing you how to stain those sanded planks. It’d be pretty funny. You should still do it, though. I’d like it if you did. Like to have another weekend with you. So maybe, when I do give this back, you could consider it an invitation?
“Even if you weren’t full of shite, you miss the larger picture: I don’t care.”
“For Circe’s sake, are you really so concerned? We had a spot of dinner.” It sounded smooth enough, but Draco’s stomach curdled at the lie. “The hyperactive gossip columns got ahold of it, as they’re wont to do when Potter so much as sneezes in public, and exaggerated terribly, as they’re wont to do every time they set ink to parchment. As you both know perfectly well.”
“You’re incredible, really. I never thought anyone would find it again, but Merlin,” she gasps, “and it feels just like it did before.”
After, by Draco’s watch, ten minutes, the breeze picked up, and Harry’s breathing with it. The cat, looking quite disgruntled, hunkered into a corner of the settee, pulling her kittens in towards her. Draco tensed, preparing to intervene.
Compared to the previous morning’s eagerness, Draco’s trepidation about going to see Potter was especially noticeable. He took an unusually long time over his breakfast tray, even though he managed all of a slice of toast and cup of tea. He spent a truly unnecessary amount of time dressing, particularly given that he wound up in work robes as always. He even found himself walking slowly, which he wanted to blame on a hangover even though he’d only had a drink and a half over the course of the night, which couldn’t explain why his feet felt leaden, or his stomach sour. That was all down to his intense desire to avoid Potter.
Stupid of me. I know that. Of course I know that. Hard
He shakes his head.
“In a manner of speaking,” Millie added.
He stood and crossed the edge of the circle, and the candles were all extinguished.
“Yes. It sounds exactly right.”
Potter’s impatience disappeared in a flash. He looked up. “Serious.”
Shakily, Harry hooked a finger over Draco’s belt. “Would you? Before?”
“I’m not. What won’t they let go?”
“Yes,” Harry replies. He nods and repeats the word. “Yes.” He drops Draco’s hand to step through the Floo.
“Is it a pleasant sensation, or an unpleasant sensation?”
“Scared?”
“I’m 28.”
I slip a knee into the space between his calves. Rest my hands on the backs of his legs. Rake my nails up his thighs.
“You thought I would actually risk something?”
“Flying.” Draco’s smile is half invitation, half challenge.
His resolve almost fails him. Potter’s eyes are that brilliant about-to-cry green again and, with the jumper, the effect is otherworldly. Particularly since his eyes are red-rimmed. Complementary colours, Draco thinks. Potter looks dishevelled in all the best ways, like the kind of man who’s just been properly got off, the kind of thick-cocked man who doesn’t want to walk away without knowing he’s pleased his partner. The fool. As if self-sacrifice hasn’t cost him enough already.
“If you’d like.”
“Don’t get your fingers inside me that way.”
Draco blew past him, barely hearing the words. “You know,
Draco knows it doesn’t. It couldn’t. He’s still himself, Potter’s still Potter, and they’ve got ten years of antipathy to add to the already-long list of reasons why it can’t work. For Pansy to even suggest otherwise is insanity. She may be able to read a calendar, but that’s hardly an argument.
“Has Potter attempted to make another appointment?
She cleared her throat. “The problem was with the Wand, not with Harry’s magic, as was the case with your patients. The Wand was only unsafe when it was away from him, and we needed a way to keep it near him that was completely and reliably hidden from the public. No holsters or anything like that, anything that could be dislodged in a fight or detected in a fight, or if, Merlin forbid, he was captured. The Wand was satisfied being close to Harry, and his magic was stable. There was no reason to think there would be this kind of adverse reaction.”
Harry stops to think about it. “Yeah.”
Draco shifted, sat up, meaning to slide out from under Harry and dress before waking him, but the movement was enough to make him stir. He sat up groggily. “Hmm?”
“I suppose. Do we get to talk about my work next?”
That’s when I saw it; every mark he’d left on me echoed on his own skin. His chest ran with sweat and pigment. Dyes pooled at his follicles, streaked across his nipples, the blue handprint he’d left on my arse transplanted to his hipbone.
“You met with him.”
"How do you know you've retrieved the right files?"
Shortly thereafter, I found what eluded even the Dark Pillock: a limit to Potter’s reckless bravery.
“Still stubborn. Myopic.” He began to walk, coming up behind Potter one slow step at a time. “Willing to cut off your nose to spite your face. Determined to play the martyr. Determined to
“Among other things.”
“The first.”
I worked him between my finger and mouth, then, letting him rock into each sensation and trying to keep up a rhythm. I stopped when he did, but it was only to ask me for more.
Draco wrapped an arm around Harry and pulled him in, tipping them back so they fell, Harry’s weight on top of him. Harry scrambled for balance, bracing one knee on the edge of the mattress and the other against the frame, which left him kneeling over Draco.
“And it is?”
Fuck. Harry’s stomach drops. He’s been so wrapped up in figuring out what to do about the bell that he hadn’t heard anything. Or maybe Draco’s just really quiet. Come to think of it, he
Harry Potter, the Ministry’s Golden Boy, brush in hand, defacing public property, and it was bloody glorious.
Potter looked at him beseechingly.
“That is a considerably more familiar circumstance.”
Thinks back to the years that followed. The nights he’d Apparated to Grimmauld Place, only to turn around and leave again. Waiting for owls that never came on the 31st day, and the 32nd, and the 40th. The excursions to Muggle bars and bathhouses. The number of times he’d fucked men he came close enough to loathing in search of that spark, and failed to find it. The backwards realisation that there had to have been more than loathing there, even from the start, with him and Potter. The even worse and even more backwards realisation that he had already known that. The emptiness of his bed ever since. The emptiness of the Manor after his parents left for France. The realisation that running the
“It’s because they think I can turn him into a superweapon, which I wouldn’t do even if I could. The rest is highly speculative.”
He reaches around, resting a finger on the lowermost button on Draco’s robes.
“And then to enter the Great Hall.” He sighed, a bit dreamily. “To become part of one of four great houses, to join a lineage that has bound us together for a millennia? The honour of that!”
Draco shifted and nudged him. “Harry?”
“I—” Malfoy began. “Yes. It—it matters a lot, some days. Maybe that’s selfish too.”
“Hearing?”
His legs are long. Harry had guessed that. He’s got a bit of an arse, too. More than Harry had thought, though maybe it’s the thickness of the fabric. His shoulders are more substantial than they had been when Harry thought about it. Not broad by any means, but strong-looking.
