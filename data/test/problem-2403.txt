"Of course, David. Make sure to share some with Steve this time. I know you ate his slice yesterday," Lily scolded, hands on her hips and in full view of the front window so that the men could see her disapproving figure through their omnioculars.
Listeners, that's not a question I can answer for you. But if you're having trouble figuring out who you are, the Unspeakables have assured me that given the time and appropriate resources, they can help you figure out what you are made of — physically, at least — for no charge at all. And sometimes, that's what matters. Our physical form, because that is the conduit through which we experience everything around us.
Well, I'm sure some of the listeners out there may have also just found themselves a significant other with which to share their lives with and I would like to congratulate those of you who have done so. That said, I'm absolutely certain that whoever you managed to scrounge up wouldn’t be able to hold a candle to [BEEP!]. Does your lover [BEEP!] and [BEEP!] while tugging onto your [BEEP!] just a little too hard, well not too hard, just enough to make it a bit difficult to breathe and for your head to go light and to make the [BEEP!] just that much better. I bet they don't, because they're not [BEEP!]. [BEEP!] is perfect in every way, even the way that he likes to bite me wherever he can reach and leave all those lovely little marks near my [BEEP!] and [BEEP!]. I don't mind. Even if it does always look like I just got ganged up on by a flock in Knockturn Alley. But all the blood is very much still in my veins, though they tend to hang around in my [BEEP!] most of the time these days.
"Oh that would be lovely," Draco said, voice gone soft and breathy and Harry wasn't too embarrassed to admit that his body definitely reacted to that.
"You look amazing," Draco breathed out, eyes raking over him greedily and Harry couldn't help but preen at the attention.
Now, it seems that this [BEEP!] appeared in Godric's Hollow where he met up with [BEEP!], [BEEP!], [BEEP!], and [BEEP!]. If you'll recall, the existence of those four individuals was reported by Old Lady Bagshot some months back, before our illustrious reptilian overlord took the time out of his very busy schedule to personally deny their existence and remind us that anyone who acknowledged their existence would be sent for re-education in the dog park. Well, it seems this new individual is now staying at the home of the four people that most definitely do not exist.
Harry heard the sigh over the receiver.
Once they all separated, allowing Harry to gather himself and dry the tears that had welled in his eyes, James stepped towards the fireplace.
"I never did get a chance to have a kid back home, so I'll welcome this opportunity," Lily said, voice soft and gentle and everything Harry had imagined back when he was a child dreaming of such things.
"He actually completely destroyed it. Did away with prisons entirely. That's when he came up with the idea for the re-education camps."
After a rather short transit, in which he had to close his eyes due to the way the flashing lights of colors speeding past triggered a painful migraine, he was unceremoniously dumped on the hard ground outside. With a groan, Harry sat up and took in his surroundings.
Now you may be asking yourselves, "how are you sure about that, Draco? Maybe I had a spectacular week that blew yours out of the water? You don't know me". And that's where I'll have to remind you that you may not know me but I do know you. Of course I only know you the way that you exist in the eyes of your Ministry assigned Aurors and how their individual brains choose to interpret what they see and hear from your homes as you go about your lives before condensing it all down into a weekly report that they submit to the Ministry. Those reports don't tell me how you feel (unless you're the type to actually talk about that kind of stuff, and if that's you, then congratulations. That's wonderful). The reports don't contain the version of you as you perceive yourself.
[A sigh is heard as Draco trails off]
You also know this. And yet...
When he figured he was as prepared as he could stand to be, he lined himself up and slowly allowed himself to take Draco inside him. As he slowly inched down, feeling that cock stretching him open each step of the way, he realized that it was even better than he had expected and that was wonderful. Once he was fully seated, he looked up at Draco and felt himself melt as he saw the way the other man tried to stay still and allow Harry to dictate the pace.
As the door closed behind him, Harry heard James call out, "Hey Pads, stop closing the curtains! You know Steve can't see in otherwise!" James turned back to Harry to explain that Steve was the man in the tent that had spoken to Harry, before moving over to said window and pulling the curtains back. When Harry looked outside, he saw the man — Steve — give him a thumbs up and Harry reflexively returned the gesture with a small smile.
There was the arch, with the flapping fabric which taunted him once more before going oddly still, and the crumbled stone remains of old destroyed buildings littered around the area and — oh yeah, the conglomeration of towering hooded figures rapidly approaching him.
"Huh." Harry honestly didn't know how to feel about that. On the one hand — the destruction of Azkaban was great. On the other hand, it was Voldemort that did it. And he suspected the re-education camps could qualify as cruel and unusual punishment which (if Harry remembered correctly) were against human rights or something.
To the friends and family of intern Mira: I am deeply sorry for your loss. Know that Mira was an asset to this radio show and that even though she always made my coffee wrong and was kind of a downer what with all the trembling and screaming and crying, she still pulled her weight around here and I want you to know that she will be dearly missed here at our little community radio show.
But none of that mattered at the moment, because Harry had a date with Draco Malfoy tomorrow and he honestly couldn't wait to meet this new Draco that he didn't have any weird baggage with.
Now, it seems that — oh dear. I don't know how I'm supposed to relay this next part. Hmm. Well, I suppose we'll just have to bleep out the portions that are supposed to be redacted.
To the friends of family of intern Logan: he was a much treasured member of the team and his presence and work ethic will be missed. Might I also suggest a closed casket funeral? I don't suppose the Unspeakables are going to be able to contain their excitement enough to try and preserve Logan's general frame.
Our illustrious reptilian overlord, Lord Voldemort, leads our Vague Yet Menacing Government in controlling — I mean leading — the citizens of Wizarding Britain. The Ministry of Magic is not a part of the Vague Yet Menacing Government — as they are far from vague and are only vaguely menacing.
"Of course, of course. Want to come in?" James asked and Harry followed him into the house, shocked that it had been that easy. No questions, no suspicion, no door slammed into his face after relaying the message; not exactly how he expected this to go when he originally accepted the task.
"Um, this is embarrassing. But I didn't quite catch all of that. Would you guys mind moving closer to the microphone and repeating the last 2 minutes worth so that I can properly transcribe it?" Harry looked at his new family in alarm, wondering what to make of the fact that the house was apparently bugged and that someone had been listening to everything that they had said.
"H-Harry!" He heard the echo from the wireless still playing in the background and briefly thought about silencing it but then remembered that broadcast from ages ago in which Malfoy himself had warned against that exact action and so aborted that plan and decided to put up with it for the time being.
Harry didn't really have a destination in mind when he had disapparated, but he was thankful all the same that there was a Godric's Hollow in this strange land and that his magic had been clever enough to take him there. Walking along the cobblestone paths, he was starting to appreciate just how strange this new land was — and he was absolutely sure that he was in another universe, because while everything looked vaguely familiar, there were some very odd differences. Like the fact that there were tents pitched outside of each house in this village, a pair of omnioculars peeking through the flaps and aimed at the front windows which all strangely had their curtains pulled back, allowing an unobstructed view to the strange voyeurs.
It is because of my eyes, this physical structure that allows me to process information visually, that I was able to see for myself just how thick and lustrous our new resident's hair really was. And listeners, the pictures and descriptions do not do it justice. There's just so much of it, and it's so tempting, to sink your hands in it and tug and find out if it's as soft as it looks.
"I'm everywhere, at once. People tend to forget about me, they always did even when I was alive. But now I can steal a sock here, a hair tie there, or stick a spider on someone's face while they're sleeping (Ron shuddered as she aimed that last remark at him, because of course she saw the way he had rolled his eyes, she had eyes in the back of her head as he really should have known). Sometimes I'll trip them down the stairs, make their coffee a little too hot, hide their keys, slash their tires, message their ex while they're off taking a shower. You know, little things to get back at them." Myrtle rattled off, causing Harry to feel increasingly worried about this new Myrtle that had the freedom that his confined-to-an-abandoned-bathroom one hadn't. Quite frankly, it was terrifying.
Which reminds me, if you have attempted to silence your wireless or otherwise tried to get out of this obligation, know that representatives from the Auror Department will soon be knocking on your door to bring you into custody as that is a federal offense.
So now, Harry was lounging in his bedroom, one sleepy thestral curled up beside him, half-heartedly nibbling on the apple in Harry's hand whenever he roused from his nap.
"So," Harry said, turning back to his new family (which now also included Albus Dumbledore and his lover Gellert Grindelwald who had stopped by just after the morning howl — which was something that Harry only vaguely remembered as he had been pulled along half-asleep by a too excited Sirius and Remus to take part in the obligatory morning ritual) and ignoring the suggestive grins sent his way.
And sometimes when venturing out to Diagon Alley, Harry would get lost and end up in the barista quarter and have to quickly find shelter before he could get caught up in the turf wars between the snarling werewolf packs that inhabited the area.
Somehow they managed to make it to the bed, any remaining articles of clothing stripped quickly and urgently until they could only feel bare skin sliding against another. Harry took control quickly, pushing Draco facedown into the mattress and positioning him with his knees bent and spread, back bent and that beautiful pert arse tempting him.
All the figures were a bit too tall, a bit too fast, and a bit too interested in Harry. So he made the only sensible decision all day and disapparated before they could close the rapidly diminishing distance between them.
"What happened?" Harry asked, curious as to what prevented those items to be spared the non-existent designation.
"Harry." Harry responded, not even thinking to lie.
I am now being slipped a piece of paper by station management pleading with me to stop talking about my perfect boyfriend and how much I loved it when he [BEEP!] me all night last night until I was incoherent. They say that it's not a suitable topic for a mandatory government broadcast as little children have been forced to hear my redacted, but still entirely too inappropriate spiel.
"Yeah, me and Lils were the first to stumble in. We were fighting Voldemort in the Ministry of Magic back in our dimension and somehow got pushed through the veil and ended up here." James explained, moving to take the seat beside his wife.
"How'd you know that about Draco anyways?" Harry asked, as he angled himself so that he was half hidden behind Ginny (who was not amused at being used as a shield and threw him a dirty look and made sure to grind the heel of her foot on his exposed toes).
Harry raised an eyebrow as he listened to the voice that most definitely belonged to a version of Draco Malfoy gush over his photo on a government mandated radio broadcast.
As I leave you now, in the middle of all this chaos, I hope you can find your own little slice of joy in this clusterfuck of a world we live in.
He had even accepted that the public libraries (which were a delightful addition to Wizarding society in Harry's opinion) were now staffed with banshees rallied under the ruthless leadership of the Grey Lady who now went by Charlotte. Of course, now the punishments for late book returns and property damage were more deadly, but overall the fact that Magical London even had a public library at all was considered an improvement.
Sirius helped him get dressed, even letting Harry borrow his beloved leather jacket, while Remus dabbed some of his own cologne in specific locations on Harry's skin — only mumbling that less was more and that placement was everything. James, Merlin bless him, actually slipped a mortified Harry a packet of condoms and some lube, and Lily made him take a commemorative photo. He knew that everyone in that room fully expected that he would be fucking Draco that night (or the opposite, which was what Harry was secretly hoping for) and wouldn't be returning until the next morning and it was so embarrassing. But it also made him feel so warm inside, in a very fuzzy and familial way, knowing that he got to go through this experience with these people even if they weren't his original family.
"No hiding that, I'm afraid," said Sirius, who was not his godfather, with a laugh. "Though you are rather short. Most Potters like to tower."
Harry knew his face was so bright and red that it could give any of the Weasley children a run for their money and that was not something any member of said family was used to — so known for their particular shade of red as they were.
"Your place. Please. Too many people at mine," Harry whispered, as he pulled Draco in close, enjoying the way he could rest his head on Draco's chest while the blonde nodded and apparated them straight into the bedroom.
In other, more light hearted news: guess who has a boyfriend?! That's right, me!
"Wow, Harrikins," One of the twins said. Harry thought it might be Fred because Fred tended to hand out annoying pet names like candy on Halloween. "I never noticed, but I guess it's true." He finished, which was something different about the Weasley twins of this dimension — they tended to finish their own sentences, instead of going for the back and forth his own twins reveled in.
But you already knew that.
"I get your ass next time," he muttered, only faintly registering the chuckle from Draco before they both fell asleep.
"Hey kid. We see you're going up to our house here." The man that was speaking to him was wearing a fox mask — though this was obviously a mask, however attractive, and nothing like the uncanny animal faces on those hooded figures in the park he had first appeared in.
"Hey, Draco," Harry purred, because he had spent day after day listening to the way that Draco talked about him and at least was confident that his attentions would very much be welcome.
But never mind you. I want to talk about me, because as soon as I finished my morning howl, I came into the studio this morning only to find out that station management was requesting a meeting. Anyone who has been listening to this show for long — which is all of you, because you don't really have any other choice now do you? — knows that station management prefers to keep to themselves and rarely makes an appearance. This wasn't exactly how they imagined their retirement to go, managing a radio show — I mean, what would a group of dementors know about management anyway? Up until now they had been floating around Azkaban, feeding when they got hungry, sleeping when they felt tired (if they ever tired) and just generally lazing about and living a life free from all responsibilities. And now they have to put together weekly schedules and do payroll and have regular meetings with representatives from our Vague Yet Menacing Government to approve my scripts before we go on air? Could you imagine the struggle of that? — and I can sympathize with them because to be quite honest, this isn't how I had imagined my post-Hogwarts life to go as well, but again I digress...
Their lips met in hesitant brushes at first, gaining confidence with each swipe until they were sure that the other wouldn't run away if they became a little forceful. A tongue slipped into one mouth, exploring the unique contours before coaxing its partner into a dance. Someone moaned, as hands began wandering, stripping off clothing and sliding against naked skin. Draco moaned as Harry pulled away to kiss a trail down his neck and into the crook of his neck where he sunk his teeth. Harry felt Draco slip his hand into his hair — as he'd imagined out loud for all of Wizarding Britain to hear — and tugged at the strands in encouragement, rutting his hips as he gasped out for more.
"I honestly have no idea why I was in the department of mysteries to begin with — maybe I was just bored? But I could have sworn that stupid curtain was taunting me so I walked right up to it, intending to give it a stern talking to and then I was hoovered right in." Harry offered when it was his turn.
Something you may not have known, though, listeners, is that our current minister — whom has only been in office for two weeks so far — has held a record breaking number of press conferences. He is actually listed in the Hall of Records as the sitting minister with the most press conferences in the history of the Ministry of Magic.
"Draco's just fixated because he spends so much time on his own hair every morning." Harry jumped at the feeling of ice crawling up his spine as Myrtle made her presence known.
"Hey guys, we got another extra-dimensional traveler here." Harry did a double take at the announcement.
"And what's this about the dementors being retired from Azkaban?"
"I'm sorry," She said looking down in an attempt to look apologetic, but Harry could see the sly unrepentant smile on her lips.
I concur. Let's all try and help these Merfolk make a good impression — remember, Nessie is confined to large bodies of water and therefore her opinion of the local Merfolk also extends to the surrounding land-going citizens as well. I, for one, would never let it be said that Draco Malfoy is a bad host and I trust the same goes with all who are listening — which is everyone, as this is a government mandated radio broadcast.
"Definitely not benign. Stay away," Lily warned, shivering. "They wear those creepy animal masks and live in the dog park — which is also off limits, by the way, probably because that's where the Unspeakables are so I'm not going to complain too much about that."
"So, tell me about you. Who is Draco Malfoy when he's not the voice keeping us company every day?" Harry asked casually as he took a sip of the white wine that Draco had picked. It was perfectly suited to Harry's taste and Harry let Draco know that immediately, enjoying the pleased look he was able to get in return.
But then we come to THE question: who are we really? What makes us us? Is it our flesh and bones and the parents that came together to donate parts of their genetic material to create the wholly new being that is you? Is that all you are? The culmination of years and years of intercourse? Are we our families? Or is it the thoughts and feelings that you have? Though they change at the drop of a hat, and have been fluctuating your whole life — though we're told by the Board of Medicine at St. Mungos that that's normal. All people change as they go through life. So, is it then our experiences that makes us who we are? The things we've lived through and the things we've said and done with other people who participated in those moments with you?
"No difference. We go into town, do the shopping, talk to the neighbors and the government workers. Draco just has to periodically remind everyone that we technically don't exist according to the government. Like mountains." Lily said with a small laugh at the last bit.
"Were you a Potter in your dimension?" The woman who was Lily, but not his mother, asked kindly.
"We should invite Albus and Gellert over — they're also from another dimension. Oh! And the Weasley's. They actually are from around here, but we've grown quite fond of them." Before James could toss the floo powder in to summon all the people he'd listed though, a tinny voice appeared to come from the bowl of fruit placed in the middle of the room.
Faintly, he heard Draco interrupting the mind-numbing story he had been reading to patch in their latest caller.
"Um," Harry began, remembering the task he had agreed to just moments before. "That man in the tent wanted me to tell you that your front curtains are closed." James — some other James, not his father — stared at him curiously.
Albus and Gellert had decided to spend the day at the beach; the Weasley's all had a family thing going on; and James was keeping Lily company. So Harry was left alone to amuse himself.
"Those masks are horrifying. I think they pulled them fresh from the animals," Sirius whispered, shuddering in horror. Harry thought back to his own inspections and had a feeling that Sirius might actually be right — yuck.
Whomever had sabotaged his room hadn’t let up, and Harry had been on the receiving end of powder, slime, and glitter, all which caused him some sort of harm. He still hadn’t gone to Madame Pomfrey but opted to get help from both Hermione and Neville. Harry had finally perfected a ward for his room only after approaching Professor Flitwick who, once he had corrected Harry’s wrist position, had conjured a perfect ward; he had received fifteen points and the Professor’s high praise.
Snape’s eyes immediately found the group on the couch and for a split-second Harry swore a flash of panic washed over the man. Both Rupert and Adaline, who had followed him inside, were giving him a brief rundown of what had transpired in the last few minutes and the few students that had been sent to retrieve the Professor were ushering the younger years into the dorms.
Harry hesitated. The locket that was on him was humming something fierce and without giving it another thought he pulled it from around his neck and held it in the palm of his hand. Tom’s eyes immediately picked up on the movement and stared at the object.
“Harry, I can put a stasis charm on the potion which would keep it in perfect condition for a few days so you can try and get some sleep,” he said worriedly and Harry shook his head, giving Draco a determined look, exhausted, but determined.
“You can borrow it Draco stop looking at it like you’re trying to will it out of my hands,” he joked lightly, and Draco rolled his eyes before carefully peeling back the paper covering his gift from Blaise.
“Blaise is my boyfriend, Professor,” the confession had caught the man off guard who looked at him mildly stunned.
“Take a look over here,” Harry stopped in front of a case with flat, round items and it took a second before he realized he was looking at pocket watches. Tilting his head to the side he looked over each of the them and he stopped at one that took his breath away.
“I don’t need anything, but Draco’s gift should have arrived, and I specifically had it sent to the shop rather than delivered by owl to the castle, he snoops, and I’ve learned my lesson,” Harry bit his lip, all playfulness gone.
Arriving at the Apparition spot that they had left from not a mere two hours ago Harry felt a wave of exhaustion coarse over him. The adrenaline that had fueled him not thirty minutes ago had bled out of his body.
Knowing better then casting a spell at a portrait he continued to try and get the attention of the founder of his house, and the founder of his lineage, to acknowledge him.
Turning he let out a laugh at Blaise who was attempting at doing an impersonation of Parkinson.
She let out a tinkering laugh and sipped on her own tea the smile on her face still evident behind the rim of the cup.
Keeping his wand level as he stared down two wands, he could feel his magic tingling beneath his skin.
“I want to know what’s going on Malfoy,” it was a glare match between boys, but Harry had no intention to letting up, he wanted to know what was going on. Pulling his arm from Harry’s grasp Malfoy pinched the bridge of his nose.
Traveling down the path Harry peered around at his surroundings curiously. He had never wandered around this part of the grounds and couldn’t imagine where they were headed to. Stopping in a small clearing Dumbledore turned to face him holding out his hand.
“I had my mother check for anything dangerous when it arrived, the wards surrounding the manor wouldn’t have let in most dark curses,” easing slightly Harry tore the paper and pulled out a folded piece of parchment.
“Harry,” growled the Veela and Harry pressed against the hardness at his back, suddenly feeling frisky.
“Please don’t tell me you’ve sealed the bond,” Mister Malfoy groused, and Draco rolled his eyes.
“That could work, but Dumbledore has eyes on the Dursleys, so it would be a lot harder to sneak out,” he mused, knowing fully well that the Dursleys wouldn’t keep a secret for him if their lives depended on it.
“When I turned sixteen and came into my creature inheritance, I gained a Veela side that became apart of everything, of my mind and my magic, I was focused on finding my mate and anything, like fights, seemed unimportant. When I felt the spark with Harry the Veela part of me couldn’t even tease him. When he accepted the mateship I couldn’t even make fun of you three, my Veela side wouldn’t allow it,” Harry snickered and poked the blonde in the rib and let out a small bout of laughter as Draco snatched his arms and tucked them into his sides effectively trapping him.
yourself
“Ah, but you can’t prove I did it.” Draco waggled his eyebrows. This was the friendliest they’d been in weeks, and Harry had to wonder if Narcissa had told him to behave.
“Draco,” Harry murmured, and Draco was lost. Because he
“Draco,” she had said, as Potter slipped past. “Mr Potter,” she’d said, a little louder.
And he did; he could have just looked, and looked. But Draco’s pale skin was right there, begging to be tasted, and looking was just going to have to wait a while. He dragged his lips up Draco’s neck and nipped gently at the skin there, making Draco’s head fall back and his lips fall open. Open-mouthed and wet and hot. And then down to his collar bones, just the right size to close his teeth over; he sucked a dark little bruise to the underside, where it would be hidden by Draco’s clothes and he wouldn’t have to heal it.
,” Draco amended, gritting his teeth. “Not with everything…”
“In some ways, Draco, you haven’t changed a bit,” she said, shaking her head. “I’ll tell Blaise you said hello.”
“And that’s your father,” Draco said, pointing. “You look like him. But he was tall —”
“Do you want a hint?”
“Why not today?”
“Everyone knows you prefer a nice dirigible plum seed or two,” Draco replied. He barely noticed when Harry pushed himself out of his chair, mumbled an excuse and slipped away.
Draco’s arse met the cool tile of the bathroom wall, and he slid all the way down, landing in an inelegant pile, tears streaming down his cheeks. “Because I’m asking you to. Because I’ll beg, if you want me to.”
“Because it’s torture?” Draco suggested hopefully. Narcissa gave him a baleful look.
“But — what happened to it?” she asked. She took a cautious step into the room. The dim light made her nervous and nauseous, and the smell of mildew and dust didn’t help at all.
Hermione nodded. Marrying Ron. She’d always imagined — but then it just hadn’t worked, and the three of them had fallen apart, after the war, and it had taken so long to find their way back to each other. She didn’t blame herself for that. Ron and Gabrielle were happy, she and Blaise were happy, and… and Harry had created an entirely new reality, all because…
“We should stop,” he murmured, with more self-control than he thought he could muster. Harry pressed his face into Draco’ neck and groaned. Less seductive and more disappointed. “We do have a party to get through. Dinner will be served soon.”
“It’s not the same.”
“Headmaster,” he said, when she had pushed a chocolate biscuit into his hand, “can I ask you for a favour?”
“I thought there would be more people,” Harry said, quietly. Including the five of them, there were a little over a dozen, and two were Ministry officials of some sort. None of Malfoy’s friends from school were there. Pansy’s family had disappeared to France, Harry knew. Gregory Goyle was in hospital; he hadn’t coped with the memory of the Fiendfyre, or Vincent Crabbe, at all. Theo Nott, Blaise Zabini — Harry had no idea. But there was no one here for Malfoy, and Harry felt ill.
“It’s just, it’s what we were going to do together,” he said. “I thought we’d do it together, graduate together, be partners for our whole lives —”
Harry spun Luna around again.
Draco snorted a laugh. “When have I ever shown the slightest bit of interest in girls, Min— Hermione?” he asked.
“Of course I don’t,” Draco said, raising an eyebrow. “I spent the war eating bonbons and going to Pureblood courting dances.”
“Nah, but he’s Harry Potter, isn’t he? They need him available to trot out whenever there’s a camera in the street. Or something flashy to be done. That’s not what Auror work is about, you know. It’s not all duelling, and breaking up illegal potions rings. I’m an investigator, right?”
He felt Draco come in behind him, soothing, hands on his waist. “I’m sorry, darling. Bacon.”
Eventually — an hour, maybe two, Draco wasn’t counting, just enjoying himself — Harry rolled over onto his other side and away from Draco. Probably getting too warm. Draco let him. He needed to get up. He had things to do. Not all of them had to do with Harry but most of them did. He wasn’t going to give in to the urge to wake him and shake him and demand to know if he remembered everything and if it had all been real; to kiss Harry from the top of his stupid birds-nest head of hair, still mostly black but shot through with grey, to the toes on his ugly feet, which had done more work than they should ever have had to by the time he had turned eighteen.
“Oh, don’t even joke about that. I wouldn’t change my name again under the Imperius curse. Now, stop trying to get a rise out of me, and kiss me properly.”
Harry bit his lip, and cast a warming charm on his pie, since he apparently wasn’t allowed to eat it until they were done with this conversation. “Because he’s been skittish as a Cornish Pixie, and I had no idea what to say to you.” He crossed his arms on the table. “You asked me about the night I broke my nose.”
Sleeping in his office had always been a very poor reflection on Harry’s life choices but now, it would be humiliating, as well.
“I don’t like to think about things like this,” Harry said. “I don’t know why you’d force me to. Did I do something wrong?”
“Does Minister Granger know you read her romance novels, Potter? Your
Harry nodded. “I can only imagine.”
Draco set the tea back on the tray. “I’m tired,” he said, and buried himself under the quilts again.
Draco shook his head. “I can do it tomorrow. I need to check in about the overall potions stores anyway.”
“Crookshanks,” she murmured.
“And that’s an excuse?”
Naked, with his long, proud cock curving towards his stomach, Draco was beyond beautiful. His lips were softly swollen from kisses and he put himself up on one elbow as Harry discarded the last of his own clothes.
Harry sat in the dim workroom for another half an hour, listening to the rain, and basking in the peace of his new life. And then, as he often did when he had the time and space to wonder, he thought about Draco Malfoy, and wondered where he was.
“And you’re sleeping? In a normal way,” she said. “You are?”
When Draco woke that final morning he was, for a moment, as disoriented as it is possible to be in completely familiar surroundings, and in the company of someone with whom one has spent most of ones time for months on end. Draco was getting used to waking on the transfigured bed, held down by mystical sleep, with his fingers tangled up with Harry’s. And Harry never moved. Never took his hand back. The sheets were never rumpled and nor were the soft flannel pyjamas Harry wore.
“What’s happening?” Draco asked, clutching at Harry in lust and fear.
“No. I’m sorry. It’s not that.”
“I was so sorry about your mother, dear,” Molly said. Harry wanted to turn time back a few moments and distract her, but Draco forced a very polished expression onto his face, even if his eyes looked desperately sad.
She didn’t. It was a terrible week. Too much work to do, too many meetings, too much interdepartmental whining. Blaise was away doing something he couldn’t talk about, and she missed him terribly, and the only person she wanted to talk to about it was Harry.
“You’re still a bloody brilliant flyer,” Harry said, turning back to Draco. Draco hoped the flush of his cheeks could be attributed to the warming charm, and not the sudden rush of want. He hunted around for an insult, something that would make Harry laugh, but when he opened his mouth, what came out was “Not too bad yourself. For a Gryffindor.”
“Hogwarts,” he said, with a half-laugh. “I’m sorry, Madam Shacklebolt. Perhaps I need a holiday. I could spend some time at the seaside; I have friends who…”
Harry would have liked to look at them closer.
“It’s time to go back. I miss Finn and Grayson.”
It took Harry some time to dry Draco’s clothes with warming charms, once he had him in front of the fire in the workshop. He seemed to slip in and out of consciousness, but he didn’t speak again, and eventually, whispering soothing words, Harry managed to reach for Draco, touch him, hold his arm.
“What is the meaning of this?” she asked, stomping her foot.
“Yes, Mrs Weasley.”
“It’s good to be King,” Harry agreed. “I have gifts. What should I…”
“You’re just a man, Harry. You’ve achieved extraordinary things, but you’re just a man. Nothing more should be expected of you than of anyone else. It’s time this was over.”
“Same thing that happened this morning. But usually, long before I see it. You’re not going to turn this into some kind of thing, are you?”
Draco poured her another drink.
There would be time for proper lube in a little while. Not yet. Harry’s pupils got even wider and darker as he fellated Draco’s finger.
After lunch they returned to their duties. Amorous older students were paired off in various combinations in various dark corners. Harry felt terrible; Draco must have agreed.
Draco wasn’t going to express an opinion about anything that was so very, very far from his business, so he waited silently.
“Don’t get your knickers in a knot,” Draco said, but when she looked up Draco was actually smiling. “Just a bit of boyhood fun. He seems to be rather settled. Can’t believe he… well.” Draco sipped his whiskey.
. He’d have to be very careful with the reptile house, of course. Draco wondered if he had full control over his magic back yet. If he was being careful when he slept. If anyone was making sure he ate. If anyone was making sure he

, and
It had been over a week since Draco had appeared at breakfast; and for dinner, he was so painfully polite and distant that Harry wanted to shake him. But he didn’t. Instead he was just as polite, and just as distant. Draco attended Duelling Club but never stayed to chat afterwards. He didn’t invite himself to Harry’s quarters to drink his tea and drape himself invitingly on the furniture.
“This is humiliating,” he said, as he wiped the tears from his face. “I knew this would be impossibly hard, but I didn’t… I mean, it’s
supposed to
“Harry Potter,” he said out loud. “You are a pain in the arse, do you know that?”
“Flipping out and running away has become a terrible habit.”
Harry slung an arm around her shoulder as Teddy and Draco slipped out into the street.
Draco woke to find Harry half-sprawled over his side. Head on Draco’s shoulder, arm across his chest, hand tucked securely under Draco’s body, just above the jagged cut of his hip.
“My feelings have nothing to do with it. Now, can we please change the subject to something far more pleasant? With what charity are you salving your conscience this week? Or we could return to an old favourite, and you could remind me about my appalling behaviour in my early twenties.”
fly more often. He was still quite a good flyer. It didn’t have to be only for coaching Quidditch.
“Hallo,” Ron said in a stage whisper, opening the door, as the strange guest stepped over the threshold. “Listen, I don’t want to use your last name in case the old bat hears. Can I call you Chris?”
Of course, the first thing that struck him was the fact that the place was clean, and smelled like… like… Harry closed his eyes an inhaled deeply. Like orange rinds. Clean, and fresh, and almost sharp. He hadn’t yet closed the door when he began to stare. The hallway was painted a soft blue-grey colour; the exact colour, he thought, of Draco Malfoy’s eyes.
“Fuck you very much.”
“You used to love chess,” Ron said.
Harry read the article carefully, but there were no hints. She had been found dead.
“Oh, Molly… I’m sorry. You didn’t have to do that.” Harry led her a few steps into the kitchen. Over the last few years they’d grown closer. Honest. Molly was less of a parent and more like… well, Harry thought of the friends he had who got along well with a particular Auntie or Uncle, and how they could be easier to talk to than a parents. “Really, I should be apologising to you. You opened your home to him because I asked you to, even though… and I made a huge error in judgement. I forgot the tale of the scorpion and the frog. The frog would be very disappointed with me.” He smiled tightly, but didn’t bother trying to laugh.
“You’re a very strange person, so that tracks,” he said, and let his bones melt as he leaned into a thorough kiss. He almost groaned out loud when Draco broke it prematurely.
“You asked the question all wrong, of course. You do that. Tell me, Harry, why would I not approve of someone you were in love with?”
“Yes, you’ve explained that.” Hermione cast a quick
Harry swallowed against a lump in his throat.
“You have never showed any particular interest in women,” Narcissa said drily. “Nor in the sane.” Draco choked on… nothing, literally nothing, as he had a glass of wine in his hand and had not yet sipped from it. “My first choice is always your happiness. And your first choice is Harry Potter.”
Black is taking Master Potter to his Villa,” Rubino said. He produced a slip of parchment and handed it to Hermione before bowing so low his little nose almost touched the ground. “Minister and her friend are to use the Floo.” He disapparated with a crack, and Hermione was left with her mouth hanging open.
The trio moved in to Grimmauld place once again. It made sense. It was easy for Ron and Harry to get to the Ministry for their Auror training and easy for Hermione to get to school. There were plenty of rooms, so Hermione could also have a nice quiet study, once they had finished renovating one for her; an airy, light-filled room with a view over the distant gardens, an owl perch outside and an enchanted kettle so that Hermione didn’t have to leave the room to make tea when she was on a roll.
“As it happens, I am an excellent cook,” Draco said. He pulled Harry across the kitchen to the cellar door, and settled in behind him, hands on his hips, breath in his ear. “Open the door, Harry. Let me cook you something good. Let me spoil you.” His voice got lower, seductive. “You can eat dessert off my stomach.”
“Do you want me to see what I can find out?” she asked.
“Oh, go ahead and tell me we can’t do this until the third full moon of the year, or something, go on. You started this.”
Draco shrugged. “I’ve made quite a name for myself. The name, of course, is
It was shortly after nine when Harry heard a knock on the door of his classroom and stepped out of his room to cross the cobbled floor and open the door to Draco.
were his home. He would be glad to see that awful family tree gone from the wall. And how you’ve brought in the light. Not the House of Black, not any more. The House of Potter.”
“I’m not proud. I use all sorts of methods. Muggle medications don’t work well on us, but I can sometimes pull together an equivalent potion — and psychology is psychology. We all have the same drives, in the end.” He yawned.
“You are free to act against medical advice, of course, but I recommend you remain here in Naples where I can assist and observe your recovery. I will inform Minister Granger of this, as your medical proxy, of course.”
Ollivander had been skeptical when Harry had begun coaxing stones to settle into the wood; caging themselves at the base of the handle, or snaking their way up the shaft. But when he had seen how it worked, he had smiled at Harry with his eyes horribly bright and kissed his forehead, which was high praise.
“As long as you don’t piss in my shoes, I think I’ll survive.” Harry crossed his arms under his head, and sighed. Draco was so close that Harry could smell his skin, the lingering fragrance of whatever cologne he’d put on that morning. The gaslights on the walls made the shadows flicker, golden and lovely, sharpening Draco’s cheekbones until Harry imagined that if he was to reach up and touch one he could cut himself.
. I don’t know how long we spent there, watching Sirius disappear through the veil, over and over again.”
Harry smiled. “He said that, exactly, and then he told me that Wandmakers’ apprentices make an absolute pittance. And he offered me an apprenticeship, and I said yes.”
“No,” Luna said, but she was standing as well. “You should come. It’s a very good time for walking alongside the stream.”
“Minister,” Parvati said, turning as the door closed, ready and waiting for the gourmet fiends just waiting for the opportunity to attack. Hermione tried to tamp down the irritation. It really wasn’t anyone’s fault that she was in a funny mood. Lots going on. An engagement she couldn’t announce until after Blaise had resigned from his post, a best friend emerging from his coma, another still pretending that everything was right with the world;
Malfoy didn’t answer, just opened and closed his eyes several times.
They didn’t allow each other advantages; everything was a vicious battle of wills and joy and the students kept up cries of support. Harry and Draco kept their eyes locked on each other and Harry wondered a hundred times if his eyes were as bright as Draco’s.
That evening, by the time Harry was sitting at the Head table beside Draco, he was fit to burst. The afternoon had dragged on terribly, not least because he’d spent lunch time with Professor McGonagall discussing the possibility of a Duelling Club, and talking through the rules that would need to be set in place. He had been almost too excited to notice her expression, cool and appraising, and had dismissed almost out of hand her question of who might assist him.
There was a crack of apparition, and Malfoy was gone.
Harry spent a long time, that night, exploring his own home. He wasn’t sure he really needed to. He knew it — he had designed it, mapped it out, and this was a very faithful reconstruction of the way that it had been in his head. And best of all, the house was happy to see him. He wasn’t sure he would ever get used to the idea of having three house-elves, but he couldn’t deny that they seemed pleased with themselves. He would have to ban them from punishing themselves — no house-elf was going to iron their ears under Harry’s employ — but for now, he was content to be grateful to them.
“Is Harry not with us this morning?” she asked, cool and shrewd.
Harry raised his eyebrows pointedly. “No, I just like to cradle this tosh in my lap from time to time. Next time I get chocolates in the post, I’ll give them to you, I promise. Is that really what you came to talk about?”
“Oh, god,” Hermione said.
Hermione didn’t need to hear this.
“I’ll do it, if you like,” Harry said, following him out the back. It wasn’t the main kitchen, just a tiny table, a kettle, and a small pantry full of tea and biscuits. Ollivander didn’t answer, but he sat gratefully at the table and watched as Harry made tea, coughing lightly from time to time. “I hear you’ve been ill. I’m very sorry to hear it. If there’s anything I can do —”
He fire-called Hermione again, feeling ill. Some previously un-described mixture of anticipation and sheer bloody terror, because he had no idea what to expect.
There was a blotch at the beginning of the next line, as if Harry had spent a long time debating what else he could write, and had ultimately decided to sign off with just a
“That happens a lot?”
“And anyway, have you heard me announce us? I’m Secret-Keeper.” And then in a voice that was something decidedly posh-adjacent, he said “Malfoy Mansion, Wiltshire.” His voice was as rich and smooth as velvet.
“I was his sacrifice. He expected my life to be short, and purposeful, and he did what he could when I could to make sure it went the way it needed to and that once I was at Hogwarts I would feel grateful to have found my place, and desperate to want to do the right thing.”
“Do you really think I imagined I’d be able to appear in Diagon Alley, at your shop, and avoid your friends forever? I might be an idiot, Potter, but I’m not stupid. I
Harry sat patiently. Or rather, impatiently, and full of energy, and ready to gather up his favourite students immediately.
What else. Trying to find the odd moment to act their ages, that had been a challenge. Riding brooms felt like a waste of time. They weren’t studying, so complaining about homework wasn’t on the cards. Trapped between a childhood that had been one of the many casualties of war and an adulthood they weren’t yet ready for.
“Alright,” Harry said. He hadn’t been expecting an apology; he really hadn’t. The silent understanding they had arrived at the previous week was as much as Harry was ever going to want or need from Malfoy and he was quite sure Malfoy felt the same. “Malfoy — what are you going to do?”
He had to get up. He had to go to work. He…
Minerva nodded, and gripped Harry’s shoulder a moment. “The students arrive in four days,” she said. “Neville should be able to help with anything you need, until then — but don’t hesitate to come and visit, or to ask me any questions you may have.”
In private, he obsessed about it all the way he had in Sixth year. He wasn’t sure Malfoy
. Not where, not why, not by who. Was he at Grimmauld Place?”
He hated it.
“I believe you’re missing an adjective, Potter,” Draco suggested guilelessly. Harry looked at him in wide-eyed panic. “Those are the
Knowing, or at least believing, that his life would be cut short at seventeen years old, when he’d scarcely had a chance to live.
Everyone was wearing freshly knitted Weasley jumpers in a riot of colours. Apparently Molly had grown weary of sticking with house colours. Victoire was decked out in yellow, pink, and aquamarine; Teddy in purple and lime green.
“It is completely unprofessional to fall in love with a patient,” Emrys said. He scratched his nails over his short hair. “But you know that.”
“But I missed him, you see. And those times I managed to scratch out a few hours or a couple of days for myself, without work, without the Ministry, without my charity events — suddenly, I hated those hours. With nothing to do, I… you know, I’ve never had much of an imagination. And I didn’t have much experience with relationships, not really. But sometimes, when I couldn’t sleep, or when I had a couple of hours to myself, I started to imagine what it would be like. If I’d been able to summon up the courage to go to him after the war and offer my hand in friendship, the way he had done so long ago. Or if I had found a way to let him stay in England without fear for his life. I couldn’t do any of that, though; so we became friends in my mind. And I started incorporating all the things I had learned about him, letting us both grow up in my burgeoning imagination. How he looked when he was being so incredibly gentle with a patient, or pausing out the front of the hospital to collect a couple of flowers. How he could be cutting and funny but also tender, and full of love. All of that, I took it, and I imagined…”
“Harry,” he said. “Happy Christmas.”
“It is cracked,” he said. “Severed in the centre. I’m afraid it does happen, with heirloom wands. I could repair it…”
“Oh for — Zabini, I am a mental health professional. Harry Potter is trying very hard to shag
“I’ll
face, Draco. You don’t know what that face can do to a man. Enough of it and your bones would melt, I reckon. It’s worked on me my whole life and it’ll work on me when she’s long in the ground and her portrait makes that face at me from the wall. Though I don’t see it so much, these days.”
“I’m completely fucked,” Harry said.
“I told you, he doesn’t go there, much. You’ve seen it. No. There was a break in a case. He was in his office. He has a terrible habit of sleeping up there when he’s worked late and he’s too tired to apparate.”
inconvenient.
Harry used to be such a scrawny boy, and as a teenager, wasn’t much less scrawny, really, but now he is all thick, ropy muscle. Draco’s hands were steady and practiced but only perhaps nine-tenths clinical, as his hands moved over Harry’s skin. “Physical contact is important,” Draco said. “Especially magical physical contact. He’s getting a little dehydrated, at times. Mostly I focus on the problem at hand and two other Healers take care of the rest of his physical needs, but…”
He looked different.
“The Sorting,” Harry muttered. “Brave, Smart, Evil… and Miscellaneous.”
“Teach me what?” Harry said, joking gently. “Sounds pretty simple to me — I thought the wand chose the Wizard, sir.” He only smiled when Ollivander pretended to slap the back of his head.
Malfoy rested his hands on the edge of the counter. “I can’t believe I fucked that up. It was really the only plan I had.”
“Thank you,” she said, wiping her nose. “It’s not necessary.”
this, Harry?” Ollivander gave it a little wave, and smiled as the orange and gold sparks shot out from the end. “Is this — Kneazle whisker?”
“Who you
“Can I ask you something?” Harry nodded. “Your magic. Is it…”
“Draco?”
The funny thing about the kiss was how remarkably calm and unremarkable it was; just a warm, dry press of lips. A test. In Sixth Year Potions, Snape had taught them a spell which showed them what the base of a potion was; there were only a handful of bases possible, and discovering how a specific potion was brewed required first and foremost finding out precisely what the base was. Few had mastered the spell, but Draco had mastered it on his first try, and in the seven years he had slaved away at St Mungo’s, he had improved and perfected it. Just a simple spell, producing a ribbon of light that would shift subtly depending on what a potion contained. Ideal for discovering the identity of an unknown brew. An essential first step in healing something that had not yet been identified. He’d gone much, much further with it; he could use a slightly altered version to discover the base of a poison that was rushing through a person’s veins. Or that was present on a dead body, even down to skeletal remains.
When everyone had eaten their fill, and laughed their fill, and — in all honesty — drunk their fill, they went home, the green flames dancing in the fireplace as people called their goodbyes.
Eight sharp, Harry brought a light supper of finger sandwiches from the kitchen. Draco appreciated it. He hadn’t had the energy to head up to the Great Hall, even after a few hours of sleep, and he had missed lunch. And though his arms and face looked somewhat better, he hadn’t wanted Amelia to see him again until he was properly healed.
“I don’t. How’s Ron?”
“Getting soft in your advanced age, Malfoy,” came a voice at his elbow. Draco smirked, and his eyes flashed to Potter’s. He looked significantly better. Of course, without the shadows beneath them to distract Malfoy, those eyes were once again a bit of a problem.
“Wow,” Ron deadpanned. “I didn’t know that at all. You’ve never mentioned it eight hundred times. In fact I don’t think Ollivander has ever said anything that you didn’t repeat back to us later.”
A student raised her hand, and Harry raised his eyebrows.
“If you wake up,” he said, quietly, “I think I’d like to get to know you, Potter. We grew up. I’d like to see who you grew up into. Please, don’t die like this.”
But he would come. And Draco would be ready.
When it was over — and that was quite quickly, the whole painful thing over in a handful of moments, with no one to speak for Mrs Malfoy — Harry and the others stood a short distance from the grave, waiting. Harry was hoping that at some point he would realise the exact thing that he needed to do here and suddenly summon the fortitude to do it. He had one eye on Malfoy and one on Teddy, whose hair had turned green suddenly as he turned a leaf over in his chubby little hand.
Harry tipped his mug over. The collection had been growing for a little while, now. He’d found some of Hedwig’s feathers, and put them in alongside the Hippogriff feathers. And Crookshanks’ whiskers — well, they were about five inches long.
“Of course.”
Ron still looked a little shell-shocked.
And he was gone.
The Glamour made his nose a little longer and turned it up at the tip, made his eyes brown, made him a little taller (though not enough so his trousers looked odd; for some reason, he’d never quite managed to master shifting his clothing without throwing off the proportions, and when he tried harder he got unpredictable results — unlike Draco, who looked like he tailored his outfit every morning in front of the mirror).
“You care for him, don’t you?” Hermione asked.
“But the way it was, that was never his home, Harry.
Whoever this man in Harry’s head was, Draco didn’t think he could ever live up to it. “Was I very disappointing?” he asked. “Compared to…”
When Harry went home he was feeling cheerful and creative so he fed Scamp a treat and spent a few hours in his workshop. It was time to be finished with this wand. It had come out precisely as he’d pictured it in his head; the deep red that looked black without strong light, the flames carved low on the base, the deep shine. His first successful thestral-hair wand. It had the most beautiful melancholy about it, and reminded him of something (or perhaps someone) he couldn’t quite bring to mind.
He rested his elbows on the table, his face in his hands. He felt a cautious press of a finger against his shoulder, and looked down. Lissie, one of the house elves. He had sewn her a dress whilst he was on house arrest, all of those years ago. Pricked his fingers dozens of times while he tried to master the simple housekeeping charms required. He’d made the dress from a pretty pillowcase he’d found, a sweet, soft blue with teal paisley in the background, overlaid with pink roses.
“Thank you, Rubino. And you, Draco,” she said, and followed the swaggering elf toward the guest rooms on the upper floor.
“No, no, I know. And you’re right. I’ll be going back with you two in September.”
Harry marked days on a calendar, not with crosses but with ticks. He wrote things down, places he’d been, wonderful moments that he had experienced. People he had spoken to, if they said anything that interested him, even for a moment.
“You don’t have to belong to anyone but yourself anymore, Harry,” Draco murmured, into Harry’s robe, his skin. “Please. I don’t know the words that will get through to you. Please, Harry.
“Are you hungry?” he asked Harry, smoothing imaginary creases from his shirt.
Harry opened his eyes. The sun was warm on his face — it was later than he’d expected. He’d slept in. He smiled into the pillow as he felt Draco move behind him. He pretended he was still asleep, and after a moment, he felt Draco’s chest press against his back, Draco’s arms moving around him, warm breath on the back of his neck.
“I’m in no rush. The Minister said if I want to waste a little time poking in corners, you could go home. Or back to work in that marvellous shop of yours. She showed me a photograph of your daughters — they are a lovely pair. Congratulations.”
“And dying in the Forbidden Forest doesn’t cut it?” Ginny snorted. “No, wait, it’s Harry. Dying for all mankind was probably the best day of his life.”
“One of the old gang, who helped to save the world,” Draco said miserably. He was going to need his own hangover cure in the morning. “
Harry clenched his fists.
Draco could not have felt less comfortable stepping out of Hermione’s Floo.
He was sitting on the edge of a grave. It was very wide, the concrete cover, presumably a family plot. Probably three people wide. Draco wondered what it would say on the headstone, if he could read it; but this, of course, was a dream, and you can’t read in dreams, and also, Draco didn’t want to take his eyes off Harry. Older again, now, with stubble over his jaw and grey flecks in his hair, a scar peeking from the neck of his sweatshirt.
She sobbed into the handkerchief for several minutes, trying not to shrug away Draco’s gentle hand on her shoulder. The implications were horrendous. Either Dumbledore hadn’t known what was happening at the Dursleys’ house, because he had never checked in, which made him neglectful himself. Or he knew and did nothing, which made him complicit. And after all of that, Dumbledore had used him as a weapon.
.” He had the feeling that their surroundings had changed, but he didn’t want to open his eyes to check; he could rely, he thought, on the shift from damp tile grout and cold night air to the smell of thick dust and carpet mildew. They were, he suspected, in the sitting room at Number Twelve, Grimmauld Place. He felt Harry moving; his arms slipping around Draco’s waist, his head resting on Draco’s stomach. Draco reached down, his fingers carding through Harry’s hair.
been a full life. But there were days when Harry looked at him and saw him not in the shop but hunched on the ground in the Malfoy Manor dungeons, already looking like a ghost. Or in his bedroom at Shell Cottage with his hands shaking as he held a mug of tea, trying to warm himself up. The war had taken a lot from him.
Harry wanted to point out cruelly that the only three people from their year at Hogwarts at the funeral had been himself, and Ron, and Hermione. He swallowed the acidic words down.
“I’m missing something,” he said. “I don’t know what it is. I’m missing something, and it’s huge, and important, and I — I can’t figure it… there’s something I don’t know. I’ve tried pushing deeper. I’ve tried legilimency —”
"We could bake some cookies?" Harry suggested.
Every time Draco found himself alone, he put his eyeliner on, each time the eyeliner becoming more perfect, each side becoming more even and each line becoming sharper. Every time the black was painted around his eyes, Draco couldn't help but admire himself. He thought he looked pretty, really pretty.
Draco switched off his lamp and the two went to sleep.
Silence was the reply Draco got, so he got out of bed and headed out of their bedroom. Harry was probably making breakfast or watching TV. Draco could feel the worry build up in his chest, he tried to shake it away but it seemed to be lodged there.
"Psych! Found you one and you're gonna love it." Harry smirked and passed over the bag to Draco.
"No-one." Harry replied.
Everyone else in the common room was quietly watching the conversation between the two boys. Well, they were mainly listening to Harry because sassy Harry was the best Harry.
"Jesus fucking Christ! Fine! I'm going with someone but I'm not telling you who! Is that good enough for you? Are you happy now? Or am I going to have to endure more of your bitching and whining because if I do, please tell me so I can fucking avarda kedavra myself!" Draco exclaimed, placing his wand to his head to prove a point.
"No."
"So, I see you're here to report a missing person?" The officer asked.
The boys met up with Hermione and Hannah Abbott. Harry watched as Hermione blushed as Ron took her arm and as Neville pressed a small kiss on Hannah's cheek. He smiled when he saw Dean and Seamus look at each other shyly before taking each other's hand. Harry couldn't help but feel happy for all of his friends as he saw lovesick grins spread across all of their faces.
"Don't speak to me." Harry walked off to the kitchen and made himself a cup of coffee. After he had taken a sip, Draco attempted to talk to him again.
Draco wiped a tear away from his face before falling asleep. Draco pulled the cover up and over his face in case his mother came in. The one thing Draco didn't want was his mother seeing him upset.
"What the fuck do you think you're doing?" Draco asked.
, Harry thought absentmindedly as he stared up into Draco's eyes.
Harry continued playing the adverts. Draco smiled at the rest of them, the occasional tear falling.

Draco's eyes locked with Harry's and Draco couldn't describe what he felt. Looking into those emerald pools, it felt like everything just came at Draco at once. Every emotion came flying at him but few chose to stick, happiness, relief and love.
Harry woke the next morning, to the sun shining through the window. He got up immediately and threw back the curtains. There, across the hills was a thick, blanket. Harry checked the time, it was 8. He decided that Draco had had enough of his beauty sleep and could be woke up now. Harry quickly got changed and threw on as many layers as he could find. He wrapped his Gryffindor scarf around his neck and shoved his hat and gloves into his pocket. He sprinted all the way down to the Slytherin dorms. He said the password and ran up to Draco's room. Draco being Draco, of course had his own room. Harry unlocked the door and went into the room.
"Really?" Draco asked, a little shocked.
"Pretty." Harry said, quietly.
The timer on the oven still confused Draco but he got there eventually.
"Of course I can." Draco's heart swelled with relief and happiness.
Harry sat up and looked at the boy in front of him. His breath was immediately taken away from how stunning Draco looked, everything was just so... perfect. Harry's eyes flicked over Draco's body before landing on his face. Draco's usual eyeliner was there but it was accompanied by some black, grey and white eyeshadow, blended together to they framed Draco's pretty eyes perfectly. Harry noticed that Draco's eyelashes looked more defined, thicker and longer, making the blue flecks in his sliver eyes pop even more. A white highlight as upon Draco's cheek bones, accentuating his features perfectly and making him glow even more than he already did. And his lipstick, his lipstick just completed the look. It was jet black, painted on with such precision making Draco's lips seem fuller and plumper. Draco looked more than just pretty and stunning.
Harry stood up on his tip toes and captured Draco's lips in a kiss full of love.
"And you look happy with him. That's all I want for you."
Harry's mind kept flicking back to when Draco froze up. The look of fear, discomfort and disgust that lay on Draco's face just didn't sit right with Harry. Draco had always been strong-willed and barely let any words get to them so Harry knew that whatever that person had said must've been bad if it made them react the way they did.
Everything combined together in this moment, including the things that lay deeper than just the skin, made Draco seem like a piece of art gifted to this world by angels.
"Merry Christmas, Draco." Harry whispered.
"Unbelievable." Harry muttered.
They tried their best not to think about it or worry about it and when they went out, they always acted confident, which they were, it was just that subconsciously, they were always anxious and worried. Draco partially blamed that on having shitty parents who constantly made you feel like you were doing something wrong. They also blamed it on the fact that some people were just horrible.
Harry laughed as Draco grabbed him by the shoulders and steered him out of the kitchen and into the living room. Harry sat down on the sofa, Draco joining him a moment later when they had located the remote for the television. Draco scooted closer to Harry until their sides were touched, trying and failing to hide their smile when Harry lazily lifted his arm and wrapped it around Draco, bringing them impossibly closer. Draco couldn't stop the heat that rose to his cheeks when Harry pressed a soft kiss to their temple.
"Really?"
Harry and Draco lounged around for a little while before getting ready to go out. It was like minus five degrees outside so both men threw on as many layers as possible. They walked very slowly to the bus stop as there was a lot of ice on the floor and neither of them planned on losing their dignity that day. Harry had checked the timetable for the bus and had timed their leaving perfectly so that by the time they got there, they only had to wait one minute for the bus. Harry paid for the bus and they both sat down in a pair of worn seats near the back.
The other day, Draco had become so frustrated that he threw a plate and the scary thing about it was that he didn't even realise what he'd done until the plate was in pieces on the kitchen floor. He'd tried to clean in up but ended up cutting his hand and he had to call Hermione to help him. Hermione had managed to calm him down but soon after she left, the frustration and confusion were back.
The Hall was beautifully decorated. The ceiling was bewitched to make it seem as if snow was falling from the sky which was lit up by thousands of stars and lanterns. Icicles hung from the ceiling, around the walls and three Christmas trees stood proudly at the end of the Hall. The floor was a beautiful white colour, with an effect to make it look like ice. A raised stage stood in the corner where a band was playing a slow song. Everything about it was stunning.
"Good, because I'm most definitely in love with you too."
Draco rolled their eyes but fell into the comforting warmth and smiled. Draco sighed contently and basked in the safety and security Harry's embrace provided them with. Draco could easily stay here for the rest of their life and have no complaints.
Harry paid for the chocolate and calendar and the two made their way back to the bus stop. It took them about 45 minutes to get back home.
"I tried as hard as I could, I promise you but my parents were having none of it." Pansy sighed.
Harry and Draco walked down the aisle, everyone clapping for them. They walked into the room where the food would be served, everyone following behind them. The food was delicious, Molly had made it all. After a few speeches had been made by Ron, Arthur, Hermione, Pansy, Harry and Draco, the newly weds stepped out of the tent while everything was cleared away in room for a dance floor.
Draco ran into the kitchen and looked in the oven. "HARRY! HARRY! THEY'RE ON FIRE! HARRY! MERLIN! THEY'RE ON FIRE!"
"An advent calendar is basically a calendar that either goes on for 12, 24 or 25 days. The ones that go on for 12 days are shit. It has doors that you open from the first of December to either the twelfth, 24th or 25th. Behind each door, you get a different gift. You can get different advent calendars that have different things, so some have lego, some have chocolate, some have make-up and beauty things, some have pictures and there's a lot more." Harry explained.
"What makes you think I'd be a good fashion judge?" Harry asked.
The bell rang, signalling the end of lunch. The two girls waited for Peeves to arrive before they entered the potions classroom. Hermione was so distracted that she messed up her potion. This shocked everyone as they were brewing a really simple potion as a re-cap before their N.E.W.T's.
"Perfect. Are there any here?"
"But, Dray. I don't wanna." Harry whined, sounding very nasally as he couldn't breathe out of his nose.
"Nice. Well, thanks so much for inviting us." Draco said.
Pansy stopped just before she left the living room and gave Draco a calculating gaze. Draco immediately felt distaste towards that look and narrowed their eyes at Pansy.
"I just wish we had some leads." Dean sighed. "I mean we have nothing and it's so frustrating."
"Okay!"
Draco knew Hermione and Ron were at the party, which means Harry is probably with them. Draco felt the paranoia slow down a little. It wouldn't completely go away until he knew his Harry was safe.
Harry and Draco followed Hermione and Ron into their kitchen where the rest were standing. The two greeted the rest of their friends, and soon after, Seamus and Dean arrived.
"Your welcome." Hermione smiled.
"Remember when all we were concerned about was passing our O.W.L.S and who would win the house cup." Pansy said, a hint of nostalgia in her voice.
Draco lightly bumped their head against Harry's chest, their way of saying goodnight when they were too tired to talk. Draco didn't want to be anywhere else in that moment, they wanted to stay here forever listening to Harry's slow breaths and being wrapped up and held by someone they... loved? Yeah, someone they loved.
tw: brief mention of abuse, depression, anxiety and PTSD
Harry hummed. "I am?"
"You will actually be the reason I go insane." Ron muttered as he got up and stood behind Harry. "Please enlighten me, dearest Harry, on what is not perfect because I sure as shit can't see anything."
"Harry has been missing for a while and the chance that he's still alive is very slim."
"Were either of you at this party last night?"
"Your mum, dad, Sirius and Remus, right?" Draco asked. Their eyes narrowed for a moment before they quickly stuck their hand out and held it to Harry's neck, catching the snitch tattoo. "Found it."
Later that night, Draco had composed the perfect letter and was ready to post it:
Draco had decided to go home for Christmas in his 8th year to keep his mother company and see how she was doing. Draco had pondered over whether he should go home or stay at Hogwarts with his boyfriend, Harry Potter. Harry was actually the one to push him to go home for Christmas. Draco knew he had to see his mother at some point but he wasn't too sure about going back so soon after school had started. He had spent all summer away from the manor and many people thought that Draco couldn't wait to go back but, actually, Draco was a bit scared to go back. So many bad memories were held in that house, but Draco had to go back to see his mother.
Draco and Harry slowly leant forward, smirks on both their faces. They heard several people gasp as their lips crashed together. Harry thought he heard Hermione scream a little. Harry placed his hands in Draco's hair as Draco explored the his mouth. The kiss lasted for about fifteen seconds before thy both broke away breathless.
"What's this?" Harry asked.
"Pansy did it for me when she was practicing to become a licensed tattoo artist." Draco ran their hands through their hair. "She knew I hated the mark so she did what she could to take attention away from it. I forget the mark is even there sometimes because the flowers are so beautiful."
Draco opened it slowly. When he had finished taking the wrapping paper off, his eyes filled with tears as he reasoned what the green woollen fabric was that lay in his lap. He picked it up and there was his own Weasley Jumper. It was a forest green with a grey D on the front of it. Everyone had fallen silent, they were all smiling.
"'Mione said that girl she's been seeing is coming over to travel with the rest of us too."
Luna stared at the two for a moment before nodding and smiling.
"Yep, that's perfect."
Draco hummed happily to themselves as they drove into the centre of town. Shopping had always been a favourite pastime of Draco's so they knew all the best shops and where to get the best clothes. Draco took pride in their fashion sense, often calling it their only personality trait. Which, in Draco's opinion, was true.
The obnoxious light from the city below drowned out most of the stars in the sky but a few were visible. Draco wished more stars were visible, he loved to stargaze. Finding patterns created by the stars helped distract Draco and take his mind off of things. He briefly debated going to the park but decided against it as it was three in the morning and Draco didn't fancy getting murdered.
Draco sent the letter and feverishly awaited a reply. He wondered if he would look even prettier with lipstick on as well. Draco imagined what it would be like to wear his eyeliner and lipstick out there. He would surely get made fun of, he could almost hear the giggles and muffled whispers that definitely would occur if he publicly wore makeup. Someone would almost definitely tell his father and that could not happen. His father constantly reminded him that the Malfoy's have a reputation to uphold and Draco didn't want a repeat of what happened when his father found him with nail polish on. Draco wondered if it would ever be okay for him to go out wearing nail polish and makeup.
"Uh... ye-," Draco's voice broke, the lie that once stood at the tip of their tongue gone. "No."
"Draco, we're going out to make a snowman, not on an expedition to the artic."
"Harry?" Draco asked as they were walking out of the shop.
"It's okay. Just don't do it again." Draco returned Harry's hug. "To make sure you don't do it again, let's go out and buy some bloody tinsel."
Draco rolled his eyes before making his way out of the Great hall and across the grounds of Hogwarts. He needed somewhere where no one would find him. Usually he could rely on a bathroom or his dorm room being empty but it was a Saturday morning and there were no lessons which meant everyone would be everywhere.
"I know who Hermione's girlfriend is." Harry smirked.
Harry respected and admired Draco for feeling confident enough to wear what they wanted. Harry could always respect someone who broke social norms and ignored the stereotypes and stigma. It was quite refreshing, Harry thought, seeing someone who didn't give two fucks what society thought.
"Hold this." Malfoy shoved a small mirror into Harry's hand.
"Okay." Draco pressed a quick kiss to Harry's cheek before heading off in Pansy's direction.
"That's a secret."
"Malfoy!" Harry called out.
No, no, no. Draco wouldn't do that to him. Harry recalled something Draco had told him once, that he liked to be fashionably late so he could make an entrance. That was it, Draco was going to show up, he was just being fashionably late. All Harry needed to do was just wait a little bit long-
Ron pulled Harry up and took him into the living room, talking as they went.
"To show that little bitch over there that you're mine and not his." Harry looked smugly over in the guys direction.
Draco took a deep breath and knocked on the door. It was opened by a large, grotesque looking man. Vernon Dursley.
"Draco, what are you doing here?" She asked, surprised.
Draco watched Harry expectantly and laughed to themselves when Harry met their gaze and shook his head.
Ron had been like this all week, pestering Harry about who he was going to ask to the ball. Harry was at his wits end now, he was struggling to put up with Ron's whining and bitching about how Harry's 'so boring because there has to be at least one person he liked'. Even Hermione couldn't help, or more like wouldn't. When Harry first denied he wasn't going to and hadn't asked anyone to the ball, Hermione just rolled her eyes and said 'sure' before walking off and ever since then, she's looked at Harry with a knowing glint in her eyes.
"What if we never find him?" Luna asked.
"I would love to go on a date with you."
"What's wrong?" Pansy asked.
"Hey."
"Well, I'm happy for you, Harry. As long as you're happy, I'm happy." Hermione said, smiling.
"You're part of the family now, mate. We can see how much you love Harry and that you two are gonna be together forever. Also, you became my brother and everyone's brother over the summer. We all love you." Ron said softly.
"Why do you sound surprised?" Draco stopped chewing on the cookie. "Should I be scared?"
"Yeah." Draco mused. "It would've been."
Harry sighed, he needed to go to dinner but he really didn't want to wipe the kiss off of his neck. Instead he just covered it with a glamour and hoped nobody would notice. Harry hurried down to dinner and tried his hardest not to make eye contact with Malfoy as he sat down and ate.
True, the meeting was difficult to sit through but it wasn't why Draco was on the verge of breaking down. The meeting was a small inconvenience that weighed him down slightly compared to the real reason why Draco really wanted today to be over with.
"Those were the good times." Ginny chuckled, lightly.
"You want to be single though." Harry pointed out.
Draco's thoughts were interrupted by a whining noise coming from the alley he was walking past. Draco stopped and looked down the alley. He couldn't see anything, maybe he was imagining things. It had been a long day at work and Draco was tired. He was about to turn around and leave when he heard it again. A tiny, high pitched whine coming from further inside the alley. Draco walked into the alley and stopped when he was sure the whining noise was next to him. Draco pulled out the torch in his phone and searched around. Then he saw it, a tiny head poking out of the snow. Draco picked up the creature and there in his arms was the freaking cutest, tiniest puppy he had ever seen.
Draco sighed before making his way to the quidditch changing rooms. He knew no one had practice and it was unlikely anyone would be training this early on a Saturday morning. He walked in, checked that no one was in there before stripping off and jumping in the shower. Draco needed a shower and there was no point in not having one when there were showers directly in front of his. Draco accioed a towel and a change of clothes before stepping out. He dried himself and got changed into a pair of black jeans, a black belt and a black, long sleeve turtleneck. He dried his hair until it was slightly damp and let it flop over his face.
"Okay." Harry placed his parchment on the floor to make room for Draco on his bed.
"Do I?" Malfoy whispered, taking a step closer to Harry. Their bodies practically touching.
Harry didn't say anything and pulled Draco into a long kiss. Draco pulled away at the end of the kiss a little breathless.
god fucking damnit
Draco knew enough time had passed for someone to be able to take Harry to Scotland where Hogwarts was. There was so many places in and around Hogwarts Harry could be. The shrieking shack, the forbidden forest, the room of requirement.
Seamus owned this warehouse in Manchester that he mainly used for storage. Draco wasn't sure if he'd inherited it or bought it but it was the perfect place to hide someone.
"Yes?" Draco prompted, trying to get Potter to form and actually sentence.
Draco sighed before looking at everyone. He met everyone's eyes as he sat up. Was he alright? Draco wasn't sure if he could lie anymore. It was obvious from his appearance that he was anything but alright. His eyes were bloodshot and his under eyes were so dark. His hair was always messy and Draco was sure he'd lost quite a bit of weight.
"Draco, you know they're going to make you talk about it, right?" Hermione asked.
"Fuck you."
"What for?"
Draco had no idea where he wanted to go, so he just walked, letting his feet carry him to wherever they desired. Draco was so lost in his own head that he didn't realise where he was headed until he stopped walking and found himself in the forest. He was at his and Harry's place and Draco knew that right now, this was the place he needed to be. Away from their flat, away from other humans, away from everything.
"Who are you calling?" Hermione asked.
"Personal achievement. Yay!" Harry muttered sarcastically.
Draco watched Harry get changed and jump into bed.
This had to be his own little secret.
Harry picked up their kitten and went up to his and Draco's room. Harry had found her wandering the streets when she was around 8 weeks old. She was a tiny grey tabby and Harry assumed she was the runt of her litter and got abandoned. Harry took her home and Draco immediately fell in love. They decided to name her Belle.
Harry found it funny that if he had made a different decision he wouldn't be here now. If he had decided to write that potions essay instead of going out for an early morning practice, his fate would've been written in different ink. Because if he was sat here in a different universe, without Draco by his side, he would have never become complete.
As they turned a corner, it almost seemed as if nothing had changed as the castle came into view. It looked just as majestic and royal as Harry had always remembered. The turrets stood tall and proud in the sky and hundreds of unlit lanterns lined the grey stone. Nothing could ever take away the magic of the castle.
"Right, can I go please? I'm going to be late because of you wrestling me to the ground over Christmas socks." Draco asked, a little annoyed.
"Also, Dean, when you next see Seamus can you tell him Harry's missing."
Harry sat bolt upright and started at Draco is disbelief and shock. "You don't know what an advent calendar is?"
"Pansy, what the fuck is this?" Draco asked through clenched teeth. "Why can't I move?"
"Well, you can't. You have to wait until tomorrow. It's the rules."
The two boys stood like that for a while as they watched the sun set quickly over the mountain. Draco cast a tempus and saw they had an hour and a half to get back for dinner. They knew they had to get back in time otherwise McGonagall would send out the entire wizarding world to look for them. That was not an exaggeration. The two boys entwined their hands together. Harry brought Draco's arm over his shoulder and looked up at the boy and smiled. Draco pressed a gentle kiss to Harry's forehead before walking back, their footprints engraved into the snow only to be covered by fresh snow, getting rid of any trace the two boys were there.
"We've checked everywhere he could be Nev."
Draco looked at Harry to look for signs that he was joking and upon realising that Harry was completely serious, burst out into laughter. Harry struggled not to laugh with Draco because their laughter was so infectious.
Draco clicked the call button and lifted the phone to his ear. He couldn't help but raise his hopes at each dial, hoping maybe this would be that last one and he'd hear a voice. Draco felt his heart sink when the prerecorded message came one.
"I love you Draco, and that's all that matters."
"Alright. Well, here we are."
"Thank you."
Harry laughed to himself as he set down his phone and turned back to the show he and Ron were watching. Ron glanced at him from the side and fake gagged.
this is like the most cliche christmas one shot but i like it
"Parks, shops, alleyways, gardens, everywhere Blaise. We've been everywhere."
Draco looked down at Harry. Panic was evident in Draco's eyes but his eyes widened in realisation before moving closer to Harry. Harry felt relieved that Draco recognised him and trusted him enough to get them out of this situation.
"Seems that way."
Draco parked their car and headed towards one of their favourite shops. They wondered what they would do if they happened to bump into Harry, not that it was going to happen but a person could dream. Should they apologise for kissing him on the cheek? No, you shouldn't apologise for something you're not sorry for. Get his number. That's what Draco should do. Get Harry's number.
"Hermione Granger." Pansy said, before smirking and quickly running out of the flat.
A wave of chatter spread across the Great Hall. Everyone seemed excited, the 8th years in particular. Though none of them like balls that much, they all knew this is exactly what they needed. As the 8th years filtered back to their shared common room, everyone was talking about who they were going to ask. Hermione and Ron were obviously going together and Neville had already asked Hannah Abbott who said yes. Neville had the biggest grin on his face for the whole day.
"Merry Christmas, Mother." Draco squeezed his mother gently.
"There's only a few places around Ginny's he could've gone. There's two parks and a shopping centre." Ron said.
Draco couldn't put up with it anymore. Pansy's voice was beginning to sound like nails on a chalkboard that never fucking ended. At this point, Draco was seriously considering avarda kedavraing himself because anything would be better than Pansy pestering twenty four fucking seven.
"So, you're like my fiancé now." Draco stated, smiling.
Draco detached themselves from Harry and took a cookie. "At least you didn't burn the kitchen down."
Harry choked. Not only was it
"Damn." Belle ran her fingers gently over the fabric. "Maybe I should find myself a Harry."
"Yeah, teach me how to play the easiest Christmas song." Harry said.
"This is for me?" Draco whispered.
"Okay. So we are going to need the address of the house where the party was held and a guest list so we can question people but firstly, does he have any relatives we can contact?" The officer asked.
"Aw, Dray. Thank you so much." Harry ran over to give Draco a hug.
He was so caught up in replaying the earlier events that he failed to notice footsteps approach him.
Draco didn't show his love for Christmas in public. He never wore a Christmas jumper, or anything Christmassy for that matter. Harry had tried time and time again to get Draco to wear anything Christmassy but Draco point blank refused every single time. One time, Harry had snuck some Christmas socks into Draco's sock drawer but later, he found the socks in their bed with a note next to them saying
"How could you forget about that? We almost burned down the school." Draco didn't look so fondly upon that memory.
Draco couldn't believe the words coming out of this woman's mouth. How dare she try and imply that Harry ran away? Draco felt the anger begin to build up, frustration was leaking into his veins.
Draco's heart was pounding. This could be his chance. He could ask him to the ball.
"It's nothing." Draco said.
"This is the best way to get them to reveal their feeling for each other." Pansy gave Hermione a high five.
"Okay." Harry smiled at Draco. "So I refer to you as they/them, right?"
With that, Harry took his face out of the fire and saw Draco trying to drag a smallish box across the floor.
"Why are you up?" Draco asked softly.
"Harry, mate, you really need to get a grip." Seamus said.
"You're a boy then. What shall we name you? I should probably leave that to Harry, I'll just call you... Bud for now. Okay, Bud?" Draco gently stroked the puppy behind his ears.
"Oh please, enlighten me, why the fuck did he deserve to be beaten and raped? Please, go ahead, explain."
"Hey Harry." Draco called out.
"Well, I went up to someone and said 'would you like to go to the ball with me?'. It was quite simple really." Harry was so done with this conversation. Everyone knew he was done as well because his sass was beginning to come through and everyone knew that Harry was so done when the sass came out.
"Harry...,"
Harry walked into his and Draco's flat with the bag behind his back.
"They could be using... uh, shit what's it called..." Ron clicked his fingers a few times, trying to remember. "A mislocator! Shit, yes, they'll be using a mislocator which is why magical tracking can't pick anything up!"
Ron gasped, scandalised. "You what?"
"That's so funny. You forgot to tell us." Pansy laughed.
Draco couldn't help but wonder if he felt so frustrated now because he had let it all build up. He wondered if he let his sadness drown out the fact that he was angry and confused and it had been building up over time and now they were stuck, it had finally decided to show up.
"Ah, I suppose you wouldn't know." Draco cringed because they knew they would have to use Belle's deadname when explaining and they really hated doing that, knowing how uncomfortable it made Belle feel whenever her deadname was mentioned. "Uh, well Belle is transgender. Her dead name is Blaise."
"Oh, um, he's just been really sick recently so he hasn't left the apartment." Draco's voice wavered. He didn't want to tell the truth because that would just lead to questions and Draco really didn't want to answer any more of those.
"No you don't."
"I don't do Christmas jumpers."
"Stop crying." Draco chuckled softly as they reached up and wiped away a few of Harry's tears.
"The ones up until 2011 are a little boring. They're okay but not the best but after 2011, they really start to pull on your heartstrings. If you don't cry at at least one of these adverts, I will deem you as having no heart."
"Such a mean boyfriend." Draco mumbled into Harry's shoulder.
"Okay, see you in there."
"What's wrong?" Harry asked, pushing strands of hair out of Draco's face. "Talk to me."
"Hang on." Ron said before his eyes went wide and he pointed at Draco. "You know who 'Mione's girlfriend is too? Wait... oh my god, you were his inside source!"
"Deal."
"I swear I've never cried this much in my life before." Draco said.
God, Harry loved them so much.
"Oh yeah, sorry." Harry held up the other end of the tree and followed Draco into the living room.
"Yes!" Harry whispered to himself.
"Where's your other half? I haven't seen him around recently."
"Hm?" Harry turned to look up at Draco.
"Yes, I would like that." Draco whispered, smiling.
Draco followed Harry into their bedroom and got Harry's pyjamas and a fluffy sweater out of their wardrobe and chucked them to Harry.
"Right, okay. We'll send out a search party and aurors. Do you have any idea who might do this?"
"They're having a sale." Draco pointed to the 70% off sign in the window of his favourite muggle suit shop. "Please can we go in?"
He was going to scream in a moment. He was actually going to scream. Pansy had been non stop questioning him about who he wanted to go to the balk with and if he was going to ask anyone or if anyone had asked him. Draco never thought a person could annoy him this much, but here he was about to tear his hair out.
"You look sexy." Harry said, standing up and placing his hands on Draco's hips
He remembered how all his demons seemed to leave during that trip, and so did Harry's. Draco had never seen Harry look so at peace during that trip. It was Ron and Neville's idea and Draco couldn't be more thankful that they came up with it.
The group of friends slipped into a silence. It was more comfortable than before, now that everyone had said something and feelings were out there, it seemed everyone felt slightly more at ease. Everyone except Draco, that is.
Draco knew the answer to the first question but he didn't want to admit it. He couldn't admit it because then it would be true. His worst nightmare would become a reality and he wouldn't be able to escape it.
"I'm sorry but Mr.Shacklebolt is busy all day." The receptionist said without even lifting her head.
"Yep." Ron replied. "Now, open it."
"Draco."
"It was so cute at the end." Draco gushed.
"Fucking hell, way to ruin the mood. And here I was thinking we were going to have a heart to heart." Harry laughed, lightly hitting Seamus's arm.
"I love you too, more than you could ever know." Harry whispered back.
"I need to talk to you." Harry rubbed the back of his neck nervously.
Luna's uncle owned a cabin in the middle of the Lake District, it was empty most of the time. Draco reminded when everyone went on a trip together and they all stayed in that cabin. It was pretty much in the middle of nowhere and a good place to hide someone.
"Would you like to dance?"
"Alright, well, I'll talk to you later."
"15 minutes."
"I was going to do this tomorrow on out anniversary but now seems like a better time. Harry James Potter. You are literally my favourite person in the world and I genuinely can't live without you. I love you so much and this is basically me saying that I've grown very attached and asking that you never leave me because I love you, a lot. So, Harry James Potter, will you marry me?"
"Funnily enough Ron, it's still a secret and a secret means I'm not going to tell you." Harry said. Ron opened his mouth but Harry cut him off before he could speak. "And if you ask me one more time, I will actually go and find Voldemort and ask him to kill me."
"Before you go, you might wanna sort out your little problem down there." Harry smirked.
Lily, James, Sirius and Remus. Harry had lost four parental figures in his lifetime and Draco couldn't even begin to imagine how that felt. Draco wondered if they knew what was happening right now, if they were praying for his safety. Draco wondered if they felt the same amount of pain he did. They couldn't do anything to help, they had to watch the searches for Harry and they couldn't do anything themselves.
"Thank you, Hermione. For everything." Draco said.
Draco could only smirk as Potter ran out of the changing room, he had Harry exactly where he wanted him.
"Yep. Neville took us all here when it first opened and I thought it would be fun." Harry smiled at the slight sound of wonder in Draco's voice
Then there was the 'Are you okay?'. Every time he walked into someone he knew, that bloody question was asked. If Draco had a pound for every time someone asked him that, he'd be a fucking millionaire. Draco was sick of that question, actually, no, he was sick of answering that question, sick of lying. He just wanted to scream 'No, of course I'm not okay! Why the fuck would I be okay?' but instead he lied, whether it was a simple 'I'm fine' or 'I'm holding up as best as I can', it was always a lie. Draco was falling apart, little pieces kept falling away but he never took the time to come to terms with that. He never took a moment for himself, he didn't let himself cry, he didn't allow himself to breathe.
"Yep. Problem?"
"I though it was a look. You really rocked the no eyebrow thing."
"What's in the box?" Neville asked.
Draco nodded before bringing his head up. He looked down and saw deep, red scratches on his chest, he couldn't remember where they came from. He ran his fingers over the scratches and winced slightly. Draco caught a glimpse of himself in the TV screen. His eyes were swollen and red, still glistening with tears. His under eyes and cheeks were tear stained and damp from the previous onslaught of tears. Draco brought his hand to his face to wipe his tears, he discovered that his hand was shaking unceasingly. He dried his eyes before staring at both of his hands, willing them to stop shaking but they wouldn't.
Harry smiled gently at Draco before opening his own calendar. Harry got a little square of chocolate wrapped in a snowman wrapper.
Draco took his cup from the tray. He studied it briefly before bringing it up to his lips. He took a small sip before taking a bigger one. When Draco put the cup down, he had a line of cream along his upper lip. Harry laughed softly and wiped it away with a napkin.
Harry scooped up Belle in his arms and walked into the living room where Draco was sitting.
"No, 'Mione, you don't get it." Harry turned to face Hermione and looked at her in the eyes. "I'm
"I mean, the last time I tried to cook, I ended up in hospital." Harry cringed at the memory. "With no eyebrows."
Everyone immediately backed away, looks of guilt and regret on their face.
Draco just nodded, a single tear sliding down his cheek.
Three months of pain.
Draco made his way over to Pansy who was desperately motioning him to come over. He was still unsure about how they felt about everything, the makeup, him coming with Harry...
And as Draco's feelings for Harry grew stronger and stronger, so did his feelings for makeup. He always wore his eyeliner and lipstick at any chance he got. Draco found himself watching intently when anyone around him put makeup on and he always made excuses to be in Pansy's room in the morning when she was applying her makeup. He wanted to learn about it so he knew how to do it when he could get his hands on some more.
"Merry Christmas, Dray."
Draco put the coat on and inhaled the familiar scent of pine and cinnamon. Draco missed the scent and sometimes sprayed Harrys cologne to make it seem, albeit just for a moment, that Harry had recently left the flat and was coming home very soon.
Draco looked down at Harry. Sunlight that broke in from the windows of the ambulance lit up Harry's beautiful features. Draco felt his heart accelerate and his vision blur as Harry smiled a smile that spoke a thousand words. Draco brought his hand up to meet Harry's and leant further into the touch. Harry was here. Whole. Alive.
"Draco. I can't help having a coughing fit."
"Do you wanna watch Shrek whilst they're cooking?" Harry asked.
Well, Draco let them catch up to him. He knew that he needed his friends right now, he didn't trust himself to be alone with his thoughts. Especially not today. He had managed to push away the importance of today, only knowing it would make him so upset but now it's all he could think about.
Draco slowly leant forward and caught Harry in a passionate kiss. Their lips locked together perfectly. The kiss was everything, full of love, full of magic. The two boys pulled apart breathless and Harry leant into Draco. Harry was quite a bit shorter than Draco and Draco loved it. He could give Harry forehead kisses whenever he wanted. Harry also loved it, he loved the forehead kissed form Draco, he loved the fact that he could snuggle into Draco but his favourite was when the two boys hugged as Harry could feel Draco's heart slowly beating.
Draco released Harry to go and hug his mother.
"Hey, Dray?"
"Well, you're hot so at least you've got that going for you." Draco said, smoothly.
Draco smiles softly at his mother. "Let's not be sad. It's Christmas Eve after all."
It was after dinner when Harry decided to seek out Malfoy. It didn't take long to find him but Pansy and Blaise were stood on either side of him. Harry groaned internally but he knew he had to do something.
Three months of Harry not coming back awake.
Draco put his hand in his pocket and fiddled around with the small velvet box. Today was supposed to be his and Harry's day, it was supposed to be one of the best days of their lives. Draco took the box out of his pocket and heard a few gasps. He rolled it between his fingers before opening it.
"Ron, the last time I listened to you, I didn't have any eyebrows for a month." Harry deadpanned.
Everyone else lifted up their head to look at Harry. He thumped his hand against that table before grabbing his neck. He was starting to turn blue.
Draco didn't even know how long it had been until the screams had stopped. He wanted to scream but he couldn't, he couldn't physically produce the breath to scream anymore. Draco was silent but the tears still streamed down his face and his body still shook with every silent sob that ripped through Draco's body.
"Hm, just try to concentrate on the potion a bit more. Clean your cauldron and start again. I trust you won't make a mistake again." Slughorn said.
Harry heard Ron say something about waiting around the corner for them but he didn't pay attention as he was too caught up in the way a light pink colour was settling over Draco's cheeks. Harry took a step closer to Draco and lifted his hand and placed it against the side of the face, gently running his thumb down the side if their face. Draco leaned into the touch and a small, content sigh escaped their lips. It was a small gesture but it said everything that needed to be said in that moment.
Draco sat down and looked at the floor before speaking. "So, Slytherin have this christmas tradition that involves me and Pansy."
"I came to tell you about my date."
"What do you think?" Malfoy said, quietly.
"Drop the bullshit. I know you couldn't give two shits that Harry is missing." Draco spat.
"Hey Dray. I'm in the living room."
Harry spent a few more moments just looking at Draco and appreciating the person he had in front of him. Harry couldn't imagine a life where he wasn't completely and utterly in love with them. Harry's smile only grew wider as he turned and nodded to Neville.
"They were but they broke up shortly after the war because they both came to terms with their sexualities. Ron is aromantic and Hermione is homoromantic and demisexual." Harry explained. "You know, now that I think about it, I don't actually think I have any straight friends."
"It's so cold. Oh my god." Harry was running on the spot, trying to get all the snow to fall out.
"Oh my god."
"Oh, I almost forgot. We made cookies for everyone." Harry ran into where the mini kitchen was and brought out a massive plate of cookies.
"No, not having it." Harry said, bluntly.
A snowflake falling gently caught Harry's eye. He looked up to see thousands of snowflakes twirling down from the sky. Harry smiled softly.
"I know you've been wanting it for ages and I thought you could wear it for the Hogwarts reunion coming up." Harry rubbed the back of his neck.
Harry spun around upon hearing his full name and saw Draco on one knee with an open box containing the most elegant ring he'd ever seen.
Draco heard Harry left gently before a final snowball hit his head.
"Oh Harry." Draco whispered to himself. "Merlin, I miss you so much. I didn't think it was possible to love someone so much but, you came along. I wish you were here with me. It's hard being back here. I try to cover it up from mother as best as I can because I need to be strong for her. But right now, I'm finding it hard to be strong for myself. I just want you to hold me and tell me everything's alright. You should be here Harry, we should be sharing our first Christmas together. I love you, Harry. So fucking much. Merry Christmas, my love."
and Harry was sure he fell even more in love with the person walking towards him.
Draco could hold the heartbreak no longer and he fell into Hermione's arms in a disheveled heap as his grief poured out in a flood of uncontrollable tears. Draco shut his eyes as gut-wrenching sobs punched through, ripping through his muscles, bones, and guts causing him to clutch his stomach. He tried to repress the sobs but he couldn't, nothing was okay.
"Oh Merlin. Draco you're such and idiot." Blaise laughed.
Pansy had been there since the beginning. Draco was so thankful to have her in their life. Even just having one person who accepts you makes all the difference, and Draco knew this. Without Pansy, Draco wasn't sure if they would even be alive today. She had helped them through their darkest times, never wavering and always standing by Draco. She was Draco's ride or die.
Harry was so fucked.
"Me too, babe." Draco sighed and went over to Harry.
"The slimy git didn't tell me anything. I cannot believe you two have the audacity to stand in my presence and not tell me who 'Mione is seeing." Ron said dramatically as he folded his arms.
Draco watched with an unimpressed stare as Harry gently placed them down and began stripping his clothes in order to get ready for bed.
"I only have eyes for you, baby." Draco pulled Harry close to him and into a spin.
They both sat in the living room opening gifts from each other, family and friends. Lots of wrapping paper later, Draco handed his mother one last present. It was a small box shape covered with a silver, snowflake wrapping paper. Narcissa gently took the wrapping paper off to reveal a green velvet box. She gently opened it and gasped at its contents.
"Merry Christmas, Draco!" Narcissa said happily before pulling Draco into a hug.
"I will."
"And thirdly, they called me a boy. I, uh, I'm non-binary, I've been out since seventh year, and it makes me really uncomfortable when someone's uses he/him pronouns or calls me a boy."
"What?" Draco asked.
Draco nodded his head in response.
"It's stunning."
Narcissa nodded her head.
Draco smirked and bit his lips as he watched Potter's gaze flick from his lips to his eyes. It seemed like the roles had reversed, Potter being the one who wanted to run away. Potter opened his mouth and closed it without saying anything, once again his gaze flicking from Draco's eyes to his lips.
"No problem Harry."
"Oh, Draco. How are you?" Molly asked, leading Draco to the sofa.
"Harry James Potter."
"Thank you, Ron." Hermione whispered.
Draco loved Harry so much, he didn't even know how to put it into words. He loved him so much it hurt. Draco could stare at Harry for the rest of his life and never get bored. Harry was Draco's everything and what are you supposed to do when your everything is gone? It's one of those things that you subconsciously pray never happens to you. You never expect it to happen to you, which is why we don't know how to cope. We're not prepared for something like this happen, we don't know what we're supposed to do in this situation. You feel helpless. That's exactly what Draco felt, helpless. He didn't know what he could do to find Harry. He didn't even know if Harry was alive or dead.
Draco cradled the puppy close to him to try and warm it up as he made the 10 minute walk to the vets. The puppy still was shaking by the time he reached the vets.
Draco, Hermione and Ron's voices overlapped each other as they informed everyone that Harry was missing. Draco hung up the phone and placed his head in his hands. God, he was going to have to go to the ministry and say it again. Draco couldn't even imagine himself saying those words again.
Draco and Harry were both ill. Very ill. They had contacted a bug that at first made them vomit their guts out, then have extreme pain in their stomachs, then pounding headaches, then more vomit, now a really bad cold. They were both coughing, sneezing and unable to breath out of their noses. Madame Pomfery had them in quarantine for for the most of it but it seemed like they were getting better so she let them into the 8th years common room. She had put a charm on it so everyone else could leave but them. All the students stayed away from them anyway so there wasn't much point in going back to the common room.
"What?" Hermione seemed taken aback by the bluntness of the question.
"Yeah, and this stays between us." Ron said, glaring at the others. "Come on, we need to get going."
"Yeah, um, I was just wondering if you or Ron had heard from Seamus recently?"
"Basically, when I was making the pudding, I might have dropped a tiny trinket in the mixture and forgot to tell everyone that I had put it in." Draco said.
The red scratches on his chest from when he broke down were a constant reminder of how painful this was for Draco. A constant reminder of how sometimes he just wanted to rip his heart out so he could be free from it for just a moment. The amount if times Draco had been kneeling over the toilet because it hurt too much scared him.
"You just did."
"I wasn't aware this was a Draco slander event." Draco crossed their arms and pouted slightly.
"Watch it, Potter or you won't get to see my fashion show."
"Starting to like ice skating now?"
This was very true. It was clear to basically everyone that Astoria had a giant crush on Draco and it was also clear to everyone that Draco hated Astoria with every fibre of his being but somehow, Astoria didn't manage to pick up on that. She was so annoying and always seeked for Draco's approval on everything and it drove Draco around the bloody bend.
"I need to speak to Harry, it's important."
"Draco, talk to me. Please." Hermione said.
"You did that on purpose." Draco stormed upstairs.
"Yeah, yeah. I just... wasn't expecting that, I suppose." Draco gave Harry a small smile. "Thank you. I really appreciate it."
Harry gave Ron a flat look. "You're literally just complaining." He deadpanned.
"Yes."
Harry hummed. "Depends if 'Mione wants to apparate or floo."
"No-ones seen him since last night." Ron said.
Harry got up and headed to the library. He knew Draco would be there, he was always there. At the start of their 8th year, Harry and Draco started dating. After years of hiding their feelings and forcing themselves to be enemies, they finally revealed how they felt towards each other. They had been practically inseparable ever since.
Harry pressed play on the compilation and watched up to the 2012 advert. During the 2011 advert, a smile had made its way onto Draco's face.
"Fine, who do you want to go with then?" Ron asked.
Harry sat in silence for a moment. "I'll make a deal with you. I'll take it, if you let me wrap a present."
Malfoy pressed a gentle kiss to Harry's lips
"That was quite fun." Harry laughed.
"Well, that's my only suggestion." Pansy said.
"It's not that bad wearing a christmas jumper. It's not going to kill you!" Harry said, exasperated.
"Yes, boys?" Madame Pomfery said.

"You know how I was gonna do the thing tonight, I'm not sure anymore." Draco pulled out the box and started fiddling with it.
Seamus and Dean were sitting on a blanket, their sides pressed together, and talking to Ginny and Luna who had their pinkies interlocked. Ron had started talking to Neville and brought him into a hug, the two had gotten a lot closer after the war after they both came out as aromatic and asexual. Pansy and Hermione had walked over to Belle and that was the direction Draco was currently pulling him. Harry saw a few other familiar faces and made a mental note to go and say hello to everyone later.
"Thank you guys. It means a lot that you support me." Harry pulled them into a group hug. "Now, if you don't mind, I shall be going to find my beautiful date."
Harry held out his hand for Draco to take and felt a swarm of butterflies in his stomach when Draco laced their fingers together. Their hands were so soft, even though they felt dainty, Harry knew that those hands could move mountains.
"Right, let's get you to the vets mister. Or missus." Draco said.
"We did." Draco replied and placed a gentle kiss to Harry's lips.
"I have to be honest with you." Draco's mouth started to twist up into their famous smirk. "Out of all the places, a gay bar is not where I expected to run into you, Harry Potter."
Everyone moved into Hermione's living room where all of the furniture had been pushed against the walls, creating a big space in the middle of the floor. Harry felt his stomach drop as he realised they were going to be apparating. He was starting to feel bad for teasing Ron for hating appparating earlier when he himself hated apparating just as much, perhaps even more.
When Harry had finished, he finally felt like his and Draco's house was perfect. Everything was perfect. Harry knew that this was going to be one of the best Christmases ever.
"Yeah. I think I'll do it at home, after dinner." Draco said. "Oh, and Hermione, Merry Christmas."
"You take forever to get ready." Ron said, looking up from his phone.
Harry laughed quietly to himself before resting his head against his hand and staring up at Draco. Harry looked at Draco as if they were something else. He looked at Draco as if they were the sun, the centre of the solar system that everything else revolved around because they are so important and special. His eyes were the same too. There is a kind of green that comes only around springtime with fresh blades of grass and new flower buds, Harry's eyes were that bright colour, fresh and comforting.
Draco sighed and stood up. He needed to go for a walk, he hadn't been outside in a couple of days and some fresh air would probably help clear his mind. Draco got up, slipped some shoes on and reached out to put his coat on. He stopped before his hand could reach his own black coat and instead redirected his hand to one of Harry's coats. Harry was smaller than him so nearly all of Harry's clothes didn't fit Draco but he had this one coat that was oversized and it fit Draco perfectly.
Draco woke with a gasp, his had subconsciously resting over his heart. He had woken up like this for the past couple of days - a small pain running through his chest and his skin lightly covered with sweat. It's almost like he can feel Harry's pain and desperation.
"I swear if you wake me up anytime before half seven, I will hex you." Draco said.
"Dray, it's snowing." Harry whispered.
The two finished eating their dinner before retiring to the living room. The two shared a dance in front of the fire before going up to their own rooms. Draco got changed into his pyjamas and slid into bed.
"Dracoo." Harry whined. "Please."
"That's complete bullshit, Ronald Weasley, and you know it."
"That's me." Harry chuckled before his eyes lit up and he broke away from Draco. "Wait here for a moment."
Harry remembered exactly how it felt when it happened. It felt like he had literally ascended to heaven. What Harry would give for that to happen all over again, but this time, he would turn his head so Malfoy presses his red lips to Harry's lips.
"Can you still get me the chocolates please?" Draco asked in his most innocent voice.
Draco gave Harry a gentle push as he checked the time. "It's 7:29 Ron! I am this close to coming out there and hexing you're if you don't stop!"
Harry just smiled and carried on wiping away Draco's tears until they didn't fall anymore. Harry pulled them into a sweet kiss and rested his forehead against their own.
"Wait." Potter said, pulling Draco back so the two stood face to face.
"Alright, alright." Ron put his hands in the air. "Night everyone."
"Come on everyone." Hermione said. "Let's get going."
"What? No, I would never go that low."
"Great, you go find the decorations and I'll call Hagrid."
"Oh, Draco. I forgot to tell you, nice socks!" Harry called up the stairs.
"We haven't even had breakfast yet."
Draco slowed down and started walking, he didn't want to hurt Harry anymore than he already was. Everyone turned to look at Draco and their eyes immediately flicked to the unconscious figure being cradled by Draco. Everyone seemed to be in shock and no one moved for a few moments, just watching Draco walk with Harry in his arms, their mouth open slightly.
"Yes I do."
Draco let out a soft exhale and ran their hands through their hair. This night had been somewhat of a rollercoaster but Harry had been there to get them off in the end. If Draco thought about it, most things ended up leading back to Harry. Draco laughed softly to themselves, it was always going to be Harry. It had to be, no one else could light up Draco's emotions the way Harry could. No one else would be able to storm into their life and bring everything that Harry had managed to.
Hermione just nodded and put her arm around Draco's shoulder and walked him to the ambulance. The paramedics were already rushing over to meet Draco and they were putting masks and other equipment on Harry. Draco reluctantly passed Harry over to a paramedic. It annoyed Draco that they couldn't go to St. Mungo's but Harry was too weak to apparate and there were muggles around.
"Like what?"
"Don't worry about it." Harry chuckled.
"The wait will be worth it." Harry said.
"Yes, Ron. My hair is not working." Harry stood up and walked over to the rest of the boys in his dorm. "Look at this." He motioned to the strand that was sticking up. "Look at it. How the fuck am I supposed to get anything right when I can't even do my own hair? You'd think after having on my head for sixteen years that I would know how to deal with it, but no, that just can't happen can it?"
Over the summer, Draco had come to stay at The Burrow because the Ministry deemed it to be the safest place for Draco to go. Draco confessed later on that he wouldn't have gone back to the manor anyway, it held too many painful memories. On the first day Draco arrived, they both agreed to put aside their differences and their past and try to become friends. Harry and Draco had to share a room and more than often, neither of them could sleep so they stayed up all night talking. The two became close, really close. Harry realised he loved Draco and had done for a long time but he was too scared to act on his feelings. He had broken up with Ginny shortly after the war because he wasn't sure he loved her anymore. One evening, around halfway through the holidays, Draco took Harry for a walk and asked him to be his boyfriend. Harry was overjoyed and of course said yes. Since then, the two had practically been inseparable. It was clear to everyone that they loved each other with all they had. When they came back to Hogwarts, everyone was a bit shocked at first but now they were seen as the 'It' couple. Draco had also become quite close to the rest of the Weasley Family, he apologised for what he had said in the past and Molly scooped him up into a giant hug and forgave him.
Draco joined Neville in the lift up to the fourth floor.
"I'm sorry. If I knew you were going to miss it, I wouldn't have taken you out here."
"Are you serious Pans?" Draco was very annoyed.
"It's not about whether you do Christmas jumpers or not, it about embracing the festive spirit." Harry's voice was slowly becoming louder now.
"Welcome to the Weasley Family." Ron said, as he hugged Draco back.
"So what exactly is a John Lewis Christmas advert?" Draco asked.
"Right." Hermione clapped her hands. "Now introductions are over, lets get on with it."
"I can't." Harry smiled. "Plus, you're crying too." Harry placed a gentle hand on Draco's cheek, catching the falling tears.
"I need to go to that makeup shop in Hogsmeade you mentioned so I was wondering if you wanted to come with me?"
Harry's eyes widened and a brief look of shock and hurt passed through them. Harry remained silent as he took Draco's hand and led them to the mirror in their bedroom.
"Hahaha. Yes!"
It was a small beaded, black bracelet. Harry had given it to him when they first moved in together. Harry had a matching white one. Draco can remember the words so clearly when Harry held out his hand revealing the two bracelets.
"Yeah, yeah. A little help here, babe? It's quite heavy."
"Okay." Draco took the card and walked to the Aldi that was only 5 minutes walk from their house.
The taxi driver nodded and drove off. Draco couldn't help but think of the worst. As much as he tried to push those thoughts to the back of his mind, he couldn't. What was he supposed to do in this situation? Draco's head was spinning, he couldn't seem to rationalise anything. Draco was tapping his fingers against the door of the car, trying to distract himself.
"Yes it is, now shut up."
Ron drove as quickly as possible to Ginny's house. As soon as they stepped onto the pavement, the three began their search, looking in and behind every bush and hedge, up every tree, they checked in shops, down alleyways but Harry was nowhere.
"I'm joking. You always look beautiful, love." Harry murmured right next to Draco's ear, causing the tips of their ears to go pink.
"Yes, actually. Quite strongly."
"What are you? My mother?" Draco asked, moving the cushions off the sofa as they heard Harry getting the food.
