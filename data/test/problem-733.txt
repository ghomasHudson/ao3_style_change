“No one ever did,” he said, as if talking about something else entirely.
“Ah, well. I had little else to do, did I? White peacocks were fascinating enough for a four-year-old to chase after their tails. Even if sometimes the roles are reversed.”
Draco swallowed and just started with the nearest one.
Harry grinned and made to leave. Draco held him back by his elbow at the last minute.
The letters arrived next morning. The owl dropped them between plates of toast and sunny-side up, almost tipping over a glass of orange juice. Draco was just jotting down the seventh item on the shopping list when he was interrupted; the list was to be brought to the village by Potter and the items were to be purchased by Potter. Draco would no longer tolerate country boules and bitter coffee for breakfast.
The ceiling is still blank.
“We’re not making faces!” Ron argues.
“Yes.”
“Why did you not tell me they’re calling you back?”
Harry stared at him. For seven years Draco had not had the chance to look at him; now he couldn’t help but notice that his hair was longer, his shoulders were broader. His skin was darker, tanned from walking over the world under the sun. Harry looked like a man instead of a boy just out of his teenage years, green and knobby, which was how he had looked when they had first met. Clever, kind, wearing his emotions on his sleeves. Still a little shy. Good, a heart like gold.
Harry shrugs, curls himself on the couch and starts to read. Mr Darcy has just proposed to Elizabeth and, if he remembers correctly, is about to be rejected quite gruesomely. He picks up from where he left off and manages three pages—Elizabeth now angrily accusing Mr Darcy of being selfish and arrogant—when the kitten jumps from the bookshelf and lands on the arm of the couch. Loses its footing and slips, letting out a loud and startled
A wave of warmth rushed down his spine, soft and bubbly like Butterbeer. Tingled, and all around him was the scent of wood smoke, of cider. Draco let out a shuddery breath—a sigh. His shoulders, tense without his notice, relaxed. The warmth seeped into his bones, pushed loose the knots tight at his chest until it filled, gently, to the brim with the golden hue of distant happiness.
“The blizzards aren’t really at fault, you know. I think you were the one wandering about. If you wander about in London in the middle of a blizzard, I’m sure they’d be lethal, too.” Potter joked, looking up. “Speaking of this, you should thank the sheep. I only found you because I was trying to bring them to shelter. Ah, and Lettuce—she sniffed you out. Probably thought you were a piece of ham or something…”
Joe peeps over. “A new one?”
“Outrageous. Unbelievable.”
“Well, no. It’s a surprise. You know, when you’re not supposed to know about it until it actually happens?” Harry tugged Draco close, then his smile dropped. “You’re upset.”
Draco blushed faintly. Still, hearing it out loud made him want to shy away. “I like you.”
“I found it in Sirius’s bedroom.”
“We are,” he replies, a light hum.
Draco took it. The warmth of the mug soaked through his palms. Potter poured himself a mug, too, and leaned back into the couch. Gulped down a few drinks.
Draco felt himself coursing backwards through time. Several things clicked into place, slivers of memories blurred by speed: Harry pushing the parcel across the dining table, Harry leaning close to fix an earring to his ear, Harry hiding his face behind the mug of tea, saying,
She disappeared into the corridor. Draco finished his Panini—not because Pansy told him to, but because he meant to—and wiped his hands on a napkin, waiting for Pansy. He cleaned his fingers one by one, carefully, taking care of the thin gaps between finger pad and nail.
The kittens squirm to the shallow plate of food once Harry fills it. He sits back onto his heels and simply watches: a puddle of ever-flowing grey, orange and tabby marks, dotted with white ears and black tails. Their ears are still so tiny. Their paws, their noses, their chubby bodies—so tiny. They still feel like babies even though they will be ready for adoption in another day or two. He should start to put the signs up. His reputation is a lot of things, most of them bad, but for the kittens it’s of good use. So he uses it.
Harry’s face burns. Draco laughs, loud and bright like stars in the night.
Draco swallowed and looked away.
They didn’t stink much, really. The barn was warm and smelt more vaguely of animals, of the golden hay that layered the ground, of summer. Draco loosened the scarf. He’d wanted to come in his own clothes, but the disgust must have shown on his face—all the clothes cleaned only with a rough
Draco couldn’t help but feel the mark on his left forearm.
That night, Draco saw her again. Baking in his kitchen, cheek smeared with a white streak of flour. Bending down to check the oven, the apron folding in itself at her waist.
“Let me guess. Carbonara?”
“Never mind. Go take your shower.”
“Still taller.” Draco tilted his mug to his temple in a mock salute. “And a better cook, too. What are your excuses for that?”
It was quiet. The world around him seemed to have stopped breathing. He hadn’t been able to hear silence for years, not back in London. Now all there was left was his boots crunching against the snow.
“Err, it kind of happened accidentally last night.” Ron laughs. “So.”
“Any chance you got spices? Let me guess. No?”
“Shut up.”
It was snowing, then. Christmas Eve, and they were both drunk. The wireless was playing something sappy in the background. It made Harry want to cry, so he pushed all the furniture to the side instead and pulled Draco into a silly waltz. Draco laughed, and indulged him, and they stepped on each other’s feet every other second, and at last they kissed and fell onto the couch together. Half-way through, the new cat they adopted interrupted them by squeezing in between and pushing her paws onto their mouths, meowing loudly, demanding attention.
Still distant, Potter flicked his wand at the hearth. A small fire started, timid, logs crackling. Potter poked at the logs with a rusted iron. The wooden blocks tumbled, cracked, sent sparks flying. The fire grew until it warmed the air, warmed the room. Draco took a sip of hot chocolate. The rich sweetness lingered between his teeth.
“Those are very exquisite, I’ll have you know, takes a whole fifteen minutes to do one—”
Pansy was lounging on a stool by her kitchen bar, a martini in hand. She was still in her dressing gown even though it was already midday, but even so, she was sexy and elegant in a careless way.
He poured himself a mug of cider after dinner. He’d seen it in the market and, on impulse, decided to buy it. Leaning back onto the couch, sinking into the soft mattress, he let his rigid back stretch then relax, let loose his shoulders. He was to return to work tomorrow morning and he’d prefer not to think about it. He drank the cider cold, but it was all wrong. Not the tangy sourness bare at his throat, not the faint sweetness that lingered afterwards, clear like apples itself. The blandness of it made it hard to swallow. He dumped it into the sink and shut his eyes. Breathed through his nose. Poured himself whiskey instead.
Draco laughs. Turns his head, mumbles, “Whatever, Potter,” voice buried into the thin skin at Harry’s wrist—lips brushing. Shuffles closer, curls up against him. His body thin and bony but warm under the sheets, close enough to feel.
“That’s not—”
Draco wanted to help, wanted to tell Potter as much—but drifted back into sleep before he could, burrowed deep inside the warm cocoon of the quilt.
A soft ache bloomed in his sternum. He couldn’t name it, couldn’t grasp it, could only tighten his grip on the railing so his knees didn’t give. His knuckles turned white. In his mouth was the aftertaste of the bland cider. He shut his eyes, breathed harshly through his nose.
He had had to take the only available portkey left. After weaving through crowds on the streets in humid air, sweat gathering at his nape where his collar rubbed his neck raw, the cool air in the Ministry seemed all too silent, dead. Only after he’d arrived at Scotland did he realize that he had no idea where Harry’s cottage was located and therefore, could neither Apparate since the distance might be too far, nor take any other kind of transportation. It took him another four hours trying to communicate—first to the witch at the information center, then to anyone who passed him—the tiny village where he and Harry had been for Christmas. Finally a local farmer in khaki suspenders with a thick accent recognized where he was talking about and cheerily showed him the apparition points across a gigantic, yellowed map that took up a whole wall in the lobby. He clapped Draco on the back as he bellowed his farewells, voice blooming over the near empty lobby.
Draco cooked chicken with pesto sauce for dinner. Harry grinned when he saw. It was his favorite.
“It’s okay, love,” Draco whispers. Presses a kiss into his hair. “It’s okay.”
Molly the sheep came close still, determined to stand her ground in front of them. She had a pristine white mark that covered half of her black face like a masquerade mask. Potter reached out, scratched her head.
Harry laughs. “Have you seen us in our teens? We were worse.”
“Fucking…” Draco’s throat thickened. “Why can’t I move on?”
in the end. First, he sits onto the couch after his legs become sore, waiting, doing nothing—then at some point, he drifts off. He is standing in the middle of the field of sunflowers again. The bright yellow stretches on and on, fading into the horizon; the sky is soft, empty. He stares into the blankness and tries to fill it with something, anything. The warmth in the air, the faint scent of summer—he gazes into nothingness, the skyline so faraway and intangible, yet right in front of his eyes—
“Harry’s up to something,” Draco said.
Harry looked helpless. He reached out a hand—faltered—and, tentatively, touched Draco’s cheek.
A mere week later the reply arrived—rather fast, Draco remembered thinking—but it wasn’t from Harry.
He was met with silence so long that finally, he had to look up. Potter looked dumbstruck. His cheeks flushed; faint, but blushing nonetheless. Somehow that made Draco blush, too.
“We’re going to look for inspiration,” Harry declares, and opens the first one. The latest, which Draco owled him a week ago.
He was back at his flat in London again. The late summer breeze, soft and warm, filtered through the opened French windows to the balcony, blew the gauzy curtains heavy-bellied. Astoria was in the lounging chair with her back to him. She wore a thin, floral shirt that revealed her shoulders. Her hazel hair swept to one side, cascading down her neck.
But he is happy for them. They deserve happiness more than anyone else after everything he’d put them through. What kind of a friend does it make him if he isn’t?
“Gee.” He chuckled, incredulous. “How did you make it to your neck?”
“Yeah?”
“Your hands,” he explained. “They were sooty.”
“No, listen. It likes to climb onto your shoulders, right? Malfoy’s taller than you—it’s unfair, yes, but—but that’s the height he usually sees the world from. Right? From that angle.” Ron takes a sip of his wine and points at Harry with his glass. “That’s why it climbs onto your shoulders so much.”
“And you are a shameless flirt,” Draco said, stunned, his face flooding with heat. He stumbled back. “Next time you’ll plant a kiss on my mouth when I’m not paying attention.”
Ron shrugs and heads into the kitchen. “Just asking, is all.”
Draco looked away, squirming.
“You and your hilarious jokes.” Draco rolls his eyes. “Ha, ha, ha.”
Draco sat at the far corner of the couch, his knees drawn to his chest. Stared, unblinkingly, into midair. His eyes were sore from all the crying, puffed. It was as if his mind had left his exhausted body, and now he couldn’t control it. Couldn’t move his limbs. Couldn’t feel.
When he finally woke up, daylight had already brightened the cottage. The air was cold. Draco pushed himself up, stretched his rigid legs and sore back, groaning. Cracked his neck. A small fraction of the sky, framed by the windows, was blank. The sign of a blizzard.
Harry dozes off, catches himself, and wakes up again.
“Thank you,” Draco said quietly. They had been staring at each other for too long, the air strained tight. He touched a finger to the leather straps. “Yes. I love it.”
“Okay?” he murmured. Harry nodded again, closed his eyes. Dropped his head to Draco’s shoulder.
“Because there is nothing wrong with moving on. I have never seen you this happy. Don’t tell me you haven’t noticed yourself, or
“Which part? The part where we pushed all the furniture away so we could dance,” Harry asks slowly, “or the part where we still bumped into them every two minutes?”
No one came.
“I’m sorry,” Potter said a while later. “I didn’t know—”
Draco stretched his legs alongside Potter’s just to show his were longer. Their ankles touched. Potter was wearing the pair of socks with the tiny broomsticks again.
was on the tip of Draco’s tongue. He swallowed it. “I’ll catch you in the barn.”
The kitten steps onto Harry’s stomach—Harry grunts—and journeys to his chest. Harry scratches the soft tufts of fur at its neck, smoothing his hand down its spine.
It took Potter fifteen minutes to stuff his arms with sweaters, trousers, coats, and woolen socks as Draco continued to babble, lamenting his dissatisfaction over the absence of prior notice and demanding an answer to
So much for dating.
The kitten meows innocently.
Potter let out a laugh, looked away. His cheeks looked warm. “Good,” he mumbled, “good.”
The silence was a thing of its own, a hush not to be broken. So Draco watched Potter as they walked. Watched his back swaying with each step he took, watched his hands stuffed in his pockets. Moonlight glinted off the back of his coat, softened it. Occasionally Potter looked over his shoulder, as if making sure whether Draco had followed.
“Cissy?”
“Do you…do you want to talk about it?”
She was slipping away.
Draco looked back at her again. Astoria was still looking at him, gaze unwavering—his smile fell. He brought the cup to his lips, looking away. “It’s just. I can’t…Merlin, this is weird.” He forced a laugh. “See, there was a time when I thought…when I believed there would be things in life that would continue. Something that would stay. Something that…wouldn’t change. And around this axis, I built my world. It’s alright if everything else changes as long as this one doesn’t. I only need—I only need one thing to be as it always is.” He smiled tightly. “A child’s logic, no doubt. Things change. The world knocked itself over, and for a while there was no axis. But then—but then there was, again. And it stayed for years. Then suddenly it…disappears, too. Everything I believed about it, everything I thought I had, everything I built around it…gone.” He took a deep breath, shaky. “And I can’t—I can’t dive in head first, Astoria, knowing some day it will disappear again. I can’t pour myself in knowing one day I can lose myself all over again. It’s too…it’s too much. I can’t. I can’t…go through it again, all of it. I—I can’t.”
“But how did you—” Potter started, cut himself off. Tried again. “How did you get all the ingredients, you’ve been…drawing, and—to brew, where did you even—”
“Learn me?” Harry asks. A laugh escapes from his chest. “Did you learn me as a kitten?”
“How much did you pay for this one?”
Harry toes off his shoes and, gingerly, follows Draco past the parlor. The air smells of a soft fragrance, smells faintly of something familiar…
“You already know that.”
His breath was a puff of white in front of him.
Potter sent a letter, wishing him a happy birthday. He didn’t even notice the date himself. The letters scrawled all over the place, messy and wild, nearly illegible, but Draco spent a good hour after work sitting at his dining table, his nose pressed close to the parchment, deciphering the words one by one. There were inquiries about how he was, whether his job position turned out fine, jokes about the cottage finally being quiet for once without all his rambling, and when was he coming back to cook stew again? He’d starve without his splendid meals, no doubt. Cissy was fine, Molly’s lambs stuck themselves in a fence (took him hours to get them out), Luna was eating a little less since she was old but she should be fine, too, still vigorous. By the way, Granger and Weasley visited with Rose and little Hugo. Enclosed were countless photos: Cissy sleeping in the barn, Fred-the-lamb bleating fiercely at the camera, Luna gazing into the distance as she flicked her tail and grazed. Baby Hugo, his face no longer all scrunched together but with large eyes and flushed cheeks instead, giggling with wonder. There was one of Potter, too, swinging Rose back and forth from underneath her armpits. Rose screamed with delight. Potter pretended to drop her once or twice and Granger, from the background, yelled as she strode forward while Weasley apparently laughed his head off, the photo wobbling.
It is always bittersweet to watch them go.
But it wasn’t about the money. Potter waved a hand, brushing him off. “It’s for you. A gift. You know, when someone willingly gives you something and doesn’t want anything in return?”
Potter couldn’t seem to stop laughing. “You chased peacocks quite often, then?”
Harry broke again. “Goddamn it, Draco!”
Worrying his bottom lip, Draco set his destination. He tucked off his boots and socks, rolled his trousers up to his knees. Then, carefully trudging along the edge of the stream, he dipped one foot in. The chilliness made him jump—the water was freezing. Muttering a few warming charms that barely worked, Draco dipped his whole foot in, pressing it to the slippery bottom.
“Yes.”
The stream, bare with its rocky bed in winter, was now flowing with water again. The current spiraled around sharp rocks where they peaked out of the surface, shallow at the edges where it met land. The water was clear, the bottom cut into sections by wavy lines of sunlight. Grasses sprung from underneath rocks on the bank, early flowers blossoming without pattern. Tiny fish appeared and disappeared into shadows. Draco chuckled.
Harry laughs, the sound bubbling from his chest. Draco smiles faintly—faint, but smiling all the same.
His mother lay next to him on the grass. Young, and somehow more beautiful than Draco had ever seen her to be: blond hair curled elegantly at her nape, the sleeves of her blouse translucent, ballooning at her wrist and folding neatly into the crook of her elbow. She pointed at the northern sky.
Draco, despite himself, laughed wetly. Potter smiled as he pushed the mug into Draco’s hands.
Without looking up, Draco said, “Didn’t the bees like Bridgerton’s farms better last year?”
“Draco?”
It’s not like he thinks the theory might be true. Nope. Not even a little.
Draco shook his head. Flicked his wand, turned and headed back to the kitchen. The hammock shrunk and fell onto the ground with a heavy thump.
“What?”
Harry does not quite know what to do with this version of Malfoy.
Draco laughed. He plucked a sprig of heather and, flushing, tucked it behind Harry’s ear.
He tries very hard to keep his eyes to the book. Malfoy sits back, yawns—covers his mouth with his hand. Hums along, taps his fingers against the bedding. Every now and then he bobs his head a little too hard and Harry has to stifle his smile, has to bury his face deeper into the book.
A small smile played at the corner of Potter’s mouth, but it didn’t look like a smile at all. Draco couldn’t find anything to say. Who was he to say anything to a man who had died once and come back?
“Of course. I will keep it in mind.”
“No,” Potter agreed softly. “It doesn’t.”
The kitten starts licking him with its tiny tongue.
“Draco.”
“Adequate amount of marshmallows?” he asked, sitting down beside him.
“Didn’t you just wake up?”
Draco touched his fingers to the address, the time. Then he touched his fingers to Harry’s smile again.
Harry blinked. “What?”
“Are you not, young lady?” he asked, picking up strays of loose hay from the snow-covered ground to lull Cho near. Cho tugged the dried grass away from his hands and chewed, amber eyes eyeing his coat.
Harry sighs and straightens up. Though the kitten is dirty, sparse white fur knotted up with grime, it is graceful like no other kitten its size is. Harry walks over and reaches out—the kitten jumps, ready to hiss—and grabs a can of wet food from the cupboard above. Pops it open.
Six months, and Harry is still amazed by how Draco is right here in his arms.
“I don’t—” Potter inhaled. Silenced. Then, a long while later, his gaze fixed somewhere afar, “Did you know that I died?”
“When?”
He’d stayed at Harry’s for three days after his breakdown in the middle of the conference, and was fired the instant he set foot back into London. The Howlers shrieking by the doors of his flat were, to be frank, quite unprofessional. That was when the first letter was sent, with distant amusement.
The wind ruffled their hair. Draco closed his eyes, smiling, too. The cool wind gushed through his shirt, soft linen billowing against his skin.
The hills, the endless rolling waves of them, were a sea of blooming heather.
It’s easier, saying it to a kitten as one would to a pet.
“You’ve lived together for the past two and a half months!”
It wasn’t the desserts which made him ache. It was the ghost of her darting about the kitchen, bending to check the oven and stirring the batter, absentmindedly smearing a streak of flour over her cheek. It was her batting away his hands with warning eyes as she placed a finger into her mouth, tasting. He saw her everywhere: in the baking equipment displayed inside a gleaming shop window, in the cheap desserts served at the café where he worked, in every bakery and every shop selling sweets. He once broke down by the frozen aisle in a Muggle supermarket next to the tiramisus. He couldn’t cook. Couldn’t step into the kitchen and hold the pots, the heavy pans. The apron lay in the second drawer down with a thin layer of dust. He couldn’t not see her. Couldn’t not see her hazel hair warm in the afternoon sunlight, the loose strands curly by her ear. Couldn’t not see her smiling, teasing, her eyes focused as she decorated the tiny tarts with whipped cream.
And this was how, fifteen minutes later, Draco was stuck with tufts of hay in his hands and a stubborn Cho refusing to move.
The statics was a soft noise in his ear. Harry was on the other side, listening, too, to the same noise.
He doesn’t know what it is about this dream that is so peculiar that he has it again, and again, and again. His unconsciousness trying to scream through his thick skull about the dullness of his life after the war? The brightness and fierceness buried deep in his soul struggling to surface? Maybe. Every time he wakes, the room is quieter than usual. If he listens, he feels as though he can hear the faintest sounds—but there are none. Only the quiet morning air. Only stillness, only a car driving down the road, the faint echo of tires crunching the asphalt at one moment and fading the very next. Its headlights illuminate a patch of light grey on the ceiling, flowing—flying, like a migrating bird—then disappearing without ever reaching the middle of the blank ceiling. Disappearing amidst nothingness.
“Can’t sleep?” he asked.
Harry tucks his knees closer to his chest and pulls the worn paperback novel closer. The dorm room is silent. All four houses are having a party downstairs in the common room tonight, and all four houses have come for the booze. Awfully thoughtful of them,
“Do you like it?”
“Why on earth do I need a new sweater?”
Still nothing. Harry sighs and shifts his weight to another leg.
“I’m joking! I’m joking,” Draco hastily added as he pushed himself up. Leaned forward, but felt as though he shouldn’t—fell back onto his heels. He wanted to laugh, didn’t want to sound like a maniac. Wanted to see Potter’s smile again, not like this, not as if he was wounded when there was nothing to be wounded from. He managed a forceful laugh. “It’s a joke.”
“No.”
Draco couldn’t remember why they had decided that living separately was better. It was so stupid, thinking about it now. One day they were talking late into the night, and the next the Ministry issued a lock-down for the dragon pox that had spread out of control and banned Apparation and the Floo altogether. Harry had been staying with Aunt Andromeda and Teddy, had been invited over the long weekend, so that was where he was, now—leaving Draco alone in his miserable flat with gilded Chippendale furniture and heavy bookshelves, the winter sky pale and gloomy outside the window.
Blurted without thought, Draco scrambled up. Potter blinked, looked as though he wanted to say something—didn’t. Turned instead, and headed to the doors.
He opens his mouth, but no sound comes out.
“Yes,” the Healer says, now greatly annoyed. “There are some abnormalities in the results, the level of the magical trace of Mandrake leaves in his blood is—”
Draco cast a nervous glance towards him and quickly looked back at the bees. He wore only a veil. The bees climbed over his bare hands, their thin, intricate wings buzzing.
Draco pulled open a drawer. The napkins were piled neatly in one corner, towels so thin they sported holes in the other. He pushed it back. “Drop it, Potter.”
. Then, in smaller letters,
“Harry. Harry. Don’t cry, Harry.”
Harry stares at the blank ceiling. Reminds himself that this is just a kitten, that it has not been in his life for more than two months, that he has slept in this bed alone for countless nights before—has battled his nightmares alone on the vast mattress, white and boundless like an ocean. He turns onto his side and shuts his eyes. Opens them again seconds later, restless. On the nightstand, his glasses catch the moonlight and glint softly in the dark.
“I’m sorry,” Harry said. His voice caught in his throat. “I hurt you. I’m sorry.”
“Because we’ve been arch rivals since we’re eleven?”
Draco is still sleeping at Khatri’s. She has owled to tell him that the spell was successful and Draco has transformed back to his human form. He is sleeping a lot, is all, which is to be expected since his transformation has lasted for a long period of time. He needs rest. Everything else is perfectly fine; she will owl again when he has recovered enough to be discharged.
It happens. It was not his fault. He did everything he could; there was no way he could have prevented it. But he could think of a million ways to prevent it. He stared at the blank ceiling and saw only their eyes, too large on their tiny faces, not even yet opened. Their thin meows echoed by his ear into his sleep, a restless wander.
“You know,” Harry murmurs, “You really have beautiful eyes.” They have changed from their original blue: one into grey, the other remaining a placid lake. In the darkness, though, they are both as clear as the night sky.
So Draco did. The Earl Grey, sugarless as it was, left a bitterness on his tongue. He told her about the fells, the sheep, the faint smudge of North Sea in the distance. The snow covering the endless surrounding hills. The needling branches of Scottish Pines, the thorn dykes, the fox. The stars at night, a sky full of broken diamonds. Spring, the wild flowers sprouting in the wind. The rain, the barn, the lambs. Potter growing a beard. He told her about Lettuce and the bite wound, but left out the steady hum of heat rumbling off Potter’s body. Left out the careful way he wrapped the bandage around his hand, the way he uncurled his fingers, one by one, like an unfurling of petals. Left out the blazing hearth, the thermos of tea smelling of figs and chamomile. Left out the falling into a chilly stream for a bush of bright yellow flowers.
The more he said it the less it sounded like a mistake, like Draco hadn’t meant to say it and desperately wanted to take it back.
“You never asked,” Harry said one night, his head pillowed on one arm. They were in Draco’s bed. The night outside was chilly in the depths of winter, but the heaters hummed and warmed the interior of terrace, warmed every corner of Draco’s house. Harry still smelled faintly of lemons from the tiny lemon cakes. Draco reckoned he himself did, as well.
Astoria said one day at his kitchen. He’d barely moved in for a week, the boxes still scattered all around. All that was in place were the plates and silverware and the couch, sitting in the living room facing blank walls.
scar, an edge chipped off. He thought perhaps it would never grow.
“Lovegood?”
Draco shuddered. “I’d rather not.”
“No!” Harry yelps and grabs hold of it, “Don’t—”
“Non…nonsense. Who doesn’t like cooking? Is it because…ah, ah. Is it because you kill your own sheep? So you can’t bear to cook them?”
He gets up. Heads for a quick shower with cold water, even though summer is trailing towards its end. Pads to the kitchen for coffee, where the coffee machine sits banished to the corner. It was a gift from Ron and Hermione when he moved into his first flat. Much too enthusiastic, always thrumming this way or another, signalling the readied coffee with an exuberant
But still the lambs wouldn’t come. Dusk bled into night. Potter went out and made another call to the Muggle vet. She was out with other emergency calls and wouldn’t be back until a good few hours later. Potter cursed again and tried sending
“I do.”
Draco asked, absentminded. Helped himself to a second serving of scalloped potatoes.
“They cost sixty Galleons a box.”
It was the first time he cried for a kitten.
“Just for the surprise of it all.”
“Only under dire circumstances. Marshmallows add to the taste, Potter.”
“Oh my god,” Draco says, and kisses him.
“Ouch!” Harry quickly retracts it before glaring at the kitten. “No. No biting. Bad kitten.”
He pushed off the quilt he didn’t remember pulling over and noticed, on the table, a vial. On it stuck a tab scribbled with illegible letters,
A Border Collie barked and straightened, alert. Potter scratched its ears as he headed to the back. The barn was bathed in warm lights, brighter than the grey, quiet morning outside. Draco followed Potter—taking his time to finally feel solid ground underneath his boots again—stopped when Potter crouched in front of a baaing pen, and there they were.
name your sheep after our classmates.”
They woke up in the morning with dark shadows underneath their eyes. Touched the small patch of skin, tender and bruised, and laughed. Kissed, every two days or three.
Cho had to be put down in her rough shape. Draco had stormed out of the barn before they could do anything.
It was odd, seeing Harry in his flat. Harry, with his messy hair and scratched glasses, among his London-styled furniture. He seemed to belong to the small cottage in Scotland instead of here, looking around as if he didn’t know what to do.
Draco had fallen in love with her way of speaking before anything else. Her brown eyes always looked as though they held secrets; in the sun they melted into gold, an array of a sunset. She told him that he would spend his whole life trying to escape his father’s shadow. That he would never be able to forgive himself for the war, and that it was okay.
Then he thinks about what will happen to him if Draco frankly did not know, and then—for better or worse—if Draco
A sharp pain shot up his hand. Draco hissed, stifling his wince. Potter noticed nonetheless, paused, then took the curled hand further into his. Spread the fingers out.
“International Floo, portkeys, brooms…doesn’t open again until March. It’s only September and this is already the second blizzard. They’re not taking any risks.”
The world was quiet save for Potter panting, his breaths quick puffs of cloud dissipating into the cold night. Draco, abashed, tried to make himself as light as possible until Potter gritted a
Draco laughs, breathless. “Elope with me?”
The fire was too hot for this weather already. Potter had rolled up his sleeves, the stripes on his sweatshirt crammed into a smudge of maroon at his elbows. He stood up and, holding another salve in his hand, carefully smeared it over the cuts on Draco’s face.
They decided to go for a walk. A skirmish took place before the decision: Draco suggested, but then backtracked when he realized that the Thames went through wizarding London. People had seen Harry already, the press was still as hungry. Harry said that he’d made his decision to come back, so he would bear the consequences—something about reckless Gryffindors, something about Slytherins. In the end Draco compromised, agreeing to go through only the Muggle portions of the river.
“Take a guess.”
Potter was smug. “The sheep know their people, Malfoy.”
He must’ve fallen asleep at some point. He didn’t remember it, but he must have, for the next time he climbed blearily back to consciousness it was to the soft grey lights of a quiet morning. The hearth was silent; the fire had burnt out. Cracked pieces of logs were covered in ash, the heart of it still red, like a burning rod.
“It helps, I heard.”
“You seemed to like the sheep.”
Potter started the fire in the hearth, and was beginning to sort through the things they bought when Draco said, voice hoarse, “I want to drink.”
In hindsight, he had seen the breakup coming. It was just there, like a pebble on the side of a road, nearing as he kept walking forward.
“Wrong. That was exactly what I said yesterday, I said—”
They had been talking over the phone every day. At first it was Harry who called, Draco rushing down the hall and skidding over the corner whenever the old telephone on the wall rang, but then he couldn’t stand it anymore: the silence, staring unseeingly at the lines of a page, waiting for the phone to ring at any moment—a fog pressing at the back of his mind, an unconscious notion. The air strained. The ring would come wrecking through anytime now, deafening—his muscles strung tight, ready to leap out of the settee. He was so sick of it, so tired. So he copied down Aunt Andromeda’s telephone number one night, carefully, number by number, and called the next day. And the next, and the next. Waiting for Harry to pick up, for the loud clack that came just before his voice, the little tilt at the end when he asked
“I didn’t know where to go,” Potter continued, “so I went north and stopped at Lowestoft. A B&B. Worked there for a couple months, and then kept moving north. Grimsby, Bridlington, Whitby…”
form, the more primitive one’s mind becomes—and the more difficult to control. It’s more unpredictable. However, this is our best chance. I still suggest we perform the operation.”
“You’re reading
His own voice sounded distant to himself. The peacocks were all gone, now. Not killed for entertainment, or seized by the Ministry; they simply were not built for dark magic. The Manor during the war had worn them out and eventually, one by one, they had all died. Their eyes like rubies as they lay on the ground, moribund.
“I don’t have to be. I think I heard…
“Ah, I remember. You had yourself a little corner, didn’t you? Tidied it all up?”
Potter laughed. The corner of his eyes crinkled, his cheeks folding as he sent his fists flying in the air. Draco hadn’t seen this in what felt like a lifetime, and it left him breathless to see it again—strung his chest tight. He hadn’t realized he’d missed this. Missed Potter laughing easily around him, missed their banter and silly jokes. Missed his laughter, loud and clear, ringing across the hills. And he must’ve lost himself in Potter’s grin, must’ve gotten distracted by the knot in his chest, because Potter’s eyes suddenly widened. Before Draco could register it, a sharp pain shot through his hand.
Harry squeezes a smile. The kitten looks at him from over her hands, its tiny paws perched on her fingers.
“Oh, I haven’t seen you!” she exclaims, holding out her hand for the kitten to sniff. “How are you? How is Harry’s flat?”
“Everything is going to be alright,” he murmurs again. “Just drink and don’t think about anything else.”
Potter paused, looked up. There were faint creases of worry between his brows. “You shouldn’t.”
“It’s okay.” Potter said softly. “You’ve said worse.”
It does not soothe him now.
“I always dream of a sunflower field,” Harry says. His face warms; he doesn’t know why he is telling the kitten this. Why he is telling Draco this, out of the blue. But he continues. “It’s always summer. A sea of them stretches to the horizon…in full bloom, you know, like they’re chasing the sun. Like they’re kissing it.” He sighs softly. “Maybe we can go one day. There’s one in Surrey, I think. We’ll go see it together.”
“Okay.”
Draco pressed his hand to the side of Harry’s face. Fit his palm to the shape of it, the rise and dip of bones, the plains of his cheek. Even underneath the humming heat of the duvets, the air warm against his bare skin—his arm, his shoulder—Harry still felt like a dream. It seemed impossible to have him right underneath his fingertips, right beside him, after two lonely months in London.
If he says it slow enough, he can taste the shape of the word, how it twinkles like stars on his tongue: two syllables rolling after each other, years and years of history in them. How far they’ve come for him to call him
Draco takes the bouquet.
“Oaf?” Harry frowns slightly, but soon grins again. “Oh, you’re
Outside the window, a raven glided against the dusk and settled in an empty tree.
It was impossible; it seemed impossible. To imagine falling in love ever again. To imagine falling in love with someone else ever again. Was it going to be like this forever, he thought. His lungs filled with dread. To think he was going to grieve for the rest of his life. To think he was going to live in melancholy, to always flinch when he heard her name, to always go back to an empty flat at night.
“Ah—”
“Thank you,” he said. Solemn, even though he was putting it lightly. “Thank you for the hand cream.”
“I do.” Draco laughed, too, soft. “I do, my love. I do.”
“If I get another day of rain, I swear to Circe—”
he’d asked, desperate.
“Shouldn’t have danced with you,” Harry mutters. “Shouldn’t have danced with you today at all.” They have taken up to dancing every now and then when the song comes on the wireless, more often than not ending with them tripping over each other’s feet and falling onto the couch, or crashing into the tea cabinet, or falling onto the floor atop each other, laughing and wincing and rubbing their bums. In the safety of their own flat, they can be as silly as they want. Whenever Elvis comes onto the wireless when they are in bed, Harry sings along with an improvised microphone, putting his face close to Draco’s—badly out of tune and over-enunciating each word. Draco laughs and throws his arms over his face, embarrassed.
“Draco?” Harry asked, frowning. “Are you alright?”
, then sheathed his wand back. Smiled at Draco. “Happy New Year.”
When Draco doesn’t pull back, Harry’s eyes fall shut. Draco’s mouth is so soft, so careful. He doesn’t ask for entrance; instead he kisses Harry’s bottom lip, kisses his top lip. Kisses, gingerly, the corner of his mouth. Harry lets out a shuddering breath. He grants Draco entrance anyway, his mouth falling open. His walls crumbling one after another until he is left bleeding raw in the center.
“I’m not hiding.”
“That’s not true.”
“Where’s the ring?” Harry asks, laughing, too, pulling back. “Where is it?”
“No." Harry twined their fingers together, traced the knuckles at his thumb. "Tell me.”
“And you found it here?” Draco asked. Swallowed. “In Scotland with your sheep?”
Draco shuffled into Harry’s bed. Harry pulled him close. They still slept in their separate bedrooms most of the time, out of habit. Harry wrapped his arms around Draco, and Draco curled up and tucked his face into the nook of Harry’s neck.
Now that he’d finally worked through the treacherous path of his heart, now that they’re finally in each other’s arms, Draco couldn’t imagine letting go. Couldn’t imagine stop kissing. To breathe was only to dive deeper. He caressed Harry’s cheek, traced the rough patch of his beard—his fingers clutching at his nape where the skin emitted warmth. The kiss slowed to a hum, to a lingering, unwilling to let go. Their breathes hot and fragmented, mingled. Draco half-opened his eyes, as though waking from a dream in the morning and still trying to sink back in. Harry’s lips were parted. Draco couldn’t help but put two fingers to them, dazed at how easily the tenderness gave in.
“Because with you I don’t count the cracks in the ceiling. Because with you I can fall asleep. Because I fall in love with storms when I look at you by the window. Because I dream about sunflowers again and again, and I want to see them with you, together, and I have never wanted to see them with anyone, or to see them at all. Because—”
Draco, abashed, tried to brush it off. “Don’t mind it. It’s…something in return for the sweaters. And the paint. One favor for another, yes? You did buy me an awful lot of things.”
“Is that where we’re going?” Draco asked. The engine rumbled to life, drowning his voice. “The fells?”
Draco nods, shaky. Steps forward, one foot after another; slow, as if he has to recall how to use his limbs, an old grandfather clock again winded after the handles have not walked for decades. Harry pulls the duvet back as Draco reaches the bed, lets out a trembling sigh—curls himself into a ball and nestles against Harry’s chest, clutching Harry’s pajamas as though holding on.
then. You’re clumsy.”
Draco looked down at the parchment. His fingers yearned to move of their own accord. He hadn’t drawn in years, and yet it thrummed at his fingertips as if it was never really gone, matching the beat of his heart.
“And you?” he asked, eyes bright. “Do you like it here?”
Harry’s mouth drops open. He closes it and resigns to sleeping in the guest room that night.
” It sounds so ridiculous, so out of place. Yet Harry asks, “What do you think?”
Like being a little insane doesn’t matter.
“Then the tomatoes shall all get strangled and you shan’t get your tomato soup, Harry.”
“Well?” Potter asked, buzzed. His hair was swept wild by the Apparition, half of his coat collar lifted. His glasses reflected the empty street as he strode forward—Draco reeled him back. Folded down Potter’s collar, tidied his scarf, and patted his hair with more force than necessary. Trying, to no avail, to flatten the wild strands.
It takes Harry a moment to realize what Draco is saying. When he does, something in his chest shifts—something with edges so sharp it feels like bleeding.
“Draco?”
Potter seemed lost and still, guilty. Draco stifled a sigh and resumed his opening and closing of drawers. A while later Potter asked, uncertain, “Are you looking for something?”
“No,” Harry said. “I’m here to fetch you away from work, actually.”
The kitten meows and squirms underneath the duvet. Peeks its head out right beside Harry’s chin.
Minutes later he emerged from the shop into the cold night, a pot of rosemary cradled close to his chest.
A list of possible reasons:
Harry had gone out inspecting the beehives. He wouldn’t be back for hours.
The music is still floating in the air. The notes gently descend before lifting once again.
The coffee is hot and bitter, just like usual. He grimaces just for the sake of grimacing. His skin warms against the coolness seeping into the late summer air, the first hint of autumn.
“It was nice. For her to leave on a summer day. She was happy with it,” Draco echoed his own words, pulled a shaky smile. A tear fell without warning. He hastily wiped it away. “I’m sorry. Circe, why am I—I’m sorry. I’m sorry.”
Draco was at a loss for words. Potter turned back and, a while later, lay down on the ground with a soft grunt, head pillowed on his folded arms. Looked at the stars. From this angle Draco could see the faint scar that cut from his cheek to his jaw, the white line nearly invisible under the night sky. He couldn’t see, but could imagine nonetheless, the lightning bolt that cracked down Potter’s forehead on the other side of his face. It must be faint, too, after all these years. Now, under the stars. A history; a past. Nothing more and nothing less.
“No. No, no-no-no-no-no, you are absolutely
“It’s okay. It’s okay.” Draco’s voice thickened. Clutching the telephone close to his mouth, he took a shuddery breath. “I miss you. Darling, my darling. My love. I miss you so much.”
Harry kisses him again, another peck. Then another, and another. Draco hums, hips bumping into the counter. Harry kisses him again, just a little longer.
“The day you bought the hammock. You could have Apparated home with it, there was no need to carry it all the way from town.”
The morning light blinds him. Before he registers anything, a flash of fur and claws lunges onto his face.
“Yes, yes, of course.” Harry lifted the covers. “Come here.”
It had not been easy for him after the war. He was prohibited from leaving the Manor where it locked all his nightmares and two years later, no one would accept him for education. Eventually his mother pawned her silver necklace to find him a tutor. Her pearl hairpin, her gilded snuff box which she’d inherited from her great-grandmother, her emerald family ring embedded with the Malfoy crest—gone. Then no potion workshop would hire him. He settled for a small company which conducted research and collected data for potion prototypes, and started in a tiny office he shared with twenty others. He’d shaken hands, attended charity galas, bowed his head low and learned to stay silent. Learned to ignore the spits and snarls in streets, the condescending glances at his workplace. It would, as he’d later learn, take him years to finally earn a promotion, and years more before he would finally be able to afford his flat in London.
“Great achievements come from perseverance, Potter.”
Harry exchanges a look with Ron, and they both shudder. Hermione coos over Crookshanks, yes, but seeing her coo over a litter of kittens is another story.
A warm hand at his shoulder, tentative.
“Merlin, Draco. It’s not about the gallons.” Potter leaned back, dropped his hands to the table. All the while staring at Draco. “It’s never about the gallons.”
“Hey.” Potter sounded offended. “I don’t make my own cheese.”
They hardly need to. The movement flows between them, every step fitting like an old leather watch fitting against a wrist, smooth and worn and indented at all the right places. Harry leans his head against Draco’s shoulder. He used to resent their height difference, but now he is simply grateful for any chance to use Draco’s shoulder as head rest.
He heard the door creak as it was pushed open, shut close. Heard footsteps—the dull thump of boots, heavy. It was this beyond everything else that told him of Potter’s arrival, and before he noticed Potter was already crouching in front of him.
In a fluid motion, he tilted her head up and rubbed the teat to her mouth. Within seconds Cissy started suckling and fell quiet, busy eating.
“Yes.”
It was what he did, too, two nights after Astoria left the train station. Except now it was autumn and the night air was cooler, seeping through his thin shirt. He shivered. Yet still he could not go back, could not go back to the flat where memories suffocated him, the soft bed slowly killing him with warmth. So he walked laps. Walked laps until his legs were numb and toes unfeeling, until he could barely see straight from the shivering of his body. The sprinkled stars of London blinked at him as he tried to shove the keys into the door lock with trembling fingers. The keys dropped. He bent, teeth clattering, picked them up and tried again. His fingers were frozen. Every contact with the ridges of the keys stung like needles.
couldn’t say
Hermione hisses. “Ron!”
Potter grinned as though it split his face. At that moment, everything was clear. Draco couldn’t take his eyes off him. His hair plastered to his forehead, droplets dotting his glasses. His eyes bright despite the darkened sky. His cheeks flushed from the run, the crinkles at the corners of his eyes. The faint scar on his left cheek that disappeared under his jaw.
And this is new, too—for Harry to hear the smile in Draco’s voice, a secret victory at every one of them, knowing they are there because of him. He picks out the cleomes with the most vibrant purples, the ones with their petals spread the fullest—cuts off the excess leaves, the motion familiar with ease. Spreads out the wrapping paper on the working table, smooths its edges.
He never thought he’d live to see any of it. It is still too large for him, sometimes, this happiness flooding him as suddenly and tenderly as waves at bay. He could never have imagined, living in a dark, dusty cupboard under the stairs all those years ago, whispering to spiders, all alone. He could never—
“Oh my god,” he says.
Harry smiles. “Teach me.”
The sky was, for once, clear today, the blue soft like a chiffon. They arrived, and the sheep scattered off at their own pace once released. Cho flicked her tail before wandering off.
It fills him to the brim and he wants to cry again. So he kisses Draco instead. Draco hums and kisses back, hands clutching at his waist. They sway, not to the music anymore but to their own breaths. The world fades around him. Time ceases to exist. When he comes back to it, Ron is howling at them from the other side of the gardens.
He fell asleep minutes later, head tilted against the back of the couch. Draco chewed his lip. He fetched another blanket, a quilt, and, still worried that Harry might catch a cold, fetched Harry’s duvet from his bedroom—wrapped Harry tightly inside the layers. Harry slept like a baby through it all. Draco fetched a cushion, carefully lifted Harry’s head and pushed it under so Harry wouldn’t wake up with a sore neck. Harry made a soft noise and drifted back to sleep.
Potter laughed, sharp. “Says the guy who can’t even get over his ex after six months.”
). Potter wandered into shops and came out with wrapped parcels—Christmas gifts he would later send, after the transportation ban lifted. Draco wandered into shops of his own and smoothed a finger over varnished photo frames, over musical boxes, over pots of herbs in a particularly warm shop. The shop owner was an old man in a beret and thin-framed spectacles, with a long beard. Oddly, he reminded Draco of the painting shop owner years ago and filled him with sadness as he looked over the tiny leaves of each herb. He’d had a few mugs of mulled wine by then, and the world had turned into a frizzy blur of emotions. A pot of rosemary curled around his touching finger. Draco chuckled and muttered a
“It’s cold,” Harry said, draping Draco’s duvet over him. They wrapped themselves in the warmth of the duvets. Then they watched the moon together, their feet dangling off the edge of the roof.
Across from the table, Draco’s mouth thins. The bar is dim, the buttery lights low and music slow. The booth is packed too tight with the two of them.
he reads. Clears his throat to feel less embarrassed, reading letters to a kitten.
Potter laughed. Draco smiled, humming, tracing the chipped edge of his mug. It hadn’t been there when he first arrived. He couldn’t recall when he’d dropped it, or bumped it, or clashed it against the corner of the sink, the table, the window—he wept, then was overwhelmed by affection over the tiny chip and was laughing again, the corner of his eyes still wet. He laughed at the coats dumped onto the rail, at the soot smeared over the left corner of the rug, at Potter’s socks. They were dotted with tiny long-eared owls with large, round eyes. Ridiculous. Potter laughed again, loud and clear. It was the clearest sound Draco heard all evening. At some point he picked Potter’s hands up and inspected them closely. With dumb fingers, he traced the rigid cuts that dug along the lines of Potter’s palm—a result of never hesitating before dipping his hands into freezing water in winter.
“I’ve no idea why.”
“…Make him sad?” Harry asks, dumbfounded. “Why?”
The first time Draco met her was at a charity gala that served Brundlmayer Extra Brut in thin wine glasses. On the balustrade, where the night had fallen over the gardens and little floating lights hovered mid-air, she held the stem of her wineglass between two fingers, loose and elegant. Her hazel hair flipped to one side, cascading down her bare back like a waterfall. Her violet dress hugged the curve of her waist.
“What are you doing here?” Draco asked in a furious hush, shutting the doors behind him.
“How do you know?”
“Yeah.” Potter shut his eyes and leaned his head back against the armchair. Let out a rough laugh, quieted again. “It does.”
Potter watched it all in silence, then went back to his sorting.
Isla Allen was a short, round woman, white hair weaving through dark brown. Her thin eyes made it look as though she was always smiling. Draco was hired the very next day after their cuppa and was to start work the next week. The new company was larger, its lobby marbled, and Draco had his own office. He spent a weekend collecting the things he’d bring: photos of Cissy, quills and bottles of ink, a mug and extra sugar packets. Longbottom, out of the blue, sent a pot of succulent with a brief letter of congratulations, hinting at Harry’s mention of his rosemary and love for plants. Draco thanked him and, in his next letter, threatened to murder Harry. Harry simply ignored the notion.
Draco huffed. Potter laughed, slow and relaxed.
The kitten meows enthusiastically and scratches the door again.
“Just for the record, I asked what colors you liked, not what your favorite—”
Another thunder rumbles, the sky exploding into cracks. Draco flinches again. Harry buries his fingers into Draco’s hair, murmurs into it. Draco’s breath is hot against his neck, his chapped lips brushing against the soft skin every now and then. His body is warm, hot, even—as though he is burning. His grip tight at Harry’s collar, knuckles nestled against Harry’s chest. Harry doesn’t know how long it takes for Draco to loosen his tense shoulders, for him to drift off again, only that he keeps murmuring, even into sleep—murmuring, words buried into Draco’s hair like a lullaby, holding Draco close like a baby in a cradle.
In the distance Lettuce barked, the sound fading over the valley.
, I guess, more—marveled. Fascinated. There were quite a few illustration handbooks in the Manor. I used to flip through them as a kid to kill time.”
He had always been afraid, just for entirely different reasons.
Draco’s mouth dropped open. “But—but it’s Christmas.”
Ron saunters in, peers over Harry’s shoulder. Wanders to the fridge and opens it.
Draco shook his head, still smiling. “I was prejudiced, Potter.”
The air smells like baking, like flour and something sweet.
“Do you like it?”
The kittens, having exhausted themselves over playtime in the afternoon, now sleep peacefully in their pen, all huddled up into a great heap of grey and ginger and brown and dotted white. Harry has already put up the adoption signs. In a few days, they will all be gone.
Draco snorted in disbelief. “As if you don’t say fuck yourself!”
“Draco—”
The cloth was rough against his skin. Draco closed his eyes as Potter ran it gently over his temple. They were close. He could feel the warmth radiating off from Potter, a steady hum, and thought he could fall asleep like this. Potter huffed a laugh and moved the cloth to a different place.
The memories came back to him in trickles, then widened into rivers. The thin stem of a wine glass dangling at Astoria’s fingers. Astoria in his grey sweater, leaning against the kitchen island. The day they first kissed—after finishing ice cream, her lips tasting like strawberries. She liked strawberries, but only the flavor and not the fruit itself.
“Southern border of Scotland,” Potter replied, closing his eyes. “In the fells. In the mountains, I mean.”
“And you are going back to Scarhead,” Draco murmurs. “That pronunciation is atrocious.”
“So I’ve heard.”
“Are you going to help?” Draco asked.
“You’re smitten, mate. And you haven’t even started dating him.”
Looking all innocent like an angel.
He didn’t stop him now. Reached down, threaded his fingertips loosely though Draco’s, as though he wanted to hold his hand—changed his mind, pressed it to his chest instead. Against the sparse hair, against the heated skin, Draco could feel Harry’s heart beating. A little fast, the muscles of his chest moving with it. Right underneath his fingers.
Draco, avoiding Potter’s gaze, stared at his hand. The wound had already mostly healed, the skin pink around the shallow indents. Potter had dropped his mouth open at a single glance at Draco, had been furious—chased him into the hot shower, shouting as he went. Now, sitting in front of the fire, baked warm and quiet, guilt was a tiny snake that curled in Draco’s chest.
Harry blinks. “You did?”
He drank coffee, bleary. Pulled his arms into a button-down shirt, stepped into his trousers. Headed to work through the morning hubbub. Sat in front of his desk with another pile of paperwork. He worked through them with a detachment like a theater screen, as though watching someone else. The talk with Astoria hovered at the back of his mind, a brewing storm. Sometimes, in the middle of the day, it swelled when he least expected it to—made it difficult to breathe.
It reeled Draco back to reality. Potter had stood up, had had his satchel on his shoulder, had stuffed his hands into his pockets. “I need to fetch something, so I—”
Now, standing in Harry’s cottage by the window, he just wanted to fall asleep. Warmth, tired and gentle, welled in his chest and then settled with a soft sigh. He’d lie on the couch and pull one of the blankets over him. Fold his arms on the short table, curl himself up in the armchair. Anywhere. Just being here would be enough.
“Don’t we all,” Draco said. Harry was ready to say it didn’t make any sense, but then Draco turned and kissed him chastely on the mouth. He tasted like strawberries, too.
“Yes, yes—”
How they had cared about the tiny things, Draco thought. How they had clung to them like a matter of life and death. It all seemed so light now, so insignificant.
Harry worries his bottom lip. On his lap, the kitten sleeps soundly. It shuffles, turns—burrows into Harry’s belly.
Draco sniffed. Harry came back with a mug of tea in his hand. Draco had made it this afternoon, had timed it so the tea would be just warm by now. He’d made it with chamomile because he knew Harry was coming back, after a long journey.
Then Potter was in front of him. Close, crowding Draco back into the wall, both hands on either side of his head—his breath hot on his lips. Draco couldn’t think. Potter held his gaze, dropped it to his mouth—reeled it back up. His hands clenched into fists against the wall.
“You still won’t say it,” Harry says softly. “Even if you’re pleading, you still won’t say the words.”
It was funny, wasn’t it, that he thought himself a self-preserving man and yet when the opportunity presented itself, he wrote to his ex. Draco unfolded the letter. Astoria was well and sent her condolences to him being stuck in Scotland, but—as her jesting hinted—wished him to enjoy it. She always wanted to visit Scotland, she said. Ashmolean Museum was wonderful, just as it always was, and there was to be a new exhibition in two weeks… A photo in the envelope showed a windy day in Oxford, fallen leaves whirling over streets. The museum stood, in silence, at a distance down the road, softened by the grey sky and the camera lens.
The kitten meows loudly and turns its head away.
“It’s okay,” Draco whispered. “It hurts when cooking. I know it does.”
The kitten senses his nerves and becomes jittery as well, tail flicking as it paces his lap. Harry carefully smoothes a hand down the kitten’s head, softly scratches the tufted fur at its neck. Regrets, with a tiny voice in his head, that he did not take his time to say goodbye last night.
Draco laughed again. Talked about how this was impossible, Harry was impossible, this was probably his plan all along, coming for him through the morning mist with his hair tousled, gauzy shirt opening at his chest…and flushed all over his face as he squeezed into one side of the hammock. Harry climbed, grip tight as he hoisted himself, the hammock swaying violently under his weight—and threw himself in, landing with a sharp noise in the ropes.
“I have tried, relentlessly, for many years. To no avail.”
“Fred,” Potter announced after he checked the lamb, scratching its ears. “Hello, buddy.”
“It has cool eyes,” Ron adds, swallowing the mouthful of eggs. “One blue and one grey, isn’t it? Look! That’s not exactly common in cats, is it?”
The crowd bustled around him. People talked on their Muggle devices, the heels of their shoes clicking on the asphalt. Vendors called out to customers. A woman was laughing and couldn’t stop. The cars swept past him, their honks impatient. Everywhere he walked he seemed to be brushing someone’s shoulder, bumping into someone’s knees, pushing past.
Harry decides he’ll just avoid them for the time being. The kitten, which has taken on the habit of following him everywhere, jumps onto the couch beside Luna. Sniffs her dress, and then jumps onto her lap. Luna sticks her wand into her messily tied up hair and smoothes a hand down the kitten’s back.
They were sitting on the couch, ankles twined. They were listening to the wireless. Were laughing about the plants they bought, the tiny succulent that never seems to get enough water. The wireless is playing in the empty living room still, soft notes flimsy, floating through the air like the shadows of a ghost. The lyrics still gentle, all blending vaguely into an attenuated syllable.
“I know,” Harry murmurs and closes his eyes. Opens them again, holds the kitten’s gaze like he would Draco’s. “It’s tiring. But there are a lot of beautiful things, too. No matter what you choose, we…we’re in this together. We’ll go to Surrey anyway.” Harry lets out a laugh. “And we’ll finish
Draco’s mouth opened, and then closed.
Seven years ago, their first trip to the beach. Draco had been so happy, that day. He didn’t think it was possible for someone to be this happy. For it to well, for it to brim, for it to spill and to submerge, as gentle as the sea. He had been so young. He hadn’t known it could drown, as well.
Draco didn’t reply. Harry cast a warming charm over him, and Draco shuddered as warmth washed over him. Harry wrapped a coat around his shoulders. Draco’s coat. He’d brought it with him.
“Hey.” Potter squeezed his arm. “It’s alright. I just thought…I just thought you might need—want—a distraction. You don’t seem very…” he paused, searching for the correct word, “yourself, these days.”
The world swung sideways. Pain burst dully from his bum, his knee, a sharp stab at his hands where they scraped against the rocks. Draco gasped, scrambling out from the cold stream. His clothes were soaked from the inside out, plastering to his body. Shivering, he cast another incompetent warming charm—gave up. Carefully, still, he reached out to the flowers—picked them carefully from the bottom. Cast a preserving charm with his shaking wand before placing them inside his chest pocket.
Draco snorts. “Great advice. I’ll just trash the wedding like a Gryffindor.”
“Oh.” Then, after a moment too long, “Thank you.”
“I don’t need to.”
Draco blinks. Shakes his head.
Harry laughs. “You know how my Saturdays go, Joe.”
“How come you don’t know how to cook, huh?” Draco looked at Potter. It was hard to do so. His eyelids were heavy and wanted to drop of their own accord. “Ten…ten years. You don’t know how to cook? A grandma? Impossible. How?”
Draco’s eyes shot to him. To his eyes, unbelievably green behind his glasses.
It was quiet. Sunlight streamed in from the windows, faint and cold the way it often was in winter. The couch and the short table, the clothes draped all over the railing, the ragged rug, all bathed in dove white. The hearth was silent. The whole room echoed of the lingering sense of loss and ache from his dreams.
Harry blinks again. “I’m working.”
“No, no. Of course you didn’t. I forgot that no news reach this godforsaken place. No owls, no Floo, no—”
The kitten purrs and settles itself against Harry’s chest. Harry sighs again and gives in, cupping the kitten’s tiny body underneath his palm. He scratches the tufts of hair at its neck.
He scratches its ears as he takes the stairs one at a time.
“Ah. If you do, face my body to the west. I rather enjoy the view there in summer.”
“Hannah?” Potter guessed, looking over curiously .
Harry squeezes her arm. Hermione leans on his shoulder and sighs.
“Ah. I didn’t know you’d count my father’s peacocks.”
Harry shrugged. Draco clutched the sweater.
It was warm.
He didn’t know who leaned back in, who closed the thin space between them. Only that Potter was kissing him again: soft, deeper. His finger trembling against Draco’s jaw. Potter lingered as he pulled back—leaned in again. Kissed him again. Like tumbling off a hill and unable to stop.
Harry is quiet. “Just don’t hurt him.”
“He’s keeping it,” Ron cuts off his thoughts through a mouthful of scrambled eggs.
The wireless hums, a comfortable silence between songs. Then the familiar tune comes, gentle and dear.
Harry laughed. “That would be nice. I’m sure you’re good at it.”
He looked around, stepping into the living room. The cottage was empty. Harry, it seemed, hadn’t come back yet. A mug was left on the short table, the curtains half-pulled. The quilt was nowhere in sight, leaving only the two blankets on the couch. Draco walked to the windows. The hills, now every shade of green, were starting to turn pink and purple in the moments before a sunset. Rolled back, blended into the far mountains where the very tops were still covered in snow, white blending into blue.
“For your hands,” Draco repeated. Was suddenly embarrassed, rubbing his hands over his face—linked them at his nape, trying to cover the maddening blush there. Potter looked at him and laughed all of a sudden. Draco, even more abashed, tried to cover his face.
He had never been to a gallery before. For two hours he had picked his clothes; at last he’d settled on a simple shirt, opened at the collar. It was suitable for summer. The exhibition could be toured in many ways: by continent, by timeline, or by theme. The brochure suggested three different routes, looping around the halls and overlapping, three colors condensing into one.
mug—settled back beside Draco. Draco traced his thumb to the chipped handle, an intrinsic touch.
“There’s plenty, actually.”
“No,” Harry agreed.
Potter hummed a confirmation. Draco recalled the peculiar patterns, the vines that stretched and curled, the moons and the suns. The patch of wildflowers at the corner, blooming with every color. It made sense, now, that it came from Lovegood’s hands.
“And you just took him in?”
“Excuse me,” Ron accuses, “I thought your pining had finally borne fruit.”
“That thing is inedible.”
Draco stared at him.
“White peacocks? They’re albinos?”
Did he still think I was a boy who painted beautiful things?
“Ah, yes. I am used to it. It doesn’t mean I tolerate it.”
“So I was lost,” Potter said, “and I looked for the answer.”
Potter caught up on the silence and stood up, pulling into his coat. “You want to stay back and read it?”
“Draco.”
Work was, beyond doubt, as friendly as ever. His department manager dumped eight stacks of paperwork on his desk before he’d even set foot into office. He stifled a sigh and set himself to work, tired but determined all the same. Didn’t turn at the hushed conversation two desks down. Didn’t turn at an argument outside of the doors, a muffled
He still remembers their marks, sparse patches of black fur on skin with fur so thin it tinged pink. One had a mark covering its right eye, like a calf. The other had three paws in black socks, like tiny boots as it crawled unseeingly across the blanket, sensing only by touch. Harry had kissed their foreheads. Had stayed up all night by their sides, watching them squirm in a sea of blankets. Had chuckled, had teased them in a soft murmur.
“Great,” Draco says, turning to walk towards the door, “there’s something I need to show you. Just to get an opinion. Very convenient, won’t take long, my flat is a five-minute walk from here so we won’t even need to Apparate—”
“You’re certainly not happy.”
“That’s Draco,” Harry says it again. It feels nice to say Draco’s name.
Potter let him name her, and so he named her, per Potter’s example, after his mother. Potter squeezed his wrist before teasing him for naming the sheep as mundanely as he did.
In walked Harry Potter.
Harry nods dumbly. “Okay,” he murmurs, standing up. Cradling the kitten in front of him like a baby. “Okay.”
Harry swallows. “Three days?”
Harry sighs. He strokes the top of the kitten’s head anyway, scratches its ears anyway. It has grown so much over the past few weeks, its chubbiness stretching into the lithe body it will eventually inhabit, but it is still so tiny. It ears, its paws—so tiny.
“Why?”
He wasn’t the head of a military coup, Draco didn’t think. He wasn’t so sure now. He had been pacing the room for hours, in the middle of the day, and he had gotten ink everywhere, spilled over the parchment and splattered over the duvets—he’d cried out—ink dripping onto the wooden floor, staining his feet and smeared all over the place with his messy steps. The parchment with the list of reasons was crumpled in his sweaty hands.
“Is that a snowman?” he asked, peeking over Draco’s shoulders. Draco tried to hide the hot chocolate with his height advantage of three centimeters.
Draco stared at the piece of fruit.
“I miss her already,” Potter said, voice breaking on the last syllable. Draco turned his face and buried it into Potter’s chest, shifted his body—wrapped his arms around him. Clutched at his dirt-clogged sweater. In their awkward embrace, he felt Potter’s tremors wrecking through his body.
“No,” Draco said, quickly and quietly. Harry looked at him, careful.
Sparkling wine is served on floating plates charmed to splash children with water if they try to grab one. Harry takes two tiny glasses and holds one stem in each hand before taking off to look for Draco. Finds him by the gate leading to the altar, stuffs a glass into his hands, and presses a chaste kiss to his lips.
“Oh. Didn’t you know, Harry?” Luna looks at him, surprised. “Sunflower seeds make great tea. But they—”
“My letters,” he starts. Hesitates, but pushes through all the same. “You keep them on your nightstand.”
Ron makes another face and heads for the kitchen. He always makes tea for the three of them: Molly has taught him well in terms of household chores, and he makes the best tea. Why Harry is still the one responsible for dinner, Harry doesn’t know.
The kitten turns and continues to lick his nose. Harry chuckles wetly.
He worked in the little shed built adjacent to their house. It was thin and wooden, embedded with a framed window and extensive, intricate heating charms, the air swelling with warmth. He set out the equipment, methodical and simple: the extractor, the long bread knife, the buckets. He murmured the spells, words softly spoken into the golden sun slanting across the thin space, over the drifting dust motes.
“Well, no. It’s perfect timing to go to the Christmas market in the evening.”
“Thank you,” Draco said.
“It’s…ah, we’re five minutes late. Oh well.” Potter cast a
The rain pattered against the patio, clinging onto the edge before falling in pellucid strings.
“It’d be brilliant, Harry,” Hermione says, though her smile looks a little sad. “Imagine! A permanent tenant! We’d visit you guys every week!”
Harry nodded, taking a deep breath. Draco pressed his lips lightly to his. Harry let out a shuddery sigh, clutched his shirt. Draco kept it slow, opened his mouth. One hand cradling Harry’s face, the other holding his nape. Harry’s breath slowed as the kiss turned deep, as the world confined to this—their breaths mingled, gentle hearts laid bare. Draco caressed Harry’s cheeks as he pulled away, his fingers at the tail end of his beard where it blended into short tufts of hair, scratchy.
They arrived just as the sun rose, the first golden beams spilling behind the hills. They hauled the beehives off the back of the truck. The sun inched across the fields, and the bees slowly awoke; by the time they were near finished, the world had brightened. Draco stood by the edge of the fields as Harry finished up. The heather rippled under the cool wind of the Scottish Highlands, a boundless sea of pinks and purples tipping under the tender blue sky, stretching over the edge of the hills.
He’d bruised himself all over, the pain now pulsing dully underneath his skin. Had slit his face and hands, too, where they scraped against the sharp edges of rocks on the river bed. Draco hissed when Potter brushed over a spot, winced. Potter paused. When he started again, his touch was gentle despite his brows a grim knot.
He wakes blearily to a soft nose booping his. Clear eyes meet his own, one as blue as ice and one as grey as a dove.
“After I take a shower?” Harry asked, gesturing. “I stink of sheep.”
Draco laughs, startled. “We could be.”
Harry tosses onto his other side. Shuts his eyes.
“Salt,” Draco said flatly. He rummaged through the cabinets, dug through the tins of tea and unopened biscuits until
“Hungry, yes? Potter’s coming back with your food. He’ll be here soon. Be a patient lady, won’t you?”
Does it?
Harry’s hand dropped to his nape then down, to his chest. Left of it, where his heart beat. Pressed it close until there were no seams, only skin against skin through a thin layer of fabric. His palm warm all over, and Draco melted underneath. The soft ache flowed into the stream of warmth, into the air, away, away.
“I had more manners when I was five than all of them combined,” Draco continues. Harry chuckles and kisses his cheek.
“Yes, right, like that’s happening. You wipe your mouth with your hand!”
“Go back where?”
happy. I am—” Draco dropped his head to Harry’s shoulder, inhaled deeply. Harry covered his nape with his hand and, carefully, stroked the short strands of hair. Draco let out a deep breath. “I am.”
Harry smiled. “It’s taking advantage of the knowledge I have.”
“He is…fine. I suppose.”
“Malfoy.” Potter’s face turned ghastly. “I don’t want to talk about this.”
Draco’s head shot up. Potter skimmed the letter, lifted his gaze as well. “They’re threatening to sack you. Why did you not tell me?”
are asking for. But guess what, Potter. Life moves on. You can’t hide here forever. You are a coward and I can’t believe I ever thought otherwise.”
“Ah, the Messiah Violin by Antonio Stradivari.”
“Oh?” Draco smiled, and, unable to stop himself, tilted his head to kiss Harry again. “What did you imagine?”
Harry laughs. The kitten tentatively sniffs her finger before jumping to a higher shelf and sitting down again, staring unblinkingly at them.
“I am not clumsy.”
Joe bursts into laughter. “You know what, I’ll give it to you for free. Can’t say no to a cat who wants to eat proper carbonara.”
He shook the thought off, plucked the leaf with a gentle twist. Muttered a spell, and placed it carefully into his pocket. Around him the sheep dotted the hills, lambs galloping after their mothers. He wandered, followed the meandering trail of whatever herbs he found—through the skirts of forests and pass the highlands—until he ended up at the bottom of a valley, three or four sheep grazing the lands nearby. It took him a minute to recognize it as the valley he’d seen months ago, when he and Potter sat together on a flat rock, the faint smudge of North Sea in the distance.
“That the kitten is Draco.” Harry laughs. “Can you imagine? Draco? A kitten?”
Potter regarded him for a long time.
Draco remembered her room, remembered how it was to look out from the windows and see the whole garden. She must’ve seen the roses before she fell asleep. The white roses, climbing onto the wooden fences on the east side of the garden. They had just started to bloom. Many were still buds, buttery petals only beginning to sprout.
Potter looked at his own mug with a small smile. “I never liked cooking.”
“Go back to bed,” he says again, voice hoarse. “You’re tired.”
“No,” Draco whispered. He pressed his mouth to Harry’s hair; his fingers tightened their hold on Harry. “You are just in time.”
“Hey,” Harry whispers.
“It won’t,” Harry said, yawning again, “not until we have the chocolate chip cookies.”
The kitten stares at the kettle, tail flicking.
“And what makes you think I’m an expert on the topic?” Harry asked. “I grew up with Muggles.”
The kitten yawns and rolls onto its back, showing its belly.
Luna blinks. “Because he’s Draco, of course.”
Draco let out a laugh. “That sounds awfully Gryffindor. I don’t think it suits me.”
He turned back, only to realize that Potter was still looking at him. There was something soft about the way he looked, about the way his head tilted a little. About the way his fingers stilled on the letter. His eyes were impossibly green. Draco wanted to hold it, wanted to—wanted to immerse himself in it. Wanted to recognize it as what it was, wanted to return. Wanted to give Potter something that bared himself but at the same time didn’t, that made him see him but at the same time didn’t—wanted to hold in his hands the soft ache that suffused his chest and ask,
The kitten is Draco.
Potter said, voice blooming across the hills.
“I know what you mean.” Narcissa placed her porcelain cup back to the plate. Her eyes were soft in a way he’d only seen when she was with him, and more so nowadays. She turned back to the gardens. “I never thought they’d flourish again. The gardens, I mean. The Manor had been through so much…darkness. The peacocks didn’t survive.”
“Scoot over, then.”
“You can stay in my office if you want.”
Cho, unfussed by the conversation, walked closer to the edge of the pen—to Draco—and tore loose strands of hay from the feeder. Draco hesitated, then pulled his gloves off. Carefully scratched her head. Her hair was short and tufted, her ear pliant to the bend of Draco’s fingers. Cho seemed to enjoy it and tore more hay from the feeder.
He made lists in his head, trying to ground himself. The things he needed to do: buy new terracotta pots, check on the orange trees, another round of hive inspections. Buy glass jars for the honey harvest. Buy tea. Sleep; sleep, sleep, sleep, sleep. He paced back and forth, barefoot on the herringbone-patterned wooden floor. The colors in his room: the buttery yellow of the walls. The varnished brown of the wardrobe, with a tint of copper red. The crisp white of his duvets, the dark green of his mug—the myriad of colors on his mug: the white petals and yellow crown of the narcissus, the pale green of the stem, the boney black of the veins on the leaves. Their house, their fourteen beehives and five hundred thousand bees, the chipped teapot in the kitchen, the gilded antique lamp, the gramophone that belonged to Harry’s Grimmauld Place but now he said belonged to them both. Harry. Were they roommates, friends, companions, ex-arch-nemesis who slashed each other open and saved each other from Fiendfyres and now raised bees together?
—and still Potter never hesitated to look at him. Never hesitated to lead him back when he lost himself in the middle of a frozen sea, never hesitated to lead him back to light from the middle of darkness.
Harry deadpans. “Kittens climb onto shoulders all the time.”
He looked out of the window.
He thought Draco was the head of a military coup that wanted to overthrow the Ministry, so he gave Draco gifts to lower his defenses and tease the secrets out of his mouth.
“I raise sheep.”
Then Potter suggested that he stay and rest, to which Draco replied that he was perfectly fine to head out. Potter insisted with
Splendid. Really. Potter looked at him as though he was genuinely interested in his life. Draco ate another spoonful of stew out of spite. “There is nothing to say about it.”
Later, coming down from soaring high, they were quiet. Draco found Harry’s hand underneath the duvets, hooked their pinkies. Harry turned his palm up and intertwined their fingers. Held Draco’s hand loosely in his.
“Almost. I looked for you.”
Draco stared at the empty space in front of him.
From across the fell, Cho approached them. She bumped into Molly, stumbled forward, and nudged at Draco’s hand.
“Harry James Potter. I buy you coffee every morning.”
“According to Oxford English, tradition is, oh,
He couldn’t look at her, but he made himself to. Astoria looked as though she wanted to hold his hand. In the end, she leaned closer, hesitant.
“I just…” Draco trailed off. “I just really miss her. And I don’t know if I will ever stop.” A part of him thought he never will. Thought he didn’t want to. A part of him thought he’d miss her even as she went on—even as she moved over him. He’d settle for that: watching her from afar, knowing he wouldn’t be able to come near again.
The sky was clear above them, thousands of stars embedded in the soft darkness. They seemed to be moving backwards with each step Potter took, but were back at their coordinates with a blink. Draco’s arms loosely circled Potter’s neck, his legs dangling at his waist. Potter was warm, too, his neck burning, a bare strip between the collar of his coat and his thick hair.
“Chocolate chip,” he said. Harry nodded.
The fire crackled in the hearth, casting warm lights on the rug and dragging long shadows over the short legs of the table, over the scarves hanging on the rail. Over Potter’s knee, which he’d drawn close to his chest. He had settled in the armchair beside the couch, nursing a mug of cider himself.
he wanted to say—bit the words back last minute and, when the music and laughter finally became too much, slipped back to his dorm. They deserve a bit of loosening after everything that’s happened, after all.
Draco woke up, disoriented to be in his own bedroom. Five thirty in the morning. London was still asleep, the soft, mellow lights of early morning filtering through the gauzy curtains.
On the nightstand by the bed, the vase of cleomes blooms in the young night.
“No. I’m not old yet and I’m older than you.”
The first lamb arrived on the hour before dawn, when the last of night still lingered and the first of dawn had already crept in, the soft lights mingling and catching on the thorn dykes. All Draco knew was that one day there was Hannah with a heavy belly, and the next Hannah with a mini-Hannah. Draco’s mouth fell open, his chest swelled. The tiny lamb trailed behind her and bleated. Short wool curled around its body, both of its ears black like earmuffs. The bottom of its four legs were also black, so it looked as though it wore thick socks.
Draco had smiled thinly.
to his original vet, who missed his messages. He cursed again. Cho was worn out, lying on the ground. Draco knelt beside her and pressed his head to hers, trying to hold back his constricting throat. Cho lifted her head slightly, breaths puffing out.
Potter didn’t move. So Draco pushed himself up, swaying, and stumbled to the kitchen. Rummaged through the cupboards, knocked over a bottle of vinegar and sent potatoes and onions rolling until he found a bottle. He raised it into the air in hollow triumph, then dropped his arm. Made his ungainly journey back to the couch as he uncorked it, and gulped down straight from the mouth of the bottle as he climbed back onto the mattress. The liquor burnt down his throat and set his neck on fire. Dribbled down his chin as he tipped it, again, slumping against the back of the couch.
Potter widened his eyes, incredulous. “You love it!”
Potter shrugged. Draco turned away in pique and greeted the lambs instead. He recognized each and every one of them as he knew his own family tree. It came so naturally to him he didn’t even need to think, didn’t even need to pay any mind to the marks on their face—one glance, and he knew this was Hannah’s son, and that one was one of Luna’s twins. Knew which ones liked to gallop and crash into its siblings, which ones liked to stay by their mothers. He held out his fingers for them to sniff, scratched their ears, let them scramble back to their mothers for milk. He was still sulking, though, by the time he walked out of the barn. Potter was trying to get a lamb to swallow a pill, cursing.
“See you,” Harry whispers, reaching out to scratch the kitten’s ears one last time. The kitten’s eyes blink into two thin lines, closing slowly.
It was just that it was the first time in six months he was asked. And speaking it aloud made it real, somehow. A phantom ache given a physical shape. Every syllable on his tongue the sharp edge of a knife.
He had a garden full of lemon trees.
Sometimes, questions fleeted the back of his mind. Did he know I was on the wrong side? On the enemies’ side? He had to. Draco
He touched his fingertip to their smiles.
“Let’s elope.”
A branch of lemon flowers bloomed across Harry’s chest.
Potter had tried to defend Hugo before admitting that yes, all babies do have ugly faces.
“And you just forgot their existence?”
Harry has tidied up his guest room simply because he didn’t know what else to do. Changed the sheets, fluffed up the pillows, pulled the curtains wide open and wiped the windows clean, reflections gleaming on the clear panes. Dug out an old lamp and placed it on the nightstand. It emits a warm, yellow light in the dark. He thinks he might call the shelter to see if they’ve taken in any kittens recently, see if they need fostering. It only lingers in the back of his mind, though, a fleeting thought.
“Because he doesn’t want to turn back into a human, of course.”
Cho, frightened by their hassle, quickly tumbled away to the rest of the flock.
“Japan,” Draco said. Harry startled, straightened and turned. “It’s from wizarding Japan. I’ve traveled there once.”
The stag looked at him with its almond-like eyes. Allowed him to brush his fingers along its silvery contour, to smooth down its back. A while later it flicked its tail and folded its legs, settling in front of Draco. Draco touched his hand to its neck, to its head. Immersed himself in the warmth of magic, of memory.
If he was being honest, it wasn’t because it was cheap. He’d just seen it one day, really, passing by the shop on his way home and glimpsed, through the clean glass panes, the rustic sign of a hammock on sale: white letters scrawled across a wooden board, all capitals and underlined twice. Underneath was a bundle the color of pale birch, rolled up tight with thick ropes.
“Did the shelter assign you a new one?”
Draco let out a laugh. “Oh, the irony. Seven years ago I said those exact words to you. I should throw your words back in your face.”
Potter Apparated them back to the cottage. Draco let him unbutton his coat, let him push it off his arms. The image of a mistaken Astoria replayed in his head in loops like a broken film projector. Draco let Potter push him gently onto the couch, blank.
Harry can see it, now, from the balcony of their tiny hotel room: a hint of pink from behind the rocks, appearing and disappearing behind the relentless waves. It is barely visible in the dusk. The sky is darkening, into the color of a ripened plum.
Draco laughed and turned back to face the sea. The wind rocked the hammock and they swayed, together, to the rhythm of the waves.
“That is totally not the picture—”
“Oh, come on.” Harry turns the hairdryer on. The air is warm and gentle as he starts to blow-dry the kitten, ruffling its fur with his fingers. “I was trying to give you a bath. You needed it. Come on.”
Lambing would most likely start somewhere through March and no, they wouldn’t need to take them into the barns, most of the sheep lambed well on their own. They’d just need to keep an eye on them, especially in early April when the rain would start; the first ones to lamb, too, since they’d have time for them before it got busy… Minutes later Draco learned that Cho and Luna had twins, Hannah a single lamb, Molly was the only one with triplets, Ginny and Anthony…
Draco ran a hand over Harry’s fringe, brushed it out of his eyes. Harry looked at him from underneath his eyelashes, dropped another kiss on the soft skin of his inner arm.
Draco dropped his gaze. The pot of rosemary had turned its attention to the windowsill, was tentatively touching its tips to it.
The fire crackled, blazing in the hearth.
blinded his eyes. Draco jolted, breaking out in sweat. His heart hammering in his chest.
Potter shook his head with a smile and disappeared into his bedroom to fetch cheap wine. Draco stared at the empty space before shaking his head, lifted the lid. The fresh smell of tomatoes poured, thick and sour.
Draco swallowed. The firelight bathed Potter in warm, golden light and softened his hard edges. There was a scar on his left cheek, Draco noticed. A faint one, a thin line that cut to the corner of his jaw and disappeared into his beard.
He himself doesn’t even know why he is here, really. It’s just that Hermione’s freaking out. She and Ron stayed in the guest room that drunken night, and woke up the next morning to another brunch. Ron brought up how the kitten eating its breakfast on the bookshelf was probably Malfoy—quite half-heartedly, a joke—and Hermione was stunned out of proportion. In lightning speed she secured an appointment at St. Mungo’s for Harry to visit the next day, hair frizzled when she finally finished the Firecall, soot smeared over her cheek. She looked rather distressed, so Harry complied just to make her happy.
“Okay, you know what.” Harry shuts the book. “I can’t read anyway.” It is true. He cannot. Luna says a lot of nonsensical things, yes, but this one nags at his mind. He cannot, however, think of the kitten as Draco in any way. Draco, with his polite after-the-war smile whenever Harry catches him in the Ministry on his way to visit Hermione’s office. Always looking a little tired. Their letters have just begun to lighten, have just begun to be dotted with occasional banter. Harry is still a little careful around him, these days. Draco is careful around him, too.
“No, no. Come.”
Slowly, Potter grinned. “Oh, very.”
Harry folded his arms behind his head and drifted off.
“We don’t have to weed,” Harry mumbled into the nook of Draco’s neck. Draco laughed softly.
“Yes, it’s Christmas.” Potter teased. Saw Draco’s face, then shook his head with a smile. “It’s fine, really. Not the first time anyway. At least you’re here for entertainment, eh?”
But Draco lost track of the conversation. He could only see himself dressed in a thin linen shirt, shivering in the early autumn night. Walking laps around the park until he couldn’t feel anything, until his toes had frozen numb and his trembling fingers thick, unable to hold onto the keys. Unable to jam them into the locks. The numbness that felt closer to sadness, like drowning in a frozen sea and slowly losing strength, losing feeling. Losing the fight even as you were still fighting. Giving up.
Harry had mumbled after Draco flicked on the lights for the eighth time to iron his robes and, despite Draco’s yelps, had proceeded to sprawl himself all over Draco so he couldn’t get up again.
Harry laughs. Pushes himself up, takes the mugs from Draco and places them on the table. Places, playfully, his hands on Draco’s hips. Draco slaps his left and brings it to his shoulder.
Heart heavy in his chest, Draco slowly padded towards Potter. Potter had clutched the quilt to his chin, hiding the hint of a sleep mark on his left cheek. He looked strangely soft, strangely open without his glasses—his eyes closed, lashes long. Hair mussed up with sleep. His glasses lay on the short table, folded half-heartedly.
He still went to the barn with Potter. The cold winter air cleared his head, as did the lifting of his heavy legs. Today Potter would, like every other day, collect the sheep that had recovered well enough and send them back to the fells. Draco was ready to head to the back and chat with Cho when Potter eyed him, and then tasked him with bringing Cho to the front of the barn.
Briefly, Harry lifts his gaze. Draco has tilted his head. Against the sunlight, Harry cannot quite make out his face, but it seems like his cheeks have flushed—a tinge of pink in the shadows.
A loud clack. The doors open.
“You’re insane,” was gritted through teeth before suddenly, he was hauled up. Draco’s legs gave before he could react—falling sideways before clinging onto Potter, breathing harshly. Potter arranged his arms, supported Draco’s body weight with a lift.
“I’m sorry,” he said. Backtracked the last moment and quickly fell quiet. Potter paused, the tiniest of movement, then resumed.
“We’re throwing up here! Get your own wedding to be gross!”
Tentative, dazed, awkward, Draco touched Harry’s arm. Drew him close. A series of steps in a dance that he’d known, that he hadn’t taken in years—folding Harry into his arms, Harry’s face tucked into the nook of his neck. Harry sniffed. He was warm and solid against Draco’s chest, under Draco’s hands, filling a space that had been empty and aching.
“You know, you said it was your favourite book,” Harry murmurs into the kitten’s soft fur. “You told me in one of your letters. You really are a snob, aren’t you? Whose favourite book is
A singular focus.
He had woken up at four this morning. His back hurt from sleeping on the stiff couch. He’d lain there, staring at the ceiling. A faint creak climbed from one corner to the near middle like the strings of a spider web. Faded stains blossomed like withered petals, yellow and soft. Grudgingly, he got up when Potter entered the living room and pushed past him to the bathroom. Came back to Potter sitting on the couch—the quilt pushed to the side, crumpled—pulling on his boots. Ready to leave.
He pulled the backdoor open. The air smelt of buttery pasta, smelt of rosemary. Kicking off his boots, Harry took a deep breath and smiled.
The kitten doesn’t understand him and tries, again, to climb onto his desk. Harry sighs, picks the kitten up again, and places it back where it was. He’s trying to write a letter. To Draco. Hermione said not to worry, but Harry cannot help it. He doesn’t have anything to do, anyway. He’ll just write a letter and bring the last one up very casually.
, waved his hand—tried to brush off the efforts. It made Draco dizzy, to see what such a small container had done to Potter. Made him proud in a way he hadn’t in a long time. He’d spent weeks making it: gathering the herbs, drying them, finding a corner to brew. Had meant for it to be a surprise, a belated gift of sort—a gift given with no reason other than it was a gift and should, thus, be given. Had dipped the comfrey roots and leaves in oil, the snowy yarrows, the bright yellow crowns of calendula flowers, the thin leaves of rosemary—picked as he cradled the pot of plant in his arms, humming. He’d noticed Potter’s hands for a while now. Always cut in one way or another when he came back to the cottage, the calloused skin cracking whenever the weather was cold. Potter didn’t care, of course, about the thin bleeding cuts, about his own hands: they were just hands, knocked hard like bark after years of chores. Never hesitated before hauling up a bale of hay onto the tractor. The thick ropes indented deep into his palm, cut through every rise and dip of skin, the exquisite web of veins.
Draco, as though through a fog, as though watching someone else do it, as though inevitable—raised his hands. Placed them by either side of Harry’s face. Harry’s words faltered, trailed off. Draco’s hands hovered by Harry’s cheeks, trembling slightly. Swallowed.
“Keep trying,” Harry whispers. “You have so many more.”
“It would have been unfair to you,” Draco said, voice low.
“Can we change the topic?” Draco asked quietly.
“For you,” he said. Draco took it, guarded.
“Haven’t you two been exchanging letters?”
Neither mentioned the lift.
“Ah, you know the market.”
“It’s not about me. It’s—”
It would be nice, Harry thinks, if Draco has a little kitten in him. Draco always seems so stiff whenever they talk. Always tense, as if waiting for a snarled remark from the bustling crowd around them. What does he look like, when he goes home and shrugs off his coat and sinks into his armchair? When he changes into his pajamas and lies in bed, just minutes before sleep?
Harry laughs despite himself. He knows that Ron is doing this on purpose, and he appreciates their voices filling up the empty space in his flat: the air silent and absent of even the tiniest of sounds, the sounds of dust motes landing on the wooden floor. Appreciates their bodies filling up the space, too large these days, as if the distance between each piece of furniture has doubled.
Potter dried his hands with a towel. “There’s salt,” he said defensively.
Draco didn’t know what to say. Potter, looking away, unconsciously touched the center of his chest. As if touching a scar.
“Is he?” Harry asks, absent-minded.
Harry gasped. Draco pressed his lips lightly to Harry’s—barely a brush—made to pull back, but then Harry started kissing him back. It was nothing like the day by the fireplace, the drunken endeavor: Harry opened his mouth up for them, winded his hands to Draco’s nape. His short beard rubbed at Draco’s cheek as he pulled him close, kissed him hard and full, his fingers a rough path at his jaw. His mouth hot, and Draco felt like dying and rebirth all at once. Felt like life itself, the unfurling of leaves in spring—his heart thrumming until he couldn’t think, could only touch, only sense. He cupped Harry’s jaw in his hands, tilted his head. Angled them deeper. Harry made a soft, muffled sound from the back of his throat. It unlocked a cupboard in Draco’s chest, something he’d covered up and long gathered dust out of fear—now it opened, welled, immersed Draco in the wild warmth of it all.
“Knowledge being?”
The umbrella charms barely worked. When Draco finally got to the barn his hair was dampened, his shirt and trousers soaked. Mindlessly, he cast a drying charm. Potter had already come and had gone out again for the sheep on the fell side. The barn bathed in the warm, golden light of old-fashioned bulbs and charms. The air was thick and heavy, warm. Threaded with the faint smell of hay layered on the bare ground. Draco headed towards the back corner, couldn’t help but smile when the pristine black face and white-tipped ears emerged into view.
That was how he started it:
“I’m sure Draco is just out of time,” Hermione says gently. The two of them have gotten close after the war, what with both of them working at the Ministry and all. Harry was a little surprised and, to be honest, a little jealous. There is still stiffness between them whenever he and Draco talk, as if their history has never truly dissipated. No more hostility, no, but never as natural as actual friends.
All peaceful until Potter barged through the doors.
“He wants me out of the house,” Draco repeated, stomach cold and numb with dread.
Draco smiled, abashed, even though Harry cannot see. They fell into comfortable silence again. Draco did not feel the need to hang up. Outside the window the night had fallen, the early hours of the dark, a tinge of light still lingering—as though the colors had not yet spilled fully, were still drifting to cover the side of a house, the tip of a thin branch.
“You’ve got no manners,” Draco says, and then buttons his collar back up one by one. His knuckles graze Harry’s neck. Harry watches him, swaying a bit and smiling loosely.
“I should get going.”
The kitten is still there. Still in the shadows, not even having moved an inch.
He dozed off like that. Remembered, at the verge of drifting into sleep, Harry’s face underneath the soft moonlight. The carve of his nose, the plains of his cheeks. The faint scar on his left cheek, disappearing into his beard. His lips, soft and open. Sometime during the night he woke up to Harry’s cries, the moment Harry jolted awake from his nightmare—his eyes wide open, a sheen of sweat on his forehead. Staring at the ceiling, as though still seeing the haunted memory.
The current flowed more rapidly then he’d expected, crashing and parting at his shin. Draco bit his bottom lip, carefully took a small step forward, desperately trying to grapple at the slippery bottom with his feet. Took another step—lost his balance and swung wildly forward—reeled himself back, hands swaying in the air. His heart pounded in his chest. Small step by small step he managed to cross the rapid stream, his feet frozen numb, and then the bush of dear, dotted yellow was in front of him. Draco let out a breath, reaching out to grab at the rock, any place on the rock, when suddenly his feet slipped from underneath him—
Harry is startled and, to be honest, a little hurt. He tries to call the kitten back down, pops open a can of its favourite salmon, but the kitten ignores him. When he reaches blindly into the depth of the bookshelf, it hisses and bites him.
“Chicken with pesto sauce,” Draco muttered.
“Happy New Year,” Draco said quietly. Potter turned his head, acknowledged it with a small smile. Turned back.
“Go back to bed.”
“Okay, fine.” Harry huffs, and reaches out to the cupboard for another flavour. “Try this one, then.”
He hadn’t done this in decades, the gathering ingredients from plants with his own hands: the leaves, the stems, the roots, the flowers. Had only realized that he’d missed it immensely after he started again a few days ago. The delicate unearthing of roots, careful not to hurt the skin of it; the picking of leaves, the ginger plucking of petals. To know that there is neither a best ingredient nor a best part of plants, only the most suitable for its purpose. Dirtying his fingertips, feeling the soil, body focused on the task at hand whereas his mind wandered somewhere else altogether. It brought him peace he hadn’t realized he’d yearned for years, like staying with the new-born lambs in the barn, like drawing with charcoal. Quieted his tangled mess of a mind. There was something about watching plants sprout and unfurl in spring, of watching the buds bloom into flowers and carefully, unapologetically, stretch its petals. His rosemary had blossomed happily by the window, in the soft light of spring. Decorated in purple flowers like a bridal dress. Potter caught him murmuring to it as it curled its tip around his outstretched finger—caught him blushing furiously down his neck, and smiled. Suggested he try and contact Longbottom.
He falls asleep without meaning to. When he blearily climbs back awake, the kitten is curled into a ball on his chest. Back rising and falling faintly with each breath, warm above his rib cage.
Just a glimpse. But it stayed with him; passing the shop each day on his way home, the memories overlapped like layers of oil paint until one day, he simply went in and bought the hammock. Trying to get it home was a hassle. Twenty minutes later he gave up on the Muggle way and, making sure no one was watching, cast a levitating charm instead and carried it home, where it promptly got stuck in the middle of the door frame.
Draco stared into the empty air, fingers loose on the charcoal.
“Hey.” Potter suddenly appeared. “You okay?”
Potter left the room. Draco, still transfixed in the moment of haze, still holding his breath—let it out. Buried his face into his hands, the bandage rough on his cheek. He pushed himself up and made to leave the room, made it to the door when he caught sight of the messily piled coats and sweaters, draped over one another on the back of the chair.
The alley morphs into a busy road, and then into a bustling farmer’s market. Harry slows his pace to help the kitten maintain its balance, but the kitten has apparently mastered the art of it and bats away Harry’s hand every time he reaches up to help. They reach Joe, the butcher.
“We broke up.”
the old man said, and gifted it to him. Draco was drunk enough to accept and, through his tipsiness, remembered to ask about the warming charms. Now the rosemary curled around his wrist with thin and tentative stems, a pot of warmth.
“I thought you didn’t want to travel.”
“Mm, you saw.”
Potter stopped dead in his tracks.
Ron grins like it’s splitting his face. “Yeah. Oh my god.”
“Oh, you’re awake.” Potter took his glasses off and wiped the snow off them. He was covered in white: the folds of his thick coat, his trousers, his heavy boots. His beanie and his scarf. Potter unwrapped the scarf from his neck and batted the flakes off. “Have you had any cider?”
“Oh, splendid. I’m stuck here for six months, just what I always—”
Harry nodded again, then shuffled to the living room. Draco pushed the trays into the oven, set the timer, and anxiously followed him into the living room, too. Harry had curled on the couch, was yawning. Draco hovered close.
“I’m not really…” Words evaporated from Draco’s head as Potter leaned in, just a fraction. Faltered, then leaned in all the same, slowly—slowly. Draco caught him tilting his head before his own eyelids dropped close, still trying to make out the words, still trying to say as his voice trailed off, “I’m not really trying to…”
“Your hands smell so nice,” Harry murmured, voice muffled into the cradle of Draco’s palms. Draco glanced at Harry and, blushing, quickly looked away again.
Draco unwrapped the paper. Soft wool pooled into his hands: a cashmere sweater, warm and light and mustard-yellow.
“Even if it wasn’t to court you,” Harry swallowed, “even if it wasn’t—I would have given you all those gifts. They made you happy. I just wanted to see you happy. And you don’t have to—give me an answer, if you don’t want to. Whenever you’re ready—if you’re ever ready—I’ll always be, I’ll always—”
“Use an expansion charm.”
Draco hummed, nonsensical. Harry covered his hands with his own and stroked his knuckles. His hands were larger than Draco’s, calloused but soft, firm. Draco, in turn, stroked Harry’s belly and earned another chuckle.
“Why on earth are you paying attention to my skin condition?”
“—hippogriff in a circus? Should I jump through rings of fire for your pleasure? Or—”
The bright grey of his eyes is the only thing Harry sees clearly.
Draco pushed himself up, shaking with rage. “That is what we
“How much did you pay Pansy for this?”
The nightmares still ghost behind his eyelids. They ghost behind every one of theirs.
. Fumbled with his pockets and pulled out a small thing: a small, round container made of cherry wood, the amber tree rings stretched long and etched in. He tossed it to Potter, who caught it mid-air—surprised.
“They’re horribly famous,” Harry said, by way of explanation. He took a sip of his tea. Draco carefully held the tiny, delicate box with his fingers; then, not trusting his hands to be steady, carefully placed the tiny, delicate box on the table.
“You know what—” Potter pushed himself up, strode into the kitchen—into the space beside Draco. Fetched the kettle from a cabinet under the sink, ran the tap for water, turned on the stove. Draco watched it all with uncomfortable silence. Noticed, as they stood side by side, that he was taller than Potter. A mere inch, but still.
“There, see?”
“Did it hurt, too?” Draco asked, quiet. Afraid, suddenly feeling like a child. “When you broke up with Ginevra?”
It’s just that it has only arrived. Kind of. A couple more days won’t hurt, will they? He’s always liked to spend time with his kittens, has always liked to watch them grow even if he never ends up keeping any of them. (Ron and Hermione never give up on persuading him. They never give up on trying to have him name the kittens, either, even though he never does.)
Harry came up beside him, breath heavy. He was smiling.
Sleep washed over him in waves.
“Oh,” Pansy echoed. She was examining her nails. “What news.”
“I was wrong. I…I wasn’t thinking.” Harry runs his hand through Draco’s hair. Just the tips of his fingers—like pushing a boat into sea, slow and wobbly. Draco closes his eyes. Harry does it again, and again—pauses at the warmth of Draco’s nape, cups his head. “I don’t think, remember?”
Then he wakes.
“Don’t worry about it,” Hermione sighs. “It’s an ill timing.”
Malfoy shrugs and invites himself to sit on Ron’s bed, bouncing as he falls, feet dangling. He is quieter this year. Muted, almost. Stays to the sides of the corridors and the back corners of the classrooms, chopping up beetle wings and brewing potions alone. Eats porridge at breakfast with his head hung low, spoonful by spoonful.
Draco couldn’t look at him with his burning cheeks, his burning neck.
“Is this what you want?” Potter asked, voice breaking towards the end. Every syllable brushed their lips together, made Draco shiver. Or maybe it was just the weight of them at being so close. Just an imaginary touch, a hopeless hallucination.
“Always.”
The ghost of the memory of her was all he could see.
It took a good while looking for houses. Time floated by; Harry liked most houses but didn’t particularly feel for any, so Draco kept saying
On the other side of the living room, Potter sat in the armchair and read letters, his glasses sitting low on his nose. The owl perched on the rack covered in coats. Occasionally it shook its feathers, a little stretch of wings and a rustle—folded them back with a tilt of its head. It had flown through the heavy rain for miles and miles, was worn out upon arrival. Now it baked itself quietly in front of a burning kerosene lamp, its snowy feathers dry. It reminded Draco of Potter’s old owl, which always lifted a lazy eye whenever he visited the owlery before going back to sleep. Hedwig, he remembered. He wondered where it had gone.
Draco, mind still dizzy, didn’t catch up immediately. It was only after he saw Potter’s strained smile that he realized he’d fucked up. The towel was awkward in Potter’s hands, as if he were trying hard not to look away. Trying hard so his smile didn’t fall apart.
This was more than enough.
“I don’t have any marshmallows.”
His ears are still ringing from when Draco slammed the door and Disapparated with a deafening crack. This is all they seem to do, these days: argue, scream things they don’t mean, Draco disappears overnight and Harry lies on his side of the bed staring, staring, staring into the dark abyss even though all he wants is to sleep. Kiss with their eyes averted, things heat up and turn frantic and he loses his head, again, pressing Draco against the couch with half-closed eyes, it doesn’t even matter just—ah—
With the ginger-head gone, the kitten loses interest and starts grooming.
A figure slid into the seat across from him. Draco raised his head, ready to tell Pansy to—
“It would have caused mortal panic.”
“Calm down, Merlin.” Potter pushed him in the direction to the bathroom, down the short corridor, with a hand on his back. “It’s just Brussels Sprouts.”
A flinch, a dimming in the burning green eyes. It was almost enough for the way his chest tore at the lie.
Draco still donned a full suit every time he walked through the beehives, which he felt humiliated by, even if Harry never said anything. His fingers trembled. The bees never minded his wobbly hands. They climbed on and off his thickly-gloved palms, through the gaps between his fingers, thin, intricate wings buzzing with each tiny step.
“How does it not hurt? How can it not hurt when I keep doing this to you?”
“Hey,” he said again. “Okay?”
“I shouldn’t have prodded like that, I’m—I’m sorry.”
He didn’t know how much time had passed when Potter dropped down next to him. Time was measured in rough strokes, in thin, drafted lines, in the rustle of charcoal against parchment—and then it was thrown into disarray. Draco hastily crumpled the paper to the side. Potter’s eyes flickered, but he said nothing.
“No,” Draco says, still smiling. As if he cannot help the curve at his lips. Bathed in golden lights in the dark, dressed in white robes hemmed with gold, Draco glows. Or perhaps it is the faint blush on his cheeks, the colour of a ripened peach. Or perhaps it is the way his face softens with his smile. Or the way his clear grey eyes catch the golden light like a star, fine lines trailing each corner and marking the folds of his mirth.
Potter chuckled. “They had their fun, that’s for sure. How about you?”
“Lilies?”
He pushed the gate open.
“Yeah?” Harry kisses him. A peck, light on the lips. “Is that what it was?”
You can imagine that we don’t generally recommend it as our first choice of solutions: the sudden transformation can be a blow to the victim’s mind and their magical core. But in this case, it would be suitable to perform the operation.”
Inside sat a wooden box. Draco unclasped the leather straps, opened it: two tiny shelves lifted up with the lid, revealing tube after tube of oil paint. Draco’s heart pounded. He touched a finger to them, slid it over; Sennelier Paint. One of the very best brands. The tubes of paint, filled to their fullest and packed closely to one another, glinted silver under the lights, exuberant.
“A man can never take too many naps.”
“And are you going to steal my ice cream again, just like that time?”
“How is it you’re suddenly interested in my love life?”
The kitten, however, nips Harry’s hand again. Harry groans. The kitten keeps meowing, looking back and forth between the table full of meat and Harry.
“Of course he does. It’s awful.” Hermione tucks a strand of loose hair behind her ear and looks to the kitchen again. Her smile says that it’s the exact opposite of awful. “I can recite the lyrics of every single song on the wireless this week backwards.”
Draco sneaks an arm around his waist, pulls him close. Harry leans into his touch. Noses at the hollow of Draco’s throat, the soft skin, the intimate warmth.
They didn’t even need Lumos. The snow reflected the moonlight and glowed sliver; above them, stars lit the night sky like broken diamonds. A million pieces of them, until the dark sky was nothing more than a foil alongside. The night was quiet, tranquil. Their boots crunched in the snow, leaving a long trail of footprints behind.
Beside him, Draco stares ahead. He never says a word after nightmares. Instead he shuffles out of bed and, after burying his face into his hands for a moment, leaves their bedroom with soft and exhausted footsteps.
“Oh, darling,” Draco says, pleased, and with a swift motion he pulls a grumbling Harry close and sways them right back onto the beat. “You love it when we dance.”
“You were eating them while you cooked the tea,” Harry murmured.
A warm tingle of Potter’s magic, of wood smoke and cider, then Potter’s fingers were on the back of his hand: cool with cream, rough with callouses. He gently spread the cream out. His head was right at Draco’s nose, so close he could see every strand of messy hair—could smell the faint smell of clean soap on him, of sheep, of the sweet grass after rain. Could feel the heat radiating off him, a steady hum. Warm. Lulling.
The kitten climbs onto the desk again and finds its way to the only words on the blank parchment. He has been sitting here for nearly an hour, and all he’s written is
Harry chuckled. “Is it, now?”
Their cottage was close by the sea. Every night the waves rocked them to sleep, slow and steady.
“He won’t see anybody.” Harry sighed. A noise came from the other side, as though he was shifting, was stretching his legs. “Andy is making pudding after dinner. Says that’ll probably bribe him out.”
The syllables on his tongue feel hoarse, scratchy. Too loud. He swallows. The bed is too large for him to reach out—he could never touch Draco, he is too far away—yet relentless waves push them forward, closer, closer—
“You okay?”
Potter didn’t hear him. Went straight to the bathroom, yawning. Sleep marks tender on his left cheek.
It felt nice to be held like this, warm and close. Enveloped. The fire crackled in the silence, startling him from drifting into sleep every now and then. Potter chuckled. Draco felt it reverberate through his chest and closed his eyes again.
Under the warm lights, the owl stretched its amber wings.
“I can’t take it.”
“No, no—no, I mean…why did you call it Draco?”
“I suppose it’s understandable.” Luna smoothes a hand down the kitten’s back, chewing the cookie. “Being a human is rather hard sometimes.”
Draco looked back at Cho. She chewed on the hay she’d stolen from him, unfussed.
Harry shoots up from his seat, dizzy from the sudden movement.
“Believe what you want, Malfoy.”
“Of course you can,” Harry said, firmly, and the matter was settled.
“No one is dancing properly, anyway.” Harry leans in to whisper, “We can’t steal the thunder.”
“She’s a muse, that’s no doubt.” Potter dabbed at his jaw at last, and pulled away. Draco instantly missed the closeness, but was clearheaded enough to refrain himself from leaning in, to open his eyes.
“You are horrible,” Draco said, bending down again to finish this frame. “You’ve no respect for privacy. How long have you been watching?”
“Wait, what—what did I do? Is that really you? Merlin, it’s really you. Gee.” Harry laughed, incredulous, as he walked over. That, too, was too much. A sudden spring of waterfall over a croaked land that for a split second, shook the land with its simplicity. Draco’s throat thickened. Such stupidity. “Am I that horrifying to see? Am I that dirty? I mean, the hills were pretty muddy with the rain last night. Gee, the first thing you do when you see me again is to cry. What else did I expect?”
he thought.
Draco mumbled, nodded. Potter’s footsteps were soft; paused, as the lights shifted behind Draco’s half-shut lids—the door closing, leaving only a thin gap—then resumed again, faded. Draco burrowed himself into the duvet. The mattress, warm and welcoming, gave in under his weight. Took him in. Draco clutched the duvet close and rubbed his head into the pillows. They smelt faintly of Potter, of the clean scent of soap. Draco shifted and sank further into the bed, letting out a deep breath.
“I don’t want you out of the house, Draco.”
Harry grinned. There was no condescension, only teasing. “Ah. I have plenty if you’d like to take some back. London had awful cider, doesn’t it? There goes another reason why I can’t go back. I do live off cider...”
A thousand different answers flow through his head. Harry tries to catch one, tries to translate the brightness into syllables, tries to give shape to it, the air vibrating to make space for his voice—
Harry has been fostering kittens for years now. It started only as a part of his therapy, but now he cannot imagine his life without it. He had thought he would try out with dogs, what with Sirius being a giant black dog and all, but it had proved to be too much. In the end, he’d found solace in places he never thought he would.
It seemed ridiculous, too, to have cared about it. He missed flying.
Harry laughed and tugged him along. Draco spent the rest of their journey with his cheeks tinged pink. He could get used to this, he thought. Walking along the Thames by sundown with Harry. Once in a year, perhaps. Maybe twice. But this was good, this was enough.
Potter’s smile, too, was empty. His shoulders tense. He looked away, and when he looked back, Draco dreaded everything he had to say.
“I know,” Draco said, even if he didn’t. He just wanted to end this conversation altogether. Didn’t want to listen to Potter go on about how he regretted it, no matter the reason.
“Three?”
“Fuck,” Harry whispered. A quick huff into the telephone, a broken attempt at a laugh. “Fuck, Draco. I want—oh god. I want to see you. I want to cook dinner in the kitchen with you, I want to wake up next to you in the morning, I…I miss you. So bad. Fuck, Draco, I miss you. I want to touch you, I want—”
Draco huffs, annoyed.
“Shut up,” Draco mumbled again, his cheeks still flushed.
Draco had said,
“I want to try,” Draco said. The wind carried the tumbling words away. Harry repeated it in his mind;
“I didn’t mean to fall,” Draco whispered. The pot of rosemary waved its thin stalks from the windowsill, showing off a braid of tiny purple flowers. The herbs he’d gathered today now lay between a stack of parchment, neatly and gently arranged. The yellow calendulas shone their lovely petals a bright egg-yolk.
Draco woke to a faint headache. Disoriented and bleary, he tried to open his eyes as he pushed himself up.
The blank parchment was smudged in soot, crumpled.
“God,” he sighed, trembling. His legs were trembling. His fingers were trembling. “So nice to see you. So nice to see you.”
“So are you. How is it you’re so tight lipped about your girlfriend?”
“Ten years, and all the while you’ve been…hiding in the mountains and—making cheese?”
“Yes.” Draco’s mouth was dry as he swallowed. “There wasn’t much else to do.”
“Well.” Potter dropped the meat onto the cutting board without looking at him. “I guess you’ll just have to deal with it.”
The kitten meows.
Malfoy rummages through the nightstand between the two beds and,
The river flooded. Draco could only fall to his knees on the bank.
because Draco wouldn’t have anyone know he was secretly very sweet. Draco woke up with shadows under his eyes still, smiling tiredly every morning, and Harry could no longer laugh when he touched the soft, bruised skin.
“Wait, what—” Harry struggles to untie his apron as he stumbles over the register, “Draco, wait—”
It was meant to be chaste, but they drew it long—Draco unwilling to let go, Harry complying. It slowed into a drag of lips and mingled breaths, until someone knocked on Michael’s door two offices down and Draco, suddenly remembering where he was, pulled away. Harry’s eyes were still dazed, and it took Draco three tries to successfully stop him from chasing him back into the kiss.
Cho flicked her tail, quiet.
“I haven’t flown a broom in years,” Draco said quietly.
instead of
Draco whipped his head around. The world temporarily lost its balance.
“No, really.” Draco coughed a little more. Potter leaned over him to fetch the glass of water on the nightstand. “Your quilt is horrible, too. Where did you even get it?”
“The whole United Kingdom,” Draco argued loudly, waving his arms about, “is a great wet drain. The whole sixty million acres of it. Not a single inch of it is dry. Not a
Hermione slaps his arm, blushing furiously now. Harry barks a laugh, trying to dodge Hermione’s arm and stop her at the same time.
Harry smoothed Draco’s hair over his shoulder so it didn’t get into his mouth. His hair wasn’t all that long so it fell back, locks slipping and catching on the fabric of Draco’s pajamas. Harry nestled close still, his nose to Draco’s nape, an arm wrapped loosely around Draco’s midriff.
“Hangover potion,” said Potter’s voice.
Draco hums. “Take a guess.”
Harry’s face heats with embarrassment. He hasn’t been paying attention, no, but he really should be. It is his best friends’ wedding, after all.
“I’ve missed you,” he said. Quiet, a little helpless in the searching of Harry’s face. Harry noticed his tone and shifted closer, wrapped his arm over his back. His fingers a mindless caress, light.
“Draco simply doesn’t like too many sunflower seeds. They are good for tea, but—”
Harry covered his hands at his collar. “Where else could I go?”
“Ha ha, very funny.”
Draco’s mouth fell open. “How dare you!”
His mother liked for them to sit in the gardens when he visited. Facing the flowering vines and bushes, the birches and oaks thick with foliage, she closed her eyes. Draco thought he saw the smile again in her wrinkled cheeks, or perhaps the ghost of it. The breezes wafted the faint aroma of flowers near, folded it into her billowing dress.
“Well,” Harry asks, “What is it you want to say?”
He’d listened first for the bathroom. Then he looked for him in the kitchen, the living room, the garden—walked through the rows of tomato vines, the berries and the flowers, trudged through the bushes of rosemary and thyme, batting away the thin branches as he passed the short fruit trees—and finally he found Draco on the hammock, blond hair glinting in the early morning sun.
He takes a shower, turns the water to the coldest. Stands under the spray and breathes through his mouth. Stays there several seconds, forehead pressed against the cold tiles.
“I shouldn’t have kissed you—”
“Are you trying to bribe me?” Draco laughs softly, enjoying himself. “With kisses?”
Draco traced the large, loopy letters, then traced Harry’s face, then traced Harry’s smile.
“Yours,” Potter said without looking up, fastening his boots.
“Scary things, they were. Not entertaining at all.” Draco pointed his mug at Potter. “They chase you to death. Either they win or they go down with you.”
“You like animals?” Potter asked.
“I am.”
She wasn’t Astoria.
“Third drawer down the middle cabinet. No, not that one, the one on the—yes.”
Potter eyed him. Knowing he couldn’t brush it off, Draco got the words out with a tight smile. “I was. I sure hope I know better now.”
“That’s Neville,” Potter said with a crooked grin.
“I didn’t know you cooked,” Potter said quietly as he handed Draco the towel.
That night he couldn’t sleep. His mind a dull storm of ache, of want, of anger, tossing and turning him on the couch as he stared at the empty hearth. At the kerosene lamps, now extinguished, the glasses grey and nebulous. At a sooty mark on the back of the couch, a smear like the trailing end of a comet. Like a heartless stroke of charcoal, a brush. Remembered Potter’s fingers gentle on his cheek, days ago, his face hidden in shadows. Remembered the first night he woke up here, right on this couch. He’d come to Scotland wandering in the snow, like he had back in London, walking until he was numb frozen—until the numbness in his chest was at last tangible, was not only a hollow in his chest eating him alive. Instead he had woken up in front of a fire. Had woken up covered in a heavy quilt, warm all over.
“No,” Harry answers, even though there is no question. He starts to trace the shell of Draco’s ear. Draco sighs softly. When he opens his eyes again, he looks nervous.
“I want to…move on,” Draco mumbled, slipping away. “’m so tired.”
“Mm hmm.”
They were back at the heather fields. Harry finished setting up the last beehive and came to sit beside Draco, who had already taken off his boots and settled on the edge of the hills, barefoot. He was smiling, had closed his eyes and tipped his head back. His hair ruffled by the wind, his shirt billowing. He was bright against the tender blue sky, against the sea of heather, purple and pink rippling in the wind.
He didn’t know for how long he knelt. His thoughts were murky with sleep when footsteps approached—hasty, distant yet undeniable. Boots crunching through snow. Accompanied was Potter cursing, his wand high in the air with a
Tears followed as he laughed wetly, as he tried to wipe them away. Potter touched him tentatively—Draco hadn’t even noticed him approaching—and pulled him into a loose embrace. Draco dropped his head on Potter’s shoulder and cried silently.
He wandered about. His boots were heavy as he lifted them above the deep layer of snow with each step. There was more than white in the world, after all, in the endless rolling hills. Angular oak trees and thorn dykes stood in the snow like coal; far in the distance, a forest of Scottish Pines stretched over the bottom of hills. He discovered a short stone wall and walked along. Hares burst out of their burrows without warning, shooting by his feet—he stumbled and almost lost his balance. A flock of fieldfares stroked the pale sky and disappeared.
Somewhere between the lines, Draco cradles his face helplessly. Pulls him down, and kisses him.
“No. No, I mean…that doesn’t make any sense. I didn’t name it Draco. Its name isn’t—”
Then there, at the far left corner of the table, were the Potters. James laughed his head off while baby Potter zoomed in and out of the picture on a tiny broom, frightening a ginger cat into screaming and scrambling. Lily tried to catch him but got an armful of cat instead, which bolted into her arms with so much force it knocked her down. She laughed, too, on the floor. Baby Potter’s eyes were huge, face split in an enormous grin. His hair already messy, twitching in every direction.
“Hey.” Harry’s throat thickens. He cups the kitten and nudges it closer to him, burying his nose into its soft fur. “I’m sorry. I’m sorry for today. I’m sorry.”
“A fond memory!” Draco spluttered. “I’ll have you know, Potter, never in my life had I been—”
it starts to eat. First tiny munches, and then it starts to wolf down the food as if it had starved for days. There is a high chance it has. Harry chuckles sadly as he smoothes a hand down the kitten’s back, trying to gently comb through the knots in its dirty fur.
“I’ve changed.”
“Just murmuring to myself, is all.”
After a long moment of silence, of looking into each other’s eyes, Harry asks, soft and out of nowhere, “Water?”
Draco touched it with the tips of his fingers. He probably shouldn’t look at it so blatantly, so often, shouldn’t touch it as though he was drawn to it. But he was. This scar, this pink, oval mark the size of a coin, was the lock to Harry’s death—and his life. If he touched it, some day he would unlock it. Harry never stopped him, only watched. Sometimes he fell asleep like that, Draco’s hand warm against his chest.
“Cherries and mint. I also added cinnamon and celery seeds. It’s good if you want to spot the Wrackspruts.”
“Are these—are these all of them?”
It was the last snow of the year. Draco had hurried out of the cottage in a roughly pulled-over jumper, had slowed his breath in the silence. Had stilled alongside the world, as if he were a part of it—a needle on a branch, or a feather on the wings of a tiny fieldfare—as if he were in it and not merely a watcher. He stuck his tongue out in the air—hesitant and tentative, after checking back and forth that no one was watching—trying to catch a piece of flake on the tip of his tongue. He did, and tasted nothing. Tiny, folded flakes landed and melted on the warmth of his palm. His body was still warm from sleep, soft. He looked over his shoulder and caught Potter leaning against the doorframe. From this distance he couldn’t make out his face, and yet he blushed still. A while later Potter walked back into the cottage, the door shutting without sound.
Sweaters pooled into his hands. Not just one sweater—but three, each a different color, each thick and woolen and soft. Ink green and cream, which were what Draco had answered; the last one wine red, a joke to making him wear Gryffindor colors. Draco pulled up the sweaters. They were warm where they rubbed at his fingers.
Later, after the kitten has licked the can
Draco looked at the gardens, then. Dusk had just begun to fall, covering the bushes and grass in a thin veil of mauve. The setting sun hemmed a ring of gold around the contours of oaks and birches and shadowed the tips of winding vines, framed the supple willow a few feet down. The sky weaved a smudge of pink into the blues, the yellows.
His blood pulsed in his ears. Heart pounding painfully against his chest.
Six months. Six months, and Harry is still amazed by how a touch can calm Draco down without a single word.
“That would be prefect.”
“Is it worse than the peacocks?” he asked, voice low.
“So—so I don’t know, I mean, I know that it’s—but why would he—”
“I don’t know.”
“Oh. Yeah. You really didn’t know? I thought the Prophet would be all over it.”
“No?”
“This,” Draco croaked, pinching the embroidered golden vines and leaves against brick red, “is awful.”
“Can you walk?” Potter asked. Draco tried standing on his own—couldn’t. His legs were exhausted as well as numb, and now felt as though a thousand tiny ants were eating them alive. He held onto Potter’s arm, yelped in pain when Potter tried to move him. At last Potter lifted him onto his back with an annoyed huff and started his way.
He did not wake again until dawn. Climbed blearily awake, searched for the space beside him—empty. It was just a morning like any other, him splayed out alone in his bed. Then he remembered and jolted, head pounding clear. Pushed himself off the bed, hissing at the cold floor as he stumbled to the living room, a name ready on his tongue—
Draco, startled, held out his palm. Potter placed a sheep cake on it. As soon as he lowered his hand, a sheep munched it away. Draco blinked.
Late spring. The flowers were blossoming; the bees were busy, flying back and forth between the hives and the flowers, dancing to show each other where to collect nectar. Harry felt it every year deep in his bones: the world slowly awakening underneath his feet from the deep slumber of winter, letting out a final exhale as it stretched into and embraced the warmth in the air.
Draco blinked again, turned. Potter was worrying his lip. Saw something in Draco’s expression, and quickly explained that—
Draco choked on the cider—burnt his tongue, coughed, spluttered all over himself. Potter looked at him amusedly as he struggled to recover himself. When he did, he tried to glare at Potter, but all that came out was disbelief.
“Ah…yes, yes it is.”
Inhale again.
Draco complains a lot these days.
They ate, Harry much quieter than usual. Draco tried to chat but to no avail, getting nothing more than a remark, a quick laugh. He sent Harry to the living room while he did the dishes. Dried his hands with a towel, and when he stepped into the living room Harry was studying a tiny cherry tree on the hearth. It was wooden carved, sat in a tiny pot with a tree full of blossoms. The petals, now and then, fell in a soft shower of pink, as if a breeze had brushed through the branches.
Draco swung his legs off the couch. It made him dizzy, and he had to close his eyes. “No, thank you very much.”
“Ah. They were spoiled things. Pecked everywhere and destroyed my dahlias. I never liked them since, but stubborn creatures they were and they flourished and grew to a family of eighteen.”
“For you,” Draco simply said. Then went back to his drawing and tried to ignore his pounding heart.
The worker shrugged and swung the towel back over his shoulder. “Your call, sir.”
“Sixty Galleons.”
“Well,” Harry looks back down again, swallowing, “it’s you. Who wouldn’t want to go with you?”
“To see your exhibition.”
Three weeks ago, the international transportation ban lifted. The letters were now free to come and go. Potter, in turn, started receiving letters every two or three days; from Weasley and Granger, from Longbottom, and occasionally from Dean Thomas. He read them aloud to Draco whenever he found the news amusing. Granger had delivered on the twenty-fourth of February. Attached in her letters was a photograph of baby Hugo, who had a large wrinkly face and looked as though he was squinting. His tiny fists, enclosed in his baby clothes, waved about in the air.
“Ah. You saw one?”
He slammed a piece of paper onto the table—
