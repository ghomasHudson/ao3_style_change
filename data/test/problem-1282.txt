Alastair arrived with two horse-drawn carriages full of treasure. Scrolls of high-quality silk cloth from Libya, jewel-encrusted sword and dagger, beautiful jewelry, gold coins, and several marble statues. These were wedding gifts from the God of War to the King of Sparta.
Draco could only be tight-lipped when Harry says that thing. He didn't want to justify his words, nor did he want to deny it either. So Draco better keeps quiet.
Draco paused in the middle of the garden. Why does it feel like he is being watched? But Draco found no sign of any other living thing, apart from the occasional insect sound. Maybe it's just his feelings that are paranoid.
Draco let out a gasp, feeling his face flush. “Don’t...you...that — It’s still dirty…” Draco stuttered as a shiver ran up his spine.
Luna took off her weird glasses, and her eyes now settled on Draco without something covering it. "You kissed a guy you just met?" she asked with a giggle.
The three of them walked back through the halls. Tonight is so cold, but suddenly, Pansy paused. Draco and Blaise looked at her, confused.
"At that time, we were all desperate. No medicine or antidote could cure you. The Oracle took you unconsciously to the palace, and a week later, he came back with medicine. Only he made me promise." The King of Sparta, despite having a large and stout body looked helpless with grief.
"Ah! I forgot, Professor Snape asked me to see him tonight. You guys can go first," Draco stated, remembering his promise to Snape, which coincidentally saved him from this super awkward situation. "Bye." Then with lightning speed, Draco walked away from Blaise and Pansy.
Harry growled internally. He thought he could threaten Harry by letting himself starve. He did not know that Harry would use any methods to get Draco to surrender to him.
Harry clenched his jaw hard when he saw Draco currently walking towards him with Cedric right beside him. Draco's hand gripping Cedric's hand for some reason made his heart feel like it was being burned by an unquenchable ember.
"This bird isn't dead, Your Majesty. It's still breathing," said Draco disapprovingly, then gently stroked the little bird's head with his thumb.
"Good evening, Your Majesty Draco, Your Majesty Harry." said the young man as he stopped right in front of the throne Harry and Draco were sitting on.
When Draco woke up in the morning, he realized that it was not a dream. Oh yeah, the clothes are neatly attached to his body, and everything looks fine. But the unusual pain and the moisture on his buttocks and the lingering scent of Harry's perfume all over him made Draco realize that last night Harry had actually visited this room and made love to him.
"Rest again if you still feel tired. You can sleep in this room or if you prefer your room. Alden will bring your breakfast in a moment." Harry brushed Draco's hair before he finally walked and opened the bedroom door. "My guest is coming today, so I will be kinda busy. You can take a walk to the garden if you want." He uttered, then disappeared behind the door.
"What about Your Majesty? What is Your Majesty doing here? Wasn't Your Majesty allowed to travel with Arabelle?" Draco cut in quickly without caring if his actions would result in him being branded unethical by his husband.
"I'm the God of Wine, so I'm familiar with the Greek way of partying, but the way you organize this party is different, like fruit piled up like that, or meat skewered by bamboo and grilled. I've never seen one," Dionysius scratched his chin.
"Good morning," The masculine voice sounded very close, and Draco turned his head in astonishment. The sight before him made his heart flutter. Harry was there, in his bed, they were in the same blanket, and then he looked at Harry's blanket, which had almost slipped over his hips.
The sound of the door being pushed violently made Draco jolt in surprise. Hastily, the young man tucked the vulgar book Glenice had given him under his soft goose pillow.
"Cedric, I know that you love me, but I'm sorry, I can't accept your love. If we were just ordinary people, it might be easy for me to do it. But alas, we are nobles who are bound in one family. I don't want to insult the history of the Shinia Kingdom just to accept that hazy feeling," Draco said as the blonde managed to control his emotions.
Uncertainly, Doctor Jason sat on the edge of the bed. "Did you have a fight with your boyfriend, Mr. Potter? I understand, considering his famous stubbornness and dominance, it must be tough being his lover…"
Draco felt uncomfortable hearing that. All his life, he used to be independent. Relying on an established man while he only needed to be by his side while remaining graceful and beautiful never sounded comfortable to his eyes. Because of that, maybe he never dated for long because those who approached him were men with more successful and established careers than him.
As Draco had already guessed, his husband, who was currently walking beside him, still looked indifferent to Draco's answer. The man was still looking straight ahead expressionlessly. He didn't know what Harry was presently paying attention to.
Did the producers put something in his drink? Maybe some kind of drug or psychiatric drug that creates delusions and messes up his speech? That's what Draco thought.
"It's not about that! You go into too much detail about your God's bed activities. It's uncomfortable for me," Draco shook his head.
Because I saw you changing clothes like an erotic silhouette from below!! Because the sight is so aroused that it hurts!! Harry stands with burning eyes, ready to spit out his feelings, but then realizes that he will only look ridiculous if he spills out what's on his mind.
He took a deep breath. He didn't know how to answer Arabelle's question, but he was very grateful that Harry suddenly came up to them and asked Arabelle to ride the same horse with him. The queen was thankful that Harry had interrupted the conversation between himself and Arabelle for the first time.
Unintentionally, Arabelle's dark eyes collided with Cedric's. The prince stared at her with a gaze that could be called a look of disgust and anger. Suddenly, it made Arabelle clench her hand in Harry's arm.
Till one day, Harry came back. He said he was sorry. He regretted everything and wanted to start over. Harry wanted to be a better man and make Draco happy.
Harry shifted his gaze from the dark brown horse in front of him to the figure of the blonde who had just said his name.
He still remembered the plot of one of the vulgar novels that Glenice had just given him this morning. The book tells that if the main character was made a bet, the story continues until the main character was locked up in a palace and has to satisfy many mashers.
Draco nodded his head faintly in response. It didn't take long for Draco to reach for Cedric's beautiful and elegant sword that had been handed to him. The young man walked so decisively from the changing room of the guards that were still in the same location as the training grounds.
"Isn't it all right then? I'm not going to touch you any more than this. But I'm not going back to my room tonight. They'll think you're rejecting me. At least act if we sleep together tomorrow."
He smiled in amusement when he saw that his mistress seemed to be hiding her face and body behind the curtains. But apparently, she forgot that the curtains didn't touch the ballroom floor, so her feet could still be seen.
Suddenly a voice interrupted. Draco and Harry spontaneously broke their kiss and stared at the person who had caught them. Or rather, the ghost who managed to catch them.
"Pray to the wise Athena, my son. Ask Athena to protect you from the cruelty of Ares. You are the most loyal servant of Athena's temple, and I am sure the Goddess will not neglect you." The Queen of Sparta said so while sobbing.
"Since I was little, the door didn't want to be opened." The man who had a large body chuckled as if there was something funny.
The streets were quite busy that morning, and as usual, Draco saw the immortals roaming the streets. Even vampires roam around during the day. Do they use anti-sun cream? It felt bizarre seeing them roaming around in the daytime, even though he had seen this many times, and some fairies who used their wings to walk. Some of the fairies Draco passed were smiling. They knew Draco could see them.
Paying no heed to anything, he immediately took a step toward the riverbank. The young man knew he would turn into a corpse if he remained in the river. The blonde turned his body quickly, and how surprised he was when he saw the dress and underwear had been dragged into the water. Draco's eyes widened in surprise.
With his innocent beautiful body like porcelain, Draco stepped slowly to enter the clear river. Draco flinched slightly as the river water felt colder than before. The wind that blew also made him shiver even more.
Draco was very thirsty, and his greatest desire was to drink straight from the glass in one gulp. Draco took a sip of it greedily when he received the glass but stopped at the first gulp due to the choking and sore throat.
Arabelle giggled lightly as she received a steady stream of passionate kisses from Harry's lips on top of her head. The lovebirds were busy laughing until the girl in the man's arms caught the very familiar figure of a servant.
"N-Nothing," Draco replied nervously, trying to swallow the lump that seemed to have caught it in his throat.
"Ares gets bored quickly. The lovers also mostly force Ares to continue to focus on them. They want to be his eternal partner. When that happens, Ares will separate from them. He never wanted a serious relationship in the long term. Besides—" Lasonas' words stopped abruptly.
Draco frowned at Harry, trying to challenge the man's eyes that were still staring at him so sharply without expression.
Arabelle seemed so docile to Draco, at the mere mention of her name, the girl pulled her face away from Harry's broad chest. Of course, it made Harry frown, he had been calling the name of his mistress, but his mistress didn't want to answer.
"He's named Cyllenius. The man isn't old enough to be an Oracle. Why are you interested in the Oracle?" The female Oracle asked further.
Draco's heart skipped a beat, afraid of Harry's threat. Will Harry carry out his threat? But seeing those eyes lit with anger, Draco suddenly realized that Harry was not playing games. This man has a demon inside of him, and when it comes out, Harry won't hesitate to be cruel.
Ask his wife for permission. Draco closed his eyes sorely. After the grudge disappeared, all that was left in his chest was a painful emptiness, a suffocating emptiness in his chest, almost like a... broken heart.
“Such a good boy, so sensitive and pliant for me,” Harry cooed, causing goosebumps to erupt on Draco’s heated skin.
Ron was silent for a moment and frowned. He thought hard a second time. Harry watched his Beta closely.
"But why a human?! You can marry a Titan girl, haven't you been introduced to the Titan girl? The daughter of Kairos?"
"Ares, you are indeed my best lover." Aphrodite threw her beautiful body against Ares' sturdy chest. The Goddess fiddled with her slender fingers around Ares's neck and acted seductively.
"Bullshit!" Harry's jaw tightened, “You have to report it to me! I am your master, not Draco! Hurry up and go back to work!" He commands.
Draco turned his head to find Icarus standing beside the chair he was sitting on. The sword behind his back was still there as if Icarus couldn't separate from it.
Draco imagined walking out like this, with his belly full of cum. He imagined Harry's maids and bodyguards staring at him, thinking he was pregnant when he was just full of cum. Harry showing him off, Harry showing people how good of a lover he was.
"Go away," Harry ordered with a murderous look at Ginny, then threw her hands down violently so that the woman's body was pushed away. Ginny grimaced, enduring the pain, and then she quickly walked away. "So," Harry focused his cold eyes back on Draco. "Tell me what your price is, and I'll pay."
Draco whines as Harry's lips close around his left nipple, sucking it hard and teasing it with his teeth.
And they left instantly with smiles and laughter that still haven't faded. As Harry had requested, they would spend time alone in the Room of Requirement undisturbed. Disappear for a moment while preparing for an impromptu interrogation by a whole Hogwarts later.
After the King of Delion and Natalie left, Draco sighed harshly. The blonde lifted his face, and spontaneously, he squinted his eyes as the intense sunlight greeted him.
"Shut your mouth, Cedric! She's not a whore! She's my woman! I'm free to visit her!" Harry shouted, which made Draco flinch in surprise.
Draco could not rest well at all. He woke up an hour after that. Not knowing what to do in his room, Draco decided to take a walk to the garden for some fresh air even though his head was still a little dizzy. To be honest, Draco rarely got sick since he was a child. Even if he was sick, all he had was a cold and fever.
Draco tried to pull down his short, black skirt, which was starting to feel uncomfortable. This waitress's uniform was extremely painful; with his cleavage so low and the dress so short, it was as if Draco was forced to disguise himself as someone he didn't know. But wasn't that the point? He didn't want that man to know him, even though that seemed nothing to be afraid of.
The man then looked at Draco in confusion because Draco looked a little scared. "What's wrong?" he asked.
Draco looked around again. Yes, what else can he do? This mansion is the only treasure left. His father died of a heart attack. He left behind a debt that turned out to be too much for Draco to bear alone, while his mother was gone since he was a baby. Houses, cars, villas have all been taken away, including Draco's favorite motorbike, which he bought with his salary as a hotel employee in his former city.
"Don't you have a lunch appointment with your parents, Rouvas?" Harry smiled stiffly while Draco was still struggling to escape his grip. "I'm afraid you will be late, and of course, you definitely don't want that to happen."
The familiar voice made Draco immediately tilt his head up. His eyes collided with the emerald eyes of the man who was currently riding the horse valiantly.
"Yes, I've thought about it. I may have sent too many wedding gifts to the king of Sparta, so I can't waste my new wife," He shrugged. "Other than that?" Ares asked again.
Now, he has confirmed that he will stay in Ares' palace for a long time. Should he go down to the kitchen and cook by himself? Because he felt that his stomach would not be able to digest bland food like this every day.
She read the lips of the Empress, whom she admired so much, slowly. It took five repetitions from Draco until the girl managed to find the words that had repeatedly come out of the mouth of the Empress, who she considered her own brother.
Draco took a shaky breath as he moved to collect the embroidery threads that lay on the ivory-white stone table.
Ron crossed his arms over his chest. "That's because you turned down all the candidates I tried to suggest to you, and if you keep refusing, you won't get a partner to go with."
seeing what his cock does to the boy. He loves the fact that it makes him so pliant, submissive, and absolutely sweet for more.
Both of them were surprised to find Peeves already above them, hovering here and there. Draco's face turned tomato red from embarrassment, and Harry turned red from the annoyance of being disturbed.
"I'll take a look." Harry stepped into the white room and found Draco lying weakly on the bed. That kid was really stubborn. "Why don't you eat your food?" Harry hissed in anger. "Do you want to kill yourself?"
Draco stepped past the hallway again. There was no other way in the hall, leading straight to the large spiral staircase and the front door. Careful, he peeked from the bottom of the stairs to the first floor. Empty. Where were the guards Draco saw yesterday?
"At night, you can see the sky. There is one star among the star clusters that we can always recognize and yearn,"
It is possible that Tom will end up hiring one of them to kill him. Although well equipped with self-defense and proficient in a wide variety of weapons and surrounded by a troop of competent bodyguards, Harry must always be alert.
A single tear rolled back down the corner of Draco's eye. That man was right. Draco could never forget what happened tonight, every second of them. Draco was trapped with the most powerful devil in the deepest part of
"Let her go," Harry's cold voice sounded in the silence. The people were still waiting, concentrating on what the notorious man would do to the woman who dared to slap him.
Waking up breathless, Draco rubbed his sweaty forehead. He realized that what had just happened was a dream. Draco reached for the glass on the nightstand. He drank the water until the last sip.
He quickly grabbed the glass, drank it immediately because he was so thirsty. The cold flow of water felt so fresh while wetting his throat. Unconsciously the glass of the drink was already in the toilet. Draco placed the glass slowly in the sink, feeling a little guilty. But anyway, he did not regret it. He feels better. Now he can think of a way to escape from this house.
"No, no. I mean, acts of harassment don't just apply in the event of touch but also from words that are vulgar and make the other party uncomfortable," Draco explained.
"Are you mad because I don't love you?" Harry asked carefully as he looked into Draco's silver eyes.
"I don't want to wear it," Draco managed to raise his voice, so it was loud. "I'm not the toy that you can command as you please!!"
"And let you off the carriage with your wife and an unknown woman by your side? You want to destroy the reputation of this kingdom?!" Cedric did not accept that easily.
Harry actually wanted to protest, but he himself realized that he did look like an idiot. "Just give me an answer. Do you want it or not?"
"Huh? Where's that rule come from? It turns out that Sparta has a strange habit of eating at the dining table," Ares protested.
This new plot will make those who read it angry and annoyed because I also feel the same LMAO. Harry really is an asshole and a fool in this fic. Poor Draco.
The car is still driving fast from a distance. Draco then roared. "Hey, are you crazy?!" he shouted from across the street.
Cedric chuckled a little as he saw Draco's face that looked so adorable in his eyes. With a swift motion, his hand reached out to lightly pinch Draco's chin.
Quickly the bartender concocted Harry's favorite drink, the usual glass. Draco's hands trembled as he accepted the tray of drinks.
"I should have sentenced you all to death, wasn't my message clear? Protect the prince of Sparta with your life. Luckily, my mood was good today so let the prince of Sparta punish you," Ares said coldly.
"Too bad... I shouldn't have gone to war at that time, and if I didn't, I might have called off your wedding and taken Harry's place. If that happened, maybe by now, we'd have cute, beautiful children. And handsome." said Cedric with a smile as a vision of the beautiful future between him and Draco flashed through his head.
Draco knew that the bird didn't hunt like an eagle. Even more suspicious—they shouldn't want to get that close to a living human. Vultures were not commonly domesticated birds. They can't be trained to send mail like a carrier pigeon or look beautiful in a cage.
The man was dangerous and can do anything. Draco didn't want anyone to take his freedom away. While being taken to Mount Olympus and being left alone there sounded scary, at least Draco had a chance to escape. He could secretly pay people to put horses at the foot of the mountain or hire someone to escort him from Olympus to Athens.
Draco was standing like a statue. Even as Harry bring their hands together, he allowed Potter to continue speaking. Draco had never expected that hand to feel so warm and soft.
"Don't you think so? I've often caught Potter staring at you silently, Pans. He's also been looking for trouble with you a lot, which is really just for attention." Draco explained, which Pansy and Blaise didn't understand at all.
Draco threw the leech. Its stomach looked like it was about to burst onto the ground, and mercilessly, Draco stepped on the leech until it oozed the blood it had been enjoying from the poor white horse's body.
What Draco was experiencing right now was no different from one of the scenes he'd read in the erotic novel that Glenice had given him. His instincts pushed him to close his eyes. Until the shadow comes The image of Draco and Harry's wedding, the image of the two of them swearing their loyalty to each other in front of the sacred altar.
"It's your own fault, why did you catch up with me at the crosswalk earlier?" he asked in such a harsh tone.
"All right, I'll get a new papyrus. Please behave while I'm gone," the servant changed the direction of the conversation and left him.
No, Arabelle wouldn't do that. She didn't want to destroy the people she currently cares about because of herself.
Angry, Draco tilted his chin up at Harry. "I'd rather die than sell myself to you," He muttered harshly. The sound throughout the club was immediately filled with anxious buzzing awaiting Harry's reaction.
"Then what after that? Hector will control me. I will be considered a traitor by the kingdom and cannot return to Sparta. That is as bad as being an offering to a god." Draco shook his head. He looked outside the temple. Hector was still on guard and watching him from afar.
Harry, who was at war with his worries for Draco, turned his head quickly. "Alive?" he asked, narrowing his eyes.
With doubt, Draco opened his eyes, and he gasped at the sight before him. Harry was holding the knife, bare-handed. The sharp part of the knife sliced open the palm of his hand, but the man gripped the knife expressionlessly, even though blood began to pour out of his hand, hitting Draco.
"I didn't do anything, Lady. My husband is already happy, so I don't have to put in extra effort to make him happy." Draco replied as he gave Natalie a sweet smile.
After struggling to walk back to his room, Draco chose to clean himself over and over again because no matter how many times he showered, Draco still felt his body dirty. Very dirty. Draco could never forgive Harry, nor could he forgive himself. However, Draco felt ashamed of himself, considering that he had drifted into Harry's desire. What happened all night, Draco could not erase from his memory.
Instantly filled with dizziness because of his head's sudden position, Draco realized that he had been lifted out of the club. With all his might, Draco tried to fight. His hands pounded the bodyguard's back, and his legs kicked violently while screaming in anger and frustration, but the bodyguard's body was rock solid, unresponsive to Draco's struggling.
But Harry wasn't there when Draco was in pain and crying. He wasn't there when Draco was struggling to maintain their relationship with all his might.
Ares then grasped his hair and played with it. Draco flinched because even if it was just a brief, harmless physical contact, it could actually make his heart pound. He doesn't know if he can build resistance against the War God's existence.
"Prince Cedric, don't you know that this act of yours is impolite?!" Draco shook his head in disbelief.
Flashes of memory flickered through his mind. He was still locked up here in the room at Harry's house. Draco sat up from the bed in a panic, and the blanket almost fell over his chest. Draco lowered his head and realized that he was completely naked under the blanket. What the...
"As I said, Mr. Potter, Draco's condition is still unstable, sometimes he looks fine, but sometimes the slightest shaking can make him hurt. I recommend that you do not take him home yet, or his recovery will be hampered."
"I got a few people who wanted to get bitten," said a seventeen years old girl. Physically she looked seventeen, but literally, she must be over eighty years old.
A second later, Harry brought Draco through a whirlwind of waves getting up and down until orgasmic shocks ravaged them both. Bring them together at one point of pleasure. Harry lifted himself from the panting Draco; his mind was still foggy from orgasm. His fingers gently untied Draco's hands. The ties leave a reddish mark on the blonde's delicate wrist.
Draco's eyes widened when he heard the string of words spoken by his husband just before he stepped closer to the heating stove not far from his current position.
Doctor Jason's footsteps stopped abruptly. He turned his head and looked at Draco questioningly. "What's wrong, Draco? Can I help you? Are you in pain?"
"I don't feel justice from you, Zeus. Are you going to continue to defend him without actually educating him? Do you realize what the Titans and the citizens of Olympus think about your attitude towards Ares?"
"Because Olympus is not a place for humans. The monsters here will immediately approach when they smell a human like you," said Alastair seriously, to which Draco nodded.
"Now go," ordered Harry in an unfriendly tone. The four bodyguards bowed as a sign of respect before they left the place.
The atmosphere in the ballroom that night was very lively. The music from the famous orchestra that gathered at the side of the ballroom added to the romantic atmosphere in the magnificent ballroom.
"From now on, you have to rethink if you want to challenge me. I'm not a good person, and I don't hesitate to be cruel,” Harry's lips felt close to Draco's, and he was a little out of breath.
Harry was not a man who mingled so easily, he was a loner, and his famous disposition made people hesitant to approach him. Ron wasn't close to Harry. They were only talking about business. And when it comes to business, Harry is quite cooperative. Their partnership has resulted in many benefits for their respective companies.
They returned to their feet around the garden, and during the tour, only Draco and Natalie spoke. The King of the Delion occasionally chimed in, while Harry ignored their conversation and always had a frown on his face.
A waiter came, and Harry ordered again in fluent French. When the appetizer arrived, Draco was blown away by the presentation. Harry explained that it was
The General was obsessed with him. He wanted Troya and the king to realize it. He also tried to get rid of Hector, but because of his achievements in the military—the endeavor was not easy. Troya often caught Hector watching him, and he often gave him expensive gifts.
Harry was still staring angrily at the two bodyguards, wondering what punishment was cruel enough to bestow for their stupidity. Draco ran away, and not just run, for God's sake! The young man was now in Hyde's palms.
Draco swallowed harshly, an oppressive aura emanating clearly from the gaze of the man before him. "I do not understand what you mean," He said without the slightest trepidation.
If Draco were honest with himself, he'd have to admit that he'd needed something like this for a long time. Yes, he'd be paying for all of the abuse tomorrow, the teeth marks would sting, and the bruises would be sore, and he'd probably need to use a few anti-inflammatory patches. But none of that mattered. At the moment, Draco didn't have the energy to care.
"God damn it!" Draco gushed angrily, then driven by his offense at Harry's insult, Draco stepped forward and tried to throw a punch in Harry's face. But Harry was quite flexible. Harry grabbed Draco's arm and speedily moved Draco's arm behind his back.
Draco was still sitting on his knees, biting his lip, looking down, and wringing his dress. He looked like he wanted to cry. Ares hated how he felt right now. He wanted to come over and hug him and comfort him. It was so easy for him to do that to his other lovers. Pretending to care was his forte. But this time, he hesitated.
Alden nodded, asking for an acknowledgment. “Hopefully, you can get rid of all the unnecessary grudges. For sure, I can guarantee that master Harry really cares about you. You need to know that master Harry is really serious about marrying you. He is currently in Italy, visiting Mrs. Seraphina's grave."
Harry's eyes darkened as if a storm was about to hit. "Why don't you wear your dress?" Harry hissed softly.
Instead of glaring at Harry's mistress with eyes full of anger, Draco laughed lightly. How cute was Harry's mistress. Anyone would fall in love easily when dealing with such a cute girl.
Daphne's last words before leaving brought Draco away from his frustration. Harry had treated him just like his lovers, who could be commanded at will like a doll!
Draco's eyes could only stare in fear. In front of him, this man had completely changed, from a friendly and kind man to a terrifying monster. Draco's body was tied to a chair, and Draco was completely immobile, under the power of a mad psychopath who was now pacing back and forth with the knife in his hand.
Harry didn't say anything, even put on an expressionless face. If there is a face competition with no expression for the longest, that guy will definitely win. Harry often showed his dull face almost every time Draco talked to him. Like an expressionless human, but he wasn't human.
Draco didn't answer the man's teasing. He kept his eyes fixed on his bedroom window instead of staring at the handsome creature currently in front of him.
Even though the man looked at him gloomily, Draco could still find a hint of anger in his eyes. Draco knew the slap he had just given must have hurt Cedric's heart. As a high-class nobleman, a slap was naturally classified as an insult.
"I don't want to change partners. I don't want to dance with those crazy women," lied Harry nonchalantly.
"It's not that sad, Prince Cedric. I just felt touched by their love journey, which was full of twists and turns, but they were able to endure to the end," Draco replied with certainty.
"Yes, Your Majesty," Draco said obediently as he tried to keep pace with Harry, who was walking very fast like he was chasing something important.
Lucius' heart seemed to be filled with joy when he saw the worried and panicked look on his son's beautiful face. "And when that happens, everyone will make fun of you. Over time... you will be pushed aside and forgotten," He said with a satisfied smile.
Harry wasn't following him, but Draco was sure that soon Harry would follow him. And sure enough, Harry was suddenly behind Draco.
Hyde is a genius assassin with a psychopathic mentality, which is very cruel and maniac. He kills his victims with very thoughtful calculations and can sometimes be very cruel. Up until now, no one knew the real figure of the killer. They all called him Hyde because he always managed to kill his victims…until now.
The man managed to grab Draco's hand again and pulled him. "You can't get close to Potter. He's a dangerous creature." The man's wings moved up and down, making Draco's eyes follow the beat.
"I'm not ready," He responded again. Draco would probably do badly. Ares probably won't like his body and realizes that he may not be as beautiful as people say. They might just not fit in the bed, and Ares ended up ignoring him.
The man picked up and carried Draco to the door again. But Draco struggled and kicked, forcing the man to put him down. Draco fell into the grass. The man looks angry, and he looks like he is going to hit him. Draco covered his face from the blow, and while Draco waited for the man's hand to touch his skin, none of that happened.
Natalie's heart skipped a beat when she saw her stepson's arrival. She was afraid that her stepson would say something strange and spoil the fun of this party.
Since then, he's been investigating everything related to Harry Potter, where he lives, what his schedule was, what he likes, or anything. All this information he carefully collected and compiled. When Draco got the information that Harry often spends time with his toys in this upscale club, the Amorist Club. Without thinking long, Draco left his job as a high school teacher, moved from his residence, and applied as a waitress here.
"I don't think so. Angels were created to obey God's commands, and demons are the opposite…" replied a girl who sat five rows in front of Draco.
"Why do you look like you want to cry? You don't want to wear this dress, do you?” muttered Harry, staring at Draco sharply. "Then, I grant your wish." Harry grabbed Draco, gripped the blonde's back until he was closer to him with a sudden movement.
Everyone who passed them ignored him. They thought it was an attempt to secure their prince. But Draco immediately knew. As soon as he saw a chariot without a window in front of him—it didn't belong to the king of Sparta. Hector planned this.
His eyes were wide and fragile with a golden brown finish, and Daphne had so much accentuated his high cheekbones' structure that they looked attractive and aristocratic. And his lips are polished with a peach lip gloss in a nuance that makes his lips always look wet.
"How is he, doctor?" Harry looked away and stared at Doctor Jason, who was still standing beside Draco, checking Draco's IV.
Alden arrived, handing over another stack of files, distracting Harry. “Looks like your guess is right, master. Doctor Jason's profile is very similar to Hyde's profile. He was a graduate genius from medicine, his life was very mysterious, and according to rumors, his mother died by suicide. He just entered the hospital two months ago, and when we checked his past, everything was blank. There was not a single data about him, as if everything was deleted."
"I didn't think Your Majesty would come. I think Your Majesty's neck still hurts," said Arabelle, which Draco replied with a smile.
He had thought about it several times. Living as Troya as he was right now would be equally as displeasing to him. Indeed he was the King's son. Troya received the best services and facilities as the beloved son of the King of Sparta. But living everyday life as a
The dress is made of gleaming green silk with tiny crystals spreading across the dress's length, giving it a stunning sparkling effect. The legs of the dress spread out to the side and hung down beautifully.
"I heard the Titans are monstrous giants and spout fire like Kronos who Zeus killed, but you all seem normal," Draco doubted.
Cedric kept his lips closed. He noticed Draco's sad face, which the blonde rarely showed to anyone, even his father. He never seemed to show it.
"I just wanted to kiss you," Ares admitted, mumbling softly. "I'm your husband, and I think I have the right to touch you," He said again, a little more firmly.
Harry seemed to know he was being watched with awe by the crowd of women, but he didn't look at them at all. His eyes were fixed on Draco, and a lopsided smile appeared on his lips. "You're so gorgeous, babe," Harry grabbed Draco, hugged Draco's waist gently, then kissed Draco's nose tenderly. "Of all the women in this room, you're the most beautiful. Everyone else is just trash." Harry said the words aloud, which the horde of women heard directly.
He looked at Ron's retreating back and finally smiled. How lucky Hermione was to have such an amazing partner like Ron.
Instead of leaving, though, the taller man pushed back the shower curtain, revealing his own nude body. Draco’s eyes were drawn to the massive erection that the man was sprouting. He felt his own dick twitch in interest.
Draco continued to move his body gracefully according to the music played by the orchestra. The song changes, the sign will begin the exchange of partners.
Half-heartedly, Draco finally reached for the clothes. "Yes, Your Majesty," Draco said with a heavy heart.
Harry was feeling gloomy tonight. For some reason, he was in the mood to beat up someone or kill someone if necessary. Tonight he came to the club, not for fun but to find trouble. Surrounded by bodyguards who were always ready to take care of him, even though it was not necessary because Harry had mastered several martial arts skills. But when you have a lot of money, it's better to let someone else do everything for you.
If Harry told him to dress up, Draco would definitely be allowed to go down to Harry's party. That meant there was an opening for him to escape from this house.
"Do you have any business with me?" Draco asked and immediately felt stupid about it. It was a vulture, not a chimpanzee.
"Ah, it's not what you think, Your Majesty," Cedric chuckled when he saw Draco's frightened and confused face.
"I heard the people of Olympus rarely eat chicken. I was just experimenting," Draco responded politely. He then explained the cooking process.
Feeling uncomfortable and worried about wobbling, Draco shifted his sleeping position. He piled pillows and rugs under his bed and slept there like a house cat.
Harry just mumbled incoherently, his eyes still glaring at the gentlemen who were still blatantly staring at Draco with a gaze full of desire.
The girl looked very annoyed but did not immediately reply. She had never been slapped back like that before. She was unprepared. Draco was pleased to see the lost expression of his nosy sister. He continued on his way. This time he had a goal. He no longer wanted to wander around the palace, wasting time. In less than a week, he would be sacrificed to the god Ares. Draco felt the need to understand his current situation better.
Actually, Ares thought of something else. The Spartan prince had obviously succumbed to his touch and immediately gave up, but he held himself back not because of trivial emotional things or anything. He was hiding something from Ares. Something that might put his life in danger if Ares found out.
Draco's cheeks crimsoned like a tomato. He cleared his throat, attempting to look convincing. "No, they're not gonna find it because there's nothing happened."
Draco gasped, his mouth wide open. "Four days?!" he asked in surprise. "H-How?!" he squawked, then looking at his changed clothes. "What did you do to me?!"
“I want to plug you, I want you to look like this till morning,” Harry said as he fucked Draco again, he growled, “I want to take you out like this, showing the people in my house what I am doing to you.”
Draco finally said, "I already know the whole truth, Potter. I'm guilty of trying to harm you. But that doesn't matter anymore. You are indeed guilty of my parents' deaths, and I have every right to hate and hold grudges against you. But you also saved my life, so I assume we're even. If you let me go, I promise I won't appear in your life again and will never try to harm you again," Draco looked at Harry earnestly. "That's the best offer I can make."
"Thank you, Lady, you look beautiful today. His Majesty must admire your beauty." Draco said, which managed to make the concubine's cheeks previously painted with fiery red, blush even redder because of Draco's words.
"Would—" Harry's gasping breath was a little erotic against Draco's lips, and Harry kissed him again. "Would I hurt you if I..."
Harry just smiled disparagingly at Draco's movements. “You know you can't refuse if I want to force you. Did you not learn from our sex experience yesterday?" the man calmly threw his loosened tie on the floor, then unbuttoned his shirt, one by one.
"I am an Emperor, and this is my palace. I am free to do anything here," said Harry nonchalantly. He stepped into the palace through a quiet path to the existence of the nobles.
I want you to feel every inch of Daddy's cock inside your pussy." He growled, body shuddering as Draco tightens up on the tip of his cock before sliding back down to the base in incredibly patient increments.
"You speak as if my kingdom is filled with commoners." cut Harry sharply as he stared blankly at the older King.
The answer was crystal clear, and Harry managed to make Draco fell silent. Along the way, they did not say another word.
"Ah, Draco asked me to feed him because his body is still weak..." replied the doctor nervously. He quickly put Draco's bowl on the table, then got up from his chair. "Since Mr. Potter is here, I'll excuse myself. There are things I still have to do." with that, Doctor Jason excused himself.
There was a certain satisfaction for him when he conquered the humans who interested him. He's also not a complete jerk either because while he often seduces different humans—he makes sure he doesn't hook up with more than one human simultaneously.
Arabelle was a beautiful girl, but unfortunately, Arabelle's beauty does not match the standard type of beauty in the western kingdom. Arabelle had black eyes and straight hair that were also dark, not the standard western type of beauty. But somehow, Harry really liked Arabelle's face. Maybe it was because Harry could not obtain Arabelle's beauty in others in this kingdom.
Ron sighed. "Since you don't seem to like coming alone—and yes, I find it very sad if you leave without a partner, I suggest you take one of the Omegas to go with you? You know, be your temporary Mate."
Hello, new readers. Welcome to my fic. I'm just an amateur writer, and english is not my native language so there will be so many grammatical mistakes, hope you understand.
Most aliens are described as evil and want to rule the earth, but many are told to be friends and become heroes. Like Superman and Thor.
"Oh, I'm sorry. I'm used to dealing with lovers with a slightly different character than you. I must remember that you are shy," Alastair nodded.
There was a brief pause, then the deep voice over there calmly replied. “They have left the house. The plan will be carried out later when they return home."
It seemed like Draco's words had hit Harry to the core because the man's jaw tensing, angry. Harry roughly grabbed his black silk robe and wore it back. Then with a sudden movement, he climbed onto the bed and gripped Draco's jaw with one hand. The grip was so harsh and painful that Draco's blonde brows frowned. But Draco held himself back from complaining. He didn't want to give this devil any redemption.
During a brief, accidental encounter, they had met only once when the man had met his father in his study room. At that time, Draco's appearance was not what it is now. His hair was still short with thick-rimmed glasses framing his face, very different from now.
Draco's body shook violently as the wind hit him. It's cold. Draco would have chosen to run along with Cedric if he had known it would end like this. No, he would refuse Cedric's invitation to wander around in the wilderness like this.
He was scared, truly scared. Even though Harry had freed him, Draco still felt that he was still not completely free from the man because of this baby. The baby that belongs to Harry
Really, for some reason, Draco looked so adorable in Charles's eyes. Now, his jealousy of Harry grew even more. As if God was not content to give Harry a large and prosperous kingdom, God also gave someone as perfect as Draco to accompany Harry.
The girl’s grunt drew a laugh from Draco's that sounded like the melodies of leading musicians. He suddenly remembered something. The blonde's laughter stopped. Now, he stared intently at his maid.
Harry chuckled. "Hmm, considering you've come back sassy to me, I'm sure you're cured." Harry ran his fingers on Draco's cheek. "Forgive me,"
The young woman’s stepped quickly towards the royal garden. At this time, because the royal palace was crowded with guests, she was sure that her man was now in the garden behind the castle. The garden was definitely quiet because only the royal family can enter it.
Harry's eyes were still black, and his dark aura was so strong that it made Draco's hair bristles. Without thinking about anything, Draco kissed Harry right on the lips. He did this to let Harry know that there weren't any feelings even when Draco kissed him.
Cedric understood it was a difficult thing. So he would always be by the side of his loved one, assuring him that he wouldn't hurt Draco as Harry had done before.
Shyly, Draco looked away and was greeted with Harry's evil smile. Draco's courage and anger immediately emerged when he realized the pain in his buttocks. This man raped him! Draco doesn't know what happened last night. He didn't remember at all. But indeed, he was already tainted by this cruel scamp.
"Your Majesty, wasn't your previous act too rude? I was just astonished to see it from afar, even though that man is your brother-in-law..."
"Why are you moaning?!" growled Harry in frustration as his eyes seemed to have been shrouded in a haze of passion.
"Draco, you better put on this dress, or you'll really regret it." Harry started hissing angrily. His hand grabbed the green dress and threw it carelessly at Draco, who immediately caught it and carefully held the dress.
"What is your relationship with the God of War? I thought he would come for me himself." Draco, in his Troya form, asked innocently.
"Because," Harry growled slightly, and with a quick move, the man gripped Draco's jaw with his fingers, soft but threatening. “Because I love getting into you so much, you are different from the others, feel your hole envelop my cock in heat, then hear your moans until your orgasm. Clear?"
Arriving at the hospital, Harry rushed to the room where Draco was being treated, along with a bouquet of flowers that he was holding. And Harry walked through the hallway but then seen several men running from the corner of the hallway where Draco's room was.
Cedric rubbed his ear, which burning because of the disgusting sobs that came out of the mouth of his brother's mistress.
"Yes," he replied. "Look, you have to be careful with him. I saw a lot of demons approaching you when Potter was with you." Icarus talked to him, but his eyes looked elsewhere.
Draco saw how one by one, the guards left the battle area. Draco was hopeful when he saw Cedric stride so valiantly into the middle of the area while carrying his sword that sparkling.
Harry clenched his fists tightly that turquoise veins protruded so majestic over the backs of his hands.
The man let go of Draco's hand. "I'm Icarus Prometheus, son of Daedalus." He bowed slightly to introduce himself.
The young man had a new exciting activity. Draco was almost exasperated because he couldn't find anything interesting to do in Sparta's palace. He also made nicknames for those around him. Like his servants, whom he calls 'chatty pumpkin' or the King, which he calls 'crybaby dashing father', and his sister, whom he calls 'pug-faced dog' or 'bitchy mouth'.
Harry smiled, imagining Tom Riddle's face right now must be red with anger. "Tom was always angry with me from the start. But until now he won't be able to do anything for me. He knows he will die if he tries to kill me just once and then fails."
Natalie's smile widened when she heard Draco's words, "See! Let's go back! I want to rest!" Natalie said excitedly to her husband.
Harry thinned his lips and watched the old King's face turn paler. He gave the other man a piercing, intimidating stare he always gave. "Since you've prepared an amazing party for us, this time I forgive you," said Harry as he averted his gaze away.
The kiss was really disrespectful because Harry's lips without excuse immediately on his, crushing it without restraint. His tongue immediately popped in, feeling Draco's entire being, sucked it in, enjoyed it, and ground him mercilessly.
Draco realized Cedric was feeling very upset right now. Because of that, Draco started racking his brains to find a way to make the other man less annoyed. "Don't you want to take me away from here? I'm bored already," he said, looking at Cedric expectantly.
"If Your Royal Highness is planning a rebellion, then the blood that will spill on this land shouldn't be a problem for Your Royal Highness, but if Your Royal Highness doesn't want to let those blood pollute this land, then stop your plan."
"Draco," Harry's voice was low. "If you don't listen to me, I'm gonna fire Doctor Jason from here and make sure not a single hospital, clinic, or anything else will hire him to work." he threatens.
Draco glanced at Harry as he let out a hiss that sounded filled with anger. Draco sighed as the boy reached out his hand to check the condition of Arabelle's skin. He rolled his eyes silently. Apparently, Arabelle had scratched the skin of her feet roughly.
He had been sold like a slave to Harry on his 23rd birthday, which was a week away. It was like being insulted and hit at the same time. He wanted to scream that he wasn't an object. He was human and had free will.
Draco heard the uproar around him. As he slowly opened his eyes, he began to notice that he wasn't in his room. His nose also smelled a strong spice aroma that he had never encountered before. He tried to wake up from sleep, but his whole body felt stiff as if his arms and waist wouldn't obey him. Was this how paralyzed feels like? Panic began to overtake him, but no sound escaped his throat other than a hoarse groan.
Charles's heart raced as he felt a tinge of concern linger in every word that came out of the Empress' lips. Was this what it feels like to be worried by someone you really admire?
"You won't be able to run away," threatened Alden, shouting from inside. "Master Harry will definitely find you, and I swear, if you upset master Harry, you will regret it." Alden's shouts grew louder, accompanied by his banging on the door.
Draco saw his pregnant mother. She was in pain, trying to get out the baby she was carrying. And when the baby came out, the baby was crying and covered in blood. Narcissa smiled. A mark adorned the bottom of Draco's left thumb. But, the mark disappeared quickly. Draco couldn't see it very well.
Was that man drunk? Draco's heart started thumping. In a conscious state, Harry's emotions are very unpredictable, especially when he was drunk.
. I'm aware of my place in Your Majesty's heart. I have no right to be jealous because I know Your Majesty doesn't love me." Draco said with a genuine smile.
Draco's heart was pounding. His eyes widened at Cedric. His mind was suddenly confused. The blonde couldn't even think straight. He didn't realize that Cedric kept walking around his corner until Draco felt a stinging pain in his neck.
Is that true? Did Ares really exist? If so, will he be tortured? It looks like it won't be that bad. Draco was sure he never remembered the story that Ares was an abuser, but he couldn't believe too much in mythology. What's even more dangerous is that if this turns out to be all a scam and he will be taken to a strange place—where he may be held captive by the enemies of the King of Sparta.
It was common knowledge that their king was sadistic and never forgave anyone's mistakes. However, it seemed that the guest could breathe a sigh of relief, considering that there was a young man who was known for his generosity and kindness right now stood beside the king. He was the Empress of this kingdom.
"Like Goddess Hera who supports her husband no matter what, I want to be like that too. I can help you. You can use me for anything. I have proven to your guests that I am probably the best chef on Olympus. But I'm sure I can be good at other things too." Draco made his point.
"Do you like it?" said Cedric as he stopped his horse when they were finally exactly where Cedric wanted to show Draco.
Harry jerked his head and looked at the man of Greek descent who was sitting in front of him. They are discussing a partnership that their two companies have recently entered into. Greyson Rouvas, a man of British-Greek blood, is one of Harry's business partners. He is tall and has a pair of amber eyes that are often the dream of women. His very successful career made Harry interested in collaborating.
He took a deep breath before the blonde decided to get up from his seat and stomped his long legs out of the room. Maybe, a short walk can calm Draco's mind a bit so he can sleep soundly tonight.
The smile that had been adorning Draco's face was slowly fading away from his embarrassment. The queen's smooth forehead was filled with faint wrinkles as he found a bluish patch on Arabelle's neck, which happened to be exposed.
"So it's true, you do want to oppose your father! Could it be true what Athena said, you were seeking Zeus' attention?" The Goddess added, still nagging.
"Why do you keep staring at me? Do I look ugly for not wearing makeup?" Draco asked, pursing his lips in annoyance.
Draco's inexperienced movements caused Harry to grit his teeth to suffocate his mounting excitement. Finally, in one smooth motion, Harry pressed himself in, connecting his body with Draco.
Draco stared at the other man or at least tried hard to make his eyes focus. "I'm... what happened to me?"
Of course, His action took Harry a little by surprise. He gave Draco a strange look. Seeing that strange look, Draco immediately cursed himself. He could usually forget the etiquette of a noble. After this, Harry would definitely look him the side-eye.
Draco sighed in frustration. "You guys just misunderstood!" he said decisively. "Stop talking like I like him. How many times do I have to tell you I'm just kidding."
Draco had just realized something. He moved his hand to touch his slender neck. When he raised his hand, he could see that the deep red bloodstain had already covered his palm.
"God has the right to take my life, not a devil like you!!" Draco screamed, trying to defy him even though his heart was racing even faster with extreme fear.
"And if the persuasion of the smiling doctor does not easily fool you, you will not be kidnapped easily." Harry interrupted sharply.
"Luna," Draco said quietly. "Can you track where I am? I'm at someone's house, but I don't know where," he said again.
Harry looked at Draco with irritation. "You're weird too. Have you been bewitched to stand beside me all this time?" Harry replied.
Perhaps Harry did think of him as home, as a comfortable place to return to after wandering too far. But Draco had learned to love himself by not letting his nearly dry wound continue to be sprinkled with salt by Harry.
Draco closed his eyes for a moment, trying to make sense of all of this. Mr. Flitwick died from being killed by the demon Abaddon who looked like a human. What should Draco do? The police will definitely suspect him while he was calling an emergency call for help. And now, he is in another place. How did Draco explain all this mess to the police?
Draco walked down the street, paying close attention to traffic signs before crossing, which shows the red color for pedestrians. He then stopped while reaching into his pocket to pick up a cell phone to check if there's a message or call.
For some reason, Draco felt that resting at times like this was inappropriate. Had they continued their journey, they would have been able to reach the royal capital of Delion in just 3 hours. Draco was sure their group would be able to endure hunger for 3 hours.
"Don't you want to try to feel it? Falling in love is fun," said Cedric, smiling widely and showing rows of white teeth.
No human should roam the mountains of Olympus. Usually, Ares' followers and soldiers were fellow Titans as well as demigods, nymphs, centaurs, and satyrs. They said Draco was the only human to have set foot there in nearly two hundred years. From the very beginning, Draco traveled with the Ares followers. Draco felt they were friendly and kind people. At first, Draco thought the War God’s envoys were like barbarians or pirates who like to speak harshly.
"What bad premonition? He's just a young boy from Sparta. He's a human who might fail to adapt in my palace and will die young. I don't expect much from him." Ares shook his head.
"What's with your neck, Arabelle? Is your room full of bugs? Do I need to move your room?" Draco asked worriedly as he gently stroked the red spot with his index finger.
"Do ask," Draco tucked a few strands of his hair that were flying because of the small wind that entered the carriage.
I know it's too soon, but I just want to wish a happy new year to all of us, have an amazing holiday. Tbh, I hope I could update a new chapter in the new year, with new dramas between Draco and Harry. They still have a long journey *sigh dramatically*
"Where am I?" Draco surprised himself after asking that question. He heard a foreign sentence slip out of his lips. What he thinks with what he says was different.
"They must not be real messengers. They are scammers. A real god can't send his followers to the land of humans. Of the three Oracles that resided in the temples of Athena and Apollo, none claimed to have received
Ares didn't answer right away. He got up from his bed and immediately walked away while fixing his clothes. "You know, I don't think you like sleeping in the same bed as me. I won't do it again then." He said curtly as he walked out of the room.
Harry treats dresses — as expensive and beautiful as this — as a rag. This demon doesn't understand anything about beauty! Unconsciously Draco's hatred spilled over again for Harry. The urge to challenge Harry was immense even though the other side of him screamed not to challenge Harry any further.
"Glenice... they will speak one-on-one. If there are servants there, they no longer speak one-on-one but many-eyes." Draco joked as he laughed heartily.
Harry's emerald eyes gave off an aura of overwhelming possessiveness as if he wanted to tell anyone that Draco was his.
"If Prince Cedric forgets, let me remind you one more time. I am the wife of Harry James Potter, ruler of the Kingdom of Shinia. I am your brother-in-law and queen. Does Prince Cedric think it is appropriate for me to open my heart to you?" Draco asked in his proper sentence.
Draco embraced him, using his strength to draw Harry's body against his own as they kissed. He felt the heat of Harry's release as he spilled inside of him, the body in his arms jerking in aborted deep thrusts as his hips stuttered helplessly. Draco still had a significant erection, but he knew it would be painful if he came again. He was far too overstimulated to continue, so instead, he lay beneath Harry, breaking their kiss as the other collapsed atop him, breathing harshly.
“I'm t-tired... Please, Potter, s-stop.” Draco rebelled, even though his own arousal returned with surprising speed despite his tiredness.
"Hey, hey…" Doctor Jason approached the bed and touched Draco's arm. "What's wrong, Draco? Are you all right?"
According to Draco, given Ares's extraordinarily cunning and unfeeling character in Greek poetry, what Ares does now doesn't live up to his reputation. Considering Ares's incredibly cunning and heartless character in Greek poetry, Ares could have kidnapped him and treated him as he pleased then after being bored, Ares could dump him.
"Athena, we both know that Ares isn't that weak. He might be able to pass any test. This will just be a waste of time. Besides, I sense a personal motive from you. This isn't the first time you've tried to punish him," Zeus responded to Athena's suggestion. The Goddess of Wisdom turned gloomy at once.
"You are the wife of the king, especially now that we are going to travel to the other side of the kingdom. What do you think they will think when they see you in the same carriage with another man?" Harry asked sharply.
Hearing that familiar deep voice, Draco quickly wiped the tears that were still on his cheeks using the back of his hand. He took a moment to take a deep breath before he lifted his face and smiled at the other man.
Athena smiled, felt like he had the opportunity she had wanted for thousands of years. "Revoke the god of war title from his name." The Goddess said calmly.
Pansy and Blaise were busy watching Draco. And this made Draco far from comfortable. Draco finally gave in and stopped ignoring his two best friends. "Okay, what?" he asked, turning to Pansy.
"Your Majesty, are you going to ride a horse? Why do you have to ride a horse when the kingdom has already prepared a carriage for you?" Glenice asked as she twirled Draco's blond mane together.
Of course, at all times, Draco would never be able to comply with the ridiculous request ever made to an Omega like him. The Alpha thought with Draco's position being at the bottom of the caste. He would want to be made a pet who would follow the man's will constantly?
That man was Harry. He stood proudly with his hands folded in front of his broad chest. The gentle breeze that night blew gently on the man's robe adorned with wolf fur. That man's stare was so stabbing.
Ares liked his current expression. The prince looks sincere and nervous with him. His gaze became a little different. It was something Ares wanted. He hated it when his wife smiled so quickly at other people. But right now, he saw different gestures and expressions. The thing Draco only showed when he's with Ares.
The man raped Draco again when he was unconscious. Draco frowned, trying to endure the humiliation that grasped his chest. But, is it really rape? Last night Draco was very, very willing to make love to Harry. In fact, he's having an orgasm! Yes, even his body remembers the immense pleasure he had last night.
The transmitter indicated that he was still alive but did not know what his condition was. He could be dying or broken a few bones. He could have brought home a weakened boy who was no longer beautiful to look at. Though, Ares was not a heartless man. No matter how bad his condition was later, Ares will make sure he gets good care.
This new plot will make those who read it angry and annoyed because I also feel the same LMAO. Harry really is an asshole and a fool in this fic. Poor Draco.
Draco couldn't help but glanced at the green dress on the floor and let out a bitter sigh even though he didn't want to wear a dress, but it couldn't be denied that it was so beautiful. However, behind his disappointment was satisfaction that at least he could show Harry that he could challenge him.
Harry had been sitting over there and staring at Draco since a few minutes ago. The man did not bother him; he did not even move from his seat. But that intense, passionate look in his eyes was alarming. It made all Draco's nerves convulse into a tingling heat that made the air-conditioned room suddenly feel hot.
Harry watched Draco from head to toe with a look of contempt, then a smile appeared again at the corner of his lips, “C'mon. Welcome to my house,” The man half forcing grab Draco's stiff arm and then led him into his house.
Draco looked back at the passenger and saw Harry sitting as if waiting for him to get into the car. "Ah yes," Draco muttered, and since he didn't have time to find another taxi, he forced his way into the car.
"Are you trying to win Zeus' heart and trying to get him to like you? You know they always urge you to marry and leave Aphrodite," Athena guessed.
Draco ends up eating his food again, and suddenly he chokes. It was as if someone was choking him, and he couldn't breathe. Draco saw a glimpse of Icarus choking him, but the man wasn't there. Draco hit Icarus from the right and hit his handsome face.
The girl with red hair glanced at her friends. "The man you were with, was he your friend?" the girl asked.
The royal concubine sitting and waiting for Draco rose when she saw Draco walking towards her. A smile graced the concubine's lips.
The echoing scream that came from Cedric, as well as the sound of the sword falling violently against the rough cement floor where the battle area was, made everyone stare in shock at their queen still motionless in his place.
As they danced, Draco's eyes caught a glimpse of a young woman in a plain dress who was looking at Draco and Harry with expectant eyes. The girl hid as best she could in the corner of the ballroom, but her strikingly different dress made Draco recognize her.
Draco shouted, spontaneously grabbing Harry's swinging arm, preventing Harry from finishing off Alden. "Stop! Stop! I was wrong. I was wrong! Please don't kill him! It is my fault!" he shouted frantically, silver eyes already glassy with tears.
"Yes, if we repel the pest, we can indeed keep it from disturbing our property for a while. But does Lady know? There is a possibility that the pest will be stronger and can predict what we will do. That sounds very dangerous. So, rather than let it get stronger, we'd better let it keep having fun with its current position." Draco explained with a gentle smile on his face.
"Zeus is thinking of stepping down from his position and choosing one of his children to replace him for leading the Titans," Hera said again a little quietly. It was indeed not information that could be easily shared with anyone. Hera shouldn't even talk about it.
Draco widened his eyes, almost choking on his spit and half laughing. "You think loving someone is easy?" he asked. "Love is a process, and in the process, you will know whether you love them or it's just a pity."
Draco grimaced when he realized that at every access to the exit, all of them stood two or three of Harry's bodyguards in the same black suits and who always seemed on guard. Draco had to get past them if he wanted to get out of this place.
Pulling one corner of his lips to the side, Ron tilted his head. "Yeah, not really. It wasn't really a formal event you had to attend. I just thought it would be a shame if you missed it. You know, the euphoria."
"From who? From me? Are you afraid I'll touch you? Oh my... My Draco is not innocent anymore," said Cedric, ending with a satisfied laugh from the prince’s lips.
"Stop it," Harry warned in a low voice, making Draco whimper again. He grabbed the front of the man's shirt even harder, trying to get him to give Draco a little mercy.
The frown that adorned Harry's forehead immediately disappeared when he heard Draco's words. "Yeah, I should be with Arabelle right now. If only my work didn't pile up."
"What? How can it be like that? You can't just replace Doctor Jason with another doctor!” Draco's heart skipped a beat. If Harry is to replace Doctor Jason with a female doctor, then his plan to escape from this hospital and escape from Harry's clutches was just a fairy tale.
Draco moved with anticipation. After all, he hadn't fought swords in a long time. Known as a perfect queen, he would not want to disgrace his reputation with his defeat in front of the royal guards.
"Looks like you turned into a quiet person. You don't want to know why you got dressed?" Daphne asked after she finished putting the golden eyeshadow on Draco's lids.
Silence greeted the two nobles. They both stared at each other with intense gazes that were hard to decipher. Until footsteps that sounded like they were made as loud as they could tread the forest ground jolted Draco.
"Calm down. You're on the ground. You can breathe normally," Harry's voice brought Draco back to his senses.
"Oh, but if you're serious and want to make him a Titan, I might support him. As long as it is not Aphrodite." Hera talked about the Goddess of Beauty with a disapproving intonation.
"Would His Highness Draco want to dance with me?" asked the king with a smile and stretched out his left hand in front of the young man, Empress Draco, while the king's right hand was hidden behind his burly back.
In fact, before him, he was a real Greek god who was very old and had a lot of experience. Moreover, he was ready to pounce on him. Finally, he nervously looked up at the ceiling of his room.
A human passed him and asked what he was doing. Then he even explained about nuclear reactors and how to use them. At that time, Prometheus was a technician who took care of the advanced machines belonging to the Titans. Ares was already in his palace. He should have met his new wife. But Alastair notified him there was a local earthquake that forced them to split up. The prince of Sparta disappeared with his horse.
Ares didn't want to wait for Troya to answer. He took his hand gently and started it with a kiss on the forehead, which continued to the cheek near his right eye. Draco closed his eyes, and Ares gave his virgin lips a soft kiss.
"Prince of Sparta, you are the prize I won. Give birth to my child, stay beautiful to me, then I will guarantee comfort for the rest of your mortal life," Ares said.
The sound of the windows closing violently and the sound of the curtains pulling finally made Draco want to lift his head. The first thing Draco saw was Cedric with his back to him. The man seemed busy tidying the curtains covering the glass window. The prince wanted to make sure that there would not be a single ray of lightning that could penetrate the curtains.
"Have you forgotten the rules of the kingdom? A married person is not allowed to meet someone who is not married without the presence of another person between the two of them," Harry glared at Cedric.
"You're obviously nervous that I brought up about the first night, nothing to worry about. I do this a lot," He said in a reassuring tone. Draco could feel Ares' other hand starting to land on his thigh. Even if only for a moment, the touch made him hot.
The carriage door closed, and Draco heard the sound of the wheels turning along with the grunts and stomping of the horseshoe. Draco banged on the door, hoping anyone would hear. Before Draco gave up panicking and burst into tears—something was heard climbing into his carriage.
Draco spread his arms and hugged Ares back. He blushed when he felt Ares' breath, smelled his masculine scent, and heard his heartbeat. They were so close and touched each other. But Draco couldn't be completely safe because he didn't know him. Their hearts were still far apart, and each of them kept their distance without them knowing.
"I don't come here very often, but every time I pass through this forest, I will come here," Cedric explained.
Draco was embarrassed to hear that because Alastair explained the subject of women's bodies with a straight expression. Alastair could answer anything but Ares' personality. Alastair considered talking about his master without permission to be impudent.
Job vacancy. Quick and well-qualified job openings… Draco's eyes moved quickly and noted several suitable jobs. He emailed cover letters to several of these companies while he finished his breakfast.
And Draco wanted to open his heart again to Harry. Because he realized, even after three years had passed, he still had many feelings for him.
"Hey, Prince of Sparta. Look at me. Isn't there anything you want to ask your husband?" Ares looked impatient and anxious to find Troya looked passive.
Demigod, he said. Draco immediately realized again the nature of the gods of Olympus, who like to go around doing whatever they want. They are often told of sowing seeds everywhere, both fellow gods and mortal. The child from the marriage of the gods and the mortals was called a demigod.
Draco took the first bite and moaned, feeling the crème melt in his mouth and creating flavors that mingled with sweetness and delicacy. Little did he realize that Harry was staring at his expression with hungry eyes. Harry was in a horrible mood. His indescribable desire frustrated him immensely.
Draco wasn't angry with Cedric's words which could be categorized as an insult to the royalty. The young man laughed along with him.
The Titans either became oracles, blacksmiths or farmers. It was not uncommon for Titans to marry humans and have children from them, but usually, they tend to avoid it.
Abruptly, Draco stopped in his tracks. Even though he stopped, a satisfied snort escaped his lips as he saw the tip of his blade pointing straight at Cedric's chest.
Draco took a deep breath as one answer gathered in his head. He hoped that the answer would not plunge anyone into a bloody battle.
"Yes, that's neat, Arabelle." Draco lied and smiled sweetly so that Arabelle wouldn't feel inferior in front of Draco.
Draco quickly closed Luna's sketch, then glanced at Harry, who had just arrived and sat next to him.
Draco squeezed the manhood, and Harry groaned. The feeling that Harry was really excited about his touch made Draco feel good. Oh my, this is the best erotic dream he's ever had.
Draco looked at the man with various questions in his mind, but he had to be careful. He absolutely shouldn't tell anyone that he came from the future and woke up in someone else's body. They could accuse him of being a wizard and give him the death penalty.
"I don't want to get too involved in other people's relationships," Draco stated, smiling gently at Terence.
Draco had a monologue in his head, hoping that the child he was carrying would understand what Draco felt.
"Oh, Dray, if you're jealous, just tell us," Pansy whispered, chuckling slightly as she watched Draco, who had only been twirling his spoon until he didn't realize half of the soup had been scattered on the table.
Draco shook his head. The blonde pulled his face from Cedric's caresses. His hand was also removed from Cedric's grip. "This is wrong, Prince Cedric."
Cedric snorted grimly and turned his face nonchalantly to the other side of the garden when he saw his brother kneeling to help his attention-seeking mistress.
Draco stood at the edge of the garden watching the flowers that Harry's gardener cared for thoughtfully. Numerous kinds of flowers are there. Even though Harry was known to be cruel and cold, it turns out that this man still has the awareness that his house must be planted with flowers to make it look more lively and colorful from the outside.
Ares originally wanted to ignore and leave his sister without looking back. He had gotten used to all the intimidation from Athena during the thousands of years he becomes a god. The more he responded, the louder she would be, so Ares had better relent and got out of the way. But for some reason, Ares was now disturbed and turned to look at her.
The man came down the stairs and walked over to Draco. "Harry Potter," he whispered suddenly in Draco's ear.
He raised Draco's hand high and gently twirled the blonde so he could switch partners. Everything was fine at first until Harry's eyes caught the Delion Kingdom's crown prince, who seemed to be waiting for Draco's slender waist to fall into his hands.
"What are you doing? Want to come to take a shower with me?" Draco asked sarcastically. "If you dare to go into the bathroom or are suddenly in the bathroom, you will suffer the consequences!" he threatened, showing his fist.
In a flash, Alden stood up despite the worry on his face. He had overstepped his authority by telling Draco about Seraphina. He doesn't know what his master will do to him. Harry didn't even look at Draco at all. He turned around and let Alden follow him.
Harry raised his wounded hand to caress Draco's long hair, and Draco immediately remembered the incident when Harry quickly grabbed the knife, preventing Draco from getting hurt. Draco trembling unconsciously with terror.
"When Your Majesty's child grows up, would Your Majesty want to marry Your Majesty's child to my grandson in the future?" asked the King of the Delion with a smile as he looked at Draco.
Draco nodded gracefully to the woman Troya had spoken about quite often in the past. "I wonder what happened to me then. Did the snake really bite me?"
And noise in Draco's ear got louder and louder until he felt it in his brain. He closed his eyes and endured the pain. It's like someone forced their way into your brain, but you're trying to block it. The pain was so intense that Draco grabbed and squeezed Harry's hand.
Draco immediately panicked. Things got out of control. Why was he asked to be his own wedding planner? On Olympus? With the gods as their guest?
Draco wasn't prepared for this beforehand. Since the first time they met, Ares was always polite to him. Even when they were riding, he kept his hand away. His gentle behavior contradicts all the rumors and impressions of his character.
Draco closed his eyes in frustration. Harry's house was prominent in an elite suburban area from the information he got. The house was fenced with a high fence around it, and Harry's bodyguards guarded every entry. No one could enter this area of the house without the man's knowledge. Likewise, no one can get out of this house without Harry's permission.
At that time, Draco realized that no matter how hard he struggled for his relationship and bond with Harry, they would never be together if the universe didn't want it.
Soft music played along with Harry and Draco's elegant dance. At this time, only the Emperor and Empress filled the dance floor, while the other nobles chose to pull over to the side of the ballroom and watch a romantic scene that might later become a hot conversation among nobles.
After Hagrid left, Draco immediately lay down on the bed which was still comfortable enough to sleep on. His body was very tired. The journey, which took almost eleven hours, made his body, especially his buttocks hurt because he had to sit for hours.
Several times a month, the planetarium takes advantage of astronomical events such as the appearance of comets, meteor showers, or unique phenomena on the moon to invite residents to take turns looking at the sky with telescopes.
Alden nodded as if he could read the question in Draco's eyes. "Well, we've been watching you all along. The small house you shared with your family at that time was one of the properties belonging to master Harry. Everything was arranged so that your life is fine even though your father was bankrupt."
Given their current relationship was a secret, Cedric also invites the young man to travel to the forest. Cedric understood very well that Draco liked the outdoors.
To a seductive someone, he may not hesitate to show his true nature. With a human who has an independent nature, Ares may pretend to need them. He judges the character of humans. He approaches and behaves as they wish.
Harry's just joking, right? What did he mean by throwing Draco at his bodyguards? Did Harry want to give Draco to get raped by his bodyguards? After all, Draco was a man, and Harry's bodyguards were male too. So it can't be possible...
"Yes, of course, master Harry was against it. The pregnancy was dangerous. Mrs. Seraphina's life was at stake,” Alden bowed his head sadly. "Then Mrs. Seraphina miscarried."
Startled, Draco turned his body and almost hit Harry's chest. The man stood very close behind him and pressed him to the door. His eyes lit up with rage, like a demon ready to burn his enemies.
Harry was visibly frustrated at Draco's refusal. An Alpha is not used to rejection. He brushed his dark strands with a sigh. Draco stifled as Harry's hand subconsciously grabbed Draco's wrist, his expression full of pleading.
"Tom," Harry growled. He knew it before Alden even told him. That rotten bastard dares to do this. Tom didn't know what awaited him. Harry's gonna chop him to a pulp. "Have you found him?"
The King considered. He was reluctant to let his son marry. The King imagined Troya as Goddess Artemis, who was always divine and calmed his heart. He couldn't think of having his son, who behaved gently and beautifully touched by another man. Therefore the King rejected all the envoys who came to propose to Troya. He intends to keep Troya forever in his palace as an antidote to his sadness and calm when upset because of country problems.
"Isn't that beautiful, Your Majesty?" asked Cedric when he saw Draco fixated on what he was currently staring at.
If the Spartan prince were destined to die before meeting Ares, his body would probably be sent back to Sparta. Ares knew that prince Troya's current position was in Hades' territory. It was the worst place for humans because the monsters there were much more ferocious than in other areas. In addition, Hades likes to experiment with humans in the name of science.
Finally, Draco gave up. He was thirsty until he felt like fainting, and he had to drink. Otherwise, he might have collapsed entirely. Draco must not collapse. He must find a way to escape from this room, from this house.
"All right, Cedric." Draco broke off as he turned his body and took a step towards the shady tree that had been attracting his attention.
His hands moved to take the wet dress and underwear into his arms. Quickly, he straight out of the river. Arriving at the river bank, the blonde squeezed the clothing and underwear tightly.
"However, I'm looking forward to the good news from the Shinia Kingdom. I'm looking forward to the babies from Your Majesty and His Majesty."
Harry's lips still had a smile on them, but not his eyes. Those eyes glowed with cold, sharp glint. “You can't go home. Now, this is your home. Together with me."
"You are Seraphim. When I say you are Seraphim, then you are Seraphim." The man then turned his gaze towards the bed.
Harry firmly believed himself to be one hundred percent straight. But since Draco came into his life and confronted Harry with arrogance - where Draco's appearance was different when he was in high school, more mature and attractive — made Harry want to conquer the young man. Draco was the one who had to give up in his arms.
He let his unprotected buttocks litter the dirt by the riverbank. To reduce the chill that hit him, Draco bent his legs. The young man's long hair was left loose so that it covered his chest and slightly covered his smooth back.
"Damn ants! What a terrifying forest! The gods living here must be insane! Why don't they just live on a tropical island anyway? Why the mountains? It's barren and cold here. Good grief! I need my mosquito repellent! I could catch malaria here!"
How did Harry know? Did his husband ask the servant? Or was his husband checking Draco's library? But, it was too wonderful to happen.
"Thank you for raising my mood again, Your Majesty." Cedric teased with his trademark grinning smile.
Draco grimaced inwardly. He had never seen his husband dance with anyone, except with himself and, of course... with Arabelle. Obviously, his husband didn't want to make his very naive mistress feel jealous.
Then, with a slight gasp, Harry let go of Draco's lips. They sat face to face with flushed cheeks, so close that their hot breaths collided.
The entire stone building, which was almost half made of marble, and the carvings of the statues of the gods around it, are probably just filming properties. His physique, which transformed into a blonde Greek prince with a face like the fairies, was probably the result of the hard work of skilled surgeons.
"Who are you? Why does my heart hurt when I see you?" Draco felt his body suddenly become very tired and weak. And in an instant, his consciousness was taken over by darkness.
Draco opened his mouth to argue. The man had just said 'mortal' like Harry. Why do these creatures always call humans 'mortal'? Draco could have called them "weird creatures", but he's not that evil. After all, his best friend Luna is a fairy.
The maid gulped nervously. She hesitated to answer Draco's question. She didn't want to lie to her queen, but on the other hand, she didn't want to make her queen feel sad.
The legend tells about Prometheus, a Titan who shared the knowledge of how to make fire with humans. When Zeus found out, he imprisoned him on a high mountain and let the birds peck at his flesh and heart. In fact, Prometheus was not teaching humans how to make fire.
She's a happy woman. Beautiful, happy woman, Draco corrected. With her beautiful golden white dress, perfect hairdo, simple make-up, and her eyes sparkling with love. This woman in front of him seemed to radiate happiness. Her husband must have loved her very much.
Draco flinched. His eyes immediately turned from that beautiful place toward Cedric, who had already slipped from the horse first.
"No, of course not." Ares shook his head and put his arm around his wife's shoulder. Which he immediately let go of because with just that fleeting touch, dirty thoughts flashed through his head.
Draco shook his head, trying to wriggle, but Harry's strong body that was half crushed him limited his movements. Moreover, his hands were tied up, making his arms feel cramped, and his wrists ached when he moved them.
Draco never expected that all the Gods of Olympus would attend this dinner, but the guests who came at this time were only quite familiar with Ares or his descendants. Draco became convinced that their marriage indeed was not remarkable. Ares did say that his family would attend this banquet, but Draco thought it would be more crowded because almost all the Gods of Olympus were related by blood. In fact, it seems nearly all gods were descendants of Zeus.
"I never have sex while standing up," Harry whispered in his ear, in a hot whisper that made Draco tingle all over. "And you make me want to do it,"
A gasp could be heard from there, and when Draco turned his head, the women appeared to be standing with their faces blushed, embarrassed by Harry's insult. Then for various reasons, they separate and choose to move to other places.
"I promised to hand him over, my Queen. If we violate our promise, maybe he will destroy Sparta and kill thousands of innocent souls." the man called the King of Sparta also mourned.
He glanced at his watch, and it was ten o'clock. In an hour, his class would start, and he was still far from campus. If Draco didn't make it to class in time, he would be hooked by Professor Trelawney's tantrum.
Draco remained standing where he was holding a small umbrella to protect himself. Actually, he really wanted to sit down, but he didn't see a seat there. If Draco sat on the ground, his dress would be dirty, and for sure, Glenice would scold him.
"Your Majesty, it seems that you don't have a partner anymore. May I be your partner now?" asked the crown prince politely to Draco as he extended his hand.
"It's just that you need to know that your fate and future life depend on your own decisions. This was Olympus. You will be safe as long as you are in my palace and with me, but it is different if you leave my palace. I don't like people who disobey, so when you speak, you have to do it."
"So Your Majesty wants me to be alone with His Majesty in public? I'd be very blessed if Your Majesty gave me that permission," said Cedric with a smile already on his face.
"This sword of mine is a gift from Ares which when slashed will burn his flesh at the same time. It's harrowing, but the bleeding won't last long," Alastair explained.
Draco tapped Icarus on the shoulder, a little awkward. "Don't worry. I won't deal with him again after this."
But Draco sensed something was there, something different that was a little frightening to him. The sexual tension that filled this room felt so uncomfortable. And despite Harry's offer seeming so fascinating, Draco didn't dare to take a risk.
Draco frowned. Since his last attempt to escape, the guard over him had been tight. There were two men in black suits and brawny bodies guarding the door. Tonight is the first time Draco has been given the freedom to come down and out of this room. If Draco was alert enough, maybe he could escape this house.
"Ares! Marrying a human, really? How long are you going to keep against your father, huh?" A female voice was heard. Then Draco saw an auburn-haired Goddess with a perfect physique. She looks both motherly and resolute.
"You really dare to challenge Mr. Potter like that," Daphne muttered half grumpily. From earlier, this delicate woman had been busy grumbling because she had to start over to dress Draco.
"What's that on your hand? Did something scratch you?" Ares asked to break the silence between them. He still had Draco in his arms.
Harry crushed Draco's open lips and slipped his tongue inside. Their tongues are tangled, hot, and wet. Harry's lips smashed Draco's lips mercilessly, smacking each side, with enthusiasm.
"Draco," Harry called out Draco's name with exasperation. "You have to get well soon so I can take you home. It's not safe here."
"Like a girl's voice—" Natalie didn't have time to say the whole sentence, but the woman immediately covered her mouth when she saw Harry suddenly released his grip on Draco's waist.
Harry pushed him roughly against the door, and to his surprise, Draco could feel Harry's hard-on pushing firmly against his back. He wanted to move and dodge, but it turned out that Harry was already pressing him on all sides.
"I... I intend to charge extra for the linen cloth that the kingdom is going to sell," Draco said cautiously.
The frenetic atmosphere made Draco squint his eyes. He didn't like this crowded and suffocating atmosphere. He missed his room, a quiet, peaceful place where he could sit and read while listening to soft music. This booming music was almost beyond his tolerance, it felt like he would leave this place, but he couldn't. That man, that evil man — according to the source, Draco heard that he would be coming to this place in a few moments.
Draco thought for a moment that person named Cyllenius probably had a strong card in Troya's illness. It could be that he also holds information about how his soul could transfer to Troya's body. Draco knew this might be a waste of time, but he didn't want to take his fate for granted without struggling.
"Maybe you want to know about me, and maybe I should ask you a few questions too?" Draco said it while looking the other way. He hated himself and his own thoughts right now. Why did the clothes of the ancient Greeks have to be so revealing?
"What do you mean?!" Harry’s voice suddenly rising as he could no longer contain the emotions that were already bubbling up inside him.
"Harry, where are you going?" asked Arabelle, looking sadly at Harry wearing his satin pants that were lying on the floor of Arabelle's room in a hurry.
"Ahh..." Draco moaned again when the wave of joy came. Vlad didn't stop, he kept pumping himself inside Draco's body.
Really, Cedric could not understand him. A very sharp iron sword had just hit his neck, but he still had the courage to speak, as if he was not afraid that his actions would make fresh blood flow again profusely from his neck.
What happened next was completely unexpected for Draco. Harry sat down and kissed his lips, open mouth and all, simultaneously draining the water down his throat.
Hermione laughed spontaneously at Draco's question. "No, I think my husband is the most handsome in the world. I don't have time to admire other men." Hermione smiled, and her eyes sparkled with love at the thought of her husband.
With firm steps and a calm face, the man walked towards the place where the royal family was gathered. The man knew that his father's concubine stiffened when she saw him coming, but he didn't care.
"We can do it quietly, Draco. It's just you and me. Your position as queen won't be dirty because of our relationship. The Shinia Kingdom and the Malfoy family will continue to have a good relationship," Cedric said softly, successfully making Draco even more indecisive.
"You are the one who is targeted by your enemies. Why should I even bother?!" interrupted Draco angrily with burning eyes.
"Looks like you have a lot of questions, but don't worry, we have a long time to answer them because Olympus is still far from here," Alastair responded with a cheerful smile. Draco smiled back awkwardly. He had just cut off someone's arm, but right now, he was acting casually like he was just slashing at a tree branch.
Draco smiled shyly in response. He had been nervous because he had to ride with the god earlier. Draco pretended to be asleep until he finally really fell asleep. Hopefully, the way he sleeps isn't too ugly. He was already quite sorry that he had to meet him in such a shabby and dirty state for the first time. If Ares also had to hear him snoring loudly or drooling in his sleep—the god would probably lose interest and cancel their marriage.
Harry felt Draco's hips move, felt his pulsation gripping his body heat, which was embedded deep inside the blonde—pushing bravely, pulling Harry even closer. Harry gritted his teeth again, restrained himself, allowed Draco to move his hips, seeking his own pleasure at will. Then he gripped Draco's throbbing cock tightly as another moan was ripped out from Draco's sinful mouth. It didn't take long when the pretty blonde finally reached the fulfillment of his satisfaction.
"Prince of Sparta, I am Eros, son of Aphrodite. Sorry I overheard your conversation," The handsome man introduced himself. Draco just nodded. Eros was the God of Love whose story was famous in Greece. About him who fell in love with Psyche and had time to oppose his mother. Eros was Aphrodite's son from her affair with Ares.
This was what Harry likes when he spends time with Arabelle. His mistress always managed to make Harry laugh because of her adorable spoiled behavior. The girl always managed to make Harry forget the piles of papers on his desk.
He understood that Draco had felt immense pain because of someone. And even now, he's trying to heal himself.
"Watch your attitude. They are the messengers of the God of War!" The King of Sparta gave a soft rebuke. He seemed unfazed by the treasure, which he thought was Troya. No amount of treasure will be able to replace his beloved son...
In contrast to Cedric, who looked at Draco with a gentle smile and a warm gaze, Draco looked at the man with an even stare.
The second thing he has to do was take his savings, and maybe he will go to the Bank this afternoon. Draco took a sip of his fragrant tea and took a sip of it with deliciously hot gulps. At least drinking tea makes his stomach comfortable and no longer nauseous. Then he started eating his breakfast while opening a job search site on his laptop.
However, the admiration had to be interrupted when Harry saw Draco's body about to move sideways again. With wide strides, Harry approached Draco and held the young man's body a little hard.
When Draco looked at Doctor Jason in confusion, Doctor Jason sighed, "Hmm… He didn't tell you, did he? Don't tell him you found out from me."
Draco could see his husband staring at him in confusion and astonishment. The sharp look that adorned his husband's emerald eyes and a faint frown on his forehead as if to say that he didn't like Draco's behavior.
"I haven't tried it yet, but I know how it will turn out. I don't want the feeling to drive me crazy. I'm afraid that feeling will make me forget who I am."
Harry's thoughts were interrupted when a knock on the door echoed from outside his room. He folded back the stiff invitation paper neatly and dumped it on the table.
Daphne was there, flaunting Draco's newly ordered clothes, while the blonde just sat over there, staring bored at the expensive clothes. Daphne immediately stopped her activities and asked permission to leave as soon as Harry entered with a grumpy face.
Draco sways his hips in desperation, his desire rising mercilessly. He wanted Harry inside him soon. Oh god, he wanted Harry so badly!
"Aren't you here to escort me? If we talk too much, you can fail to notice any snakes or wild boars that could harm me," Draco said again, trying to assert his attitude towards Hector. All this time, Troya was too doubtful and didn't dare refuse Hector, frankly. His heart was too kind to sacrifice his own feelings.
"Who told you to come out, huh?" Harry's voice rose slightly, burning with jealousy, but he didn't want to admit it. He then grabbed Draco's wrist. "Hurry up and get inside," he ordered.
"Then... your clothes? What happened to your clothes? Has something happened between you and His Majesty?" asked Cedric quickly, much to Draco's dismay.
