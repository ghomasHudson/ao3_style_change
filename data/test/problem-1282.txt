Draco looked up at him, with a look on his face that suggested he didn’t want to answer that question but he did anyway, and that stirred something in Harry at having Draco’s trust put in him, despite him not knowing what he’d done to deserve it.
“Don’t you dare call my – “
Harry looked him in the eyes, wanting nothing more than to kiss him just to shut him up, but he didn’t. He just stood there, trying to think of something to say to stop him from saying what he was, but to no avail. He knew what he needed to do. He needed to show Draco just how much Draco needed him, as much as he needed Draco. To show him that his fears, whatever they are, are unfounded.
Harry slammed his fist down on the table and caused sparks to shoot out of his wand.
“Can’t do what? Admit how you feel? For god’s sake, Potter just look at me and tell me how you feel!”  Draco exclaimed, putting both of his hands on Harry’s shoulders.
There! He saw a flash of blonde hair again, the figure it belonged to running down a side alley a few metres ahead of him. Adrenaline going into near overdrive at this point, he ran to chase the figure down. The sound of someone shouting his name doing nothing to stop him. Malfoy or not, this was a Death Eater and he wasn’t going to let him get away that easily. The smell of burnt flesh and death filled Harry’s nostrils as he jumped over burning rubble and the sight of innocent
“I will!” Pansy exclaimed, a look of victory on her face. There was no wonder she was sorted into Slytherin, Draco thought to himself. She always had a way of getting exactly what she wanted.
“Oh yes you do. There’s only one person I know who’s ever made you so stroppy and annoyingly withdrawn when thinking and that’s Harry bloody Potter. What has he done to you? Do I need to go and give him a piece of my mind and punch him because I will, his golden boy image doesn’t faze me!”
interested. And as it seems to have escaped your notice, the war has been over for 7 years now and Draco has just as much right to walk these halls as you do. More so probably since he knows the difference between yes and no. Now please kindly,
“Peterson. Xavier Peterson.”
Hermione looked ready to interject again so Harry tried to change the subject. “You enjoying your birthday so far? I don’t think I’ve ever seen Ron looking so stressed to get something right before.” He chuckled.
Harry arrived at grimmauld place a few seconds later and started pacing the floor of the kitchen.
“I don’t.” Draco said without thinking.
“Why…” Draco asked quietly.
“We’ll need a rendezvous point if this is going to work. If someone catches you casting a patronus then you’re screwed. I didn’t think Death Eaters even could.”
The sound of Draco Malfoy crying out in pain made Harry’s anger come rushing in in full force for reasons he wasn’t sure of but he decided he had heard enough.
“Piss off. What are you even doing here anyway?”
“Sorry ‘mione, just a case at work that’s keeping me preoccupied.” Harry lied. Hermione didn’t look convinced, however, and raised an eyebrow in response.
Harry put his arm around Hermione and gave her a squeeze. “You two getting married anytime soon then?” He teased. The whole Weasley family had been taking bets for the past year on when either Ron or Hermione was going to pop the question.
about me, Potter. You don’t know the position I’m in. What he’s done.” Tears clouded Draco’s eyes as he spoke. His voice turning rough.
“I assume you remember that as part of the terms of your probation, I have to keep this wand here whilst you visit, Mr. Malfoy?”
“Piss off, Malfoy. Are you alright to move now? Where do you live, I don’t want you walking home alone in case there’s a repeat performance of you getting the shit beaten out of you.”
Draco smirked. “Well it took me long enough.” His smirk faltered, worry and regret seeming to take its place in the lines of his face. “Not too long, I hope.”
Harry looked back at Draco. “It was the right thing to do. You and your mother weren’t guilty of those charges. Narcissa actually saved my life. There was no way I could let you…and her go to Azkaban. Don’t thank me again. It was the right thing to do.” Harry repeated.
Harry finally concluded. All that had been going over and over in his head all evening after he had come back from the burrow was Draco. That man would be the death of him. He needed to see him. He had tried to give him his space but he just couldn’t do it anymore. He didn’t care if Draco turned him away as soon as he got there and told him he was an idiot and it didn’t mean anything, he just needed to
“It’s no problem”, Harry sad rubbing the back of his neck, shuffling awkwardly at the new change in atmosphere. Cordiality wasn’t something new between Harry and Draco. For the past few years they had been civil to each other when needed. However, this was something else. This was a moment of genuine sincerity on Draco’s part. His Malfoy mask had slipped away for the briefest of moments and behind it Harry saw the glimpse of a vulnerable and changed man from the sneering, sniping boy he had known in his youth. He looked weary and all of a sudden all Harry wanted was to take the man in his arms and hold him and protect him until all was right. Harry shook his head to try and get rid of these feelings. Wait…feelings? Since when had he had feelings for Malfoy of all people aside from irritation and suspicion?
“I’m here to see Harry Potter. Could you please tell him I’m here?”
He had spent most of those few days since brooding in self-pity, only leaving his flat or shop if it was completely necessary. Instead choosing to keep himself busy with his potions. This was much to the dismay of his friends, Pansy and Blaise. He’d told Pansy what had happened that day which had earned him a 20 minute lecture from her about how he needs to stop being such a martyr and just go for what he wants for once, because he does deserve it and now he’s gone and been an idiot, probably hurting, Potter in the process. Not that she cared about Potter’s feelings, however, she was quick to point out. It was Draco she was concerned about. That had led to, Blaise being let in on what had happened and them both now being on a mission it seemed, to make Draco go and shove Harry against a wall, kissing him senseless. Or at least, that was Pansy’s suggestion. Blaise seemed to understand more about why Draco had done what he had, but kept that opinion to himself most of the time at the risk of being snapped at by Pansy. Draco couldn’t help but internally chuckle at that, however. Pansy and Blaise really were like an old married couple sometimes and he knew that they had both liked each other for ages but were just too stubborn to admit it. So really, they were in no position to be giving
“I didn’t want to go back there after the war. It was my home for years but since, Vol
Draco kissed him in between speaking “How could I…leave you…after you just said…what I had been waiting to hear…for years…you twit…”
Harry wasn’t sure why he decided to use Malfoy’s first name but it sounded right on his tongue when he said it.
feel? Your reaction yesterday wasn’t exactly joyous!” Harry’s temper was rising now. It was his defence mechanism.
“Draco! What are you doing here?” Harry’s voice drew the other man’s attention to him, his face turning into a sneer.
he thought to himself for the countless time that day. This was the day he was going to go to Draco and finally attempt to make some sense of just what the hell was going on between them.
this is gonna make you frustrated ngl.
“Ex – death eater you twat. And you only did what you had to save your family. But fine if you don’t want my help then I’ll go.”
You can find me on tumblr @life-on-terra if you wanna stalk me ;)
“Draco,
“Don’t worry Pans, I can look after myself but you don’t need to punch him anyway. He hasn’t done anything wrong…if anything I’m the one who’s been an idiot.” Draco said staring at the table.
. So he decided. He’s going to go to Draco’s after work tomorrow. This was something he needed to do and he wasn’t going to let anything stop him.
Harry stepped slightly closer again, “I would have waited longer. Now come with me, we should probably talk before the urge to kiss you gets any stronger and I have to detain myself for public indecency.”
. In those piercing grey eyes that were plaguing his mind at the moment. He pushed that thought to the back of his mind, however. He didn’t want to think about it anymore. It was exhausting. He knew it would still come back to him at night though. When he would lay awake, his thoughts going a mile a minute. Always resulting in him having broken dreams that involved silver eyes, white hair and soft lips.
“What the fuck are you doing? Do you think that was funny or something Potter?” Malfoy spat.
Pansy rolled her eyes “You absolute idiot, Draco Malfoy! How long have you waited for this and you
“I do deserve it. It’s true what he said. I was a coward in the war and by all rights I should have been chucked in Azkaban. This is the third time now that you’ve saved me Potter. I can look out for myself I don’t need your help.” Draco said while trying to lift himself up off of the floor.
“What are you staring at Potter?” Malfoy snapped defensively. His mask now firmly back in place.
As Draco’s mind whirled around with these thoughts and questions, Harry’s mind was on only one thing. How the fuck was he getting out of here?
Draco simply looked on at Harry waiting for him to start talking. His cool outside demeanour portraying the complete opposite of what he felt like inside, where it seemed like the original butterflies had now turned into a bunch of Cornish pixies inside his stomach. Harry finally managed to snap out of the spell that it felt like Draco had on him and remember why he was there in the first place.
“Merlin’s bollocks, Draco didn’t you think I’d already thought about all that. I know there are going to be people who are going to hate even the idea of us. I know that there is going to be articles and comments in the street and all that rubbish. But
Harry snorted. “Doesn’t being so vain ever get tiring for you?”
Draco arrived at the ministry foyer just as the morning rush of workers was in full swing. Now that he was here he didn’t really know what to do. He just needed to see Harry, to hear his voice, to hold him and feel him against his body again. He made his way to the reception, wary of the glances he received from witches and wizards as they saw him. However, rather than feeling the need to hunch his shoulders and trying to resist the urge to disillusion himself, he held his head high in the way he used to before the war. Just as he came near to the reception desk to hand in his wand, he saw a mop of wild black hair and flash of Auror robes to his left. He turned his head so fast he almost cricked his neck and stopped to stare at him. The man he wanted so much his heart beat was ricocheting inside his chest. Then he saw who he was with. He was tall and well-built with dark shoulder length, wavy chestnut hair…and he was standing entirely too close for Draco’s liking. They were by the fountain, the man leaning in and placing a hand on an obviously uncomfortable Harry’s shoulder as Harry reached up to brush his hand off, shaking his head at whatever the (smarmy haired handsy bastard, as Draco was calling him in his head) was saying to him. He felt a fierce flame of jealousy and anger burn in his chest and found his feet taking him towards the pair at an impressive pace. He didn’t take his eyes off them once, taking in everything about Harry’s appearance and body language. He seemed to be trying to politely excuse himself to little avail, as the man kept stepping forward every time he took a step back to leave. Well sod that for a game of gobstones, no one was allowed to touch Harry like that. As he approached, his footsteps echoing off the vast marble walls, Harry turned his head and met Draco’s eyes. Relief seemed to flash across his face and then apprehension as he saw Draco’s eyes flash with obvious contempt.
The silver light swirled around the alley and formed into an elegant and beautiful swan that flew round Harry and Draco’s still forms for a few seconds before dissolving into mist.
“It’s you. You’re the one who’s been sending us information. I don’t understand! Are you on our side or not?! If you are then why don’t you defect? We can keep you safe, Malfoy.”
Before Draco could even respond, Harry had stepped in front of him and drawn himself up to his full height. “Actually
That smirk sent Harry over the edge. He couldn’t stop the blush spreading with full force at that and soon he was a brilliant colour of red which there was no way he could hide from Draco. He needed to get out of there before he started something he would regret. Draco’s lips still had that playful smirk on them and no matter how hard he tried he couldn’t stop staring at them. Fluctuating between trying to look anywhere in the room apart from Draco and failing miserably when he kept subconsciously darting back to Draco’s lips and then back up to his brilliant shining silver eyes that if Harry was not mistaken, were looking at him in a way that suggested they had achieved their goal. He couldn’t. What was he doing right now? He couldn’t kiss Draco Malfoy. It was
And with that, the man dissaparated. Harry, still internally fuming turned to Malfoy who was still led on the side of the path, his nose bleeding and cuts across his face and hands, looking utterly spent. Harry performed a healing charm to fix his broken nose and stop the flow of blood, while also healing his cuts.
“…Malfoy scum”, a man spat. “You and your whore of a Mother should have been thrown in Azkaban along with your pathetic Father. “
Draco threw his hand back against his head in a look of mock hurt. Seeing this playful side of Draco was something Harry was by no means used to and he found himself laughing along with Malfoy before he knew it. A foreign experience but a good one none the less Harry thought. Draco’s laugh was loud but warm and genuine and wasn’t what Harry had expected from the sneering Malfoy he had known in previous years. After the laughter had died down Harry also sat down on the sofa next to Draco and met his eyes still shining with the remnants of a laugh.
Harry blinked, being brought back into reality from his wandering thoughts. He couldn’t stop analysing what had happened between him and Draco three days previously, what he had done wrong and what was even happening to begin with. Harry and his feelings had never been close and he’d spent most of his life either trying to ignore them or being overpowered by them, especially if he was angry. A trait that led to a lot of his reckless decisions.
Draco braced himself for an onslaught of Harry’s rage. However, Harry didn’t immediately shout at him like Draco had expected. Instead what he said hurt much worse.
“Look, we
“We can’t…I can’t. Please, Harry just leave. I’m doing this for you. Just trust me that we can’t.
“Of course.” Draco answered, still not looking at Harry. Something about his tone had changed and Harry felt uneasy.
Draco didn’t answer immediately, making Harry even more nervous. What if he regretted it now?
Harry looked straight into his eyes – “I like you. Okay, I think I’ve always liked you but I didn’t even realise it until now.”
“Oh Gods if you like it then it must be in urgent need of redecorating. I don’t trust your sense of style, Potter. After all you’re still wearing those bloody glasses you’ve had since school.” Draco looked him up and down which led to Harry feeling extremely exposed. He hadn’t been sleeping well lately, if he ever did, and he was still wearing his work clothes from last night, with a shadow of stubble on his face since he hadn’t had time to shave. Draco would never admit it but Potter with stubble was a sight he wouldn’t mind seeing again.
A small voice answered in the back of his mind.
Pansy was used to it, however, and simply smirked back whilst raising an eyebrow, “yeah, of course you don’t.”
“What do you mean?” Harry answered, feigning innocence.
“Don’t worry, Potter. I didn’t know my looks made me irresistible for even the chosen one. Although you might want to refrain from feeling me up in public. People might begin to talk and we wouldn’t want that to happen would we?” Draco said smirking.

Draco didn’t say or do anything for a second, as if he was having just as hard a time trying to remember how to function as Harry was. For the briefest of moments, he thought he saw a flash of what looked like apprehension in Draco’s eyes but it was gone almost as soon as it had appeared, as he turned to the side, opening the door wider and gesturing to Harry to come in, shutting the door after him, letting him make his way up to Draco’s living room.
Harry lowered his wand but kept a tight grip on it, still not entirely trusting Malfoy.
I’m expected back at the Manor and there’s only so much tardiness that will go unnoticed.” Draco glared.
“What? Yeah I am I’m just…thinking at the same time that’s all. Besides if I have to hear anything else about this new love conquest of yours I might just hex myself so I don’t have to listen to it anymore.” Draco quipped back.
Harry gives Draco his space. Its not going to last long though.
“It’s nothing…something happened that’s all and I don’t know what to do about it just yet.” Draco answered feigning a blank expression on his face in order to not give anything away.
“Okay, thank you, Maria.” Harry said walking back to his desk where Draco was still stood.
“Expelliarmus”, Harry cast the spell and caught the wand of Malfoys attacker. “What the FUCK do you think you’re doing?” he growled through gritted teeth. The man looked shocked at having Harry Potter standing inches from his face. He had shoulder length thestral black hair and his eyes looked distant and cold with a scar across his left cheek. Probably a remnant from the war. A lot of people still bore the scars both visible and invisible. He looked shocked at being prevented from continuing his abuse of Malfoy who many of the wizarding world still bore a heavy grudge against and who would usually have turned a blind eye but the vexation in his face was beginning to turn into fear at the ferocious anger and disgust flashing behind Harry’s eyes. It was so powerful and threatening, that it made even Draco who was lying half conscious and bloody upon the floor take notice and look at in awe.
“And I can still beat you in a dual so watch your tongue,
With that, Harry took Draco’s hand and led him towards reception, ignoring the people around them who looked like their jaws were almost hanging off, or who were murmuring amongst themselves shooting shocked or suspicious looks towards Draco.
“But why now? Why would he suddenly have feelings for me now? Completely out of the blue like that, it’s just not realistic!”
“Well done, I think you just managed to announce that to the whole café.” Draco muttered whilst stirring his coffee absentmindedly.
Harry hesitated. There had to be another way. Visions of Snape and the sacrifice he made still haunt him at night. There has been so much death. He didn’t want to be responsible for another one. The scars they leave cut far too deep already and he doesn’t know if he can take more. But they needed this information. It was the only way they were staying afloat in this war. Without it there would be even more destruction and the hope of destroying Voldemort and the stain he was leaving on the wizarding world would be near impossible at this point. People were scared and the threat to their own and their families lives were becoming too much. Their numbers were dwindling. They needed hope and the promise of more of it in the fight back.
“Yes mum.” Draco answered sarcastically. “I better get going now actually” Draco said, leaving some money on the table and rising from his chair along with Pansy. They said their goodbyes and Draco made his way to the ministry. His stomach feeling like he had Cornish pixies flying around in it, hoping that Harry didn’t stupefy him as soon as he laid eyes on him.
Blaise wasn’t the type to give advice regularly and so when he did, it always made Draco sit up and listen. He knew they were both right. He knew he shouldn’t have walked out on Harry after that afternoon but he also feels like he is doing the right thing for once in his life. By staying away he was protecting Harry. This was his chance to actually do something selfless and good.
Harry ran his hands down his face. “No! No it wasn’t pity, I…I don’t know why I kissed you, okay?! It just happened. I just…”
him earlier.
The man who has seemed to have despised everything about me since the day I offered you my friendship at the age of 11. What was I supposed to think?” Draco looked up at that last bit and studied Harry’s face, but he couldn’t read what he was thinking. He looked in his eyes and thought he saw what looked like an inner conflict battling behind them.
“Well where would you propose, oh chosen one? If I’m seen in the company of a stranger let alone a member of the Order then it will arouse enough suspicion for my head to be on a chopping block. What we are doing here is too risky as it is, which is thanks to you for chasing me down by the way.” Draco’s snark almost made it feel like some of the weight Harry was carrying had been lifted off his shoulders momentarily as he was sent back by the nostalgia of walking the corridors of Hogwarts. His lip twitched with the start of a smirk until the words truly hit and he realised how right Draco was. This was too risky.
Draco stared down at the fresh batch of mostly anonymous hate letters arrived this morning. He could just Incendio them but, as Pansy likes to frequently point out, he’s a masochist who won’t forgive himself because then he’d have to find something else to do other than brooding in his potions cave. This is what he didn’t want Harry to have to deal with. To see. The attack in Diagon Alley was by no means the first and wouldn’t be the last. Harry couldn’t be there all the time to save him, he didn’t want to be saved. He just wanted a normal life. What if Harry ended up getting hurt on his behalf?! No. He wasn’t going to allow that to happen. Even if it meant he was banged up in Azkaban for the next 100 years, he would never let it. That’s why it’s better for them to just stay away from each other and get on with the lives that are expected of them. Potter can settle down with the she weasel or some other bint, have a few kids and become Minster of Magic or something else ridiculously noble. Draco can continue to run his Potions shop, hopefully regain some of his fallen reputation and most probably either die alone or have an arranged marriage and produce an heir, whilst dying on the inside because the one thing he always wanted would never be his. He can practically hear Pansy’s irritating voice.
Harry and Ginny both left at the same time, not long afterwards, after having a glass of champagne or two as a toast to Ron and Hermione. As they were walking towards to gate, getting ready to dissaparate, Ginny pulled Harry aside by his arm.
The figure stopped as he came to a dead end; his breathing frantic. They both pointed their wands at each other. The tension in the air so thick it felt like a physical force crushing their lungs.
“Yeah it looks like it” Harry answered sarcastically. “Here, let me help you.”
“Hmmmm” Draco hummed back, meeting her gaze and offering a weak smile back. “Thanks Pans.”
“I can’t. Harry please stop. I just can’t.” Draco said, trying to stop his voice from cracking as he unwillingly let his emotions show through, turning his face away from Harry
Pansy tossed back her long black hair and faked an innocent look whilst looking at her perfectly manicured nails. “Well you know what they say, if you have a talent for something you might as well exploit it.”
“What, nothing. I was just thinking while you got some of your strength back.”
Hey guys, sorry its been a while. A year and a half is actually disgraceful...oops. This is just a really short chapter but I wanted to give you something and its going to lead up to some nice longer fluffier one's soon, so stay tuned. I was reluctant to finish this fanfiction because even though it wasn't really that long ago, I feel like my writing style and actual life experience that I can use to write better stories has changed quite a lot. I've had a bit of a rough time of it lately and thought fuck it, why not! It makes me happy to write and read your comments, so I'm gonna finish it. Even if reading the other chapters makes me cringe ;) Hope you enjoy and I'll post again soon. I have four days off work so I have plenty of time. Love you all - Millie <3
“What about?”
“Wand.”
“I’m slaving away in here guys, stop having so much fun without me!” Ron called from the doorway of the house. “Lunch is ready though so come on you two” he gestured to the pair of them.
“Wow…um…come to your senses then?” Harry said slightly breathlessly, taking in Draco’s pink cheeks and ruffled hair, before darting down to his wet lips. Their eyes met again and the lust and
“Sod off.” Harry grinned.
For some reason that sent a pang of hurt through Draco’s body and he was left simply standing in the same spot whilst Harry turned his back to him and rested his hands on his desk in front of him. Leaving Draco
Thanks for any of you who are still reading this or if you have just started i love you all <3
Harry whipped back around and found himself closer to Draco than he was anticipating. Their eyes met and he suddenly became aware of how fast his heart was beating. His breath was coming out heavy and fast and he felt like he was rooted to the spot.
“I haven’t seen you in over 2 weeks now Draco and Blaise said he’s heard nothing from you either. He’s so busy all the time that I’ve been forced to spend time with Millicent. Millie, Draco! There’s only so much talk of cats that one woman can stand. I’ve let you have time for your self-pitying “oh I’m a death eater, everybody hates me” moods but now I’m not having it. I mean it! It’s been years, Draco. So you get a few hate letters and every now and then you’ll get some loony on the street trying to start something – you’re better than that. Everyone makes mistakes. Do you think I like my life sometimes? I get just as much hate as you do a lot of the time but, I know who I am and I’m not going to let someone’s bitter opinion of what I did when I was a naïve and scared teenager, ruin my life. I mean come on, I bet even the great Harry potter gets hate mail every now and then. Some of those Prophet articles aren’t very favourable the whole time, you know. They’re just words though Dray. Written by people who can’t move on and just need someone to blame. Someone to vent all their frustration and anger towards, and you don’t have to read it. You don’t have to let it rule your life. Now come on, Draco. Get the fuck out of this house and go fuck Potter against a wall somewhere because Merlin, does that guy look like he needs it right now.”
“Hmmmm” Harry hummed in response. He was too dazed to think of a good response and so simply pulled Draco into another kiss.
“As much as I would love to just spend all day ravishing you, I really need to get some work done.” Harry glanced at his pile of paperwork on his desk and then longingly back at Draco before nuzzling into his neck.
“But, Draaaacccccooooo.”
time that day. He couldn’t stop thinking about Potter. Not only was he filling his waking hours, it was also haunting his dreams as well now. He just needed to forget. Forget about how Harry’s lips had felt on his. How it felt to finally, after all these years have his feelings reciprocated. Or at least he thought his feelings were reciprocated, but how could he be sure? Since he left Harry in his office that day, he hadn’t even attempted to contact, Draco.
“CRUCIO!”
The same patronus that carried the tip offs in a distorted voice so that it couldn’t be recognised. Its what had given inspiration for the codename they used for the informant – Tchaikovsky. Obviously, that was Hermione’s idea. Harry had no clue about ballet at all.
“Good. You know…you’ve changed a lot since school. Can you imagine this ever happening back then? Me and you actually having a civilised conversation. It would have been more like sharp insults followed by hexes.” Harry said tentatively. He was still unsure of how long this civility would last before Malfoy returned to his usual withdrawn Malfoy demeanour.
“Well you know what they say about love and hate…I’m sorry I kissed you yesterday I wasn’t thinking. I am a Gryffindor after all. Being reckless is kind of what we do best. I’m sorry if I made you feel uncomfortable. Now can you just leave and let me be alone with my embarrassment and humiliation?” Harry rambled.
Draco’s lips quirked upwards at that. “Hero
Pansy Parkinson hadn’t changed much since their days at Hogwarts. She’d abandoned her fixation with bedding Draco since learning that he was in fact gay and instead was now one of his best friends. Although, he would never tell her that himself, but he didn’t need to. She knew. However, she was still intent on getting her hands on any man who so much as moved but these days she had a larger agenda of not only seducing them but then using them to get what she wanted – whether that be money or a promotion. Draco would be lying however, if he didn’t admit he was always rather impressed by her cunning. She was still as loyal a friend as you could fine though and had stuck by Draco for all these years, for which he was always grateful. Even if she did irritate him beyond belief sometimes.
So we're coming to the end now. I've got a sort of epilogue planned which I'm gonna write soon. Thanks for reading and hope you liked it my loves <3
“And you…?” Draco asked quieter than before.
“What do you mean tell you how
“Well, Peterson, it must have escaped your notice but he and his Mother were found not guilty by the Wizenagamot, based on MY evidence. He is a free man to do as he pleases and I’m sure he’s not the only one who did things they regret in the war. I’m sure you would have done the same to protect your family – or would you have just let them die? Yeah I didn’t think so. The use of an unforgivable curse carries the highest form of punishment so I suggest you get out of my sight now before I have you arrested. And if I hear you have ever done anything like this again I will see to you personally.”
that Harry felt heating his whole body was staring back at him through Draco’s eyes.
“Why not? Please Draco just tell me why!” Harry grabbed onto Draco’s arm and cupping his face with his other hand to turn his face back towards him.
“Okay.” Ginny met his eyes as she said the next words. “I know there’s more to this than you’re telling me right now, but I know you will tell me when the time is right. I trust you, Harry. Please know that I’m here for you whenever you need me though. Not much you can say would shock me anyway.” She winked.
“Don’t say that. Just…don’t. You do matter. Of course you do. It was nothing to do with you, Harry. I just needed to think. That’s why I didn’t contact you again. I needed some time away so I could try and think clearly, without distraction. And…” Draco cut off there. Looking back down at the floor wanting to say anything else in the world than what he was about to, but knowing that he had to. “And, I don’t think we should let that happen again. I don’t think we should pursue this, whatever this is. It would be a mistake, another mistake to add on to the list that I already have to my name. I don’t want you to get hurt, Harry. Please understand though, that you did nothing wrong.
“What” Harry blustered as images of what Malfoy would look like in bed flashed across Harrys mind making a blush spread across his cheeks. “I’m not trying to get into your bed Malfoy I’m just trying to help you, you twit.”
“I don’t know who you mean by
“You really hurt me for a while there you know.”
“Doesn’t being noble all the time ever get tiring? No wonder you look so tired all the time” Draco remarked with a hint of amusement in his voice.
What they needed was someone on the inside, especially now since Snape was no longer alive. Someone who could provide them with the intel they needed to track his movements and to infiltrate the Death Eaters so completely that they might be able to take them down from the inside. What they had not predicted was that this person would come to them in just a matter of weeks.
Draco met Harry’s eyes at that and for a moment his grey moon like eyes looked into Harry’s which glimmered like emeralds in the sunlight passing through the window. It caused Draco’s stomach to flip and he knew the reason why it did but he had pushed that truth to the back of his mind. Forced it to lie there in denial in the hope that the feeling would die but it never did. Every time he looked at Harry it would always come back despite his efforts to shut away his feelings. Harry was the only one that could make his Malfoy mask that he had perfected over the years slip off and he hated him for it. Hate as many know however, is very similar to love. Draco had come to this realisation in his years at Hogwarts when he would stare over at the Gryffindor table in the hopes of catching those green eyes looking back at him with anything other than contempt. They never did though. Or the times when the weaslette would sit next to Harry or even worse when they started dating and his heart would feel like a caged beast, growling and poisoning his bloodstream with jealousy which would put him in a foul mood for most of his waking hours. Much to his friends, Pansy and Blaise’s despair. A sulking Malfoy was the most irritating and difficult to deal with. He wanted Harry to be his but knew he would never have him and it made him push the feelings away in an attempt to convince himself that he hated the boy who lived and his friends who got to spend all their time with him when they didn’t even know how lucky they were. That night he had seen him at Malfoy Manor was one that would stay with him forever. The threat of Harry being killed right there and then caused him so strong a burst of despair that he thought he might have died himself. Bringing himself back to his senses, Draco forced himself to look away from Harry.
“You didn’t do anything wrong, Harry.” Draco answered solemnly after a pause, not meeting Harry’s eyes.
- Yeah, it felt like a right thing to do. That’s what something like me should be treated, right? – All of a sudden Harry had a flashback to Draco correcting him when he referred to himself as “what” instead of “who”. It all clicked into place.
- You look like a Greek God, you know that? – He whispered into Draco’s ear.
‘Malfoy.’ Harry spat, looking up at a tall, blond figure leaning against the doorframe leading to the kitchen. He had to admit, the Auror position suited the Slytherin – he was still thin and somehow ethereal, but a couple of years on the job clearly caused him to develop some muscles, because even under his uniform robes it was clear he wasn’t just skinny like he used to be. This impression only got confirmed when Malfoy moved to push his hair, now reaching his shoulder blades, out of his face – the sleeve rolled back, revealing that the blonde, must’ve indeed gotten stronger.
‘NEVILLE?!’ Harry thought he was going to faint. This cannot be happening, this has to be a bad dream… ‘But… but how?’
(See the end of the chapter for
When they reached Madame Malkin’s Draco loosened a little. The store was empty so there were no prying eyes disturbing them – at least not until the door opened and Dean Thomas entered, holding hands with none other than Ginny Wesley.
- Yeah, that’s why I’m worried. Is he always like that? I mean, we’ve had our differences in the past, you know that, but I haven’t seen him that furious and threatening before.
‘Why would you hate yourself?’
‘What happened now?’ Harry wondered what got Ron so riled up – he loved his job, so whatever pushed him to even consider quitting must have been something major.
- You know, parlours, call houses, whatever you want to call them. – Mina saw Draco’s confused expressions. – Brothels.
- “Drug addict”? – Draco didn’t understand.
- So, by all means of logic, it must be normal to want to not be for a while. I’m not talking about someone controlling you all the time. It’s just in certain situations. From what I can tell, you’re just overwhelmed with all the crap that fell on you and that’s what triggered a rather massive sub response.
On his side of the (still open) door Malfoy looked like someone just hit him in the face with a Bludger. What in the name of Salazar was Potter on about? What does his arse have to do with anything? And since when was Potter even paying attention to its size?!
- I took it, I don’t think about anything right now. It’s good.
- Can you turn that light off? – He asked Malfoy, looking at his wand glowing over the book.
‘You? Maybe nothing, I don’t know.’ He hesitated. ‘Me? A lot.’
- Like I told you: toss off. There is nothing, and there will be nothing between me and him.
- Oh, I see. I suppose there isn’t much I can do besides just being myself. But how do I act with clients?
‘But, sir, how can you… he’s a Death Eater!’
- Don’t… Please, don’t…
‘What?’ Potter looked surprised.
‘Where is it?’
‘I do.’ Draco was looking at the floor.
‘Draco?’ His father was a shadow of a man: he looked worse than when he came back from his previous sentence – worse than Draco ever did, even after his exile in Scotland.
‘So you don’t know? Interesting indeed… Weird coincidence, don’t you think? The first night in five years you’re not here and your best friend finds Longbottom dead on your carpet…’
- You want more baby? Just say it. – Draco couldn’t restrain himself from sprinkling a little of his order-giving into it.
now?’
‘Yes.’
- “Incautious”. God, you’re dramatic… - Harry laughed out loud this time. Soon, Draco joined him. Maybe McGonagall was up to something when she decided to assign them to the same room?
- You’re not a freak. It’s just who you are. If you were a freak, what would that make me? – Draco whispered. – I’d be a freak too. Most likely regarded by other people as a sadistic one at that.
‘I have practiced
‘No, I didn’t. I really am innocent this time around, but what if they say I was a part of it? Fuck, I was so focused on actually finding the guys that I never even considered what they might actually do. Or say.’
‘Tell yourself whatever you want. But yes, that was somehow helpful.’
‘Well, yes. He did get you involved in his work while you were a suspect, so that might be seen as conspiring – depending on how you look at it of course.’
‘So the Dark Mark is protecting my soul right now?’
- Yes... – That’s all Harry could manage through the tears.
- What happened between you two anyway?
Yasmine was on point tonight dressed in dark green lingerie (Slytherin green, Draco thought bitterly) and high heels, her long hair straightened and flowing down her back like liquid silver, makeup impeccable. The only thing that could potentially seem out of place was a long strip of emerald silk wrapped carefully around her left forearm, concealing what was the only link between her and Draco Malfoy. No amount of skill in self-transfiguration and glamour charms could hide the Dark Mark, the dark magic used to brand him was too strong, so Draco had to resort to Muggle means of disguise. At first he was scared his clients would want to know what’s under the fabric, but he soon learned that none of them really cared – Yasmine quickly learned how to distract them from it.
Twenty minutes later they were sitting on the floor of Harry’s living room. Draco and Ron were glaring at each other, a small bottle of Veritaserum, almost empty, tossed on the floor between them.
It was. It always was just about her.
- And unfortunately for you, your objections to my “idea” can accomplish nothing but me observing your interactions with Mr. Malfoy even more closely. Besides, it has been a week already and I am pleased to notice, neither of you have ended up in the Hospital Wing, so that serves to prove my, as you so elegantly put it, “idea” appears to have been a rather correct one.
‘God, you’re sick.’ Potter spat and stood up.
- I think so. Now, if you’ll excuse me I’m sorry, but I have to start getting ready for work. Don’t rush into things just yet, Draco, think it over before you start acting, ok?
‘It doesn’t matter if it was properly used or not, my father will probably think it was illegal anyway.’ Draco smiled. ‘As long as it has been used and he knows it, he’ll believe me.’
- Wow, first morning together and you’re already abandoning me? That was cold Harry… - he feigned wiping away a tear.
- Sorry for what baby?
‘Wow, are you complimenting me right now?’ Harry registered that sober Malfoy would’ve never smiled when he said that. So, he concluded, the blonde must be as drunk as he is. ‘And how on Earth do you know what a twink is? You said you weren’t gay.’
‘I don’t know, I don’t remember. It wasn’t important enough.’ That was a blatant lie and Harry was just hoping that nobody would catch on.
- Would you do that for me though?
A week after his conversation with Ron, Harry decided he needed to talk to Draco and offer him help. He came to a conclusion that the best course of action was to give Draco keys to Grimmauld Place, since it wasn’t being used anyway, and a small position in the Auror office – he needed an assistant anyway, and if Draco was willing to come back and reinvent himself, his perspective might be useful.
‘Give me that report on the last scheme.’
‘I was a whore.’ Veritaserum wouldn’t take silence, so Draco had to say the truth before he would suffocate to death. ‘A
- I didn’t need to. – Somehow Harry managed to gain control of himself and speak calmly. – Whatever is attached to you, is part of you or even next to you is as far from “fine” as it can possibly get.
- No, Harry, we can’t. You know as well as I do this will happen again. I cannot control myself around you and I’m going to end up hurting you again. Harry, baby, love… I’m sorry, so sorry, but we can’t do this. I love you too much to risk hurting you like that again. You deserve to be safe, I swore to do it, and I failed.
‘Do you really? It’s the middle of the night and we’re talking about us having sex. And you’re under no obligation to talk to me right now.’
- Oh, she might have inherited some of her father’s money! – Draco exclaimed. – She’s a Black, they were loaded and she had 2 sisters, so it might still add up to something!
The world was a whirlwind. Malfoy’s lips were on his, he was being pressed into the other man’s body, his own hands running through Malfoy’s hair. It felt like silk, Harry thought vaguely, before he felt Draco’s lips move down onto his neck, sucking at his pulse point. Harry threw back his head and moaned. It seemed to break whatever spell they’ve fallen under, because suddenly there was a cold breeze pricking Harry’s neck and Draco was sitting opposite him again.
‘That would be the logical conclusion. Yes, Potter, I’m gay. Now, will you tell me or not?’
- No mate, I’m sorry, but I can’t support that. I’m ok with you being gay, even if I wanted you and Ginny to end up together, but this I can’t stand by. Not only is this whole submissive thing bloody twisted, but with Malfoy of all people?!
‘But… but would opening it kill you? Or did he mean that he would?’
‘Well, I’ve been wanting to look into becoming a healer. You know, I liked Potions and it seems like it would be a good thing for me.’ Draco still didn’t look up at anyone and Harry was understanding less and less from the supposed connection between Lucius acting like an arsehole and Draco wanting to work at St. Mungo’s. ‘But to do that you have to go through a two-year training and from what I’ve been told, the pay is ridiculous. You would have to basically carry me through for two years, I wouldn’t even be able to make a liveable wage for one person, not even with the extra hours they offer. Not to mention, there is no way I would be able to make a meaningful contribution for the both of us. I mean, it was an option when I had that vault at Gringotts’s, but now that it’s gone…’
‘Excuse me, miss, have you perhaps heard about the Auror Office?’ It was his standard opening line designed to identify witches and wizards.
- Harry, baby, I think we need to talk… - his voice was so quiet it was barely audible.
‘You think the victims are preselected?’
- What about? What’s wrong? Did I say something? You really don’t need to worry about my friends, they really won’t sell us out…
‘Seriously, Ginny? You’re going against me on this? I thought after all the things you and… After all that went on, you’d be supporting me!’ Dean was shocked.
- Not necessarily. It doesn’t have to be strictly a sex thing, but it can.
In the common room, three ex-Gryffindors sitting by the fire were suddenly torn out of their conversation by an agonizing scream that came from behind Zabini’s and Nott’s bedroom. They looked up just as a deafening, wailing “HAAAAARRYYYYY!!!” tore through the night air.
- You wouldn’t… - Draco was never this afraid in his whole life. Would Potter really out him? He tried to decipher the other man’s expression, but Harry only put his clothes on and shut the door behind him.
- How are you feeling? Talk to me. – Now that Draco’s lust has subsided (even though he was still hard, almost painfully so) he could focus on what Harry felt.
‘That is it, I’m quitting!’ He huffed sitting down. ‘I am quitting and there is no changing my mind!’
‘He always was, Longbottom, it’s…’ whatever Draco wanted to say next was cut off by one of the healers.
‘No, I didn’t. I’m trying to get rid of this picture from my brain. I told him I thought there was something between you two but that it was just intuition.’
‘It’s not like it was just out of nowhere one day…’ Potter’s voice trailed off.
‘Oh, I see.’ Narcissa was nodding her head. ‘So it’s just their job to go and clean people’s houses? That doesn’t sound too hard to do…’
‘Draco, you’re supposed to measure EVERYTHING, including water!’
- Actually… - Harry hesitated. – It’s not all there is to it. I mean, of course I don’t want to make you wait too long, but aside from that, I came to a conclusion that I want this for myself.
‘Do you confirm that you are in fact the person who is set to be questioned today?’ Shacklebolt addressed Draco.
And I'm sorry, but I just couldn't resist writing a little jab about You-Know-Who's nose, all the memes are too funny to just leave it out :D
‘That I had a drug habit. That I was a whore – frankly, both female and male…’
- I don’t know. I have better things to do with my time and intellectual capacity to pay attention to you lot. – He should know better than to insult the only people who still talked to him, he noted.
‘I know you didn’t. Only my mother knew.’
year, common room on the 3
‘You can’t, I told you. He’s on the other side of the hospital and they’re still working on him.’
‘I opened the door and… and I…’ He didn’t know how to put what he felt into words. ‘The room was calling me, sort of. I thought I had to go inside to…’
- What do you mean? Are you going to end this right now? I’ll understand that, I mean it would be logical if you didn’t want to…
‘Go ahead.’ Kingsley nodded. Draco was visibly scared. He groaned in pain when the thin, silver strand of his memories connected to the tip of Ron’s wand. It seemed to take forever, like Ron was doing this on purpose, to cause as much pain as he could – and by the look on Draco’s face he was succeeding. By the end, Draco had tears in his eyes and was biting his lip not to scream.
1980?
, but you will not be permitted to leave your residence alone for any purpose. That would also effectively mean that Mr. Potter would have to remain on
- Excuse me, sir… - oh God, how humiliating this was!
‘Please, even your limited brain must have registered what I said on your own kitchen floor.’
What Draco didn’t feel, however, was the thin strip of silk that was so carefully wrapped around his Dark Mark, snagging on one of the nails that kept the curtains in place, and coming undone, slipping down his arm. His hands were still behind his head, his Dark Mark on full display. Before he could react, Potter saw it.
‘We’ve already amended the agenda for today, Mr. Potter, so we will be proceeding according to the one that includes your request.’
It was only Saturday night that Draco was able to emerge from this thoughts enough to talk to his friends. They were all sitting in an otherwise empty common room.
‘No. Forget it. Think of literally anything else!’
‘So they’re just filling him up to his eyeballs with whatever?!’ Draco was screaming. ‘He’s not a lab rat!’
‘How can you… I don’t deserve… I’m… What I did…’
‘Actually, Minister…’ Harry interrupted. ‘I think it would be best if you go with Ron and Neville and I’ll stay with Draco here.’
‘Go ahead, Weasley, ask your questions.’ Draco was determined to get this resolved.
- Well… - Hermione spoke hesitantly. – If he has enough privileges to still send letters, it’s really all he needs…
- Am I wrong? Am I? Tell me Hermione, do you honestly believe it’s humanely possible for Malfoy to “take care” of Harry? He’s as evil as they come! Not to mention stupid! And Harry, you should know better than that! Last year you won the war, not to mention you DIED in the process, and now you want an ex-Death Eater to control your life?! Are you completely INSANE?! – Ron was screaming and all Harry could do at this point was to hope nobody overheard. He scolded himself for not casting Muffliato at the door. He should’ve known Ron would go off like that.
He knew there was lust, but his other reactions didn’t fit into it at all. On the second inhale the loops his thoughts were going in straightened slightly and he began to see things more clearly. One more and he’ll be there. He closed is eyes and focused on the smoke filling his lungs. So, his wanking session in the shower not only pushed any potential erections away, but it must have diminished the lust ever so slightly, so that the need to have someone there for him was starting to resurface. That must be it, the lust was not part of the loneliness, it was just masking it. And now that he has at least partially taken care of it, the more human needs were coming back again. And that he couldn’t have happen. If the physical needs were hard to bear, the loneliness would kill him. He had a taste of it the last time when he exploded and screamed at that random couple, if it came back even stronger than that, his soul would be torn in half. So, he concluded, it was better to just leave the lust unfulfilled for now, and try to figure this all out once he was out of Potter’s apartment.
’ Draco glared at Harry with mock disgust. ‘I should’ve known you two would gang up on me!’
So what? Yasmine was and that was all that counted.
‘What did?’
Draco was absolutely terrified. He didn’t even remember how on Earth he got back to Mina’s apartment and into the shower. If Potter decided to go to the Daily Prophet with his story, he wouldn’t even need any proof – he was The Chosen One, nobody dared to question what he said. And besides, the vultures at the Prophet weren’t exactly going out of their way to corroborate stories like that. And if it ever came out what Draco has become, it would be over. He might be reduced to selling himself for money, but the Malfoy name still had to be upheld, it was just how he was brought up. Even his parents walked out of the Ministry to be escorted to Azkaban with their heads held high. He couldn’t let it happen. He needed a plan however, and that he was in no shape to achieve right now.
(See the end of the chapter for
‘And why exactly do you care?’ He reached for the bottle, but Potter caught his wrist – the skin underneath Potter’s fingers burned.
- And you telling me that is going to have a different effect? – Nott raised his eyebrows.
‘You said it yourself, people are stupid.’ Potter remarked.
- And you shouldn’t be! Merlin, what kind of perverted arrangement would that be?
, Potter. We’re talking about your ridiculous notion that I’m into you. Which is not true, by the way.’ If Harry was sober, he might have been able to understand what that weird undertone in Draco’s voice was, but as of right now, his brain was swimming in too much alcohol to manage that task.
‘What is it?’ Draco was curious to know what Potter really wanted to say.
‘I’ve been better.’ Draco shrugged, clearly not wanting Harry to know how he really felt.
about me looking for help with the case. We both used to do it back in the office.’
‘Well, I overheard him talking to Neville. About you. He said that it doesn’t surprise him you’re hiding and that his father said that you would never have a place in the office. So I asked him what was he getting at, you know, to call out his crap, but he just laughed.’
- OH RON! – Hermione was crying and throwing her arms around her boyfriend’s neck. – You don’t have an emotional range of a teaspoon! – Both Harry and Draco started laughing.
- Baby, that’s no good, you can’t go on like that! You’ll get mugged or worse! Come with me, I’ll let you crash at my place until you find something for yourself. Like I said, I work nights, but it’s not from home so you won’t have to deal with that.
‘So what, you’re suggesting that he lied to me?’
- Who, not what. – Draco softened. He couldn’t bear Harry still referring to himself as “what”, even if he was bracing himself for being inevitably rejected. – You need to stop doing that, it only reinforces your idea that there is something wrong with you. Once again, there isn’t.
‘More or less. Ironic, isn’t it?’ Hermione smiled a little. ‘But it does pose a threat. It won’t work indefinitely, there is a limited, well, supply, of dark magic within you, so when it runs out you’ll be exposed to what should’ve happened in the first place. Once the Dark Mark is gone, you’ll start bleeding normally and that is when we have a serious problem.’
- “Someone”, not “something”, Draco. – He looked at the Slytherin with a small smile. – I didn’t know how much exactly you blamed yourself for all of this. I thought you just felt bad for hurting me with… well, at the end. I never knew you felt guilty for the whole thing. You shouldn’t. I told you I wanted this and that’s why we did this. If you forced me to do this it would be a completely different story, but you acted on what I said I wanted.
‘Mr. Longbottom and Mr. Weasley have uncovered what might be a secret room, we don’t know for sure yet, in one of the ex-Death Eater’s houses. Problem is, we do not know how to open it or what’s inside.’
‘What exactly…’ Ron started.
want to move out. Even if all the unspoken things between them were weighing on Draco like a block of iron, at least he could glance at Harry every so often and pretend he had a chance with him. Once he was gone, there was nothing that would be connecting them anymore, because if Draco knew one thing for sure, it was that, no matter how much he would like for Potter’s offer to still be on the table, there was no chance it would be. Not after what happened between them the night of his acquittal. He sighed. Once again, life has gave him one single second of pure, undisturbed happiness, and snatched it back before he could even try to thaw that solid block of ice that occupied his chest for years now.
‘I fail to see how this is connected to the secret storage…’
But thinking of Ron, in whatever way, only reinforced Harry’s belief that it was completely his best friend’s fault that he was lying there, awake, dissecting his own sexual preferences, when there was no need for it. And that made him angry – at himself, at Ron, at Malfoy somehow. How many more bloody sleepless nights was he going to have until this whole ordeal was over? He sighed and got up. Anger was still bubbling in him, but there was nothing he could think of that would help. He was still tipsy from all the whisky, so he decided to go make himself a cup of coffee to hopefully sober up and figure this out.
- I’m not stupid! – Ron was yelling at her. – Of course I tried it! I don’t know what the bloody hell he casted there, but I don’t know how to break through! Just as well if you ask me, I don’t have any desire to talk to him. Not after everything that’s happened.
‘What razor?’ Neville pressed his hands to his mouth. ‘Oh God, I’m sorry, I forgot about the Veritaserum… Don’t answer that!’
- Well, I, for one, have no idea what are you talking about. – Ron looked sceptical. – Do you mean to tell me that you want Malfoy to tell you what to do?
‘No. He only said that if I ever tried to open it without his permission, I’ll be dead.’
‘You love me, remember? I’m irresistible and you can’t live without me! And so far, you’re yet to poison me, so I suppose it suits you.’ Harry grinned.
‘You say? What do I do now, then?’
‘Look at you being all
‘That’s genius! So there’s no need for whisks and bowls?’ Narcissa’s eyes widened. ‘Do they have more things like this?’
Nevertheless, he knew what he had to do. Armed with a list of potions that might prove useful in his current state copied from Malfoy’s book, he carefully returned the manual to its (hopefully) original position and decided that he had to stop by the Apothecary in Hogsmeade on Saturday. It was almost sunrise when he finally managed to get some sleep.
he reminded himself and got up.
‘Am I what?’
It was true – after the war, Harry has all but locked himself inside Grimmauld Place and refused any job that has been offered to him, deciding instead to live off of the contents of his Gringotts’s vault until he figured out what to do with his life. At first everyone seemed to be fine with it, but as the time passed, his friends began worrying about him, as he insisted on keeping to himself as much as possible – so much so, that they’ve even stopped inviting him to nights out, because they knew he’d refuse. Three years after the war only Ron and Hermione visited him regularly – Neville popped in from time to time to check on him, and Mr. and Mrs. Weasley tried to drag him out to the Burrow for family celebrations, but other than them, Harry practically lost contact with the wizarding community.
- Oh, of course, because the world revolves around your sun-sized arse! – Where the bloody hell did the arse comment came from?! He really needs to restrain himself sometimes.
‘Now, calm down. Drink and when you wake up I’ll send Healer Harris to talk to you.’ She practically forced the potion down his throat.
‘Did you hex him or use any tricks on him?’
‘Yes, sir.’ Harry breathed. Out of the corner of his eye, he saw Ron in total disbelief.
He groaned and lit another cigarette. The pack was half-empty already, despite Potter throwing it at him hours before. When he first suggested Draco tried tobacco to slow his, permanently racing, mind down the day before, Malfoy only scoffed. How would some mundane, Muggle plant help him? But it did seem to work and now he was hooked. Maybe it wasn’t as good as his herbs, maybe it didn’t empty his mind completely, but at least while the smoke filled his lungs he was able to focus on one thing at a time.
- Harry? – Zabini raised his brows.
‘Anything you want.’
‘No. My turn – why do you have a problem with me working in your office?’
- Wait, you blacked out from pain and still wanted more? – Ron was staring at Draco like he was crazy. – Jesus, Malfoy, you’re the most masochistic person I know…
- Well, we’ll see how tonight goes, beautiful. – Potter pulled Draco closer and ran his hands down his back. All Draco could think about was alarm bells going off in his brain. Through the panic he decided he needed to get this whole ordeal done as soon as possible. He leaned in for a kiss and unzipped Harry’s trousers.
‘Interesting, Mr. Potter… I’ve been a part of this court for several years now and I have never heard an Auror say he believes his own suspect is innocent.’
- Stay. – It sounded like an emotionless instruction, but Harry knew Draco only wanted him to feel good. – I want to know how you taste baby.
- Actually, guys, I think you’re wrong… - Pansy spoke for the first time in a while. – I’ve seen him react like that once.
‘I’m apparently back from the dead, I can move out now.’ He said quietly to Harry.
dark magic. And on top of that from what you’ve told us, it looks like even that has been tweaked by Voldemort, so I’m not sure if I’m correct, but this is the only thing that fits.’
Upon entering the living room he saw that Malfoy was already (or still?) up, but he decided the best course of action was to ignore him – he didn’t want to say anything about last night and he sure as hell didn’t want anything else to happen between them right now. He made himself a cup of black coffee, threw four teaspoons of sugar in it and took a sip. It was atrocious – since when did he drink black coffee anyway? And since when did he use sugar at all? Somehow, irrationally, his anger at Malfoy grew. Before he could figure out where it came from, however, or before he even sobered up enough to address the question, there was a metallic jiggle at the door and Ron came into the apartment.
‘I’m afraid it’s our only option. It was your family home, and if anyone is going to know what’s hidden there, it’s Lucius. And depending on what he tells you we might be able to determine who besides him knew. But you would have to do it alone – none of us can be seen with you if he is to trust you. We would be listening to the conversation from a different place.’
- I couldn’t. It’s impenetrable. It won’t open, it doesn’t make any sound when you knock and if you try and yell through, everything you say bounces back and hits you in the face. It hurts, you know?
‘Well, that is a concern, I have to admit it. In that case, Mr. Potter, you’ll be the one responsible. You live alone, am I correct?’
- Ugh, shame. It would be useful to know what he did. You know, for academic purposes. – Somehow he wasn’t ready to tell Pansy the whole truth yet.
‘The cherries.’
- Don’t you dare… - Harry wasn’t sure how it was possible, but Draco was even paler than usual as he stood up addressing Dean.
- Not enough.
It was already past midnight. His excursion to the Hogsmeade Apothecary was a success and Harry was – for the first time since the Battle of Hogwarts – peacefully lying in his bed thinking about nothing, when a loud “BANG!” of opening doors brought him back from his blissful state of haze. He registered (not without some difficulty) that Malfoy had come back to the room from wherever he’s been all Saturday. Harry didn’t care. His brain was floating through the vast plains of literally nothing and although he didn’t quite manage to fall asleep yet, for once he was not accompanied by the distraction of neither the outside world, nor his own disturbing thoughts. So what if he was a freak? So what if the wizarding community placed their trust in the worst person for the job? It didn’t matter now. Somehow, the concoction of potions he took 2 hours before made it all right – like nothing mattered anymore, but in a good way. Harry couldn’t explain this, but it felt right.
- How are you even still conscious?! Hell, how are you even still alive?!
It did hurt. Draco had no idea how much time has passed since he opened that door in his room or even where he was – all he was able to focus on was that his whole body hurt like never before. Getting branded with a Dark Mark, withdrawal symptoms, getting
- Trouble in paradise already? – Harry couldn’t figure out if Dean was joking or mocking him.
(See the end of the chapter for
- took them out again –
He stood up, threw one last icy glare towards his fellow ex-Slytherins and stormed off towards his bedroom. He was fuming. How the hell could they believe he had feelings for Potter?! He despised him. The bloody hero took away all he cherished in his life. He blasted the door open and stopped dead in his tracks. The scene he witnessed inside was definitely not what he had expected…
‘What do I do?’ Potter kneeled beside him.
But this time, it was Harry who was battling sleepless nights. The longer they went on ignoring each other, the less Harry was confused with his own sexuality and with the fact that he was now apparently developing a crush on Malfoy – because that was the conclusion he reached some week into their spat – and the more he felt rejected and alone. Malfoy didn’t want him, he said so himself, and even if Harry hoped, on some level, that he didn’t mean it, his insistence to not even utter a single word towards Harry proved that that hope was way too far-fetched. So Harry closed off again, surrounding himself with a thick wall of stubborn grief over something he never had (it felt almost the same as over a year ago, when he thought Draco was dead), admiring the blonde from far away, like a treasure he would never be able to even come close to, let alone actually have. He would be fine with it, really, if it wasn’t for the memory of their one and only kiss that felt like a thorn in his side, burning and digging deeper and deeper into his body and soul any time he tried to take a breath. That one kiss was all Harry’s own brain needed to have to torture him endlessly, night after night, when he laid there, on his bed, staring at the ceiling, desperately trying to block the faint scent of who was there before him, from causing him to cry. He was over it all at this point: he cried, he drank, he briefly contemplated killing himself, but decided it wasn’t wort it – not for his sake, but for Draco’s, because if he was to be found dead in an apartment the two of them shared, Draco would have no way to prove it was a suicide. No, he needed to do something, anything, to break out of this, because if he was going to go on like this, nothing good could come out of it.
‘It would make sense if not for that last one.’ Draco was sceptical. ‘Let’s assume you’re right – now, they come to Scotland, find that old lady. They wait some time and while they’re waiting they see me and they come up with the idea that I’m all the proof they need. But they still don’t know if the woman is a witch…’
‘Basically.’
Because it made him go back to his own memories.
- pushed them back again –
Draco moaned at the request. There was no time for subtlety, they wanted each other right then and there – before Harry could even register what was going on, his jeans and underwear were on the floor and he was bracing himself against the windowsill, Draco behind his back muttering a lubrication spell. He felt those long, elegant fingers sliding along his slit with the faintest touch, but he couldn’t wait anymore. He pushed back against Draco’s hand and heard him chuckle.
It was under the stream of hot water they really had a chance to look at each other naked for the first time and Harry instantly understood why he was coming up with all the references to Draco’s arse back in September. It looked remarkable. Harry couldn’t resist pressing his chest to his boyfriend’s back and running his hands down to his full cheeks.
‘Oh, so he actually didn’t tell you anything…’ Malfoy seemed surprised, although it was very subdued. ‘Anyway, as thankful as I am for this generous gesture, I’m completely fine where I am, so I think I’ll stay.’
- Beg for it. – He shouldn’t do it, he really shouldn’t, but lust was taking over him rapidly.
- I figured as much, thank you. But what is on this list exactly? – Draco wasn’t sure he really wanted an answer. His gut feeling told him all he had to know.
- No, I don’t have time right now. – It came out way harsher than Harry intended it to be and he made a mental note to apologize to her later. Right now, he had to find Draco’s friends and talk to them. Luckily, they were all gathering their things from a small table by the window where they usually studied together in the evenings, preparing to head out to breakfast. – Hey, guys, I wanted to talk to you if it’s ok… - Harry was scared of their reaction, but he just had to know if Draco was telling the truth when he told Harry he was a different person now.
And then there was the confession he was forced to spit out under the influence of Veritaserum – apparently, even though he didn’t realize it, he was hurt by Harry’s relationship with Malfoy. Apparently, somewhere deep inside him, he felt tossed aside and exchanged for a ‘new best friend’. Weirdly, Ron realized that the feeling wasn’t entirely new to him – it was like he had already felt this way at some point in his life, although he couldn’t quite place when or who caused it. It was only when the phrase
- I’m trying to restrain myself, believe me. Years of indoctrinated hatred towards your incautious lot don’t let go that easily.
‘Infinitely worth saving.’ Harry laughed and Draco felt some weird warmth pooling at the bottom of his stomach.
However long it took him to find Harry, it was too much wasted time for Draco. When he finally spotted him through an open door, he stopped dead in his tracks. The sight made his gut wrench – Harry laid on a bed, lifelessly, at least half a dozen healers hovering over him while Ron and Neville stood at the foot of the bed, their heads hung. The scene reminded Draco of a funeral. Seconds ticked away and he couldn’t move. He didn’t want to know how severe the situation was, he didn’t want to even think about the possibility that he might have lost his love for ever, let alone face it. Internally, he was screaming and crying, pleading with the universe to please just take him instead, but on the outside, he just stood there, rooted to the spot, like a Malfoy-shape statue. He vaguely registered one of the healers turning around to face the door and heard him say ‘Mr. Malfoy, what are you doing here?’, but he couldn’t respond. It was Ron shaking him by his shoulders that finally caused him to move. Everything was a blur, everything looked and sounded like it was muffled by a thick layer of wool – mechanically, without tearing his eyes away from Harry, Draco walked towards him. Up close the sight was too much for him to bear – he collapsed to his knees, resting his head on Harry’s bed, just looking at the love of his life lying there lifeless and paler than the sheets around him.
‘I… I don’t know! Maybe someone tricked him!’
- What the fuck is that? – There was a mixture of fear and disgust all over his face. Draco had to act quickly.
- It is. – Harry smiled and leaned in. They didn’t even hear the others’ groans while they were kissing, Draco’s hands around Harry’s waist and Harry running his fingers through the blond hair. It was too sweet and intoxicating to even pay attention to their surroundings. But they had to pull apart eventually, there were still several issues to be discussed, and not all of them could wait until they were alone.
The new school year has started, and between friends, lessons and expectations, Draco's struggling to keep himself in check.
Loose and soft. Loose and soft.
Niamh brushed his hair and dried it with a hair dryer - something Draco had never used before. She sat behind him and Draco felt especially warm and comfortable, like a cat. Eir grinned at them from the sofa.
Time seemed to stop for a moment as Lucius reached the doorframe to see his son dressed entirely in muggle fashion. Draco felt asphyxiated as his father looked him up and down. Lucius’ left eye twitched, his lip curling up in a show of disgust.
Draco was very ready to leave but he couldn’t leave without
“Where are you from? You sound funny.”
Draco scoffed, “He’s been going through an angst moment his entire life.”
A week before Hogwarts was due to start, Draco found himself sliding into Knockturn Alley. His business was secret, as were most things now. The complexity of the task his father left him was beginning to show its colours. And by Merlin was it a complicated affair.
“You don’t know this song? It’s ‘With A Little Help From My Friends’ by The Beatles! It’s a fucking classic, man!”
Sighing, Draco looked out at the rest of the classroom, watching dust particles float suspended in patches of afternoon sunlight. His eyes wandered over to the Gryffindor students as they whispered amongst each other, heads bowed in case Snape might look up from his desk.
“There is no need to call me ‘sir’, Professor.”

About a mile ahead, lying amongst the bracken a lone wizard, recently turned werewolf, was battling to stay conscious after a traumatic first transformation. Images of mossy trees and the torn ligaments of a deer’s left haunch flashed in his mind while the scent of iron, pine and new leaves jarred his senses. He jolted upright and tried to lift his arm, inducing white hot pain through his shivering body.
Draco sighed and glanced up at the ceiling, wishing he could just disappear. He was becoming very irritated by the pitiful looks his friends were giving him.
be annoyed.”
Eir didn’t move or address the lady, he sensed - quite correctly - that this woman would not welcome or appreciate any gestures he would make. He watched as Draco placed the vinyl cover down, fold up the lyric sheet and stalk towards his mother. Draco kept his head down. The two left quickly and a crack sounded shortly before the door of the store rested in it’s frame.
Eir leaned over and spiked Draco’s hair up, and they dissolved into fits of laughter. Niamh ran out of the room and returned with Eir’s beaten up instant camera, and captured the two laughing in the bathtub. As Eir smudged the dye onto his face, Niamh took another photo of the three of them. The next half an hour resulted in a dozen photos and a filthy tub.
“Draco should be proud, Cissy.”
“Why do you care so much?”
“We’ll miss you too, you idiot.”
Draco let go of a breath he hadn’t realised he was holding as Blaise and Pansy walked ahead of him.
Eir shot him a sympathetic look and squeezed his shoulder. Draco hadn’t told Eir nearly as much as he had Niamh, but he knew enough to understand what he meant.
“Well the wizarding world, by all accounts, is still stuck in the time before Industrialisation.”
“Not what you’re thinking. Just having a stressful time at home, is all.”
He ratched through his drawers, pulling a cig out from a matchbox and sticking it between his teeth and another behind his ear.
Saturday 24th August 1996
“Fucking hell, Luna.” Potter muttered beside Draco as he moved to climb into the carriage. Draco waited a moment longer before following.
Blaise laughed, “‘Cause you’re all flushed, and your hair’s messed up.”
(See the end of the chapter for
Despite their mutually awkward but respectful interaction on the train, Potter hadn’t even been able to look at Draco when he had jumped out of the carriage like the seats were on fire. He truly thought that Draco was a murderer, and the weight of it had been resting on Draco’s chest ever since. Frustrated, he swiped at his eyes before turning the corner to the common room entrance.

“Let's get you off to the GP then laddie.”
“I’m being completely serious, I am a werewolf, and I do practice magic.” Niamh and Eir seemed to sober up slightly at Draco’s grave tone.
The wizard stared at the muggle before muttering a yes and following Eir inside. The wizard ignored Eir who was trying to question him, as he looked astonished moving through the shop. The record player was blaring some tunes and the wizard interrupted Eir to ask what was playing.
Again we are the worst! Second year of uni is certainly a lot more work than anticipated, and my co-creator is also beginning mock exams for IB. Scary... Anyways, hope you enjoy this chapter from Narcissa's pov! It's very close to the original but we wanted her narrative to shine, especially considering the previous chapter. We will be returning to Draco soon though ::))))))))))
Draco opened his mouth to protest, but was cut off by Slughorn hobbling into the classroom, effectively stifling the chatter as he made his way to his desk.
Narcissa had taken him for some general school shopping; new robes, books and the like. Draco had noticed a queue outside of the Weasley Wizard Wheezes shop, and for dropout blood traitors, he had to admit that the Weasley twins were doing well for themselves. Well perhaps not traitors,
“Okay I am going to put it on your head now. Ready?”
“I have no regrets— serves you right.” He said as he stepped over Blaise’s amazed face.
Slughorn elected to ignore him. “Just marvellous! Ten points to Gryffindor, Potter!”
Later that night, he heard her sobbing in his parent’s room. Draco sat down outside the door and cried too.
“Would you like a seat Draco? You look like you’re ‘bout to fall over.”
Potter shot Draco an incredulous look, “That’s not true, I’ve just been doing a lot better this year.”
With an astonished Bellatrix Bonding them, Severus Vowed to watch over and protect Draco. Narcissa left feeling ill, but very much relieved. Her son was going to be protected.
Heavy mention of Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band album by The Beatles
Draco felt bad, using his shitty situation at home and fake addiction as cover for his lycanthropy. But, he supposed, if it wasn’t for his messed up home life, he wouldn’t have to deal with being a Dark Creature.
“I was, at the start of summer, but then things were getting to be too much…” It hurt Draco, as he spun a vague tale of his summer, to know that if he were to speak the truth, his friends would turn against him. “... so, my mother and I left to stay in some old family manor in Scotland.”
The terror dissipated from his tense shoulders and frustration set in. The bed sheets were damp and strewn around, letting the draft brush his moist skin, cooling him down from his feverish nightmare. Draco rabidly pummeled his pillow and cried his sorrow and anger into the mattress.
Niamh collected the photos and split them into three piles, before hauling Eir out of the tub and rinsing Draco’s hair. As he watched the dye wash away, Draco desperately tried to imprint this moment in his mind forever. It was going to be fourteen weeks of hell before he was going to see them again. He missed Pansy and Blaise, Draco had forgotten how much he needed them before seeing them again in Diagon Alley, but Eir and Niamh were an oasis away from the Wizarding World and the upcoming war.
During their third year, Dementors patrolled school. Draco tried not to think about the conditions in Azkaban.
“Y’alright, lad? Want a cuppa?”
To hide his embarrassment and to seem more experienced, Draco narrowed his eyes in response, “I know.” He then attempted to take a drag without spluttering. This time, he found that breathing in after quelled his instinct to cough up his lungs. He started to feel more relaxed and light-headed as the nicotine rush set in. He hated to think of the consequences if any of his friends, his family,
Now, in the pub, Niamh was still arguing the fact that

Song: Kozmic Blues by Janis Joplin
Draco’s neck cracked as his whipped to the side, and his cheek flared up a nasty red. Lucius pointed his wand at his son’s face and stood very still.
“You must listen to me!”
Eir looked at Draco earnestly, who to be frank wasn’t entirely sure what this muggle thought his issues were, but appreciated the sentiment. Usually pity or sympathy would be rebutted with a scathing comment, insult or retort, an instinct impressed upon him by his father.
“Are you going for some sort of record, Draco?” Pansy gave him an incredulous look.
. I was feeling a bit shit on the ride to school, and now Loony Lovegood’s absolutely convinced herself that
Draco flinched. He still felt sensitive to any and all attacks on his senses, and Niamh’s boom of a shout resembled a dragon’s cry.
“Yeah, I guess.” Draco grinned, blowing smoke out his nose.
The walls were bare and painted a creamy shade of white, the carpeted floor was a sickly green sort of colour, and a large window to his left let natural light filter through mesh curtains.
“Oh, I think you do. I bet it was some poor Muggle, some innocent person you couldn’t bear to look at for more than two seconds because you don’t share the same blood.”
“I’ll take that.”
(See the end of the chapter for
Potter I know you’re there.” No response. “There’s no use in hiding, I knew you were in here as soon as you performed your little acrobatics stunt over an hour ago — you’re really not that subtle.”
Narcissa had gone to get murtlap essence from her supplies, leaving Draco alone in the dining hall. She had hastily assessed his wounds and tutted at the primitive muggle medicine. A few diagnostic and healing spells later, he was feeling immensely better, but had still not said a word. Narcissa didn’t initiate any conversation either.
Draco threw open Greg’s bed curtains and whacked his arse through the duvet. A yelp escaped the lad before he replied: “Merlin’s beard Draco!
Draco listened to his friends whine about the Gryffindors for a little while longer, his heart not completely in it when he offered up his own insulting remarks. But thankfully, he was spared continuing the conversation as the food soon disappeared, and they stood up to leave.
They headed towards their usual train compartment, entertained by the various reactions to Draco’s new look on their way. He had to remind himself not to hunch his shoulders the whole time. Once inside the compartment, he slumped into a seat and folded his feet on top of the table.
Draco scoffed and dragged his bags behind him in annoyance. But it was only when Draco stood at the side of the carriage that he noticed them — great, skeletal horses of a mottled blue and black colour. Their suken, milky eyes were pinned on Draco as he swore under his breath and stumbled blindly backwards in a weird sort of jig.
“How is that? I mean, have you actually been home?”
“What in Salazar’s name is that?” Pansy leaned over to inspect the letter.
Draco shrunk as his father’s cane smacked the door frame.
couldn’t.
Blaise raised their eyebrows in disbelief. “So what, you just couldn’t be bothered to reply to us, to send just one owl, all summer?”
All of a sudden, the wizard heard a faint rumbling in the distance as the Armstrong’s family van truckled along the scarred country road. The wizard knew that this muggle was his greatest chance of getting home. So ass to the wind, he hauled his battered and blood splattered body towards the dry stone wall.
“I can’t believe I never knew who these mu- guys were.”
“Shut up.” Hermione shot back, rolling her eyes but looking amused all the same.
At the sound of his first name, something flickered in Draco’s composure, a barely audible intake of breath and the grip on Harry’s hand momentarily tightened before relaxing again and withdrawing to Draco’s side.
Draco actually had to bite his lip to stop himself from smiling too much at that. Pansy did always have his back and he would never admit it but he did value her friendship enormously at times like these.
A hint of shock crossed Malfoys face at that. “Why do you care if I get the shit beaten out of me anyway?”
Harry thought to himself. Also, there was the way he was looking at him before he had left. Draco’s face had softened and his usual Malfoy mask had slipped, allowing Harry to see an emotion there that he hadn’t expected – not anger like there was when he had pushed him away, there was sadness but underneath that still…hope?
Draco sighed to himself and balled his hands into fists, rubbing at his eyes. He wanted to see Harry so badly it was exhausting him. He needed to be strong though. This was for Harry that he was doing this. He kept repeating that to himself when he was having a particularly weak moment so that he didn’t say fuck it all and go and seek out Harry right there and then. With that thought still being repeated in his head, he went downstairs to distract himself with his potions yet again.
“Thankyou. For not being like the others. There’s still a lot of people like the Weasel that would prefer that I had been locked up in Azkaban with the key thrown away. Along with my Mother. I never really thanked you for doing what you did and giving evidence to have us cleared of charges at our trial. But it was something that neither of us will forget. We were both extremely grateful for it.” Draco said softly and with sincerity, meeting Harry’s eyes again as he finished.
Draco whipped his head up at that. Meeting Harry’s eyes for the first time in this conversation, seeing the genuine hurt behind them and never wanting to see it again. Not matter? How could he think he doesn’t matter? He is the only thing that matters.
Harry ran a hand through his hair. A nervous habit and cursed himself for being so stupid. He knew he wasn’t going to get much sleep tonight.
so he can’t be entirely to blame when he ineloquently ended up blurting out “I was an idiot.”
“What’s wrong?” Harry asked, apprehensive of the answer.
“Bloody hell,
Harry was breathing like he’d run a marathon. Memories racing through his head of the tip offs they’d received numerous times over the past few weeks – all delivered through a patronus he’d never seen before. The first couple times they had been dubious, fearing a trap. However, the intel proved to be genuine once they checked it out. The name of a town that was going to be raided; the hovel of a bar that a high-profile Death Eater secretly frequented; the name of a traitor.
” he drawled.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Touché, Potter but was that really a snort I just heard?”
“Trying to get into my bed already Potter, I am surprised.” Draco smirked.
Sooner than he would have liked, he found himself outside the Auror headquarters, his stomach doing backflips. Taking one last deep breathe he entered. It hadn’t changed much in the years since Draco had last seen it when at the ministry with his father when younger. There were still cubicles for each Auror, decorated with pictures of wanted dark wizards, some of whom he was ashamed to say he had known, maps, family photos and newspaper clippings. He made his way over to the office that had Harry’s name on it, above the words ‘Head Auror’.
Harry sighed, running a hand through his hair. He couldn’t tell Ginny. For one thing he wasn’t sure how she would even react, and also it didn’t feel right to tell her. It still felt like something Harry wanted to keep to himself for the time being. His secret. His Draco. Although, it was beginning to consume him and he didn’t know how much longer he could last keeping everything bottled up like this. He was already getting hardly any sleep and it was beginning to become all that he thought about. He hadn’t tried to contact Draco since he had left him standing alone in his office the other day, feeling like he should give him some space. Draco was all he thought about at the moment, but he didn’t want to drive him either further away by harassing him to talk to him. This was a delicate situation, and to be honest, Harry felt like he had needed some time apart as well to simply digest what had happened and think about what to do next. He wanted to see, Draco. He really did. However, he didn’t want to push him away either by coming on too strong. Deciding on a compromise, Harry finally answered her.
“No problem. Don’t get all sentimental on me though, I can’t deal with a soft Draco Malfoy as well as a pining one.” She said winking. “So what are you going to do about this all then? Please tell me you’re going to talk to him about it.”
Harry snorted. “Yeah well you can say that again.”
Harry wove his way through the crowded streets of Diagon Alley, having to stop every so often to shake hands with an admirer with a hurried greeting and bashful nod of the head. Still, seven years after the war his ‘golden boy’ image was following him around like his shadow and was one of the reasons he put off these excursions until absolutely necessary. Today was one of those necessary occasions due to Hermione’s birthday fast approaching and Harry leaving it to the last minute as usual to find her a present. It’s not through a lack of trying however. She was simply one of the hardest people to buy for. Books would have been an obvious choice but she had so many already and she had never been interested in expensive jewellery or any other typical birthday presents. No doubt Ron was having the same problem, although Harry felt sorrier for him since Hermione was his wife and so had even more pressure on him to deliver. As he rounded a corner onto a quieter path, he heard a noise to the far left of him down a narrow alleyway that sounded like muffled rough voices and a man whimpering. His instincts kicked in and he grabbed his wand from his back pocket, a habit that he still hadn’t lost despite Mad Eye’s warnings of losing a buttock in his youth, and ventured to investigate the source of the noise. It had been a while since a dark wizard attack but he was always vigilant, never completely letting down his guard. His recent years of working as an Auror meant that he was still always ready for an unexpected attack. As he walked down the seemingly deserted alleyway the sounds grew louder until he could hear they were only a few feet away around the corner.
“You just left me standing there like an idiot, wondering what I’d done wrong.”
“Stop complaining you can sit down in a second, hang on.” Harry twisted his body round in order to position Draco next to the sofa in his living room which he then immediately led down on, still looking slightly worse for wear. Harry took this opportunity to look around at his new surroundings. Draco’s house was elegantly furnished, with pale blue walls and expensive looking furniture. However, if Harry was expecting coldness he didn’t see or feel it. It had a familiar homely feel to it with comfortable decorated silver pillows and a fireplace in the middle of the room. It had Malfoy’s style but not the cold, self-important, aloof grandeur Harry had seen in Malfoy Manor. Which sparked a question in him.
“No.”
“No one deserves to be treated like that. You don’t deserve to be treated like that.” Harry looked into Draco’s silver eyes and saw an emotion there that he couldn’t quite read.
“I KNEW IT WAS HIM.” Pansy slammed her hand down on the table triumphantly, gaining a few stares from neighbouring tables.
“Shut up, Malfoy. Just because we don’t all feel the need to prune ourselves in front of the mirror for 5 hours before we leave the house.” Harry quipped back.
“NO. I don’t need your help. I had it under control okay! Stop being such a goddamn Gryffindor if you could for one second. Just go. We don’t want your golden boy image to be tarnished by people seeing you with a death eater now do we?” Malfoy snarled.
“Bloody hell Dray you were on another planet then. Please don’t tell me you’re still being an idiot” she said rolling her eyes, “Oh wait it’s you though so why would I even begin to hope for otherwise?”
They can say and write what they want, they have been since I was 11. They don’t matter. I want to be with you. If they can’t understand or except that then fuck them all.”
Harry held up a hand to stop him getting any closer to him once he was within two feet of him. “You didn’t seem to want to talk about it yesterday. In fact as I remember you seemed horrified at what had happened. So we don’t need to talk about anything. It was a mistake so let’s just drop it, okay? Now if you don’t mind, I have work to be getting on with.”
weren’t having a discussion about anything, Kilgerton. As telling you politely doesn’t seem to be getting through to your thick skull, I’m
Draco followed behind, Harry, whilst mentally scolding himself for checking out Harry’s butt as they made their way up the stairs.
“That’s right.” Draco nodded.
“Okay fine!” Draco hissed. “He…sort of…helped me out in diagon alley yesterday and then we were talking back at my place and we were getting on really well – yeah I know its shocking.” Draco answered in reply to Pansy’s look of disbelief. “…and well he…kissed me.”
At that, Hermione actually snorted which set Harry off laughing, which in turn led to Hermione joining in as well.
Draco thought to himself.
“Fine.” Harry said calmly. “When you’re ready I’ll still be here. I don’t know why you’re so scared of hurting me or what you think is going to happen…but when you’re ready to tell me and admit to yourself that you want this enough to fight for it, then you come and find me. Until then, I’ll still think of you, and I’ll still love you.” And with that, Harry left Draco standing alone in his living room, wanting nothing more than to call Harry back and say those words that he had been wanting to say for years –
Once inside Harry’s office, Draco couldn’t resist any longer and pushed Harry against the back of the door, claiming his mouth once again, feeling him smile against his lips. He knew they needed to talk though and so pulled himself reluctantly away. He hadn’t had time to mentally prepare any sort of speech and his mind had practically melted away to nothing but
“I don’t regret what happened.”
Draco pulled away first, his senses reeling with everything Harry. He could smell the scent of his aftershave, musky and fresh, with something ultimately Harry underneath. It was making his mind short circuit and kept beckoning him back like a Siren’s call. Harry was in a similar state of dishevelment, feeling Draco’s warm body against his, and the silky strands of his hair beneath his fingers where he had subconsciously let his hand linger. Neither could resist leaning back in for another chaste kiss. Before it was Harry this time that pulled away again and took a step back to stop himself from doing something incredibly embarrassing in front of his co-workers.
“I can’t do this. I just can’t.” Harry tried to say, but it came out as merely a whisper as well.
“I know. I’m so sorry, Harry. I was a coward…again. I just wanted to protect you but I realise now that I was wrong to push you away and that really I was protecting myself more. I thought it would be easier to just hide away from my past and stay away from you. I was wrong. Staying away from you was the worst thing to do – for both of us. I was afraid of other people’s reactions. Of how they would ostracise me even more for daring to corrupt their Golden Boy, and of putting you in harm’s way of the people who would inevitably set up a personal vendetta us for you being with a Death Eater.”
This was supposed to be a bit of a slow burner of a fanfiction but we'll see where it goes ;)
As if he could read Harry’s thoughts, Draco pulled his wand away from Harry and said clearly and slowly so Harry had time to react the words
“We’re engaged!” Hermione’s exclaimed, smiling widely as her face bloomed into the happiest Harry think’s he has ever seen it. Ron looked at her as she told them, his face a mirror image of Hermione’s. Happiness radiating from them both as the light from the window cast a warm light around the two of them, completing the picture.
. God’s give me strength.” She said looking up to the ceiling.
Actually that sounded almost too real to be inside his head… –
“Can I help you?” asked a woman sat outside the office, presumably Harry’s secretary.
“I’m s-s-sorry. I don’t know why I did that. I should just go…shit I…” Harry stammered. He wanted nothing more than to just sink through the floor and never have to face Draco Malfoy again.
Harry hugged Hermione and then pulled Ron into a hug as well. “I can’t wait to see the look on Molly’s face when she finds out. She’s been practically planning your wedding for the past 3 years.”
“I hate you.”
“Merlin, Potter. It was only a joke. I live a few minutes away above my potions shop. 23 Abbeydale Way, Diagon Alley.”
need to talk about it. I regret it, you regret it. That’s it. There’s nothing else to say, so just leave!” Harry kept his position with his back to Draco. Not wanting to see what his face was doing. For some reason, he couldn’t shake the feeling that he was lying. Not only to Draco but to himself.
“So are you going to tell me what’s been going on with you today?”
“Sorry!” Harry started a bit louder than he had meant to. Draco went pink for the briefest of moments before his usual pale complexion returned along with a mischievous look in his eye.
“Okay, there’s a place we can meet when we need to. We’ve been using it as a sort of half-way house if we don’t want to use the safe house. Its under a Fidelius Charm so only those who have been told the address can access it. I’m trusting you with this, Malfoy but what if Voldemort enters your mind? Are you a good enough occlumens?”
“I should have known that thinking would require all your brain power, Potter.” Draco jibed. Although harry could have sworn he caught a glint in his eye when he said it.
Draco thought to himself. Having the same internal battle with himself that he had been having for the past 3 days now. There was part of him that wanted, Harry to run out after him when he had left that day and stop him from leaving, but then there was the other part of him. The more sensible and rational side of him that knew he needed to keep away from Harry. He didn’t want to hurt him or for him to be hurt
is it?” Pansy inquired, leaning forward and resting her face in her hand, a mischievous look in her eye.
“Sounds perfect. Although it’s going to be torture having to wait all day.”
“I just…need to go. Now. Right now. I just remembered I have an important meeting at the ministry in half an hour”. And with that Harry shot up and bolted for the door, disaparating before Draco could even process what he had said.
Harry rose from his chair too and walked over to them both grinning. “Yeah it is about time! Well done mate.” Harry added, winking at Ron. He had known Ron was planning on proposing soon but didn’t know when exactly as he had kept putting it off saying he was “waiting for the perfect time.”
“We need to talk…about what happened yesterday.” Draco said, his voice quivering slightly for which he mentally cursed himself for. Standing up straighter and trying to pull himself together he had a chance to fully look at the man standing before him in front of his desk. He looked even worse than when they had seen each other last. His eyes had dark circles around them and he looked like a man who hadn’t slept properly in days. His hair was messy and looked like it hadn’t seen a comb in years, although this was, Potter he was looking at so that at least wasn’t unusual. He still hadn’t shaved and so was sporting some dark stubble along his chiselled jawline. Now he was referring to, Potter as having a
“So, what is it that has you so pre occupied today anyway? Or should I be asking
Ginny rolled her eyes before poking Harry in the arm. “Come on, Harry. Don’t play dumb with me, I know you better than almost anyone, remember?”
(See the end of the chapter for
“I think you’ve changed after the war. Just like most of us have. You’re still a prat and have the ability to irritate me beyond belief but it’s in a different way. I don’t know how it’s different but it doesn’t quite make me want to hex you to oblivion so it must be a good thing.”
Draco froze. His mind and his body felt like they were lost in time and for a minute he lost all sense of his surroundings and what was happening. All he was aware of was the feeling of soft and slightly chapped lips on his. He didn’t know how long he had been sat there like a rabbit in the headlights for but he snapped back into his senses, his defensive Malfoy demeanour came into full force and was like whiplash on Draco’s mind. He placed his hand on Harry’s chest and pushed him back. Harry looked completely mortified and was a deep shade of scarlet.
“Well go then!” Harry exclaimed.
“Okay first of all, I resent that. I do not mope for Harry Potter. And secondly, no I didn’t. I…pushed him away and accused him of kissing me out of pity.” Draco admitted hurriedly.
Ginny was the only one who knew that Harry was bi sexual. He had come out to her a few weeks after they had broken up and she had been nothing but supportive, and admittedly to Harry’s surprise at the time, hadn’t even been shocked. That was when he had realised that Ginny did in fact know him more than he even knew himself sometimes.
Harry pulled back and with one last look into Draco’s eyes and a nod, he swiftly spun round and started to retreat from the alley to help his friends and the victims still crying in the distance.
for him thank you very much.” Draco said shooting Pansy a glare that would ordinarily intimidate the most important of wizards or witches.
, before I finally have you reported for harassment.”
feel? How about how telling me how
It felt as if fear and the stench of death had ingrained themselves into the dust that permeated the air and settled like a suffocating film over everything it touched since the Battle of Hogwarts. Voldemort had disapparated with Nagini upon seeing Harry alive and breathing – a survivor of the killing curse twice over. The remaining Death Eaters had either stayed to inflict as much damage as possible to what was left of the Order or had they themselves receded to recuperate and fight another day. The battle still not over.
Back in Draco’s flat, he was still sat in the same place on the sofa. Staring into space whilst trying to think coherently but all that kept going round in his head was the same thing- how it felt to have Harry’s lips on his. The Holy Grail that he had been desiring for so long and he had just pushed him away and humiliated him. Draco let out a groan and rested his head in his hands. It’s him. It’s always been him. The one person who could get under his skin like no other but also the one person who he wanted the most out of anyone in the world…and he wasn’t going to let him just walk away after he had gained a hint of a similar feeling from him, no matter how small. He came to a conclusion…
“No, you don’t.” Ginny replied, smirking. And with that, they both said their goodbyes and dissaparated.
Yeah, that’s obviously what I must mean to you then. You don’t want to hurt me? Don’t you realise that that’s what you’re doing to me right now? Look, I don’t understand whatever this is between us anymore than you do, but there are some things that I know. I know that I think about you all the time, and that it feels like there is…like an invisible piece of string that connects me to you. Right here, by my heart. I know that I don’t regret kissing you. I know that I want to kiss you again, every day. I know that if I saw anyone else doing that I wouldn’t know what to do with myself…and I don’t know why I feel like this. Maybe I always have and for some reason it’s taken me this long to realise. I tried to stay away from you, give you some space to let you think and sort out whatever it was that you needed to. I did…but I couldn’t. I don’t know why you’re saying what you are but if it’s for some stupid bloody reason that your Slytherin head has convinced yourself is the right thing to do, then please just don’t. Just tell me the truth.
Harry sniggered. “Ferret face”
” Harry said taking a step towards Draco.
for fucks sake. It was all Harry could think of right now though. He was having an inner turmoil in those fleeting seconds that was becoming a war between his head and his heart. His head was starting to surrender, however, and feeling like this was the one thing he had wanted to do for the longest time but hadn’t realised it until now, he moved in, his head in a cloud of lust and without thinking another thought apart from how much he wanted the man in front of him, he smashed his lips against Draco’s.
Pansy smirked, “Please, like you’d be fast enough.” Voice dripping with sarcasm she eyed the pile of letters on the table, “letters from your fans and admirers, I presume?”
“So…” Harry’s voice sounded uncertain, even after Draco’s possessive display.
“I don’t want to help him. I don’t want the dark to win. Not after what he’s taken from me. It’s evil and repugnant and it feels like a nightmare that I cannot escape from. There’s no choice though. I’m doing what I have to to survive. Playing a part. I don’t take part in the killings; you have to believe me - I was trying to put out the fires as best I could. Who do you think was the one who sent the tip off about this raid in the first place, you insufferable
“I’ve got 5 galleons on Ron proposing in the next 2 months so he needs to get on with it to be honest.”
“Malfoy, how come you don’t live at the Manor anymore anyway?”
“ – Draco I’m Head Auror and took on Voldemort. I really don’t think that’s going to be a problem.”
Draco felt a wave of guilt crash over him, making him want to close the space between them and pull Harry as close to him as possible, make him know that he’d done nothing wrong. It wasn’t his fault. He was perfect. He couldn’t though. He needed to keep his space, for Harry’s sake. This was all for Harry.
“I’m going to go to the ministry today to talk to him at work. I don’t know where he lives and I thought it’s better than meeting somewhere else where people will only talk if they see us together. This way it will look like I’m just discussing something that might help the aurors out.”
Harry’s temper was now flaring as well and he couldn’t stop himself from shouting the words that seemed to so effortlessly reveal themselves in his mind – “BECAUSE I LOVE YOU.”
just go and apologise and talk to him!” Blaise had pleaded earlier that day when they had all been together in Draco’s flat, after having had to listen to Pansy talking their ears off all morning about how frustrating Draco was and what he should do about Harry for what felt like the millionth time.
The receptionist nodded and walked over to the office, knocking before she entered. She came back within 30 seconds and gestured to Draco. “You can go in now.”
“Errrgh I suppose you’re right. Potions aren’t going to brew themselves…let’s have dinner tonight?”
“I do not
.” Grunted the man. He looked to be in his mid-40’s with glasses and thinning hair. His eyes that had looked kind and warm when talking with a colleague before Draco had approached had now changed and were looking at him with a cold, hard expression. Draco was used to this reaction, however.
“Sorry for interrupting, the Minister would like to see you.” Said the receptionist.
of him. That had happened enough already in Draco’s life for him to want to hide away from the rest of the world forever, feeling like he was a bomb ready to go off and hurt all those who were around him. The mistakes of his youth looming over him constantly. Following him around like his shadow. The mark on his left forearm serving as an unwelcome reminder of what he regretted most.
“Draco Malfoy. I’m here to speak with Harry Potter on some important business that may prove useful to him.” Draco answered formally, but politely.
“Level 2. Department of Magical Law Enforcement, including the Improper Use of Magic Office, Auror Headquarters, and Wizenagamot Administration Services.” The magical voice declared.
“I told you already. Because you don’t deserve to be treated like that. And…” And what Harry thought to himself. And because seeing Malfoy in pain like that is something you never want to see again so long as you live that’s what. No. Harry shoved that thought to the back of his mind where it lay repressed but not entirely dormant.
“I’m sorry…thank you.” Draco mumbled
Draco couldn’t wait any longer, not caring about the audience they seemed to have acquired, and reached out a hand to grasp the front of Harry’s robes and capture his lips in a kiss. He was still for a couple of seconds, but that was all it took before his mind came back into gear and he kissed Draco back with equal enthusiasm. Not bothering to hide the moan that escaped his mouth before it was swallowed by Draco’s eager lips against his. Draco tilted his head to the side to allow a better angle for him to confidently run his tongue along Harry’s bottom lip before sucking on it. The kiss then became open mouthed as Harry slipped his tongue inside, tasting Draco for what felt like the first time in years. It was sloppy and perfect at the same time, the heat of their mouths intoxicating and addictive in the best way. Draco’s hand was a steady pressure on Harry’s chest, the fast but steady beating of his heart and anchor so that he didn’t just take Harry right here…in the foyer.
“And what?”
Draco answered with a stiff nod.
“Just what?” Draco said more softly, his temper falling back down now that he could see just how in turmoil Harry looked. He still didn’t know what or how to think though. Why had Harry kissed him? And why didn’t he kiss him back? This was what he had wanted since he was a teenager but he never thought that it would ever happen. Harry was straight for God’s sake. Not only that, but he hated him. He’d been his mortal enemy since Hogwarts. Although, maybe not any more…he had testified for him in his trial…and saved –
stayed there it just felt polluted. I couldn’t go in there again without remembering everything I did wrong, all the death and dark magic that occurred there. It was like it was smeared on the walls and in the air that I breathed. It stifled me and I had to leave. So I decided to move in here. It’s convenient for business anyway.”
“I can’t. He’s killed my parents in front of me. I – I have nothing to lose now. I can do more to help from inside the Death Eaters and you know it. In a way this is my penance and my only way to avenge their deaths. My Father may have deserved his fate but not my Mother. I will do this for her. Coward I may have been and probably still am – but I loved my family and I don’t believe the prejudice I used to spew when I was young and blindly following what my Father was preaching. I don’t think pure-bloods are better than Muggles or Muggle-borns. This is war and I’m finally doing the right thing. Let me help, Potter. Let me go and I won’t make you regret it. For once in your life, trust me.” Draco finished by putting his wand away and extending his hand for Harry to shake. Reminiscent of that day all those years ago when they were so young and naive to what the world would do to them and those they loved.
Draco’s eyes were shining with unshed tears as he listened to Pansy’s words, knowing how lucky he was the have her in his life. His eyes drifted to one letter in particular that rested just to the side of the others. Barely legible but familiar handwriting made up the words “I miss you. – Harry”.
“And who are you to judge me, I don’t see you having any stable relationships, unless you count seducing married men as a stable relationship.”
“Harry.” Draco nodded, snapping Harry back into reality.
Harry leant against the wall of the alleyway which led to Draco’s flat, as he tried to calm himself down by taking some deep breathes.
“Ow! Potter watch where you’re going will you I almost tripped over then you twit.” Draco hissed.
Pansy giggled. “Draco, this is me you’re talking to. Of course I haven’t. So come on then, tell me everything. Ooooh is he someone I know, is this why you’re not telling me who?”
“Well…something happened the other day with someone…and I don’t know… it’s complicated and it’s been keeping me a bit pre occupied, that’s all.” Harry knew this was not the answer, Ginny wanted but he knew it was just enough that she would be placated, at least for a while, until Harry was ready to talk.
“Why did you kiss me? Did someone put you up to it did they? I’m not just some damsel in distress Potter. I don’t need your pity or whatever that was meant to be!”
He was going to get his life back.
Draco lied.
Kilgerton shot Draco a scowl looking like he wanted to spit something else venomous before looking back at Harry, clearly seeing something in his face that made him decide better of it, storming off with a petulant huff.
“Who the fuck do you think you are? We were having a conversation here. I thought the ministry was supposed to be a Death Eater free zone now.” The man snarled.
“He – He’s a Malfoy. He deserves everything he gets. You know what him and his family were involved in. How many people died because of their spineless devotion to You Know Who.”
Draco handed over his wand for the man to place on a set of scales to inspect.
“I thought you’d be dead, Malfoy…clearly not. Instead you’re parading round with your Death Eater chums, killing innocent people. I thought you were a bigoted coward but you’re worse than that now. YOU’RE A MURDERER – “
not to notice how incredible his back muscles looked at this angle.
“Yeah we’re planning on telling everyone tonight at the meal. Hopefully she won’t spend the whole night crying but this is Mum we’re talking about.” Ron joked light-heartedly, his voice sounding a little breathless from the amount he was smiling.
“I was an idiot.” They both chuckled. The mood seemed to shift to something more serious, however, as Harry’s face sobered and he rubbed the back of his neck.
Harry simply stared back into his eyes. Noticing how they didn’t hold their usual cold distant demeanour, but instead were dancing with emotions that he couldn’t or didn’t want to read.
“Well I like it here. It feels like it’s more you than the Manor was.” Harry declared.
“Harry I’ve known you for 14 years now. I know when you’re lying.”
“Grow up.” Draco smirked
Harry once again put his arm underneath Draco’s, supporting as much of his weight as Draco allowed and with that, they walked together with some difficulty and in silence apart from a few muttered directions, to Draco’s flat.
“Very well. You may go through.” The man gestured to his right towards the lifts.
Harry still hadn’t moved and Draco didn’t know what to do. He moved closer to him and put his hand on Harry’s shoulder. “Harry.”
Draco still stood where he was looking at Harry in a way Harry had never seen him look at anyone before. And then he closed the gap between them in a matter of seconds and pressed his lips to Harry’s. It was soft and tender but desperate and full of need at the same time. Draco wrapped one of his arms around Harry’s waist and entwined his fingers in Harry’s hair, pulling him closer. Harry mimicked the actions and kissed him back. Draco flicked his tongue along Harry’s bottom lip which elicited a moan from Harry that sent Draco into a cloud of lust.  Harry parted his lips, allowing Draco entrance to explore his mouth. This was nothing like Harry had ever felt before. His heart was hammering in his chest and all he wanted was for this to never end. Draco bit down on Harry’s bottom lip and Harry almost whimpered with pleasure, feeling Draco smile against his lips in response and then pulled away, much to Harry’s bereavement. He rested his forehead against Draco’s and nuzzled his nose.
