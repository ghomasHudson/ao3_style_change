"Oh, it's nothing! Nothing your big brother can't handle."
Her name? She supposed it really didn’t matter much matter much now. Back at the hideout, it was the only thing that they could could grasp onto and call their own. The only real thing, that reminded them they were still alive, breathing...
Draco gaped. The sight infront before him...
And if the fates were still on his side,
“Ok ok...your turn.” Draco added quickly. The topic was tense, and neither seemed to willing to talk about it yet.
They were here...to save them.
Potter looked devastated at his answer. Guilt wrinkled on his tanned skin, and eyebrows furrowed. “W-why did...you say that you
And so Draco just sat there, with his head in his arms, trembling. Shallow breathing, tight chest, a racing heart, and feeling clammy. The same old routine. He was so...so tired. His body numb, and he felt strangely detached. It hurt....
Ripples flowed along the barrier like waves trashing up against the ocean side. The raven looked disheveled. His glasses missing, and eyes wide with rage. Anger. Dry lips moved, yelling something, he couldn’t hear. Potter’s fist pounded against the invisible wall, bruises forming at a frighteningly fast pace. Skin breaking, and spilling blood.
..back then?” the raven asked, trying to find some excuse for his
“Deem it as you may, Malfoy. Either way, it’s not going to change my mind.”
"Mate, is it just me or is Malfoy feeling more off than usual."
The yelling behind him was getting closer, but he couldn’t make much out of it. The buzzing of the barrier filled his head, his fingertips numb. The brope slipped further past, the tips of his finger just barely grazing the barrier.
emerald eyes, almost challenging the other.
. I mean..how hard can it possibly be to take a simple sleeping drought?”
Another hit, and violent splotches of red on the unseen wall.
” Hermione gasped.
Draco glance back over to Blaise, who shook his head. They couldn’t afford to trust them...at least not
He pockets the photo in his jacket, looking around the closed off warehouse. The two doors had been blown open, the girl undoubtedly being trapped. He takes note of the gun on the floor, not daring to dwell too much on the thought.
He should’ve knows when he’d first seen them. They’d looked familiar, and Draco wants to bash his head for not noticing it earlier. Draco and Blaise might as well have walked straight into the zombie herd themselves.
?" Potter spoke slowly walking closer to Draco as though he were hunting. Draco gulped, swallowing the spit that piled up in his mouth. Its wasn't a question, more of an order. Gave him a choice though. Either do what Potter told him to do and be in a somewhat ok situation, or resist and regret it. And Draco knew what he should do. He was slytherin. He looked for his advantage and gain. But of course, Draco wouldn't let Potter completely boss him around.
She could only hope Harry would know what to do with Malfoy.
"Listen here, Parkinson. I'm in no mood for your horseplay, so I suggest you get out of my way, before-"
And using whatever strength he had left, his legs hauled them towards to house. The house was big. It looked like an ordinary muggle house but only 3 times the size and more witch like...with chimneys and stones, and shrubbery.
Draco eyes the gryffindor suspiciously. “Same as always. You, Potter?”
“Why’s that?” Draco asked more teasingly than serious, but the redhead went on. He truly hadn’t expected his question to be answered. It was not usual of kidnappers to tell their captives of their plans, or answer their questions and yet here they were.
And Hermione does. Moves her eyes away from the disformed wood and up at the sight before him. She sees the second newcomer pulling themselves up from the vault and onto the grass, Harry close behind.
The raven came sweeping in, moving around the reach of the unfortunates, before finally reaching Draco. Harry stared down on him, with a scowl on his face. That’s when it hit him. This wasn’t his saviour. This was his captor...kidnapper and probably also the one who had put him here.
Potter sighed. "
“Yeah,” Blaiss turned to give his a wide grin. Draco returned it, turning his gaze back to the unfortunates piling up on them, “Couldn’t keep you waiting forever, now could I?”
"So how do we get him to work with us?"
, I wonder what changed?"
Ron looks at Harry with a little pity and pats his shoulder. He pulls out a chocolate frog from the dresser near his bed and gives it to Harry.
“Quit whining.”
"BUT I WAS IN HERE!!!"
He lifted his chin, crossed his arms, and gave glared at the raven defiantly. They stayed like that for a moment. Staring at each other. Challenging. Waiting to see who would give in first. Potter broke first.
Harry sighed and took in a deep breath, going over his decision one last time. He'd made his mind. He was going to get Malfoy to sleep, whether the blonde liked it or not.
he thought.
I might escape, maybe that’s fucking why?!”
room afterall."
“We should get going. It’s almost curfew,” Draco said, trying to rid himself of the uncomfortable silence.
“I’m getting you out of these ropes,” Harry interrupts him, backing away. “Get up, Blondie.”
"No, you're a big girl and big girls are allowed to get cold. I'm a big boy so I have to be strong and tough, to take care of a big girl like you. You don't have to worry about anything. Just live it up to you big brother. oK?"
. Maybe to the unfortunates to get them to spare her, or maybe to someone else out there. A survivor, that could hopefully save her. The sun was disappearing over the ocean, the last streaks of light shooting out like stars, piercing her eyes. This was it. The moment was going away.
The figure before him doesn’t smile, and he wonders if he has said the wrong thing. It doesn’t matter...it was all he could do, Draco tells himself. He cries more, begging, his mouth rambling on and on about how they didn’t want any harm. How they just wanted to live...to get past the walls and
"What did I even do?!!"
Draco stood in his room for a moment, not sure exactly what to take along with him. His wand was useless to him, and his broom now in custody of the one and only saviour of the wizarding world. The potions he’d made from earlier were poured down the drain.
Lilly giggled as if Draco had gone mad. "But, Lilly does have a family!! Draco and Lilly. Draco is all Lilly needs, and Lilly is all Draco needs. No one else. Just Draco and Lilly."
. A spell used to put a stop to simple, and small hexes. This however was no small hex. It was strong. Powerful. Meant to give the victim a torturous death. This spell, however had been broken.
His eyes rolled to the back of his head as he fell, the ground rushing up to him. It collapsed upon him with a hard grunt. The pain shooting up his shoulder, and down to the throbbing of his feet.
. He hadn’t seen this much food in so long.
He yelped, feeling himself being lifted, and placed upwards on the bed, Potter still holding him tight and snug against his chest. "I'm sorry." The words sincere, and filled with a torrents of guilt.
Draco in too deep...and it's not a good thing.
Anyways, I hope you guys liked this chapter! See a mistake? Tell me!
Draco almost winced at that. Potter had been sure to point out the
"Oh, don't be such a drama queen Draco, you didn't die."
Harry had taken his shoes. It was smart, and it ensured his captivity even without all the bindings. Going out with a pair of shoes was as good as suicide.
Too trusting, and with a heart dangling off the edge of his sleeve, just waiting. Waiting for someone to take it, and place it back in his chest, to get his blood pumping again. Only, it were as if it were invisible. It was as if Draco ceased to exist. His body just a shell of what he could have become. Snarky. Sassy. Tough, but soft. Loving, and accepting.
Potter didn’t listen instead, flipping them over, pinning his wrists in an agonizing grip. “It’s okay,” the raven whispered softly, but Draco wasn’t having it.
A carousel of broken bottles and dreams spinning round and round. A never ending cycle, but peace comes eventually. Surely, it must. Eventually, with all those shards piercing the soles of his bare feet, eventually, he shouldn’t feel anything at all.
Then take your potion, and get to sleep. I am
Draco kept his gaze away from Potter’s emerald eyes. “I’m not lying,” he tried, voice coming out more broken than convincing.
The raven ran a hand through his hair, looking unamused. "Draco, we already talked about this."
” Draco exclaimed, throwing his hands in the air. “
“Where are you going?”
With that, he made a false charge for the raven. The other prepared himself. His hands were bare, no doubt ready to use his fists. The boy seemed unfazed with the knowledge of having no weapon, and his eyes narrowed in dangerous over-confidence.
Draco didn’t want to die, but he wouldn’t risk their lives over his selfish wants to live.
"Draco is cold too.."
Emerald green met silver, and Harry flashed him a broken grin. “You know more than you let on, Blondie, so you’re going to help us.” The raven left no room for argument. It wasn’t a question..or request. It was a demand. Plain and simple...nothing more. Nothing less.
Draco let out a choked sob, feeling the crushing weight on his chest. His lip trembled, and he froze. This was it. He was going to die, and her sacrifice would be for nothing. It would be nothing but a waste.
? What ever made him this afraid?
“Yes...like-like do you get nightmares?
Lasagna.
Harry didn't reply, he didn't want to tell Malfoy about how he knew where he was. He couldn't trust Malfoy. He couldn't trust the son of a
His heart clenched, clogging up in his throat, choking his words. Potter was going to leave, and just like all the other times, it would be Draco's fault for pushing him away. For pushing away the one this he'd been longing for.
Dumbledore, however, pretends to not hear the others words at all. He puts his hands together in delight and spins around in his chair squeeling.
to get out of talking.
Draco gasped, feeling warm arms wrap themselves around his back awkwardly. The owner of the warmth dropped their head within the crook of his neck, muttering something he didn't quite hear.
Draco trembled under the harsh touch, breath escaping from his parted lips in small pants. “You know what he told me?”
Pansy however was a stuck up prat. Like him. And a drama queen. Also like him.
"I'm a big boy remember?? Big boys don't get cold!!"
Her eyes drooped a little with the mention of Harry. Oh the poor boy. Molly was glad Albus had allowed him to stay at hers this winter, rather than making him go back to his aunt and uncle. The pair had hardly fed him enough, and made him work all the time. Molly had seen the damage. It disgusted her to think how someone could be so cruel, but it wasn't like it surprised her. She's seen worse. She's been through the first war, and the memories haunt her still.
The raven sighed, adjusting his glasses a little, and stood up from the floor. Merlin, oh how Draco wished Potter had just stayed on the ground. Potter towering over him didn't exactly make him feel the most..
Panic rose within him and he moved slightly on the broom to look at her. He shook her a little. Tried to call out her name, and yet she wouldn't wake. Draco eyes widened and his breath quickened.
He remembers hearing the squelching sounds of the teeth sinking into their victim, remembers hearing the sickening crack of his mother’s skull. And he remembers so much...knows what a coward he was to run. To walk away and refuse to spare a few of his only bullets to put them out of their misery.
A stray spell hurls towards them, but Potter still doesn’t move. The raven grits his teeth, as the spell hits him in the back. His gaze doesn’t falter, those piercing emerald eyes staring into Draco’s, refusing to budge.
Fate had a bad habit of playing cruel tricks on him, and he’d be a fool to trust it so easily.
The raven was so close, and Draco swore he could hear the other’s heartbeat from where he sat, knees deep in the mud, the rain pounding down around them.
Draco promised himself. He didn't deserve it, but just this once, let him be selfish. Let him. '
A gust of magic hit Draco's head and he stumbled back. His senses dulled, and Potter's panicked voice became distant in the background. Why didn't Draco feel afraid right now? Why didn't his heart thunder, and his breath quicken?
“We don’t...have one anymore,” Draco rasps out, choking on his own spit.
Sarah no longer remained, but she left behind a gargling, convulsing child’s body. Draco had never felt more sick. He remembers.
“Please..please...stop...” he muttered, trying to press his face further into the ground, trying to block out the sound. It was horrible, disgusting.
Water. So much water. Bottles, and piles of cliff bars, with a jar of peanut butter, and
What did Potter know? He knew nothing.
Potter put a hand on his chest gaping at what Draco had just said, and gasped dramatically. “HOW DARE YOU!?!?” Draco merely shrugged. “By the way...how do you know what Diabetes is? Isn’t that a
..h-he'd tried to
Draco only glared in response. "Let me out.
Calloused hands reached out towards him, and he flinched back, yelping in fear. This was it...he was going to die..oh, he was definitely going to die. Hell, he didn't even get to apologize to his mother, and he would never get to speak another word to her, all because he was going to...
He’d left Pansy to die like this. Along and afraid, clinging to the hope that they would come to save her, and he didn’t. He left her holding onto false promises and dreams.
Draco raised his head up to look at Potter. Potter had changed, again. The once confident, smug Potter, now turned back into his clueless, and flustered self. The strong magic that had wavered smoothly around the air, now became uneven. It peaked up and went back down, cracking the windows, and shattering the chandeliers. The worst part? Draco could
Draco chuckled in response, and winced slightly as the wounds shook alongside his laughter.
“I suppose it tore us apart too,” Draco whispers to no one in particular.
------------------------------
So when that first tear broke free, the rest followed in an unbroken stream. Sobs to incoherent cries for help poured from her mouth like vomit.
Draco thought, sweeping out from the bedroom door, and down the hallway trying to find where the supplies would be.
meet. Think its better that way," he said while slowly inching up and out of the bed. "You never saw me whimpering pathetically and I never had the saviour of the world trying to kill me. Ok? ..yeah...good talk."
She let out a cry of despair, as the doors from the other side of the warehouse burst open. The unfortunates sweeping in, tongues sticking out like slobbering dogs in a heat. Stumbling on their feet, climbing on top of each other, in a race to see who could get to her first.
Gripping his bat tightly, he walked cautiously for the door. They had to be waiting for him, and he just needed one moment of shock to slip by, and escape. He took in a deep breath, letting his mouth open slightly to keep his breathing quiet.
“What do you mean
"Read the textbook, Potter. Now fucking let me out, so I can go finish my essay."
“I honestly don’t understand how you don’t like treacle tart. It’s like one of the best things this world could possibly offer.”
I'm sorry for this really late update! And I know it's really short, but I promise the next update will be longer and sooner! I hope you like it. Until next time~ <3
"Shut up," the raven grumbled rolling them over, before continuing on his sleep and Draco couldn't help but feel the tiniest bit jealous. Potter could fall asleep
“I-I..
Shit.
Draco looked down at his hands.
And quite frankly, it's starting to get on my nerves!"
Neither of them had spoken a word of the loss. They hadn’t known what to say. Didn’t know whether they were supposed to cry, or hug....or laugh. Nothing felt right. Nothing felt
lost.
did this?”
Draco choked out a broken sob, laying there curled on Potter’s bed, not really sure what to think, or feel. Wondering why he should have to feel at all. It’s be so much easier...if he couldn’t feel. If he just couldn’t feel a damn thing.
And his eyes,
Like Draco didn’t already know who that
Ron wondered if Harry was even actually as upset as he acted.
Draco flew down to the ground, trembling slightly as he got off the broom, legs shaky,a and knees buckling slightly, from the pressure. He let out a uncontrollable laugh, as Harry followed, falling onto his arse, mud covering his clothing, and palms.
"Again! They
“But you love me the same!” Harry winks playfully, and Draco doesn’t know how to explain the raven how much he actually loves him. Gods, he loves him so much..it’s almost unbearable.
“They want out, and
Harry groaned in frustration. "I wasn't stalking you for Merlin's sake!!"
All for nothing.
"Wake up." he tapped the his cheek lightly, only to be crushed back into a breathtaking hold.
Draco mentally cursed himself for being as dumb as he was now, but then again could you blame? He hasn’t had “
want a boy. Draco didn't have to tell her everything. Right?
Had he spared a bullet, his parents could have passed painlessly, but instead he was selfish. He ran away, their screams forever echoing in his mind. Sometimes Blaise wished he had his headphones back to tune out the pained sounds, but instead they opted on singing once or while when the nights got to hard.
“Six died.”
Lilly hugged him, and he slightly winced, when her hand clutched at the wound on his back. Lilly seemed to notice and pulled back instantly.
he thinks, looking up at the rising sun.
to get killed or some shit. C’mon. Get up you crybaby, or would you rather stay down here?” Hermione’s voice is cold, mechanical in a way that made her seem almost inhuman, but he can see a crack of pity through that wall.
, and Draco hadn’t realized he’d stopped breathing until his lungs began to burn, skin yearning and begging for release.
“Nope!” Draco hushed him, raising a finger up to the other’s lips to quiet him. “My question first!”
Malfoy of the other hand was now turning blue, he tried gasping, and digged his nails in his neck in an attempt to release whatever it was that was suffocating him.
Be sure to review! Reviews are always appreciated~
They came to a slow pause, and Harry crouched down, to lift a heavy concrete door off from the tunnel floors. Underneath was a pair of stairs, leading further and deeper into the ground. The cold beginning to tingle up his spine, to the soles of his feet.
“What did you mean, ‘I wouldn’t believe you?’” Potter broke the silence, voice cracking slightly.
He needed to get out of here, because if this man finds out where Draco came from, there is no doubt in his mind, that he’ll kill him. Sooner or later, he’ll find out, and Drcao just needs to find an escape before them. Until then, he needed to build a foundation of trust between the two.
want to test me, Draco. I will tie you down if I have to."
“What?”
“Yeah...well, you wouldn’t listen otherwise.” Draco huffed, crossing his arms. Inside, he was relieved that Potter had stopped crying. Gods, this boy was like a complete child.
How? No..no wand...Potter had no wand, so just how...
Draco wakes up cold.
Whatever it was, Harry didn’t like the sound of it. A panic attack...He didn't know. He didn’t know what it was. He didn’t...know. The floor opened, swallowing him with bitter guilt. It made him uneasy. He looked at his distressed friend who shook her head slightly.
The moment he figured out there was no one behind him, was when Draco truly realized just how screwed he was. Upon further inspection, he learnt that he wasn’t wet at all. There had been no water at all...no bucket...no muttering of a spell. Shocked, he whipped his head around to look at the smiling raven staring up at him innocently.
They had to run, and soon.
“But Draco darling, you already do.”
" Draco begged. He knew Potter understood. He wanted Potter gone, and Potter knew that more than anyone else.
Harry was only trying to understand. Trying to figure out what he was missing, which now it seemed was nothing. And the more he tried, the harder it got for him to push out the image of a sobbing, broken Malfoy. It was fake.
“Why indeed?” Draco asked, more to himself than to the raven that sat only a foot away from his frail, shivering form. “
Draco gulped. Should he take that risk? Should he tell them...would they really bring Blaise into this? They couldn’t....right? “I’m surprised you know that reference. S-seems like you all are not just stuck up nerds t-that have never watched Lord of the Rings afterall.”
"Potter..."
And with that the fireplace burst into sputtering puffs of smoke, taking his father’s place along with the flames. Once the smoke cleared, and Draco knew he was alone, he collapsed. Knees buckling underneath him, dragging his trembling figure to the floor.
How his body was now aching to have those tanned arms around him again. How he no longer minded the raven’s terrible fashion, but indulged in it instead.
Potter holds him tighter, letting out a pained chuckle. “It’s not that bad.”
"Where exactly do you think you're going with our slytherin prince."
"Malfoy," the voice came back.
“Me?” Draco laughed off, tugging the sleeve of his sorn up shirt further down his wrist. The concealer was still there. It’d last him only about another night, before it starts to smudge revealing the mass of black hidden underneath.
Potter frowned at that. "You deserved it, Malfoy."
“Wouldn’t trust you even if the world were to end,” Harry spoke, chuckling at his own irony.
His wand core. Unicorn hair. Designed specifically to resist dark magic, and Draco would've laughed at the irony of it, hadn't it been him choking to death a few moments prior. Unicorn's are meant to be pure, and beautiful creatures of the light side and here he was. All dark wizard and "death eater."
going to repeat myself twice."
” Potter defended sounding genuinely shocked by his words, but Draco wasn’t falling for it. He knew better.
He wanted out.
I made Harry so dark all of a sudden, but this chapter is longer than the previous ones so yeah! :D
"You're right. Oh and by the way, where is Hermione?"
“I wasn’t trying to leave.” Draco wasn’t sure why he lied again. Potter already knew, and he wondered who exactly it was he was trying to convince. The threat posed from Potter was a problem, but he’d have to find a way to get around it.
A part of him regrets it...the other justifies his actions.
He doesn’t look up. His plate is yet to be finished, and he’s eating again. The meat tasting like the screams of the man in capture. The wine tasting like the tears of the children who he’d seen break down as he took their fathers, and mothers away from them.
Draco rolls his eyes. “Yeah, well it
like that....
Please, somebody.
” Draco slurred, not really sure why he bothered saying anything at all, but he supposed it was worth it.
” Potter shrieked.
And he waits for the pain to surge through his body. An ending to this constant nightmare.
He wonders if it will hurt. He hoped it will be quick and sudden, not give him time to dwell on the moments he’s lived when it is he would die.
It was selfish, and for now Draco was more than okay with that.
“What’s up in your head, Blondie? Can’t have you going on mute on me now can I?” Carrot top spoke, startling Draco out from his thoughts.
"Why the bloody not??? You are supposed to help me!!! YOU ARE SUPPOSED TO BE A MY FRIEND!!! MY BEST FRIEND AND THIS IS HOW YOU TREAT ME!@***#&***@**!!!!!"
Mrs Weasley sighed, and put a hand on his shoulder in a comforting manner.
in this!!! Even you said they hated each other!"
"Expelliarmus!!"
"Oh, its coffee!" Drake said delightedly. The sudden mood change was strange. "Bet you don't know what that is!"
“I do not!” he snapped back, trying to push away his yearning nerved to the back of his mind. His body felt incomplete, missing something he couldn't begin to describe.
” he croaks out, voice so quiet, Harry wouldn’t have heard it if it weren’t for the pin drop silence in the chamber.
"Her name is Lilliath. Lilliath Lucius Malfoy. S-she's my sister."
used to be his captive. Cut open and rewired over and over and over again, until they became stronger than any human before them.
he thinks, clenching his fists until the nail dug into the soft of his palm, threatening to tear open, and spill.
“I’ll do it,” Draco hushes. “You let her go, or I’ll slit my throat right here, right now.”
"No-"
Draco Malfoy was scared. Hell he was terrified. And fighting for the life of the one closest to him. And his own. To make things worse, he couldn't even use magic. Draco groaned and then played his head on the bundle resting on his lap. He rested it there, and closed his eyes for a few moments.
"I don't kiss and tell, Blaise! I like to think I'm a true gentleman."
He knew he had to get out...away.

Draco rolled his eyes, cheeks turning a soft pink. “Yeah..so?”

for such a commanding voice, but then again, he supposed the apocalypse had changed all of them in some way or form.
“Why...did you get so..violent in the first place?” Draco asked.

smiling."
Draco thinks.
“I’m no–” Draco didn’t have a chance to reply, before a wet glob of mud found its way to his neck, splattering up his chin, and all the way up to his nose. He gaped, wiping the dirt from his lips with his sleeve, and swallowed in annoyance.
“Sylas,” Draco mumbled. “My name...it’s Sylas.”
He caressed her head, feeling, trying to feel, but couldn't.  His hands were too cold to feel anything. If Lilly was sick, or injured, or...worse. He didn't know.

Draco blinked, shellshocked, and still trying to catch his breath. "I'm sorry...
Draco was proud to say he was winning. He was fucking winning, and he was going to rub it in the champion’s stubborn cocky face. “Guess who’s winning, Potter? That’s right!
Potter however didn't respond to even a single one of his pleas and demands.
The tune continued.
“I see,” The raven mused. “Where’s your

"Yeah yeah...whatever! I know what it is!"
He snatches it from the pudgy hands, opening the crumples mess, feeling warmth spread across his chest. He lets his fingers trace over the figures in the photo, and looking over to the mass of unrecognizable flesh. He smiles sadly, feeling a sense of loss...failure. Knowing he hadn’t been there fast enough to save her.
"Lilliath can grow her hair, and wear dresses!! And Lilliath doesn't have to wear that stuffy, ucky suit again??"

“But why...
Cake didn't go with lasagna, but who cares.
Draco pulled the picture out from the frame, and folded it, placing it in the back pocket of his jeans. He’d hold onto it for now. Maybe he’d see this little girl someday, and then he could give it to her as a memory. Or maybe when all of this is over, he would put it up on a wall as a way to remember everyone. To make sure no survivor forgot about this young girl and her brother. So they could live on even if they were dead.
Breathing in a musky, dense scent he opened his eyes slowly flinching away as the light pierced through his sight, blinding him momentarily.
New chapter!! I know it's kinda late...very late, and I apologize for that. I thought I had updated this...but I hadn't so yeah...Hope you guys liked this chapter? Also..if you guys don't understand anything, just ask below in the comments. I'll be more than happy to clear it up.
“Survivors,” Luna cuts in.
He'd slept. He's slept for merlin's sake, and now all he wanted was to go back to that bliss. He wanted it so bad. He'd gotten a taste and now nothing seemed to matter more than that.

Its eyes were pitch black, one half gouged out dangling off sickeningly by a single thread of fibre from the sockets. Wrists, and ankles were swollen, and shredded down to bone in an attempt to escape. The unfortunate gaze bore deep into his eyes, looking for something he couldn’t make out.
Harry raises his head from bed and groans dramatically again.
Harry raised an eyebrow. “Me?”
"Lilliath is a big boy too!!"

Ron sighs. This was one of Harry's dumb rants.
Draco chewed slowly, feeling the food slide down his throat like water. Slipping past his tongue, and feeling it fall into his full stomach. It’s vulgar.
Draco twitched, his hands curling weakly into fists.
Grinning sheepishly, she turned on her heel to meet with the one and only Argus Filch, and of course the ever so loving...
Draco finally took the time to get out of his head and looked at the hazy figure of Potter, reaching out to him, saying something he couldn't hear. The magic tugged on him again, and this time Draco let himself go. His knees gave up on him, and before the ground came rushing in upon him, he let his eyes close. Falling deep into the abyss.
She crept closer, but stopped as the ringing of the doorbell stopped too.
"Shut up and let me talk! Like I was saying. I
"We had a bonding moment!!" the raven said throwing his hands up in the air. "
The way things were going, Draco knew he didn't have much of a choice, but to drink the potion, but that didn't mean that Potter knew. Draco was going to use that to his advantage. "Fine...I'll drink it and stop moving,
,” he warned. He was losing control again, and a small something told him it wouldn’t even pretty. Malfoy wouldn’t be so lucky this time.
Draco lets out a scoff. “Why are you even here?”
Oh, he’d taught her well.
The raven is curious, but it’s not for Draco...it’s for the intel that Harry knows he holds. It wouldn’t make sense for them to keep them here otherwise, wasting both water and food, even it was just barely on them.
Draco didn’t know if it would work, or not. It was a simple Probity Probe. A device that enables wizards to sense dark artifacts. And with that, it should be able to break through pure magic, if concentrated on one spot. Thus, the glass.
get along. We are on the opposite ands of the spectrum. Aren't we, Malfoy?"
can be!?! She's my god damn sister. I'd never leave her. But what would you know about that?! All slytherins and the children of Malfoy just seem like the Devils spawn to you! Like all we ever talk about is about death and how fun death is, and how we don't give a shit about our family. You probably think we eat boiled babies for breakfast. Along with the delightful cup of human blood. Oh how

"What's wrong, Malfoy? Did I scare you?" The voice came again. Not angry, more teasing. Almost

He deserves it. Of course he does.
Draco nodded, relieved with the answer. It was enough. Knowing she was going to be ok...was enough.
Draco had the golden trio have a small interrogation session that turns a tad bit violent.
-----------------------------
Laughter echoed across the empty silence, and Draco wonders if the raven is right. If all this is just one big joke, and someone would pop around the corner with a camera laughing at his pitiful state. Draco wouldn’t even be angry. He’d be so fucking grateful. He follows the raven wondering...
With a final attempt of despair, he stomped his foot down upon his captors’ foot, hoping the grip would loosen. It only tightened in return, and Draco was sure if those fingers held any tighter, his wrist would snap in two.
"You do realize that you don't have to do everything that dumbledore asks you to do right??"
“Look-”
He slowly pried the strong arms off his waist, and slythered
of him. Not to mention, Harry truly had no interest in her. Yes, she was kind, and sweet, but she just didn't have that exitement to it. That spark. He wanted someone who could match him. Someone who didn't like him because of his title. Someone who'd scold him, get angry at him, and be willing to give up everything for him. He needed a person who would challenge him every step up the way, without relenting. Someone who wouldn't be
"No buts Lilly. Papa isn't here now. We ran away, remember? I won't let him come back. ok? We will go to a safe place...where you will have friends of your own and people who love you," he looked up to the sky and smiled as the skin-seeping cold brushed through his hair. "You'll have a family, Lilly. A family."
Draco snarled at that, reaching up to snap his teeth at the raven, who only returned the anger with a sinister smirk. “You promised!
Harry and Draco have a small chat.
He did not just think of Potter during a conversation like this. He coughed, letting out a small cheeky smile. “Oh father.
. How is she?”
And yes, I know no living human being in capable of staying awake for 3 weeks, but meh. This is a fan-fiction  so it don't think it has to be acurate. The longest somebody has gone is like 17 days...I think.
“You know something.”
He twisted the captured hand and tried to pull it out of the death grip that Potter had graciously bestowed upon him. When failing to do so, he scratched at the other's hand, pinched it, even dug his nails in the flesh hard enough to see the red starting to pool up in little drops. Potter, on the other hand only tightened his hold, and continued to argue with Pansy as though Draco hadn't fazed him one bit.
Harry almost sobbed, but something choked him back, tugged at him yet again, and he felt his guts twist a little. Another pull on his thoughts and...
Draco groaned in frustration and turned yet again. When his final attempt failed as well, Draco sat up on the bed, pushed his head in his hands and shook. He wasn't sure whether it was just anger or frustration or straight out annoyance. Maybe it was all three. It was probably all three.
He follows the other out through the metal door, biting his lip with every agonizing step. The door opens, enveloping Blaise in a blanket of light, and for the first time in months, he doesn’t look back to the darkness, wondering if he was ready to accept the change he knew was to come.
“What are yo–”
Blaise looks towards the busier side of the clearing. He can see Harry talking to an older man, and the redhead he’d met earlier talking to another light haired female. He remembers her. He’d seen her before, curled up against the cool glass, arms wrapped around her head, as she rocked back and forth. A monster in the making, and here she was. Laughing, imitating the doctors and nurses she’d grown up around. Fake. An imitation. Around them there was a group of children, playing and scrambling around, emitting an artificial sense of innocence.
“Huh?” the raven stopped taking a moment to understand what Draco was getting at. “Oh, right! There’s more than one exit, of course. It’d kind dumb if it didn’t...uhh..secret passages through the walls and all.”
“They’re just like us.” Luna says, coming around to sit next to the raven.
Draco threw his head back, onto the bed, ignoring Potter's frantic words. His gaze shifted to the ceiling. It was white, simple, plain, nothing to taint it of it's bareness. Draco wished he could go back to those days. When he was bare, young, and free. Longing to be back into the days where it were just his mother and him. His mother wearing a white sundress, adorned with a tawny hat, holding his hand as they walked through the bare woods, and sooner or later Draco would jump at strange noises that would pop out from the darkness. That's when she's smile at him, and ruffle his hair, telling him it was alright. That the darkness wouldn't hurt him. That it
Blaise can hear the footsteps approaching from behind him. Knows he doesn’t have long to decide, and he’s selfish...but if he was going to die, it was okay right? He prays he’ll find Pansy in heaven, hopes that whatever was up there would forgive him for his sins.
"H-how could you accuse me of...of
But these...these experiments are no better. No, they are just the same. No different than the Third Eye, and no better. He feels his bones begin to ache and his chest tighten. He can’t give the cure to the Third Eye, but he can’t allow these monsters to get ahold of it either. They’d use it for vengeance, to create a world of anarchy and destruction.
It’d be beautiful. Coral skies, with small brushstrokes of white as though they were angel wings. A bright yellow sun, basking its warmth to her skin, and for a moment it was as though she were truly there. Breathing in the fresh ocean air, and basking in the sunlight. The ghost of a smile graced her lips, and she pressed harder on the trigger. So close.
No reply.
he was here'. If Potter could could knock him out and then carry him all the way to his room without a care about the teachers that may have witnessed the scene, he doubted that Potter would let him go to easily. Turning, he dragged his feet towards the door and twisted the doornob ready to sprint the second the door opened.
"Don't lie to me!"
She does not want a reminder of a world she knows they will never reach. She’s angry, not disposed to look for a brighter future. Prays for vengeance rather than penance. Because nothing. Nothing would allow her to forgive those who have wronged them. Used them.
“Oh quit being sarcastic, it isn’t that bad,” the raven muttered, running a hand through his hair, and Draco peeked closer to his forehead, wanting to confirm whether or not his suspicions were true. And just like that, the raven removed his hand, allowing his hair to fall onto his forehead in wisps. “Better than out there.”
Something was wrong. Something was definitely wrong, and
She would not hold out for hope. She lost such a foolish though a long time ago, and now she only wants to quench the never-ending rage that runs through her veins.
The raven scratched the back of his head, and gave a cheeky smile. “Give me a break. I did live in a closet for half my life.”
Draco swallowed, trying to ease his nerves, as he tiptoed down the hallway, sparing one last look into Lily’s room before exiting the house. If he was lucky he’d survive 2 days at the most. But that’s only if he was lucky.
The door slammed open, and Draco snapped up with wide wet eyes. Light came creeping in as the unfortunates turned their attention from him to the man before them. They were louder than ever now, clawing at each other, and screeching as though trying to communicate. Draco almost smiled at the silhouette of a man standing at the doorway.
"I can do it, Madame Promfrey! I don't mind making sure that
“Good boy,” the brunette patted his bruised cheek softly. Gods, Draco hated her already. “What’s your friends name?”
Draco looked away. “Maybe I was planning on flying a little bit too.”
Hermione gave him a look of disbelief. “You don’t know?!”
"Oh? And you aren't going to become one? Not going to follow behind your father's steps and become a mindless slave to that lord of yours? Voldemort."
It’s not long before they stop, and Draco is greeted to a small gray metal door. It isn’t before Draco notices the big bolt on the door handle, does he move back, but Harry has his wrist in an instant.
Draco thinks about his sister, taking a step back. She’ll be fine. She’s young. She’ll get over it, and he was sure the Weasley’s would take care of her. Draco was replaceable.
"Yup! Draco won't have to wear em either."
The raven tappen his chin with his wand. “I suppose it could be better. Don’t you think so?
You have to be honest. Something I
And with that Harry fell into oblivion.
Harry heard another muffle of protest, and the body underneath his twisted again, in a futile attempt to get free. Malfoy glared at him and Harry let out a chuckle.
“Draco!” his father's sharp voice came, dragging him back from his thought to the present. “Are you listening?!”
Surely it couldn't have been less than twenty minutes. It felt far too long. It HAD to be longer. An hour maybe? No...hours.
And Draco couldn’t help but let his mind wander off when the fireplace to his dorm lit up in bright flames. His father’s crinked up face coming in view.
Draco gaped when he heard those words slip out of the boy's mouth. Potter merely turned to face him and smiled '
“Asleep. The fever has come to a bay, but I doubt a little bit of sleep would do any harm.”
He lets out a groan, feeling another sharp throb in his stomach, but tries his best to stifle it. It was painful, and he hoped Draco wasn’t going through what he was.
him to do this. As long as it cause the Weasley's pain, it didn't matter how or what method was used.
her children.
“Took you long enough,” Draco breathed out.
See any mistake? Tell me! Criticism and suggestions for the plot are greatly appreciated!
scared. Ok. Maybe he was a little scared, but it's not like he'd ever show that to anyone. Expessially not to the oh so great saviour.
“Scared, Malfoy?”
Potter blinked dumbfoundedly. He stared in disbelief. "What?"
” the raven stuttered for a moment, before putting that scowl back onto his face. “Well, then. You can stay here with the freaks until you agree to what we say.”

“What is your name?” Granger repeated, Carrot top simply leaning against the doorframe, arms crossed, looking more amused than one should. Maybe it was just Draco didn’t transform properly in this world. How...how was it someone could be amused watching another hurt? Was that how they worked now?
..I-It couldn’t have been h-his fault...
He could hear Blaise trying to stifle a laugh, and grinned when the raven turns around to meet him in the eye. Draco didn’t dare back down. He gazed right back into those

“Hmm...”

Draco blinked in realization, before turning back to Pansy’s adorable cute, but annoying pug face. She was right...she was so right. He was in too deep.
Draco face palmed and sent Blaise a pleading look, who in return starts to defend Pansy with his 'That's right, Potter. You can't tell her to move!'
She couldn't tell. She wasn't sure wheather Malfoy was simply burying his face on the bundle or kissing it softly.
do you think you are doing out this late?”
. My name is Harry, what’s yours?”
He screams until his throat is raw and used. Crumpled like the small piece of gum in his back pocket. And it is long before silence fills the dark room.
But then again, who wouldn't? Who wouldn't want to free this beautiful world of something as gut-wrenching as he is?
“You take that back!”
He could just fall into this illusion of bittersweet nothingness. Draco supposed it was selfish of him, but then again, could you blame him? For wanting to have even the smallest taste of this forbidden fruit. One taste. Just
Draco felt a wash of relief wall over him. He welcomed it. Weasley ran his hands through her hair, cradling her lithe body. Granger was a strong woman. Draco wanted to remind Weasley that, but he figured it really wouldn’t matter. Granger wouldn’t break. She wasn’t glass. If anything, she was a force to be reckoned with. The brightest witch in all of Hogwarts.
soundtrack.
He heard a small chuckle from behind him, and Draco couldn't help the small smile that found its way to his lips.
His skin pierced through the barrier and before he knew it, Draco was on the other side. He looked up from his place on the ground, gaze meeting a violent shade of green. Potter was on the other side. Banging his hand against the barrier.
"Let go, Potter."
. Guess looks can be deceiving, eh?'
"Before what, Potter? Didn't you hear? She said
“Is that blood?” Hermione asked, narrowing her eyes at Harry’s hand.
Harry paused for a moment, and scratched the back of his head nervously. “..you know...like an adorable little lawn mower.”
Harry Potter?"
Dying didn’t sound so bad. It’d put an end to the pain and if heaven truly did exist, he could be together with Pansy and Theo and his parents, and...and Emery. Surely, she deserved to go to heaven. Even if she had made a mistake. Blaise’s made mistakes too. Mistakes that haunt him to this day, and he hopes God is forgiving. Afterall, had he not suffered enough?
“What?! No–I..Fuck–why would I
Idk if this chapter made any sense at all...but it was basically Draco deciding he wants to live, against all odds. He's not joining either side of the war, because neither place is somewhere he belongs, but he just wants to live, much like the other slytherins.
"Well then, you two can learn to

room. So deal with it, and just go back to sleep," Harry mumbled while crawling onto the bed, only to be kicked back down.
Skiiish367
The raven tightened his grip on his wrist that held the knife, and growled as a warning. He could hear the creaking of his bones as they were crushed harder. Draco didn’t dare let go of his knife.
Draco winced and this is when Blaise walked in for his rescue. Grabbing Pansy's robe he pulled her back and took her place next to Draco.
out of all people should know that!” he barked, snapping his finger at the raven accusingly.
Draco shrugged again. This ‘talk’ was getting on his nerves.
"Mornin' Draco! Sleep well?" Draco looked up to see Pansy with a huge smile plastered on her face. "Well you know cause' I slept pretty well!"
Molly quickly nods, and put a her arms around the boy's frail body, ready to pick him up, but he shakes his head and then moves out of her hold. He lifts his arms and raises the bundle, as if to tell her to take it.
He waits...gripping the spring as though it were his last resort of survival...and maybe it was. He can tell it’s Harry. The footsteps. Each person’s step defined, the sound calculated to its unique shape and size, and Draco has made it an art to memorize the steps of all he’s met.
was out after curfew last night?"
Wait....Potter?...
“Draco..” His father’s voice is soft. Something, Draco hasn’t heard in a long time. He finds warmth in the lies hidden behind that spark of love. “Put the knife down.”
"I-I..how d-did I get-," he stammered.
He needed to fly to get out and to fly he needed the broom, and if he gave the broom or potions to Potter, then he wouldn’t get out, and if he wouldn’t get out and if he didn’t get out he’d endanger everyone's lives here...he’d be the reason they died.
Granger let out a small satisfying smile, and walked closer up to his tied up self. “Now, that wasn’t so hard now was it, Sylas?”
Were they? Or was Harry doing this all out of guilt. Draco groaned, running a hand through his disheveled hair in frustration. He didn’t know and it infuriated him.
The panic filled through his every vein. Chemicals running through his very bloodstream, flooding them with  unbearable dread as it leached up from the deepest pits of his bones to the tiniest tingle of his fingertips.
And Draco let go. Sobbing into Potter’s pillow, a tiny part of him wondering if Potter would feel anything at all when he would find this ugly body of his, cold...
Draco shifted awkwardly a little. He scratched his head in nervousness, and pulled his legs up onto the couch.
“Psst...hey! Hey Blaise....psst,” Draco tried, dragging his feet forward in a tired manner.
He shuddered, and batted his eyelashes lightly. “So Father,
“What?” he snapped, looking around to make sure no one was around to listen into their conversation. Harry had taken him to meet Blaise who had been sitting in a clearing near the tents. They weren’t far from everyone else, but close enough to be caught running away. Not to mention, they had taken his shoes again.
Blaise and Pansy stared at him strangely through the whole process. They exchanged curious looks and proceeded to tap Draco on the shoulder. "Draco...what is that?"
“Liar!” Granger blattered out, accusingly. “He’s lying Harry! You know he is!!”
Sorry, I know it's a short chapter and not all that good. I'll do better with the next one!
That's when she finally took in the sight laid out before her and gasped. She regretted saying those words to the boy, that didn't mean she liked the boy any better. She simply had pity. The boy infront of her was wearing a shirt. ONLY a shirt. Blood stained it, and she could make out his thin, trembling body underneath the thin cloth. She wondered when he had last eaten. His ears and face nearly blue, hair disheveled. Hands shaking and his clothes drenched in mud. His eyes drooped and looked as if on the verge of fainting.
(See the end of the chapter for
Draco gasped, feeling the boot come in contact with his ribs. He skidded back, the boy coming between the window and him once again. The raven stood tall, and unhindered, while Draco stayed down on a knee, a hand pressed up against his ribs, trying to ease the pain of the boot.
"I - it wouldn't matter. He...he wanted a boy." Draco lied. Well not completely. Lucius
I almost
Draco's wand flew out of his hand, and now rested in the palm of his rival. Draco gaped and his eyes grew wide.
Malfoy, he was trying to walk away...he was trying to leave, and occasionally losing his balance, but somehow managing to stay on his feet.
Blaise is angry. It’s unfair and he’s so angry he fears it might burn him from the inside..
The freak leaped onto him, and he punched it in a desperate attempt to get it off. Her mouth snapped open, coming down to him. Draco closed his eyes. He didn’t want to die. He didn’t.
“Just
Men and women and
“Forget it. Tell me how you knew I was out after curfew?” Draco questioned, trying to reel the conversation into another direction.
Draco gave a crooked grin. “Yeah? Don’t seem like that to me. Seemed like you were pretty intrigued with our little
Molly sighed yet again. It seemed to be becoming a habit. Not that Molly minded. It helped her get things off. She would take in a breath, and let it go, as if letting go of all the worries out with that one breath.
Harry doesn’t reply to that, instead looking back to the wall. “We didn’t stay
"Why is she..you know dressed as a boy?"
, and
"NO! He can't!!," Malfoy said abruptly causing Madame Pomfrey to raise and eyebrow "I-I mean we hate each other!"
“I want to see Blaise,” he says, tearing his gaze away from the makeshift heaven in front of him. Oh if, Blaise knew...if only he could see
"WHY ARE YOU IN THE BED WITH ME?!"
Draco paused for a moment, not speaking and then returning Granger’s questions with a soft number. “..Layne..”
“Enough, Potter,” he muttered glaring at the boy.
The realization hit him like a bullet. Ripping through his flesh, tearing and digging deeper with every growing second. He scrambled for the knife laying discarded in the pile of snow. Draco dug into the snow, reaching for the blade, but Potter was on him in an instant, knocking him over sending them both rolling down the hill, away from the fight.
“I’ll get you a Treacle tart?”
won't repeat itself again,' Harry decides. 'Not unless he doesn't get the dark mark. Then even Madame Promfrey herself wouldn't have a reason to stop me from snuffling the life out of Malfoy.'
Warnings: Self doubt. Suicidal thoughts. Minor bits of torture. Flashbacks. Implied child abuse.
"For this obviously good plan, ofcourse."
“I SAID ENOUGH!! Don’t...just
He lowers his gaze to the floor, contemplating on whether or not he should be revealing such information to them. He could lie. They wouldn’t know. They didn’t have to know...as long s Blaise kept up with it...they would never know.
The raven laughed ad though Draco had just told him a joke. “No can do, Blondie.”
“Your name.”
“Ok, I start,” Draco said, cutting potter off, who had just opened his mouth. “During second year...How did you get a hold of a Polyjuice Potion? Was it Granger?”
Draco knew that wasn't the case, but he couldn't help his thoughts as they grew more and more sadistic with every passing second. Had Potter known that Draco wasn't faking, he probably would've helped, wouldn't have said those words. That hero syndrome of his would've taken over....or maybe. Maybe he would've been even worse. Telling him that this is what Draco deserved. And maybe Potter was correct. Maybe he did deserve all this. He deserved this....
He turned his head around to get a better look at the other's face. Potter face was hanging low, cheeks flushed red, all the way to the tip on his ears, and his gaze low. Kinda cute. Potter was averting his gaze, and that's when the sudden realization dawned upon him.
to survive. “We weren’t alone,” he started, catching the raven’s interest. “Our group had been bigger. There were thirteen of us.”
He ran.
"I have to do it!!! Ron! You don't understand!!!"
“You don’t underst–”
Harry sat up. "But I don't get why?!! Why me? Dumbledore could've chosen anyone! But he chose me!! And I HATE Malfoy!"
Sorry for updating so late! School started and my grades were beginning to drop, so I was focusing more on my studies. This new chapter is a bit small, but I hope you all enjoy it. I'll be sure to make up for not updating in the next chapter. Until next time~ Be sure to review!
He licked his chapped lips. “T-the u-unfortunates, of course. O-our hideout got c-compromised.”
Draco runs, but Potter won't let him go that easily

“How did you know?”
"I think I have the
Draco thought, trying to push his nerves back down. He dug his nails painfully into his sweaty palms, panting, trying to get just one good breath in through his lungs.
"Cuz Dumbledore asked me..."
” the raven paused, green looking over to meet silver. He hadn’t needed to say anything else. Draco already understood.
She hummed in response, before raising her head from his chest and sitting upright on his lap. Her eyebrows furrowed in concentration, and she pouted.
Draco may have not been the most nicest person in Hogwarts. He may have not liked the Weasley's or the bloody saviour and he may have wanted nothing more than to make their lives miserable, but never would he stoop so low. Never
"Kill me!"
The raven lets around another laugh, despite the battle commencing around them. Draco holds him tighter, as though it would protect Potter from the chaos unfolding around them, but it doesn’t do much. Potter lets out another grunt of pain, biting his lips too keep him from crying out.
Running away without shoes was suicide, and it ensured his captivity without all the ropes and shackles.
. Why couldn't he?
Malfoy only responded by another stir of his head and groaning a little before snuggling closer into Harry's chest. Oh, if only Malfoy was awake and aware of what he was doing. He'd throw a fit.
“Please....please,
"Maybe you should visit Pomphrey...ask her for a-"
“What. Is. Your. Name,” Harry emphasized, his voice turning angrier dropping a few octaves as growls emerging from the back of his throat. He sounded almost...feral.
"Yeah? Well
The warmth of Harry’s hand when he’d “cradled him in his arms.” It was something Draco would rather than admit remembering. He remembers how soft, and welcoming that disgusting shade of green was. How much warmer it felt than the green on the tip of the Dark Lord’s. They were the same colour, yet so much more different.
before him. Perhaps this world had something to hope for after all. If not, Lily would at least be able to get a couple normal years in life, before it all ended. A shame, he wouldn’t be there for those special years of hers.
Well, it wasn’t really their ‘base,’ per say. Just a spot where they would stay for the night. Traveling during the night was dangerous. Unfortunates plagued even the emptiest of places, but that had never stopped Blaise and Draco. Traveling at night was the easiest for them. It kept them out of sight, and the sewer systems were a great route to get around the city. Unfortunates tended to stay away from these areas when the sun went down. They moved out to the open during the night. The behaviour was strange, but then again, when had unfortunates ever been normal?
He gave Blaise a reluctant nod, and quietly removed the netting from the window, before getting to work on unlocking it. Unlocking the window hadn’t taken long. A couple pulls at the small gaps between the window frame with a couple twists of the notch, and the window slip open with ease. He motioned for Blaise to stay outside and keep watch. Blaise gave a small sarcastic salute, and disappeared around the corner.
"How pathetic."
Draco whipped his head around, face contorted with disbelief. Har–no...
” the raven went on. “Remember that deal we’d made earlier.”
In other words..
He didn’t know how to reply to that. Were they dead...were they alive? Draco didn’t know...he fears he’ll never truly know. “
They looked so
“Same thing Blondie, now speak!” she growled, spitting at Draco with spite that he’d only last seen in the Unfortunates.
It was for her. Didn’t belong to him, or Blaise....it belonged to
"What's wrong, Potter? Cat got your tongue?" Malfoy mocked. He felt his strength come back. This was where he was good at. Talking himself out of any situation, and how to change it to his benefit.
Oh, he was lying alright, but Draco hated them...Gods he hated them so much. They were no better. No better than the
