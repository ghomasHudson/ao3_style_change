At this, Draco laughed properly.
Something became clear for Harry, the reverential way that Draco spoke about them. He hugged him closely from behind, soaking in his scent, sending hot breath down his collar as he settled his chin on his shoulder.
He was trying to outrun himself, he knew. The early morning was the hardest time, the time of day when his brain favoured whirling fast, faster, fastest. Grimmauld was orderly and neat, and by all accounts now very beautiful, and belied how scrambled he still felt inside sometimes. After his daily run or workout, after a hearty meal at the newly installed breakfast nook overlooking the street, after he flipped through the paper ensconced in the sitting room, warm and satiated and by all means at a place in his life where he should be very happy, that's when Harry started to question things. The
"Don't play coy with me, Harry," Ron said simply.
"It's nothing," he said, eyes carefully avoidant, "just the regular kind of bad dreams."
"Ah, another drop," Harry nodded sleepily. His eyelids were half-mast at best. "Apparently I'm prone to those."
"Those lunches are for my mother as much as they’re for Pansy's, to keep hope afloat. That maybe, somehow, one day..." He trailed off. "The gloves, those are a deal made with my father, to keep the errors of my ways under wraps."
, was a form of roleplay he hadn't ever admitted to himself that he wished for.
Depression, eating disorders
Perhaps with love came selective memory, because though there were plenty of cold and blustery days as February plodded on, Harry was hard-pressed to recall even one of them. Each day came and went according to plan as he and Draco settled into a regular rhythm. Harry spent more and more time in Leeds at the worksite, but his days were flexible. That left him largely available, something especially helpful when contrasted with the rigidity of Draco's schedule once his work and research both started up again suddenly and in earnest.
Harry snapped his fingers to set the smoke-evaporating charm that Draco was kind enough to use and Pansy hadn't bothered with to work. He noticed that the corner of Pansy's blackened pout quivered, though she'd probably die before she showed outward happiness about anything to do with Harry.
Harry was sure the thudding of his heart was audible. It would beat free from his chest any second and he'd come unstuck from his body, he was sure of it. How could they be talking about this? How could there still be death, now, so many years out from the war? Hadn't they all suffered enough?
“Incorrect. It’s a win-win for the press and for the charities, but you’re losing because you clearly hate being paraded around." Draco turned to face him properly and took a step closer to him, and Harry's blood raced. Draco lowered his voice, the moment becoming more intimate. "It's surprising to me that more people don’t see through your bullshit.” Draco gave him a once over every bit as obvious as the one Harry had given him, and Harry could feel where his gaze lingered; at the level of his hips, the edge of his shoulder, and dragging every inch up his neck. “What’s truly offensive is you clinging to that pathetic messiah complex of yours for so long.”
"S'good," Harry said, not surprised at how thorough her research was. Satisfied, she made copies of the scroll containing her findings in triplicate, borrowed Ginny and Luna’s owls to send the one-sheet to Mungo’s and Wheezes headquarters, sent her little owl Athena with a copy to Molly Weasley. Harry hand-delivered the original to Pomphrey, his eyes drawn back to the descriptions under
Hermione gave him a genuine smile, studiously ignoring Ron's glare. "Hi, Malfoy. How are you keeping?"
"What?"
"Mmm, yes, cytology."
"No, you don't," Draco glanced at him. "You breeze through to get to the 1960s and drool over grey landscapes by the Bridget Riley's of the world because they're oh so
"And they, um, smell nice? Is that peppermint?"
“You want more of that, don’t you,” Draco murmured, tugging gently again.
"You going to take up decorating then?"
He hung from the doorjamb, treated to the expanse of Malfoy’s spiky shoulders tenting his robes as he hunched over his makeshift workstation.
The issue with his preferred sandwich was that it was so towering in height—three kinds of meats and mayonnaise, grainy and yellow mustard, a variety of cheeses, and sprouts, lettuce and more cheese, and sliced shallot, and sure, throw on the salami, why not, it was there for eating, wasn't it?—that the thick wedges of tomato he crammed in turned its insides into a slippery mess, which caused about a third of it to spill out onto his plate (though his fingers were quick to grab large, errant chunks of things to pop back into his mouth). It was a disgusting way to eat, the sort that would have sent Aunt Petunia into fits over, and Harry fucking
"This way, once we all sit down for dinner soon, we can ask him for his version of events and give you a hard time for the parts you got wrong," Hermione said. Ron huffed a laugh, barely there but still, something, which brought a smile to her face too.
She twisted up her scarlet pout, pushing a lock of hair away from where it had swung and stuck to her painted cheek. Her eyes darted away from Blaise's face and over his shoulder to Harry, and it was clear from the look in them that she had more ammunition in her arsenal.
, and we'll need some room to grow."
"That must have been, erm." He coughed into his elbow, painfully awkward. "Very. Hard. For you."

Brunch and brisk exercise.
Pansy gasped. "Did you have an actual little black book? You
—but Harry's days had nothing on Draco's.
"Shh," Draco whispered into his shoulder. “Breathe. Little sips.”
"What's your definition of sex?"
It was one of those sounds that tear a rip in the psyche and leave a scar. High, and tight, like Malfoy'd gone and swallowed a handful of razors and chased it with a harmonica. It was terrible, and Harry relished it.
"It's all right there, Molly," he said, wrapping her in a tight hug. "You've still got at least six other chances at grandkids."
Harry closed his eyes, concentrated on the touch, and the birdsong, and the rushing of the winds. It was enough to keep the ugly thoughts down, at least for a while.
Draco paused to lick his lips, his eyes darting further down the hall. Harry stood like a statue at the foot of the stairs, hands full of Draco’s things and was both glad to be close to Draco for this, as well as aware that he was awkwardly close to a conversation that wasn't his to have. His eyes followed Draco’s to take note of the additional heads of flaming red hair that had appeared from a variety of doorways. Ron and Charlie joined from the kitchen while Fleur, Ginny, and Angelina were gathered at the top of the stair.
"Tell that to my back. You haven't been sleeping in a chair for two nights."
"We could. What do you want to do?"
lines that were sure to become their new normal. He placed his hands at his lower back and stretched, face to the sky as the sunlight that had awoken him thinned with swirling clouds. A chill ran through him and a feeling of emptiness—partially fuelled by hunger, and something else, too.
"Alright. I'm going to have to shave everything," he frowned down at his body with a pronounced
Harry huffed, drained. "Snape wouldn't have wanted thanks from you. He loved you—he knew you were thankful."
"Anyway, I'm okay so far, though. Haven't had to face some of the people who didn't know yet, so 'okay' is apt to change."
reminded him of what he was to Draco. Of what he wasn’t.
At last, Jacqueline looked away, through the window. "First time you've visited?"
me now, darling. I keep a journal, and once I realize something's amiss, I'll go straight to the Ministry." The voice was familiar—a woman's, posh and acidic.
"Now, if I remember correctly, you were very helpfully touching my cock just a few minutes ago," Harry said as he leaned away.
"Malfoy. Draco that is—did you hear about this?"
with his facial expression, while she pretended not to notice.
Harry was dithering over a Charms essay when she had him read over her careful cursive one last time.
"Yes," Harry answered. Draco licked his lips and crawled over.
"Yes. I didn't press them in the first place; the Aurors did."
for Harry sitting down with some of Draco's friends in a way that he would construe as going behind his back, unless Harry
himself, but he's decided being loaded and bitter is good enough, and for what, honestly?" Ron sunk his face in his hands and exhaled.
"How do I always
"About last night." Harry wrung his hands together; the toast wasn't sitting right. He was going to be sick, he was sure of it. He did, however, have Draco's silence, which was close to having his full attention, so he ploughed on.
He closed his eyes and nuzzled his nose into the pillow, willing for a few more minutes of being held like this before Draco recoiled from him.
The interview went strangely well. Harry didn't sweat through his shirt or throw up on Luna from nerves—his top two fears—though he did trip over his own shoes upon entering the room, a detail he hoped wouldn't make it into print.
"Yes, what?" he asked, twinging one of Harry's nipples enough to make him yelp. He licked his lips—he was panting, now, ready, so ready for whatever Draco wanted to give him.
Harry's cock had thickened, but he ignored it with reasonable ease. He didn't want Draco that way, didn't want to fuck him. Not tonight. He wanted to explore him, learn his every mole and freckle, soft spot, and the places that made him sigh, so that's what he did, and Draco was a very willing participant.
"My cousin Ithaca, she runs most of the building contracts east of Germany for the old guard. Could go a long way in expediting your home for lonely waifs project."
"Right," he said, passing through the kitchen and into the dining room. He took his usual seat, accepting the squeeze of his hand by Draco's under the table when he sat.
"Oh, pet." Draco purred the words, stopping on the threshold of the room for a beat before entering. When he got close, even the sight of his bare feet was a balm to Harry's vision; when he stood before him and pulled him close so that Harry's heavy head could rest against his thigh, his touch sent a violent shiver down Harry's spine.
an owl a
Harry's lips wobbled, and he raised his own eyebrow, leading Draco's face to fall. "Stop, that was not a compliment, you dolt," he hissed. "I—You're less of a twat when you're not squinting through a migraine." Harry stopped fiddling with them and watched Draco flush, pink right across his cheeks.
Luna's spin. All eyes turned to Draco.
"You too, Mione," Harry said, following his friend's lead, eager to hear her stories and not think, not for one moment, about the story that was currently breaking across wizarding Britain.
"I’m not," he said.
The nurse checked the pager affixed to her hip, scowled. Jessica, her name was Jessica. Muggle, unaware that Malati's difficulty to remain in one placement for more than a couple of months had a lot more to do with the willful, wild magic inside her and less to do with having a delinquent or unmanageable personality.
"I don't mean—"
"Look at me," Draco said quietly. "Don’t say that."
"He's in the main studio, the first one on the right. You see the tape on the floor?"
He leaned in, leading with firm lips. Harry could feel his magic swirling, prodding at his own. He could
"Say it. By then, there was what? What stopped you?"
Or so he pretended as he started down the stairs and then immediately retraced his steps because he couldn't go getting soft now. He reluctantly put down the whisky, summoned the bottles and trudged about, putting them away.
Harry sipped the water, shook his head. "Don't keep it in the house anymore. Seems to incentivize the, er, drinking."
"You can hold this," Draco went on. He spoke firmly as he unfastened the heavy gold watch he wore and pressed it into Harry’s right palm. "Hold it over the side of the bed. If it gets too much, or you need a break—anything—you let go." Harry nodded, watched where Draco’s heartbeat was visible in the indigo lines visible at his wrists.
"Pans already gave you the grim warning, I see," he continued smiling and approached him, hands raised as though he might go in for a one-armed hug, though it luckily turned out to only be a friendly pat of his shoulder.
“But—”
The delicate whoosh of an owl's wings signalled the morning's post coming in, and that was enough for Harry to push himself up to sit.
Draco cocked his head, staring at him. It wasn't a cold stare, but it was calculating. He was planning everything that was going to happen, already knew exactly what would and wouldn’t. It was up to Harry to wait and be good, like prey that decides to stop running and see what happens when they lie still instead, belly up. Vulnerable. With patience, Draco’s plan would be revealed to him. It made the hair on the back of his neck rise.
Harry winked at her and slipped out the door.
"What's there to be nervous about?" Harry asked, meeting eyes that looked up at him from under a lowered brow. Draco's pupils were blown in the darkness, melting into irises dark as slate, pools of wet stone.
"I—uh. Sure. That sounds great."
"Clearly not!" Harry practically yelled back at her. He forced himself to breathe and his next words were quiet, controlled. "I don't understand why you're all so angry with me."
"No, but I like it. It's fun to feel like a slippery seal, every once in a blue moon."
Harry's heart felt full to bursting, and then Draco ducked his head, and his eyelids blinked shut as he took the tip of Harry's prick into his mouth, and Harry could hardly think anymore. He steadied himself with one hand at Draco's shoulder and the other cupped his head, glad for the feel of the silky strands beneath his fingertips. He was fast becoming obsessed with touching Draco's hair. He wanted to soap and wash it for him, craved the moments when Draco collapsed on top of him, and the strands would briefly tickle his nose. The thought of tugging at it was beyond—Draco would never allow it—so Harry entertained himself with smoothing it under his hand and letting it cascade through his fingers whenever he had the chance.
"You want it all, don’t you? You want the ease of sex and none of the trouble with the rules," he laughed hollowly. "I should have fucking seen this coming. You always did think that rules were beneath you. Like back in first-year—"
"Yeah?" Harry asked, straddling him, grinding up against the thickening erection that he knew would be back inside him within the minute. He was experimenting with being on top lately, bouncing on Draco's prick. The experiments had all, thus far, gone brilliantly.
"Nothing's going on. I want you, I just want you," Harry said. He tossed his own mask carelessly on the counter, and it slid, the sound of it cracking on the tile of Draco's kitchen floor like a shot in the quiet of his flat.
to be his poker face.
Malfoy pressed his forehead into the wall, a palm to it. The pain was still with him, and though it had made him soft, it could harden him, too.
they were suddenly in Harry's darkened bedroom, only the low yellowed light of a few candlelit lamps illuminating the space. It took a moment for Harry's eyes to adjust to the dimness of his room, which he was quickly thankful for. He'd tidied in preparation for the moment, but the standard to which he'd brought the room felt distinctly less once Draco was there, and Harry kicked himself from not being more thorough with the cleaning charms. At least the linens were clean, and the bed made, and his laundry was hidden away in a wicker hamper. The smudges on the mirror over his dresser weren't as noticeable in the low light, and Draco wasn't paying any attention to those things anyway.
Harry was literally biting his tongue by the time he gave one last wave to the press. The red carpet came to an abrupt end, and a pair of thick purple velvet curtains pulled back, revealing a remarkably subdued ballroom. He was early, at least for the under-fifty set, and the party was just getting started.
"So you admit that it's love, then?" Hermione said, eyebrows as high as ever, her wallet floating into her outstretched hand so that she could hand Ron his earned notes.
He swallowed hard at the thought of being able to claim Draco's mouth with his own, feeling like a kiss would be too much, even though they were so close that Harry could taste Draco's breath. Lemons, not sour from beer or acrid from tequila. Harry concentrated instead on what he had before him.
, you know?"
"You know your titans, then," he mused. Harry watched him pull on the cigarette and then took it and dropped it into the kitchen sink, flicking his fingers at the tap to turn the water on and off, the embers hissing as they died.
Harry leant forwards and answered loudly behind a cupped hand, "It's setting off a whole bunch of red sparks with your wand. We'll teach you when you're older."
"We've made our way to overpriced toast and juice," he said instead. His cheeks pinked, and he looked away, demure, almost. "You remember."
"Tomorrow's what, Wednesday?" Harry nodded, and Draco sighed, shaking his head a touch, the way he used to do to keep his hair out of his eyes. "Nothing. Well, not nothing—a run in the morning, and then, maybe I'll drop in on mum. I've been avoiding her for weeks. She'd like that, if I came over."
Harry shut the front door with a kick behind him on a deep sigh. He took the moment to lean his tired head back against its sturdiness as he dropped his duffel in the darkened hallway and stood there, shaking off the frantic yelling and flashbulbs that had greeted him as he entered via the front walkway.
"Oh, and for how long?" Draco took Harry's hands in his own and clapped them together, and held them in a prayer pose. He was positively
"Not really verbose, are you?" she said with a raised brow. Blaise Zabini, behind her, smirked. Harry could see why these were Draco's closest friends.
"It's not so bad as all that," Harry said. He had to get out. He couldn't stand it, wanted out from playing pretend. He wasn't on an even keel. He wasn't alright; he didn't want to be here, drinking with Justin; didn't want to be in this castle, thinking about dead things; didn't want to be praised by people who thought he was good and sweet and something close to holy when they didn't
Harry's grip on his mug tightened.
Pansy raised her brows and made a considering sound as she stepped further into the room. Harry's wand flew into his hand without him even thinking it, and Draco crawled over the bed to slap a hand over his, his eyes wide and pleading.
Within minutes he located and pulled on a mostly clean t-shirt and summer-weight robes, whispered a cleaning charm at his new glasses, and tried to remember and failed the incantation to hook a watch to one's wrist. Before he could overthink it, he wet his hair and dragged a brush through it, forcing the swells of wild curls to choose a direction. Might as well try, he figured, if he was going to brave the Ministry. Reza'd cut and styled his hair so artfully for the Quibbler's photoshoot that he'd stood back, hands clasped under his chin and had marvelled at his own creation.
A fucking call out. If he wasn’t sure it would be taken poorly, Harry would have hissed a joking
Harry smiled a private smile and lapped at the underside of Draco's cock, fully hard now, and Draco whined, one hand twisting into the sheet and the other grasping at his chest, just over his heart.
extinguished in an instant.
"Why? What kind of question is that? I, I..." His lip curled as though the question itself was beneath him.
"You left the tab open," he said by way of explanation, dipping the first digit inside Harry. He groaned, wanting the whole finger badly, but more than that, so much more than that. He blushed too, a silly thing. It was an automatic reaction for being caught out for wanking, though he knew that Draco of all people found it both hot and natural that he'd still do that too, no matter how often they fucked.
Harry eyelids closed, but only for a second before the lilac scent of Draco's
They visited at Ron and Hermione's flat that night for more ceremonial Prophet burning. Nobody talked about the fact that people were only arriving through Apparition or Floo, because reporters were staking out Ron and Hermione's flat too. Draco joined in the fun, levitating fresh copies to feed the flames from a stack Ron arranged like logs on the far end of the room. Harry wondered where he was nicking them from, but thought better than to ask.
When he paused this time, Harry waited in the silence with him. There was no use pretending that he wasn't curious, not now, sitting in a bathrobe and breaking bread with the object of his lifelong obsession.
He brushed a bit of hair away from his brow—growing but not too long, perhaps Narcissa didn’t think pins a problem any longer—and Harry whipped out a hand to grab his. Draco flinched but his Seeker reflexes were long gone, and the jostle from Harry’s touch was enough to make him gasp.
she knew, and that she wanted me to get her second meaning. That to take the Mark and be gay, be me—that I was setting myself up for a life of loneliness. Double failure."
"You'll hurt yourself doing that," Harry said absently, touching his own face. Malfoy's wiping away of the tear tracks was a battle he was quickly losing as they continued to spill into the hollows of his cheeks.
"Not at all," he said. "Tell me more, don't let me cut you off."
“Here, let me—”
He pulled a cigarette from the packet in his back pocket and concentrated on it until it lit. Harry had never seen him do magic like that, from will alone. He was stronger than Harry knew, in a lot of ways.
"I don't want to wonder if you're out there, fucking some idiot when I'm not available."
“Good luck telling him that,” she said. “I know I’d want a fag after the weekend he’s had.”
"'Attempt to tamper with evidence,' 'auxiliary attempt to tamper with evidence,' and there aren't any," Malfoy ticked the answers off one by one on his fingers. His eyes blinked under heavy lids doing their best to remain open. Harry could see that the potion, food and drink had shored him up some, but he still needed rest. What Harry should do was to politely leave, yet he wanted a little more time. A bit more information to flesh out the image of Draco Malfoy in his mind.
"So what are the obstacles in your path, and how do we go about clearing them?" she asked, fumbling around on the side-table and settling back with a quill and a notebook at the ready. "I think we ought to pen a cease and desist to every bloody publication running that photo. It's an assault, and they're profiting off it. I say, we threaten charges in the hundreds of thousands, and get some corrections printed, for starters."
Later that evening, he would see Ron; the invitation to dinner had been set at long last, not even at Hermione’s behest. She swore up and down that she’d taken no part in arranging the meeting and reassured Harry that it would work if it contained apologies from both sides. Harry felt ready for it.
"Maybe later. I was going to do some reading, and there was a program Pansy said we had to catch this evening, so I ought to get the work out of the way now, before..."
"I know," he said, voice barely above a whisper.
"Think you might join in the Victory Day stuff?" Ron asked. He avoided Harry's eyes, elaborating, "I got word that the Ministry's going to turn it into a bank holiday this year. I'll be, uh, making the announcement, actually," he sniffed, and Harry realized that he was embarrassed by receiving the honour. If Harry had still been on the force it would be given to him, full stop, but with him gone, Ron's star was clearly shining a little brighter.
He pushed the hair stuck to his brow back and took a deep breath. "And I'm
He knew before anyone else that this was different. Passing Ravenclaw table, he could see that the hives blooming at Malfoy’s wrists were of a different order than those caused by the powder.
"And what about Teddy?"
In the pocket of his coat his fingers found the pair of damp tickets. The show he was going to be late to. For
"To remembering," answered Draco.
with his lips that he made no sound when he did it because it wouldn't be kind to hurt Oliver's feelings any more than he had to, and it had been a long time since he'd had a warm set of hands on his body or an eagerly sucking mouth wrapped around his cock and he came too, easily, without fuss.
Mr. and Mrs. Weasley still didn't know.
"Flawless," Harry answered. He removed them to spit on them and tried again, kept at it as a rain kicked up, distant thunder quaking the house. When he bumped a third against the rim Cissy tensed.
"Draco," Harry said dumbly. He took a steadying sip of his drink as his mind went blank, and Susan did a double-take of the two of them.
"Don't tell me you're thinking of wearing that? You do know that there will be pictures, right?"
Harry didn't want to control himself, but he also did. He wanted to fuck Draco into oblivion. Wanted to march him back to bed and tell him to take the day off—the week—so they could do this forever. He wanted to be taken by Draco, over and over again, and then have Draco take care of him, just like this. Harry slid past Draco's slippery lips and gasped when Draco started bobbing his head and swirling his tongue around the head of his cock, and he knew it was all over when Draco dropped the spell holding his hands above his head, and Harry ran his fingers over the slick stands of Draco's hair, his other hand pushing against the wall of the shower, and that was when Harry came. A surprise, almost, but more of a release. He relinquished control for a second, acknowledging how deeply his want for Draco went, and like a wave lapping in at the shore, his orgasm built and broke until he was gushing into Draco's mouth.
approved to run for print." When neither Harry nor Ron responded, he dropped the paper and sighed dramatically.
Ron tapped his spoon against his bowl, and without looking up, said, "Since Dean's party then, yeah?"
A queasy tide rose in Harry as something Blaise said clicked for him and he let his head fall between his knees again, hands at the back of his head, gulping deep breaths.
he thought, particularly with Draco, who, for some reason, was patient with him. Draco, who was almost infinitely kind when it came to this. Who took it slow and told him what to do when it should probably be obvious.
"Shut up, Potter," he said, flicking one of Harry's nipples.
George had attacked Draco. Ron said something about Aurors. They'd been called, so they'd been by the house. They were coming back to collect statements. Harry should be furious, but there was nothing there. His well was dry.
"Delightful, isn't it?" Justin spoke into his ear. He leaned in each time he did it, for show—it wasn't so loud that Harry couldn't hear him, and he didn't need to speak so quietly. They had no secrets, though apparently, he had reason to make other people believe that they did. Harry watched his icy-blue eyes dart down to his mouth. The want in his face was obvious.
“Don’t,” Harry warned. The hand retracted and Draco coughed into his fist to cover for the moment.
"Just—you know! Guys who you wouldn't be embarrassed by, and who you don't have to teach everything to. Who’ve been to the l’Oeuvre and know—things! Regular-people things, like what summer camp was like, or how to go on a normal adult date. I assume you're busy with—"
"Wait, wait! Back down a little bit. Just a titch."
Harry and Draco have a talk over tea.
"I'll stop when you stop," he snapped. "What's caught your eye?"
"Smoke," he said, ascending the stairs at a jog.
He let out an enormous sigh, hands rubbing at his face. Harry was stunned to silence, not sure which piece of information was the most ludicrous. He didn't have to choose—eventually, Malfoy pinned Harry with a look. It made Harry want to squirm.
"As if. How is it that you still understand nothing of debts between wizards, of all people?" Malfoy stood, looking at Harry like he was a confusing and slightly disturbing painting in a gallery.
"Between the two of us, which—let's be honest, our being together is already a bit of an affront to pureblood values—" he looked to the rafters, gathering strength from whichever god it was he turned to during his times of need and sighed, slumping into the stance he'd taken, "we're the
"You haven't looked yourself in a mirror lately, have you?" Draco said, pulling away to plant a kiss to the corner of Harry's eye. "You've looked better, darling."
." Justin's eyes crinkled when he smiled, which was unnerving because Harry thought it to be a false smile. But perhaps this really was his idea of fun. "Starts to sound a lot like
"What time is it?" He pulled the rubber plug from the sink and rinsed his hands clean, shaking droplets into the sink.
"Both hands, on my—please, use me, yeah—"
"Got it. Well, I'd love to say goodbye to her before my boyfriend comes home and finds us like this. He's known to be quite possessive."
Malfoy rubbed at his chin thoughtfully. "Of course. Talking."
"That's so confusing."
"You’ve got me," Harry said, and Draco made an undignified snorting sound, more tears leaking. "You’ve got an aunt too, Andromeda. And Teddy, he’s your, um—"
He tried not to remember those days too clearly, and with time and practice, the memories dulled. That whole period of his life became a bit of a hazy blur, and he was glad for it. To prepare the biographer of his book to get the details right, he took to pulling out memories and sharing them, and there were certain ones he wouldn't mind destroying, if only it were possible. A lot of the memories came from those days.
"Welcome home, master," Kreacher greeted him, his short steps accentuated for the first time by the slapping sound of shoes against the parquet floors of the entryway. Draco had convinced him not only into shoes, but also a grey set of robes. Sure, they looked like they'd been sewn from dishrags, but there was certainly craftsmanship to them.
"What on earth are you doing?" he asked. Kreacher disappeared with a
"I know the really big ones excite you," Draco mumbled, trying to act annoyed and failing miserably at it. He brushed his lips against the scruff of Harry's jaw and Harry inhaled his scent, thanked whatever deity had granted him the time he’d had with Draco to grant him a little more. One more day. And one more day after that.
Harry did it again, laughed at how she lost the ability to speak, a low growl emitting as the hand gripping at Harry's shoulder dug in uncomfortably.
“I did it all this morning.”
of every feeling possible.
quarrelling, like, is it an artefact from your past? Or perhaps you picked it up from spending so much time with Granger and Weasley—how have they
The sound of water running in the pipes cut off, and the silence snapped Harry out of his voyeuristic reverie. Malfoy had been out of his line of sight for a few minutes now, and though his panic attack should be subsiding, Harry knew from experience that it could also be segueing into its next surge.
"Ron and I might even nip off and visit you two for a night in Spain if we can swing it."
The look on Ginny's face was priceless as she scrolled through a Rolodex of compromising situations that Harry had been privy to. As amusing as it was to see her face twist in horror, Harry was elated to hold Draco's eyes, eyes that genuinely seemed happy, knowing that though there would be awkwardness to come, and sometimes grief or anger, that if Draco Malfoy and Ginny Weasley could give one another a chance and hit it off the way Harry had known they
"See what you did, just there? I mean—
"Sure he did," Harry pulled a face, knowing his impudence wouldn't get him in too
"Talking didn't matter,
Harry took a deep breath and looked to his own hands. He had to be cautious now—to avoid letting sentimentality colour his thoughts. Clarity was required, and that meant absolutely no touching.
"What is it? I am sorry—are you—"
"Why not? Are you allergic to money or something?"
"Care to try that again, Potter? Maybe this time with words?"
"Imagine that. You, saved by the good word of Muggles." Malfoy shrugged, as though this weren't patently ridiculous. "Well, that's for the best, isn't it?"
"What's so funny?" Harry turned to Hermione and noticed the same mischievous look on her face. And then Ron, who was staring at a bit of gum stuck to the sole of his shoe, a sure sign that he didn't trust his face to keep composure.
" he swore with his eyes smashed shut, his voice going thin and reedy, and he started to plead, "I'm going to come, Harry. Harry, I'm going to come, I'm going to come—"
"I know," Harry said. He gave a weak smile and a wave as the signal that he too was going to leave, now that he'd had his fill. "It's always at seven."
"All of you hetero idiots, shut it.”
on his lips, tears not yet fallen making his eyes sparkle, an exquisite pain yanking down every available muscle in his face. He'd looked so hurt, like Harry hadn't just wronged him once but had pulled back a curtain to reveal a forever of lies. Like Harry had proven him right, like he'd been waiting to be let down that way.
"I don't care."
Draco picked up his wand from the side table and cast a
"Though I must say, we have triage for a reason.” Penelope moved to his side and, like clockwork, adjusted a tube running into his arm, and then tapped her wand against the machine that dispensed potions into it. “You gave Morrison at the front desk a heart attack, appearing like that."
Harry chanced a look, could tell that his fake smile was turning into the real kind.
Draco shook his head and looked to all the points of Harry's face, about to say something, stopping himself.
The barest flicker of surprise went over Draco's face. "The only person you have to blame for that is yourself," he said. He looked to the ceiling, clearly trying to temper his excitement with his usual mask of boredom. "Apparate us up, won't you? I don't want to waste time on the stairs."
"Sorry," he apologized to the duvet. "That was childish."
"It's funny that it's only now that you care to pay attention to what's going on," he said one day, pulling at the skin beneath his eyes as he judged his skin's pliability in his newly installed mirrored headboard.
"It's complicated?"
“With no potion, I don’t know. Half-day, maybe. Or until I vomit.”
," he said. "How's that so bad?"
Yet here he was sat only in pants with Malfoy fully dressed. Harry wished desperately that he could have woken up anywhere but here.
"What does it matter?" he asked. He didn't mean for it to come out angry, but it did, and Draco glanced back at him, not bothering to hide his annoyance.
Harry held his eyes; this was the answer to the question that he'd somehow never asked. He was taken back to the time Draco had told him about his degree, how defiant he’d been. That defiance was gone now—the fire, so to speak, had gone out of him. His grey eyes searched Harry’s, zigzagging back and forth between them hurriedly. Harry wondered if he was the first to hear the truth in so many words. If perhaps it was his not asking that made Draco comfortable enough to share in the first place.
"It's like I'm talking to a wall. You can't go doing things like this
"Chocolates?" Harry guessed at, already stepping towards the door.
Harry realized he'd begun tapping again, fingers rapping to an ever-faster beat. It was a habit Uncle Vernon had tried to spank out of him long ago. He stopped and balled his hands into fists in his lap. He hardly dared breathe too hard for fear that he'd ruin the moment.
, he thought, scrutinizing Charlie instead. People who voluntarily spent most of their time with animals rather than with humans tended to be a little shy.
"I'll bet you were a cute baby," Harry said as he walked up behind him and hooked his jaw over his left shoulder.
Things started off stilted—polite small talk of the flavour Harry was generally worst at. But with a little bit of time and a lot of alcohol in their friend's veins, people warmed to one another as potential tempers cooled. He and Draco remained glued mainly to one another's sides all night, but at some point, they'd split up. Once he extricated himself from a conversation with the Patil's about Valentine's Day plans that left him needlessly worried over a holiday Draco had thus far shown no interest in, Harry lost track of how long he watched Draco through the open doorway between the parlour and the sitting room.
"Um, in a category. Let's do cheese, I'll go first. Stilton."
"You haven't seen drag till you've seen Izzy Inside on the big stage."
Or quiet. Why so quiet?
before he speaks.
. Partnered dancing, you know—" he shrugged, slotting in warmly against Harry's side, "lifts and such. It got to the point where I could eat just about whatever I wanted, and the numbers on the scale didn't change."
. To do it for blood-traitors and filthy, no-good people was unthinkable, but for
"What the fuck," Harry said. He stood and found himself quickly silenced by a single gloved finger held inches from his face.
"You’ve lost it. I said I’m
from the out of
"Sorry," Draco whispered.
“Then let’s leave the house.”
Draco was a nerd—a terrible, irrepressible, verging-on-mad-scientist level nerd—and even the loss of his apprenticeship and the 9-to-5 position that went along with it wasn't enough to keep him from reaching for more knowledge. Harry had picked up that his work was on water purification and synthesis, but Draco didn't regale him with much in the way of explanations beyond that. He was out of the house more often too, running even in sleet, and dancing, Harry had learned, though doing exactly what kind and when was sort of an enigma. His was frenetic energy, and Harry slowed in the face of it.
"Dunno," he answered honestly. "I just can't do public life anymore. Can't bear smiling for another camera or the thought of dragging anyone else into it. It's not—I can't ask for someone to do that for me. I don't want that to be the price of admission to being with me."
Harry accepted a paper cup of tea from Ron, struggling to control his breaths.
Newell directed his wand to lift Draco’s ribs up and away. They released with resounding cracks, opening his chest like a book made of meat.
The early weeks of August passed much like the weeks that preceded them for Harry—stretches of absolute boredom punctuated by bouts of anxiety. The schedule was giving him fresh ulcers, he was sure of it.
It was twilight, the sky a purplish-orange, when Harry thought himself done for the day. Nursing a tumbler of Firewhisky, he tried to enjoy the last rays of sunshine from the ledge of the owl-window, one leg dangling out precisely the way Hermione always told him not to for fear of him falling all three storeys. What started off as a speck in the sky grew into a familiar shape as it advanced towards him. Not a gull or a pigeon, then; his heart sank as it swooped directly for him.
, he thought, though that had been for when he worked up the courage to tell Draco how he really felt about him. It was a bit late for that—but why, then, did he still feel all the nervousness of a pre-pubescent boy?
and Malfoy's salacious little show had got him half hard in three seconds flat. Unlike the times this happened as a teen, he lacked robes' convenience to hide the obvious tenting in his pants. He slouched lower into his chair, causing his knees to accidentally brush Malfoy's under the table. The feeling was like an electric shock. He repositioned himself again, placing clammy hands on the tabletop.
"And Mr. Sparks let it slip," Draco added slyly. Harry knocked at his shin, but the smile on Draco's face didn't budge. Harry settled lower into the couch, lingering in Draco's space.
"I can appreciate that," Harry said. He didn't know how his voice remained even; when the shock of what had just happened with Draco would actually set in.
He sat, waiting for an avalanche of feeling to come to him, but it was blocked someplace too deep within him to reach. The sticky bun sat untouched, like set dressing.
"Nagini. She got Arthur Weasley even worse."
Harry rolled his eyes, bent backwards with the force of the eye roll.
"Honestly?" Draco shook his head a touch in a movement that would make sense if his hair were down, though it was pulled back into a loose ponytail-bun-thing. Harry wondered if it was a nervous habit. Did he usually wear it up, or only on special occasions?
"Ginny it is," Draco inclined his head.
—which he whispered over and over again each morning as he faced himself in the bathroom mirror, even though he still thought the saying had an inverse relationship to the truth.
"I won't make good company," Harry said. His throat hurt from the want of a scream or a cry. He wanted the whisky, but did he want it more than he wanted Draco?
Harry shrugged. "Can't be all bad. Stag do, don't forget the rings."
"Hmm," was all Draco said. His knee knocked once against Harry's under the table, then hit again and stayed there. A warm touch, explicit in what it promised while his face was clear, unreadable as stone. Harry drank in the sharp edges of his profile while he glanced around the room. His hair was loose today, pin-straight and wispy, parted on one side with his long fringe pulled behind his ears. He had perfect ears, Harry thought, not sticky-outy like his own. The silver stud earring was back, and Harry wanted to lick the shell of that ear, discover how much tickling Draco could take before he’d be pushed away. Harry considered too what it would be like to finally run his hands through his hair, to discover what the undercut felt like, if it would be rough like rubbing dragonhide leather the wrong way, or if it would be impossibly downy, like an owlets feathers. He wanted to run his fingers along Draco’s scalp and hold the back of his head as he kissed him, deliberately, slowly.
Draco had been kicked to the curb once, and the flat was the cushion he’d fallen onto. It was the only home he’d ever known other than the manor because he’d never really seen Hogwarts as home, had he? In that way, it was the only thing that had ever really been his—safe, a retreat from anyone and anything—the whole of the magical world, even.
because I can. Because I
, they were
, his brain supplied. He sat back on the bed and ran a hand over his brow and into tangled hair.
"It's not fine—"
Harry is still hissing when Draco enters the kitchen. His shoulders are at his ears and he’s facing away, baking mittens with gold-thread snitches stitched on midnight blue laying next to him. One baking tray containing eleven perfect sugar cookies on the counter, another sticking up at an odd angle from the sink. What appears to be a baker’s dozen sugar cookies coat the floor in crumbled bits.
Harry laughed, accepting the nips to his throat.
"Thanks," Harry said, though it was muffled, his cheek pressed awkwardly into Ron's chest. He was in shoes and Harry was barefoot, so their height discrepancy had never been more obvious. Harry was glad that Ron instinctively ducked down a bit to make the angle more comfortable. They shared a deep breath, and Ron didn't pull away when his phone vibrated from his pocket.
"Please, don't right now Malfoy—"
A hot breeze blew through the street, carrying empty crisps packets and dried leaves from some poorly looking trees past them. When Draco spoke again, he was so quiet that Harry had to strain to hear him.
" Draco whispered, fingers curling painfully into the nape of Harry's neck. Harry'd never swallowed a cock so long, and he wanted to try.
—I had a list—"
"Getting around to it," he hedged. Draco made a knowing sound and didn't press further, which Harry was grateful for.
“This is me asking you to consider linen next time.”
It was in this way that Harry found himself a short time later nibbling the crust off of a triangle of buttered toast and staring down a modest pile of scrambled eggs, the rustle of newsprint and Draco's running commentary the soundtrack to his weirdest Saturday morning on record.
"Nothing's happened, don't sound so worried. Mordred gave me the day. We went for tea, and she suggested that we each take off a little early."
"I'm sure you were offered a, um. A—"
He breathed in through his nose, out through his mouth, the way his Healer had taught him. The feeling that his bones were reverberating slowed, stopped.
"Normally," Malfoy said, "this is the part where I'd offer to take you out for breakfast."
Harry nodded, "Yeah, Chelsea. So I suppose he's not at the Manor anymore. He was still, you know,
"We can go, let's go," Draco said. He took Harry by the hand and led him through the crowd, pushing him up against a wall as he collected his jacket from coat check, leading him out through the front door. The night air was as bracing as a slap to the face and woke Harry up to the fact that he was stumbling drunk, unable to pick his way over the cracks in the pavement without Draco's firm grip. He steadied him as they waited in line in the alley for their turn to step behind the dumpster serving as the club's Apparition point.
And he let himself be drawn under Draco's spell that he was doing well because it was easy, too. Draco certainly made it look easy, re-built the schedule he'd had back when Harry had to be pencilled in during the handful of hours he should have been sleeping, and there were so many bricks in the walls that he structured his world with, so many tasks glueing everything together like mortar, that Harry could see now how Draco stayed busy to keep himself afloat. That for him, being occupied was a replacement for being happy.
"That was staged." Harry rolled his shoulders back, forced himself to sit up straight in his chair. Malfoy did so elegantly, as though it were the easiest thing in the world. Harry wondered where he got the core strength or discipline to manage it. "By which I mean, my PR manager made me go."
Draco sucked his teeth. “You’re no fun,” he said. The bell dinged and he got in, a little too obvious with the staring, but otherwise playing nice.
"Thanks," Draco shook his hair and dipped his head, abashed. "I figured you'd notice and—but—nevermind. I needed to tell you. And this means I'm about to move to phase two." He checked over his shoulder again, clearly paranoid. Which was fair, in the Weasley house—there was often someone just out of sight. Secrets didn't last long within the walls of the Burrow. Harry waved a hand, a strong
"The point of all this is to introduce our friends to one another. That's it. And to come out from hiding behind these walls all the time. I've already met most of yours, and you mine. Yours are too scared of you to be rude, and mine are also too scared of you to do the same."
"Did you have a good time?"
"A family name is tied to all sorts of benefits. House magic—you gain protections from being on the grounds where your family has lived and loved and died. Your magic is stronger—magical people literally live longer, healthier lives when they regularly visit family-owned lands."
serious?" Hermione asked while pretending to pick through the mix for her preferred coconut bits.
Harry couldn't contain his grin when various bits of crockery clattered as knives and forks dropped to them. He was impressed that though Mr Weasley dribbled a sip of water down his front, he managed to quite handily clean it with a quick charm before anyone else noticed.
Harry was caught by Malfoy's eyes. The edges of his vision blurred, and he was back at the table last night, the takeaway menu in his hand, mobile in the other. What had he been doing just before? The owl, the little one. He felt light, his mind going fuzzy like when you've blown too hard into a balloon, felt—
"Yes, sir," he said, and this time there was no joking pause. This was the game that wasn’t; all at once release while being nothing but tension and technique. Total concentration to let go.
Malfoy visibly deflated, holding Harry's eye as he sunk back into his chair.
"No good deed goes un-fucking-punished then, is that it?" he asked the walls. Kreacher, from some unseen corner, croaked a laugh.
Harry snapped his attention back to Draco. The joviality had gone out of his eyes. They were cold, the pebble-grey with nothing to share.
"Are you?" Draco made a sound somewhere between a laugh and a strangled cry. "Is this any better than if I told you later that I’m a failure?"
It was late, and his heart ached, and if there was a higher power they weren't listening to him, they had bigger fish to fry, because despite all his pleas, Draco hadn't woken up.
Draco snatched the sheaves back with a dramatic sigh.
"No, Harry," Draco said, pushing him gently back to lay down. "Don't worry about it. You miss your parents," Draco added, putting the things in his hands down at his bedside table. Harry melted into the mattress as wool enveloped his senses, everything softening. "That's only natural."
In a daze, Harry lined himself up to that soft spot, the head of his cock trapped between the small, smooth globes of Draco's arse.
Harry hoped Malfoy would return his smirk with the appropriate amount of condescension. He was surprised when his partner looked up instead, slowly, a dawning comprehension smoothing a wrinkle from his brow.
it against you. You didn’t know then, either, when it would stop. If it would stop."
he thought.
Because Draco Malfoy didn’t want to hold hands with him. Him with his bad hair, lack of worldly experience, insipid thoughts. Him—
"If that muddies things for you," Draco said, suddenly very interested in the hem of his shirt, "then no. We don’t have to kiss if you don’t want to."
cute," she said as she made change, and Harry flushed so furiously that Draco cocked a brow when he returned.
"How's that?"
is going on?"
of course—and you declined it, didn't you?"
The pause was pregnant, and Harry was impatient.
Draco fiddled with the things on his side-table, arranging them in neat, right-angles to the edges. His face was flat, emotionless, which meant he was expending a lot of energy hiding an emotion.
"I'm working on it," Draco had groused, the first time Harry had remarked on them. He smiled at the memory. He'd missed Draco's ornery replies.
"I'm only trying—"
"Stop saying you're an idiot, Potter; I already knew that." Draco flicked his cigarette butt to the ground and swiped the bag back at last.
Ron shook his head. "Off duty. I'm here to see Harry—Collins is lead on this one."
"You feel so good when you come," Draco said lazily. "The way you clench." Draco kissed his shoulder and held onto him briefly, a long parentheses for Harry to nestle into as the sweat cooled on their bodies, and Harry could tell that he was thinking of how Harry would feel around his cock, and for a moment, Harry was sure that he wanted that too. That he didn't have to fear that he'd do it wrong, or that he was a monster—a mistake—for wanting it. Imagined that it would go just like this; Draco taking care of him, Draco soothing him into it while working him into a frenzy, and for the first time, Harry could imagine clearly what it would feel like to take Draco inside of him without assuming it would be painful, or that he would be made to feel dirty—and that thought stole his breath away.
"It was my own potion that did it. It was an accident, though," he said, looking down at the offending arm, as though he could see what had happened all those years ago once again through the layers of his coat and shirt. "I applied it, and right away, I knew that it wasn't working the way it should."
"Ten minutes, give or take. I still need to shake the Minister's hand—"
“Tell me about it,” Harry sighed, eyeing the growing inbox of voice messages, half personal, half work-related, all considered urgent by the sender. Their bags and papers and jackets took up an ever-increasing amount of space, though they were yet to be told off for having installed themselves in the canteen—Harry thought of it as
The kitchen is quiet but for the flow of the water for a long while. Draco opens his mouth with a question and then swallows it when Harry’s shoulders rise again. The way they had when he was in pain.
Harry didn't even gasp. His shock was silent. Draco's tongue dipped in again, deeper. He was licking his come out of Harry's body. He wanted to; was enjoying it. Groaning into it; shifting closer when Harry instinctively flinched and drew away. Stopping; starting again, he nose bumping against Harry's body in his attempt to get closer, closer still.
"You can't Apparate off Hogwarts grounds," Harry said.
“You take that back,” Harry hissed, his finger a threat, inches from the tip of Draco’s nose.
Harry seethed. The way Justin thought he was smooth, that the fire in the grate was lit just so, the light a dusky glow, the way he sat back in his leather chair and widened his legs, he—
Harry barely widened an eye at her. "And what makes you say that?" he asked.
"We are, normally. She's been busy—I haven't seen her since February." He straightened in his seat and stared at his plate, but Harry watched as his fingers dug in more tightly to his thigh. "I finally know why."
Narcissa gawped, and Healer Xu and Ron remained in perfect silence.
"Kreacher is going to be furious with you."
"How?" Draco gave him an incredulous look and held out an arm. Harry grudgingly took it. He didn't want to be coddled. He felt restless, like he wanted to fight, or fuck. Draco ambled at an easy pace, apparently unaware of the seed of discontent growing within Harry. "What is it that you need to get ready?"
“It was the
He licked his lips, confused. "What do you want me to say?"
"Well, a friend came by with a karaoke machine, and Harry sang 'That Don't Impress Me Much,' supposedly on a lark, but he's got the voice of an angel and it's a memory I'll cherish until the day I die."
Draco turned to press his nose into his hair, breathing him in. "You’re welcome to try," he said, the words sliding out warm across Harry's neck. Harry brought his hand between them to rub at the front of Draco’s trousers. They were neat, pleated charcoal grey today, and it thrilled him to know what colour pants he had on underneath.
"Then how in the fuck did my mother, of all the people in the world, hear about Harry Potter happily dating some young wizard and going on holiday with him? She was making small talk, trying to bridge the fact that as far as she knows, I’m her forever single faggot son, and yet somehow, she hears these two details 'through the grapevine.' How does that happen, Harry? What am I supposed to do with that?"
, for being pig-headed, ignoring most good advice, and driving them half-insane. And who trusts pretty boys, anyway? You're far too good-looking to trust, to be honest—"
Draco nodded slowly. He didn't know that Harry could see his grip on the headrest tighten—this talk excited him too.
"It's alright," Harry said. "I hate what it represents, but it doesn't matter anymore."
"What's with the gloves?"
Harry huffed so that it poofed up his fringe. "Well, I am, so..." The flush of embarrassment burned up his chest, and neck, and soon enough his cheeks heated with it. Draco brushed hair from his forehead, turning to face him, though Harry wouldn't return his gaze.
"Yes, please," Harry said the words and Draco smiled, slow and languid, and when he stood and peeled his jumper off, Harry recalled the promise of what the night was meant to hold for both of them, the promise that had started with a fumbled kiss and a declaration earlier in the night. And he thought of the note at the bottom of the pile, the one intended to be read last. The pit at his core, what was left after his flesh was torn away. The thing he wanted more than anything.
“That shouldn’t take an hour,” Harry returns.
Draco gave a little gruff laugh, humourless. Surprised.
"I was always, I dunno...off. Weird things happened when I was around—I could speak to snakes, even then, and my magic went haywire when I was stressed. Other people told stories—teachers, and god forbid the neighbours realize that
Harry smirked. "There was a fair bit of shouting, I'll give you that. But we, uh, came to terms. Figured it was a touch childish to draw wands and duel every time we ran into each other."
Harry waited for a response. Finding none, he turned to find his love with his mouth ajar, fingers curled into soft, open fists on Harry's pillow. Harry smiled, curled to face him, and pulled the blanket up to cover his exposed shoulder, because Draco was already soundly, blissfully, remarkably, asleep.
Vignettes of encounters that are troubling, full of warmth, and blisteringly hot.
me. There are parts of me that aren't fit for people—I can be dangerous, and he's patient. He's kind, Ron, and he makes me better, and I—" his voice cracked, and when he looked down, Hermione had taken his hand.
"Well, I mean, you did, but only because you were such an enormous prick about it. But you don't seem like that prick anymore, and I don't want to share hanging out with you with everyone yet. Because it'll be a whole—"
"I was your slag, coming round for months when you called for me. I thought I'd changed, but that's all I was, wasn't I? That's what I'm good at."
"I'll pay for it," Harry said without thinking. It seemed obvious to him, and he wanted to paint over that fact quickly, refused to let it become a sticking point. He held up a hand and, astonishingly, Draco didn't begin squawking about it. "Please don't fight me on it. I'll authorize it through Sparks, he'll set up an account off my main vault. I ought to just fund therapy for everyone in our year who needs it." He rubbed the back of his neck as Draco made the sound he made when he was thinking.
Malfoy shrugged, dragged his tongue across his lower lip. "More than you, I'd wager."
How did I not know this?" Ginny asked Harry, but didn't wait for him to actually reply, a common format of asking questions at the Weasley table. "What did you study?"
he'd asked. And now Harry looked at him and wondered the same.
"One more time and then I'm coming on your lips." His voice was a hoarse thing, sexy as fuck when Harry had him close like this. His fingers tangled in Harry's hair and Harry brushed his teeth along his shaft, knowing it would be the end of him. He pulled free and kept pulling the base of Draco's prick.
He holds still as stone when you press one finger in, wet from your mouth. You're the one who gasps when you make it in a single knuckle, and his body answers the question you asked, you think. Maybe. He's too tight for much, but it's a marvellous feeling, so you attempt to rock that finger in all the way. He appreciates the effort, top teeth a row of white biting directly into the pillow of his bottom lip, his cock bobbing rather than waning, pulling up between you.
"Oh, shut up, old man," Ron scowled as he joined them. The hallway wasn't wide, and the four of them was already enough to crowd it, but then the door opened again and a healer exited the room, surprise clear on her face to see so many people assembled there, staring in her direction.
Draco sends a locking charm at the door and rises, whip-quick. He stalks into the kitchen and snatches his hand out, tearing off the slippery curtain of the Invisibility Cloak from Harry’s shoulders.
By contrast, Draco keeps his wing of the manor quiet. Predictably calm is the way he likes it, and Harry’s growing to see its benefits, too. Draco dims the lights with a flick of his wand as he approaches the crate, even though Harry is already in his padded black blindfold.
"Exactly. How much discomfort would you say your shoulders are in now? Out of ten?"
"We've blocked two days in your calendars to do that this week," Draco answered breezily. "And yes, Victoria re-booked your meetings with the Ministry to accommodate the schedule change."
Talk. Talking isn't what the two of you do best anyhow.
Draco's eyes flicked up to meet Harry's. He beamed. "It is. It's a long-lasting potion. Slow-release of lavender and peppermint. Just a touch."
Draco coughed. It stretched into a dry retch, and Harry sat back in his chair to watch.
Harry unlaced his fingers from Malfoy’s cold ones. He didn’t remember Malfoy taking his hand.
." His yell echoed off the stone, but he didn't slow his journey up the stairs.
"I've been living amongst Muggles," he repeated and nodded, as though now he too believed it to be true. "Yes. There. I've been—don't
I needed to do some shopping that you absolutely may
His haughty delivery and intonation were so familiar that if Harry didn't have what felt like cotton-batting filling his brain and a thousand tequila shots in his veins, he was sure he could place it. When he looked over, the man had a cigarette in his mouth, and with a snap of his fingers, lit it. The tip flashed red in the dark as he pulled on it. He looked back at Harry with eyes a hazy colour, icy, blue, maybe; one arm crossed under the other as he blew smoke out of the side of his mouth.
Once home, Harry locked himself inside for days. He moved listlessly from room to room, subsisting on toast and tea with sloshes of whisky in cups for good measure. He half-arsed the forward for the updated version of
at cutting hair. Just ask Luna—Luna! Aren't I ace at haircuts?"
"What? Did I say something wrong?" Harry said.
Caged within the bony thorax of ribs, protectors that could so easily become threats. Harry’s seen what the jagged edge of a broken rib can do, rupturing the soft bags of organs inside. Connected by the sternum, at once so strong, but, on an exceedingly thin person, seemingly fragile.
“Listen—I kept count until about fifty, and then it started getting iffy, and my data was missing info—"
That stopped him moving at all. His jaw clenched—Harry's answer angered him, somehow—maybe because it made him more sympathetic, or maybe because he assumed him to be lying. Either way, Draco's icy demeanour was fearsome.
"You're owed a proper apology," Draco said, his voice so incredibly small. The edges of his lips turned down into a grimace—he was trying not to cry, pushing the same key around and around on the little metal loop that held it. He didn't wait for Harry's response, slid the key into the door and turned the lock, left it open as he walked down the darkened hallway into his flat.
George's wand," Harry yelled, holding his hand up with blind hope. It hit the back of his knuckles at high speed, signalling that it had come from within the darkness near the woods. Harry didn't think at all as he ran across the field, stuffing the wand into the waist of his jeans as fear from the unknowns of that dull sound grew with each passing second.
“How do you feel?”
"Believe what you want," he challenged. "Whether I was before or not is kind of irrelevant to the fact that I am now."
"Dead boring to be honest, can't hardly tell what's he's been dragged in for. Not that I wouldn't normally be all for raking a Malfoy over the coals or anything—I've still got the scars from my stay at the Manor—but it's brutal."
"You do know that you have the self-defence mechanisms of a crab, don’t you?" Harry asked.
"Truth."
"What room is this?" Draco asked on a cold, rainy evening in early October. The earth outside was gilded in yellowed leaves, and the wet scent of decay drifted in from the window he cracked open, his long fingers smoothing the edge of the mouldering tapestry to the side.
Luna shrugged, placid as could be. "She's a bit nervy," she said, pulling up the cascades of blond waves from her shoulders to fan at the back of her neck. "She's also very particular about her lippie. Could be having a difficult time charming it in place," she said, knowingly.
"Have a lovely trip. Love you," Draco said, smiling at Harry from where he remained perched on his seat. He turned back to the paper and immediately scanned a new article to dive into. Words caught somewhere between the buzzing litany of thoughts and the lump in Harry's oesophagus—
"This way," Harry motioned across the street, and they walked side by side, quick, long strides carrying them a block left and up, and on they walked, Draco turning around every so often to check that they weren't being followed. His silence was unnerving, and once they'd cleared four blocks, Harry slowed his pace and stopped, knowing them to be around the corner of the donair spot, Dean's braying laugh audible in the cold night air.
"It's early still, and the specialist hasn't been in yet to see him, but he's awake. Patient Malfoy's asked for you."
"Not much of an exciting spot for a date for young people like yourselves, is it, a bird reserve," she said, looking around them. "The kind of a spot a bookworm might pick, or a brown-noser." Her pursed lips spoke to an affected air that her speech didn't hold at all, though her resemblance to Narcissa Malfoy always made Harry feel younger than his years, as though it were wrong to speak to her as a fellow adult, when he was so clearly a child next to her and always would be.
,” he said as he finally gazed down at Harry’s lap.
"That's good?" he asked, and Draco nodded vigorously again, little sounds in his throat. Harry took his time, settling in to kneel. He realized that the air in the room was unusually warm, as though the house had prepped the space for them to be more comfortable in it while naked.
"Good to see you too, Henrietta."
The moment of tension passed without fanfare, and so soon it was properly dark when the time the younger generation stood, clearing the table of the main course's dishes to make way for pudding. Draco tapped Harry by his elbow and gestured with his head to follow him out.
was precisely what CONSTANT VIGILANCE had taught him not to do.
"What's this Ministry of Transport shite got to do with Tom? Or Justin."
"You like that, do you?" Draco murmured, nudging Harry's legs together by tapping at the outsides of Harry's feet with one of his own, pulling his hips back until he was bent over at an easy incline, feet planted one directly next to the other.
"Potter?"
"Don't mind me saying you've got the support of any forward-thinking folk on your side. Does your interview have anything with what's brought you to the Ministry today?"
Draco's brow furrowed. "Your scars hurt?"
He was drawn to the collection of framed photographs, a blend of Muggle and magical, hung just inside the bedroom door. Most were photos Harry had found within Grimmauld or had been gifted to him over the years. In the centre hung one of the Order from the early Eighties, his parents smiling out from the ranks of so many witches and wizards now passed; another of him with Teddy at barely six months old, cradled in Harry's arms. Harry was gaunt in that picture, but when he looked at his gurgling godson and smiled for the camera, his face was briefly less haunted. Below was his favourite of he, Hermione and Ron, eating takeaway curry on top of cardboard boxes from when they'd moved in together at their flat, a photo taken by George, and on they went, a short collection of memories from the last couple of years mingling with those from decades ago.
, he thought,
“Ask him to continue waiting, and close the door.”
He languidly pulled Harry's still-hard cock up from his body and pressed the point of his tongue into the slit, and Harry couldn't look anymore. He hissed and redoubled his grip on the couch, eyes squeezed shut against the overstimulation.
"It was a fluff piece."
Parkinson’s screaming intensified at the fainting bit.
Harry let out a small sigh of relief. Of course Draco had read of Dudley and the Dursley’s.
"Oh!" Luna suddenly perked up, "I'm visiting the east coast of Mexico. There's a coven of
"Why you can't just take fresh memories and work from those," Hermione muttered.
"Was that just me?" he asked her. She shook her head and squeezed his hand.
"Harry?"
He hadn’t thought it would feel the way it did.
he wanted to say,
He lowered it, but Harry couldn't stop staring. A potions accident, of a sort. The fact that he'd applied it himself. That it wasn't supposed to burn, or maybe just not the way it had. Not permanently.
"Don't," Draco warned, shutting Harry right up. He took another sip of his drink and put it down. He wasn't about to chance a repeat of last weekend, but it was clear that he was
In case they held a clue he'd missed, of course. Of course.
"Yes, sir. We were just about to stop and take it home," he tried for a self-deprecating smile.
"December," he answered. "Why?"
Draco had become something of a rock to lean on, had taught him about self-worth and what it meant to truly be independent. He quietly went about working harder every day than Harry could give him credit for. Harry watched as it took him a steady campaign of being the first one in and the last one at the apothecary out until Leon, a curmudgeon of a man who worked behind the counter and had lost a cousin in the Battle of Hogwarts, asked him to go round with the rest of his coworkers to their local the coming Friday. How Draco had slid it into conversation like it was a terribly unimportant detail of his day, barely worth mentioning, but had fussed over which of two shirts in an identical colour to wear to work that day, his only concession to the nerves he surely felt. Or how he must have been overflowing with pride when Mordred, a venerated potions master from the Department of Mysteries, sent him a memo that a research assistant position in her was opening in her lab in the new year and had Mr. Malfoy put any thought to putting in for a transfer?—that Draco hadn't even shown Harry the memo, had simply pinned it above his desk, looking over at it when studying some nights before making a fresh espresso, sitting down, and forcing another paper into his brain.
"I'm just tired,” Draco’s voice broke. He squinted, hiding tears building, or perhaps the light bothered him. “Besides—I live with Harry Potter." He smiled wryly, a smile Harry was certain hid a snarl. Like perhaps it had finally happened; he had started to resent
"If you say so," Harry managed to say before his breath was stolen from him as Draco lined up their cocks and rolled his hips, grinding his erection into Harry's own. He did it again, and again, and on and on until the only sounds in his ears were their twin inhales, sharp, and exhales, progressively longer.
Harry's lips wavered; he smiled up as Draco tucked his hair behind an ear. "So much."
"Tea," Malfoy repeated, his tone somewhere between bored and incredulous.
He slammed down the now-empty mug so hard that an olive jumped from its perch on the platter and rolled off the table.
Of course, Draco would put it all together. Harry appreciated him for his cunning, but he had underestimated him in this. Draco knew when to hold the line; how to stay quiet and watch, a snake in the grass, striking only when the time was right.
Malfoy snorted.
They held still as Harry's body grew accustomed to the intrusion. The suddenness was part of the point; he could feel the length of Draco's prick like a weight deep inside his belly, and his instinct was to revolt against the girth, but instead, he held still and did as he was told.
"But not anywhere that doesn't have a publicly available guest list, or it will be stalking, and I will have you thrown in Azkaban for it, saviour or not," he said by way of farewell. "You really can get out now."
“Don’t talk,” Harry warns, stuttering his hips to a stop against the soft cushion of Not Draco’s arse.
"Look," Draco held his hands together, as though that could quell their shaking, "you don't have to tell people for them to know. Not teenage boys out looking for a fight, and certainly not the men who taught them how to. We're fun, to them. Hurting us is a sport. You've never been so much as heckled before, have you?"
“I’ve always got a flare-up coming,” he whispered.
The air stilled. Harry hadn't meant to say that.
"You're nervous," she said, tucking the mirror away and closing the distance between them to pull him in for a hug that he sank awkwardly into, hands pausing inches from her back. "And on top of that, you're a terrible liar, Harry James Potter. Your interview came out this morning." She pulled back to look him in the eye. "Have you read it yet?"
She nodded, rubbing at a crick in her neck. "I can do you a soda and bitters?"
"Harry and Draco," Parvati supplied, tone suggesting that the pairing itself was salacious.
"I think it's
"You never want to talk about anything scandalous," groused Pansy. "I'm off to the loo, this is boring now."
"Well, in case you haven't noticed, it's a
The conversation was easy, the mash and roast beef mouth-watering, and the wine fairly free-flowing. There was a certain tension in the air as Arthur poured flagons of mead and George refused, hand held over the mouth of his glass, eyes cutting daggers into Draco from across the table.
“Are you asking me to move in with you right now?”
"The first is for protection, the second is for cleanliness," he continued, grabbing his wand from where it had rolled towards Harry's elbow. He squeezed his eyes shut, wishing for all the world that this was something he'd learned already in some grotty car or alone—but then Draco added, "You're lucky to have me teach you. If you get the pronunciation wrong on the second one, it makes for a
On the edges of the first few pages were other notes, written in a script that was minute even against his usual standard. Calculations pushed to the edges of pages and kept small like they were inconsequential and didn't deserve the space of his regular work, and Harry did understand these. Amongst Draco's marginalia were symbols next to common words Harry recognized. Like the number
Harry shook his head, pressed his lips together. He couldn't hear this. It was easier to be hurt than to talk about this. About anything.
Beneath it, a set of fresh wounds Harry had given him. Wounds meant to heal, but cut open by his hand all the same.
"Please don't ruin this before we've even started."
for it to happen. We didn't plan it with you in mind, okay?"
got attacked, that happened
Harry wasn't immune to bouts of the same behaviours. He still developed a pit in his stomach when he woke to cold sheets, still carried around a voice that hissed at him that he wasn’t enough, never would be. The voice engendered the niggling thought that Draco might have left for good, this time, which was his mind's way of protecting his heart from the possibility of more pain than it was built to take. As much as Draco's running worried him, he knew that his own routines often fell closer to obsession than health, more about punishment than catharsis, and Harry didn't bring these up with his healer because he wasn't ready to let go of them yet—not totally. He was about to take a step back out onto the landing, and it would be easy—he could knock first and then enter brightly, and in doing so give Draco the space to pretend that he hadn't heard anything. But then Draco turned to face him, because even when he couldn't hear Harry's footsteps he had the uncanny ability to notice the timbre of his thoughts, and he crumpled in an instant down to the floor, hiding his face in his hands, so that the option to go on pretending was stolen from both of them.
“Fucking Malfoy,” Harry breathed even as he gripped onto both of Malfoy's robed elbows and pulled him into a half-sit, concentrated, gathering his power, and with a
Draco's face screwed up, but he didn't open his eyes. He was exhausted too, Harry could see, though he clearly saw it to be his job to nurse Harry through his drop and not the other way around. Harry took the opportunity to pull his right arm into his lap and start the kind of gentle massage that Draco was normally very adept at pulling away from, citing the needs of work and concentration. He suppressed the groan low in his throat, trying to hide how good that simple touch felt.
Send. Sent.
. We could even take others romantically if we were discrete about it." He let that word,
" Draco grumbled, settling back on to the far end of the couch. Cleaning Harry's wine glass with a tap of his wand to fill it with water, he took a gulp and then offered it to share. "How do you get that charm to work?"
"Oh, Potter, I'm going to, oh
He fell back against a wall as he winced from the sudden, sharp pain of butting heads.
Draco mangles the word
"I don't know what to do with you," he said. It was a plea. A question.
"Well, I wouldn't—" Harry started, but Draco frowned and waved him off.
Her thin lips cracked a smile. "You wouldn't believe what people get up to in the chatty rooms. You're looking to get on the web, are you?"
He looked up, as though surprised at the question. "Sleep there."
It was bad enough they were paired together.
"It takes a certain kind of prick not to want his son to surpass him at anything, I think," Harry said slowly.
Draco clucked. "For four years?"
"You forget, pet. I'm
Draco scrabbled up the bed, fumbling for his wand.
Draco shrugged. "Nothing. You're made of some sort of impossibly kind Chosen-One-cum-Golden-Boy material—"
"You want us to come out as a couple," Draco said, tone flat.
"Somebody's happy."
"We," Harry croaked, "we didn't."
"You're hardly bellyaching, Harry," Charlie said. Harry shrugged, not sure what to say. He'd always thought of Charlie and Bill as so much older than him, and now at twenty-three, and Charlie only a little over thirty, it seemed strange to be able to speak to one another as fellow adults. He still felt like a child in so many ways, though it was a skin that no longer fit comfortably.
"Are you sure?" Harry asked, and Draco nodded, a bit frantic.
"Okay there?" Ron asked, his hand heavy on Harry's shoulder. Harry came to himself, noticing the changes in the space. A desk faced an enchanted window like the ones in the Ministry, portraying a version of the street out front of the hospital. The sea of black umbrellas held against a typical white London sky signalled that it had started to spit outside. Other than that, the room remained spare—two stuffed chairs, an oval rag rug, a few low tables and a loveseat were all the other visible furniture.
to take seriously, which is utter shite on their part, railing on about health and safety all bloody day, and yet my location goes to the highest bidder. Can't go in under the cloak or Polyjuice or a glamour and, I—I'm sorry, I'm rambling. I don't get out as often as I'd like, is all," he finished lamely.
"That's enough," Harry said. He closed his eyes and could see it behind the closed lids. He wiped the wet trails on his face away with cuffs that weren't soft enough for the job and stung his cheeks. "That's more than enough. It's horrible, and I'm so sorry."
"They'll love you," Harry said, breaking Draco's grip on his wrists and curling up to surprise him with a kiss on the lips. Draco held his face, and he didn't mind the chance to show off the strength of his torso if it meant being kept within kissing distance. "It's impossible not to."
" Malfoy's face was alight, and it did things to Harry. He felt hot, ears burning. At least his erection had started to fade.
"Careful," Ron whispered. Harry sucked in a breath and bent slowly to put his tea down on the floor, had to close his eyes as he sat back up, the pressure in his skull was so great.
“So the rumours
"Don't do that, don't
"Look at you with your big words," Harry crowded him against the wall, hands on his hips. "You think the really big ones scare me, don't you?"
Draco swung around to glare at him
He was with Draco Malfoy, and who could have known that it could feel this
He asked to be rimmed until he screamed. To have his hair pulled and be taken on all fours in front of the living room window, where anyone could see them. Voyeurism was a common theme, though it was often of the mundane variety: for Draco to meet him for shopping in Diagon Alley or dinner in Hogsmeade, where magical folk would definitely notice.
The man turned to face Draco, "We're sorry," he said, the woman joining him in an off-kilter chorus. "So sorry, love, we're sorry," she mumbled, and then they backed away, mumbling apologies, and something came over them so that they ran. The woman lost a shoe, didn't think twice about going back for it. Within seconds all that was left of them was her pink kitten heel, the satin grimy with dirt, perched next to a grate.
He closed his eyes against the memory and thought back instead to Draco beaming at him, gently teasing the idea of a vacation. Italy, with its tiny share plates of food, and ancient art, and Draco in diamonds, in dresses, in high-shine shoes that Harry would buy for him, gladly, for them to explore New York City in. He could pretend by latching on to
And then, as they do, things changed.
"Seems even you're catching the Muggle-fever," Harry said, twiddling the pen.
Draco rubbed his chin clean, wiped his face with the sodden square of toilet roll, and huffed a conclusive breath. He followed Harry's lead and picked up a biscuit, chewed it thoughtfully before washing it down with wine, and then quickly ate another. Errant crumbs were pushed into his fingertips, and he licked them clean as though he were eating a rich and delicious sauce.
"We'd hoped to walk you down the aisle, is all," Molly said. Her voice was watery, and Harry found her couldn’t look at her, stared instead at his shoes. "You know. Take the place of your parents at your wedding."
"At Royal Albert Hall, isn't it? That's a good one," the Healer put down the clipboard, motioned at Draco with his wand once more. "My wife is a fellow fan."
Harry was morbidly fascinated that it had been so easy. "Say no to what?"
They sat in silence for a full minute, and when Harry did finally look up over the top rims of his glasses, it was to watch Ron throw his hands in the air, all pretence of working gone out the window.
," she gestured at Harry, "whatever it is he's doing with you, this is the sort of behaviour that makes him sick. He can abuse drugs or not—it's a choice he makes. If he wants to carry on with follies about living for sin
"Fuck, indeed," Ron said. "I'll file this report—"
. They were doing as they do in the front room. Spin the Bottle with a side of carving initials into walls, et cetera. I was cranky, and it was probably about half-three in the morning, so I cast a little
Someone bumped into him from behind, and he stumbled. Draco's fingers dug into Harry's arms as he held him up. Harry hoped he'd bruise.
Draco slid down the bed; the sight of his superbly muscled back a wonder. Harry smoothed a hand over his shoulder and around to rub the hills of his spine at the nape of his neck.
“Does that hurt?”
"You're scowling."
Mrs Weasley kept breaking into a nervous smile when others looked at her. She meandered into view and caught Harry watching her do it for the nth time. He wiggled his fingers in a mock wave as her features settled into a slight frown. She'd been alternately wringing her apron or smoothing flyaway greys escaping her bun all evening. He watched, amused if not a bit sore in the stomach as she did both before walking briskly from the room with an exclamation of "The potatoes!".
"Here I am!" He said triumphantly, raising his fists to the sky before realizing that the exuberance seemed a tad insane and opting to lower them to a more normal, around the hips height, "and down the stairs we go! I'll give you the royal tour."
Harry winced. "Er, well, that's not what I said. I'm pretty sure it was a guest bed."
"Is that so, sir?" Harry said.
The two of them made easy work of the stairs, or so Harry thought until he bungled the last step and quite nearly face-planted into the wall.
"Yes, I realize this, Kreacher. And I know, yes, they are of Muggle branding, but the thing is that the master of the house and I wish to serve them to our guests this evening—"
"Brilliant!" Ron whooped at the sky before turning around and getting into an argument with his sister, and Harry turned around to jog across the grass to his godson, knowing that there was little more magical to a child than the snitch that won the game.
"Kreacher!"
“Not anymore.”
—" Draco winced in melodramatic disdain, "and perhaps a bottle of that sun cream Granger so enjoys going on about—"
"Blaise came by," he said. He turned onto his back and fished out a packet of cigarettes, held one out for Harry to light.
He came back to reality with Draco's teeth scraping his jaw. "My turn," he said, and Harry nodded dazedly, running his fingers through a pool of his spilled come and fumbling to grip his prick.
Harry shrugged. "I thought he did. He might, other days. But today, he teaches."
"Is this you telling me that you're ready to move in?" Harry asked.
"I—I like the blue," he managed.
He clipped his gloves on as he watched a mother pushing a pram pass by the windows. It gave Harry enough time to blink in wonder at the person before him. He looked like Draco Malfoy, Harry thought. He walked and talked just like him. But this person seemed in some ways a million miles away from Draco Malfoy, Boyhood Nemesis. In some ways, Harry felt like he might be meeting this Draco Malfoy for the first time.
They lapsed into another spiky silence. Harry looked away first and bit his tongue, desperate not to think back to that incident. He didn't like the memories that came along with Malfoy.
Harry pulls out and flips him over so quickly that the springs in the mattress bounce his skinny frame.
Harry sighed. Ticked through the usual culprits. Draco didn’t have access to ingestibles that could cause such constant nausea. Had been on the same potions for years. Had, thanks to Harry’s tireless and thankless work, managed to so far avoid the major complications life had in store for him—obstruction, abscess, perforation, and extensive haemorrhage.
He stoppers it again and frowns for Harry.
, even after what they’d done, Harry was still going dizzy over the little things. He felt thirteen again.
"I think so?"
"No, no, Harry, by all means,
"It's fine." Harry waved a hand, gesturing to the open seats.
The man held his eyes, smiling. "What you take?"
"You have to go around looking like you do, don't you? Take these stupid things off," Draco removed Harry's glasses from his face and floated them away with a careless gesture. Up close, Harry could see how quickly he'd been debauched—lips full, colour high on his cheeks and throat, wisps of bone-white hair falling into his face.
"And the talk of my own path, and—she had to, then. She did. I
Hermione pursed her lips together, looking off into the distance. "I believed him, I really did. Haven't seen him since, but it felt good. That maybe even one of the Slytherins in our year could come round to sense. And him, of all people. That's an achievement, in its own way."
Draco tossed his head to flick hair from his eyes, casual as could be.
Malfoy's general look was one Harry couldn't place. Bewildered, maybe.
"I'm sure you can imagine a few things you'd like to see in me," Harry swiped a finger through a dollop of creamy mustard and licked the finger clean, even as his cheeks warmed. If anyone was acting like a tart today, it was surely him.
recorded," Hermione helpfully informed anyone who brought it up all day—"how's that for climate change deniers?"
"So, you'll be bringing Teddy to Malfoy Manor?" Harry asked. Andromeda gave him a curious look.
"Draco, can you hear me?" He made a fist and vigorously brushed his knuckles against Draco's sternum. Nothing. Harry wanted to reach out, say
"Do I look schoolboy enough in this?" he asked, preoccupied with getting the knot to sit right.
good it felt, Draco's fist squelching lube, making a tight hole for the head of his cock to pop through and then spreading the liquid down to the base, and back up again. Harry's face scrunched up as though pained, though he loved the slide of it, Draco's palm and fingers gliding along him like silk.
Harry sat with that, and when he spoke again, the room was so quiet that he could hear the ticking of the clock from down the hallway. He knew he would regret this moment, but with Draco in his arms, fragile and open, he went with what he wanted, more than anything, rather than with what was safe.
with you."
"Just," Harry said, swallowing the sudden urge to cry, "please."
“He needs the infirmary!” Parkinson shrieked and everyone looked at her, bergs of mascara trailing down watery paths on her cheeks. Harry thought she deserved a BAFTA for the performance, and then remembered that she, like most people, didn’t have to fake their emotions.
"I honestly don't know why I'm telling you any of this," Malfoy said, eyes narrowed to a glare. "If anyone asks, I was incredibly inebriated on potions you plied me with, and I have no memory of this conversation taking place."
"It's really something," she spoke slowly, tiptoeing. "I'm a little surprised that you were as candid as you were. Luna does find a way to get to the root of things, doesn't she? The photos are striking, it's—"
Draco pushed the glass away from himself and washed his hands over his head, resting his elbows on the table and speaking to his lap.
"Oh, what's he going to do, fucking
"You," Malfoy whispered. He struggled to push the words out. "Shouldn't—be—here." His hands rose from the water and gripped either side of the tub, as though he were preparing to launch himself directly into Harry. Harry didn't avoid his stare. He'd been tackled in training by people and Beings twice Malfoy's weight, even when he was sopping wet.
drinks and snacks. In his bed, hoping that the
Draco cocked his head on the side and nodded. "Of course," he said. "Silly of me to think—"
He knew it was bad when Draco said “I love you.” Crouched behind the cover provided by an oak table on its side, the scent of burning hair lacing the smoke that filled the room.
make a good excuse for being a shit for a month," Parvati added. Ron gave her a wink before turning back to Harry, returning to a more serious tone.
"You said you weren't handing out compliments today," Harry teased. He held his hands behind him and rocked back on his heels, knowing full well that the pose pulled his t-shirt tight across his shoulders and chest. He felt up, buoyant, even, seeing Draco. He wished he could bottle the high of this feeling and keep it with him, take a swig when he needed the courage to pen an owl inviting him for a coffee. Couldn't it be so simple?
Harry hummed again. "Yeah, well, he's also never been the one taken on a proper date, you see, so he's not entirely sure how this goes."
"Does it feel good to be fucked like this?" Draco ground out the words, his movements coming fast and hard, the previous rolling pace replaced with sharp, wetly punctuated slaps of his hips against Harry's arse.
"Sorry for the—" he began to apologize about the pressure from all sides, the oppressive tightness characteristic of Apparition, but it was useless. Malfoy was already sprinting through the doorway, hands scrabbling at the neck of his robes.
"I don't know much about nature," he said after a time. "No one ever taught me, and I don't know where to start."
"He's not just any people, though," Harry said, annoyed. "We know Justin, and he's fine to have round for a bit of chat but—date? Him? Normally his prey's parents have to be landed fucking gentry for him to give them a second glance."
Harry twice checked over his shoulder that Malfoy wasn’t casting a complex curse on him. Malfoy would typically threaten him for even thinking of joining him in the kitchen while they were requisitioned on overnights. Being ignored instead and allowed to investigate was as decidedly unusual a turn of events as Malfoy mucking up a potion.
"You're so good to ask, young master Malfoy. The house is being pleased, so pleased to have you. If only the Master were to take an inventory, oh, he would be surprised at what the house has proffered lately! It is being a new day in the majestic House of Black, yes sir."
Harry nodded until he remembered that wouldn't do.
Harry laughed, deep and throaty.
Every pair of eyes in the room turned to Harry, then. For once, the feeling of being regarded was a welcome change from the numbness that had proceeded it.
, though."
He remembered the words from textbook readings.
"Yeah, mum, don't be glum," Ron said from the stairs, "Harry's not any better at dating blokes than he was with girls anyway."
"Be right back," he said, and Draco waved him off, an arm pulled tight around his torso against the cold.
," he enunciated with a little smile. "You'll be staying, yes? For breakfast, at least?"
Harry could practically see the Galleons swimming in her eyes as she spoke. He hummed approvingly in the appropriate places, zoning out, thinking unhelpfully of where he could find a cute someone to wink at and get handsy within a loo this time of day. He hadn't so much as touched another man since dancing up on Malfoy on his birthday, and that was weeks ago. Fantasies of pink-lipped somebodies on their knees, pressing feathery kisses to his cock—they'd overtaken his morning wank sessions. This same nymph-like twink was fast pressing in on his nighttime fantasies as well, and Harry knew he only had to find one such somebody to itch the scratch. He knew he looked half-decent when he tried, that he could pull someone—well, basically anyone, but that wasn't the point—if only he'd try.
"I—" Harry had a thousand questions, first and foremost
"Admit what?"
When Draco comes to, it’s to green eyes peering out at him from the darkness. Little fingertips wrap around the door, nails short and angry red at the edges from anxiety or overwork or both, the way no child’s should be. Draco blinks and the dream doesn’t flicker or fade away.
"Harry," Hermione whispered.
Harry couldn't wipe the smile off his face, try as he might. He continued to address his shoes, feeling every bit the giggling school-boy. "Hermione brought me once. Said that Ministry staff don't know about it, and it really was some of the best ziti I'd ever had. What's your excuse?"
for us, Harry," Ron said slowly. Harry cracked a smile.
"Why was it so shit?"
He made a mental note to buy her something nice to commemorate the moment, maybe drop in with it, and owl Ron to do the same.
"No, it's—good. It's fine." Harry brushed it off. "You shouldn't avoid topics because you presume I can't handle thinking about them. I'm not fragile."
"Permanent. Something that I couldn’t come back from."
"The park is much nicer if you've got to eat alone, take it from me," Harry said. "Far fewer conversations to overhear. And, you know. Sounds."
"I'm trying my hardest to parlay my Bachelor's into a Mastery in potions, but that plan's all gone tits up now," Malfoy said simply.
Draco’s eyes widened, as though this were the most damning evidence in the world. Harry widened his right back at him.
"Yeah, he's having his ear chewed off by mum right now. Angelina's staying here tonight—he's getting worse. Whenever he gets drunk, he gets mean—"
to being suddenly molested by a veritable sex god like yourself, but I need to ask you
He'd shaved today, and supposed that he should feel lucky for his strong jawline. A combination of Molly Weasley's hearty cooking and the Auror's strictly enforced exercise regimen had worked in tandem to add a few much-needed stone to his frame. The callouses on his palms were just starting to fade due to the difficulty he found in finding a time and a place to hop on a broom and get some flying in, but what little he had managed this summer had left his forearms bronzed, cheekbones and nose ever so slightly burnt.
Kreacher took another step back. "You mean mud—"
He wasn't running off, and he wasn't yelling, so Harry knew it was his time to pour it out—everything he'd stuffed down would be brought up and out, into the light.
But at least tonight had a plan, a neat little map to follow that would "Shape the narrative" — one of Victoria's favourite phrases.
"Incorrigible," he continued.
"You clearly haven't seen me dance," Draco quipped. "We called it an energy exchange—I worked night guard duty, and in exchange, I could take as many classes as I liked. I did it for a year, and when she had an opening for new teachers, I applied."
"I'm seeing Draco again," Harry announced. The words tumbled from his lips as he dipped his spoon into a melting mountain of Bertie Bott's Every Flavour Ice Cream later that night, not needing to look up to know the expressions on his friend's faces.
"You're too shit at healing charms to fix it yourself, then?" Harry asked after a beat. A dimple appeared in one pale cheek, Draco's eyelashes fluttering as he looked up to Harry for a moment. His look said the
, Potter, if you—”
," Draco panted, "please, more. I'll be good; come up here, please."
, drugs. I—it's legal. It's for my arm." He squeezed it unconsciously, one hand tightening and creasing the fabric of his jacket over the burned wrist. He squidged his lips to the side, deeply unhappy with the words he was being forced to speak. "Sobering charms don't work with potions. I'll ralph everywhere if we Apparate."
is me.
Smile, nod. Flash. Smile, nod. Stand still. Smile.
left the house last wearing clothes—were nowhere to be seen. The groan deepened as he looked at his hands, front and back. They were covered in glitter. So much glitter.
"That's it," Draco murmured as they fell into a rhythm, Draco’s grip eventually holding Harry’s head steady as he gently fucked his mouth.
"Ask Draco what you asked me," she said, giving him a little push of the shoulder so that he would totter over to their couch.
, Harry—"
He looked at Harry meaningfully, and something clicked.
The word clanged around in Harry's mind as he pulled his fingers free, whispering the spell to conjure oil, thick and slippery in his palm. He coated his own cock, long-neglected and rock-hard. It was going to be impossible, he thought, evident that his prick was far too thick for the tiny space his fingers had prepared.
Harry took the water and sipped, propped up on one forearm. He had rarely been naked like this with anyone, and he didn't want to dress yet. Draco's eyes raked across his body, lingering every everywhere, so he figured the longer he stayed naked, the longer he could stay, period. This was how he would steal some time while they were like this, after the storm.
"I thought you said you didn't date," Harry blurted. It ought to have surprised him that that was the first thought to come to mind.
He answers with a kiss to your knuckles and curls his fingers around yours. Bends his arm so your skin brushes vulnerable dip in his back. Leads you to bed.
"My sentencing? Today? They could, and they did, and I was perfectly fine with whatever the outcome. But no, that's not good enough for famous Harry fucking Potter, you just had to pry, had to—"
Next was the shower. Unlike the showers he had grown accustomed to at the Dursley's and later, Hogwarts, Grimmauld's water was always scalding hot, and he could stay in as long as he wanted to. The bathroom was one of the few decent spaces in the house, with its lush sword-fern gifted by Neville a few years back, and the single heavy mirror hung above the sink that occasionally joined in and harmonized with Harry when the tune was old enough that it recognized it. They had a hell of a time singing Auld Lang Syne together, though mostly when Harry was too blotto to recall all the lyrics.
you, and it tore me up to know it."
"Mmm-hmm." Draco took his wand and drew it along the wood's grain, making the dark lines sparkle gold for a few seconds until the glow faded out.
"Yes," Harry breathed. After all they'd done, naked and grunting, this was still enough to make his heart hammer with nervousness.
"Because he came and represented me at my sentencing, or are you actually going to sit there and pretend that he isn't your personal fucking counsel?"
"Don't apologize. I'm quite accustomed to being a dirty secret." Malfoy's tone was flat, and Harry really shouldn't care, why should he, this was
"Sure you do," Harry muttered through a grin, polishing off his first plate of food.
"What? It's just the house being happy, like a new coat of paint. It's—what, why would you—er."
"Hey—I'm right here, alright," Ron scoffed, trying and failing to fold his long legs into a comfortable position under the table, kicking Harry multiple times in the process.
Harry gasped, and Malfoy stopped speaking. He stopped moving altogether.
Only Harry and Ginny laughed at her joke, both of them snorting and then trying to cover for it, but Harry was beyond glad to be
Draco stopped breathing, blinked, in shock. He blinked quickly, those wondrous eyelashes fluttering, and as he opened his mouth to say something in response, Harry held a finger up, nearly brushing his lips.
"Should I fetch the potion?" he asked, wondering about the point of Dreamless Sleep when they no longer had to hide from the meanings of those nightmares.
"Yes, sir."
Harry shrugged. "Even if no one else does, at least the house approves."
His cheer stemmed from several new sources these days. He'd written and submitted a piece on reconciliations in early December, elucidating his thoughts on where work was required to not merely return the Ministry of Magic to its pre-Voldemort ways but to improve its mandate to serve all magical creatures. Unsurprisingly, Luna accepted it to run in The Quibbler, while to Harry's delight, the Prophet agreed to run it as an op-ed as well. Harry was booked in for interviews on WWN's radio and soon-to-launch television news segments as well, mostly about the memoir, but it was much more fun for him to focus on the present and the future than dwell on the past all the time. Draco sniffed at the final draft but hadn't said a harsh word about it, which was as good as an endorsement in Harry's books.
Harry held on behind one knee. Draco understood, rose up over him, and with the fluidity that came with practice, lined up and breached him.
Draco backed off immediately, fingers slipping from him and Harry was already choking out his answer to the unspoken edict. When Draco asked a question, he was to get a proper answer.
"Ten past," interrupted Ron. "I remember saying it, and you leaving. And then I had this awful feeling..."
"Sorry," he mumbled. "Bit strong." He pocketed his wand, flustered and tongue-tied again, though he knew he couldn't stand there staring at his nail-beds all night. He needed to say something quick and witty, a
"Susan Bones, good to see you too. I work for the Ministry now, Department of International Magical Cooperation. Potter here," Draco clapped Harry's shoulder, letting his hand linger with implied friendliness, "invited me along. I'm his guest today."
They touched each other less in public, though. Depending on where they were some touch was sanctioned, like kisses placed in the air, next to a cheek in greeting—but the casual acts of affection, a hand at the lower back, directing the other away from traffic or towards a window display of especial beauty—they became something to worry about, an itch in the brainstem to remain on high alert.
And against his best efforts to undermine himself and do something that would feel good in the short term, like set his barrister to destroy Barnabas Cuffe, or Apparate directly into Gawain Robards suite of offices at the Ministry and sock him squarely in the jaw, Harry had sat up from his chair, pulled his mobile from his back pocket, and had listened to Victoria when she picked up. Because though Victoria Cresswell had at times been a thorn in Harry's side, drove him to distraction, left him headachey, overworked and almost always overwhelmed, she'd always been in Harry's corner.
"Later," Harry said, and Draco nodded slowly, dazed. "Stay here a while, I'll go see who it is. And before you forget, you left your signet ring, the one with the black stone—it's in the kitchen. I put it on the ledge with the soap. Take as you long as you like up here, as long as you need, really, there's no rush—"
Harry’s bloodied finger looks blackened with ink in comparison when he slides it through a string. Draco’s gentle panting speeds up when Harry sneaks the doubly-wet finger back under the loosened hem of the bandages. His eyes flutter shut when the finger rubs the edge of the wound, dipping in only as deep as a nail before retreating.
"Look, Potter, if you're asking for my help, and I rather think you should because I'm something of an expert, I think you've been the regular kind of poisoned."
"You can."
Harry turned to look back at him, confused where this train of thought was going. Harry wanted to control his faculties—had to, couldn't imagine giving over power so wholly.
"Yeah," Ron nodded, moving towards the kitchen, "grabbing refills. Want another Harry?"
Draco nodded, "Exactly, yes. When they're whirring? Am I bothering you?"
"Can't we just try?" Cissy asked. Harry shook his head, and it was Cissy's turn to whine for once.
Harry was aware of Jessica's gaze on him from down the hall. He pinched the bridge of his nose, taking a breath in time with Draco's. This was a code all its own.
The truth will out.
Harry reminded himself of that time, a few months ago—the worst time—whenever he felt nervous about his plans. It was him, after all, who had thought up doing the biography—the story of his life, plain as day for anyone to read: no more secrets, no more lies. The dark would go in alongside the light, the ugliest things he'd ever done cheek-to-cheek with the most beautiful moments he'd had the joy of witnessing. In advance of the book coming out, he would too, and with everything out there, he'd be free. He wouldn't have to watch his tongue when speaking certain truths about Dumbledore or Snape. He could take a bloke on a date, a real date, not just a drunken one-night-stand with a Muggle that knew him as James. If it worked out well, he'd feel at peace enough to go back to the Auror's a regular man. Just Auror Potter, maybe, instead of the enigmatic, mysterious Harry Potter.
There was a long pause filled by the creaking sounds of the house and the sharp
"He...does..." Susan tried, poorly, to cover her shock at the situation. Draco removed his hand from Harry's shoulder and offered it to Susan's boyfriend, whose name Harry had forgotten as soon as he's said it.
"You've barely dated, so you don't know—blokes are rubbish." She threw her hand in a wide arc, as though she could encompass the city, the planet, in this statement. "Most blokes, they're not worth the breath of saying hello to them. This one sounds like a catch. Posh? Kinky? Kind? Fucking hell—I know we're friends and all, and this is terribly objectivizing, but the two of you, doing shit, randy as rabbits—sounds hot as balls to me."
Draco's name sprang up on the screen, which was strange because he knew Harry was in meetings all afternoon. He had Teddy, and they'd planned a trip to Diagon.
Draco clasped a hand to his mouth.
Something cold touched his face, Draco's fingers pulling off his glasses and hooking them into the neckline of his shirt. Harry gave himself a few experimental tugs and reached back up for Draco's cock, pursing his lips and coming up on his knees to just the right height to suck at the tip. Draco's question, sudden and earnest, took him by surprise.
"Me?" Harry asked. Malfoy choked on a laugh, huffing between sobs. He didn't bother hiding his crying, couldn't even if he tried.
His eyes skipped from head to head—this one too darkly haired, that one blonde, but in ponytails. "His Floo is shut, and his mobile line is dead. He probably changed the number."
Harry approached the armoire and heaved a sigh of relief. The answer was clear. There, among Draco's pearls and chains, in the centre of the jewellery bowl, were two silver rings. No longer intertwined, they now sat next to one another, separate, yet virtually indistinguishable.
"By going and getting your secret boyfriend who broke up with you on a
Everything felt a bit off all of a sudden, but Harry didn’t know how to right it. He wasn't entirely sure where he went wrong; what it was he said that had earned him this cold shoulder. If it was a cold shoulder. Maybe this was all entirely within the realm of normal for Draco, a man who felt no shame in telling him to
He curls his toes on the warmth of carpet inside, the scent of cold clinging to his clothes, dew and bits of grass wild at the tops of his feet.
"How do I make you feel?" Harry asked. Draco bit his lip, his eyes wet and pleading when he finally looked up into Harry's.
A week later, he was desperate to hop on a broom, get out of town, and do something. Ron and Hermione couldn't be fallen back upon—they were both busy with work, putting in gruelling hours that left little time for Harry's neuroses. His morning exercises turned into thrice-daily routines to calm his nerves; everything ached. He needed out, somehow, though he wasn't sure how or when in his foreseeable future.
They both pulled faster now, on the path to come again before the sweat on their bodies from the first round even had a chance to evaporate. Harry hooked a leg around Draco's hip to hold him close, his free hand cupping the back of his head.
He stepped through and was luckily not accosted by an errant gardening tool, and Draco quickly followed. The garden nook wasn't all that impressive, a few metres square, space enough for a picnic blanket or a hammock and not much else. The courtyard was visible from some rooms in the house, and its strongest feature was the new towering, spiky plant-life that filled the space.
Draco was silent, worrying a button on Harry's jacket. Once Harry had extricated himself from Robards' clutches, he'd Floo’d home, and all he'd wanted to do was sink into the couch cushions and, if he was lucky, doze off immediately. But Draco had other plans for him, had jumped them three times to bring him here, to the coast so very far from London. The path leading up a hill to the particular bench they now shared had long ago fallen into the sea, turning it into a rocky outcropping frequented only by sea birds and Draco. Another of his secret, quiet places.
"Your dance card," Harry repeated, "were you actually born in 1781? Because if you're a vampire or something, I can deal with that."
"Nothing. I don't know. I was feeling too much today, overthinking." His voice sounded wobbly to his own ears. He needed to empty his mind, feel nothing, not turn the feelings into words. This was a dangerous game.
"So you'll be Draco Black?"
“Nice haircut.” Harry’s tone was in opposition to the everyday nature of his words. He was ashamed that after so many years, even in a professional setting, something about Draco riled him instantly.
: That's a wrap, folks :) As always, thank you from the bottom of my heart for sticking around for this entire journey. I'm glad to mark this epic as complete, and embark on the next chapter (expect it late 2021).
, he thought,
The last forty-eight hours had been, in a word, chaos.
"I hoped you'd still be asleep," Ron said, taking a seat at the foot of the bed.
Bronze candlestick-holders and 14th-century coins popped up on side tables and inside of smooth walnut bowls that Harry swore he'd never seen before. Amulets and long chains of fine gold and chunky silver, and a beaten-up pair of silver rings, one woven through the other so that they made a chain of two appeared in Draco's tray of jewellery in the bedroom; when nobody was looking, their closet doubled in size and shawls of dark wools and silks and pieces of cashmere appeared. A matching black-marble inkwell and quill set appeared in the dining room next to the Floo one day, and all Draco had done was shrug and conjure some parchment to test the nib with.
"Not yet," Harry said. The moment felt precipitous, like they were on the edge of a cliff, and Harry hoped that Draco would hold his hand when they jumped.
Draco fixed him with icy eyes, and Harry felt like he was being seen through. He coughed and looked away, wishing for a distraction.
Harry knows now to begin. To take what’s his and play with it.
"And it's weird, yeah, us even talking to each other? You're you, and I'm me, and I can't tell if you even like my being around most of the time."
Harry set the sandwiches and items for a ploughman's platter down onto the centre of the table. He'd—quite skillfully, if he said so himself—put together a beautiful spread, especially in a kitchen rarely set to use by its owner who, through either derision or genuine unknowing, was little to no help locating anything. The promised bottle of Ogden's was at his seat, and he helped himself to a healthy pour while Malfoy built his plate.
"You, like this. I love doing this with you."
A wind picked up, moving tufts of clouds along at a pace to rival his own, and on occasion, the sun broke through and touched his skin, a warm kiss. He dashed across streets typically bustling with traffic, now virtually empty, tin cans and little bits of gold and silver flecks and streamers littering his path. He wasn't on his usual route but knew that he needed to run until he hit the point that his mind went something close to blank, and lately, it was taking longer and longer to get there.
Kreacher reappeared at his elbow, sliding an enormous ceramic mug full of builder's strength tea, cream and all, at his side.
"Sure, yeah," Harry picked lint from the hair on his forearm, a useless gesture, and forced a little smile. "I'm sure this is just a side effect of whatever was knocking around in my system. I'll be fine now."
"Nothing. What’s the matter?" Harry asked.
He took up his wand and brushed aside the spilt sugar and crumbs with a practiced flick, settling back into his chair.
Draco's wand's vibrations went off, sending the wood gently rattling about on his side table. He mumbled the incantation to stop the alarm and turned to pull Harry in close, contented sounds escaping him.
Pansy took a step back, aghast. Or, rather, melodramatically aghast. The whole scene was taking on a theatrical air, and Harry felt this was likely how Pansy and Draco communicated regularly. Draco lazed against the stack of pillows, flicking his wand to clear bits of food and drink from the bedspread.
"She's got good taste, that Granger. For a suit," Draco responded.
“Fuck,” Draco said the word like it had two syllables. “You want that, huh?”
"The summer I turned sixteen, she did the same."
“And here I thought this was a tony club,” Harry says, pushing up to sit straight, removing his forearms from the bar.
“Love-starved orphan? Yeah, it's come up,” He gave his most wicked grin to Draco, who was busy trying to look like he was disgusted, even as he ran his tongue along his bottom lip.
Cissy's brow fell to his as she bent further forwards, finding the right angle for it. Harry twisted his head and she nipped at the top of his earlobe.
. The fights that ended in slammed doors left Harry ashamed and Draco pretending, his face a mask of calm though his eyes betrayed a real fear, sometimes, and it was those fights that kept Harry going for more sessions with the Healer, and coming back changed, little by little.
"Everything's alright with me. Everything, at just this moment, seems grand."
"Then—"
"What wouldn't I get?" Harry asked carefully. He took a swig of his drink and wiped his mouth with the back of his hand. He hated this, hated the feelings Malfoy brought up.
"That's a yes, then. I thought so," Draco said. His eyes darted to Harry's lap, his only acknowledgement that he'd noticed the tremors before Harry could hide them. Then, lower. "Take a breath, Potter. This isn’t an interrogation. If you seem nervous, people will think I’m giving you a reason to be."
His own rapidly beating heart and shaking hands were quickly tamed as his drive to black-out waned. Draco dutifully provided him with a fresh vial of Dreamless Sleep each week, carefully portioned to avoid dependence. Harry weaned himself down to the bare minimum; enough to banish dreams, but not so much that he wasn't startled awake the first time Draco had a nightmare.
"How did they know? Those kids?" Harry asked.
"Yes, you are. You're allowed to be upset, you know."
“Here,” he said at last, “let me.”
Able to see clearly, he ascertained that he was, indeed, alone. Nothing felt broken, and he wasn't chained to anything. A peek under the covers confirmed that he was naked save for his pants and socks.
“Shut it—”
" Harry countered.
"What happens if I stray off the path?" Another drip threatened—what had he been
"Even so, I can't pull them off," Harry said, finding words again. "And you look great in them."
"And what would you like to do?" Draco asked at last.
"How do you do that?" Harry tore his eyes away from the sky to stare at Draco. "How do you know what I'm thinking all the time?"
"On the one hand, I have thought about how it would be viewed as a special sort of treason to certain members of my extended family. It must
he still thought, though the word was followed by the feeling of a box cutter making slits in his heart.
Harry was going mad.
"I'm here because I've got news for you. News you'd already know if you'd make yourself available in any normal way."
The man—a boy, really, he must be fresh from training—struggled to speak under all that cloth. "Uh, fuh, uhm, wait. Room, um, one. Room one."
"Interesting. What were you doing at Gollybean, then?"
"Too right. I think she's embarrassed—cries over nothing, this one."
"I'm using a charm," Ron said good-naturedly as he stopped to give her a peck on the cheek and ambled over to Harry's right side.
, he thought, dropping his Occlumens into place too late to keep such thoughts from her. He raised a brow at the sealed scroll of parchment on the tray, and Mordred rose hers right back at him. "I was going to give it to him anyway. Do not try to open it yourself—it is charmed for his eyes only."
Pansy considered him with her tongue stuck in one cheek.
"Well, the way you can be helpful right now is to stop giving me lip about wanting greasy foods while laying down. I’ve had a bad day, and I saw some Muggles eat pizza in bed on the telly, so it must be a done thing. You can banish the crumbs after." He huffed a little. "Do you want me to suck your cock or not?"
making him laugh. He took a drag of the cigarette and coughed, banishing the stub before he kept trying and failing to smoke it properly.
"I know all about football, and electricity, and the Queen, and the periodic table now," he said in a rush. "Muggles may not have magic, but they're ingenious in their own ways. They run most of the world, not us."
"She's fine. Nutty, worried sick, obviously. She'll be by again to see you after work today." Ron leaned against the wall as he clicked in a text message, throwing scrutinizing looks Harry's way every few seconds. "You've been practising your hugs, haven't you?"
"Oh, and Harry—"
"I worry," Harry said. Ron took up the post to his right again and also studied the heads in the room. Harry began to feel antsy.
"Sure." Ginny gave him a wry look, gold eyeshadow dotting the insides of her eyes, a wicked cat-eye lending her an added dose of mischievousness. "I'd love to have a drink in my hand first. And one for Nev, too—something
Mum, the sun's hardly even set," which drew laughs from Charlie and at least a few others who were out of sight. Mrs Weasley tried to dab at her eyes casually, as though she wasn't crying at all. Mr Weasley squeezed tightly at her shoulder, and Harry would be damned if the old man wasn't getting misty-eyed behind the lenses of his glasses.
Harry broke the silence before it could get too awkward.
Because against all his better judgement, Harry started to crave it. Him. Draco.
"NO!" Draco exploded, his shout renting the air.
On one hand, it was his chance at a family, one they could build and grow into together. It introduced a possibility he'd basically written off. Adoption was something to dream about, years and years into the future. It had only just become legal to adopt in a same-sex couple or as a single person in England, and that was for Muggles. The case for the same would go to the Wizengamot in the fall, and it wasn't a clear-cut win. Only as a godparent did he have a clear, legal precedent to apply for conservatorship of a child.
That perked Harry's ears right up. "Meaning what, exactly?"
, Draco," he hissed, and then he slapped himself, the sound an angry crack and the cheek he hit so suddenly angry red that Harry hardly believed it was real. "You stupid, stupid idiot." He did it again, and this time Harry raised his hand, feeling his magic spring up as though from a deep reservoir, holding it back at the last second from escaping his fingertips. He couldn't control Draco, would never lose control and let his magic free on him again, not even when seeing Draco hurt cost him something.
The wings of the snitch fluttered against his skin, colder than ice and heavy in his fist. It had been a clean win, whatever Ginny's groaning might lead one to otherwise believe. And even though the equipment was for home use rather than regulation standard, with a heavy, slow snitch and lighter quaffles that bounced off their marks rather than landing with bone-smashing ferocity, the game had managed to rouse the same effervescent feeling in Harry it always had managed to during his youth.
"Ah," Draco said. He went quiet, strange for him, his face a study in restraint. Whatever the thoughts, it was better than the look of alarm he'd given before.
"Yes, thank you, Edward, we'll be cautious of the slugs," she said, turning to share a bemused look with Harry.
"The money was made out as a donation, and the transfer can't be reversed. What's done is done, but now they're looking for a bit of reciprocity."
He swallowed and looked down at his book, flipping through random pages as his cheeks burned.
