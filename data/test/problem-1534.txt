“I’m sorry, Harry. How are you feeling?”
“Your cousin,” he replied. “Sirius. Voldemort had recently returned and I was feeling his emotions and seeing things, and I was afraid I was becoming a terrible person.” He shook his head. “We were standing in front of the family tree he’d been burned off of.”
“How do you know he didn’t want the others?”
“So why do you have the baby?” Malfoy asked as he was counting the coins.
“Halloween,” he said. He swallowed and continued, “I went to visit my parents. I couldn’t see anyone else for the week. It would’ve been too much.” He swallowed again, his throat feeling thick. Narcissa nodded.
“There’s nothing to indicate that anyone has ever actually been in possession of all three,” Hermione said, “so there’s nothing for us to go on with this. No one knows what it means to be-” She stopped herself short, seemingly unwilling to actually say it out loud.
Narcissa looked at him softly, a look which seemed utterly out of place on her stern face. “He meant a lot to you,” she remarked, and Harry looked away. He could tell her about his desperation for a family, and how Sirius had fulfilled both father and brother roles, but it suddenly seemed like too much.
“His mother was my cousin,” Malfoy said, and Harry stared - that wasn’t the reaction he’d been expecting. Still, he nodded in response. “You’re not raising him?” Harry shook his head.
When Harry walked into the tea shop, Narcissa was already there. She looked the same and yet different. Her clothes were still impeccable, but there were slight signs of wear around the edges. Her hair was pulled back tightly but there seemed to be more grey in it. She regarded Harry coolly as he approached. He’d worn a button-down and slacks, though he still looked much more casual than she did. As he sat down, the waitress asked for his order, and he gave it.
“The tales say that makes me the master of death,” he said quietly. Narcissa made a slight choking sound. “I don’t know what it means exactly, but I’m able to do things now that I shouldn’t be able to. I can control my magic better than ever. I’ve barely had to practice to master wandless and wordless spells. Sometimes I just know what’s going to happen next, what magic is coming my way before the caster themselves knows.”
“A baby broom?” Andromeda asked, and Harry turned his charming grin on her.
“Well, I finished that potion for you and figured you’d want it as soon as possible.” He gestured to the case at his feet. Harry frowned.
“I’d best be going,” he said. “I’m sure they’re wondering where you’ve gone.” He gestured at the house while starting to turn away. “Owl me if there’s a problem with the potion.”
However, there were still things that Harry still couldn’t talk about with her. A few nights before Halloween night, he Owled her to tell her that he would be missing that week’s tea date. He didn’t offer an explanation, and the lack of one seemed to tell Narcissa not to ask, because she didn’t. Instead, Hermione Floo’d to Grimmauld, where Ron was already sitting at the kitchen table, nursing a mug of tea. They waited a few minutes before Harry appeared. He held out his arm, and the three of them Apparated.
“His name is Teddy Lupin,” Harry replied flatly, arching a brow as if challenging Malfoy to pull away. He didn’t, but he did go still.
“Goodbye Harry,” she said, and swept out of the shop.
Narcissa didn’t speak immediately, as was her way. She took a moment to absorb what he had said. “Wizards have attempted to understand death and the afterlife for centuries. Even with all our magic, I don’t think we’ll ever truly know. You know the Tale of the Three Brothers?” Harry bit back a smile and nodded. “Most wizards call it a bedtime story, a fantasy to tell our children. He believed that there was truth to it, and he was right. About the wand, at least.”
Regardless of why he was doing it, when Narcissa’s letter returned to him, he leapt up to get it. The owl hooted softly when he absentmindedly ran a hand over its feathers, taking the envelope from its claws.
Remember when I said I'd be posting more often? Yeah, so, that was a lie. I got about two paragraphs into this chapter and got stuck for about two months but here it is.
(See the end of the chapter for
Malfoy shrugged. “Do you want it or not?”
His mind immediately wandered straight back to Malfoy. After he’d cast his spell, it was like Harry could feel him, like he could see inside Malfoy and Malfoy could see him too. He’d wanted more, and had enveloped Malfoy even further, reacting on instinct when Malfoy swayed, unsteady. Once they were that close, it was like something else took over, and he wanted to feel and to show Malfoy what it meant. The kiss had been good - more than good really, and Malfoy had responded enthusiastically, but there was no way it could be that simple. He’d kissed his childhood rival, his (former?) enemy, the one person in the world that might be able to understand Harry, and then he’d practically run away. So much for Gryffindor bravery.
After dinner and dessert (and then more dessert), everyone moved to sit by the tree and exchange presents. The usual Christmas sweaters made the rounds, including a tiny one for Teddy, who was sitting with Harry on the floor and tearing at all the paper-wrapped presents Harry set in front of him. Thanks and jokes and light-hearted teases were exchanged all around as gifts were opened until the floor was more paper than carpet and at least three people were wearing bows on their heads.
Harry watched Malfoy start to walk down the path towards the apparition point. “Happy Christmas, Malfoy,” he called. Malfoy paused, his head turning just slightly. He didn’t say anything, though, and kept walking. Teddy tucked himself back into Harry, hair black and nose cold against Harry’s neck. “Alright, kiddo, let’s get inside.”
“Sirius bought me one for my first Christmas,” he said, and Andromeda didn’t say another word after that.
After a few minutes of deliberation, he shrugged and pulled out a vial, uncapping it and pouring the strangely tasteless liquid down his throat. As he swallowed it down, a thought occurred to him that had him tossing aside the empty vial and moving to kneel in front of the chest at the end of his bed. Opening it, he shuffled through a few items before pulling out a length of shimmering fabric. He let the invisibility cloak slide through his hands for a moment, remembering all that it had gotten him through, before finally throwing it over his head.
Harry, Teddy, and Andromeda spent the morning together while Teddy tried out all his new toys, including the broom that Harry explained was full of protective charms, like Cushioning charms for falls and run-ins and Stabilizing charms to keep him in the air. Unfortunately, the Cushioning charms protected the child but not Andromeda’s cabinet of fine china. Harry sheepishly Reparo’d the dishes while Andromeda assured him that they were Black heirlooms and hardly her most prized possessions.
Harry hums his acknowledgement.  “My dad and his mates became animagi for Remus while they were still at Hogwarts.”  He shares.  It is a story he hasn’t told in a long while.  But it's one of his favorites about his father and his friends.  “So he wouldn’t be as lonely or afraid during the full moon.  They’d all go out to the Shrieking Shack and wait it out together.”
“I did worse.”  He reassures Potter simply.  Thinking of the mark on his forearm covered by his sleeve.
“But he isn’t –
Despite the awkwardness, it was still the most pleasant child’s birthday Draco had ever attended.  The birthday parties of his youth were very formal affairs.  He never lacked for presents certainly, but that was not the purpose of those events.  They were opportunities for families to show off their children to each other.  Begin to consider who might make a good match one day.
Yet she knew him and the boys.  Despite being stowed away and sealed.  It was damned difficult to cut off an object’s sentience.  Its connection to a place.  He – of all people – should know.
Regardless, Draco is grateful to be out of the spotlight.  The last time his name was in the Daily Prophet was over ten years ago.  He had naively hoped to keep it that way upon his return to Britain.  Wanting to live a quiet but fulfilling life focusing on his work.  The minute he agreed to Harry’s request to start meeting outside of their professional relationship, the clock began counting down to the end of his sacred anonymity.
It had been a laugh that he should look like this.  An offense to nature.
“No.”  Robards replies tersely, breaking the stare.  Looking deliberately around the room, expression tight.  “Isn’t it possible, that there are people Malfoy never talked about from his time as a death eater?  People he didn’t view as dangerous then.  Someone his age or younger like Junge who continued to believe in Riddle’s cause?  Or not be entirely opposed to dark magics?”
“I will, thank you.”
Al’s the only one who wants to listen to all that.”
They arrive midair in a whoosh.  Reappearing midair inside the domed portion of the Belgian Ministry of Magic’s travel department.  He and Harry float easily down to the floor.  Draco made certain he was on Harry’s right side in case the landing was rougher.  Their luggage alights behind them.
since that oversight hearing.”  Robards reasons, cutting a glance back to Harry.  “I say we bring him in.  See what he has to say.”
Jamie sighs.  He liked Luna and he knew his parents were good friends with her, but sometimes she was just plain odd.  “Would you come in here please?”  He requests tersely.
is the word to use.”
They stow Maud back in the loo, hastily change, and go to breakfast before Draco comes to check on them.  The smell of bacon enticing them to the table.  Nothing seems out of the ordinary when they arrive.  Mrs. Malfoy, Draco, and Lily are already there.  Dressed and ready for the day like usual.  One of the house elves Mrs. Malfoy brought with her is serving them.  Pitcher of pumpkin juice floating around the table filling glasses and toast buttering itself.  He and Al slide into their seats as Draco dismisses the elf and helps Lily fix the cloth napkin tucked into his sister’s collar.
“I believe that she is still able to gather information about the inhabitants of this house.  I find that rather disturbing given the current restrictions on her although she appears incapable of doing anything truly malicious beyond verbal abuse.”  Draco theorizes.  The particularly ominous threat she issued to him, ‘You shall not escape your fate’ still rang in his ears, after the fact.  He had no idea what that meant.  Nor did he care to find out.  It got so tiring when relations made such foreboding pronouncements.
“Braiding.”  Draco replies distractedly, hairpin in his mouth.  Brow furrowed in concentration.
intimate with anyone before.  I am not
“Oh, Harry.”  Hermione says with a heavy sigh after he tells them about the argument.  “You’ve really put your foot in it this time.  Please,
“Merlin, look at you.”  Pansy comments scathingly.
“Tell me.”  He demands watching.  Getting Draco to talk about them fucking was nearly as good as the act itself.
“You can go faster.”  Harry suggests none too casually.
“Yeah?”  He and Al question together.  Lily picks her nose.  “So?”
So why not?
“Me too, Potter.”  Draco answers.
“Do you remember when we went to visit Luna?  After Jamie was born?”
He recalls going in and out of consciousness at the time.  Hoping to just pass out from the searing pain.  Harry was no stranger to pain.  He could work through it when necessary, but he was already at the wizarding hospital and dearly wished to wake up to the
anymore.  Who knows what you’d do to the bacon?  I can’t take that chance.”
“Oh, yes.  I know this one,” Draco says, expression turning triumphant.  “And I wondered where James gets it.”
Harry moves to hug his former mother-in-law.  Resting his cheek on the crown of her head as Molly squeezes him back.  She was the best hugger.  It never failed to make him feel like he belonged with them.  Like he was twelve years old again and getting the first taste of parental affection.
“We never talk about the war.”  Draco states shortly, blinking once.  “Not in depth anyway.  We’ve done very well avoiding that particular topic.”
Draco had not planned for this.  He should have.  It was foolish of him not to prepare.  Idiotic even.  He was okay with coming up with Potter last night.  Excited.  Eager even.  But it hits him how new this all is to him making him nervous all of the sudden.  The dating.  The staying overnight.  This is asking too much, yes?
“Great.”  Harry says, taking the box.
you!”  Comes a familiar, cheery voice.
Lucius sneers.
This seems not the thing to say though as Malfoy goes to sit back at his desk with a dramatic sigh, leaning his forehead into his hands.  “You’re perfect.  Damn it, of course you are.”
So Kreacher has his own room now too.  Not that he uses it for himself.  Still preferring to spend most of his time in the kitchen cupboards and pantry.  If Jamie was a house elf that’s where he would live too.  That way he’d have all the biscuits to himself.
The only bad part about Teddy visiting was that meant Jamie had to sleep in Al’s room.  Teddy got his bed when he stayed over.  Technically, it was Teddy’s bed first and Jamie just took it over after he started Hogwarts but whatever.
a couple.  This is happening.”
and not hiding from literally every person they know.  “Which part?”  He asks for clarification.  Suddenly curious.
He loved it.  Harry was not so different from those storms.  All-encompassing and powerful.
“No.”  Greg dissuades with a heavy wave of his hand.  “I doubt he even knows where I am.  Probably figures I’m dead.  He never cared much for me.  It’s just that Khady . . . she wants to have children.”
Thank Merlin he was knocked out then.  Albeit by a hasty charm from a very stressed looking healer.  He woke up two days later in a cold sweat with what felt like a hairball in his throat and the prickling sensation of pins and needles from the chest down.  He remembers looking tiredly to the side, head heavy, to see Ginny sitting beside his hospital bed.
“It hurt you what happened.”  Draco comments softly.
“My relatives are buried in this cemetery.”  Draco answers, tearing off some errant twigs from a section of the fallen tree he is inspecting.  “I didn't know most of them. This graveyard is quite old, a few centuries at least, and there are no ghosts here.”
The small, high-ceiling room he waits in contains a bare metal table and two chairs.  One configured for chains to hold a prisoner.  It takes almost an hour for his father to be brought in and secured to his seat.  Draco had begun to wonder if he would even come.  Father could theoretically refuse personal visits.
“He did?”  Draco asks, embarrassment hanging on.  He can imagine the expressions on Mr. and Mrs. Weasley’s faces.  They have been kind to him.  Kinder than he deserves, but he knows that every Weasley is baffled by their relationship.  A lot of people were though the Howlers had slowed over the last few weeks.
“Thank you.”  Draco replies.
“I did.”  He concurs.  Recalling the flashes of terrified faces.  Draco’s was one of the few he consistently recognized.  It was how he knew the other man was alive during the war.  “It looked terrible.”
“And what say you, sir?”  The councilmember prompts.
“I love Draco.”  Lily declares, playing with the syrup on her nearly empty plate.  Getting it all over her hands.  “He’s my other daddy.  He takes care of me and Al and Jamie and Daddy.”
It is all he knows to do.  Pansy used to do this when they were at Hogwarts when he was upset.  It always soothed him.  He can do this now for Harry, who practically purrs in contentment, arms squeezing him affectionately.
Lucius grimaces, expression souring.  “Only a Malfoy heir can take control of the estate.  The main structure will accept no one else.  It was designed that way centuries ago even if it is in ruins the core will remain.”
It is a good Yule.
Another stark difference from his father.
“I know, James.”  Dad sighs.  It must be important.  This story.  Dad called him James after all.
“What are you on about?”  Ian questions, already sounding annoyed.
It sounds like Dad gets out of the bed and the next thing Jamie knows, Draco walks through the entryway, clad in pajamas, and holding Lily who is crying her eyes out.  Draco raises a questioning eyebrow at them while patting Lily on the back.  Jamie thinks this is the messiest he has ever seen Draco’s hair and he’s never seen Draco in pajamas.  Or with bare feet.  It's bizarre.  Part of him assumed Draco slept in his regular posh clothes.
Draco stares at him.  Harry realizes how tightly he is holding onto him and relaxes his grip.  Leaving his hand there.  Afraid Draco will turn on the spot and apparate away.  “I’m really much smoother than this I promise.”  Harry asserts, voice hoarser now after yelling.
They have never had uninterrupted time like this with one another.  There was always some responsibility or facet of life that diverted them.  Now, Draco luxuriates in Harry’s undivided attention.  Confident that Harry is as happy as he is and equally as focused on being together.  The heady emotion between them intoxicating.
“Busy morning?”  Harry asks around a mouth full of food.
“Any time,” He reassures.  “But I don’t recommend you go beyond the village.  The further you get from here the more likely it is you’ll come across a witch or wizard.  I’ve put anti-apparation wards here and around the village perimeter.  Wizards don’t come here.  They’ve no reason to.”
“That is some marvelous spell work.”  Draco comments, impressed.  The most charmed jewelry typically could hold was five active spells.  Seven was ambitious.
“Ridiculous conjecture.”  Whitacre complains, “We don’t have time to waste on petty gossip, Robards.  I thought this was about a real problem – not Potter’s social life.  No offense, Harry.”  She adds, not unkindly.
“Oh, dear, never mind that,” Mrs. Tonks interrupts, reaching out to rest her hand comfortingly on her sister’s arm.  “You remember those early days being in love.  Everything is so . . . urgent then.”
He receives dozens of invitations to charity functions each year.  It used to be he would try to attend as many as he could.  But then as fatherhood arrived and he had to balance that with work, he backed off.  He did try to attend some annual events that supported causes closest to his heart.  One of his favorites he had been giving to for years was a creatures’ rights organization.  His interest in that was inspired primarily by Remus and Dobby as well as other friends he made over the years.
“You did not know him well.  He was an awful lot like you in his younger years: bright, inventive, passionate in his beliefs even when misguided though determined to redeem himself.”
“Nothing.”  Harry bluntly answers.  He had expected during the death eater trials to get a letter pleading her husband and son’s cases, but one never came.  His account of Draco and Lucius’ actions during the war likely helped Draco as much as it damned Lucius.
“Yeah, I guess so.”  He grudgingly allows after a moment.  Observing his best friends consider him.
“Draco.”  He tries, trying for conciliatory.  Equal feelings of guilt, frustration, bone-deep weariness roiling through him.
“Let me take care of you.”  Potter says directly, chasing the palm on his cheek with his lips.  “Let me make you feel good.”
Jamie is not willing to see if she is bluffing or not.  The desserts she makes are too good and he’s no idiot to risk that.
His boyfriend harrumphs, indignant.  “No one has that amount of intense eye contact with me
“Sprogs,” Dad says, getting their attention.  “You might have noticed that Draco visits more than anyone else.”
“Yeah.”  He confirms, a grin forming on his face.  “Sirius was loyal above all else, but he was clever and fun too.  That’s why he took that form.  They’re like our patronuses – the animagus form – they reflect our core selves.”
“She can’t have just disappeared!”  He says trying to restrain his panic.  “We’ll have to search the manor!”
“I never thought I’d get a chance to do this.”  Draco says, expression suddenly shy, bringing the hand holding Harry’s to his chest.  “I’m glad it’s with you.”
“I demonstrate spelling every day.”
paranoia, Potter.  I am not so simple as to assume I am free to move about as I please – not in Britain.”  As if to demonstrate the hypocrisy of this statement, Malfoy jumps to his feet to pace the office floor.  “At least, be honest with me, Potter.  If there is anything about
He hated it.  All of it.  But mostly he had hated himself – that he was too much of a coward to run away.  Afraid of what would happen to his parents if he did – particularly his mother.  The same woman who begged him to leave her but would not leave her husband.  The manor encapsulated all of it for him.
“Like boyfriends?”  Al wonders aloud.  Tilting his head questioningly to the side.  This is news to Jamie too.  He supposes it makes sense though – that must be what he was noticing when Draco was with Dad.  Why it seemed different than Dad’s other friends.  If he thinks about it, Dad does touch Draco more than other adults.  He always had a hand on Draco like he might get lost or something.  Grimmauld was a big house but it wasn’t
the manor so obviously she should live with them.  Besides, where would she live otherwise?  The forest?  The problem was getting Dad and Draco on board with letting them keep her.
Dad snorts.  “I’m surprised to hear you say that.  I thought you preferred Snape.”
It starts with a promise.  A life debt to be precise.
that, Hermione.”  Harry replies tersely.  “However, the situation was easily a level three and I was well within my rights to call them.”
Jamie suspects Mrs. Malfoy didn’t anticipate her responding.  The older woman hesitates for a split second before gesturing gracefully to the other guests.  “Mr. Scamander this is Neville and Hannah Longbottom.  I believe you are already acquainted, Ms. Lovegood.  Our other companion is my sister Mrs. Tonks.”
Harry gives the woman a curt nod and the two of them are off.
“What should we do?”  Harry immediately asks Hermione.  He has never seen an oversight hearing recommend Veritaserum before.  The whole thing strikes him wrong, but he is uncertain if court would be much better.  There would be news coverage.  Evidence, whatever it was, aired publicly.  And Harry
noticed.  His boyfriend has a bottle of something in his hands when he sits beside Harry on the bed with his professional face on.
“I need to go home.”  Draco says, voice quiet and gaze far away.  Harry has the impression his boyfriend is about to pass out.
Harry feels wrong-footed.  Unsure.  He clears his throat.  “Since we started - have you ever thought I –
Malfoy’s brow furrows at that.  “Why?”
Potter grins lighting up.
Draco squirms.  Fighting with himself.  His boyfriend was usually uncomfortable talking about sex, but Harry did prefer Draco communicate his sexual wants when it was just the two of them.
The Granger-Weasleys follow them as they head toward the nearest floo.  Harry recognizes the cadence in Hermione’s voice as she flies through what just happened.  She and Ron are about to have an epic row.  Harry would bet big money on it.  But he does not have time to feel whatever guilt or vindication about that now.
Pansy titters beside them.  Dressed in a lacy purple cocktail dress and looking a bit unsteady on her stiletto heels.  She kisses Draco’s cheek, leaving a faint lilac lipstick mark behind.  “Draco, you’re here!”  She welcomes her friend loudly, sounding a bit drunk.  Nearly empty martini in hand.
“I’m sorry, Harry.”  They hear Teddy apologize in the bedroom over.  “I didn’t mean to make her cry.”
“You got them all correct.  Well done, James!  You’ve worked hard.”  He sincerely congratulates, a bit embarrassed at the change in his tone.  He might bloody well cry.  Mordred and Morgana, what has become of him?
“I’ll come with you!”  Lily shouts, running as best she can over to Draco to pull at his coat with her mitten clad hands.  “We can even bring Daddy!”
“God, bloody hell, Draco.”  Harry grunts, jacking them both and watching Draco fuck the hand trying to hold them.  Harry bites his lip.  Attention only on the sensation of Draco sliding against him.  The feel of Draco moving above him is delicious, muscles working up friction with his own movement to meet him.
“Well, they like you.”  Harry states.
“I love you.”  Draco tells the man before him quietly.  He does not say it enough.  Every time he does it is vulnerable, but it is also incredibly rewarding to see that same emotion reflected at him in the other man’s green eyes.
The man gives him an incredulous look.  “I’ve been in Azkaban since I was seventeen, Potter.  The closest thing I had to a romantic relationship was a messy snog session with Pansy at the beginning of sixth year, and I have to say, it was not exactly memorable.”  Draco drawls.
“I would be thrilled to host the both of you.”  Simone offers.  “Any time, really.  I owe Draco about five years of my share of the rent.”
for Harry.  “But they don’t know what goes on behind closed doors, do they?  They don’t know how much – how far – you’ll go to get your hands on me.”
“Ron!”  Hermione rebukes, sitting up straight and giving her husband a sharp look.
“Penelope Clearwater.”  Anthony supplies.
“There’s nothing to forgive.”  He asserts.  Hoping Draco can see how sincerely he means what he is saying.  How serious he is.  “But you have to hear me now, okay?”
“No.”  Harry reassures. “Just be yourself.  He likes you fine.  If he didn’t, we’d know.”  Draco imagines Harry would know best.  He does not press it further, and Harry waves his hand, turning off the bedroom lights.
Draco feels badly for him.  Harry tried so hard to be a good father.  He was a good parent.  Draco knew this as a fact, but his boyfriend occasionally had doubts.  He had shared how poorly he was raised by those muggles and the few parental role models he had were only present during the later years of his childhood.  Harry feared being neglectful to his own children.  That he would do something harmful unknowingly.
It is like being lit from the inside out.  Stronger than any euphoria elixir he has ever tested - and he has tested his share.  If he was going to have a burst of accidental magic it would be right at this moment.
and that’s not been happening.”
“How ‘bout us?”  Harry asks his boyfriend.
have children too.”  Draco rejoins, pointing out Harry’s illogic.  “And if I recall correctly, the children became used to respecting the more fragile items at my flat.”
“Talk to me.”  He says, voice low.
“Papa.”  Harry teases when they break apart.
The lights dim twice in quick succession, indicating the main event.  Harry watches the emcee gesture grandly to Hargreeves as he arrives at the podium.  He looks as though his house elf did not warn him against hors d’oeuvres.  Harry feels jealous.
“You can say no.”
“Well, I guess winter is coming.”  He retorts guffawing at his own joke.
Olta greets them cheerily, springing into action once she takes in Draco’s visage.  Going into the kitchen to brew tea and put together some food to nosh on.  Harry is grateful for the elf as he leads Draco to the bedroom.  Draco sits, leaning against the cypress headboard and holding on to one of the slats as he rests his head against it.
The woman attempted to straighten herself further on shaky arms as the house elf attempted to assist her.  Her eyes hard on him despite her pained expression.  “Yes.”  She stated gravely.
“Are you captain of the team this year?”
When she left, he looked at Narcissa. “Hi,” he said.
“Why did you want to meet?”
“Yeah, so I can stay asleep through the night.” He watched as Hermione unscrewed the top to take a sniff, then put it back on and shake it lightly.
Ron and Hermione were already there, setting the table and adding the finishing touches to the tree. “I dare you to snog at this Christmas Party,” Harry teased. They both flushed bright red, all the way to the tips of Ron’s ears. Hermione took a swipe at him and he just grinned at them. “Happy Christmas,” he said, and dragged his best friends into a hug. They returned the embrace and for a moment, they were just best friends celebrating Christmas and it was like the war had never scarred their lives. Then Ginny came running into the room to literally throw herself at Harry and climb onto his back, laughing and begging him to save her, followed shortly after by George wielding one of the joke shop’s latest inventions threateningly. Chaos ensued and the battle ended with Ron sitting on top of Harry to keep him down, George chasing Ginny in circles around the tree, and Hermione watching fondly but disapprovingly when Bill and Fleur walked in and caused another riot of activity while they all went to greet the pair. Not long after, Charlie and Percy came through the Floo, nearly on top of one another, which started a new argument that ballooned to involve every Weasley in the house.
Harry and Narcissa fell into a routine of meeting every week at the same Muggle shop. In addition to seeing Teddy, it was one of the few things he actually had to look forward to in his life. Ron spent more time at Grimmauld Place with Hermione gone, though they kept up a steady correspondence. Harry had a feeling that some of that correspondence was about him, but he didn’t mind so much. It was difficult to keep his weekly visits from Ron, but he wasn’t ready to explain something he didn’t fully understand himself.
“We've all got both light and dark inside us. What matters is the part we choose to act on. That's who we really are.” He felt tears come to his eyes, unbidden. Narcissa noticed.
“What’s that?” Narcissa asked. Harry felt a small, bittersweet smile tug at his lips.
“What was he like as a kid? You were at Hogwarts at the same time too. Tell me what you remember.”
“Yeah. I don’t think anyone will find it. Sometimes I wish I still had it, but then I remind myself what it does to those it calls back.”
“And what about the cloak? He never wanted it?”
Harry stumbled his way back up the stairs and towards the Floo in a haze. Guests were beginning to leave in small clusters, and he pushed through them to throw himself into green flames and shout for Grimmauld Place.
Narcissa tilted her head slightly. “You’ve thought about this a lot.”
I'm finally getting to the good part so this one is a lot longer than the others. I'm hoping that I'll be able to continue making them this long. Hope you enjoy it, and I'd love to hear your thoughts!
“He was there when I needed him. Until he wasn’t.” Narcissa nodded, and then began to speak.
They both paused and looked at each other. When he looked at her, he didn’t feel the same as he used to. He looked at her and knew he’d always love her, that she would always be important to him, but it wasn’t what it used to be. She finally stepped forward and pulled him into a hug. “How are you?” she asked.
When he landed, he stumbled forward out of the fireplace and into the sitting room. Ron and Hermione had apparently gathered enough of their senses to move to their bedroom, but Kreacher entered the room to stare at him querulously. “Master Potter,” he said, “do you require assistance?”
"When he tried to kill me, our spells met in the middle and it forced his wand to show it’s last spells, all of which were killing spells. Specters appeared from the wand - Cedric, an old man, and my parents. They all spoke to me. Cedric asked me to take his body back to his father. My parents-” he broke off for a moment. “My parents told me to hang on, to keep fighting. They told me they’d create a distraction as soon as I broke the thread of magic and I had to get out of the graveyard. The way they spoke to me - I knew that it really was them. I don’t know if they’re in heaven or if they’re spirits or what it is, but I know that they were with me that night, and they watch over me even now. It makes it easier to know that.”
“He only cared about the wand. The other two things weren’t important to him. Who would he resurrect? Who did he have need to hide from?”
Harry knew that he was coming closer to telling her the whole truth, but for some reason he didn’t care if she knew. “How do you know about the stone?”
When he looked at Ron and Hermione, he found them looking thoughtful. Hermione spoke first. “Harry, if she’s really changed, then I understand. I don’t think I can ever see her the way you do, but I don’t have to. I just have to support you.” She looked at Ron.

Narcissa’s face was even paler than usual, and her grip on the edge of the table was harsh. “Be careful. These things are not meant to happen. And if other people know-”
This is my first fic I've actually been dedicated to, and I really appreciate the responses I've gotten so far. Let me know what you think!
Wait, remember when I wrote that^ and saved this as a draft and it's now been like several months? I do unfortunately. Well, I never claimed to have executive function. Thanks to those that have commented recently, your comments have really helped me keep up the energy to write this (or at least think about writing it)
“I saw him. That night at the Manor, he was so angry that he was called because he was trying to get information out of Gregorovitch about the wand. He might’ve even been there in time to stop us if Gregorovitch hadn’t wasted his time. Then I watched him take it from Dumbledore’s grave.”
“So you have been in possession of all three Deathly Hallows,” Narcissa said, wonder in her voice.
I'm finding all kinds of things that I wish I'd edited before I posted but my philosophy seems to be "no edits we ide like mne"
The familiar ache spread through him, a darkness that spidered through his veins. He thought longingly of the Resurrection Stone, but was also glad that it was lost to him forever so that he would never abuse it. One hand pressed against the stone, and for the first time in ages, real tears spilled down his cheeks. He was aware of Ron and Hermione behind him, but when he spoke, it was only to his parents. “I miss you so much,” he choked out. “I miss you every day, and sometimes I just think how unfair it all is and then I remember...I remember seeing you both, in the graveyard and in the forest. I don’t know where you are but I know that you were there with me those days. I know that wherever you are, you still know me. I would do anything to have you back, to have erased everything from the last eighteen years. I would do anything.”
He wasn’t entirely sure what he was doing, and he felt silly being invisible in his otherwise empty home, but he hoped that by using one of the Hallows he might be able to trigger the dreams. The Stone was lost to the forest and the wand was equally inaccessible, so this family heirloom was all that remained to him. After a few minutes, the absurdity of standing invisible in the middle of his bedroom was too much, so he pulled the cloak off, carefully folded it back up, and tucked it back into the trunk. The potion was starting to take effect now too, so he waved his hand to turn out the lights and slipped into bed.
Well, it's been a minute. I don't have a lot of writing motivation but here's some more. I actually have more of this written, and I'm getting to the part that I'm excited about so I'll probably be posting again soon.
At first, he worried that he was trying to find a mother figure in Narcissa, but the more they talked, the more comfortable he felt, like he was talking to a friend. The only difference between the way he spoke to Narcissa and his friends was that Narcissa told him stories about the past rather than plan for the future.
Ron and Hermione were alone in the parlor, so Harry sat with them and explained the potions he’d just bought. Ron made a face. “You trust that git to make you potions?”
“You’re staying in the house, aren’t you?” she asked. “Is the tree still there?” Harry nodded to the first question.
“Those heads gave me nightmares as a child. Aunt Walburga gave me nightmares, if we’re being honest.” Harry snorted into his tea. “Still,” she continued, “I spent a good deal of time in that house.”
After a quick shower and a simple breakfast of eggs and toast, Harry was magically shrinking a pile of presents into a small bag and stepping into the fireplace to Floo to Andromeda’s. The house was still quiet but he could hear gentle shuffling noises coming from the kitchen, so he stepped through the archway and found Andromeda moving about the kitchen, her long brown hair messily piled onto her head and her fuzzy bathrobe wrapped tightly around her. “Happy Christmas, Harry,” she greeted with a smile, nursing a mug of tea.
If he was being honest, Harry really wasn’t sure that it was, but he didn’t want to steal hope away from the Malfoys. “I don’t know,” he finally said, “but I’m hopeful. I have friends who don’t treat me any differently. Perhaps other people can see it too.”
“Who told you that?” she asked.
Over time, he told her about the war, and the events leading up to it. They filled in the gaps in each other’s memories and knowledge. Harry talked about things he didn’t discuss even with his friends, and Narcissa revealed things about her family that she normally held close to the vest. It was an odd relationship, but it worked. For some reason, they were exactly what the other needed.
Kudos and comments are much appreciated!
“No, you’re not,” she said gently. “It’s okay to not be okay.” She pulled back, her hands still gripping his arms. “And you can always talk to me about it.”
“I know,” Harry replied. “You always are.”
“I think you are the only one left alive who really knows what happened there,” she said softly. Harry nodded absently.
“We’ll be here if you need us.”
“For me or him?”
“I feel better after visiting them,” he admitted. “Ron and Hermione came with me and I told them all about our friendship. They seemed to understand.”
Harry sighed and leaned back into the sofa, wondering how on earth he was supposed to deal with this now. How would Malfoy react? What would change? He would be an idiot to imagine it would go any farther or that Malfoy would even acknowledge that it happened. It would be best, he decided, to forget about it and move on as if nothing happened.
“No, and he wouldn’t have found it. Unless he really wanted to dig through my teenage pile of dirty clothes.”
“What about Zabini or Parkinson?” he asked. Narcissa lifted an eyebrow.
“No, he lives with Andromeda. I just help her out.” He hesitated a moment as Malfoy looked up at him. “She’s inside, you know. Your aunt.” The two men stared at each other for a moment, and Malfoy finally looked away.
Just after noon, they gathered up all their remaining presents and wrangled Teddy into his clothes and Andromeda wrapped up a dish of treacle tart and together they managed to transport the whole affair over to the Burrow. Harry offered to bring the dessert into the kitchen, as he could already hear the bangs and clangs of Mrs. Weasley cooking enough food to feed an army (they had all been soldiers in the not-so-distant past so it was fitting, really). He surprised her with a kiss on the cheek and she half-heartedly yelled at him to get out of her kitchen while he put the dessert down and pretended to swipe a biscuit from the counter, at which she hit his hand away and gave him a scowl. It would’ve been quite ferocious except she looked so pleased to see her extra child that it didn’t have quite the same effect.
“MAKE IT STOP!!!! HA! DAVEY HELP ME!”
“That’s difficult when you’re in my lap! . . . .I still wish you would have helped with the wand text. But I get it.”
Preposterous! Clerk?
“Oh No.”
Mr. Draco Malfoy-Potter
“Mother, where is that cabernet?”
You should see what it’s like when she gets to the Burrow with Arthur. The woman is definitely not afraid of getting her hands dirty. Especially when it comes to all these computer and phone things. Hugo's pretty good with it too.
“He’s much like you. Doesn’t really talk about the Lordship part. Look up the Gamp heritage sometime. . . . He’s particularly happy about the gender restrictions being lifted . . . . . eighteen Granddaughters and no direct male heir.”
“Soon. . . . . .you need Davey hugs!”
Op Ed! Leaky?
“Food?”
“It’s possible you would stay for a very long time.”
Got it. Okay see you in a while.
“Draco look! Paintings!”
I work in various mediums, magic doesn’t lend itself to some mediums.
Return Owl!
“True, I love the brush lines.”
Zebb has it.
“Yes, we think so.”
“Nope.”

“No. It wasn’t. He says the house must really be pleased with the progress.”
I actually don’t think he’d want to do that. Judy took that house and he wants her to keep it. If the divorce was dissolved he’d have to take it back. And Dud doesn’t want to alienate Lucy from her Mother, regardless of how awful she is.
Tomorrow? Then I start putting stuff into storage. Can’t wait two weeks for the kids to get their stuff. I’ll set up vaults at Gringotts and do that transfer thingy? Do you think that would work?
“Please tell me she didn’t bring the help.”
. . . . I don’t know what to call it?”

Edit: still fixing my mistakes.
And they were in a big hurry to get out of there.

“No. This is her letters and a diary. I’m trying to cross reference things with this portfolio from Jay. . . . . She wasn’t particularly magical and she’s a few rungs lower than boring.”

“YES.”
I have arranged for the property to be documented one last time. I have provided a grant for the Magical Historical Society to provide the most complete documentation available that can be accessed by current researchers and our future generations. This documentation will be conducted by a team of photographers and a cartographer who will not only map and photograph the property, but also preserve it in visual form using technology not used before on a magical property. Our muggle neighbors would call this “Virtual Reality”. Within Wizarding culture we don’t have a name for it. How odd.
I guess we’re going to Berlin?
The Legislation before you is entitled: “The Repeal of Intentionally Vague Limitations on the Minister of Magic.”
LOL. That’s not true. You did plenty it’s just been a while.
“I’ll be right out.”
“Oh yes.”
“Okay I’ll go write it up!”
“Will you just give it a chance?”
“Have I told you I love you enough today?”
“He’s the older guy that kind of dressed like a butler? Dry sense of humor? Hates dust?”

Another question?
"They're all very thrilled over the lab exhibit. And they're from everywhere. Potions masters society."
“Master suite.”
Draco?
“I don’t see why not. I believe the ceremonies should last about 15 minutes total. Then we’re off to the reception, but again it’s a walk.”
Dear Mr. Potter,
“This is why I was so confused with this painting. It’s not just a magical image of memories like the others it’s actually him in real time.”
UGH Grayson is too practical. He’s checking the tags for fabrics cause he doesn’t want to have trouble doing laundry: “Pants at cleaning spells!”.
OMG it’s so fucking awesome! We all have to go over there too. You will NOT recognize the place. It’s going to be so perfect for the boys. Zebb is just BUZZING! Shay fixed up her place too. Even put the old appliances from the cottage there and she’s redone everything inside with a strawberry theme!
“A real Muggle driving license?!”
Broccoli Beef! Okay gotta go. Love You Bye!
“OH COME ON!!
I. Love. You. Too.
“Thank you!”
Hello? Okay wait just a minute. Let me fix the name thing.
She can take it off I’m sure.
Seems to be. Nothing like yesterday at least.
It’s called tough love. I know what you’re on about, but I’ve got nothing to share concerning these extraneous issues. You’re not getting anything, My darling.

“Do you like an almond latte?”
Love You More Bye!
“I’ve got to get this house cleaned out. I’ve been thinking.”
“Very effective.”
Mum wants to come over. Andi is being reasonable and say’s she’ll wait until tomorrow.
“What are the bathrobes for?”
It uses a lot of light. Kind of like a muggle hologram if you know what those are?
Kissing doesn’t come into the equation. . . . . . seven for the splash.
Plus they would just be living next door. Could that work?
“Just a song I have on my phone. I’m getting bored out of my mind.”
“It’s protected. No petrol, or in this case there’s no need for a Muggle power source. Driving protections will not allow for a collision or head injury. Muggle repellant means Muggles won’t come near it if parked on the streets. It also will not allow another automobile to scratch it by accident. Heating and cooling controls are sufficient. Navigation installed. . . . . for ignition just place the provided key in the slot and it should be ready to go. It’s basically the same ritual I would have used on a horse. There’s no need for an audible engine or exhaust charm. Anything else?”
I know where that is it’s easy. Is your place going to block me?
“We’ve removed the dust coverings. I’ve reinstated the protection charms and altered the drivers compartments to better suit Mr. Elliots stature. They’ve all checked out. They should be ready to take out with some minor adjustments. Any of them really except the bus. That would require major repairs.”
“We haven’t planned anything no. And Draco is at work. Nobody lives here yet. We’re just testing your portrait today. What do you think of the entry hall?”
These arseholes are going down. Grifters and frauds. International. These type of intimidation tactics might work on Muggles, but not on people who can actually find the sources. We’ve cracked this one WIDE OPEN. And it’s ugly.
Okay Rose is here. I’m going to meet with her now and she’ll be back to your place soon okay?
One would hope, but not confirmed. Just speculated. We need to assemble the teams. And Quick.
YOU TWO ARE FUCKING AWESOME.
I don’t know why you’re so skeptical. Mr. Kreacher was always very kind to me when I was young girl. He would sneak Andromeda and I sweets to the house kitchen while that old harpy was yelling at my parents about sobriety and abstinence for Muggles or some such drivel. He also makes the best hot chocolate. Minerva says that he is very excited and apparently pretty shocked that we agreed to it. I think it’s going to be quite interesting.
Hope you're having a great week.
“Done. . . . . Okay, Potter, I can’t wait any longer. Want to know how much the donations were for the first two days?”
10 Galleons on Al throwing up.
“And if I bring in an expert to help remove them would that be upsetting? She is very trustworthy.”
Bye Sweetheart.
“I don’t need an appointment.”
“Oh. They should see it definitely.”
“I didn’t know that.”
Are you really not mad?
That’s so cool!
“Okay.”

Hermione is not amused!

“That is what I can only assume is a Family Grimoire. It contains spells only known to the family, or custom ones like the one on that necklace. Lore and history . . . . . fuck . . . . Dammit! Jay why didn’t I know this was here?”

“We’ll still always have things like this? Stupid things like this breakfast set to pass on?”
I’ll bring lunch.

Can’t be programmed to any indoor location unless it’s a registered portkey landing site. Built in safeguard. Also, in order to set the location you have to be standing on the spot you want the portkey to land on and then it works in reverse. Like muggle GPS. And the location has to be set at least 2 metres away from any building. The bounce feature is a buffer so a person can’t accidentally land on another person or object.

We’re not moving out from here until after the wedding. And there will not be any actual BABY!!!!! for at least another 5+ months. And Lily, this is all the more reason for you to come for the family meeting. You can take a look at your stuff and sort it.
Indeed, the Goblin Music Society (GMS) would be honored to provide entertainment for your event. They are a volunteer charity organization that provides for medigoblin services for the aged and infirm. I have a particular quartet in mind.
Furniture from 12 Grimmauld to storage vault for interim. Harry will arrange storage and disposal of mattresses/linens etc.

Four generations of Grandchildren wondering what’s happening. They’re very excited actually. I filled them in briefly over dinner. They had expected me home much earlier.

OMG. She and Jay have been working behind my back. Meeting and interviewing. Background checking. Personality testing. You name it. They decided it all, and now I’ve got a personal assistant to tell me to put my socks in the laundry, replacement staff for Decram’s manor and 5 bedrooms occupied in #10 and #14.

Auntie Luna
“What are you up to, Potter?”
“Dumbledore’s robe? The sparkly one with the galaxies. I love how he did the lighting on it. And this is the old podium from the great hall. . . .look, the candles are all still melty and everything.”

“Just resting my eyes, Draco. I like this music. It’s relaxing. . . . . kisses
His friend shakes her head, smile kind.  “A lot of people regret their actions and inactions during the war.  It changed all of us.  I hope for the better.  I'll try not to judge him for it.  I hope he makes good choices now.  We regret what we do not try after all.”
It's not as obvious with Draco, but nothing ever was.  There is no doubt in his mind he wants to be with this man for the rest of his life.  They aren't perfect.  No couple is.  But they are right for each other.  If they got married, it would purely be for them.
“That I would go in alone - yes.”  Draco argues back, but it lacks much heat.  He is too weak, and it is painful to speak.  Pansy ducks out of sight and returns a moment later with a glass, bending the straw in it so Draco can take a drink.
It so often felt like he was talking with one of his mates with Draco.  The easy casualness of it now.  He honestly forgot at times how divergent the man’s life had been.  That he wouldn’t have had a lot of the same experiences as Harry had.
The next several minutes feel like a fog to Harry.  His entire body is cold.  Hermione’s hand atop his own is the only warm thing anchoring him.  The murmurs of the crowd are rising around them.  Buzzing.
“What’s behind that?”  Albus whisper shouts in the way that children do who do not entirely understand the concept of lowering their voice.  “Are you sure it’s okay?”
“Do you remember when you were five and you asked me why I was not married?”
“I am not ‘freaking out’ as you put it.”  Draco responds, expression serious.  “It is a little late in the day for that considering we live together.”
He does take the occasional break to walk around the place.  It's a strikingly different experience strolling around now.  Nothing on the outside reminds him of that first horrific time he was here when Snatchers dragged them in during the war.  It is actually quite peaceful now in the newly constructed courtyard.  Trees, shrubbery, and flowerbeds lining the area making quite the scenic English garden.
It is with a rush of cool air and anticipation that Draco wraps his hand around him.  Harry groans, shivering and arching into Draco’s touch.  Instincts taking over.  Fuck.  Draco has learned the spell for lube.  Harry thought that was his trick.
Harry shuffles along, following behind Hermione as they are prompted ahead by an auror.
“I wish I could have been raised with you."  Harry says, mouth crooking in thought.  "That would have been loads better than with my aunt and uncle.  They were awful.  But, what made you get into designing though?”
“I imagine you are the impetus for that.”  Simone suggests.
“You are better looking than I remember.”  Astoria remarks conversationally.  “It is almost a shame my friend snapped you up.”
“Lily.”
“Hmmph.”  He huffs.  But who was he to doubt the wisdom of Astoria Greengrass?  Particularly when Hermione and his own PR agent had given similar advice.  Again and again.
“But I don’t understand.”  Al says, shaking his head.  “You’re not bad.”
serious talks.
“You may.”  Draco permits once it becomes clear Harry is not going to respond.  His boyfriend looks contemplative.  Resting his chin on his hand and brow furrowed.
“You are being sloppy.”  Draco informs him dryly.  Carefully cutting.
“Ginny.”  Harry begins tersely.  “It’s not our job to entertain them.”
“If I pull someone, they’re muggle and I never see them again."  The man explains.  "It’s just a stress reliever and we both know that’s all it is.  There isn’t any write up in the paper that way.  No feelings or people asking questions.  And I
Jamie grimaces.  “Er, yes, Mrs. Malfoy.  It’s a crup.”
“You’re welcome.”  He remarks, perplexed.  It was practical what he did, working with James.  He is Harry’s partner.  He helps with the children where he can.  “James is the one who deserves most of the credit.  He is a stubborn, hardworking boy.”
“You’re here.”  Draco rasps, eyeing Harry.  His boyfriend has soot on his face and his expression is strained.  It has been a long time since Draco saw Harry this way.  His friends frown as one and share a silent look.
Potter’s gaze on him.  The voice that sounds like Astoria whispers in the back of his head.
There is a high pitched crying suddenly from far off and he ducks his head back.  Lily and Hugo run into the room.  “Daddy!  Draco!” Lily wails.  “Al pushed me!”
“I very obviously do.”  He disagrees.
He isn't certain he said it aloud for a few moments.  It has been a long time since he felt his heart thud in his chest like this in uncertainty.  He watches the kids out of his peripheral vision.  It looks like they are having fun.
Harry nearly chokes on his drink and works to clear his throat.  “I think you have the wrong idea, Narcissa.”  He breaks in hoarsely.  He did
It seems like as a couple, they spend more time with Harry’s friends.  Draco assumes this is mostly to do with geography and the fact Weasley and Hermione have children the same age and are members of Harry’s family.
”  She proclaims, sounding equally scandalized and delighted.
“I would love nothing more, Draco.”  Harry reassures running his fingers once again through the ends of Draco’s hair.  “I’m all yours.”
“That doesn’t make sense.”  He argues patiently.  “For one,
“Seamus is here?”  Harry asks.  He looks around trying to spy him but doesn't have much luck.  He isn't tall enough to see very far over all the heads.  Ron had been a helpful auror partner back in the day because of his height.  Wherever Seamus was, there would be gambling and gorgeous women.  He could guarantee that.
“Have you had dinner yet?”  Draco asks, tone casual.
“We promise we won’t use them inside.”  James promises looking entirely
Unfortunately, it does not work.  Lily’s expression is crestfallen.  Hurt even.  Wide, brown eyes disappointed and mouth in a pout.  He glances pointedly at his boyfriend for support.
They end up in the kitchen.  Harry pours them each a drink as Ginny sits cross-legged on the bench by the kitchen table.
always rely on Potter to know his own mind, to tell the truth, even if he did not like it.  If Potter is willing to let him into his home – his bed, the least Draco can do is continue to meet him halfway and be honest too.  This will not work otherwise.
“Well, the Notts and the Zabinis are here.”  Pany begins, choosing to airily ignore Draco.  “Padma and her husband too.  Her married name’s hyphenated to Khan now.  You remember Leo Khan.  I saw Astoria briefly before she had to host someone.  She mentioned Millicent and her girlfriend came.  I even saw Seamus Finnegan.”
“He just fell asleep.”
It is his turn to be startled when the woman’s eyes bulge open and she begins to screech nonsensically.  Hands tearing ineffectively at the border of her painting.  Then, realizing her audience, glares down madly at the boys from the faded, yellowed paintwork.  “FOUL HALF-BLOODS.  CHILDREN OF BLOOD TRAITORS.  MY HOUSE RUINED BY YOUR VILE FATHER.”
“I wish, just once, she would -
It is a desolate place.  Draco put off coming here for just that reason.  Being here made him feel seventeen again.  Desperate and scared.  Malfoy Manor is a time capsule stuck at the end of May 1998.  The moment he crosses the property line he is hit with the smell of ash and decay as if there had been a large fire and somewhere there was something left rotting in water.  The metal gates are blown in and rendered useless.  Torn apart at the seams.  Gouges in the earth where ancient trees stood for centuries.  The entire east wing had collapsed during the siege.  The great hall burnt to hell.  Grand staircase torn apart and sticking oddly out of the second floor.  Ballroom, tearoom, pleasure garden, his mother’s bedroom, father’s office, the common family spaces all gone – as if some great, giant beast had ripped into the manor with its claws.
“She hasn’t drunk much since the baby was born.”  Anthony mutters to Harry in an aside.  Expression somewhat apologetic.  “She’s only on her second drink and she’s already three sheets.”
“Flatterer.”  Draco accuses, but Harry can tell he is pleased.
The creature freezes when he glances at Draco.  Eyes widening almost comically in a manner that Draco suspects his face is unused to doing.  “Master Harry!”  The elf cries out in a raspy voice scolding Potter.  Shock apparent.
“I bought these with just you in mind, love.”  Draco remarks, kicking off his trousers that had fallen around his ankles along with his shoes.  “I’m not terribly adept at dirty talk, but I hoped you would appreciate this purchase.  It’s my gift to you after all.”
“Only ‘cause I asked what they were!” Jamie shouts unable to keep silent any longer.  “A boy at school was saying stuff about Draco being a death eater.”
It is all a new experience for Draco.  He never visited a primary school before meeting the Potter children.
Well, he never has been one to look a gift dragon in the mouth.  He is grateful to take Draco’s hand and walk the block over to a food cart he knows for a fact sells skewered chicken satay and absolutely no dinosaur shaped anything.
“What in Circe’s name for?”  Draco questions, tired expression filled with surprise.  This was the most exhausted he's seen Draco since they began dating.  His clothing was still crisp from work, but his shoulders were slumped and features vulnerable.  Draco’s hair was no longer staying combed back either, loose strands falling forward.
Fortunately, the children seemed completely unaware.  Albus was delighted and clearly enjoyed the day to its fullest.  Playing a new game with his young cousins and mates from school.  Beaming when his grandmother brought out his cake and everyone sang for him.
“Harry,” He starts, voice strained.  Throat catching.
Healers faces blurred in and out.  Peripheral vision creating a tunnel effect that left him dizzy.  Their voices disconnected in his foggy mind.  He remembers one sharp break into clarity with a stabbing pain surging through his spine like a lightning bolt.  He sat up like a shot, shouting “Bloody fucking hell!” as the stasis charm failed for the last time.  The smell of burnt fabric and flesh hitting him like a brick to the face causing him to gag.
“Nevermind me.”  Draco says suddenly with a shake of his head, glancing away.  “You said you didn’t have anyone when you were a boy, but what about after you started Hogwarts?  Who did you love best then?”
“How do you mean?”
“I was going through a lot then too.”  Simone adds, speaking directly to Harry.  “I don’t know if Draco’s shared this, but that was early on in my transition, and I was fairly lost with what to do with my life.”
Nothing changes too much except Olta joins them too.  A guest room on the third floor is converted for her use.  Kreacher didn’t like that.  The old elf stamped his foot, scowling and glaring at Dad for letting the ‘uppity elf’ take a whole room meant for wizards.  All the while, Olta serenely waited to the side as Draco explained to Kreacher that all house elves in his employ are allotted rooms for themselves.
He, Ron, and Hermione lean in to see as well.  There is a familiar seeming man in it next to Draco.  They are at the Mercury Clinic.  The sign can be partially seen above where Draco is packing something in a container at the front desk.  One of the receptionists beside his boyfriend has the clinic’s schedule out before her and seems to be talking to the man.  The angle is strange, as if it were taken surreptitiously.  Harry’s stomach sinks when he realizes it is a wizard that members of his squad arrested not even a month ago.
“What?”  Harry voices, confused.
Harry only grins toothily.  Clearly pleased with himself.
They smile at each other.  It is one of understanding.  Harry is enormously grateful for it.
“You listen here –
“Does that really count?”  Harry objects.  Privately he suspects that he was Draco’s
“S. H. I. T.”
He closes his eyes.  Breathing deeply through his nose and out of his mouth like mother taught him when he was a boy.  Ignoring his dislike of the stale smell of his cell.  It was good to smell bad here he reminds himself.  He had been avoiding the showers.
elements of my past I’ve been quiet about, but it’s more to do with my wanting to move past them than hiding anything.  I’ll try to be more open with you in the future.”
“Can you say hello to Draco, Lily?” Dad gently prods, resting his hand atop her head.
“It is you.”  He realizes aloud, awed.  How can this be?  Severus does not have the appearance of a ghost, but no remnant could have the knowledge he does otherwise.  There were a few pressing questions he had for his mentor, but none as important as an apology.  “Severus, I'm sorry I didn't listen to you.  I should have.  You were only trying to help me - to protect me.”  Draco says hurriedly, fighting back sudden tears.
“Nuh-uh.”  Lily defends, slapping her hands down decisively in her syrup.  “Draco is good.”
tell me you at least didn’t start all that after sex.”
Harry closes his eyes.  Trying for calm as he feels his temper spark.  He can understand Ron’s feelings, but it still hurts.  The worst bit is that Draco would likely agree with Ron which is laughable on its own.
Mr. Drake into her social circles.  The whole thing was completely mad.
Jamie slyly peeks out again at the commotion.  Lily shoves her way between Dad and Draco on the sofa.  Face tear streaked and burying her face under Draco’s arm, one hand grabbing hold of his shirt in her little fist.  Sobbing.  Hugo launches into a long explanation of Al not coming out when they found him - even though Rosie did when they found her - and then pushing Lily who fell and hurt her arm.
“I thought so, but then they began snogging again.”
After a while, Harry notices a pattern emerge.  Malfoy will meet up with him where Harry’s schedule allows.  Often arranged the day of with a quickly scribbled note from Harry he sends by his owl, Hestia.  They will talk or eat depending, Malfoy will do some quick diagnostics, and if neither has anywhere to be immediately, they will lapse back into conversation.
“Did you come here to complain?”  Father drawls, unimpressed.  “Or did you come here to tell me that you succeeded in your quest?”
Draco goes to the mirror situated above their bureau and discovers purple dots drawn all over the side of his face.  One is even heart shaped.  Mordred and Morgana.  What has become of him?  He needs to review the importance of knocking on bedroom doors before entering with the children.  Clearly.
“Yes.”  Draco agrees instantly.  Already thinking of what he wants.  They stay like that for a few minutes longer.  Harry playing with him until his cock begins to fill again.  His boyfriend moving back down to kiss it.
"Does it matter to you that I love him?" Draco declares, completely honest with his father. Stunning the disgusted look off his father's face. "Or that he loves me?  Likely not.  You have been locked in here so long with your frustration so fixated, in part, on me.  Do you even still care for me?  I doubt it."
Completely relaxed.
He cannot imagine his life without any one of them.  His home – his family – had become the five of them.  Him, Harry, and the children.  The unexpected joys of his life.  Albus who shared so many interests with him.  The boy who loved nothing more than learn about the magical world around, to play quidditch with his family, and eat sweets.  Albus who looked the most like Harry.
The last week had been an odd one since the article came out with the picture of Draco and his children at the café.  People at the ministry seemed to be eyeing him and whispering more than usual as he passed by.  He had answered questions succinctly from other people in the department about Draco, stating he and Draco were good friends – that he trusted him around his children. It was what they agreed to say if they were asked about one another by people who were not press.  They were in an ongoing debate about when to issue a statement about their relationship.  One had already been drafted by Harry’s PR agent, but they remained unsure.  Draco felt it was Harry’s decision, given his very public presence.  Harry thought they should choose together.
Eventually Harry moves forward, helping Draco lay back on the soft bed linens as his boyfriend settles between his thighs.  Watches as Harry’s dark hair falls forward and he tucks it behind the man’s ear.  Resting his hand at the nape of Harry’s neck and playing with the hair there.
James would have those memorized, but he cannot seem to read the more complicated words from the books and articles that Draco extracts.  The researcher in him wants to know more.
Harry suspects it’s just the adrenaline crash from everything.  It seemed like by eight the previous night Malfoy began to sag and agreed when Harry encouraged him to go sleep.  Falling face first into the bare mattress while Harry made do with the transfigured couch.
Draco sighs.  Lifting Harry’s arm, pushing back the sleeve to check his watch.  “I suppose it is about that time.”  His boyfriend remarks, leaving his hand loosely in Harry’s as they fall back to the floor.  Turning to rest his chin on Harry’s shoulder and frowning in a pout.
“Well, look at that.”  Draco states, looking over the board.  Studying it.  “A ferret outfoxed by a weasel.”
“Waffles are my second favorite breakfast food.”  Harry tells him between bites.  “They're really fluffy here.”  He adds enthusiastically, mouth full.
Lily is indeed crying based on the whimpers he's hearing.  It's muffled so Jamie guesses she has her face in Dad’s shoulder or a pillow.
“Why did you stop being a death eater?”  He asks.  Dad wasn’t here to stop Draco from answering now.
It’s going to be after a long day at Grimmauld, so I’d say served would be better. If we’re having it done from the centre we can bring the staff and food to the manor. The kitchens at the Potter Manor are huge, but I’m not sure if anything can really be prepared there anymore. Certainly the dinner can be plated and executed from there. Bring it in under stasis and warming charms. We can ask for volunteers to staff it off hours and pay them double time and a half.
Of course not! Zebb is just glaring at me to help with the food prep. And she’s got a knife! I’d better go!
“Huh.”
Can you take tomorrow off?

I suppose I should too.
“Ha!”
All you ask can, and will be arranged by our Iceland Branch in time for your visit. You will be sent the coordinates in a separate secure post after the stasis removal ritual has been performed. You are not required to attend. When you arrive you will be met by your Iceland representative who will perform another short ritual that will allow you to access the property through the wards. He will also provide a written report that explains the property more thoroughly. The protections on this property are extensive. After that time you may then invite any guests you wish.

Yes, of course we want everything from that era that people will be willing to share. You can’t activate that map though. It shows what’s currently going on at Hogwarts. Privacy issues. But people would sure want to see it. And the cloak is much more interesting than you make it out to be. Mostly because people don’t believe it actually exists.

You’re just playing hard to get with me!

I didn’t know much about it TBH. My Grandmother doesn’t like to talk about it either.
“I do.”

Harry went down there and got copies of the pics. I have no further comment.
I don’t care what color ribbon!

“Yes, Gloria and Cel are in the suite. They’ve been up to the owlery to check on things for you.”
“For YOU!”

It’s not every day I get to do a freaking wedding cake. Of course I’m excited, AND I’ve got an amazing kitchen to bake it in.
LOL! I do need more diving practice, but I now know your true motivation!
Tonight. And yes, he know’s it a date.
We’ve got the whole park planned out? Including how to do it without alarming the Muggles. Ask Gin about her superior diversion tactics. Apparently Gin and Jerry are masters at it. It involves bulldozers, dump trucks and a toy backhoe.
“Yes that’s the best one. Cheng. I seriously doubt it’s still there. WAIT. How in the FUCK is that phone and list still there after all this?!”
“19:00? I know you like my stroganoff would you like that tonight? Choose your favorite wine from the cellars.”
I’m willing to sign off on it. And I have Bill Weasley. He can check the vaults after?
“I’ve got jam in the pantry! What a treat! What’s the bakery?”
“Well, Potter, it looks like these green haired kids are all going to sleep well tonight.”
“Snape named this his reflection ward. It’s registered as the Voscantvidere ward with the ministry but the ritual and incantation are unknown. It’s a very strong ward that cannot be broken.”

SM: Kitakyushu, on the coast, There’s an amazing castle and wisteria garden. Then there’s Fukuoka with a great jazz scene.
Well, Rosie doesn’t open up this chat very often so it must be important.
Okay.
“Thank Louis for putting that in context!”
We’re going to do some good with this after all. I’m committed to that.
Either they know, or are meddling again and trying to push it. I hedge on the side of they already know and don’t care, because that’s how they are.
“Zebb has it all ready and waiting for you at the cottage for tomorrow. No worries.”
“UGH!”
I’m a little dumbstruck. Was just about to start looking for a flat in London. It’s a lot. But no it’s not that we don’t like it. I just think I’m still a little numb. And there were a lot of tears.
FAKE motorcycle license.
“Now you can ride it! Hop off your broom and on the metal dragon so we can have a photo.”
THANK YOU THANK YOU!
I’m really interested to see what the Manor looks like cleaned up too. Tell Carol and crew they can start on that any time and I’ll get Gringotts to key them into the ward.
Please see our photos in all publications!
You’re on the list now, so if you want to chat to the whole group just initiate a chat and click “all”. Or you can select from a list. We each have other individual lists so we can add “outside people” from time to time like our dads if we want, but that’s rare. You can change the handles of outsiders without their permission.

Yes. I have an idea.
Okay. Have a good trip.
“I am Mister Cloud. I will be happy to prepare beverages. Our pantries are well stocked and we are prepared to provide all meals, or anything you should need. Just ask for Mister Cloud for what you require at any time. What coffee drink would Mr. Draco prefer?”
Okay, well it sounds like we have a solution for your stag do, Jamie?
He did. It was crazy fast! It’s like an entire new floor on top of the flat.
No. Just look nice for Hugo.
“I thought it would be nice for the tenants?”
“Now remember, we just jump feet first. Try to pull your knees up. Here we go on three

Hermione has drawn up the confidentiality agreement. Can anyone tell me what that means?
“Yeah I know, but still. . . .come here you arsehole. . . . .you too Draco.”
“Usually there’s a familial connection at some point, yes. And sometimes it skips many generations. Some people have minor abilities that they just take for granted. Do you? Have you ever noticed anything?
“Once you fucking relaxed you caught on very quickly. That surprised me.”
Scorp visit's Knockturn.
Cool! I’ll check with you later K?

“After lunch. You’ll see.”
“Harry. . . you say “I love you”. . . you say it a lot. . . to me . . .to the kids . . . to family . . .but you only say it when you really mean it, so yes.
OMG it’s SO COOL. Would Uncle Nev be okay with that?

He mumbled something about “Draco” and “Gwen” but mostly it’s hysterical laughing. I do like the hugs and kisses, but again. WHAT DID YOU DO?
“How much is a lease on these places?”
YES YES YES!!!!
“YES!”
Owl from Liogell. I’ll need to look into this more. I remember the house in Muggle London, but have only heard a little about the Prince Manor in Scotland. The cottage in Wales is where Mother and I hid out that summer. It’s small and on a cliff. Castle is a ruin, that would be cool to visit maybe.
Yes they’re down here with the boys. Part of the Diagon merchants group. Teddy and Louis are talking with them about the Junk Shop.
“If you turn the dial on the far left that’s your music playlist courtesy of Hugo. Keep it turned down very low while we learn.”
I wasn’t joking when I said the doors will always open for you. Just come on in.
We told the Dads today at our “tea”. They dropped a bomb on us so it was fair play.
Repaint all in same color scheme except Zebb's She would like it left white with green shutters and trim. Front door red please!
I hope not. So this is my dilemma: Luna Lovegood-Longbottom and I have a standing date for tea and watercolour painting in my studio on each 3rd Thursday. I’ve just been informed that she is traveling to Peru and has cancelled for this month. She suggested that I invite Albus to join me in her stead.
“Are you sure?”
“Oh no. You two are doing this. The kids are going to love it. Stand right here.”
“You really don’t get it do you???? You know who that was DON’T YOU?”
Your response to the Prophet article is already online. Your father is surely rolling in his grave. That’s a nice touch.
Okay then.
“Third stove from the right. She’s been waiting for you.”
“SORRY?! WHY?”
Which Vaults then.
We could still do it at the Cottage, but wouldn’t be the same as going to Dads.
Lavazza. Qualità Rossa.
“ Hi Grayson, good to meet you . .
See you after on Tuesday?
I love you too!
I thought I’d brought her up better than to worry over that kind of crap.
“Staying away.”
“Maybe Davie.”
Yes, I suppose so. Unless there are any more questions.
Already did. It will be here on Saturday.
And YOU wait while I finish my point. . . . Alright. You might notice that there are no staff dedicated to the culinary arts . . . . Cooking. . . .Harry cooks. . . .This kitchen behind us through the swinging doors is going to go through a big refurbishment soon. . .That will be Harry’s kitchen. . . It’s off limits unless you’re invited to help. He will invite you to sit down to eat his food. It’s perfectly fine to accept and sit at the dining table. He’s a good cook and knows his stuff. . . .It never hurts to ask if he’d like some help cleaning up . . . .He also bakes. . . once the kitchen is remodeled don’t be surprised if he sends you home with a dozen muffins or a carrot cake.”
Trandy.
I’ll team up with Agruella and we’ll definitely win the singing competition!
“I’m happy that you’re happy.”
Ha Ha, Nice try Harry.
I’m not sure how that would work. Wouldn’t it be a big deal if the place just appeared out of nowhere in a Muggle neighborhood? That might cause big problems!
When would you be available? Not today we’re on our way to meeting Ginevra and her husband.
HERAALD JAMES POTTER!
So just an observation. She seems to come in a lot with questions whenever Hugo’s working. Hugo's oblivious.
Yes. What time?
“26 guest suites?”
Actually I’ve got one of him with Draco hair. But he’s not really a baby. Maybe two-ish? That might throw them off a little.
One more on Sunday. Have a great weekend.
“I’m joking? Not about the roast. I don’t drink coffee?”
“I’m Jamie’s brother Al, and this is Scorp.”
“I don’t know, I’d have to check with Gringotts about how many Muggles. OH. I’ve got an assistant that can do that!”
I wish to take the Black property at Grimmauld out of stasis and remodel. I would also like to take Potter Manor out of stasis temporarily while I work on the Black property.
“Do I?”
Trying to mix it up a little.
“He’s right every time!”
ASPEN
You are NOT getting details. DO NOT ASK!
“What about outside?”
You knew exactly what you were doing.
“Mother,” Draco voices, rubbing a hand at his temple.  “I am not you.  I do not wish to dovetail my significant other’s career.  For one, I have my own work.  For another, Harry has never expressed the slightest interest in politics.”
“Yes.”
Draco grits his teeth.  Not wanting to give him the satisfaction of agreeing.  Gripping the covers with his free hand.  Potter does not need encouragement though because he begins leaving open mouth kisses around the head, tongue poking out to lick closer to where Draco wants.  Driving him mad.
Malfoy glares, expression unimpressed.  “I have
Harry laughs.  Draco never wanted to take time away from the kids.
“Let me rephrase,” Harry starts, raising his pointer finger.  “I want to give you a ring because we are committed to each other and because I want people to stop hitting on you.”
The tarnished hero.
It is not until he goes behind the curtain of the Mercury Clinic’s booth that he overhears what all the fuss is about in English, French, and the smattering of Dutch he can understand.
Draco meets and interacts with the Potter children.
is a good idea especially at a boarding school.”
“Let’s get a few things cleared up.” Dad begins.  Taking a deep breath.  Expression troubled.  “You boys want to know about death eaters.  Well, death eaters were a group of dark wizards and witches.  Their leader was a dark wizard called Voldemort whose real name was Tom Riddle.  They were the bad guys in the last two wizarding wars.”
“Draco.”  He groans lowly after an indeterminate amount of time, breaking their kiss.  Flipping them so he can be on top.  Pressing Draco into the mattress and making his boyfriend whine.  Rutting against him.  Draco hooks a leg around him.  Harry can feel Draco’s heel at his hip.  Holding him tighter.  Bringing them closer together.
Still, it takes some courage for him to open the door enough to peek through into the sliver of the opening.  He spies the woman he hoped to find standing in the middle of the passageway.  Hands clutched behind her back and looking up at the ceiling.  Humming tunelessly as she slowly spins in place.
“It is not.”  Harry denies, giving Clearwater his most put-upon expression.  It does little to dissuade her enthusiasm.
“Professor McGonagall, thank you for joining us this evening.”  He greets.
It was more interesting in Islington anyway compared to the cottage he'd lived in with his parents – even if before he could walk down the lane to the Burrow. Their cottage was just outside of Ottery St. Catchpole near the little unnamed creek that trickled through.  Aunt Hermione called it the Hobbit House.  Where he and Al had tried to catch tadpoles every spring when they were small while miniscule bowtruckles sneakily popped up to see what they were doing.
“I hope they will be okay with it.  And, yeah . . . it was nice to see him.  Although it wasn’t so much a date as a snog session.”  Harry admits feeling his cheeks heat up and looking down at his bit of sashimi.
“State your name for the record, please.”
It is another in the continuation of bizarre yet strangely pleasant moments he has here.  He is starting to have quite the collection.  If his younger self could glimpse into the future, he is quite certain he would be utterly baffled at how Harry chooses to spend his leisure time.  He'd probably ask himself if he had taken one too many curses to the head.
