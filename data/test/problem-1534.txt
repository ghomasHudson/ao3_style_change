Hermione nodded vigorously then engulfed the older witch in a hug, sobbing all the while. "Oh, thank you! Thank you!"
"Go away," Draco hissed, trying and failing to push Harry away in his still-weakened state, and Harry managed to pull the blond's hand away to see that the familiar facial features that mesmerised him had distorted to form a beak and stray feathers.
Harry stares at me for a long moment, like he thinks I'm crazy—which I wouldn't blame him for thinking—and then nods. "Alright. I apologise if I've made you uncomfortable. I'll take my leave, then."
"You flatter me," Draco said with an ostentatious flick of his wrist. "But that comes with being a Veela. As I'm mostly alone, I forget that I can have that effect on others."
was written across it in silver lettering, and Harry was glad to finally see something he recognised, even if it was just a name.
"Morning, lads," he said as he entered the conference room whose back wall was covered with information regarding the Floo disappearances.
"Hey, Al, sorry. C'mere." He held out his hand, and Albus hesitated for a moment before slowly taking it and cuddling up against him.
"Have you been sleeping alright lately?" he asked, turning towards her, and she nodded, looking wary.
The elf bowed so low, her pointed nosed brushed against the carpet, causing her to break out in a fit of sneezes. Malfoy seemed genuinely concerned, and once he had made sure that the elf was OK, thanked her and sent her off.
"He's got a few more grey hairs just from babysitting them for two days. You think he can survive looking after all five of them on a daily basis
"Did they get bad again?" She glanced around before leaning forwards and whispering, "Your nightmares?"
Harry looked around to make sure there wasn't anybody suspicious in the vicinity and muttered a quick
"Why don't you just connect it to the house?" Scorpius asked for the hundredth time, as his mother still did every chance she got, even in a tone of voice so similar to hers that it was undeniable Scorpius was his mother's son.
Apparently, both things were inevitable now, and his opinion on the issue didn't matter one bloody bit.
Draco's eyes were wide and glistening with unshed tears as he whispered, "They found Scorpius? They found my boy?"
Harry sighed, pressing his fingers to his temples. "Rogers, from here on, I'm transferring the vandalism case to you. Once Buxley gets back on track, he can lead the investigation, but until then, I want
"What?" he barked, blinking through the thickness of sleep. He fumbled for his glasses before putting them on and squinting up at a scowling Ron. "Ron? What's going on?"
His mother was silent for a moment, and he didn’t dare look up at the expression on her face. “Your cousin did.”
"I know," was her clipped reply, and he got the feeling that she didn't particularly like him for reasons he didn't want to know.
Sidestepping, she tightened the grip on her wand, ready to lash out a few curses, but there was a sudden explosion from behind her, causing her to pause and look over her shoulder. Squinting into the darkness, she tried to gauge the distance between her and the rapidly spreading fire.
Harry shifted. "That we do." He cleared his throat. "Well, I suppose it's similar to why Astoria and you got divorced. Ginny and I just wanted very different things from life." Draco thought that was all the answer he was going to get, but Harry kept talking.
Harry rolled his eyes as Hermione stared at him, as though she expected him to just accept that he might have made a stupid mistake. Like he would ever admit to that, even if it were true, especially to her.
Dumbstruck, and completely nonplussed, Harry slowly turned to look down at Lestrange, watching in disbelief as a single, clear teardrop escaped from the corner of his eye. And as they watched, Lestrange's eyes slipped shut, and he lay unmoving.
He watched as the small procession slowly made its way to where Robards and a group of Hit-Wizards were standing. Everyone tensed when the guards removed the chains from the prisoner's wrists and ankles, as though the half-dead man could be any more dangerous than the sea slugs clinging to the dank walls.
"More paperwork?" Harry groaned at Buxley's muffled affirmation and grumbled, "Become Head Auror, they said. It'll be everything you've ever dreamed of, they said."
Malfoy's eyes seemed to harden at that, as though something about Harry's decision was unsettling, but Harry might have just been imagining it because Malfoy continued saying in the same tone of voice, "No, no. Please don't mind me. I assumed otherwise since most of our clients take painstaking care in ensuring that their actual identities are not revealed, especially since a lot of them are high-ranking or well-known individuals, such as yourself."
"Thanks." Harry smiled as he settled down at the counter and poured himself some coffee from the pot.
The men behind her swore and took off running in the direction of the fire, and she sidled back up against the trunk to keep from being seen. Once she could no longer hear their footfalls, she took a final glance at the burning treetops and hurried into the clearing.
Harry looks confused, and I sigh, running a hand through my hair and mentally chastising myself. Maybe I had had a few too many drinks myself.
Before Harry could connect two and two together, Malfoy said, "My mother was originally a Black before she married my father and took on his family name. She and Sirius were second cousins."
The wizard shrugged. "Well, for the amount of trouble my lads went through to get that information, and the number of dealers they had to threaten, I'd have been slightly happier if we had a little more to go on. A clue as to who could've stolen it, for instance."
He had to hold the boys back as Ginny kissed her mother and, with a hurried goodbye, stepped into the Floo carrying a screaming Lily. Molly instantly procured two more plates of tart, and Albus and James ate their share happily. Harry gave her a grateful smile as the older woman came to stand beside him.
"Angie's birthday," came the distracted reply, and he sighed as he watched her pin the edge to the curtain.
birthday trip? And what was this whole thing about dropping her off at the station and picking her up a whole five days later?
He barely glanced in the direction of the screaming shooter as he made his way towards where Neville was on his knees, trying to resuscitate Lestrange, who lay in a pool of his own blood.
Lily instantly ran to him, and he picked her up, hoisting her on his hip and wiping the tears from her cheeks. He turned to see James standing with his arms crossed and an almighty scowl on his face.
She helped him to his feet and got on to the bed. Looking up at him with worried eyes, she asked, "Are you alright?"
There was more silence, and Harry could picture the two of them glaring at each other. He was wondering why they seemed so familiar with each other when he remembered that Camilla had mentioned being one of the founding members and had probably known Malfoy since before Antares was formed.
Running a hand through his hair, he exhaled a shaky breath and closed the distance between them. He glanced at Hermione, wondering if she had noticed, but she seemed to be lost in thought.
Harry nodded slowly. "I suppose that makes sense. So my nightmares weren't sudden, but what caused them to return?"
Harry sighed, turning away, and watched as Lily got up and walked over to the sink to wash her bowl.
he sometimes wondered, but he knew that it had; he knew because he remembered so vividly, as though it were yesterday.
Molly nodded in understanding. "I agree with that. None of my children ever went to pre-school. The fact that we couldn't afford it aside, we felt the same way as you do—there were enough of them to go around, and I loved watching over them all day. Even if it did get very exhausting. You could even say the Burrow was a pre-school of its own." She chuckled at that, and Harry smiled. "But times have changed, and the children need to be exposed to more things at a younger age these days if they're to grow up hail and healthy."
"Oh, please." Ten-year-old Dominique joined in the fray by whacking her brother atop the head and rolling her eyes at him. "So what if you're older than him? You're still
end up being the owner?" he asked, and Harry wondered if he should tell him that he was forgetting to do his job.
"It's just… Arthur and I were talking, and we both think that it's time you put the children back in pre-school."
Draco's heart stopped for a moment before beating at double the rate. Hermione hadn't told him that she had altered her parents' memories of their names, too, but he wasn't going to lose the chance. "Excuse me, ma'am," he said, jumping to his feet. "Would you mind coming along with me? I think I know whom you're looking for."
"Oh, it's no problem at all. What am I here for, if not to help the Head Auror successfully close cases?"
Harry watched as Lestrange's hooded eyes slowly turned to the two of them, those empty, soulless orbs sending a chill down his spine at the hopelessness in them. This was a man who had given up on life. This was a man who didn't know the meaning of
His complexion had been pale and he had looked quite malnourished; his clothes had been battered and worn, and he had looked and smelled like he hadn't bathed in days. But more than anything, it was the fact that the boy had seemed to be around the same age as James that had thrown Harry for a toss. It reminded him of when he was that age and had barely had enough to eat. But, at least he'd had a roof over his head and enough to feed himself that he hadn't had to resort to stealing.
Harry's grin could've lit up the entire shop. Draco turned around and hopped on the counter, focusing all of his senses and attention on the pasty in an attempt to ignore his racing heart. Harry's childlike smiles were deadly, especially when directed at a Draco who was in a sensitive mood at the moment. Coupled with his amazing baking skills and lovable personality, he was a man to die for. Which meant he was
standardised in a way, they're also specific to your needs. So, once you've completed the tasks, we'll discuss and analyse them, after which I will decide on the course our sessions will proceed. As for the tests, they're just standardised psychological evaluations that you'll take when you go through the paperwork. I may administer additional ones if I think them necessary, but we can discuss that when the time comes."
Harry's heart started to race as he sat up and turned towards her. "But I thought you didn't go because you didn't have enough tickets?"
She laughed. "I can see that. This is why I didn't want to leave everything and come away for two whole weeks."
He whistled for Pig, waiting for about five minutes before deciding that there was literally nothing stopping him from roasting the damned bird and eating it for dinner. Grumbling to himself, he stalked out of his study and down the stairs, focusing on what he was doing and consciously keeping the horrific images from flashing before his eyes.
Rabastan Lestrange's release was on Saturday. Today was Friday. And his nightmares were worse than ever.
"I know that. Doesn't mean I have to be happy about it, though." He didn't mean to make it sound like he was complaining, but the way Hermione's forehead creased into a worried frown made him wave his hand and try to make light of his words. "It's like you and Ron, except Ginny's far more reasonable when she isn't being completely adamant about something."
So every time he steps onto the bus, I know it's him without even having to look, simply because he brings with him the sickeningly sweet scent of everything wonderful and scrumptious and pure.
Hermione nodded, blinking away the tears. "Yes. I didn't like the fact that you and Ron kept fawning over me like I was a helpless, pathetic—" she broke off and inhaled sharply.
Harry scratched his ear, acknowledging that Draco had every right to be in a foul mood. It was the fourth morning since his son's disappearance, and they were sitting around, drinking coffee like it was just another day. Although Harry was doing everything in his power to make it so Draco could relax, it seemed to be backfiring.
Harry arrives at Antares a couple of hours earlier than he was meant to and accidentally overhears an argument between Draco and his wife; Harry confesses his marital problems to Draco; Draco explains to Harry how his body had gotten too used to sleeping potions and recommended a massage to help him relax; Harry oversleeps, worrying Ron and Hermione, but finally ends the day on a pleasant note with his kids.
There was some sort of commotion coming from inside as he walked past, and he paused out of curiosity. The owner of the bakery—a short, plump, balding, middle-aged Muggle—seemed to be in a right state. He was bellowing at the top of his lungs as he came around the counter, a rolling pin brandished in one hand. Harry frowned, wondering what had happened, when something small barrelled into him, nearly toppling him over.
"The morning session's nearly done," Audrey said as she pointed out various things in the room to Harry and then led him out. "We have another hour or so of free play, and then the younger children leave. The older children have a lunch break, and the afternoon session begins at two for them and the second batch of younger ones. The morning session usually has more kids because many of the parents work during the day, but you can choose to put them in either session, whichever one is more convenient for you; quite a few of our parents prefer to send their children here in the morning and homeschool in the afternoons."
"I dunno, help us become friends or something?" Harry blurted out, realising how stupid he sounded the moment the words left his mouth, and he wished he could take them back. He eyed Malfoy nervously, gauging the blond's reaction.
"Here," he said, handing over a box to Harry. "This is for you. And these," he gave four to Hermione, "are for us!"
They lapsed into silence again, but this time he was smiling, and he knew she was, too. "Come home soon. We all miss you."
His mother winced when he said someone like me, but she made no comment on it. Instead, she said, “Your father and I met in a similar way, so it isn’t all bad. The law exists to ensure that wizarding kind don’t go extinct and to ensure we remain within the community. Considering the sheer number of magical folk we have lost in the past two decades to death or to the Muggle world, you understand the gravitude of the situation, I’m sure.”
“I know,” he said softly. “I know, and I don’t blame anybody for what’s happened to me. I really don’t.” He managed a small smile as his conscience berated him for lying to his mother’s face. “I’ve made peace with everything that’s happened to me. And, let’s be honest, this is the best thing that’s happened to me in a long while, not considering these past three weeks.”
"Ginny, you said you wanted to put them in a school, and I found a really good one. I'm not saying we've to enrol them there, but Audrey works there, and I spoke to one of the parents whose kid goes there, and he recommended it, too—"
The moment he stepped out, Albus barrelled into him and climbed up his side to perch on his shoulders, yelling, "First!" as James, who was a minute too late, began tugging at his brother's leg to pull him off.
"I walked past this afternoon while on an errand and saw how packed the shop was, so I figured you'd be swamped and thought I'd drop by instead."
Draco stood staring at the portrait until the Fat Lady yelled at him for being rude and shooed him away. As he walked back to the Slytherin Common Room, fingers pressed against his tingling lips, he decided that he may have to re-evaluate the list of things he never wanted.
Harry sighed as he stared at his reflection in the mirror and felt the coolness of the water against his skin. After a time, he turned off the tap and dried his hands and face, pulling the toilet door shut as he walked back into his office.
Harry thought with a sigh as he Summoned some parchment and his Self-Inking Quill. He thought for a moment and decided that Saturday would be a good day to see Camilla, and Malfoy, again. He wanted a day to gather his thoughts and get his act straight before he came face to face with Camilla and everything she had confessed to him.
There were more bookshelves lining the wall opposite the rest area, and even a small alcove of sorts at the far end of the room, on the other side, where pouffes and large, comfortable-looking cushions stood around a low table. There were several small teapoys and side tables holding dainty vases, and even a record player that played gentle, soothing music. There was also the same subtle scent of lilacs and sage that he'd smelled in the lobby the previous evening; it left him feeling calm and comfortable, and he assumed that was the purpose behind their use.
To his left was the reception area, with a long, curved, white-topped mahogany desk on which were glass bowls full of sweets, notepads and pens, and two very Muggle-looking receptionists seated behind Muggle computers, chattering away on Muggle telephones. Behind them were mahogany panels and a large screen in the middle that played various medical-related things on repeat. One of the women smiled at him as he stepped away from the sliding doors and motioned towards the waiting area.
"That was an error in judgement on my part," Zabini offered quietly, laying a hand on Malfoy's shoulder, but Malfoy shrugged it off in a clear sign of annoyance before nodding at Harry.
Draco rolled his eyes. “I’m sorry, I don’t think I follow. Are you telling me that your celebrity status has forced you to settle down? Wow, quite popular, aren’t you?”
Malfoy nodded. "Of course. If tomorrow isn't possible, then the day after would be fine, but tomorrow would be preferable, even if it's just for a half-hour or so."
But what surprised him the most was what was at the end of the hallway. It was a mirror image of the reception desk, pharmacy and waiting area that he had just passed, but this time, the magic was palpable. Where there had been computers and notepads, there were Self-Writing Quills scribbling furiously across lengthy sheets of parchment that lay rolled up on the floor, self-typing typewriters that doled out prescriptions, and the cross-tech telephones. Behind the receptionists' desk was the same mahogany panelling, except instead of a screen, there was a large banner with moving pictures on it.
you I was bringing the kids home later this evening, and we've been trying to Fire-call you since an hour ago, to get you to open the Floo. I Apparated over thinking you weren't home, and here I find you fast asleep!"
"Mm," was the only response the blond could muster as he reached up for the brush, trying to contain his movements to the minimum. In the process, however, he almost dropped it, and Harry used his free hand to reach around Draco to catch the hairbrush. They caught it at the same time, and Harry tightened his grasp around Draco's fingers.
He drove past the groups of people milling around outside the station: families, friends, couples. He couldn't help but feel oddly bitter about it all. He knew that this time Ginny would only be gone for about two weeks, and that she would try coming home whenever she had time to spare between matches, but he couldn't help the emptiness that settled within him.
"I'm sorry, but I don't understand," he began, perturbed by first Malfoy and now Camilla's reluctance at her continuing as his Healer. "Is this because I no longer have an alias or because I breached client-Healer confidentiality or something?"
"Should shave," he mumbled to himself as he walked down the corridors to the Department for the Regulation and Control of Magical Creatures. Pushing the door open, he carefully made his way through the dark room and to the Deputy's office at the back. Poking his head in, he grinned. "You look like you could use some company."
"Alright, I'm driving," Harry sighed, pushing past the squabbling duo and falling into the driver's seat. The two took one look at him and began arguing again. He bit back another sigh as James leaned forwards and poked him in the shoulder.
He steeled himself and donned his trademark smirk. "Why, Potter, funny running into you here," he drawled. The Hogwarts Express tooted at him in disdain, chugging enough smoke to make Draco splutter and cough.
me," he muttered and felt a chill run down his spine. He whipped around, thinking he had sensed someone behind him, his heart racing.
"Oh. Oh, yes, my letter, right. Almost forgot about that," Neville blabbered, pouring a rather large amount of Firewhiskey into his mug.
"Oh, yes, you can, but that doesn't mean I have to be tempted," came Kingsley's diplomatic reply, and Harry grinned.
Breathing deeply, he focused on calming his racing heart as he swiped a hand across his sweaty forehead. Ginny stirred beside him, and he turned to find her watching him, bleary-eyed.
"Potter, Potter!" someone kept calling through the cacophony, sounding worried, and he tried to focus on what was in front of him.
He shook his head, unconvinced. His irritation was rising back to the surface, and he wasn't in the mood to listen to his wife lie to his face in the middle of the night.
He swallowed thickly and tried to calm his racing heart. She took another long swig from her glass, finishing the rest of the wine, and motioned for the waiter to pour her some more. Once her glass was full, she stared at it for a long moment before she spoke. "My parents were a part of the group of supporters that helped evacuate Muggles and Muggleborns in areas where the Dark Lord was unleashing his terror. I was only a child of two during the first war, so I don't remember them very well, but from the stories my brothers told me, I could tell that they firmly believed in the Order and the good and the Light, and that they would save all of wizard-kind."
Draco waved his hand. “I’m sure now that my mother knows you’re not a psychopath, she wouldn’t have any qualms. And my father… well, Mother will take care of him.”
It wasn't long before Neville and Ron returned, and Draco gladly made conversation with the former about the latest research work he was conducting with his interns while the latter yelled at his sister for causing a mess before anything had even begun. The evening passed quicker than Draco had thought it would; between discussing the book Hermione had lent him recently and the sad game the Chudley Cannons had displayed with Ron, as well as the alcohol that was going down by the gallon, he had managed to avoid Harry for most of the evening.
Dipping his quill in the pot, he flipped the sheet over and was just about to get down to business when he felt a sudden chill run down his spine. He snapped his head up, eyes scanning the room, his skin breaking out in gooseflesh.
She caught his arm before he could walk away and gave him a searching look. "How are the nightmares?"
He hadn't expected the confrontation to be literal until he found himself standing face-to-face with none other than his second worst nightmare: Harry Potter.
Again, no recognition in his eyes. Neville ploughed on. "You were one of the Death Eaters that helped torture them into insanity. You were one of the Death Eaters who destroyed a boy's childhood and shattered his dreams. Do you remember that?"
"Is that right?" Deciding that he might have him mistaken for someone else, Harry asked, "Do you think your uncle will be long?"
He stared at it for a long moment, regretting what he was about to do already, and, with a shrug, brought the mug to his lips.
Harry inhaled a deep breath and held it as he stared at the door to his office. Less than a minute later, it opened to reveal Buxley, and Harry let out his breath.
She waved it off with a laugh. "No, it's nothing, I just thought someone answered the phone, but no one said anything, so I was just wondering…"
She half-sighed, half-gasped as she hugged him awkwardly over the table top, kissing him on the cheek. "Oh, Harry, thank you for being so understanding."
He was just about to bring the cup to his lips when the chair opposite his was pulled back, and a mellow, female voice addressed him.
Camilla laughed airily and waved her hand. "No, no, nothing of that sort. The fault lies with me, and I understand your confusion, which is why I want to explain to you certain things about myself in order to iron everything out."
"I don't know my deputy told you, but I'm sure he was out of line. I apologise on his behalf." He bowed his head while continuing to maintain eye contact with Lisanna.
"Well, a historian friend of mine who has accumulated quite a few artefacts and relics over the past decade during his travels around the world is holding an auction this Sunday. He wants to build a research facility in London, and he's auctioning the artefacts in order to get the funds required for the establishment." Malfoy glanced towards Harry. "If you would like, I could call in a favour and have the vase put up in the auction. But, of course, that depends completely on the vase itself and whether or not my friend deems it worthy enough to be sold in his auction. He's rather picky when it comes to stuff like this."
He sighed and shook his head. "Miss Barkridge, if you've misplaced your vase, you need to go to the department that deals with—"
"You have a son," Harry said matter-of-factly as Malfoy came to sit on the sofa. The blond nodded, and Harry asked, "What's his name?"
Draco bit back a sigh. "No, because the nature of my work causes nosey patients, like you, to ask me where I live, and if they knew it was right here, then it would cause problems for me, like serious invasions of privacy."
Although I've succeeded in avoiding him every time by hiding my face, it's become exceedingly difficult as he seems hellbent on catching my attention.
"You know I can't, Hermione. I only managed to get a few days off now because I hadn't used up any of my leave days, and now I've used them all up, so I can't take any more days off."
"Get—help—now," Neville gasped as he continued administering CPR, but Harry knew the man couldn't be helped.
"It had more to do with convenience than anything else, but it helped prove that you had no hand in it. Everyone knows what a good rapport you two have built, and it's usually at the Head Auror's recommendation that they choose the Chief of the Undercover Unit."
I move aside as an elderly couple exits the bus and step on board, swiping my travel card against the electronic ticket reader in a hurry, intending to head to the back of the bus.
"Listen," she began, which was as sure a way to befriend someone as any, "I need you to do two things for me."
"Are you sure you have everything?" he asked Hermione for the dozenth time as he handed her the files and paperwork.
"Really?" she asked in a small voice, looking up at him with wide, brown eyes just like her mother's.
"Oh, you haven't heard? Ginny's covering the tournament. She's expected to be back this weekend, but you can never tell with these games."
"Alright, straight down to business, then," Camilla piped up as she grabbed a file and began pulling out sheets of parchment.
"No, Ginny—" he started, but she had already untied the pouch and held it upside down, watching as several objects fell out of the small cloth bag.
Harry laughed. "I don't believe that for one minute, but it would be my absolute pleasure to grab a drink with you."
Harry laughed, pinching the bridge of his nose to clear away the tears collecting in his eyes. "You're the second person to tell me that today."
"It's been five years," she whispered, her voice trembling, and Draco knew she was crying even without looking at her. "I've done everything I could. This camp was my last hope. And now… I don't know where else to look."
he said over and over in his head, but he couldn't bring himself to say it out loud. He felt like he would be insulting her and the memory of her family if he did. So he remained silent, trying to not let the lump in his throat choke him to death as he struggled to hold her gaze. Unable to, he dropped his gaze to his still-full glass of wine and quickly finished it, wincing at the pungent taste in his mouth. The waiter came and refilled his glass, and he quickly sipped from it, feeling the warm liquid gently ease the lump in his throat. He placed the glass on the table and looked up at the waiter expectantly. The man hesitated for a moment before filling the glass once more and walked away before Harry could finish it and demand another re-fill.
"Then," Harry said, his mind whirring in confusion as he tried to sift through this new information, "where did I go?"
"Lock the gate behind you!" Harry called, and Ron gave him a thumbs up, causing both him and Hermione to roll their eyes.
He turned to Neville, who stood staring at the dead man as though transfixed, and touched his arm. "What would you like to do with the body?"
"I'm sorry," he said in a choked voice, and she flashed him a smile that disappeared before it could placate him. "Were…" He cleared his throat. "Were your parents and brothers part of the Order? Maybe… maybe I met them. Maybe I—"
But even as he thought that, he could feel the gnawing tug in the back of his mind that confirmed that he had much more selfish a reason to do what he had done. Somehow, after embarrassing himself for the sake of sparing Malfoy a complicated conversation, he felt a twisted sense of relief settle within him. As though saving what could have ended up as a terrible argument between two people he wasn't close to at all somehow acted as a form of repentance for what had happened between him and Ginny.
Finally, as the sun set and Harry sipped on his lemongrass tea in a daze, Draco appeared before him and snapped his fingers twice. A fog that seemed to have settled over Harry's mind since the moment he had laid eyes on Draco lifted, the sharp clarity of his thoughts piercing through his skull and making his head ache.
"Hermione," Draco said, placing a hand on her arm. "Calm down." She looked at him with tears in hers eyes, and he smiled at her. "There's a township about thirty minutes south of here. We can use a payphone there."
"That's good." He reached out and tapped the button that opened the lift's doors, and just as he stepped out, he called, "Don't be a hero, Potter."
Harry nodded to the Aurors, and they practically had to carry the screaming reporter out of the room. Harry knew to expect a scathing article regarding his inadequacies soon, but he would handle that later. The Auror who had come in with Harry, who was previously in charge of the case, came to stand beside him as he turned to regard the anxious parents.
Feeling the exhaustion seep into his bones, Harry said in a strained voice, "I agree, but it's barely been three weeks since they left their previous pre-school. I don't want to rush them into another one before they're ready."
"I chatted with Al yesterday. He was complaining about how bored he was because Jamie and Lily were sick." She chuckled at that. "Ron sent me a message earlier saying the kids're over at their place."
not to mention the fact that it had left Hermione mighty impressed with him. Harry scrunched up his nose as he was reminded of just
"Maybe it's time we take a nap so we can build up our energy and beat Al and Uncle Ron next time, yeah?" Harry said as he ushered his son inside.
She bowed her head and said, "I truly am sorry. I'm very grateful for all you've done for my husband and son."
"The children call this the nap room, but it's mostly used for the more formal lessons, like etiquettes and stuff like that that noble children are expected to learn."
"It's November, Ron!" Harry said as he settled down in an armchair and draped the comforter over his daughter. "Anyway, where are your parents?"
to tell you all about my cases, trust me, but unfortunately they're confidential. So even if I wanted to, I couldn't tell you."
The lounge right in front of the reception desk was spacious, and rather luxurious for a small-town clinic, with plush white couches and armchairs, glass-topped coffee tables, delicate-looking plants, and a small contraption in the corner that was modelled to look like a waterfall, complete with gently trickling water. He would've thought it was magic if he hadn't known what Muggles were capable of.
he scolded himself as he struggled to hold his smile. "No, but my men are looking for him as we speak. It'll be easier if you were to help."
He watched as she poured herself another glass and swirled the dark liquid around, staring at it without replying.
Scorpius hugged his father, looking up with shining silver eyes that were the exact same as Draco's. "I learned it from you."
Humming in thought, he stared at the picture, cringing at how rigid both Malfoys were, his own smile looking painfully fake in contrast to their expressionless faces. He flipped the picture over, curious to see what was written, and was disappointed that there was no message. He was just about to put it back in the pile when something caught his eye.
Harry nodded. He'd been one of the few who had offered to file all the details regarding the remaining Death Eaters after the war. He hadn't really believed Lestrange's reason and had wanted to find out more, but no one seemed to care one way or another, so the subject was dropped.
"I'm sorry," he said, composing himself. "I'm all out of roses. I just sold the last few I had to the customer before you."
She watched him for a moment longer and then suddenly, so suddenly that it alarmed him, began to laugh. She shook her head and buried her face in her hands as her shoulders trembled with laughter, and when she looked up, tears streamed down her face, her cerulean eyes shimmering.
Harry nodded. "He's Walden Macnair's only son. He used an alias up until fairly recently, which is why our database never recognised him before, but we believe him to be the abductor because the day after he legally took on the name Christopher Macnair is the day the first person went missing."
"You could've remained unconscious for a few seconds longer, at least, considering the effort it took to carry you here," Harry joked, amused by the way the other man's cheeks coloured.
Grinning, Harry immediately put up a barrier, and Pig screeched, nearly ramming into it, fluttering in place angrily. It squawked at him, and he rolled his eyes.
"Would you like to retrieve anything?" the goblin asked Harry, and after the latter shook his head no, they exited the vault. The goblin locked it, handed the key to Harry, and they got into the cart.
He was a werewolf. Not by choice but by circumstance. And he only had two ways to deal: either he lived with it or he died with it.
"The original was found in Mr Malfoy's fireplace. This one's a duplicate we made before the forensics team took the other one."
"I can't reveal the name of my healer, Harry, that takes away the whole purpose of it. Besides, the place I chose to go to has a very strict confidentiality policy. They'll know if I've disclosed the name of one of their people."
She shook her head again, but she seemed conflicted. Sensing her hesitation, Harry leaned forward and smiled kindly. "Lisa, you came to me for help, didn't you?" She nodded. "And I fully intend to help you find your vase and catch the thieves that stole it." She stared at the table and sniffed. "But before I can help you, I'm going to need
He stared at the receiver for a moment before replacing it. "Who's an old man," he muttered to himself as he held out his handiwork and examined it from all angles. Nodding in satisfaction, he spritzed it with some water and picked up the card with the customer's details on it.
He had expected to be greeted by three energetic shrieks and his wife's warm smile, but all he saw was a quiet, empty living room. Sighing, he quickly heated up some coffee, slathered butter and jam on cold bread, and bit into an apple. He ate a muffin and drank some orange juice for good measure, but even though he was full, it felt like there was still an empty, gaping pit in his stomach.
"So you'll babysit Rosie and Hugh the weekend after this, right?" Ron asked with a grin, to which both Hermione and Harry rolled their eyes.
Harry finally manages to piece together crucial information, leading to a break in the case; Padma arrives with a German retinue to get in Harry's way; Meanwhile, Lily is sick and Ron has news for Harry about a prospective pre-school.
His deputy rolled his eyes, clearly unimpressed by Harry's insistence at sleeping in his office and refusing to go home. "Right. Anyway." He held out a file. "You gotta see this, Boss."
He looked up to see the brooding expression on his best friend's face and sighed. "Hermione, would you relax? I'm not trying to break our promise or whatever. This girl specifically came to
He heard her move around and felt something else press against his lips. When she instructed him to drink, he did, instantly feeling the heaviness that came with the Potion for Dreamless sleep. He managed to mumble an incoherent thank you before the heavy hand of sleep pulled him into the much welcome world of unconsciousness.
Her expression was intense, piercing, suffocating. Harry wanted to stand up and leave, and with every second that passed with him staring into her wide, blue eyes, he was regretting his decision of meeting her.
Harry smacked his lips. "I just wanted to kiss you. And there was mistletoe and everything so it only seemed right."
"I'm asking you not to go to the DMLE demanding that you be put on top of this," Kingsley said in the same tone of voice, making it sound more of an order than the request it was worded to sound like. Harry knew that one wrong step, and their relationship may very well turn sour.
Potter then motioned towards the room outside which they were standing. “I don’t want to seem too forward, but do you mind if I could speak with you alone?”
"Why don't you go spend the afternoon over at Ron and Hermione's? You haven't seen Ron in a while, yeah?"
Malfoy snapped his fingers and his parchment and quill zoomed over and stood at attention next to him. "Don't worry, I'm only taking down the underlying medical factors that could have something to do with your nightmares and your insomnia. These headaches of yours—how often to you get them?"
He had contemplated running away from all of it and pretending like his problems didn’t exist, but he was more realistic than that. He knew better than to believe in futile pipe dreams and fantastical promises that would never come true. His reality hit him hard every month, and there was only so far he could run before it devoured him whole. There was only so much hope and belief he could hold onto before he gave up.
"Hey, Lils," he said as they made their way to the kitchen isle. "What do you say about visiting your mummy and surprising her?"
Draco scoffed. "Knew it. Typical." His thoughts were muddled and he was still hung up on what he was reminiscing about earlier, so before he could reconsider it, he said, "You know, you break my heart."
But she was too quick for him and dodged out of reach, holding the pouch at arm's length. "Well, let's find out, then."
There were very few things in life that Draco Malfoy was certain he never wanted. One of them was returning to Hogwarts after the war to complete his seventh year. Another was reuniting with The Boy Who Lived, The Chosen One, The One That Rejected His Handshake.
Harry clapped the man on the shoulder and made his way to the safe. "Any external damage?" he asked the Auror kneeling before it.
each other." Scorpius gave him a quick hug, threw down the Floo powder with an, "I know", and stepped back as the green flames shot up. Just before he ducked into the fireplace, Draco said, "Oh, and I don't think you're too much like your mother."
Harry rolled his eyes, opening his mouth to retort when he suddenly realised something. "Wait, so how exactly did Neville know about all of this?"
Scorpius threw his head back and groaned, throwing his arms in the air and stalking down the stairs as he demonstrated his frustration, and Draco chortled to himself. He would never have dared exhibit such behaviour when he was his son's age, but he had decided years ago that he liked his—now ex—wife's more relaxed parenting style, and, over the years, it had helped him become less of a stick-up-his-arse kind of person himself.
“I told you not to do this,” he whispered, gently reaching over to lay a hand on the other man’s shoulder. The blond snarled and whipped around, tackling him to the ground. He muttered a quick Stunner and watched the other man fly off him and collapse a distance away.
He trailed off again, sitting back with a sigh. Malfoy was frowning, and Harry didn't take that as a good sign. "You said you've been having insomnia?"
Harry's smile tightened, but he realised that now that he was calm, and his headache had settled down to a dull throb around his temples, he was more comfortable with discussing what had happened with Ginny after witnessing the argument between Malfoy and his wife. Somehow, he felt like Malfoy would understand his situation better now than when he had come two days ago.
Malfoy's jaw was set, and he looked like he wanted to argue, but Harry was adamant. The conversation about the vase had allowed him to realise several things, one of which was that he had, in fact, decided for Malfoy to be his Healer so that they both could benefit from it, but also because he didn't want their relationship, or lack thereof, to remain as it was: stagnant and unmoving. He had contacted Antares with one purpose: to find respite from the madness growing within him and swallowing him whole, and he had come to the realisation that fixing something that should have been fixed a long, long time ago might just be the first step to that.
Moving around the room, he picked up his wand from the bedside table and waved it, muttering spells under his breath. The lamp fixed itself and carefully stood back in its original position. The pillows sewed themselves back together, stuffing and all, and flopped on to the bed. The scratch marks in the carpet and the walls slowly disappeared, and he looked around the room.
Harry realised his jaw had fallen open, and quickly shut his mouth and cleared his throat. "That's pretty much all I asked you to find out, Buxley."
He pressed the button and waited with two other Healers, half-heartedly listening in on their conversation to distract himself from thinking about Camilla and their lunch and his latest nightmare.
The duo looked up from Lily's bed, where they were playing some sort of hand game. "We're fit as a fiddle, so can we go out and play, now?" James piped up, climbing out of bed.
Ron's disembodied head bobbed as he nodded. "Sure, sure, no problem. 'Mione and I don't mind at all. I mean, Ginny and you've looked after Rosie and Hugh a bunch of times before, so it's all good. Just thought I should tell you is all."
"It's wonderful to see you too, Harry darling," Molly replied, kissing him on both cheeks. "Oh! I've made your favourite—Treacle Tart!"
"I know, and I'm sorry that I can't be with you, but I have a session with an important patient soon, and I can't—"
Harry put on the goggles and bent down to examine the unfolded envelope. At first, he didn't see it, but a moment later it was clear. In invisible ink, written diagonally across the envelope, was a note. A threat, to be more specific. Aimed at him.
He nodded as he got to his feet and moved to the front of the boat, peering out the porthole and squinting as he caught sight of the towering structure that was the penitentiary.
he says," Harry interrupted, chortling. "Ah, man, you're such a riot." He sobered down when Draco glared at him and said, "Alright, alright. Anyway—this couple came into the bakery today, and what started off as them being cute and lovey-dovey turned into them competing to see which one could get their tongue farther down in the other's throat."
“Shouldn’t you be searching for a new place of employment instead of getting wasted in the middle of the day?” his father finally questioned without looking up from the newspaper he was reading.
Although he had just come up with the thought of surprising her after seeing his kids, he had more ulterior motives for it; he knew apologising on the phone wouldn't do any good after their argument, and although he wanted to see Ginny as soon as possible, he knew suddenly making an appearance while she was working and still upset from their fight wasn't exactly the best of ideas. So, he decided that waiting for her to calm down and finish off her work would be the best course of action. He knew she would be done by Friday, since she originally was supposed to have come home on Saturday, so Saturday morning seemed like a good idea.
best friends, which led to more than one unpleasant confrontation from a particular, foul-mouthed ginger.
So, in an effort not to back down, he pushed up against Harry for a fraction of a second and turned his face towards Harry's so his lips nearly brushed the other's cheek before pulling away and holding the hairbrush out. "Don't take too long. I'll be outside."
Ron leant forwards, elbows on his knees, a thoughtful frown on his face. "Did you check up on that?"
Once he was tucked into a corner of his toilet, he turned on his phone, and his eyebrows shot up when he saw that he had received a message from Camilla. Curious, he quickly opened it and scanned the contents. It wasn't written in the usual, formal way all her letters were, confirming his suspicion that this was something personal. He had only left his phone number for the sake of emergencies as their correspondences were usually through letters, and was concerned about why she had chosen to contact him via text message. She wanted to know if he could meet with her for lunch because there were things she wanted to discuss and that it would be completely off the record because she was doing this on her own time.
The first witch waved a hand in impatience. "Oh, what does it matter who said. One of the Aurors, they was standing outside the ladies room—a rather odd place to stand for some idle chatter, I thought—and one of them was shaking his head and saying, 'He hung himself by his shoelaces, mate. We didn't get a peep outta him'. I'm telling you, Bernice, Macnair is dead!"
"Tart!" the boys cheered. He laughed as he held onto Albus as the five-year-old swung from side to side.
His own mind was already annoyed by his persistence, so he assumed Malfoy was, too, but the wizard only nodded, a patient smile on his face, and somehow, Harry felt as though he'd been bested, this time around.
"Oh, they did? That's good. I was worried they were still nervous about…" he trailed off, and Ginny hummed in thought.
"When what used to be three or four clients slowly started to increase to nearly a dozen or so, he realised that it was impossible to help them all on his own and started recruiting other Mind Healers who shared the same beliefs and ideas as him. Thus, a sort of unofficial private organisation was started, and within three years' time, more and more magical folk from around the world started to consult with us, causing us to branch out from just patients who suffered from war trauma to patients who suffered specific ailments of the mind.
Harry excused himself and walked to where his deputy was giving two other Aurors some instructions. Once they were gone, he jerked his chin towards Lisa and said, "She's hiding something."
They had just left the trucks in the parking lot of the North York Moors National Park and were currently making their way to the safehouse—originally a rundown building where the Muggles used to store grain—where Lestrange would spend the last of his days.
Harry smiled more freely, enjoying the light feeling that settled over him after everything that had happened in the previous hour. "What can I say? That's the sort of person I am."
"Good afternoon, Mr Potter. I hope I didn't inconvenience you by asking you out on such short notice," she said politely as she shook his hand.
Hermione was by his side in an instant with a glass of water and a wet towel. She Scoured the vomit on the ground and his shoes and wiped his mouth with the towel.
delicacy? What if the person you were against hadn't been an old friend of yours and this had turned into an international conflict? You're the Head Auror, for Godric's sake, so act like one!"
"Oh. Fantastic." Harry sat up straight, anticipation replacing his earlier awkwardness. He watched as Malfoy rose and walked to his desk. The blond rummaged around for a bit before finding a slim folder and bringing it over to Harry. "What's this?" he asked as he took the file from Malfoy.
Draco inhaled the smell of the freshly-baked goods and swallowed. He glanced up to see Harry watching him with an expectant smile. "I brought all your favourites," he said. "So you have no excuse not to finish every last crumb."
He groaned loudly and sprawled across the desk, revelling at the feel of the cool glass top against his throbbing forehead.
"I heard that yous was looking for the Wilkinses?" she said with a thick Australian accent, looking between him and the other volunteers at the desk.
Neville flinched, but Harry's ears were ringing, and his heart was racing so he barely noticed. "Of all the
His mother had once suggested he travel the world, but for what? He wasn’t the adventurous sort. He preferred to remain in a place he was familiar with, where there was some sense of security—someplace and someone to run back to with his tail between his legs when the going got tough.
Harry chuckled and nodded. She turned back to watch her sleeping husband, and Harry couldn't dissipate the lump of guilt that settled in his stomach. He wanted to apologise to her for not stopping her husband before he keeled over from overworking himself, but he didn't know how to breach the topic without upsetting her. Before he could come to a solution, she spoke up.
He helped her out of the study and down the stairs, carrying her down the last few steps because she started giggling uncontrollably. Putting her down on the sofa, he went to get her a glass of water, but by the time he got back, she was curled up, fast asleep.
name—when he caught himself just in time. His heart began to race; he was sure she'd noticed the pause, so he quickly scrawled
Regretting what he was about to do even as he turned towards the door and pulled it open, Harry still smiled widely and put on the most innocent look he could manage as he stuck his head out and said, "Malfoy? I thought I heard you out here. Sorry, I'm a little early, I wanted to—oh."
Harry jerked to the side and exclaimed in surprise. Looking up at him with the same intense blue eyes was the boy Harry was currently brooding over. There were crumbs around his mouth and dirt everywhere else. He looked like a street boy from the back alleys of London.
Malfoy laughed again, and Harry couldn't help but think that it was very pleasing to the ear. The blond sounded like a young boy who couldn't contain his happiness. It reminded Harry of when Albus laughed uncontrollably. It was just a happy sound.
Buxley frowned. "I haven't noticed them snooping around here since Mrs Weasley joined. Should I let the lads know?" He motioned to the younger Aurors in the break room, laughing at some joke one of the others had said, and Harry shook his head.
"I couldn't care less," Harry replied as he pulled the burger out and took a massive bite. "'E go' me 'unch."
He walked over to the coffee machine and poured the decoction into two mugs, heating them up with a quick spell and adding a dash of milk to them. Taking the mugs over to where Hermione was grumbling away, he placed hers on the desk and Summoned the box of croissants he'd brought from home because he'd left before breakfast.
Now that he said it out loud, he realised how true it was. Ginny was always around to look after the kids and the house, to mediate between her parents and Harry, and to handle most things outside of Harry's work that he had just taken everything she did for granted. The fact that she was always there when he came home after a tiring day with a hot cup of tea ready was one of the many things that he had never really taken the time to appreciate her for, especially of late. And it was precisely because Ginny dealt with all the minor stressors in their everyday lives that having her break down on him was something he didn't know how to handle.
"I had a dream," Harry blurted out suddenly, causing Draco to quirk an eyebrow and hum in curiosity.
"It's just…" she trailed off, and Harry bit back a sigh. These women and their apparent inability to get to the point.
"Everything alright back there?" The driver calls, but before I can respond, the bespectacled bane of my day answers first.
"They want a full report on all events that transpired, starting from you leaving the Ministry till you returned, sir. In writing."
I grimace, taking his haggard appearance to be a sign that the proposal didn't go well. "Didn't see you on the bus today," I say lightly, unwilling to be the one to open Pandora's box.
Harry stared at his tea and hummed under his breath. The implications behind that question were innumerous, but he knew what Malfoy meant. Was he, Harry Potter, willing to spill his deepest, darkest secrets to Draco Malfoy, who had been his sworn nemesis for most of his childhood?
He really had meant what he'd said to Mrs Buxley; he would always be grateful to the man. But everyone has their time in the limelight, after which they need to step back and let other prospective candidates take their place and support them to the best of their abilities. Harry knew his time would come sooner or later, and he knew that he would be more than glad to hand everything over to his successor and retire. Although he was passionate about his job, he didn't quite love it as much as Buxley did.
"You got it without even knowing what it was?" Harry asked incredulously as Hermione took a large gulp.
Padma frowned, and the men behind her shifted again. "Head Auror Potter," she snapped, the coolness of her voice sending a shiver down Harry's spine. "That man is under investigation for murder, and yet you insist that he's innocent even though he is the primary suspect in your case."
Harry sat back, scone in hand, as he listened to her chatter on. He was with her well past noon, enjoying her company and his much-awaited day off.
Padma turned and nodded to Harry, and before he stepped forward, he muttered to the Auror who had come to get him from the corner of his mouth, "Notify Hermione Weasley from the DMLE about the situation. Now."
"And this is…?" he asked awkwardly when the young witch continued to watch him with eyes filled with anticipation.
Many, many apologies for the random hiatus! I moved to London to pursue a very intense master's degree in neuroscience and it has been quite the handful. Thanks to this pandemic, though, I've got some free time on my hands, so I aim to update this regularly! Hope everyone's safe and sound, and here's two chapters to keep you going!
She eyed the toffee for a long moment before she finally took it. She unwrapped it and plopped it in her mouth, sniffling as she laid her cheek against his chest.
An amused smirk spread across Malfoy's face as he said, "Worry not because Astoria won't be coming. She's hosting a dinner party on the same night with her sister. I was going to take Camilla, but she really isn't very fond of auctions and the like. She finds them rather distasteful and tedious—something about everyone having to put on airs and fake sophistication—and she spends all of them drinking a little too much and whinging the entire time. So you'd actually be doing me a favour."
Harry thought for a moment before saying, "I want you to get a hold of as much information as you can about the Barkrdiges' murders, and whatever intelligence you can glean from your lad in the German task force about Erhard Whatshisname."
Draco took it, allowing himself to be pulled off the bed, and stood still for a second, focusing on the feeling of solid ground under his feet.
He looked towards the bathroom door when Hermione and Harry exclaimed, and Hermione rushed out to the bedroom and back with a towel. Draco sighed and stared at his beer. "Some party."
Harry sat down, the uncomfortable silence stretching between them, and he racked his brain on what to say. As though feeling the same, Draco began to speak.
Draco looked up at Harry, his eyes as wide as saucers, then plucked the note off the table and read it. He scoffed, then read it again, then scoffed again.
Harry glanced up at the blond, but neither his tone of voice nor the expression on his face gave anything away.
Lately, his relationship with Ginny had gotten sort of… tense, if he had to put it in a nice way. He had thought that he was at fault, at first, considering how much he'd been away recently due to all the Auror work, and his insomnia, but Ginny wasn't making it any better.
Harry raised the barrier slightly, and just as the bird turned towards the treats, put it back down. He shrugged and grinned when Pig fixed wide, accusing eyes on him and shook the letter.
Potter flopped down on the lone sofa in the room and loosened his tie. He patted the space beside him, but Draco stood where he was, crossing his arms and frowning down at the other man. “Explain yourself, Potter.”
He doubled over and threw up all over the floor, and Harry quickly Scoured the vomit before the forensics team noticed—they were already annoyed that the reporters walking around had contaminated the scene—and Transfigured a bauble on the mantle into a glass.
Harry had to use all of his willpower to keep his eyes fixed on the blond's face. "Didn't you bring me here again like last time?"
Harry smiled. "And Erhard was right." He reached across the desk and took Lisa's hand in his, squeezing it as he smiled at her. "So, why don't you and I go find him so we can prove that he's innocent?"
Hermione didn't look very convinced, but before she could reply, there was the gush of the Floo and Ron's voice called from the next room.
Harry gave him an incredulous look. "Trained Aurors stress you out while you're completely fine having a tea party with dangerous prisoners?"
Buxley glowered at him, Levitated the pile off the desk again, and left Harry's office while muttering expletives loud enough for him to hear. Rolling his eyes, Harry signed the parchment and placed it on the completed pile. He'd just started with the next case study when there was a knock on the door.
" Harry said, and Draco smiled at the whiny tone of his voice. In all the years he'd known the man, he had come to learn that Harry only behaved childishly with Draco, and that was something the latter revelled in.
And now he was paying dearly for it. He scratched his arm and winced as sharp pain shot through him. Looking down, he eyed the long, bleeding marks on his arms and legs and sighed.
He heard Buxley cough behind him at the rather exaggerated truth, but Harry was willing to risk it because he was sure he would win.
Draco dove sideways and picked up the receiver, cradling it between his cheek and shoulder as he continued wrapping the bouquet he was working on. "Hello?"
"So, I'm guessing you won't be the one to help me figure that out," Harry said, trying to contain his impatience but feeling uncontrollably irritated for some reason.
Ginny came up behind him and hugged him, and he expected her to move away, considering he was still dripping wet, but she continued to cling on to him. He frowned. "Gin? Is everything alright?"
He watched as Camilla's cab drove off, feeling a sense of déjà vu settle over him as the car disappeared around the corner. Pulling his phone out, he hit the speed dial button and pressed the phone to his ear. Six rings later, a familiar voice answered.
"He must feel pretty betrayed," Draco said, flicking one of the Christmas decorations by the fireplace. "I mean, I'd think you were a traitor too, if I were him."
The two nodded and began the process of sealing the evidence in a magically reinforced case that preserved it against damage. Harry left them to themselves and strode across the room. Catching Buxley's eye, he jerked his head to the side and walked to the far wall. Buxley excused himself and walked over, looking tense.
Draco glanced at the upside down headline of the article it was opened up to, not bothering to hold in his sigh of resignation.
“Wow, you haven’t changed one bit, have you?” Potter grinned. “I was banking on you being shocked for long enough that I could just get you to sign the agreement and we could make this official right away, but I guess I underestimated you.”
"I have a client waiting for me, and I better get to them before you steal them from under my nose as well."
Ginny turned sideways to reveal Pigwidgeon, and it became very clear as to why the—still-tiny—owl wasn't creating utter havoc. It was too busy munching on the snacks Ginny was holding out for it.
"This is only a theory, but if you didn't pass through the portal to your world, then you must have been stuck between both realms, which explains why you could tap into my thoughts or were summoned back by my wish—I was the sole string that kept you tethered to reality, and a slight tug in my direction caused you to topple back into this realm."
Realising that was his cue to leave, Harry stood up and made his way around the bed. "Get some rest, Buxley. I'll see if I can send Rogers 'round to visit later."
"Longbottom here's gonna be helping with the transfer," Robards said, jerking his chin towards Neville. "I don't trust those idiots from your platoon that fell overboard. Can't even dock a bloody boat and they wanna escort a convicted prisoner."
"Me and Little Lou are gonna sleep in Uncle George's room, and you can't sleep with us today, Al!" James declared as the kids strode into the living room.
"Lily's had a bit of a fever for the past two days, but she's up and about, now. Jamie and Hugo caught her cold, so they're walking around with stuffy noses, dribbling snot all over the place. But otherwise, they're fine."
Buxley scoffed. "I'll say. When we got that frantic memo from the front desk about some girl threatening to sue the Auror Department for doing a lousy job, I had a feeling she was more trouble than she's worth."
Ron nodded again, and an uncomfortable silence stretched between them before the redhead said, "I know we never talked about this, even after the war, when we each had to deal with our own stuff, but just like you can tell when me or Hermione are in pain, we can tell, too, you know. Even if you don't talk to us about it."
"I thought I'd come call you to bed, but I saw you sleeping and tried to wake you up, and when you wouldn't, I decided I didn't want to bother you, so I was about to leave—"
"You don't have to actually answer," Draco said, pouring the water into two mugs. "Would you like milk or sugar in yours?"
Robards' promotion had been mostly political in nature. It didn't make any sense for the man to just up and decide to take up such a taxing position when he'd just decided to retire.
"I'm good. Let's go," Harry said, placing his palm on the small of Hermione's back and steering her towards the lift.
lied, Harry was sure—or at least hoped—that she had a good reason for it. There was no need for him to let Angelina know that she'd been lied to—especially since it seemed like it had something to do with him.
"That's good, then." Harry signed off the last sheet of parchment and kept it to the side, placing his mug before him. "I hope I don't have to remind you that you'll only be present during the release? And you'll remain with the other unit once the transfer starts?"
of a collision, he jogged down to the main road, baring his teeth in a satisfied grin as the rest of his squadron surrounded the four men. As he neared the scene, his partner came up and slapped him on the back, causing him to grunt in pain.
"Stop being paranoid," he scolded himself, turning back to the parchment—although he couldn't shake off the feeling that someone was watching him.
Harry held his arms out, eyebrows raised. "Exactly. And I feel the same way. I'm dealing with my problems in the best way that I can, and I don't want you to keep trying to mother me."
As he drove, his mind was so full of thoughts about Ginny and the kids, of whether they'd be alright, of whether Neville would be alright, of whether the transfer would happen smoothly, that he almost drove right past his house.
"Not really," Harry responds, sounding oddly dismissive. "I'm rather selfish, if I say so myself. I just do what I want to do and impose that on other people. Like I did and am still doing with you." He gestures to the spread before us.
He handed the boy a few more crumpled notes and coins. The blond stared at it and slowly shook his head. "I can't take this."
"Robards needs to learn when to shut his mouth. Especially now that he's leading the undercover division."
, while the German Ministry declared the case closed." She patted the file and said, "They didn't get very far, however."
just in case as he pulled out the file Buxley had left him. He held it out to her, but before she could take it, he said, "Look, Padma, I don't want to involve you in some international skirmish, so if you don't want to—"
He shut the door to his office and trudged over to his desk, slumping into the chair with a groan. The fact that he was about to come face to face with a Death Eater was bad enough, and now, not only did he have to make sure that
He spends more time with Weasley and them every Monday at the Leaky. How come he's never too busy to miss out on that?
Harry reached forward to place a hand on the blond's and smiled. "I know. I know what your family did." He inhaled deeply. "Your mother saved my life. I don't think you're guilty."
"Well, that's not enough, is it?" Draco yelled, his voice trembling, and jumped to his feet. He grabbed Harry by the arms and shook him. "My son has been kidnapped, Potter! My little boy! Yet you're telling me your best effort hasn't been able to find him!"
now behaved like they were the best of friends (which may have been a slight exaggeration, but still). Of course, that made Draco think no end of himself and fed his ego greatly, but it was also awkward because Harry seemed to spend quite a lot of his free time with Draco than his
Malfoy seemed slightly taken aback by the sharp tone that Harry used. "I see that some things never change," murmured, more to himself than to Harry.
"You and me both," Neville replied with a shake of his head. "What about Ginny and the kids? I heard she's covering the tournament this season?"
Lily paused, stared at her doll, and then began to cry. Alarmed, Harry cradled her to his chest, holding her and stroking her hair as he tried to pacify her.
When Lestrange only continued to stare, showing no sign of recognition, Neville shifted and continued. "I'm Neville Longbottom. Son of Frank and Alice Longbottom. Do you remember them?"
Although the day had started off on a dreary note, what with Lily waking up crying from a fever, and Hugo and James also coming down with colds, it took a turn for the better when Molly and Arthur had returned. The Weasley matriarch gathered up the kids in a matter of minutes and administered some household potions to remedy their colds, and not half an hour later, the boys were frolicking around out in the sun, and the girls were going about playing house. Ron left to go check up on Hermione and the shop soon after, leaving Harry to sit outside with his in-laws, making small talk while basking in the warm rays of the morning sun.
Harry studied Draco for a long moment, trying to find the so-called cold-hearted narcissist in him. In fact, the man standing beside him was so different from the Draco Malfoy that he remembered that it was as though they were two completely different people.
"Reckon this means I'm going to have to hunt for a school on my own, since Ginny's too busy with the tournament," he said with a tired sigh.
She shrugged. "I saw it on the menu and pointed at it." He stared at her, and she glanced sideways at him. "What?"
After what seemed like an inordinately long time, Draco finally stirred. He looked up, silver eyes glassy and unfocused. “Harry,” he croaked, and Harry held him close, blinking away the tears. “Harry,” he said again, holding up a trembling hand. His wedding ring shone on his ring finger, and Harry kissed it, placing Draco’s palm over his heart.
Ron came in just then, hair and clothes dishevelled and face red. "Oh, good, you're here. Time for my nap, then." He walked over to his wife and gingerly picked his son up. Hugo struggled, but Ron shushed him as he made his way to the stairs. He clapped Harry on the back as he passed him by, and trudged upstairs, trying to coax a half-awake Hugo back into slumber.
Draco pressed his lips together to keep from smirking in amusement. Granger always had a quick tongue, just as sharp as Draco's, if not sharper, and Slytherin's basilisk eat him alive if he ever admitted it, but he appreciated her sarcasm and dry wit quite a bit.
Camilla smiled, and her eyes twinkled in a way that made Harry fear for the worst. "Then why not be Harry's healer yourself?"
He inhaled deeply, enjoying the pressure along his temples and the back of his head, and the dull throbbing in his head continued to recede even as Malfoy proceeded with his ministrations. He could feel the cool silk of the blond's robes gently caress the back of his fingers, making him relax his grip on the armrest.
They stared at the objects, Harry's heart in his mouth, and Ginny let out a soft gasp. "Harry… is this…"
Harry went red in the face, his cheeks burning, and he tried very hard to not lose his composure. "Thanks. I'm, uh, is Zabini going to be alright with that?"
"You deserve it," Harry said with a kind nod. "Don't tell him I said so, but Buxley speaks very highly of you. Just keep doing whatever you're doing, and there shouldn't be any problems."
The child immediately dropped his hand from Harry's grasp and stepped back. Harry held his hands up and tried to look as un-threatening as possible. The boy shook his head.
Harry turned to face her and smiled as calmly as he could. He stretched out an arm, motioning to the towel hanging beside her, and she threw it to him. He caught it deftly and dried his face, inhaling the familiar, soothing scent of the Burrow that clung to it. Once he was calm enough, he looked at Hermione and nodded.
"One more minute! Gosh, you act as though I'm forcing you to do it," came the muffled reply, and he sighed in annoyance.
Buxley had been Harry's mentor when he had first joined the force and the one who had supported him throughout his career as an Auror. He knew that Robards had only stepped down so Harry could become Head because he trusted Buxley to look out for him and make sure he didn't do anything stupid.
Harry nodded and pulled back. Rising to his feet, he tapped his wand against the side of the fireplace twice and stepped back. After a moment, green flames erupted, and James stumbled out, looking a bit pale.
"Well, considering it was your idea to have her take on the paperwork…" Harry trailed off, falling into step beside the Minister.
Neville needed this more than anybody else, he knew. The man deserved what little peace of mind this whole experience would get him, and if Harry could help, he would do it without being asked twice. Neville was someone who had gone through so much because of and for Harry—he couldn't even begin to imagine what sort of nightmares he'd had when he thought of all the torture Neville had been put through.
Harry rose to his feet, and both Malfoy and Camilla stood up with him. They walked him to the door, and Harry said, "I'm really sorry for all the trouble. Is it possible for us to meet sometime soon to reach a decision?"
Yet, why was he unable to feel anything when he thought back on them? Was he subconsciously subduing his emotions in order to protect himself from any hurt or pain? Did he just need more time to forget them? To forget
"Let's just say that things worked out for the best." Kingsley nodded in a way that said the matter was closed but added, "And also so you can smuggle Neville in without getting kicked off the force." He gave Harry a knowing look. "Nobody needed to be able to read his mind to know that he wanted to be there."
Harry laughed as he read the postscript, deciding to ignore his tears because they didn't seem to want to go away anytime soon.
Despite being neighbours, they hadn't interacted much—much to Draco's chagrin, although he would never admit it—until the fateful day his mother had dragged him over to the bakery next door and the blond had had the chance of tasting Harry's baking.
Harry glanced up at the cup of sweet-smelling tea Hermione held out to him and slowly took it, staring at the dark liquid as it swirled inside the mug. He carefully brought it to his lips and sipped, sighing as the warmth flowed through him. He watched as, across from him, Neville sat back in his chair and sighed, looking exhausted.
Harry's eyes flew open, and he instantly regretted having said that. Heart thundering in his chest as an image of Malfoy flashed through his head, he fumbled for words, mind racing to come up with a believable lie. "This fellow who works at the Ministry," he finally managed, his heart pounding a frantic rhythm against his ribcage, "I just happened to mention pre-schools, and he said he had a son who went to Silver Sprigs, so we got to chatting about it."
what had happened. Well, it wasn't entirely his fault for imagining that Malfoy had drugged him, considering the situation and all, but now it made more sense.
Perching on the edge of the counter beside his desk, Harry shrugged. When Kingsley continued to watch him expectantly, he bit back a sigh and said, "I just thought it was time I took the family out on a well-deserved vacation."
Unable to reach a solution, he decided that he needed someone to tell him what the hell he was supposed to do to keep the pieces of his crumbling life from falling apart. He glanced towards the fireplace, and the only image that flashed through his mind was that of a smiling blond holding a teacup, and he knew what he had to do.
Malfoy exhaled, long and slow, making him look deflated, and then said in a measured voice, "Mr Potter, while I appreciate your concern for me, we're here to help
Draco stared at him, belatedly realising that Harry still had his arms around him but feeling relief in the warmth of his embrace. "How are you so unfazed by all this?"
"I know," Neville immediately said, holding up his hands. "You're right, it was a very stupid thing to do."
"Yeah, I've been giving her some potion Mum told me to mix in her milk, so she's calmed down a lot since last night. Her fever's gone down, too. She should be better in another day or two."
Harry waved a hand. "I want you to take a few of your men and go back to the hotel Lisa had been staying at. I want you to ask around and see if anyone had seen someone who looked like Hertzfeld in the past few days. The moment you find a clue, I want you to follow up on it, and come back here only when you've found either Hertzfeld or something that would lead us to him."
Harry shot the wizard a knowing look, but Buxley pretended not to notice by seeming awfully interested in the case study. "No, just a follow-up."
She glanced up and gave him a weird look that oddly made him feel like she was trying not to tell him something. "Yes."
Harry's eyes flew open, and his vision focused on a bewildered Hermione standing over him. He swallowed thickly as he swiped his sleeve across his forehead that was drenched with sweat.
Draco opened his mouth to make a sound and alert the Aurors outside, but the man pressed a hand against his mouth and motioned for him to be quiet. Draco remained frozen, pure terror coursing through his veins, trying to send telepathic messages to the men outside, when something caught his eye.
"Ask Kingsley," he snapped, and she glared at him. "Look, I'm not at liberty to say, alright? So can you stop badgering me about it and just—I don't know, find out some other way?"
Happy New Year to all my readers! I hope you have a meaningful new year where you overcome obstacles and grow stronger and wiser from experiencing hardship.
with Lestrange and blow his carefully set up cover," Kingsley called over his shoulder, and Harry grinned as he walked back to his desk.
"It's nothing. I spoke to Audrey about the pre-schools since Ron said she could help, and I just got back from the place she works at. It's a pretty nice school. It's for the rich and noble kids, so there won't be any problems of discrimination or the stuff that happened last time."
you of anything!" Harry all but yelled, his voice having risen several octaves. He had jumped to his feet and was pacing up and down the room in his agitation. "I'm just
Running a hand through his hair, he strode into the living room, staring intently at Pig and ignoring the way his skin broke out in gooseflesh.
Draco watched as Harry cleaned the bedroom in a chaotic rush, waving his wand to change the sheets, dust the table lamps, and fix the drapes all at once as he bustled about.
On his way, he took a slight detour to a certain bakery where he bought a muffin and paid quite a bit more than necessary.
"And of course you have to say it in a way that makes me wonder if it's meant to be a compliment or an insult," she said flatly, looking miffed.
A sob escaped Hermione's lips as she clutched the woman. "You really know them? Monica and Wendell Wilkins?"
Scorpius winced, ducking his head at the bite in Draco's tone. "Sorry. Maybe I'm a little too much like Mum."
He stared ahead, biting his tongue, but she'd explained to him what had actually happened, so he decided that he could let it go—for now. She ran her hand through his hair and he nodded. "OK."
He paused right in front of his deputy and grabbed him by the shoulders again. "What if Hertzfeld is actually innocent?"
"It's this way," Draco called as he reached the bottom of the stairwell, waving to his son and pointing in the opposite direction. With another display of irritation, the thirteen-year-old jogged back to his father and fell in step beside him. Draco patted him on the back. "You need to relax; it's just an exhibition."
enjoy spending an entire week in some isolated place with insects and mosquitos and no "fun food" as they called it.
She then picked up a folded piece of parchment, looked like she was about to say something, then, seeming to realise that it was the wrong note, began to babble hurriedly about what a clumsy, ditsy person she was and how her grandfather always told her that an airhead like her could never do anything right.
"They're back, aren't they?" he finally asked, a knowing look in his eyes. "Your nightmares. They're back."
A shuddering breath escaped his lips and he closed his eyes, trying to block the words out, but they were burnt into the back of his eyelids. He felt a warm hand on his back and turned to see Harry's worried face.
"What reason would I have to stand up for him if he really was the man who killed my family?" Lisa replied. Her voice trembled, revealing how scared she was, but she stood tall and firm, and Harry was very impressed by her gallantry. "Wouldn't that be a better outcome than having to take this situation any further?"
Malfoy shrugged. "There are enough corridors in this building for us to explore, I would think. I'm quite sure that there are a few I have yet to find. Would you like to accompany me?"
"No," Draco said, looking at the message above the fireplace. "These messages are clearly for me. Whoever wrote them is displeased that I wasn't punished for my crimes and was saved by you. I may be able to help you find this… this monster."
Harry laughed and spun on the spot, Apparating into the atrium. He stood for a moment and looked at the long queues of witches and wizards lined up in front of the Floos, wondering if it were better for him to simply Apparate into Antares. Deciding that it was the better choice, even if two consecutive Apparitions on an empty stomach would leave him feeling very drained and light-headed, he strode out of the Ministry, walked to the closest Apparition point, and Disapparated.
Draco finally looked at Harry and smiled, but it was the smile of a broken man who had seen far too many horrors in his lifetime to believe in promises.
He fumbled around in the dark as he tried to turn on the lights, and then deciding that he couldn't be bothered, muttered, "
"Work come first, sleep comes last," she muttered as she straightened her skirt and tied up her hair.
Harry awoke to something warm and wet falling on his cheeks. When he looked up, it was to see Draco shedding tears, and his heart hurt so greatly, it was as though he had been shot straight through the chest.
"Alright, let's get you outta here before you throw up all over the place and incur the wrath of that very unhappy bartender."
It wasn't time for him to break for lunch, yet, so he resorted to pacing around the room just to keep himself occupied. He'd been feeling fidgety for a while, now, since he had already finished his quota of paperwork for the day and didn't have any pressing matters to deal with at the moment. He kept thinking about Malfoy and Antares and Camilla and Liz and the vase and the Blacks and the kids and pre-schools and how Ginny hadn't called him any time recently, and it was all driving him mad.
He didn't say anything more and seemed content with watching the quill moved across the parchment, reading what was written and making changes when needed.
"Well, I guess you're not the only one pulling an all-nighter," he said as he placed the mug on the desk. "Mrs Weasley's still here finishing up the past week's paperwork too—with Gonsales."
"Higher-ups giving you trouble?" Harry asked as he flipped through the memos Buxley had left on his desk.
Harry cleared his throat, feeling awkward, but before either of them could say anything, Harry's phone went off. He excused himself and moved to a corner of the room as he answered the phone, glad he had decided to take Ron's advice and cast Anti-Magical barriers on it.
His wrists and ankles were bound by chains reinforced by condensed magic, almost making Harry feel sick when they passed by him. The rags he wore were filthy, as was the rest of him, and he was more bone than flesh. He looked like some of the rescued victims of human trafficking Harry remembered seeing in a documentary years ago. They'd looked so pathetic and pitiful that death seemed like a better evil than forcing them to live.
Ramsey had risen to his feet at Harry's arrival, his eyes wide with excitement. He held a hand out. "Oh, my, Head Auror Potter! I didn't expect that you would come down here yourself!" When Harry crossed his arms and raised an unimpressed eyebrow, Ramsey redirected his stretched arm to motion to an empty armchair. "Please, I would love for you to be a part of this exclusive interview."
He woke up feeling disgruntled and shaken. He didn't really remember all that much about the nightmare, but the lingering emotions that he felt sent shivers down his spine.
he thought to himself as he looked around Malfoy's office. He realised he'd arrived unannounced, but their first session was scheduled for later that day anyway—he had just arrived a couple of hours earlier than he was supposed to—but he was still surprised to see the office empty. Wondering what to do, he made his way to the door and had just cracked it open when he heard voices from the corridor.
It's the day before Lestrange's release, and Harry seems to be hallucinating, due to which he finally decides to take the much-needed step to do something about his nightmares as soon as the release was over and done with. Meanwhile, Ginny is leaving home for work and the kids are upset to bid their mum goodbye.
"That's why I have you," Harry replied with a grin. "And tell your bosses that I'm taking care of the vase as we speak."
"Well, now that we've got the most pressing matters out of our way," Malfoy said in a professional tone of voice. "Why don't we get right to it?"
Draco shuddered, his legs growing weak, the air inside the bubble feeling sparse, and as his knees buckled, Harry caught him and eased him to the floor. He moved in front of Draco, his face too close, his emerald eyes shining with concern as he physically blocked the message from Draco's view.
She glanced down at herself and said, "Ah, yes. Draco decided that the traditional, lime-green Healer's robes were much too gaudy for this day and age and that a pristine white suited our profession much better."
She looked up at him, eyeing him expectantly, but Harry only held his hands up and shook his head. "In the end, everything you just said is mere conjecture. We can't know anything for certain until such time that my men find some clue as to what exactly happened to the blueprint."
"Harry," she sighed, giving him a pleading look. "Can we just forget about that? Didn't we have fun these past three days?"
He smirked, finding his mother’s reaction endearing. “Apologies, madam.” He rose to his feet and dusted his trousers. “So, when do I get to meet my mysterious match made in the Ministry of Magic?”
"Alright, you know what? Maybe I won't go after all," Harry said childishly, feeling the intense need to disappear into a hole. He knew Malfoy was only having a bit of fun, and he knew he was being childish, but he supposed he wasn't completely over the fact that the blond used to be a bully, and he really didn't fancy being humiliated by the man all over again. "I mean, I'm already troubling you enough with the vase, I really don't want to have to give him more last-minute work to do."
Audrey nodded, waiting as the waitress placed a cup of tea in front of her. "Yeah, I started at Silver Sprigs Pre-school recently, as I'm sure you know." She sipped on her tea. "They had quite a heavy staff turnover last quarter, and although they offered me quite a lump sum pay to begin with, I
Harry said, coming up to sit beside Draco. "There's one already sloshed girl and two boring book nerds."
Hermione came into the room just then and had to jump aside as the kids ran around, collecting all their toys and whatnot, stuffed it all into their rucksacks, and raced out the door.
Draco and Astoria exchanged looks, and from the way her lower lip trembled and her eyes glistened with tears, he knew she was a moment away from bursting into tears. "Let's file a missing persons report," he said gently, caressing her arm as she clung to him. "We'll find him, Astoria."
"Don't worry about it," he replied as he dipped his fingers in the bowl of Floo powder on the mantle. "I was working all weekend, anyway. And the kids are preoccupied with all their cousins' visits, so they're having the time of their lives."
that ridiculous thing. And Hugo even carries his car into the bath—the paint's already started chipping."
Harry ran his hands through his hair as the exhaustion finally settled over him. "That is literally the best news I have heard all week. Now all I need is a nice bath and my warm bed, and I couldn't ask for anything else."
Instead of getting mad like Ron had, Hermione said, "Oh, that's great! Do you feel better?" to which Ron said, "Hermione!" from behind him. "Oh, hush, Ronald," his wife replied. "Anyway, can you open up the Floo? The kids are
Harry hopped onto the counter too. Now that they were eye-level again, Draco was forced to look into his piercing emerald eyes. Harry smiled, and Draco promptly looked away.
But with all the things that had happened of late, the topic of finding another pre-school seemed to have skipped both his and his wife's minds. They had been under the impression that things would be fine and that they could put it off for just a little longer, until they were able to sort out the other parts of their life. Thinking about it now, Harry realised that both he and Ginny had taken advantage of Arthur and Molly's kindness and had never stopped to consider that they wouldn't be able to babysit the kids forever.
Harry nodded. "The sooner the better. I want her and her vase out of our hair before the DMLE starts asking questions."
He smiled, and Draco decided that marrying Harry Potter wouldn’t be the worst thing that happened to him.
"And that's when I realised," she said in a voiced choked with laughter, continuing her story like she had just stopped a moment ago, "that you were just like me. Except you had to put on a brave face and pretend like you could carry the weight of the world on your frail shoulders while I could stand in the shadows and pretend like my petty problems were greater than everything you had to bear."
He watched as the blonde's eyes went round once he introduced himself and hoped that she'd paid attention to whatever he'd said after that. "Of course," she squeaked, and then cleared her throat, seeming embarrassed. "Of course, sir. When would be a convenient time for you?"
He jerked awake, raking a hand through his hair and finding it wet with sweat. He sat up, disoriented and confused. It took him a moment to find his wand and another moment to Summon his glasses. He placed them on the bridge of his nose and scanned the living room.
Malfoy smiled. "Well, now that a little more colour has returned to your face, do you mind me asking what exactly happened, earlier this morning?"
He looked up at the sound of the shopkeeper's bell, breaking into his usual, ready-to-serve smile as a pretty lady walked towards him. "Hi, welcome to
Ron grinned, and Harry shook his head, a sense of awe settling over him. He'd missed this. The way Ron was able to give clarity to things that Harry would complicate for no reason through his simplistic ways of thinking. That was one of Ron's greatest gifts. It had saved both Harry and Hermione countless times before and would, countless times more, Harry was sure.
Ginny reached towards Draco, puckering her lips, and Harry placed his palm against her mouth before pushing her back. "Easy there, tiger. What, are you already wasted? Nobody's even here yet!"
She groaned and buried her head in her knees. "Harry, please don't let's ruin this by talking about a stupid mistake that I made. OK?"
Rose and Hugo ran in just then, screaming at the top of their lungs. Albus and James joined in a moment later, and the four kids jumped around the living room, trying to out-shout the other. Lily stirred in Harry's arms with a little whimper, and he instantly pulled his wand out and cast a Silencing Charm on the fearsome foursome. They paused in their bouncing around to stare at him wide-eyed. He simply pressed a finger to his lips and motioned to his daughter, and James, deciding to be the responsible older brother, gestured for the other kids to follow him as he led them up the stairs. Harry undid the Silencing Charm before they disappeared out of sight, and turned to his best mate with a look of pity.
Audrey looked thoughtful as she said, "Well, in ordinary circumstances, we wouldn't really allow it, but considering this crowd we cater to here, there may be exceptions to the rule. Since I only recently joined, I'm not entirely sure. Maybe you could talk to the manager and see what she says?"
"You better decide how you're going to deal with your… situation, and you better do it fast. I can keep it a secret from Ron for as long as possible, but you live with Ginny, and she's much smarter than you give her credit for. You of all people should know that," Hermione scolded in a hurried whisper.
The kids stared up at him wide-eyed, Albus forgetting about his hand in his curiosity, and Harry couldn't help but smile.
He caught Malfoy nodding from the corner of his eye and somehow that placated him. Taking a deep breath, he continued.
Draco grabbed her and pulled her to the side, looking around to ensure they weren't in the Aurors' way before turning back to his hysterical ex-wife. "Astoria, I have been here, staring at these horrible messages all night trying to see if I can think of something useful that could help us find Scorpius. I know I didn't do my job as his father, I know I didn't keep him safe, and I'm sorry I broke my promise to you, but I'm doing everything in my power to find him, and I can't have you here right now."
"Boys, not now," Harry said as he picked Albus up and put him down, much to the younger boy's dismay and his brother's delight. Although Harry was glad to see his sons, he really didn't have the energy to deal with their enthusiasm. "Where's your sister?" he asked them, but just then Ron climbed down the stairs with Lily in his arms.
Harry nodded, the last bit of what Hermione said sparking a forgotten memory. "Yeah, yeah, I'm quite sure that's why I found the name familiar. I briefly remember meeting someone with the same surname when I was on one of those relief missions after the war."
"Right, then." Harry moved to the door. "Thanks, Kingsley," he said just before the man stepped out.
Harry stepped back and waited as the receptionist fumbled in the cupboard beneath the desk. He was surprised when she pulled out a device that looked almost identical to a Muggle telephone but was definitely magical, because of the way it distorted the space around it in the slightest. Intrigued, he watched as she dialled a number on it and pressed it to her ear.
Albus stuck his bottom lip out and crossed his arms, sulking. Harry hid a smile as Lily turned in a slow circle, apparently looking for her grandma.
Draco found himself smiling, belatedly realising he hadn't felt this relaxed with someone in a very long time. They talked and talked for ages, and when Draco finally fell asleep, it was a fulfilling night's rest.
Harry sat back and closed his eyes, breathing in and letting the lingering scent of the salty air and the sound of the ocean calm him.
"Yes, please." Harry cleared his throat again and sat up straight, watching as Malfoy pulled out his wand—which instantly brought back unpleasant memories for Harry—and mumbled a quiet
"Come on, Draco," Pansy says, gesturing to the large, wooden signboard hanging behind me. "A flower shop called
“Ah, fuck,” he swore, dusting his worn jeans and straightening his loose T-shirt. His parents hated how he had started dressing since he had left St Mungo’s, several months after the war. He had left in one piece, but the patchwork that was his skin was a constant reminder that he would never be the person he was before the werewolf attack. Considering all he had lost in that one year, he didn’t see the necessity of dressing all posh and pretending to be the rich heir of a (mis)fortune that he was supposed to be.
"I loathed you and found it completely unfair that you got to survive time and again when so many innocent people had died. That you walked to your death and came out alive when hundreds of others never had that choice. That you could stand there, looking like a martyr, when I could still feel the warmth of my brother's blood on my hands. And I could only think of one thing: why you? What made you so special? Why did you get to escape death so many times? You, an ordinary boy with no extraordinary talent or powers, who was standing there and promising a world with no war as though you were our messiah
"Sounds great. Thanks again," Harry said as he held a hand out. "And I'm sorry for keeping you from your family."
They watched Ginny wrap her arms around Harry's neck and swing around him, and then looked back at each other. "So glad," Hermione said seriously, and Draco couldn't help but laugh.
Harry nodded. "Yeah," he said after he swallowed. "I want her there when we uncover worthwhile information. I'm still on the fence about whether or not she's a complete liar or just hiding certain information."
Arthur grumbled, and Harry chuckled as he sipped his coffee, enjoying the usual banter between the two.
Buxley simply raised his eyebrows and the papers he was holding, and said, "Here's to hoping you don't need it."
He was already stressed out about the whole phone call from Angelina, and the phone call Ginny had just gotten, and the way he felt like their relationship was falling apart—not to mention that he now had to deal with his three kids on his own and had his nightmares and insomnia as an added bonus. He loved Hermione, and she was a fantastic mother, but she wasn't Ginny. It wasn't a family trip without Ginny.
"Just what I needed," Harry muttered as he took a long swig of the hot tea, revelling in the instant feeling of peace and calm from the Calming Draught mixed in that settled over him. He sighed, letting his eyes slip shut as he finished off the rest of the tea in silence, and Malfoy waited until he was done and had replaced the cup on its saucer to speak.
how can I help you?" Draco said, ignoring Harry and directing his attention to the couple that had walked in. Harry waved and exited the shop, and Draco couldn't help but watch him until he couldn't see the other man anymore.
"Buxley, you've given me far more than I expected in just three days. Now that we know that the vase is legitimate, we can further our investigation," Harry said with a reassuring smile.
"Mummy! Daddy!" came a high pitched squeal simultaneously as three-year-old Lily, who looked like a wrapped toffee in Ginny's old pink apron and hairnet, came running into the room.
"Well, if you're only trying to find some stolen vase, I don't see what the big deal is. Other than that it isn't really your job to find stolen stuff for people. The Ministry has a separate department for that, you know."
needed you to take the week off. Your constant jittering and overcompensating were driving the whole department mad."
In-between the stairs and the pharmacy was a long hallway that led further into the building. There were several doors, doorways and smaller corridors that led away from the main corridor, and there was always someone walking to and fro, either doctors or patients or staff members. Harry inhaled deeply and was surprised that, instead of the pungent smell of antiseptic that he associated with hospitals, he smelled a mild, soothing scent of flowers and freshly mown grass.
"I'd love to," I say, swayed by the delicious smells coming from the basket, hoping he can't hear the ravenous rumbles my stomach is making. "Do you have to be somewhere else later?"
"Yeah, she's in a meeting-interview with the top execs right now. Actually," Harry said, checking his watch, "she might be done."
The memory brought a smile to his face, but it also brought with it the thought that he was there, with the kids, but Ginny, whose idea it had been to come to the beach in the first place, was nowhere to be seen. He controlled his urge to sigh as he quickly dispelled the depressing thoughts that followed. They were there to have fun, with or without Ginny, and that was what he was going to do even if he had to force himself to do it.
Seeing stars, he sighed and fell back, placing an arm over his eyes and wallowing in his epic failure. When he tried to move, his other arm was assaulted by a shock of numbness, and he was on pins and needles, grimacing at the odd sensation in his limbs as he waited for the feeling to pass.
Harry shrugged, relaxing now that he knew there wouldn't be any chance of funny business so far. "Not really."
"I'm afraid to say that you wasted your time, coming all the way here, Minister," he said quietly, and Kingsley seemed to expand.
The blond tilted his head in the slightest and seemed to be scrutinising Harry with wide, curious eyes. Under his piercing gaze, Harry felt like a fascinating new pet added to Malfoy's collection that the man couldn't get enough of.
He wound through back alleys and parking lots until he spotted a bald man up ahead. "Don't move!" he shouted, and the perp froze, hesitating only until the sound of squealing tyres alerted them of the others' arrival.
Scratching his chin, he followed a mother and son through the sliding glass doors while wondering if he was in the right place. He paused at the entrance and looked around, trying to see if he could spot someone who could help him.
Ginny rolled eyes and crossed her arms. "George probably sent that bloody bird off to some obscure location to procure illegal ingredients, no doubt."
“Harry Potter,” Draco’s supposed nemesis said in introduction—as though Draco needed one— his smile growing. “I’m frankly relieved that you agreed to meet me.”
Harry picked up the vase, and they made their way down the hall and off towards one of the tunnels that led down to the tracks. They passed by a tall, lanky, tired-looking wizard who was following a goblin down a different tunnel as they exited the main hall. The man tipped his hat at Harry, and the latter nodded back with a smile.
"Ugh, Gross," Ginny said, and he pictured her scrunching up her nose, making him chuckle. "I'm sorry I couldn't come home over the weekend," she continued. "Things've been pretty hectic here."
Just as he was about to walk to the coffee machine to make himself a mug of strong, black coffee, a memo fluttered in through the open fanlight above the closed door. He caught it before it sailed past him and unfolded it carefully. Harry stared at Buxley's familiar scrawl for a moment before reading the memo. It contained very brief bullet points about various things starting from the latest news of the on-going investigation, to the confirmation of Lisanna Barkridge's identity and the story of the lost vase, to the submission of paperwork to the DMLE and them insisting that Harry attend the customary meeting of the heads of departments on Friday, to the latest report on the vandalism case Buxley was overseeing, and finally, to the most important thing: that he had no more work to do and could head home for the day.
In order to match his alias, Harry had taken the opportunity to practice his spell-casting skills for the occasion. He had used glamour to turn his hair a dull, mousy shade of brown with wisps of grey in it, added wrinkles and freckles to his face, covered his scar, and changed his eye colour to a light hazel. He'd chosen to wear a rather tattered-looking trench coat that was a size too large over a pistachio-green shirt, grey pants, and suspenders to complete his disguise.
He sighed, deciding that he may as well finish off what little bit of paperwork he had left since he wasn't about to get any sleep that night anyway.
"Take care of yourself," Harry said to Ginny, and she smiled up at him. Except… it felt like they were saying goodbye—for good.
Harry sighed and stood, giving into their cuteness. "Alright, fine. But only for an hour. Am I clear?"
She nodded, looking happy, and then motioned towards the books. "Well, I still have a mountain of work waiting for me, but if you want to read up on the Barkridges, I took the effort of marking the pages that contained information about them for you."
"I'm not sixty yet," Buxley grumbled, but Harry knew that the other man knew he had to accept defeat.
Draco's smile was wan and he refused to meet Harry's eyes. "You seem to have forgotten his final words. As soon as I sire a daughter, this realm will no longer have any need for me. Either my magic shall survive only as long as I need to find a mate and sire an offspring, or the residents of this world shall find me, after which I shall, really and truly, disappear."
His eyes widen and he sniffs himself. "Sorry, it must be all the alcohol—I didn't know I had bad body odour."
Whenever Ginny had been away in the past, it always followed the same pattern: their conversations would start off with her sounding excited, then they would talk about the most recent happenings on their respective ends, then it would dwindle down to a bunch of awkward pauses while each shuffled around, doing different things, and they would either continue the conversation half-heartedly, or one of them would say they had to go.
He nodded and walked towards the house, running a hand through his short hair. It was so much easier to handle with it short, and he always wondered why he never bothered doing it before.
Sighing, Harry pulled out the last bit of the day's paperwork he had left. He decided that he may as well make use of the time he had than just sit around and mope. That way, he'd be able to go home to Ginny and the kids and spend the evening with them before she left.
Harry grabbed it first and placed it on the ground beside his feet. "Everyone knows Rabastan Lestrange was far less dangerous than his brother—especially after those first fourteen years."
"Why, though?" Harry asked. He could wager a guess that it had to do with Malfoy regretting his poor choices before and during the war, but could someone really change the core aspects of their personality?
Kingsley began to say something, but Hermione bustled over just then. She flipped through the files in her arms, handing over two to Harry and Kingsley, and finally looked from one man to the other.
Disconcerted, he quickly made a call to Camilla's personal number—which he had gained as a result of their long chat the previous evening. It went to voicemail, and he disconnected the call. He looked around, unsure of what exactly he wanted to do, when the gnawing feeling in his stomach started to prickle. Groaning, he wondered if he'd eaten too much and decided to drink a digestive potion just in case, but a jolt of pain shot through him, and he clutched the counter, breathing in deeply as he tried to relax his tense muscles.
Screaming, he tugged at his hair, unable to bear the sight of those lifeless eyes and the sound of the shrill laughter. He should have died. That monster should have killed him.
After they had thanked Draco and Astoria and were reunited with their family, Draco turned to his son.
"That's right! Gives you the illusion of having all the energy in the world, it does! And then I'll be the one to lug your sorry arse inside when you're huffing and puffing and wheezing your poor lungs out," Molly complained as she bustled about.
After a time, while they lay in bed, listening to the sounds of the night, Draco murmured, “You never did tell me why you chose me.” When Harry began to mutter in protest, he added, “Why you really chose me.”
Once all of his men were piled into the black, Muggle van, whose interiors were magically expanded to fit them all in, Harry opened the passenger door and helped Lisa in. He climbed in after her and shared a look with Buxley, who was driving, and they set off.
"Good." Harry watched Neville, waiting, knowing that there was something else the other man wanted to say.
Sensing the beginning of another row, Harry tried to excuse himself without drawing too much attention. Unfortunately for him, Ron had other plans.
"'Mione, time to get back to work." He shook her awake gently, and she sighed, opening her eyes and nodding.
had some well-deserved fun." She placed a pair of dark sunglasses on her nose. "Now, will you drink that and enjoy yourself or keep moping around for the rest of the trip?"
"Or maybe not the whole week," he said quickly, not wanting to ruin the homely mood they had just created. "At least a few days after the kids get back—"
done that before, not even during the times Ginny had been away on her reporting gigs when the kids were younger. She'd come and help, but never substitute for Ginny.
Hermione came to stand beside Harry and placed a hand on his shoulder, gently massaging it. He leant into the touch, focusing all his senses on her warm palm, and tried to ignore the cold that clung to him.
Dyers held his hands up, looking satisfied. "As long as it's out of here and out of my hair, I don't care what you do with it. Everyone just wants this to be over and done with, and tied up in a nice, big bow."
Ron shrugged. "You don't have to enrol your kids there. Just talk to Audrey. I'm sure she can help."
"Still looking for an assistant professor?" Harry joked as they watched Robards tell off a group of his own men for laughing.
The blond was lying in the centre of the clearing, curled up like a foetus, his clothes ripped and shredded. The rings of his spine pressed against his pale flesh, the stitched up skin pulled taut. His feet and hands were scratched and bloody, and he was moaning into his chest, shuddering every now and then.
She smiled, a genuine, teary smile, and said, "I suppose I just wanted to thank you. I suppose that's what made it so easy for my parents and brothers to follow after you without even the slightest inkling of a doubt."
Harry looked up and grinned as Buxley poked his head into the office. "Yes, Buxley, there's something I need you to do."
Draco laughed, ruffling his son's hair, and Harry moved away, deciding to give the family some privacy while he wrapped things up.
Harry groaned as he patted George on the back and pulled away, nodding and adjusting his glasses. "Yeah, rough start."
Stunned, Harry turned in a slow circle, drinking in the mothers reading Witch Weekly and the children playing with hovering plush toys; the same waterfall contraption in the corner of the room now had birds fluttering around, tittering in pleasant tones, and the water changed into different fresh, fruit juices every few minutes; the pharmacy was full of hovering bottles and jars and vials and witches and wizards yelling every time one of them knocked into them; it was chaos. But it was familiar chaos, and Harry instantly felt himself relax.
Albus was the first to notice him. "Daddy!" He ran up to him and tugged on his hand excitedly. "We made a friend! This is Danny!"
There were collective groans as everyone trudged back to their respective cubicles, and Harry turned to Hermione. "How much trouble am I in?"
"I may have gone overboard," he says, sheepish. "But I find cooking and baking to be very de-stressing, and after...you know...I've just been making way too much food so I thought I may as well share."
He hadn't really planned on it, but he was glad that his day-off was turning out to be more productive than he had expected. Like Buxley had said, he wanted to get stuff over with as and when he could, and not push them off for later, because, knowing his profession, tomorrow would never come. He either got things done every free moment he had, or they would just pile on until they cascaded down on him and crushed him under their weight (something he had come to learn from experience).
He didn't understand it. Ginny had left home for work before—for weeks, sometimes—and although the kids missed her and asked for her, they usually never seemed all that upset by it. So he didn't understand why it was that Ginny leaving this time was making Lily cry so much.
Harry didn't respond for so long that Draco didn't expect to receive an answer. Then, with a sigh, the other man said, "It's a long story."
The line went silent as Angelina waited for a reply—which he didn't give because he was rooted to the spot, his mouth hanging open.
Harry shrugged. "You said you and I are connected in some way. Maybe my magic will be enough to keep the two of us alive. I mean, I never even knew I had any to begin with, so you can have all of mine, for all I care."
Ginny hummed and stepped forwards, peering at the letter, but Harry had already wiped it clean with his wand and picked up the quill as it fluttered down on to the counter.
"Where did they even get those? Wait—don't tell me—Arthur?" Hermione asked, a knowing expression on her face.
I sigh and decide that having him crash at my place for one night is the lesser evil when compared to having to spend another hour convincing him to go home again.
He heard his colleagues cheer as he pulled the door shut and smiled to himself. Thank Merlin for small mercies.
He felt a surge of emotion and gulped a little more Firewhiskey before nodding. "Yeah, alright, I'll see what I can do." Neville stared at him, a dumbfounded expression on his face, and Harry smirked. "But, on the condition that I babysit you—me and a whole
It took him a while to manage to read what was written, and when he did, it made him roll his eyes. He couldn't make out a lot of the words because they were too small and were half gone because of how close to the edge they'd been written. It said something along the lines of a life debt having to be repaid and ended with best wishes, probably, but a lot of the sentence wasn't legible, so he couldn't be sure. It sounded just like Malfoy—holding onto a life debt or something of the like even though they'd reached the point where such things were so trivial in comparison to everything else.
Harry always insisted Draco come with him when he hung out with his friends, and considering Draco had distanced himself from his handful of friends years ago, he was grateful for Harry's persistence. Draco and Hermione, although they had started off on a rough patch, had ended up as fast friends when they had realised they shared very similar interests. Sometimes, Draco even liked to entertain the idea of himself dating Hermione if he wasn't head over heels for Harry.
He walked over to the counter and perched on the seat, placing his arms on the tabletop and leaning forward with a sigh. His eyes slipped half-shut as he watched Ginny pour the tea into a rather large mug and place it in front of him.
She burst into tears, and he held her close as she cried, her body shuddering from the force of her sobs, feeling his own eyes tear up. He swallowed thickly and closed his eyes, letting the tears flow and giving himself a moment to mourn over the fact that it had been two days since his son had gone missing and they were no closer to finding him than they had been on day one.
They stayed like that for a long time, simply revelling in the warmth and company of each other, and, for once, Harry felt at peace. He felt as though he could finally get past his nightmares, as if he could finally let them go and move on. He wanted that peace to last for a long, long time, but just as the thought crossed his mind, there was a sharp rap on the door.
"I see you're helping yourself," he said as he snatched the letter from the table before Pig could reach it, and the owl snapped its beak at him. Pig stared at him for a moment longer before turning back to the snacks. Harry snorted as he opened the envelope and pulled out the crisp, neatly folded sheet of parchment.
There was something about the man's story that was very familiar… as though he had heard it all before. But he just couldn't put his finger to it.
The blond caught him looking and eyed him with a curious expression. "Have I got something on my face?"
"Molly's offered to look after them. Fleur's visiting with Dominique and little Louis, so they said it would be nice for the kids to spend some time with them."
The other wizard's expression shifted to a more mellow one, even bringing out that mild smile of his that had stunned Harry the first time around. "Well, that… is an interesting thought, no doubt," Malfoy said, and Harry could've sworn he could hear the wry laughter in the man's voice if it weren't for his calm expression. "But why don't we focus on
"Why you're being slow on the uptake." Buxley glanced sideways and hollered for one of his men. When the fellow arrived, he said, "Mason, go 'round the corner and buy one of those large, Muggle cheeseburgers. Here, take this."
"Yeah, she is. She's leaving today, actually. I'm hoping I can get back early to see her off." Harry nodded to Buxley as they left the office, and the man shot Neville a look before nodding back.
Malfoy nodded slowly, a thoughtful expression on his face, as though he was trying to decipher some hidden meaning in Harry's words, and said, "Camilla only comes in when she has work. Otherwise, she meets with her clients outside, as I assume she has done with you in your previous meetings."
The glass filled with water, and Malfoy Levitated it to Harry, who grabbed it out of the air a little too quickly and spilled some on the light carpet. Clearing his throat for the third time, he stared at the swirling water, refusing to look up at Malfoy lest he noticed the faint tinge of red in Harry's cheeks or the tips of his ears.
"Oh, no, please call me Lisanna. Liz or Lisa are fine as well, sir." She waved her hands, looking like she would break out in tears if he didn't do as requested.
From the sounds of it, there were four men—four lesser than there were supposed to be—and they were having a heated argument, the contents of which he couldn't decipher due to his poor linguistic expertise, but he presumed it had something to do with the missing men. He pressed closer, attempting to catch a glimpse of the perpetrators, when his radio went off.
He shook his head with a sigh. "Didn't have a choice in the matter. And I swear I had no idea how much more there was to it when I accepted the case."
I exhale a ragged breath, winded by this moment of existential realisation, and attempt to calm my racing heart.
Once he had awoken, Mr Hussain had ushered him into the adjoining bathroom where he underwent something called "steam therapy", which was basically him sitting in a sauna-like room. When he had stepped out after a hot bath and changed back into his clothes, he had never felt so relaxed and refreshed ever before.
"Neither did I. But I have to say—being the Deputy Auror, I would've expected the service here to be better, ya know? Better looking nurses at least, for Morgana's sake."
Potter sighed. “I was sent a marriage notice by the Ministry three years ago with a list of prospective suitors. None of them really held my fancy, and I was still seeing Ginny back then. When she joined the Harpies, we had a long discussion about various things, a lot of it mostly involving my “celebrity status”, as you so nicely put it, and we decided that the logical course of action would be to break up.” He shrugged. “She’s still touring the world with her team and seems to have found someone, and I still refused to pick from the list given to me. Someone from the Ministry who was apparently a fan of mine or something said that she could maybe pull some strings and find me an alternative list of names, and I initially refused, but after seeing your name, I decided to accept it.”
"Don't say controversial things and just pretend like you never said them," Harry sighed as he entered the Auror office and tried to greet everyone as cheerfully as possible.
When she placed her hands on the counter behind which he stood, his eyes were drawn to her wrist, where a small mockingbird peeked out from under her sleeve, and his heart clenched involuntarily. His expression must've given away his momentary pain because her face fell. "It isn't possible, is it? Oh, this is what I get for leaving everything until the very last minute."
The action was so gentle, but some unknown force sent Harry plummeting backwards, and he was free-falling through darkness, the image of Draco's stormy eyes burned into his mind.
Harry nodded. He began to ask another question, when an Auror came bursting in. "Sir," he said, eyes wide. "We found a location."
Draco brought over the tea and placed a mug in front of Harry before taking the seat opposite him. They sipped their tea in silence, and Harry looked everywhere but at the blond, who was studying him.
Malfoy smiled. "Three o'clock sounds perfect. I hope your surprise trip to see your wife goes well."
The blond poked Harry's forehead, where a lightning bolt-shaped mark was engraved into his skin. "This, this. Your tattoo."
"Two years later, the organisation became official under the name Antares, but continued to keep its status as a semi-secret, private organisation as the witches and wizards who consulted with us preferred it to be that way. Now, we are an international organisation that continues to help magical folk like you while keeping our existence, as well as your needs, under wraps."
Hermione gave him an incredulous look, as though she simply didn't see the logic behind his reasoning. "That makes no sense, Ron! We don't
He had barely stepped out of the fireplace when two little figures barrelled into him, clinging on to his legs. Laughing, he supported his sons as they began to climb up his sides—something they did every single time they saw him after a rather long period of time.
Groaning, Harry looked at the clock on his desk and thought back to the promise he had made Ginny the previous evening. Not only had he not called her last night, he hadn't even had a chance to leave her a message because of how caught up he had been. He'd even ended up spending another night on the sofa in his office, and his lack of sleep, plus the addition of a backache, was just adding to his long list of problems.
Harry straightened up, took a deep breath, and shuddered. The two Aurors shifted, watching him with measured expressions. He pulled off the goggles, handed it over to Hughes, cleared his throat, and said, "Take it down to Headquarters. See if Romney can pull prints off of it."
Harry swore under his breath and, after casting Bubble-Head Charms on the both of them, pulled down the shield. He swirled his wand, creating a vacuum, and the gas was sucked in fairly quickly. Instead of making it disappear, however, he Transfigured a nearby notepad into a vial and channeled some of the smoke into it, sealing it shut before pocketing it.
He deposited Albus—blankets and all—outside the door, and, while the five-year-old tried to extricate himself from the bundle, trudged into the bathroom. He was quick with his morning routine, as usual, and stepped under the showerhead, groaning as the hot water burned his skin.
Harry looked at Draco and then at the wand he was holding, and it took Draco several seconds to realise that he was the one who had stunned Macnair.
"Those idiots," Harry said, starting to pull the magical barrier down and step out, when the far wall pulsated, sparks flying.
"I love you," she whispered. He wrapped his arms around her and pulled her against him, momentarily forgetting that he was supposed to be mad at her.
Harry sat up and rubbed his face, feeling cold and empty. This nightmare hadn't had the same impact as the most recent ones, but none of them had left him feeling as emotionally, physically and mentally drained as this one. He felt as if his very life was slowly seeping out of him. He could feel the familiar tug of hunger in his stomach; it reminded him of not having enough food, and it took him all of his willpower to keep from being sick.
He should have anticipated that people would still treat them differently, even if it was because they didn't want to get into trouble with The Chosen One over something as simple as one of the kids getting injured while playing or going back home to complain that one of the other kids was mean to them or that they didn't enjoy going to school.
Harry turned to eye him with a frown, and his disgust must have shown on his face because Draco chuckled and shook his head. "He's good for her. Being a world-renowned historian himself, their careers blend together perfectly; they were traveling together to conferences even before Astoria and I separated."
He arranged the pictures in a neat pile and the objects from the pouch in three rows. Making sure not to touch any of them, his heart thrumming with anticipation, he took a moment to close his eyes and take a deep breath before he started.
"That's good." For a moment, he thought she'd ask him more, but, to his surprise, she didn't. Instead, she asked, "Have you been to see the kids, yet?"
"I just assumed… since you're here," Harry said awkwardly when she continued to look at him. "You didn't have to come, you know; I'd have been fine on my own."
He had been present at the launching of one of the very first cross-tech devices over three years ago, but few people had supported the venture due to the sheer expense that went into research and experimentation. Most wizarding folk had been sceptical of the devices, but soon after the prototypes were launched, several patrons from across the world had decided to fund the venture. A little over a year ago, they were said to have sold over five hundred of these devices worldwide. Harry had never seen a fully functional one, so he was quite intrigued by it.
Buxley sighed long and slow, and let his eyes slip shut. His breathing evened out, and Harry almost thought he'd fallen asleep 'til he cracked his eyes open and focused them on Harry.
"Thank you again for being patient with me, sir. I shall be back soon." She turned to Buxley and smiled as she rose from her seat. "May I call you Deputy Buxley, sir?"
Draco sat back slowly, nodding, looking somewhat placated. "That's right," he said, as though to himself, "I'm not guilty."
After that, Harry came over to him, looking conflicted. He pulled down the shield long enough to step through it before putting it back up. "We've found that a powerful Disillusionment Charm has been used on some areas of the room," he said. "And considering they're all large, flat surfaces, we think the perp may have left messages."
"Yeah. It was actually stolen—and this is confidential. I'm only telling you because you said nothing would leave this room." Once Malfoy nodded, he continued, "Well, it was stolen from Grimmauld Place, which was once the home of the late Walburga and Orion Black."
"Good evening, Mister Buxley," she greeted in a singsong voice and then turned to Harry. "I really appreciate all of your help, sir."
"Looks like it's straight into the bath for the whole lot of you as soon as we get home," Ginny said as she sat down beside Harry, pulling her own plate close to her.
He frowned and shook his head. "Ginny, it's nearly four in the morning. What the hell are you doing?"
I think to myself, unsurprised by his choice of flowers as I pluck a slip of paper from a notepad and slide it across the counter to him.
We—my parents and I—betrayed the Dark Lord. If you hadn't killed him, we would've died for the betrayal."
As the two stood looking around the room, a mousy-looking man that Draco recognised from one of Astoria's previous conventions scampered up to them, practically bent over in half as he shook their hands.
"Is she asleep?" Ginny asked, and Harry nodded. She walked up to the sofa and gently stroked Lily's hair. "She finally stopped crying."
"Alright, alright, I understand," Harry said quickly, motioning for her to sit down. "I'll help you, but I need you to tell me
When there was no response, Draco turned to see a somewhat forlorn expression on the brunet's face. "What's wrong?" he asked, despite himself.
"Ah, she's out of town, actually. But I reckon I could send her a letter on your behalf. She should be back by the weekend."
Malfoy glanced towards the quill and it picked up its pace as it zoomed back and forth across the parchment. He then flicked his wand as he asked, "Can you tell me the area of their origin?"
His stomach growled again, and he sat up a little too fast, causing his head to spin, and a spell of sickness swept over him. Swallowing thickly, he slid off the narrow bed, placed his glasses on the bridge of his nose, and stared at the oddly familiar bookshelf in front of him.
Harry stepped back, arms spread out on either side, and said, "I kept thinking I knew Hertzfeld from somewhere because something about him seemed so familiar. But every time I thought about that family photograph, I came to the same conclusion: I'd never seen the man before in my life." He began to pace up and down in his excitement, and Buxley's eyes followed after him. "And then it hit me! The reason I thought I knew him was because he reminded me so much of someone
Harry looked up and waved Buxley in, pointing at the most recent pile of paperwork he'd just finished looking over. "Those are for you."
Harry woke up gasping for breath and drenched in sweat. Groaning, he slammed a fist on the bed and draped his other arm over his eyes. He'd downed a whole vial of Potion for Dreamless Sleep and he'd
Harry snorted as Neville went red in the face. "Still think teaching a bunch of brats is worse?" Harry whispered, and Neville shot him a look.
"Lee said the location was untraceable, but there're only so many places in the UK with wards powerful enough to make them difficult to trace."
Work stress has everyone on edge, causing them to get on each other's nerves, but a rough start for Harry ends with a reasonably good finish as Hermione and he work overtime at the Ministry.
Malfoy addressing him snapped him back to his senses, and he inhaled deeply, trying to calm himself. Silver eyes shimmered with a knowing expression, and Malfoy said, "This is why I said—look, we can still find you another Healer. I'll even see if I can schedule short meetings with a handful of them—"
Draco stopped just then, and Hermione turned to look over her shoulder. She swiped her sleeve across her face and shot him a small smile, sniffling as she stopped crying, but her dark eyes still looked immensely sad in the blue light of her wand.
"I heard you cremated him," Hermione whispered softly so only he would hear, and Harry nodded, sighing.
The familiar voice washed over him like a cool, soothing wave, and he turned slowly on the spot, his hammering heart racing in his chest. His mind was already on overdrive, so the sight of wide, stunned silver eyes and pale, slicked-back platinum locks did nothing to placate him in his frazzled state. He opened his mouth, intending to say something, but no words made it past his lips, leaving him standing there slack-jawed and looking utterly foolish.
"I was just sitting down for lunch," she said, and he could hear the chatter of people from the other end of the line.
Granger regarded him for a moment before shrugging. "We would've gotten along just fine even before now if you hadn't been such a complete git."
"I'd forgotten how sharp you are, Mr Sandford. We use custom-made air purifiers, here. It has a soothing effect on the patients and helps them calm down before they meet with their Healers. We have them sit in the lounge for a good ten minutes before we call on them."
Ramsey spluttered, having the gall to look betrayed as two Aurors came to escort him out. "Be sure to confiscate everything he has and take him to the Auror Office for questioning," Harry instructed.
The corners of Neville's eyes crinkled as he smiled and nodded, pulling Harry into a rough hug. "Yeah, thanks mate."
Harry swallowed thickly, his heart hammering a rhythm in his chest. Malfoy was so close that he could smell the cologne the man was wearing. It was a mild scent that reminded Harry of pine trees in the winter, and he had to admit that it was a very pleasing fragrance.
would someone who seemed to think something was an excellent idea suddenly back out? And why would she go through the extra measure of asking Hermione to
When she didn't continue even after a long pause, he shifted in his seat and asked, "What did she say?"
to sit tight. The medicines Molly gave him makes him drowsy, but he just—won't—stay—still. Ron's out there right now trying to tire him out."
"If it isn't too inconvenient," Harry replied as he grabbed a fistful of the shimmering, green powder and ducked under the mantle. "Thanks again."
"No, they were, but we had to pull them out for various reasons." Harry shrugged a shoulder. "So their grandparents look after them for now, while my wife and I go to work, but they can't babysit them forever."
They settled back in their seats, sipping their tea in silence as they listened to their kids' joyous shrieks coming from upstairs.
Harry glanced around, looking for Malfoy's roll of parchment and Self-Inking Quill, and as though reading his mind, the blond said, "My way of doing things is a little different from the others. Everything that transpires in this room will remain between us only. I'll be taking a few notes for my records, but beyond that, our conversations or the tests and tasks that I give you—"
"Er, sorry for barging in so suddenly," he said when Malfoy came up and sat on the armchair opposite him. "But I didn't expect—" he broke off, gesturing towards Malfoy and the rest of the room.
"Camilla," Malfoy said, his voice low. "A word?" He shot Harry a quick smile. "I apologise for this; we won't be a minute."
"Coming, coming," Hermione said, bustling away. She pecked her husband on the cheek on the way out, leaving Harry and Ron to look at each other awkwardly.
"So basically you're telling me not to let the higher ups in the DMLE know that you concocted an outrageous plan so that I could be placed as head of the security detail and you could prove that you were better than them?" Harry asked, the disbelief clear in his voice.
Harry gritted his teeth, and they both continued to stare each other down. The heavy silence that enveloped the Auror Office was intolerable. A moment later, he caught sight of a flash of brown curls attempting to nudge its way through, and he inhaled deeply, allowing himself to smile. Padma seemed confused by his sudden change in demeanour, but before either of them could so much as bat an eyelid, Hermione's familiar voice filtered through the wall of Germans obstructing the entrance.
All his nightmares up until then had been about the war and death and helplessness and guilt. Nothing about what he had gone through as a child. So what had triggered this?
He was going to lose sleep thinking about what to do with the vase, he had no doubt. His initial plan was to put it back, but he didn't want it to get stolen again. The German Ministry had refused to divulge any information as to why the perpetrators had been after the vase or why they had murdered people for it. No matter how much they apologised for the trouble caused, they were very tight-lipped over the matter, and the DMLE had given up rather easily, saying it wasn't their problem anymore. They just wanted Harry to get the vase out of the Ministry so they could tie the whole thing up in a nice, big bow.
"Yeah, yeah," Draco said, rising to his feet again. "I need to finish an essay, so I can't waste any more time with the likes of you."
"I walked today," he says, taking a seat by the counter and letting out an awfully depressing sigh. "Do you mind if I hang out here for a bit? I closed the bakery early because I wasn't feeling too well but realised I couldn't go home since my girlf—since my
"Well, er…" he seemed to be struggling with whatever he was trying to say, his awkward demeanor around Draco persisting from the previous day.
She winced at the sharpness of his tone, but he didn't feel guilty about it. He finished the rest of his mug and poured himself more Firewhiskey.
"Sure you're alright with me leaving them here for an hour or two?" he muttered to Ron as the latter came up to him.
Despite the fact that Harry hardly slept that night, he woke up feeling determined and ready to take on the world. He had spent most of the previous evening poring over evidence and details of the previous disappearances, seeing if he could piece any information together, and had fallen asleep on the sofa in his office again, but, despite not finding anything substantial, his determination was undeterred.
Buxley grinned and did a mock bow. Harry laughed as he made his way to his office, greeting the Aurors he passed on his way. The day seemed to be going well so far, despite the nightmare he had awoken to, and he intended to keep it that way, irrespective of how his meeting with Camilla and Malfoy turned out.
"Mr Potter." Malfoy rose from his seat behind his desk and motioned towards the sofas in front of it, where they had sat the first time Harry had entered the office. "I'm glad you could take some time off so soon. I wasn't expecting to hear from you until later in the week. Tea?" he asked, as a tray floated over to where they were seated.
As surprised silver eyes looked up to meet his own emerald ones, he went through the process of putting on the act of someone who was embarrassed and awkward at having walked in on a sensitive situation and said, "Er, my bad. I'll uh…just…" he trailed off and pointed over his shoulder, feeling the heat creep up his neck and settle in his cheeks as Malfoy and his wife sprung apart and stared at him wide-eyed.
"I'm only saying," Mr Simpson said, hesitant, looking towards Astoria for support, "having Aurors searching the place won't look too good for the exhibition, Professor."
Harry frowned. He'd forgotten all about the vase, as a matter of fact, but he wasn't about to tell his deputy that. "Leave it be, for now. I'll make a decision once I get back tomorrow."
He looked down to see that the man was clutching his fingers in a tight fist, and he reached down to ease them open, wincing at the crimson, semi-circular marks from his nails digging into his palm.
"Yeah?" Harry shared a look with Neville as they waited for the lift. Hermione continued with her chatter, and when she turned to Neville, Harry zoned out, looking around the crowded hallways. He identified some familiar faces from different departments, smiled at a few who greeted him, but mostly just stared off into space.
She didn't sound convinced, but she didn't push it, and there was another awkward pause before Harry said, "Anyway, I've got to go. I'll talk to you later."
Potter’s expression sobered. “I want to tell you how untrue that is, but I don’t think you’ll listen.”
like Mad-Eye." Harry grimaced, shooting Neville a dirty look and receiving a chuckle in turn. "That's better. You're far too tense, mate. It isn't like we're off to war or something."
He scoffed at that. "Typical. We're all dying to find an excuse to get out of work, and here you are, having to be literally thrown out."
he told her as he leant back against the cool metallic wall of the lift. She huffed and glowered at him, and he couldn't help but snort at that. "Hermione, for heaven's sake, it's not like I'm going off to war or something."
Harry turned away, breathing deeply. The apparition—or whatever the hell it was—had shaken him up to the core. His nightmares had affected him during his waking hours before, admittedly, but this was taking things to a whole new level. The lift's enchanted voice announced their destination, and, as he stepped out of the lift, Harry decided once and for all that as soon as Lestrange's release and transfer were done with, he would write to Antares.
"Lisa," Harry said, his voice gentle. He had already told her a white lie once, and it went against his morals to lie to innocent witnesses in order to force them to talk, but he was desperate at this point. "Hertzfeld's life may be in danger, and if you don't help me, you might lose him, too."
He winced at having been addressed by his surname. Buxley only ever addressed him by his last name when he was
Draco came up behind him, and Harry held a hand out as he waved his wand and pulled down the Disillusionment Charm. Draco's eyes widened as he took in the bloody words so alike the ones that had been scrawled on the walls of Hogwarts in his second year, the message making his blood run cold.
"Yeah, she did. We had an argument over it, actually." She sighed. "I think it's high time we put them back. I've been talking to them about how they would feel about going back to school, and Al kept giving me vague answers, but Jamie and Lily seemed excited."
Harry turned to Malfoy and Professor Greengrass. "I don't want to be rude, but do you mind me arresting this man for interfering with the investigation?"
"You didn't let me finish." Padma smiled, her dark eyes shining. "I only said that this puts me in a tough spot. I never said anything about not helping you."
"Does it matter?" Harry snapped and then sighed. "Look, I'm not making this decision without you. Which is why I've been asking you when you're coming home. The kids've been saying they miss you, and Ron told me they're homesick, and I just think it'd be better if you were home."
Malfoy looked at him in a way that Harry looked at his kids when they were being particularly exasperating and said, "I am afraid that this is the extent to which I can help you on this matter without breaking protocol."
Ron sighed and wound an arm around Harry's waist, hefting him up and helping him hobble towards the alley. They waited a moment to make sure no one was around before Ron tightened his grip around Harry, and with a 'Hang on tight,' they Disapparated.
"You're welcome." The sound of laughter grew louder, and Harry looked over his shoulder. The person who had been spying on him seemed to have decided that whatever they had planned on doing wasn't worth the risk because they were quickly walking away from the alley. He debated if he should follow after them before checking his watch and realising that it was almost time for his appointment with Camilla. "Look, I really have to go, but make sure you get yourself a proper meal, alright?"
Lisa sniffed, offering Harry a watery smile, and said, "But I suppose he didn't anticipate that the people who were after the vase would somehow find me here, and, seeing that I didn't have the vase, would steal the blueprint." She shook her head. "I'm sorry for lying to you, but would you have believed me if I had told you the truth from the beginning?"
Finally, she smiled, a small, teary one, and reached up to place her hand on his. “Never forget that your father and I love you no matter what, Draco. You could be a werewolf or a Death Eater or the Dark Lord himself, and we would still love you all the same. You don’t have to change anything about yourself for our sakes. You are our pride and joy, my son. You will always be.”
He raced through the underbrush, small twigs and stones scraping his ankles as he wound around trees, the tip of his wand barely lighting his way. There was a loud rip somewhere to his left followed by a pained scream.
She nodded distractedly, but still called out, "And I haven't forgotten about the paperwork!" as he pulled the door shut, causing Harry to pull a face and wonder if there was somebody else he could dump Buxley's work on.
It took him a moment to realise that he was at home, all alone, with no one to hear his screams or comfort his frenzied self.
He stood up and let her help him to the sofa, feeling drowsy and like his head was full of cotton. She helped him out of his coat and tie, undid the first few buttons of his shirt, and helped him take off his belt and shoes. He lowered himself onto the sofa and fell back against the satin cushions, sighing at the feel of the cool material.
that the vase was in danger of being stolen or that Lisa's life was in jeopardy, or both. I don't know why he thought I could help—maybe because he'd met me and spoken with me briefly before—but either way, this isn't a typical theft."
She came to stand beside his desk, running a finger along the surface and biting her lip. He frowned.
Harry had accidentally brought his Muggle phone to the Ministry a few times before without turning it off, and that had led to it nearly melting every time someone called him or sent him a text message. He never really realised he'd forgotten until it was too late and had received several long lectures from both Arthur and the current head of the MMA for being so careless. So, finally, he had managed to procure a case that acted as an anti-magic shield that would protect his phone should he ever accidentally bring it into the Ministry, as he had.
"About that," Harry said, shifting in his seat. "I've handed the case over to Rogers. Only until you're back on your feet and ready to take charge, of course," he added quickly as Buxley's expression darkened.
Malfoy nodded as Harry finished speaking, and they sat in silence for a moment before Harry said, "So, I've been thinking about the auction…"
Neither his mother’s posture nor her expression gave anything away, as always, but he had learnt to notice the minute, inconspicuous movements she made that revealed her frustration. Right then, his eyes trailed down to her fingers that were clutching the armrest just a little too tight, and he contained the urge to take another swig from the bottle.
"Harry! There you are! I went over to your place and Ginny told me you were here so I had to come all the way back," Ron rambled as he rummaged around inside a bag and pulled out several boxes.
Harry blustered, not knowing how to respond, but she only laughed, seeming embarrassed. "I've wanted to apologise for that since the moment I sent it. I don't know what came over me. I don't think Jon's ever been that angry with me in all the years we've been together."
"He was going to propose to her soon, before all this happened," Draco murmured softly, as though afraid he may disturb the duo in question.
By the time he had gotten through the entire pile, he had cried enough to make up for the past decade, and he was exhausted. He eyed the last picture that was left, sighing as he picked it up. His eyes widened as he saw it, though, and his heart thudded in his chest.
Harry hummed in thought, his gaze following Draco around the small flower shop until he returned to the desk. Harry pushed the paper bag he'd placed on the counter forward. "Alright, I'll leave, but only after I see you finish this." He reached into the bag to pull out a box containing a pasty and a sausage roll, a paper coffee cup, some paper napkins, and two sugar-glazed Yum-Yums.
He'd just reached the bottom when he heard a rattling from the living room. Stopping dead in his tracks, he reached for his wand and realised he'd left it upstairs.
Harry shrugged a shoulder. "I suppose it's not something very recent. Because of my nightmares, I used to go weeks on barely a few hours of sleep, before, but at that time I didn't have a lot of other things I had to deal with. Now that I think about it, I don't even remember when I started to sleep less and less. It just sort of happened."
Harry was about to open the folder when Malfoy placed his hand atop his. He looked up at the blond, feeling a jolt run down his spine from how cold the other man's fingers were, and Malfoy smiled down at him. "I recommend that you read this when you're by yourself and can devote enough time and attention to it. It isn't something you can finish in one sitting, but I would suggest that you carry one of the sheets provided around with you so that you can pen down your thoughts whenever they come to you."
Draco swept a hand through his hair, his own anxiety causing his heart to race. What other explanation could there be for his son's mysterious disappearance? "Maybe there was a glitch in the connection?"
"Congratulations," I say, donning my 'professional smile' and attempting to sound half as enthusiastic as he looks, at least for courtesy's sake. "I'm sure she'll be thrilled."
"Today is the Annual National Potions and Potioneering Expo," he said to the kettle on the stove. "Astoria was a panelist and one of the main organisers this year. She was supposed to put on a demonstration, and Scorpius was supposed to have assisted her. He worked hard all year for it. He was beyond excited."
Draco was still standing there, open-mouthed and hand half-raised to make a point, even after his mother bustled away and a house-elf appeared to clean up after her. He sighed in resignation, all sense of pride and purpose having deflated, and trudged up to his bedroom to get changed and confront the inevitable.
A disembodied voice announced the lift's arrival, and she stepped in, barely waiting for him to enter before shutting the doors and clicking on the button marked G. She continued to stare at the door and ignored his existence.
Buxley rolled his neck with a groan, and Harry winced as it cracked. "Right. Threatening message. Where was it found?"
