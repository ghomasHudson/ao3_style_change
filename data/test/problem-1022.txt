I carelessly wiggled my fingers in a gesture of a greeting, my lips spread still in a mischievous smile as the moonstone of my eyes found Caetia's, my voice quirky and light as I spoke out to Sirius' boy. "I need you teach me a few things, stripper boy."
My reddened cheeks were streaked with my tears now, my mouth emitting a moaning whine that hiccuped in my sobs, eyelashes wet with droplets and my hair haphazard with my sweat and its natural chaotic strands.
I hoped Hezian had knowledge on Sirius being alive because the damn man had to keep tabs on his assassins somehow and surely Harry told him since the war was over and protecting Sirius wasn’t necessary anymore so he could tell people his godfather was alive and well. I also hoped Hezian new about Sirius’ boyfriend.
“You’re coming. We’re going. Pansy wants you to go and I do too. You have great fucking grades in each class so don’t worry about editing. Do it in the early morning.” My friend's words had a determined finality to it, his voice low as he somewhat snapped at me in a hiss of frustration, causing me to whip my eyes back to his and narrow my gaze into sharp slits.
Draco was still the tiny little thing that he was the last time I’ve seen him. Although now his body was lit up like someone stuck a firecracker inside of him and fired him up from the inside out. A lantern in the mindset of this once darkened room I suppose.
I jerked against the wall, breath wheezing past my gaping, surprised mouth as I felt my person wrack with shivers at the pressure around my prick.
The bottom half of my body seemed to jolt across Harry’s lap when I took in the sight of the Gryffindor tilting his head back to mess the disheveled pitch black strands of his tousled hair across the unblemished marble etched skin of his forehead as the dark of his lashes brushed feather light across the high of his sharp cheekbones, closing his eyes the same time he released a puff of hazed grey fume from the open of his mouth.
Looking up from having eyed the plush black duvet thrown haphazardly over my legs, my gaze seemed to hone in on the figure lazed back on top of a desk propped up against the far wall opposite of me.
I could feel my eyes turn into huge round circles, as if I was a deer caught in headlights. The furnace of heat gathered behind me to caress down the length of my exposed back and spine, making my legs weaken in their stance as well as my breath whoosh out from my lungs as if I was punched in the gut.
“I’ll get to work on it immediately,” I responded, albeit breathlessly when I felt some of Harry’s heated cum slipping out around the butt plug, causing my feet to shuffle about restlessly as I tried to keep from blushing like a damn fool.
I subconsciously felt the moue of my mouth turning more into a profound pout as I realized what Weasley had said, a heat coiling tight in my gut from remembering Potter call me by such a nickname. I tried to keep the tremor of my voice from spilling out to hide the embarrassment spreading out over my body. “Did Potter say that? I’m not a fucking kitten, dammit.”
I did want protection from Arte et Marte, and with the fact that I had nothing to protect myself against any dangerous situations, I was powerless to do anything. And I would be doing something good for the wizard world for once by getting rid of Animadverto. I had enough experience in death and I didn’t want others to have to deal with that sort of stuff and have their mental states ruined.
When I whimpered out loud at the constricting tightening hold of the assassin’s hand around my neck, I felt a shocking burst of warmth and crazed delighted arousal run through the lax of my body as I fell into a heady space of replaying Harry saying that he
I winced when my ass gave an involuntary quiver around the butt plug, making me scramble to stand beside Harry again and make sure Hezian didn’t see my ass in case Harry’s cum started to seep out of my hole like a damn faucet and wet the back of my jeans.
The glow of the purple streak of lighting spread out over the contours of Harry’s face, hardened and striking in the defined slope of his cheekbones and strong jawline, causing the glow of his red green eyes to flicker with the electric amethyst hue of the lightning playing over his body and features.
It seemed as if I was angering Harry at my wanting for him though. I was so obvious about my stupid crush on the man that it made him want to stay clear of me.
My ears had rung with a painful screech at the sound of whatever it was that crashed into the room, an ache settling in the thrumming of my temples and stomach as the vibrating clicking rumble that escaped it caused my whole body to freeze up in terror, as if my whole frame had become non existent in the face of my fear.
Crimson color washed the whole of the surface of the floor, flooding the ground with its copper scent mindling in with the sour scent the killing creatures eluded.
I was happy though, and like I promised the assassin, since I got my ice cream, I kept my mouth shut around him for the rest of the night, and behaved. For now at least.
to the point that he’s lost his capability to speak, hmm”. The Gryffindor’s voice dropped even lower into a taunting, brutal lilt that made me splutter in indignation and warmed prominence.
The man cut her off, his tone sharp and crisp, rumbling with an annoyed jilt that made the fascinating mixture of sea green and crystalline blue of his eyes conjure up a stormy inflection. “Ignore Yevsky here, she’s just jealous that Draco Malfoy has an lovelier figure and arse than she does. Krum makes it a rule here, in any part of this club, that we treat our customers with no judgement and with complete compliance. So I apologize on her behalf. It’s not everyday we get to see a Malfoy entering a BDSM room.”
The redhead had come to me right when I convinced Catia to show me some of his stripper moves so I could go to a club and dance my arse off in front of a good amount of people to piss Harry off since he made me mad. It was also because I’ve been having this urge to get under Harry’s skin and make him angry as well as get my kicks off in the process, to do something I know that was wrong or out of character for me.
continue with the horrible, panicky notion that Harry was just getting hard on the aspect of teaching the ex death eater a lesson that he had coming to him for ages and that the assassin felt no desire for me whatsoever.
The swift motion made my body tilt to the side, my eyes widening in befuddled warmth as a yelp sounded sudden from my lips when Harry let the hand he had over my spine lift up and off of my back only to roughly grasp the back of my head with the whole of his free palm and brutally give a simple push upon my skull to cause my face to slap against the flat of the stair that I laid out over, the right side of my cheek pressing against the ground as I felt myself trapped with the assassin’s hand pushing my face down and rising my arse up against the heat of his hard, large and long cock.
You hide, I seek. I find you within thirty minutes after the hour is up, you lose. If not, then you win. It’s a game. And it starts
Both our rooms had the same color scheme of the living room with hard wooden floors and pastel light toned beige silk covered beds with large creamy marble peach hued bathrooms. The kitchen had that same soft white colored marble architecture that was positioned behind the living room, pristine and breathtaking.
Harry let out a deep, thunderous contemplative hum that sunk itself deep into the hollow of my bones.
“That’s quite alright, little one. I wouldn’t mind it if you got even closer, just so I can grab a hold of that creamy slender neck of yours and drain you of that Malfoy bloo-” A hand came up out of nowhere, catching me off guard as I watched fingers grasp the side of the (now known) vampire’s face with a bruising force, blunt nails scraping into the creature’s freezing cheek and making the man hiss out before being shoved carelessly aside like a flea.
Huffing out an exasperated breath, I made my trek towards Pansy’s bed with a dramatic flair, having stuck my nose up into the air with my lips quirking further to reveal a haughty prominence upon my face as I tossed my tailored, buttoned up white top off of my torso to pick up the big dark green thin sweater off of the neatly made bed my friend sat on and slipped it on.
I constantly walked on foot to wherever I needed to go because wizards didn’t believe in any of the muggles great technology and machinery, such as cars.
It was fucking downright torture to watch the way Harry laid out on his couch. The Gryffindor had changed out of his bloodied clothes and into clean dark blue jeans that slung low off of his narrowed defined hip bones and a simple dark navy blue V-neck short sleeve top that showed off the chords of muscles of his triceps and biceps.
My eyes wouldn’t move from its spot to where I stared, stricken and mortified, at the broad chest of Harry’s that practically glued itself to the front of my frame, the slamming of my heart beneath my rib cage roughened and violent. But soon my vision became a blur of colors when the Gryffindor swiftly and too fast for my brain to pick up on, brought his hand away from my seeking tongue to grab handfuls of my arse cheeks, digging the blunt of his fingers into the plump flesh in that large palm of his as his other hand rose up to slip beneath the onslaught of my mini skirt with a teasing tap of the tip of his long index finger running across my shivering flesh. The heat of his hand trailed up my leg, inching up with a crude scorch of his touch as he went to clasp the bottom meat of my left thigh in a vice grasp, frighteningly calm. All strict power and casual darkness.
“Y-you guys are fucking b-b-bas-” I yelped, the sound mortifyingly defeaning to my burning ears when everything happened all at once, my mouth dropping open.
The hard lines of my body stiffened further at the scene playing out before me, a wash of rapture flooding my system with sickening delight as I watched Draco’s pretty rose bud arehole swallow the length of my angry, reddened cock, sucking me in with a whorish need that made the heat dip down my spine, causing a short burst of shivers to trail over my strained flesh.
"Well aren’t you a snuggle bun-” Harry’s soft, deep murmur halted when he once again, went visibly stalk still and I felt every muscle in his body go taut.
Today was a long day. I didn’t even want to dwell on the fact that Potter and I would be living in the same space together for the next few months, bringing on a clashing of heat and nerves in the confines of my body.
Sweeping the soft fabric of the towel down the inner skin of my thighs, I let out a shaky breath from the heated friction between my legs, an image of Potter pressing me up against the wall in that dark room with his muscular scorching leg teasing and pressing into the part of my thighs invading the solace of my head.
I had felt my flesh break out in shuddering shivers as I let out a light gasp in horror and surprise when I heard the the creaking of the room’s door make a minute grate of sound to suddenly burst apart at the hinges, wood splintering with a deafening
“Go on then.” Harry spoke through a low murmur, eyes hooded and silently penetrating his gaze into me and setting my skin on fire beneath it.
But I wasn’t happy about having a demon make me do things just so it could end up eating and killing me in the process. And I wasn’t happy about Zereth being the thing to open up a whole new perspective of myself.
Jutting out my bottom lip, I actually lifted my right foot and stomped it against the hard surface of the brick covered street, the smack of my booted sole ricocheting off of the walls of the multiple buildings around me.
And the weight of the chain cuffs around my wrists was only making my panic worse by each passing silent second I was left suspended in the air.
I looked over at Catia who sat to the far right in the corner with my cousin, settled precariously over Sirius’ lap as he gave me a sultry tilt of his lips in encouragement while lazily giving me a thumbs up. His body was covered in black glitter and a dark luscious red corset with ruffled panties and black pumps, the colors accentuating his slim figure and the pretty shade of his brown eyes and fluffy hair.
The force of my buttocks smacking against Harry’s arm made the entirety of my frame break out in quakes, blood pumping hot and fast in my prick and a prickling pain stinging across the skin of my arsecheeks, hot and searing and
I heard Harry chuckle beside me, breaking me out of my reverie as I whipped my head sideways to tip it back and stare up at Harry’s handsome face with a befuddled look I had on my own since I’ve stepped foot into the living room.
My chest and face took the blunt of my weight, the palm of my sweat slick hands pressing against the floor as I moved my head to the side to let my cheek rest against the ground with a stutter in my chest, my saucer shape, moonstone gaze trying to find Harry’s as the man brought this head up and
After a moment of dreaded silence in the room, Harry, as if finally deciding to come back to me, snapped his brilliant dewy grass green and inflamed eyes back to me, releasing a voice made up of no emotion and a frigid note that caused my own body to become taut with tension. “We’ve been compromised.”
Harry leaned down and shoved his thigh further into my groin and arse, bringing my legs up significantly more and causing my toes to create a wisp of air between the ground and my dangling feet, having my body practically hanging off of Harry's thigh. My spine dug into the smooth floor below me as I started to whine and thrash about across the ground in bewildered scorch.
Furrowing my brows, I watched Harry carefully, a panic starting to already itch its way beneath my skin at the thought of possibly damaging the Gryffindor in some shape or form with my potion.
The demon crouched down, bending at their knees as they hunched over to get their eyes level with mine, the muscles in their body contracting with each movement in a powerful drawl as they barely even breathed.
be together.” Harry murmured his confession to me, the rough of his voice dropping significantly as he watched me through the strands of his shadowed, tousled hair, opening and releasing his hold on my throat like he was straining against the urge to choke me out or let me
I blinked up at the man staring down at my slightly bent form as I tried to breathe evenly, lips parted with the pale tendrils of my hair brushing over the wide set of my eyes.
"Ah, ah, ah, ah! Yes, oh gods please, please, please! Harry!” My cock pulsed painfully as I cried out, mouth opening in a silent yell as I spilled my seed in copious amounts beneath my skirt, my prick bursting out my arousal as I seized across the granite floor.
I slid down the wet granite surface with a squeak from my mouth and a squelch of my hole working over Harry’s plundering cock, slipping over the surface as I downright screamed bloody murder when the Gryffindor fucked into me harder and
from the way you look and that pure, gorgeous essence you carry around within yourself as well as that cute, petulant and intelligent personality. What I have festering within my flesh and bones
At least Harry’s mind was off of whatever morbid thoughts he conjured up when I asked him about his reason for becoming an assassin. His mind was with me now, and that made me flood with a giddy happiness that I would never say out loud.
Harry, you’re always gone and I’m left alone a-a-and I wanted to see what this place was like. I-I-”
Letting out a tired sigh that Hezian had seemed to notice in the middle of our conversation about his pet turtles, the eerie blue color of his eyes flashed with some sort of hushed bemusement as he titled his head and nodded towards the entrance that led out to the backyard of the Weasleys’ house.
My wand was ordered to be kept by Potter. And I never seen the Golden Boy for years since his defending of my mother and I in our trial after the war.
The demon swung its arm out, gripping a hold of my upper thigh as I was about to let my leg drop back down from where I hit the demon, causing my body to stagger from my sudden imbalance.
Just by the ceaseless vacant gaze that the assassin procured upon me made my groin heat up with a terror that enticed a long breath to exhale out of my moist mouth. I knew what Potter wanted me to say. I never said his name out loud, just his surname, and it seemed like he was taunting me for it, as if he knew that my admittance to his first name shown how much power he had over me, how much power I gave over to him by breathing out the mere syllables of his first name.
I pressed my lips together to keep my mouth from forming an embarrassed little jilted laugh out of its confines.
There were no upper levels, except for the stairs to the far sides that led down into whatever other rooms this place had.
The demon tilted my head to the side, running the tip of it's clawed thumb along the line of my jaw to beneath my chin in a dangerous glide that pricked along my flesh there. My hair was left askew as it brushed across my forehead by Zereth’s motion, the long tendrils of my hair brushing across my shoulders and obscuring my view a bit as the demon motioned my head to the side and up so that I could look directly at into it's unnerving eyes.
“The jeans fit great. And they’re comfy so that’s a plus.” My voice came out jilted in a neutral cadence, but with the way Pansy flipped the long locks of her voluptuous thick brown hair behind the slender shape of her shoulder with her own lascivious grin crossing the gorgeous lines of her angular face, she very well knew that I was quiet joyous on how well the jeans turned out looking on me.
Keeping my eyes on the bartender station, I gave a bite to the inside of my cheek before walking towards the table and looking for the alcohol provider.
me there so I wouldn’t end up getting aroused in the middle of a massacre while covered in a creatures innards.
Hitching up the bottom hem of my skirt around the underside of my bum, I ignored the sensation to cover myself up with the knowledge that I probably had, at most, twenty minutes left to find a spot to hide from Harry gnawing at the back of my head, and released a big, shuddering breath, while I practically stomped on over towards the ivy covered wall.
I still couldn’t understand myself and sometimes it’s better to keep far away from finding everything out about what one was. To go further into the human psyche with which you live in could be detrimental to yourself. Whether people agree or not, things are really better left untouched, unsaid, unseen and unheard to keep moving forth at times.
” My voice snapped out in a feverish pitch when I felt he slick of Harry’s cock thrust into my hole with a primal severity, the tip of his hot prick having prodded expertly at my prostate.
you. You’ll get hurt. And not in the way I want to hurt you. You’ll end up dead by my hands. I can’t have that happen. I can’t control
My chest constricted at the fact that Potter didn’t think of me in a sexual manner, no sign of any interest in my person, physically. And bloody hell, it was mortifying to hear Potter talk about fucking me like I wanted him to in that rasped mocking tone of his.
Harry was already well acquainted with his own urges of saving people; his hero complex getting the best of him even when he, too, had dark magic that wanted to kill and fuck with people for the fun of it.
And now I was left looking at the Gryffindor who seemed to be two seconds away from going on a sex rampage.
I was a contradiction, one solid idea bouncing to the next with a wobbly platform that couldn’t hold such desires that often switched from bad and good.
Feeling the brush of soft lips across the shell of my right ear when Harry gave a minute shift of his fingers around the grip he had of my thigh with the opening and closing of his hand in an possessive fondling, the low of his deep voice murmured disturbingly calm and dirty into my ears while the sharp of his cheekbones pressed into my temple as he backed me, tight, against the wall some more with the hard lines of his looming body.
My mouth parted for a second before I snapped it shut in affronted surprise, irritation itching beneath my skin and mortification threatening to coat over my cheeks. Instead of blushing with anger and shame, I pushed away the sensation to take in the annoyance I felt and gave the guard a sneer. “I highly doubt you’d be able to do anything with how big you are, sure you may be packing some strength but I don’t think you’re fit to run fast. You wouldn’t be able to kick me out because I’d have outrun you before you caught me, you stupid twat.”
I'm extremely sorry for such a long wait for an updated chapter. But here it is! I hope you enjoy it. There will be more to come, just give me time because this story is quiet a roller coaster of emotions and character development as well as some intense plot line that I have to work up to.
My lips released a wet gasp as Harry crowded in on me, making my back practically try to sink its way into the surface behind me as the Gryffindor’s voice came out in an unrestrained morass, that same ominous magical energy I felt before come from the Chosen One’s essence seeping its way out of his bronzed flesh and into the open atmosphere surrounding us.
“This is where I live. Well, in all technicality, this is the path to where my house is. I walk through the cave here and at the end of it, where it opens back up, is where my
Emotions varied on every spectrum in this party, from sad to happy and in between. People were either dressed too down, too little, or just right.
The demon’s breath smelled like pure carnage of raw meat that was left out to decay in the drying sun.
The Gryffindor opened the malicious curve of his seductive grin, all predator sharp and callous. “You look nice getting all weak for me,
The raspy voice of the female vocalist sounded throughout the area, soft instrumentals playing out in a breath of sorts as the woman talked in a slow yet harsh and sultry tone. I had started to sway my hips slightly while I took an easy walk around the large pole in the middle of the stage, heels clicking away as I took a deep breath to calm the racing of my heart and the blood rushing to my head.
I scoffed. “Don’t me call me by any nicknames, I still am a guest here and we wouldn’t want any bad reviews about how Astringent treats their customers, now would we? I do work with a company that also deals with magazine publications. Now I’m going to go inside and you’re going to do your job and stay out here like the good guard dog that you are for Zabini.”
I hadn’t realized I was holding my breath, the mere presence that Harry exuded intoxicating my very core. My lungs felt collapsed beneath the weight of air that I held inside of the trembling cage of my chest. The way my eyes honed in on the strained muscles in Harry’s forearms, biceps, and triceps beneath the fabric of his button up made me realize that I may have looked crazy to the Gryffindor. I bet my eyes looked as if they were going to pop out of my head with how ridiculously large they went at the sight of him.
The only reaction that came from the Assassin was a slight wriggling of his nose as if it was irritated inside by something, and sure enough, Harry’s face contorted a miniscule of a moment into a disturbed scrunch before he released a sneeze.
But right before I was about to tell Harry to not look so regrettable, he spoke in out a low drawl to me, his eyes ensnaring my own in a heavy focus. “I’m sorry I made you feel that way. I care about you deeply and I never want you to think that I didn’t care about your well being. I trust Cho and Hezian and I’d never purposefully put you in danger like that. I didn’t realize that you would think that way and that’s my own fault.”
It'll help with letting the potion calm down as well.” I spoke out my trembled words to Harry as I breathed out in relief at knowing that Harry was sane enough to ask for my consent and he knew that I needed his consent as well.
clogged up the nauseous clutter in my stomach, acidic in the working tensed lines of my jaw. I could hear the screeching of my teeth grinding against one another in my effort to keep my rage from spewing out to mask the hurt that throbbed painfully within the my body.
The Gryffindor’s nonchalant actions and stature made my breath hitch in my working throat, my gaze wandering up the lean and muscled body of Harry’s, taking in wide shoulders and the blood soaking his clothes and splotched across his striking features and unruly dark hair that swept over his forehead when he tilted it and watched me
I had done my best to put Harry’s pants back on and bodily dragged his unconscious body towards his couch, my limbs and ass sore as I outright dry heaved the whole time.
Don’t want to catch flies now, do we?” Harry’s voice was dripping with taunting crude sin, bringing me out of my daze of perverse thoughts as my cheeks inflamed. I sputtered on the spot and forced myself to whip my eyes away from the assassin’s red green glow of a gaze to catch sight of my own appearance more closely.
“I didn’t kill them. If that’s what you think. And if Trisko wasn’t with someone, then why was he naked? He must have had sex before, so-” This time, Kingsley cut my sentence off.
It’s not like Harry would make me do anything horrible at least, so I could follow through with this game of his.
Weasley had on a simple pair of black jeans and a long sleeve dark green shirt that did well to compliment the shade of his auburn hair and bright blue eyes. The man had crossed his arms over his chest doggedly while he waited for mine or Harry’s reply.
“Because you're the only person that can take its magic and give your own as well, wizards have tried for thousands of years to take a creature’s or demon’s magic but they always ended up getting overwhelmed with the heaviness their magic carried along and the immense power, resulting with their own death. Creatures don’t have humanoid bodies and can’t control their magic like wizards can, every time they do, the magic is flimsy and weak so they often find a wizard to try and take over their bodies so they can use magic for their special gains. But no wizard has the strength to hold said creature or demon's magic without dying in the process. But you carry elf blood and with elf blood comes dark magic, so you have the capacity to take demons’ and creatures’ magic, combine it with your own, and let them use you or you use them with your own magic. Given what happened in history, it seems the creatures and demons have no interest in letting you use them, but them use you.” Harry watched the way my face pinched together in a look of concentration as I tried to piece together every informational detail that the assassin was giving me.
My head fell back, a dead weight. I felt my cheek thud against Harry’s shoulder, resting there as I spewed forth a stream of cum that shot out of my purpling cock in an arc. It sprayed across the obsidian floor, my body shuddering while my hips made an indefinite convulsing like motion that made the white buzz in my ears become a static sound reminding me of the pelting of rushed rain.
But this time, without the voice having the power to make my head feel like it was tearing itself apart by each painful peel away from a suture, there only remained a stinging thrum that made my ears ring in a high pitch hum that rattled my temples enough to cause an intense migraine.
People swarmed the space from each nook and cranny of the house, dancing above us to the bass of the music, sensual and sultry in its tones as they breathed in each other’s sweat and rubbed over one another’s skin, chest to chest and groin to groin, arse grinding back against the front roll of someone’s rolling hips.
Blinking rapidly, through the blur of my panicked vision covered in the slime and excess meat of the Carbonou creature that spewed its dead waste all over me not a few seconds ago, I saw Harry’s figure a few feet away from my own.
The assassin’s features had been smoothed out into a look of stern focus, the enticing shape of his lips neutral as the ticking in strong jaw showed the tension he kept inside of his body.
But right when I was about to turn around and rush out of this enclosed space to find somewhere else to hide away in, my large eyes caught sight of a, small in their frame, settled upon the one desk inside this odd, almost barren room.
The Gryffindor held steady though, his body immobile as he held me in his arms with a tight grip that wouldn’t let me up as I started to huff and puff about like a little child, cheeks hot as I started to let out little growls of frustration that probably sounded like tiny little mewls to Harry as he just stared down at me with a nonplussed face that I so very much wanted either between my thighs or on my lips this very moment.
The stupid little fuck started to spasm and splutter about as spit foamed up his throat and started to create a rabid cloud of crimson around the edges of his gnashing mouth, the whites of his eyes bright and terror streaked while his gaze rolled to the back of his head.
Hello Everyone! I wanted to first say that I am truly sorry that I haven't been updating for a such a long time. Life has the tendency of getting in the way of me writing. I work a lot and it doesn't help that my mental state hasn't been good for the past few months either. I apologize for the delay in giving you all a new chapter. But alas, here it is.
one, my skin breaking out in aroused goosebumps that I wanted to slap myself for. This was not the time to get all hot and bothered by Harry right now. And with all the carnage around us and the fact that Harry was holding a creature’s heart in his hand between our close bodies, it made the simmering pleasure I felt stay at a low broil inside of my body.
But the thought of Harry mingling about in a sex club made my skin erupt in unwanted tremors, a sensation of an aching itch that made my flesh feel as if it wanted to set itself aflame to rid the hurt and anxiety flooding my system.
The place before me was covered in white washed walls, a brightness that was such a light color that it could have blinded someone if not for the steel doors and blood covering both the grounds and walls, giving the large ballroom sized area a tiny splash of scheme.
The hand on my arse grew harder with its grasp when Harry’s gaze traced the flutter of my eyelashes against the tops of my cheekbones, making my eyes widen and a sound of distress leave my occupied mouth as I was abruptly bounced up the wall from the slow grind of Harry’s hips up against my own, his cock rubbing over mine with a heavy, heated friction that made the whole of my body erupt in shivers.
I released all of my magic at once, the sharp point of my focus exploding behind my eyelids in a wash of bright light as all of my magic and the energy I carried within me spilled out of my body like a dam.
The vampire was going to die because I misbehaved and decided to goad the damn creature on like an idiotic brat. I brought attention to us and now Potter was going to make me say his name again for the sole purpose of teaching me a lesson for causing trouble so quickly.
Potter’s hair was just as messy as it was last night, brushing across the smooth, bronze skin of his forehead as dewey grass green eyes mingled with wine red wisps stared down at me. His gaze was unsettling with its heavy focus, alluring and damaging to my mental state all at once.
I wasn’t prepared for the wave of nausea to hit every nerve of my limbs and the floating weightlessness of my body for the short period of time as I was teleported from one spot to the next.
. You’re probably hungry since you didn’t eat this morning, so we'll get you some food before resting. I’ll have Granger drop off the clothes she got you in our guest room by tomorrow.”
So I snapped my teeth together in a hard grit at the blistering, thinning atmosphere around me that proved my magic was slipping out to claim Draco’s body and essence under my hard body, hissing out my struggle as I tried to reign the sickness invading my system and the area around me. My muscles tensed and relaxed profusely, cock still hard inside of my Princess as I sucked in a large shuddering breath and soaked the perilous energy back into the confined spaces of my head and within my skin.
Pressing my lips together to keep from releasing anymore embarrassing sounds of surprise or shock from the water splashing about all over the length of exposed calves and thighs, I trudged through the shallow water with quick steps, a shadow crossing over my running frame as the curved rocky walls arched in above my head and created a wide, large tunnel of sorts.
The friction of my cock brushing against the muscular thigh of Harry’s from beneath my jeans as I was helpless in the man’s arms while I slid down his frame, had me give out a pathetic whine high in the back of my throat, my tummy rubbing up against his defined stomach.
These were just thoughts though. I couldn’t grasp what my magic wanted. But it had an inkling interest, obsessive and possessive, over Draco. And it seemed my magic was lashing out at not having full control over the gorgeous Slytherin so it sought out ways to feel that same sensation it had when I fucked Draco by killing and doing everything morally wrong to take all the darkness and ball it up into a bundle of power that could only give it the smidgen of the same feeling as it felt when I was
The man also looked like someone completely different. Potter eluded sin, embodied it with a sensual prominence that was both intimidating and magnetic.
With Harry filling Hezian in on my new found abilities and my having to be a conduit for dark creatures and demons, Hezian had propositioned me with a new found job in working for him as a potions maker for any of the company’s needs with the knowledge that I could very well take care of myself and even be used here and there with Harry by my side in assigned missions.
Looking back at the front of me, I gasped when Harry made a sharp turn left and back up with the bike lilting sideways in fluid transitions, my chest heaving with excited, nerve wrecked adrenaline as the frame of my body came within a few feet from the ground at the easy tilt of the bike with Harry’s effortless handling of it.
I let out a frustrated moan, body warming even further when the brush of my cock rubbed across the hard planes of Harry’s abs, my breath punching out of my throat as I whipped my head away from Harry’s line of sight so I could frantically push away from Harry’s body with a flailing of my hands against his shoulders.
There were people that willingly didn’t mind to be experimented on. They gave their full consent to potion creators to test their products on them. Harry was most likely not someone who was used to being experimented on and I selfishly didn’t want anything to happen to him specifically that would take some time for me to reverse its undesired effects if it came down to that sort of outcome.
I ducked my head and kept quiet as I took one quick step and another, slipping through the cracks and spaces people left between their huddled bodies as I made sure to keep some space to myself as I walked around multiple wizards and muggles.
Instead of resting, with my cock still hard rock inside of Draco, I softly took off the flat of my booted foot from the blonde’s temple and conjured up my powers to apparate both of us up into my bedroom, where I sat on top of my mattress and situated Draco’s flopping body around to get him to face me with his front pressed against my chest, making him spread his weakened thighs over my own larger ones so he could straddle me as I all but lifted up his whole body by grasping onto his hips in a careless ease. The downy feather silver strands of his messy hair flowed and sprawled out over his bare shoulders in a tantalizing view, the flat of his stomach carrying pearly whites of his own drying cum and the plump of his arse squishing delightfully over my upper legs. His skin was a darling shade of rose quartz.
Before I could open my mouth to protest, Harry had plucked me off of him without looking back at me, his body seeming to be made up of rock as the muscles of his lean frame made no shift to show any sign of discomfort as Harry took the rest of the steps up to reach the level where all those agonized screams echoed and the sound of those Carbonou’s deafening growls and snarls came from, their scent overwhelming and filthy in its stench.
Ah, I loved writing this chapter! I don't want to give much away with my constant jabbering mouth. So here it is and I hope you enjoy. The next update will be in two weeks, the same time V:ASA will be updated. So you guys will be getting two in one, whoo!
“A m-motorcyle? You have one?” My voice came out stunted and covered in genuine surprise, the simple thought of Harry owning a motorcycle causing my chest to rise sharply as a bundle of warmth cascaded down my back in anticipatory anxiety.
And in response to his looming powerful body seeming cruel and calm, my body had moved on its own on instinct as I took a trembling step back only to be halted in my steps when Harry had spoke lowly, tone almost deafening to my ears in the low rumble that gave way from the dark timbre of his voice, rendering me stunted on the spot. “You’re going to give me a lap dance.”
“You deserved it.” I huffed through a mumble as I stared down at Harry, trying to cover up my obvious sudden gross enthusiasm at the assassin’s given proposition and instead went on talking about my right to be a brat at the club.
I squealed out, watching the shifting muscles of Harry’s shoulder blades tense and relax as he bent the slightest to dig his fingers harder into my bum and drag me up the wall with the pull of his hand, pressing his chest flush against my own in a dizzying action.
“To be honest I’m wary about falling asleep with other people in the area I’m in. B-But … I’m just really hesitant about resting in a stranger’s place and-” My nervous rambling was cut off by Grangers breathy laugh.
I felt the whole of Harry’s frame stiffen then, the strain of his muscles becoming taut and brokering a sort of rigidity that caused every defined slope of his body to become sharper in its lines, harsh and salacious.
Harry’s response was to only give me a dimpled, charming and alarmingly cheeky grin that held the barest note of that dark intention behind the easy smile he gave away on his new person’s face.
Just as he lifted me up, with my arsehole still sucking down Harry’s cock, I swept out my left arm feebly to get a good grasp around the tube that contained my potion and quickly let it’s smoky contents touch Harry’s nose.
how cute and utterly pathetic of you.” Harry spoke lowly into my face, the soft strands of his hair brushing across my forehead as he watched the heated and fearful expressions playing across my face as well as the way my fingers twitched and became restless around his wrist.
Harry’s voice created a violent shudder to race down my bowed back, his words echoing the silent demand that was evident in the possessive, threatening touch he procured upon my figure, dripping in sinister delighted malice as his tone rumbled above me. “Arse up, face down.”
“I’d like you to be the one to drop the potions into the facility from the rooftop of the building right into the large open vent there. I figured since you made the potion, you could be the one to release it and make some more use of yourself,” Hezian intoned smoothly.
The words Harry was speaking had made my throat close up in on itself, an ache settling like a warmed lump in the back of my throat as I swallowed around the burning sensation that clawed its way up in into my neck and clogged my airway.
“Bloody hell! How many times must I have to go through with this stupid teleportation technique!? My insides are going to be
I stared back at the man, the expanding meat of my lungs trapped within the confines of my rib cage as it felt like they were suffocating with a heady sense of profuse disorientation.
I came and came, wet seeping into the fabric of my skirt, my hips twitching from the aftershocks of my bursting orgasm.
Hezian’s posture straightened out from his rather relaxed posture in his seat behind his desk, his massive body going rigid in the state of his surprise. A shocking splay of delight crossed his usually hardened features as a grin split his face, lips spreading out into a large smile as his blue eyes seemed to practically sparkle in his widened gaze that stuck on me.
Potter thinks that I’m a spoiled brat, that I thought that I was on higher ground than everyone when in reality, my thoughts were far from those ideals.
“Enough. You’re going to end up splitting the boy’s head open if you keep doing what you’re doing.” The low, vibrating husky voice of Harry’s words breathed over the plush skin of of my earlobe, the sound vibrating within the rapid rise and fall of my chest as my breaths stuttered out of my lungs while I whipped my head sideways to catch the assassin’s gaze with my own, our mouths a breadth apart.
Red, green, and gold glitter had attached themselves to me all over the expanse of my body and the clothes I wore, the deafening cheer of people suddenly flooding the once empty Weasley home as I walked in with Harry in tow right beside me through the living room entrance.
Raising my head a tid bit, I did a quick glance around to see that Harry and I were plopped across his bed.
“You want to be my boyfriend, Draco?” Harry spoke lowly, voice coated in open possessiveness that had my toes curling in on themselves and my heart obnoxiously fluttering about behind my chest, a warmth flooding my entire body that left me breathless in its wake of pure joy.
Sirius raised his dark brows, his expression turning that of mirthful mischievousness that made the stretch of his lips wide, the black of his eyes gleamed with devilish joy as the man let out a resounding amused chuckle that echoed throughout the entirety of the bathroom. “Caetia wouldn’t stop bending over in the kitchen so I had to quickly get us on out of here and into another guest room so I could fuck him. On our way out of this guest room, Harry came across us and told us to take a good few hours of a break from babysitting you, so we left. Sorry about that.”
My face warmed before I felt a trickle of ice skate down my spine in the wake of my awareness of myself and the words I was about to yell at Harry in my fit of sexual frustration and hurt. I knew that Krum had heard my angered words since the fucking hallway was so silent, any noise would be heard, our voices ringing loud and clear through the darkened walkway.
I made quick work to wrap my weak arms around Harry’s lower back loosely, pressing the entire length of my body with his and fitting us together as if we were made as one, my cries of both anger and sadness pouring out of my tired bones and onto the assassin. Letting him take some of my weight as I had let him do when he panicked.
I didn’t even hesitate when I heard Draco’s distressed, slutty moan tremble out of his slack mouth when I easily conjured up the magic coursing wildy in my limbs and apparated both Draco and I away from the steps we were on to find ourselves settled across the black marbled second floor of my mansion at the top of the stairs.
The man grunted out in a harsh breath that whooshed over the exposed flesh of my collarbone and shoulders as he hunched in over himself and clasped his big hands over the sore of his jean covered cock, his brows drawing down in confounded pain as the brown of his eyes shifted up to look at me with an obvious spitting irritation. “What the fuck, bitch!?” The man’s voice boomed out over the loud sound of the music, strangled in its tone as it shifted from high to low frequencies while he struggled with the nick of pain I induced in his crotch.
“H-Harry!” I yelled out into the surrounding area, voice ricocheting off of the grey walls of the empty lab when the Gryffindor decided to ground his hips forward in a filthy motion, my eyes glazing over in unmistakable frenzied delight, my mouth dropping open to release a keening moan.
“Now lift that arse up higher for me, Kitten. You need to work for my cock and I need to hear you beg before getting my dick like you want, my pretty little virgin
get myself in trouble, even if the result constituted barely any words exchanged between us throughout the whole mission.
“Now I know that people with white bands aren’t interested in partnering, but I have to ask. What’s a poppet like you doing here, observing, when someone should be showing you how
I watched the way Harry’s striking features morphed into a snarl, the sharp lines of his cheekbones glistening with the sweat dripping from his temples, the dark strands of his hair chaotic in the way they licked at his forehead, his mouth open to release a groan of malicious satisfaction. The Gryffindor’s jaw kept tensing with every harsh exhale that escaped his lips, the blacks of his pupils dilating more by every ram of his cock that
magic he’s got and why a Carbonou didn’t kill me but surely talked to me through a mental link? Why the hell didn’t that Carbonou not die from Harry’s power!?
from said pig latin mumbo jumbo engraved into my flesh?” My words came out stunted and in a breathless shock, confusion and bewilderment floating along the fine tremors of my voice as I looked up at Harry from beneath the fan of my pale lashes, blinking rapidly as I tried to figure out what the fuck had happened to me and why Harry looked wickedly delighted at the moment.
I lifted up my heeled feet off of the pristine floor and came straight at the Assassin with the intention to claw his damn eyes out like the damn
Kitten was rambling incoherent, keening words from under my boot, eyes large and so bloody innocent looking as they wandered about in a dazed sort of drugged out state while I shoved my cock in and out of him with an inhumane pace, my breaths coming out harder as I tried to catch the adrenalized brutal fervor dragging its way in the depth of my chest.
Sucking in a sharp breath, I felt my body jostle about upon Harry’s firm forearm, the curve of my arse squished against the heated skin of Harry’s.
Why don’t you turn around and look at me.” Harry’s voice sounded right beside the left of my ear, breath warm and tickling the skin there. I let out a breathy, shuttering whine, so quiet that I barely heard it release from the stricken "O" shape of my mouth.
“Y-you’re fucking i-i-insane!”. The old fuck spat his words in a shrill scream that pierced the walls around us, his last stuttered response reaching a quick crescendo that rang as if the man was a banshee the moment I let my right hand lazily inch its way into the mess of his guts and intestines.
Harry’s hands immediately gripped onto my waist as I let him feel my hips writhe over his groin and lap like a wanton little slut, the song and his attention on me causing all of my insecurities to be thrown out the window as I let the music guide my mind and body, arousal bubbling in the pit of my gut as the Assassin’s gaze went every which way all over my flesh.
When Harry had woken up two hours later, he dragged himself up and plopped down on the couch with a groan of distress.
I felt a blush searing my face at having been caught in such a state, my mouth opening to rush out frantic words. “What are you doing here? I swear I didn’t do anything. Are you even allowed to come barrelling in through people’s places without their permission, huh? You almost gave me a heart attack with that barbaric entrance, invading my area like it’s yours, such impolite manners for the head Auror of the Ministry of Magic-”
the Assassin could very well take care of himself, but I was a paranoid git and I cared about Harry’s well being even when there was a highly unlikely chance of Harry getting himself into trouble.
Chang gave me a self satisfied cocksure grin then, her lips spread wide to the point where it seemed as if her face was going to crack with how big her shark like smile had become, voice coming out haughty. “I have
Harry’s body went rigid, the flex in his jaw so tight that I worried the man would snap and tear me apart at any moment, like the prey I felt like I was around this predator. The crimson of Harry’s gaze darkened into a maroon hue, flecks of jade flickering like lights in the red of his eyes as they zeroed into the way I sucked in my bottom lip and rolled it between the pinch of my white teeth. I let my bad habit show, this time using it to an advantage that I’ve never had done before, chewing profusely against the plump of my wet mouth that throbbed from the stretching it was put under by Harry’s fingers not just a few seconds ago.
Thank you to those who are sticking around to read some more of the story and to those who gave it a chance. I appreciate the kudos and love the comments as always. Feel free to visit my tumblr for my stories!: reimcai
People were everywhere, on top of counters, passed out across the floor, grinding up on one another to the beat of the music that rang loud and thrummed deliciously hard with the deep bass that hummed like a careless whisper over the sweat slick of everyone’s skin.
I sat down beside Harry now, crossing my legs over one another to cover up my aroused state as I placed my hands precariously over my groin area in hopes of covering myself up in front of Weasley.
Harry’s head leaned down then, fast and too quick for my eyes to catch as he let the red and green haze of his eyes peer at me through the obsidian strands of his disheveled hair that gleamed beneath the purple lighting, his eyes soaking my frantic expression in with an ardent rage that made my mouth pop open on a small cry, my body trembling from the barraging amount of mixed emotions being forced down into my throat and nestling in the pit of my heated gut, groin tingling and breaths coming out quicker.
And then it lifted it’s head, the dark tendrils of their hair parting to display their facial features.
And the sound of a creature-like squeal tore through the room with a torturous scream of agonized sensation, as if the thing in front of Harry that I couldn’t see had been put onto the nearest examination table and was being picked apart vessel by bloody vessel, reaping its very essence alive and slaughtering its mental stability.
I begrudgingly followed, biting down on my tongue to prevent myself from snapping at Harry for calling me “Princess”.
I couldn’t comprehend how Potter and Granger were associated with assassins when, back in Hogwarts, they wanted nothing to do with killing. Now they were both involved with a secret company that specializes in training people to do just that.
I was left alone to my own devices which didn’t consist much other than the large Muggle TV and the kitchen stocked with food that I haven’t yet touched given the simple fact that I was too bloody lazy to do anything, much less move my hands to make a meal.
in the middle of party, in someone’s house, and that someone particularly shaking visibly on the floor where they laid bruised and messed up.
,” Harry mumbled into my mouth, easing his head away to tug my hair back and bare my neck to him so he could lick a stripe with his hot tongue across the expanse of my throat in a contented hum.
“We don’t want that. I rather like you alive. Although you do seem to run your mouth a mile a minute so much at times that it makes me want to gag you with something else just to shut you up,” Harry spoke around a deepened husk of a voice.
“We got the Daily Prophet to keep the murders in Astringent from going public so no one could go snooping around and find out about Animadverto and get themselves killed. But we couldn't convince them from not posting about Andrew's murder in a few days. Before the fucker died, he ratted you out about having contained the files of the factions promising customers to one of Animadverto’s leaders when they followed the little magical traces Potter left at the club when he used it and heard some witnesses talk about you being there with an envelope. And so they wanted to come after you, thinking that you gave Potter the files and knew where he was so they could come after him. That person who looked like Kinglsey was a shapeshifter who was part of Animadverto assigned to come after you and Potter to get a hold of the files.” Hezian looked way older than he really was right now, the crinkle in his brow seeming to deepen.
like me or was this just a way to mess up my mental state of mind like he does so easily and cruelly?
I was unsettled with how my body reacted to Harry even when he was a completely different person. It was the simple fact that the unknown man next to me was actually Erus with a new identity and it went to show how powerful his magic was for him to make his glamor so flawless.
“Great. After Draco here makes the right amount of the potion we need, then you two will go get some rest and wake up early tomorrow to infiltrate Animadverto,” Hezian spoke to Harry, his face now taking on a look of seriousness as his features hardened.
The goblin behind the towering desk had looked up from beneath the perch of his round spectacles only to veer his head down so he could gaze down upon both Harry and I with how high the goblin’s seat was behind his looming desk, the wrinkle of his flesh growing more furrowed as he gave a raise of his brow in surprised bemusement, his pointed ears twitching as he stared at us.
The long line of his lean and muscled body had shifted only a bit from the slow, steady rise up his chest with the air he breathed, with such very little movement that I would not have caught it if not for the thousand times I’ve observed Harry throughout the years of our lives spent together at Hogwarts.
Harry let out a thunderous growl, animalistic like and aggressive. The sound emitted from deep within his chest, shaking my body along with the sound from the ferocity of the noise he created.
And with the way he started to breathe abnormally too fast a little bit ago before Caetia came, it seemed he was going into a panic attack on top of his mixture of emotions.
Then I caught sight of Harry’s face that finally met mine since he was distracted with the floor in his attempt to collect himself.
So now here we were, Harry looking at me like the life had been drained out of him while he watched me in silent observation as I stupidly displayed my excitement for the potion having worked.
.” Harry’s words were filled with salacious, filthy intent, low and mumbling in the slightly roughened hue of his breaths as he rocked into me in that same ungodly fast and hard penetration of his cock in my aching hole.
I was both happy and sad about killing a bad man. And the sensation of having so much energy and dark magic pour into me.
The assassin brought his hands up, palms open as he let the heat of his hands run up the slope of my calves, a bitten off moan escaping the part of my mouth as Harry leaned his head forward and hovered the soft skin of his lips a breadth away from the front of my exposed right thigh, mocking and
I had let my hair down, the pale blonde strands streaming down to the middle of my spine now with how long it had gotten. I had Catia help me straighten my hair and makeup, creating a bit of black eyeliner with a smoky lid flecked in shimmering silver glitter to make the color of my moonstone eyes pop.
My body fell forward, the open palm of my hands smacking into the wall to catch myself as my breaths came out stunted and broken.
To my utter horror, I felt that tingling ball of warmth drop into the pit of my gut and thrum into my groin. I was getting turned on by Potter’s harsh words and the way the green hue of his eyes pulsed with its mingling stark red color as he bore his gaze into my own. Frowning up at him, I could sense my pulse quickening as my breaths came out faster, cock trapped between our bodies, pulsing with blood and heat.
The man’s movement was too quick for me to catch with my eyes, one second standing against the wall opposite from me and the next right in front of my frame. The magic had suddenly stilled in its motions around me when I gasped brokenly. Harry had pressed the side of his forearm along the wall right beside the left of my head, leaning in further and causing me to rear back at the ominous fervent air he gave away.
Harry’s free hand easily flipped the material of my skirt up over my bum to reveal the full pale, skin tone of my arsecheeks to the scorching ruby, emerald heated gaze of Harry’s eyes, and with a teasing tap of the assassin’s index finger at the upper right corner of my bum, the man murmured down to me with an almost predatory growl that seemed to coil dark and heavy around the fringes of my sanity. “Don’t tense up. I need you loose. I don’t want to shove my cock into this tight, virgin arse of yours for your first time and cause you to bleed. I’ll make you spill red when you want me to be the cruelty that I hold, but at the moment, I want to ease you into getting the rough fucking you deserve, need, as well as
Harry had a fine sheen of sweat that glided over his unblemished flesh, his tall body hunching like a predator stalking its next meal as he tried to get his breathing under control.
I’d have to get my arse into bloody gear right now. I could have a mental breakdown later from the clusterfuck that just happened.
I stared straight ahead at the man before me, eyes blanking on the way Hezian’s lips formed around one letter after the other in a stream of words that went through one of my ears and out the next with the muffled background sound of his voice.
And when Harry thrusted up so hard into me that I saw literal stars behind my eyelids, I jerked viscously beneath Harry’s weight, eyes widening and hips trembling. I couldn't even release a sound, only letting a large shudder rock my frame from the sensation.
I held back the sob that threatened to tear its way out of my working throat, my chest aching with the very knowledgeable fact that Harry most likely knew about my stupid crush for him and was taunting me for it.
Words were spewing out of my mouth now. “Uh … I’m not interested. I’m sorry. I’m here to look around and-”
I even attempted to fuck myself on the man’s cock but he only “tsk”ed me and tightened his one arm around my torso to keep myself from moving.
” Harry drawled out his low tone of a response, the muscles in his back shifting as the heat of his body soaked into my own, the strands my hair falling away from my low ponytail and curving around the frame of my cheekbones to caress the skin of Harry’s forehead as I breathed heavily down at him.
I was only on the first level of the mansion, finding myself kneeling across the marble floor of a large foyer that took up at least the size of three rooms of a regular sized house at most, the ceilings stretching on high for miles above my head as the walls around me were a rich, warm mahogany scheme like granite. To my left there was a another room that opened up into, most likely, the living room, and to my right, another opening to possibly the kitchen or dining room settled. But in this foyer, a set of staircases, huge and wide with each smooth stone step curling into a semicircle up to the second level of the mansion, was long and dark in its coal tinged color. The stairs had a set of levels, halfway to the top, there would be a space where a window resided to the right and then another set of stairs would start up again. That kind of setup happened at least three times before the steps reached the beginning of the second level.
I couldn’t believe the fucker was dumb enough not to suspect me trying to fight me way out of this mess once I gained enough power to do so.
I sucked in the bottom flesh of my lip, moving from one foot to the next as I felt a blush coat my cheeks at the image I was I seeing before me.
I instinctively slid my thighs around Harry’s tailored waist, my breaths creating short bursts that had my heart beating rapidly beneath my chest that I pressed firmly against the assassin’s hard one, our bodies pressing close as I inhaled his signature intoxicating scent like some half starved bird while I fumbled to wrap my arms around the back of Harry’s neck. Keening hiccups mewled out of my lips that I pressed against the side of the Erus’ long, strong neck, breathing him in as I rubbed the tip of my nose up and down the hot of his flesh, nuzzling my face into Harry’s neck.
The downy strands of his pale blonde hair was ruffled and in wonderfully chaotic display, the shimmering, pastel white glow of his hair reminding me of a dove’s feathers, all silken and fluffy in its appearance similar to a fall of clustered snowflakes, bright and alluring in its pure color.
I gave the redhead a sheepish grin in return, the heaviness of my exhaustion weighing down on me all of the sudden in a full load of weariness as I released a trembling sigh of fatigue.
His hair was chaotic with the unruly, pitch black, obsidian locks gleaming in the night’s moonshade as the tips of his disheveled strands licked away at his defined cheekbones and the harsh slope of his ticking jaw as he observed the way I started to sob out like a child that had been spanked over twenty times for their wrong doings.
Leaning my head down to catch the Gryffindor’s dark gaze with my own, I let my lips tip up into a taunting salacious smile when I let both my hands grip Harry’s wrists and lift them off of the chair so I could place the heat of his palms and fingers around the small of my waist.
I gave Hezian a small smile in return, seemingly awkward and shy now from having to be put under the man’s praise as he gazed at me like I was some sort of rare specimen.
Was this just going to be all pain without any pleasure the way I’ve imagined, fantasized and wanted throughout the years of my lonesome, pathetic, needy life?
The strong line of Harry’s jaw flexed abnormally tight, as if the muscles there were straining to combust at any given moment, the air surrounding the whole of the assassin’s frame cold and unflinchingly attentive.
I didn’t mind the sudden bursting touch of Harry’s flesh in and on mine for longer than a passing moment, how much I craved it rather than ran away from such an intimate prelude between the two of us.
I yelped out, surprised at the swooping sensation in the pit of my gut swindling down into my groin, making my cock throb
Well if this is a trap, I’ll be cutting someone today out of defense and if it wasn’t, then I was just a paranoid git.
If I could help innocent people from getting killed and being used as sex obects after their passing, I would, and this was a chance for me to do so.
The entire upper torso of Harry’s body was left bare to the world, the defined lines of his rows of lean abs practically reflecting off the light’s rays that spilled over the light bronze hue of his heated skin. The wide width of his shoulders were impeccable and ominous in the way they moved along with the calming breaths the Gryffindor took, rising and falling effortlessly. The long stretch of his powerful arms having been crossed lazily over his chest, muscles straining with the minute shifts he made, just made him all the more breathtaking to look at.
I took a wary step back, the intensity of Harry’s stare causing me to feel like I was being shredded apart. “
The Gryffindor took his other hand, now released from around my thighs, and took hold of my left knee in a grinding grip to easily pull apart my left leg from my right to cause my thighs to spread out in a whorish manner and leave me in a “spread eagle” position, my skirt fluttering over the hard line of my prick that stood up from between my open legs.
I was going to go through with this. And I didn’t have much hesitation about it considering what I heard about the heinous faction. There was enough turmoil in the wizard world what with the war and all. There didn’t need to be another big event that made the people fear about stepping out of their own homes.
The colors of its skin was pigmented into a shadowed black encasement, the arms as long and discombobulated as the twisted shape of its animalistic legs as the torso it carried seemed concave, like the creature itself was made up of a black hole ready to suck its very being into itself at any given moment.
Harry chuckled in dark amusement as he simply inhaled, my eyes taking in the way the smoke emitting from the potion wound it’s way in soft tendrils up Harry’s nostrils.
I often helped out the wizarding hospitals when I was in Hogwarts to further expand their medical supplies and potions for the sick or injured.
It was as if I was watching a live muggle movie, having paused it, and then started it back up again with a simple click of a remote.
Feigning offense, I placed the palm of my right hand over my heart and gave a heaving gasp of mocking shock, letting the end of the long sleeves of my sweater curl right into the left of my hand. I leaned down to stare Pansy in the eyes, matching her vexatious manners.
I almost wanted to cry at the open sincerity in Granger’s words and relaxed face, her kindness nice to feel after having everyone except Harry practically shun me.
The Gryffindor’s muscled lean torso expanded beneath his dirtied dark shirt, the tendons of his pecs and abs pressing deliciously against the fabric of his clothes as he shifted closer to my body while he let his other hand jerk me further over his lap in a smooth action.
And I had to stop myself from flailing around like an idiot in the face of Harry’s words by ignoring the man and giving a sudden smile out to the people looking on at both Harry and I in amusement as they waited for my words of exclamation from their surprise obviously.
There was no sign that Harry was aroused. His cock not hard, his breaths even and the black of his pupils a normal dilated formation.
Something about the atmosphere in the Gryffindors’ home made something that was usually tense and awkward inside of me unfurl from the pit of my stomach, letting me feel free to relax and not be so apprehensive or fearful of everything.
I didn’t like the thought of calling Sirius by his surname given the fact that I used to call my relative by a formal term when I couldn’t give two fucks about him from dealing with my own life and death situations. But now, I felt like I owed the man a familiarity between each other by calling him by his first name with the knowledge that I could start over with my family member and perhaps show him that I wasn’t the bitch that I made myself out to be when we first were introduced. The thought that I had at least one relative now when I thought I had no one anymore for the past few years, made me want to keep my cousin in hopes of feeling like I had a family, even small, again.
The onslaught of Harry’s handsome face was covered in a splay of shadows crossing over  the sharp, hard and defined lines of half of his features as he stared at me from the dark hoods of his illuminate red green eyes, the harsh rumble of his drawn out words echoing like a steady thrum within the hollow of my red hot ringing ears.
And I kept running with my feet treading through the ankle deep water, an exhilarated small smile slowly curving up at the sides of my mouth, heart pummeling loudly in my ears as adrenaline raced wildly through my veins and pumped heavy in my lungs.
I sucked in a sharp breath, my mind going haywire at the proposition Harry set up for both him and I.
My eyes, still unfocused with the dull throbbing ache in the back of my head, stared straight ahead, blurred imagery coming and going between a clear view and an obscured one as I took huge inhales of air so I could calm my adrenalized brain and body.
What’s outstanding is the fact that the food the Gryffindor made was like an orgasm in my damn mouth.
“What else are you not telling me, hm?” I said, voice dripping with caution as I leaned up a bit to catch Harry’s stare with my own.
My breathing had grown shallower as I stared down at the man that was practically dismantled across the cold floor, my eyes downcast as I ran my gaze down the broken limbs and twitches of the wizard’s deteriorating body.
My cock was about to burst as Harry pounded into me harder and quicker, the slap of his balls colliding against my bum a definite filthy sound that I didn’t want to stop hearing while it echoed throughout the room.
“P-Please Harry, hurr-” My voice cracked at the seams when I gave away a trembling scream from my throat, mouth hanging wide open when Harry shoved his hardened dick into my arse without a moment’s hesitation, cruel and daunting inside of my body.
My body was still the same as when I graduated from Hogwarts; slim and petite. I was at an average height with annoyingly long legs and and a small figure with some curves. My ass was rather perky and a little more plump than any other regular male initially. I was dainty and fragile looking with barely any muscles, my hips wide like a women’s. Pansy - when she was my friend back then- loved to pinch my ass whenever we hung out together to tease me. I hated her for making fun of how “cute” and “small” my figure was.
” Zereth murmured lowly into my right ear, the edges of their teeth scraping along the edge of my earlobe tauntingly.
I made a small sound of contentment in the back of my throat, my mouth pursing to let out a breath at the sensation of Harry’s arm curling more tightly around my waist to press me further onto him, his free hand coming up to softly run his long fingers into the strands of my messy sticky hair from our earlier proclivities.
“Draco! Are you even listening to me? For fucks sake. You love going off into whatever weird la la land that your brain conjures up.” Blaise’s offronted, outburst of words caused my body to jolt on the spot, a shock of awakening nerves popping off against every corner of my head to shake me from my hazed thought induced stupor.
A loud knock on my apartment door had me squealing out in a fit of fear induced surprise, my body jolting from its position as my arse bounced off of the backs of my legs and caused my breath to halt in my throat.
Sure, he’d have his moments of treating me like complete shite, but I’ll just have to throw more tantrums like the one I had just a few minutes ago, and get him to
That’s when I felt the flush of my clothed covered chest press languidly against the side of Harry’s lean and long muscled side, my body being cradled like I was some sort of three year old child against the assassin with such an ease that I had turned beet red at the position I found myself in.
Before I could lock my gaze with the intimidating Gryffindor’s, I whipped my head away, letting my body balance out once again to the rhythm of the song as I tried to keep my thoughts from straying towards the man in the middle of the room as the rioting beating of my heart doubled in time to the quickened pace of my breath.
Once I felt Harry’s body slowly ease in it’s tension after an hour of me humming to him softly out of pure affection and intention of calming the assassin down, I had started to run my fingers through the soft strands of his pitch black hair in a continuous stroke.
Why did he want me to declare that the man I saw was Potter so badly? This wasn’t how an Auror was supposed to act. And Kingsley didn’t even mention Potter up until now. Perhaps the man was waiting for me to say something about Potter?
The contours of my tousled hair dripped water over the clean marble floor as I pursed my lips at the smell I emitted.
Then Potter gave me no regard of his attention, turning his head around and carelessly going back to making the boy beneath him writhe about, Potter’s hands gripping over the boy's waist to bring his arse back to meet with each thrust Potter pushed forwards with such an easy tug of his wrists.
I nodded slowly, tilting my head back to stare up at Andrew from beneath my lashes as I clutched the envelope tightly in the palm of my hand and replied faintly to his words.
And despite the fact that I was disgusted at myself from loving the sensation of taking that man’s magic and life, I knew that I wouldn’t hesitate the next time around to do the same treatment to someone who needed it and deserved it.
“I know what you’re doing, Kitten. You’re already in need of a punishment, that you prevented in time, you’ll only make this worse for both you and I if you keep tempting me like the whore that you are, so stop
” Harry released a stuttered roughened groan as he released my throat only to give me a couple seconds to breathe until he was at it again, his body hunched over mine like some sort of animal ready to eat me, the enticingly eerie glow of his almost pitch black gaze boring holes into my shaking frame as he watched my eyes start to roll to the back of my head in bliss.
I frantically looked around at my surroundings, the room large and bare of nothing but cemented walls that gave way to no exit nor entrance, everything stamping a solidity in no escape for me whatsoever from this place.
The Assassin’s jaw ticked as he tilted his head while he rested his hand that had been on my ankle on my bare shin now. His fingers were soft, long, and hard as he ran them across the skin there, causing a shiver to race down my spine at the contact.
I guess Caetia isn’t exactly the purest person in the room if he was going around shaking his boy bits in front of everyone. And there was no judgment from myself whatsoever considering killing people with my own hands and magic was a lot more worse than stripping for others eyes, not that there was any problem in that sort of work anyway. I wish I had that much confidence in my body to let most of my skin show.
Trepidation and fear clouded the entirety of my chest then, anxiety flooding my system as my chest heaved with one panicked breath and the next, each inhale burning through my lungs as I tried to sucked in too much oxygen into my body all at once.
He tasted me with his lips and explored the caverns of my mouth with the wet flick of his hot tongue against my own, leaving me breathless and
Neville’s hair was always disheveled, hazel strands reminding me of chestnut and the magnetizing film of jasper, cut into shorter strands above his ears and longer at the top where his locks fell to the side and would caress the defined lines of his cheekbones and strong jaw that would catch anybody’s attention, lips curved provocatively. His hair was soft looking to the touch, all varying shades of rich brown.
Harry leaned back, emerald ruby colored eyes gazing at me as he eased off of my body to settle back against the couch, his features losing their usual harsh lines as he softened his face into a mask of calm patience while he waited for me to explain my reason behind my tantrum.
I visibly shuddered at the way Potter turned cruel in front of me, more so than he had been a few minutes ago, my breaths coming out quicker as warmth blanketed the whole of my trembling body.
“Fine, fine. But I swear you’d make a good stripper. Anyway, let’s get out of this room and go dancing!” Caetia’s enthusiastic words interrupted the cluster fuck of thoughts that ran amok in my head, causing me to nod dumbly in the brown haired boy’s direction absentmindedly as I tried  to hype myself up enough to actually go out and let loose for a little bit before having to go back to reality, find out what Harry was keeping from me, and have a mental breakdown.
Then the flesh of my bum and thigh was left absent from Harry’s touch, leaving me in a daze as I stared up at Harry with the flat of my back and weight upon the wall behind me and feeling cold without
My mouth was wide open as I took in every nuance of Harry’s abs flexing, the muscles in his arms contracting as he spread me even wider with his one hand tight around my right thigh and his other arm holding me up. I couldn’t take my eyes away from the way Harry cracked the narrow lines of his defined hips against my ass, his cock fucking me into his personal meat sock, turning me into a puppet that went along with his every command.
They didn’t make for a healthy looking couple, seeming awkward around one another once Hezian had Harry and I turn around as he redressed himself and the Asian woman in a good five minutes before telling the assassin and I to proceed with our meeting once we came in and saw them going at it like rabbits.
And I fucking hiccuped when I watched the deep pulsating blood red of Harry’s eyes shadow over into a burgundy hue within the jade that mixed together with the red while the man leaned his head down and brutally, without a given warning, shoved the apex of his muscled upper clothed thigh straight between the spread of my legs and against my groin and arse, slamming against the finger he had shoved into my hole with a rapacious, savage plunder.
I felt the air suddenly grow potentially cold and hot at the same time, a breezing burn that swept around the shivering of my figure as I was left bent over slightly with my trembling hands on my knees from the queasiness I could sense raking throughout my frame after throwing up all over the bloody floor and trying to keep myself from toppling over in my sickness.
“Well hello there, Draco Malfoy. It’s a surprise to see you wandering about here after so many years of having not seen a lick of you around,” The goblin, with a nametag on his pristine black suited vest spelling out "Kevera
The tendrils of my long hair caressed the assassin’s upturned face as he watched me with the sort of intensity that could kill someone, green red eyes pulsating as his free hand swooped down to grip my naked right thigh and spread me open
” Harry’s voice dropped into a sinister resonance, a violent tone trembling beneath the threatening fluctuation he emitted from the depth of his chest and throat.
I didn’t want to admit my concern for Weasley’s well being. Apparition apparatus was an older version of the regular teleportation technique, taking much more magic from the person wielding the spell. It also was a sort of teleportation spell that didn’t make someone feel the need to hurl like I did every time I was put through the quicker apparating spell. Instead of popping into the given destination, the spell shows the area you are supposed to walk into in the space that you are about to leave, like walking through a door to another room. It took a large amount of magic though and made people too loose limbed instead of nauseous, taking quite some time to actually get the spell up and going instead of the more widely known shorter way wizards used today for apparating.
I could make out the veins protruding from Harry’s exposed arm where he held the head, the sharp lines of his jaw tensing as the purple neon lighting washed over his intimidating, towering frame. Harry tilted his head down towards the upturned face of the man's shocked face looking up at him with such horrified stunted
Did Harry purposely put my wand out in the open like this for me to find and take it? Harry knew I'd be looking for places to hide. Perhaps he decided to put my wand in clear sight so I could have it back while I went in hiding?
I wasn’t going to do what Harry said. I was going to go to the Chamber downstairs when Harry was asleep or distracted long enough for me to have some fun once in a while. I also really wanted some ice cream tonight since that was what I had been craving for the past two days. Having some ice cream should keep me occupied for the rest of the day considering how I always put my sole focus on the damn delicacy whenever I eat it. And then tomorrow, when Harry thinks that I’m behaving, I’ll make my move to get the hell out of the room somehow.
Harry’s lips made a minute shift, so small that I swear I probably imagined the quick grin he let sprawl out over his handsome features before finishing my faded sentence for me, tone deep and foreboding and mocking. “They’ll smell your intact virginity, Malfoy.”
I just had to run into the Chosen One in the dark corners of a nightclub as he fucked my customer so hard that I wouldn’t be surprised if Trisko was in seventh heaven by the end of it.
Looking down at myself, I found my body magically held up three feet from the dirt covered floor, my arms brought up along with my wrists crossed over one another above my head, an invisible heated force making my limbs unable to move.
“You know you can sleep for a bit? The rug is pretty thick to sleep on and I can get you some blankets and a pillow. The food is always here for you to eat when you wake up. Harry will come by later and pick you up anyway. You look really tired,” Granger spoke out in a calming drawl, genuine concern etching across her striking feminine features as she observed me with her doe brown eyes.
If Harry and I were the only people moving, then that meant that Harry must have cast a spell that inquisitively stopped the time lapse of each individual person.
My hands jolted the slightest with the plan of raising them up on their own accord and having every intention of fisting the front material of Erus’ shirt to drag him bodily against the weak of my frame, but I only managed gasp out in surprise when the Gryffindor had moved too fast for me to react before I wanted to bring him to me.
have all these engravements on your body, which are old dark magic and demonic entrails as well as spells, because they have left them on you and are now coming forth because you got in touch with your own dark magic. These ruins appear on your body because you awakened them from simply indulging in the most darkest parts of your brain. I imagine that something talked to you in your head and it hurt because it was communicating with you through the mind. Your blood allows them to contact you because of the wizard and elf blood mixed in your system, it gives them a boost in their own magic by taking some of yours and feeding off of it enough to create a blood bond that grants them access to your mind. Your blood is what they like most. Those tattoos are remnants of every dark creature that has touched you without your knowing or your own body having soaked in some of their magic because, you too, get strength from it since you were born with dark magic in your blood and whenever there is dark magic in the same presence with one another, they tend to feed off on each other.” Harry’s voice was coming out in a fast rhythm now, as if speaking to himself as those brilliant eyes of his darkened while he forced himself into my proximity with a rushed pace, causing me to squeak out and take a staggering step back until my arse touched the counter of Harry’s kitchen, preventing my body from moving away from the assassin as he simply crowded me in further.
“C-can you move away now-” I yelped out when Harry murmured into my ear and with a swift action, snapped his hips forward to nestle the long, hard and large line of his cock between my arsecheeks and bring my front to collide with the counter
While my mind was in strife about what I was being forced to do, my magic was going haywire with the thought of having to finally take in someone else’s dark magic and energy life source for itself so it could grow stronger. Like a fucking animal.
Harry dug his fingers into my right arse cheek, so hard that I let out a sharp wheeze as he jostled me around and caused my skin to throb at the
They stood up, winding their shoulders around in a way to adjust their limbs as they got up to their full height with their massive body on display.
Harry Potter and Neville Longbottom stared right at me from where they lazed back against their wooden arm chairs.
The Carbonou shifted its haunches the tiniest bit, the movement quick on the uptake as it tilted the huge shape of its faceless head, a curious lilt that made the downturn of its elongated mouth point sideways and away from my face, the odd shape of its chest seizing up abruptly as its jaw unhinged even more.
And now that I was on familiar name terms with Hermione, I suppose I could stop calling Ron by Weasley and by his first name instead.
Glancing down towards the man who was practically dismantled by my own doing, I clicked my tongue, the mocking noise echoing around my still frame as I let my body come down from its adrenalized high, breath easing as my heart slowed its pace some, my mouth turning into a neutral line of indifference once again.
It came from Potter, who stood there with his face set into harsh lines as those eyes of his reflected nothing of his thoughts.
, I-I-I-!” My voice seemed to split in its whimpering pitch at the end of my proclamation, everything becoming too much for me to handle.
“I’m proud of you. I never really had a doubt you’d make the potion. And honestly, this was expected from a potions nerd like you,” Harry intoned lowly, the deep baritone of his voice flooding my system with tingling elation from hearing his words. I couldn’t help the way my neck warmed at the Assassin’s praise.
Harry was Romanian and Arabic, I remembered his ethnic background when we had to do a potions project back in Hogwarts when we were sixteen and had to create a potion that embodied our ethnicity and how we perceive ourselves. I overheard Granger’s surprised exclamation at Harry explaining to Weasley and her about his ethnic background in an attempt to figure out how to represent himself through a potion.
Staring up at the entrance, I gave a nod in assent to Harry’s words and he took that as a go ahead since the next thing I knew, I was being pushed up with an effortless shove that made my frame jolt and bounce up in fast succession.
I just stood quietly next to Harry as he bluntly responded to Hezian then. “Sorry, Cap’n. Draco had to wait for me to wake up from the potion he made to see if it worked, and low and behold, it did. I was out for a good two hours.”
The top the Gryffindor wore was made up of a charcoal colored tank that dipped low at the open sleeves on the sides to display the hard flesh of his corded, lean muscles. The shirt allowed Harry to reveal the long, sinuous power of his biceps, his collarbones displayed and making my cock twitch enthusiastically at the sight of the man. Harry also wore a dog tag around his neck, his skin more exposed than I’ve ever seen of it.
I’m supposed to protect you and you have to follow my orders or else you’ll get killed. Your life is on the line here and I’m not going to protect someone who doesn’t want it or constantly is trying getting himself killed. I’ll put you over my knee and spank that perky arse of yours red until you
I tapped the tip of my bare foot against the shimmering marble beneath me, the purse of my lips formed into an indifferent pout as impatience and anxiety flooded the whole of my system, a small tick in the line of my jaw visible in my reflection staring back at me.
The assassin's cigar pressed against the provocative curves of his mouth, the end of the object settling in the space the slight part of his lips created as my eyes dragged down the long line of his throat to observe the way his Adam’s apple bobbed the tiniest amount as he dragged a breath in, calm and collected, his body lazed away across the large expanse of his mattress.
With energy sizzling across the warmth of my flesh, I spoke through a decadent whisper that seemed to speak volumes in the tension strung tight around both Harry and I, my chest rising and falling with the harsh increments of my breaths pushing themselves passed my shaking, scared and excited lips. I stared into the shadow of Harry’s gleaming gaze, immersing myself in the looming figure of the man standing a silver of air in front of me, not quite
The thought of this demon raping me, it’s huge body trying to jam it’s way inside against my will and most likely killing me in the process, had made me give away a hushed compliance that made a deafening ringing in my ears buzz at my conformity to the demon’s demand.
The blood red color of his gaze dipped down the line of my body in a filthy trail at his dirty words, leaving me with heated goosebumps at the way the Gryffindor undressed me in front of him so shamelessly.
I gripped the fabric of the Gryffindor’'s shirt harder, tugging at the material and watching the way my knuckles strained a stark white against the onslaught of my skin with how tight of a grip I had on Harry’s shoulders, clawing my nails into his flesh and down the muscular jut of his shoulder blades as he towered over me and crowded the whole of my space.
I yelped out, air rushing out of my lungs as a bang thundered throughout my apartment, the sound harsh and blunt against my door frame.
I blew out a bated breath, chest heaving up as Harry’s unnervingly attentive red green eyes bore into my own while he let his hand trail up the knob of my knee and towards the wide expanse of my bare thighs in a slow scorching trek.
Harry broke into the man’s words of explanation, his voice deceptively calm and hinting beneath a tremulous threat in the harsh, deep murmur of his tone. “A white band that means he didn’t want to be propositioned nor partnered. Follow the rules. And you’re a wizard, you should sense the magic
Bringing my startled pale gaze over to the towering form of my cousin's standing in the entrance of my bathroom, I let the narrow of my eyes turn into harsh slits as I tried to gesticulate how annoyed I was at almost everything, especially the unwanted abrupt scare I just got. Sirius had on the same clothes from this morning, but his mussed hair was even more messy than before. “Next time please knock? I’d appreciate that a lot, thank you. And where were you this morning? I came out to eat breakfast to find that both you and Caetia weren’t even there.”
But I couldn’t help my thighs from spreading out as I bent at the waist and stuck my ass out against Harry’s face to wiggle it in a frenzy of heated delirium, pleasure building up inside of my chest and stomach swooping with flutters of chaotic electricity.
My sanity finally started to crack at the seams and this time, I couldn't quiet hold it in together.
I fell in step beside him, the soles of my feet crunching across the rotting leaves as I smelled the crisp scent of fresh, cool air, my skin lighting up with sensational energy at the given scent of the forest atmosphere coveting the whole of my person.
A chain hung from beside the light bulb, connecting into the ceiling as the iron tint glinted beneath the low light, my eyes following down the length of the chain to a dark red punching bag dangling from the end of the iron links. The bag was beaten and torn apart at its leather skin to show the tufts of its insides.
My knees were bent as my lower half was up held up in the air by Harry’s thighs, the curling of my hanging toes having no ground to touch but the warmed atmosphere surrounding us.
person ebbed away at the severity that I built inside myself and the calm facade that I crafted for others to see and cover up the true form of my vicious being.
I curled in on myself as the energy oozing out of Harry’s pores seemed to represent that of tar, turning into a thickened liquid like substance as its motion became an obscure rapid pace that my mind and eyes couldn’t catch.
Harry’s emerald gaze slid back over to mine as he regarded me with the intensity of his eyes. “I can’t specifically tell you the location of where we’re at for the sake of your safety, but I can tell you that we’re in Krum’s exclusive sex club.” His voice was leveled with barely any fluctuation within his low drawl.
Harry dug the blunt of his nails into the skin of my hips, grinding them into the jut of my bones cruelly enough to cause a sound of distress to leave my gaping mouth. It was as if Harry had been
“And am I here because I'm a threat, or am I here to be protected?” I spoke my words out into the quiet of the room, containing the urge to shuffle my feet awkwardly in an attempt to stave my nerves from rising higher and higher in the turmoil of my body.
I whined out in a needy fixation, my lips sliding over the assassin’s in a heated stroke as I let my teeth drag over Harry’s bottom lip to suckle it into my mouth like he was my drug addiction, biting on it in a kittenish nip that seemed to kick the Gryffindor in gear with the way he let out a deep groan mingled together with a feverish growl that shook the very foundations of my bones, causing my whole body to tremble beneath him.
My uttered words came out as a soft plead, unconsciously emitting from my vocal chords, a desperate edge to the frazzled sensations running amuck inside of my body at the press of Harry’s frame behind me.
It seemed the Carbonou reacted to my sound when it crowded in closer to my figure, shoving its massive frame into my personal space as it dragged my bottom lip down further, leaving my mouth open wide and the line of my bottom teeth scraping hesitantly across the flesh of its forehead.
The scent of Harry Potter and blood was evident and clear as I shifted over the Assassin’s shoulder and hissed venomous threats his way all the while I flailed my arms and legs about like some toddler throwing a tantrum, cheeks coated in a pink heated flush.
Instead of giving the Gryffindor the knock-out potion that I created, I had carelessly plucked out the potion settled next to it, which was the exact same color as the one I made, and had given it to Harry without a second’s thought.
The skin of his gut was flayed open, skin flaps moving about as my magic sank into the man’s stomach and up his chest, lighting him up from the inside-out like dynamite. I tried to calm my racing heart as steadily as I could, trying not to disrupt the flow of energy pouring out of my body and into the man’s as my magic did what I demanded it to.
I observed the handsome features of Harry’s face for a few silent moments as I chewed and swallowed my food, taking a deep breath as I tilted my head, happy that my hair had been pulled up into a messy bun to keep from getting any stray food crumbs from catching in my freshly showered hair.
“You don’t want me to get angry, so don’t start mouthing things off, Malfoy.” Potter threw the knife into the center of fake Kingsley’s back, the flick of his fingers sluicing the knife through the air with a flash of action that I couldn’t catch with my eyes. The motion too fast. He rose back up from his knelt form, Potter staring me down like I was a child caught watching porn for the first time. His voice had been set into a disturbingly calm low tremor, words a warning to my person when he spoke out to me.
And you’re in shock, you can barely move.” Harry’s only response to me was those simple words, blunt and monotonous as I stared up at him with a gape in my mouth, a flush creeping up my cheeks when the bastard started towards the front entrance of the club with long strides of his legs and trekked down the long tunnel that we had to walk through when we first got here.
yet open to the darkness that surrounds you and has festered inside of you since you were a child with that endearing curiosity you have. You survived in the best way you could and I admire that for what it is. You’re a contradiction of wrong and right and I want to completely burrow myself within you and dirty you up some more, make you go
Shaking my head profusely, I bit down on the plush flesh of my bottom lip, looking down at the dead man and back up to Harry’s encroaching figure as he neared me.
Grinding my teeth together to keep myself from whining out at the sight of Harry’s back muscles moving deliciously beneath his tank, I had to jog to catch up to Harry’s long strides with my own, the tips of my boots scuffing across the gravel walkway as I huffed out in my usual Malfoy manor.
Working my mouth over the warm flesh of the Gryffindor’s, I mindlessly spoke in incoherent words, my panic rising and falling in weird increments, mumbling to myself like the pathetic little thing that I had become, squeezing Harry to me as I felt him breathe steady and calmly against the width of my shaking chest.
The thing that caught my attention the most was the slanted glass walls that shown the city of Wisixi Podge and its glass buildings that towered at the height from which I stood and more. I’ve only been to this place once and that was when I was little when mother wanted to go and have a fancy dinner at one of the restaurants here with one of her rich friends.
How did others get to the other levels of the buildings? I didn’t see any other stairs or elevators for that matter.
I couldn’t help the way my lips turned up into a slow small sneer, the once relaxed prominence of my features shifting into that of displayed annoyance as I felt the lines of my cheekbones tense as the grinding halt of my teeth sluicing against one another in contained irritation went rigid, my eyes watching with calm disappointment at my game when the fucking character slut of a bitch, Peach, passed me by and won this racing round.
But I want you to feel it. I want you to soak in your loathe for me even though you don’t feel an ounce of it because I
Erus left out a soft breath as he gave me one last silent, assessing look before he slid his eyes slowly back over to Hezian who stood silent and compliant for once from watching the silent conversation the Chosen One and I just had.
My magic’s color looked something akin to lightning, the shades made up of blinding pure white mingling in together with the soft tint of amethyst, the mixture of purple and white combining repeatedly to pulsate like an energized ball of light that could blind someone.
I let out a soft hum, contemplative as it shook downy soft beneath the space of my chest, the sound reverberating throughout the entirety of my system. It took with it a sort of lazed purr that vibrated around the outer skin of my throat.
“Wh-why am I here? How do y-you know what I am? Wh-Who are you?” I whispered under a quivering voice.
Please leave any questions and comments you have. I love getting them. Thank you for all your guys' continuous support!
I held still as I tried to keep myself from flinching back at the cold breeze emitting from the huge man’s frame.
Hezian grinned from behind his desk, eyes roving over the whole of my face as he examined me openly.
Harry had reached out his hands to grip the underside plump flesh of my arse in a tight, biting grip, having enough leverage to easily lift me off of the floor, raising me up by my bum and dragging me towards his hard chest all the while.
Harry’s fingers dug into the meat of my asscheeks, his solid grip on them biting into the skin there hard enough to most likely leave some nasty bruises later while he spread me out even more with a pull on my cheeks in his heated hands. The dirty motion had my asshole twitching around Harry’s prodding tongue, causing my frame to tremble in his hands as he released a carnal snarl, shooting waves of vibrations through me at the sound.
Harry’s mouth formed into the first breathtaking, genuine smile I’ve ever seen him give away. Gorgeous in the way the jade and ruby shade of his eyes gleamed like crystals as an attractive dimple formed on the right side of his cheek, alluringly sexy. Breathtaking to uphold.
A shiver raced down my spine, quick and stunting, down the length of my back from the cold air surrounding me. My numbed fingers played with the fabric inside of my pockets, the slight clatter of my teeth rattling together echoing in the back of my skull like an incessant drum. I huddled in on myself even more in hopes to keep the cold from touching me any more than it already had.
“So I called you two up here because I wanted to discuss about having you two actually in on the operation of infiltrating Animadverto’s faction,” Hezian proclaimed, his next low words directed towards Harry as he looked straight at him from his seated position, “I want
But then a voice filtered throughout the whole of the kitchen, the familiar low tone of Hezian’s annoyingly low haughty voice echoing around both mine and Harry’s now stalk still figures, seeming to bounce off against the walls surrounding us. “Harry, we want Draco here to give us that money now. Also, we have a few other things to talk about, but they should be spoken of face to face and in the safety in one of the many buildings our company owns. Come to the ninth ward. I expect to see you a second after I hang up.” And the man did exactly that.
Various vehicles were parked through every imaginable space that the forest allowed around the mansion before us.
“Surprise,” Harry voiced in a confident rumbling drawl, a hint of dark bemusement tinting in his tone as he cocked his head, a smile dangling on the corner of his lips, slow and tauntingly sexy.
?” I nudged my head down to the dead body sprawled out at the bottom of my feet in front of me, my mouth pursing in consternation as I let my teeth subconsciously shove into my bottom lip to nibble on it in distress.
Harry stood only a millimeter away from my body, a sliver of air separating the two of us, the muscles in his jaw strained as he watched me with a focused intensity that contained everything crucial and assessing, his open observation on the state of my person perplexingly heated and coveting.
I started shaking my head back and forth, the first motion a tiny shift that I had trouble procuring upon my trembling figure only to ascend to a violent action that made the long strands of my hair whip around the hot of my cheeks.
If Draco was anywhere close by, my magic wanted to covet and swallow the boy whole because of how he was so interested in the bad of everything but was so
Shutting the gape of my mouth with a click of my teeth slamming together in an annoyed yet exhilarated countenance, I felt the beating of my heart kick up a notch as I replayed Harry’s words in my head.
Having found a hallway that had doors from 300 to 400, I figured the one I needed was hidden amongst it and started to make a quick trip down the stretch of the walkway, reading one door from the next as I quickly trailed by.
in my hands as I groaned out lowly in reprieve at the sight of the full on case of his vulnerability displayed before my hungry eyes. The sparkling wet of his long, pale lashes brushed at the flushed tips of his cheekbones, his breaths ragged as he started to spasm on the granite floor in little increments.
The possessive sounds Harry released was making my body quake in Sirius’ grip as my cousin tried to soothe my nervous, confounded heat of a mind with incoherent cooes of comfort, not talking but humming and grunting in a way to keep me calm.
” I couldn't believe the shite that was coming out of my mouth, so needy and slutty in their rich, crazed and half out of their wits, tone escaping the confounding moue of my mouth.
Everything seemed to stop there, only for a miniscule of a second, as the air from my lungs decided to leave me starved of its essence and my body was as still as a pole.
The room Harry apparated us to was one that was in a building that belonged to Arte et Marte. It was filled with a variety of already created potion assortments and many from their original forms to be tinkered with as well.
It was basically my dream to be working with potions and with a high pay wage as well. And the fact that I would be working with Harry if I were to be sent to do on-field missions made it all the better.
My heart pounded against my rib cage when the sound of Potter’s first name passing my lips caused his eyes to dart towards my stupefied body, a flash of pulsating red and jade darkening the varying shades of his eyes as the shadows pupils of his gaze seemed to shake within his pupils like they were spasming. My breath halted in my throat when I noticed the fast movements of his eyes, my mind making up the scenario that Potter had looked too quickly down at the nibbling of my teeth on my lips before looking back up. Maybe I conjured Potter’s actions up, the movement too fast for my human eyes to catch, but I held my frame as stiff as a board, my eyes wide in the face of Potter’s emotionless torment.
The boy was too nice for his own good. The complete opposite of me. It made me wary and too self conscious. Caetia was a good looking boy with striking features and a slim figure that wasn’t as curvy as mine and made him actually look appealing as a male while I resembled too much of an dainty person with the way my hips were too wide and my arse more plump than a regular male’s. He had a better personality than me even.
Then the black haired man let out a soft sigh, shoulders falling into a relaxed state as he rolled them back to loosen the stiff muscles there, lips set into a fine line now as he waved the arm that wasn’t around his boyfriend in my general direction. “I shall, I shall. But Draco, darling, please do cover up that large purple and blue hickey on the side of your neck. It’s distracting.”
The sloshing sound of Zereth’s opened guts sliding along the fumbling grasps of my fingers in a slippery slope made something inside of my head giddy with morbid fascination. My hands grappled at every wet intestine of the demon’s so I could pluck it out of them like it was child's play. I was toying with the bastard that was most likely dead by now what with how their heart was lying somewhere to my right on the floor in the midst of my murder spree.
Tilting my head up, my chin rose as I narrowed my eyes up at the blue eyed man, the line of my lips a heavy frown that I was sure shown the immense displeasure I felt with everything happening around me.
, I felt the tendrils of my unruly hair lick over the expanse of my bare shoulders and cheeks at the shaking motion of my head, side to side in a hurried, embarrassed focus with my breaths wheezing passed my lips while words spewed forth out of my mouth. “You don’t want this. This was a mistake-I-I’m not what you want. There’s nothing good about m-me. I-I’m useless and not someone who’s a-a-attracti-!” The last of my words were prevented by the sound of my own shout of exclamation when I felt Harry wrap the length of his strong, muscled forearm across the front of both my thighs to pull my wobbling limbs towards his knelt form above me and cause my arse to go even
All I could focus on at the moment was the fact that Harry wasn’t paying attention to my open display of flirtation with our boss. In fact, the assassin was nowhere to be found so his attention on me was nonexistent. I couldn’t find him in the span of the last two hours I went from one guest to the next in my attempt to get to Hezian so I could “talk” with him and make Harry jealous.
hell.” My breaths came out fast, my insecurities getting the best of me from showing so much of my body and skin, a panic settling high in the cluster of my throat as the notion of disappointing my mother from what I was wearing invaded my thoughts.
I gasped, Harry’s lips slotting against mine as my words were swallowed up by the Gryffindor, the slick warmth of his mouth moving so spontaneously smooth with mine that I turned into mush. I fell against Harry, his arm slotting around my waist as he dragged me across the ground on my weakened legs while he drew his muscled thigh between my already spread thighs, pushing against the hardening flesh of my prick.
They were closed toed shoes, black leather gleaming beneath the fluorescent lighting above my head. Obsidian colored thick lace started a few centimeters away from the tips of my toes and ran up into a criss cross formation to the very top of the shoes at the front, the hemline of the black leather reaching the middle of my shin.
with the incoherent murmurs of confused, heat laden words around Harry’s penetrating fingers within the access of my parted lips that were suckling, embarrassingly so, around the puncturing appendages as if my body had a mind of its own when it came to doing whatever Harry wanted from it.
A slow leisure of a smirk formed at Harry’'s lips when I started to continuously grind harder and faster against him, his finger pushing, pushing and
Granger’s hair was down, voluptuous curls lively as she shook her head at me with a grin forming on her pink glossed lips, voice coming out amused. “I’m glad to see you comfortable for once, although you did look cozy in that outfit at the club the other day.”
Okkkaayyyy, sorry it took so long for me to update! I've been busy with working and juggling many other stories so there's a lot on my plate at the moment. But! I finally got to updating Tenebrous, so whoop whoop!
Wisixi Podge was one of the most dangerous cities in the wizard world, cluttered with all sorts of supernatural beings that all tried to get along but most of the time failed doing so. The city was huge, a place that took solace a few miles away from Spinner’s End with its modern like buildings that towered and loomed. Werewolves, vampires, veelas, and a whole bunch of other creatures resided here. Wisixi wasn’t a poor place either, containing supernaturals of high riches who were worse than regular rogue creatures.
I had no want to drink, but rather, I needed to talk to an employee so I could ask about them having seen Albon around here. I’ve gone off and given thousands of manuscripts out to their original authors and most of the time, I had to ask around about where my customers were in whatever place they decided to reside in when they wanted their drafts back. It was always a mission to find my company’s customers.
I was shaking, the magic surrounding me heady with power and dominance, a darkness settling into the fast beating of my veins and making me suckle in the flesh of my bottom lip to keep myself from crying out at the abnormally ardent sensation.
Snickering beneath my breath, I sprinted towards the end of the alleyway, my heart thudding against my rib cage in time with the rapid breaths that released from my parted mouth as I all but ran out from between two close knit store houses and through another round of bustling, huddled folks. I jogged towards the large old tall black brick building looming over my figure.
My mind felt dizzied with a frenzy of the dark magic colliding into me, a prickling of life breathing itself into my small frame and causing my blood to thump in joy as I fed off of the wizard’s life and dark magic, soaking it in like it was the sun.
I'm sorry! I had to cut this chapter in half because it was so looonnnnggg. I felt like your minds' would have fried from the overload of stuff I dumped in my writing this week for Tenebrous, I surely was haha. So you'll get all that steamy good stuff in the next chapter, just give it time and you'll finally see the tension snap. I promise. I hope you liked this update though because it was so much fun to write and I had to put conflict in it so I can develop Harry and Draco's relationship between one another to a next level. Shit's going to go off in the next chapter and we're going to get all sinfully sexy and emotional too, mmm. Anyway, have a ball with this update! Next update will be on the 27th of June on a Wednesday due to wedding attending interruptions and my updating another one of my stories, so please be patient, you'll get it soon!
I grew up learning how to be anonymous to others around me, personally. I couldn’t shake off what I was taught to be. It's good that people learned to not fuck with me, but it gets boring when everyone around me is too scared to talk to me or have the balls to actually start a decent conversation.
“Now what can I do for you, Harry? It’s not everyday that I get to see you.” Viktor Krum spoke out to the right of my bent frame against the wall that I slumped over for support, his shadowed figure now coming into light as he stepped closer to both Harry and I.
I blinked down at Harry, a blush breaking out over my face as I did as I was told without a second of hesitation, starting towards the tired Gryffindor only to squeak out when Harry had snatched me up with his forearm coming around the small curve of my waist to quickly drag me down on top of him.
The soft plush of Potter’s mouth grazed the skin beneath my left ear as his hot breath whooshed over the flesh there and elicited my frame to shake like a leaf rustling in the wind as he spoke lowly into my ear. “Talk back to me again. Come on. Let’s see where it gets you.”
My blood would obnoxiously rush to my stiffening cock whenever Draco was near, heady with the need to mess the blonde up and get him to splutter about in his snappish attitude that I had grown so fond of over the years we’ve known each other.
Draco’s voice spoke out from beneath the barrage of the others’ speeches surrounding him, the sound of his quiet malleable words drifting down towards my person with a breathy rasp that reminded me of the sugary, soft yet sticky sensation of cotton candy, like walking straight into oceanic cool waters after striving through the desert without a drop of sweat to spare, refreshing and delightful to my ears. His voice was was soothing and addicting, exactly like his personality. And dark heat slipped down my spine at such succulent sounds escaping the moue of his sinful mouth.
The humanly deformed creature reminded me of disease, not having much of a face to its name and the pure carnal coming of death itself.
“Close your mouth before you catch flies.” Potter spoke again, a shiver racing over my skin at his voice and his intoxicating scent of cigar smoke and honey, the warmth radiating from his looming figure making my brain short circuit.
The assassin’s eyes widened a bit at the sudden burst of laughter that flooded out of my mouth as I hiccuped around stuttered breaths that threatened to clog my airway with my giddiness at having heard the words that just came out of the Gryffindor.
I had just noticed that I was shirtless, figuring that Harry had wandlessly banished my fucking shirt some time after he had just rimmed me.
“You’re such a prude, Malfoy. But it's cute. Anyway, Potter here is going to come with us shopping because two people protecting you is going to be better than one in case anything happens although I assure you I can handle things on my own.” Granger responded to my quick retort.
“No time to explain. We need to get out of here. I apparated Weasley, Granger, Sirius, and Caetia to a safe location so no one could trace their magic since they didn’t use the teleportation spell on themselves. You and I, we’re going to ride on out of here because there will be more coming for us if we don’t.” Harry’s voice was back to its normal husk, the low deep timbre lacking the bundle of almost demonic possession he contained a couple minutes ago, a smooth cadence to his tone that held that same lack of inflection and brutal calm within its sound.
I was no way in hell going to tell Kingsley that I drank some alcohol for my stress over having seen Potter and him fucking someone right in front of me because of having a crush on the Chosen One for years. That can stay out of my testimony. I didn’t have to say everything if I didn't want too. I had the power to remain silent and I can choose to keep quiet about Potter.
the harsh thud of Harry’s heart beat against his wide chest against my own, his warm, cigar smoke and peppermint breath, releasing from the confines of his provocative lips that stilled in their trek over the line of my collarbones as his fingers dug menacingly and impurely fascinatingly so into the flesh of my naked throat.
A myriad of thunderous thoughts barged against one another in the confines of my head, and despite the tremor I felt at the mere admission of Harry literally being the end of my existence if we were to get close to one another, physically, I was stuck like honey against flesh, on the way Harry had uttered his confession to liking me.
It didn’t help that they still stung and throbbed from the spanking I got before everything that happened.
The club went by the name of “The Red Covenant”, which was one of the top three clubs that resided in Europe, in secret like Viktor’s and hard to get in. Catia somehow had gotten his first job here and I had no idea how he did.
“Pl-please don’t do this-” I gasped out in confused panic, voice breaking off mid-beg as Zereth leaned it's head back to watch me with burning eyes while forming it’s teeth back to the normal human ones it once had and clicked it’s jaw back into place.
Sure, I knew I liked boys back then, thought of fucking into their arses, even done so, but Draco was a constant niggling sensation in the back of my head that shrouded my sanity more than it already had been that I didn’t want to give into. He was a permanent interest of mine compared to those who I fucked and easily discarded like chewed gum. But in the end, Draco was the only one I wanted.
Rampant thoughts were rushing through my mind now as I held the air in my lungs stiffly, causing my chest to ache as I attempted to not breathe for one second as fear caused my frame to become a prone figure.
Resisting the urge to roll my eyes and hurt Caetia’s feelings with any obvious rejection in the tense line of my back, I let out a breathy sigh. “Next time knock, that would do to get on my good side, Caetia. And Sirius, please don’t ever watch me sleep again, it’s creepy as hell, and it’s nice to know that you’re alive.” I mumbled the last of my words out into the still air around me, embarrassed in showing my relief on behalf of my cousin’s living presence.
I opened my mouth to speak, to explain, but Potter had to slide his gaze agonizingly slowly my way and render me speechless.
I let out a weak mewl, my thighs clenching together as my prick perked up in interest as blood rushed south then at Harry’s dark words, my magic practically
I was bent over a table, in front of Harry and Neville, with my arse practically sticking out and my body stretched out languidly in front of the two men.
The smell of sweat and blood and raw terror circulating around my senses had my heart thunder along with the harsh pulse of the blood that pumped hard and fast straight to my cock at the sheer delight in fine tuning the man’s pain even more.
In sexual terms, I loved giving the reins to someone else and being fucked within an inch of my life, I love taking cock and being manhandled. Took complete pleasure in it because I can be free of the mask I had to put on every day of my life, which is always stressing. But I have never let anyone have that sort of control over me since the men who fucked me because I haven’t had sex from that time and on. They didn’t give me the aftercare that I craved. And I feared letting anyone in to see me in such a vulnerable state again.
myself. Whether through drugs and alcohol or saving people’s lives throughout my whole life even if I didn’t want to, I forced myself to keep astray from the most deepest, malicious Stygian of my thoughts.
Harry was watching me made my cock threaten to rise beneath the onslaught of my tight boyshorts, chest shuddering out a trembling breath as I couldn’t help but bring my low lidded gaze up to meet the Assassin’s.
And when I whipped my eyes back up to Harry’s handsome face, I felt a visible shudder of a live wired spark flickering across the tip of my spine, all the way down to my tailbone, the assassin’s pulsating crimson gaze attached to my large eyes as he watched me from beneath his dark lashes and the strands of his unruly obsidian locks.
That information was enough for me to gain the courage to bring the pale of my eyes down to catch Harry’s dark gaze and let the next words out of my mouth sound out loud in the deafening silence of the frozen club, my heart ramming so profusely against my chest that I could hear it within the white noise of my reddened ears, my voice coming out in a soft whisper, a damnation that felt as of it set both Harry’s and my own world into a pitch black inferno we both couldn’t prevent for the life of us. “Stop holding back. You won’t kill me,
Opening my eyes, I let out a heavy gasp when I found Harry leaning over the kitchen island, his left elbow lying across the surface while his right was propped up to let the tight furl of his fist cater to the press of his strong chin lying over it, the mess of his pitch black hair falling over his eyes and revealing bits and pieces of the red and green shimmer of his unrelenting gaze.
But I knew I’d never call or get into contact with the guy in front of me. I could act nice though when I wanted to. “Right. Well, I guess I’ll take that proposition if I ever feel the need to do anything other than observe. Thank
“What’s going on with Draco? I left him for a minimum of a day, even told Granger to get him and bring him to a safe point.” I couldn’t help but let the incredulous tone in my voice from seeping out of my mouth in a drawl of internalized dark warning, the sound coming out in an internal threat to whatever it was that Draco got himself into or someone had gotten him into.
With the spread of my legs around Harry’s lower abdomen, my thighs clenched on instinct in an attempt to cover up the perk of my cock pressing insistently against the side of Harry’s hip. I couldn’t close my legs together though, given the mere fact that Harry’s body was literally situated between the open V of my thighs.
I didn’t protest against Sirius’ words this time, my mouth busy with my incessant chewing on my bottom lip as I stayed astonishingly silent since I had nothing much to say to my cousin’s warning that wouldn’t make him chastise me some more.
“And you know what else?” Harry’s voice carried a deceptively calm and heated pitch as he reached over with a smooth transition, both his arms coming up and distracting my stream of thoughts with the way the cords of Harry’s sinuous muscles in his arms became prominent as he flexed his strong limbs, veins protruding from the bronze of his flesh as he rested his hands on the counter I was currently forced against on either side of my hips, caging me in and taking away that one last slice of air between us as he shoved the front of his body against mine. “This means, if you want to, you can take my own magic if it decides to feed off of yours, but I wouldn’t suggest it because my magic makes me vomit at least twice a week because it’s too raw and if you try taking some of my magic, it won’t allow it. But, the thing is, since you’re part elf, that means your body is stronger than a normal wizard and whether female or male or both, your body accommodates to whatever creature that might want to fuck you. You elves, although stuck up and prudish, are quiet sluts. At one point, my magic will want to fuck you with almost all of what it has and your body is going to take it without me worrying about killing you because your dark magic will protect you from dying. My dark magic likes you enough to not kill you though. Knowing your a conduit for dark magic makes it love you even more and probably once in a while will feed off of you. And your dark magic is probably strong enough to hold it off if you practice with it. ”
my essence was so … untainted though, sooner or later, since the Gryffindor seemed to have his mind elsewhere at the moment.
The bank looked like it always had ever since I first arrived here with Lucius when I was younger, all marbled opal floors with the gleam of golden pillars carrying the high ceilings as the halls stretched on for miles on end and vaults lining the side of the walls surrounding both Harry and I as we walked to the front desk.
I yelped when I caught sight of Harry’s fingers twitching around the heart in his hand for a brief second only to watch a moment later how it burst at the seams and flooded through his fingers like poisoned water as its gushed meaty tissue dribbled from the Assassin’s now empty hands, splattering in clunks of its pieces of flesh like a wet towel thunking onto solid ground.
I let said game console separate from the clutch of my right hand to dangle about in my left one, causing the device to swing in a soft motion back and forth as I moved it to and fro in a subconscious act. The purse of my lips shaped around a small sounding “tsk” that escaped my mouth as I tilted my head to the side to give Blaise a disapproving appraisal, the tendrils of the silver snow white kissed shade of my long hair brushing across the slender of my shoulders in a sweeping feather light caress at my subtle action.
Why did my parents keep that shite from me? They were both dead anyway, so I couldn’t exactly ask them why they did what they did.
My head whipped back, hair askew from my ponytail as my neck arched to slam the back of my skull into the space between Harry’s left shoulder and neck. I tried to gain control of the heavy breaths that were punched out of my lips, thankful that Harry had conjured up lube inside of my arsehole just before he decided to ram into me with the strength of a bull,  making me shudder from the immediate intrusion.
Sorry it's been a while since I've posted a chapter for this story, but I've been busy with work and all and travelling too. This chapter is very informational and amusing at times, so hopefully you guys enjoy it as much I did writing it! Thank you for the patience, support and love for this story, it means the world to me.
Turning around a sharp corner, I let myself fall into an abrupt run, feeling the jostle of my satchel punch against the side of my hip bone with each lift of my leg from once I saw that barely anyone was on this part of the alley.
Kikue raised his left arm off of Harry to raise his hand in an obvious gesture for a handshake that I wanted to sneer and bite at in retaliation. Harry’s gaze had finally slid off of the Japanese boy to raise the glow of his crimson jaded eyes towards me.
of the assassin’s cruel grip on me. The prompt flex of Harry’s fingers around my arse caused my words to come to a stop. “You’re so nervous, Kitten. Where is all that sass? You know you did something wrong, hmm? I’ve told you many times to never disobey me, but you just had to didn’t you? Wanted my attention so bad that you went out of your way to make me come for you and make me
that it came from the red liquid of my now prone fingers and the skin of my arse where Harry kept inhumanely smacking my cheeks with too much of an impact, but I liked is
The sound clawed up into my head in a slow trek that was irritatingly violent but sustainable enough to not create a harsh disturbance mentally and physically within myself.
you, feel, or even be near you. I can’t fucking stand the sight of you and your selfish, manipulative and emotionless face! Let go, let go letgoletgoletgo!” My voice came out in angered hysteria, the strands of my hair in disarray and whipping across the pale of my cheeks as I shook my head back and forth like some deranged psychopath as I threw a
was loud and echoing in the hollows of my ears as my stomach roiled with a dipping sensation that went in either direction, as if all of my organs were being scrambled around while my head and eyes blurred for a vehement moment.
I still wanted to know about what Harry and Krum were talking about to have the Chosen One become harsher than he normally was all of the sudden. But then the subject of BDSM flooded my senses and my my mouth dropped only a little to let out a rush of exalted air, a warmth tangling itself around my waist and playfully flicking at the dip of my hip bones.
The counsel didn’t say anything about branding my flesh though. I had thought about telling someone about this weird mark upon my body but the thing hadn’t done anything harmful to me or to others so I figured I’d keep this tidbit of information to myself.
My head snapped up, eyes zoning un on a person that I couldn’t recognize, the energy inside of my body seeming to scramble my brains up in a viscous energetic stream that had my mind spiralling into a bottomless pit of confusion, hunger for power and blinding rage.
I was beginning to have a … life again and that revelation almost had tears gathering in the corners of my eyes.
I had red glitter speckled across the naked flesh of my body, the creamy pale of my skin a stark contrast with the colors. I wore a laced black corset that stopped just above my belly button, squeezing in on the sides of my waist to show the curves of my petite frame and the jut of my sharp hip bones. The corset was made up of sheer fabric that had intricate designs all around its shape, the breast part creating a heart shape at the top to make it seem like I had a chest like a woman’s even though I was male. The panties I had on were black but lacy as well, although the groin area was covered of course with extra fabric beneath. It curved around my arse in a way that made my cheeks look even more plump than they usually were while they rode low on my hips.
My face was set aflame at the position I found myself in, words getting caught in my throat when I tried to push off the wall to get Potter away from me, his closeness making me feel like I was going to explode.
The assassin’s body was a picture of immaculate strength and nonchalant severity that brought about a sense of leisure dormancy. Something that made me feel a dark exhilaration.
I released a pleased hum from my mouth then, my fingers still cupping the back of Harry’s head as I fiddled with the obsidian strands of his hair. I looked up at the Gryffindor, tipping my head back since the man was so goddamn tall.
My lips were left slightly agape as I flicked the slippery appendage of my tongue around the wet flesh of the insides of my cheeks, resisting the urge to bite down on my bottom lip in shameful embarrassment while heat spread up my chest and over the space of my cheeks. “U-Uhm, Harry actually made me wear th-this.” The stutter releasing its way from my throat came out in a mere whisper, resounding against the pastel pink walls around me to bash right back into my frame as if mocking my very existence for the slip of nerves shown through the sound of my anxious and merely mortified voice.
my drool gather up behind my mouth to threaten to spill over my lips, but I kept my mouth stubbornly shut and ripped my gaze away from Harry’s taunting grin while I looked over towards Weasley.
If the demon so much as tried to look into my thoughts, I’ll just have my own magic build a wall and create a fabrication of thoughts that weren’t really mine, just so I can trick the demon into thinking that I was going to obey it’s every word.
Flicking my tongue out over my bottom lip, I spoke out between a tone of cautious calmness, well, at least I tried to with the slight tremor that etched itself in my words as I looked into Harry’s dark intent gaze. “Harry, I need you to breathe in and out as slowly as you can. I know you feel a … ‘desire’ to fuck like your life depended on it, so remember where you are and who you’re with-”
I couldn’t stop the manic smile from curving up on the sides of my lips, my chest vibrating with the breaths increasing in their rhythm in my lungs at the fact that I was going to get out of this boring, yet gorgeous, guest room so I could sneak into the Chamber and have a miniature freak out session on my once in a lifetime indulgence for my certain kinks.
Long claw tips were sharpened into a similar state of a blade, shining beneath the low fluorescent lighting of the room in the dark of its color, a gleaming of black steel it seemed. The claws represented the creature’s harsh tipped teeth as its snout was formed into that of a snarling wolf but more elongated and tipped down as if the animal’s features came out of the muggle worlds black plague when the doctors wore those unsettling masks.
Chewing on the insides of my cheeks, I shook my head profusely to ward off any incoming images of Potter’s hot tongue running along the shining red of his dagger to taste someone’s blood with a calm demeanor, those long dark lashes of his brushing against the sharp lines of his cheekbones as he hummed around the liquid flooding his mouth.
The teleportation doorway started to open up into the length of an oval shape, towering above Weasley's already too tall frame and expanding a good few meters out from the sides, energy a blue sparking haze around the static edges of the circle.
I was at a loss for words, trying to make my brain process this man’s question and how, for the past ten or so minutes, that I’ve been flirted with by two people now? That’s not normal. This never happens to me.
The room was swathed in strobe lights that were fixated around a dark theme of a deep wine red, reflecting a cherry color from the rich mahogany floors and the soft looking leather loveseats and couches strewn about around the perimeter of the area, the intricate swirls of smoke casting high in a mystified countenance up around the tall ceilings creating a beautifully haunting modern look.
Gasping out in pain, I blinked up at the rage pinched across the solace of Kikue’s face, his brown eyes turning a shade darker as he brought the right of his open palm hand up and above his head in a rushed movement and tried to bring it down over the side of my left cheek, but my gaze caught sight of the action in time to bring both my hands up from my sides and off the floor to smack them into the middle of Kikue’s chest, causing him to fall backwards with a huff of air leaving his gaping mouth.
The demon only gave me one meal a day and it was barely anything. I had to go to the bathroom in the corner of the room without any toilet. I was allowed to cleanse the area when Zereth would be back so the place was clean save for the blood staining the damn walls that Zereth creepily wanted to keep as some weird momentum. I’ve been endlessly using a cleansing charm on myself to keep myself clean too.
my spine curving abnormally into a more bowed shape while the Gryffindor’s dick drilled into me with a burning
Right now, this was a similar circumstance. I was being forced to kill someone in exchange to keep myself alive.
it. I wanted someone to actually care about me for once and surely Harry didn’t give two fucks about me since he didn’t follow me after I abruptly left him with his fucktoy downstairs. I wasn’t someone who liked showing weakness in front of others, especially to those I barely knew but I haven’t had anyone to talk to for years after my parents' deaths and it was sort of an odd, invading and unnerving sensation from having someone genuinely be concerned about me.
With a sharp nod, I blew out a heavy breath from the purse of my mouth, running my tongue over the plump of my bottom lip, easily bending down at the waist as I shoved off my combat boots and slipped on the high heels, wobbling a bit from side to side as I tried to keep my balance in tact from standing on one leg to the next.
Zereth had dropped me down from my suspension with the chains and demanded I kill the innocent man and take his energy.
Ask for it. Scream for it. Be the whore that you want to be for me, Princess, or else this ends here and I’ll leave you
I couldn’t help but flash a cheeky grin towards the two men when I saw Neville and Harry tip backwards from their chairs in quick succession as my wandless magic pushed itself against the legs of their seats.
I was always on my guard, and my body couldn’t help but feel coiled like a leather rope ready to unfurl and snap at any given potential movement and threat. I only relaxed around Draco.
Since childhood, having to grow up in a household where my own family pitted against me through verbal and physical abuse, I learned that nothing well came out of anything. I was careful, I learned how to keep myself from others, to stay inside of the worn down onyx walls that was self created within my head. I knew how to trick people into thinking that I’d do what they want to find myself doing the complete opposite. My family told me to do one thing, I’d act like I would do their bidding and do terrible things with their knowledge completely oblivious the next. I did drugs, every shade of them, throughout my Hogwarts school years and when I was forced to come home to that shite hole. I’d use my magic to do what I wanted and hid the traces it would leave so the Ministry of Magic wouldn’t come for me. I often did wandless spells and chants if I needed it to survive through my stay at my aunt’s because she sure as hell wouldn’t help me with food and the necessities to live.
I didn't get the chance to grab a coat to cover myself up, which made me turn red from being watched by a large amount of both muggles and wizards.
Potter rose his brows up at me, a gesture that looked absurdly handsome on him as he tilted his head, the tufts of his black hair brushing across the sharp high of his cheekbones and over the chartreuse of his eyes. “Take off your coat. Don’t make me say it again, Malfoy.”
Potter. What’s the meaning of t-t-this!” I was frantic in his hands, not used to having people randomly touch me so intimately, my mind swirling from the fast events happening around me and to me.
They were heavily muscled, the stretch of their back heaving with strength as their large biceps and triceps seemed to tense whenever the creature-like human breathed softly. Their head was knelt, tendrils of long onyx colored hair obscuring their face, the strands a dark curtain falling over their head in an almost silky looking drapery.
When Hermione came back with the most fluffiest white blanket I’ve ever seen, I didn’t hesitate to grab it from her outstretched hands and the equally downy soft pillows that she had folded up beneath her other arm.
It was exhausting having to be on my tippy toes all the time and keeping control of my emotions for my fear of ending up in the same situation I was in with the Dark Lord and my parents. I could give two fucks about what most of anyone thought of me and I did what I wanted most of the time, but no one had any right into knowing who I really was like beneath my cold attitude.
Feeling significantly bratty and hot and bothered, I tried to cover up the indecency my body procured upon itself from simply watching Potter by raising my chin up and glaring at the knelt head of the Gryffindor as he undid the gloves from his other hand. “Why should I listen to you when you don’t even acknowledge my presence?”
Granger sighed into her husband’s embrace, the sound making my thoughts scatter as I focused my attention on the two Gryffindors in front of me. “I would invite you to come with us to our friend gathering tonight but honestly you look like you’re going to pass out anytime and you need to rest.”
I’ve never attempted at tempting someone, hell, I felt too self conscious and not really good looking enough to do such a thing what with being shunned my whole life and not being looked twice at. But I wanted Harry’s touch, wanted to feel the
The sleeves of Harry’s shirt were pushed past his shoulders, dangling in the crooks of his elbows with his torso exposed to the air. Lean muscles on display and a powerful body coiled with tension.
managed to pilfer, strayed among flapping gums of shadows stretching across tight creases from within my stubborn mouth, mind slack, draining their essence of pulsating reverence that seemed to become stripped
With the air struggling to get passed my parted lips, I looked back over to Potter who had let his head tip the slightest bit to the side, the black gleam of his tousled hair falling over his glowing eyes that peered into the very core of my soul, tearing me apart and flaying my skin alive for his gaze only.
The heels of my shoes clicked beneath the thrum of the music around me, scraping across the granite floor of the area as my stomps ricocheted in the hum of my ears while I barged my way over to Harry and Kikue, my breaths coming out faster and faster as the beating of my heart went up a notch or two in the rhythm department.
Snapping my gaze back up to my fellow housemate, I blinked rapidly, trying to regain the topic at hand that Blaise had been talking about before I completely zoned out on the damn Slytherin.
The Assassin had woken up at the time I predicted my potion would, in exactly two hours after it hit Harry. After scrambling out from beneath Harry when a good few minutes passed of just petting the man’s hair softly, my body had started to ache and I couldn’t stay under him anymore.
” Harry ground out, as if he was talking between his teeth. I didn’t have the strength to make a retort.
me. With no answers and more confused than I’ve ever been. He also left me with a hard cock and a throbbing, hurt chest from the man’s jabs at my person.
I want to thank every one of my readers for showing so much support and love and patience with me throughout this story. You all will never understand the deep seated gratitude and appreciation for all of your encouragement and having gone on this chaotically fun ride with me as I wrote this story.
Letting the right of my fingers rise up, I pressed the soft pads of my appendages brush lightly down the smooth, sharp line of Harry’s jawline, tracing the defined curve lightly with a shaky breath escaping my parted mouth, feeling the ache in my chest filter through the whole of my body at the way Harry held himself rigid, the glow of his eyes casting down to the ground as he let a sliver of hurt sluice across the usually cold blank of his expression for the briefest of moments, his dark brows furrowing like a tremble in his calmness.
Pansy and I both jolted on the spot, my body stilling in a sort of instinctual action whenever there was sudden disruption to my surroundings.
Wrenching my eyes back up to Harry, the Gryffindor’s eyes were slipped shut, a look of tranquility etched across his handsome features as his jaw flexed in the grinding of the very meager tension there, the only sign of the slight rigidity he held.
The entirety of my frame started to shake now as a burning lodge in my throat started to bubble and turn into an iron ball. The acidic taste of bile rising up my throat with whatever remnants of substances left inside of me spewed up my stomach, through my throat, and out of my mouth to splatter across the dead man’s body as I upchucked.
“I-I was going to say, thank you f-for making me y-yours, Erus.” I breathed out my words in a tiny sob, words spluttering out of my lungs practically when Harry rocked his hips forward in a motion oh so similar to the many times he had fucked me, with my face down and arse up.
The assassin, to my surprise, turned the hard of his cheek into the palm of my hand, the tensed lines in his tall, strong body going somewhat relaxed as his chest rose up with a quiet inhale and the cords of his muscles contracted along with his abs while he released the air he held in his lungs slowly.
The assassin before me shown no discouraged appearance, gaze shuttering off any insight into whatever he was feeling as I tried to understand what had just happened between us. I could have sworn Harry was hard against me, or perhaps I was just conjuring up mentally deranged scenarios out of a happening that I
My bottom lip was trembling as I breathed harshly up at Potter, groaning out in dismay and hurt when Potter wouldn’t fucking let me go and only twitched the curl of his steel like fingers around my wrist to dig into the skin and bone even more. With a single flex of Potter’s hand, I was forced to tumble and smack my front against Potter’s chest.
Making sure Draco couldn’t escape from his position beneath me, I withdrew my hips, cock squelching out an obscene sound that made the pretty blush on Princess’ cheeks grow crimson, to snap my lower half forward, my prick intruding through Draco’s body like a violation that the Slytherin so naively permitted.
It’s either I cared enough, not enough, or none at all when it came to disturbing subjects, at least what’s “disturbing” to me at the moment or to others. We all have different morality perspectives, mine was obscured and of course I knew I wasn’t the only one with such horrid thoughts but I was one of those that fell into step with my demons and walked alongside or in front of them, right out in the open for everyone’s eyes to see.
Panic and warmed anticipation burned down the line of my dry throat as I swallowed around a lump of anxiety, embarrassment clouding my senses as I seemed to have now noticed the levity of Harry going back to stage, knowing damn well that people out in the crowd were watching this debacle as I writhed in frustrated affrontation over the Chosen One’s shoulder.
I scrunched up my nose as I turned my body fully towards him, stomping my booted feet on the ground with determination. My lips curled up at the corners to give the Gryffindor a sneer, face contorting with hushed anger to hide my embarrassment from getting so easily played by Harry.
Walking in heels was hard, every other second or so my knees would buckle if I tilted my feet to the sides in an awkward angle in my fast pace of a walk through the bundle of people gyrating and fucking each other across the expanse of the floor. The distinct smell of musk and sweat mingled in through my senses and caused my heart to hammer wildly beneath my chest at the fact that I was in a room where sex was the main purpose of it.
Jutting out my bottom lip, I let my gaze follow the sensation of eyes watching over my lying frame, dragging my attention over to the open doorway of my room to startle at the sight of a familiar man that, up until now, I assumed was dead.
Just from hearing Potter’s voice caused a violent reaction from my body even though I was in a bad situation right now.
Neither was Sirius and Caetia, because those two weren’t using their magic and they weren’t talking either. I assumed Harry used some sort of spell as well as Sirius to keep the sounds of mine, Caetia’s and their own voices unheard when we were talking right before reaching the top of the stairs. But I didn’t sense it.
I sobbed like a child, crying out in agonized abandon as I hiccuped around my panic and disbelief, in war with my mind and body as I tried to gain a semblance of morality and dignity back. I was breaking and I couldn’t stop myself from doing so.
Releasing my bottom lip immediately, I gave the whole room an uncanny curl of my mouth and tipped my head back to stick my nose up in the air, my eyes narrowed into a cold glare.
I couldn’t help the way my fingers went loose around the envelope, my brain malfunctioning at the image of my hands, frantic and wanton, running through Potter’s dark locks as he rammed his prick into my arse, brutal and hard and rough-
“I also wanted to ask you this before we went to see Hezian,” Harry said, voice dropping significantly as he softened his hold on my ass and deftly stopped pressing his fingers repeatedly into my head to run them through my long strands, blood red gaze now watching me.
Now with my hair down and falling into its messy, silvered strands that brushed my shoulders, I stood directly in front of the door to the foyer that connected to the living, mine, and Harry’s guestrooms.
Waving my hand in a soft flicker of my fingers that were occupied within the guy’s guts, I mindlessly conjured up my combative knife, the black handle a cold steel comfortable grip beneath the loose curl of my hand.
Hearing Blaise praise Pansy for her attire, rather crudely and expectedly so, the low tone of his voice perked up louder, echoing around the quiet of the room as he spoke out to me then, causing my head to turn back towards the now calm couple with Pansy standing close to Blaise as the man’s arm was found wrapped around her small waist. “You look like a cupcake, Draco. Cute.”
It seems that the outfit didn't do much help in making me blend in with the crowd if I was being observed to openly and quickly.
Potter's head knelt the slightest bit, glowing emerald eyes peering down at one of his best friends as he silently took in Granger’s quiet words. His gaze was distant, a dark hue of blood red that pulsated with a feverish warmth that left me dumb struck, the lean muscled frame of his body emitting a confidence that was both overpowering and alluring.
I yelled out in a broken sob when Harry crooked his middle finger inside of me and swirled as well as flicked the warmed appendage against the convulsing flex of my inner walls, nudging the point of his finger against something that made my whole body implode in on itself with shocking roils of fire and delirious arousal.
My instinct got the best of me and I sneered right back at the cold man, the stupid need to talk back at the vampire for saying those things overriding any logical thought of mine. “Better clean your teeth first before propositioning someone to be your blood bag. No ones want an unhygienic vampire tool that will give them some disease.” My words came out clipped and toneless.
My gaze settled over to the way Harry took the right hand of his off from beneath his chin to run the long, strong lengths of his fingers through the tufts of his unruly strands, messing up the Stygian locks and causing the smooth sheen to reflect the fluorescent light’s rays, the wafting, heady scent of his body coveting me whole.
Giving the man a slow shake of my head, I let out a puff of steamy air into the cold atmosphere, fingernails scratching against the skin of my palm as I kept my gaze fixated on the pale man before me. “I don’t understand.”
If I remember correctly, Chang had dated Harry for a little bit back in our early years of Hogwarts, and Harry had broken things off.
I tossed the little suitcase into Hezian’s awaiting hand and watched him put the tiny object into the pocket of his trousers.
I kept completely still as Harry continued with his words, the illuminate shade of his eyes capturing my own as I tried to breathe evenly and keep myself in check in the face of my hazarding thoughts from trying to find out what was going on and keeping myself in check with Harry so damn close.
