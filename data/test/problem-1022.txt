So I hope you enjoy!
“It’ll be alright Harry, my mother will love you,” for a moment Harry looked hopeful, “well after she’s done interrogating you,” and Harry faked sobbed into his hands he smiled between his fingers at hearing the two laugh.
Peeking out the front door Harry was relieved that the neighborhood was quiet, most neighbors were very ritualistic and came home right around dinner time so Harry knew that not many people would see him leave.
“What makes you think I’d be a good distraction to test Harry’s wandless skills,” Draco growled, and Conner seemed unphased by the bitterness.

He, Neville and Luna were chatting in the Room of Requirement late one Thursday evening while Draco and Blaise had Prefect duties and Hermione holed herself up in the library. He hadn’t seen much of her since their last conversation at the start of the new term. Whenever he did see her, she was very tight lipped about what she was working on, he stopped pressing her for information and figured that when she was ready to talk, she’d find him.
“We must go Harry,” came the cry as Harry watched in alarm as an Inferius near him began to scream and melt.
“Why were you able to speak in tongue when you found me earlier,” blinking, Harry was thrown from his train of thought as he remembered earlier.
Harry, Draco, Blaise, and their mixed group of friends were sitting in the courtyard after lunch taking advantage of a late evening exam when Professor Flitwick approached them.
Maybe, just maybe, Draco was better off without him as a mate.
“Severus, I wouldn’t let him come alone,” Harry gaped, he hadn’t expected that.
to each other?!” whatever concern that had subsided reared back up and he had taken two steps towards the entrance with Blaise hot on his trail.
Stroking the side of his face with his uninjured hand Harry watched as Draco seemed to fight to wake up. It was a few more minutes before the blonde’s eyes started to open and Harry was able to see the stunning silver orbs once more.
“This is a memory stone. It acts very similar to a Pensive but without allowing to viewer to step into a memory it enables them to feel the emotion of the person’s memory,” Harry gaped, this was an impressive piece of magical work, “Unlike a Pensive you won’t be able to add additional memories too it, so after you cast
Snickering, he could only imagine their reaction to his decision to flee; Hermione would have lectured him until she was blue in the face while Ron would have been undermining her and giving him the thumbs up.
Harry had fallen asleep tucked in Draco’s arms once more having thoroughly enjoyed the day and the two he had spent it with. While they hadn’t talked much more about his heir dilemma, he had spent quite some time reading books about what it meant to be an heir.
“Weasley bastard, I can’t believe he threw a punch,” the butterflies that had settled in his stomach fluttered around and Harry squirmed underneath Malfoy’s concerned gaze.
“Why are you up so early anyways?”
“Ravenclaw has so many different house clubs! Professor Flitwick only allows for two signups per student after a seventh year signed up for all of them and had to spend a week at Saint Mungos after their magical core got too low!” Hermione gushed as she began to list off what was offered.
They talked for a bit more before finally heading out of the Room of Requirement. The halls were quiet as it was nearing curfew for the evening and as he and Luna were about to part ways a flash of red hair caught his attention. Turning, he watched as Ginny gave him a startled look and hurried away in the opposite direction.
“Well he caught me coming back from Dumbledore’s office alone and said that despite my ‘celebrity status,’” mimicking the Professor’s tone, Harry rolled his eyes, “I have detention with him Friday night,” jutting out his lip in a small pout it took Draco peeling his eyes away from the alluring lip to completely understand what Harry had said.
As Harry’s anger vanished, the quill dropped.
But I found some motivation and inspiration and got the story back on track without compromising the plot line.
Spinning, Harry beamed.
It had taken all a second for Draco to react and the blonde’s hand found themselves around Harry’s waist and his fingertips were gently massaging the hem of Harry’s pants.
“What is he doing here?! Draco get away from him!” the shout came and Draco’s grip on him got tighter.
“I apologize for this Harry, I wish that you could have a normal life, but in order to bring peace to the wizarding world, Voldemort has to be defeated,” Harry nodded numbly, this was a lot to take in, even for a sixteen year old.
After two minutes had passed and nothing more had appeared Harry started to believe that he wasn’t Riddle’s heir, and after another three minutes, Harry started to move to stand.
“Harry!” spinning around Harry found his arms full of a his small blonde Ravenclaw friend who was decked in her unusual attire.
x.x.x.x.x
Draco hummed but didn’t press for more information which Harry appreciated. The two parted ways as Harry’s clocked ticked to eleven at night.
He had lost his job at Grunnings; the drill company had been making cuts and despite how long he’d work there they had cut him and others to save their bottom line. He had spent the afternoon at the local tavern, coming home piss drunk and angry. Dudley had whined for the newest toy and Vernon had snapped. Petunia’s screeches of anger were still ringing in his ears.
Getting up from where the group was seated Harry walked towards the enormous book. Flipping it open Harry turned the pages until he got to the ‘H’ section. Running his finger down the list of topics he wasn’t too surprised that Horcrux wasn’t listed.
x.x.x.x.x
Silence.
“What? Why not? You should at least go once before graduation,” Draco prodded, Harry glared.
Harry watched as Draco shot off multiple
“What happened?” tossing on his shirt and grateful that Draco turned around so he could put his bottoms on Harry went to the sink to brush his teeth.
“You will be known as Voldemort,” and Harry clenched his eyes tight as he felt once more like he was being transported.
No points had been assigned so far; McGonagall wasn’t one to reward students for doing what was expected.
“I believe we’ll have to research the best possible way to destroy the ring, I found it at a cave and attempted to destroy it but alas, nothing worked, perhaps if you and Missus Granger worked together you both could come up with a solution,” Dumbledore rambled on and Harry barely made out the words as his fingertips just barely skimmed the metal.
“Well, well, well Potter,” the blonde teased, and Harry pushed his shoulder, squeaking slightly as his arms were caught up and his lips captured with teasing lips.
“I won’t be sharing with anyone?” As the two headed towards one end of the common room, the other side was for the girls, Harry was intrigued.
“Thanks Malfoy,” the blonde nodded, and Harry didn’t miss the arrogant look Zabini had sent them.
“Was this what you had expected?” he asked, slightly upset at what transpired, yet no one had been hurt or hauled off and out of the manor.
“Harry!” opening his arms for the expectant hug Harry chuckled as Esmelda tucked herself into Harry’s arms. Since the incident she had grown more attached to him than anyone had during his time at Hogwarts.
For the next hour Harry told her everything, from being resorted into Slytherin to befriending Blaise, he told her about his fallout with Ron and how Hermione and his friends had been supportive of him. Once she seemed to relax, he felt more at ease opening to her. He opted to not tell her anything about his dreams or being Riddle’s heir but told her of the special things Draco had done for him; she seemed to puff up as he praised her only child.
“What the actual fuck, Draco, no. No, I don’t want a relationship with Murphy; I don’t like him you arrogant, self-center prat!” grateful for the empty hallway Harry took a step forward, glancing up at the heated eyes.
Harry didn’t have much time to process the mystery when two students sat down in front of him and pinned him with a dual stare. Harry recognized them as the Beaters from the Slytherin team.
“I should hate you for putting my child in such a dangerous position, I should be furious at my son for endangering his life in such a way, but,” licking her lips her eyes unfocused for a second as if remembering something, “young love,” she said, and with that she directed him out of the room and to where the guest was waiting.
x.x.x.x.x
Not seeing either of the first years where they were earlier Harry shrugged and left the common room.
“Anderson was with Esmelda when they were first attacked, they got separated, he might be stunned,” Harry wheezed, if the boy was stunned, it could be harder to track him, Blaise looked thoughtful.
Snapping, he flashed Harry a big grin.
“Ah, Harry my boy, I’m happy to see you’re in good health,” there was an underlying emotion laced in his words that caught Harry off-guard, it was as if the Headmaster was disappointed.
” He watched as Conner let the spell hit him and the older boy burst into laughter, he explained at the last session that certain spells he would let through to see the strength behind them.
“What happened Harry,” she hissed.
When Harry had explained to Blaise where he had been and why he thought Draco had collapsed and fallen during the Quidditch match the Prefect had been a mixed bag of emotions. He had been furious at Harry’s decision to go somewhere with Dumbledore without telling anyone and even more annoyed that because of his decision his best friend was lying in the hospital wing.
“Let’s go Potter,” the teasing tone wasn’t missed and Harry felt his ears burn that he’d been caught ogling the taller boy, it had been happening more lately and Harry admitted to himself that he was curious about things more than kissing.
“Aren’t as close? You left me Harry, you left Ron, you left everyone in Gryffindor, all for the slimy, Death Eater snakes that will likely hand you over to You-Know-Who, you’ve befriended people who would rather watch you die,” she hissed out and Harry felt the stirrings of his magic underneath his fingertips, a book shifted on a nearby shelf.
The group chatted for a few more minutes before both the Head Boy and Girl announced that they were headed to the Great Hall. Harry watched as Pansy sulked back to Nott when Draco had ignored her in favor with talking with him and Blaise.
Murphy walked to the other side of the oval and faced towards Harry, immediately the room stilled.
“ ---and I mean even though they were betrothed to each other the terms were to be canceled if Draco had ever found his mate,” Harry turned sharply.
Note: Thank you for all the reviews and follows, it truly warms my heart. A lighter chapter for you as the what comes next gets very dark. Enjoy!
“It gave me no indication what had warranted such a decision, was there anything mentioned to you?” the pit of unease grew, and Harry licked his lips.
“I’m not sure, but when I know, I’ll tell you – I promise,” Harry said hoping that Draco wouldn’t ask for more information, the blonde didn’t.
Draco didn’t seem to think much of it, that Harry was invited, regardless of what his parents said of the matter, and neither did Harry until he realized that he didn’t know what to get the blonde.
The days leading up to September first rushed by and Harry found himself sad that he would be leaving the small town of Flagley. Mister Spaulding took him to dinner his last night after Harry had purchased every book that he had read and those that the owner had shipped in. The man had tried to refuse but Harry had been stubborn, he finally convinced the man by explaining that he had a few Ravenclaw friends that would enjoy something new to read.
” Harry was prepared and didn’t move, he had told Draco he suspected that Tom would try to kill him, and the blonde couldn’t do anything; a zing of fear shot through the blonde and Harry grit his teeth together.
“I’ll show you to your room,” Harry’s frustration from the sorting, his encounter with Snape, and the tension he felt from being near people who hated him deflated at the mention of his own room.
“If you go home for the Easter holidays, then you can find a way to meet with him,” Neville said, and Harry rubbed his chin at the idea.
Till we read again!
Arriving to the Hospital Wing Harry would have made some comment about his return if he had the energy to do so. There were a few other students recuperating as it had been a rough year for the flu, though as the group went to the few empty beds those students had sat up to get a better look at what was going on.
“Are you ready Mister Potter?” he looked up and flushed as he realized that they had stopped and the Zabini’s were looking at him expectantly, Blaise’s mother held out her hand that had a relatively small rock on the palm of it. Touching a finger to it, he shot Blaise a grin as the taller boy wrapped an arm around him knowing full well that he didn’t want Harry to get lost in transit.
“Your mate caused for you to suffer; this is nonsense! If your mate is willing to put you in such a predicament, she’s not worthy of the Malfoy name,” the Malfoy patriarch snapped, and Harry felt his heart break in two.
his arm movement was jerky, and the chair came flying towards him, moving to the side he had to avoid the chair and the incoming spell. He had wanted to the object to intercept it, but the spell hadn’t gone the way he intended.
Snape caught the movement and Harry shrugged, “I feel, magic?”
As the group trekked back to the castle Harry had just started to head down to the dungeons when Snape appeared, black eyes staring at him disapprovingly and Harry could only imagine what his head of house wanted.
“That could work, they might know something, we could also seek out the Founder’s portraits and ask them what they know,” it was Blaise’s look that caught Harry’s attention.
“Potter, Potter,
“I need your help Professor,” he said softly, and the man rolled his eyes before motioning for him to enter.
“Then how do you explain his injury after he was resorted?” she hissed, and Harry could feel Draco rear back and he groaned under his breath.
“Thank you Eckle,” tears welled in the house elf’s eyes and there was another pop as the elf disappeared.
“No idea, the were wearing masks,” Harry hesitated, “it looked like the masks the Death Eaters wear,” the tension thickened immediately as Hermione’s lips tightened.
“Your father?” confusion swept over Blaise’s features and Harry grimaced as Draco’s anger spiked once more.
“I asked Blaise to meet up with me to go over anything I missed due to my absence,” Harry’s face dropped at the mention of the other boy.
“Hey Harry,” looking over his shoulder Harry was surprised to see Dean standing a few feet away from him, gesturing his head in greeting Harry eyed the other boy warily.
“I’ve never seen a student display magic like you did this evening, I could feel the power behind your spells. How far along are you with your wandless skills?” Harry fumbled; he hadn’t been prepared that anyone would have figured out this secret.
WARNING – some very light
“Are you okay?” Draco gave a half-hearted shrug.
Suddenly blonde hair appeared from one of the doors and Harry stood there agape.
Sleep didn’t come easily to Harry that night.
“And? What do I do about Tom and getting him reunited with the pieces of his soul?” Salazar hummed.
“Groups are to challenge the student yet place them with others that are still are on the same magical level,” Murphy held up his wand.
“You seem happier Harry, especially after we last saw each other,” Luna said softly. Memories of Sirius dying flashed before him and Harry felt a pit of guilt settle in his stomach as he realized that only for a brief time he’d thought of his godfather while in Flagley.
“We’ll have to Apparate from here Harry,” furrowing his brows Dumbledore caught onto his confusion.
“Already chummy with the Slytherin’s Potter?” Ron snapped at him and Harry felt his anger bubble, they had been best friends for five years, gone through countless adventures together, and it seemed as if Ron willing to throw it all away.
“A Veela’s mate is their main priority, Potter. Even if you declined the bond, I couldn’t fight you, I wouldn’t be able to let anyone hurt you,” Harry’s eyes narrowed.
Everything between the three seemed to fall back into place and if it were possible it seemed as they bonded even more. After filling Draco in with what Hermione had researched the blonde was equally as stunned and surprised as he and Blaise had been when they originally found it.
“Draco, he isn’t suitable to be your mate, you were injured because of him!” Draco had finally loosened his grasp on him, and Harry watched as he turned, Veela eyes prominently on display for parents.
His body shivered as the crisp air whipped around him as they left the manor and he cursed himself for not grabbing a jacket, he truthfully hadn’t expected to need it. If his discomfort was noticeable Missus Malfoy didn’t acknowledge it.
As Harry finished telling the most recent development, how the Horcrux that he had brought to Tom had merged with him Salazar finally lost his temper.
He pouted, but before he could pull his lip back in Draco appeared beside him and pressed his mouth against his ear, “Be careful with that lip Harry,” the blonde purred and Harry flushed.
Sensing the reluctance Draco rolled his eyes and pulled his smaller mate inside. Wiping the last remnants of sleep from his eye he stretched his arms above his head and Harry briefly saw his exposed skin and his very firm stomach muscles; flushing he quickly diverted his eyes.
It was memories of being with Draco that flooded his mind as he calmly said the Patronus’ incantation and a silver stream flowed out of his wand before his father’s Animagus form appeared in front of him. It pranced around the room and it was then that Harry realized he had an audience as the common room had gone silent and stared in awe at what he had conjured.
“Ickkle little Potter, my, my, my, come to turn yourself in to the Dark Lord?” her eyes shot to the man seated at the front and she scowled.
Ron would have known what to do, Harry thought, and he longed for his best friend.
“What happened Harry?”
A house elf had appeared with an assortment of food and Harry could barely process what had been served as his stomach was clenched with nerves and he couldn’t even relax as Draco rubbed his knuckles attempting to soothe him.
A tugging at his arm had him glancing towards a smiling Luna.
“Are you going to be okay to take the final exams?” Neville looked at him, biting the inside of his cheek as Harry bobbed his head.
Taking comfort in his dream Harry sought out the garden to clear his mind. It was a beautiful garden filled with numerous plants; some that were harmful and others Harry recognized from the Muggle world. Sitting underneath a willow tree he brought his knees up to his chin and wrapped his arms around his legs and stared expressionlessly at his surroundings.
They didn’t deserve the inevitable war that was coming, no one did.
“Let’s get them back to the common room,” as Blaise took Esmelda’s hand the girl let out a choked sob as she turned back towards Harry, the teen could only assume that she felt safest with him.
was absorbed into the shield.
“What could you possibly need my help with?” he drawled; Draco turned towards Harry.
and then his date of birth.
“I, I fund Slythrin’s book, for – for,” he panted, feeling helpless as Draco ushered him back into bed, “Horx, takes nngy to read,” he sighed and leaned into Draco’s hand that started to caress his head.
“Veela’s love their families, Mister Potter. A Veela takes a lot of pride in their children, just as much as they have for their mate, Draco is everything to Lucius,” her voice was void of the anger that had been there a second earlier and still rooted to his spot, Harry didn’t know what to say.
Leading them to one of the smaller sitting rooms she motioned for them to sit across from her, Draco still clutching to his smaller mate. Merope fussed with her own outfit as she looked at the two with something akin to envy.
If it was a Slytherin that was attacking them they would know the hallways better than himself, but if it wasn’t, Harry could have the upper hand.
“Are you okay?” Harry breathed; each word weighed heavy on his chest.
Sighing, Harry proceeded to concentrate his magic into reading Parseltongue.
Licking his lips, he looked once at Blaise then back towards Hermione.
There were only light touches along sensitive skin before sharp raps at the door had them pulling apart. Blaise appeared as Draco opened the door, dark eyes skimming him with concern.
“He offered to help me Tuesday nights,” Draco stopped, and it was a few steps before Harry turned around and Draco’s face was blank, but Harry saw how his jaw was tense and cheeks sunk in.
Hermione shot him a look and Harry gave her a weak grin realizing that he must have made a sound in his mental protest.
“I apologize that I haven’t seen you since our discussion in the Hospital Wing, how are you faring Harry?” appreciating the sincerity Harry felt his shoulder’s drop.
The man’s eyes flickered upwards then back down to the page he was on.
“Tell us more about your dreams, Harry.”
I can understand that may be triggering to some, having a kid myself even writing about the idea of losing a child makes me uncomfortable.
Casting a
“There is nothing, nothing going on between Draco and Astoria, I promise you,” Harry held back the scathing retort and turned back towards where his dorm room was. He didn’t want to deal with this right now.
“No, Potter, I’m not worried, Blaise and I have rounds tomorrow after dinner and Blaise can cover for me as I go into the forest and get the flower,” Blaise hummed as Harry frowned.
Harry had to hide his grin as they left the room but sent his companions an impressed look, this could work.
“It was fine, we corrected some of the issues that were caught in the last match and we should be ready for the match before winter break,” Harry nodded as if on autopilot.
Draco glanced down at her coolly, “Pansy, it’s been a busy year,” but before he could say anything more, she wrapped her arm around his and leaned her head against his shoulder batting her eyelashes at him.
“Guys, guys, guys,” they listened for three minutes at his consecutive knocks before Harry pushed aside his mate and snickered at the undignified moan coming from the Malfoy heir.
It was quiet in the halls and Harry wasn’t too surprised to see some Ravenclaws headed for the library, what for, Harry didn’t know.
“Whoops, sorry Mister Evans, my mother always said that I talk too much to guests, but I can’t help it! If you need anything I’ll be at the front desk, enjoy your stay!” Harry waved goodbye and relished at the silence that met him as he opened the door.
Draco chuckled and pulled back, his Veela eyes still in place and Harry reached out to rub his thumb against Draco’s cheekbone.
Draco’s father tilted his head to the side, annoyance turning to suspicion as he motioned for the two to sit.
“Nott?!” out of anyone, Nott was the last person Harry expected.
It was over an hour of weaving in and out of traffic that they had arrived, and Harry had convinced himself that at one point the bus had apparated from one point to the next. With the screech of the bus halting Harry peered out the window to a small town.
“I’ve already told my Mother that I won’t be home for the holidays and while she and,” he shuddered, “her new boyfriend are sad I won’t be there to join them on vacation, I’d rather be here, helping figure this out,” Harry looked up shyly at Draco who was quiet.
“Let’s go Draco you know that he won’t let up,” suppressing a laugh at the blonde’s huff Harry watched with amusement as the Veela ripped open the door and glared at the cheeky smile on his best friend’s face.
Harry felt like he was Apparating yet going through the Floo system at the same time. It was like nothing he had experienced before and when everything stopped spinning, he opened his eyes.
It was a week before he was to head back to Hogwarts that he had his first sighting of someone that he knew. He was at his regular table in the bookstore and from where he was sitting, he could see out the front windows at the passerby’s, at one point he looked up and his stomached dropped. Across the street was a family that Harry knew all too well, the family trait of platinum blonde hair stuck out and while they weren’t coming near him, the Malfoy’s were in the vicinity.
“Have fun,” laughing as Blaise howled Harry watched with mild entertainment as most of the house headed out the entrance.
Loosening his tie around his neck he made quick work of wrapping it around the blonde’s mouth, not too tight, but just enough so that Draco’s sultry voice stopped distracting him. Silver eye’s darkened and it was Harry’s turn to smirk.
“Slept great mother,” Blaise responded, and Harry shook his head in agreement.
“I can’t imagine that it would be easy,” voiced Neville from his spot next to Luna; Harry had glanced towards Hermione, but she was too engrossed in her discussion with Blaise to have heard him.
“Wow,” he took note at Lady Zabini’s longing look and the crestfallen expression that passed over Blaise’s features.
“I’m Eckle, Mister Potter,” Harry smiled.
“It’s been okay, most everyone ignores me,” stroking his beard Dumbledore approached a cabinet filled with vials.
What felt like hours yet was only a few minutes later by the slight shift on the clock nearest to him Tom walked unsteadily towards the fireplace.
It was silent as they walked into the room, both Mister and Missus Malfoy were in the same spot yet in new clothing, as he and Draco walked closer their eyes darted to them; a brief flash of annoyance came over Draco’s father while his mother looked pleased to see her son.
Rushing over to the Restricted Section’s index of topics Harry made quick work of flipping to the last part of the ‘H’ section.
“Wait, what’s a
It shouldn’t have surprised Harry that amongst everything that Dumbledore requested him.
The remainder of the night was uneventful, and the three boys arrived back to common room ready to go to bed. A few seventh years were milling about but there was a pleasant silence blanketing the room. As Harry stopped in front of his door, he looked up to Draco who had a very thoughtful look on his face, but before he could ask what was wrong, Draco spoke.
“This is nothing Draco, you have not fully bonded, you know that your Veela can find someone else, anyone else and you’ll survive,” biting the inside of his cheek Harry tasted blood on his tongue, Draco hissed and Missus Malfoy’s eyes flickered from her son to her mate with worry ebbed deep in her blue orbs.
Tom’s eyes were void of his thoughts as he looked towards the other man standing nearby.
“You must press them for information, build up their trust, provide them a safe place to talk with you and for them to open up,” Harry felt nauseated, this man didn’t care about any of the Slytherins, to him, these students were means of gathering information.
It was strange after months of dreaming to have a night where he dreamed of nothing, waking up Harry felt groggy and his mouth was drier than the ever. Groping for his glasses on the table next to him Harry looked around, the students that were there the following night were gone as well as both Anderson and Esmelda, and by the look of the light streaming through the windows it was well into the afternoon.
“So does Tom believe you?” Harry hesitated, memories of the Horcrux bonding with Tom hours before.
“Explain Potter, because if I can’t kill you, I’d be happy to kill your companions,” there was a lack of heat behind Tom’s words and Harry had a feeling that the man was more talk then anything.
“Being nice to the house elf’s already,” came a drawl and Harry turned back towards his mate, grinning at the sight of the bite and scratch marks along Draco’s chest.
The two figures stalked towards him and the worry in the back of his mind intensified, but Harry’s only thought was that he needed to protect Esmelda. As their wands raised Harry concentrated hard on his magic. Facing his hand downward he exhaled.
Both walked unhurriedly towards the dungeons when Hermione rushed up to them. She was carrying a stack of books and her shoulders were pushed back, she immediately saw Harry’s red-rimmed eyes and her smile morphed into a frown.
“He’s the heir to my family name and to his father’s,” Harry’s breath caught in his throat.
Draco shifted and Harry realized that whatever he felt was strong enough that Draco had felt it too.
Draco had wanted to join him, but it didn’t take a mind-reader, or their bond, to know that the blonde was one of the many who wanted to study. Harry had offered to stay, knowing it would put the Veela at ease, but the blonde had quickly disagreed reminding that Harry that he was entitled to do what he wanted without feeling obliged to alter his plans to placate him.
“Tom, Tom, I need you to listen to me,” Harry’s eyes left the ring as he watched Dumbledore shift so he was looking down at the young man who was gasping for breath and twitching, the blood was still trickling out of him as his eyes seemed to be having trouble focusing.
“I don’t trust you Malfoy, you’ve been awful since our first year at Hogwarts and I don’t know what you’ve said or done to convince Harry that you’ve changed but I’m not buying it, it wouldn’t surprise me if you’ve convinced Harry –“ she was about to continue when Draco roared and made to move towards the witch.
“We’ll face off in a dual with one another with a five minute time limit,” he nodded towards the two other seventh years on the side, “they’ll be keeping track of spells that are used and marking down any other notes, once the time is up we decide what group you’ll be placed in,” Harry nodded, it made sense.
“Interesting, it was Rowena’s idea to give the Sorting Hat the option to resort students though it was only once something triggered it,” that confused Harry further, he didn’t know what could have triggered the Sorting Hat into resorting the students.
“What happened,” Snape’s voice was laced with anger as he took in the distraught look of both Esmelda and Anderson and his black eye’s narrowed when he saw Harry’s bloodied body.
Harry let out a watery chuckle at the snake’s attempt at comfort having never met the girl.
“No, this is just how the Zabini manor has always been. Though, each manor may have something different when accepting a new person,” he said with a shrug.
“Draco, I,” there was a moment of vulnerability that Draco picked up on and visibly the Prefect’s temper simmered.
As his thoughts trailed to the older woman Harry felt an uncomfortable sensation wash over him as he didn’t immediately spot her upon his arrival; she was normally nearby waiting for him.
“Giving away all our secrets, you’re no better than the scum on the dungeon floor,” sighing, Harry turned, resting his hand on his wand on the inside of his bag.
Tossing the apple into the trash he looked in the living room where his Uncle was still hunched over on the chair, deciding it was best if he left everything as it was he made his way into the ever so small cupboard under the stairs angling his body as best as he could so the pain was minimal but he was still able to get some sleep.
That was all that was in Hogwarts about Horcruxes and Harry was more confused. Tom couldn’t have got his information from the text because this information would have given him nothing to go on.
“I’ll find a way to get all of you back to your spot,” he said, determination lacing his words, and she beamed.
There was a ring sitting on a table off to the edge of the room. There looked to be other items as well, but Harry couldn’t tear his eyes away from the ring. It was the ring that Dumbledore had placed on his desk back in his office, the ring that he had reached out to touch.
Slowly Tom extended his own hand, and as their hands clasped in a handshake the magic in the room swirled around them, the locket had left Tom’s possession and hovered in front of him. Harry could feel Tom’s magic from their grasp and as the locket glowed green Harry felt the same pull in the cave when he had freed the locket from the basin.
“Fascinating, I’m not surprised that Tom thought of such a thing seeing as he is a descendent of Salazar Slytherin himself,” the man mused as Harry fiddled with the hem of his robe.
Harry could feel a trickle of sweat drip down the back of his neck, dueling was exhilarating but none of the spells shot from either side were hitting the target.
Without uttering a word his Uncle grabbed his upper arm and dragged him out of the cupboard, wiggling against the grasp Harry had only a moment to wonder what would happen before he was tossed into the living room, landing heavily on the end table effectively smashing the vase, the table, and possibly a rib or two.
“Sort of, I needed to use his Floo and reach out to my Mother to get a particular book from the manor,” Harry turned towards him alarmed.
“Ah, well, young love, what an exciting time,” Harry sensed an underlying bitter tone and for a moment a flash of sadness shone on Dumbledore’s face.
“Ready Harry?” Blaise stood near the entrance of the common room near a few hyped up fifth years and Harry gave him an embarrassed grin.
“I need to talk to you guys,” he whispered urgently, enough time had passed that students were making their way towards dinner and Dumbledore’s speech.
“I’m not sending my mate, alone, to meet with him. You better than anyone else should understand how this is sitting with my Veela side,” Harry looked up at Draco to see that his eyes had shifted color, Mister Malfoy had noticed it too.
“You would be correct Tom, I’m not your child, I’m, well, I’m your brother,” Tom looked at him as if he had transformed into some rare beast.
A moment later Draco pulled back and Harry couldn’t control the moan that escaped his lips. He didn’t know what he wanted, but he knew that he wanted more of it.
“They were helping me find the Redback spider Professor, I recalled from class that it’s a common spider that could be found and I was hoping to find it somewhere in the dungeons,” Blaise said, looking up earnestly at the Professor who had narrowed his eyes, seemingly weighing the truth of his words.
“Draco, no one knew this was going to happen,” Harry tried to reassure the Veela but the blonde wasn’t convinced.
“Yeah, I took uh,” he squinted as if trying to picture what the vial said, “something to fight off infection?” Draco hummed.
“Mister Potter, Mister Malfoy, and Mister Zabini, wandering the halls this close to curfew, is there any explanation for this?” his tone sounded like he knew what they were up too but Harry couldn’t imagine how that was possible, he had checked the Marauder’s Map frequently to ensure they hadn’t been followed.
When he had told his friends about the locket and how it was obtained the group was distraught, especially Hermione, who was still unsure that the Headmaster’s loyalties lied elsewhere. Neville had confided with the group that his Gran, while she adored the Headmaster, had always been skeptical of the man and Luna had declared that her loyalties were to her friends, because they were that, her friends.
“I’m not sure Harry, it’s hard to believe Dumbledore is capable of something like this, we have to figure out why he did it without asking him or alerting anyone to what’s going on,” Harry nodded his agreement.
“I’m sorry Blaise dear, but your letters were extremely cryptic, what am I to assume?” she teased her son lightly and Blaise sighed.
“Draco, no, Draco,
Dumbledore absentmindedly stroked his beard and looked at Harry with interest.
“Was, was that from Tom?” Blaise looked horrified at the thought and Harry peered up at his mate, unsure if explaining what had happened would upset the Veela.
“Well, everything aside, I hope it goes well,” there was a flicker of uncertainty that crossed Blaise’s face and worry surged through him and Draco huffed.
Scooching over so that they were next to one another Harry bumped his knee into Draco’s. A bump back, and then another, followed by the next, had the two boy’s grinning. Harry couldn’t remember the last time that he had this much fun. If this was a date, he wondered what they would do next time.
“Harry?!” looking up at the outraged cry Harry tried to smile as Draco got down to his level, hands hovering above his body and the blonde looked furious.
“You created this potion?” Harry nodded that he hadn’t.
“I don’t remember much father, but I’ve got it under control, it’ll be fine,” the blonde stressed, and the elder Malfoy’s eyes narrowed as if putting together the pieces.
“Rowena hasn’t spoken since she was removed from her initial place, and Salazar claimed that he would never speak again until there was a worthy person in the Headmaster’s position,” Harry looked towards the stilled portrait of the Gryffindor founder, she let out a giggle.
Harry had no idea about what it meant to turn sixteen in the wizarding world and briefly he wondered if he had a magical boost. He was distracted by Hermione and Ron putting on their robes, both securing their Prefect pins before heading to the door.
Glancing up sharply Harry found himself witnessing Malfoy laugh, not a chuckle, but a full belly laugh, and he was convinced no one had heard it before. Wiping the tears that had appeared in the corners of his eye Malfoy took a deep breath, a smile still playing on the edges of his lip.
“You can’t kill me Tom because I’m your heir, specifically I’m a Riddle’s heir,” it was dark laughter that he was greeted with and Tom looked at him with contempt.
“I didn’t ask to be resorted to Slytherin Nott. It was the hat’s decision to resort me, and everyone else,” Harry turned his body a bit to get a better look at the bathroom entrance wondering why no one had barged in, a slight shimmer on the door and Harry mentally groaned at the ward that was put up.
“Check the Great Hall and the library,” they nodded, and Luna looked at him carefully.
“Professor! Professor, what is going on here?” a cry from the table had Harry inching his way around a figure whose back was turned towards him, he could just make out the straps that bound the person’s feet.
“I really like him, Luna, Veela aside,” he mumbled rubbing the back of his neck, Luna reached out and squeezed his knee.
Harry shot the taller boy a knowing glance.
“Why were you at Flagley?” Malfoy’s eyes narrowed then widened in understanding.
Draco had wrapped his arm possessively around Harry’s shoulders and snarled at the trio, Harry could only imagine what his Veela side was feeling.
“A few started questioning your relationship, some were impressed with Draco for saving you from Merkoft, most didn’t think much of it,” he shrugged.
Lady Zabini pushed back her shoulder and trained him with an amused stare.
“I know who you are,” Harry froze, turning slowly, Harry’s green eyes met the older man’s dark blues.
“I can’t believe you got to talk with Salazar Slytherin,” Draco mused, and Blaise murmured his agreement, Harry snorted.
that piqued Harry’s interest as he made his way and shifted the wardrobe away from the wall.
the snake huffed as Harry watched as his friends conversed with one another.
Harry mused as a battle raged in the depths of his mind.
Shaking his head, he smiled at Luna who had watched the girl disappear with an uncertain look on her face.
Yet as Dumbledore nodded his head as if confirming what she had said both Ginny and Parkinson looked pitifully between them, Ginny shedding a tear as she looked towards Hermione.
“It’s the end of break Harry, you slept an entire day,” the blonde said, and Harry gawked at him.
Draco left and Harry opted for trying to catch some more sleep before classes that day. So as his alarm blared in his ear twenty minutes later, he whined.
“Talking doesn’t hurt, if anything it might clear some things up,” the dark-skinned boy said confidently.
Draco looked exhausted and Harry immediately picked up that he’d been sleeping the way that his hair was stuck out in different angles. Hesitating, he wondered if he should have bothered him.
“Go, ‘mione, I’ll catch up with you later,” as the class emptied out Harry dragged his feet to the Hufflepuff head of house who was chatting with one of her plants, as she spied his arrival she smiled.
He didn’t understand how Tom had come about learning what a Horcrux was let alone how to split his soul into not one, but multiple pieces. If there was little to no information inside the school, and Tom rarely went back to the orphanage except for summer break, someone had told him about it. Though, who would know enough of that dark magic to even understand it themselves.
“He’s remembering, we have to find the rest of them,” he murmured and the Slytherin’s shared a glance.
“Hogwarts was founded on some of the oldest magic known in the wizarding world, unfortunately most of what the castle was built upon was lost over time, so if Tom’s seeking out that information he could easily be looking around the world,” making an ‘ah’ motion with his mouth the two settled into silence.
“Usually Blaise spends the holidays with his Mother and it’s a very dry affair, I think he’s just enjoying a more relaxed environment,” Draco commented as he swooped in for another chaste kiss and then headed towards his room.
“Professor! The locket!” he cried, and Dumbledore ignored him, turning towards where the locket was still trying to reach him, he pushed his magic towards it.
Draco and Blaise got up from their seats and went to assist the librarian who wasn’t any closer to figuring out the counter spell or keeping the students quiet.
“Busy night?” he asked lewdly shooting them a knowing grin, Harry flushed while Draco’s pinned his best friend with a well-known Malfoy glare.
Silence.
Panicked, Harry fled.
“The entire winter break I received half a dozen letters from Ron wanting me, us,” she stressed, “back as friends. When I didn’t write back his letters became angry and frustrated. He tried talking to me on the walk back up here,” her eyes narrowed as if recalling something he said.
“Hard to argue with that,” he said as he swallowed the last bit of his meal. Pushing his plate away he waved goodbye to them before heading out the door to one of the lesser used corridors. Casting the disillusionment spell over him he shivered as the spell washed over him. Checking to make sure he blended in with the surroundings he crept out of the corridor and towards the infirmary.
“I won’t let anything happen to him, just because it’s me and bad things always seem to follow me I won’t let Draco get hurt, I won’t let him be harmed, by Voldemort, by Dumbledore, by you or anyone else that could possibly hurt him. Draco gave me a choice to whether or not I wanted to accept the bond, he didn’t force me into it, I chose Draco and I’d choose him again,” Harry snapped and vials along the back of the classroom shattered.
“Curious,” peering towards Salazar’s voice Harry couldn’t make of the man’s face as he watched his chin jut towards the door.
Mister Malfoy’s hand still for a second before he brought the mask over his face, both he and Draco followed suit. Harry watched as Tom’s eyes took in both Malfoy’s before widening as he looked towards him.
They ate lunch in his room and dinner was a quite affair as a house elf explained that Missus and Mister Malfoy wouldn’t be attending. Draco had explained that it was normal for his parents to have other engagements to attend to during the Easter break.
“I just don’t understand it, if the potion says I’m his heir then something, any of this, would make sense,” he groused, mourning the lack of Hermione.
“There was a Muggle man in town that I had seen on a few occasions and we talked maybe twice. He was kind but had no interest in me, I,” Harry leaned forward and touched her knee at the hesitation, “I crafted up a love potion and gave it to him,” Draco sucked in a breath.
The room looked the same as it had earlier that morning when they had checked on the potion. It needed to simmer for twelve hours before it was ready to be used.
“What?” he asked tentatively, she clearly was speaking to him as she stood directly in front of him, but he had hoped he had possibly misheard her.
She chuckled daintily.
“Harry…” Draco whispered, and Harry let out a whimper, drawn in by Draco’s seductiveness.
Whether it was minutes or hours, he had lost all concept of time at this point, he finally opened his eyes and took in the destruction of the room. One wall was missing entirely, another was filled with holes, there were scorch marks along the floor; staggering to his feet his eyes darted to the two individuals still in the room.
“I’ve missed you Harry, how have you been?” intertwining their arms together Harry asked her about the upcoming winter holidays.
He recognized him.
“My father is still furious as I expected,” Draco’s tone hardened as he brought Harry’s healed wrist to his lips, pressing a kiss along the vein Harry shivered.
folding his arms on the table Harry put his chin between his arms and eyed the innocently looking quill.
“I would advice you to never speak of breaking my bond with Harry, father,” Draco said icily and Harry saw from under his lashes that the blonde’s eyes had finally turned the Veela silver, matched equally by his father who was staring at him with an angry look on his face.
“Father, Harry and I need to tell you something,” the man paled, and Harry pressed his lips together and tried not to laugh.
“There’s a handful of younger students wanting to use the bathroom,” squeaking by Draco Harry made for his room ignoring the burning look that he could feel coming from Draco.
“Mister Potter, to what do I owe this pleasure,” the man said with a sneer and Harry realized that he didn’t have his buffer of Draco and Blaise to quell the man’s annoyance.
He felt Draco freeze but before he could fully take in what was happening, he found himself in the Veela’s arms being coaxed back into bed.
“I heard what your parents said about me,” the blonde stilled, and Harry could only imagine the wheels turning trying to remember exactly what his parents had said.
“At the beginning of the year, we bumped into one another,” Draco spoke, and Harry appreciated it because he was beginning to feel as if his mouth was full of cotton, he was so anxious.
Three knocks on the door and a voice called out from the other side for him to enter.
“I would do it again if it meant keeping you away from him,” Draco let out the trill that he had earlier and both his parents winced yet Harry felt an unusual urge to get as close as possible to his mate.
Halfway back up the path leading to Hogwarts Harry eyed an untouched patch of snow with a growing sense of silliness. Weighing how much time they had left before curfew Harry pointed his wand and muttered the all familiar snowball spell.
“Are you okay Harry?” she asked softly, knowing all to well that anyone could be listening it, it was something the Slytherin house taught its members early on.
“Draco, Potter, glad you two could join us,” Harry recognized the boy as Conner Murphy, Snape had said at the beginning of term that he was leading the club.
“That was brilliant spell casting!” one of the girls gushed having put her clipboard underneath her arm, her eyes were bright, she was alight with joy, and the other girl was equally impressed.
“Father, I haven’t seen my mate since it happened, I need to see them, our relationship is complicated, but I’ll be home for the Easter holidays,” his mother shot her husband a look and the man pinched the bridge of his nose.
Draco let out a chuckle and backed up to his desk as Harry tried to control his raging hormones.
Draco’s smirk was the first thing he noticed followed shortly by the nail markings he’d left along the side of his pale neck.
“You two are ridiculous,” he said, and Harry stuck out his tongue, enjoying the relaxed atmosphere.
, what kind of research have you done?” Harry flushed and Draco groaned.
“How do you feel?” Harry asked softly, worry creeping into his voice; having slept almost an entire day he felt more rested and awake then he had in a long time, but he hadn’t been cursed and suffering with the remaining side-effects.
Harry couldn’t make it to his dorm room quicker if he tried. He only stopped by the kitchens to swipe something to eat but the odd looks the house elves were giving him, as their eyes flickered to his badge, made him feel uncomfortable.
“Veela pride themselves on prioritizing their mates above anything else, even our own happiness. What you felt that first time we collided was the spark of the bond, the indication that we’re mates. Each time after that the spark acted as a reminder in case the Veela, or mate, chose to ignore the bond. Your choice is to either accept or decline it,” Malfoy said factually, his voice changing to a more lecture tone that Harry had been accustomed to from Hermione.
“How about you allow me in, and I’ll personally make sure every item of clothing fits you perfectly,” Harry let out a groan and silver eyes sparkled as he allowed the room to let Draco enter.
It was a dark cave, nothing special, and Harry followed Dumbledore as the man lit his wand to help them follow the path. Harry pictured the monsters that could be in the cave and clutched to his wand tighter grateful that Dumbledore had enabled him to temporary use magic off school premise.
“My mum trained with someone who was able to use wandless magic, an older witch, have you tried meditation?” Harry nodded and Murphy snickered.
Neville nodded, “Friends until the end, Harry.”
“After we died we left the care of the school to the Headmaster and to the Deputy, it was on their shoulders that the students would be taken care of, pushed towards their potential, not to be put in harms way,” the man fumed as his robes billowed behind him and Harry couldn’t help but ask.
Humming to himself Harry peered around the office noting that the stacks of papers that Dumbledore had out regarding the Horcruxes were absent; oddly enough, many of the portraits that were lining the walls were empty and Harry could only wonder where the inhabitants snuck off too.
“I understand Professor, I’m not sure if what I learned would be useful but it seems that Tom wants to utilize the Founders magic to attack Hogwarts,” he said solemnly, Blaise had suggested planting a fake attack but Harry worried that someone could actually get hurt if they mislead the story too much; Draco’s idea had been to see what the Headmaster knew about the Founders, in particular Salazar Slytherin.
“Why are you telling me that I have an option?”
Harry marveled at the various food items, he could easily pick out some of his favorites and had to control himself from drooling over them.
The trio headed down to the huge doors of the school’s entrance and waited patiently for the wave of students to arrive. It was a little bit before dinner and Harry knew that they didn’t have long to wait.
“What happened to my son, Mister Potter,” she hissed, yet before Harry opened his mouth to say something she continued, “I felt my husband’s rage, his uncontrollable fury, and once he got back to the manor he had Draco in his arms and he didn’t even recognize me. Do you understand how far back he is into his Veela mindset? It’s been years since Lucius has lost control, so explain to me, how in such a short amount of time something managed to happen, and I want all the details,” it was a fury like no other and Harry winced as she explained her husband’s state, he clearly lacked any understanding of the Veela nature.
as Seviper settled into his bag Harry made his way towards Divination.
“It’s not that easy Hermione, Dumbledore, well, Professor Dumbledore isn’t quite what we think of him as,” he said slowly, aware of how wild what he was going to say would sound.
“I just got done with a meeting with Dumbledore,” something about his tone set the two boys on edge as both were giving him worried looks.
Opening it his eyes skimmed the two words etched out.
“How did it go with your father?” he asked as Draco led him down a different path, the gardens were huge.
It was one of the mysteries that had eluded Harry since the incident happened, now he only hoped that Dumbledore punished them accordingly.
Black eyes had flickered to the wound and with a snap of his robes he stood up and walked around the desk and with a flick of his wand, he cast a spell on the injury. Harry peered up curiously as a piece of parchment floated in front of the man wondering what the diagnosis was.
He missed his best friend.
“I’m a Veela Granger, I felt the spark with Harry at the beginning of term,” Harry managed to maneuver Draco back to sitting on the couch and he shot his friends a strained grin, all who were staring at the two stunned.
“Rarely do witches and wizards experience a drop in their magical levels. Occasionally it can happened if advanced magic is attempted by a younger witch or wizard, which is why certain spells aren’t taught until later years, but I cannot explain why it happened to Mister Malfoy,” pursing her lips she gave the duo a stern look.
Draco was currently under the Cruciatus Curse.
Scrambling up back towards the locket he watched as Dumbledore shot a burst of fire towards the Inferni which seemed to send them reeling back in pain.
“Thank you, Draco, this has been a wonderful day,” smiling up at the him Draco looked down and Harry could see the Veela melting.
Ginny seemed to be shaking as she tapped her wand against her leg, for a split-second Harry swore that he saw a spark shoot out the end of it.
It was Draco.
“What happened after we left?” he asked, and Blaise shot him an amused glance.
“What do you say, Potter, care for a friendly one-on-one?” the competitive feel that Harry had always felt before matches ignited for the first time in months. He hadn’t missed playing Quidditch but then, and there, he wanted to be in the sky.
“I expected you to try, but not for you to succeed,” he said nonchalantly, and Tom snarled.
as the metal hit the wall he pressed forward.
Minutes later Harry found himself rushing back towards Blaise and Draco, knowing well they wouldn’t be too happy with what had transpired.
Blaise had maneuvered himself on Snape’s left and Harry and Draco watched in interest as the ever clever Slytherin moved his Professor away from the room that they were headed too. Even as they rounded the corner Harry and Draco could still hear Blaise rambling on about the spider’s properties.
“Pansy is enamored with Draco, and you’ve taken his attention, and she was upset about it. I told her I would help her, though the oversight on your Parselmouth abilities was on her,” he scowled, seemingly unimpressed by Pansy’s tactic.
“Draco, I’m pretty sure that when Snape assigned me detention tonight that you were not to be a part of it,” Draco shrugged, and Harry was momentarily distracted as Draco pushed himself off of the wall he had been leaning against.
Neither spoke as they rounded the corner, yet Harry caught Blaise’s excitement as he was pressed towards the bookstore.
“Draco, I’m not a threat to your mate, he’s my friend and he looks like he’s injured, don’t you want to take care of your mate?” the teen said slowly and Draco let out a trill at the mention of Harry’s injury, Blaise clasped his hands over his ears while Harry turned in Draco’s arms coaxing the blonde to look down at him.
For weeks Harry had been having unusual dreams. Not dreams of torture or of the death of his godfather, or even of his parents, but dreams of a manor he had never seen before. Hallways leading to various rooms; the library, a study, a kitchen, the banquet area, countless bedrooms and rooms filled with valuable trinkets.
What Salazar had failed to mention to him, which in hindsight, shouldn’t have surprised the teen, was that concentrating on reading Parseltongue took a lot of energy. So, as he blearily woke up the following morning to banging on his door he moaned as his head throbbed and his vision swarmed.
“We’ll find a time when we can all meet up, and I just,” he took a deep breath, “I just need you guys to bear with me,” he finished ominously.
When they landed it was raining and Harry could barely hear the crack of thunder amid the clashing of waves on the rock that they landed on. Shaking his head, he wiped off his glasses trying to get an idea of where they were.
“He gave me a Portkey in case of emergency.”
Bolting upwards it took Harry a moment to remember that he wasn’t in his dorm room in the dungeons and the memories of the previous afternoon came rushing back. Groaning he flopped backwards debating on the ramifications of skipping out on class today. Mentally picturing his schedule, he knew it wasn’t a day he could miss; double Transfiguration, Divination, and double Defense Against the Dark Arts.
“No, they don’t know, I hadn’t expected to talk with them about it until the Easter holidays, if even then,” the tension grew thick and Harry shifted uncomfortably.
“You deserve everything Harry,” he whispered, and Harry flushed a deep red.
He wasn’t given much time to process what was going on as everything started to shimmer and then move at a rapid speed. He was taken between buildings, over alleyway walls, and inside a shackled building before everything stopped and he was standing in front of a door.
“Now, we wait the few second’s it’ll take for Blaise to come back,” he said dryly.
Out fell out a ring and Harry’s magic sparked, and he jumped. It was if his magic was reacting to it, as if it was something familiar to him. Dumbledore hadn’t noticed anything as he had stood up and searched the books behind him.
Till we read again,
Once he walked back into the bedroom, he noticed that Draco was rummaging through his trunk, silver eyes caught his own green ones as the door clicked behind him. Harry felt his cheeks heat up as he watched Draco ever so lovingly trace his body setting the clothes aside that he had picked out he closed the gap between them.
“Blaise said something upset you,” Draco said softly, a slight mixture of wanting to help but to not smoother him either.
With no sight of Blaise or Draco, Harry headed towards his room but not before catching Pansy glaring at him among her group of friends. Ignoring the look, he made it to the comfort of his bed with no other occurrences.
“No, he dif’t give me ‘nyfing,” his voice seemed unrecognizable as his eyes tried to concentrate on the worried silver orbs above him.
He realized he had made it to the Room of Requirement when the door appeared; tentatively Harry opened it. He wanted some place to hide, somewhere that he could think, and the room provided that.
What Harry hadn’t expected was Hermione’s panicked face as she rushed towards him, his heart sank as he realized the blonde wasn’t with her.
He wasn’t sure, but his magic had wrapped around him like a comforting blanket and he felt remnants of the magic that was surrounding the ring woven in with his own.
“Did I do something wrong?” he asked tentatively, and Blaise looked towards his mother waiting for her response.
He’d be joking around with Seamus, Ron, Neville, and Dean in their room in the tower right now. All unpacking forgotten they would have stayed up late reminiscing about the summer holidays, Seamus would have been flailing dramatically about his latest romantic conquest and Ron would have been eating the leftovers he snagged from dinner. Dean would have fallen asleep first while Neville would have been the only one to open his trunk.
The night proceeded with students being sorted and by Harry’s count Gryffindor had gained eight new first years, Hufflepuff seven, Ravenclaw five, and Slytherin five.
“Welcome to Zabini manor Mister Potter,” came a soft voice from his right and before he was able to utter his thanks, he caught sight of the grounds.
“Yes, Professor,” Harry spat, and left the room without looking back, unaware of the flickering lights and Dumbledore’s contemplative look.
Glancing down Draco shot Harry a smirk.
“Then why ar—” Harry had enough of it, his temper was getting the better of him and he held his hand up to the blonde’s lips.
As Harry told them what had happened between Dumbledore and Tom, Neville had turned green and began to heave into his hands. Blaise had summoned a bag and the Hufflepuff had sent him an appreciative look. Luna had tears streaming down her face and Hermione, well she had placed her head in her hands as her body shook.
Harry’s stomach shifted.
Harry was convinced Draco knew how to make his body look more alluring in just the right moments. Feeling the drool pool at the side of his mouth he pulled his eyes away from the Veela’s arms that had been exposed seeing as Draco had his sleeves rolled up, the muscles were flexing just enough that Harry briefly pictured them holding him tight as his dominating lips descended on his own.
“Draco, Draco, Draco,” he kept repeating but the blonde wasn’t looking at him, he was glaring at his friends and Harry watched closely as Draco’s silver eyes began to transform into the Veela silver.
“Anderson!” the two embraced and Harry could feel the tears brimming at the corners of his eyes, he felt so relieved.
followed immediately by
Taking advantage of Harry’s distraction one of the cloaked figures cried out
Students were everywhere and Harry barely heard Draco and Blaise talk with the other Prefects to get a head count to see if there was anyone missing. It had seemed that when Draco sent the students to get Professor Snape, they had sounded the alarm to the rest of the house that something had happened.
She was shaking and as his hand touched her shoulder she shot backwards as if trying to mesh herself in with the corner. Harry’s eyes traced her face and he took note that she had a cut along her cheek and a bruise blossoming at the corner of her eye. When she caught a glimpse of who it was, she let out a choked sob and flung herself at him. Wrapping her lanky arms around his neck and let the tears stream down her face Harry could feel her heart’s rapid beat. Pulling her to him, Harry held out his wand, eyes searching for her missing friend.
Taking pity on his mate he walked further up ahead and around a tree. Stepping on some branches that made a loud crack he watched as Draco looked over, quickly catching on.
“I’m not sure, fate seems to like to play with me and this just seems like something else I have to live with,” yawning he covered his hand and rested his head against Draco’s shoulder, the blonde rubbed a soothing pattern on his arm and Harry felt himself ease more.
“Something practical, he likes to study, so a charmed planner and organizer,” Hermione had suggested, and Harry winced, he couldn’t imagine getting Draco something like that.
came a hiss and Harry tossed his pillow over his face.
“Well, I was angry with you, I was frustrated that you had the information that I’ve been looking for,” Salazar waved a hand at him, clearly annoyed.
She gave him a look and he let out a stream of air and sighed.
Hand’s raised in a defensive gesture Blaise took a step back and looked at his best friend concernedly.
Leaving the parchment on the table Harry fled the room ignoring Draco’s calls for him to wait. He picked up a new speed back to the common room and barely registered Blaise’s astonished look as he made his way straight to his room. He was barely able to control his magic by the sheer strength of his frustration and as he shut his door behind him, he let it all out.
“That was Fiendfyre Harry, no matter what magic Tom had around the locket, it would have been destroyed,” sagging in relief Harry had to refrain from reaching down to check in is pocket that the locket was safe, the Riddle magic was there, he knew it.
“Hufflepuff was always an unnecessary house, many of the students that were sorted with the badgers were ill fit to be at Hogwarts,” the tepid anger that had been stewing reacted immediately as the wall nearest to them shattered.
Harry ushered the group into Honeydukes and made quick work picking Blaise’s favorite chocolates. He picked up some extra and figured that if anything he could overwhelm the taller boy with a mass amount of chocolates for a gift. He picked up a few items that Draco liked and made sure he grabbed some raspberry and orange chocolate for himself. He wouldn’t be back to Hogsmeade until the start of next term and needed to be stocked up for the holidays.
“Hermione, I would never have gone out of my way to hurt another student. I miss you and Harry so much,” her eyes glossed towards him, “You both are my friends and mean so much to me,” she finished and tugged at the hem of her shirt underneath her robes.
“When my parents got to the Hospital Wing my father was furious that I had been injured, especially since Madam Pomfrey said she didn’t know why magic levels had dropped. I knew why, my Veela knew why, but I didn’t tell my parents that,” the Veela got quiet and Harry turned to look up at him.
“Let’s split up and look for him, Blaise will you check with Professor Flitwick?” the teen nodded and turned with Hermione on his heels, both Neville and Luna looked towards him expectantly.
The three talked in hush voices as the night went one. Students came and went, some wishing Harry well while others still tried to pry out information, though Draco had none of it and within mere moments the student would hurry away, embarrassed.
“Zabini…” the warning tone was evident, and Blaise raised his hands in surrender, a small smile still lingering on his lips.
But before Blaise could retort Draco’s hand snatched the other Slytherin’s paper where he spun it around and pushed it towards Neville.
Since break had started Harry had found himself in the arms of his mate every night, it was only the last few mornings that they had explored the more physical side of their relationship.
“What’s wrong,” she demanded, and Harry nodded his head in a manner implying he didn’t want to discuss it.
x.x.x.x.x
“Are you going to grant me access?” pointing his finger to his lips he tapped once, then twice, and gave Draco his most Slytherin look.
A ding and the timer started.
Feeling uneasy he shuffled on his feet as Malfoy just stared down at him. Annoyed by the height difference Harry waited patiently for Malfoy to say something, anything.
“I’m here visiting and didn’t withdrawal any Galleon’s before I left, this is my first time outside of Diagon Alley and Hogsmeade,” the goblin snatched up the key and after a quick once over gave Harry a hard stare.
Two and a half hours later Harry had finished a few homework assignments and looked up to see the team wrapping up for the evening. Well, most of them. The two Beaters were still flying laps and as they flew past, Harry could hear part of the conversation.
As they stepped in front of the Floo Harry tentatively touched his wand in his back pocket underneath his shirt. While he couldn’t do magic outside of school, he still felt better having it with him. He discreetly felt the locket beneath his shirt and thumbed the chain hanging from his neck. It wouldn’t surprise him if with one look Mister Malfoy carted him straight off to Tom.
“What time is it?” he asked muffled and squirmed as Draco poked him in the side, peering up his glared at his mate who had let out a chuckle.
While he knew where the Slytherin house was located he wasn’t supposed to know, and even if he managed to make it to the entrance, he had no idea what the password was. Groaning at the unfairness that was his life he rubbed the bridge of his nose trying to alleviate the mounting pressure behind his eyes.
“Would you be surprised if I were to say this wasn’t my first time here?” snickering at the boy’s suspicious glance the conversation stopped as the entrance opened and a wave house mates entered.
“Veela’s can be very territorial creatures Harry, once they find their mate they can be possessive and controlling of their partner, have you thought it through what you’ve got yourself into?” it was her hesitant, non-accusing tone, that Harry appreciated as Draco didn’t fly into a fit of rage.
“I’ve noticed your grades have improved drastically Harry, your parents would have been very proud of you,” standing somewhat shakily Harry nodded his goodbye as he walked down the spiral stairs.
He carefully removed his clothes and grimaced at the state of his body. He had various markings on his arms and legs from the Inferius which made him sick to his stomach. He noticed that bruises were starting to blossom around his neck and arms.
The two finished and after Snape dismissed them once he had checked their work, they headed back to the common room.
They left the manor and walked towards a hidden part of the grounds nearing the edge of the property. Mister Malfoy turned towards them and pulled his mask over his face.
“I don’t need to hear it, Helga was always the one with the biggest heart, she trusted far too easily compared to the rest of us,” a flicker of annoyance trilled down Harry’s body and he narrowed his eyes.
“Blaise is, uh, right Professor, I rarely do anything and uh, it would be easier to go to Blaise than Draco’s,” he fumbled and flushed as Snape rolled his eyes.
Hearing footsteps Harry stepped into the shadows hoping to avoid an interaction with Filch and Mrs. Norris. A flash of platinum blonde hair had a grin spreading across Harry’s face and stepping from his hiding spot he snickered at both Blaise and Draco’s surprised looks.
Both waited, unable to tear their eyes away from the parchment.
“Sorry I’m late Professor,” he said with a catch in his breath as the Headmaster waved him towards another path.
“Goyle, Greggory!” the buzzing in his ear was drowning out what was happening. Licking his dry lips, his eyes darted to the Slytherin table.
“Well, our rounds are almost up, we just have to sweep the Great Hall and then we can head back to the common room,” Harry started to head towards the dungeon when a hand at his elbow stopped him.
“You’re my best friend Harry, and while everything you’ve explained here tonight is nothing I could imagine in my wildest dreams, I’ll always stand beside you,” her eyes glinted, and Harry grinned.
“Were you hoping to find something else for him today?” the man pressed gently, and Harry hummed.
Harry stuck out his tongue.
“Did you attack me and the first year’s on Halloween night?” Harry did his best to keep his tone level, still angered that the attackers from that night hadn’t been found.
“I have more important things to focus on Potter than your resorting into Slytherin,” and with that the boy left back around the corner and for a moment Harry felt lost, even his school rival had seemingly matured.
It had only taken a minute.
For a moment there, Harry felt his heart swell.
on him,” Blaise spoke, and the nurse nodded.
“Much better,” his voice came out hoarse and Draco was quick to summon him a glass of water, rubbing his back gently and ushering him to drink slowly. Harry didn’t have the heart to fight the coddling, in a way, it was nice to be fussed over.
“So, Harry is your heir?” Harry felt himself nodding along with Merope, he had figured that out early on, and truthfully, wasn’t bothered that he was – in a sense – related to Merope, he had come to bond with the women during his dreams.
Harry didn’t say anything as Draco pulled him into his arms and buried his nose into his hair, he himself clenching the Veela’s arms, their bond was a flux of emotion and Harry felt dizzy trying to process it all.
groaning as he looked in the mirror he still wasn’t satisfied with what he was wearing. Draco hadn’t given him any indication what they were doing so he wanted to wear something that was universal.
The group chatted as the Hogwarts nurse approached them and ran on last test, when she finished reading it, she handed Harry a box of vials with strict instruction to see her if he felt worse or there was any unusual side effect.
“Draco,” he said tentatively, and the blonde spun around, and Harry immediately picked up that the Veela’s silver eyes had taken over.
It wasn’t until the following weekend that Harry managed to get two Ravenclaws, a Hufflepuff, Draco, Blaise, and himself in the Room of Requirement. It was tricky; between Hermione’s extracurricular activities, three Prefect duties, Neville’s Herbology obligations, and Harry’s wandless training, there was only a small window available for them to meet up.
Waving his wand around them Malfoy placed up a privacy bubble as Harry fumbled with the strap on his bag. The silence wasn’t uncomfortable, Malfoy seemed to be waiting for Harry to speak.
came the disgruntled response and Harry chuckled.
“It was Malfoy,” Ron’s eyes narrowed and before he could angrily retort Harry quickly finished, “He was, nothing, no rude remarks, not scathing looks, just acknowledge me and went about his business,” Ron deflated while Hermione looked at him curiously.
Grateful that Blaise hadn’t followed him Harry arrived at his room with minimal interaction with another of his housemates. Pulling down the ward to his room he entered in to find Seviper completely stretched out over the length of his bed.
Ginny shifted uncomfortably in her seat as Neville shot Harry a worried look. Luna just smiled and reached forward to lightly touch his clenched fist. Threading their fingers together she gave his hand a squeeze.
Sighing, Harry sat on his bed.
“It was after a few weeks of spending time together, a few first years and I were attacked and under the circumstances Draco was able to feel what I felt and able to find me,” Missus Malfoy still hadn’t moved but seemed to be mentally putting things together.
“Feels good, pleased to have you withering underneath me for the third morning in row,” Draco said with a smug grin and Harry swatted his shoulder.
“We need to figure out how to get the Horcrux back with you and out of the locket,” Harry said dodging the comment on Dumbledore’s death, he wasn’t ready to actively plan the Headmaster’s demise.
“Harry….” Immediately Harry picked up the unsureness and pushed himself out of the Veela’s arms ignoring the growl coming from the blonde.
“A Bludger had targeted him on the way down,” but Harry wasn’t listening anymore, he had an idea of what had happened, and he knew that it was all his fault.
As Draco ushered Harry to an available bed Blaise directed the two first years to the ones next to him, Madam Pomfrey had heard them come in and her eyes narrowed at the sight of them as her steps quickened. She waved her wand over the nosey students and pulled their curtains shut.
Draco sighed, “Plangetine is a magical flower that has to be picked as it blooms, which is only during the moonlight in the winter months. While it’s somewhat rare, only found in certain areas in Europe, we’re in luck and some should be found in the Forbidden Forest,” Draco paused, “and well, our best chance at finding some is tomorrow night.”
Thank you for reading!
“We have a room available Mister?” she scratched some information down on the check-in log and Harry’s mind went blank.
“I still think you should be taking it easy,” rolling his eyes good naturally Harry shot the blonde an exasperated look.
“Students, we shall begin the year with a refresher on Xylomancy since the season is beginning to change, why is that important?” Harry half-heartedly listened to Parvarti’s answer while staring at his pile of twigs dejectedly.
“Professor Dumbledore approached me about your request to visit the Zabini manor over the upcoming holidays,” their teacher paused, and Harry held his breath, Draco scoffed.
“You were there! I knew I could sense you,” sounding triumphant Harry cocked his head to the side not understanding.
Sitting at the table as Draco collected the potion in two vials, Harry stared at the parchment of paper with a pit of dread settling in his stomach.
It was an eerie trek down to wherever they were headed, and Harry’s eyes darted at any sound, knowing that it was Dumbledore that created the Horcrux he tried to piece together why the older man had placed it here.
Harry sighed.
Heart racing, he looked up at the Veela who was looking down at him with concern.
“You’re not planning on attending the rest of the day?” it was Draco who interjected.
He wandered among the rows of books trying to think of a distraction. He didn’t want anyone leaving the library, he just wanted their attention on something else, so whatever it was it couldn’t smell.
It was a gloomy Tuesday afternoon that Harry found himself in an unusual group consisting of the Slytherin first years, Hermione and Luna. The five were insistent on passing the end of year exams in the top of the class and had pestered Harry for additional advice on study techniques.
To everyone’s surprise it was Blaise that spoke up.
Wiggling his way down the lean body Harry enjoyed touching his mate without the rush that was usually surrounding them in their dorm rooms. Tugging off the soft pants Harry let his mouth take charge and grinned at the sounds that he was hearing above him.
Screaming, Harry could barely hear the walls splinter and crack as the sound of rushing air around him consumed everything.
“What happened Blaise,” he asked once more as Blaise looked sadly at his friend lying there.
It was a few days later that Harry finally had an opportunity to talk with Hermione. He needed to review for Defense Against the Dark Arts and due to Snape’s requirement that no one walks alone Blaise begrudgingly tagged along. The boy was exhausted from exams and had wanted to sleep but knew Draco would have thrown a fit if he found the green-eyed boy alone considering he was on his Prefect round and unable to accompany him.
“I believe Harry, that you were on the receiving end of a blood heir ritual the night that You-Know-Who tried to kill you. The bit of Tom that was there triggered the ritual, which is why you have a scar, as proof that it had been successful,” she finished carefully, and Blaise let out a low whistle.
“He’s been gone most of the break,” came Hermione’s soft voice from his side, taking a sip of her water she fiddled with her silverware.
“And?” his eyes darted towards Blaise who had pressed his lips together.
“We have to leave soon, if we’re lucky mother hasn’t cleared the table of breakfast,” Blaise said dryly as moments elapsed in silence, each teen lost in their own thoughts.
With no energy to fight of the Inferius Harry tried his hardest to stay conscious. He could feel the creatures fingers grab tightly at his arms, at his neck, and pulled him under. He fought to keep his eyes opened and wondered how he was going to make it out of this.
“Harry!” turning, he grimaced as two of the chairs had snagged at Draco’s robes which had distracted the blonde and he had lost his grip on his wand.
“Back off Merkoft,” he said icily and placed a firm hand on Harry’s shoulder and nudged the shorter boy towards the dorms.
Skimming the pages Harry recognized it as
Harry could feel the nervous energy from the first years from where he was sitting as he felt the trill of anticipation at new students being sorted.
“Master Blaise has a guest in the receiving room,” the elf squeaked out and Harry felt antsy as Blaise dismissed the elf, swallowing the last bite of his food he glanced towards his friend.
“Though after my birthday, I started having different dreams. I was dreaming of a manor; I had never seen this manor before. It wasn’t until I was back at Hogwarts that someone appeared in the dreams. Her name was Merope and she told me that I was having a
“The Veela side of him wouldn’t have allowed anything else to happen, he saw his mate was going to be hurt, and took the steps to ensure that you were protected. While you may have wanted it to turn out differently, Draco would have had that scenario end the same regardless,” hobbling his way up the manor steps he watched as Snape pushed the door open with ease, yet as he walked through the entryway he shuddered as an unusual wave of magic coated him.
The two spent the next half an hour cleaning up the ingredients that were on the floor. Most were able to be salvaged while others had to be tossed. Luckily, nothing dangerous had been broken.
There was silence, and then the uncontrollable laughter coming from Harry. Malfoy had an eyebrow raised and a frown marring his face, but Harry couldn’t stop laughing.
“I would remind you that as you roam the halls of Hogwarts to never do so alone,” Harry frowned, Professor McGonagall had never given the Gryffindor’s that warning, “Ensure that you are always with someone, I will not tolerate disrespect to the Slytherin house and any point deduction or mishap,” Snape directed his look at Harry, “will result in detention with me. The house dueling club will meet up in two weeks lead by Mister Murphy and Quidditch tryouts will be held in a week, please see Mister Malfoy if you would like to be slotted for a time,” Harry’s ears perked at the mention of a dueling club, he had no idea Slytherin’s had such an activity.
Bringing up his hands to cup Harry’s cheeks the blonde pressed their lips together and Harry readily accepted Draco’s tongue, one hand clenched to his towel and the other gripping onto Draco’s arm. The kiss was as sweet as their first one and Harry felt a warm feeling wash over him, realizing it was from the bond between them he gave his mate a lopsided grin.
Groaning, he pulled himself to his desk and rummaged through his bag for his History of Magic homework and while it wasn’t due until the following week Blaise had promised he would look it over for him this weekend in exchange for Defense Against the Dark Arts help.
“I hope that you’ve been enjoying your stay! What can I help you with?” putting the papers on the desk she focused on him, seemingly trying to look more collected than she was.
“How does your Veela side feel?”
“Draco mentioned you were ill, are you better?” taking in his rumpled clothing Blaise shot his best friend a glare, the blonde returning one of his own.
“It is unfortunate that many of the students will likely follow in their parents footsteps, there isn’t anything we can do to help them, just gather what information you can find,” at the dismissive tone Harry pinched his thigh to distract him from the honest retort he wanted to say.
There was a pause, “I expect that you will handle the rest of the accommodations necessary,” at the boys chorus’ of agreement they were dismissed.
Hermione rolled her eyes with a smile playing at her lips having quickly caught onto what Harry wasn’t saying.
“Well, I don’t accept that I’m his heir, there is no way that it’s possible,” Harry said stubbornly, and Blaise shrugged.
Malfoy’s head turned and the boys locked eyes for a moment and the taller boy nodded his head in a curt gesture.
“Granger, Hermione!” a sharp intake of breath was the only sound that Hermione had uttered as she made her way up to the sorting hat.
The first years huddled together, likely intimidated by the dozens of students that came in at once, and Harry made his way to the outskirts of the room and observed, it was nearing ten at night and all he wanted now was to sleep.
Relaxing his shoulder’s, he felt the stress of the situation ebb away and he smiled as Draco pressed a kiss to his temple as he pulled away. Snape was watching the two as if he was searching for something, Harry wondered if he found whatever he was looking for.
There was a moment of silence before the two parted ways.
Thank you to everyone who has read my story! I can’t believe we’re on chapter nine. I appreciate the patience because obviously the big question is how is Harry Riddle’s heir and what does that make Tom and Harry, well you finally find out in this chapter and I hope you enjoy the twist!
“Seeing as Lucius Malfoy is one of Voldemort’s inner circle, getting closer to young Malfoy could be beneficial,” reigning in his emotions Harry concentrated on what Dumbledore was doing.
Snape’s eyes flashed something that Harry didn’t understand but it was pushed in the back of his mind as he found himself in Draco’s arms, nose pressed into his neck, and soothing words whispered into his ear.
Holding out his wand Blaise pointed it down the hallway.
Footsteps rushed down the hallway and Harry brushed away the tears and got to his feet as he looked towards two very familiar faces headed his way.
Snape was standing off to his left, the man had his wand raised and Harry realized that he had up a protective bubble around him. At the click of shoes Harry turned to see Tom walking towards him, the man was looking at him with interest.
x.x.x.x.x
“Well, if they are truly your friend Harry, they would know you didn’t mean for them to get hurt,” she said and Anderson nodded his head in agreement, he let out a laugh.
“Well, you’re healing Mister Potter, but your body took a substantial amount of injuries and while I believe you’d be best here for the following few days,” at Harry’s look of misery, she chuckled, “I know you’d sneak out of here as soon as you could,” Harry gave her a cheeky smile.
“Um, could we talk?” gesturing for him to sit down Harry sat in the vacant spot that had been occupied minutes ago.
“Care for a walk?”
It took him a few minutes before he found himself in front of a different door and he pushed it open. Sighing as he saw his mate laying underneath the covers, he felt tears well in his eye.
Until we read again,
Falling next to his knees next to his mate his hands hovered over the blonde.
“Better, still a bit sore though,” she nodded and handed him a glass of water as she pointed her wand at him, reading through the list that appeared above him she hummed.
Harry spent the rest of the day shopping, which was such a usual activity that many of the employees were happy to point out items and make suggestions. One guy was ecstatic that he was looking for a whole new wardrobe and while he tried to convince Harry that leather would fit his form, Harry flushed at the image and politely declined, both had settled on a suitable style that fit Harry’s taste. From slacks, to shirts, to underwear and socks, to winter clothing and items he could enjoy for the remainder of the season, Harry marveled at his purchase. It didn’t help either that the gentleman who had helped put together his wardrobe, Eric, had eyed him multiple times in a way that made Harry blush.
Shifting next to the blonde Harry covered his mouth as he let out a yawn, jaw cracking he rubbed at his eyes willing himself to stay awake; he was still exhausted from his interaction with Tom. Draco immediately picked up on the movement and tugged at Harry’s arm for the teen to stand. Suddenly feeling more tired then he had Harry felt his eyes droop and within minutes he was back in Draco’s room of the Zabini manor tucked in under the covers and with his mate’s arms wrapped securely around him.
“You deserve everything Harry,” and Harry believed him when he said it.
“Snape didn’t wonder why you wanted to suddenly use his Floo to contact your parents?” Draco flushed and turned away all while Blaise cackled.
Jolting forward Harry was happy to see that he was back in his room. Peeling himself from the bed as he had sweated through the sheets, he glanced at the clock next to him. Half past six flashed at him and Harry decided that he had slept enough to be up and proceeded to shower and change.
“Adopting an heir has only been around for the last century or so, I then began to research what wizards and witches did prior to that,” she prattled on, pointing to various pages to enforce what she way saying.
Her blue eyes were soft as she fiddled with the strings on her scarf.
“I’m sorry that you heard my parents talk poorly about you,” he finished, and Harry hummed.
“You have no right to tell me to get away from my mate, I will not leave him, I will never leave him,” Draco’s voice had changed and Harry watched with fascination as Mister Malfoy screeched and wings burst from his back.
“What, too good to participate, Potter?” the sneer on Parkinson’s face had Harry rolling his eyes. Ever since her and Nott’s failed attempt at hurting him she had been quiet, but Harry had kept his guard up.
the snake jolted, and a pair of black eyes stared at him unwavering.
“We’ve got a bet going that Granger will have this mystery solved in less than a day,” Harry rolled his eyes but he could only hope that with all of his friends he could figure out what exactly was going on with Albus Dumbledore and his newfound Riddle heir status.
followed immediately by a
“Hey Esmelda, how were your exams?” the question had been directed at her, but his eyes connected with the other four first years as well.
Blaise still riled Draco up as they approached the Floo and Harry masked a laugh as a cough as Draco seemed to want to throttle his friend.
“But, when a Veela find’s their mate, they are bonded with one another, Veela’s can’t survive without a mate, all the texts I’ve read on Veela’s say they are very selfish, prideful, and dominating creatures,” Hermione prattled on factually, it was Draco’s snort that had her brown eyes pinned on him.
“I’m tired of everyone thinking that they know my best interests, I watched my godfather die in front of me. I wasn’t able to protect my mind from Voldemort, I wasn’t able to save Sirius,” the light bulb above them shattered and Harry’s fists clenched.
“Yes, but first we have to get the ingredients. Most I can owl order in, but there is one that may be difficult to get. Have you ever heard of Plangetine?” he shook his head no.
For the first two weeks of the school term Harry found himself buried in books more than he ever had during his previous years. Many of the Slytherin’s had gone out of their way to avoid him, except for Zabini, who had sought him out as partner in Divination.
It was Neville who pipped up before Harry could respond.
“It’s – it’s,” Neville took a deep breath and Harry caught Draco’s eye, the blonde shot him a saucy smirk.
Harry couldn’t make sense of what the snake was saying to him convinced it was an entirely different language than Parseltongue.
As she pulled away, he watched her glance at something behind him and whatever it was that she saw she looked up at him with curiosity.
“Are you alright?” waving away the Veela’s worry Harry caught a glance of a textbook that Draco was holding.
It took a moment before the hat was removed from Harry’s head, and sneaking a peak up at Professor McGonagall Harry wasn’t surprised to see her ashen face.
Shifting on the bed he blinked a few times trying to get his eyes to focus. There was some light streaming through the window, and he realized with a groan that he had only been asleep for a few hours, which explained the sand-like feeling in his eyes.
“Hermione, can you handle this? Luna, will you?” he motioned towards the first years who had looks of worry as they watched the older students bicker in front of them.
“He had such a sparkle in his eye as he asked me how I was feeling, how my son was doing,” her face pinched as she was trying to recall those moments.
“I’ll discuss this with Severus, I didn’t realize how close you had become with Mister Zabini,” the man said offhandedly, and Harry blurted the first thing he could think of.
“Draco, Draco,” slowing his steps as he approached the blonde carefully, knowing that the Veela part of him was furious at the memory of him being attacked and to find out that it was someone of his own house, someone he considered a friend, Harry could only imagine what was running through Draco’s mind.
The man muttered something under his breath and pinched the bridge of his nose.
It was dark and raining and glancing around Harry could barely make out the signs of the shops that were nearby but as he looked up to the creaking above him, he could see the words Borgin and Burkes illuminated as a flash of lightening lit the ominous sky.
Harry sighed and ran his hand through his unkempt hair.
He waited a further fifteen minutes before Madam Pomfrey exited muttering something about finding Professor Snape and he was able to slip in as the door was closing. He peered around the room and noted that Draco was still in the same spot as he was earlier, except this time he wasn’t alone.
Luna would always smile knowingly and skip off as she hummed a random tune. Both Draco and Blaise confided with him later that she made them nervous because they could never figure out what she was thinking.
“Hey,” the Prefect looked equally as tired as he felt and Harry motioned for him to come in.
Any questions? I thought I would explain how Harry is Riddle’s heir in this chapter, but it didn’t pan out, I also thought Harry would tell his next step to the group and not Seviper, but I like where this ended.
Once the nauseous feeling had subsided, he pushed himself up, arm flailing as his vision shifted, hearing a sigh he looked up embarrassedly as Draco’s godfather was looking down at him unimpressed.
One, two, three.
The conversation lightened up as the group finished their meals and headed back inside once Harry had shivered; Draco had immediately picked up on the movement and with a wave of his wand Harry felt warmer.
Slipping to the floor Harry wondered who had intervened when strong hands picked up him by his arms and the familiar shock ran through his body. It was Malfoy; blushing Harry tried to focus his eyes to see him better.
“Headmaster Dippet moved us, later on during his career, which was very strange as he hadn’t minded us where we were initially,” scratching at his chin Harry looked at her expectantly.
“What do you know about Horcruxes?” he asked, and Salazar stroked his beard.
and winced as the spell completely missed the nearing chair and instead hit the wall behind it, he couldn’t concentrate.
Sensing Harry’s distress Dumbledore turned and gave what Harry assumed was supposed to be an encouraging beam.
Still reeling over the fact that it seemed as if the Professor was – concerned – about him Harry barely heard the wall move open and students chatter as they walked by him.
Harry didn’t say more and dozed until there was a knock on his door. Groaning he shuffled to open it as he covered his mouth with a yawn, swinging it ajar he wasn’t too surprised to see Draco on the other side, the boy had come to say goodnight to him almost every night for the last month.
Hermione had been his best friend since the incident with the troll and they had been on countless adventures over the years; he comforted her as she emotionally fumbled through her feelings for Ron and she had cheered him on during every daunting step of being the Boy-Who-Lived. While he had only been seeing Draco for a few months, he felt like there was genuine love blossoming between them - he understood her shock and he didn’t know what to do.
“Did Dumbledore give you something Harry?” panic creeped into his mate’s voice and Harry nodded his head sluggishly, feeling more drained than he had in a long time.
It wasn’t the first time Draco had wanted him to take it easy, during Charms the Veela had about rushed over to where him and Neville were practicing casting blue sparks. Harry’s had shot both green and blue and it took Blaise’s coaching for Draco to stay in place. Professor Flitwick had reassured him that it was because he wasn’t using his magic as often as he had prior to the attack and that there was build up in his core.
“He wasn’t there, he never showed, we were going to go over chapter thirteen because we debated about it, but not chapter twelve, he said that one was too easy,” she was rambling and Harry reached out and put a hand on her shoulder, his heart was pounding, and he felt sick to his stomach yet he attempted to give her a reassuring look.
“Interesting, Granger, you managed to adjust the draught to accommodate the needed energy, while also taking into consideration the addictive factor of the Wideye Potion,” Hermione beamed while the group looked between the two curiously.
“Dumbledore,” licking his lips he wondered if they would think he was crazy, “Dumbledore created Voldemort.”
The lack of sleep and self-care had caught up with him and the next day when he woke up he was groggy, that feeling someone would get when they slept too much. Groping around for his glasses he pushed them on the bridge of his nose and winced at the state of his room. Surprised that he hadn’t heard Draco or Blaise knocking at his door he caught the shimmer of the ward still up in his room.
When his eyes opened once more, he found himself in the all too familiar Riddle manor that he visited nightly since his sixteenth birthday. Sighing as he clamored upwards to his feet, he rolled his shoulders and stretched.
“My husband and I knew that anyone could have ended up as Draco’s mate. The Veela side of him seeks out the most compatible partner. We had hoped it would have been someone of different standing,” she said silkily and set aside her napkin, she gave him a pointed look.
“Welcome students to another year and to the first years that have joined us. A few things to take note of, Blaise Zabini has replaced Pansy Parkinson as the sixth year Prefect, while it is traditionally one male and one female, an exception has been granted. Mister Mason and Missus Saxon have been selected by Professor Dumbledore as Head Boy and Head Girl and Missues Faulkner and Mister Wright are the new fifth year Prefects who will be joining Mister Zabini, Mister Malfoy, Missus Bell, and Mister Lowell in Prefect duties,” Harry watched as Parkinson flushed with embarrassment as a few snickered at her demotion of her Prefect position.
His heart hurt and his mind was jumbled. Mister Malfoy was correct that he had put Draco in danger, all because he had decided against telling him that he was leaving with Dumbledore. Maybe then his mate would have been prepared for the onslaught of emotions from his bond, maybe something different could have happened that didn’t end with Draco lying in the Hospital Wing bed.
frustration laced the snake’s tone as Harry wrapped his arms around Luna, placing his mouth right next to her ear.
“I’m really sorry Draco that you ended up in the Hospital Wing,” he said softly, and he felt more than heard the teen next to him sigh.
Who knew that rolled sleeves, and the arm it exposed, could be such a turn on.
Dean had the grace to look embarrassed.
“Mother, we’ll be leaving,” as Blaise reached out and kissed his mother’s cheek, he completely ignored her mother’s partner which wasn’t missed by anyone.
“I’ll be fine, Draco can fill you on what happened,” brown eyebrows shot up.
He normally wasn’t a jealous person, and it was probably to do the more intimate actions that had happened earlier, but Harry didn’t like the idea that Draco was with someone else. There must have been something on his face because Blaise shot him a look of worry.
Still somewhat confused he opened the box, blinking once, then twice, he grabbed the wastebasket at the edge of his desk and threw up in it. Heaving again he brushed away the tears that were streaming down his face and looked at what was inside the box once more.
Hurrying down to the Dark Arts section Harry took a split second to take note that there were thick layers of dust covering the book. Finding
Until we read again.
“Yes, if Dumbledore catches on that any of us know what had happened it wouldn’t take him long to peak in your minds and verify it, Blaise and I can teach all of you,” Draco said confidently and Harry rolled his shoulders, feeling better than he had in days.
“Have you told your parents anything?” he asked Draco tentatively, memories of them from the Hospital Wing flashed through his mind and he felt his heart race.
the shield floundered, and he watched in horror as the spell hit it’s target and Draco fell to the floor.
Draco passed the ingredient bag towards him and walked around the corner with a groan, hand gently rubbing his stomach, covering himself up with his cloak Harry watched interestedly as McGonagall caught sight of the other Prefect.
Changing of the tide,
None of the books had any information on realistic dreams and what they could mean. Some passages indicated that he could be foreseeing his future life or that he was dying soon. The bookstore owner, Mister Spaulding, had finally introduced himself the second day that Harry had spent most of the day in his shop.
“I will never forgive you for putting them in danger,” he bit out and Ginny let out another sob, Hermione clucked disapprovingly as she hovered next to the Gryffindor.
“Skip the emotions, why were you able to speak in tongue to me, what usually enables you to speak Parseltongue,” the man prodded, hair glinting in the torch light.
Merope sighed.
Harry spent the next week leading up to his first date feeling happier than he had in a while. Hermione had tried prying out of him what had put him in such spirits, but Harry just waved away her questions, he still wasn’t ready to tell his best friend that he was a Veela’s mate. Neville was less intrusive and since the beginning of term the two had become closer than when they both were in Gryffindor. Luna kept shooting him perceptive glances and Harry was convinced she somehow knew everything.
The green light shot towards him and Harry was rooted to his spot, this was the only way to see if everything he had learned was true. Though as the light came closer Harry felt a warmth spread across his body, his eyes flickered down at his hands and arms that had shimmered gold and watched with amazement as the Killing Curse stopped short of hitting him.
Harry proceeded to explain what had happened and then what had happened to Draco.
More awake than he usually was on the first day Harry made quick work of finding his shower supplies and heading towards the bathrooms. Malfoy hadn’t pointed it out but after getting turned around a few times he finally found it. Grateful that he was the only one around Harry went about his morning routine in some semblance of normality.
“Harry!!” Smiling, Harry caught Hermione in a hug as the shorter girl barreled her way into him.
Harry swore the snake rolled its eyes.
“It was Bellatrix that cursed you,” he said quietly, and Draco snarled, the blonde knew as much.
“We must go Harry,” they made their way across the path with Dumbledore still maintaining small control of his fire spell; the Inferni were still trying to grab at them and Harry’s magic was spent. Once they reached the other side Dumbledore had sent out one last burst of the flame towards the Inferni and they fled.
“Chang, Cho!” the hat cried out. Harry’s eyes snapped to Cho who was looking at her head of house with confusion, Professor Flitwick was looking at Dumbledore who nodded.
After explaining his idea that he should meet up with Tom during the Easter holiday’s it was Blaise that suggested that he could come to the Zabini manor. He explained that his mother was neutral regarding the war and that he’d have an easier time leaving without anyone noticing. Harry had glanced to see what Draco thought of the idea and the other teen had agreed wholeheartedly.
Silver eyes found his own and Harry was relived to see that his mate didn’t seem overly worried about whatever his father had to say. There was some stress lingering in their bond but nothing overwhelming. He felt his cheeks heat up as Draco pressed a chaste kiss to his forehead and squeezed his shoulder.
“Can you please stay?” the question had come off quieter than he intended but Draco heard him nonetheless; with a wave of his wand their clothes had altered into something softer and Draco slipped underneath the covers tucking Harry back in his arms.
“Draco, thank you for joining us tonight,” Harry shared a look with his mate who was just as unaware as he was about what was going on.
“My time here is almost over Harry, I’ll admit, I knew I didn’t have much of it, I didn’t want to tell you what you’ve wanted to know, because once I do, I’m no longer needed here,” that confirmed one of Harry’s suspicions, “I’ve longed for the living world since I died and I wanted to enjoy being here back at my home for as long as I could,” a tear trickled down her cheek.
“Luna said that Seviper is feeling better,” Neville pipped up as the tension seemed to lessen from Harry’s taunt shoulders, Harry grinned at the information.
Feeling the tension ebb from his body Harry found himself laughing with his classmates as they took their respective seats at the Gryffindor table, Hermione and Ron flanked both his sides while Neville and Ginny were in front of him. Harry could make out the Creevey brothers further down and Seamus and Dean were in reach as well.
“Remove your masks,” he demanded.
“I’ll see you in the morning Harry,” making a noise of acknowledgement Harry barely managed to get in his pajama bottoms before sliding under the covers and falling asleep.
One boy, with spiky brown hair, was jotting notes as fast as his hand could move and he’d interjected the explanation to ask questions and Harry mildly wondered if the hat had put him in the right house.
“You’ve been terrible to us since first year, why is now any different?”
He caught a glimpse of long red hair before it vanished behind a pillar. Frowning, he knew it could only be Ginny, and he weighed the options of following her.
He didn’t know why telling Draco this made him so nervous; had it been Hermione, or even Neville, he wouldn’t have felt the spark of anxiety churn inside him.
So, nine in the morning on September first had Harry standing in Mister Spaulding’s back office in front of the floo. The man had told him that it would take him to Kings Cross Station and at Harry’s confused look the man explained how the floo system had been put in at the station years ago to help families.
“He’s very particular with whom he chooses to speak too,” came a light voice and Harry turned to see a warm smile directed towards him, with her bright eyes and yellow ensemble he realized who had spoken to him.
“That doesn’t necessary mean it was a Slytherin,” Luna’s light tone broke through the tension and both Draco and Blaise looked sharply at the smaller girl.
So, he didn’t move, stayed tucked into Draco’s embrace as the blonde’s Veela held an internal battle.
“Merlin Harry, I think I foresaw a hundred different ways Draco would have murdered me if I had lost you,” rolling his eyes Harry enjoyed the playful banter as they made their way back to Hogwarts.
“In case we do see anyone,” Harry swore he detected a hint of waver in the man’s voice.
Harry felt the worry morph to anxiousness and jumped slightly as he felt Draco’s hand squeeze his knee. The blonde was chatting with Rupert who had sat across from them, but the touch alone had Harry easing up.
“And you want me to deliver you to the Dark Lord?” he asked for the third time, and Harry nodded once more.
“Draco?” he whispered, feeling overwhelmed that he was seeing his mate awake and alive.
Her eyes flashed.
Taking a moment to catch his breath Harry gave the teen above him a lopsided grin and let out a shriek as the Veela nuzzled the inside of his neck. Pushing the blonde slightly away he ignored the look of surprised and flipped the two over. Kissing his way down the taunt chest and to the button of Draco’s posh pants Harry slowly pulled down the zipper and nuzzled Draco’s shaft.
Draco had put himself between Bellatrix and Harry.
“Harry, Harry, Harry!” the voice snapped, and Harry forced himself into a sitting position and poked at the newly formed scab, he gave an innocent look as Draco swatted his hand away and scowled at him.
“Hermione?” he reached out cautiously and grabbed her hand; she gave him a pained smile.
“Hello, Harry,” his steps were muted by the carpet on the floor and Harry reached out to touch her shoulder, she was hurting, he could tell as much.
“I need to talk with you Tom, something has been brought to my attention and it’s important we speak about it,” Tom pulled out his wand and pointed it towards him, Harry could hear Draco’s breath hitch behind him.
The blonde turned and various emotions flittered over his face, but he settled with shock and made his way up the stairs.
Feeling like he was being watched Harry blushed as he opened his eyes to see both sixth year Slytherin Prefects staring at him intently.
“We need to figure out Dumbledore’s plan,” she said, Draco shift next to him.
Harry’s stomach dropped as the pieces clicked, they had planned on getting caught, and he and Hermione had played into the trap of them getting off with a significantly lower punishment.
“Harry,” Draco stressed and for the first time that day Harry’s face broke out a sheepish smile.
“Most pairs don’t experience anything extra with their bond, but some can feel what their partner feels, whether or not it’s their emotions or physical contact, and it has only been rumored that a bonded pair have been able to talk telepathically, but,” Draco gave Harry a sheepish smile, “in some cases a Veela can feel a pull to where their mate is,” Harry took a moment to process the information.
Nothing more was said but a moment later the room was empty.
“I haven’t had any visions all summer, nor any feelings from him coming from my scar,” briefly making eye contact to convey his sincerity Harry’s eyes darted to Fawkes who had perched himself behind the Professor.
“Harry!” a cry from behind had him immediately on alert and Harry noted that both Draco and Blaise had their wands out.
“I need you to find out more information from the Slytherin’s, whose families have direct ties with Tom, better yet, if you’re able to get a confession from Mister Malfoy regarding his father’s ties with the raid’s that have been conducted we may be able to bring him in for questioning,” biting his tongue until he tasted blood Harry had to control his anger at the blatant disregard for the Slytherin students.
He had expected Malfoy to confirm his suspicions, to use his Veela allure, but what he hadn’t expected was laughter.
Fennekitten.
“Aside from him pulling Luna and I aside we’ve rarely seen him. Many of the students are gossiping that it has something to do with You-Know-Who’s return,” looking thoughtful towards the empty seat Harry wondered just the same.
“Leave him alone, he’s not worth it,” Harry said, and he could feel the shock rolling from the other two Slytherin’s.
“Now when reviewing for each of your classes your text will be your best resource yet I’ve found that these additional books,” pulling out a piece of parchment Harry couldn’t control his surprise that she was still carrying around that list from their first year, “are the best ones to dive deeper into the questions that you’ll be asked,” the Slytherin’s looked at her with admiration and she flushed, but even Harry admired her, Hermione would make a fantastic teacher.
“Blaise,” Harry tentatively but the taller boy pushed him aside and looked at the clothes scattered around.
“This came early this morning,” was Blaise’s curt explanation and turning the envelope over he rubbed his thumb against his name that was scribbled out.
“You know you want to submit, to let me take control, to enjoy what I can do for you Harry,” purred the Veela and Harry bit down on his tongue to not whimper, he enjoyed letting Draco take control, but tonight, tonight he wanted to be in charge.
For moment, Harry didn’t breathe, didn’t move, didn’t even blink. His eyes didn’t stray from those words that had appeared on the paper. He could hear Draco talking to him, pausing, and then going about the room to clean up the potion ingredients and cauldron.
Falling to sleep had come easier than it had most nights and Harry barely had the time to pull the covers up to his chin before he slipped into unconsciousness.
“I don’t know what this conversation has to do with you Malfoy, I was talking with Harry, so butt out,” she spat and Harry looked behind Draco to see that they still had the audience of the common room.
Hermione’s brows furrowed as Neville and Luna looked uncomfortable at the item. Draco sneered while Blaise lifted Harry’s hand to get a better look at the key.
“I thought the dream was leading me to him, helping me understand what it meant to be the Black heir,” he said trailing off, unsure of what to say.
As students tried to approach to ask what had happened Harry could hear Draco’s snarl over the raised voices, touching the hem of his shirt that had his own blood stains across it the Veela immediately turned to Harry and crouched down.
“Sirius named me the Black heir before he died,” swallowing the lump in his throat Harry could feel Draco listening intently to him, “he said he wanted me to be his heir, that we were already family but this made it official,” clenching his eyes tight Harry willed the tears to not fall.
“Alright, you lot, leave Harry alone,” between whining and grumbling Harry watched with a fond look as the group dispersed with pouts on their faces.
“You shouldn’t, you shouldn’t have - ” but the Veela tilted his head towards him, eyes focused solely on him.
His eyes scanned the room but stopped at the figure in the window. It was Merope, and from what Harry could see, she was clutching a toy to her breast with her forehead pressed against the windowpane.
A chill ran down his spine at what the words eluded to. Tom must have remembered something when the locket horcrux had reattached to him.
“I’ll be in and out Harry, it’ll look more suspicious if we’re both heading towards the forest,” Harry had narrowed his eyes and was about to make a remark when something clicked, and his shoulders eased.
“I’m just saying any time away from those Muggles is for the best!” seeing a row about to start Neville was quick to open to door for the trolley lady to say hello and offer up her assortment of snacks and treats.
It took a moment before Harry moved, before the pain in his heart subsided. He didn’t know what he had expected from Hermione. She was always the logical one of the group, she used her brains and books to make sense of any situation. She had told him weeks after he was resorted into Slytherin that she harbored no ill feelings towards his house placement because she understood the rarity of the resorting, how it came to happen.
He wanted nothing more than to haul Pansy up and remove her from Draco’s side.
he said sadly, squeezing his eyes shut as tears threatened to fall once more.
x.x.x.x.x
“It’s all clear, you had better leave now before someone sees you, remember, fifth floor Draco,” picking up his steps to keep up with the blonde Harry trailed behind him.
“But I will always be by your side Harry, I will always support you, I will always believe in you, I just need some more information to go off of,” Draco stressed and Harry heard the truth of his words and his shoulders deflated.
It was a short time later before he pulled back and looked up into the silver eyes of the Veela. His eyes hadn’t reverted and for a second Harry wondered how Draco was keeping such control.
“I, I can’t. I just can’t,” heart racing, and feeling dizzy, Harry did what no Gryffindor, or Slytherin, would have ever done.
Draco smirked, while Harry finally let out a laugh.
“Yes, Mister Potter, Draco is my godson,” sneering slightly the man shot the blonde-hair teen a glare, “who seems more comfortable than he should be in my presence on school grounds.”
“Care to explain to me what happened?” Harry nodded and gave the quick version of what he had learned from Salazar, watching carefully as Draco masked his reaction, yet their bond conveyed his unease.
“Harry!” squeezing Hermione around the middle he was relieved that he didn’t feel anything other than amusement coming through the bond as the girl rushed towards them, she backed away a moment later and gave her friend a small smile though her eyes had flitted towards the darker Slytherin standing off towards the side.
“Draco did, we’ve confirmed it with him and his father,” Tom’s eyes darted behind him.
“Let’s stop thinking about Blaise and Granger,” distracted from his thoughts Harry glanced over to watch Draco push open the Astronomy door, he wasn’t too surprised it was open as Professor Sinstra understood the need for some students to watch the stars for homework assignment.
“I felt that something was wrong, something was bothering me during the feast, had I recognized that it was tied to you, I could have been there sooner,” his voice cracked at the end and Harry peered up from his glasses bonking his head with Draco’s chin.
A house replacement can be.
“I find it interesting that this regards Mister Potter, yet Mister Potter hasn’t spoken,” Harry felt his mouth go dry as all eyes were on him.
It was a few days after the New Year that Harry found himself wanting to pull his hair out in frustration. Blaise and Draco had just got back from checking the potion and Harry had spent all morning combing through the texts that he had checked out at the beginning of break. It wasn’t the first time he had read them; he had spent many hours reading about family linage, responsibilities, expectations, and everything that went into naming an heir.
Groaning, Harry sought out the table furthest to the back and was intrigued when Zabini sat down next to him, he didn’t say anything, and for that Harry was grateful. Ron shot him a nasty look from where he was sat next to Dean, who had looked uncomfortable with the exchange.
“He’s my mate, I would never hurt him!”
Mister Malfoy rapped on the door three times, it was a moment before it opened, and a voice sounded from inside.
“And didn’t you see Death Eaters when you went to the Quidditch World Cup?” it was Hermione who pieced it together, she looked mortified.
“Give him a shot or at least hear what he has to say,” not waiting for a response Harry watched Zabini’s retreating form head out the classroom, deciding he’d head outside Harry spent his lunch period wandering around the lake.
“And nothing, mother,” the air between them thickened with tension.
“I can’t believe Draco threatened him,” he groaned, and Luna let out tinkering laugh, her blue eyes sparkling.
Browsing the isles Harry figured he would find something for Blaise here. He suspected that Blaise was a closeted prankster but wouldn’t be caught buying some well-known pranks.
“I’m really sorry Harry,” and the two sat there for the remainder of the evening, studying and notes forgotten, until Harry had fallen asleep and Draco pulled the covers up on his mate.
Brushing aside the tears that had pooled in the corner of his eyes Harry made quick work of picking up the text he needed, checking it out, and heading back towards Blaise.
“So, son, what do you boys have planned today,” Blaise noticeably stilled, and his mother shot him a warning look.
“Come here Draco,” the man spat, and Harry heard the quiet steps behind him, Draco stood next to Harry with his shoulders pushed back.
The hall went silent.
, I need you to relax and to trust me,” it took a moment, but Draco finally calmed down and had enough decency to look embarrassed.
“Harry, Dumbledore has your best interests at heart, you suffered a traum- “Harry shot Ginny a look and the girl snapped her mouth shut.
There were a few couches, a fire, and a coffee table in the middle. There was enough space for three to a couch and as Harry settled on one, with Draco and Blaise on each of his sides, he faced towards his friends.
Everyone started speaking at once and she sighed exasperatedly and gave Harry a pointed look having known that when something happened, Harry was always the main point of involvement.
“Relax Draco, your mate is just fine,” Harry peered up at Blaise curiously as Draco reached out and pulled him into his side, “I’ve seen what can happen here Zabini,” drawled Draco and Harry looked towards Blaise with mild panic, the teen waved away his concern.
The room wasn’t anything special except that it was about three times as large as a traditional classroom that could be found in the dungeon. There was an oval floor pattern in the middle of the room with chairs and board to the side. Names were written on the board in groups of six and Harry could barely make out who was in what group. There was a timer above the board and that piqued Harry’s interest further.
Dumbledore eyed the students concernedly while Professor Snape was barely controlling himself from finding the attackers and dealing with them personally.
Neither of them said anything more about his dream or about the possibility of being Riddle’s heir, and when it came time that breakfast was available in the Great Hall both trekked their way down in a comfortable silence. It was twenty minutes later that Blaise walked in with Nott and Parkinson; sitting across from the pair he raised an eyebrow at their exhausted looks.
“The password is Bertie Bots Beans, and,” dark eyes stared at his green ones, “be careful Mister Potter.”
“I’m asking you guys a lot; we’ve all been led to believe that Tom is evil and Dumbledore is good, and I know that isn’t the truth of it,” he trailed off, feeling surprisingly shy to ask for validation of his friends support.
It was three days later when Dumbledore was finally back and sitting in his chair in the Great Hall. He was chatting with Professor Flitwick as if he hadn’t been absent and Harry wondered how long it would take before he was summoned to his office.
Another pop and Laci had brought a tray of tea and another that had sandwiches on it. Harry eyed Blaise who picked up the tea and sipped on it carefully, mimicking his friend, he did the same.
holding his towel tight Harry’s conjured shield was able to absorb the first spell though he was surprised to see that the Reducto had been aimed at the wall next to him. As the spell hit the brick Harry winced as it shattered.
It was half of an hour later that the trio headed back to the Slytherin common room; Draco’s hand hadn’t left Harry’s shoulder and Blaise was acting as a buffer trailing a few steps behind them. Only a few students were wandering about and Harry ignored their surprised looks, there was something bigger going on than house rivalries.
Draco and Blaise were standing against the wall and Harry watched with mild amusement as Pansy whined about Draco’s absence on the train ride home, not many students were staying at Hogwarts for the holiday’s, there were a few seventh years hoping to take advantage of the castle silence and some of younger years that were staying.
“Even though there’s seven of us Bill is the Weasley’s heir, when he turned sixteen my parents explained what that meant for him,” Harry pondered what he had been told.
The manor that they appeared in front of was as dark and gloomy as the ones he’d read about. It looked nothing like Riddle manor in his dreams and momentarily Harry was distracted by whose manor it belonged to.
“Yes Professor,” he gritted out, once the man grabbed a stack of papers, he waved the teen away and Harry was eager to leave.
Blaise smirked, “Impressive right?” Harry nodded and hid a smile at Blaise’s puffed up chest, he could imagine how important a manor was to a pureblood.
“Then how did you guys know that something had happened?” Harry said, while it made sense that Draco and Blaise had known he was in the Hospital Wing he didn’t know how the others knew.
In that moment the two spells collided and crackled with the strength behind them. There was a bright light, a cloud of smoke, and then silence.
“I know Draco, but Dumbledore sent for me and you were at Quidditch and Blaise was doing his rounds and I’d rather not bother anyone else from the Slytherin house,” he finished dryly.
Moans filled the room as Draco let himself go and Harry was pleased not fifteen minutes later, he was being held by the taller teen, both completely satisfied.
“Harry, Luna, I’m so sorry I’m late, I promised Professor Sprout that I would check on a few of the new plants we got in before I left for Hogsmeade,” Harry waved away his worry as Luna caught the taller boy in a hug and Harry raised a brow at Neville’s pink tinted cheeks, he might have been more daft than most but something was going on between the two.
“Ready Harry?” Draco held the vial towards him with a dropper at the ready.
“I was wondering if there were any books in the library about magical maturity or a wizard or witches’ inheritance when they turn sixteen,” squinting, she took a moment to think before waving him down one of the isles.
A faint ringing sounded, and Harry cocked his head to the side trying to pinpoint where it was coming from, he hadn’t heard sound before in any of his dreams and his heart raced with mild anxiety.
“Mister Malfoy, I’ve been having strange dreams this year,” Harry said slowly, watching cautiously as the Malfoy patriarch looked between the two teens with shock, Malfoy mask completely gone.
“Dumbledore reached out to me in November that he had found a Horcrux, and when I went to his office, I felt drawn towards it. I reached out to it, I didn’t know it then, but the magic that recognized me was Tom’s magic, and when I touched it, the ring, something happened,” the fire crackled as no one made a sound.
It was silver pocket watch with wings carved on it and the wings were curved as if embracing something. Harry thought it was perfect.
He couldn’t get the image of Tom out of his mind, he couldn’t wrap his thoughts around the idea that Dumbledore tortured him to kill people, innocent people. So many had died since Voldemort had appeared, and it all seemed to have stemmed from the man that Harry considered family.
Till we read again.
“Had it been just the Quidditch injury he would be back in classes Monday morning, but Mister Malfoy is experiencing a magical core fluctuation,” Harry’s brows furrowed, she caught the look.
Draco had admitted that he had been on a few dates before and Harry had confessed his crush on Ginny and Cho and it had been awkward because Draco’s face had hardened and it took a few hours of convincing by Harry that he didn’t still have feelings for them. Draco admitted later that his Veela didn’t like the idea of Harry liking anyone else.
“Though, this book isn’t going to be easy to find, it was placed somewhere no one could accidently find it and use it for malicious means,” a feeling of dread washed over Harry.
Black eyes took in his unkept state and the man raised a brow.
Taking notes was more difficult than Harry imagined and as the students made their way into the other half of the greenhouse to observe a Chinese Chomping Cabbage, Harry’s notes were haphazard, and Hermione whispered that she would make duplicates for him of hers later.
“Ron, that move isn’t a Gryffindor secret, Fred and George learned it from a Hufflepuff who was a few years older than them, that Beater had learned it from a Ravenclaw, teams have helped each other before,” Ron’s ears turned red and Harry watched his movements carefully.
That was it.
Spinning around Draco brought him in close once more and Harry grinned up at the blonde, his heart beating a little bit faster. Pushing himself up on his toes he pressed his lips against Draco’s. It was a chaste kiss and as Harry went to pull back Draco’s arms that had settled on his hips pulled him in closer.
Harry leaned back in his chair and rubbed his hands over his face.
Draco was bleeding, someone had taken him, and Harry had one guess to who that was.
The trio found a secluded area outside near where the flying class would meet on lecture days. There were patches of snow still lingering but the teens managed to find a bench free of snow and mud. It was the beginning of December and while the sun was out there was a cold feel in the air.
“Missus Parkinson, Missus Weasley, I’m deeply ashamed of what transpired back on Halloween, both of you have disrespected your house and your fellow students. While I do appreciate that you have both come forward,” Harry’s finger’s clenched into the palm of his hands as he controlled the surge of anger, “I do believe a deduction of one hundred points from both houses and detention for the remainder of the year is appropriate. Missus Weasley you’ll report to the kitchens every Saturday and Sunday and Missus Parkinson you’ll report to Mister Filch on the after classes during the week.”
“What can I help you with Marline,” he asked slowly when it seemed she was still transfixed on being upset.
Though before he could say anything more, he felt strong arms wrap around him and pull him into a brood chest. He clutched to Draco’s arms like a lifeline and breathed in the all too familiar cologne that he had become accustomed to.
“Is there something you wanted to talk about with me Harry?” her tone was light, and Harry had always appreciated that she lost the know-it-all demeanor when he needed for her to be open-minded.
“No Pansy,” the Veela’s eyes caught Harry’s, “Everyone should be getting ready to leave soon,” his voice trailed off as he caught sight of something behind Harry and he chuckled.
The Headmaster held the door and, turning towards him expectantly, the man caught his line of sight.
“What happened Potter,” blinking at the use of his last name he shrugged.
“Professor Dumbledore, you have to stop, you’re hurting him!” Harry barely recognized his own voice as he tried to wave and get the man’s attention, he felt his heartbeat in his ears as his brain tried to make sense of everything.
“Harry, Haaarrrrry,” opening his eyes having not realized he had fallen asleep Harry looked up to see an entertained Blaise and a concerned Draco.
“Hi Sophia, I need a room for two weeks,” Harry tried not to snicker as she flustered about looking for the guest sheet.
“I’m going to shower Draco, you should get ready,” he warned and when the teen pulled the blankets over his messy blonde hair Harry huffed and walked into the bathroom.
Halloween day had been just as Harry predicted, yet with some subtle changes. None of the students had attempted to approach him and as Harry mused out loud Neville had chucked and pointed out that Draco and Blaise hadn’t left his side and were shooting nasty glares at anyone who had headed his direction.
Draco smirked, having quickly eyed Harry’s pink tinted cheeks. Taking a step to close the gap between the two the blonde let his lips graze the shell of Harry’s ear and press a chaste kiss while lightly running his fingertips along the waist band of Harry’s pants.
“Draco, darling there you are we were beginning to wonder what had taken so long,” recognizing the voice of Missus Malfoy Harry tried to push aside the pounding in his ears as he could barely see the woman stand and approach her son.
“The potion confirmed that I’m Riddle’s heir, but didn’t explain how I am, we’ve scoured every book in the library that talks about being an heir and nothing explains how it’s possible,” Harry spoke, feeling the all too familiar wave of defeat wash over him.
Figuring there was no reason to stay any longer he made his way towards Charms, unbeknownst to him interested sets of eyes followed his movement.
“Mister Malfoy, I need you to take me to see Tom,” if the conversation wasn’t of such serious nature Harry would have chuckled at the complete loss of composure from the older Veela.
shrugging, Harry ran his fingers down Seviper’s scales and Harry could have sworn the snake cooed with delight.
“So Veela’s aren’t possessive?” she asked.
“Thank you, Professor,” he refrained from flinching as the Headmaster’s hand squeezed his shoulder.
“Goodnight Mister Malfoy, Mister Zabini,” and with that she was gone.
“It can be dangerous for more than one child to be claimed as an heir, early in wizarding history families could claim more than one but found that it was impossible to split things evenly. Tangible items were easier to divide but things such participating in the community became a challenge seeing as families were only allowed to send one individual for representation. That one individual would speak on behalf of the family and rarely did siblings ever agree with each other on community matters let alone who would be that individual representing the family. Just as adults couldn’t kill their heir and vice versa the same was found between children heirs. Fights broke out, assassination attempts were set into motion, and it was after many deaths that the wizarding world only allowed for one heir,” she took a breath.
Harry watched Draco’s retreating form with a grin, he didn’t even need their bond to know the Veela was annoyed.
“I don’t need saving, Malfoy, I can take care of myself,” both boys stared at each other without blinking, Malfoy snorted.
“You didn’t have to wait Harry,” grinning at his best friend he clocked a small package clutched in her hand.
“It sounded like she enjoyed it, according to the bits in her letter,” Harry hummed and felt relieved. He had told the snake that by no means was he to hurt either of the girls and he explained to Luna that magic was to be only used on the snake in a worst case situation; the girl had regarded her friend seriously and jotted down a handful of notes as Harry had explained what she needed to do.
“I felt like I had Apparated, had gone through the Floo, I was standing in front of Borgin and Burkes and it was raining; people were passing by and I went straight through them. Then, I was whizzing through the buildings, down the streets, and I was in a house…” Harry felt the nausea creep back up as he remembered what happened next, “Inside the room was Tom strapped to a table, he was crying out for the Professor to stop, there was a magical orb above him and when I looked to see who he was talking too, it was Dumbledore. He was using his wand and cutting, what I assume, was Tom’s magical core,” clenching his eyes shut tight Harry breathed slowly out of his nostrils as the urge to vomit rose, he didn’t shrug away the hand that began to rub his shoulders lightly.
Blaise and Draco entered shortly after looking amused with one another and Harry watched with a grin as the trio kept the conversation light while they waited for the train to depart.
“You’ll be able to flow to and from the Malfoy manor,” Draco said as they found an available bench in the courtyard, it was fairly empty as many of the students were filling the library to its capacity, or to the amount that Madam Pince could tolerate.
“They might have cheated when Flint was captain, but they haven’t since,” Harry defended which was his mistake as Ron whipped out his wand and aimed it at him.
Though before he could start the tedious task of listing off items a chuckle from behind him had him turning and looking into the sparkling eyes of the Headmaster.
The Veela had everything he could want and if he didn’t have something, he could easily get it. Harry knew clothes were out of the option, as he had awful taste, same with jewelry – not wanting to repeat a similar gift he had got the blonde for Christmas, but then his mind was blank.
“You’re cute if you think I’d let you leave tonight,” Harry let a bark of a laugh as Draco’s finger’s trailed his ticklish sides.
“Do you die if I reject the bond?” Harry could sense that the teen was holding back laughter but didn’t comment on it.
“Mister Potter,” squirming, he slowly looked up at the Professor, “While I’m less than happy to hear that you put my godson in the hospital wing I will say that Draco won’t denounce you as his mate just because of one incident,” as Harry adverted his eyes the man sighed once more.
“I think we need Hermione, Luna, and Neville,” he said carefully, as he watched for a reaction from both Draco and Blaise, as both appeared neutral, he relaxed his shoulders.
“It’s not a spell, or a potion, but Tom, I came here to talk to you about your memories,” he took a step forward as Tom’s face distorted.
Commotion coming from outside of the classroom was a needed distraction and tilting his head Harry picked up footsteps coming down the hallway.
Harry hummed and finished off the last of the food. Students were arriving tomorrow and despite everything he was excited to see his other friends return. As his stomach did a flip, he realized that now, more than ever, he needed his other friends to help him through this.
Harry burst out laughing as Luna let out a screech as a snowball landed on her. Neville pointed his own wand at the pile of snow and Harry ducked behind a tree grinning as he could hear the other two plot up against him.
Their steps were the only sounds on the cobbled pathway and periodically Draco’s mother would stop at a certain plant and breath in its scent. Her fingers would trail along the stone as her other hand clenched her shawl tightly around her.
“Most surely you were not Mister Potter, but congratulations on your bond with Draco,” she said, and Harry gave her a shaky smile.
“Well, Mister Potter, you’re able to withdrawal funds from our branch, have you considered a transaction pad?” Harry was confused and without saying it, Lockhead knew.
“Harry, my boy, how are you fairing?” the man spoke, and Harry relaxed his body as Draco had coached him and put up the barrier in his mind. It was a weak barrier, but Draco had been impressed nonetheless, he told him that as weak as it may be, he’d know if someone was trying to enter his mind.
“Yes, but I can’t imagine Tom would have made it this easy,” Harry controlled the urge to roll his eyes, “there is probably a spell surrounding the locket,” and with a flick of his wand Dumbledore attempted to remove the water to no avail.
“I want you gone, I want you no where near my son!” the voice had dropped an octave and as Harry glanced up at the man standing above him, he finally took note of his Veela characteristics on display.
He snagged an apple from the kitchen and bit into it with a moan as the crisp, tangy flavor hit his tongue. Having not ate anything since the previous day he was taking a risk with an apple, but he’d flirt with death so many times before, once more wouldn’t kill him.
With a shaky hand he waved his wand over the snake and waited with bile in his throat as a piece of parchment was summoned and words began to appear. All he recognized was that there was a heartbeat but the pounding in his head and ringing in his ears were distracting him from what was wrong.
“Maybe the ghosts at Hogwarts would know something?” he offered, and Harry tilted his head to the side shooting Draco a glance, the older Slytherin regarded Neville’s suggestion with interest.
Fennekitten.
Though now, Harry wasn’t in any position to listen to them talk as he dry-heaved in the boys bathroom, shivering and shaking as his body tried to throw up his insides. Draco hadn’t moved from his side and was whispering comforting words and as Harry began to stand up Draco had held under his arms as he swayed.
He wasn’t without his own marks and he rubbed the one on his hip with a hum. Walking around the bed he figured it would be smart to shower before meeting Draco’s parents once more. Poking at Draco’s shoulder the blonde didn’t move, and Harry rolled his eyes.
It was still bitter cold for it being the end of January, but the sun was out, so they were making the best of the slightly warmer temperature.
Students were chatting and Harry felt the familiar presence of Draco next to him as a fifth-year student came to check both him and Murphy over; he was an aspiring healer and had been given clearance to be stationed on the sideline for minor injuries.
“You found Salazar’s book? You left last night?” the tone was guarded, yet Harry was able to pick up the tinge of sadness laced in the words, not even needing to check their bond to know that Draco was feeling hurt at the idea that he put himself in danger.
“Draco, Blaise doesn’t mean any harm, he just wants to help, I bet he has a potion that could fix up my wrist, do you know which one he’d need?” Harry could feel Draco’s heartbeat pulse rapidly and the blonde clenched his silver Veela eyes shut; Harry could only assume he was battling his Veela side.
“What in Merlin’s name is going on!?” the cry from Madam Pince was perfect as the older woman got up from her desk and began casting spells on the enchanted item, Harry could see it on her face that she was petrified that she would hurt a book.
“And?” he prodded, he needed something to go off.
A cough brought the two out of their trance and Harry felt his ears warm as Hermione looked at them with a raised brow, Blaise smirking next to her.
“Blood rituals were banned because of the unlikeliness that it was to be successful and the potential harmful results when tried. The person attempting to pass on the heir title had to inject their blood into the intended person, while casting the spell, all without breaking their concentration; from my understanding this ritual varied in time to complete, which added to its level of difficulty. From what I’ve read, of all the attempts there have been only three successful tries,” she finished, and her eyes trailed up to Harry’s scar and he fidgeted, rarely any of his friends looked at it, she then pulled out a different book.
“Draco, Merope’s dead. I’m in a dream, it’s called a
“Fine, Hermione was over the moon about the Halloween feast preparations,” Harry gave a partial shrug.
“And what would happen if I accepted the bond?” Harry licked his lips which had gone very dry.
“Mister Zabini, I told you that Mister Malfoy needed his rest,” she sighed, her eyes immediately clocking the new visitor.
“Typically, no, yet with any potion if the dosage is too much or too little then there can be some imbalance with the results,” Hermione paused, cheeks slightly puffing, “It’ll take two hours to brew with these changes and the ingredients can be used in the after-class Potion’s lab,” her underlying question wasn’t missed.
“My Lord this is a very complex potion, according to the readings, Draco has completed it to near perfection,” Tom rose an eyebrow, “It was stirred for an extra minute the second week which would have made it more potent but not disrupted the final results.”
“He did, it’s one of his favorite accessories,” he said with a fond smile, which was completely true – Draco had a habit of making sure his pocket watch was always on him and had even charmed it unbreakable when he played Quidditch.
“Mother, I’m fine, and I will be fine,” Draco said with a crack in his voice and Harry’s heart leaped and he quelled the urge to offer him water.
Harry wasn’t interested in doing homework. The Horcruxes were still at the forefront of his mind and as his emerald eyes wandered the library, they landed on the large book sitting on a table near the library entrance.
“When I fell pregnant with our first child, we were ecstatic, his Veela side was so content that our family was growing. He was more protective than he had ever been. He got me anything that I needed, anything that I wanted,” her look turned bitter, “We were in the middle of the war, darker times then they are now, and I was attacked. We lost our first child. We were devastated, I was convinced that Lucius’ Veela would reject me as his mate, wouldn’t want anything more to do with me and for the longest time it seemed as if that was the end for us. Over time we healed, and when we started trying again for another child, I found out that the attack had left me with severe damage to my reproductive system. Draco was our miracle child, which is why Lucius is so protective of him, spoils him, everything. We were lucky just to have one child,” she said mournfully, and Harry understood better then why Mister Malfoy didn’t want his son anywhere near Tom, he didn’t want his son to get hurt, his only son.
Second, there is a heavy dose of
“Neufspuffs were coating his scales,” she said with a frown, “the sticks were coated with lavender to help soothe the irritation,” ignoring Draco’s incredulous look he gave the girl a warm smile.
“I vaguely remembered reading this over the summer, the book doesn’t talk about how to make the potion, but I can find the original recipe,” he said confidently, Harry beamed up at him.
“He wants to help me, Draco,” the tension was thick, and Harry could feel tendrils of his magic clash with the Veela’s.
It took a moment to register the clapping that was coming from the sides, turning to his left he shot Draco a grin who had returned it back.
“We’ve been best friends since we were young, we’ve always been protective of one another,” he murmured and Harry gave a bob of his head, heart clenching at the thought of Ron.
“Where do I come into this Professor?” Dumbledore hummed, stroking his beard once more.
It was when Draco asked him to pass him something for his hair that the blonde caught sight of Harry’s swollen and bruised wrist, grabbing his arm gently the blonde looked down at his mate with a mix of horror and fury at the injury. Harry blinked a handful of times and rotated it, wincing as it made a clicking noise and pain shot up his arm.
“Certain spells require a level of precise strength behind them for them to be accurate;
Looking at the top of his canopy he couldn’t find his friend nor underneath the closet. Turning towards his desk he felt his heart sink and beads of sweat pool at the base of his neck.
“RAVENCLAW!” The claps were light, Harry was convinced he saw Professor Flitwick shoot McGonagall a smug grin; Harry felt the anxious pit in his stomach grow.
As the body next to him shifted his eyes snapped towards Draco’s form, the teen seemed to be twitching slightly and the weight of what had happened the previous night struck at his heart.
“I have not been with a women, you are not my child,” Harry nodded.
As Harry sat down in one of the chairs nearest to the front of the classroom he watched as the Potions master sat at his desk with a raised brow. As the minutes ticked by Harry fidgeted in his seat and the man let out an exasperated sigh.
Harry watched as dozens of boys and girls were playing in one of the open areas; he was drawn to boy sitting away from the rest and scribbling in a black book. The boy looked lonely, he’d occasionally peak his head up and stare longingly at the other children playing.
Till we read again,
“Why don’t you tell me everything from the beginning,” she said and gripped at his arm and turned him towards a different path.
He had felt embarrassed that they hadn’t talked much about birthday’s, especially since none of his were memorable, until Draco had bemoaned about his parents plan for his birthday celebration at the manor two weeks after term ended.
“What is this magic that you can’t be killed?” he whispered, and Harry chuckled.
Three consecutive drops of blood in the same place.
“Draco,” he murmured, laying down next to the Veela he ran his fingertips lightly over the blonde’s cheek, gently grazing over his collar bone, and finally putting the weight of his hand on his mate’s hip. Tucking his head into Draco’s shoulder he found himself closing his eyes and quickly falling asleep.
groaning in frustration as the Veela’s wand sailed above his head he vaguely heard the clatter of it from behind him.
Calming his rapid heartbeat Harry furrowed his brows and nodded seriously.
There was a lengthy pause.
Spying two students in the corner Harry made a beeline for them as he headed back to his room; he recognized it as two of the first years, Esmelda and Anderson.
Luna led the group to the courtyard and Harry shot her a beaming smile; she somehow knew that he didn’t want to the crowd in the Great Hall.
