So he headed downstairs into the kitchen to make breakfast, instead. A ridiculous breakfast, a couple of steps beyond a full English; bacon, sausages, eggs, mushrooms, hash browns, toast, spinach, and a little bowl of baked beans in case Draco hated anything wet touching his toast, like Harry did. Tea, coffee, orange juice, pumpkin juice. He took an enormous tray up to the room, levitating it ahead of himself, and set it on the side table, casting warming charms on the food and the mugs and cooling charms on the juices. And then he headed into his workshop, battling alternating waves of anticipation and trepidation.
,” he called, clear as a bell. From the tip of his wand, silver smoke poured, and an enormous hare leapt around the courtyard and then disappeared into the trees. Harry laughed out loud; Draco’s lips barely curved as he watched the hare’s antics. Long and strong and noble. Draco turned to Harry, the smile gone from his face, and shook his head. He looked at the wand in his hand. “I’ve never cast a real, corporeal
Mrs Malfoy’s voice was terribly gentle, when she prodded him along. “What are you trying to say, Harry? Don’t worry about the words — just try to say what you mean.”
over the gaslights and the room looked brighter immediately. Of course, that meant the utter filth of the place was now impossible to ignore. “Sort of.”
“I don’t know how you ever forgave me for leaving,” Ron said. “I don’t think I ever will. I don’t think Hermione ever could.”
“I hate that you can read everything I don’t want to say on my face. I know I wear my heart on my sleeve. But I swear you can read my thoughts, too.”
On the other end of the bench, Blaise laughed, and tossed his head over the back of his neck. “You’re an odd one, Harry Potter,” he said. “And please don’t tell Hermione about this. She has nothing to do with it, and she’s a hair puller.”
Draco shrugged. “Invite her sometime. Mother wouldn’t mind. It’s not like someone as obsessed with books and reading would hurt anything in here.”
“Well first of all, I don’t think that’s regulation length,” Ron said, as he and Hermione frowned at it. Hermione picked it up, and gave a little wave. Her face startled with recognition.
“Her,” Harry said. “And her name is Dora. For Tonks. Apparently she has already shown an alarming tendency to change colour when she is plotting something. Isn’t that terrific?”
Harry raised his eyebrows pointedly. “No, I just like to cradle this tosh in my lap from time to time. Next time I get chocolates in the post, I’ll give them to you, I promise. Is that really what you came to talk about?”
“Tell me again about the one-eyed cat,” she said, with a yawn. “He lives on this block? I can’t believe I’ve never met him. Perhaps I need to slow down as well.”
he ever dated a bloke. Not like he’d have found the time, really, and if he had I don’t think he could’ve kept it a secret, and really, why would he? It’s not the 19
Potter fumbled in the pocket of his robe. His robe, at least, Draco was pleased to note, was new and well-cut, well-sewn, and properly pressed. He could have made an effort to look a little less bleak, though. “I need some potion ingredients,” he said, but he didn’t hand over the parchment. Draco held his hand out for it, waiting.
But she was up the stairs, and Ron was only a moment behind her, and Hermione shot Harry an apologetic look. “You should have owled," she said. “You know what those two are like, Harry…”
Draco hesitated. “He’s my patient,” he answered primly. “I care for all of them. Goodbye, Minister.”
“If the Weasel can behave, so can I.” Draco turned, then. Snow had caught in Harry’s hair, and on the shoulders of his robe. “I could even learn his name, if I put some effort into it. Write it on a bit of parchment for me and I’ll look at it each day,” he said, reaching out to run his fingertips over Harry’s shirt where his robes parted. He met Harry’s eyes, wide and green and hungry. “I didn’t say this would be easy. Or that we’d figure everything out overnight. Your question has to be, is it worth it? Tell me, Harry — do you want me?”
“You wanted to ask me something,” Hermione said. She looked tired. Draco would have wagered that the revelations of the night before had robbed her of her sleep, but he didn’t ask.
Draco spun on the heel of his tattered old Converse sneakers but the urgency of the movement wasn’t reflected in his expression, which was equal parts cold and murderous.
“How do you take your tea?” Mrs Malfoy asked, waving a wand lazily at the tea service on the sideboard.
And then, on Saturday night, when Harry arrived at the Hog’s Head with Neville and half of the faculty Draco was just on his way out.
“You don’t have to belong to anyone but yourself anymore, Harry,” Draco murmured, into Harry’s robe, his skin. “Please. I don’t know the words that will get through to you. Please, Harry.
That evening, by the time Harry was sitting at the Head table beside Draco, he was fit to burst. The afternoon had dragged on terribly, not least because he’d spent lunch time with Professor McGonagall discussing the possibility of a Duelling Club, and talking through the rules that would need to be set in place. He had been almost too excited to notice her expression, cool and appraising, and had dismissed almost out of hand her question of who might assist him.
Draco indicated a chair by the fire, as if this was his room, and not Harry’s, but Harry really didn’t mind. He turned the air so that he was facing Draco a little more, and after a sip of his wine, he set it on the end table (he had an
Poor fucking Neville ended up bearing the brunt of Draco’s ridiculous mood. Poor fucking Neville, whose life at Hogwarts in the years before Draco had arrived must have been much more peaceful than it had been since. Draco had more or less dragged him from his quarters near the greenhouse down to the Hog’s Head and shouted at him for about two hours about everything that came to mind.
“And you were upset. You’d been crying. I can’t remember for the life of me why it was, can you?” He chewed on his lip; it really didn’t matter. Funny thing to forget, though. “You told me to fuck off, but I didn’t. We talked a while, and you said something unconscionably rude about me staring at your mouth — maybe you asked me if there was something between your teeth. So I kissed you. The end,” he said, tightening his arm across Draco’s back.
Amelia Hubbard was her name. In her first year, she had annoyed Draco rather a lot. He wanted to shake her, sometimes, and ask why she wouldn’t pay attention; but being as he was afraid that if he couldn’t curb his temper he would lose this teaching post, he carefully reigned it in. Within a few weeks he had cajoled her into trusting him a little bit, but she remained an appalling student, caught often between moments of such terror the she didn’t seem able to hear Draco, let alone do anything that had been asked of her, and then trying to catch up so quickly that she would miss instructions and misread ingredients.
“Thank you, Malfoy,” Harry said, teeth clenched together, not actually snorting smoke like a dragon but near enough. He turned back to Narcissa. “I apologise, Mrs Malfoy. It does look much better. Very nice. I’ve never been very good at…”
He found himself thinking about the conversation he’d had with Hermione. About… dating. Fuck, what a terrible thought, but while Harry could insist to Hermione that he wasn’t lonely, he couldn’t deny it to himself. He was lonely, but the thought of dressing up and heading to a Muggle bar and finding someone to waste a few lovely hours with didn’t feel right.
Harry had been grading a stack of papers — quite cheerfully, his students were doing well, for the most part — when he heard a knock on the door of his room, behind the defence classroom. Knock might have been generous, actually; someone was pounding their fist, and Harry’s gut twisted.
Narcissa waited patiently. Draco saw the slight downturn of the corner of her mouth that suggested she was very disappointed to be back to ‘Mrs Malfoy’ already, but he guessed Harry wouldn’t adjust to something like that very quickly.
They had another party on New Year’s Eve. Harry surprised himself by inviting Pansy, and she surprised him by agreeing to come, and she brought Blaise with her, who didn’t look surprised at all when Pansy punched him in the dick for not telling her he’d been here before.
“Some of my students approached me this morning,” he said. “About a Duelling Club. They want to start one again.”
“I might take you up on that,” he said, and the fact that he did not intend to must have showed on his face because Draco’s eyes flashed disappointment for a moment.
Draco rolled his eyes. “I’m not in the habit of reading other people’s mail,” he said airily, thrusting the envelope into Harry’s hand.
Appetisers appeared at the tables, and Harry suddenly realised how hungry he was; he had been so focused on his speech that he had forgotten to eat breakfast or lunch. He wasn’t concerned, but he was glad to have an appetite, because as much as he loathed Robards on a personal level the man knew how to get an event catered. Plus, Hermione was a bully who used her power for god: Ministry events had to be catered by unionised, freed house-elves.
Draco leaned forward until his forehead rested on Harry’s shoulder. He rested. He waited for Harry’s arms to encircle his shoulders, and they did. Young, and small, and then older, and stronger, and they were tangled together impossibly.
“Yes, thank you. I’ll be heading back to Hogwarts in two days so that Professor Bennett can spend some time with her family in Nice, but in the meantime, it’s been quite pleasant.” He was very formal, but this house always seemed to demand it.
must have such a hard time of it when the weather is cold. People have prejudice against delicious cold food just because it’s cold outside.”
to spend the afternoon beating yourself up. If it wouldn’t offend, I’d like to suggest a couple of therapists in London who might be able to help you.”
“You can read, right? Only I’m not sure you should have accepted a teaching post if you can’t.” He handed the envelope back to Harry, who looked at it as if it might contain a Howler after all. “It’s addressed to you.”
“I believe you’re missing an adjective, Potter,” Draco suggested guilelessly. Harry looked at him in wide-eyed panic. “Those are the
“Can you show me, Harry?” he asked, and reached across to take Harry’s arm. Perhaps he could heal it. He knew enough wandless healing spells. He’d even created some.
Draco shrugged. “I heard you were friends, that’s all.” He pulled a drawer open, and flipped through the files. He didn’t really care about any of them. This wasn’t a potion gone wrong or a misfired hex. Harry had decided to get down low and stay there, but Draco needed the time to poke around in his office.
Task completed, Draco sat in front of his desk for a few more minutes. He had a new journal for his findings, and at the top of the page, he wrote the date. He had two aims, for this session; to try to buy some more time, and to convince Harry to open one of the doors.
Harry thought about begging off Sunday lunch at the Weasleys’, but knew if he did, Hermione would show up wanting to know why. And Molly would send him a mournful note about how it wasn’t the same when he wasn’t there. Sunday morning found him hesitating by the downstairs Floo while his eyes were drawn over and over again to the upstairs landing. Draco had only just emerged for his morning pot of tea and to cast an eye over the Daily Prophet.
the privilege that being Granger’s ‘consultant’ afforded him. He spent most of the afternoon in a meeting room, interviewing Potter’s colleagues about the weeks before he’d fallen asleep, and something told him that the way the room was set up made them less inclined toward subterfuge.
Probably, almost anyone who had ever known him before the age of twenty would have imagined that his life would be full of colour and splash and ill-advised ideas, and above all, hedonism. And that had actually been the entire plan, before the war. Before he had watched how people had survived the war, or not. Draco getting dragged along with his father’s disasters, the false bravado with which he’d taken the Dark Mark. Pansy volunteering to offer Harry Potter up to the Dark Lord. The way people had fought. He’d even surprised himself. When most of Slytherin House had been marched downstairs to the dungeons he had managed to stay behind. He hadn’t really decided that he was going to take a side, and in fact, there was a part of him that was appalled that he hadn’t just accepted the offer to go and hide in the dungeons where he’d be safe, committed as he was to his own self-interest. Instead he had found himself defending a number of the younger students from the Carrows. And he’d walked out of the battle alive, and feeling genuinely proud of himself for the first time in his entire life.
“You poor sod,” Draco said, at last, turning away. “Adored by millions. Free chocolate all the time. What a burden to bear. Next time the world needs saving, I’ll do it. Neville, you’ll help, won’t you?”
“Mr Malfoy — Mr Potter has too kind a heart. Can you tell the Wizengamot, under Veritaserum, whether you recognised your classmate at that time?”
The trio moved in to Grimmauld place once again. It made sense. It was easy for Ron and Harry to get to the Ministry for their Auror training and easy for Hermione to get to school. There were plenty of rooms, so Hermione could also have a nice quiet study, once they had finished renovating one for her; an airy, light-filled room with a view over the distant gardens, an owl perch outside and an enchanted kettle so that Hermione didn’t have to leave the room to make tea when she was on a roll.
He had begun to fall into a habit of working on several wands at a time, letting the wood and the core merge before it was time to return to them and discover what they were supposed to be, how they were supposed to feel.
“You could have anybody you wanted. Someone easy. Undamaged. Me, I’m still a mess. I have nightmares, Draco. If I’m not paying close enough attention to my emotions, which by the way are all over the shop on a good day and downright dangerous on a bad one, I spew accidental magic like a toddler. I —”
What would happen next — well, fuck. No one could really predict these things. Draco brushed Harry’s hair away from his forehead, and kissed it. And then he pressed his own forehead against Harry’s, so he could taste Harry’s breath, feel the weakening hum of his magic.
, one where he didn’t intend to wake up until every part of himself was good and ready, one where he intended to wander down to the beach for a long swim as soon as the weather had warmed up, one where he intended to take a book to one of his favourite vineyard restaurants and spend an extremely lazy afternoon eating cheese and cured meats and slowly sipping wine.
“Do you have a hobby?” Harry asked, innocently. “Other than gazing at yourself adoringly in the mirror? It probably doesn’t leave you a lot of time for much else.”
He barely tasted the food, but still declared it the best Sunday dinner ever. He produced a cake that had been brought by a grateful customer a few days prior and they mowed through most of that, as well. And then Hermione said she needed to finish an assignment before class the next day, which Ron and Ginny took to mean she was hustling them out the door. Which she was. To Harry’s relief, and apparently, Draco’s as well.
Teddy frowned, and tried to think through it all. He bit his lip, and his hair turned a soft violet. He eventually seemed to make up his mind, though. “Yes,” he said, nodding at Draco. “And you can come.”
Hermione snorted, and stood up. “I think I need a break from all of this,” she said. “Can someone please sneak something starchy into Pansy’s mouth while her mouth is hanging open?”
Harry clamped a hand over his mouth. Andromeda did the same, and turned away. Draco crouched on the ground in front of Teddy.
“You got much, much better at sarcasm.” Harry raised a hand and Hermione offered him a listless high five. “So, it’s the next big adventure, right?”
He rather enjoyed Potter’s stunned expression when he pushed the door closed and locked it again with a satisfying swish and click.
Draco looked pointedly at the fire, and Harry realised he didn’t even know where his wand was. Chastised, he closed his mouth.
“I forgot to thank your mother,” Harry said, much too formally, and apparently having forgotten he’d thanked her several times. “I shall owl her before I go to bed.”
“Everything was… everything was normal,” Auror Lisbon was saying. She looked confused by the questions. “I’m new, you know, only been an Auror three years. He’s so good to me. My partner’s been off work, her wife had a baby and for a few weeks there, if I was needed for fieldwork, Harry — Auror Potter — was joining me. Until he went to… wherever he is now. You’re not — he’s not under investigation, is he?”
“And Miscellaneous?” Draco added, helpfully. Harry snorted. Bonnie stiffened. Maybe it was time for the juvenile delinquents of the faculty to start rethinking the House system.
“There are many, many ways to help people, Mr Potter. Some of them don’t require one to put one’s life on the line every day. Perhaps you should be thinking further afield.”
Harry had neither the emotional bandwidth nor the attention span for creative work, not just then. He took up a wand that he’d been working on, probably the largest he’d ever made, and some fine-grained sandpaper. He already knew that there would be a shine to this wand; the wood was a dark red, almost black, and so beautifully responsive to his work that he could feel it hum with satisfaction under his fingers.
“My mother says you saved the world,” a boy in the back who reminded Harry a great deal of Ernie MacMillan called loudly.
“First of all — no non-verbal magic, and no wandless magic. It’s not fair on the children. They can’t do it. Most of them have no chance whatsoever of ever mastering either of those things, so seeing it won’t teach them a thing.”
Draco thought about the cupboard under the stairs. He remembered the bruised shoulder, the tiny boy dragging a stepping stool to the kitchen sink, his eyes glazed, ignoring his pain. Basilisk venom and dying in the Forbidden Forest. All of those rooms in the house with no windows; no, Harry hadn’t had the easiest life.
And in the meantime, Harry was busy. Training four Seekers (he thought it was only fair to train them all, as he wasn’t the head of any house, and didn’t want to advantage anyone). He had seven grades worth of essays and assorted homework to read, and mark, and discuss with some students. Duelling Club, of course, and preparing for Duelling Club, and thinking about the sparkle in Draco Malfoy’s eyes at Duelling Club —
“What was the best thing?” Blaise asked. Not in that way he had sometimes where he was asking a question to hide the fact that he was making a point. No, this was pure Zabinian curiosity.
The Defence Against the Dark Arts classroom was much as Harry remembered, if it bore the marks of repair. He had forgotten the door carefully hidden in the back that led to a clean, warm suite; small, but perfectly adequate. A bed in the corner, a couch and two armchairs (as if he intended to entertain) and a desk for his work. He had been in this room once before, with Remus, and it saddened him to know the man was lost to him.
For a moment, Draco froze in place. His mother’s owl? But no, that was impossible, because Narcissa had been gone for five years, almost, and her owl had disappeared as soon as she was in the ground. Still, the resemblance was uncanny.
“No,” Harry said. “It just… still doesn’t feel right. I can’t believe I got through the school year with it, but the Auror conducting our training did some measurements and isn’t happy with it at all.”
“Now, off you go to lunch,” Harry said. “And don’t imagine for a second that anyone who is not doing well in my class will be allowed to participate.”
Close to four o’clock in the afternoon, his mother opened the door to his rooms, and swept inside. Of course she was able to breeze past his wards; he’d learned them all from her.
Sleeping in his office had always been a very poor reflection on Harry’s life choices but now, it would be humiliating, as well.
“But there was this… I mean, at school. I told you he had an enemy, right? Only they were sort of obsessed with each other. Sometimes it seemed like…”
She leaned across the space and took his head in her great hands. “Two weeks notice. And rather than work them, you should take some of the leave you are owed. You will need supplies, and time to move to the castle. It is time to go,
He leaned his elbows on the railing, and Blaise rested his arse against it, rubbing his hands together to keep them warm.
Draco felt slightly ill. He had worked so hard not to be suspicious of everyone he ever met. How the fuck had he… but he kept his mouth closed.
And if Potter — Harry — never got an opportunity to see that Draco had changed, then Draco might never learn how he had, either.
. He’d have to be very careful with the reptile house, of course. Draco wondered if he had full control over his magic back yet. If he was being careful when he slept. If anyone was making sure he ate. If anyone was making sure he
Hermione startled, and grabbed Harry’s hand, pressing it to her stomach again, the way she had before.
The cemetery was cold and damp, but silent. Draco pushed himself to his feet and rubbed at his knee, where he had landed on a sharp stone or something. Apparently he’d drawn blood. Good thing it was a dream.
The days and nights ran together. Ollivander had never quite recovered his stock levels after the shop had been destroyed in the war, and Harry worked long hours trying to build their supplies up again. While the shop was open, Harry taught Ellie how to ring up the purchases and package up the wands while he focused in helping the children connect with one. He listened to the children quietly telling him their fears about not knowing anyone at Hogwarts, not making friends, not being in Ravenclaw like their mum had been or Hufflepuff like their dad. Some of them came back again a couple of times before the school year started just to have the same soothing conversations with Harry a second time, and a third.
The stairs didn’t creak; the portraits on the wall alongside them greeted him warmly. Harry wasn’t sure that he could keep looking at it all. Certainly he didn’t think he could keep looking at it while Hermione was looking at him.
Ron and Hermione knew, too, and Molly Weasley. But Harry didn’t want anyone else to know. Certainly not Draco Malfoy, who had been born with a silver spoon in his mouth and only gave it up to swap for a gold one. Who had probably refused to eat when he didn’t like the food the house elves had prepared.
Harry had no earthly idea what those were, but he smiled agreeably. He fed the school owl a morsel and whispered in her ear, and she was gone.
Harry marked days on a calendar, not with crosses but with ticks. He wrote things down, places he’d been, wonderful moments that he had experienced. People he had spoken to, if they said anything that interested him, even for a moment.
This was the sort of rivalry they should have enjoyed at school. This was a better sort of feud. They shouted at each other across the sky, daring each other to dizzying heights of sheer idiocy; bragging and taunting and hurling vicious insults, almost skimming the top of the lake and making hair-pin turns of the sort Draco hadn’t even attempted since he was a seeker, about a thousand years (and one war) ago.
“Come and see, Potter,” he said. Potter’s hair was sticking up even more in the back but if it was possible, he looked at least two degrees closer to sane with almost an hour of rest under his belt. He climbed clumsily off the comfortable armchair and followed Draco to the work bench to watch him add the final ingredient, passionflower oil.
“Thought about this,” Draco said. “Thought about this for years. Thought about you when I was wanking in the Slytherin dormitories —”
Harry didn’t answer and he didn’t need to. They all knew that it would never be over, not really, not for those who had survived it.
Draco offered a polite smile. “You’re so full of shit that those green eyes of yours have begun to turn a fetching shade of brown, Potter.” Neville snorted. “You didn’t tell me you were out of Dreamless Sleep.”
“How many hours did you spend spelling those flashing badges?” Draco flushed. “And did you make your own Dementor costume, or did you have it made at Madame Malkins’?”
It wasn’t really Harry’s kind of music. Not because it was Muggle, but because he preferred music that didn’t prevent people from talking to each other. Give him a couple of guys with acoustic guitars and dirty hair any day. But there was something compelling about them. He found himself staring at the guitar player’s back. Narrow and lean, but his arms were strong; his leather pants hung dangerously from his hips and his black tank top (which looked to have been ripped beneath one arm) made his pale neck look terribly fragile. All of him looked fragile, actually, except those arms; Harry could see where his ribs cut in, and his wrists were as fine and breakable as one of Harry’s more delicate wands. He was covered in tattoos, which Harry had briefly mistaken for a mesh shirt. They were all black, with what looked like a mess of thorny vines tangled around his arms, teasing the hair on the back of his neck.
There was laughter in Blaise’s voice, but his eyes were warm and sincere, when he looked up from Hermione’s hand to her face. “Blaise Granger has a ring to it.”
Harry felt a touch of unease as he climbed reluctantly out of bed. He pulled on a pair of old sweatpants that he knew Draco hated (“Muggle rags”) but that he also knew made Draco stare at his arse, and he was going to get a shag after breakfast if he had to strip naked and wiggle said arse in Draco’s face.
“I love you,” he promised. “And in here, I think you love me, too. That’s why I can let go. I don’t need anything else. After all of this… I got
Draco turned back to him, his cheeks flushing slightly. With pleasure, with embarrassment, Harry couldn’t be sure.
“I know you can be hard to see, but I think we both know I’m well trained and remarkably powerful,” Harry said. “I’ve done my best, the last couple of weeks, to be respectful, since I assume you’re here to watch me for Hermione’s sake — or under her orders, though I hope that’s not the case — but I think it’s time we stopped pretending you’re not stalking me.”
“I see your paranoia hasn’t been dulled by years of hunting out dark wizards,” he said, at last, and Potter’s eyes snapped up, almost apologetic. “I’m really not intending to poison you, though your distrust is well-earned.”
Harry was absorbed in a book over breakfast. He had taken to reading because it made him eat more slowly, and he hated the way Draco still eyed him sometimes, looking to see if Harry would curl his arm protectively around his plate. Even if they were getting along well, there was a part of Harry that regretted, terribly, having told Draco about his childhood. It meant there would always be one big exposed nerve there, even if he trusted Draco not to poke at it.
He led Harry to a small parlour with a writing desk and some bookshelves — fiction, Harry noticed to his surprise. One door led to a bedroom (Harry, embarrassed, stepped away from it) and another to a bathroom with dimensions that made no mathematical sense and had a bathtub about three times the size of Harry’s old cupboard.
But maybe he had. Harry could have counted on one hand the number of people who had touched him intimately since he and Ginny had broken up, what felt like a thousand years ago.
“I do,” Blaise said. “Several of them, and you’re playing clueless just as sure as you’re procrastinating, but it’s alright — I do get it. I’m saying two things. And they are things I’ll never discuss with my extraordinary fiancée, just so you know.
Harry reached absently for his wand, but couldn’t find it right away. He gestured in the direction of the kitchen and Hermione’s teeth ached for a moment, until the unmistakable sound of a kitchen obediently making tea filtered through the house. “I’ve got it.”
Harry didn’t see Malfoy until Sunday night. He looked better; still pale, but he was, after all, a Malfoy.
“You’re a much better actor than you were in school,” Blaise answered, lifting his hood. “More tea?”
Draco stepped closer. Harry didn’t seem to respond. Not with anger, not even with the tell-tale tension that usually seized his shoulders when he was distressed. Draco sat tentatively on the edge of the bed and reached for Harry’s hand, but Harry drew into himself and Draco stopped trying.
He wasn’t at all surprised when the owl returned in the morning, delivering a letter from his mother. He slipped it into his robes and moved to unfold the Daily Prophet. He heard an irritated growl to his right, and immediately saw why;
He thought about Blaise, for about eight seconds, and then realised he really, really couldn’t. He thought about Draco, and slipped his hand into his pyjama pants, softly rolling his cock in his hand, coaxing it to fullness. And then he heard it:
“Well, he never asked me for an autograph or tried to sneak me a love potion.” Harry glanced up, embarrassed, and then looked down at his clasped hands again. “Maybe it was easier to imagine that if we were together, he’d make me feel special for
Draco served himself small portions of almost everything in front of him, listening to Neville natter on about a trip he’d taken to the Dead Sea to collect samples of dead plants and work out how exactly it was that they all behaved so very much like they were alive. Ordinarily, Draco would have been intrigued; the medicinal applications could be tremendously important. This evening, though, he was struck by the rather distressing observation that Harry Potter had not developed any sort of manners in the twelve years since they’d endured a final year together at Hogwarts. One arm curled possessively around the plate, and he shovelled the food into his mouth at an alarming rate.
repeatedly from January first until he brought her there one weekend and showed her that the place was as clean and airy as anything she could have imagined, that no scrap of darkness clung to the corners of the rooms. He’d showed her how Teddy could have a good large playroom and if, as they worried, he began to change on the full moon when he turned eleven, they could set aside a safe room for him.
Hermione smiled. “Well, I do. But you shouldn’t be hasty.” She tapped her wand against the watch on her wrist, bringing up the following day’s schedule. “I have a deal for you. Tomorrow I’ll come home early. And we’ll go and visit Number Twelve together. And then… then you can make a decision.”
Draco nodded. “Children soak up prejudice like tiny sponges, just as easily as they soak up favourite Quidditch teams and poor grammar.”
He fire-called Hermione again, feeling ill. Some previously un-described mixture of anticipation and sheer bloody terror, because he had no idea what to expect.
“These pies really are fantastic,” Harry said, avoiding Hermione’s eyes and cutting savagely into the crust.
Hermione felt a powerful flash of anger. “Ginevra Weasley — I am exhausted, I am wrung out, I’ve been racing back and forth between London and Naples for weeks, now; I have probably slept six hours in the last three nights and my best friend, to whom we all owe our lives over and over again, is trapped in a dream he constructed because he — because… because he needed a fucking
“Then a nice Slytherin boy — I suppose you’d like to see me deliriously happily married to Blaise Zabini.”
Harry grinned. “Come off it, Draco. I need another teacher to help, and you can’t deny, we duelled brilliantly. We’re so different. You’re so agile and sneaky, and that’s really the only thing that works against…”
“I love you to ask me for the things you want,” he murmured, with his lips brushing over the shell of Harry’s ear. “I love to give you the things you want. I promise I’ll make it so good, Harry, darling.
“And I wished you’d been sorted into Slytherin, because I’d picked you out to be my best friend before I ever got on the train when we were eleven. And I envied you, and I admired you.”
He made his way to the Great Hall, watching as it filled up with children. They seemed to be younger every year; it was impossible for Draco to imagine he had ever been so small. Even so, he felt a warm surge of protectiveness.
They ate in silence for a while, and Harry found that once he had a little food in his stomach he was actually quite hungry. He took his time, though, unwilling to press his luck. The cold hum of humiliation needed to remain a hum, and not become a roar.
What if he could include a charm in the wood that would prevent the user from causing harm? Was that even ethical?
Parvati seemed to take several seconds to decide that Hermione wasn’t in danger from any of the elves, and nodded curtly, stepping outside and closing the door.
Harry’s scent had shifted slightly, as if escaping from the dream had brought something of his usual self back to the surface.
“I’d prefer to at least do it somewhere we’re less likely to be observed by Mother’s very sophisticated guests. Or Mother,” he added, though in truth he thought she would probably just silently slip upstairs to the library and start enquiring about wedding venues in June. He groaned and he felt Harry’s sharp little teeth in his lower lip, and his hips shifted forward.
, if we were in love, a happy couple sharing a life. What we’d say to each other. If I couldn’t sleep, or in the morning after I’d slept badly, I might lie with my eyes closed and imagine waking up with him. What he’d smell like, how we’d touch each other. I liked it. Sometimes it felt a lot more real than the hours that I spent as an Auror. I’d dream about it, as well. Wake up with a smile on my face, instead of… well.”
“I’m going to marry you,” Harry said into Draco’s throat, fingers digging into his hips and arse. Draco would be covered in these fingertip bruises the next day. No, for the rest of his life, because Harry would keep putting them back long whenever they started to fade. “D’you know that, Draco? I’m going to make you my husband.”
jeans. You’re hitting a bar or two. I suppose we’ll see you in the morning, whenever you manage to extricate yourself from some cheap Muggle flat in Camden.”
The first week or so, Harry felt he was managing quite admirably. Pepper-up potion and coffee seemed to keep him going in the absence of good quality sleep.
“Sounds like it,” Draco said, with a sigh, making a note. “What about you? Have you ever worked with him on a case?”
“I’m awake, Hermione. Every day that I’m awake and not working, the anxiety about what I’m missing gets worse. Let me have this.”
It had been a long time since he’d last been laid. Other than… well, he really wasn’t sure if that counted, though the memory of Harry’s eyes on him in the kitchen was enough to make Draco’s cock stir again. Already, like he was a fucking teenager.
So: being busy, staying busy, holding loved ones close and watching the Prophet for news of the trials meant that for most people, the nightmares began to fade.
“It’s strange, you know,” Harry said, opening the doors to a small balcony off the side of the bedroom. It was bitterly cold outside, but he cast a silent warming charm that made Blaise purr. “I started doing this place up because it’s mine. It’s mine because my godfather gave it to me. But it wasn’t a happy home for him, and now I realise I just fixed it up because I needed something to occupy me, right after the war when things were so spectacularly shitty.”
Draco climbed to his feet, and walked around the small mosaic coffee table that one of his patients had made him. She was an artist, a rather talented one. He took the other end of the settee and settled himself on it, leaning in.
Maybe that was all there was to it. They’d lost so many people, friends. Those never aged a day, never would. What right did Draco or anyone have to grow up, to recover, when Crabbe never even had a resting place?
Molly was quiet, blending the pudding ingredients, and then she pushed the bowl to Harry. He wasn’t sure why she didn’t have the spoon set to mix the batter itself but he enjoyed doing it.
Draco was already eating his supper, a book in one hand, when Harry took his seat. He was almost too excited to eat, but he was too hungry to ignore it, and he served himself quickly.
face, Draco. You don’t know what that face can do to a man. Enough of it and your bones would melt, I reckon. It’s worked on me my whole life and it’ll work on me when she’s long in the ground and her portrait makes that face at me from the wall. Though I don’t see it so much, these days.”
It was one of Harry’s, and a pretty thing. White oak and unicorn hair with a small rose quartz set into the handle. She looked dubious, but Harry smiled reassuringly, and she gave it a wave, making a sound of utter delight when rose-coloured sparks flowed from the end. “How does that feel?”
“What time is Blaise getting here? I’m dying to taste the steak in this stew. I’m fairly sure it will fall apart on the fork, it’s so tender, and he makes the most
Harry sat on the stone bench in the courtyard and gently petted the stray cat who had recently decided she enjoyed his company. She ate a tin of sardines and purred in his lap for a while before heading off to chase butterflies, leaving Harry to his tea.
“Er, no thanks. Not something I intend to collect on.” He looked like he had something else to say, but he left off. As Draco was beginning to enjoy Potter being too exhausted to behave like a right git, he elected to leave it for another day. No Malfoy would walk around with a life debt uncollected upon, but he did feel every so slightly sorry for the prat, just then.
“Mr Potter,” he said. He reached for the wand, found its centre of balance, and gave it a regal little wave. “Exquisite work, my boy. Exquisite.” He brought the end of the wand to his eye, looking down toward the tip. Harry knew it was a wand that needed to be straight and it was. Ollivander’s hand shook a little. He passed the wand reverently back to Harry.
“I’ve been in love with Luna Lovegood since she brought me a pocket full of dirigible plum seeds,” Neville said, with a sigh. “She’d cleaned them up, and all, and showed me how to sprout them. But I’ve never even asked her to tea. I only see her when Harry has a party…”
“I’m in no rush. The Minister said if I want to waste a little time poking in corners, you could go home. Or back to work in that marvellous shop of yours. She showed me a photograph of your daughters — they are a lovely pair. Congratulations.”
Harry rolled Draco’s trouser legs up very gently, as Draco couldn’t really use his hands yet. “Not so bad.” He returned to the soothing spell.
“I’m simply speechless with shock. You? You’re the very definition of easy-going, Harry. Who would find working alongside the Saviour to be challenging?”
“My Mind Healer says I need something to do,” Harry told Ron and Hermione as they sat on the back steps, a few days into the new year. Hermione sat a step lower than Ron, resting between his thighs, periodically re-casting her warming charms; Hermione’s magic felt like summer air against Harry’s cold cheeks. It was nicer to sit outside and look at the snow without having to be cold than it was being stuck inside all the time.
Harry nodded with a professional distance that Draco hated. He looked like he was having a conversation with one of his actress escorts at a Ministry function. Attempting to reach a carriage unmolested, perhaps.
“You may not use any spells, charms, jinxes or hexes that are not on this list. Anyone using a curse will never set foot in this room again, and don’t imagine for a moment that you will sneak one by without us knowing. The moment you stepped into this room, you had a brand new trace on you. No curses,” he reiterated.
“Last summer when you got into that fight. I think — and tell me if I’m wrong — I think that was the last time you ever headed out to, uh, sow your wild oats.” She blushed loudly. “Did something happen, that night? I know Muggles can be…”
Harry poked Draco’s ribs, mean as a snake. “You’re really alright with this, though? I do feel like I… talked you into it. Just a bit.”
“I want you to fuck me, Draco. Hard. I want you... I want you to hold me down and make me feel it. I want you to bite my shoulder, and whisper in my ear. Take me out of my head, Draco,” Harry begged, even as Draco pulled back, to kneel on the bed, hooking Harry’s legs over his thighs, exposing that hungry little hole of his.
“I didn’t say that.” Hermione spoke very carefully, and slowly, which made it sound like she thought Harry might not understand what she was saying. But Harry knew her much too well. “What I was trying to say — Ron? Would you like some more pie?”
Harry had, at some point in the last couple of weeks, modified his wards to allow Draco through. Draco had seized upon this as an open invitation to show up at any time, though he was carefully treading the line between charmingly irksome and just plain annoying. Tonight, Harry just smiled at him, and gestured at the teapot on the end table.
Hermione was probably appalled, but Harry just hugged the tiny, wizened old elf back. He hadn’t realised quite how much he missed him.
’? He sat up abruptly, wrapping his arms around Draco’s body with Draco seated firmly over his thighs.
“I think I should probably start making arrangements to head back to London,” Harry said, on a sigh. “I know you’ve said — but I’ve been intruding here for months. I can get back to light duties.”
“Yes,” she said. “I’ll be back next weekend to finish up. And he’s on his way here to join us for a drink, so you might smarten your hair up a little. There’s plenty of time to discuss the rest.”
Draco tried not to blush, and a few minutes later, a cup of tea appeared on the table. Thank fuck for small mercies.
“I’m going to suck you,” Draco murmured. “Until you’re hard as diamonds again. And then I’m going to ride your cock. I’ll do all the work. You just lie there and enjoy the view.”
“This is fucking gorgeous,” he said to Hermione, when he’d swallowed a mouthful of duck. Hermione didn’t answer; she and Blaise, on the other side of the room, were staring at each other in the way they did, communicating in a way that had to involve some far less invasive and more pleasant form of legilimency. “Will I be called up to speak soon?”
He turned to Hermione, who had tears in her eyes, and threw her arms around Harry’s shoulders, hugging him tightly.
“I suppose.” Hermione felt ill, suddenly. But Harry didn’t reply. His lack of experience in relationships wasn’t a sore spot.
After a long silence, Draco nodded, and climbed to his feet. “No need to get up, Minister,” he said. “I’m sure Auror Patil can show me to Harry’s office. I’ll talk to you later today.”
Molly kissed his cheek. “I’ll start asking around.” She pressed a small, brightly wrapped package into Harry’s hand. “Put it aside. In case he ever comes back.”
“Did you sleep well, Professor Potter?” Draco asked, reaching for some fruit toast and marmalade. Harry almost choked, which was gratifying.
“You’re much more than that,” Harry said, and there he was, ready to sacrifice his own little slice of misery to cheer Draco up, like some kind of a fucking Gryffindor. Good grief.
Sleep was elusive. The sheer power of the rain and sleet rendered silencing charms rather useless. But Harry found the tattoo on the rooftop calming, and his head was full of ideas, so he didn’t mind the sleeplessness. It was different from back when he was afraid to sleep because of the nightmares.
be long gone. And I’m not. So stop fretting like Madame Pomfrey.” He climbed to his feet, a little awkward but as graceful as he’d ever been, and ran his hand over the short, soft bristles on his scalp. “We might as well make ourselves useful.”
Ron,” Harry said, gently, topping off his glass. “It’s up to you whether you stay or not. But I can’t. I don’t want to. I did what I did because I had to, and it never occurred to me for a moment that I could ever be any good at anything else. I don’t want to ever have to Hex someone again…”
Hermione waited, and then poked him in the ribs with a very stern finger. “Go on. You’ve been in your head all night, Harry. And don’t try to tell me you didn’t love our gift. You do know how rare a foe-glass is, don’t you?”
Hermione’s face softened, and she shook her head. She turned to the pantry and started searching around, her ever-growing stomach getting in the way. She pulled out a bottle of Bailey’s. Muggle booze. Harry’s eyes opened wide, and Hermione brought the bottle down to the coffee table. She poured them each a glass, and then cast a charm over her own to remove the alcohol.
“We’d probably best get some sleep,” he said, sitting up abruptly. He dusted off his robes, and pointedly refused to look at the expression on Draco’s face.
Draco climbed to his feet and headed inside. He was grateful for a few moments to collect his thoughts, actually. He found another bottle of Pansy’s Firewhiskey and a couple of small crystal tumblers. He had saved very little from his family home, but these tumblers had come with him from Wiltshire to Nice, to Rome and then to Naples, and he loved them, quietly and fiercely. He brought them out to the warm porch and poured them each a drink.
“You are free to act against medical advice, of course, but I recommend you remain here in Naples where I can assist and observe your recovery. I will inform Minister Granger of this, as your medical proxy, of course.”
“I’ll take my leave. Enjoy the first day of classes, Potter. Neville,” he added, pulling his chair back.
. I guess that will do.” It wasn’t very thorough and Harry’s sleeve was soon sticky where his arm had been resting but he thought it was probably a reasonable go for the first time in several months.
“Either I am a stranger who will begin working to bring him out of this fantasy with hard work and logic, or I am a lover who can teach him he’s safe outside of it. I’m sure you’ll agree that the two approaches are necessarily
He was thinking about that now because he was thinking about Draco Malfoy, and how finding a calling could bring out the best in a person. He’d meant what he said. Draco had been far nicer than he ever wanted anyone to notice. He had been devoted to his friends. Predictably abrasive and tactile and sweet and funny right up until he’d been forced to take the Mark in the summer before Sixth Year, and shut everything else off, more or less. After that, of course, he’d been unable to think about anything much except how he was going to keep his parents alive.
“He won’t,” Harry said, and if it hurt a little to remind himself that he and Draco would probably never lay eyes on each other again, then that was alright.
“Oh,” Potter said, looking embarrassed, his shoulders closing in as if to make himself smaller. “No, it’s… forget I said that, I’m tired. It’s like you said. We’re not children anymore.”
“Yes, that’s what I said. Perfectly adequate.” He smiled, and cupped his face in her hands. “You don’t need to have been raised well. You don’t need to know about salad forks or how to dance. You don’t need to have this extraordinary magic rippling off you. You’re perfectly adequate.”
“He laughs it off,” she said, staring at Draco’s bookshelves. “I swear, I’ve tried. He’ll tell me he’s planning to spend the day resting, and then I’ll find out he’s spent the day visiting children at St. Mungo’s, or helping Ron in the shop. I ask him if he’s sleeping well and he puts this big, blinding, Harry Potter smile on his face and he tells me he is. He doesn’t complain. He never looks sad, or angry, or…”
Harry fussed in the shop, looking up every time he heard a single sound. People would be buying Christmas gifts here soon. His tiny kneazle-whisker wands for children too young for a proper wand yet but who would delight at the trails of sweet-smelling sparks the wands trailed in their wake. Wand stands for heirlooms, polishing cloths, the other small items Harry had begun to include in the shop to keep people coming in throughout the year.
Harry wanted to point out cruelly that the only three people from their year at Hogwarts at the funeral had been himself, and Ron, and Hermione. He swallowed the acidic words down.
Harry took a seat beside the bed and spent a few minutes just silently thanking Ollivander for finding him when he had. He hoped he had said often enough how grateful he was to the man for helping him to shape a life that was about creativity and magic, instead of violence and suspicion. He liked to think he had. He held that cool, papery hand and wondered how he was supposed to be feeling. Ollivander had been very clear that his life had been full, and that his only regret had been not finding an apprentice until so very late.
Harry tensed, but pretended he hadn’t, shifting instead. “Are you trying to reassure me, or something?”
Harry’s eyes closed. The sensation was far too much, after so long, and he truly couldn’t remember the last time he’d slept with someone he actually fancied. And when, he wondered, as he settled his hands on Draco’s hips, had that happened? At what point had he decided ‘
“I asked you a question,” Harry said, but he looked very surprised that Draco had elected to leave himself defenceless this way. His shoulders stiffened, but he lowered his wand.
“She’s excellent. She was living in Chile during the war and though she knew my name, I was never… I was never famous, to her. She knows what I did. She knows what I do. She’s just much more interested in talking about things that have upset or hurt me. Losing Sirius. Thinking about my parents and wondering what it would have been like if I’d grown up with them. She has some interesting ideas about Dumbledore.”
Ron snorted. “That’s too advanced for ickle firsties like us,” he said glumly. “Really, help defeat a Dark Lord and they don’t even cut you the smallest break. Harry’s not allowed anywhere but theory classes until he has a wand they’re all satisfied with.”
to do terrible things. And it was a long time ago. No one has forgotten. But most have forgiven. They’ve found a way to, because it helps them to feel better.” She shook her head sadly. “Harry — I feel like it’s been a hundred years since you’ve been really happy, and I don’t remember you doing anything for yourself since you gave up Quidditch. If you have a chance to be happy now, and you don’t take it — I’ll…”
He apparated to Grimmauld Place to change into more casual clothes, and more importantly, to pick up his experimental little wand. On Sunday, he had lovingly sanded and then oiled it carefully to bring out the shine, and he wanted to show Ollivander.
sentence, either. Harry chanced a look at Draco. He’d never been any good at concealing his emotions. Apparently that hadn’t changed. A tear rolled down his cheek, despite his attempt to keep his face neutral, and Harry looked away.
Draco snorted. “Not bad. A little more practice and you’ll be flinging barbs like it’s 1995.” He offered Potter what he hoped was a sincere smile, and with a moment’s hesitation Potter seemed to accept it.
“But I mean,” he said, “if he can turn the underside of this table into his bed in Gryffindor Tower, then the sky’s the limit, innit?” He shook his head. “Maybe Kreacher could help. Are you really getting Harry more elves?”
“I’m not building a tree house when they’re predicting we’ll have two feet of snow by the end of the week, Hermione. I love you and your healing spells but when my fingers freeze and fall off we both know you won’t be able to stick them on again.”
“What else did you have in mind? I’m not sure what else I’m good at — I know I don’t want to play professional Quidditch. Molly thinks I should teach, but to be honest, I think after NEWTs I will need to give Hogwarts a wide berth until… well, for a good long time.”
It didn’t take the band very long to get set up again, after what must have been a sound check earlier. Harry cast a mild, wandless Muffliato just so his eardrums wouldn’t pop, and sipped his chocolate stout.
“Go and see Madame Pomfrey,” Malfoy said. “Go on. I shall pass a note on to Professor Saltzman to say you’ll be late.”
“Well, we threw them,” Ron said, with his mouth full of mashed potatoes. “And you usually arrived late and covered in something frightening.”
It had been a long time since Harry had been romantically entangled with anyone but his own hand, and after days of what he now recognised as sexual frustration he knew it wasn’t going to take long. And couldn’t bring himself to care, either, knowing they had all evening and all night and ideally the rest of their lives to do this. Draco’s eyes rolled back in his head and he wrapped his arm tight around Harry’s neck, muttering, gasping, begging into his ear before his body locked up tight and he came hard into the narrow space between their bodies, digging his nails into Harry’s shoulder until Harry was quite sure he’d broken the skin. The expression on his face drove Harry over the edge as well, and he let out a very undignified grunt.
“I don’t like to think about things like this,” Harry said. “I don’t know why you’d force me to. Did I do something wrong?”
Mostly, he wanted to marry him. He wanted Harry sodding Potter, Gryffindor git and all-around speccy wanker, the Boy Who Lived, the Chosen One, with his reckless power and his terrible childhood under the stairs to be his partner and his husband. To share their rooms in the Castle. To go to sleep with him and wake up with him and press behind him when Harry made tea. To bend Harry over his own desk and fuck him ruthlessly until Harry was sobbing and babbling; to hook his legs over Harry’s shoulders on their wedding night.
“Of a sort. I understand what he’s done, now, at least, although I don’t believe he did it on purpose. But I’ll get to that. We’ve touched on this before, but I’m asking you directly, now. Do you think Harry is gay?”
This was only the third time that Draco would experience the first night of school as a teacher, and he spent a few extra moments in his rooms adjusting his tie and smoothing down his hair. It was beginning to curl at the ends as he grew older and he let it grow longer. There was a part of him that thought his father would hate that and tell him to straighten it, but Draco didn’t mind it, in the end. Perhaps because it made it easier to look at himself in the mirror and see something other than the man he’d almost become.
Draco huffed, and shifted, reaching for the book and passing it to Harry. “I have a five year old patient who won’t speak,” he said, by explanation.
Someone needed to do something. Say something. Break this unbelievably tight silence. And of course, it was Hermione.
“Just Harry, please,” Harry replied, blithely. He stepped inside and looked around, but if he was wondering if anything had changed, it had not; the door to his hospital room was long gone, though, the private ward now only accessible from the main part of the hospital once more.
“Thank you, Draco,” he said instead, and Draco felt something deep inside him quiver with need at the sound of his voice. “Send an elf if you are still sore in the morning.”
“No,” Blaise said. He stood and removed his Unspeakable robes, shrunk them down and balled them in his hand. “No, I’m not sure I’ve ever seen you so well balanced. It’s marvellous, really. I’m impressed.”
wanted to kiss. He felt like a fraud, in his fancy clothes. He wondered if he should remind Draco that he’d slept in a cupboard under the stairs for ten years and didn’t know which forks to use. That sometimes he wanted to vanish all of his nice furniture because he loved it so much and didn’t think he should really be allowed to touch it.
“If you want me to last longer than ten seconds when you start fucking me, it might be a good idea to take the edge off, yes.”
And then Duelling Club, after a Monday that seemed to go on forever. At least as entertaining as the one the week before, particularly when Harry (perhaps deliberately) flubbed his Shield Charm and Draco hit him with a dancing jinx and a laughing jinx in quick succession. He wasn’t even embarrassed when he hit the ground, still shaking, and sat up to tell them all he was giving Slytherin House ten points because Professor Malfoy had beaten him fair and square.
He would wake up sobbing, sometimes alone, sometimes with someone doing their best to comfort him, and he wondered if this was what life was going to be like for the rest of his days; just a series of horrors, nightmare after nightmare until he couldn’t take it any more. And then Ron, though he didn’t scream in the night — he started climbing out of bed and wandering out of the house, finding himself lost and wandless when he woke up at last. Harry and Arthur spent a weekend putting up charms all over the doors and windows that were supposed to sound an alarm if Ron tried to leave.
“I am simply quivering with anticipation,” Draco said, leaning against the door jamb as Potter slipped his robes over his ridiculous Muggle nonsense.
“I hope I’ll see you soon,” she said, rather officiously, when she’d let go of Draco. He didn’t reply, but he looked, Harry thought, a little fond when he nodded noncommittally.
It happened, sometimes. He loved the dungeons, loved sitting by his window and looking out into the green hues of the lake, the fish and tiny sea monsters that made it their home; he loved how safe and enclosed it all felt. But from time to time he felt suddenly oppressed by all of that, and he needed, on those days, to fly.
“She’s a little girl,” Draco said, reaching for a sandwich. “She doesn’t have confidence in herself and she was startled. Children should be able to make mistakes without the world ending, Salazar’s sake,” he muttered, before cramming a sandwich into his mouth. “I almost burned down Malfoy Manor as a child, when I found an old wand and tried
When it was over — and that was quite quickly, the whole painful thing over in a handful of moments, with no one to speak for Mrs Malfoy — Harry and the others stood a short distance from the grave, waiting. Harry was hoping that at some point he would realise the exact thing that he needed to do here and suddenly summon the fortitude to do it. He had one eye on Malfoy and one on Teddy, whose hair had turned green suddenly as he turned a leaf over in his chubby little hand.
“Mate,” Ron said. “Me and George are making you an alarm clock for your birthday. The loudest one you ever heard of.” Mocking. But so relieved to see Harry that he was shaking a little, even as they held each other. At least until the girls started screaming ‘Uncle Harry’ and, still a bit too weak to lift them both the way they were used to Harry crouched on the ground for a very squirmy hug.
“I want you to wake up, but I won’t blame you if you decide not to, Harry,” he murmured, as the sun began to peek over the horizon, pinking up the window.
“And you, as well, Mr Weasley,” Malfoy went on. He met Ron’s eyes for a moment. Only a moment. “I’m sorry I called your family — what I called them. I’m sorry about everything. I hope you can believe me, though I am not asking for forgiveness.”
Oh. Oh! Harry wordlessly conjured some lube into Draco’s hand and Draco lifted his own arse into the air, steadying himself with one hand and working his fingers inside himself until he was so turned on his mouth was getting sloppy, his rhythm entirely gone.
Draco didn’t need to hear any more. He stepped through the wall again. Harry had carefully arranged himself so he was lying down without putting too much pressure on his shoulder. Light seeped through the slats and patterned his face.
Hermione felt… almost as if everything inside her had crumpled, suddenly and finally. As if she might never find a way to stand straight again. Something she hadn’t thought about in so many years. Something that made Harry… human, perhaps. A terrible mistake, a moment of horror.
“You’re allowed to want things for yourself, you know. You don’t have to stare at grey walls, and stone floors. You have money, I know you do. You’re allowed to be happy and comfortable. Life isn’t only about working, Potter, it’s about living, too. And I’m not sure you quite know how.”
to embrace him when he arrived at the gates of Hogwarts. She didn’t look as if she had aged a day since last he had seen her, and it made Harry wonder again just how old she was. Still walking tall and proud.
Draco tried to scream because there was no one to beg for help, and because he was utterly trapped. Until —
. I saw it every time. So I hid it, instead. It was all I could really do. It’s all I’ve ever really been able to. Hide who I am.”
Draco gazed at the window. Outside, the sky was so clear that a thousand stars shone. All those constellations, all those grand old Black names.
“Oh, shut up,” she said, reaching for the Floo powder with a smile on her face. Real and warm, if not as wide as his own. “Let’s just get this over with.”
He stayed by Harry’s side until the sounds of life in the house disappeared. The boy was coaxed to bed, despite wanting to watch the television for ‘five more minutes’, over and over again. The man had to be drinking. His voice got more slurred as the evening went on and the woman eventually coaxed him up the stairs as well.
“Happy Christmas, Draco,” he replied, stepping forward to shake the offered hand. “Are you enjoying your break so far?”
Students would be sleeping in. Breakfast was a lazier affair on Saturdays, served until the late morning, and he had no pressing need to do anything else. So he took his broom down from the hooks over his desk, dressed warmly, and set out into the castle. He saw no one but an old grey cat chasing a mouse in the direction of the Hufflepuff dormitories.
A moment later, two elves appeared behind him. One wore a smart blue dress, and the other, a grimy old pillowcase. Harry smiled at them both, still confused, but deeply grateful. He
Harry siphoned the potion into several bottles that Draco had lying about, and without need of his wand labeled them all. The raw power in the air made Draco shiver, with fear, with want, with… bollocks to all of this.
“It’s amazing,” she said. “Knowing she’s in there. She has brown skin, like me, a little lighter. And red hair, but it’s darker than the Weasleys’. She likes music. And I love her, and I’d lay my life down for her, and I think every mother says that, but I know I can and will if I have to because I have stepped in front of hexes and curses and even
“When the war was over, and the trials were over, he left England. I didn’t know where. I wanted to know. I made some discreet enquiries. But I was in Auror training and I didn’t have a lot of time. Still, eventually, carefully, I found him. Studying in Nice, at first, where he finished his NEWTs.”
Harry turned back to Professor McGonagall. “I’ll need to destroy both the bottle and the crystal ball. Not tonight; I’ll need time to prepare. Why isn’t his mail checked? Mine is.”
So he did, and they talked, and Harry almost leapt from the bed when Draco summoned Rubino to bring them a small antipasto platter. “I wasn’t serious about snacks!” he cried.
Harry Potter wouldn’t invent a whole character in his head to satisfy some ridiculous schoolboy crush.
Hermione had been pretending not to notice the two elves who had been creeping closer, listening to her every word. They came closer still, now; one wore a dirty dishtowel and the other, a hat and socks. Young, determined.
“Feels true. Things happened. I’m done with things happening, I think. I sacrificed myself. They shouldn’t have made me take that back.”
“Because most restaurants frown upon people eating naked, and as soon as you talk me out of my clothes I’m going nude for the rest of the day. You can start any time, you know. I’m in the mood. Want me to beg? You know how pretty I can beg. Draco, what’s the matter? You look…”
Blaise Zabini didn’t know Harry Potter very well at all. He genuinely wasn’t sure that anyone really did. But he was certain of one thing:
When Hermione and Blaise stepped out of the fireplace and into Draco’s little house things were definitely amiss. Blaise stepped in front of her almost instantly, wand raised and ready; the glass shook in the window frames, the pictures shook on the walls (upsetting some of the residents briefly) and the light wavered dramatically as the flames were tossed from side to side. And then it stopped.
Julian Flint shook his head. He was about as pleasant as his older brother was, if significantly more intelligent.
She sat beside him, and knowing how much easier Harry found it to give comfort than to take it, she took one of his hands in both of hers and leaned heavily into his side, head on his shoulder.
He pulled an old, broken teacup from his pocket. A Portkey, apparently. A whirl of light and shadow, and he was gone.
She saw the problem at once, and laid a hand on Harry’s shoulder, mimicking his wandwork with the other hand an joining in chanting the counter-curse. Madame Pomfrey placed a cooling compress on Malfoy’s forehead, fretting loudly, though Harry found himself able to ignore her in favour of concentrating on his task.
(Maybe even then, Harry knew. But he wouldn’t believe, or let himself believe, until Ollivander said it. He heard Professor McGonagall whispering in the back of his mind that there were hundreds of things that he hadn’t yet tried, and how he’d been so sure he didn’t need to.)
She didn’t. It was a terrible week. Too much work to do, too many meetings, too much interdepartmental whining. Blaise was away doing something he couldn’t talk about, and she missed him terribly, and the only person she wanted to talk to about it was Harry.
He sat by Harry’s bedside for at least three or four hours after he arrived back in Naples, thinking. And then, following no other protocol but instinct, Draco crept up onto the bed. He stretched out, his head on Harry’s shoulder and his arm draped happily over his stomach.
“Didn’t need saving,” Julian said. “Are we done? I have more important things to do. Anyway, when’s he getting back from Budapest, or wherever?”
Draco settled on his chair, expression neutral, every bit the professional, while his heart raced and his entire body felt overheated.
“Listen, before I forget. Part of my process is a little mind-reading. No, not… well, it’s like that, but really, I take a dip into someone’s dream. And last week a strange thing happened with Auror… with
The bell over the door rang, and Harry looked up. A handful of the other teachers had stepped inside. Professor Saltzman, who had taken over History of Magic when Binns had discovered quite abruptly that he was, indeed, dead. Professor Bennett, who had taken over Transfiguration when McGonagall had taken on the role of Headmaster. She was very clever. She reminded Harry of Hermione. And Draco. Of
Luc’s eyes flashed. He did understand. He’d always known their deal. No strings, no sleepovers and no attachments. Partly because Luc worked elsewhere in the hospital but mostly because Draco had never had much interest in strings, sleepovers or attachments. And when they did go out, he preferred not to plan who to go home with until the absolute last minute.
“I can almost hear the cogs in your mind moving,” Hermione said, leaning forward, elbows on her knees. “Please, talk to me, Harry. You have plans.”
“No war,” Draco repeated, quietly. “I might have missed a few things, but this is most of it. The big things. Right back to here.” He pointed to the day that Harry’s parents died. “The day he killed Voldemort forever. And was sent to live with Sirius and Remus, who doted on him for the rest of his life and dote on him still.”
And then Harry realised, abruptly, that he’d never learned himself. So he waited, and he asked for a lesson, paid the man some Muggle money (he’d always been proficient across the different systems, despite the ridiculous arithmetic) and gave it a shot.
In retrospect, she realised he had probably spent most of his life trying to prove he wasn’t the person he had been in that moment.
Harry squawked, and so did Molly, and Ginny smiled unrepentantly. Ron’s face drained of all colour, and Hermione jabbed him in the ribs.
“I gave that up, remember,” Harry said, and he let Draco sit up again. Wanted to see those beautiful eyes, that patrician nose. Those lips, so soft, that fit so beautifully with Harry’s. Draco turned his head.
“Look, it says here he freed all the elves, and wants Hogwarts to consider taking them on as employees.” Ron was shaking his head. “He’s
“No,” he said, surprised by his honesty and deflating a little. “I’m not. And I’m not disappointed that I’ve not been allowed into practical classes yet because — I feel as if I’ve fought enough for my entire life. I don’t
you’d be a brat in bed,” Harry said, laughing. And then he started to move. His hips snapped hard, making Draco grunt in a way that purebloods probably weren’t really supposed to, begging and snarling and coaxing Harry to go faster, harder, just more. More of this, of everything.
His bones, incidentally, were as bored as they were warm. He thought over Draco’s instructions to Healer Thistlewish, and decided to follow at least one of his suggested therapeutic activities; a walk. It sounded simple enough. The strange guilt that he felt about being back in the world and not actually doing any work niggled at the back of his mind, but he did his best to ignore it. It seemed like a good day to see something he’d never seen before. The Botanical Gardens at Kew, perhaps. Or an art gallery. He knew that there were apparition points. He could take in some history, and culture.
Draco rolled his eyes. Narcissa didn’t see, so as soon as she looked at him, he did it again. The second one was so dramatic it actually ached for a moment.
Harry felt his lips curl into an incredulous smile. Whatever McGonagall was getting at, Harry had no clue. Harry would be an Auror. He didn’t think he could even live with himself if he knew that there were people putting himself in harm’s way if he wasn’t doing the same himself.
It wouldn’t have been accurate to say that Harry had hoped he wouldn’t wake up. But that didn’t change the fact that now he was awake he had no idea what to do with himself. He had sat in the armchair in the bedroom for at least an hour when he woke again, wondering what he should do; every time he heard Draco move around in the rooms beyond his own he felt a rush of anxiety. Back in the world, but not ready to be back in the world. He was in limbo. Staring out of the window at the spring afternoon and wondering if he could actually put himself back into that safe, comfortable place in his mind, all alone with his thoughts.
“Oh, now I know you’re pissed off with me. You only call me Potter when you’re pissed off with me. Time will fly, Draco. It’ll be Christmas before you know it.” The three of them stood on the platform, watching the train disappear, surrounded by parents who look sad and relieved and worried all at once. The Leaky Cauldron would be full to bursting tonight. “And I’m sure that on average Hufflepuff is a much safer house than either Gryffindor or Slytherin.”
A sheet of parchment slipped elegantly under the door to Harry’s room and neatly into Draco’s grasp.
The first hour was difficult and awkward but Draco still seemed determined, chopping vegetables by hand even when Molly said she was happy to set the knives to do it themselves. She saw quickly that he was determined to do something, and left him alone for a while, until Arthur came to talk to him.
Potter had turned, then, and they’d held each other’s gazes for what seemed like an eternity. Potter had looked sick. Gaunt. Not only sleeping too little but not eating properly, either, and Draco wondered if anyone was taking proper care of the git.
Draco helped her to the Floo, kissed her cheek goodbye, and walked back to the school with a head full of nonsense.
“They’re yours,” Harry said, closing his hand around their cocks, fucking them both into his hand. “Everything I have. Yours.”
“I didn’t ask what she needed, or what she wanted,” Harry argued. He rubbed his eyes. “I asked what you thought she would
“You poor dear,” Draco replied, rolling his eyes hard enough so that the seventh year Slytherins could hear it at the very back of the room. “Perhaps you’d like to see the headline from my first day. It might cheer you up.
Of course, the first thing that struck him was the fact that the place was clean, and smelled like… like… Harry closed his eyes an inhaled deeply. Like orange rinds. Clean, and fresh, and almost sharp. He hadn’t yet closed the door when he began to stare. The hallway was painted a soft blue-grey colour; the exact colour, he thought, of Draco Malfoy’s eyes.
Harry had spent so many weeks, now, worrying about what would happen when he was actually in front of a classroom of students that when he was suddenly there, he thought very briefly about running away. All the work he’d done on preparing lessons — he didn’t have much to go on, since only Lupin had ever been any good as a teacher — it all seemed to go out of the window. On a broom. Like Harry wanted to.
“But you are, you idiot. You are the most Gryffindor person to ever walk this earth, Harry Potter, and I need you to summon up the last of your courage and wake up. Just a little bit more, Harry. And then I’ll lock the doors. I’ll tell Hermione you need a
“Not like that,” he said, and in one smooth move (smooth, but deliberately flashy, all elegant muscle and dominance) he was sitting up on his feet, Draco straddling his hips, both of them insensible as Draco slid down over his cock. And they stopped. For a long moment, they just stopped, getting used to the feeling, Draco’s forehead resting against Harry’s. Breathing each other’s breath.
Jake Combefort, unquestionably one of the brightest students in Harry’s fifth-year class, with his shiny black skin and his red-headed mortal enemy in Slytherin, looked over his shoulder. There were a number of students standing behind him, including the aforementioned nemesis, and another dozen or so a little closer to the door, wary. They were from all four houses, which made Harry feel both unreasonably pleased, and slightly concerned.
“I’ll take my leave,” she said. “No more mixed messages, Mr Black. If you love my son, then try, and let him help you try.” She dropped her arms and her face shuttered, and she was at once the prim aristocrat he’d first seen so many years ago on platform nine and three quarters.
But Harry didn’t answer; he was on his feet, hands cupping Draco’s face, kissing him so deeply and thoroughly that Draco couldn’t avoid a little mewl of desire. His entire body responded, and despite the difference in their heights, he actually felt small, pressed against Harry. Small and sort of…
“Draco. Thank you,” she said. She crossed to where he was standing. Awkward. What on earth was one supposed to do with ones arms in these situations? Oh, fuck it; Draco had saved Harry’s life, and they weren’t children any more. Draco was a Healer and a good man and if Blaise was right, he loved Harry. After another moment’s hesitation, she wrapped her arms around his neck and shoulders. Tight, and hard, unwilling to let go until he had some idea of what it meant to her.
In the last week of January, Harry helped Ron and Hermione move into their new house. In the first week of February, Ron and Hermione helped Harry move into the rooms above the shop, which was… a much better size for one person to live in, but which still had a couple of spare rooms for visitors, and a large attic where he could keep all of Sirius’s things.
“Supervise?” Draco raised an eyebrow. “No need. Unless you’d be more comfortable watching to make sure I don’t switch something out for Belladonna, I can manage myself. I’ll have one of the elves bring it to you.”
Draco chuckled amiably. “What a sight that must have been. You know, I’ve heard things about being an Auror. Close quarters, high stress… romance blooms… or not romance, as the case may be…”
The next day found them at Number Twelve, with an assortment of house-repair spell books, a collection of tools from both worlds, and eyes sparkling with excitement.
“That’s why you’ll be a superb Auror, while I would probably have ended up in St Mungo’s once a week and ended up dying under
“We haven’t discussed courting in a long time, Draco,” she said, when the dinner plates had been cleared, and they were waiting for their dessert.
Harry was barely even conscious of the wandless, non-verbal spell he cast to bring the music out onto the balcony. He instantly regretted it, when he saw that Malfoy was impressed. Oh, he would make some girl a wonderful husband, for three minutes before he rode his broom directly into a volcano.
“Oh,” Hermione said with a sigh. “I’ll never forget that. The feeling when my wand came alive in my hand.”
“I have over a week to practice being that version of myself,” Harry said. “I’ll be fine, and you don’t get to ask me again.”
They all sat down to eat a little while later and Draco’s spine was straight, for all he was subdued and anxious-looking. Harry bumped their knees together under the table, which seemed to help. Molly was struggling, Arthur was focused on her, Ginny had absolutely no filter, Hermione was carrying the conversation and Harry was wondering if he’d made a terrible, terrible mistake.
What else. Trying to find the odd moment to act their ages, that had been a challenge. Riding brooms felt like a waste of time. They weren’t studying, so complaining about homework wasn’t on the cards. Trapped between a childhood that had been one of the many casualties of war and an adulthood they weren’t yet ready for.
He knocked gently on Draco’s door, and waited a moment before he opened it. All he could see was the lump under the quilts where Draco had buried himself.
Harry didn’t argue. He headed back to the sitting room where the youngest children were casting ‘spells’ at Teddy to ‘make’ his hair change colour. Such a good sport. Such a good child. Harry took a mug of butterbeer from Ron and sat on the couch, pulling his feet up underneath him.
“And dying in the Forbidden Forest doesn’t cut it?” Ginny snorted. “No, wait, it’s Harry. Dying for all mankind was probably the best day of his life.”
The receiving line was awful. Draco shook his hand as coldly and formally as he would have shaken McGonagall’s hand, and Harry wanted to disapparate on the spot. But he found his place, sitting opposite Draco for dinner, and did his best to contribute something to the conversation.
A Healer and a nurse spent time seeing to his physical needs, and making sure he wasn’t developing pressure sores, while Draco sat in his office, meditating. He was still struggling with some anger, and it was making it very difficult to keep his mind clear. But eventually, he found his way to that tranquility he needed.
Somewhere along the line his feelings had shifted, blast them. And he’d found himself remembering how his parents managed his own small catastrophes. How carefully his mother had made sure he knew he wasn’t in trouble, the way she’d talked him through the mistakes he might have made. And now Amelia felt like —
“Does anyone have a snack an owl might like?” Draco called. All over the day room, patients stood, approaching the owl that was gripping tightly to Draco’s wrist. He was busily untying the message with his free hand, and the owl, in the meantime, was enjoying a great deal of attention, several pieces of fruit and lots of gentle neck scratching.
When everyone had eaten their fill, and laughed their fill, and — in all honesty — drunk their fill, they went home, the green flames dancing in the fireplace as people called their goodbyes.
He’d been so many things, in his life. A nuisance. The terrible nephew who attended St Brutus’s School for Incurably Criminal Boys. The Boy Who Lived, the Chosen One, a liar, an attention-seeker, the Saviour of the Wizarding World. Something wonderful or something terrible and never anything in between.
It was so painfully self-indulgent, sharing that. But Draco couldn’t find it in him to regret it. He had been pulled back into the world of Harry sodding Potter and he didn’t intend to leave unless he was asked to.
He received a highly agitated return Owl from Hermione insisting that he let her come right away or she would break something else that no Minister for Magic should ever have threatened.
“I’ve been thinking about the nature of longing,” Blaise said. “You know, I’m not supposed to talk about my work at all.” He didn’t bother to say that he trusted Harry not to share this. “It’s interesting — longing involves love and time, and that is an unusually complicated relationship. I shan’t bore you.”
When he went to Diagon Alley in the morning, Ollivander’s was closed. He asked at Flourish and Blott’s and the proprietor there said that Ollivander’s health had been failing, and he preferred to take appointments, these days. Harry groaned. He felt badly for Ollivander, he did; he was a kind man, and he had helped in the war when he was needed. But Harry needed a wand. He paused too long in Diagon Alley, and was spotted.
“Merlin,” Harry said, and though the happy smile had dropped from his face, his wonder was equally satisfying. Draco perched on the arm of a chair with a smug expression and his arms crossed over his chest.
“I know,” Harry said, and now his ears had joined the party, burning hot and throbbing against his head. “I hope I didn’t do them any damage. It wasn’t my intention. She is a lovely manor.”
Harry looked to have been hypnotised by the flames again, but Hermione knew what it meant when those tiny lines bracketed the corners of his mouth. He was sad, and not just sad; he was, once again, accepting the loss of something he’d never been sure he could really keep anyway. Like when he’d lost Sirius, and then Remus. Even Hedwig. Whenever someone shoved a photograph of his parents under his knows. Like when things hadn’t worked out with Ginny.
“Did you get into a fist fight, Harry? Fantastic! Oh, no, you weren’t trying to flirt with straight guys, were you? Did you get a good one or two in yourself?”
“Blaise likes anyone who can hold their own in a battle of wits and fill out a pair of jeans. Really, Hermione — stop this. It’s all fine. I have no interest in dating Blaise Zabini, quarter-Veela, or anyone else, for that matter.”
Harry looked up into the bright and now startled eyes of Pansy Parkinson. For a moment, they stared at each other and didn’t say a word.
“Dreamless sleep?” he asked, as if the list could be for anything else. Of course it was for dreamless sleep; Potter was looking as enchanting as ever, with his eyes that ridiculous emerald green, and his hair sticking up in the back, and a jawline that could only be described as patrician. But the shadows under his eyes were very telling. “I usually have some on hand, but after last week’s accident with the boggart in Ravenclaw Tower, a number of first and second year students had rather urgent need for it. I should have prepared some more.”
He recognised Hermione’s owl, Spot (stupid Muggle joke, but Hermione loved her) and caught a letter in mid-air. A second owl, equally recognisable as Narcissa Malfoy’s magnificent old barn owl dropped a second letter, and Harry passed it to Draco without a thought. He opened Hermione’s letter. Full of the usual; with a photograph of Hugo, pregnancy details Harry could have done without, and an invitation to dinner in two weeks.
“Tell me you took down all those heads. Creepy as fuck, they were. Terrified me as a child. And old Walburga —”
That it had become impossible, by the time he was seventeen, to ever be anything but the Boy Who Lived. His destiny seemed to be set in stone, and he lacked any kind of adult who he may have been able to talk about it with in depth. He had been fighting since before he’d had hair under his arms and it seemed inevitable that he would fight for his entire life. Never mind that it still seemed to be leeching life from him every day, and had done for years.
The first best thing was taking Rose into his arms. She was much smaller than Hugo had been, but no less interested in the world. Hermione had been right (really, when wasn’t she?) and Rose’s skin was as dark as Hermione’s, and her hair was red, though not a Weasley red — it was rich and dark and stuck out in all angles, curling this way and that. She was also significantly sleepier than Hugo had been at her age, content to nap on anyone as long as she wasn’t poked too much.
“Marry me,” Blaise said. He had a box in his hand, Hermione saw, as she turned around. The ring inside resembled a tight coil of ivy with wide, healthy leaves, the dewdrops thereupon tiny pearls of light. “I know there’s a part of you that wants to tell me to wait, and ask again when Harry is alright. And that’s why I’m asking
Harry’s smile was small, but sure, and dazzling. “I’m well, thank you. I resigned from my job, you see. Several weeks ago.” His expression carried a mild apology but Draco wasn’t especially interested in an explanation for the long break. He knew Harry needed to be ready. And he knew, from the way he held Draco’s eyes unflinchingly that he was, indeed, ready.
off. Or a decade. Or that I don’t want you ever working again, and you can mooch around in your pyjamas all day and… I don’t know. Paint. Design brooms. Read your way through the Western canon, if you like, though I’ve never taken you for much of a reader. You can wrap your ridiculous octopus arms around me and refuse to let me get out of bed in the mornings, and I’ll let you. I’ll grumble about it, though. You’ll know… you’ll know I don’t mean it.”
Auror Lisbon leaned closer. “So, the week before he left, we were on a stakeout. For days, mind you; we were supposed to be swapping out, but they put up new wards, no one could get in. And me, I couldn’t stay awake. But Potter — I suppose it’s the practice, isn’t it? Still as could be and still awake. Told me he knew a spell. When you’re about to fall asleep, it zaps you awake. Sounds fucking horrible, but he said it helped. Said he’d teach it to me sometime.”
Gabrielle was as gracious as ever, and took Harry’s hands in her own. “You have to stay for dinner,” she said, because Ron couldn’t.
“Oh, stop it.” Draco stabbed viciously at his risotto, though it was very nice and hadn’t done him any harm. “This isn’t my home, Potter, for fuck’s sake, it’s my office. I don’t know what you’re doing, but stop it.”
He was sixteen years old. He was terrified; for himself, for his friends, and for his family. His mother. He was supposed to kill Dumbledore, who had only ever been kind and patient with him, however complicated his more adult feelings were about the man, and he was going to fail.
“I started dropping in to see him from time to time. I always kept my distance. And wore a Glamour, just as he did, but there was no mistaking the way he walked and talked. And I got pretty good at seeing past Glamours anyway, when I needed to, as my training progressed. So it was easy to find him, when I wanted to know what was going on.”
“Harry,” Draco murmured. He had to get up. He had to run diagnostic spells, and make sure that this was true sleep and that Harry was ready to come home. If he decided to wait, selfishly, to enjoy the puff of breath against his jaw and watch the jump of the pulse in Harry’s neck… well, this had been exhausting for Draco, too.
Draco sat beside him. Not too close, not close enough to touch, perhaps make Harry run away, but he sat close.
“Oh, I mean it with the greatest affection. He did save my life repeatedly, Hermione, despite what an utter shit I was to him. If he wasn’t so painfully selfless I wouldn’t be here to bitch about it, but the point remains. He was treated like a tool, and he’s still acting like one.” He glanced sideways. “I could have phrased that differently.”
Draco tensed briefly, and Harry remembered the mirrors. He looked up, flushed with apology, but Draco seemed to want to speak no further of it. He tugged at Harry’s arm until they were pressed close on the bed, legs slotted together, Harry riding Draco’s thigh and Draco arching his back to do the same.
“I worked at St. Mungo’s, actually. I still consult for them, from time to time, when they have a potions-related catastrophe of some sort or need help developing something new. I was always rather good at this, I think you’ll remember. The secret is: follow the directions, stop aggravating Snape, and stop staring daggers at the back of the Slytherins’ heads, and you might learn a thing or two.”
“Oh, Harry,” Hermione said, rushing across the room to wrap her arms around him. He felt smaller, having lost a little weight and perhaps some muscle tone, but he held her tight.
Draco held his eyes, challenging. And Harry realised it truly wasn’t any of his business. He was unaccountably glad that Draco was there, in his house, even if he was being especially obtuse. But what Draco chose to share with him, or not, was up to him.
“Yes,” Malfoy answered, as if he couldn’t think about it for another second. “Well. Yes.” He turned to Hermione. “Ms Granger, I apologise deeply for everything that happened to you in my family home,” he said, and gave an awkward little bow. “For not doing more to try to protect you there. And for everything I said and did to you at school.”
Still it made his blood boil. He clenched his jaw, but smiled beneficently when the woman turned back for one last scowl.
Draco fought the urge to roll his eyes — after the honesty they’d survived the night before he might have imagined that Hermione could find her way to trusting him, but apparently his optimism was unfounded.
“I think you are all very aware that my life has been complicated,” he said. He couldn’t force himself to meet anyone’s eyes but he let his glance move over the room so they would have the impression he was doing so anyway. “It really has been. My childhood — you all know very well that I lost my parents. And you know how. I was raised by Muggle relatives for several years and they weren’t… kind,” he said.
He closed the door behind him and called out for Scamp, tying his order to her foot and offering her a scrap of dried meat as compensation.
devoid of fingers,” he sighed. “You know I was a Death Eater, Harry. I do like a finger or two. Cured in salt and smoked with rosemary —”
“I really was hoping it would be a Howler this time,” Draco said coolly, and snatched it from Harry — because despite his insistence that he was not in the habit of reading other people’s mail, he really had no such qualms.
“Is it still tradition once the family name has been sullied beyond all repair?” He hated the way his mother smarted at the words. “Alright. I apologise. Who did you have in mind? And please don’t forget that by tradition I can veto anyone you might suggest.”
And so, they did. Finn had made cocktails, with no recipe but a lot of decoration, and Harry wondered how precisely people who were supposed to fall into place did so; these three, and Hermione and Blaise, and Pansy and Greg and their whiskey. But he didn’t wonder for long. When they were all a little drunker than was appropriate for a weeknight, Harry made his goodbyes, and reached for the Floo powder.
He found himself by the duck pond, and made his way to the little stand where the old Muggle man sold food that was good for ducks.
In the meantime, Harry began a chant, under his breath. The curse was unwilling to cooperate, digging in harder, but little by little he began to pull something that looked like a plant — some kind of kelp — out of Malfoy’s arm.
A careful spell rolled Harry onto his side, and he rubbed the potion into his back. Every one of Harry’s ribs was prominent. There had been no change to the nutrition he was being provided, but with his magic waning, he wasn’t taking as much in.
“You don’t need to,” Harry said, his teeth beginning to buzz. “Please, Draco. It’s my day off. I don’t want to argue about sausages when we’ve enough bacon to sink a small battleship.”
Harry carefully folded a polishing cloth into the white box and settled the wand inside. “You’ll need to keep it tucked away until school starts, I’m afraid,” he said, as he passed it to Daisy. “Enjoy school, Miss Parkinson.”
Around three in the morning, when most people had gone home (by apparition or by floo, for the most part), and those who were staying were tucked up fast asleep, Harry climbed through the window in the attic and sat on the roof.
Harry stared at it for a long time, and finally turned it over. Apparently, Mrs Malfoy had used the Black family seal. That seemed significant. “I don’t suppose your mother knows how to conceal a howler,” he said, uneasily. Draco only sniffed, and Harry opened the letter.
“Something I learned, in the years I was struggling to find my own way again,” he said, passing her the glass, “is that you can’t do any better than you’ve learned to do. And you can’t work on information you don’t have. All that matters is that when you have a chance to do better, you do it. I think about that every day. A Muggleborn Witch or Wizard comes to me in need of help and there is a part of me that knows that if they knew who I was, they’d be afraid that I would hurt them. I tried to be exactly like my father for so long that I never once questioned whether he was right about — anything, really. I was the dutiful little Death Eater as soon as I knew what the words meant, and then by the time I realised it was a load of bollocks and I needed to find a way to escape, or die trying, he was back. Tom Riddle. Offering me the Dark Mark and making it clear that I would accept, and do what he told me to do, or my parents would be eaten alive by his charming pet snake.”
Molly’s eyebrows knit in the middle. “Harry, dear… I’m not sure Draco was ever a scorpion, though. He may have been raised by one. You know, that day over here he spoke to Arthur and Arthur thought that, well, that Draco was very fond of you.” She held his gaze. “
Draco scrubbed his hand through his hair. “Whatever… whatever happened in his head — Harry tossing Potter hasn’t laid eyes on me since we were seventeen years old, and whatever bizarre fantasy world he cooked up in his head… it’s not about me. Fuck, maybe he had some kind of boyhood crush, I don’t know — I was, of course, very very attractive and important.”
Draco reached for his wand and wordlessly nudged the curtains the rest of the way open. “It’s beautiful all summer, if you don’t mind the heat. Beautiful all year around, really, but the beaches, and…”
“I was talking about pureblood nonsense,” Andromeda replied. “And I never taught him to extrapolate.”
“I was so sorry about your mother, dear,” Molly said. Harry wanted to turn time back a few moments and distract her, but Draco forced a very polished expression onto his face, even if his eyes looked desperately sad.
bloke, but you’re not up for doing that. Not these days. But nice try, good threat,” he added, with much too much enthusiasm, like he was trying to encourage a first year student who had just had a face full of Bulbadox juice. Draco let his forehead slam on the table in front of him.
“I shouldn’t have been sarcastic,” he said, quietly. “There’s something about being back here that brings out the nasty little shithead I was back in school. I’m actually rather nice, these days, not that I’d expect anyone to believe me.”
“I don’t know,” Hermione said. “Shh, it’s starting.” Harry had attended many funerals in the previous months, even years, but never a pureblood one like this. There was only silence, when Malfoy shook his head and declined to speak, and after a few moments of awkward waiting, Narcissa’s coffin was entombed in a marble case, which was swallowed up by the earth.
Draco set the tea back on the tray. “I’m tired,” he said, and buried himself under the quilts again.
He sat heavily on the chair behind his desk. Molly had sent a tin of biscuits; she always did, shortbread biscuits in the shape of lion’s heads. He knew the shape of the package the moment he laid eyes on it. Tired as he was, a little sugar might give him the jolt he needed to finish some paperwork, so he unwrapped it and opened the tin. It sang a gentle ‘happy birthday’ and he smiled.
Draco snorted. “Just Mother, then. I’m fucked, Potter. I’m dead either way. There’s nowhere he can’t find me.”
Whoever this man in Harry’s head was, Draco didn’t think he could ever live up to it. “Was I very disappointing?” he asked. “Compared to…”
“I know. I just have a story to tell you. And some advice I’d like to ask you. And then… I’ll go, or I’ll stay. I’ll leave that up to you.”
She would have liked to cancel the fucking thing completely, but Robards had issued invitations and there were dozens of people already vying for seats close to where Harry Potter would be sitting. Asking for a few minutes of personal time with him. When Harry eventually reappeared from his room, with Dora perched protectively on his shoulder (an amazing shade of green which really set his eyes off nicely), Hermione launched herself into an apology which Harry apparently wasn’t interested in hearing.
“Well,” Hermione said. “Yes, I suppose I do. I haven’t seen you so much as look at a girl since Ginny. Not that I’ve seen you look at too many bye, either, and… But I’m still glad you decided to say it outright.”
“I was never petty,” Neville said. “My Gran would have…” he shivered. Draco frowned into the table, because he couldn’t imagine Neville’s sainted yet grumpy grandmother doing anything terrible. “She would have made her
“And this is the second: you, and I mean you, Harry… fuck the accolades, fuck the stupid titles journalists like to use to sell papers. You, Harry Potter. You wouldn’t fall in love with someone you had made up in your head. You wouldn’t fall in love with the Draco you never saw again after his trial. I don’t believe for a fucking moment that you were optimistic enough to have imagined the man he is today.
“Goodnight,” Harry said, with a small smile, and Draco watched as he tucked a vial of the potion into his robes and disappeared.
“I’d like to thank you all for the trust you have put in me. I resign my position at the DMLE, effective immediately. I have no plans to work for the next while. I want to focus on my health, and spend time with my friends and family. Thank you.”
Harry nodded briskly and tried to pull away. As if he was trying to get to his feet. Draco took his wrist and pulled him back down.
Rolling his eyes, Draco replied in beautiful script that he was not above Obliviating Harry until he thought he was twenty again and then persuading him to join a professional Quidditch team.
“Happy Christmas, Narcissa,” Harry said, taking Narcissa’s hand to kiss. He didn’t fumble on her name. He’d practised.
“It does, though,” Draco said, letting Harry escape, and stepping closer. “There’s probably some lovely things down there. Just think. Cheeses, and cured meats…”
Draco Malfoy, and you have known him for years. So all this sodding procrastination is because you don’t know how to tell him that.”
“Oh, you are as tiresome as a First Year Hufflepuff. I am trying to tell you that I am not sure there is anyone in the world quite so well suited to you. I believe the two of you could achieve extraordinary things together. Harry Potter, loathsome creature than he is, is a singular wizard, as are you. If anything so mundane as happiness appeals to you then you should know that I believe you could find it with him.” Snape raised his chain. “And if you tell anyone I said so, I will never grace this frame with my presence again.”
Harry returned to his breakfast. And his reading. No, he tried to. Both had become devoid of interest.
For a moment Draco stiffened, surprised and probably uncomfortable. And then she felt his arms move, wrapping around her waist; cautious and polite, until they suddenly weren’t, and he was hanging on for dear life.
Or rather, here was another part of Draco that was afraid — much more afraid — that they’d never get a chance to figure out if this thing, this mad, passionate thing that had been almost thirty years in the making might work in the real world. Draco could be selfish. He knew that, and it didn’t bother him. He wanted this, wanted Harry, wanted to make love the way they had in the pretty bedroom upstairs and make plans and tease each other until they were old men.
“I’ll be in touch when things are quieter,” he said, all business. “If not with you, I’ll call Aditi. For now, I need to close the wards on my Floo. You understand.”
She turned when she heard the door open, and felt a rush of gratefulness when Draco stepped through, dropping his Glamour when he saw who it was.
“I think we’ve established who is fucking who, right now, Harry. And now, my favour, if you please. While I open you up, you’re going to look at me. Don’t close your eyes, Harry. Trust me to take care of you the way you want me to. I promise it will be so good, so, so good.”
“But Hermione is all proprietary about that sort of thing,” Ron said with a leering grin, and bolted up the stairs.
“I love it when you call me darling,” Harry replied, his pupils so wide and black that Draco had to wonder at it.
“Are you going to Ollivander’s in the morning?” Ron asked. Harry shrugged noncommittally. “You have to, Harry. You need a wand.”
Eventually — an hour, maybe two, Draco wasn’t counting, just enjoying himself — Harry rolled over onto his other side and away from Draco. Probably getting too warm. Draco let him. He needed to get up. He had things to do. Not all of them had to do with Harry but most of them did. He wasn’t going to give in to the urge to wake him and shake him and demand to know if he remembered everything and if it had all been real; to kiss Harry from the top of his stupid birds-nest head of hair, still mostly black but shot through with grey, to the toes on his ugly feet, which had done more work than they should ever have had to by the time he had turned eighteen.
“I was his sacrifice. He expected my life to be short, and purposeful, and he did what he could when I could to make sure it went the way it needed to and that once I was at Hogwarts I would feel grateful to have found my place, and desperate to want to do the right thing.”
Hermione checked the clock approximately every six seconds, which did absolutely nothing to make the time pass any faster. Draco was due at noon, and it was already eleven minutes past, and she was fretting. All she ever really seemed to do was fret, these days. It didn’t matter that Harry was getting the best possible care. He was so far away. She couldn’t sit at his bedside in the evenings and talk to him, and she still wasn’t sure she could trust Malfoy to do that. Talk to him. Be kind.
Draco waited for a long moment for an elaboration, but none was forthcoming. So. “For fuck’s sake, Emrys. What are you trying to say?”
“I wish you could find your way to calling me Hermione,” she said. She watched as Draco cast his diagnostic charms. And cringed as Draco gently pinched the skin on Harry’s arm. “What was that for?”
“You’ve never in all the years I’ve known you shown a single shred of interest in a woman. It seemed like a fair bet.” Emrys looked over the water. “Relationships that develop out of a therapeutic arrangement… don’t end well,” he said, cautiously. “But they end
“I’ll need to speak to Mr Weasley, as well. Ron, specifically, I know there are a lot of them. Separately. I know the three of you are close, but if there is any chance at all that there are answers that might differ if you are together I need to keep you apart. This isn’t negotiable, I’m afraid. I’m sure you understand. Perhaps it would be easier if Ron took me to the house again.”
“Hey, listen,” Harry said, drawing Neville away from the crowd a moment, clutching the paper bag to his chest. “You don’t know anything about Draco Malfoy, do you? Haven’t heard anything at Hogwarts, or…”
“Aunt Andromeda,” Malfoy said, next. He handed over one of his envelopes. “I’ve placed some money in a Gringott’s vault to safeguard Teddy’s future, and yours. The details are in here. There is a letter from my mother, as well. If you don’t want to read it, I ask you not to destroy it, but put it somewhere safe. She asked me to make sure I said that. But I don’t think she’d be angry if you tossed it in the fire.”
They were staring at each other. Harry felt a flicker of something warm over his spine. Draco’s mouth was so close to his eyes, and he could look, couldn’t he? When he was smiling, Draco’s mouth looked —
Harry nodded seriously each time, and Draco, for his part, pretended not to notice that Harry’s hands were shaking slightly and that he seemed to be waiting for a chance to say something that was on his mind.
“Blimey, Draco,” Neville said, during a lull, when a buxom new bartender had brought them two flagons of ale, sensing very correctly that Draco had no need of more Firewhiskey.
Harry laughed. “Oh, shut up, Ron. I came straight here. I’m fine.” Still unaccountably aroused. Still imagining that Draco had kissed him instead of punching him. But
“Get your fingers out of my hair, Potter,” he said, summoning up all the willpower he could locate (there was damnably little) and pulling away, just a little.
“If you want a sausage, I’ve got one for you,” Harry said. “There’s nothing in the larder. Not for years. That door won’t open. You know that.”
“Do you have to wait for a reply?” Draco asked. She was an extraordinarily expressive owl. Draco shouldn’t have been able to decipher ‘no, but I have to wait for a reaction’, but he did. He found a box of dried mice in the bottom of his pantry and passed her one. She looked unimpressed. He dug out his own supply of dried venison, a good snack for long evenings working, and she was much happier with that. Of course the personal owl of the Minister for Magic had airs and standards. Deplorable.
It seemed like a letter he should open in private, but it also seemed as though Madam Shacklebolt knew what the letter said, and was waiting for him to read it. He broke the seal, and slipped the piece of parchment out, open it carefully.
Blaise removed his hood. “Yeah. Two Aurors got turned into werewolves that day. Another four ended up in St Mungo’s for a week or more. Someone messed with Potter’s portkey, never did figure out who. He got there late, but he still made sure no one was killed. Including the… well, ‘Mione called them a terrorist cell at the time but it sounds so…
He was in love with Harry sodding Potter, with his stupid martyr complex and his tragic backstory and the things he’d done, the strength he’d had to do what was right no matter how difficult it was. He loved Harry, and he had since long before he’d taken the Dark Mark. He loved Harry at least as much as he hated him, wanted him more than all of that. Lived for his stupid smiles, when they were real, when they crinkled his eyes; lived for the moments of honesty between them, even when they were awful.
He continued to read through the files, but Hermione had only given him closed cases, as he’d begun to realise just before dawn. The team had done excellent work in his absence. In fact, he wondered if his absence had been to their benefit. Without having him to rely on they had all pushed themselves harder, done better. It warmed him to the bones.
The expression on his face was entirely peaceful. He looked as if he’d taken a book to bed, and simply died, right there.
Hermione probably knew how Wandmakers got the magical core into a wand. He’d ask her in the morning.
“Come on,” Blaise said, taking her hand as they walked down the hill and through the scattered trees. “We’re nearly there, love. Just keep your eyes open.”
“I need all the current case files,” Harry said, evenly. “And I need to know what my cover is, because I know everyone thinks I’ve been in Hungary, but…” he trailed off, and sat down heavily.
“You’ve been obsessed with Draco Malfoy for almost as long as I’ve known you,” Hermione said, wistfully. “Perhaps not always for good reasons. I hear he has become a good man, though. Are you really so frightened?”
Oh, whatever had happened in the two days since Harry had finally woken up… it wasn’t what she’d imagined. Not after seeing the memory of Harry waking happily with Draco in a brightly lit bedroom at Twelve Grimmauld Place. Not after watching Draco change from a caring Healer to a worried friend, seen the anger at Harry’s Muggle relatives and his fear that Harry might never wake up. Draco was clinging to her because he needed to cling to someone, and Harry —
Late that night, Harry found himself sitting at the desk in his bedroom alone. Ron and Hermione were attempting a date night at a Muggle Gastropub, apparently. He was enjoying the quiet, the music on his record player, and debating asking Arthur Weasley if he knew a trick to make a television work without electricity. And he was turning a beautiful twig around and around in his hand. There was something very powerful about the thing. Powerful, and pretty. It was only about six inches long, too short to be a wand, really, but…
Draco led Harry out to the front patio to watch the enchanted snow fall. In Narcissa wanted a white Christmas, she made one herself.
A part of Draco had wanted to lie. He still remembered that. Saying no, he hadn’t known if it was Potter or not. Be sent to Azkaban, and hope to be dead within the year. He wanted to lie because he’d had a fitful of being saved by Harry Sodding Potter and he wanted to make his own stupid decisions, just once.
“I think you might be onto something there,” Potter replied wearily, sitting on a tall stool at the bench. “I —”
“This is Harry Potter we’re talking about. Dying for the people he loves was probably one of his better days. Sodding martyr,” Draco finished, grumbling, and climbing to his feet. “I have to get back to him.”
The last time he had done this, he’d had two other Aurors with him to help. Harry was too much raw power and not enough focus, always had been. Even so, he kept the chant up, fine wandwork that he hadn’t been sure he was still capable of, and by the time Headmaster McGonagall and Madam Pomfrey were crowded around the unconscious form of Draco Malfoy, the dark was beginning to allow itself to be pulled into the bottle.
“Come in,” she said, holding the door open. And then, to the guards, “Healer Black is to be treated as a valued guest at all times. Ensure that message is received across the entire division. Now, as you were.”
just Stun and Body-Bind me for a few hours. You could listen to yourself talk, I wouldn’t be forced to listen to you talk, and I’d finally get a little sleep.”
Harry looked up, alarmed, deep shadows under his eyes and a guilty expression. “Hullo, ‘Mione… Minister,” he corrected, as she threw herself into his arms.
He got a number of his wishes right away, all in one go, late in the afternoon, when Harry stormed into his quarters with such ebullience and energy that it nearly stopped Draco’s heart in his chest. His eyes went very wide, as he took in the room — apparently, he’d forgotten that Narcissa was coming back to finish her decorating today and apparently, he liked it.
“Oh, Molly… I’m sorry. You didn’t have to do that.” Harry led her a few steps into the kitchen. Over the last few years they’d grown closer. Honest. Molly was less of a parent and more like… well, Harry thought of the friends he had who got along well with a particular Auntie or Uncle, and how they could be easier to talk to than a parents. “Really, I should be apologising to you. You opened your home to him because I asked you to, even though… and I made a huge error in judgement. I forgot the tale of the scorpion and the frog. The frog would be very disappointed with me.” He smiled tightly, but didn’t bother trying to laugh.
“I’ll show you to your quarters,” she said, as Harry summoned his trunks to follow them into the castle. “I am very glad you agreed to join us, Harry.” That she said nothing more suggested she had talked at length with Delilah Shacklebolt, and Harry found he didn’t mind.
“Er,” Harry said. In all honesty he wasn’t a great reader. “Mostly homework. Some educational theory, for class planning. Or when I need to be bored to sleep.”
Harry glared murderously at him. “Get out of my room, Malfoy, or I’ll hex your balls off.” But Malfoy, stupid git, rolled his eyes and sat down on the end of the bed. “How did you get into Gryffindor Tower?”
“Sounds like the sort of law only a complete swot would make up,” Draco said with a snort, easing himself down to sit cross-legged on the floor in front of the fireplace with a second mug of tea.
“So, on a score of, say, Sirius to your Mother, how did I do?” Harry asked, leaning against the balustrade.
“Of course,” Harry said. “Listen, I’ll bring you some pyjamas. You leave those clothes out. They need laundering.”
