He stopped in front of a house with a bright yellow door. Slowly he gathered the courage and knocked.
They talk and go to their room
Before he had a chance to check or even say anything Hermione beat hit to it. “Draco I’m glad you could make it. Harry cannot shut about you.” He felt his cheeks heating up.
He didn’t know how long he was starring when suddenly Draco’s voice brought him back to reality. “Are you alright, Harry?”
“I hate your friends.” Harry looked at Draco’s punting face that perfectly complemented his messy hair.
Once again he got lost in his thoughts, this time Andromeda brought him back to reality. “Draco, dear could you help me with Teddy?” When he looked up Andromeda was standing above him holding Teddy by his armpits, his cousin’s legs were swinging from one side to the other reminding Draco of the old clock from the Manor. Without saying anything he took Teddy and sat him on his lap. “Thank you.” He watched as his aunt moved to the kitchen and started on the dinner. “What’s on your mind?”
“How early?” Draco sounded tired just thinking about waking up early what made Harry smiled.
Harry smiled at him, the smiled looked sad and Draco realized that he knew the answer. “Probably not, but one can hope.” And Draco hoped.
Hello,
“There you are Ron, you just ran away and I didn’t know where you went. Are you alright, mate?” Draco smiled at Harry’s concerned tone, the boy had no idea what about to happen.
“I don’t need another person to pamper me about food. I don’t know why everyone thinks that I have a problem with eating.” Draco sounded exasperated, Harry just thought that he looked cute.
“He didn’t have a right to ask about this.” Wasn’t it obvious that Draco wouldn’t hurt anyone? The worse sin that the boy in front of him committed was the fact that he wanted to please people.
They were on Diagon Alley for half an hour when the first problem arose.
“Oh, Draco you don’t have to repay Andy. She did it because she loves you. You no longer have to feel like a burden Draco, trust me.” Without hesitation, he gathered the blond in his arms and hugged him tightly. “Come on I thought we have books to check out.” The blond hugged him back and quickly escaped from his embrace to open the door.
“If you up for tea Harry is still downstairs with Teddy and I’m sure that it will make you feel a little bit better. You can never go wrong with tea.” Draco didn’t know how thirsty he was until he heard tea
“Does it matter? I was ordered to do it, so I don’t really have a choice.” Like always he thought grimly.
Quickly she scolded her expression into something more professional and started to explain. “Mr Black you see I believe that the shadow that hunts your dreams is, in fact, a part of you.” Draco looked at her and wanted to protest just as Harry started to cough. The witch looked at them unimpressed and gestured for them to settle down. “Let me explain, you were brought up in a very strict way, I imagine that your parents didn’t want you to interact with people that weren’t deemed worthy.” He nodded and looked down. “There’s really nothing to be ashamed of. Because of the fact that your parents wanted to turn you into a miniature version of them, your mind didn’t create a space in which you can be yourself. Don’t misunderstand me, Mr Black you may find forest calming, many people do, but this forest is bare, untouched.”
Be yourself and don't be afraid to say no once in a while.

“Harry, could you help me move him. There is something extremely wrong going on.” She heard as Harry came closer. He didn’t have his wand anymore.
He felt as someone nagged him on the shoulder, when he looked up he saw that it was Ginny. “Go to him.” She smiled at him and Harry could do nothing but follow her instruction.
His mother was always schooling him on what to eat and what not to eat, how to behave and how to perfect his Malfoy mask of no emotions. His father, on the other hand, wanted him to be stronger and smarter than others, so he tutored him in his future school subjects as well as in politics and family history.
“I may have slightly dislocated my shoulder again.” He watched as Harry sighed and walked back to the cottage to retrieve the healing potion. “Am I grounded?”
Draco wanted nothing more but spend the whole afternoon with Harry in Hogsmeade, but since their last heated make-out session in the library, he couldn’t stop thinking about how Harry shivered when he started to kiss his neck. He couldn’t erase the image of Harry’s eyes after their kiss, blown pupils and quicken breath. Draco was aware of the fact that he was no better, if Granger didn’t disturb them he would probably lose control.
“Harry… I need you… need you to fuck me.” Draco’s voice was trembling and Harry knew that he couldn’t wait any longer.
The feast is eaten and now it is time to talk.
McGonagall was silent, Harry looked up and noticed that she was lost in thoughts. After a moment she asked. “What changed?”
The breath that now was on Harry’s throat made it almost impossible to focus. “Yeah like what”
Harry’s smile grew. “Are you sure?” Draco coaxed himself up and kissed him.
Trans people are valid, non-binary people are valid, asexual people exist and are valid, questioning people are also valid!
“Draco stop, you did nothing wrong. Your parents didn’t want to be saved, I know that this may not be enough for you but you are an amazing person and if they didn’t change for you then there’s no redemption for them.” He paused and look at the boy next to him. Draco was still shaking but wasn’t as bad as earlier, his right hand was still interlocked with Harry’s and this made him actually voice the little speech that built up in his head. “ I’m proud of you because you survived. You didn’t lay down and waited for your parents to kill you, you stood up and faced them. And I spoke with Luna, she told me that you always helped them as much as you could. Sometimes a warm blanket and a hot meal are all that one can do and you did it. You deserve forgiveness Draco. You deserve to live and I wanna live with you.”
The N.E.W.T.s came quickly after the April Fool’s Day, but Harry supposed that he shouldn’t be complaining. Without the constant threat to his life for the first time in eighteen years, he could say that he was truly prepared for the exams. Not only was he on top of his homework, but he also learned a lot of new things that could potentially help him in his future job.
Draco took his hand, and Harry could do only one thing. He leaned and kissed the blond, trying to push everything he was feeling into the kiss. When they pulled back to take a breath, Draco was smiling, and Harry quickly kissed him on his jawline.
Finally, at his words the Slytherin looked up, his expression was unreadable. He watched as Draco slowly sit up and continued. “In the second year I told Narcissa that I thought Blaise was handsome, she told me to never say that again, then she told Lucius and that was one of the worst nights at the manor. I was to be a perfect heir and I was to marry a pure blood woman and have pure blood children, but I couldn’t do it if I liked boys, so my father decided that he can beat it out of me.” Once again the blond paused, but this time he looked at Harry. “At the gallery when I saw these paintings. I don’t know what to believe Harry.”
I hope you all had a pleasant Monday and that all of you stay safe and wear a mask to the protests and just generally.
Black Lives Matter and they always mattered and always will. Remember that most of the history that you know was whitewashed!
“What with the long face?” Surprisingly it was not Harry that asked the question, but Hermione.
At the mention of the even Draco’s expression changed and he looked sadder. “My father appareted us and then when the attacks happened he made a House Elf get me home and joined the Death Eaters.”
After they cleaned up and cuddled on the sofa, Draco knew that he couldn’t postpone this conversation anymore. Slowly he detangled from Harry’s warm body and looked at him. Harry looked surprised and concerned.
“Yes, these are the best days and soon there will be more and more of them. The Grimmold has a very big backyard. I’m also almost certain that if I ask for this tree they would give it to me.” The comment meant to make Draco smile, but Harry was aware of the fact that the ministry would do anything he wanted without questioning it.
Carefully he watched Harry looking for any kind of reaction, for a moment there was nothing, but then a brilliant smile appeared on his face.
The two of them followed her, he stayed close to Draco so that if one of the patrons tries to harm him in any way he would be able to stop them.
It was the 1st of September, and Harry was once again standing at King Cross station waiting for the Hogwarts express to disappear. This time Draco, Andromeda and Harper, who was a year younger than Teddy and insisted on going with them, were with him, the rest of their family thankfully stayed with Hermione, Ron and their children. Harry knew that this was harder for the two than for him. Teddy was hugging his grandma, and Draco was ruffling his hair.
Quickly Draco stood and moved to face Harry. The bracelet was mostly all black and made out of thin straps, the pendant was gold, a colour that complemented Harry’s shin tone, and in a shape of a snitch, between the snitches wings a small emerald, that reminded Draco of Harry’s eyes, was placed. With shaking fingers, he fastened the bracelet oh Harry’s right wrist and smiled.
“I didn’t know you have company. I can come back later if this is not a good time.” He could feel his whole body tens again.
“I can’t believe I’m here with you.” Draco smiled at the comment and pressed a kiss to the shorter boy’s lips.
“Andromeda, you cannot think like this. I’m sure that Malfoy wouldn’t want that. Besides, you are helping now and that’s what matters.” But Harry couldn’t stop thinking. What would happen if he noticed, would he be able to help?
“Come on, just pick a shirt.” He could imagine Hermione laughing at him for talking to himself.
Be yourself and keep fighting!
Sorry for the break my explanation is simple a lot is happening in Europe now. Firstly the treatment of the LGBTQIA+ community in Poland is getting worse. Currently, people are protesting, during these protests, the police are acting like assholes, there were beating the protesters and even arrested innocent people are were going back home form shopping.
At Draco’s words, McGonagall stepped to the side and let them into the room. Harry already knew how the office looked like so he didn’t bother looking around, but he noticed that Draco was still taking the room in.
Quickly Hermione put a book between them before Harry could kiss Draco. “Harry seriously. I’m sure that the whole castle knows by now. If you two want to stay behave some of us want to actually study.”
“Nonsense, you are one of the many people that treated Hogwarts as a safe place and yet this was taken from you. You see Albus Percival Wulfric Brian Dumbledore was a great man, who helped many people, but he also closed his eyes on many things. Your suffering was one that he chose to ignore, I'm sure he knew what was happening at your house and what you needed to do during your 6th-year. I’m sorry that you were overlooked and even though it was clear to see that you needed help it was not given to you.”
This couldn't be that easy, could it? It was a way to improve his unconscious, but the shadow would stay. “This is a solution for one problem, the forest, but what about the shadow?”
Harry took his hand and guided him to their table Neville following behind them. This time no one made a move to stop them.  The three of them sat down and Harry immediately put some food on Draco’s plate.
“You heard him, Andy, it seems that I am staying.” Draco was glad that Harry didn’t sound disappointed or angry. “I just have to say Ron and Hermione not to wait up for me. We kinda got separated.” Looking around Draco noticed that he could see the couple anywhere.
Please side with the right side of history and don't be an asshole!
“The dinner is ready boys, it’s time to eat.” She smiled at them and added. “You can continue later.”
Harry was worried, he knew that there would be some backlash when he decided to start a relationship with Draco, but he was not expecting the groups of people to approach him every day asking if his relationship was a joke or if perchance he was blackmailed into it. Some even went as far as trying to convince him that Draco used an unforgivable on him or dosed him with a love potion. The more he had to explain that he, in fact, was sane and that he was happy with Draco the more annoyed he got.
Love all of you and thanks for the comments and likes!
“If you allow me.” Harry was sure that McGonagall sensed Draco’s hesitation and wanted to give him an option, by the, also knew that this was the only way to understand what is happening to him.
After a moment of silence, he decided to give her only the basic reason. “I wanted to know if occlumency can somehow interfere with dreams, Hermione was just curious and decided to help me with the research.”
“This was after your 3rd year. Harry, I will never forget when he was crying and asking me for forgiveness because he put my family in danger. This was the last time I saw him, at least till his trial and now today. I can’t be sure as to what happened to him before he got here, but from what I gathered he just left his home for good. I can’t say I blame him, after everything he was still stuck with them at the manor and I think the war didn’t make his parents any kinder.” Her voice was trembling and Harry hated to see Andromeda like this, but he needed to know.
What is the gang up to a year after Hogwarts?
“Do you want to have a prank war with me?” Draco looked up and turned to him.
When he finally was able to look at Harry the boy was gaping at him, this made him smile but finally, he answered. “I think this was the best night of sleep I had in a while. Thanks.” At his words Harry’s face lit up with a smile and Draco would do anything for it to never disappear
Finally, she broke the silence. “I’m sorry to hear that.” Her voice didn’t betray anything, he didn’t know what she wanted to accomplish.
He woke up and for the first time since the shadow appeared he wasn’t terrified. Trying to move he discovered that Harry was wrapped around him. The previous day came back to him. The gallery, the talk with Harry and falling asleep in his arms. He could feel the blush appearing on his face. Carefully he detached himself from Harry’s arms and took his sketchbook. He didn’t use it since the war started, but now he could, he was allowed to do what he wanted. Producing a charcoal piece, he started to sketch the sleeping form of the Boy Who Lived. He knew that it won’t be his best work, he was pretty rusty but he wanted to practice again, to feel the paper under his hands.
“Why would she do this?” The fact that Draco truly sounded puzzled made Harry sad.
The dinner at the burrow
“Goodbye, Draco” he watched as she neared the fireplace and disappeared.
Welcome to the scheduled ice cream break. Enjoy!
For a moment Harry thought that he was wrong when they entered the whole great hall was silent. No one was moving, every single person stared at the four of them and then the spell was broken when people started to stand up and clamp. He wanted to run, but then he saw as some Gryffindor that was standing near Draco got a hold of his robe and tugged him down. Harry could hear as the Gryffindor spoke, his voice was full of hatred. “The clapping not for you, you dirty Death Eater scum.”
Polish LGBTQIA+ community I know this is not much, but I see you and you are people and all of you are valid and beautiful so don't be ashamed and fight the assholes!
After placing the last rose petal on the floor, a knock sounded on the door and Draco quickly turned around and opened the door.
Draco was furious, finally, something good happened to him, Harry kissed him so he was sure that the feelings that he has are mutual, but then Harry ran and Draco was once again left alone.
Harry didn’t know what to answer to this. Had this been happening every night? Did Draco had a good night of sleep since the fifth year? As the question grew and grew Harry looked at him. Draco was still shaking and Harry knew that he has to do something. “Do you think that Voldemort’s presence near you triggered something or has something else happened at the same time?”
Draco looked at her and for the first time thought about the forest. What the headmistress said was true, the forest was always a calming place for him. When he was upset he always wandered in the forest that surrendered the Manor, so this wasn’t really a surprise. But when he conjured an image of the forest that was in his dreams there were no similarities. His forest looked like something taken from the horror films that Harry was so fond of. The image that he saw made him anxious as if he was back home waiting for another lesson, another blow.
“Apparently they kissed because of the war nothing more. Luna figured out that she prefers to kiss girls, preferably redheads and Neville is still figuring his stuff out.”
“Maybe after we eat. I've got Treacle Tart” Harry smiled, he could get used to this.
“You kidding, the ferret did this. I would like to see his father’s face when he heard these words.” Harry knew that he shouldn’t laugh, but Ron somehow made everything better.
She remembered the movement and hoped that she was right. She knew how Lucius works and if this was his work perhaps she still had time to save Draco.
“Because she is wired like that. She sees someone who needs taking care of and she is the first in line to do it. I think every mom is like this.”
The smiled on the blond’s face was wicked and Harry almost shivered. “Okay, Harry. You’re on, but remember no help from Hermione, Ron or any other Weasley. You are the brain and muscle of the operation.” Draco’s voice was cold and determined, somehow Harry felt as if he played right into the Slytherin’s game.
Harry stood in the middle of the kitchen looking anxiously from Draco to the door. Before Harry could escape him Draco quickly moved towards him.
Draco turned and looked at him with a shocked expression. “I’m able to babysit on my own Harry.” The emotions behind this statement were not hatred, so Harry knew that he could persuade Draco.
Just as the three of them made their way to the 8
Now to the scheduled reminders:
Trans people are valid, non-binary people are valid and asexual people are valid and part of the community!
The letter he received was short and most likely extremely boring, but that didn't matter, what mattered was the fact that Harry’s hair changed to a particular shade of blond that looked hilarious on him. From across the table he watched as Ron noticed the change, before Harry did, and started to laugh at the raved-haired boy, soon Hermione joined him and looked at Draco. She smiled and gave his thumbs-up, which made Harry very confused. The Gryffindor quickly picked up his spoon and noticed the change. Draco’s smile only grew when the Boy-Who-Lived glared at him. April Fools’ Day just began and Draco couldn't wait on Harry’s revenge.
Black Lives Matter, they always matter and always will matter! this is something that is a constant and will never be changed.
If you are white like me remember to educate yourself.
“Harry, I need to talk to you.” He tried to keep his voice even.
When Harry started to stir he quickly hid his sketchbook and smiled at the waking boy. “Hi.”
Hello, only 6 chapters lest, how are you all feeling about this?
After McGonagall stopped talking he wanted nothing but to walk back and cover himself under a dozen blankets.  Once again his parents are a cause for all of his problems. “Let’s say I believe in your theory, this still doesn’t explain why the shadow only appeared when Voldemort took residence in the Manor.”
everything always goes to shit if you're not careful enough
Hello,
When their argument started to come to a close Draco noticed that the boy in his arms started to yawn, he turned towards Andromeda. “Teddy is falling asleep. We need to go before he attaches himself to me.”
“Thanks, I appreciate it.”
“It’s okay, have fun. Bye Harry, Hermione, Ron, Draco.” Neville didn’t sound offended so Harry just moved to drag Draco away, but the blond stands rotten in place.
Draco didn’t know what to do so he stood awkwardly next to the door waiting for any indication that would tell him the next step he should take. He heard as the man shut the door and moved to stand next to the desk. After what felt like forever he looked at the man and found that he was looking back. Draco couldn’t read his expression, which made him worry more.
Andromeda’s arms were tightly wrapped around him. He couldn’t breathe. Vaguely he heard Andromeda tell Potter to help her move him to a guest room. He couldn’t stand
Quickly Harry focused on the task before him, picking up the familiar knife was easy, he started to slice the ingredient his cubes came out uneven no matter how hard he tried to get them to match. Soon a hand appeared on his making him stop what he was doing. Draco was behind him, his left hand hugged Harry’s waist while his right slowly slid toward his wrist, the motion making Harry shiver. Draco’s hand finally made its way to his and the long finger closed around Harry’s slightly shaky hand.
“I – Yes, I would love to shopping with you.” He could see a smile forming on Harry’s face, the felt proud that it was because of him.
“Brilliant. Finish your melting ice cream and let’s go.” Draco looked down at his hand and found that it was in fact covered in melted ice cream. He felt his face redden. “Don’t worry, there’s a toilet inside.”
He felt Andromeda’s hand closing around him. “Draco it’s not your fault, it never was and it will never be, do you understand? What your father did was wrong and no one should be hurt by someone they trust. He cursed you Draco, what he used was black magic and it never should be used on another person.” Somehow when she acknowledges that what happened to him was bad he felt a little lighter.
“Don’t worry about them as long as I’m behind the bar they won’t do anything.” She smiled at them once again and led them back to the bar.
-year had its perks.
This chapter is a little longer so I hope that y'all will enjoy it!
“Honestly, I’m just happy that Draco will stop the pacing. I thought that he going to make a hole with all his anxious energy.” This and the playful tone which Andromeda used brought a smile to Harry's face. Additionally, knowing that Draco was as nervous as he made him feel a little better.
Wear a mask, don't let assholes get to you.
“It was better than the last try.” Draco looked at her. “Nothing exploded.”
“I’m sure. Do you like it?” This time a slight frown appeared on Draco’s face.
“Why are you nice to me? I made your life a living hell and now you are here with me. Why do you care?” The look on Draco face was hunting, his eyes were red and his pale face was almost translucent.
Harry looked at Draco, who started to laugh. “Say bye to your peace, Harry.” He just glared at the blond.
“Are you two aware that I don’t need a babysitter  and that I’m perfectly capable of taking care of myself?” Even though his expression was full of furry he was aware that voice lack any trace of anger.
Draco looked back down at his little cousin and noticed that the excitement started to die down a little. “Well the sooner the better, the little guy isn’t going to last much longer.” Just as he said it the duo appeared next to Harry.
Stay safe and fight for justice <3
“How did you put it there. I’m pretty sure that I would have noticed.” Draco smiled.
When Draco first found out about the dinner he made Andromeda promise to him that she will go first to make sure that all the Weasleys were okay with him attending. After his aunt left he was to wait for five minutes and if she didn’t come back in this time then it meant that it was okay for him to go.
For the first time they ate in silence, Harry found it a little difficult to eat with only one hand but he didn’t want to let go of Draco’s hand. When he looked at the boy next to him he noticed that Draco was pushing his food around his plate without actually eating it. He frowned Andromeda told him that Draco still had difficulties with eating when he was nervous.
After a moment Draco looked at the duo with a blank mask firmly in place. “Goodbye gentleman I will be seeing you in the future.” With that, his boyfriend turned around and walk towards him and his friends.
Harry knew that this comment would be harmless for almost everyone, but not for Draco. He tensed beside him and Harry had to stop himself from hugging the boy.
Also, I will be glad if you let me know what you think about this chapter because I don't know if I like it or if I hate it
Hi once again,
All three of them watched as Draco shifted in his seat and begun the story.
“I wonder if you are McGonagall’s new favourite student.” Upon noticing the sceptical look that Draco shoot at Potter, the boy who lived only smiled wider and added. “I mean you were daydreaming during her class and you don’t even get detention, trust me you’re the first”
She noticed when Draco started to look worse and worse, she knew that this time she had to do something. The talk after her lesson gave her hope, she knew how the boy was brought up and that for him asking for help was something that he still considered bad, but she reminded herself to stay positive after all a Potter was his friend. Stubbornness was in Harry Potter’s blood and it was twice as strong as it was in his father, Lilly Evans was a brilliant and extremely stubborn witch. The boy was in good hands and she was sure that eventually, he would cave in and finally she would be able to do something.
“Well, you were the one who decided to put this masterpiece in my bag.” Picking up the piece he showed the drawing to Ron and Hermione.
At this moment all he wanted was to just stop. He was eating just like always, maybe even less, his appetite still didn't come back after the horrible 6th year, but his mother just had to find something to comment on.
Suddenly McGonagall appeared in front of their table. “Are you boys finished?”
“Yes?” Malfoy’s voice is slightly higher than normal and Harry notices that he griped his left forearm.
He reached for Harry’s hand and together they went after his aunt. She led them to a room that he didn’t recall, he was almost sure that it was not there during summer. Andromeda stopped in front of the door and turned towards them. Draco looked at her when she caught his eye Andromeda stepped to the right and he saw the door. In the middle of the door, his name was written in Andromeda’s neat handwriting.
Harry wanted to say something more, but Draco cut him off. “He had every right. He was doing his job and he said that he believed me.” Draco still sounded small, but at least he was talking and Harry counted this as a victory.
Minerva looked at the two teenagers in her office and she hated that even after all they’ve been through they still cannot catch a break. They reminded her so much of her earlier pupils. Sirius Black and James Potter the boys that always brought trouble, the boys who she couldn’t save. This time she will do anything in her power to change the outcome. She will not allow for any more death on her watch.
Harry blinked and looked at Draco. “Hmmm...” Draco just pointed at the ice cream stand. “Oh, yeah.”
Nothing in his wardrobe was good enough. Harry slowly left his room in Grimmauld Place and made his way to Ron and Hermione’s room. He wasn’t sure if his friends were still there so after a moment of consideration he decided to knock.
I just wanna say that Black Lives Matter and they always mattered and always will matter.
“What’s going on? Why were you laughing?”
She helped the boy stand up, Harry on his other side. She could hear as Draco was trying to talk, but all his words were slurring together. Andromeda knew he wasn’t drunk even if he acted like it.
McGonagall looked at him sceptically, but when she spoke he couldn’t hear the suspicion in her voice. “I see. If you haven’t found anything yet, I recommend talking with someone who is a specialist on the matter or someone who practised the matter longer. I also recommend you ask for help you are not alone this time Mr black.” Draco noticed that for a moment she had a weird nostalgic expression, but quickly she scolded her face into more professional.
“Oh, that’s brilliant. Then I will be here tomorrow at noon. As for now do you want to play or watch a movie?”
His mother wasn’t as involved in the Dark Lord’s cult as his father was. Narcissa only followed her husband. She only wanted her son to be safe. Draco knew that the act of concerned mother she was presenting was just that an act, but what could he do. He knew that he would only suffer if he opened his mouth.
“Nothing really, I’m sorry for reacting like this.” The crying mostly stopped at this point, but Harry knew that Draco could start again any second.
“But it is, it’s all my fault. If I didn’t talk back he wouldn’t do it. I should have known better. I told them I quit. I told him that I if they want to kill someone then they can just kill each other. I don’t know what came over me. I’m sorry” The tears didn’t stop and he was so sick of crying.
Another thing is that I'm still trying to work out some details, mostly I wonder if I should make Draco a seer (I really like the trop of seer!Draco) or not. I'm also trying to work out how Harry would behave if his parents were alive, I think that he would be more confident and a little more proud, but I also don't want to make him an asshole. So as y'all can see I have to consider a lot of things if you want to help you can comment your ideas under this fic and I will definitely consider them.
Still wrapped around Draco, Harry slowly lifted his head. “What did McGonagall wanted?” Draco was silent and Harry thought that he won’t get an answer to his question.
She could see that throughout the whole exchange with Ron, Harry’s eyes were locked on her. She looked at him and saw that there was a question she could easily decipher. She knew that she had to give her response, she didn’t feel ready.
Slowly he rose from the floor “I said I quit. If you want to beat someone to death just kill each other” he knew that he should shut up, but he couldn’t stop himself. After finally saying what he wanted for so long he felt as if a veil was lifted, he was free. “Don’t expect me at dinner don’t expect o ever see me again. I truly hope you both rot in this house.” He turned around and felt as some spell hit him. He didn’t have time to wonder what kind of spell or curse was send his way. Quickly, he went to his room, took his packet bags and apparated away from the manor.
When he was all in Harry started to move inside the blonde giving him time to adjust to the new feeling. When Draco started to move rhythmically with him, Harry picked up his pace, looking for Draco’s prostate. The Slytherin looked magnificent under Harry, his whimpers and cries of pleasure only made Harry move faster. Soon he found the exact place he was looking for when Draco’s whole body shuddered and his cries grown louder.
“You kidding, we are actually going to room together?” Harry saw as the smile was slowly disappearing, the boy slowly nodded and Harry presented him with the biggest smile that he could muster.
After all, three of them sat down, he immediately looked at Draco. The boy was pale, even paler than he was at the station and Harry hated that they couldn’t just eat in peace. “Are you okay?”
To her surprise this time Harry took a hold of Draco’s hand without any hesitation. The boys look at each other and nodded their heads, then Draco looked at her. “What do I need to do?”
The boys are back at home
“I’ve never heard you swear in front of him, but I agree. It’s just that I can’t stop thinking that everyone will always see me as a carbon copy of my father and now I even have this stupid tattoo to prove their point.” He couldn’t’ help looking at his left forearm. “I just want to do something right for once in my life.”
I see you, I support you and I with you in this fight. <3
“But you still love me.” Even though this was a statement Draco felt a need for Harry’s reassurance.
A moment later he looked at the pamphlet and read the name of the exhibition for the first time. The pamphlet read
“Draco you know that I hate this hero-worship bullshit.” Harry’s voice was colder and Draco almost shutter.
“Did you show the toad to Draco?” Sam nodded eagerly, and Harry ruffled his head. “Good. Come on, buddy. Lets set the table okay?” Sam nodded and followed Harry to the cottage Draco smiled and was about to leave as well when Harper landed in front of him.
“10 am don’t worry we can sleep in for a little while.” Draco audibly exhaled, and Harry couldn’t help but kiss the bond once again. “Oh, I just saw Pandora and Fred Jr put something greenish into George’s drink, should I be worried?” He watched as Draco’s faced scrunched in confusion, then cleared and a smiled appeared.
Draco didn't know where Hermione and Ron disappeared to but he also really didn’t care. Harry was still by his side and they were still holding hands which was a good sign. Slowly they made their way around the gallery, stopping at every painting.
When they stopped near George’s chair Harry was confused for a moment, everything looked normal, then George’s hand that still held his cup started to disappear. Harry blinked and shook his head, but the redhead's hand was gone or invisible as he was still holding the cup. Suddenly Angelina screamed and pointed at George’s hands, the redhead looked down and jumped out of his seat.
He was also aware that all the negative comments and the hostile behaviour towards Draco were not helping the blond. After the first time, they fell asleep together, they quickly decided that they quite like it so they continue to sleep in the same bed and while at the beginning both of them were more relaxed, now that the comments became more frequent Harry could tell that Draco’s problems with sleep returned. The boy often shifted in his sleep and looking at the eye bags that once again took a permanent residence under Draco's eyes as well as the fact that the blond began to fall asleep in the library or during boring classes Harry could tell that sleep became a problem once again. He worried that with the return of Draco’s nightmares the Slytherin will once again be afraid to sleep.
“Yeah, I’m okay.” He smiled at the Slytherin, who smiled back and went back to packing. Observing the blond, he made a decision, this Holidays he either will get a boyfriend or will have to get rid of some very strong feelings.
year, the feeling of uneasiness lessen and Draco could breathe a little better. All the chatter in the Hall was silenced with one glance from the new headmistress.

Slowly Harry guided the Slytherin onto the bed and move to kiss him behind the ear just like Draco did to him in the library. The moan that escaped the Slytherin lips almost made him stop and look at the blond’s face, but instead, he started to suck on the spot.
“Draco you were just a scared boy.” The tenderness in Harry’s voice almost made him believe that his words were true, but he couldn’t look up and see if Harry meant it.
“I think he will forgive us when he discovers that he finally has a sibling.” He said after he calmed down.
Draco woke up drenched in sweat after shifting toa little to the left he discovered that  Harry was next to him still asleep. He didn’t know what was wrong for the past few months he was better, usually, he could seep through the whole night, but since their return to Hogwarts, Draco found himself unable to sleep.
He looked at Harry’s emerald eyes and even though he could still feel the throb that the hex lest he quickly pecked Harry’s lips and begun to eat.
“Just be here with me, hold me and don’t let me break even more.” Harry kissed his forehead once again, then answer him in a very determined tone. “I can do this.”
“What happened Draco? Can you tell me what’s going on?” He felt so weak.
“I’m not a monster. I made some bad choices because I wanted to protect people who didn’t deserve it. Yes, I stupidly thought that once the war would end they would stop being shitty parents and finally change, but I’m not a monster.” He felt tears falling down his face.
Slowly he made his way through the floo and appeared in the salon of the burrow. His aunt was patiently waiting for him, when he looked around he noticed that Molly Weasley stood a little behind her. The red-haired woman came up to him and Draco found himself enveloped in a hug.
“I know you can, I just want to spend some more time with you and Teddy. Hogwarts starts soon and I won’t see him. Please.” Understanding appeared on Draco’s face and he knew that the boy will agree.
“What are you thinking about?” Draco turned to look at him, and Harry couldn’t breathe, the blond still could make him breathless with only one gaze.
A mischievous glint appeared in Harry’s eyes and Draco immediately knew his answer. “Oh, I think that we ought to keep it a surprise.” After a moment of silence, Harry started to laugh. “Just imagine Teddy’s face when he discovers that we have been plotting without his knowledge” Draco joined Harry and the two of them laugh till Draco could feel that his cheeks started to hurt.
“Are you ready?” Harry asked happily and Draco couldn’t keep the smile from his face.
“You better believe it. Now come on let’s eat ice cream, and go back to our room.” The Gryffindor smiled and couldn't help kissing Harry again.
Draco knew that this explanation may not be enough for Harry’s friends and he needed to tell them why he treated them this way, why he was an asshole all his life. He needed them to know that he is trying and that he is worthy of a second chance.
Suddenly Harry remembered where they were, looking around the library he noticed that people were either staring at them or purposefully looking away. Harry noticed that his Slytherin was almost as red as Ron, but a bright smile was still present on his face.
The blond tilted his head and kissed Harry once again. “I’m so tired can we stay in.”
Kissing his way down the Slytherin throat he started to undo the bottoms of his shirt. Draco’s moaning made his cock twitch and Harry hoped that he will be ridding himself of his clothes soon. As the last bottom of Draco’s shirt was opened he felt the blond’s hand start to tug on his shirt, he quickly pulled it off exposing his chest to the Slytherin. Draco’s hands moved towards the zipper of his pants and Harry let him undo it.
Harry didn’t expect that the day would be so cold, but he should expect that on the day he planned to take Draco to Hogsmead something would be wrong. First, their depressing talk in the morning that was difficult but Harry meant every word he said to Draco. Then one of his fans decided to spill his food all over Draco so the Slytherin had to go back and change. And no the weather decided to be an asshole and suddenly drop when they were stuck in the middle of the road between Hogwarts and Hogsmead.
Black Lives Matter! Trans rights! Non-binary people are valid and asexual people exist!
“Hey! I can be a gentleman if needed.” They looked at each other and imminently started laughing. “Come on let’s go to sleep, tomorrow will be a long day.”
“Harry, ah…, I’m going...” He didn’t get to finish as he felt his orgasm. The Gryffindor swallowed him whole and Draco smiled his vision swimming.
I hope that y'all are great. Happy Pride! Black Lives Matter!
Damn this boy made him so weak.
“You need during Quidditch.” For a moment Draco looked offended then he smiled.
But he had to go back to Hogwarts, and the room of requirements happened and he once again did everything to ensure Potter’s survival, and the fucker saved him. Draco didn’t care at this point he didn’t care whether he will live or die the only thing that matter was the fact that Voldemort couldn’t win. So he threw his wand at Potter because he needed him to win.
When he looked at Draco he was smiling. “Then change it, Granger. Be better.”
Seeing as his mood deteriorated Draco moved towards Teddy and began to play with the kids, they always managed to lift his spirits. Today Teddy’s hair was half-ginger, half-blonde and they were as curly as Harry’s hair. Teddy's weird hair combinations always managed to make him smile. Draco's already felt better, but upon noticing that Teddy's hair started to straighten in some places, it elevated even more.
“She wants me to teach potions.” He watched as Harry’s entire face lit up.
The Golden Trio was supposed to return in about half-hour leaving Draco plenty of time to decorate the room with flowers and place Harry’s present next to the basket. In the beginning, he didn’t want to engage Ron and Hermione’s help especially on Valentines, he knew that the two of them most likely had plans, but when Hermione asked him if he was planning something she not only gave him the green light but also volunteered to keep Harry busy in the morning, after that the duo had a reservation in one of the muggle restaurants that they visited a few months back.
“I know that you will most likely not eat anything after this, but you really need to eat something and I’m not above using the fact that you like me, so for me?”
“Ron I don’t think that barging in their dorm now is a good idea.” Harry almost laughed at Hermione’s panicked voice, but quickly he remembered the blonde that was still in his arms.
The action I promised. (it's probably bad so...) idk !Smut!
“Oh, sorry. I didn’t mean it like that” Ron’s face was red.
Currently, they were sitting in their dorm, or more Harry was sitting and Draco was packing for the break. Harry knew that he should join him and pack his bag but he couldn’t take his eyes away from Draco. The boy looked better than at the beginning of the school year, the biggest difference was the lack of shadows under his eyes. Harry still worried that Draco will wake up in the middle of the night screaming even though the Slytherin slept through the whole night.
The boys are packing
Draco was still half asleep. Harry couldn’t tear his eyes away from him, “Morning.” Harry smiled at the blonde in his arms, he still couldn’t comprehend how did he get so lucky.
Please don't isolate yourself, I promise you that someone will always want to talk to you!!!
Draco watches as the raven-haired boy looked towards the ice cream stand, he couldn’t help but think about their first shopping trip together and the ice cream that Harry bought them.
Hello,
He aparated to Andromeda’s home and knocked on the door without hesitation. Andromeda opened the door, Teddy was placed on her hip. He was holding a plush dragon. Harry smiled at this picture.
“Do you think that I have a future in Quidditch?” Draco was taken aback by the question, it was unusual for Harper to doubt themselves, but he understood that Quidditch was essential for the two. He smiled and enveloped the child into a hug.
“Oh, call me Minerva. I am sure that Harry already informed you that Horace’s employment terminated this year.” Draco knew, exactly where this conversation was leading, and he was surprised that it took her so long to ask him. “And I know that your job currently consists of researching and developing medical potions which makes you a perfect candidate for a potion professor.”
Also, Black Lives Matter!
“I will be okay.” He wanted to laugh, of course, his father used a curse that was this dangerous. “I would like the tea before a healing charm, please”
Hermione has a request and Draco understands
Thanks for reading!
He knew that no matter what happens Harry will be with him. Harry and his newfound friends. A small smile appeared on his face when he could feel the now similar weight of Harry’s hand in his. When he looked back at McGonagall he could swear that the witch was smiling as well.
“Oh, Draco. Rosmerta is very understanding I’m sure she’s not holding a grudge. Besides you didn’t want to do it.”
“I bet he spread his legs for your protection.” Draco couldn’t see the person who said this and before he could scan the group another person decided to speak. “Harry Potter’s personal slut.” He could feel as his body started to shake. “Or perhaps he used some sort of love potion to make the saviour of our world fuck a dirty Death Eater.” Draco wanted to turn and run away, he knew that it would be cowardly but he really didn’t want to deal with all the group that was getting bigger and bigger.
The Slytherin looks as if he didn’t know where he was and then his eyes focused on Harry and the boy spoke with uneven voice. “I don’t know.”
“Now, I’m not a fashion guru, but I’m pretty sure that if you come to me for a change of clothes then you really need to invest in some more.” Ron was telling the truth, the majority of Harry’s clothes was still hand me downs and most of them were too big. “Since you going shopping anyway, you could ask Malfoy for some advice”
“I know that it was a long time ago, but you said that if I needed to I could stay with you. I obviously don’t want to stay forever just a couple of days. I just need to a couple of days. I don’t know where to go.” He knew that he sounded ridiculous, but at this point, he didn’t care. His mind wouldn’t shut up, all his thoughts were focusing on his wrongdoings, surely she wouldn’t welcome him. He shouldn’t have come here. “You know what, actually I don’t know what I was thinking, I will go” He started to back away, this was a bad idea, a very bad idea.
They stayed in this position for almost an hour when Draco finally regain some of his composure. Slowly he lifted his head and looked at his boyfriend. The Gryffindor had his eyes closed and he looks peaceful, without thinking about the gesture Draco lift his hand and brushed the loose curls from Harry’s forehead. When he looked back at Harry’s face their eyes locked, Draco could stop looking into the emerald eyes.
“We could what?” Harry smiled hearing the confusion in his voice.
Hello,
Once again Draco was brought back to reality by Potter’s voice. “Actually, I was wondering are you free tomorrow?”
For a moment Harry couldn’t comprehend what the blond was saying, but after a second he realised what is happening. Quickly he nodded. “Yes, Hermione is great at research. We will ask her tomorrow. But now are you going to sleep some more or do you wanna sneak to the kitchens to eat something? I know you didn’t eat during dinner.”
On instinct, Harry moves to sit in front of the boy. He doesn’t know what Malfoy needs right now. Should he touch him or will it make things worse?
Draco looked at Molly for a long time, then did the only thing he could, gave Molly his baby cousin and quickly made his way towards the kitchen.
“It’s only going to be a year then I will join you so don’t get in too much trouble without me!” Harry knew that from now on the peace that overtook Hogwarts was going to turn into pure chaos.
Hello,
“We would like to announce something.” Started Ron.
When the time finally came she realised that she was not ready. She knew that Draco read about occlumency, but she wasn’t prepared to hear about the problem he has. The first idea she had was a curse, but the more he told her the less it fitted. Trying to stretch her memory she couldn’t find anything that would fit what the boy was saying. After Draco finished his explanation she knew what she has to do.
And so Hogwarts became his only escape from his family up to the fifth year when Voldemort was back and while his father became even crueler, his mother even more distant. Both of them started to snap at him without reason, then his father started to talk about Draco taking the Dark Mark and of being Voldemort’s follower. He didn’t want to do this and managed to hold until 6
Harry just looked as Draco rub his left forearm nervously, the movement was hypnotising and Harry couldn’t take his eyes away. “Okay, so you see during the war there was a period in which Vol- Voldemort lived in the Manor. Also during this period my aunt Bellatrix was teaching me occlumency.” Harry noticed that once again when Draco said teaching it sounded like something bad as if he meant the farthest thing from teaching. Still looking at his hand he saw that the rubbing was slowly turning into scratching. “And something happened to my dreams and I don’t know how to fix it.”
It was another two weeks for Draco to feel comfortable enough to meet Harry’s friends. Although he still felt uncertain, he knew that sooner or later he had to meet them and apologize. Deep down Draco knew why he hated them so much when he was younger and he didn’t want to be this person anymore. So he agreed to come to the bar with Harry and he decided to apologize and explain.
Harry realised that he thought a lot about Draco, he couldn’t comprehend how his little crush on the boy turned into this, half of the time he couldn’t even properly describe what he is actually feeling. He knew that sooner rather than later he will have to tell Draco how he is feeling. He hoped that the Slytherin feels the same, but he knew then if Draco rejects him he would have to find a way to get over him because he really didn’t want to lose the friendship they created.
He considers to stay silent for their trip just to spite the blond, but after a quick mental debate, he decides that today’s going to be an official embarrass Draco Black day. He feels as a wicked smile appears on his face. “Well darling, now I’m ready. Let’s join our friends and introduced you to some muggle culture.” He knows that this is a dangerous game, but he is willing to play it, besides the flush that appears on Draco’s face as he heard the word darling being directed at him is almost worth the lecture that he for sure will get from, Hermione.
Harry looked at Draco, the blond was smiling. “Thank you. I think we would like two Butterbeers.”
“Before we start is your full name Draco Lucius Malfoy?”
He looked at Draco, who was sitting next to him with an expression of pure wonder. Harry was aware that Draco wasn’t expecting forgiveness, that’s why he was so nervous. The Slytherin kept opening and closing his mouth as is he was trying to say something but was afraid that his voice will destroy the moment.
Harry's jealous
Harry was also glad that whenever he was with Draco no one bothered them, so Draco always brought his sketchbook with him. He still wasn’t allowed to see any of his new sketches, which was a bummer because Harry noticed that Draco was glancing at him more frequently, so he was almost a hundred per cent sure that he was Draco’s new subject. He wanted to press the blond for some more answers, but he couldn’t find the right words. Every attempt at asking the Slytherin about his drawings sounded stupid in his head. Besides he knew that when Draco will be ready he will share his work with him.
Harry looks back at Andromeda, their eyes lock and he knows that both of them have no idea how to respond to something like this.
“You’ve got yourself a deal.” He could swear that for a moment Draco smiled at him, but then his expression melted back in the mask he wore in public.
“Yeah. I just…” the boy in front of him looked nervous and Draco wondered how could he face Voldemort and still have difficulties when talking to him. The silence stretched between them and Draco was afraid that Harry going to keep whatever is Happening inside when the boy all but shouts his question. “Do you have plans over the holidays?”
“I care because I think that you were alone for a very long time and I know that you may think that you don’t deserve it, but please realize that you are just as much a victim of circumstances and choices that were not yours as me.” He paused and made sure that Draco was actually listening to him.” I care because when I look at you I don’t see a Death Eater or a bully, maybe once upon a time I did, but now I got to know you and I realized my mistake and I will make sure that you are okay.  If I am more or less okay and my life was as much out of my control as yours then I want to make sure that you will be okay too.” Harry noticed that Draco was frozen, his face did not show any emotions and for a second he was afraid that Draco will run from him.
“Can you eat just a little?” He hoped that he wasn’t pushing him by asking.
Ace/aro people are part of the community and are amazing!
“Maybe, but just to be sure I’m going to check on him.” At first, he was gonna give the boy some time alone, but he knew that if Draco was to actually face the problem he has to talk about it, not bottle it up inside. “Don’t wait up!” He screamed at his friends and quickly made his way to the room.
“Always, Draco.”
Draco knew that sooner or later he would have to leave his aunt house and do some school shopping. Andromeda lent him some money, but he still couldn’t fight the dread that came over him every time he thought about stepping outside Andromeda’s house. He knew that she can’t go with him, someone had to stay with Teddy. Draco didn’t blame her, honestly the kid grown on him. He hoped that his presence in the house won’t influence the child negatively.
“Why wouldn’t they, I’m a Death Eater, my parents were in the inner circle, I was ordered to kill Dumbledore, my sentence was very small and they hate me.” Harry couldn’t help but flint because Draco called himself a Death Eater. He saw that Hermione and Ron were also looking at him with concern.
The man had brown skin and upon closer examination, Draco noticed that it was a little lighter than Harry’s. His eyes were blue and his hair was curly and black it reminded him a little of Harry, the only difference was the fact that the man’s hair looked neat and professional. Not even one piece of hair was out of place.
Draco couldn’t answer, Harry was holding his shoulders. “I don’t know.”
Draco felt his whole body clench and relax, after a moment Harry lied on top of him and Draco untangled his hand from his curls. Slowly he started to stroke Harry’s back.
His cheeks started to heat up again, but he managed to control his voice. “It’s actually not bad.” He noticed that Harry beamed on his words. “But, it still needs some work.” He smiled when a small grimace appeared on Harry’s face. He laughed.
“Can you hug me, Harry?” The blond sounded uncertain as if Harry could ever tell him no.
She didn’t know what to expect from the mind of a boy who was forced into a role all his life. She thought that she will feel anger, hatred maybe even regret, but she was not ready for the hollowness, the emptiness that came with not belonging. She looked at the boy next to her and for the first time in her life, she saw someone who is truly exhausted, someone who doesn’t know how to be himself. She knew that some of the pure-blood parents are strict, but she never suspected that one of them could break their child in so many ways. She hoped that the boy will heal, Draco was strong she knew that and with the help of friends, she hoped that the damage could be healed. With help, she hoped that his open wounds that still oozed blood would heal, she knew that some will leave scars, but at least the boy wouldn’t question all his choices.
He could feel himself drifting off in Harry’s arm, he was afraid of what he will see in his dreams, but he was so warm and comfortable and Harry was rubbing his back. He couldn’t really fight anymore falling asleep was very easy when one feels safe.
He looked as the rest of the students quickly left the Hall, Harry was still planted next to him and Draco was grateful for this comfort. When all the students, but Harry and he left McGonagall spoke again. “Mr Potter, I don’t intend to hurt Draco in any way. I just need to ask him some questions and talk with him. You may leave find your new dorm and then come back to guide Draco there, but this is something between me and Draco only Mr Potter.”
After a month of torture, he finally had enough of his delusions so he gave up and went to the only person that would take him, Andromeda. Then Harry showed up and help Andromeda heal him.
Unfortunately, the luck wasn’t in his favour. “Why not?” the man sounded curious.
(See the end of the chapter for
He was afraid of what the person is going to say about the fact that he no longer lives at the manor, what are they going to do when they find out that he is friends with Harry. Will they think that he somehow Imperio him or used some kind of potion? Will he be sent to Azkaban?
Her eyes landed on Harry, and she saw that his eyes didn’t leave the unconscious boy. He looked exhausted and Andromeda doubted that she looked better. After a few seconds, Harry rose his eyes and looked at her.
When they arrived at Hermione and Ron’s house to get their children, the place looked like a battlefield, and Pandora was the last one standing. The two small children were laying on the floor, Ron passed out on the sofa, Hermione was sitting with her head prompted on the couch with Hugo in her arms, while Pandora was still rummaging through the box that contained the failed experiments from the joke shop.
Hello,
“It’s okay. Besides, I don’t care anymore. It’s over.” This time Draco was a little louder and Harry’s heart broke all over again. “On that depressing note, let’s order some food before Harry and Weasley starve.”
Harry has a problem
Just as he was about to lay down the door opened, Harry stood in the doorway concern was painted on his face and it was almost too much for Draco. He stood there in the middle of the room looking at his boyfriend and he realised that for the first time he had someone he could confide in, someone who won’t judge if he tells him that today was too much.
“Aunt Andromeda” His voice sounded weird like it didn’t belong to him.
Hi, so I guess I'm writing the 3rd story, which is cool because I had this idea for a very long time, and since you helped me choose I decided that you can help me some more. I'm thinking of one day writing a story about Draco being a seer because I really like this trope, but I'm also not opposed to putting a seer Draco in this story, tell me what you think.
question that Harry answer he didn’t sound annoyed and Draco was glad.
“I’m sorry, that was very stupid and inconsiderate of me to say” Both of their gazes move to the Slytherin.
“Hello, Draco. How are you today?” Hermione asked him, he smiled at the witch.
Stay proud and remember I appreciate every single one of you!!
Quickly Draco turned and faced the Headmistress, she was smiling, and Draco couldn’t help but wonder if she liked the troublemakers. “Hello Headmistress, I ask myself questions like this all the time. What can I help you with?”
He brought his hand to his face and as he made contact with the cut he could feel it opening again. He looked up and for the first time this evening he saw himself in the mirror. His hair was everywhere, his whole left side was covered by it, but he could still make out the bloody stain.
“Well, it worked, besides even if you knew what you are missing you’d never get it back.” Harry was delighted to find that Draco was still smiling.
At first, Draco didn’t react and she saw as Harry’s hand hovered above his hand. He didn’t take it and she wondered if this was some kind of trigger. She looked back at Draco’s face and found that the faraway looked started to leave his eyes. Suddenly he stood up and Harry quickly moved so Draco could leave.
First appearance
“Who would have thought the boy who lived is not only a gentleman but also an interior designer. I’m pretty sure that it was some kind of charm maybe even one that is pretty similar to the one that I’ve used to make the badges in 4
Hermione could hear as Draco mumbled almost inaudibly “bathroom” and hurried away from the table. She saw that Harry wanted to follow, but instead, he sat down and looked straight at her.
Harry came back 5 minutes later carrying their ice cream. “So, I didn’t really know what would you like, but I know that you have a sweet tooth because Andromeda always has some sweets for you, so I bought you Kinder Bueno flavoured ice cream. I’m pretty sure you will like them.” Harry said and handed Draco the ice cream.
“We should hurry up.” Draco didn’t really mind the cold weather, but he didn’t want to caught in a snow storm. When Harry didn’t answer he begun to worry. For the last week, Harry was being weird, quieter, more lost in thoughts. Dracon didn’t know what was the reason for this change and he didn’t like it, he much preferred when Harry was loud and smiling. He stopped and noticed that the raven-haired boy didn’t even notice, he let him make a few steps and then called out to him. “Are you okay Harry?”
Harry was overjoyed, finally, after almost two weeks of constant nagging, Draco agreed to meet with Hermione and Ron. He knew that this was a big thing for Draco and although he wasn’t pushy per se he was talking more and more about the two.
“That actually would be lovely. Why don’t we go climbing and have a picnic?” Draco smiled at the idea and enthusiastically nods his head, he saw that Harry did the same and Ron kissed Hermione.
“Draco, I know it’s hard to believe, but what your parents told you is wrong. The Dursley always told me that this was wrong, but now I know that they were the one to be wrong. So Draco please don’t let your parents still control you.”
He smiled and looked into Harry’s eyes. “Together.”
I love and support you all. I want you to know that every single one of you is important. Keep fighting, what you all are doing by not surrounding is huge and very single one of you is making history and fighting for a better future.
Now to my motivational message for y'all.
He knew that sooner or later he would have to talk about it, especially that he started to fall asleep boring classes or their library visits. The exception to this was their last visit to the library, he not only finally shown Harry one of his sketches but they kissed in front of the full library.  Draco was falling more and more for the raven-haired boy and he knew that no matter what he did this feeling would never disappear.
He watched as Draco’s eyebrow rose and then furrowed, this made him smile once again.
“Harry, are you sure that everything is okay?”
He moved closer towards Andromeda and let her envelop him in a hug. He could feel her shaking subside. He watched as she wiped her face and continued the story, her hands still shaking from time to time.
“You are free to go back to Hogwarts. I’m sorry that the question made you upset. The ministry gave me a whole list of questions to ask you, but I think that this is quite enough.” Draco just stared as the man stopped talking for a moment. “ Do you have anyone that could come get you. I don’t feel comfortable leaving you alone or letting you go alone when people clearly intend to hurt you.”
Draco wanted to pray but decided that the boy will tell him what’s going on eventually. “Do you wanna go to the library. I can revise your potion essay.”
Behind him, he could hear Harry’s shouting. “Wait! Draco, I didn’t mean to laugh. Draco!”
At his question, Draco smiled wider and Harry could hear him chuckle silently, the blond looked away for a moment and then their eyes were locked. “I don’t know Harry it’s not like someone steals your clothes for over a month.”
Without answering he moved past Harry and entered the classroom.
“I agree, but they would have to create a whole new place for us.” Granger was right. Draco wondered if this was possible.
“Are we having a picnic?” At his words, Draco guided him to the blanket and opened the basket. ‘Yes, we are. I have your favourites and I also managed to persuade Andromeda to send me one of the better wines, I think you will enjoy it.” He watched as a brilliant smile appeared on Harry’s face making him look breathtaking.
Harry was silent for a moment then he kissed his forehead and started to stroke his cheek. Draco smiled at the gentle way that Harry touched him. “Is there anything I can do?” This made him smile even more.
“I — could you excuse me for a moment?” he didn’t wait for the response. He could barely control his limbs.
He didn’t expect them to thank him, he didn’t even want them to do it, all he asked for was to be treated a little better. Like a human, not a punching bag. Obviously, this would never happen and he had enough.
Pandora started to pace the room. “Like connecting Disillusionment Charm, Silencio and Notice-Me-Not to achieve untimed cloaking.” She paused for a moment then smiled with one of the mischievous smiles. “That’s actually clever. Thanks, dad.” With that, she ran out of the room.
The images of Draco tossing and turning in his bed flooded Harry’s head and the urge to shake the Slytherin came back. He watches as Draco nodded and knocked two times on the Door. For a moment nothing happened, then they heard movement and McGonagall appeared in front of them.
Just them Harry and Hermione appeared in the corridor and Draco quickly exited the room and placed himself between the corridor and the door.
“We have a room Weasley, this one.” The two of them didn’t even look ashamed when they started to laugh at the blond bed head.
“Draco people stopped harassing you because you help most of them with potions. The fact that you didn’t notice that is just funny.” Oh, this was something that he didn’t expect, but he couldn’t complain.
Noticing his hesitation Draco flipped them over, placing himself on top of Harry. His hand lingering near Harry’s cock and his mouth closing on Harry’s earlobe. After a few seconds of sucking the Slytherin moved away and looked Harry in the eyes.
After wiping the tears that gathered at the corner of his eyes, he looked at the confused Gryffindor. “Look at the side.” He watched as Harry turned the toy around and found the logo. After a moment Harry looked up and started to laugh, which made Draco burst out laughing once again.
This story is different because I wanted it to be an age gap story meaning that Draco is born during the second war and becomes a potion professor at Hogwarts, where he meets Harry a DADA professor. Harry is still the boy who lived twice, but he is 37 years old while Draco is 23. I know that the age difference is big but in no way I want the relationship to be predatory or based simply on sex, both of them are adults. In the beginning, Draco has no idea who Harry is due to being raised in France and while the aftermath of the war will be present in the story it won't be the main focus. I want this to be kinda enemies-to-friends-to-lovers but with a clean start.
keep fighting and don't give up.
“Oh, Harry we don’t want to miss it!” Harry let Draco drag him away back to the ongoing party. The blond was smiling, and Harry couldn’t stop his own smile from appearing.
He averted his eyes and focus on Teddy, he was sure that Andromeda will want to talk to him about this, but he couldn’t do it today. She must have sensed this because a few minutes later she started to talk about dinner. This was one of the reasons why he already loved her more than his own mother even after so little time with her.
“Harry is like 8 can you come back after 10?” Harry smiled, he knew that Ron liked to sleep in on weekends, but this was a very important problem and he needed his help.
The Hogwarts express sounded it’s whistle and Teddy hurriedly shouted Goodbye and ran to the train. Harry watched as Teddy disappeared in the Hogwart's express, he would be seeing him again during the feast, but it still made him sad that he won’t be able to pop to Andy’s place to see his godson.
“I’ve never watched a movie before. As you may remember my family hates muggles and everything that is connected with them.” He can say that his tone is a little bitter, his father would smack him for it.
Now, are you beautiful readers lets make one thing clear Black Lives Matter always mattered and will always matter.
“Hello Andromeda, Teddy. How are you.” Hermione greeted his aunt and at the same time, Ron said hello and focus on the baby in his arms.
Draco could feel as the blood drained from his face, he knew that if Harry wasn’t holding him in place he would flee and probably never come back. All the images of Lucius and Narcissa screaming at him, telling him that he was unnatural and that he was allowed to stay with them only because he was their only heir assaulted him. He could feel as his breathing picked up and he shot up. This was bad, he didn’t want to relive these moments.
He still didn’t know what to do. Deciding never was his strong side, maybe this was his downfall. But he really wanted to stay with Harry. The expression on Harry’s face did little to help him decide. The boy was looking at him as if he was the only person in the whole world. He felt as if he was drowning in the emeralds that were Harry’s eyes. He wanted to stay.
“Very well Mr Black, I will see you later.” She smiled at him with one of her all-knowing smiles and left for her office, while Draco quickly made his way towards the door

Black Lives Matter always mattered and will always matter.
He heard Ron snort and expected a snarky comment to come from him, but it was Draco who beat him to it. “Honestly Harry, you’re always hungry. Do you not feed yourself?”
Draco watched as Harry furrowed his eyebrows before commenting on his friend weird antics. “Well, that was suspicious.” At this comment he couldn’t hold his laughter anymore, Weasley truly was a bad layer.
“I, well, you see” he didn’t know what to say. ”We were eating dinner and She, Mother made a comment and then Father started to talk about Hogwarts and I.” He paused, could he really tell her what happened? After a moment he realised that if he won’t do it now, he won’t get another chance. His father will find a way to keep him quiet. It was now or never. ”I said that I still need to do some reading from 6th year.” He could feel tears running down his cheeks, but he continued, his voice a little broken. “And he started to say how it was my fault, I should have shut up and stayed silent, but I told him that it was his fault because he basically gave me to a psychomaniac. He didn’t like it.” He was full of crying if only Lucius saw him now.
“What do you mean?”
To say that Harry was nervous was an understatement. Logically he knew that Draco and he are friends now and there’s nothing to be nervous about, but his brain wasn’t listening to the logic, so here he was sitting on his bed in only his trousers thinking about what should he wear. He felt like every teenager in films before they had a big date, only he was meeting a friend.
“Harry, we need to hurry. You still have to attend the welcoming feast.” Draco’s voice broke him out of his thoughts.
He could feel the blood on his face. It was dripping for his face making a small puddle on the floor. He had enough. He tried to save them, all he ever did was in order to save them. He was torture, he was beaten, and he was almost killed, and he endured it all because he wanted to save them. He wanted his parents to live, and he did everything in his power to save them.
I sorry this took me so long but I had to do something at work and I didn't have time to do anything else.
“Oh, honey. You’re nothing like your father, you must know that. Your father was an asshole.” Draco looked at Andromeda, then at Teddy and then back at Andromeda. His aunt had a grimace on her face. “Sorry, Teddy but this man deserves to be called that.”
The Gryffindor smiled a little and lead him towards the bed. After noticing that Draco still wore his robs, Harry helped him remove them and Draco watched as the raven-haired boy neatly folded them and placed them one of the chairs. He almost laughed at the gesture, Harry knew him so well. After removing his robes, the Gryffindor returned to him and lowered the two of them onto the bed. Immediately Draco curled u closer to Harry, the raven-haired boy started to gently stroke his hair.
“Fine” she took out her wand “I’m so out of practice. Hold him down, he will be moving and I cannot lose my concentration” She watched as Harry positioned himself above Draco firmly holding him in place.
The spell that Harry’s words had on the group broke and Draco felt as stinging hex hit him in the back, he stumbled and almost fell on Harry, seeing this Neville caught him and held him upright as Harry turned around and once again faced the group.
He didn’t even notice when the cane appeared right next to his cheek. He knew he shouldn’t look.
Holiday talk
It's Valentine Day, also I tried to write some action in the next chapter, so this is your warning. If you wanna read it you can mentally prepare yourself.
After a moment Draco opened his eyes, he seemed disoriented. “Thank god. I don’t know what was that but I’m almost a hundred per cent sure that this was not a regular nightmare. Are you okay?
That night in their room Draco showed Harry his small sketchbook. Harry was surprised, but Draco quickly explained that his parents never knew that he had it. The drawings were good, but the blond insisted that they could be better if he had some time for practice, but for the past 3 years he couldn’t draw and now the only thing that he can think about drawing is the war.
Maybe she should just call Harry and tell him to come by tomorrow. She was brought back from her thoughts when someone knocked on the door. She knew that it might not be the greatest idea but if Draco opened the door then maybe the blow won’t be so hard for Harry. But the boy didn’t act like himself, he kept his head down, and she had to coax him to speak. This definitely wasn’t normal.
After a long round of congratulation, the usual conversation started. Draco smiled as Harry wiped his eyes, and started to talk with Ron and Hermione once again, this time about more trivial things. He loved watching the trio interact, but sometimes it made him long for his friends that never returned. They still exchanged letter, but he missed hearing Pansy’s voice when she complained, or Blaise’s horrible advises that usually made things worse, he longed to know how they changed. Draco hoped that the three of them would be able to meet once again.
He felt Andromeda’s arms on him. She was saying something, but he couldn’t make out any words. His legs gave up under him. Someone picked him up. He couldn’t say whether it was his aunt or Potter. Someone moved him on the bed and then the darkness took him.
. “I can’t believe she found this book.” Immediately the blond started to look through the book.
“I’m sorry that she said that, but I’m very glad that you didn’t listen to her.” For a moment they only stared at each other, then Harry broke the silence. “Do you maybe want to go for a pit with Ron, Hermione and I later this week?”
“Goodnight, Draco.”
“Well, I think it’s high time we go back to Andromeda’s. I’m sure she cooked us dinner. Are you staying or do you have plans?” He knew that his voice wasn’t back to normal, but at this point, he didn’t care.
Looking up he saw, Harry's grinning face and Draco imagined punching the grin out of the Gryffindor's face. “I’m gonna get you, Potter.” This made Harry's smile widen, and Draco hated him.
“I’m almost done with the summer reading, I still have to catch up on the work that I couldn’t do in 6th year, Father” He could see the frown forming on Lucius' face.
“When I was little I always had the same dream, there was a forest and I was standing in the middle of a crossroad and no matter which road I choose I’ve always come back to the crossroad. During the war, it changed I don’t know why, I thought that it was because of the occlumency that Bellatrix made me learn, but I couldn’t find anything in the books. Now every night I dream that something is there with me and it’s chasing me, and I can’t run away from it. He only thing I can feel is this overwhelming fear that says that I cannot let it touch me.” Harry once again looked at the place where the Dark Mark was the scratching was faster and Harry instinctively moved and took Draco’s right hand in his so that he couldn’t break the skin again.
He followed Sam to the edge of the forest where a small pond was. Draco loved that pond when Harry shoved it to him he replaced the one from the manor with this one in his mind on the same night. San tugged at his hand, and Draco looked in the direction that the child was pointing. An enormous brownish toad sat near the bank of the pond. He smiled as the child started to talk about the difference between toads and frogs.
The round of applause started, but Draco didn't take his eyes away from Harry. A brilliant smile appeared on his face as he moved to his friends and enveloped them both in a tight hug.
“Git.”
In the beginning, the rest of the 8
This question made him stop in his tracks. He stared at Harry as if he couldn’t understand what the other boy was saying. He couldn’t form words. Neither of them dared to break the silence that fell upon them, but Draco knew that he needed to be the one to say something.
Draco was sure that if he passes all his N.E.W.T.s with outstanding results he will be able to find a job, the problem was that this conviction didn’t help him learn. He was studying for 6 hours straight and his sleep schedule still was in tatters. Harry helped a lot, the boy was very supportive, recently he was on a mission to get Draco to sleep through the whole night, which included almost caring Draco from the library to their room. The memory brought a rare smile to his face, he was sure that Harry caught it because the raven-haired boy started to smile as well. Draco still wasn’t sure how he got so lucky but decided not to dwell on it too much.
“How am I strong? I ran away from my parents, I couldn’t make them see that this wasn’t right. I messed up.” Harry knew that the Slytherin was working himself into another panic attack and he had to stop him before Draco exhausted himself.
