“We are taking what I’ve heard Muggles call a ‘mental health day.’” Draco says, adding air quotes without letting go of Harry’s hand.
The line goes dead. Draco sits in the hallway for what feels like forever. He clutches his phone tightly in his hand and closes his eyes.
Harry’s heart skips in his chest but he pulls Draco in for a tight hug, “Everything is gonna be okay.”
Malfoy rolls his eyes again, Harry wonders if they ever get tired.
Harry smiles somewhat at the question before looking Malfoy right in the eye and saying.
"Like adults? Just a few months ago you were saying he was just a kid! You fucking defended him in court because you insisted that all his bad decisions were the poor choices of a neglected child. But now, when worst comes to worst, he’s an adult?"
“How are you, sweetheart?” She asks, smoothing the hair out of Harry’s face.
Malfoy scoffs. Harry looks up to see Malfoy already staring at him in something that looks like confusion.
“I don’t look that bad Draco.”
“Not yet, Potter. You can see it when it’s done and you’ve figured out what you want.”
“What?” Neville says again, “You and Malfoy are dating?”
There’s silence for a few moments, but Draco is rubbing small circles onto Harry’s back, so he thinks they’re probably okay.
After saying this, Harry tucks his head back into the crook of Draco’s neck and closes his eyes.
“Harry that’s wonderful, I’ll be able to help you get caught up!”
“Hey,” Harry says, stepping to stand in between Draco’s legs, suddenly feeling very sober, “It’s okay, it’s all gonna be okay.”
“I promise you Draco, she probably wouldn’t have said anything if she knew it would upset you.
“Alright where to next Malfoy? I think I need more convincing as to why it was a bad idea for me to come back.”
Malfoy and Harry stare back quietly and in shock before Harry answers.
Harry pauses to look at Malfoy, and intentionally shovels more food into his mouth before leaning in closer and saying, “Why, does it bother you?”
She goes to stand up from where she’d been sitting on the bed, absentmindedly clutching a stuffed rabbit. He wonders if one of her brothers gave it to her. If Fred gave it to her. Harry holds his hands out begging her to listen for another second.
“Well,” Starts Malfoy, rolling a toy car in Teddy’s direction, “My clothing is much nicer than yours, so anything you think is high quality is probably mine.”
There's silence across the kitchen so Harry starts doing food train motions to get Teddy to eat. This goes marginally better than it had for Kreacher, and Harry’s so caught up in it that he doesn’t notice Malfoy settle down at his side.
Harry rereads those two words over and over again until they seem to lose their meaning. He wonders if she means be careful because of Draco, or be careful with Draco.
Harry looks at Draco sharply, “What does that mean?”
Draco sighs and pinches the bridge of his nose, “I just want a break. And want to go somewhere that isn’t Hogwarts or Starbucks, I’m getting quite tired of pumpkin themed beverages.”
“Okay.” Harry says into Draco’s neck.
“The Shrieking Shack, I wanted to remind you of that time you almost got expelled.”
Hermione Granger>10:45

Harry can picture the glare Malfoy throws back at Ron in response.
“Alright,” Ron says moving in to hug him goodbye, “We’ll see you then. And don’t stress too much about this Harry. My family adores you, their love is not something you need to worry about.”
Harry is cut off mid sentence by Hermione blurting out, “You’re in love with him.”
“He’s in the playpen with some books and blocks, he’s alright.” Draco says, sitting down beside Harry and digging his knees slightly into Harry’s thigh.
“But Potter, you already have your Auror accreditation. What more could we teach you?”
“As I’m sure you all know, it’s New Years Eve and we’re about 20 seconds out from midnight. So we’re gonna do a countdown and ring in the new year before the music starts up again and the party continues!”
“Don’t call me that.” Harry says, the words falling from his mouth before he could stop them.
Harry opens his eyes and listens for whatever is going to come out of her mouth next but nothing does for a moment.
Malfoy laughs and looks at Harry without turning his head, “Not everyone has to like you Potter, I think the fame and glory might be giving you a big head.”
Harry looks up at Draco, who is now standing over Teddy and him. Draco has bags under his eyes but doesn't appear to be any more anxious than he normally appears.
Hey guys! So today is the day. The final big chapter for this story. Writing this fic has been an amazing experience and I was completely overwhelmed by y'alls support. This chapter is, personally, my favouite and I know that Brek is really proud of it too. Hope you enjoy, and are staying safe out there<3
Draco smiles at that because Blaise is completely correct, and he’s missed hearing a kind, familiar voice.
The walk home isn’t as miserable as it would have been if they hadn’t had magic to protect them, but as they did, it’s a fine walk. Harry is pretty sure that Draco is pretending to be colder than he is just so Harry will keep his arm around him, but Harry isn’t going to complain.
“Depends on where you were thinking of going.”
The next morning, Harry wakes up to the sound of a phone ringing incessantly. He cracks one eye open and immediately regrets it with how bright the room is.
It’s at this precise moment when Harry is staring into Malfoy’s face that he remembers the 12 players on the field who are undoubtedly watching this exchange.
Harry feels his heart wrap even more tightly around Draco’s finger.
He can make mistakes, and run to the grocery store in his pajamas at 3am for a bag of crisps and milk with no one questioning his sanity. He’s able to get a laptop and a cell phone and actually use them because the only magic he’s surrounded by is his own.
Harry shrugs, “I’ll figure it out when we get there.”
Hermione sighs and looks up at the ceiling as though looking for some divine entity to grace her with the patience needed to have a conversation with Harry.
Wiping his hands on his legs, he stands up and follows Luna to a little room. At least at first it appears to be a little room, but then it’s like his mind refocuses and suddenly he’s sitting in what appears to be a replica of Professor Lupin’s old office. The memory calms him slightly.
Malfoy’s silent for a second before saying
He’s lying in bed thinking about maybe joining Draco in the shower, when the other boy exits the bathroom in a plume of steam.
Harry laughs. “He’s just playing nice because he thinks you’re gonna play with him.”
*  *  *
Draco cracks his eye open at that, “I wouldn’t call what happens in this bed a waste.”
Neville makes to say something again but Harry cuts in first, “I’m not asking you to like him, he’s a hard person to like, but I am asking that you accept that I’m with him.”
“Liar.” Harry says, pulling on a pair of jeans as he does so, “Why are you lying?”
“What was what about, Potter?” Malfoy says twisting his arm out of Harry’s grip.
He doesn’t wait for Harry to reply but begins walking down the street towards the various Hogsmead shops. Harry scrambles to follow before saying,
He tries to slow his breathing, focusing on the in and out. He subconsciously presses his hand to the scar, rubbing it slightly in hopes of easing the fiery pain that he’s sure is imagined.
“Good heavens Tilly, again?” Narcissa is already exclaiming as she enters the room. “Go to the kitchens and fetch another and don’t-”
It comes out accusingly but he doesn’t mean it to. Hermione stops what she’s doing and turns to look at him.
“That’s stupid, even for you Draco.”
“No don’t bother, finish your lunch.” He attempts to tack on a smile so as not to worry Malfoy.
Their shoulders jostle together as they walk and when they reached the courtyard, Harry grabs Malfoy’s arm, making him pause. Malfoy jerks to a stop, and turns so that he’s directly in front of Harry and blocking his view of where so many people died. Harry’s breath is speeding up, and Malfoy starts talking.
A powerful feeling is welling up in Harry’s chest, and it terrifies him. He flops on his back but turns his head to look at Malfoy some more.
Harry has never felt so awkward in a room with his best friends.
“Like what, Draco?”
Absently, Malfoy places his hand on Harry’s thigh underneath the table.
Harry feels panic well up inside of him when he realizes he doesn’t know the answer.
“Life’s not fair.” Malfoy replies, though he pauses to help Harry undo the rest of the buttons on his shirt.
“Mrs. Weasley, I know she doesn’t want to see me, but I really need to talk to her. It’s important, otherwise I wouldn’t ask.”
Draco seems to anticipate his question with the answer falling from his lips quickly, “You Know Who and Bellatrix.”
Harry throws a teasing “Fuck off Malfoy,” before taking Malfoy’s hand up and pulling him out the door.
“Hello?” he says closing his eyes tiredly while waiting for a response.
“To my table Potter, you didn’t think that we’d be able to eat breakfast together did you?”
But Malfoy rolls his eyes and sneers, “It’s clearly decorated by someone who spent most of their formative years inside a cupboard, so it’s not shocking that it’s awful, just sad that Weasel and Granger haven’t fixed it yet.”
“I can handle this Kreacher, thank you so much. You can go back to the castle if you want.”
Next, Draco sends Harry off to visit Hagrid while he “Runs and grabs something.” Which turns out to be wonderful. Harry hadn’t realized how much he misses Hagrid until he’s directly in front of the man. A bone crushing hug and a few inedible rock cakes later, Draco knocks on the door to whisk Harry away and back up to the castle. Hagrid gives Harry what Harry is sure is supposed to be a subtle, but significant look, but in reality is much more confused and obvious. Draco pretends not to notice and Harry waves goodbye to Hagrid over his shoulder while twisting his hand together with Malfoy’s.
“What’re the plans you have for today?” Draco asks, leaning against the counter after grabbing a soda from the fridge and popping it open.
The two boys wake up some time later, and blearily pull on sweats. Draco’s hair is an absolute disaster, but for the first time ever he doesn’t seem to care. Harry runs his hand appreciatively through the mess and Draco’s eyes close, clearly enjoying the feeling.
“What are you five!? Not getting enough attention so bothering the first person you can find?”
She only goes a short distance, perhaps sensing Harry’s inability to walk in a straight line. She turns to face him and looks at him for a moment without saying anything.
“Oh, never mind.” Malfoy snaps and starts getting up from his seat.
From behind her back, Mrs. Weasley produces two familiarly lumpy packages and hands one to both Draco and Harry.
Harry takes it wordlessly and reads it. Phrases like,
Harry makes to stand up at the last bit of that sentence but Hermione makes a frantic soothing gesture with her hands, “Calm down Harry, he’s only joking.”
“Do I look okay?” He hears himself ask. Knowing that Harry will say yes regardless of what he is wearing. He could be wearing a garbage bag and have a paper bag on his head and Harry would still tell him he looked good.
The phone rings for what seems like ages before a light calm voice says, “Harry?”
She just shakes her head and crosses the room, pulling him up and into a hug, and it finally, finally, feels like they are meeting on some sort of even ground. “Don’t apologize. Just make sure you’re sure about him, and be ready to defend it.”
“Come on Potter. We are not wasting the day in bed. We have homework to finish and Quidditch practices to plan for tonight.”
Draco gives a small closed lip smile and Molly Weasley looks at him for all of a second before pulling him into a hug as well.
For Draco every single interaction is hard. He doesn’t want to get his heart broken, and as a result he won’t let himself indulge in the little things. Kissing Harry had taken all the bravery he had in his stores and now he is left entirely depleted and defenseless.
Ron nods and claps Harry on the shoulder before turning back to the front with a disinterested look at the guest speaker.
“Where are you going Malfoy?”
Malfoy startles slightly and thrashes in his robes. Harry patiently waits for him to calm down.
Malfoy watches in inpatient silence until declaring with a smirk, “We wouldn’t be taking this long if you had just slept with your socks on last night.”
At a glacial pace Harry lowers his wand, and steps forward towards Draco. Draco stands up, looking unsure. Harry takes another step and then rests his head on Draco’s shoulder, face turned in towards his neck. After a few seconds, Draco’s arms come up around him. Feather-light, and easy to knock off if he felt like it. Instead, Harry just presses in closer and wraps his own arms around Draco’s torso.
Harry stands beside Draco against the counter so that their shoulders are touching and says, “I was thinking we could go out to a park or something for him to play, and maybe dinner too.”
Blaise is silent for the longest time yet, and Draco pulls his phone away from his head just to check that Blaise is still on the line.
“Shove off, Potter.” Draco responds, “It wouldn’t look nearly as awful if you hadn’t started kissing me.”
“Well that was dramat-”
Harry rolls his eyes and somewhat aggressively drapes his arm over Malfoy’s shoulders.
“Why didn’t you wake me?” He says, turning so that his face is buried in Harry’s chest.
“Now, I’ll get to work on getting your classes in order, for the time being just attend class with Mr. Malfoy. Additionally, now that there are two of you, you’re more than welcome to stay in the castle if you so choose. There are rooms available in the staff quarters that can be arranged to sleep you two. If not, Potter you’ll have to floo in from Malfoy’s house each morning as I’m at my limit for floo connections into the castle this year.”
With that, Harry leaves the room and as he enters the kitchen he swears he hears Malfoy grumble, “I never should have adjusted the wards, you’re getting far too comfortable in my apartment.”
She turns in his direction and smiles, waiting for him to catch up. When he gets there he hands her the smooth leather clutch she’d been holding.
Draco snorts, “That is a lie, and you know it. But I appreciate it anyways.”
He barely stops himself from shrinking into Draco’s side as she stares at him. He knows she’s posturing, and won’t do anything to him, but in the moment he can’t help but remember that she was in the clearing when Voldemort cast the curse.
After the storage cupboard, Harry and Malfoy had tumbled out and into the abandoned hallway. Malfoy’s hair looked a mess, and he wouldn’t stop smiling at Harry whenever he thought Harry wasn’t looking.
“It’s just me, Potter. You had a nightmare. The war is done. You’re safe.”
Malfoy looks vaguely terrified at the notion of a baby being in his presence, but soon enough he has another thing to distract him.
“Alright mate, talk to you soon. And Harry,” Ron adds just before they hang up, “I’m really glad you told me about Malfoy. And I’m honestly happy for you.”
“Are you sure this is what you want boys?”
He closes his eyes and slides his hands into his hair, pulling at the roots.
“Get out! Let me do this, or we’ll never leave the house.”
Harry just looks at her, still very much lost. She sighs and rolls her eyes.
It’s a pointless endeavor, because as soon as Harry exits the bathroom he makes a beeline for Draco and stands between his legs, smoothing his fingers through his hair. It’s soothing.
“What?” Harry asks, his mouth full with a strawberry pop tart he had meant to eat that morning.
Draco shrugs one shoulder again and chews slowly, “I was thinking of going and seeing my mother this afternoon after we drop Teddy off.”
Harry dreams that he’s drowning.
Harry sits up on the edge of the bed, and when Draco steps towards him, draws him close by pulling him in by his waist.
“I’ll just-” Malfoy starts and then stops, cheeks and ears pink. In lieu of finishing his sentence he gestures vaguely with his hand, almost tripping on his robe in his haste to get away from the table.
“Hello?”
Malfoy settles down at Harry’s side and spoons some eggs onto his plate and adding a  disgustingly large pile of ketchup before answering, “We have potions this morning, care of magical creatures, lunch and then transfiguration.”
“Of course.” Harry says immediately. “We’ll be the presidents of the Ginny Weasley Fan Club, I’ll make posters and everything!”
“You look nice.” Harry comments, “I was gonna wear sweats but if you look like that I suppose I should put in some effort.
“Okay.” Harry says, smiling and leaning in towards Draco, “Call it then.”
“Have you lost your mind Harry?”
Teddy is handed to Harry with little fanfare and before the group knows it, they’re standing on Andromeda’s front porch with a diaper bag and an infant. Harry never thought that he would live to see Malfoy holding baby formula in his hands.
The hype surrounding the first article the prophet had done had died down almost completely, but somehow more photos of the two boys had gotten out to the public, so of course, another awful article had been written about the two of them.
“I’ve had other things on my mind Hermione, Auror business and all that.”
“But maybe,” a quiet voice in his head says, as Harry’s face flushes slightly, “Maybe his heart is pounding too.”
Harry squeezes Draco’s hand and smiles tightly, his gaze already flicking back to the house. They stand there for another moment and Draco takes the time to really look at Harry.
There’s no one in the corridor with everyone at supper, but Malfoy still pitches his voice low when he says to Harry, “Teasing isn’t nice, Potter.”
Malfoy looks physically pained. “I wouldn’t have said it if I didn’t.”
“Hello boys, how was dinner?”
“How bad is it?” he asks into Hermione’s hair.
“We were not ridiculous!” Harry protests, “If anything we were completely rational and normal about it all.”
“Ever since that dreadful article was written about you boys there have been reporters just outside the gates begging for a comment.” She flips her long hair over her shoulder. “Obviously, I haven’t given them anything, I just hope you boys aren’t being harassed as much.”
Harry just nods, sure that she can feel it. He holds her tight, thankful that he has her back in his corner. The hug breaks and Harry leaves the room, closing the door behind him. And although Ginny had said she didn’t need an explanation now, when he hears something being thrown across the room, he’s sure she’ll need one later.
“Draco, come on.” Harry says taking a few steps and twisting Draco’s hands with his own. “They love me. And I love you. They might not like you but they’ll tolerate you for my sake.”
To his surprise, it’s Draco who answers. “No Potter. It’s a bunch of bullshit that is an attack on me for corrupting you.”
After the phone is hung up, Malfoy crosses the kitchen and stops directly in front of Harry.
“Oh poor you Draco, your life is so hard.” Harry says, finally turning his head to look at Draco while they talk.
“You never told me that Malfoy went back to Hogwarts.”
When they pull apart, Draco’s face is wet and Harry wipes the tears, “Let’s get out of here.”
“Did that baby’s hair just change colour, or am I having a stroke?”
“It’s too late in the year though-”
Harry says it jokingly, but feels Draco tense beneath him, the smile slipping from his mouth.
Harry shrugs, and leans in towards Draco stopping a breath away from his lips to say, “I cannot emphasize enough how much I do not care anymore.”
Malfoy pulls him in for a kiss. It’s short and sweet and Malfoy’s mouth tastes like white chocolate. Harry thinks he could get used to this.
It’s all skin to skin, hot and tempting. And Harry thinks that he’s never felt like this before and wonders if he’ll ever feel like it again.
Every face in the room is shocked and their mouths are hanging open except for Hermione who’s smiling brilliantly and Ron who's looking at Hermione with a knowing look in his eye. When no one says anything, Draco nods once and turns on his heel, practically running to the door where Harry is standing and smiling at him.
“I’m sorry I couldn’t be there Hermione. I didn’t think the Weasley’s would appreciate having Draco at Christmas just yet, and I wasn’t going to leave him on his own on Christmas day.”
“I suppose.” Malfoy sighs, before adding more food to his plate.
Huffing, Malfoy glares at him for a moment. Maybe trying to get Harry to drop it. When he sees that Harry won’t, he throws his hands up in exasperation.
(See the end of the chapter for
“So tell me again why Harry can’t come to class.” A hissing whisper asks. Harry recognizes the voice as Hermione’s instantly having been whispered at furiously by her on many occasions.
Harry thinks about this while he is lying in bed one morning. Malfoy is still asleep, his soft snores fill the other side of the room (the house elves keep moving their beds closer together) the sunlight streaming through the open curtains, and glinting off his hair.
“Admitted to St. Mungos.” Ron signs “Mom says that she thought Ginny had been losing weight and not sleeping, but then she found her unconscious on the staircase this morning.”
“Hello all.” She starts. Harry casts his eyes around for her, before shrugging and leaning back against Draco’s chest.
His words are precise, clipped and uncaring. Harry’s heart squeezes at the sound of that voice even though it’s not directed at him.
Draco recognizes the move as one of Harry’s common ways for grounding Draco for when he thinks Draco is going into a panic attack. It’s then that he notices how fast he’s breathing and how tight his chest is feeling.
Draco sighs, “Not that you knew of, and we might as well walk and get it over with.”
“Okay.” He murmurs into Harry’s hair. “If you don’t mind being seen with me, I definitely don’t mind being seen with you.”
“You literally told me you’ve never met a baby before.”
Draco breathes in Harry’s scent and says quietly, “Why does this have to be so hard?”
Silence again before finally Draco says, “Alright thanks Pansy. I appreciate it.”
They’d had a row about the bloody curtains in the third week, which resulted in Malfoy doing a tricky little charm that kept the curtains open indefinitely. Harry hasn’t really tried to reverse it, and has even gotten used to it.
Harry is grateful, even though he could have done without the disapproval, the shop owner still sells his goods to them and says nothing about Draco or his dark mark, visible where his sleeves have ridden up when they pay for their candy.
“Come drink with me.” Harry says, turning his head so his nose brushes Draco’s cheek.
Harry smiles slightly, “I don’t recall that happening.”
Harry laughs and kisses Malfoy briefly on the mouth.
Staying over had probably been a mistake, Draco realizes. Nodding his head absently to whatever Harry is saying. He knows he made a fool of himself when he accidentally called Harry, “Harry” out loud. There was too much want inside him at that point, and even someone as stupid as Harry had to realize it. He had shown his hand too soon, he should have waited until Harry had made a more obvious play.
Malfoy looks at him in confusion and mild panic as the noise behind Harry’s back grows.
“I just thought it was right that you knew,” Harry says firmly, “But, I can disappear from your life if you want me too. I’d get it.”
“Harry, how are you?”
“Come on Malfoy, you’ve got to eat at least a little.”
“Are you ready to meet Teddy tomorrow?” Harry asks.
Ron rolls his eyes and glances at Harry before replying with an exasperated, “Yes Hermione.”
Harry looks at the elf fondly, and does his best to tramp down any feelings of nervousness that are circling in his stomach at the thought of Draco opening his present. He had a hard time figuring out what to get him. This was their first time exchanging gifts, and judging from what Draco bought his friends, he’s a much better gift giver than Harry.
Harry searches his mind for something that Hermione needs to know and comes up blank, Malfoy is his roommate, his friend, his partner in quidditch training, but none of this is news her.
That’s how a few hours later they end up at some restaurant called The Wolseley, and Harry looks around wondering how Draco managed to convince him that this wasn’t fancy. It’s incredibly expensive and Harry wonders why they couldn’t have gone to a place with chicken strips for him and macaroni for Teddy.
As he exits the room a ridiculously adorable sight meets his eyes. Malfoy is asleep on the couch with Teddy curled up against his chest. Teddy looks around at the sound of Harry entering the room and makes a screeching noise, his hair turning blue, he startles Malfoy awake. Malfoy tenses for a moment but relaxes when he realizes where he is and what’s on his chest.
Before he can reach it Draco takes it off the table and clasps his hands together in his lap.
“Oblivious about wh-”
“This is messing with my brain.” He says offhandedly.
“Rita Skeeter got pictures of me out with someone, and she’s going to publish them, and I thought it would be best for you to hear it from me first.”
“Glad to be home?” Harry asks, leaning his head against Draco’s shoulder.
Malfoy’s head turns imperceptibly towards Harry’s hand, craving the touch Harry is giving. He grumbles and nuzzles against Harry’s chest, eyes still closed.
“Care to join me, Potter?” He says voice only sounding slightly muffled.
“Is that why there’s enough food for ten people?” Malfoy questions “The Weasley’s are all coming here to to mock me.”
Harry nods, but is a little angry. How is it fair that all Harry wants in the world is to do the work himself and go back to Hogwarts, and all he gets is the exact opposite. For a second he’s jealous of Malfoy, but only for a second. When he looks up at Malfoy again, Malfoy is already staring back.
“So a baby?”
It’s then that Harry notices Malfoy standing in the doorway watching him with his eyebrow quirked up.
She moved him into her home temporarily, insisting that is was no hassle and that she would enjoy the company. Mostly she let him be, but slowly she started asking him to help with Teddy. Running the bath water, mixing up his baby carrots. The small tasks interrupted his dark thoughts, and it was difficult to hate the world when a perfect smiling baby laughed up at you, hair the colour of violets, grass, or sometimes the night sky.
Before he can leave she says, “Oi, I expect an invitation to the wedding when it happens!”
“Like what?” Harry gasps.
“Putting your money where your mouth is would be a good start.”
Finally, Draco says, “Okay, thanks Pansy. Let me know if anything else comes out.”
Malfoy scoffs and watches again as Harry piles more food onto his plate.
That suggestion is met with silence, but Harry is happy to wait it out while Draco figures out what to say. After a little bit it seems clear that Draco isn’t going to say anything so Harry fills the silence.
Draco pushes his face into Harry’s neck. Not quite wanting the comfort, but needing the contact. “Granger seems to think otherwise.”
He won’t let himself have a panic attack. Not now. Not tonight. He grabs one of Harry’s knit jumpers and pulls it over his head. It’s lovely and warm and clearly loved by Harry, so Draco loves it too.
This leaves nothing for Harry to look at besides Malfoy, which he does. Malfoy is slightly taller than him by about a half inch, but with his pale hair hanging in his grey eyes, and a worried look on his face, he seems smaller, and far less intimidating than he used to. Harry realizes that Malfoy is staring right back. They stand in silence for a moment before Malfoy breaks it.
“Well Harry, I must get to work on supper.” Molly says finally, breaking the silence and the horrible airless spell in one go. “Are you sure you won’t stay dear?”
His eyes trail back over to the sleeping boy in the bed. He could never imagine not being careful with Draco. At least not anymore. Maybe once upon a time, but they’ve both changed and grown, and the idea of anyone hurting Draco makes Harry’s chest go tight.
It had been nothing. An experiment. Just a way for Draco to figure out what the fuck was going on in his head, to see if it truly was “just a phase” or if it was something more.
Absently, he wonders if Harry is attracted to him, but then tramps that idea down. Harry is clearly not gay or aware that he is driving Malfoy fucking beserk.
Rolling his eyes again, Draco says, “I wouldn’t expect anything less.”
Malfoy’s whiny voice brings Harry out of his head, and Harry turns to take Malfoy in.
Harry grins a little at that. Trust Malfoy to treat you like your’re worth nothing more than a sneer and an insult.
Mcgonagall answers back right away.
He rolls over and smushes his face into his pillow, letting the alarm go off for about a minute or so before finally getting up and out of bed, shutting off the alarm as he goes.
He’s reading the book Narcissa had gotten Draco for Christmas. It’s a book of poems, which strikes Harry as a sort of strange gift, but Draco has already highlighted several passages, and had read some of it out loud to Harry after a nightmare the other night. It was pretty good, and the only thing Harry could reach without disturbing Draco, so here he is.
Harry actively decides to close his mouth before answering, grabbing his wand and slipping it into the pocket of his jeans. “Ready whenever you are.”
“No.” Draco says, closing his eyes, “And I won’t accept arguments.”
Ron attempts to cut in and Hermione just talks louder over him, repeating herself.
“Hermione and I were wondering what you were up to this weekend? I know you’re probably busy at school and all but we feel like we haven’t seen you in ages, and we didn’t like how things left off after the whole talk thing.”
After the end, Harry had been unreachable for a while. Too many people had wanted pieces of him, but he really wasn’t ready to give them up. He was sharp edges and a mean mouth. Unapproachable, yet people insisted on trying to get closer. Ron and Hermione were truly the only people who he could stand to be around, and even then, he preferred to be on his own.
“You could look through the premade tattoo book if you wanted to. It’s easier than designing something on the spot.” Draco says, shrugging and glancing over to the various examples on the wall.
Harry looks at Draco consideringly. He hasn’t mentioned to Draco that he’d asked the Lovegoods if they wanted an interview. The media surrounding the whole issue had died down considerably considering no reporters could find Harry and Draco, and all their friends refused to comment, but Harry thinks that Draco may have been right about how sharing their side might make it easier for the two of them. After all, they wouldn’t always have Hogwarts as a safe haven.
Draco just waves a hand, “Consider it payback for when you missed dessert for me.”
Harry nods again, “Well, I’m here now.”
- Proves Blaise, no everybody, wrong
Harry closes the door behind them, “What’s up?”
Harry rolls his eyes, “I assumed as much, let’s go.”
They find an empty carriage for the three of them. Malfoy sits beside Harry even though there’s an entire other bench he could sit on. Harry finds that he really doesn’t mind as Malfoy’s thigh presses against his.
The rest of the day passes in a blur. Charms is wonderful because Hermione basically spends the whole lesson talking to Harry and Malfoy. They seventh years they’re mixed in with are learning a charm that Harry knows already, so he pays little attention to what Flitwick is saying. They cast a muffliato charm and spend the class teasing each other. Harry was worried at first about how Malfoy and Hermione might mix, but they are completely at ease with each other, after the month they’ve spent at school with no one else their age to talk to.
“How could you let me wear this sweater?” Draco hisses, stepping into Harry’s space.
Harry takes a deep breath, “Okay. You’re right.”
“Go,” he says to a confused looking Malfoy, “Get out of here, let me handle this.”
“Lies.” Draco mutters in his ear, “I already know I’m great fun.”
“Ron and I were just in Hogsmeade shopping when I remembered that there were some charms papers that I had to mark this weekend that I’d left behind. Anyways, we popped up to the castle and figured we could have lunch with you and Draco?”
“We’re taking a train back to London?”
“I didn’t think anyone would take the news well.” Draco says, he face not betraying any emotion.
After Starbucks Harry says goodbye to Malfoy and starts walking back to his flat. After settling down a bit, and seeing that there was nothing good on the telly, he decides to call Ron and Hermione to let them know his plan for the school year. Ron’s phone rings for so long that Harry worries he might be forwarded to his voicemail.
The house elf drops to her knees to clean up the mess, Harry darts forward to help and the elf’s eyes grow wide as she hears Narcissa walk in behind her.
“I’ve been looking for you for hours.” he growls, “Mind telling me why you didn’t answer your bloody phone?”
When he hears Draco’s hiss of breath he says, “We could always move into my flat at the end of the year if you’re that set against going back to yours.”
She looks at him for a second and says, “I’m doing okay. I’m seeing someone to help with the whole grief thing, and I started flying again so the Holyhead Harpies have asked me to try out for their lineup in the spring.”
“You’re drawing even more attention to me than I already get.” he hisses sitting down beside Harry on the crowded bench.
Harry doesn’t jump like he would have a few months ago, but he does somewhat throw himself in front of both Draco and Teddy, reaching for his wand and finding his pocket empty. Panic rears its head, but a steadying hand on his arm from Draco brings him back to the street outside the chip truck facing down two of his friends.
“I need to talk to you.” He whispers in Harry’s ear.
Draco rolls his eyes and says, “Over the moon.” in an incredibly monotonous voice.
“I needed his opinion on if I should tell my mother or not. He said I should, so I went to the manor to tell her as well.”
“Probably the fact that my mother cancelled dinner.”
Silence permeates the room and neither Malfoy or Andromeda appear as though they are going to break it.
Harry decides not to bring up his question for Malfoy until the weekend. Malfoy is too stressed to be much help in a conversation throughout the week, and they’ll actually be alone on the weekend with no one listening in on their conversations.
He turns his attention back to Neville and decides to be completely and utterly blunt. “We’re dating.”
Draco looks down at the floor and Harry nudges his foot with his own. Harry keeps his eyes trained on his shoes. “Did you tell her about us?”
They had reached the cash register, but Malfoy still turns and looks at Harry, ignoring the barista asking if she could help them.
Malfoy looks at him from where he was pulling on a high collared wool coat, fair brows raised in question.
“I’ve packed everything up already.” Draco says, standing up. “And I sent it to Hogwarts with Kreacher. We just have to get Teddy home.”
Harry leans back to look at him. He gently presses the pad of his thumb to the crease between Draco’s eyebrows and ghosts kisses across both cheekbones. “You got to see your mom, she seems happy, you have her blessing to be with me. Is there more you were expecting out of the visit?”
“What do you mean you already know what you’re getting?”
“He’s no Granger.”
Malfoy snorts again, Harry idly thinks he might change Malfoy’s name in his phone to the amazing snorting ferret.
Harry smiles at that and kisses Draco on the jaw. Draco pauses for a moment to kiss Harry properly before turning back to finish unwrapping the gift.
Draco looks up, his face once again carefully blank, “Oh, is that so?”
Harry can feel the tears welling up in his eyes again, and this time he just squeezes his eyes shut and hopes no one can tell when he pulls away. Arthur shakes his hand before turning to go change out of his robes. Ron follows Harry out to the front lawn.
Some cuteness and Draco forcing our boi Harry to think and talk about his emotions
In a whining voice Malfoy responds, “Potter, it’s six o’clock in the morning, I most certainly don’t need to be up until 8.”
“What do we have on the docket for today Malfoy?” Harry asks, swinging his leg over the bench and sitting down.
“You didn’t.” Harry says, unfolding the heavy blanket to look at it more fully.
The infuri.
He pauses before gently saying, “Do you know what caused it? Can I do anything besides sitting here to make it easier?”
The phone clicks off and in the next second Harry is pulling on his jacket and trainers.
Malfoy doesn’t say anything to that but starts shoveling the food off his plate and into his mouth at such an astonishing pace that Harry counts it as a win.
Harry smiles at that and takes Malfoy’s offered hand up.
Harry looks down at where his hands are still twisted in Draco’s shirt. “I just think it’s time I told you something I’ve known for a while now… you don’t have to say it back.”
Harry laughs before saying, “Come on, let’s go to Hogwarts.”
“I think,” Draco whispers, scared to voice this thought in case it makes it unreal, “I think that maybe he likes me too.”
Grinning, Harry replies, “Absolutely no one believes that Malfoy.”
Draco shrugs before grabbing some pancakes off the counter and taking his seat at Harry’s side, “It’s harder for me to sleep when you’re not there.”
Malfoy rolls his eyes, “Simply to remind you of the time when you illegally snuck into Hogsmead and went on to torture Crabbe, Goyle and I by throwing ice and mud at us while under that blasted invisibility cloak of yours.”
While thinking this, Harry misses whatever Hermione says back but tunes in to hear Draco say, “I’m his boyfriend Hermione.”
With shaky hands he takes out his key and unlocks the flat door. He collapses on the other side, sliding down the door until he sits on the floor with his knees drawn up to his chest. He can hear his racing heartbeat, as well as a voice that sounds suspiciously like Voldemort’s in his ear.
And soon enough there is a roaring conversation about quidditch at their table. Hermione, rolling her eyes, gets up to get a butterbeer and get away from the constant quidditch talk.
Malfoy groans audibly, and cracks one eye open to glare in Harry’s direction.
Harry nods, “Thank you. I’m sorry Ginny.”
Before he has time to ask, he’s swept up by Kreacher apparating them back to Hogwarts. He lands with knee buckling grace in their room and moves to sit on his bed, noticing that they have been pushed back to the original closeness. He doesn’t think he’ll mind this time around.
Harry pulls Draco in closer so that they’re practically nose to nose, and sighs happily before saying, “Morning to you too, Draco.”
Harry quickly loses track of any conversation going on between Malfoy and Hermione as his mind laser focuses on Malfoy’s hand.
“Teddy needs a bath, and if we’re going out, I’m gonna need a shower.”
“No no, she didn’t like throw herself down the stairs. The healers are saying that she likely fainted due to lack of nutrition and all that. Grief related.”
Harry scoffs, and this causes Draco to peek his head out from under the blankets.
Harry looks at him quickly before saying, “George and Ginny don’t like it.”
“All these pictures are completely out of context.” He says finally, looking up at Hermione and Ron handing the newspaper back, while his other hand drifts to Draco’s thigh beneath the blanket. “Seriously, nothing they’ve said there is true.”
“Anyone who spends literally any time with him can tell he’s not happy in what he’s doing. He’s missed Auror training for over a week, and doesn’t seem the slightest bit torn up about it.”
“When did you get so clingy?”
Harry just nods, his throat feeling too tight to speak, and claps Ron on the shoulder before disapparating into Hogsmead.
Harry snorts in response. “You like it here, don’t deny it.”
“Yes. Malfoy.” Harry says, attempting to look aloof and disinterested.
Mrs. Weasley nods slightly before looking at Harry. “I didn’t forget you for Christmas this year, I just wanted to give you your present in person.”
Harry looks up at Draco, only to see the other boy’s mouth hanging open and shock written across his face. “I didn’t think you’d thought about it.”
“Morning Malfoy.” Harry smirks, adding more eggs to the sizzling pan.
*  *  *
“You only answered one of my questions Malfoy, can I do anything to make it easier.
Draco stands up and goes to leave the store, but Harry scrambles up and grabs his hand before he can get too far.
Draco has three words bouncing around in his head: WHAT. THE. FUCK?????
Hermione finally breaks away and says, “Come on, let’s go get some breakfast before it’s all gone.”
Harry looks at him for another few seconds before laying down and tucking his face into the crook of Draco’s neck and saying, “Maybe, but I wish you didn’t have to.”
“Potter,” he says between gasping breaths, “I would pay good money to have seen Chang demolish you in public.”
Harry wakes up to the sound of an alarm going off on his phone. Though it was him that had set the alarm, he still groans and swears as if it was someone else's phone.
“Why were you calling Pansy?” Harry asks, careful to keep anything accusatory out if his voice.
“What are you talking about, Draco?” Harry asks, leaning in closer to inspect the present, “You’re an honorary Gryffindor now, it’s only natural to have some merch. Besides you’re the one who is always sticking your freezing socked feet between mine when we’re sleeping.”
Harry waits in silence for what feels like forever when Malfoy finally answers.
They stand like that for a few more minutes, just breathing each other in, before Draco finally pushes Harry gently to the side.
“Malfoy, don’t be ridiculous, of course you’re my friend.” Harry says this, but can’t help but feel like friend isn’t a big enough word for their relationship.
Malfoy rolls his eyes before pulling Harry in by the tie for a bruising kiss. He seems to be trying to say something to Harry, and Harry wants to figure out what, but he is quickly distracted by Malfoy undoing his tie and pulling Harry’s shirt off over his head.
Draco nods once. “Eat your food Harry, we need to take Teddy back home soon.”
“I’m at Hermione and Ron’s place, why?”
“Master Malfoy,” she drops into a rushed curtsy, “Tilly offers her most greatest apologies, I has not heard of your arriving any time soon.”
Sighing shakily Hermione says “It’s alright he needed to find out eventually, he just needs to cool down a bit.”
Suddenly, as if they share one mind, the kitchen falls silent and everyone is sitting looking at Harry. Harry absently wipes his hands on his jeans, Arthur and Molly are looking at him from across the table and Ron claps Harry gently on the shoulder.
Silence. But then, “Draco? As in Draco Malfoy?”
“Do you have a peeler?” He asks, taking a seat at the table.
Draco looks at him for a moment before smiling slightly, a mere quirk of the lips. “Come on, Potter. I have something planned.”
“Well,” Draco says pulling the corner of the blanket to be over both their laps, “As we’re in my flat and you sleep in my bed at the castle, I think it’s fair for me to pick what goes on the bed.”
Draco squeezing his knee brings him back to the present “-getting fussy maybe we should head home.”
Harry tunes back in a second too late and can’t stop himself from saying, “What?”
“Ya I know.” Draco says stiffly, catching sight of Harry and waving with one hand before leaning back against the wall and focusing back on the phone call.
“Yes.” Harry says simply.
They’re all gathered in the sitting room. Harry, Draco, Ron and Hermione wedged onto a couch, and everyone else on an assortment of chairs and pouffes. Harry’s arm is once again around him, and Draco has his head leaning on Harry’s shoulder while Ron shows Harry some video on his phone. It’s almost peaceful.
“Hey, what’s up?”
Blaise had said nothing at first, but he had hugged Draco silently.
Harry nods, realizing that that explanation makes perfect sense. He switches topics.
Harry knows Malfoy’s words hold some bite, but he’s also come to recognize that he’s usually snarky when he’s nervous or afraid, so he waits quietly until Draco calms down a bit.
“Mhm.” Hermione’s answer comes through the phone.
“I’m only teasing Malfoy. Do you really want to know my type?”
“About what you’re going to say to the press.” Draco replies, grabbing a blanket off the back of the couch before straddling Harry’s waist and looking at him expectantly.
“You didn’t have to say what you said to the Weasley’s.” He breathes before sucking a mark at the place where Draco’s neck and collarbone meet.
“Of course, don’t be silly Harry.”
“What do you mean, Ginny?” Harry asks cautiously, sitting up a little straighter, “You guys already know about me and Draco, what more is there to talk about?”
When they get to the Starbucks, Harry orders their drinks while Draco grabs their normal seats at the back. Marissa’s familiar face grins at him when he gets to the register. Her trademark silvery blue hair is now bubblegum pink.
Eventually Teddy passes out in Draco’s lap, and Harry chuckles as Draco gently sets his own plate on the babies back. Draco shoots a glare in Harry’s direction, but still leans into his side when he drapes an arm over his shoulder.
“You said you’d get my drink, but that doesn’t mean you ordered it correctly. You seem like the kind of person who might purposely mess up a blokes drink when he’s done nothing to deserve it." Malfoy makes grabby hands for his beverage, taking the lid off his cup and inspecting it’s contents.
Harry turns to look in the direction Malfoy is pointing, and the memory floods his head. A smile cracks across his face. That had been a perfect thing to happen. And just like that he’s back in his own mind. Malfoy seems to know this and steps so that he’s beside him again. Their shoulders are touching, but Harry doesn’t make any move to step away from him. He needs the support. Without giving himself a second to reenter the headspace that he was just in, Harry starts forward with Malfoy to enter the great hall.
Harry nods, “And Pansy?”
“Is that all Professor?” drawls Malfoy.
He realizes that he’ll likely have to clean him in the sink as he doesn’t have a bathtub at his house and wonders how a seven month year old baby is going to fit into his kitchen sink. It’s while he is contemplating this issue that his phone rings.
Malfoy laughs and gets up to go to the washroom, leaving Harry to think about what he wants more. To be an Auror or to go back home to Hogwarts. Being an Auror has been his dream for what seems like forever, but realistically, he already has his accreditation and Hogwarts won’t always be there for him. No matter what Dumbledore had told him all those years ago, Hogwarts can’t always welcome him home. Not if he’s thirty and has three kids. Harry texts Hermione quickly.
At this Draco looks up finally and meets Harry’s eyes, “I just know what the cruciatus curse is like and I don’t really think it’s laugh worthy material.”
“Harry.” Harry corrects him, smiling and looking at him out of the corner of his eye. “And how am I supposed to tell the difference between what’s mine and yours when your stuff is just thrown all over my room?”
“Ya, it was just a bit much today.”
“How’d your talk with Weasley go?” He asks abruptly, tearing his eyes away from Harry’s overladen fork.
Hermione’s voice is beginning to slur with the edges of sleep, and Harry is struggling to keep his eyes open so with a promise to talk again soon, they each say goodnight and hang up.
Draco looks up, clearly slightly surprised at being asked, “It was good, overwhelming. It would have been better with you there.”
He can’t believe this is the doofus Gryffindor that his heart has decided it wants.
“Harry,” Draco starts, brushing his thumb over the back of Harry’s hand. “I barely survived dinner with your family, I hardly think all the Gryffindors are going to suddenly want me around.”
He’s in the Forest of Dean again and in the pond, but instead of Ron coming to save him the locket twists tighter, and the water gets colder. He. Can’t. Breathe. He kicks his feet harder against the water but he feels himself being pulled down into the inky pond. His toes touch slimy plants at the bottom-
Harry would have bristled slightly and stood in saunch defence of the Weasley’s if Malfoy hadn’t sounded so worried that they were actually going to appear.
“And what the bloody hell do you know Harry? He’s scum and you’re, you’re blinded by whatever obsession you seem to have in redeeming people.” Ron shouts this and before either him or Hermione can get a word in he starts up again, “You’re not going back to that school Hermione. Not while he’s there. I don’t give a rats arse about how he’s somehow redeemed himself. He can be redeemable there and you can be safe here.”
When Harry finally does make it back to the castle night has fallen. He isn’t really sure where the day went, and honestly, he doesn’t really want to think about most of it. His mind is still stuck on the look on Ginny’s face when he came clean. The quickly masked hurt on George’s face.
Malfoy sits tense and shaking under Harry’s arm, but eventually after what must have been an hour, the shaking stops. It’s at this point that Harry realizes that Malfoy is slumped snoring against his side. The git is asleep. Harry snorts, and withdraws his arm from Malfoy’s shoulders. Malfoy wakes up at the jostling and gazes bleary and confused up at Harry. He runs a tired hand through his rumpled hair.
“Isn’t it?” Malfoy manages to somehow make this comment sound insincere. Harry glances at him before responding.
Draco nods and seemingly with great hesitation starts talking again. “Lovegood mentioned the other day to me that she helps with counselling or some other type of Muggle treatment… have you considered it at all?”
“I don’t want to do that Hermione.” Harry says, closing his eyes for a second before continuing, “The wizarding world doesn’t deserve every single detail of my life just because of who I am.”
Ron hurries to catch up with Malfoy, and Harry distinctly hears, “Oi, amazing bouncing ferret, hold up!”
“So’s a baby.” Shoots back Harry as Teddy takes the final bite of food.
“Don’t be stupid Malfoy, the Weasley’s wouldn’t come near you with a ten foot pole.”
“Honestly Potter, I’m surprised you landed on your own two feet. I’ve heard Weasley mention that you’ve made a wrong turn before.”
“So,” She starts, taking a sip of her tea, “Why don’t we start with you telling me what caused you to call me last night.”
“Everything okay?” Harry asks, twisting his hand in the fabric of Draco’s shirt.
“Well she and I have special permission from Mcgonagall, it was a big thing with the ministry and I almost didn’t get one. Granger and Mcgonagall vouched for me though so I ended up getting it.”
Before long, Hermione and Ron show up. It provides enough distraction for Draco to turn to Harry and whisper into his ear, “This is a lot.”
Harry rolls his eyes but stands up and slowly lowers Teddy into the playpen. Malfoy gently grabs his hand after a moment of watching Teddy and guides him to the bedroom.
“No seriously, Malfoy,” Harry laughs spooning another mouthful into Teddy’s mouth, “You’re whiny, food driven and hate it when the attention isn’t on you. Pretty much the definition for  baby.”
Boys like Harry don’t end up with boys like Draco.
“Or maybe,” says a hopeful voice in the back of his head, “Maybe he likes you too.”
Harry nods again and Malfoy looks at him for another few seconds before turning back and talking to Hermione.
Draco doesn’t seem to mind though, taking it all in stride he loops an arm around Harry’s waist and pulls him towards a booth with Ron, Hermione, Dean and Seamus in it.
Maybe Harry flirts with everyone. Pansy used to be like that, charming boys with her seductive comments, sometimes not even realizing that her smile made people melt.
Harry and Hermione gasp, but Ron shakes his head quickly.
The silence on the other end is all the confirmation Harry needs. He barely registers moving across the room to wake Draco.
“Seriously Potter, what do you want?”
“Hey Harry, just the usual?”
There’s silence for a few seconds. Harry wonders when they stopped knowing how to talk to one another. Finally, Ginny speaks, quieter than her normal steely voice.
Draco raises an eyebrow but says nothing.
“This was a bad idea.”
“Of course,” Harry says, looking up a Draco under his lashes, “That’s all this is.”
Draco sits back down on the bed and starts fiddling with his phone as Harry examines the clothing Draco thrust upon him. The shirt is a checkered red and white one with the sweater being the same reddish colour. Harry doesn’t think he’s ever seen Draco wear them, and frankly, can’t picture him ever wearing either of these things. He says as much to Draco.
“Bloody hell.” Harry mutters before phoning Hermione.
“It’s so good to see you Harry, dear.” She says finally, pulling back to look at him, “You’re still too thin, would you like a snack?”
“Ugh fine,” Malfoy says releasing his grip on Harry and standing up with him, “Let’s feed the brat.”
Hermione sighs like talking to him is the biggest chore in the world, rather than chatting with a good friend.
Malfoy’s silver eyes look up at Harry questioning.
Harry nods at this and turns back to his food. He’ll have to try talking to Malfoy after potions when he’s less stressed. As he reaches this decision and starts to butter some toast, a large barn owl swoops down and lands on Harry’s plate knocking a glass of orange juice over in the process.
He feels like he is hyper fixated on Malfoy’s every action. The hand on his thigh, the delicate movement of his wrist as he gathers food onto his fork, the quirk of his mouth that hints at a grin when he tries not to laugh at a joke Ron makes. How has he not realized this before, that the person that occupies the majority of his thoughts is Malfoy?
Immediately, Draco’s arm drops in an attempt to give Harry space if he needs it. Harry just shakes his head, and crawls back into bed. He looks back, confused when Draco doesn't immediately follow him.
When they get back to the flat hours later, they make out messily on the landing outside of the door, until a neighbour walks past and mutters that they should “Get a room.”
Swiveling in their seats, Malfoy, Harry and Hermione take in the tall figure cutting his way through the crowded hall. Harry feels Malfoy tense beside him, and hears Hermione mutter a curse before preparing to stand up. A sense of dread fills Harry’s stomach as he realizes who it is.
Harry whips around and finds himself reaching for Draco’s hand before even fully realizing that it’s Draco standing in front of him.
Mcgonagall nods at this and says “Very well Potter. Get on your way, both of you, I need to get ready for my morning classes.”
But then stupid Potter with his stupid hair, and stupid eyes, and stupid smile, and worst of all his stupid hero complex had to come and ruin Draco’s fucking life.
Draco smirks and picks Teddy up from the floor and stands up. “Let’s go Potter, the park isn’t gonna come to us.”
“Is this true Potter? You’d like to come back to Hogwarts to maybe try for a different profession?”
Yet, Harry squints and is greeted with the same pale skin and face made for sneering. About the same height from what he can tell of the person sitting down. Just slightly taller than him. The hair is uncharacteristically rumpled though, as if the owner had spent a lot of time running his hands through it in frustration. And he looks less put together than he normally does, wearing an old knit jumper with the sleeves pushed up to the elbows as he stares at his laptop in focus.
Malfoy and Ron are sitting across from one another, and appear to have been studiously ignoring each other before the arrival of Harry and Hermione.
“Looked your fill yet, Potter?” Malfoy snipes.
Harry allows Malfoy to move him into the cupboard with minimal protesting.
It would be so easy to blend in here, he could lead a happy life. Waking up early on Saturdays to take Teddy to the park, sharing bites of a pop tart with Malfoy, lazy kisses over the coffee pot.
This time when they kiss, it’s slow and sweet. It still tastes like cheap beer and chips, but again, Harry wouldn’t have it any other way. Perfectly content to kiss Draco under the moon for the rest of his life.
Harry scoffs and rolls his eyes, but doesn’t argue. This close, he is reminded of their difference in height. The mere inch and half that Malfoy has always had over him. They both remain silent, Malfoy’s eyes filled with fury.
Sighing he pulls it out to reads a text from Harry that simply says:
Before Harry knows it, Teddy is back in Andromeda's arms and he and Draco are tumbling out of the grate into McGonagall’s empty office. They head back to their room, Harry clutching Draco’s hand tighter when the other boy goes to drop it. Draco shoots him a look, but as there is no one in the corridors, says nothing.
“No, Harry. No they most certainly were not.”
Later that night, after Blaise had left, Lucius informed Draco at dinner that if he ever caught wind of Draco doing something like that again he would be out of the house and no longer heir to the family fortune and estate. His mother had sat crying, but said nothing.
“I’m having a perfectly nice conversation, Potter. Wait your turn.”
“It’s fine,” replies Harry, mopping up the blood with the sleeve of his robe, “Can you just mend it please?”
“Well I’ll see you in charms later this afternoon, have a good rest of the day boys.”
A cheer goes up through the bar, and Seamus groans, slumping into Dean’s side as the other boy squeezes his shoulder comfortingly. Draco and Seamus leave to get another drink at the bar, arguing about something else, when Dean looks across the table at Harry.
Harry sighs and says, “Well I guess we’ll find out when Malfoy wakes up won’t we?”
Draco looks at Harry quickly, and Harry gives him a quick smile before pulling him into the house.
That night, when Harry wakes up tangled in his Gryffindor sheets, screaming from a nightmare. Draco pulls his gasping body closer to him, and Harry makes a decision.
“Blimey, that’s brilliant! Thanks Kreacher, I’ll probably ask for you to come back later with some food if that’s alright?”
Harry shakes his head and continues silently tapping away at his laptop. Malfoy sighs as if Harry’s presence greatly inconvenience him, but allows him to remain where he is. Neither boy comments on how different the situation would be if they were at Hogwarts. Glaring at each other across the Great Hall from rival houses. Instead, they simply type away in harmony, each focusing on their own task. After a couple of hours Malfoy begins packing up.
Ron breaths in finally and says, “No Mom says that she can’t have guests until tomorrow,” he hesitates for a second, darting his eyes to Harry and then Hermione before adding, “Ginny says she doesn’t want you to come Harry.”
Draco nods but says, “Just give me a second.”
“I was thinking we could go out for dinner together. Like actual dinner, not just a chip truck.”
“Okay.” Draco whispers again, his one hand smoothing up and down Harry’s back, “Okay.”
He peeks his head into the Great Hall and doesn’t see Malfoy’s distinctive hair, so he continues towards their room, yawning and stretching his arms above his head.
Sighing, Draco closes his eyes again and leans forward so that their foreheads are touching. They sit quietly for a moment before Draco finally feels brave enough to do this.
It’s almost midnight, and Harry finds himself on some sort of makeshift dance floor with Draco. He’s well and truly drunk by this point and happy to cling to Draco and sway to music while other people dance around him.
Little do they know how far he’s fallen. His father would disown him if he ever found out. He made sure Draco knew that when he caught Draco kissing Blaise.
Before long though, Draco is ordering Harry put on his coat and boots while stuffing mittens and a hat in his general direction. Harry, ever the boy who obeys orders, does as he is told. Draco takes Harry’s mittened hand as soon as Harry is fully dressed and they walk out of the room.
Ron gives a victorious whoop and Harry hears movement on the end that suggested Ron had pulled her in for a hug. Hermione murmurs something to Ron and Ron murmurs something back. It suddenly felt as though Harry was third wheeling on an intimate moment. He absentmindedly picks at a splinter in his hand that must have been from flying earlier while he waits for them to tune back in. After another minute Hermione’s voice comes through the phone again.
“Oi! I said no peeking!
“Last I checked you aren’t my mother, Potter. Stop acting like it.”
Harry’s smile makes this whole thing seem worth it.
“Well you’re more than welcome to, I just figured private quarter would keep you away from more people.” gently she adds “It might be easier for the two of you.”
- Seems to be mostly physical for Harry
But the smile gives Harry pause. The secretive smiles when no one is looking and the bruising kiss in the cupboard suggest to Harry that there is something more to Malfoy’s affections than just messing around.
Hey y'all hope you enjoy this chapter, it's very self indulgent.
Harry waits for him to elaborate but no answers seemed forthcoming. Harry tries again.
“What’s up.”
It’s loud in the kitchen. George walks through the door and Ron apparates in not long after. It’s hectic. Molly is desperately whipping up some food for everyone to eat, Arthur is discussing changes in the Auror lineup with Ron, George is sitting silently at the table, tracking conversations with his eyes but barely contributing. Ginny is still in her room.
Harry shakes his head without removing it from it’s position in Draco’s neck.
Harry thinks this is an incredibly important question and gently turns Malfoy’s face towards him before breathing one word in answer.
Harry springs away from Malfoy’s side and whips around with his wand raised, only to see Hermione looking at him with one eyebrow raised.
“Malfoy would you shut up!?” Malfoy closes his mouth and focuses his wide eyes on Harry.  “Hermione wanted to talk to me because she felt it was time that someone explained to me how crazy I am about you, because apparently I couldn’t figure it out myself!” He flings his arms out dramatically when he finishes.
Draco looks at him quickly. “Don’t be silly, Potter. I can make something. Just sit down, okay?”
“Where are you going in such a rush Malfoy?”
Harry grins up at him and starts to respond, but Malfoy crowds back into his space and soon enough his mouth is on Harry’s again.
Your guys's comments and kudos mean the world to us and makes writing this even better:) Thanks for sticking with us so far, we hope you enjoy this chapter<3
“He needs his bottle,” Harry says into Malfoy’s mouth, “You have to let me get up.”
- Feels good
“So about last night-” Harry starts, letting the sentence trail off in the hopes of Malfoy picking it up.
“Your boy has gotten himself rather tipsy, Weasley.” Draco drawls as he neatly deposits Harry in one side of the booth and slides in next to him pressing his thigh against Harry’s.
Harry frowns. That doesn’t seem right to him. Quidditch was one of his favourite things about Hogwarts and he knows that it would probably help a lot of people relax and get used to being surrounded by good magic again. Without a word to Malfoy he heads to the broomshed behind the dressing rooms. It isn’t locked because all that is in there are the old school brooms. Even if it had been Harry would have found a way to spell it open. He hears Malfy come up behind him and Harry blindly thrusts a battered cleansweep seven into his hands.
Even with all the cards from friends, Harry notices that there is no package from Mrs Weasley this year. He does his best to ignore the sinking feeling in his chest when he remembers that he and Draco are bringing Teddy and Andromeda to the Weasley’s on boxing day. This means that Harry and Draco have Christmas all to themselves.
Harry tells her, Draco joining in in the conversation to show her his new socks. Ron makes his way over at some point and argues with Draco about the merits of various quidditch teams, and who he thinks is going to make the playoffs.
Draco, the broken boy. When he walks by people huddle and talk, but it’s not in the way he’d like. They gossip about his involvement with the death eaters, and the latest news of his father in Azkaban. Most Christmas vacations he packs a duffel and returns to the manor for the most grueling holiday of the year, filled with long silences across stressed dinner tables. Though this year he’ll probably stay at Hogwarts, he might enjoy the time alone in the castle, as opposed to being hit with flashbacks every time he turns a corner in his home. Ministry workers deny his resumes and teachers grudgingly deal him good grades.
“Well in that case I can help you with the homework.” Malfoy makes to stand up, but Harry is already leaving.
“Okay,” Harry says, biting down a smile and running his fingers through Draco’s hair.
Harry slips his own chain on over his head and settles it beneath his jumper on his skin. “I figured that we won’t always have classes together or be with each other when things get shitty, so it’s as much a present for you as it is for me.”
“Lupin was one of the few adults in my life who would do anything for me without expecting anything in return. So ya I guess his office would make me feel safe.”
Harry looks at Malfoy in shock. “What makes you think I’ll be doing homework tonight when we didn’t get to eat dinner and I lost a gallon of blood defending you.”
Harry shrugs, but swallows his food in order to better answer Malfoy.
Draco presses a kiss to his forehead and mumbles, “Point taken, Potter.” While wrapping his arms tighter around Harry.
“And you say I’m the sweet one.” Harry says, leaning in to kiss Draco.
“It was just an argument that got out of hand Professor, it won’t happen again.”
“Oh who cares.” Malfoy says, pulling the door closed behind them and casting a quick spell under his breath to lock it.
“Alright Ron, I’ve gotta go. I’ll text you later.” Harry says, already focusing on Malfoy instead of the conversation.
They take quick showers in the change room and head back to the castle.
“Fuck.” Harry swears, pausing in his search for a jumper to look at Draco, who's still very naked and very still listening to whatever Pansy is saying to him on the phone. “Fuck.” he says again, turning his attention back to clothing. “Give us ten minutes and then you can come over, I’ll send you the address.”
Harry pulls back to look at Draco, but he won’t meet his eyes.
“I’m good Percy. How’s work?” Harry asks, tearing his eyes away from his boys and shaking Percy’s hand.
The socks in question are rather fun, covered in dancing snakes. Leave it to Malfoy to be the one person he knows with personalized house socks. Harry’s own feet dig into the plush carpet underneath his toes.
Luckily, daycare isn’t something they have to consider. He heads to the kitchen and starts making pancakes while giving Teddy some cut up fruit to gnaw on. He’s just sitting down to feed Teddy when Draco walks in.
Harry is shocked, and stands frozen for a moment while his brain catches up with what's happening. Malfoy starts to pull away when he realizes that Harry isn’t kissing him back, but Harry finds himself making a noise in his throat and putting his hands on Malfoy’s waist, twisting the fabric off his robes in his fingers and pulling him closer.
“Ouch.”
“I already hate you Potter.” Malfoy says quickly, following Harry into the living room.
“Kreacher,” Harry starts, “Would you mind warming this place up and getting some food started please?”
Malfoy has apparated them into the room where so much horror took place, except all that greets Harry is a large dining table and grand windows lined with silver curtains.
Vaguely, Harry notes that his players have paused in the drill that he’s running to focus on his and Malfoy’s conversation, but can’t find it in himself to look away from Malfoy.
After showering Harry meets Malfoy at the Slytherin table for dinner. Malfoy’s hair is pushed back and still wet from the shower but he doesn’t seem to care as he is pouring over the notes he had taken at practice.
Why can’t anything ever be easy?
They’re both silent for a moment, remembering astronomy towers and vanishing cabinets. Harry shakes his head, he didn’t want to fight with Hermione about Malfoy of all people.
“Hey Hermione,” Harry smiles at how happy she sounds to be talking to him, it is reassuring to know that with all the changes going on in his life right now, he can always count on these two.
Harry grins over at Malfoy, “Malfoy are we talking about our crushes? We’ve reached that level of friendship?” How exciting, I’ll have to tell my my journal.” He continues on in an eerily high voice, “Dear Diary, today Malfoy and I chatted about the objects of our affection over a glass of pumpkin juice-
“Seriously Harry…. What’s going on?” He whispers the words under his breath, eyes darting to where Malfoy and Luna are talking about baby food.
Harry smiles slightly despite himself and sets his phone down. He almost wishes Malfoy were here. He’s not sure what good that would do for him. He’d likely just make a fool of himself and make Malfoy even less interested than he already is.
Her eyes are focused on Harry’s and Draco’s linked hands. Draco makes to pull their clasped hands closer to his body and out of sight, but Harry refuses to let him. If he was any other person he wouldn’t get hounded or bothered like this. He doesn’t want to have to hide what he and Draco have, but he doesn’t think the public deserves an explanation either.
Harry looks up from where he’s pulling up his socks, “What are you talking about Malfoy?”
Distantly Harry hears himself laugh, and he gets up and hugs Hermione, he tries to ignore the prickling of emotion behind his eyes..
Draco takes a deep breath and turns to look at Harry incredulously, “She has pictures of us, Potter. Pictures of us holding hands. It will get out either way.”
Harry knows this argument is only avoiding the real issue. But still, he forcefully pokes Malfoy in the chest, suddenly aware of how close they’ve gotten before saying, “Oh, because you’re bloody Shakespeare when it comes to words Malfoy, you’re just a fountain of eloquent language!?”
For the first time Draco looks nervous, unsure. “I’m going to get my dark mark covered up and I thought maybe you might like to come with me and get your own tattoo, something meaningful. I’ve reserved an appointment for the two of us and I’d like to do this for you as a gift.”
“Quit being a fucking martyr Malfoy, I apparated half way accross town. And I missed dessert. I’m not going to just sit on your bloody bathroom floor and do nothing.”
“Well as you’re already dressed for it, go ahead.” Harry replies, laughing slightly at how much of a non-morning person Draco is.
Harry lowers himself into the chair across Teddy and picks up the bowl and spoon. Teddy looks at him with big crocodile tears in his eyes, and Harry tries a spoonful of food.
“Right, ya that’s fine I’ll see you in a few then.”
Harry hangs up the phone and calls for Kreacher. A loud bang sounds in the deserted corridor and Kreacher appears in front of him. Still sporting Regulus’s locket and a white bath towel, he grins when he sees Harry.
Draco laughs, though it sounds like a sob and grabs Harry’s face, pulling him in for a rough kiss.
He realizes that he knows more little things about Malfoy than he does about anyone else, but he pushes that thought to the back of his mind.
“Hermione and I are coming over, what’s the address.”
*  *  *
“Seriously Malfoy, he won’t stop crying otherwise.”
One of the regular baristas greets him. She’s a face he sees often during his late night work sessions here. She’s one of those artistic types with pale silvery blue hair and a septum piercing in her nose. She’s probably only a little older than him, and judging by the copious amounts of eyeliner being used to hide the enormous bags under her eyes, is probably a college student just trying to keep up.
Without waiting for a response, Harry grabs Malfoy’s hand again and drags him up the stairs to his third floor flat.
After the first class, Harry rushes back to his and Malfoy’s room and pukes into their toilet. Malfoy finds him lying on the floor hours later and wordlessly sits at his side.
It’s unbearably soft, and Harry had to look away for a moment to handle it.
“Draco?” A stressed voice that Harry doesn’t immediately recognize says.
“What about the fact that a vicious article has been written about the two of you, and I don’t see either of you denying what was said in it.”
“Frankly, I don’t care if anyone sees us. I’ve told Ron and Hermione and they’re the people I care amount most.”
Harry finds himself sliding his hands up under Malfoy’s shirt and between buttons. He contemplates ripping it off but doesn’t think Malfoy would appreciate that. Shakily, he starts trying to undo the buttons in the dark.
“Don’t look at me like that.” Draco says, using his hand to gently push Harry’s head to the side.
Tryouts are every bit as awful as Harry remembers them being. Ravenclaws and Hufflepuffs both show up just to fuck with them, and some first years who have only ridden a broom during the class sessions with Harry and Madam Hooch concuss themselves by flying headlong into the stands.
Harry grins at Malfoy’s side when one obnoxious fifth year demands to know why, “Fucking Potter is at our goddamn tryouts?”
“Oh it definitely is,” Malfoy starts, leaving kisses along Harry’s jawline and neck, “I would have had you in fourth year, but you had to go and date fucking Cho Change and ruin everything.”
There’s silence on the other end, “So you haven’t seen the Daily Prophet yet?”
Harry is looking in the mirror. He’s opted to wear jeans and a plain green jumper of Draco’s that “make his eyes pop.” He’s unsuccessfully trying to flatten his hair, but abandons that when he sees Draco come up behind him.
When they land, Harry is forced to take a few breaths because it’s exactly like one of his nightmares. The only difference is that he knows he’s awake.
“Malfoy where are you taking me?”
*  *  *
Harry’s hand drifts down to Malfoy’s face. Running his fingers along Malfoy’s jaw he says, “Why wouldn’t I be?”
“What do you think of Teddy?” Harry asks, fisting his hand in Malfoy’s sweater and snuggling imperceptibly closer.
“Merlin,” Draco groans, “Of course they do.”
Their feet slam into semi frozen ground, and dry leaves swirl past them. Malfoy curls his hands into his sleeves for warmth. Harry recognizes the outskirts of Hogsmead and as he lets go of Malfoy’s arm his mind unhelpfully supplies a barrage of memories including caterwaul charms, gripping a dying Dumbledore’s arm and a large black dog bounding towards him with a newspaper in its mouth. Harry closes his eyes against the onslaught of grief that overcomes him at the last memory. Maybe it’s too soon, maybe this is a bad idea. Trying to get a hold of himself he turns to Malfoy who is squinting into the mid morning sun.
Days would pass him by and he would have only a hazy realization that it was happening. It got to the point where Kreacher found him one morning lying in bed unable or unwilling to get up. Harry still isn’t sure which it was.
“Sorry mate, I don’t mean to offend, but you two have been coming here for months together and I’ve just been waiting to see how it would play out. I have a bet with another girl going on if you’d confess your love or remain dudebros. And judging from the fact that he’s wearing clothing that I’ve seen you wear on multiple occasions, it finally happened and I’m going to make quite a bit of money.”
“Mate, you need to calm down.” He hears himself say.
“So I’m not your boyfriend am I, Potter?” Malfoy continues, looking down at the floor.
Malfoy sits up in his bed, hair askew, ready for an argument even at seven o’clock in the morning, “It’s so nice of you to take my hobbies into account Potter, really, thanks for being such a splendid roomie.”
Malfoy eyes Harry consideringly, before turning away and saying quietly, “Did I really win you over?”
“I’ll just go grab him and then you boys can be on your way.” Andromeda says over her shoulder as she exits the room.
Malfoy seems slightly stunned by this response but doesn’t say anything as he sets his bag down. Harry watches this all happen and desperately wants to talk to him but knows that now is not the time.
Harry closes his eyes and hopes for sleep.
For the first time in Harry’s fairly long life dealing with professor Mcgonagall he is pleased to hear those words. Without saying goodbye to the students, he pushes through them after the Headmistress, dragging Malfoy along with him.
“We’re not doing class today?” Harry asks, his thumb brushing along the base of Draco’s spine.
“What does it look like, Potter?” Draco asks.
Malfoy doesn’t answer for a moment but his hand finds Harry’s under the table and squeezes tightly before saying, “Alright Potter, but I’m not changing dirty diapers.”
Malfoy scoffs as Harry stands up to get a washcloth for Teddy. Harry looks back at him but Malfoy is busy looking at Teddy. Teddy is looking right back and starts giggling for no apparent reason. Malfoy’s mouth twitches up in one corner and he raises his hand for Teddy to grab on to. Teddy complies and Malfoy is stuck with a baby holding his hand and covering it in what Harry has determined is squash baby food.
Kreacher nods and waddles into the kitchen, leaving Harry on the floor.
Harry shakes his head and moves his eyes to Malfoy’s face. “There are other things I’m more interested in focusing on Malfoy.”
Harry notices that there is a flush high on Malfoy’s cheekbones, his eyes are downcast.
Sighing, Harry turns back around and marches in the direction of the Slytherin table. Cries from his fellow Gryffindors follow him, but he ignores it. He ignores them all. The questions, sneers, stares, everything. He ignores everything until his sinks onto the Slytherin bench across from Malfoy.
“Hello?? Meet at charms room?”
There’s silence for a moment and if Harry didn’t know Hermione as well as he did, he’d think she was gone.
He turns to find Teddy’s bath stuff when Malfoy catches his arm.
“What are you getting?”
“I love you, Harry, and Ron does too. We’ll always love you.”
“Okay, I’ll think about it.” Harry says, letting go of Draco’s hands in favor of putting them on his hips and slipping his thumbs under the hem of Draco’s jumper, “Can we kiss now?”
Scoffing Harry replies, “Of course, but I still got to eat occasionally when that happened.”
Malfoy snorts, “Clearly not, or you’d know that the only way to get to Hogwarts for the time being is by walking in from the Village. If you tried to apparate directly to the front gates or to the train platform, you’d be rebounded immediately.”
And so it hadn’t. Blaise had told him he didn’t think he was gay after all, and Pansey had asked him to go to the Yule Ball with her. So he did.
“I understand that,” Says Draco, grabbing Harry’s free hand and clutching it tightly in his own freezing one, “But it’s freezing, and we’re at least a kilometer from home.”
Harry looks at her incredulously. “Hermione you’re literally describing being a friend.”
“What are those?”
The situation is worse than Draco had ever imagined. He is not one to fuck up and say stupid things, yet that’s all that seems to come out of his mouth these days.
Draco reaches up and grabs Harry’s hand from his hair. “It’s like I’m flaunting that I’m with you in their face. It’ll just make them hate me more when I’m wearing one of their family sweaters when I’m not actually a part of the family Harry.”
Ron nods before hesitantly saying, “You’re not going to stop hanging out with me and Hermione now are you? Like, we don’t make you that uncomfortable right?”
Harry’s eyes dart over towards him, and his lips quirk up a little, but he says nothing while listening to whatever George is saying. Draco once again tunes the noise out in favor of rubbing his thumb absently over the back of Harry’s knuckles.
Malfoy shrugs and pushes his clean plate away.
“I think that went well, don’t you?” Malfoy asks, his eyes darting to the side to look at Harry before piling food onto his plate.
“I can’t believe we’re getting our first dinner together at a chip truck.” Draco says, taking Teddy out of Harry’s arms, so Harry can search in the depths of the diaper bag he brought.
At this moment Teddy cries from the other room.
Your comments and kudos make us so happy! Thank you for every single one<3
“Who was that Harry?” Hermione demands, she sounded scared.
As the mother and son whisper quiet greetings to each other, Harry picks out more gray hairs on Narcissa’s head. He notices lines creasing her forehead that weren’t there the last time they spoke. He sees that her hands shake slightly when she pulls Draco in for another long hug.
“Well you’d have some catching up to do. And we’ll have to modify your course load and schedule to reflect the extra year of magic you’ve got. It might be easiest to match your schedule up with Mr. Malfoy’s here.”
“Jesus Granger.” Malfoy gasps, his own hand retreating from his pocket where his wand is stored, “You can’t just sneak up on people like that.”
(See the end of the chapter for
Harry tucks this information away and says, “I’m sorry that happened to you.” He runs his finger along Draco’s cheek, “It should never have happened to you.”
Shocked at the change in topic, but clinging to it desperately he says, “Mcgonagall said I can stay at Hogwarts, so I’m gonna do that.”
He steps forward to grab Draco’s hand but is intercepted by Narcissa. Surprisingly, she pulls him in for a hug, but Harry soon realizes it was an excuse to whisper in his ear, quick and vicious, “You better mean what you said and be prepared to stand with him when the time comes.”
Harry nods into her hair, and lets himself take a breath. His heart is still racing and he can only think of one person who might be able to calm him down.
“It was okay. We went to see my parents in the morning, but we came here yesterday afternoon. It was hard.”
He stomps frustratedly toward the kitchen, and laughing Harry follows. As they enter, bickering, into the kitchen, Malfoy flings the fridge door open and peers inside. No new groceries had materialized since breakfast sadly. Malfoy turns and looks at Harry expectantly.
“I’m doing homework Potter, so if you could piss off that would be fantastic.”
Now Draco is waving his hands animatedly like he sometimes does when he and Ron argue about Quidditch. He’s engaged in some sort of conversation with Pavarti Patil of all people. Harry watches them for another moment before deciding that he’d much prefer having his arms around Draco than be this far away.
Andromeda had sent an owl during dinner to ask the boys if they could watch Teddy for the night, and Harry had happily agreed. They’d taken a risk and apparated to Harry’s apartment. Teddy knew it better, and would be easier to comfort if they had access to all his toys.
She’s already looking at him, “How are you, Harry?”
Harry looks up quickly, relieved. “Hey Ron.”
But after the makeout session, it had been so nice to just lay there, listening to Harry’s heart. And when Harry had finally gotten up from the couch to move to the bed and Draco had tried to reposition himself without Harry’s extra warmth, Harry had grabbed his shirt and sleepily tugged him in the direction of the bed too.
“Well you are the The Boy Who Lived, Potter.” Draco says, breaking his silence but not looking at Harry, “I’m not sure why you’re surprised.”
Almost at the end guys! One more main chapter after this one, and then a short epilogue. We hope you're staying happy and healthy, and appreciate any and all kudos and comments you leave<3
“Oh piss off Harry, you don’t even need to be there if you don’t want to be. Talking to someone who has training to help you after a particularly scarring event is perfectly normal in the muggle world, I’m not sure why you’re kicking up such a fuss.”
“Why are we here Malfoy?”
Harry groans and mumbles something about how much he hates potions and starts digging in his bag.
“Harry you’re in love with Draco Malfoy. Literally everyone can see it. You and Draco seem to be the only ones who don’t know.”
Harry nods once again and pulls himself to his feet. Kreacher has made warm potato soup and informs Harry that he’s working on treacle tart as well for dessert.
“What, you want to room with me now?”
“Hey yourself.” Malfoy says, sliding an arm around Harry’s shoulder.
Draco crawls back into bed and says, “I know you’re awake, Potter.”
As he stumbles around the room, tripping over Malfoy’s discarded socks, Malfoy burrows deeper into his blankets and looks for all intents and purposes like he is never getting out of his bed.
Draco isn’t the type to get a happily ever after love story, and this is the thought that enables him to refuse Harry’s invitation for a nap.
“Ron’ll eat anything Hermione.” he mumbles, not wanting to look at her. “Besides,” he adds much more clearly, “I’m not gay.”
“We can grab some butterbeer and then head back up to the castle. Sound alright, love?”
“It was odd seeing Longbottom and Lovegood in Muggle London wasn’t it?”
Harry shakes his head and says, “Don’t be stupid, I know what it’s like right after an episode like this, I can wait for a bit.”
Mcgonagall nods once before saying, “Alright Potter, you’d better get going or he’ll think you got lost somewhere along the network. I’ve been told it’s happened before.”
“Only for a year.” Rita says quickly, “And I’d be more than happy to talk to you instead Harry dear.”
“Why not?” Harry asks, turning to look at Malfoy.
Harry sighs. He had gotten rather good on not analyzing his emotions, and talking about them was probably his least favourite thing.
Hermione shakes her head sadly, “No, they have pictures of you with Teddy, and shots from what looks like Hogsmead as well.”
Hermione looks at him and replies in a tone that brokers no arguments, “No. I need your help with something and I’d rather not involve Draco or Ron.”
“Fuck.” Draco says, dropping Harry’s hand to lean against the building and press his hands to his eyes, “Shit.”
“Someone had to do it.” Malfoy responds hauntingly.
“Yes Professor.” Malfoy and Harry answer at the same time. Harry looks at Malfoy in a little bit of shock, sure that he would never admitted to wanting to room with him, but Malfoy ignores him.
Harry leans forward to try and catch a glimpse of the gift before having to dodge a lion clad foot that was aimed in his general direction.
Harry takes a seat in a chair opposite to Luna and notes that although it appears to be the wooden seats from Hogwarts, it feels like an old armchair from Gryffindor tower.
Finally, after what seemed like ages, she says, “How is it that you know that Malfoy was pissed about this Harry?”
“I think we need to talk about this, Malfoy.”
While waiting for Harry to get ready Draco allows himself to think about them for another moment.
“What was the whole defending Draco thing about? You and Ron disagree all the time, but I’ve never seen you push back so hard against Ron about a person before, especially Malfoy.”
She looks at him with her wide eyes and calm face and Harry is suddenly very much at ease. He’s comfortable and calm despite knowing that he’s going to have to talk about things that are very uncomfortable and certainly not calming. He thinks it mostly has to do with Luna. When he talks to Hermione she always analyzes the situation. Ron takes ever conversation with bold enthusiasm and teasing. But Luna has always been there to listen.
Maybe it’s the alcohol that’s giving him all this courage, but Harry suspects it actually has more to do with the fact that Draco makes his heart race more than anything else ever has.
“Harry,” Ron’s voice says over the speaker. “Mate, where are you and Malfoy now?”
Malfoy looks at Harry for another moment, his cheeks flushed pink and his hair a mess before kissing him soundly on the lips.
Draco wonders if Kreacher is the one moving the beds closer together in Hogwarts.
Harry thinks he might be fine with the world knowing he loves Malfoy, but only if Malfoy loves him back. He needs to talk to him and figure out what’s going on inside his head.
Luna nods and takes a few steps towards them, “He’s gotten so big!”
He holds his hand out and Draco grabs hold of it and crawls into bed. Harry pushes Draco lightly to get him to lie on his side. He tucks himself up behind Draco and loops his arms around him, holding him close.
Draco snorts, “You’ve given this a fair amount of thought?” He twists his fingers in Harry’s belt loops, looking down at him with a sheepish grin.
He never would have guessed that an infinite amount of soft moments have been stored up in Malfoy for months, just waiting to be used on Harry.
“It’s perfect.” Draco says, planting a kiss on Harry’s neck before leaning back and slipping the chain over his head and gripping the pendant.
Malfoy steps infinitesimally closer, “You could call me Draco. You did last night.”
As he says this he bends at the waist to pick up Teddy. “Has he had breakfast yet?”
After a while, when Harry is almost certain that Malfoy is asleep, and he himself is starting to drift off he says, “I really, really like you Draco.”
“Rons coming to the castle for lunch”
Malfoy laughs and takes a step towards the door.
Harry tilts his head up, just as Draco’s moves his head down, and their lips crash together in the middle. The kiss tastes of cheap beer, and chips, but Harry wouldn’t have it any other way and twists his arms tighter around Draco. Not quite sure if he’ll ever be ready to let go.
Malfoy looks at him consideringly for a moment, before leaning down so that his forehead rests against Harry’s.
“Come on, Potter. Teddy’s asleep and my back is killing me from this torture device you call a couch.”
As Draco says this though, Pavarti, Luna, and a few other girls that Harry doesn’t recognize slip away towards Ginny and George in the corner, leaving Harry and Draco to themselves.
“Oh shut up, Potter.” Malfoy says as he ghosts a kiss across Harry’s hipbone.
Malfoy makes to turn away but Harry’s feeling reckless and loves to prove Malfoy wrong so he grabs Malfoy’s elbow and leans in to whisper in his ear, “I think you’ll find that I can be pretty convincing Malfoy.”
“Oi Malfoy,” he says, throwing a pillow in the blonde’s direction, “Come on we’ve got quidditch tryouts today.”
Harry grins crookedly before leaning in and pressing a quick kiss to the corner of his mouth, “I don’t mind.”
When he reaches the hallway, he dials Blaise’s number. It rings for a while before a groggy voice answers.
When they land in Draco’s dark flat, Harry can see how tense Draco’s shoulders are. He can read the unhappiness in every line of his body, so he steps closer and pulls Draco against him roughly, tucking his face into Draco’s neck.
Malfoy looks at him questioningly before Harry points to Malfoy’s untied trainer. Sighing, Malfoy drops his bag into Harry’s hand, and bends down to tie it. Harry stands in place watching while Hermione responds.
Harry smiles and grabs Teddy quickly, laughing as Draco takes his hand and dashes out the door. Laughing more they lean against the outside of the building and Draco kisses him quickly.
Specifically, his mind is focused on Malfoy who is currently stalking across the pitch towards him with a sneer on his face.
“Alright Malfoy,” Harry says grabbing Malfoy’s hand and bringing it to his lips. “Whatever you say.”
“Oh a fair amount, drinks are on me, but your scones you have to pay for yourself.”
“I said, do you want to come over to Ron and mine’s place tonight, Mrs. Weasley sent us leftovers from whatever big meal she had last.”
Draco sighs and looks up at the ceiling, “At least two months.”
“Malfoy, come on.” Harry says, gently shoving Malfoy’s shoulder and sitting next to him on the bed.
“I don’t think I’ve ever been around a baby for this long.” Malfoy murmurs.
Ron’s voice has a protective edge to it, one that he knew wouldn’t go over well with Hermione. She’s many things, but she isn’t someone who needs to be defended.
“Catch you later Harry, I’ll see you at the reunion in a couple weeks.” Neville says, his eyes hint that there will definitely be more dating interrogation in the future. Regardless, Harry him in for a tight one armed hug.
“Sleep then,” says Harry as he flops onto one of the couches, “I’ll sleep here, I’m not going home this late, I’ll end up splinched.”
Harry grins at Ron across the table and Ron laughs in return. Draco sighs something that sounds suspiciously like “utterly useless,” before taking a long drink from his pint.
Gasping slightly he glares back at Malfoy who just kicked Harry’s ankle in retaliation to the shin kicking, but Malfoy is looking at Mcgonagall as if nothing is wrong. Harry turns back to Mcgonagall, and catches Malfoy smirking out of the corner of his eye.
Harry tries not to look like this is all new information to him and fails spectacularly. Malfoy rolls his eyes at this and reopens his laptop, the fan whirring to life and the screen lighting up. Harry stares for another few minutes before reaching into his bag and propping his own laptop up.
“No peeking, you utter twat.” He says with a smirk.
“Quit worrying, Potter. Everything is fine.”
Draco smiles and kisses Harry softly, and pulls away much too soon. Harry makes a noise of protest and moves to follow Draco, but a hand on his chest stops him.
Harry laughs, thinking that not leaving doesn’t sound like the worst thing in the world, but heads to the kitchen to get food ready, only slightly worried about the fact that he has to figure out both a tattoo and what he’s going to say to a reporter in a few hours.
Ron sits beside her while saying, “They somehow have pictures of you two from more than just St. Mungos.”
“Oh ya and who would that be? The merpeople? Yes, it must be nice to dine with you when they can’t understand anything you’re saying.” Harry laughs through his reply and knows he’s in for it.
Harry groans slightly and hits his head against the table.
“Where’s Teddy?” Harry asks, moving to get up but Draco sets a light hand on his arm and that prompts him to stay seated.
“Yes at your table Malfoy, you looked rather sad without my glowing warm presence next to you.”
“It’s fine Potter, we’ll meet you downstairs.”
He’s warm and real in Harry’s hands. A solid weight in his lap, and Harry wonders how he could have missed this for so long.
“I don’t think that’s entirely my fault.”
The only bright light throughout the week are the brief moments at the end of the day when Malfoy kisses Harry desperately, feverishly, worshipfully. It’s mindless and calming. Everything and nothing. Harry thinks about it constantly.
Harry’s eyes fly wide. “What?”
Malfoy rolls his eyes and shakes his head, before explaining, with the air of talking to someone quite a bit stupider that he is. “Obviously, there are restrictions on when I’m able to use the floo network into the castle. Weekends are only allowed if I ask Mcgonagall first. Besides,” he says turning to look ahead, “I figured a nice leisurely stroll down memory lane is just what you need to convince you to stay in you boring ministry training.”
“You certainly are,” Harry says, propping himself up on one elbow, “We can’t waste every single day of our break in bed.”
“Mother, I’m sure you remember, Potter.” Draco says, calmly twisting his hand together with Harry’s as he does so.
“Better than the beginning of the year-”
“Ideally, yes.” Draco says, “I have a ton of nice clothing that I never get to wear anywhere.”
Startled by Malfoy’s abrupt change in attitude, Harry hurries to pack up his things. On their way out of the library Madam Pince glares in their direction. Harry sighs and sidles up closer to Malfoy’s side.
By T.S Eliot appeals to Harry for some reason. He’s not quite sure what everything means, but he likes the flow of the words.
“Happy new years Draco.”
“There hasn’t been that many to fill them yet.”
Malfoy scoffs, rolls his eyes and then looks back to his paper. Harry watches Malfoy for only a few seconds before Malfoy slams the paper down onto the table, stalks over to the other couch and throws himself into it furiously.
She says it offhandedly, but Harry can tell that yesterday had been incredibly difficult for her and that she had really wanted him there with her. Sometimes it’s hard to be the only non-Weasley in a house full of Weasley’s. He nudges her shoulder gently.
Draco clears his throat and they both whip around to look at him, “Is there anything I can help with?”
After 20 minutes of scouring the aisles looking for things he hopes Malfoy will like, and then battling with the debit machine and a tired looking cashier, Harry gets back to the flat with bagfuls of groceries. Malfoy is still passed out in his bed. He’s changed positions though and is now spread out on his bed like some sort of starfish. Harry shakes his head again, wondering how Malfoy can sleep through Harry’s comings and goings. Harry then sets about the kitchen making a much larger breakfast than is necessary for two people. The clatter of dishes and scent of bacon must have been enough to rouse Malfoy because he stumbles into the kitchen squinting and rubbing his hands across his face and through his hair, last night’s clothes wrinkled on his body.
“I’m almost one hundred percent sure you’re wrong on that, but okay.” Harry shoots back, leaning slightly to get a good grip on the package in front of him.
Harry inspects the lack of food in the fridge and turns to find Draco standing right behind him.
Sighing, Harry pulls away and walks towards the living room. Malfoy lets him go easily, he seems to have let go of his intimidation tactics and now just hopes to pester Harry until he gives him what he wants.
“Shit, Ron do not apparate right this second.” Harry says, stumbling to his feet and lobbing a pair of trackie bottoms in Draco’s general direction, “Draco and I just woke up and aren’t even dressed yet.”
Draco leans slightly into his side, but Harry keeps looking at Narcissa. Finally, she turns her attention away and back to Draco, “Well as long as you’re prepared for his anger when he gets out, I’d say Lucius deserves something to think about.”
He smiles slightly, before turning his head to press a kiss to Malfoy’s neck. Malfoy’s breath hitches, and Harry’s smile widens.
Harry’s heart catches on the words “confess your love,” but he remains speechless, trying to process everything that the girl is saying to him.
“Alright you’ve convinced me to take my education more seriously. Where are you?”
Harry looks at Luna, for a second. Shocked by the abrupt end to the session, and even more surprised that he has to come back once a week.
Malfoy’s hands are cool and a little rough from years on a quidditch broom. He runs his hand through Harry’s hair. It’s a soothing, repetitive gesture which soon has Harry relaxing again and falling asleep.
“I don’t know. I’m not sure I’d be allowed to play, or if anyone would even want me to be on the team.”
Thank you for the positive feedback friends! Hope you enjoy this chapter<3
Harry can practically feel Draco rolling his eyes, but the other boy doesn’t say anything, just twists in Harry’s arms and presses a kiss to his mouth.
Harry’s eyes flit back to Malfoy’s and he feels his cheeks reddening, even though nothing had really been said.
When Harry finally sits down in his old chair in Mcgonagall’s office, all he can focus on is how different Dumbledore and Mcgonagall decorate their offices. Fawkes’ old perch is gone, as is the table of trinkets that Harry had smashed during his fifth year. In the trinkets place is a teapot patterned with smokey gray cats moving across the glass, sitting next to it is what Harry suspects to be a tin full of biscuits. Much to Harry’s amusement there is also a lovely cat perch that Harry thinks Mcgonagall must use when in her feline form. All of these things provide enough distraction that Harry doesn’t have to look at Dumbledore’s picture hanging behind Mcgonagall’s head. His focus is pulled in that direction though when Mcgonagall clears her throat.
Malfoy’s stormy grey eyes are accompanied by a flush high on his cheekbones contrasting against his pale skin. And there’s a light freckle right near his hairline that you can only see if you’re right up close.
She’d tugged on his arm, and led him towards a group of people who Harry assumed were Gryffindor dates, or just friends who’d decided to tag along. Draco had sent Harry one worried look over his shoulder before being swallowed by the crowd.
Harry feels his eyebrows shoot up and can feel Draco’s slight panic without even looking. He steps forward to hug Mrs. Weasley in order to save Draco from having to answer. It works spectacularly before Mrs. Weasley steps back and hugs Draco, saying something Harry doesn’t quite catch into Draco’s ear.
“I’m thinking of coming back to Hogwarts.”
This provides an excellent distraction from the quidditch pitch.
Once inside, Kreacher greets the two boys and informs them that supper is nearly ready, and that he has Teddy’s food prepared. Harry gratefully lets Kreacher take Teddy from him while he shrugs out of his coat and boots.
Malfoy hesitates for a second so Harry pushes him again, and with a gentleness he doesn’t normally direct at Malfoy, removes the hand fisted in his cloak. This time the shove takes and Malfoy hurries out of the hall, though he doesn’t look happy about it, his ears tipped pink in frustration. Harry turns back to Ron just as Hermione shrieks and Ron’s fist makes contact with Harry’s nose.
Harry had agreed at the time and was now spending his time waiting to see Luna by remembering the feeling of Draco’s lips on his and trying to breathe through the panic of having to talk about things that he’d much rather forget or pretend hadn’t happened.
“What are you doing in here?” Harry asks, nudging Draco’s foot gently.
Harry flits his eyes to Malfoy before saying, “I will, but he needs to eat first. It’s almost his bedtime. That’s why he’s so fussy.”
He fiddles with his phone while Teddy plays on the floor with some blocks. He looks at Luna’s contact in his phone and thinks about maybe calling her. He isn’t sure if talking with her will help his nightmares, but he doesn't think it could make them any worse. Before he can make a decision on the matter, he hears movement from the bedroom.
Draco’s resolve is rapidly crumbling. He would like nothing more than to slide under the blankets and snog Harry for a few hours, days, years. But he also knows that Harry doesn’t know what he wants, and if Draco allows himself to get used to this domestic side of the relationship he will be ruined in the end.
“Potter?”
Harry nods and notices the bags under Hermione’s eyes for the first time.
Draco squeezes Harry’s hand and says, “I don’t think it could hurt you anymore than you’re hurting now.”
“I’d rather not tell you.” Harry says simply.
Draco seems to already be almost asleep again, but he twists his hand in Harry’s shirt at Harry’s ‘hello’. Harry goes back to gently brushing his thumb along the skin on Draco’s back. He knows that he and Draco should wake up, get some Christmas shopping done, and decide if they’re gonna speak to the press, but that can wait until later.
“Oh,” scoffs Hermione, finally drawing level with the two boys, “Ya absolutely no one would believe that Draco.”
As a waitress comes over to take their order Malfoy pulls his hand out of Harry’s where they had been grasped on the table. On the one hand, Harry’s is almost glad that Draco pulled his hand away. This is a crowded building with familiar faces, and one of the first things he learned at Hogwarts is that gossip spreads like fiendfyre.
“I couldn’t care less.” Malfoy responds, busily looking into his bag for a book.
As Malfoy lectures him about various lessons in History of Magic, Harry finds his mind drifting. His attention gets snagged by the sun glinting off of Malfoy’s fair hair and putting a glowing ring around his head like a halo. He only realizes he’s staring when Malfoy snaps his fingers in Harry’s face.
He fixes Harry with a perplexed look, and crosses his arms in front of him. Harry looks down and away. He moves towards a bed decked out in an outlandish amount of Gryffindor memorabilia when Malfoy catches his arm.
Harry calls to mind how Malfoy is the only person who has treated him like he always has, most people are either begging for his autograph and swarming him in the streets, or they are insisting there’s no shame in going to therapy. Malfoy has always treated him like any other stupid Gryffindor.
“Draco.” She gasps, running over to her son, ignoring Harry for the time being.
After a bit of stumbling, cursing, and fighting with the tricky latch, Harry makes his way into the bathroom and sits down beside Malfoy.
“What the hell Harry?” Ron yelled. “You have no right-”
Malfoy snorts and says, “Ya right, Potter.”
Finally Hermione breaks the silence. “Should we go to the hospital tonight.”
“This is the real present.” He says, looking somewhat anxiously between the gift and Draco’s face.
Surely enough whispers and hateful conversations are also coming from the Gryffindor table directed towards Malfoy. Malfoy drops Harry’s wrist and they hurry out of the Great Hall and towards Mcgonagall’s office. Harry makes to turn into her old office before realizing that she’s headmistress now. As they make their way through the winding corridors, something settles in Harry. It’s like entering a building and realizing that it’s actually your home that you had left ages before. Everything’s the same, but it’s coated with a layer of dust.
Saying Sirius’ name out loud to Draco so casually feels like splitting open his heart and allowing all his blood to flow out of his body, but it needs to be said.
There’s nothing but silence for a moment, but right before he falls asleep for real he hears, “I like you a lot too, Harry.”
“Weekends I guess?” He says after a minute, not really wanting to miss more school or ask Draco to.
“Great.” Luna says, smiling as she stands up, and gesturing for Harry to follow her.
Malfoy flushes a bit at the question and turns away slightly, “My feet get cold.” And then more confidently, “What’s your excuse for the total abomination that are your pajama pants?”
It’s at this moment that Ginny slides up to the table. She has her coat on and looks about ready to leave, so Harry smiles and waves, but she says, “Harry can I talk to you for a minute?”
“Is that a such a bad thing?” Harry asks, switching gears to calm Draco and reaching for his hand again.
Harry laughs and Draco’s eyes open to watch, “It wasn’t that bad, Draco. Admittedly, I could have gone without jerk-face Sallow coming along at the end, but it’s been a good night.”
Sighing, Draco twists in Harry’s arms so that they’re facing each other and brushes a lock of Harry’s hair out of his face, “How much have you had to drink?”
He starts to panic, somehow knowing that what’s coming will be so much worse that what he’s already experienced. He kicks desperately, but finds that his body is incapable of movement.
“Because it will undoubtedly make you hate me, and I rather like having you around.”
Harry feels the pendant on his chain heating up under his sweater, and looks back to see Draco clutching it ferociously, with a cool look on his face as a reporter shoves a camera in his face. Harry yanks his arm, which causes Draco to stumble a couple of steps before drawing level with Harry.
“So, are you gonna try out for the Quidditch team?” he says in between mouthfuls of salad, “I saw you in class, staring at the pitch like it was the prettiest girl at the Yule ball.”
Both boys look up. Harry, with some effort, focuses on the person standing at the end of their table. He must have had more wine than he thought. Draco stiffens imperceptibly and all remnants of his loose smile are gone. Instead his cold facade is back in place, unruffled and uncaring. He moves to take his hand out of Harry’s grasp, but Harry holds on tighter and shoots him a look.
Harry smiles at the realization that Malfoy had been waiting to fill his plate so that he and Harry could eat together. He decides not to mention it.
Draco looks pained, the crease back to between his eyes. Harry smooths it out again before stepping closer and lowering his voice.
Harry can feel the beginnings of a smile on his face, “Do you want me to not be joking?”
Harry hears him say those words, but his mind has already run down the path of seeing Snape die, Lupin transform, Sirius getting injured. With a hurclean amount of strength and effort he pulls himself out of his own head and shakily follows Malfoy up the frosty hill.
Malfoy laughs before saying, “You could barely stand the attention for ten minutes how would you have handled dinner?”
Eventually, Draco pulls his hand out of Harry’s and Harry realizes he must be done. His arm is still turned away from Harry.
Malfoy groans slightly and tilts his head back to stare at the ceiling, as if praying for patience, “I suppose Potter, but I warn you I’m going to be miserable to live with.”
“What do you mean Malfoy’s pissed off? He hasn’t been at school with you has he Hermione?”
They spend the rest of the day in bed. They ignore their phones most of the time, Harry going so far as to shut his off completely. Draco turns all his notifications off but rushes to pick up the phone when he sees that Blaise is calling.
Harry leans back against the couch, and grabs hold of Draco’s ankles while waiting for the other boy to hastily tape up the tear in the paper. He rubs circles over the prancing lions and watches the small tree they have sitting on their table sparkle with enchanted icicles.
Harry feels a weight come off his chest and he looks over to George only to see him staring back already. When George finally does speak, his voice sounds hoarse from disuse.
“Hey stranger, have any idea what sort of books Hermione is into lately?” Harry asks Malfoy as he takes a seat next to him.
“We’re gonna miss breakfast if you stay in bed too long, it’s Tuesday so they’ll be serving breakfast sausages, those were always Ron’s favourite.”
It’s the day of the reunion and although Malfoy has reassured Harry that, “Yes I’ll be going, stop nagging me.” Harry still feels Draco’s nerves in his careful hands and sees it in his short temper and the crease between his brows.
Luna nods and they sit in silence for a couple minutes, Harry content to look around the room and be in Luna’s calming presence.
Harry grins and makes a fist in Malfoy’s hair, “Well I guess you thought wrong Malfoy.”
Malfoy looks silently into Harry’s eyes for a few moments before turning his head to rest on Harry’s chest again. Lacing his one hand with Harry’s he says, “Alright, Potter.”
It’s at this moment that Malfoy comes tumbling out of the grate. He catches his balance by grabbing Harry’s arm and keeps it there when he notices Andromeda looking at him.
Harry interjects hotly “If you have floo access, why in the bloody hell are we walking? Hogwarts is so much farther north than London, I’m freezing!”
He had gotten the idea from the coins they’d used for Dumbledore’s army. Of course, the spell would last longer and they couldn’t communicate messages with them, but he was still a little proud of his invention.
Harry smiles and closes his eyes, allowing himself to think that this could be his forever.
Blaise sighs, before saying much more clearly, “What is it Draco?”
Draco tries with all his might to push this imagery down, but it isn’t helped by Harry leaning in closer to Malfoy to say something. He can feel Harry’s breath on his face and curses his pale complexion for the way he can feel his face heating up.
“You wore boxers for the entirety of this serious conversation with your friends, and we didn’t even pick up our clearly torn off clothing from last night before they got here.”
It’s all the same, except the blood splotches that once covered the floor are no longer present. A record plays quietly in the corner, the soft notes of a cello ring throughout the room.
He glances once more at the sleeping form of Draco, and decides that he’ll likely sleep through the owls coming and going, before getting up and opening the window.
“You look amazing.” Harry says, stepping closer to ghost a kiss across his mouth before turning to the wardrobe and pulling out the grey sweater Draco had worn to dinner the other night.
“Seriously Potter, you can go I’m just going to sleep.”
Narcissa has not changed much since the last time Harry saw her. She still dresses herself in the same dark green dresses which compliment her tall figure and emphasize her small waist. She holds herself with the same confidence and air that comes with being raised a pureblood and knowing that people stare when you walk into a room. When she hugs her son Harry can point out their resemblance, the same pointed chin and pale skin, the same high cheekbones. Yet, he also notices where they contrast, Malfoy’s long delicate fingers against her rough stout hands. Draco’s grey eyes full of emotion, hers a carefully controlled blue void.
“How’d it go with the Weasley’s?”
“Mhmm. Kiss me more about that.” Malfoy responds, eyes half closed.
“Breakfast Potter. I’ve been up for hours and still haven’t had a cup of tea thanks to your incessant nagging. I’m desperate.”
“It was a joke Draco, I’m just kidding.”
He hasn’t been untouchable in a very long time.
Before opening the door to the outside, they stand looking at one another in the doorway. Draco has a grimace on his face, and the crease is back between his brows. Harry presses the pad of his thumb to it, smoothing it out.
“Hermione,” Harry says, laughing, “You’re off your rocker. Me and Malfoy? No I think-”
As Harry tumbles out of the grate, Andromeda appears and pulls him into a bone crushing hug.
Finally, he says, “Does Ron know you’re at school with him?”
Harry mostly listens in silence, soaking up the fact that he is back at Hogwarts with people he cares about. His mind snags a little on the fact that Malfoy is now someone he cares about, and he catches himself looking at Malfoy as the three of them sit down at the Slytherin table. Malfoy sees him looking and raises a pale eyebrow at him before turning back to talk to Hermione. Harry is about to say something to get Malfoy’s attention again when a shout cuts through the great hall.
Draco squeezes his hand and shakes his head slightly in warning, but Rita is already pulling out a normal quill and looking expectedly at Harry.
“Why hello.” Draco says breathlessly, looking up at Harry with a soft smile on his face.
They have to pause at the door for Harry to find his key, but Malfoy just rolls his eyes and goes to spell the door open.
“Eating breakfast Malfoy.” Harry replies, scooping some eggs onto his plate.
Harry laughs happily. He isn’t sure who leans forward first, all he knows is that suddenly Malfoy’s mouth is on his and it’s good as it always is, but this time it has the added wonderfulness of Harry knowing that Malfoy is his.
Malfoy’s next words are muffled slightly by his pillow, “I don’t give a rat’s ass about Weasley and his breakfast, I’m staying in bed for 20 more minutes, Kreacher will be more than happy to bring me my own goddamn breakfast sausages.”
Harry laughs brightly before saying, “Come off it Malfoy. You honestly think I’m more focused on you than quidditch?”
“Why would you not go with me? Everyone knows we’re together now, and you’re not gonna get shit from any of my friends.”
Before long it’s dinner time. Everyone crowds around in the living room after getting their plate, no table being big enough for the huge number of people in the house. Draco and Harry manage to snag a love seat in the corner and Harry holds Teddy while Draco spoons food into Teddy’s mouth.
Rolling his eyes, he allows Malfoy to whisper some sort of charm over him. He feels blood peel away from his face and also his robes. It hangs, suspended for a moment, in between Malfoy and Harry before Malfoy whispers another charm and the blood is whisked away.
Harry can feel himself blushing and stammers out, “I don’t think so Malfoy. I’ve got a baby to take care of.”
When Harry wakes up the next morning he doesn’t want to open his eyes. It was a dream he knows. A dream prompted by the conversation with Hermione, and nothing more.
“Luna,” He says slowly, looking around, “Where are we?”
Harry isn’t sure what would have happened to him had Andromeda and Teddy not forced their way into his life, but he’s eternally grateful they did.
“Alright mate, you’re on speaker.”
Malfoy mutters something that sounds suspiciously like “You’re telling me” and Harry steps in front of him, casually kicking him in the shins as he does so.
Malfoy’s eyebrows draw together in confusion and his eyes crinkle at the corners, “Why in the bloody hell are Weasel and Granger interested in a lunch date with me?”
The emphasis on the word boy makes Harry dislike this man quite a bit. And he goes to open his mouth to say so when Draco cuts in.
“Blaise,” Draco breathes, silently sliding down the wall, and clutching his phone tighter in his hand.
“You know like what.” Draco says, moving to step out of Harry’s reach and turn to the wardrobe in search of clothing.
When Harry enters the room, Draco shoves a bundle of what appears to be Draco’s jumper and a pair of sweatpants into his chest, and gently shoves Harry in the direction of the bathroom.
Rita looks vaguely disappointed by the contents of her statement and says, “Well that was a waste of parchment Harry. Why don’t you tell us why you’re out with the Death Eater's most beloved son?”
“Umm there are quite a few things to be honest!” His eyebrows have darted up in a confused manner, ever fantasy Harry had about him and Malfoy being accepted without consequence has been shattered.
Malfoy rolls his eyes and snorts. “I despise you Potter, I’m not sure what you’re talking about.”
“Potter,” Malfoy sneers, his fine brows tugging together at the centre “What the hell are you doing here?”
Harry hesitates before answering, not really sure if he’s ready to talk. But then, images of grey eyes swim in his mind and the ghost of strong arms wrapped around him spur him onwards. He may not want to do this for him, but he will do it for Draco and everyone else he cares about.
He hurriedly crosses the room to turn the alarm off and then turns back to see a semi conscious Draco, practically falling out of the bed.
Draco sincerely doubts that but has to take Harry’s word for it as Hermione sweeps them both up into a hug and Ron makes a show of hugging Harry and shaking Draco’s hand.
Malfoy’s eyes dart down to Harry’s lips before slowly making their way up to his eyes again, a smirk playing at his mouth. Harry feels himself swallow and breaks eye contact.
“Yes actually, a troll has better manners than you.”
Wordlessly, Fleur floats a peeler over in his direction.
“My bags.” Harry says, heading to the bedroom to grab his things.
“Right.” Hermione says, still looking at Harry’s hand. “Draco, you and Ron can head down to the hall, I just need Harry’s help with something and then we’ll meet you there.” She accompanies this with a thin smile that does nothing to reassure Harry that everything is alright.
“I can ask Kreacher to come and make us some food.” Harry says as he watches Draco wrestle Teddy into his highchair and dump a handful of cheerios onto the tray.
Harry’s eyes lock with Draco’s at that, he hadn’t known Malfoy had talked to anyone, he’d just assumed he was good at putting the past behind him. But how stupid is he to think that you can live in the same house as Voldemort and just put it behind you?
“I just can’t believe you.”
A very disheveled Draco Malfoy is standing in his kitchen, tie loosened around his neck, hair looking like it’s been tugged and pulled. It’s an entertaining sight.
A month passes with no release of the photos from the hospital. Pansy informs Draco that she hasn’t even heard whispers about them. While Draco seems slightly comforted by this, it only serves to make Harry more paranoid. But with Christmas coming, he has other things that warrant his attention. Namely, projects and tests that various professors want done before break.

“I resent that statement.”
“Ron and Hermione are here and want to have lunch with us apparently.”
Harry breathes a sigh of relief. Luna is going to act as if this situation is completely normal and Harry couldn't be more glad.
Draco continues eating, “I said what I said, Potter.”
Dean snorts, “You’ve got that right.”
Hope you're enjoying this friends! I appreciate any and all kudos and comments so thanks a bunch<3
“I’m only teasing you. And stop calling me Malfoy.”
“Did you boys have to go past the reporters in the garden?”
There’s silence on the line for what seems like an eternity but in reality is probably only a few seconds that Ron takes to process what was just said.
“I know what a grocery store is Potter, I just don’t have a desire to cook for myself. I’m also at Hogwarts for five days of the week and can get by on coffee and biscuits on the weekend.”
Harry chuckles a little and rubs the back of his head, “Sorry, I know. I hate being asked that too.”
“I just-” She starts, flipping her hair over her shoulder, fidgeting to waste time, “I just wanted to say I’m sorry.”
As predicted she jumps and reaches for her wand, but relaxes when she sees it was Harry.
Harry would have stayed there all night had Teddy not started crying.
She lets the sentence trail off and Harry understands that what she’s saying is that she really could have gone without him showing up unannounced. He decides to not beat around the bush.
He hastily puts his phone in his pocket and slides onto the floor beside Teddy. He doesn’t want to worry Draco any more than that nightmare probably has, so he tries to look as unruffled and calm as ever.
“Sure.” He says, realizing that he doesn’t really have much of a choice if he wants to get better.
At the beginning of the year Harry was lost. Tired of going through the motions, tired of being Harry Potter. But the last few months have proven to be entirely worthwhile. He’s started working through his nightmares, an agonizing process that will undoubtedly be helpful in the end. He’s back at Hogwarts for one final year, and he thankfully isn’t dodging death eaters and snakes while he's at it. And to top it all off he’s got one fine looking Slytherin by his side for it all, someone who Harry is glad he gets to call the love of his life, Draco Malfoy. He’s proved to himself that maybe being Harry isn’t so bad after all.
“Harry dear, I’m sure you-”
“Okay.” Harry says again, kissing Draco’s cheek as he goes to find Teddy. “Make yourself pretty.”
Suddenly the dream switches.
“It’s fucking freezing out. Whose idea was this?” Harry mutters, pressing his cold nose into Draco’s neck.
He’s struggling the most with Draco, Andromeda and Teddy. Teddy is only difficult because Harry wants to get him something, namely a broom. But, he doesn’t want Andromeda to think he’s an irresponsible godfather, so he makes a note to run it by her first.
“I do hate you.” Malfoy reminds him before kissing him soundly on the mouth.
Harry’s mind goes blissfully, wondrously, perfectly blank.
When they get to the top Malfoy looks over at Harry expectantly, as if waiting for a laugh or smile. Harry is too deep in his memories though. And although the events of the year before should have been at the forefront of his mind, the memories that present themselves more clearly are the ones from third year. He remembers Ron’s broken leg, him standing wobbly on it when he thought Sirius would try to kill Harry. He remembers Sirius’s laugh when it was revealed that Peter had really been the on to betray Lily and James. He remembers Hermione’s shaky voice when she realized they had attacked Snape. But mostly, he remembers the feeling when Sirius asked him to come live with him. Desperately Harry wishes he could live in that moment again. He misses Sirius with an all encompassing sort of grief. For a moment his thoughts turn to Dumbledore and how he had let so many awful things happen to Sirius before helping him. The old anger rears its head, and for a moment he would like nothing more than to destroy something. Abruptly, he’s shaken out of those thoughts when Malfoy’s hand comes down on his arm and squeezes.
“We can’t all coast by in life on fame you know, it’s potions homework.”
Harry waits for a second, debating whether or not he should say anything. He’s used to telling people about his nightmares but not since the war ended. But Draco’s looking at him with steady grey eyes, and his knees are pressed unhesitatingly into his thighs. He hadn’t even blinked last night when Harry had pointed his wand at him. Harry realizes that Draco may be strong enough to listen to this without being crushed under the weight, but he wonders if it’s fair to expect him to.
Malfoy nods and clambers to his feet.
“Okay, I’ll just be a few minutes. We should probably shower before leaving the flat too.” Draco says over his shoulder as Harry leaves the room.
“I’m glad I have you too.” Draco mumbles, pulling Harry closer.
Dully he notes that his cell phone is ringing. It’s set to some new single from the Weird Sisters that Harry usually finds quite enjoyable, but right now just leaves him feeling annoyed. With movements that seemed slightly separated from his body, he stumbles to his night table where he had left his cell that morning.
“Thanks so much.” Harry says, adding a larger tip to the jar outside of the truck before turning back to Draco and Teddy.
“I just might Malfoy, you don’t know me.”
It dawns on Harry that if Draco is done then it must be his turn to get a tattoo. Contrary to Draco’s belief, he has done some thinking and investigating regarding possible designs, he just hasn’t picked anything specific. He scrambles for what to ask for, knowing that the poor tattoo artist probably hates clients like him.
“What’s the worst?” Harry asks, calmly brushing a stray lock of hair out of Draco’s face.
“Wonder what that was about.” Harry says turning back to his plate.
Being with Draco is not the issue, it’s everyone else that’s the problem.
Harry slumps down onto the floor, Kreacher perching at his side.
Gruffly Ron replies, “And hanging out with the amazing bouncing ferret makes you feel less broken?”
“Everything is gonna be okay, Draco.”
Harry takes a drink before nodding and saying, “Yes. It looks like you’ll be meeting the whole Weasley clan tonight.”
“I was just going to boil water for some tea,” She says stepping away from the chair, “Would you like some?”
“Hello?” He says quietly, trying not to cause his own headache to worsen or wake up Draco.
Harry feels his face heating up and shrugs one shoulder trying to avoid the question, “I don’t remember.”
"Fuck, close your eyes I think the wrappings might have torn." Malfoy scrambles off of Harry's lap and dashes towards his present.
He stretches and groans, nearly clipping Harry in the nose with his fist.
“Shove off, Malfoy! I didn’t say anything.”
Harry smiles despite himself. “It’s good to see you too Kreacher. Do you mind taking me to mine and Malfoy’s room please?”
“Hey baby boy. How are you?” Harry asks holding Teddy slightly above his head.
Now, it’s completely pointless for Harry to attend these training sessions. The instructor had said it himself on the first day of class, chuckling like it was some great joke, that he was Harry Potter. And that meant that he certainly didn’t need to be here.
