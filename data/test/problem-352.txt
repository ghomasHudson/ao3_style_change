It was dark and cold in the tunnel. Draco stumbled. Rough hands were on him immediately, pushing him upright, forcing him to keep moving. “Stop,” he muttered. “
“But how?” Hermione asked. “Is that part of your bond? Or could you do it before? I know you have some skill with Occlumency, but –”
people! I was in the library, but it’s worse here. Everyone’s – I think it happened all at the same time! There’s so many – but Hermione, she saved my life, and Bulstrode, she won’t move, and I think,” she sobbed, losing it entirely, “I think they’re both dead!”
Cardosa held up his wand at Harry’s feet, a drop of blood at the tip. Harry glanced at Rookwood. He held up a small, clear sphere, fogged from the inside. Earth, air, water…
The surprise of it sent a wild surge of pleasure through Draco. Such a declaration couldn’t be conclusive, of course. But there was an enormous amount of satisfaction in hearing it said aloud in the presence of witnesses. The
The terror she’d felt upon waking was indescribable. Harry had been right, all along. Snape was a traitor. He was going to join the Death Eaters, and no one would think to watch their back against him, a man Dumbledore
powerful,” he said quickly, determined to save Draco, even if it was too late for him. “But we’re powerful because we share our magic, and he’s just not satisfying me anymore. He’s not strong enough to force me to submit. I need another Alpha. I need
She stepped out of the classroom well after the last student, and was pleased to see both Seamus Finnigan and Blaise Zabini loitering in the hallway outside. They were the main rivals for her attention; the two who had persisted the longest in pursuing her, despite her many rejections.
They settled under the great beech tree by the lake, Hermione Transfiguring a leaf into a blanket before they sat down.
“And we didn’t die,” Draco said. He levelled a glare at Harry. “No thanks to the Boy Who Lived, of course, who made a bloody good go at it.”
She’d read the history books, of course, and wheedled stories from some of the older Order members. Guerrilla attacks on innocent civilians, just like Justin's family. People who had gone out, never to be seen or heard from again. Safe houses, and bloody battlefields, with hundreds upon hundreds dead. The Inferi, striking terror into the hearts of all men. The dreadful fear that your friend, or family member, or colleague could be under
But Draco just kissed the deep, purple bruise and lined himself up, pushing in gently. Harry cried out, fingers digging into Draco’s shoulders, the pleasure-pain of it unprecedented. Draco
He whirled. Ron was running towards them, panic written all over his face. He held up his wrist, where a small bracelet was blinking. “Hermione’s alarm just went off! They’re coming through the fourth floor passage! We have to –”
She was surprised at how well he was taking it, especially given the raised eyebrows it had caused in Slytherin. Then again, Draco had been ruled by what other people thought of him for far too long. It was about time he threw off that debilitating fear and started living life for himself.
“Oh, my darling,” Narcissa said. “My darling, foolish dragon. The heart is the most powerful muscle in the body. Resisting it doesn’t make you strong, but allowing it to
Harry smiled, all too well aware that if he let him, Draco would go right back to sleep. “I think breakfast has come and gone, though,” he said, pointedly, “and I am
Daphne sighed. “Dear Theo,” she agreed. “I don’t know if he’ll ever work up the courage to actually declare himself.”
“Good,” she said, smiling. “You should know that Draco has said as much to me, about you. I don’t know how much you know about pureblood values, having grown up outside our world, but family always comes first for us. You are his family now, Harry. Which makes you my family, as well.”
Draco heaved a melodramatic sigh. “I know. But we can always have sex later.” Harry looked bewildered, and he stifled a smile. “The book and the watch are perfect, and I am seriously considering moving you into my room so you can wake me up like you did today every morning. But you forgot my
“I –” Harry looked around, confused. It seemed like only a moment ago that the Great Hall had been just over half-full. Now there were only a few students left, lingering over their desserts. Even Ron and Hermione had disappeared.
Hermione hurried through the doors to the Great Hall at lunch, struggling to hold onto her stack of party invitations, as well as a backpack overflowing with textbooks and homework. She collapsed at the Gryffindor table, letting the backpack drop with a groan of relief. “I didn’t realise planning a party would be so much work,” she complained.
Ron choked, and Draco’s surprised expression turned into a smirk. “Oh? Careful, Granger. Unless, of course, you
Harry blinked at her. “Bloody hell, no, you won’t,” he said, firmly. “I’m not like that. I’m not a Dark Lord, and I’m definitely not a hero. I’m just Harry Potter.”
“And yet you still don’t know whether Draco will even accept Potter’s offer,” Blaise mused. “You put a lot of faith in Potter’s ability to lie, dearest Pansy.”
“During which Harry will be in his detention,” Draco said, frowning slightly. It didn’t seem right, really, that Potter should be forced to miss the match of the year simply because he’d treated Draco to a night of romance.
Seamus shook his head. “He trusts you, Harry! He has no reason to trust Dumbledore! Why should he? And you’re going to just let all that go to waste?”
mean it. But a warm glow was already spreading through him. “Don’t be ridiculous,” he tried to scoff. “You love the attention.”
He turned his face up for a kiss, instead, and Draco granted it to him, sweet and gentle and mingled with sorrow. Giving and accepting comfort, and as much as Harry loved the way Draco took him down into submission so easily, he loved this, too. Just being with each other, sharing something that no one else ever would, or could; belonging to each other in a way that had nothing to do with ownership or some stupid, fucked-up excuse for Omega law.
Harry stared, a bit. The bright purple hair was back, streaked with a bold pink, and her grin almost split her face.
Sure enough, he felt Draco smile against his shoulder a moment later, and he closed his eyes, revelling in it.
No one suggested he return to the Dursleys for what remained of the holidays. Of course not. He was free, now. He was so relieved at the realisation that he vomited into the toilet, twice, and then laughed for five minutes straight. He was crying by the end of it, for the first time since he’d woken up after the battle, but he felt much better afterwards.
That Harry didn’t feel attractive blew Draco’s mind. That smile, he thought with a frustrated shake of his head. Has the idiot never looked in a mirror? Any fool can see how gorgeous he is.
In a whirl of motion Harry had Draco pressed against the door where he had been resting a scant second ago. He pressed his body up against Draco’s, who gasped at the feel of the hard length against him. Harry kissed Draco roughly, full of teeth and lips and soft groans. It wasn’t until Draco relaxed in his arms and grabbed his arse with both hands that Harry let go and stepped back, panting. “I suppose I’ll see you at ten then.” He grinned cheekily up at Draco.
Really? Because people who hate me don’t often agree to a date with me. You can’t get out of it. See you tomorrow.
Harry chuckled lightly. “You take such good care of me,” and the tell-tale blush of embarrassment rose high onto his cheeks as he returned his hand to his drink after a light squeeze to Draco’s. Draco’s mind raced. He could feel the warm press of Harry’s leg alongside his and marvelled at it. Who would have thought that Harry bloody Potter would ever be willing to be this close to Draco Malfoy?
Malfoy, Blaise is looking for you for lunch. Apparently he ‘tried to silence his phone’ with magic. I’m not your personal errand boy, can you please go to your office to meet him? He keeps talking to me and I have shit to do.
He was astonished when Harry turned bright red and muttered, “bathroom!” before speeding quickly out of the smoking area and down the stairs.
“Very mature of you, Draco.” Blaise shot Pansy a look that clearly said ‘mind your own business,’ and changed the topic of conversation to something he clearly considered less controversial.
“Of course,” Draco agreed. He adjusted his sitting position. “Now, even for me, this is an extended period of being on my knees.” He cracked a cheeky smirk. “So how about this? Grab your clothes for tonight and come over. We can pretend to be girls and get ready together. Have a nice dinner and I’ll sort out the bird's nest you call your hair.”
Draco strolled up beside him, his right arm lightly brushing against Harry’s left. A tingle was left where they touched. “Yes,” he began, “it was typically used when the Malfoy’s were in danger. If they were unable to used magic to leave the property they would enter the maze. If you were not a Malfoy, or invited in, then you would be trapped wandering in the maze.” He pointed to the right of the maze to a bright, colourful garden area. “Those are Mother’s roses,” he began. “Before, well, everything, she would be out among them all day.” His voice dropped. “She used to talk to them, and said that was the secret to their beauty. The colours were brighter, scent was stronger and so on.”
Not with magic, Malfoy, with the button on the edge - volume control. And for the record, it's now 1am. Go to bed! If you need something, message Blaise. He's the idiot who taught you how to a text, he can deal with you.
Harry, still laughing, nodded. “Sorry, I just got the visual of you jumping on a bed and having a pillow fight and it’s hysterical.”
Several drinks later, the group had scattered around the club - Sal, Russ and Jase had moved to the upstairs room which played an ‘old school mix’ of both muggle and Wizarding music. Tony had dragged Harry and Mitch to the middle of the dance floor near their table with Draco’s promise he would join them after checking out the upper room.
“Sorry.” Ron flushed and smiled back. Almost shyly, Draco thought. “Malfoy, Hermione suggested you go and comfort Harry because he’s freaking out about your whatever tonight.”
Harry looked nervous. “I’m not a great side-along passenger,” he explained. “It’s not that I don’t trust you - I do,” he assured Draco. “I’ve just had a few bad experiences.”
“Hmmm,” Blaise hummed thoughtfully. “Of course.” He helped himself to another croissant. “So did the two of you talk, or was it all fashion related?”
Draco stepped up to sit on the bar stool next to Harry. “Anyone I know?” he asked, tilting his head in question.
“You alright, Dray?” Mitch nudged Draco’s shoulder as the group continued to meander towards their usual bar.
Harry preened under Draco’s praise and released the bundle of clothing into the arms of a house elf that Draco had called. “May as well pop them in my room, Pippin,” he drawled. Had he been paying proper attention to his guest, he would have seen Harry’s breath catch and a small smile form on his lips.
“I think it is,” Harry mused aloud. “Your face hasn’t done that blank thing it usually does.” He wrinkled his nose at Draco to soften the potential insult. “I’m honoured, Draco, really. I want you to be comfortable around me,” he said gently.
Draco found his usual stoic persona was worn down by Harry’s infectious laughter and he was talking much more than usual - if it were anyone but him, he might even say babbling. In return, Harry had lit up and was throwing in the odd snarky comment. Draco was sure he’d never laughed so freely or genuinely in his life.
Ron flushed and averted his eyes. “They may have, but I possibly forgot.” He took a large bite of his croissant, finishing the majority of it in a swift move. He chewed and swallowed before getting to his point. “I’m here because Hermione sent me.”
Draco could feel himself begin to smile. He was touched that Harry had not only been paying enough attention to know what Draco had liked him wearing, but was making an effort to wear something he knew Draco would like.
Draco stumbled, catching himself before he hit the floor. “What? What do you mean? I don’t know what you’re talking about!” He took a second to pull on the old Malfoy reserve. “He’s a friend.”
Having flooed home immediately from Zabini Manor, Draco strode quickly to a mirror in the adjacent hallway and checked his reflection. Seeing his hair neatly in place, he returned to the floo to call Harry.
Draco didn't look up from the newspaper. “Didn’t we talk about this already?” he said irritably. “It went well, Pansy. He behaved and I made him look astonishingly unlike his usual self.” He shrugged. “As was expected.” He turned a page.
Draco spent the next hour ensuring Harry didn’t get a moment to think. He was sure that what was happening in his bedroom was reminiscent of teenage girls going to a nightclub for the first time- there were piles of clothes on the floor, the sound of hysterical giggling and the occasional shriek. There had been a minor tussle over the eyeliner, with Draco, of course, victorious. He positioned Harry on the bed and leant over him, one knee between Harry’s now denim-clad legs. He held the brunette’s face still with one hand and dragged out the drawing of the line as long as he could, enjoying the feeling of Harry’s breath on his skin and the tingle on his fingers where they touched the other man’s chin.
He found Harry dancing with the rest of the men towards the back of the dance floor, Harry smiling but looking tense and lost in thought when he thought no one was looking. As Draco watched, Mitch slung his arm around Harry’s neck and pulled him close. Draco slowed, his confidence waning slightly. What if Harry had been talking about Mitch earlier? As he watched, Harry smiled gently at Mitch and shook his head stepping out from under his arm. Mitch turned to dance with a stranger who was trying to pass by.
“No, but I am,” Draco sighed. “I thought I’d be able to manage this. We have only recently started to get along after school. I always thought he was attractive, but straight. And suddenly he was bent and needy and then I got to know him even more and he’s even more attractive.” He leant against the nearby wall. He turned eyes conflicted with emotion to Troy. “What am I meant to do? I’m meant to be showing him how to meet blokes, not hit on him.”
Draco was spending a lovely morning at Zabini Manor. Every second Saturday he could be found there with Pansy and Blaise, partaking in a relaxed brunch. Today the table on the balcony had been set, and Draco tilted his head up to allow the sun to shine warmly on his face. Pansy was chattering away about the latest gossip she had heard over the counter where she worked; florists heard a remarkable amount of gossip and they spread even more, and they always knew which wizard needed to buy his wife or mistress a bunch of flowers to make up for a transgression.
Harry cocked his head to the side with a questioning frown. “So I don’t embarrass you? Anything I should know about your friends? Rules about the place we’re going to?”
He shot the security guard a quick smile and the group was waved through. “Table’s waiting, Mr Malfoy,” the man nodded respectfully. “Look for the yellow sparks.”
The music was already loud and the rumble of the other patrons lent itself to the buzz of the bar. It wasn’t overly late - early enough to be able to walk around without having to push past people, but late enough that the atmosphere was electric.
Draco renewed his path towards Harry, who upon seeing him coming, stood straighter and his face brightened into a welcoming smile.
From the corner of his eye, Draco watched Blaise very carefully not look at Pansy, his lips twitching. In contrast, his voice was very serious when he asked: “So who will provide that guidance, Draco? You’re a very busy man, so I assume-”
Draco raised an eyebrow. “I would have assumed Blaise and Pansy would have warned you I’d be here this morning.”
Harry turned away from the floo so that Draco couldn’t see his face. Draco noted the tense set of his shoulders and rapid breathing and softened his voice. “Potter, it’s okay. I’m not going to make you do anything awful. If you want to pull the plug, we can just have a nice dinner at the manor and you can show me that muggle movie you were telling me about.” He looked earnestly as he could through the flames. “My intent is not to go out of our way to out or upset you. I really just want you to meet some friends of mine.”
“And is that,” Pansy paused as though looking for the right way to word her thoughts, “guidance going to be, uh, hands on?” She was swirling her mimosa around the champagne glass now, frowning slightly at Draco.
Well that was enlightening. You disappeared before I could thank you properly. I really appreciate it, Malfoy. Enjoy dinner with Parkinson.
Not feeling well so stayed home. Didn't want to infect you with the plague I'm currently experiencing.
Harry paused, face suddenly serious in the pulsing light of the club. “Let me take you out for breakfast tomorrow,” he said.
Draco took a step towards Harry, with eyes dark with arousal. Harry darted around him and slammed the door behind himself. “See you in the morning!” came Harry’s singsong voice. Draco thudded his head on the door and sighed. “Don’t be late!” he barked back.
“All right then, Potter,” he summoned a smile. “Time to get going.” He turned and pretended to search his room for his jacket.
Ron, who was leaning over the table to get to the last pastry while using the time to make eyes at Pansy continued, “right, yes, well Hermione had a message for you. I don’t know why she couldn’t deliver it but I think she was just trying to get rid of me because Theo was either coming round or already there and--”
“Draco,” Harry’s voice was breathy. “Your jacket is still in the bathroom. You took it in when you got changed.”
“Secondly,” Draco continued, “I was subjected to the horror of Ron Weasley at brunch this morning. Apparently Granger said you were having some sort of emotional breakdown and I was required.”
The conversation lulled and the trio returned to their drinks and last remnants of food. Draco very nearly fell out of his chair at the sudden grumble of “there you are!” coming from behind him. The Zabini wards hadn’t chimed, so this person was keyed in to come and go as they wished, and, as far as Draco knew, only the three people partaking in today’s brunch were able to do so.
Upon seeing the delighted looks on Blaise and Pansy’s faces, Draco subtly put his wand back into his holster and turned to see the unexpected arrival.
“Firstly, I can see you doing that strange hand-wringing thing you do when you’re panicking,” Draco began.
He moved to the basin, staring at his reflection for a brief minute before splashing his face and taking a deep breath and schooling his features into their usual impassive facade.
Troy rolled his eyes and pulled his mobile phone out of his back pocket. “Just wait a sec,” he ordered and turned away, muttering into the phone. He turned back around and handed the phone to Draco. “It’s for you,” he smirked.
It was with that promise in mind that Draco was searching the lower floor for Harry. Unable to locate the group on the dance floor, he checked the bathrooms and on a whim made his way to the smoking area on the roof. As he exited, pulling a cigarette out of seemingly nowhere, he caught sight of messy hair up ahead. He smirked and made his way to his friends, lighting up the cigarette as he went. Harry’s hands were waving as he intently spoke to his new friends, who were smiling at his drunken rambling. “-because he’s so pretty and he’s always been so pretty and snarky and I’ve always wanted him.”
Harry’s breath was hot against Draco’s skin and his eyes remained closed after Draco finished the perfect smudge of the eyeliner. Draco was sure that Harry hadn’t noticed how his fingers had lingered on his chin, stroking down before dropping away. Catching himself still staring, Draco backed away slowly. “Eyes open, Potter,” he demanded.
He ordered and levitated the large tray of drinks gracefully back to the table. He took each drink from the tray and presented it to its owner: “Japanese Slipper for Mitch.” The drink skidded across the table. “Espresso Martini for Jase,” the glass was caught in one hand as Jase continued his conversation across the table with Russ, who almost missed the Pale Ale which came sliding towards him. Two sparkling wines went to Sal and Tony, and a Firewhiskey to Harry. Draco took his glass of wine and slid into the booth next to Harry, sending the tray flying back to the bar, high above the heads of those milling around.
Draco closed the door behind him and leant his head against it. He’s not attractive. You are not his type. That is a bad, bad idea.
A voice broke through the tense moment, and Harry’s eyes flew open. They were standing in a well-lit alley, with people Apparating in and out around them. Draco stepped back quickly from Harry, dropping his arms to his sides and moving his gaze from Harry’s lips to his eyes. He held eye contact with Harry for a moment before turning to face the direction the voice came from.
doubt that – but he’d been quiet for a long time, now. Off, somehow. Since Malfoy Manor, Harry realised now, and while he’d attributed it at the time to the horror and stress of the war, he wondered what that meant for them now. Especially if he could no longer go into heat.
On the other hand, he also couldn’t forget the Mirror of Infinity. Every choice he made, every path he took, either led him towards or away from a future where they were happy. He
He visited Diagon Alley, next. Arthur had recommended a jeweller to him, and he requested an exact replica of the watch he'd made Draco for his birthday. He brought along the battered old Weasley Pensieve, and although the proprietor looked a little alarmed by the numerous cracks in it, his eagerness to help the Boy Who Lived Twice outweighed his nerves.
Trelawney ended on a breathless whisper, and took several, dramatic steps back, before turning and floating away.
Potter gave him an odd smile, but didn’t comment on the omission. Draco was grateful for it. He’d much rather talk about whatever-it-was between them than his allegiance to the Dark Lord. “What do you call our date in Hogsmeade, then?”
you!” She threw down her fork and stormed away, leaving Harry to stare after her in bewilderment, thinking that, all in all, he was very glad he caught the Snitch for the other team, so to speak.
When she left the courtroom, Robards turned and bowed to the panel of judges. “The prosecution rests, Minster.”
are, of course, Madam Umbridge. My name is Charlie Weasley. No doubt you see the resemblance. That’s our mother you have there.
–?” He almost laughed, but the look in Malfoy’s eyes stopped him. His hands clenched into fists. “How can you want this?” he demanded. “You had the opportunity to back out. You didn’t have to come to the infirmary. You
“In an attempt to convince me to let you walk to your death, yes,” Draco said. “In which endeavour, naturally, he was unsuccessful. He is manipulating people and events to make sure it goes the way
, now that he’d finally realised just how long he’d been in love with Draco (since the very first time he’d said it, he thought now), he could never tell him.
“Well,” Hermione pursed her lips. “All right, then. I’ll leave that up to you. We can arrange the food – we’ve got friends among the house-elves who will help us.”
Harry snorted, recognising the reference. “Right, of course. ‘The meaning of life, the universe and everything’ is an Arithmancy sum.”
Draco looked thoughtful. “Interesting question,” he said. “What matters, I mean, to me. Do you really want to know?”
“No,” Draco said, louder. “No, I think your friends deserve to know that you don’t, actually, ‘tell them everything’. You’re lying to them now, if only by omission. They don’t know you’re a Horcrux, do they? They don’t know you intend to
“You know I love your father,” she said, simply, “but a five-year-old is not a man. I couldn’t give it back to you then, but now you are a man, I thought it appropriate.”
Draco swore at him, but he relaxed into it reluctantly, and Harry rewarded him with a deeper kiss and a little more friction. When Draco came, long minutes later, he was almost boneless, and Harry wasn’t surprised to see his eyes closed, lashes brushing his flushed cheeks.
Draco, however, was as tense as a centaur whose territory was being invaded. “You won’t take him from me,” he said, almost snapping the words out, whip-sharp and desperate. “He’s
“So spend your last hours doing good, my boy,” Dumbledore recommended, “that you may face Lily Potter in the afterlife with a clear conscience.” Severus flinched, hard, and Dumbledore was satisfied that his point had been made. “Go to Hogwarts,” he said. “If he takes the Ministry, he’ll go after the school next. They’ll need you.”
“Fine,” Blaise said, yawning pointedly. “What a bunch of bloody bores we’ve become, now we’re on the side of the righteous.
. I just can’t help thinking, if you hadn’t remembered about the bezoar...” She bit her lip. “I know it wasn’t Dumbledore’s fault. We didn’t believe you, either. But we can’t let something worse happen, now we know. We just
“Well, Dumbledore was in with Ollivander and Mr Fortescue for hours… Oh, did you hear? We rescued them too.” Harry shook his head. “Oh. Yeah. They were in the dungeons with Malfoy’s mam. The Ministry took them in for questioning. Last I heard, a safe house was being set up for them, just in case, but Dumbledore thinks they’ll be fine. He thinks You-Know-Who already got the information he needed out of them. He was just keeping them to make sure they didn’t tell us what they told him, if that makes sense. Oh, and Flitwick’s still in the infirmary. He’s the last of ours still laid up. Even Daphne and Neville are up and about now, but Bellatrix tortured Flitwick under the Cruciatus Curse, and Madam Pomfrey says the sustained torture might have caused lasting damage.”
He felt his lips pull into a semblance of a smile, but it couldn’t hold. He was far too tired. Even taking the last, remaining steps to the bed seemed like a mammoth task. He didn’t think he could handle a heart-to-heart with his best friend as well.
choosing to defect?” Professor Lupin said. “Even though you – Goyle, Crabbe, Nott – your fathers are all in the inner circle? Miss Greengrass, I’ve heard reports that your parents have pledged their loyalty to You-Know-Who again. And Miss Bulstrode, wasn’t your cousin killed by an Order member in the last war?”
Harry hesitated when they reached the wall that hid the Room of Requirement. He’d worked so hard on this, all afternoon, missing all his classes, and he just knew there would be hell to pay with Snape for skipping double DADA.
me!” He snorted. “Fuck’s sake, Pansy! He’s not in love with me, you hopeless romantic. This is what comes of bedding Gryffindors and Hufflepuffs. I did warn you.”
Almost everyone left standing was forced to retreat. Davis and Jenkins ended up on the roof, using the hole in the ceiling to shoot down at the enemy from above. Everyone else barricaded themselves in the hallway leading to the infirmary.
“… curses that attach themselves to their victim’s core of magic, draining them like leeches,” Draco said, some time later. Harry startled awake. “Horcruxes are far more powerful than most curses, of course, but it may help us understand better what it’s doing to you, and how we can destroy it. Or even,” he said, thoughtfully, “remove it, and
Dumbledore bowed his head. The day he had been expecting for so long had come, and he was just so tired. This was not his battle. He had never been meant to face this moment.
. Six weeks until the end of term. Six weeks until any hope of fulfilling his task and saving his mother was dead and gone. Six weeks until his own, gruesome death.
Harry wanted to ask how, exactly, what Draco had been doing in The Three Broomsticks was at all relevant to the trial, but the reporters were eagerly scribbling in their notebooks, and Hermione was up in arms, bristling in their defence. Harry suspected she knew where Robards was going with this line of questioning, and she clearly didn’t like it. “Actually, it
“Draco, is it?” she sneered. A group of others, mostly seventh years, stepped in behind her, blocking his way. “And what did you want with
Dumbledore’s face was sympathetic. “I give you my word,” he said. “If he comes to me – or you – before he completes his task, I will give him sanctuary.” He didn’t sound as if he thought that was likely. “In the meantime, I have made a deal with Ms Skeeter. Mutual gain for both parties, eliminating the need for explanation, and guaranteeing her silence. Unfortunately, it requires a sacrifice on your part, Harry.”
It made Harry once again thankful that he’d been so lucky in his own Alpha. Draco could be an idiot sometimes, but he genuinely
Draco dodged it easily enough. Mr Nott was not a natural fighter. He Stunned him, left him there. The dragon-tamer was already pulling Thomas up.
“They have no free will, Potter,” Draco told him. “They exist to serve a purpose only. There’s never been a case of a ‘ganger becoming self-aware enough to plead for its life. They just – live, and then fade.”
Draco flinched, unable to meet Harry’s accusing gaze. “I know. I didn’t want you to know. You were so happy that our bond was equal in that one regard, at least, and then when I realised... I couldn’t tell you.”
But… the Cloak had been one of the only tangible connections he had to his parents. And now it was gone, too.
“Bloody Gryffindor,” Draco said. He let Harry take his weight, legs trembling. “You’re not sorry at all. What did you do?”
she could, and ran, limping. The cage was blocking magic somehow. She had to put it between her and the army.
He claimed it was a case of ‘know thy enemy’, but Pansy wasn’t fooled. He had never had any real contact with the Muggle world, and thus they were a fairytale; not quite real, but entirely, illicitly, captivating.
, suddenly, by intense, blinding hatred. This was what Voldemort did, then. Turned even the most arrogant, self-involved, pureblood bastard into just one of a long line of his victims.
Another murmur, louder this time. Harry sighed. His coming out had been buried amongst the coverage of the trial over the past couple of days, but he had the sinking feeling it would be promoted to front page news, tomorrow. Or tonight, Merlin forbid, if someone decided that it was important enough to warrant a special edition of the Prophet.
Harry nodded. He looked around. Flitwick was still unconscious. Madam Pomfrey and two Healers in St Mungo’s robes were hovering over Daphne. Next to her, Zabini’s body looked to be unnaturally frozen. Ginny was curled up in the chair next to him, snoring softly.
“There may be one way,” Dumbledore told him. “I once read an academic paper which suggested the use of a vacuum to snuff Fiendfyre out. The theory seemed sound, but I’m afraid I don’t know if it was ever tested.”
Draco obviously knew it, too, because he bit down into the dark, painful bruise over Harry's carotid, making Harry whimper softly, and said, “You belong to me, Potter. We
They followed her in silence. The town was quiet, but Pansy noticed several curtains move. A door opened. “You’re from Hogwarts?” a voice called. It was a young woman in her twenties, with pretty blue eyes.
with her when she died. I didn’t even know until – my parents still don’t know! I have to – I have to –” Her voice shook, and she stopped.
proclivity for other boys.” He grabbed Draco between the legs, twisting cruelly. Draco stifled a cry. “Have you betrayed us, Master Malfoy?”
Draco slid another piece of melon between Harry’s lips, effectively quieting him. He followed that up with his fingers, pressing in and exploring Harry’s mouth with a proprietary air of ownership that took Harry’s breath away. His cock made a valiant attempt to harden, but he was utterly spent, so he just lay and watched his Alpha and sucked on the long, graceful fingers when he thought Draco wouldn’t mind.
Hermione braced herself for an outburst, but – “Sorry, ma’am,” Harry said, meekly, and Hermione breathed out in surprise and relief. She realised Malfoy had a hard grip on Harry’s arm.
Shacklebolt sighed. “We can’t blame him for that. His daughter was severely traumatised by her captivity. She needs his care, and it is understandable that he would not want to risk her being used against him again.”
“Draco,” Harry said. He didn’t touch, though Draco could feel his need to do so; to feel for himself that Draco was still alive. There was part of him that wanted to do the same. The bond wasn’t enough, not after Harry had almost died. “It’s enough,” Harry said, very earnestly. “You saved my
Three Death Eaters began to circle him. Rowle, Jackson and a Death Eater with wild eyes and a straggly beard. A werewolf. Fred pulled out another Decoy Detonator, throwing it straight at the werewolf’s face. It exploded. He fired off two Stunners at the others. They dodged, answering with a couple of non-verbal spells of their own.
Harry stood at the window of the DADA classroom, gazing out at the clear, still night. The moon hung heavy on the horizon, white-bright and glowing, its pure, cold brilliance reflected in the quiet water of the lake below.
A giant lumbered over the line, but was caught by a rune in the next row. He bellowed in terror, arms windmilling as he fought unseen enemies. Spinning clumsily, he stampeded back the way he came. Death Eaters threw themselves out of his way, triggering more runes. Three simultaneous explosions, deafeningly loud.
Draco pressed his hands to Harry’s chest, holding him back. His frown deepened. “I want you to tell me what happened in the Great Hall. I lost you for a minute there. Did you call up that storm?”
“Of course I do,” Harry said. “But that’s not why, either. Tell me. Tell me why every inch of you – your body, your heart, your
At his feet, the giant snake reared up. The kelpie froze. Nagini struck. The kelpie didn’t move fast enough. It screamed, thrashing. Nagini slithered around to attack the snakes. They turned tail, disappearing back into the forest. The quoles were braver, darting in and out, slashing tiny wounds along Nagini’s length. She swallowed one whole, and they squeaked, retreating to safety.
Draco smirked and relaxed again, closing his eyes. Strange, to be so secure in the knowledge that Harry Potter had his back, even in a room full of Slytherins. “I like it when you’re jealous,” he murmured.
His mates were already working on the cage. Bill nodded at him, turning back to Fleur. Someone had found a way to get wands into the cage, and there were already several people working on Fleur and their father. Percy –
No. No, he refused to believe that. Not just for his own sake, or the sake of the wizarding world – but for Parkinson and Malfoy and prim and proper little Adeline, and all the other Slytherins who were just children caught up on the wrong side of the war.
Except Malfoy, of course. Harry figured no one really knew Snape’s true loyalties except Snape himself, and perhaps Voldemort, which meant trusting him was not an option for Malfoy. Anyone who attempted to interfere with his task
“Only those with the Dark Mark may touch or pass through uncontested,” Lucius said. “The Dark Lord was very thorough in outlining his wishes. Not death, but a living hell for all who dare to come to Hogwarts’ aid. None of you will get in this way.”
Dawlish vomited when he found the remnants of a family-style watch buried in one of the mounds of ash. His young cousin had just been hired as junior secretary to the Head of the Unspeakables. Dumbledore remembered her as an unusually bright witch with a shy smile and sparkling eyes. Graduated Hogwarts only three years previously.
“It’s fixed in place now,” Hermione assured him. “But before that… if the shrapnel had shifted even a little –” She looked tearful suddenly. “Oh, Harry, Draco was incredible. He got you in here, in the middle of a battle, so careful that the rock didn’t shift at
He pointed wordlessly to the brown paper bag on his desk, and Pansy bit the inside of her cheek. She’d seen Potter loitering in the hallway before class, of course; seen him shove the bag into Draco’s hand as he rushed past. She’d used her wand, discreetly, and cast a non-verbal
Harry sat stiffly as they went past, and tried not to flinch again when Madam Pomfrey approached him, her face and voice gentle. “All right?” she asked. He nodded, and submitted to her ministrations for as long as he could stand it, but moments later he was on his feet again, too jittery to stay still. “Mr Potter, I haven’t quite finished –”
“Ah, ah!” Draco said, holding up a finger. “This is important. Don’t you want to know what I’ve found?”
“Did you feel it?” Harry asked, thoroughly distracted by the memory of touching Draco’s magic. “Us, I mean. Not the potions. It was like… you know when you lie on earth that has been heated all day by the sun, and it’s warm against your back? And everything’s bright and cheerful, and the sun is soft and warm against your skin...”
Seamus sat in the Gryffindor stands with Dean, watching the team practice. “They’re good,” he said. “Good enough to win, I reckon.” Dean just sighed, and Seamus looked at him in surprise. “You’re not still sore about being off the team, are you?”
“That's ten points from Gryffindor!” Snape snapped. “And there will be more if you continue your defiance. Mr Malfoy does
!” Snape bellowed, and the shock of it reverberated through Draco like a physical blow. He sprang backwards. “By Salazar, have the two of you no shame?!”
Dumbledore shook his head sadly. “Even if that were so, Harry, you are the Chosen One in this war. Your relationship with Mr Malfoy has made him a target. He will never be safe now while Voldemort remains alive. Have you considered that perhaps, if you truly love him, the best thing you can do for him is to die, so that Voldemort can be defeated?”
Vince swallowed his, tolerating the nausea and shrinking feeling with the ease of long practice. His father and Atwood grunted and groaned through it.
Harry nodded. “Pansy was telling the truth. And I’m sure now – whether he took the Mark willingly or not, he’s under duress now. The thing is, even if I manage to somehow convince him I’m smitten with him, I just don’t see how my offer of protection will be enough. He’s terrified of Voldemort. He didn’t even care what Justin did to him, or why. All he could think about was how it might impact on his task.”
“I’m sorry,” Ron said. He could almost see the strain on their faces increase as he lowered his wand. “I’m sorry. It’s Harry.” A plan was already coalescing in his mind. “I have to find Malfoy.”
Pansy resolutely didn’t smile, waving him off. But she took the stairs to Divination with a spring in her step that she couldn’t quite suppress. Draco hadn’t exactly said yes, or even that he would think about it, but he hadn’t said no. That was close enough, for a Slytherin.
Snape huffed. “We don’t have time to mollycoddle them, Rosmerta,” he said. But he let go, stepping back.
Across the clearing, the Dark Lord chanted, “Air, Water, Earth, Fire. The four elements, we offer up to you.” Avery opened his mouth to call out a warning. Too late. “
can testify, and I will,” Hermione said. Ron looked alarmed, whispering something in her ear. “Because it’s the
“Thought you were clever, didn’t you, Potter?” he gloated. “Not so clever now, are you?” He grabbed Harry’s hair, jerking his head back painfully. Foul breath ghosted over his face. “How does it feel, to know you’ve failed? That you will be the medium I use to tear down everything you hold dear?”
“Very sensible,” Dumbledore assured her. “And indeed, very compassionate. What you did was remarkable. Your actions saved the lives of not one, but two boys, and possibly many others. I am proud of you.”
Draco let him go. As intrigued as he was by Tonks’ revelation, he knew he had no part in this conversation. He didn’t even attempt to eavesdrop through the bond, though he wanted to.
But Potter wasn’t paying attention; he was turning in a circle to take in the Room, green eyes bright and fascinated. “What
“A Death Eater attacked Draco in the Ministry today,” she said, her voice muffled. “He showed Draco a Pensieve memory of his mother. They’ve tortured her. We knew it was – but we didn’t
It was Daphne who moved forward, against the flow of people. “Potter,” she said quietly, bending close to him. “I owe you my sister’s life. I won’t forget that.”
Harry frowned and shuffled as far back as the cupboard would allow him. “I won’t hurt you? You’re sure?”
Ron nodded. “So she’s planting doubt in the Wizengamot’s minds. She’ll argue that if he did provoke Malfoy, then he was justified in his use of the Unforgivable. He was under ‘emotional duress’, just like you. I wouldn’t be surprised if they brought in Mind Healers to corroborate it. No one will dare suggest the Chosen One be put on trial, and they’ll try to get Justin off scot-free because you’re not being punished.”
“I don’t like this,” Harry muttered, rubbing his chest. Draco shoved an elbow into his side. Harry didn’t blink. “I’m going to talk to him.”
“Uh,” Harry stuttered, backing away. “It’s – it’s nothing, Draco, really. Professor Snape stopped it –”
“I’m so sorry!” Harry blurted. He’d broken his vow to never let Greyback anywhere near Draco, and he’d allowed himself to be taken out of the fight almost before it began, leaving Draco at the werewolf’s mercy. “I promised to protect you, and I failed. ”
“Just please don’t take it out on us,” Ron added helpfully, and she kicked him under the table. Hard. He yelped. “Her
“Your Alpha has been allowing people to believe that you defeated Voldemort on your own,” Snape said.
“Simply that it protects its own,” Draco explained, sighing. “Wizarding children are vulnerable without the ability to use and control their own core of magic. The theory is that the Wild Magic responds to our awakening core, and protects us until we can protect ourselves.”
what it does? Salazar’s balls, Potter! Where did you even learn it? Only a few, select Death Eaters are taught Snape’s signature spells.”
Terry’s eyes were completely black, and he sucked Harry’s fingers into his mouth, the burning heat of it almost painful.
Harry finishing that essay off last week, and he definitely didn’t buy the lame excuse Harry had given Snape. He didn’t just ‘forget’ an essay. Hermione would kill him, for starters.
“You’re not ready for more sex,” Draco said. His Alpha was a comforting warmth at his back, his hand on Harry’s bare stomach, just resting there possessively, not even
“Draco,” his mother said, trying to restrain him. “Sweetheart, the deadline’s passed. Success or failure, it’s done. It's over.”
good at Ancient Runes. We’ll find a way. Trust me, I’m not interested in becoming a Horcrux. As for our bond, there are several techniques which we may be able to adapt to allow me safe access to your core, but none I’ve found so far are ideal.”
Draco’s face was tight. “I used the Stone Curse, Minister. I don’t know why the counter-curse doesn’t work, and I don’t know what you think I can do if all your leading experts and Healers couldn’t fix him.”
Harry looked around, trying to get his bearings. There was Luna, shooting spells out of a tiny window. Seamus and Millicent Bulstrode covering the door. Hermione Apparated in, and Ron yelled from somewhere behind him, “Take Harry – Hermione, take –!”
Harry felt strangely let down. He’d expected a scathing retort, and the lack of one was almost… disappointing.
“Well, everyone knows about Potter’s crush, of course,” Daphne said. “And that Draco shot him down. But then Theodore saw them together in the Hog’s Head, not long before Draco was attacked. And there’s a rumour that Finch-Fletchley was playing the jealous ex that day.” She smiled at Pansy. “Of course,
Harry blinked at her, relieved. Fatigue was dragging his eyes closed again. Whatever magic was killing him, he thought, it was almost done.
“After the Invasion?” Draco mused. “You think we should count from when I told you I returned your feelings? I did consider that, but then that would make the Manor our first fight as a couple, and I’d really rather not remember our first fight as the one where I tortured you half to death at the Dark Lord’s behest.”
“The girl!” he said, urgently. He didn’t know if the merman could understand him, or even hear him through the Bubble-Head Charm. But when he broke the surface, there was a huge tentacle lifting Birdget out of the water. Another circled his waist. The merman let go. Draco felt himself being lifted, and then set down on the shore. He staggered, falling to his knees.
“Dumbledore didn’t arrive until well after me,” Hermione explained. “He went to make sure all the students were out of the castle first, and he sent the other professors to defend them, down by the lake.”
with the desire to be bitten, hard and painful, teeth digging into him, forcing him to submit. “What do you mean, bite?”
Luna smiled. “You see, the mother gerblin knows that if she was to interfere, she would quite possibly be killed. And then her babies would starve to death, or be eaten by predators. But there comes a point when the children are almost old enough to survive on their own, and the mother thinks:
Draco glanced up automatically, and then cursed himself for that moment of inattention. Cardosa spun away, lifting his own wand. Before Draco could blink, Harry was between them, shield up. Draco swore violently under his breath; crude and ugly words that had no place on a Malfoy’s tongue. But the only one who might have been able to tell him his mother’s fate was now at the end of the Chosen One’s wand, and he had no choice but to release him.
“Indeed. Those caves would have been of great significance to the young Tom Riddle. And I believe I have finally located them.” Dumbledore paused. “Harry, I know we spoke of this some time ago, but would you still like to go with me?”
Harry made his way up to the seventh floor that night, balancing a plate piled high with tantalising roast beef, vegetables and Yorkshire puddings, all covered in steaming gravy. Malfoy had been conspicuously absent from dinner again, and Harry thought bringing him some of the leftovers might be a way to – well, get his foot in the door, so to speak.
Harry breathed out. “Here,” he said, holding out the stone to her. “It’s called the Resurrection Stone. It’s –”
A spell whistled by his ear, almost taking it off. He jerked in surprise. He couldn’t see very well, and he wiped at his eyes with sticky hands.
“But you didn’t see Mr Malfoy change direction. Clearly your assumption that he was getting a drink was erroneous. And if you didn’t actually see the defendant cast the curse, and you didn’t see Mr Malfoy getting his own wand out, perhaps threatening a far more lethal curse
“A gift,” Draco explained. “Some kind of unusual ability, magical in nature, like your Parseltongue. But unlike your Parseltongue, usually received at a wizard’s coming of age, not birth.” He frowned. “It
magic, which Ron said we know almost nothing about. Do you really think a runic circle could hold it? If, of course,” he said, a little doubtfully, “you could even get it out of me.”
She grinned, and Draco had to respect that kind of irrepressible humour in the face of such dreadful odds, even if it didn’t quite reach her eyes. “Which way?”
“Draco,” he said, stupidly. “Hey.” He jumped down from the table and nodded at the empty space where Crabbe still lay. “Your bodyguard fell asleep. I took his place.”
Draco turned the larger of the two over in his hands, perplexed by the look and feel of the packages. His eyes caught on a crease in the Spello-tape. “Did you wrap these yourself?” he asked, astonished. “By
Draco couldn’t tell you exactly how they got Harry home - the walk passed in a flurry of gentle kisses and quiet laughter before they finally arrived at Harry’s apartment.
Draco chest swelled with pride. Yes, in fact, he had thought of everything. The night did, of course, allow for spontaneity, however, the major moves had been planned. He had even written the headline for the next day’s Quibbler, with a promise of ‘close source’ quotes ready for Luna prior to the early morning print.
Someone had spiked the punch; Hermione's galleons were on Seamus, who was already upside-down in the large armchair near the fire, snoring. She enlisted Harry’s aid in getting the first and second years (who were beginning to look a little glazed around the eyes) upstairs, away from the celebration – the boys by bribing them with a variety of Animal Noise sweets from the stash Seamus kept under his bed, and the girls by promising them the spells to achieve the perfect nails.
Hermione looked disappointed, and Ron sighed. He hated it when Hermione was disappointed in him. “Harry is in a difficult position, Ronald,” she chided. “We have to be supportive. The closer he gets to convincing Malfoy he’s in love with him, the greater the risk Malfoy will fall for him. You know how those two are. The fire between them wasn’t just going to go away. Without violence as an outlet, it’s just been redirected.”
Scrimgeour’s eyes narrowed. “Ah. Mr Potter. What a pleasant surprise. Do come in, make yourself at home.”
Draco sucked in a startled breath, and the elder Malfoy's eyes narrowed. But then Narcissa was there, laying a delicate hand on her husband's arm and smiling at them all. “You’re quite right, Harry,” she said, warmly. “Although I do hope you’ll forgive me when I admit to a mother’s bias in thinking both my boys are already perfect.”
“Fine,” she said, trying to smile. “I just wanted to make sure you were okay. And to apologise to you, for yesterday morning.”
“Of course not,” she lied, calmly. “I just wonder how long you can keep doing this. The Dark Lord will not reward you for succeeding in your task. He’ll spare your life, but that is not what you deserve. That is not what a Malfoy deserves.”
Dumbledore inclined his head gravely. “My apologies. I forget, sometimes, what it is like to be young.”
“Draco’s closed the bond,” Harry told him. He could feel the wave of grief swelling up again, threatening his control. He shoved it down mercilessly. “No more bond, no more Wild Magic. No more wandless magic, even.” Ron opened his mouth to argue, and Harry made an impatient gesture. “Okay, I can do a little on my own. But nothing like what I could do with Draco.”
George slid down a little further, peering through a grate. Fred crowded in behind him, and Charlie strained to see over their shoulders. In the room below was a toad-faced woman in vibrant pink robes. Charlie vaguely recognised her as the Senior Undersecretary to the Minister, Umbridge. But that wasn’t what caught his attention.
They ran quickly, silently, through the halls. There were no more Death Eaters Apparating in on top of them. No more battles every few steps. The battle was concentrated in one place. They could both hear and feel the castle crumbling as Voldemort’s army bombarded the infirmary’s defences.
“My concern exactly,” Madam Pomfrey agreed. “Nor should your spell have affected Mr Malfoy’s magic in any way, and yet it appears to have done so. The best way I can describe it is a ripple effect. I am also disturbed that these incidents seem to occur only while you are together. The very fact that there is a clear correlation between these incidents and your proximity to, and physical arousal for Mr Malfoy – well, that indicates to me that there is something of a mutual energy transfer occurring. Perhaps even that you are drawing magic from Mr Malfoy somehow.”
Summer at the Burrow was like nothing Harry had ever experienced before. For once, he had not spent any time at the Dursleys, isolated from his friends and forced to work long hours in sweltering conditions, always with that old fear of a hand raised, or an empty cupboard with a lock on the outside.
“You know everything I do, Ron,” he said. “You know the prophecy. If I don’t make it, at least my Horcrux will be dead, too. After they’re all destroyed, it doesn’t matter who ends it.”
The magic was gone. The forest once again surrounded them, as if it had never been destroyed, and only the light of the moon lit their small clearing. He saw Pansy step from nothing between two trees; a parting in the veil. It sent a chill through him. Then it closed behind her, and all he could see was her watery smile.
He paced back and forth in front of the empty stretch of wall, and the door opened for him almost eagerly. Harry rolled his eyes. Of course,
“Well, you’ve already been very helpful,” Hermione said earnestly, clearly eager to return the compliment. “Seamus passed on the list of Malfoy’s likes and dislikes, and Harry received your package in the owl post this morning.” She shook her head. “They fit him perfectly, and he looks
He found himself in the small, hidden room behind his father’s bookcase. He frowned at the painting on the wall, suddenly aware that this was all wrong. The Emerald Room was his family’s best kept secret. How had Weasley and Granger –?
She went. Dumbledore had been very clear. The Order existed to protect Harry Potter at all costs. Hogwarts had to be prepared. As long as Potter was alive, the wizarding world still had hope, but if he died…
“No. The two potions you drank were diagnostic only. They allowed me to more closely examine your magic, and interpret your cores in a meaningful way. That’s all.”
Four repetitions. Four dimensions – length, width, height, and magic. According to all the laws of Arithmancy, it
’ and hurried out. “Pomona, Filius, if you would check in not only on your Houses, but on the Slytherins and Gryffindors, while Horace and Minerva are otherwise occupied?”
And then his rage was echoed, doubling again and again as it ricocheted through his connection to Voldemort’s mind. He didn’t fight it. He
Harry sighed, deflating. “I get that,” he said, reaching out to touch Malfoy’s cheek. “I do. Family is important to you.”
Seamus was silent for a while. Then he said, carefully, “I know this probably doesn’t mean much, coming from me. But I’m glad you did.”
Voldemort laughed again; a high-pitched sound that grated on Harry’s last nerve. “I do so wish I could watch you teach him that respect, young Malfoy, but I have waited too long already. It is time for Harry Potter to die.”
Snape made a muffled noise and whirled out of the room, slamming the door. Everyone stared at it for a moment.
The Manor’s halls were as dark and silent as a tomb, and it made Draco’s skin crawl. It had been like this ever since the Dark Lord and his minions had taken up residence in Malfoy Manor, as if the very life had been sucked out of his home.
He sucked in another breath, this one entirely involuntary. Draco stood with his chin up, shoulders squared, a huge rock hovering over his head. He looked cold, dangerous. His back might have been unprotected, but the hallway behind him was filled with house-elves, fighting alongside Hogwarts’ defenders.
Madam Pomfrey spoke first. “It is, very simply put, one of the three gender roles, Harry,” she explained, very gently. “Alpha, Beta, and Omega. The majority of wizarding folk are, as you know, Betas, but –”
“The thing is,” Harry said, speaking over him. “The thing is, sir,” he said again, apologetically, “you always knew Draco was a Death Eater, and that he was working on something for Voldemort. And that he was responsible for what happened to Katie and Ron. But you brushed me off, every time I tried to voice my suspicions to you. Why? Do you know what his task is? Do you know who he’s trying to kill?”
“It wasn’t his fault,” Hermione told him, her voice hitching. “He was tortured. We’ll – we’ll get him back, I’m sure of it. But…”
“And that, I think, is my cue to leave,” Pius said, standing with a creak. He laughed softly. “Listen to those old bones. Enjoy your youth, boys. I predict many, many happy years to come.”
Ginny shrugged. “I don’t know,” she said, trying to sound casual. “He hasn’t asked me. I’m not even sure he’s going.”
He remembered Dumbledore telling him to take the Resurrection Stone with him. He wondered what he would see, if he did. His parents? Sirius? It was very tempting. But he also remembered Dumbledore calling the Hallows his Horcruxes. He didn’t need to see the shades of those he’d lost. He would see them soon enough. This was not about looking to the past; it was about securing the future of the people he was leaving behind.
He only realised that he was stiff with anger when Draco stroked gentle hands down his arms, shushing him. Harry sighed, making an effort to relax back into his Alpha’s arms. “Sorry,” he muttered, reluctantly.
“I don’t want children,” he said, just to be clear. “Not yet. Certainly not this heat. No matter what I say, Draco, you have to give me the contraceptive potions.”
is going on here?” Her gaze caught on Theo, standing in the open door. “Oh!” she said, blinking. “You know about the Room too?” She glanced down at her bottle, and belatedly hid it behind her back. She hiccuphed, then frowned. “Oh!” she said again, and sent a Stunner at Lupin, who had just begun to move.
“You don’t have to lose yourself in a storm to fly away,” Draco said, his eyes worried. “We can go anywhere you want, right now. Where do you want to go? Tell me, and I’ll make it happen.”
), then Draco would break it off. There was no doubt in Harry’s mind about that. And then Draco would have no alternative but to complete his task, and commit murder – if Harry couldn’t stop him first.
“If I’d told you, we would have been in the same situation we are now,” Dumbledore said, reprovingly. “A third party now has knowledge of Mr Malfoy’s task, and I’m afraid I have no choice but to expel him.”
Parents would be informed on a case by case basis; not by owl, but by personal Floo. Dumbledore didn’t give a reason for this, but everyone was well aware that owls could be intercepted, and there were certain students whose parents were no doubt part of the army camped on Hogwarts’ doorstep.
“You know what, Harry,” Parvarti spoke up, gamely. She was sitting a little further down the table with Lavender Brown and a group of fifth-year girls. “Everyone’s talking about it. You didn’t
Harry hesitated. If he threw himself down, onto his shoulder, he might just be able to get off a spell. But Ron would have time for one too, and at such close range, it wouldn’t miss. Unless he cast a shield, of course.
“I was angry,” Dumbledore said simply. “My sister Ariana had been the victim of a brutal attack when she was only six years old, leaving her traumatised and prone to uncontrolled, violent bursts of magic. My father was imprisoned for the torture and murder of the Muggles who hurt her, and my mother was killed by one of Ariana’s bursts of uncontrollable magic when I was seventeen.” He looked very sad. “It wasn’t her fault. But I was left to care for her, and when Gellert moved to the village, I fell in love with a young man who was as angry at the world as I was. I thought he was wonderful, Harry. He had no family to speak of except his great-aunt, so he was free, and wild, and strong in a way I thought I could never be.”
“Genealogies,” Draco shrugged. “Purebloods are all interrelated; my history is yours. The Potters were pureblood almost as long as the Malfoys and the Blacks.” He smirked. “Until the last generation, of course.”
“I believe it is the Wild Magic we have to thank, in this case,” Reed said. He looked baffled, but when Harry tried to rise, he held him down.
A gasp went up from the crowd. Demelza Robins had swerved to avoid two Ravenclaw Chasers, and the Quaffle slipped through her fingers in what seemed like slow motion. And then suddenly Dean was there, swooping up from below to catch the Quaffle in a breath-taking save. He threw it to Katie, who was almost right next to the Gryffindor goals. She recovered, caught it with only a slight fumble, and scored before the Ravenclaw Keeper had even figured out that the Quaffle was still in play.
This was what it was supposed to be like between them, and he couldn’t believe he’d never realised how much he was missing.
Voldemort laughed cruelly, and it was like nails raking down his spine. Draco leaned forward, pressing a kiss to Harry’s lips. Harry struggled, but he was too weak to break free, and the Dark Lord continued to laugh. It was difficult to tune him out, but Draco tried, concentrating on ripping through Harry’s pitiful mental defences. He could feel the turmoil in Harry’s soul; the pain, the fear, the agony of betrayal. And he soothed him, gentled him, sent him away to a place in his mind where he could lie on the earth and feel the sun against his skin, the warmth of the ground beneath his back.
“No, no,” Malfoy said, reaching up and biting down again over Harry’s carotid. Harry relaxed in spite of the pain, feeling Malfoy’s fingers slide in and out, twisting, scissoring, stretching him out. “That’s right, baby. You can take it. You were
. This, here, when Harry kissed him, sliding his fingers into Draco’s hair, claiming Draco’s mouth with tongue and teeth, absolutely sure of his right to Draco’s body, his heart. Their feelings were stripped bare for each other through the bond, and he knew exactly how Harry felt. There was no denying how much Harry wanted –
She was understandably shocked by Draco’s abrupt recovery, and the two Healers practically tripped over each other in their eagerness to find out what had happened.
Harry subsided. Draco was right. Besides, Umbridge was looking far too pleased with herself, and his day was already bad enough without making hers any better. He sank back down onto the bench, and the Minister called for order. “This
Harry just stared at him helplessly. He was horrifyingly aware that the whole room was hanging on their every word, witnesses to the annihilation of everything he held most dear. But it didn’t matter. All that mattered was the boy in front of him, shattering into a million pieces, and there was nothing he could do about it. “Draco, I’m so
“I’m not blind, Draco,” Harry said tensely, and Draco realised that Cardosa’s Mark was still exposed.
“It has its charms,” Draco agreed, and Harry could almost hear Hermione’s teeth grinding together. Draco raised his eyebrows at Harry, and Harry understood that this was a test.
“But Draco most of all,” Daphne said, matter-of-factly. “When did you start placing his survival above your own, darling?”
But he couldn’t just ignore the knock. He had a debt to pay. Several, in fact. Pansy had explained that, despite Snape’s disparaging view of Potter’s contribution, even he hadn’t been able to get through the mob at The Three Broomsticks until Potter had dispersed them all. And then there was the essay, and the way he’d sat in that chair by Draco’s bedside all night when there was a chance he wouldn’t wake up, and the chocolates from Belgium, and the kiss.
“It’s my fault,” Pansy said. “It’s my fault, Draco. My plan. Not his, or Dumbledore’s. I wanted you out, and I couldn’t see any other way to do it. It’s like you said. He was the only one you’d consider strong enough, and honourable enough, to protect you if you defected. It had to be him.”
“Why? Are you scared, Mal –” The name dried up in his mouth, and he fought to continue, but there was something far more powerful stopping him. He was panting with anger now. “Seriously? I seriously can’t call you by your fucking
Ron stood on the battlements overlooking the west lawn, his little mirror placed carefully on the parapet in front of him. The boundary wards were still holding, but volley after volley shook the castle. There had been no word from the Ministry; no sign that aid would be forthcoming from that quarter.
There were several infuriated shouts as he was hustled out of the room. Snape locked and barred the door behind them, and he jumped at the sound of thumps. Loud, hard, the door shaking – as if the students (Alphas, he reminded himself; there was no point sugar-coating it) were actually trying to
“Perhaps,” Dumbledore said. “And I will never be able to forgive myself if he did. When I penetrated his Occlumency shields yesterday, I believed, foolishly, that he had shown me all I needed to know. That his love for his mother, and Harry, would keep him loyal to us. But if You-Know-Who has a better offer –”
Harry considered that. Was he okay? Voldemort was dead, which was good, but now he just felt – lost. Like he’d had one goal, one purpose, for so long, and now it was all over, he didn’t quite know what to do with himself. He wasn’t sure how he was supposed to work it out, either, when half of him wanted to curl up in a ball and cry for all that he’d lost, and half of him wanted Draco to just throw him down right here in the middle of the library and fuck him until he could barely remember his own name, let alone the ridiculous, unflattering titles the newspapers kept coming up with; The Boy Who Lived To Destroy Voldemort, The Omega Saviour, even, horribly, The Omega Who Had The Last Laugh.
Suddenly the room was a lot more crowded, and there was the smell of blood and scorched wood clinging to robes. Draco thought, stupidly:
“What? No!” Harry gripped Draco’s hands tightly. Unlike his own, violently loud outbursts of temper, Draco’s anger tended to manifest itself in quiet, deadly sarcasm, and Harry felt panicked that he’d provoked such a reaction now. Now, more than ever before, when he needed Draco. “Of course not! I told you, I take my promises seriously. I only found out just now, when you came in.” He flushed, embarrassed. “How did you know, anyway? That I – I needed you?”
,” she begged, close to tears. Her best friend was slipping away from her, and there was nothing she could do. He had lost his way, possibly even his heart, and he was surrounded by danger on all sides.
Harry felt bandages wrapping around his torso, and there was an instant lessening of pain. He relaxed, letting out a slow breath.
“Until he has been properly prepared to accept that he has to die, of course,” Severus said, bitterly. He knew it was necessary, but it grated, deep inside, that Lily’s son would be sacrificed on the altar of Dumbledore’s war. It grated that he had been manipulated, all these years, into protecting the boy, only to be told that
The spell flashed towards Draco. Quicker than the eye could see, the snake snapped up between them and swallowed the spell. It flopped back to the ground, hissing angrily in Harry’s direction.
Harry frowned, digging it out. Right. He did a quick calculation in his head. “It’s not ready,” he said, not quite a question.
“Well, I can help it now,” Harry said, scowling. “And I’m not going to let Draco bloody Malfoy take control of
“Yes,” Pomfrey acknowledged. “But every able-bodied person needs to be out there now. That means you, too. We’ve all rested, in large part thanks to your efforts. Dennis will stay, and Mrs Malfoy is too fragile to fight. Between the five of us, we will manage.”
Draco moved forward, turning with her as she looked from the Mirror to the Tapestry. It showed a dense, snarled web of paths, reflecting each other in the two mirrors. They were twined together, like the branches of a tree, extending into infinity. Surely it wasn’t possible to divine anything from such a tangled weave?
Harry scowled back at him, but he couldn’t deny that Draco was right. His reflexes were dulled, and the heat made it difficult to focus on anything but his Alpha, and breeding. That was what the heat was for, after all, to encourage an Omega to breed with his Alpha.
“You got it,” George said, turning onto his side. It hurt to move, but being able to touch his twin again made it all worthwhile. “Go. We’re all right.”
Fortunately, it just so happened that the nearest empty room had a very large desk. “Not that I’m not enjoying the manhandling,” Draco told him, “because you know I am, but –
Hermione shook her head at them. “Intimacy,” she said. “Each time it happened, you were close to Malfoy. Out of necessity, yes, but you’d never really experienced that kind of intimacy before, had you? So the feelings it engendered would have been powerful. Powerful enough that whatever this is manifested itself in you first.”
The hands grasped his shoulders, wrenching him around. “Pull yourself together!” Snape snapped. “This is
“I’ve never heard of anything like it,” Draco agreed. “Nor has Mother. She’s searching the books in our library at the Manor, but if there’s a precedent, I think we would have found it by now.”
“Yeah, yeah,” Harry said, cutting him off. He didn’t want to hear about his bloody Horcrux anymore. “But we’ve only had these abilities a few weeks.” He rose, swivelling to straddle Draco on the armchair. “I think a little practice is called for, don’t you?”
Harry had taken a risk, slipping an arm back around Draco’s waist. “I love him, Pansy,” he said. He felt the air leave Draco’s lungs in a soft whoosh of surprise. “I don’t know why my magic is acting up, I don’t know what it’s doing, but I promise you that I won’t let it hurt him. I won’t let it take his magic. But I’m also not going to let it keep us apart. You’re right, his life is worth more than that. And… so is mine.”
They spun together, wands falling into their hands, shields up instinctively and building on each other in a practised web before they even realised who they were facing. Two Aurors: Dawlish and a pureblood Draco recognised as one of the Rookwoods. Jordan, he thought. Behind them were Dumbledore and Professor Slughorn.
Adeline Cardosa – that little chit of a first-year – had even said hello, which Draco had appreciated more than she could possibly know. Then again, she clearly had a good head on her shoulders, so perhaps she did. Draco reminded himself to keep an eye out for her, if he could. There weren’t many Slytherins who had fathers in the inner circle. She might need his protection one day.
The castle was eerily silent. The bombardment against the boundary wards had stopped. All Harry could hear was their footsteps, ringing on the stone floor.
,” Draco hissed, and stroked his hand once up and down Harry's cock. “Come,” he ordered, and Harry gasped as his balls drew up and his cock jerked, spurting weakly.
“Then you’ll have it by the end of the day,” Narcissa promised. She frowned. “I do hope you’re not planning on doing anything dangerous with it, though, sweetheart.”
“Okay,” Harry said, slowly. “But we have a whole subject dedicated to Defence Against the Dark Arts. And the Auror Corp’s whole mandate is to catch Dark wizards.”
Holding Draco’s gaze with his own, he moved forward, lifting a hand. Draco flinched almost imperceptibly. An ugly part of Harry actually enjoyed that expression of fear, but, “I’m not going to hit you,” he said, trailing a gentle finger down Draco’s angry, red scar. “And I’m not going to let a couple of childish insults drive me away.”
“You could start with transfiguring us a proper bed,” Malfoy suggested, slinging a leg over Harry’s and wriggling to get comfortable. Harry caught his breath. There were still several layers between them, but the intimacy of the position… he’d never felt anything like it. Honestly, it made him a little uncomfortable, but the pleasant friction was making certain other parts of his anatomy –
“He’s just trying to protect me,” Harry said. “But I don’t care what they think. Not about you.” Hermione made a small noise in her throat, but he didn’t look at her, still holding Draco’s gaze stubbornly. “What happened?”
. What did that mean? “Fuck,” he said. “Pansy, I need him safe as much as you do, but Ron’s right. We have to do this first. Come with us, please. We could use your help.”
Harry glanced at the wall. There was no door; no sign at all that Malfoy was interested in talking to him. “Fine,” he said, holding out the tray. “Just give him this for me?”
Pansy rose to meet them halfway. She didn’t miss the way Draco’s step faltered as Potter stopped, nor the way he was struggling to keep his eyes open.
“It was an educated guess,” Granger said, fretfully. “I am so sorry, Harry. I never thought this would happen. I didn’t even – but how could I? I thought your magic might give you some kind of shelter, or put up privacy wards. But your subconscious must have latched onto the word ‘room’, and brought you here. It’s the only explanation.”
“No?” Dumbledore said, gravely. “Well, I am pleased to hear it. But I must beg you to remember that war is coming. You must be extremely careful in whom you choose to place your trust. It may be tempting to open your heart to the person who shares your bed, to share your deepest secrets and darkest fears, but lovers may use that to betray you. And you must also remember that there are allegiances and motivations, undercurrents of war, that you know nothing of. You may cause devastating harm by continuing this liaison. To young Draco, and to countless others.”
“Two first-years got caught up in the mob,” he explained, quietly. “Merlin knows what they thought they were doing in Hogsmeade. I couldn’t get much out of them. They were hysterical. I just tried to calm them down a bit, cast a few
Voldemort’s power had always been undeniable; the ease with which he performed non-verbal spells other wizards couldn’t even manage with the incantation. Harry was the same. And, of course, Draco had felt for himself the incalculable, unending vastness of the Wild Magic. But that was as supplicant to the ungovernable. This was different. What was within him now was like nothing he’d ever known; a power no one person should be able to hold.
“Thank you,” he said to the wall, because the other Omega had saved his life just as much as Draco had. And then he waved his hand apologetically, and said, “No prying eyes – or ears – this time.”
Lupin’s mouth twisted into a cruel grin. Between one moment and then next, he’d transformed into a huge wolf. He leapt right at Seamus, and tore out his throat with a wet crunch.
He felt himself flush, and looked down at his sadly neglected parchment. If he failed this potion, it would be Malfoy’s fault. Malfoy and his annoyingly pretty hair.
George grinned, and set off his Decoy Detonator. It scurried away on four legs and exploded behind the enormous black cage imprisoning their family. Death Eaters yelled, some going to investigate the sound only to get taken out by the tornado.
“It would seem so,” Dumbledore agreed. “But Harry, an Alpha-Omega bond is not mutual. Your mate will
“I’m afraid that threat no longer concerns her,” Dumbledore said. “With Voldemort’s attacks increasing in frequency, the Ministry is overstretched. One unregistered Animagus would be very low on their list of priorities right now.”
His arms were screaming in agony, but he stayed very still, hanging limp by his wrists in the vain hope of delaying the inevitable moment when someone realised he was awake.
Harry made Draco stay at Hogwarts while he attended that one. Azkaban was overflowing, and with the Dementors gone, the Minister had made the decision to reinstate the death penalty for the worst of the Death Eaters.
Dolores Umbridge stepped over a body, a lacy pink handkerchief pressed delicately to her nose. She curtsied. “My Lord?”
Ron crumpled, and Harry spun and grabbed him. He managed to hold onto him, keeping his unconscious body upright and between him and the direction the spell had come from. “Draco?” he said, cautiously.
Dawlish and Jenkins went first, and the others followed. Dumbledore waited until the end, and then he put a hand on Moody’s arm. “I’m afraid I don’t have the strength for another Apparition, old friend. Will you Side-Along me?”
Harry shook his head, amused. Draco Malfoy, Dark wizard, Death Eater, Ice Prince… and cuddly animal lover? He tried to smother a snort, and ended up coughing. “So,” he said, “we’re White Mages. And we have some kind of great ‘destiny’ together? Defeating Voldemort?”
sex, “they say all the great Seers had cherry wands. In fact, I believe Professor Trelawney has one.”
Harry glared at him. “I’m well aware of that, thank you,” he snapped, and Draco flinched back, his face falling. Harry sighed. “I’m sorry, Draco. It’s just - you’ll be the one in danger if we don’t figure this out, not me. They’ll go after you, and they won’t want to fuck you, they’ll want to
They all stared at it. It had just occurred to Harry that only Earth Magic could have done something like that, when he caught sight of a tiny blue light, rapidly approaching them from the treeline.
“Oh,” Harry said helplessly, and then suddenly he realised they were floating three feet above the bed.
Snape made a muffled cough that sounded suspiciously like a laugh. “Indeed. And if you don’t stop blubbering into each others’ arms like the tossers you
“You must understand that it will appear very strange to Ms Skeeter if I do not. Not to mention the Ministry, the school board, and the general public. She had no obligation to warn me of what she’d discovered. I believe she came to me immediately upon her discovery, and was entirely sincere in her concern for my well-being. She spoke of reporting Mr Malfoy to the Ministry before publishing her story. Of course, she will still have the ‘scoop’, as they say, but her reasons in coming to me first appear to be selfless.”
Draco’s fingers curled into his palms. “Merlin help me, I had no choice. You told me once that you knew I wouldn’t use your trust against you unless I had no choice, and I
,” Draco hissed, pulling away. He found his wand and flicked it, and suddenly he was fully dressed and smoothing down the wrinkles in his robes.
Harry made himself comfortable. “You know, I think I’m catching on,” he mused, hands drifting down Draco’s chest. “You call me Potter when you
“Don’t be an idiot,” Harry said. “It’s not you.” Draco looked up, intent on arguing. Harry interrupted. “You look like hell.”
Hermione pursed her lips. “Not necessarily. Ginny’s very independent. She doesn’t realise it, of course, but she would never be happy with Harry. Harry needs too much. He needs to be loved, to be needed. To protect, to belong, to
“The runes will force them along the carriage-road,” McGonagall said. “It comes right past Hagrid’s hut. The higher ground gives us an advantage. Keep moving, use the trees for cover. We should be able to hold them off for a while. As soon as it looks like we’ll be overwhelmed, we retreat back to the castle. If you’re injured, retreat or stay hidden. Professor Slughorn, three more vials, if you please.”
It was a new experience, putting his mouth on Draco when he was still soft. He made himself comfortable between his lover’s legs, starting with little licks; just tasting, teasing the soft flesh to hardness. Draco moaned in his sleep, shifting restlessly. Harry feathered his palms up Draco’s thighs, taking the soft balls in his hand and rolling them gently as he closed his mouth over Draco’s cock and sucked.
“I don’t know,” Hermione said, annoyed. She looked up at the judges. “What I do know is that Malfoy was with Harry behind The Three Broomsticks, just before the attack.”
Harry didn’t flinch, but it was a near thing. He shoved his hands in his pockets before he turned. “Yes, professor?”
“It’s already in his heart,” Reed said, as he read through the diagnostic data scrolling above Potter’s head. “He’s lost a lot of blood.” His brow furrowed. “Too much. He should be dead.”
“The army,” Ron said. “The wizarding world heard Harry’s call, and they came. The tide’s turned. But nothing we try has any effect on the inferi. Even the werewolves. They just keep getting up. Apparently Fiendfyre works, but we can’t risk it inside the castle. Lucius Malfoy said there’s one way, though. It’s a long shot, but… I don’t suppose you’ve seen the Elder wand lying around, have you?”
“They broke the curse,” Harry argued. There were students helping McGonagall to a bench, but inside the hall, there were others who were hurt, unconscious. No one was helping them. “I have to check on Ron. He’s – he’s been knocked out.” He took in Draco’s expression. “That’s real, right? I can see him breathing.”
, understand? I’ll come and get you when it’s all over, but I – obviously I’ve never done anything like this before, and it’ll lash out at anything, any
“Well, she doesn’t need any help there,” Harry muttered. “But what’s that got to with Draco’s task? How’d she even… I mean, is she
Draco opened his mouth to protest the sticky substance in his hair, but found Potter’s lips against his instead. He stilled, a shuddering moan working its way up through his body. Potter took full advantage, slipping his tongue into his mouth. The taste was shockingly good, sending shivers down his spine.
Dessert had been apple and rhubarb crumble, and according to Pansy’s list, Malfoy loathed rhubarb. So he made his way up to the seventh floor with a plate of shepherd’s pie and four cream cakes instead, carefully wrapped, shrunk, and secreted in a pocket.
He startled, looking at her, and then around at the other tables. Hermione held up her wand in explanation. “Oh,” he said. “Right. I’m not using it anymore. I found out who the Half-Blood Prince is. I mean, Draco told me.”
“Don’t be foolish, Potter,” she interrupted, stern but gentle. “It’s not your fault. But you need to listen to me. It won’t be long before the castle is breached, one way or another. Lucius was always good at dismantling wards. You need to get word out that we need aid.”
“I know that, Harry.” Draco’s eyes had softened. “Slytherin, remember? Honestly, I’d hoped you didn’t understand, especially in the beginning. I gave you far too much, far too quickly.”
“Not if I get to him first,” Dean said grimly, and Harry realised he’d been sitting right next to Ron.
it, I tore it up and threw it out of your body, and then I went back to the Quidditch pitch, and you
“Indeed. By indirectly saving my life, you have exposed the one spy we had within Voldemort’s inner circle, and condemned us both to slow, painful deaths.”
Draco put a hand over his. “Harry,” he said, very seriously, and waited until Harry lifted his eyes to his. “I will do whatever it takes.
Snape had them push the desks against the walls, leaving a large open space in the centre for duelling. Ron managed to pair up with Susan Bones, one of the few Hufflepuffs in the class, and when Harry looked around, Hermione was standing with Parkinson. Harry gave her an amused look; it wouldn’t surprise him in the least if she tried to interrogate the other girl under the guise of duelling.
Harry scrambled to his feet. “Thank –” he said, but Draco was already rolling in the other direction. Harry found himself facing Augustus Rookwood. He jerked up his wand.
Harry stumbled backwards, and suddenly there were arms around his waist, hands wandering into definite no-touching areas, lips on his throat, and he’d only just registered that it was Ernie Macmillan – prefect Ernie Macmillan, always so upright and proper and respectable and
“But we make our own choices,” Harry argued. “We have to take responsibility for the consequences of those choices.”
They’d just passed through the doors to the castle, and Harry paused. “Because,” he said. “I trust you. I trust you won’t use it against me, and if you do, it’ll be because you had no other choice.”
Draco relaxed into it, pleased. Nothing about their lives was easy, or simple. War was coming, and last night had been the first time he’d slept soundly in longer than he could remember. But none of that could change
“I’ll call you Merlin himself if it’ll hurry you the hell up,” Draco promised, trying to push back onto his cock.
. He shivered, feeling himself stir a little. Which should have been impossible after the last couple of hours.
Harry woke the next morning to find himself alone, the bed next to him cold. Draco wasn’t in the room, nor was he in his bathroom. Nonplussed, Harry peered out into the den. Crabbe was the only one there, laboriously reading a letter. Harry shut the door again without disturbing him.
something Dumbledore’s done for you? Made an access exemption for you in the wards, perhaps, or given you an emergency Portkey to the Room, just in case?”
“You did hurt me,” Harry said, slowly. “You were cold, and cruel. You put on the masks I used to think was all there were to Draco Malfoy, and you used them to hurt me. But they’re not you, are they? They’re just something you use. Wield, like a weapon.”
They’d reached the pitch, and Harry guided him over to the Gryffindor stands, ducking beneath them. “How do you know so much about the Potters?” he asked, raising his voice to be heard over the crowd above.
“Not at all, Harry,” Dumbledore chided, gently. “You cannot be held responsible for the actions of Voldemort’s Death Eaters. Nor Mr Finch-Fletchley’s subsequent, unprovoked attack on Mr Malfoy.”
Lucius scowled. “You are treading dangerous ground, Draco. I suggest you reconsider this new attitude before –” He broke off.
He was able to focus on the exam, knowing that Draco was looking out for him, and he handed in the paper to McGonagall with the knowledge that he’d done his best.
“There is nothing to be sorry for, my boy.” He held out the object instead. It was a small, cloth-wrapped bundle, and Harry took it, opening the cloth curiously. Inside lay a familiar black stone, with a jagged crack running down the centre.
He positioned himself in front of the windows, hands folded behind his back, gazing out across the lawn. He was determined not to show his nerves, nor give Harry an inch.
Draco snorted. “Touché. Well, then, I suppose your pup told you Finch-Fletchley took Potter’s virginity and then broke up with him the morning after?”
Harry took a step forward to meet him instead, slipping his left arm around Malfoy’s waist, holding him in place as he insinuated his other hand into Malfoy’s light, flowing summer robes. He was a little surprised by just how difficult that was, with several different layers, but entirely unsurprised to find typical pureblood clothing underneath – the tunic-style clothing often worn in the warmer months.
“To save his life,” Pansy pointed out. “You could have earned yourself great favour by truly betraying Potter. But you didn’t. And at great personal risk, I might add.”
He heard a sickening snap, and swung around. A vampire had twisted Lavender’s wand arm up behind her. Its teeth were already deep in her neck, guzzling her blood, pale-white cheeks already flushing with indecent colour.
“Nothing,” Harry said, in satisfaction. No sick thrill at the touch of Dark magic. He was half-Dark himself now, and wouldn’t the Horcrux have loved that? “It’s really gone.”
Draco sighed. “You’re never going to tell me, are you?” Harry just blinked at him innocently, and Draco tried to frown at him. “What happened to obeying your Alpha, Potter?”
. You can’t interact with him the same way you’re both used to. You’ll just end up fighting, and you’ll never convince him that way. I think you already know that, on a subconscious level. The way you handled him today was perfect. Sweet to his sour, no matter how he tries to provoke you. When he insults your parents, you – I don’t know, smile at him. When he tells you to get lost, you tell him how much you’ll miss him, and how you can’t wait until you’re with him again. When he tries to hex you –”
The stasis charm on Astoria Greengrass needed renewing in less than five minutes. Even so, Narcissa knew from Poppy's desperate plea to St Mungo's, several minutes ago, that she wouldn’t live much longer. St Mungo's had refused her.
his parents. Sirius. Cedric. He’d destroyed lives, torn families apart, killed hundreds of innocents in his cowardly guerrilla attacks. Came far, far too close to killing Draco at Malfoy Manor, just two months ago.
She scrambled to her feet, and sprinted in the other direction. Her heart was pounding in her chest as she ducked through the trees. Her mind raced, dazed. Dragon.
the unrivalled majesty of Nature driving through his veins, stripping him of everything but Magic, pure and wild. He wanted to shed this mortal body and fly, up and up, to where nothing could touch him, and no one could hurt him, and he didn’t have to fight anymore. Where nothing mattered but the wind, carrying him higher and higher –
“Something’s wrong,” Mulciber was saying. She could just see him, through the ring of Death Eaters. He was bent over Potter, frowning. “His heart is damaged, my lord. I’m not sure –”

know you’re not the out-of-control monster they’re making you out to be. It was just a mistake. And I’ll stand by you no matter what, Harry.”
“Reverse psychology,” Hermione said. “Malfoy’s an arse, right?” Ron and Harry stared at her, and she flushed. “Well, he
There was another Death Eater bound and unconscious in an alcove, shimmering shields guarding the entrance. Yaxley was fighting his way towards it. Malfoy, Nott and Professor Lupin were standing in his way.
Up until now, all of Harry’s successes had been nothing compared to his failures. And now he was doing something real at last; something important. Something that might actually save someone. Someone even, perhaps,
He pulled Harry’s vial from the ground. The potion inside was a beautiful, shining gold. Ron silently blessed the Half-Blood Prince’s old, tattered textbook. Snape or not, they needed a perfect Resolution Potion right now.
A sharp pain went through his chest, and he gasped, doubling over. Madam Pomfrey’s face settled into stern lines. “Miss Parkinson,
He yelped, flinging his arms around Draco’s neck and wrapping his legs tighter around Draco’s waist.
Draco’s brows twitched together. “What? You didn't... you mean last night? You didn’t come last night?”
at Yaxley, but apparently that trick only worked once. Yaxley countered and returned with a spell that trailed a tail of grey. The Fortuna Curse.
Draco leaned back against his pillows and folded his hands in his lap, willing his heart to slow down. It was still thumping wildly in his chest, first from the horror of the realisation that he’d never delivered his letter, and then Potter’s insistent, devastatingly powerful seduction, and finally the shock of Snape’s abrupt intrusion.
“Blood,” Malfoy echoed. He reached forward and gripped Harry’s left wrist, tugging it out. “What did you do, scrub them clean with jux venom?”
Harry broke away, and began to laugh helplessly. He rested his forehead against Draco’s. “Shall I Side-Along you to our Room?” he murmured.
life. Draco, darling, I may have to confiscate your crown entirely if you continue this self-sacrificial nonsense.”
Harry almost left it at that. If this was what the news was like, a month on, he dreaded to think what it had been like in the immediate aftermath. How much had he missed? How much more did he still have to learn? Could he really bear to find out?
Malfoy’s mouth dropped open. “Potter!” he said, outraged, and Harry just smiled sweetly, lunging towards him and toppling him to the ground. Zabini squawked, only just moving out of the way in time to avoid being pulled down with them. The class erupted. Malfoy struggled, kicking out ineffectively as Harry pinned his arms to the ground and pretended to try to get to his wand.
Harry considered going for his wand, but Ron had already made it to the door. He contented himself with a loud, heartfelt, “Fuck you!” that echoed down the stairs after his (soon to be dead) friend, and closed his eyes again.
She grabbed a glass of punch and headed up to the girls’ dormitories, leaving Hermione wondering if it really would work out. Then she heard the distinctive sound of Ron’s footsteps, stomping down the stairs, and she stopped wondering and started smiling.
“You seem to have forgotten what everyone else in this room knows, Sadie,” Draco said, softly. “I am a Malfoy, and Malfoys survive. We might fall, but we always rise again, and those who betray us never go unpunished. You think a third-generation pureblood poses a threat to
“Albus!” Ambrose gasped, skidding into his portrait. His eyes were wide, the colour faded from his face, leaving him pale and washed-out. “The Ministry is overrun. Someone’s set off Fiendfyre on the ninth level. Everyone on nine and ten has been cut off. Some of the portraits are saying Voldemort has the
Draco just kissed him again. “We should get cleaned up,” he said, casting the Tempus charm. “We have an exam in – ugh. Half an hour.”
like riding a broomstick! Draco’s muscles moved under him, power and menace in every swoop and rise. The air rushed over his face with a speed unlike anything he’d ever experienced before. His whole body was thrumming in time with the Wild Magic; singing in his soul, racing through his veins. He could feel every dip and flow in the air currents, as if
“Ah. Well, I am afraid my reason for that, at least, is very uninteresting,” Pius said, smiling at him. “I am two hundred and seventy-seven years old, Mr Potter. And while I pride myself on maintaining my youthful vigour in many ways... ah, unfortunately sexual relations is not one of them.”
Draco squeezed his hand gently. “Would you?” he asked Dumbledore. “You call him brave, but you made him reckless. Moulding him, manipulating him, until he was ready to throw his life away for the cause –”
“He won’t,” Hermione said confidently, but the line between her brows gave her away. She was as worried as he was, and Ron felt his sense of foreboding grow.
Troy’s face was understanding. “D, you’re an idiot. That boy is into you. He couldn’t be any more obvious.”
“Do I need any preparation?” Harry asked innocently, standing and brushing his hands over his backside.
Draco smiled reassuringly. “I won’t let anything happen to you,” he promised, and took Harry’s hand, tucking it into the crook of his elbow. “I have you.” He met Harry’s eyes.
And have him Draco did - after the familiar whoosh of Apparation, Draco landed and found his arms wrapped tightly around Harry who was gripping the blonde's arms tightly, head burrowed in the narrow chest. Draco’s eyes were drawn to where Harry’s white teeth were biting his bottom lip enticingly. Harry’s head tilted up slightly further towards Draco’s and his eyes fluttered slightly.
“Well turns out I am,” Draco stood abruptly. “If you’re finished, we should go and get you dressed. We have about an hour before we meet the gentlemen for our pre-club drinks.”
Ron threw himself down on the chair next to Blaise and grabbed a croissant and snagged Blaise’s glass. “Finally. I’ve been looking for you all over, Malfoy!”
Harry leaned more firmly against Draco’s arm and laid his hand on one of Draco’s. “I’m sorry.” He looked up at Draco. “Your mother was pretty incredible, you know, and she loved you so much.” The heat of Harry’s hand warmed the chill that had fallen upon Draco. No matter his parents flaws- and there were many- they were still his parents.
Oh, well I was going to wear a suit. Let me see if I can find a photo and you can tell me what’s more appropriate.
Unfortunately for Draco, that didn’t help him at all. Harry’s eyes fluttered open, and the green now lined with black kohl was even more startling than usual. Draco, whose knee was still resting between Harry’s thighs, caught himself leaning his face towards Harry’s, eyes intent on his lips. He jolted back quickly. Not appropriate, Draco! he thought to himself.
She stood and stretched before dropping delicately onto Blaise’s lap. She toed off her shoes and propped her feet on Ron’s lap, wriggling her toes and raising an eyebrow. Ron sighed and began to massage her feet.
Harry raised an eyebrow in question. Draco offered his arm again. “I’ll be side-along Apparating you to the bar.”
They returned to the booth to collect their friends and jackets. “Draco!” Harry jumped up and threw his arms around the taller man. “You were gone forever!” he said dramatically.
He led Harry through the Manor, up to the balcony outside his office on the second floor. “I take most of my meals here, Potter. I hope that meets with your approval.” He had a funny feeling in his stomach he hadn’t felt in years. Why on earth was he nervous? It was just Potter.
Again, Draco, I'm not just waiting by my phone for you. I appreciate the help, really. Doesn't solve the problem of not having anyone to go with. Unless you might be able to help me out there too?
As they approached the club the group of men slowed down so Draco could cut through them to lead them to the bouncer. He kissed the familiar man on the cheek and asked after his family before being waved through.
“Because our first time will not be against a wall in a club with an audience while you’re drunk.” Draco bit Harry’s earlobe. “I shouldn’t even be kissing you when you’ve had so much.”
JadePresley, you are all shades of amazing. I wouldn't have gotten this chapter out (ever!) without you <3 Thank you for spending your spare time fixing my mistakes and telling me I'm not crap. You are so appreciated!
“What on earth is wrong with you, Potter?” Draco drawled. It was hard to look pompous on his knees but somehow, Draco managed to pull it off.
“I didn’t intend to, but he doesn’t know!” Pansy threw her hands in the air, inadvertently splashing the remnants of her drink over the heads of both men. Sighing in exasperation, Pansy waved her wand to remove the mess and gently put down her glass. “It’s not our business, but Draco, you have to understand that Potter-”
Was that you just avoiding me in the corridor, Malfoy? Why are you hiding?  Don’t be embarrassed. It’s cute :p
He could feel Harry’s hand trembling in his, and couldn’t resist any more. He pressed Harry up against the nearest wall. “Is this okay?” he ran his tongue along the shell of Harry’s ear.
What do you mean why? I’m not going to pump up your ego if you’re going to mock me and not even say yes.
“Hands on? Why would you ask-?” Draco caught himself. There had been something in Pansy’s tone. “What kind of guidance would I need to give Potter with my hands, Pansy?” he laughed it off. “I’m helping him to find dates, I don’t need to initiate him into the gay underground, for Merlin’s sake!”
“Absolutely, Tony.” Draco shot back a smile and hoped that he was agreeing appropriately. He had to get his head back into the game. Damn Potter and his hypnotising smile.
Jealous?? Not that you were meant to see that, of course, because I sent it accidentally. To you. It was an accident.
Just an educated guess. I haven't been there but the food looks good. I'd like to try it, but I don't really have anyone to go with. Can you imagine Ron at a place like that?
“Well, that’s what we kept calling it, but Harry was very emphatic that you hadn’t asked him out on a date,” Ron mumbled through his pastry, rolling his eyes. At least he wasn’t making eyes at Blaise again, Draco thought.
The two relaxed in the wicker seats on the balcony for a good long while. Draco was surprised at the ease in which they spoke of both general matters and personal. As they sipped on tea brought to them by Pippin, Draco realised that he was very much enjoying spending time with Harry one on one. They had similar views on most things - but not enough that their conversation was boring. He also found that Harry was very funny. Unlike Draco’s dry sense of humour, Harry’s smile was infectious and he shared it often. He asked lots of questions about Draco and how he grew up, and it was while answering one of these questions that Draco had grabbed Harry and pulled him to his feet to give him a tour of the castle.
What are you doing? Is anything exciting happening? Have you got a lead on that case you were working on yesterday??
“Oh, Harry was just telling us about the bloke he has a crush on,” Mitch shrugged and smiled. “He’s quite enamoured.”
Shaking his head at himself. Developing feelings for a friend was not a good idea. Just because it worked for Blaise and Pansy does not mean that that’s what usually happens. That was good luck on their part. So far.
Draco traced an invisible circle on the table with his fingertip. “Potter,” he began. “I am taking you to meet some friends of mine tonight that even Pansy hasn’t met. They don’t care who I am and they won’t care who you are.” He traced faster. “I was… taught at a very young age that Malfoy’s wore armour. We were to be unflappable, unshakable. That act takes a lot of work.” He stared at a point somewhere behind Harry’s head. “At one point I got tired of the act. So I made efforts to step out of my comfort zones. Mingled with Muggles and so forth. I met some wizards who also stepped into Muggle London for fun and, well, we became good friends. We drink together and go to the clubs. And, this, the me you’re currently seeing, this is the me that they helped bring out. Comfortable, relaxed. I don’t have to hide.” He chuckled and returned his eyes to Harry’s. “I’ve drunk so much with them I’ve been unable to, for the most part.”
Blaise made a sardonic remark and Draco allowed himself a smile. He sipped his mimosa and flicked open his copy of the Daily Prophet, breezing through the main news on the front page before letting out an inelegant snort.
So consumed with his thoughts, Draco hadn’t realised that Harry was pressing his entire body up against his side, tucked under the arm Draco had thrown carelessly over the back of the booth seat. As Harry tilted his head up to ask Draco a question, he was suddenly thrown by the jolt of desire that rushed through him. Harry looked like he belonged there, comfortable and happy.
Draco moved into the dark room and paused, letting the beat of the music move through his body. He closed his eyes and smiled, rolling his neck before once again pointing out their reserved seats on the outskirts of the bar area before making a beeline for the bar and setting up a tab.
Draco took a drag of the cigarette. “With who?” His stomach was in knots again. He didn’t really want to know. It was the old, selfish side of him which was saying I want him, he’s mine, almost overriding the voice saying he deserves better, someone more in his league.
Please don’t read too much into this, Malfoy, but I’ve been waiting ages to take you out. Trust me, I will not be dying (or getting cursed) today. Thanks for your concern
That’s not a compliment, you great preening git. You realise I can see you loitering in the corridor, right?
The group fell silent as a house elf popped in and out, removing all evidence of the brunch, leaving behind only water.
Are you texting me to remind me - as though I could forget - or are you checking to make sure I’m still alive??
Pansy sipped her mimosa. “What on earth would Draco and Potter talk about?” She raised an arched eyebrow at Blaise. “It’s not as though they are exactly peers, are they? Draco was just doing the poor thing a favour. Very selfless of him.” Her mouth twitched as Draco’s head shot up to pin her with a glare.
“He is,” Hermione said, eager as always to impart her knowledge. “Ron explained this to me the other day. There are two types of Mages. Those who train for decades to master a particular branch of magic, like Voldemort – he’s a trained Dark Mage – and then those who are born with an affinity for one of those branches of magic. They’re known as True Mages, or Natural-borns, like Cassandra Trelawney, Professor Trelawney’s great-grandmother. They don’t require any formal training to master their magic; it just comes naturally. But,” she frowned at Draco, “Harry didn’t manifest as a child, and he hasn’t had any kind of Mage training. So he can’t be a Mage. Right?”
He pulled his hand away, pressing his fingers into his eyes, hard. He refused to mourn the end of their relationship until he knew without a doubt it was over. It was possible Draco would never forgive him for what he’d done, but he had to at least
Ron and Hermione visited together. Hermione cried several times, and didn’t once scold him for giving himself up to Voldemort, though Harry had half-expected it.
Draco raised his brows. “You know, the more I learn about the past six years, the more I realise that the rumours of your exploits do not do you justice.”
He could still feel Harry; an echo of his once vibrant, inescapable presence, mocking him through the bond. It had not broken, even in death. His magic was everywhere, surrounding and enveloping his soul. He had touched Harry’s soul before, but now it was
anything. It wouldn’t even serve a purpose, now. Draco had defected, and Harry didn’t love him. It was just sex.
Madam Pomfrey took the shrapnel out of Harry’s back with a simple spell, and then insisted he lie on his stomach “for at
There was even a catapult, which Draco had been dying to try. He just didn’t have the time to restore it, what with the Vanishing Cabinet, and his task, and trying to keep up with his schoolwork and keep the professors off his back, not to mention bloody Potter...
“He’s fine,” Ron told her. “He’s with Malfoy.” There was a short pause, and then they looked at each other. Just like that, the tension broke. First a giggle, and then laughter, clutching their sides, tears in their eyes; a little hysterical, but laughter nonetheless. “That should
“Idiot boy,” he said, with a good deal more fondness than Harry thought entirely appropriate for a professor who hated his guts. “The slip-through in the wards is for the Alphas. Not you. You need every advantage you can get, even if – even if it will never be really
He glanced back. She was leaning forward eagerly, touching the Mirror. He wiped away tears, trying to focus. The branches had shifted again; another path, then. His future self was facing Dumbledore again, this time in a battle-scarred hallway. Draco felt sick. There was no happy ending for him, no matter how optimistic Pansy obviously was. How many paths was she going to force him to watch?
, was the only word Harry could think to describe it. “Oh, my darling,” she said. “Oh, my little dragon, I am so
Ron was by her side. Madam Pomfrey, Snape, Dumbledore and McGonagall were standing behind them. All staring at him,
offer, he’s admitting he knows Draco is working for Voldemort. Which puts Draco in an even worse position. That’s why he has to wait until Draco commits, one way or another. He’s been planning this, all along. To try to save Draco.”
Not far from the Room of Requirement, they came across the sound of voices. Ron held up a hand, and Neville almost tripped over his feet trying to stop in time. Luna steadied him.
Thank you to everyone leaving comments and kudos! Each one is very much appreciated. Also, Happy New Year! Let's hope for a better 2021 xx
He was right, Pansy realised. Draco’s eyelids were almost translucent, and his body – his body was twitching like a man in his death throes. “No,” she said, throat closing. “
Draco didn’t reply, shivering as Harry slid his robes off his shoulders, baring the mark he’d left on his neck during their DADA exam. It was a dark bruise against the pale skin, and Harry bent his head to it again, closing his teeth around the edges gently.
Dean rolled his eyes. “Well, don’t. I wouldn’t want to explain to Ginny why my lips are all swollen, especially when she hasn’t been near them in almost twenty-four hours.” He paused. “Speaking of –”
“I do know,” Harry said gently, but Draco just turned his head away. Harry bit his lip. “Would you really have let me go?”
“All right, time’s up!” Madam Pomfrey said, bustling over. “Off you go, Miss Parkinson. He’s not ready to hear this.”
There were spectacular displays at every window; dazzling comets, rockets with silver tails, flowers blooming in a rainbow of colours, fire-breathing dragons that made the children shriek as they roared towards the windows.
“Sorry,” Potter said, awkwardly. “I didn’t mean to make you think – I mean, of course I – but that’s not
sorry. It’s just, you were obviously, you know –” She flushed bright red. “And – and I thought we might not get another chance like that, to test our theory. And now, after seeing you Apparate inside school ground
“I wondered if you knew,” Dumbledore said, more tears slipping down his face. “It has been inside you almost your entire life. I believe it was an accident on Voldemort’s part. After splitting his soul so many times, it must have become unstable. When he cast that Killing Curse the final time, a piece of his soul must have detached itself from what was left of the whole, and latched onto the nearest living thing. Making you an inadvertent Horcrux, and Voldemort none the wiser.”
Draco pinched Harry’s side, a gentle but firm reminder. Harry shut his mouth again. “No. Dumbledore. And Snape’s true Alpha paid the price. The Dark Lord killed her, and her husband, and all Severus had left was the child that should have been his; a child with his mother’s green eyes and a lightning-bolt scar on his forehead.”
to guide him. That same feeling had only grown worse over the last year, whenever an Alpha not his own touched him with sexual intent. (The Snatcher who had caught them and taken them to Malfoy Manor had been the worst. Harry had vomited relentlessly for over an hour after the man touched him, until he was just retching in painful, dry heaves.)
He guided them through the maze of halls and staircases without hesitation; he knew every step, every creaky floorboard, every portrait, every secret passage.
He squirmed and moaned as each nipple was tormented in turn, his cock straining and neglected as Harry sucked and licked his way slowly down to his stomach, delving his tongue into Draco’s navel, thrusting in and out in a mimicry of fucking.
“Maybe it is,” Draco said, slowly. “But I don’t think there’s any sinister intent behind it, if that’s what you’re thinking. Even the most basic of bonds need consummation, and ours was no exception. We tried to deny that need, immediately after the bond settled. It was no wonder we were desperate. As for this recent need for intimacy...” He hesitated. “After what we just went through, it would probably be a normal response, even if there was no bond between us. But… I betrayed you. I denied our bond. I set in motion something that would have eventually destroyed it, if you hadn’t forgiven me.”
“We’ve been deceived once, Mr Potter,” Professor McGonagall agreed. “We all thought Severus was on our side, and now this.” She shook her head, eyes lingering on the man at their feet. “I just can’t believe it. A traitor in our midst, all this time.”
doing the kissing… But, no. They were hopelessly oblivious to each other’s feelings. Anyway, Hermione was just as taken aback by The Plan as Ron.
Draco, on the other hand, couldn’t get it up for a girl if he tried. And she knew that for a fact, unfortunately.
Malfoy’s head snapped up. “You sent my father to fucking Azkaban, Potter! Don’t pretend to care about him now.”
“Clearly the ‘measures’ deemed necessary by a Death Eater are far more extreme than those of law-abiding citizens,” Scrimgeour said. “Malfoy is following in his father’s footsteps, Albus. He is a danger to society, and this act has only proved that.”
hours, which meant another four hours without any idea what Draco was doing, or how close he was to completing his task, or if he was even all right.
“I’m not sure there’s much of a difference,” Pansy said. He snorted reluctantly, kicking off his shoes and outer robes to fling himself down in front of the fire, and Pansy marvelled as always at his easy grace. “You’re a Slytherin, Draco,” she said. “Have you forgotten that?”
Ron checked for his father; made sure he went through the door with Mrs Malfoy first. He herded the others in behind him, kept his arm around Ollivander. Didn’t dare look back. They stumbled down the narrow passage, elbows banging against the rough walls, hands reaching out to help each other, the sound of battle behind them urging them forwards, faster,
Draco frowned. “Of course you are,” he said, in a tone Harry knew meant he was just humouring him, and it brought him out of the sudden, blind rage. “Harry, love, are you feeling all right?”
“Is everything all right?” he asked quietly, as Blaise opened a door and peered inside. There was an undercurrent of anxiety in his tone, which didn’t surprise her. The Dark Lord was moving against the wizarding world, and news of disappearances, mysterious deaths and open attacks were growing in frequency.
. The Mirror had shown him that his fate was entwined with Harry’s, but it had also shown him that there were so many, many ways it could go wrong. So many of his choices had led to horrific outcomes. He had to get it right.
Harry ignored the Auror, frowning at Dumbledore. “You said I had to stay away from Draco until he made his decision, sir. You said you would offer him sanctuary then. You
,” Ginny said. The wound under Hermione’s fingers began to heal. “Can you move? Hermione? Are you with me? We have to move!”
Potter was framed in the doorway to the common room, his arm slung low about Draco’s waist. As always, Draco’s mere presence commanded the room, drawing the attention of their fellow students and diffusing it at the same time. They were aware of him the way birds were aware of a dragon circling in the air above them, their shivering bodies entirely focused on him, eyes darting towards him and then away, hoping not to be noticed.
“Close your mouth, sweetheart.” It was a little mocking, but it was the first time Draco had used an endearment for him since before the party, and Harry felt his whole body warm right through. “You made your bed with Slytherins. Now you have to lie in it.”
“Oh, very well,” Malfoy said impatiently, but there was a smile tugging at the corners of his mouth.
Draco flinched. “Potter, I mean,” he said. Snape’s eyebrows rose further, and Draco cursed himself inwardly. Of course that wasn’t what Snape meant. He had no idea about their messy breakup, or the reason for it. Pansy would never have confided her plan in him. Except… Draco eyed him in sudden suspicion. He’d warned Draco to be careful, hadn’t he? Just like Pansy had. “Did you know?” he demanded. “That he was never in love with me?”
“Much like our veins, or nerve pathways,” Malfoy explained. “Every single cell in your body is suffused with magic.” He traced a finger up Harry’s arm. “Our cores supply that magic through pathways. They can be obstructed, or re-routed – for example if you have an injury or illness, or there is an emotional trauma.”
Dean’s eyes widened. “Yeah? I guess that explains a lot. Gin says the girls call him the Ice Prince, even in Slytherin. Apparently he doesn’t put out. Ever. They say an arranged marriage is the only way that bad-tempered git could get a girl into his bed. Apparently for more than one reason, eh?”
Harry turned. The Slytherins were all gathering at the top of the stairs leading down to the dungeons. The little blond boy Harry had noticed earlier was weeping in Nott’s arms, and Adeline Cardosa was shivering on the outskirts of the group. As Harry watched, Daphne Greengrass put an arm around the little girl, guiding her down the steps.
He tried, after that, to pull himself together for his Alpha’s sake, to share his own grief with him and maybe try to heal together, but every time he did, that tormenting half-heat rose, prickling across his skin and consuming his mind with
“Of course it was.” She put her hand over his, urging him to relax his fingers. “I didn’t expect to See what I saw, either. But I can’t say I was surprised. The Dark Lord destroys
It was flattering, in a way. That Draco trusted him enough to let his guard down in such an intensely private way, in amongst a group of Gryffindors. Not to mention he needed every minute of sleep he got. Harry wasn’t cruel enough to wake him just to point out the state he’d left Harry in, with no way to relieve himself.
Harry pursed his lips. “If you really mean that, Draco, you can’t hide anything from me anymore. And you can’t lie to me, even if you think it’s for my own good.”
Then Dumbledore raised his wand, and they turned their attention to him immediately. Draco watched, frightened, as the formidable Headmaster was pushed back, step by step. He whispered the incantation to lift the Scorched Earth curse on the others, but it took time to recover from. Dumbledore was alone. He parried spell after spell, shielding and deflecting and casting counter-spells without a single word. Draco saw his lips move only when he murmured a particularly powerful spell, like when a violent wind whipped up around him, and his eyes shone.
It flew into her hand a moment before the Dark Lord echoed the spell. She only just managed to keep a hold of it.
Harry looked at her, and then at Draco. He was curled up on the ground, sobbing. “He lied to me, Hermione. He –” his voice broke, “k-kissed me,
, Harry. You have Dark wizards fighting for your side, just as we have Light wizards fighting for us.”
, in front of his friends – in front of all his classmates, and oh sweet Merlin, even Malfoy was looking at him now, and he couldn’t look away from those grey eyes, and he was
The werewolf howled, twisting mid-air. Snapping and snarling, it caught Ron in the shoulder, crunching down with powerful jaws.
Harry pushed the glasses up his nose, and then blinked at his Alpha, confused. “What happened?” he said. He’d been hungry and sleep-deprived and in so much pain that only now it was gone could he recognise just how bad it had been. He felt
Blaise arched an eyebrow. He looked as exhausted as the rest of them, with a thick layer of grime they had all accumulated from the dust in the air. Pansy was suddenly reminded of the fact that she was wearing little more than her underwear. “No?” he drawled.
But that meant he couldn’t meet Snape’s eyes now. He couldn’t risk his Head of House coming to suspect that perhaps he was a little
Harry’s eyes narrowed, and unthinkingly, he made a sharp little gesture with his hand. The pile of blankets transformed into a king-sized poster bed with smooth cotton sheets, plump pillows, and blood-red curtains that hid them from the rest of the Room.
,” she stressed. “And, Draco?” She held his gaze. “You should know, whatever your decision, I will stand with you.”
Dean shoved him over, kneeing him in the stomach in the process. Winded, Seamus could only gasp for air as Dean leapt on top of him and slammed his shoulders into the floor, grinning. “Yield?”
“Oh! Right.” Harry glanced down at his textbook, hoping for inspiration. It was just a list of ingredients.
Harry felt his stomach revolt. Was that really what Ron thought? That Dumbledore had given him some kind of – of secret
Pansy shook her head. “No,” she said, her eyes burning. “No, Draco. I prayed to the Founders, to Merlin himself, that you would be strong enough to get through this without losing your heart. But you’ve always been half in love with him, under all that hostility. He didn’t love you, not then, but he was attracted to you. I knew there was a chance, given a nudge in the right direction, that something might develop between you. And I was right. I was
“Fuck me,” Draco said, arching his back. “And maybe I will.” Harry rolled his hips, and Draco gasped. “Potter, please!”
Blaise let his smirk widen a little. “The one where I join Pansy in convincing the other Slytherins to defect with Draco to Potter’s side, in exchange for a date. With everything that entails, of course, as she said.”
“Beethoven composed for them, didn’t he?” Harry pointed out. He still had hold of Draco’s hand, and he used it to tug the other boy into his arms. “So,” he said, intrigued by this insight into the rigidly pureblood Slytherin, “you like Muggle music. That’s not something I would have guessed.”
swallow each, and you will have to follow Madam Pomfrey’s instructions to the letter.” He held up the bright green one. “This will illuminate the paths of magic in your bodies, and direct you to follow them to your cores. This,” he held up the other one, filled with a thick, dull yellow liquid, “will allow Madam Pomfrey to follow you in.”
on her voice. Her companions jumped, looking alarmed, but Pansy didn’t care. If the Death Eaters were holding the kids nearby, maybe it would draw them out. “We need help. Please. We’re fighting an army of thousands, and we need everyone who can fight. You-Know-Who has taken twenty young children. He’ll kill them if we don’t get to them in time.”
A low snarl caught his attention, and he scrambled backwards, an involuntary cry of terror rising to his lips. “No,” he whispered. “No-no-
“Alive,” the Dark Lord said. “For now. Whether they remain so is entirely dependant on your behaviour. For example,” he smiled, “if you don’t get up on that table in the next ten seconds, I will hang ten of them upside-down from the trees and watch their blood drain from their throats.”
She regretted telling him it was all right to do it on Draco's birthday. How would Draco ever be able to see past the cruelty of that to forgive him?
Draco pushed himself up to his knees, wincing. “The army is here for Hogwarts,” he said. “They don’t care about a few stray kids. If your charm holds, they won’t hunt us for long.”
Harry whirled, thrusting out his hand defensively, only to lower it again sheepishly when he remembered that Lucius Malfoy wasn’t his enemy. It was instinct, still, apparently, even after all Lucius had done for the Order, and for him personally. “Oh. Mr Malfoy,” he greeted, stiffly. “Sorry, sir. How are you?”
Harry smiled. “Likewise.” He kissed down to Draco’s collar-bone, nipped it gently. “I want you again.”
He had no allies left standing. Even Theo, who had surely been out of the range of the Scorched Earth spell, lay limp and unconscious over Daphne’s body.
“His connection to Hogwarts as its Headmaster has broken,” Draco said. “The lodestones are hidden by ancient blood magic. The Headmaster is the lynchpin, linked to the previous Headmaster; an unbroken line all the way back to the Founders. Whatever’s happened to him, he didn’t transfer the guardianship to Professor McGonagall. It’s the only way the lodestones could have been left exposed. He is likely dead, or nearly.”
“Harry,” Hermione said, firmly. His eyes snapped to hers, and he swallowed down the panic and the tears spilling down his cheeks. “That’s right,” she said. Her voice was calm and soothing, and he could feel himself beginning to breathe again. “We’re sorry, Harry. You’re right. This isn’t the time. Right now you just have to make a very simple choice: either you spend this heat with another Alpha, or you take a risk on your mate. I assume, if you decide to mate, that you can still take the contraceptives –?” Madam Pomfrey nodded. Hermione frowned a little, turning to Dumbledore. “Actually, is there any reason you couldn’t put the spells on his true mate? Then they could spend this heat together without consummating the bond immediately –”
Pansy’s lip curled. “Blaise just wants another notch in his bedpost.” And, of course, to make her jealous, although he knew from past experience it wouldn’t work. He continued to amuse himself trying, however. Pansy had no intention of telling him that with every conquest, he made her a little more determined that he would never call her his. “That’s all.”
“We’d need an army to break down that front door,” Bill Weasley said. His arm was around his mother, who was pale and quiet. Arthur and Percy were both inside the Ministry.
He walked around the table, tugging at the ropes with a finger. They could not be the conjured sort, for this ritual, but Voldemort had woven spells into the fibres that would hold even against the most determined of assaults.
He felt disconnected, out of step, like a dissonant chord or a note played in the wrong song. Because he was Magic, he was the storm, but he had a name, and a body, and someone was drawing him down into their arms and cradling him tenderly. His hair dripped into his eyes, and his face was wet, but it wasn’t rain.
, Draco thought, bleakly. He didn’t ask why Finch-Fletchley had attacked him. It didn’t matter. “Will you tell the Dark Lord?”
,” Draco said, meeting Harry’s eyes. “If you can get it out of the Manor, it could mean everything to us. I think Jeremiah’s research could be the key to making sure Harry survives this war.”
“Why is she here, Ron?” Harry asked. “Why did St Mungo’s just throw them all out? Where are the Healers? Why haven’t they come back to help?”“Didn’t you hear?” Ginny said. She was across the room from them, carefully tracing her wand in a series of loops over a pale-faced girl with auburn curls. She looked as exhausted as Harry felt, but she barely looked up, her eyebrows drawn together in grim determination. Harry thought he recognised the girl; a Gryffindor in Ginny’s year. Alexia something. “St Mungo’s has declared a state of emergency. There’s been attacks, all over the country, all at the same time. Hogsmeade, Diagon Alley, the Millenium Bridge... St Mungo’s can’t cope with all the wounded. They’re asking anyone with space and any kind of medi-wizardry training to take those stable enough for transport through the Floo network.”
“Promises, promises,” Draco said breathlessly, struggling to get Harry’s finger inside him. “Will you just –”
Snape sneered. “I trust you have all completed your essays on the differentiation between the Sleeping Curse and the Sleeping Charm and associated healing charms of a similar nature. I remind you that deliberately large handwriting or spacing between paragraphs,” he looked at Ron this time, who flinched and scowled, “
like him,” he said, surprised at how easy that was to admit. But then, maybe that was the key. Parkinson wouldn’t have come up with this plan if she didn’t think he could do it. Unless she intended Malfoy to see right through him, for some nefarious, as-yet-unknown purpose.
Harry screamed again, thrashing against him, his arse clenching and releasing rhythmically as he struggled to find purchase, friction,
“I’m sorry, ma’am,” Harry apologised, also for the fifth time. But like every time before, he stayed stubbornly where he was. He hadn’t let go of Draco once since the Room of Requirement. As soon as Madam Pomfrey had directed them to the beds, he’d climbed up next to Draco and pulled him back against his chest, arms tight around him.
Harry tensed as it opened, and two Aurors walked through, escorting a boy who seemed dwarfed by the huge courtroom. His shoulders were hunched, his head down, and he shuffled in with his hands and legs shackled by thick iron chains. “Merlin,” Harry said, his breath catching in his throat.
Draco stopped, leaning against the wall to watch them. Faeries settled in his hair and on his shoulders, and he lifted his hand to let them play on his fingers.
“Stop,” she said, pressing a gentle hand to his upper back. “I know. But it’s over. We won. You have to stay still now, Harry.”
“I, on the other hand,” Blaise taunted gently, “have won. Move along, Finnigan. Pansy is mine tonight.”
Severus bared his teeth in a grin. “This particular procedure requires a high level of physical and mental effort on your part, Mr Potter. Mr Malfoy, at least, I am sure is up to the task.”
. Yet his chest was still split open, his heart lying in the grass next to him. It was – oh Merlin, it was sick, it was
Harry looked him up and down. “You look fine from where I’m sitting,” he said, playfully. He waited a beat, and then said, “Still, I certainly wouldn’t object to a little more to grip, when I fuck you.”
Draco turned his head to look at the bedside table, where Potter had left the box of chocolates. His favourite, again, and it made his heart skip a beat when he thought of
She smiled back at him, tears suddenly filling her eyes and spilling down her cheeks, making tracks through the dirt and grime. “We did it,” she agreed. “Oh Merlin, Harry, we
Hermione’s throat tightened. Madam Pomfrey would never leave her patients behind. She’d die first. How many, then, would be killed while they lay unconscious, unprotected, in their beds?
“Blimey, mate,” Harry said. Not that he hadn’t known this was coming, sooner or later, but he really had hoped they’d keep the sickeningly sweet declarations to themselves.
“No,” Harry said. Ron was right about that. He had to be. “It’s just something he said. That if he deserves to be loved, so do I.”
, in your case, Mr Malfoy. And perhaps some chocolate. I have a fresh batch just in from Honeydukes. Just one moment...”
Harry was tempted to ask him what had taken so bloody long. He was well aware of what hate and fear could motivate people to do. Head Auror Robards had lost his wife to Voldemort, and there were dozens of Aurors under him who had fought in the last war, many of whom had no doubt lost friends and family, colleagues and partners. And now there was another war brewing, and people were already dying, or going missing – including Robards’ son.
Blaise considered that, maddeningly unruffled by her ire. “You know, I don’t think I am,” he decided. “Don’t get me wrong, it was fun while it lasted. But that’s all it was; a bit of fun. Don’t take it personally, Gin. You’re lovely, from a certain perspective, and no one could deny you’re a spitfire in bed –”
“What, so you could kill that one too?” Ron said, bristling. “What are you up to, Malfoy? Practicing the Killing Curse on small animals now? Planning to use it on one of us? On
Merlin help him if Harry ever realised just how much power Draco was handing him every time they fucked.
, instead of – why didn’t you go to McGonagall? Flitwick? Hell, if you knew the way into the Chamber of Secrets, you could’ve called in the Aurors! Vanquishing Dark creatures is
“Infirmary,” Harry echoed, his body going limp with relief. Snape was practically manhandling him up the hallway, but he felt oddly safe. “What’s happening to me?”
Harry watched him go, observing the way his shoulders tensed as he neared Ron and Hermione. Once upon a time, he never would have noticed that. Or, if he had, he would have assumed it was simple dislike, or maybe that Draco was readying himself for another round of barbed insults. He knew now that it was fear. Fear of a threat to his task, his mother, his life. It made Harry wonder when Draco had stopped being afraid of him.
Harry was silent, but his shoulders began to shake, and something painful twisted in Draco’s chest. He’d never seen Harry like this before. Tears soaked into his tunic, silent but unremitting; an outpouring of grief and guilt that rocked him to his core.
Gone was the pale, sickly Slytherin of a few weeks ago. Malfoy’s cheeks had filled out a little, his eyes were bright, and his hair had a healthy shine to it again. He looked cold and arrogant and unapproachable; truly the king of his domain.
Voldemort’s laugh was chilling. “Of course. And now I have granted your mother her freedom, and my clemency, will you pledge yourself again to me, as your father did before you?”
“Er,” Harry said, caught off guard. “Yes? I don’t condone what he did, obviously. But Dumbledore said there's a risk they might sentence him to the
Draco didn’t reply, but his hand tightened around Harry’s. He didn’t let go for the rest of the day.
Seamus jotted some notes down, tested the pH of the soil just to be sure, and then drew a quick sketch of the newly-potted Dittany of Crete. It was a pretty plant, native only to the island of Crete, and had immense magical and healing properties. As a result, it was considered a rare and extremely valuable plant, and a licence was required to even obtain the seeds. Professor Sprout only allowed NEWT-level students to handle the precious plants, and even then she kept a sharp eye on all of them.
“Precisely,” Slughorn said, pleased. “Five points to Gryffindor, Miss Granger. Now, due to the complexity of this potion, you will be working with partners…”
Snape glared at him. “I am not blind, Potter,” he said, harshly. “Did you really think you could fool me? I have been marking your essays for six years. I know your style of writing, the way you string your paragraphs together – extremely poorly, I might add. Not to mention the spelling errors you make, time and time again. I even know when Miss Granger has assisted you in the proof-reading, or should I say,
Hermione lurched forward, taking his face between her hands. “Harry!” she said. Her eyes were brimming with tears. “Listen to me. Draco got you
Draco sighed. “Yes. I do. Because I feel exactly the same way. Which means one of us is going to have to compromise, and since your way is to commit
Harry could feel himself beginning to shake. He thought he was probably going into shock. Twice in one week; Madam Pomfrey
“Me too,” Harry said, surprised. “I mean, my mum was Muggleborn too, but she died when I was little.” He smiled awkwardly. “Which I suppose you know. I grew up with Muggles, though, so I guess that’s where I learnt it.” He paused. “Come to think of it, my cousin Dudley
“Mine,” Pickering said softly, and Harry frowned a little, because really, those eyes were lovely, but he couldn’t help picturing a different set of eyes; beautiful grey, darkening to storm-grey when he was angry or very aroused, softening to dove-grey when he was particularly happy or content. He imagined the horror that would fill those eyes when his mate realised he'd submitted to yet another Alpha, and felt sick bile rise in his throat.
Harry felt tears spring to his eyes, and he tried to blink them back. When that didn’t work, he hid his face in Draco’s shoulder. Draco just kissed his hair, picking up his book again.
Draco blinked. “Harry,” he said, in a tone meant to convey ‘you daft sod’, in the fondest possible way, “it’s five o’clock in the morning. Just light the bloody fire, will you?”
Pansy looked back at Draco. There was blood in his hair, on his robes. “Draco?” she said, heart lurching. “Is that –?”
Harry breathed out, something tight in him easing. “I’m so happy for you,” he said. He looked at Robards. “Your son, sir?”
“Yes,” Draco said. He noticed Greg, huddled in a corner. His shoulders were slumped, his face blotchy, like he’d been crying. Draco’s heart lurched, but there wasn’t time. “The Room of Requirement?” he asked, as Ron fell into step with him.
“Mr Potter has admitted to casting a Disillusionment Charm outside class time, with the intent to make people think he and Draco had disappeared,” Snape said coolly, only his black eyes showing his malicious enjoyment. “He will be serving detention every night for the next five days, due to his involvement of Mr Malfoy in the prank without Mr Malfoy’s knowledge, and the fright he gave so many of the other students.”
,” he said again, and in one last, frantic attempt to prevent the inevitable, he screamed out Draco’s name through their bond.
. It missed Greyback, who crashed into a large dresser, toppling it. But it grazed the arm of another Death Eater climbing out of the cabinet. Yaxley. He fell.
“We all made vows,” Millie said, unconcernedly. “We’ll all keep them.” She had finished her own dessert, and was eyeing Pansy’s. Pansy pushed it over to her gladly. Her appetite was well and truly gone. Millie raised her spoon in thanks.
engage any Death Eaters who happen to be down here. Keep yourselves safe, but let us do the fighting. All right?”
“Well, they do now!” Harry said, pulling roughly out of Draco’s grasp. “Bloody hell, Malfoy! Who the fuck do you think you are?”
“You all right?” Greg said, tentatively. “Only you look like the Bloody Baron just passed right through you.”
He sat up, shifting onto his knees so he could examine the paper more closely. Ron and Hermione’s names were at the top, and had the most timeslots. He smiled, running his eye down the page.
“You didn’t mean to,” Dawlish repeated, hysterically. “Minister, he needs to be arrested! There must be a law –”
?” The question burst from him as if it had been boiling under the surface for days, and Harry made himself wait a beat before answering.
. “Please,” he whispered, his voice thick with tears. “Please, oh Merlin, please help me, someone –”
He flinched. “No. I’m sorry, Mother. I – I did fix the Vanishing Cabinet, but I couldn’t go through with it. I defected, in exchange for Potter’s promise to protect us.”
“Here,” Potter said, and put something small and delicate on a chain into Draco’s hand. Draco’s gaze dropped to it, and his heart skipped a beat. “It’s a Time-Turner,” Potter explained. “Well, you probably know that. I got it from Professor McGonagall.”
taught about Wild Magic. You just don’t take any of the right subjects. Magical Theory, or Ancient Runes, or Arithmancy. But that’s beside the point. I’ve never heard of anyone older than twelve using the Wild Magic without a ritual and incantations, or a runic circle, or some other magical means. You don’t even use a wand.”
Harry stifled a grin, well aware that everyone within earshot was straining to hear his reply. He was struck by the sudden, devilish impulse to dissemble. “Is what not true?” he said, innocently.
Harry’s face darkened. “Fuck, no. Scrimgeour’s already allowed too many miscarriages of justice in his name. I’m not going to let him continue in mine. Besides, you were arrested for Carrow’s murder, not the use of an Unforgivable. I’m not going to stand back and let you go to Azkaban for something you didn’t do. I promised to protect you once you defected, and I won’t go back on my word.”
“I mean it,” she said, obviously warming to the idea. “You’d only be confirming her suspicions. And then she might actually be able to move on.”
“I know,” Harry returned, very gently, pressing a kiss to that white-blond hair. It was, unfortunately, as light and soft as it looked, and he dragged himself away reluctantly. “Sleep for a bit, yeah?”
Charlie dropped down beside them, putting his back to theirs. “We’re here for our family,” he growled.
“Draco didn’t do anything, Professor,” Nott said, rising to his feet. Daphne was sitting next to him, looking between Harry and Malfoy thoughtfully. “It was all Potter!”
“Ginny’s a big girl,” she said, firmly. “You have no right to go after Zabini. Not unless he hurts her, and even then that's debatable, and dependent entirely on her wishes. She was okay, wasn’t she, Harry?”
Weasley reached them at that moment, catching her up in his arms. “Merlin, Merlin!” he babbled tearfully. “
Foolish, inappropriate urges rose in her. To tell him she’d never slept with Blaise. To tell him she loved him. It wasn’t the time, of course. But what if there was never another opportunity? “No,” she said. “You don’t know –”
Dumbledore, Alastor and Dawlish met them on the stairs. The Atrium was guarded, but Alastor knew of a secret passage created by the Aurors during the last war.
“I wouldn’t be here otherwise,” Rosmerta assured her. “Minerva, I’m sorry. I’ve been under Imperius since October.”
Dean, who had been bitten by a werewolf, and then evacuated to Hogsmeade along with Charlie. He’d already endured his first full moon, and had only been allowed to go home because there weren’t enough Aurors to guard the Ministry cells. He was not permitted any visitors for one year, due to the anti-werewolf legislation. Ginny was devastated.
“That’s nice, mate,” Ron said, in that maddening way adults sometimes had of vaguely praising a child’s drawing without ever truly looking at it. “But Hermione’s right. We should be prepared for anything.”
“Centaurs, for example?” Draco said. He held up a hand, counting them off on his fingers. “Werewolves, quoles, chimaera. Trolls, definitely. Kelpies, too, I’ve heard. Hippogriffs, probably –”
Lupin and Bill exchanged a look. “All right,” Bill said, making his decision. “That’s good enough for me. Let’s go.”
“I’m yours,” he agreed, enjoying the words as they rolled off his tongue. After everything they’d been through, he deserved this. Deserved Draco.
There was no escape. He had no choice but to lie there under his Alpha and feel him pump his cum deep inside him, spurt after spurt after spurt, unending.
“I don’t know,” said another voice. Ginny stiffened as Dean Thomas folded himself down onto the grass next to them. “I think there’s something to keeping it in one’s House, so to speak.”
“You can try,” Draco allowed. “If you can talk at all by the time I’m through with you, then I’m doing it wrong.”
“Worried about Hermione, I know,” Harry said. “Believe me, I hate the waiting as much as you do. At least all of Atwood’s crew have been flushed out now, right? No more spies inside Hogwarts.”
, no, too small. Infirmary bed? It wrenched out of her grip, slamming onto its side. Someone grabbed her, dragged her behind it.
Pansy relaxed. It wasn’t a declaration one way or the other, but it was something. “I think the Headmaster already suspects him,” she said. “But he can’t, or won’t, offer him a way out, and I need someone who
Room, Draco,” he said. “It’s where we first made love.” He kissed him quickly, just a little peck on the lips. “It’s where we had our first proper date, with candles and music and chocolate. Remember?”
It was a date and time, nothing else. But it was Draco’s handwriting, and it was Draco reaching out to him, and Harry’s heart soared.
She waved her wand, and the scarves fell, vanishing before they hit the floor. The other students startled, looking at them in surprise, and Pansy realised there had been a subtle Notice-Me-Not Charm woven through Trelawney’s ward. Clever.
The morning after Harry’s vision of Voldemort and Remus, he went to Dumbledore and demanded another rescue mission to Malfoy Manor.
He knew, in the back of his mind, that he should be working on his task, but the idea of failure had put down its poisonous roots in his mind at last, and he couldn’t bear to think about it for a moment longer. He just wanted to close his eyes and melt under Harry’s fingers, and pretend that nothing else mattered.
“I’m not going,” Pansy told them. Her voice sounded strange to her own ears, as if she was hearing it through water. “I need to observe the rites.”
“He would have been as lenient as possible,” Malfoy acknowledged. “But he’s been covering for me all year. He warned me a month ago that any further infractions would have consequences even he couldn’t protect me from. You saved my arse.” He glanced at Harry with a complicated expression; of reluctant gratitude, and deep relief, and a kind of – yearning?
Snape and McGonagall hurried in immediately, and Snape wasn’t gentle as he pulled Terry off and shoved him off on McGonagall. “Potter,” he said.
Harry breathed out, surprised and grateful. “I really am sorry, sir,” he said. “And I – I don't want to make any promises, because I don't even know if it's possible, but I will try my best to get him back.”
Potter smiled at him. “You’re welcome to. Anyway, it was me Dumbledore warned off, so I don’t see how they can punish you.”
“Oh! Oh, no,” Draco shook his head and resumed his walk to the entrance hall. He held his arm out for Harry expectantly.
Half an hour later Harry was stepping through the fireplace with an armful of clothes. Draco, who had been sitting on the couch across from it immediately lost his composure. “What the hell, Potter!”
Draco didn’t waste any time. He offered Harry his hand, who blushed and accepted it, allowing himself to be pulled close to the blond’s body. Draco dropped his hands, guiding Harry’s around his waist before settling his own on the shorter man’s hips. They danced to the heavy beat of the song, the muggy heat of the club causing sweat to glide down their skin. As the song morphed into another, the beat of this one slowing encouraging the men to move their bodies closer to each other’s. Draco’s eyes had closed as they moved to the rhythm, but the popped open as Harry pressed his body right up against Draco’s. Bright green eyes met icy blue and time stood still.
