"No its where are you going! Here's your bag leave," Neville demanded.
We were talking about our creature inheritances. The night before, we felt our submissive come into their inheritance and we now are trying to figure out who it was or could be but we didn't have any clue of who it was. "There are 3 owls heading our way," Draco said.
·∂†·¥º·¥ø·¥≥·¥±·µÄ ·¥µ·µÄ! ·µû·¥º·µÅ ·¥¥·¥¨·µõ·¥± ·¥¥·¥¨·¥ø·¥ø·µû ·¥ø·¥±·¥π·¥±·¥π·¥Æ·¥±·¥ø?
!" He called out.
"Yes! Now here are the 5 year old clothes! Are you five?" Draco tickled Harry.
Quickly signing it Draco left the store.
"Yah, I know," Neville sighed, "I'll just never be good at potions."
"Draco? Are you sure that you are ready for such a responsibility?"
"Ok!" Harry said, "but I don't know any movies?"
"He no hurwt you wite?" Harry asked.
Lastly I had on a 2 piece dress and it was beautiful.
"This is so cool" Draco said with an look of awe .
"Draco!" She calmly said as he sat down on his bed.
"Whoah--" Draco said startled what the hell happened to this kid?
"Send the bill to Malfoy Manor, please.." he said.
‚Äò‚ÄôReally, I don‚Äôt want you to meet new people either, ‚Äò‚Äô muttered Draco as they exited the old man‚Äôs office, Draco just give up trying to speak to them and tell them that the Slytherins wouldn't except them. The last six to seven years were bad enough, they all insulted him for not killing Famous and Good POTTER and the rest he was just the traitor Malfoy, of course he wasn't ! He was the great Draco Malfoy ! But all of that would change for the worse now that he was bringing Po - Harry into the Slytherins dorms.
They walked off together leaving Draco and Harry by themselves.
"Why not? Snape loves you!" Draco laughed picking Harry up. "I need to go in so you do to, you know the rules boo," Draco looked at Harry.
Lastly my father went, he was 6'0, pale and blush color lips.
"I live dare," Harry sounded bored more than scared what crap has this kid gone through? "Now let's wead stowy!"
Our house also had a massive front room by the door.
"Little boy!" Draco was now being playful.
"What? Lemme explain, your not letting me explain!" Neville cried.
Draco went downstairs and saw Harry playing with a small elephant he called Bunbi.
"Yes, Madam..." Draco had forgotten about last night until right now when he saw a woman which seemed to resemble Bellatrix?
Hermione felt her face where Pansy had cupped her hands when they kissed.
The child had a strange way to speak and pronounce things, but to Draco it was very cute how Harry used w's instead of r's.
"It's on his back..." he said.
"No, Harry, Draco has to get ready for-" Draco stopped himself it was Saturday there was no school today.
And now the trick or treating has began.
Tom Riddle (Angel of Darkness)
"Yah, but thwen you fwight thwem off wike in the stwowys!"
"I'M THE TICKLE MONSTER!" He yelled.
"Why are you trying to hang out with me?" Draco tried to act strong and fierce but the truth was he was ecstatic that HARRY POTTER might want to hang out with him!
When class was over Draco asked, "what did you draw sweet boy?"
Draco picked him up and carried him to Draco's room.
xxxxx
Had Pansy just bailed?
‚Äò‚Äô No baby Potter - ‚Äò‚Äô Draco started before Harry put his hands over Draco‚Äôs mouth.

"She says Ron had been threating her to be that cruel..." Neville sighed.
<~><~><~><~><~><~><~><~><~><~>
"No, no, I don't need an explanation just let me see the damage?" She chuckled.
We made our way to the kitchens where we saw Draco, Aiden and Severus making out.
"No, of course not it's important!" Hermione smiled.
"Okay," she looked startled at all the harm on the small child! " here Draco take this cream and put it on him at least once a day for a week and then you can come check back on in? How does that sound little boy?" She looked at Harry.
Hermione waited in the Three Broomsticks, waiting for her date, she had worn a bright green dress which popped and deep red lipstick, she had pulled half of her hair back into a bun to create a prettier feeling.
The first owl landed in front of Draco and I and the others landed in front of Tom and Severus. I opened our letter and Draco looked over my shoulder to read the parchment and what was written on it.
on..." he spilt out that secret and than quickly silenced himself.
"And hello little boy!" Pansy hugged Harry, she loved him with all her soul.
Draco motioned for the older two to come to the kitchen as Harry laughed and waddled over as well and he couldn't see how worried the three teens looked.
I awoke to tapping on my window. I try to get out of our bed without trying to awaken my mates. I opened the window and saw an owl with what I thought was a letter, but it wasn't it was a Howler. I quickly went over to my mates and woke them up. They looked at me with sleepy eyes until I showed them the howler. They blinked at it until Severus took it from my hands while Tom pulled me into his lap so that I was in the middle with them cuddling me and Severus opened the howler.
Prince
"Not today boo, I brought colouring paper and crayons!" She handed Harry some paper and crayons.
"Oh my dear lord what's happened here!?" She looked utterly astonished.
Harry sat down with a large thump, leaning against the cold stone wall with a sigh.
"Who ya writing to?" Hermione asked.
Draco ran after Harry.
"It's the best candy ever you'll see!" Draco winked at Harry who giggled uncontrollably!
"Pleassse!" Neville begged.
Draco put Harry into his room and kissed his scar.
Last chapter
"Who might you be?" Lucius asked as he walked closer to me "A-id-en Lup-in Bla-ck " I managed to say. "Can you tell us why we are here?"Professor Snape asked.
Tom had on a red suit.
2 lounges.
"Oh you poor, boo boo," Pansy picked up Harry.
üëáüëáüëáüëáüëáüëáüëáüëáüëáüëáüëáüëáüëáüëáüëá
"Let's go, " Tom said and took Aiden's hand before walking to Ollivanders. "Welcome back Mr Potter or is it Mr. Black?" Ollivander asked. "It's Lupin-Black" Aiden told him.
I saw what he had on and knew it was the cause of the scene. After They all greeted us. Aiden started making breakfast which was absolutely amazing to everyone.
"Well than let's get one arranged!" Pomfrey looked surprise.
"No I didn't need to!" Snape hissed, "Now if you excuse me I'm searching your dorm!"
"Nothing, let's get this shirt on you...." Draco slid it on to him and Harry fit it to size. Well as well as he could.
try to walk up my arm to sit on my shoulder and I helped him get to his destination. "Can you change back?" I asked Aiden. My little Quis Fortis shook his head no and started to fall asleep on me. "Can we actually start moving tomorrow and get some sleep?" I asked my mates quietly not to disturb Aiden from his sleep. Instead of someone answering me, Tom took us to his bedroom and we all fell asleep, but not before I put Aiden down. So that we could make more progress tomorrow.
"Come over here Potter! What are you doing over there?" Draco spat at the ground.
Harry excitedly grabbed the popsicle and took a good long lick of it.
I was surprised when someone came up behind me and started kissing my neck, but quickly turned to see Draco. I started to kiss him while Severus went to my neck. From the both of them I was in a lot of pleasure. I gasped sharply when Severus bit down on my neck and knew that it was to leave a mark on me which I didn't mind, but I knew there was a lot more to come.
"Ronald is a bitch, he's kept me from Harry, from accepting him, telling me to do stuff or else! I hate him!" Hermione sobbed.
‚Äò‚Äô Why would you be in the closet ? ‚Äò‚Äô Draco asked again.
"Hi, Pans!" Hermione waves her down.
"Gwate Dwaco I mawde a Lwego stwuctwure!" He smiled pointing at a tall structure built out of rainbow bricks.
In the muggle world, it was a bit different; some hated, some liked and others just didn't care about it.
"Where's Harry?" Draco asked.
When Draco turned around Harry was already fixing his clothes his shirt and pants were already on but now he seemed to be making them fit on him?
I put the blue one on my pointer finger on my left hand. I put the red one on my right ring finger and then put the green one on my right pointer finger. I only had the yellow ring left and then I put the yellow ring on my left middle finger. Once they all were in place they disappeared from view. "I can contact your mates for you, while you go shopping," Bloodfang said as he was writing 3 letters.
"Boo!" Ron shouted from across the room throwing papers at the group.
"Yes, boo boo," Draco smiled as Harry expertly put on his shirt and pants still to big but better fit for him.
I was waiting for midnight to come, at midnight it would be my 17th birthday. Right now I was laying down in Dudley's second room on the bed trying to recover from my resent beating from my uncle Vernon.
"My baby!" Draco cried!
I'm sorry, it might take a while before I can update again. I have not been feeling well for a long time and it's getting worse and not better.
"You are the last one to wake up" I told him. Lucy simply nodded and got out of the bed pulling me with him. Together we went through our morning routine and soon we were done. I had on red joggers and a white shirt ,while Lucius had on light blue joggers and a white shirt .
Harry giggled dropping the book, he was hiding.
"Well then get over here!" Draco said.
"What is it?" Harry asked.
"Hey, I did that just for you!" Hermione laughed.
"No, no, he's being re - aged tomorrow I need to keep him close."
The drinks soon arrived and they dived into their drinks.
Sure enough later on that night Harry cried from out of his room about Vernon chasing him with a stick. Draco comforted him telling him it was just a dream and there was nothing to worry about but Draco himself thought that there might be something other than that keeping the kid awake.
"Neville, I hate you. I don't care what you think, Hermione has her explanations, it's all Ron who's in the wrong, and you! You are just a piece of dirt." Pansy snarled and walked away.
‚Äò‚Äô Who is uncle Vernon next to the great Potters! ‚Äò‚Äô Draco said,he didn‚Äôt like the Potters , but everybody knew that they were great people and no one would argue with that.
Eventually everyone got bored and left a bruised Harry Potter.
"What creature is he?" Asked Tom towards Bloodfang.
But not by magic, no by what seemed to be a bullet he looked right at her and her bloody body and immediately felt her pulse to see if there was a heartbeat there was!
"Dey no like Dwaco?" Harry cried.
"You are beautiful tonight they both said in synch then laughed for a few minutes.
"Hey! You two get a room!" Draco laughed.
"Draco you need to go to Madam Pomfrey!"
He watched as Pansy stood up and left the coffee shop.
I would have to get my ears pierced, but I was going to do that anyway "How much is this all together ma'am?" I asked the owner of the store. "Everything you want is 750 Galleons all together." Madam Malkin said. I gave her the amount, plus 50 more Galleons extra as a tip and everything she had done for me. Next I went to a Magical ear piercing place and got the ear piercings that I wanted.
"I will..." Draco said, he wasn't really he just needed Neville to stop talking about it.
She stood up and checked her appearance combing back some of her crazy fuzzy hair, and smiled in the mirror. This is what she wanted all along!
Draco sat down and began to watch a wizard show on a network he had just found. And started to prepare for a long night.
Harry's least favourite.
Black
"Ok!" He rushed away starting his daily routine.
I had pale skin and red lips with long eyelashes and black eyebrows, but what shocked me the most was the wings that were the same blue as my eyes with black lineing.
When eight rolled around Pansy and Neville left.
Snape
"Your signature sir?" He held out a paper.
"It's 7:30 Harry let's get ready for bed,"
Pansy smiled they sure have grown a good connection.
He climbed the stairs of the third floor carefully, accurately measuring how far behind the boy he should walk, after all he didn't want the boy to know that he was fallowing him.
"With who?" Neville pressed.
Neville grabbed his sleeve rolled up revealing an arm full of scars.
Draco looked down at the brown haired boy, he now held in his arms.
‚Äò‚Äô No Draco, I think that you will do just fine with what you are provided and all of your fellow Slytherins will help, ‚Äò‚Äô Dumbledore shoved off his complaint without even hearing him out.
"Look what I have here guys!" She put on a baby voice, "whittle Harry Potter!!!!!" The entire common room cackled and started jeering and laughing throwing stuff at him and teasing him, Harry was crying he couldn't understand what was happening!
at age 5 months
"Uh- uh- uh" Draco stuttered on his words. "why do you care?"
Love potion to Ginevera Weasley
I'm sorry, it might take a while before I can update again. I have not been feeling well for a long time and it's getting worse and not better.
It was fun dress shopping with Aiden, he looked beautiful in all the dresses that he tried on. We were done, when Aiden pulled us all into the big dressing room. "I want to see you all without the Glamours on," he said. Without answering him, I made sure the door was locked and had silencing charms on before I dropped my Glamours.
"Hi little Harry! What brings you here today Mr. Cutie face?" She asked.
"Oh Drake...." Neville looked down, were those? No they couldn't be! "Draco could you roll up your sleeves?" Neville asked sheepishly.
They weren't near any of the shops, they were right at the neighbourhood area.
I did what he told me to do and ended up at Diagon Ally, the very first place I went to was " Robes for all Occasions". Where I got silver ,blue ,purple ,and Black floor length robes. They fit me perfectly in all of the right places, giving people a look at my body, but they wouldn't look for long after I meet my mates . But there was something that caught my eye, it was a dress with a matching cloak and earrings.
"Why would you be in a closet?" Draco asked.
"Works like a charm," Draco laughed.
Dumbledore calmed.
"Remember put the shirt on right actually let's get your cream done shall we..." he grabbed the cream and spread it over Harry's back, which was so full of scars it hurt Draco to see it.
"C'mon, kid it's time for potions."
I mean it made sense, to Hermione!
Severus went next, he was 6'2 and he was also pale with pink lips
Lucius and Draco Malfoy (Dark Veelas)
Within hours Bellatrix was taken to Azkaban stuff was not looking good for the blonde in fact he had a questioning next month! But he had Harry he had the best time with that silly kid. He said the funniest things and was just plain adorable!
"What does he have?" Draco asked.
Hermione sat at her bed in her dorm room.
"Sir, may I please be excused for a moment?" Harry asked the Professor.
"No, you see, Nev, you got these two sections mixed up... Hey guys!" Pansy waves at the two signalling to come sit.
"Sir, may I please buy everything in the baby department?" He asked.
"No Draco, I think that you will do just fine with what you are provided and all of your fellow Slytherins will help you," Dumbledore shoved off the complaint,
"Why don't we go out?" Hermione smiled while asking the question to Pansy.
"Wow! Where's Harry? All I can see is a chicken!" Draco laughed.
This caused the vial to tip over and caused a drop to go onto Harry's water bottle that hadn't been enclosed into the vial... Draco startled picked up the vial not noticing the liquid seeping into Harry's water bottle and quickly sat it up right.
"What do you bloody mean Potter is a bad name, it's yours!"
Draco turned pale.
"Yes?" Hermione smiled at her.
"Oh you!"
He first saw a flat screen TV which he knew muggles used to watch their shows and movies on and a long comfy green couch with a soft red carpet which didn't clash at all surprisingly, making his way to the kitchen he saw a list of things he would never learn how to use and instead he would just use magic he made his way to his bedroom which already had all his clothes there folded neatly it was a green room to represent Slytherin but noticed a slider which could change the colour of his room to whatever he wanted, he changed it to a soft grey colour which reminded him of his room at Malfoy Manor.
"I towld hiwm no! But he didwn't wisten! He twouched mwe!"
"What?!" Draco screamed.
"Drake! This is not okay!" Neville was so worried.
Harry immediately took a liking to this.
"Okay!" Harry smiled walking a bit more steadily now.
"Hawwy want dem to be Dwacos friend!" Harry smiled rushing down the stairs he climbs on in occupied chair in the common room clearing his throat he said, "wisten! Wisten! I Hawwy, and i wuv Dwaco! I wawnt you guwys to wuv him to!" He smiled looking like he convinced the crowd, unfortunately not all took favour to the small child espisially the eighth years, "Oh go get a life Draco don't force your baby to take car of you!" Blaise yelled.
"Umm, I don't know bud, maybe half an hour?" Draco grinned down at Harry.
Your mates have arrived at Gringotts.
"POMFREY!!" Draco was shouting at the top of his lungs but no matter how much he screamed there came no response from the office.
Malfoy
"Ya, but tomorrow you'll be five!" Draco smiled.
Harry rushed over, "So what do ya wanna do Draco?"
"Yes.... but wait how do you know?" Draco asked.
"Oh no! Hawwy kill Dwaco no no no Hawwy no want to kiwl Dwaco! Hawwy wuv Dwwaco!" Harry sat on the ground and began crying a good puddle was created before Draco stood up and picked up the boy.
"Cool!" Draco said as he came towards me and his father.
Pansy!
"Oh you shouldn't have!" Pansy put her hand on Hermione's arm.
"I mean not in this life!" He added.
"Dearie! I just finished sending off an owl to Dumbledore why don't we leave little Harry here for the night?"
Pansy was going insane.
'' I don't think you have the right to know that, Sir, '' Harry said with as much malice as he could muster, his chin jutting out with defiance.
The next owl was from Hermione she had sent me an book on shielding charms.
"Here lemme help you put on the shirt backwards..." He lifted off Harry's shirt revealing what looked to be scratches against his back and marks up his spine.
"Harry, we are having eggs and toast!" Draco said trying to control himself.
"I don't know Harry, why don't you ask?" Draco asked Harry.
"Buddy calm down, I was just joking!" Draco picked Harry up.
He leaned down to kiss me making me melt into him and kiss him back. The kiss was slow and tender, I knew this was what I ¬†have wanted from the start.
"Class dismissed," Snape said quickly his face looking worried, "Malfoy stay," Snape hissed at Draco.
Draco was panicking, his back had started bleeding, he was now about a foot taller but that badly affected his scratches.
‚Äò‚Äô Pottew a bad name! ‚Äò‚Äô Harry said whispering to him as if the little boy was telling Draco a big secret.
"He went out with BLAISE! BLAISE!!!" Pansy was balling.
I was the first to wake up and was spooning Lucius. We were all cuddling (even if I hate to admit it). In the middle was Aiden, then Draco and Lucius on both sides of him, then Tom and I on either sides of them.
half neko /
"Boo boo, tomorrow your going to be five!" Draco smiled.
True fully Bloodfang the Head of Gringotts.
I got out of the bed silently and went to do my daily routine. Once done I put on a pair of black joggers and a white shirt to be comfortable while moving everything. Even though we had magic, magic couldn't be used on potions or ingredients, so I had to do it the muggle way and be very careful with my precious ingredients.
Neville walked out from where he was hiding.
Snape stomped out muttering under his breath.
Hermione sat beside her.
unblocked
Peverell
To Lord and heir of the noble House of Malfoy,
Draco wondered if the boy even understood what he was saying himself.
Draco shut his eyes and rolled back his sleeves, where what seemed to be a million cuts were showing on his wrist.
I Now had hair that went below my butt and it went well with my eyes.
I JUST WANT YOU ALL TO KNOW THAT I MAY NOT POST FOR A WHILE I AM ENTERING MY OWN ORIGANAL BOOK ABOUT A VAMPIRE ON BOOKNET FOR THE NEXT THREE MONTHS.
I've been waiting for a long time for our submissive to come into his or her inheritance. It doesn't matter if our mate is male or female. I will love them any way.
And sure enough sitting on the couch was Neville.
"No, no, no, Hawwy thwee!" Harry shook his head and showed three of his tiny fingers to Draco.
Draco watched Harry leave and than sat twiddling his thumbs.
The next owl was from Mrs. Weasley and Ginny, they had sent me a lot of home cooked food but all of a sudden I sniffed the air and smelt an oder coming from the food which smelled like bad potions and didn't eat them .
"Dwaco pway wiff Hawwy???" Harry asked.
*****
Adopted by illegal Blood Adoption Potion and no witnesses.
"Yah!" Harry laughed.
"Not right now cutie," Draco smiled.
Dumbledore asked the boy, doubt could clearly be heard in his voice.
Draco put Harry down Harry ran to a small toy bin in the corner of the room, and Draco began to explore.
It was a little weird that my father was one of my mates but I was getting used to it quickly. I went to do my daily routine, then put on a pair of grey joggers and a white shirt, to make my way to the kitchen, to see Severus and Aiden kissing and just stood there watching them make out for ¬†a while.
"Yes Dwaco?" His voice clearly shaking.
"Screw slow! So will you?" Hermione was worried what if she said no? What would happen then?
Loyalty potion to Ginevera Weasley, Molly Weasley and Hermione Granger.
I was a kitten even though I was 17 years of age. After a while of watching my mates, I knew they had forgotten that they had magic, so I meowed as loudly as I could to get their attention , but it only caught Lucius's attention and he looked down at me, just as a look of realization crossed his face, he bent down to pick me up, he ¬†started to scratching behind my ears making me purr. I was so relaxed smoothing waves of my magic poured out of me. My mates almost turned into puddles of goo at the feeling and turned to me and Lucy.
He leaned down to kiss me making me melt into him and kiss him back. The kiss was slow and tender, I knew this was what I ¬†have wanted from the start.
And as he snapped out of it they were right at Zonko's.
Pansy grabbed her face and they were kissing, they knew they both wanted this and now they were getting it.
"HARRY!" Draco yelled.
"When you were a FORMER death eater you know your way around these places." Pansy smiled.
"Uh... Ok?" Harry said nervously.
"Look, food!" said Ron.
"Who?" said Harry as they backtracked quickly.
"As you see, we are holding our wands in the accepted combative position," Lockhart told the silent crowd. "On the count of three, we will cast our first spells. Neither of us will be aiming to kill, of course."
Myrtle eyed her suspiciously.
Harry remembered Justin‚Äôs odd behavior in the hallway, and his mood sank further. ‚ÄúI think some people think it‚Äôs me.‚Äù
Several people in green robes were walking onto the field, broomsticks in their hands.
"Oliver," he croaked. "It's the crack of dawn."
The majority of the hall, including Harry and Ron, cheered. Hermione was dancing on tiptoes. "Do you think he's all right?" she squealed through her fingers.
Harry wasn't sure what made him do it. He wasn't even aware of deciding to do it. All he knew was that his legs were carrying him forward as though he was on casters and that he had shouted stupidly at the snake, "Leave him alone!"
"Don't lie to me," Myrtle gasped, tears now flooding down her face, while Peeves chuckled happily over her shoulder. "D'you think I don't know what people call me behind my back? Fat Myrtle! Ugly Myrtle! Miserable, moaning, moping Myrtle!"
Harry remained silent, ruminating over the new developments. It might be time to break out the invisibility cloak again.
"Because they're here in person," said George, pointing.
The following Saturday, the three friends were crossing the entrance hall when a call stopped them.
Wood wasn't pleased.
Myrtle, in what Harry could only assume was the greatest display of positive emotion she‚Äôd ever done, nodded cheerfully. ‚ÄúOh yes- we‚Äôve known each other since the start of term! I‚Äôm still trying to convince him to share my toilet if he-‚Äù
Snape stepped forward, waved his wand, and the snake vanished in a small puff of black smoke. He, too, was looking at Harry in an unexpected way: It was a shrewd and calculating look, and it made him uncomfortable. He was also dimly aware of an ominous muttering all around the walls.
‚ÄúHe‚Äôs been acting off since we saw him before term; didn‚Äôt rush to insult any of us, just kinda stood there. It almost looked like he was leaning on his dad for support. Have you guys noticed that he‚Äôs not picking fun at any of us either?‚Äù
‚ÄúWhat do you mean?‚Äù Harry asked, still dazed from the new knowledge.
‚ÄúOh,‚Äù Seamus said, scratching the back of his neck. ‚ÄúSo I‚Äôm a halfblood, right? Dad‚Äôs a history professor at Trinity College- that‚Äôs a Muggle college in Dublin. He‚Äôs been doing some extra study on the Victorians recently, an‚Äô he‚Äôs picked up some of their slang. Death‚Äôs head on a mop stick is one of the only ones that stuck for me- means a sickly, emaciated lookin‚Äô person.‚Äù
He mounted his broomstick and kicked at the ground, soaring up into the air. The cool morning air whipped his face, waking him far more effectively than Wood's long talk. It felt wonderful to be back on the Quidditch field. He soared right around the stadium at full speed, racing Fred and George.
"Trust me," said Ron. "We don't want to be found here."
The wall of green parted to reveal a short boy with pale skin and dark hair, whom Harry recognized as Theodore Nott, another second year.
"I don't believe it!" Wood hissed in outrage. "I booked the field for today! We'll see about this!"
They had barely turned around, however, when a little man swooped suddenly from under the table and came to a halt in midair before them.
The long dining tables had vanished and a golden stage had appeared along one wall, lit by thousands of candles floating overhead. The ceiling was velvety black once more and most of the school seemed to be packed beneath it, all carrying their wands and looking excited.
"What's that?" said Harry quickly.
She nodded again. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs what we suppose. Of course, it could be anyone at school.‚Äù
There was a tug on the back of his robes. "Come on," said Ron‚Äôs voice in his ear. "Move - come on -"
"But you haven't really got to know Mrs. Norris," Ron told her bracingly. "Honestly, we're much better off without her." Ginny's lip trembled. "Stuff like this doesn't often happen at Hogwarts," Ron assured her. "They'll catch the maniac who did it and have him out of here in no time. I just hope he's got time to Petrify Filch before he's expelled. I'm only joking -" Ron added hastily as Ginny blanched.
Harry shifted guiltily in his seat. He had been unconscious in the hospital wing for the final match of the previous year, meaning that Gryffindor had been a player short and had suffered their worst defeat in three hundred years.
"What, drop my wand?"
"Can't hurt to have a poke around," said Harry, dropping his bag and getting to his hands and knees so that he could crawl along, searching for clues. Hermione and Ron followed suit.
Yawning and shivering slightly, Harry climbed out of bed and tried to find his Quidditch robes.
"Oh, no, Peeves, don't tell her what I said, she'll be really upset," Hermione whispered frantically. "I didn't mean it, I don't mind her - er, hello, Myrtle."
Hermione awkwardly cleared her throat. ‚ÄúSo‚Ä¶ you two know each other?‚Äù
By the time Halloween came around, Harry was about ready to scream. Tailing Malfoy was impossible!
‚ÄúInteresting?‚Äù Ron gasped. ‚ÄúHermione, she- she called him
". . . kill . . . time to kill . . ."
"Oh, Ron, there won't be anyone in there," said Hermione, standing up and coming over. "That's Moaning Myrtle's place. Come on, let's have a look."
‚ÄúNo you‚Äôre not! Draco‚Äôs told me about you- how he used to bully you last year and how he‚Äôs been trying to make peace and be left alone this year, but nooo, you‚Äôre always trying to follow him and find out what he‚Äôs
I do steal some stuff from the books. Just throwing that out there.
"You've got a new Seeker?" said Wood, distracted. "Where?"
"Myrtle, no one wants to upset you," said Hermione. "Harry only -"
‚ÄúWait,‚Äù Harry said, leaning forward on his hands. ‚ÄúDid my dad‚Ä¶‚Äù
And then Harry heard it.
"I expect they've let it rot to give it a stronger flavor," said Hermione knowledgeably, pinching her nose and leaning closer to look at the putrid haggis. Despite her outward calm, her dark skin had taken on a decidedly greenish hue.
Hermione giggled.
Hermione put her fingers to her lips and set off toward the end stall.
"Shouldn't we try and help -" Harry began awkwardly.
She let out a wail. ‚ÄúOh Merlin, I wasn‚Äôt supposed to remind you! We were going to have such a nice evening, and I‚Äôve gone and ruined it! I‚Äôm so sorry, Drakey- I should have just stayed in my toilet!‚Äù She zoomed off, and Malfoy hurriedly nodded once to the trio of Gryffindors and started after her, crying out for her to stop in his ragged voice.
"What's bad?" Harry was starting to feel quite angry. "What's wrong with everyone? Listen, if I hadn't told that snake not to attack Justin -"
"Exactly," said Ron. "And now the whole school's going to think you're his great-great-great-great-grandson or something -"
"I wasn't paying attention," the ghost replied, still sniffling. ‚ÄúI felt absolutely
"I heard you speaking Parseltongue," said Ron. "Snake language. You could have been saying anything - no wonder Justin panicked, you sounded like you were egging the snake on or something - it was creepy, you know -"
"No - honestly - didn't I just say how nice Myrtle's looking?" said Hermione, nudging Harry and¬†Ron painfully in the ribs.
wrong with him, Myrtle?‚Äù
I hardcore headcanon Harry as half-Indian.
‚ÄúI don‚Äôt remember what my book said, and my study partner only knows so much‚Ä¶ All he could say is that it‚Äôs a legendary room in the school that was built by-‚Äù
Harry‚Äôs morning came to a rough start when he found himself being shaken awake by none other than Oliver Wood, the Captain of the Gryffindor Quidditch Team.
‚ÄúOf course they would,‚Äù Ron said, shrugging. ‚ÄúThey‚Äôre idiots.‚Äù
‚ÄúMyrtle,‚Äù Draco interrupted, looking uncomfortable. ‚ÄúI-‚Äù
"What's up?" said Harry as the ginger pressed himself into the opposite wall like he wanted to pass through it.
‚ÄúStudy partner?‚Äù Ron interrupted. Hermione ducked her head, cheeks flushing.
Lunch was coming up, so they trooped out of the library together, heading towards the Great Hall. On the way there, however, Harry stopped, peering down the corridor where Mrs. Norris had been found. It was deserted.
As Wood launched into a speech about his new tactics, Fred Weasley's head drooped right onto Alicia Spinnet's shoulder, and he began to snore.
"So this year, we train harder than ever before. Okay, let's go and put our new theories into practice!" Wood shouted, seizing his broomstick and leading the way out of the locker rooms.
Snape was looking murderous. Lockhart finally seemed to notice, because he quailed and changed the subject. ‚ÄúA-anyway, enough of
He looked over his shoulder. Ron was standing well back and seemed to be fighting the impulse to run.
Moaning Myrtle burst into anguished sobs, but a voice stopped her from zooming away.
‚ÄúDraco!‚Äù The ghost girl beamed and hovered her arms around him in a semblance of a hug. ‚ÄúI thought you wouldn‚Äôt come!‚Äù
"So," said Wood, at long last, jerking Harry from a wistful fantasy about what he could be eating for breakfast at this very moment up at the castle. "Is that clear? Any questions?"
"Well, there you have it!" he said, tottering back onto the platform. "That was a Disarming Charm - as you see, I've lost my wand - ah, thank you, Miss Brown - yes, an excellent idea to show them that, Professor Snape, but if you don't mind my saying so, it was very obvious what you were about to do. If I had wanted to stop you it would have been only too easy - however, I felt it would be instructive to let them see . . ."
"They're starting a Dueling Club! First meeting tonight! I wouldn't mind dueling lessons; they might come in handy one of these days‚Ä¶‚Äù
Charms had been going smoothly enough. Harry‚Äôs quill was halfway to the shade of royal blue that he was trying for, but there was enough time in the lesson to finish. Of course, Draco Malfoy just had to ruin it.
Harry blushed. Growing up with the Dursleys, he‚Äôd been kept far away from all knowledge of his father‚Äôs family. He knew that the Potters were originally from India, but not much else. ‚ÄúErm‚Ä¶ nothing, really. I‚Äôve wanted to learn.‚Äù
"Now, listen here, you lot," he said, glowering at them all. "We should have won the Quidditch cup last year. We're easily the best team. But unfortunately -owing to circumstances beyond our control -"
And ignoring the large OUT of ORDER sign, she opened the door.
"I spoke a different language? But - I didn't realize - how can I speak a language without knowing I can speak it?"
‚ÄúI‚Äôm afraid that won‚Äôt be possible,‚Äù Snape drawled, but something was off about it. He almost sounded worried. ‚ÄúMr. Malfoy has been practicing dueling since he was old enough to hold a wand; he‚Äôd make mincemeat out of Mr. Potter before they‚Äôd even begun.‚Äù
Ron snorted. "I always knew Salazar Slytherin was a twisted old loony, but starting all the blood prejudice nonsense? That‚Äôs just the crown jewel- I wouldn't be in his house if you paid me. Honestly, if the Sorting Hat had tried to put me in Slytherin, I'd've got the train straight back home.‚Äù
Wood was holding up a large diagram of a Quidditch field, on which were drawn many lines, arrows, and crosses in different colored inks. He took out his wand, tapped the board, and the arrows began to wiggle over the diagram like caterpillars.
"So?" said Harry. "I bet loads of people here can do it."
"Who's that?" said Fred.
Unlike the ghosts around them, Peeves the Poltergeist was the very reverse of pale and transparent. He was wearing a bright orange party hat, a revolving bow tie, and a broad grin on his wide, wicked face.
Then someone shouted through the quiet.
Harry smiled at his friend‚Äôs reply. Ron always knew how to raise his mood.
"Look!"
"Haven't even started," said Harry, eyeing the toast and marmalade Ron and Hermione had brought out of the Great Hall.
Harry looked up nervously at Lockhart and said, "Professor, could you show me that blocking thing again?"
"Who cares?" Ron asked.
"I've got a question, Oliver," said George, who had woken with a start. "Why couldn't you have told us all this yesterday when we were awake?"
"What?" she asked sulkily.
Despite the early hour, he couldn‚Äôt help but be refreshed by the morning air. The day was already promising to be cool and crisp, and the fresh smell of the world after a night of rain made the inhumane practice time almost worth it.
Harry's mouth fell open.
I am not claiming ownership of any of this or of the characters.
Rose sighed. "Not as much as I should be, I think, as a teacher. More as a parent. It was very dangerous, and you've only been studying magic for barely two months. Then there was a Muggleborn, who statistically has even less experience than you. At least you had Draco, though. Lord knows Lucius probably taught him as much as he could." Rose shook her head and shifted her weight, and Harry smirked a little as he remembered what Draco had said. "Regardless, I think that was enough excitement for one night. We'll do the ritual in the Come and Go room and then it's off to bed with you."
The day after Halloween, Snape was absent from breakfast. Absent from everywhere, really, as no one saw him all through the day. Harry had a suspicion that wasn't confirmed until he walked into Potions class - a double class with the Third-year Slytherins and Gryffindors - seeing his bright-haired aunt instead of the tall, brooding professor.
It was years later, and Rose and Severus were closer than ever. Rose was having a blast teaching her students about how to defend themselves against the Dark Arts, and a certain pair of Weasleys brightened up her classroom tremendously; as soon as she saw them, she knew they were Molly‚Äôs kids. However, she knew this would be the year Harry would start at Hogwarts. Thinking it over didn't take long, and she told herself to inform¬†Dumbledore that she'd like to simply be an assistant professor or a tutor this coming year. She didn't think she'd be able to focus on teaching since she'd be fawning over her nephew, making sure he was completely happy at the school as she was.
Harry had changed from his school robes into one of the tees (the black and green striped one) and a pair of Muggle joggers, leaving the black socks on his feet, to help Rose decorate. The tree she had wasn't a real one, but it sure felt alive with magic. The usually green pines were silver and the whole thing hovered about a foot off the ground. They strung green tinsel around it and added little snowflake ornaments to the limbs. There were a few that looked like they were made by a kid, and Rose explained that she kept some of the ones she and Lily had made when they lived with their parents. She put up a Muggle photo of her and Lily at their home, one of Lily and Snape at Hogwarts, one of Rose and Snape in her flat, and a Wizard photo of Harry's parents kissing in the snow. It was wholesome in a way Harry didn't know how to take.
"You're not using magic for it?" he asked.
"So, magic is always more about intent and will and less about the words and incantations. Of course, enunciation and pronunciation¬†are key, especially in rituals and large-scale exhausting magics. What was giving you trouble?"
When Rose returned to her flat from the Muggle store - run by a Muggleborn couple, of all people, so they had intimate knowledge on blending in - she kept only a few bags out for Harry to open and hung the rest in the closet. Since Harry was still young, she charmed the bed to shrink for now and grow along with Harry, always giving him just the right amount of room to stretch out and feel comfortable. Deciding to wait until Yule so she had Harry's input, she grabbed the few unopened bags and used the Floo to return to her quarters.
He saw the pinched, worried look on Rose's face and wanted to smooth out her eyebrows. "I know," he stated softly, and Rose nodded. She sat the helmet on his head and strapped it for him before she climbed onto the bike itself, adorning her own helmet.
"Alright," she nodded. "Well, your mother and I were twins, and Petunia's a year older. The day we got our letters she was furious, since she didn't get one when she was eleven. Mother took us to Diagon Alley and left Tuney with Dad." She remembered those days well, getting the letters in January when the snow was fresh outside, then the warmth of the summer when they got their supplies. "The first time I saw the train I thought I would faint. It was all so surreal, like I couldn't believe that magic existed, that
‚ÄúNo no no, Harry. Not about regular, Muggle school. About
Harry laughed at his best friend and looked back at Hedwig ( who had been stealing pieces of his roast up until that point ) with sparkling eyes. She hooted at him and nuzzled his hair lovingly before flying back to the perch in his room, likely to snooze in the presence of Mewt. With a smile still playing at his mouth, Harry finished his leftovers and placed the dish in the sink. He refilled his cup and turned to the living room, where his breath was stolen from him in the best way.
That was the last conversation Rose had had with her nephew. Rose didn't trust his words. Petunia absolutely hated her and Lily, so why would Vernon be any different, especially with how they acted when Rose and Hagrid showed up? No, Rose made up her mind. She was going to take him to King's Cross when September rolled around, with birthday presents in tow. She had made up her mind.
Rose returned to the snake den to see Severus and Harry standing outside, the former leaning on his right leg. "Hey, you okay to join us for the ritual, Muffin?"
Draco took it with surprising grace. "Draco Malfoy. And it's Harry Potter, right? Professor Rose is your aunt?" Harry nodded, hoping Draco wouldn't act like those people from Diagon Alley. Draco saw his expression and smirked a little, reminding Harry of Rose. "I won't pester you about the whole Boy Who Lived rubbish- no offense, sorry. My father told me you probably wouldn't like being reminded."
"Fourth year," she said. Harry nodded.
Harry's eyes felt dangerously misty, and he bowed his head in an effort to hide it. "Thank you, Aunt Rose," he managed. "This is a lot," he added after a calming pause.
And that Dumbledore. He never checked in on Harry or told him about magic? The Dursleys wouldn't, the wizard should have
"Do go on then, Potter. Don't keep us in suspense," Blaise blinked with a dry drawl, and Harry had to withhold his second snort.
welcome to the product of the hellscape that is my mind. god rest ye merry souls.
Rose gave him a pinched look while his head was down. She didn't want to think about Petunia's horrid parenting skills during such a festive time. She glanced back down at the menu in her hand. "How about something simple to start? Sweet and sour chicken from the Chinese place is just fried chicken with a dipping sauce. Fried rice goes pretty well with it. How's that sound?" Harry nodded mutely as he straightened from the island and hooked his hands together in front of him. "Alright. Then I'll get a wonton soup and a house fried rice," she murmured almost to herself. She circled the items with a pen and moved to where a phone hung on the wall. Harry hadn't even noticed it. Did Rose live in a Magic or Muggle neighborhood? Was the Chinese place run by - wixen, did she say? - or Muggles? While she was ordering over the phone, the fireplace flickered with green flames and a letter shot out of it, landing in the basket on the floor. Harry tilted his head and walked over to it. It had Rose's name written in black ink that didn't swirl as much as McGonagall's. Who could it be from?
"Oh, Muffin." Rose wrapped her arms around him in a light hug, and Harry brought his arms around her as well. She held him close and breathed in the smell of his hair. It was so domestic and
‚ÄúWhat world?‚Äù
disappeared.
Their seventh year at Hogwarts drug by slower than imaginable. Lily and Rose, though they may have strayed during their years due to the separation of houses and the obvious rivalry between the two, were brought back together and stuck close to one another. They tried to just forget what happened, but being called a name so horrible stuck with Lily for quite some time, and Rose never quite got over the fact that her best friend insulted her sister.
‚ÄúHagrid, you didn‚Äôt have to knock down the door,‚Äù she said with a faint smirk on her face. Once the dust cleared, she looked forward and saw Harry. Her breath quickened. ‚ÄúHarry,‚Äù she said in amazement. He looked exactly like her sister. She walked more inside the shack and stood right in front of him. Crouching to his level, she placed a hand on his head. ‚ÄúYou look just like your mother.‚Äù
Harry smiled. "Yeah, she said that's where she got a lot of the crystals. Are dragons rare? Do they really breathe fire? Have you ever seen one?" he asked in rapid fire, and soon the boys became lost in conversation.
Harry let out a little laugh that came out more choked than he thought it would, and then there was something coming out of his eyes. He held the journal out as not to cry on it and wiped at his face, turning his nostalgic expression onto the man beside him.
"Why something like that would be within the walls of Hogwarts escapes me," Blaise mused, stroking his chin.
"Haythim?" he asked, eyebrow lifted.
‚ÄúAll what?‚Äù Harry asked, and that was the last straw for both the witch and the ex-wizard.
Harry looked down, thinking. The fact that Rose knew it would be best to keep his things with her struck him a bit. He held his snowy owl and raised the cage a little. "My owl, and I guess my wand."
"-which means that Harry Potter is the Marauder's son!"
"Thank you Pin, again. I'll want another list by the end of the year, just the ones he liked the most though, like top twenty. Can you do that?"
Harry gained a focused look on his face. Before he could open his mouth, Rose smiled and waved her wand. "I know just what you're thinking. I was the same way, and still am. Here's a pass for the Restricted section so you can read to your heart's content. I will be available for any and all future questions." A note formed out of thin air and landed on the table in front of Harry, permission scrawled in Rose's beautiful writing.
"There's that word again,
As if Vernon could tell either Hagrid or Rose what to do. Hagrid shook with anger, and Rose brought Harry back a few steps, for safety. Every syllable was spoken with rage.
"You know?!" they both whisper-yelled.
Rose led them back out into Knockturn and brisk-walked back into Diagon. "Those were some very powerful crystals you picked out, Harry. I'm excited to see how they react to each other."
Two had Harry's name on it--his full name. One was from Snape, which surprised him more than seeing him that morning at the Malfoys'. Inside the black box, underneath the green ribbon, was a detailed Potioneer's journal with all sorts of notes scribbled in the margins. Before closing it again, he noticed the same ownership as the book in Rose's lab.
Rose showed up at her sister's house early on the first of September. She'd borrowed Hagrid's motorcycle since it had a side-seat, and she put the rest of Harry's things in it. She did not want to draw unwanted Muggle attention to herself, so she wore black jeans, a purple T-shirt with the words
Rose looked at Harry, at his pale, zig-zag scar that looked eerily like the movement one would use to cast the Killing Curse; not that she would ever admit to Dumbledore, the Light enthusiast, that she knew of such curses.¬†Her chest tightened as the thought of the night Lily and James died.
Well, not
"Good day, Draco."
The boys shuddered and ran in front of her into the Great Hall. Rose shook her head and walked along the outer table, where Harry and Draco were sitting. Harry brightened as she approached. "Professor, do you still have time to help me?" he asked.
She said it so nonchalantly that Harry's eyes went wide. "Would he really do that?"
They sat outside and Rose put up a privacy ward around them; she described it as a notice-me-not.
) room? He had to pet the stones around his neck before he could form a response. "Yes, I'd like that." He hefted his trunk onto the bed, which bounced slightly under the weight of the trunk and Harry grinned to himself when he imagined how soft it was. He set his bag down next to it and glanced at the photo before returning to Rose in the doorway. The witch caught his glance.
"Ugh, it's Malfoy. What're you scheming today, you slimy snake?!" the boy demanded. Harry's frown became more pronounced.
Rose smiled. Another Wizarding tradition Harry could witness, and he could learn a lot from the Pureblood couple. "We'd both be delighted. Congratulations again, Marcy. I'm sure your father is very proud."
Rose looked down at Harry, who lifted his wand from his pocket. Rose held it in between two flat palms for the wandmaker to note. "Hm, yes. Eleven inches, and does it suit you well enough?" Harry wasn't expecting to be asked a question directly, but he nodded regardless. The witch narrowed her eyes and looked him over, and he resisted the urge to smooth his hair down over his scar. Eventually, she nodded and waved her hand to summon a rack of different woods. "Hold your hand over the woods."
cloak, that shimmered with magic just like Rose's dress did. The clasp was a deep red and fashioned into a rose as beautiful as his aunt. The witch smiled warmly at her best friend and threw the cloak around her shoulders, pulling her hair up once it was clasped. The rose clasp was somehow the exact shade as Rose's hair, which made Harry grin too.
"Did you know that my aunt was a dragon tamer and rescuer before she became a teacher?" Harry asked, and Draco's eyes went wide.
about the Dursleys.
"Thank you," he managed to croak. If his eyes were watering, he couldn't feel it. Rose's own eyes might've been watering too, but she hid her face in his hair as he did hers and she held him fast to her. It was an amazing gift, as well as his other gifts from all his friends, but this ‚Ä¶ Having his
in Defense and Transfiguration." Rose threw him a smirk and exited the cosy room. "The door across the hall is the bathroom and the one down at the end is my room. I have a lab and practice room, which are the doors on either side of mine, that I frequent over the summer."
"And that should be the last one," Rose said as she strung up one last snowflake to the tree. She stepped back from it, smoothing her hands over her soft black leggings, and stared up at her masterpiece. Harry joined her a couple steps back and gazed up at the magic tree. It was truly spectacular, and more festive than Aunt Petunia ever got. He looked back up at his witch aunt, who had changed into a sweater opposite to him- green with thin black stripes. "Now," she said, turning to him and giving a smile, "dinner. I don't really feel like cooking, so I was thinking takeaway." She walked to the kitchen and pulled open a drawer full of menus. She hummed as she looked through her choices. "Thai, Chinese, Mexican. I can't choose. Harry, come help me."
"Alright, the food will be here in half an hour. They have a wizard who works there who always delivers to me. Statute of Secrecy and all that." Rose waved the menu, removing the pen marks from it, returned to the living room and nearly plopped on the couch. "Oh, is that a letter for me?"
"Did you know that your aunt and my father were at Hogwarts together?" Draco asked in a softer tone than he used with Ronald. Harry shook his head. "My father said they didn't get along at first since she's a Muggleborn, but Mother told me that it's because Professor Rose told him off that they actually became friends." That made Harry laugh a bit. Sounded just like Rose.
"Hello," he said to Harry, eyes wandering. "Hogwarts, too?"
‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs wrong Dumbledore? You didn‚Äôt just come to ask me to come and teach, did you?‚Äù
"Did you read the note that came with this one?" Draco asked, holding up a moderately sized box. Harry shook his head and took it when Draco handed it to him. It was written in Rose's elegant scrawl.
"Of course," she said, steering him towards the robe shop. Once inside, Rose greeted the owner, Madam Malkin, with a pleasant smile.
Rose stared at the girl for a long moment, long enough for Severus to walk up behind her after finding nothing amiss. "There is no need to lie to me, Miss Granger, but I suppose that it is a good thing Mr. Malfoy and Mr. Potter were here to assist you. Five points from Gryffindor for reckless behavior." At this, Granger's head lowered and her heart sunk. "However, Five points to both Malfoy and Potter, for coming to the aid of a student and clever thinking. Please return to your common rooms; I'll escort Miss Granger and Snape will take the boys."
Yule with the Malfoys and a dinner with a bit of tension.
Rose took Harry to the first bedroom in the hallway, and he was in awe when she opened the door. The room was mostly sparse of any personal touches, but there was a picture hanging on the wall that looked like an enlarged magic photo; it was of Rose and another redheaded woman ( his mother, he gathered from his Halloween visions ) laughing and sending spells at each other. The bed was in the middle of the room, fitted with cream sheets and topped with a silver comforter. On the left was a light wood desk with a window and owl perch; Hedwig was already making herself comfortable on it and nosing her beak through a bowl of treats Rose had set on the desk. On the right was an empty bookshelf, and on the wall sharing the bed there was a door that led to (presumably) a closet. There were a few shopping bags at the foot of the bed with a logo Harry didn't recognize, and sent a look to his aunt.
Rose came back in as he was stacking his books on the shelf with two steaming cups. He accepted his thankfully, as his hands were getting a little cold. The drink didn't smell like tea, and when he took a sip he knew it definitely wasn't. "This isn't tea," he pointed out, though Rose probably was expecting that if her smirk told him anything.
And then there was Snape. Rose had no idea that Snape was here as well. She also didn‚Äôt realize that she had sat right next to him. They stared at each other for a moment, in shock, before Snape looked away hastily. Rose chuckled a little bit before leaning over towards his ear and whispering, ‚ÄúI think it‚Äôs high time we start over, don‚Äôt you think?‚Äù Snape looked back at her to find her smiling. He didn‚Äôt smile, but he nodded. He may have just lost the love of his life, but here was Rose, his past best friend, and she was willing to put her hatred aside and start over. He wouldn‚Äôt disappoint her.
She debated showering before simply performing a skin-safe
(See the end of the chapter for
On Halloween morning, Rose sauntered into the Great Hall dressed to the nines. She wore a short black dress with a high collar and long flared sleeves, orange and purple striped tights, oversized black slouch boots that had pointed toes and thick heels, and a wide, pointy witch hat. She had black lipstick on her lips and shimmering silver stars around her eyes, and she smiled at all who looked up as she passed them and sat down in her chair at the staff table. The entire ensemble was quite eccentric to those of Pureblood families, but those who had grown up in the Muggle world knew exactly what she was doing, and kept sneaking smiles and smirks at her all day.
The last day came, and as Severus was setting down his luggage down in his compartment, he was surprised to find Rose standing in the doorway. They shared no words, no interactions besides the long stare they held. Then, Rose walked closer to the other Slytherin. Standing no more than mere inches from his face, the girl kissed the other teen‚Äôs cheek, lips lingering for a few more seconds.
Her nephew snapped his head up. "Really?" he asked incredulously.
Rose¬†walked up to the door and knocked three times. The conversation she could barely hear stopped. She then heard some murmuring and running. The door opened and Harry stood before her, looking disheveled but very excited. "Did they treat you any better?" she asked him quietly.
"It's curious that this wand chose you, yet its brother is the one who gave you that scar."
can use it to persuade people."
Rose gave a smile. "Of course, Harry. Meet me in my classroom after lunch?"
Harry tucked the box into his pocket and threw all the trash into the bag, which Shrunk and Vanished like Rose's note said. He returned to the other seat to put his books and pens into his shoulder bag.
"Those Weasleys keep staring at us," Severus muttered into his fish, and Rose let out a snort without looking up from piling her plate. "And more people are staring at you than usual."
Rose hummed and ran her fingers over her Garnet earring. "Curiouser and curiouser." Then standing, she tied a cloak around her shoulders, smirking at the face Severus made at her.¬†"I have to finalize my syllabus and then I'm going to tuck in." She leaned over to where Severus was still sitting on¬†his bed and pecked him on the cheek. "Goodnight, Sev."
didn't even fill his trunk all the way anyway) so he packed it all into his trunk and briefly visited the owlery to inform Hedwig of his plans; the owl hooted at him and flew off, presumably to his aunt's flat.
"Hermione, do you have a hair tie?" she asked. The girl groaned and switched stirring hands to dig a broken tie from her pocket.
‚ÄúI trust everything went fine with Harry?‚Äù Rose rolled her eyes.
The letter that got Rose the most excited was a letter from a girl named Marcy Pott√©, the daughter of one of Rose's former housemates. It was a formal invitation to her and Vivek Allen's wedding ceremony in the summer.
"Hello, Mewt. Lovely home you have." The cat mewed again and he scratched under his chin, getting some very loud purrs for his troubles. Mewt then jumped up onto his desk and stretched out, flexing his claws adorably, and laid down on his back. Harry tentatively patted the cat's revealed stomach (it was
"Ah, it's about half-and-half. Though most of the Muggle families have wixen children cropping up more often than not. The only ones who have no magic blood whatsoever are the Donatas at the end of the street. Leonardo owns the
Half an hour later, he heard footsteps outside his door. Pulling himself from the book was a little difficult ( he hoped Rose would help him learn some of the spells ) but he managed to get up and change into a different pair of joggers and a soft grey sweater. He pulled on a pair of white socks and opened his door slowly, peeking out into the living room. It was cold and empty. Harry stepped out and cast a look into the kitchen, where he saw his aunt in front of a Muggle coffee maker. Her hair was sticking everywhere as she hadn't pulled it back in any fashion and was wearing a black robe. Harry padded towards her just as she turned to the island, dark green mug in hand.
"Yeah, I'm fine. Is Hermione okay?" Harry asked. Rose nodded. "Oh, that's good. I hope
(See the end of the chapter for
"Curious," Olivander said. Rose listened intently.
‚ÄúHe‚Äôs not going,‚Äù Vernon said. Rose looked at her brother-in-law.
"Now," the library witch started, "are there any
"My sister Lily got it for me as a graduation gift." She took a steadying breath and turned back to the board. ¬†"Now, alongside crystals ‚Ä¶"
Hagrid looked around. ‚ÄúCouldn‚Äôt make us a cup of tea, could ya? ‚Äòs not been an easy journey ‚Ä¶‚Äù He trailed off. Rose nearly apologized for her sister and her husband, but then remembered why they were there. Hagrid strode over to Dudley. ‚ÄúBudge up, ya great lump.‚Äù The boy ran behind Petunia and Vernon, making Rose chuckle silently. ‚ÄúAn‚Äô here‚Äôs Harry!‚Äù he said as he walked up to him. Harry‚Äôs eyes were big as he looked up at the half-giant. Rose smiled. He did look so much like her sister. It made her heart swell.
Harry‚Äôs head was starting to hurt, what between Hagrid, his Aunt Rose, whom he knew very little about, and this talk about his parents. ‚ÄúWhat? My - my mum and dad weren‚Äôt famous were they?‚Äù
The next morning, after a good hot shower, Rose was walking down the many marble staircases and into the Great Hall wearing green robes. It was wondrous, she thought, to be walking in these halls after so few years. She smiled to herself as she took her seat at the staff table, alongside many of the professors she had.
Rose chirped her own laugh and pulled back, wiping Harry's cheeks before her own. "I used to call you that when I'd visit Lily and James. You looked like one of those popping¬†pastry cans, you know the ones? I called you that the first time I saw you and it just stuck. Kind of like how Sirius and Remus called you pup." Rose sniffed and wiped her face again before standing and taking Harry's things before sending the trolley away. "Let's get you on the train, okay?"
Severus shook his head. "I said I am fine, Rose. My small injury will not deter me from the ritual. Shall we start?"
On her way, she picked up on some snickering in a side corridor. Raising an eyebrow, she detoured and saw two red-headed boys hunched over a piece of parchment. "Well, if it isn't my two favorite pranksters," she mused, and George and Fred Weasley snapped their heads up.
Rose shook her head. "When I make bread, I like to do it by hand. It's something I used to do with my mother a lot, so it's nostalgic." Harry watched as she finished with the counter and went to the sink. He opened his mouth to ask something, but he was startled by a tapping at the window next to the hallway. Rose looked over at the owl trying to get in. "Oh, that'll be Narcissa's owl. Let her in, will you?"
Rose promptly fell onto her new bed at Hogwarts. Tomorrow, she would be starting her first day as the professor of her favorite subject besides Potions. Without sitting up, she took her wand and flicked it, and all of her clothes and possessions flew into the closet and the dresser. She sighed and tucked her wand into her boot. She stood back up to change into something suitable for bed, then fell back into it, this time under the covers.
And then came Rose's.
"Yes, I teach at Hogwarts. Defense Against the Dark Arts, my favorite subject." Harry hummed in thought, but smiled at her.
"Professor Rose?" the boy asked, adjusting his robe and smoothing his hair back. "Good day."
They reached the Defense classroom and Rose opened the heavy door, ushering Harry inside. It felt different than it did during class, but Harry chalked that down as it being empty. Rose strutted to her desk in the front and sat atop it, and Harry sat in one of the front seats.
- a journal, a pack of Muggle pens, and a soft black cloak. The Hogwarts journal was his favorite because the emblem on the cover would change depending on what house he would be Sorted into.
But then something else caught his eye. It was a plain, unassuming brown thing wrapped in twine, half-hidden from the eye. Harry's eyes squinted as he tilted his head at it. There was a note tucked under the string, but there was no suggestion of a sender. The package was a bit wrinkled, but not from wear. For a moment Harry thought it would be some kind of cloth or fabric before he shook his head and walked to the kitchen. There was no use contemplating it when he would be opening it later.
say it again, or it will be fifty. If you put as much energy into your schoolwork as you do your bigotry, perhaps you'd be getting better than an Acceptable." With that, she turned and continued to stalk around the room, giving points and advice throughout the lesson. Harry caught eyes with a pair of twins behind Hermione, and gave them a slight nod. He got one from both of them in return and they sent grueling looks at Kenneth Towler's back.
out of¬†their home, they did," Rose seethed, only just keeping hold of her white hot anger. Feeling her magic flare with her temper, Severus took hold of Rose's left hand under the table in his support.
Or maybe he should inform Rose of it first.
‚ÄúAh, yes, Petunia. I see the years have treated you well,‚Äù Rose said sarcastically. Petunia‚Äôs expression darkened.
Severus shrugged. "Your loss."
Rose collected her nephew in a warm hug that, admittedly, wasn't as tight as she would have liked but she didn't want to overwhelm the boy. "You're welcome, Muffin." Rose was tearing up as well. It had been so long since she'd embraced her nephew.
"Harry, I got you something," she said, reaching into her jacket pocket. She produced what looked like a mini gift bag. "It will Unshrink when you get to your compartment, but inside is all the birthday gifts I got you that I couldn't send you. Now, obviously-" Harry's heart was fluttering so much at the idea of birthday gifts that he nearly drowned Rose out, "-I didn't include the baby stuff I'd gotten when you were younger, but there should still be enough there that'll make you happy." Rose kneeled and offered Harry the bag.
"Really?! I love dragons, that's so cool!"
it said. Harry rose an eyebrow as his aunt went back to the desk to buy it and Shrunk it to fit in her pocket. Rose gave him another smirk and a wink when she returned and shuffled them out the door. "Alright, let's go order your wand first and shop while it gets made." They took a turn into an alley that was much darker and gloomier than Diagon. "This is Knockturn Alley, and I don't want you coming here without an adult, okay?" Harry nodded obediently. "Good. This is where we'll go." They stepped up to a shop with a sign that said
He shook himself and met her eyes, smiling lightly. "Yeah, I'm fine. Your home is very nice," he said sincerely.
Hermione freaking out quietly in the library like, "How do you classify wizards?! A Pureblood and a Muggleborn makes a Half-blood, but what about Pureblood and Half-blood? Muggleborn and Muggleborn? Half-blood and Half-blood? Muggleborn and Half-blood? Nothing makes sense! Everything is a lie!"
Rose rolled her eyes and looked at her friend. "You jest," she stated, and forked a piece of baked cod into her mouth. She turned away but Severus watched her a moment longer before returning to his own lunch. "And it's probably because of my Muggle clothes. I went out today."
Who was he? Ignoring his questions for now, he nodded and spoke his thanks to his Potions professor. Snape dipped his head in return and accepted a rather close grin from Rose, who was filling her glass once more with the red wine. Snape sipped his again and averted his eyes from her.
"Ugh, not you too." Rose turned and continued her way to lunch. The twins tucked the Map away and trailed after her with expectant grins. "Severus and I are very good friends," Rose said.
"Well, Muffin," Rose croaked, voice just as rough as Harry expected his to be, "let's get clean and eat something, then we can nap."
Harry decided to go ahead and get a book at Flourish and Blotts since they had time to spare, and picked out a very interesting book on potion ingredients native to America; Theo liked Potions and always wanted to know more about all the different ingredients and why one reacted the way it did with the other. He was sure the other Slytherin would love it. After picking it up and Shrinking it like Rose had with her own book, they resumed their seat outside the tea shop. "So, what's Animagius?" Harry asked.
‚ÄúProbably blaming me for ‚Äòruining her life‚Äô or making our family ‚Äòweird‚Äô. She has a habit of doing that when I‚Äôm mentioned.‚Äù Rose smirked a little, bitterly. She looked back to Hagrid. ‚ÄúHave you got anything for the boy to eat? He must be starving. He should eat more than cake.‚Äù
"So, when can I become an Animagius?" Harry asked a few hours later. It was getting closer and closer to the time they were meant to pick up his second wand, and Rose was trying to decide whether to get another cup of tea or a coffee at that point. She looked up at him from her empty cup and blinked for a few moments.
"Thank you for your patronage," Mx. Mordre nodded to them both and waved her hand again, the bowls disappearing and leaving her counter bare once more. "It will take half of the day. Come see me before sunset. Good day." And then she took her materials to the back.
"Yeah, but no snakes are good!"
Dinner was lovely, but then everything Rose made tasted wonderful. The tension that was building before dissipated slightly as the adults partook in spiked tea and eggnog. Harry had shuddered when Rose set it on the table, remembering when he'd tasted it at Hogwarts before the break. Eating together was a slightly awkward affair, but Rose made good on her promise to force her two friends to get along. Harry watched on amused as Snape and Lupin glared at each other less and less as the night went on, and then they managed to finish the food Rose prepared for them. The adults returned the dishes to the kitchen and Rose Vanished the temporary table and suddenly there was wine. Harry made another cup of tea and brought it to the armchair.
Harry chewed his sandwich, eyes concentrated in thought and eyebrows slightly knitted. "Everyone thinks I'm special," he said after a minute. "All those people in the Leaky Cauldron, Professor Quirrell, Mr. Olivander ... but I don't know anything about magic at all. How can they expect great things? I'm famous and I can't even remember what I'm famous for. I don't know what happened when-" he stopped himself from saying Voldemort's name again, "Sorry- I mean, the night my parents died."
He held out the necklace for Harry to examine.
Harry shrugged as he bit into a tomato sandwich. "I'll just brew potions like you and Professor Snape do."
Just then, Quirrell gingerly stepped out from the office. "A-and even s-superstitious f-folk use c-c-crystals f-for their b-beliefs," he stuttered out. Rose's grip on her wand minutely tightened.
Then, a crying Lily and telling-off from Rose later, Severus was left without his crush and friend.
"Are crystals really important in terms of Defense? I always thought it was more of a statement or image thing," the Slytherin daughter of a Pureblood model asked.
November passed and Harry found himself eager to go to Aunt Rose's for Yule and Christmas. His research wasn't yielding anything probable and Hermione was getting nervous about his frequent visits to the restricted section - never mind his pass - so the promise of Rose's flat for a break was welcomed warmly. The day came for those who were heading home for the break to board the train, so he packed the books he'd bought and were gifted to him and returned those borrowed to the library. He wasn't quite sure what to bring and what to leave (besides the fact that he didn't really have much more than what he'd bought for school, and that
Rose fixed them with a look. "Prongs was¬†the alias to a one¬†James Potter when we were in school."
He looked at her rather weirdly. "Not sure about the first part, get back to me on that." Rose nodded with a smile. Definitely the son of James, this one. "But, it's okay that it wasn't you. You're here now and, honestly, I trust you more than Hagrid."
to watch her. Harry raised an eyebrow and resumed his seat beside the other man, taking his tea to warm his hands.
at his aunt and they touched foreheads. "I think they're drunk," Harry croaked in a stage whisper to Remus. The man gave a deep cackle and turned to the boy, eyes shining with mirth.
Rose nodded, delving into the memory.
"Your father's." She looked up at him with a weird look in her eye, like she was afraid and angry and weary all at once. "And Dumbledore's."
does now, Harry won't have to step one foot into this house again, won't even have to
Lupin sat in the other armchair, the one beside Harry, with his own glass. Rose took a breath and leaned away from Snape, turning her gorgeous smile onto them. "Presents?" she asked and waved her hand. The boxes stacked on the floor under the tree floated to the coffee table.
"I assigned some reading for my classes, so here's my list for this week in case any of them turn up missing or harmed."
"Last year," Fred stated.
‚ÄúI demand that you leave at once, sir!‚Äù Vernon said sternly. Rose‚Äôs and Hagrid‚Äôs smiles disappeared and Rose shot a nasty look at her brother-in-law. Vernon visibly flinched, but carried on. ‚ÄúYou are breaking and entering!‚Äù
"Hello again, Draco," Harry greeted with a smile. The blond shifted before glancing back to the middle of the train.
"Where could they be?" Rose asked in a hushed manner as they walked back towards the portrait to leave the common room.
‚ÄúOh, shove it,‚Äù Rose sneered. Hagrid plucked the gun out of his hand and bent it like a paper clip. This amused Rose since she disliked Vernon greatly.
Rose laughed at the cat. "Hello, darling," she cooed as she scratched the black kitten's head, who purred loudly at the attention. In the corner window sat her own owl, a dark-feathered beauty she'd had since her school days. "And hello to you too, Diablo. How was your flight?" The bird hooted at his owner and pecked lovingly at her fingers. Rose summoned a few treats from the bag in her drawer. "I'll need you to send off a few things for me." From her pocket, Rose produced the letter she'd written to Amelia as well as the vial containing her memories and another letter she'd written after a second thought. "The first needs to go to Amelia Bones in the Ministry, and the second to a personal friend, Remus Lupin. Can you do that for me, darling?" The owl hooted and shook his feathers before accepting the mail and flying off into the approaching night.
had called him a
Rose was, once again, surprised. Yes, she loved her DADA class, it was the only place she could lash out at Severus without getting in trouble. ‚ÄúProfessor?‚Äù she asked. ‚ÄúWell, I guess that would be nice, but I‚Äôm only just over 20 years old, plus most of the other professors had me for a student, right? Wouldn‚Äôt that be weird?‚Äù
"Of course, Muffin."
Rose awoke with a smile on her face, knowing this would be the day that she would get to show Harry Diagon Alley, where every witch and wizard hung out. Her cat, Mewt, was lounging on the floor, lying on his back and looking cute. Rose yawned before heading towards the shower.
‚ÄúThat is enough!‚Äù Rose heard. She stood from the ground and looked behind her. Vernon was still standing with his gun, but now Petunia was standing with him. Rose's new cat hissed at Petunia from his perch on Rose's shoulder, causing the witch to pet him to calm him down.
When asked, she stated, "And why shouldn't I dress up? It all started my first year at Hogwarts; I'm Muggleborn, so every year on Halloween we would go Trick-or-Treating around the neighborhood, dressing up and getting candy. Can't very well do that when you're in a castle miles and miles from home, so Lils and I decided to dress up anyway. We'd wear sparkly bracelets and bat earrings, and we'd get each other a bag of candy from
there) then stroked his other hand along the comforter. It was very soft and felt like it would be warm in the cold weather. It made him smile.
"You eat a lot of sweet things," Harry mused as he glanced at her. Rose hummed around a full mouth and shot him a smirk. They passed the stacks until Rose stopped at one.
Draco's brows knitted. "Scar ointment?"
The two parted ways to look for the troll and the three students. Rose was the one to have luck; she heard loud banging and groaning near the girl's lavatory on the first floor and upon entering found the troll and the students. Granger was frozen under a sink and Harry was trying to tug her up, Draco pointing his wand up at the troll. The blond managed to use
Outside of the room, the moonlight was tranquil and Harry felt at peace. When they passed by windows, he truly thought that his aunt was
Rose gave him another leveling look, and Harry decided he would do everything in his power to avoid her ire. The witch offered a hand to each of them, and they all linked hands. Once they did, the two candles in the middle lit ablaze, and magic started to swirl around them. Harry was treated visions of a man who looked just like him and a beautiful woman, each dancing around with smiles on their faces. One had them both sitting at a kitchen island holding a baby, and then he saw a younger version of his aunt smiling down at it. There were also two men hovering around, one with long black hair and the other with scars littering his face. There was a strong feeling of home and
"Isn't that what Rose said in class?" Harry asked with amusement. Draco huffed at him and upturned his nose.
Harry thanked Draco. "It was actually July 31st, but my aunt could never send me anything. Oh, sorry, I'm Harry." The raven-haired boy held out a hand.
that, yet he let Harry stay with them for the last ten years. Rose shook her head at the thought of the old man.
Rose nodded. "Yes, I think it was a Hermione Granger. She had excelled in Charms class with the Levitation spell, and others mocked her for trying to help them with their pronunciation." Here she sighed. "Harry must've went looking for her. Kid's heart's too big for his chest. Let's find the troll and make sure no students are harmed."
It was enough to send the weary man into a fit of unexpected laughter. Harry smiled at their antics. That right there,
Harry blushed, then asked for a few other things to keep. Rose chuckled. "I'll give you anything you want to keep, Harry." He nodded, looking down again. The train was pulling up. "Would you like me to go with you?" A moment passed, the Harry nodded again. He liked Rose, much more so than Aunt Petunia.
When Harry spoke, the boy smiled and turned to him. "Ronald Weasley, but call me Ron. You're Harry Potter, right?!"
The man stood with a flourish of his robes and returned the gesture to the witch's freckled forehead. "And to you, Rose." He swept¬†her out of the room and the heavy door closed with a deep
when all his books were on the shelf ( though it was still mostly bare ) and his journals and quills on the desk. Mewt had snoozed on his bed whilst he was unpacking, so there was cat hair collected in one spot at the end of his bed. It made it feel real and lived in, so he couldn't bring himself to clean it off. The picture of his mum and Rose brought a warmth to his chest that made him feel more complete. He hung his bag on the coat rack on his door with his cloak and stored his trunk under his bed, and it felt
The boy walked up to the other side of the island and took a look at the menus. It was quite the assortment, and told him that Rose ate out a lot. "I've never eaten takeaway," he murmured as he moved the menus around.
Draco frowned but said nothing. He closed the door and sat opposite Harry, peering at the pile of presents. "Happy Birthday," he said.
Rose smiled widely and giggled a bit. "Rosewood," said said as if it should have been obvious. "Rose Quartz in the core." Harry rolled his eyes at how much irony his aunt carried with her.
Rose scowled and took a lighter piece that obviously wasn't dark chocolate, and bit into it. The sweeter chocolate melted on her tongue and the taste of raspberries erased the leftover bitterness. She grunted before standing, taking one more piece of milk chocolate. "Dark chocolate's gross," she aimed at Severus, who gave a smirk. Rose started the walk to her Defense classroom, and vaguely registered Harry following her. She popped the chocolate square into her mouth, another raspberry, and made her way. Harry fell into step beside her. "So, what did you have trouble with?" she asked her nephew.
It was very open and welcoming, the kitchen and living room open to each other with a hallway in between. The living room was decorated and the black couch looked warm and used well, and the kitchen was big enough to do some complex cooking. "You alright Harry?" Rose asked, knocking him out of his stupor.
Rose blinked and the nonchalant tone of voice. Did she tell him that? Did Severus tell--no, he wouldn't, he's tight-lipped about his outside life. Rose took a bite of her own sandwich and sipped her butterbeer. "And just how are you going to do that?" she asked.
"Oh, Marcy, I'm so happy for you!" Rose enveloped the girl in a warm hug. "Chrissy would be so proud." The two of them shared a deep breath. Marcy's father, a Slytherin a couple years above Chrysanthemum, who was already a few years above Rose, had proposed in her last year as well, and became a widow during the same summer Rose lost her siblings. "When are you two having the ceremony?"
Rose frowned softly. Had Hagrid shown up and taken him instead? "Thank you for telling me. It's good to know he's here, getting ready for Hogwarts." The man nodded and left, still shouting in glee. Rose shook her head in amusement and slight worry at the man's excitement. Was everyone going to be like that? She hoped not, because, sure Harry survived that night and everyone thought he defeated the Dark Lord, but he was just a
After what felt like an hour, Harry had amassed a pile of three books -
The heels on her boots clacked loudly as she practically marched into the Great Hall, where several of her returning students stopped to watch her in awe. She nodded at those who waved as she passed, but said nothing to them. Soon, she reached her seat beside Severus, who was wearing a nicer set of black robes for the feast. "You look lovely tonight, Rose, as you do at every feast."
out of the house!" Vernon exclaimed. Rose looked at him with hard eyes. Petunia studied Rose for a short moment before nodding. Peculiar attitude for the people who raised two children. Rose cut her eyes at the two of them, then delved into Petunia's mind without even uttering
Harry smiled at his aunt. He understood her lack of control over the situation and was grateful for her suggestions. "Right, and I will. The reading I was having trouble with is bookmarked." Harry lifted his First year Defense book.
"Do you know what a Cerberus is?" he asked instead. It wasn't completely Muggle, though Harry had no way of knowing if his Pureblooded friends knew about Greek myths, no way of knowing if Greece had a magical community let alone if it was in communication with others.
"Half the school thinks we are together, including our coworkers," he said, fixing a pointed look to Irma across the way. To his left, Minerva coughed politely. Rose stabbed the fish again and brought it to her mouth just as an unfamiliar owl swooped and landed on the back of her chair. She patted her mouth with her napkin and took the letter from the small brown bird, and offered a piece of her fish. It hooted in thanks before taking off again, through one of the open windows at the top of the Hall.
"These are the Yule logs that we burn on Yule. Those in wizarding society do this to connect with late family who could not join them physically for the holiday." Rose knelt directly opposite him with the logs between them, so Harry knelt as well. "I want you to hold my hands and focus on your magic, and I will as well. That will bring it about ourselves and infuse our very essences into the logs, which will then show us our late family when we light it."
"They're inviting both of us?" Harry asked.
Marcy pulled back and wiped at her face. "After we graduate, so probably this summer. We wanted to invite you- and Harry, of course. Aunt Marcy will be there as well as Aunt Audrey and her wife."
The three looked up in shock at Rose's soft words of praise, and the group split again. As Rose walked Granger back to Gryffindor Tower, the girl thought of a hundred different ways to thank Draco and Harry. Harry had seen her before Charms and had wished her luck in that bloody class, expressing his admiration for her dedication and intellect. When he'd found her in the lavatory crying, he ranted about how much of a git Ronald was and that he should make sure he can cast properly before mocking others. Draco had been mostly silent, but he'd offered a sneer and mocked Ronald as well, not forgetting the first day when the four of them met on the train. He hadn't mentioned anything about her blood status as many other Slytherins would and had in face saved her life with the very spell she'd ran off crying about. He'd even offered a - though very tiny - smile at her before the professors took them away! Hermione raised her head and went to say something to Rose about it, but found the redhead to already be looking down at her.
"What happened fifth year?" George fixed his grin on his professor.
the Dungeons!" An outraged Seventh-year yelled. The person beside them smacked their arm and muttered something about Professor Rose protecting them.
It made Harry feel a conglomeration of emotions again. And again he decided that he was happy. Marcy also sent a box of milk chocolates, half with lemon and half with rose. They made Rose smile again and Harry wrinkled his nose at the lemon. The fact that Rose didn't get angry at him for not liking her favorite sweet was amazing to him.
Rose thought as a sneer pulled her lips down.
The boys exchanged a wide grin. "So Prongs married Lily Evans-"
‚ÄúI‚Äôve decided to take him to your sister‚Äôs house, to keep him away from the fame he‚Äôs gained tonight. When he is older, I will send him his acceptance to Hogwarts letter. You will be able to see him again, don‚Äôt worry.‚Äù
Severus pulled Rose's hair out from under her head and let it dangle off his lap, already curling back from whatever she used to straighten it. "I think you should give the man a few weeks or so to adjust to your schedule and routine so you can see how he reacts to you. The conversation we had just before the feast began also has me troubled." Severus swept Rose's fringe off of her forehead to reveal several sunspots. "While the three of you - you, Lily and Petunia - never hid the fact that you were at odds, I highly doubt that you or Lily would make something like this up if the events that led up to it had been slightly different. Petunia has
Harry nodded before taking Hedwig. "Can you call me that more?" he asked in a small voice. Rose gave another watery smile.
that she gifted him. "How are you liking the book?" she asked and watched him take a strawberry.
Harry nodded in understanding and took a deep breath, delving into himself to find the core of his magic. Rose had talked about meditating in class and the Purebloods of his House were well versed in the traditions. On one of his breaths he brushed against something warm and pulsing, and then it flared around him. Rose had said that few could detect their own magic while casting, let alone pick it out among others in such a setting as a classroom, but Harry could feel how small and young his felt to his aunt's, which roiled in bubbling waves across from him like lava. His own felt like a kettle yet to boil in comparison.
It wasn't until the students were well into their potions, at a point for crucial attention and stirring, that Rose stood from her chair and popped her back before skirting around the tables. Some cauldrons were the correct consistency, but some were too bubbly and others more solid. Hermione was doing brilliantly, though Rose worried around her hair getting in her potion.
to keep up the tradition. And now that I'm not a student, I can wear whatever I want. It's a sort of ode to my sister in that regard."
Lupin--Remus--gifted Rose a box of chocolates, the variety of which had her smiling behind her wine. (
"Yes, Professor."
Rose nodded stiffly. "It would ease my mind if you did. He's very precious to me."
"Apple cider?" he guessed, not familiar with the drink. Aunt Petunia only ever had tea or coffee.
Rose's nose scrunched up in distaste and she let out a low whine. Severus sighed at her. "That one is dark chocolate." Rose offered the other half to him and he accepted, shaking his head at her.

really be the one asking for it.
The wizard laughed. ‚ÄúSharp as always Rose. That‚Äôs why I‚Äôm here,‚Äù he said with much gusto. Rose raised a fine red eyebrow. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve come to ask if you would like to come back to Hogwarts to become a professor. We both know how much you love Defense Against the Dark Arts.‚Äù
They stopped at Gringotts so Harry could withdraw a good amount to buy gifts, then made their way back down to enter Madam Primpernelle's, which turned up an eyebrow. Harry knew that Blaise was running low on that hair gel he needs to use for whatever reason, and that he can only get it in Diagon Alley, so he picked up a full set of six jars. Draco also had a habit of using hair gel ( just not the expensive one Blaise did ) so he picked up a half-pack for him. He also wanted to get the blonde a couple of unique cloak pins, since all of his were ( while high-end ) bought by his father. Harry also knew that Draco and his mother frequented Twilfitt and Tatting's ( the sheer amount of time Draco could go on and on about a robe shop astounded him ) and picked out a silver snake pin with a single emerald eye. Just as he was about to head to the counter, an extra special pin caught his eye; it was a piece of agate with two thin streams of gold running through the crystal, and the pin itself was also gold. Harry smirked and picked it up as well, willing to pay the sixteen galleons for such a piece. Theo was more of a reader than anything, so he wanted to wait until they were about to leave to get him something. Parkinson had talked sparingly about all of her quills being hexed, so he wanted to pick up a pack of the no-dip quills Rose got him. Greengrass had mentioned she wanted some colored parchment, so he picked up a roll of lavender, rose, mint, and peach, hoping it would please her. Millicent Bulstrode was the one person Harry talked to the least ( save Crabbe and Goyle ), so he was unsure what to get her. He walked into Sugarplum's Sweets to get them the widest variety he could afford as he thought about Bulstrode. She was quiet and reserved, but did listen to their conversations and add her input in the form of snorts and grunts. Maybe a scarf, or a pair of gloves. Harry then remembered that she was very good at Potions, so he darted to The Victor's Apothecary to pick out the nicest set of potions tools he could find.

"Can I help you?" she asked, raising an eyebrow and putting her finger in her book.
"Well, for one, I was wondering why we only have Defense on Mondays," the boy started.
He had to excuse himself before he did something embarrassing, like
Hagrid smiled kindly. "Don't you worry Harry. You'll learn soon enough. Just- be yourself." Rose nodded.
"A wizard, o'course," said Hagrid, sitting back down on the sofa, which groaned and sank even lower, "an' a thumpin' good 'un, I'd say, once you've been trained up a bit. With a mum and dad like yours, and Rose over here, what else would¬†ya be? And I reckon it's about time you¬†read your letter."
The storeroom door opened with a soft click, though Rose had not visibly moved, and the First years collected their ingredients. When Harry returned, he saw Rose had moved to sit behind Snape's desk and was grading some papers; the recent Defense assignment, as he recognized his own writing and wording on the top parchment.
Hagrid produced sausages from his coat and handed one to Harry. His bewildered expression both amused Rose and worried her. Did he really have no idea about magic at all? Petunia, finally making use of herself, walked over with¬†some tea¬†for Hagrid. He took a big gulp before Harry asked him, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry, but I still don‚Äôt know who you are.‚Äù
maybe she'd go straight for the Ministry and file custody, both magical and Muggle. Rose was quickly turning into a woman scorned, an
now. It was ‚Ä¶ hard to describe how weird it was to Harry; Rose was open with her emotions ( much to the ire of many Slytherins ) while Snape was entirely closed off, sneering and scolding seeming to be his only forms of communication to all who weren't Rose. He watched in mild horror as Snape actually
At the main desk, the boys saw the professor they were talking about walk in with a list, purple robe fluttering behind her. They looked at each other before subtly moving towards the stacks to overhear her.
The next morning, Harry awoke too early. He tried to sleep later at Hogwarts, but the instinct had been drilled into him and he found he simply could not remedy it. Besides, getting up earlier made it so he was the first to the bathroom, and he got to enjoy the hot water. It was the same at Rose's. Harry stretched his arms up above his head and swung his feet over, stepping onto the cold wooden floor. He shivered minutely before smiling to himself. The first term of Hogwarts had gone splendidly and now he was spending Yule break with his aunt. Hedwig was still snoozing on her perch so he didn't disturb her, but he did make a trip to the bathroom. It reminded him of the dungeons, save the enchanted-warm floor. Returning to his room, Harry plucked the shield book from the bookcase and sat on his bed, intending to fully immerse himself.
"Hello again, Harry. How are you?" she asked, smiling down at her nephew. "Sorry it wasn't me who picked you up, I was enjoying the morning. I hadn't expected Hagrid to get you."
Rose's smile softened and she laid a hand lightly on his shoulder. "I know, and I'm sorry. But I wanted you to have clothes that were
"It seems like you have an idea already," Harry murmured back as they eyeballed the shops. Rose gave him a smirk.
. You‚Äôre
Rose sighed. She had no idea, because she didn't know what could possibly be in the package that was James'. Something he'd left Dumbledore before he died, obviously, perhaps with instructions not to give it to Harry until he was at Hogwarts. But it's been ten years. Surely Rose, or even Severus, would know what it is by now. "I don't know, Muffin. But you can open it now."
that Rose started to tear up. She cleared her throat in lieu of sniffing and felt Harry nod against her. She let him go and wiped at her eyes, ignoring the fact that he was doing the same. "Well, I'll write back to her and tell her to go ahead and cement the date. The weather must be bad is she used the Floo instead of her owl."
"That's nasty."
Rose snorted. "Probably not to us, but he'd do it to someone he didn't like. The Weasley twins have caused him so much trouble but he never seems to catch them, so they're probably at the top of his list. Come on." She held a hand out and pulled Harry up from his spot on the floor, knees popping slightly. Snape stood with another grunt and leaned heavily on his right leg, and the room gave him a cane to walk with.
could feel like, but he'd found one with Rose and Draco and Blaise and all his friends. Even Snape and Mr. Lupin added to the feel of home after the night they shared.
However, just as they stood, the doors to the Great Hall groaned and Quirrell ran in, clothes askew and out of breath. "Troll in the Dungeon! Troll in the Dungeon!" He made it halfway to the head table before slowing and trying to catch his breath. "Just thought you should know." And with that, he fell onto his front and fainted. There were maybe a couple seconds of stunned silence before everyone started roaring with panic. Dumbledore stood and raised a hand to order peace.
Rose shrugged and summoned her wand,
to give him things. It was evident in the love she exuded for him through the gestures and the food. And the other gifts, but they were for his birthday and Harry was ( still ) trying to convince himself that it was
"Well, I happened across these older boys hunched over a piece of parchment, and they were muttering," he explained with a sly smirk.
The other professors started murmuring in aghast tones while Dumbledore gave a light sigh. "Are you certain that you are not being too overprotective of your nephew? You and Petunia never got on well, after all."
Harry was quick to shake his head. "No, I think it's fine. It's your house, and I really am just a guest."
Both of them nodded, which was a welcome surprise. "Someone is saying that's what they saw, and that Hagrid often referred to it as 'Fluffy'."
Harry
"I am always running out of quills," she said sagely, too sagely for how much wine she'd had, "and I figured you were in the same boat." Snape merely nodded stiffly and closed the box once more, setting it aside for the moment. Harry thought the man was a bit amused at Rose but unwilling to show it blatantly, and Harry wasn't so versed in Slytherin faces yet.
Only one problem arose between the two. They were sorted into different houses. Lily into Gryffindor, and Rose into Slytherin.
Rose stopped dead and slammed her and on her desk, causing green sparks to fly, and snapped her head to the lion. "Do
scorned, and Dumbledore should know to fear her wrath.
She grabbed one of the books,
"Anything for you, Muffin. Now, I'll help you set up your closet, and then we'll put up a tree. How's that sound?" Harry's excitement told her all she needed to know.
"I'm unsure, though I have been hearing some whispers about a distressed student. Gryffindor."
in flavors. Many of them were flavors he'd never heard of, flavors that suggested magical origin, but a few he recognized. He brewed it easily and added the single sugar Rose tended to take and walked down to her room with it. Harry hesitated before entering, debating whether to knock or leave the cup or put it on the table just inside the door. He grunted to himself in frustration and knocked twice, lightly, and left the tea on the table just inside the room. Pulling it back closed and turning around, Harry let out a breath. He would read until she awoke, he decided.
The (Magically legal) adults waved their wands and the floor was soon clear. The way none of them reacted to the use of a nonverbal spell caused a smirk to appear on Rose's face. "Very good. Five points to all houses for excellent use of a nonverbal spell. Now-"
"I can't believe he hired an
"Hello, Rose, dear." She turned towards Harry. "Hogwarts, dear? I have another being fitted right now."
Remus answered with mock offense. ) Snape gave her a slightly larger box that whispered when she moved it. Inside was a bundle of shimmery emerald-green fabric trimmed with silvery-white fur. When Rose removed it from the box - having to stand from the length of it - Harry realized it was a cloak. A
Then, Minerva called Harry's name, and a hush fell over the Great Hall. He stepped up cautiously before sitting on the stool, hand running over something at his collar; Rose smiled when she realized that he was wearing the necklace she gave him. The hat tilted this way and that, talking to himself and to Harry, before it straightened and roared, "SLYTHERIN!"
Rose hummed as she opened the letter. She recognized the handwriting and was eager to read the reply. Amelia's reply stated that she had people looking into the matter and that there would be a closed hearing after the holidays for the adoption. Rose let out a happy sigh and tacked it on the cork board beside the fireplace. "Well, I'm glad that worked out." She turned to the face of her curious nephew. "Amelia Bones from the Ministry has written to inform me of an investigation into my sister's behavior." Harry's eyes widened, so she continued. "Hopefully she'll get a fine out of her or perhaps some jail time, though I am unsure as to where little Dudley will go if she does. There's also to be a hearing of my case near the end of the hols." She crouched down at Harry's level where he still sat on the floor. "I wanted to ask you if you would stay here with me while you are not in school until you are an adult. There would be a ritual and I would become your sole magical guardian. I won't do so without your explicit permission, so I asked for a standing hearing until you agree. I'll give you some time to think about it and then we'll--"
"-we know."
Rose‚Äôs brows knitted. Hagrid hadn't told her he was leaving for Harry. Dumbledore hadn't said anything about when the letters were sent or offered to take Rose to see Harry; hell, Dumbledore never told her where Petunia lived, or she would have gone there herself. ‚ÄúWhat do you mean he‚Äôs not been receiving his letters?‚Äù She rolled her eyes. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt tell me that Petunia and Vernon refuse to allow him to learn of his magical heritage?‚Äù Rose downed the rest of her butterbeer and picked up her cat, who walked around her shoulders before settling into the hood of her royal purple cloak.
This made Harry look up again. "Aren't I not supposed to perform magic outside Hogwarts until I'm seventeen?"
words. She would take a vial and store her memory of what she'd seen in Petunia's mind and send it off to Amelia Bones, one of Rose's friends in the Ministry. Attach a note including those involved, and Rose's desire to adopt Harry in a magical bond so that no one else, including Dumbledore, would be able to take him away again. Rose felt her eye twitch. Strong words.
Rose smirked wryly. She noticed Dumbledore's grunt before she replied, "He had just as much chance of being in Gryffindor as he did Slytherin. I'm sure my¬†serpentine nature isn't
The other was wrapped in simple brown paper and tied with string, but Harry was no less excited to open it. After untying the string and setting the box lid aside, the small Slytherin found another journal. This one was bound differently than the other one; the Potioneer's journal had a stiff black cover with nary a crack in the leather, aside from the spine, while the second journal's was tawny and worn and loose. Scrawled on the inner cover was a beautiful hand that Harry had seen before.
"Mx. Mordre, wonderful to meet you. I'm here to customize a powerful wand for my nephew. A neutral wood with a combination of quartz, topaz, and tourmaline as its core."
"That's me and Lily, as you probably guessed. James took that during the summer before Sixth year, when we were practicing and letting out steam. The day after we got our OWLs results." Rose grinned to herself at the memory, at her and Lily's nearly identical scores.
They finished up, and Harry tucked his wand into his pocket. Rose felt her own wand hitting her left thigh as she walked, hanging like a sword on her hip. The case even gleamed silver in the light, like a real sword. Harry asked her about it and she confirmed that yes, it was her wand and yes, she'd ordered the sheath specially. "What's it made of?" he asked.
Harry looked up at his friend. Yes, he did notice her apathy towards Quirrell even at the welcome feast, though he didn't know why it was so. "Yeah," he nodded, "She acts like that around the Dursleys, too."
The boy nodded and returned to his sandwich, so Rose sent a smile to Draco as well before taking her seat beside Severus. She pulled her hair back into a loose ponytail and took a sip of water.
Harry gazed in wonder at all the magic around him, both visible and not, buzzing to the point of tangible. Draco, who walked in next to him, smirked at his expression before dropping it as gazed up at the staff table. Many of the professors were trying to hide a sour look, and Rose looked absolutely livid in the way that Slytherins do, which is to say that the only sign of her anger was how hard her eyes were cut. She was smiling, of course, but Draco knew that look very well from when his father got angry; never at Draco, but he'd seen it often enough.
"Uh, yes," Harry responded, taking in the boy as much as he was him. Rose raised an eyebrow and stepped away, chatting with Madam Malkin while her nephew conversed. He didn't brag about him being rich, didn't stuff it in Harry's face like Lucius had done to others when they were in school. Perhaps Draco wanted to be friends with Harry? That'd be ‚Ä¶ nice.
aunt, Petunia Dursley, I noticed that he was just as skinny as he was when Hagrid brought him to Diagon Alley, which is to say very small for his age. When prompted, I was made aware that not only was Harry kept in a cupboard for his entire ten-year stay at the Dursleys, but he had also been frequently starved and locked away for days at a time. This must be rectified, Poppy, for I fear that Harry is very unhealthy."
Before he could say anything else, Rose fixed him with a serious look. "Haythim, you are absolutely not
Rose nodded, her smirk leveling out into a smile. "Perfect for the season, in my opinion. So," she gestured to the bags on the floor with one hand, "wanna open them?"
"Yeah, I don't know who from though." Harry handed the slightly singed letter to his aunt, surprised it wasn't warm from the fire. Did Rose use this fireplace to Floo?
"No?" he replied, unsure. He didn't have a favorite tea; he'd only been drinking it regularly for a few months.
Hagrid showed up outside, and Rose shot him a small smile, still suspicious. Draco looked as if he were going to say something, but after looking at Harry again he shut his mouth. Odd. Rose ordered Harry some robes as Hagrid gave him ice cream, and watched in fascination as Draco left. One look at Hagrid and Rose knew he was shocked as well. Taking into account his father's views, Rose assumed Draco would be brought up the same, but he wasn't saying anything remotely racist or bigoted around Harry.
things as well?" she asked, hinting at neglect and possible abuse.
"Hi, Aunt Rose," the girl started, a spitting image of Chrysanthemum with long black hair and blue eyes, before she broke out into a huge grin. "It was wonderful. Vivek and I visited Mother in the Pott√© cemetery and enjoyed a nice picnic."
"Ya' sistah!" Rose said just as loudly. She walked into the living room sassily, crossing her arms at the sight of her sister and her husband. "Harry, are you all packed?" He squeaked out a reply, then vanished. Vernon glared at her warily. "I want custody of Harry," she said with a normal tone.
Harry and Blaise just shake their heads and Parkinson tosses a book at her to distract her.
Madam Irma Pince, the librarian witch, gave a polite laugh. "Oh, Rose dear, you always make my job so much easier. I thought I'd miss it with your retirement."
She thought maybe she should wear something nice to bring Harry throughout Diagon Alley. Rose settled on a cute corset top with flared sleeves, and black pants with roses stitched on them. She loved roses, and she found it ironic that her mother named her after them. After getting dressed and eating a scone, she looked at the box of books Severus left on her table. It was the new series from her favorite author about defensive spells and protecting yourself from the Dark Arts. It also seemed that Sev took a few before he left. Rose laughed and shook her head. Still couldn‚Äôt get over the fact she was hired for the position he wanted, huh?
Snape."
"9 ¬æ?" Harry repeated as they passed Platform 8, then 9. There was nothing between 9 and 10. "Is it hidden from Muggles?"
The elf nodded enthusiastically. "Of course, Miss Rose! Anything for Miss Rose!" And the elf popped back to the kitchens. Rose tacked the list to her message board and waved her wand to take her earlier note down. Casting a
The hours went by leisurely despite how the day had started. Rose had gone to Petunia's to demand all of Harry's things so that she could set up his room, and they had told her he had no belongings! That they'd taken what little he had and thrown it out! Rubbish! Rose was so infuriated at her sister that the water she was boiling had bubbled over and burned both her pot and the burner. And so Rose had left for Madam Malkin's.
Rose nodded, smiling. Hagrid had left, important Hogwarts business he said, but he left Harry with his Hogwarts ticket for September. "You sure? It's a whole month away until school."
downtown."
Hagrid wiped his chin and answered, ‚ÄúCall me Hagrid, everyone does. An‚Äô it‚Äôs like I told you, I‚Äôm the Keeper of Keys and Grounds at Hogwarts. 'know all about Hogwarts, o‚Äôcourse.‚Äù
Rose bristled at that. She didn't need an assistant, nor did Dumbledore confer with her beforehand. She glanced down the table, as Quirrell was seated as far away from her as he could, and saw standing a man wearing a turban. It seemed far too ‚Ä¶ thickly wrapped to seem normal, but Rose ignored it in favor of the food appearing. Dumbledore's goat-like behavior and her new assistant were put on the back burner, so to speak, as she devoured chicken and potatoes and then pie as the dessert came.
Rose nodded at him. "While Severus and I have Masteries in our own subjects, we spend so much time around each other that we basically know enough of the other subject to have a complex understanding of it." Well, that answered his question. She suddenly shifted and ran a hand through her hair, sighing a little. "Do you think the flat is too small? Should I move into somewhere larger? I gave you the guest bedroom, but I feel like you should have more space. What do you think?" She turned to her nephew with worry knitting her brows.
On the ride to the station, Rose thought more on the situation at hand. Harry definitely wasn't raised in the sweet, caring manner Dumbledore claimed he was. Hell, he was scarcely Rose's size when she was eleven! And
Rose let out another sob. Not only was Lily dead, but her horrid excuse for a sister and her family would be raising Harry as their own. ‚ÄúBut I‚Äôm a far more suitable guardian than Petunia!‚Äù As she fumed, Dumbledore simply looked out the window, trying to make the best of what had happened. Rose sighed. ‚ÄúLet me pack my bags.‚Äù
"You alright Harry?¬†You're very quiet."
Harry slid the window up and the dark-feathered horned owl in, offered it the bowl of treats Rose kept on the desk and untied the letter on its leg. The ink was black and written in plain cursive was his name. The owl had its fill and flew back out the window, and Harry shut it again. "I was going to ask if you live in a Muggle or magic neighborhood," he said as he brought the letter to the island to open.
"James wanted to name you something traditional, being a Pureblood, and Lily wanted something different." She barked a laugh, recalling a memory. "They were arguing one night and I was just downing their Firewhiskey trying to stay out of it, but then Lil turned to me and I blurted out the first thing that came to mind." She looked at her nephew, mirth in her eyes. "You are named after one of the greatest spell weavers in known history. I was researching after one of my jobs at the dragon sanctuary that I worked at and it caught my eye. Spell weaving is very complex, but masters at Defense, Charms and Transfiguration can create at least one or two spells in their lifetime."
, and he could feel her magic latching onto his. It was soothing, actually, and Harry practically collapsed into his bed when he reached it, exhausted from the ritual but in a good way. He missed the look Draco gave him when he peeked up from his book, a smile that looked a little too warm for a Slytherin's face. Harry slept soundly that night, dreaming of stags and dogs and wolves.
Draco said nothing and returned to his book, and the two sat in silence for a while. Then, the Malfoy said, "There's a whole section on crystals in the back here, on what kinds work best for what purpose, and the recommended crystals that First years should wear before they learn spells."
Rose nodded. "He's getting on up there in years. Might have to get a new owl soon, but he's still hanging on." She smiled. "You know, Remus sent me a letter today, and he would like to spend Yule with us."
Draco and Harry smirked to themselves as they made their way back to their table, nearly laughing aloud. "Apparently your aunt likes someone," Draco said as they sat back down.
‚ÄúThat‚Äôs just it,‚Äù he said, ‚ÄúIn exchange for Lily and James‚Äô lives, Voldemort was defeated. Harry, your nephew, survived.‚Äù
this has no update schedule, if you were wondering. but yikes, last update was march. sorry about that!
Rose made friends with a dark boy by the name of Severus Snape. They hit it off immediately, Rose‚Äôs oddly outgoing personality being the polar opposite to Severus‚Äôs awkward, asocial self. They were soon inseparable, and right before Rose gathered the courage to ask him out, he called her sister a Mudblood.
We were just friends. Until fifth year."
"So ‚Ä¶ Dumbledore had something of my father's, and saved it to give me at Yule?" Harry looked back at the parcel. There was a faint twinkling on the brown paper, down at the bottom. "Why would he wait until Yule? Why didn't he give it to me at the beginning of the year? Or--" Harry brought his head back up and looked at Rose "--why didn't he give it to
Rose's bread, and it effectively disappeared in the next few days. Rose wasn't even angry, she just laughed and ate it nearly as fast. As promised, they went out for a shopping day to get both Harry's out-of-school wand and presents for his friends. Rose dressed in a shorter, more casual dress than she wears at Hogwarts in a heavy black fabric to keep her warm. Harry decided to go with one of his darker robes - a green one - to wear with a pair of dragonhide boots from his Wizard closet. They pulled on similar black cloaks with silver fastenings at the door and moved to the Floo, which they would take to Flourish and Blotts.
‚Äô world," Rose tried to explain it, exasperated.
her way to the desk in the front of the room. "Good morning all, and welcome to Defense Against the Dark Arts, commonly referred to as Defense or DADA." The names of the class appeared on the board with a wave of her wand and she turned to address the students, who looked either nervous or excited. "My name is Professor Rose Evans, but please use my first name as opposed to my last, makes me feel a bit younger," she said with mirth, and the students all gave her smiles. She saw that Harry and Draco were sitting next to each other near the front, and as she took attendance noted that Blaise Zabini and Pansy Parkinson were sitting in front of them with the Crabbe and Goyle boys behind. She'd purposely arrived a bit later so Harry could still arrive before her after his check up with Madam Pomfrey. He smiled up at her.
Dean snorted into his pumpkin juice. ‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù
"Nothing," said Harry quickly. "We wanted to ask -"
"It's that voice again - shut up a minute -"
It was the same voice- the same cold, murderous voice he had heard in Lockhart's office.
‚ÄúYes,‚Äù Parvati replied with a smile. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a great matter of pride among families.‚Äù Her tone turned dark. ‚ÄúWizards like Voldemort and Slytherin changed that, claiming Parseltongue as a mark of blood purity and dark ability, stealing a part of our culture and corrupting it.‚Äù
Hermione had stirred in the stolen ingredients and happily told them that the potion would be ready in two weeks- just in time for Christmas.
"Look this way, Harry! This way!"
"No one wants to upset me! That's a good one!" howled Myrtle. "My life was nothing but misery at this place and now people come along ruining my death!"
"Could be useful," he said to the other two as they went into dinner. "Shall we go?"
"Listen!" said Harry urgently, and Ron and Hermione froze, watching him.
But Hermione gave a sudden gasp, pointing down the corridor.
"We wanted to ask you if you've seen anything funny lately," said Hermione quickly. "Because a cat was attacked right outside your front door on Halloween."
Harry frowned. ‚ÄúWhat
Snape smirked as Lockhart quickly picked it up, saying, "Whoops -my wand is a little overexcited -"
He‚Äôd thought that Malfoy would be at the Halloween feast at the very least, but he supposed that it didn‚Äôt matter either way as he, Ron, and Hermione trooped down to where Nearly-Headless Nick‚Äôs Deathday Party was being held in an obscure corner of the dungeons.
"One - two - three -"
She waved vaguely at the dirty old mirror and the damp floor.
"Exactly," said Wood. He was a tall and burly sixth year and, at the moment, his eyes were gleaming with a crazed enthusiasm. "It's part of our new training program. Come on, grab your broom, and let's go! None of the other teams have started training yet; we're going to be first off the mark this year -"
It was the gloomiest, most depressing bathroom Harry had ever set foot in. Under a large, cracked, and spotted mirror were a row of chipped sinks. The floor was damp and reflected the dull light given off by the stubs of a few candles, burning low in their holders; the wooden doors to the stalls were flaking and scratched and one of them was dangling off its hinges.
"No, Ronald, I haven't
"No idea," Harry lied, putting on a spurt of speed that took him as far away as possible from Colin.
Angelina, Alicia, and Katie had come over, too. There were no girls on the Slytherin team, who stood shoulder to shoulder, facing the Gryffindors and leering to a man.
"Hey, Muffin," Rose greeted with a smile. "I'm making my signature bread to see if you like it. If you do, I'll make it again for Yule. Remus does so love his bread pudding." She took one of the towels and wiped the counter, then placed the bowls in the sink. Harry noticed her wand was stuck in her hair, which was tied up in a bun.
Rose whipped around to face her nephew and the others. "What in the world were you lot thinking?! I have explained that trolls
"Do you know what piezoelectricity is?"
world,
The daily abuse the witch witnessed that had started the moment Harry was dropped on their doorstep and was still occurring made her blood boil. She removed herself from her sister's mind just in time to hear a door slam shut upstairs. Rose took a steadying breath to calm down.
Harry walked back into the room to find Rose and Snape staring at each other on the couch, Remus trying and failing to hide a smirk behind his glass of wine. Rose was smiling in a way that was way too loose for the typical Slytherin, and Snape seemed almost
Harry's frown turned into a true grimace. "Well,
"It's a Wizard camera," she said softly, her grimace morphing into a smile as she went, "I thought you'd like to take some pictures of your own that we can hang on the tree next year, or that you could put in an album or something." Her brows furrowed as she looked at her nephew slightly pleading.
"Er, could you-?"
Rose had to sit again. Her sister and brother-in-law were dead? A tear ran down her cheek, followed by many more. She looked back to her professor and he held her in his arms, sharing her distress. Rose pulled back after a moment. ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs to become of Harry? Where will he go?‚Äù
Harry looked confused. "Yule?"
had magic. Lily and Severus trudged down it looking for a compartment, and we happened across four boys who looked like mischief embodied." Rose smiled wistfully.
"It's the third one," he said, pushing his trolley towards it. Rose watched him stand in front of it awkwardly, then smirked as she grabbed onto the handle.
Rose hummed, not giving an answer to that because she didn't exactly know. "I became one in my fifth year, but I didn't know what it was before that. You have the book, and me and hopefully Sirius, to teach you. So, fourth year." Rose nodded, cementing the fact. "I think I'll just switch to lemon tea," she mused, looking back down at her cup. Harry rolled his eyes discreetly.
that sounded as they moved for the first time in several hours.
He had found it in the tea pantry, momentarily blindsighted by the sheer
The conversation ended but the murmuring didn't die down until the doors opened and the First years came in, escorted by Minerva.
Draco didn't say nearly as much about Harry befriending a Muggleborn as opposed to a Gryffindor, and even then it was something along the lines of "adopting strays." Harry rolled his eyes at him and informed him that Hermione said they could hex Ronald whenever he wanted. Draco sobered at that and Blaise shook his head at them with a bemused expression. Theo just yelled at them to shut up so he could sleep.
"Who is it?" she heard Vernon yell.
Rose smirked wryly at the spat words, and even Severus looked amused. "Do not worry about the Weasley boy, Mr. Potter. Once someone harms a friend of the snakes, they all rally against them. Trust me, I know." Rose snorted at her friend. After Severus and Rose had become accepted by the Slytherins, they were protected fiercely as they quickly excelled at Potions and Defense respectively.
Without opening his eyes, he reached up and over the logs to grasp Rose, who was waiting for him. As soon as their hands met, the logs between them
And Harry could cry again-- a nap sounded absolutely
And then the visions began.
Harry came thumping down the stairs with his trunk and owl a minute later, and Rose decided to wait until later to ask him about moving in with her. Maybe she'd rent a larger flat, or a real house, whatever would give Harry the space he so needed. Rose smoothed her face out and smiled at the boy as he walked up to her. "Got everything, Harry?" He nodded, looking cautiously excited, so she glanced back to the Dursley couple and gave them nods as well. If she had anything to say about it, which she
There was silence for just a moment before the Slytherin table roared. Rose gave proud smile as she clapped, watching Harry go and sit with Draco. Next to her, she heard Severus give a quiet snort. "When I saw him, I was so sure he would go into Gryffindor like his parents. He's only known you two months, and look where he is," the man murmured to her.
Hermione had gotten him books, to no surprise. The subject was animals, both Magical and Mundane, and Harry realized he could use them to figure out what Rose's Animagius form was. So far, she had dropped no clues and he didn't know what exactly to look for either. The Weasley twins, Fred and George, had sent a box of "Wizardly Wheezes," whatever those were. They turned out to be prank sweets with a log of what they were and how to use them. Harry was sure Blaise and Draco would get a kick out of them.
"Sorry little bud I was really mean to make it up for you I'll take you to honey dukes today okay?" He smiled down at Harry.
"Class dismissed..." Snape scowled but before Draco could rush to have a word with him he ran into his office.
The letter ripped and turned it self into ashes and I relaxed into Tom's arms. "Well" I said "it wasn't so bad" I finished. My mates started laughing till they had tears in their eyes. Once they were done I talked to them again. "Don't we have something to do?" I asked them and Draco answered "house hunting" he exclaimed. I liked Draco. He is energetic and entertaining. He just made me happy with his personality and style. We got out of the bed and went to go take our showers and get ready for the day. Draco had on a silver suit that made his eyes gray eyes stand out.
"Oh," Harry sighed wiping tears from his face.
Neville was utterly stunned.
Harry complained.
"No whewre..." Harry was now giggling uncontrollably.
Everyone knew what Harry's life was like with the Dursley family, it came out after the war that his family used to abuse him and used him like a house elf, so there was no way that Draco would allow him to go back to that family. Then he would rather do it himself!
I got out of the bed silently and went to do my daily routine. Once done I put on a pair of black joggers and a white shirt to be comfortable while moving everything. Even though we had magic, magic couldn't be used on potions or ingredients, so I had to do it the muggle way and be very careful with my precious ingredients.
As they reached Hogsmead Draco put Harry down, " We're here bud!"
Lily Rose Potter (mother)
Draco hesitated, he didn't want Madam Pomfrey hurt, but was to protective over Harry so agreed.
"Hello Neville," Pansy smiled, "wanna have a cup of coffee get to no each other she winked.
I wrapped my arms around him too. "Don't let anyone see you in something like this" I whispered in his ear and he shivered against me and buried his head in my neck.
"Thanks Pans, Harry tomorrow we'll go get you some clothes. For now you can wear this..." he passed Harry a t shirt which was to small for him and some pants also to small for himself.
There was more of variety, sometimes in some places and in other others, more hatred. All this information he knew.
xxxxx
"Dumbledore?" Draco faced Dumbledore who was sitting quite peacefully in a leather chair.
Since the dose was small Harry shrunk slowly, at first Draco didn't notice it just teased him for being 'shorter' suddenly he had a reversed growth spurt he was now a tiny three year old Harry Potter....
"How's my little boo boo?" He asked.
Merlin
"What happened to you?" Pansy sniffed.
Draco cringed what type of question was that?
"Draco?" Neville asked as they were watching a movie.
He opened up a rather large toy trunk that housed dolls and trucks anything else you could really want to play with.
I knew I was blushing madly when Severus said that to me, I couldn't make the blush go away. I felt him chuckle and put 2 fingers under my chin to make me look into his pretty onix eyes.
Startled the man said, "yes um how would you like to pay?"
"No! We are gonna do something that's more fun than that party! We are going to Hogsmead," Draco stated.
"Where?" Pansy was stunned, but felt like she wanted it so bad and always had just been denying it.
His eyes followed the movement of his hand as he hastily tried to put the razor away with out his Professor noticing and he moved swiftly towards Harry, looming over the boy until the boy got awkwardly to his feet.
All the way they rushed to Dumbledore's office he comforted the boy growing a connection with the sweet baby boy. His dimples crinkled up when he laughed and drooped when he cried he was adorable, basically.
They soon talked about everything and anything eventually coming to a subject for Hermione to address.
"He kwilled my mowmma," Harry said playing with Draco's hair which was clearly very stuck firmly on his head.
"No it's okay it's nice to tell someone..." Hermione smiled.
"You'll get to stay up this late every night!" Draco smiled.
We walked around and one by one gaining our new wands/staffs.
Her hatred for boys really wasn't that weird.
The house elves cleaned up, then we went to all of our old homes to move everything we needed to the new one and soon we were finished.
Potter
Sincerely
"Well we better get OUT of the leaky cauldron!!"
"Fuck." Neville ran back to the dormitories.
"Can we go to the wand shop now?" Our little submissive asked as we walked all over the Alley.
Harry was looking up at Draco frowning, "I make Dwaco sad??" Harry broke down into uncontrollable crying.
"You're late again Mr. Malfoy...." Snape hissed at Malfoy. "I am surprised that Mr. Potter, has better attendance than you?"
We decided to go to Tom's manor first to get everything he wanted and needed that was necessary to him, but before we could apparate. Aiden sneezed and disappeared in a quiet pop.
Draco looked at the Honeydukes employee who looked startled said, "its - on- the - house d- d- d-" Draco rushed out before she could finish and ran straight up to Madam Pomfrey's.
When I heard his thundering foot steps reach the kitchen, I broke down into a mess and started sobbing as quietly as I could.
(See the end of the chapter for
‚Äò‚ÄôMe live thewe, ‚Äò‚Äô Harry sounded bored more than scared, What crap has this kid gone through? ‚Äò‚Äô Now lets wead stowy!‚Äô‚Äô
"Um, yeah, she was going down the corridor talking about Hogsmead?" Draco said.
The razor left jagged marks on his skin, dripping red lines from his wrist to one of the largest cuts his arm. He shoved the metal into his cloak pocket where it is always hidden, promising himself that he would take care-full time to clean it later and looked around, he was not quick enough to put away his razor.
"Ok Dwaco!" He nodded and continued playing with Bunbi.
"Har- Potter he's - turned - into - a - baby-?!?!???!!!!"
Where is my little boo? Where is he?'' He asked with a low chuckle, tickle - playing with the little boy.
They made their way to Honeydukes pushing open the store door.
"In my office, he's enjoying a lollipop!" She smiled, "such a cute boy your raising, Malfoy!"
"What are you hiding?" Neville asked being persistent.
Draco looked down at the cute little boys face giggling and clapping his hands together, Draco forgot all about his problems bumping into a wall, falling down and letting go of Harry.
"Whad???" Harry looked concerned.
I'm sorry it took me so long to update but I was sick
The two played barbies and monster trucks for maybe half an hour.
"Why don't you come sleep with me tonight?" Draco asked.
"I mean his life with the Dursleys, I think he was raped..." Draco was frustrated with Dumbledore how could he not care!?!
A gym we could work out in and practise our spell and duel work in.
Aisles and aisles of baby clothes lined the walls of the department he didn't know what to buy so being a Malfoy he bought it all.
That night he realized how much he loved that Potter boy and how he would be the BEST guardian wizard kind had ever seen!
Bloodfang cleared his throat. "Mr Lupin here is your mate," he said rather bluntly.
Putting your pain on us oh tho that's not fun!
"Welly?" Harry asked his big, green eyes twinkled with excitement.
"Let's watch Elmo my parents used to love making me watch it..." he searched the web until he found a channel just starting the movie.
"Yes, be back in 5 minutes..."

It has been brought to us The Goblins of Gringotts, that you have came into your magical and creature inheritance. We would like for you to come in so we could help you find out how strong you are.

What do we have here?'' He asked with a chuckle looking down on the little boy.
Draco helped Harry get up on to his back and then told him stories all the way to the Dungeons where their Dorms were.
"Yes Draco?" He listened.
