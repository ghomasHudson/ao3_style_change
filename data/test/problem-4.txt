An hour later the train had started moving, Draco, Goyle, Crabbe and Salem all had gotten up to stretch their legs. While they walked down the train they heard excited whispers about Violet Potter being in the second compartment. Draco had suggested they go see if it true or not.
The chessmen seemed to have been listening, because at these words a knight, a bishop, and a castle turned their backs on the white pieces and walked off the board, leaving three empty squares that Salem, Draco, and Blaise took.
"And now, before we go to bed, let us sing the school song!" cried Dumbledore.Salem noticed that the other teachers' smiles had become rather fixed.
"I bet you'll think twice about breaking a school rule again, won't you, eh?" he said, leering at them. "Oh yes. . . hard work and pain are the best teachers if you ask me. . . It's just a pity they let the old punishments die out. . . hang you by your wrists from the ceiling for a few days, I've got the chains still in my office, keep 'em well oiled in case they're ever needed. . . Right, off we go, and don't think of running off, now, it'll be worse for you if you do. "
But  Millicent, nervous and jumpy and frightened of being left on the ground, pushed off hard before the whistle had touched Madam Hooch's lips.
"Wonder how long Riddle's going to stay on his broom this time? Anyone want a bet? What about you, Zabini?"
Before Blaise could say another word, Draco had disappeared. Blaise turned the binoculars back on Salem. His broom was vibrating so hard, it was almost impossible for him to hang on much longer. The whole crowd was on its feet, watching, terrified, as the Beaters flew up to try and pull Salem safely onto one of their brooms, but it was no good - every time they got near him, the broom would jump higher still. They dropped lower and circled beneath him, obviously hoping to catch him if he fell. Oliver Wood seized the Quaffle and scored five times without anyone noticing.
Salem followed Howell Owler, and Fletcher Grace out of the locker room and, hoping his knees weren't going to give way, walked onto the field to loud cheers.
"No," said Salem, startled by the odd question. "We've only used the horn and tail hair in Potions. "
"Salem... You may be my son, but that doesn't mean you need to be brave all the time, especially around me, or the peers you may trust along your journey." Tom vocalized.
" Double Potions with Gryffindor, " said Salem " Have mercy on Sevy's soul, he's going to go insane with Potter around. " Salem chuckles.
" Your Mother was hit with a spell that I do not know of, yet, Salem. For now, you need to go back to your room. "
" That's a broomstick," he said, throwing it back to Salem with a mixture of jealousy and spite on his face. " You'll be in it for this time, Riddle, first years aren't allowed them."
Hagrid whispered. "Don' worry, it can't've gone far if it's this badly hurt, an' then we'll be able ter -- GET BEHIND THAT TREE!"
It was as though an iron fist had clenched suddenly around Salem's heart. Over the rustling of the trees.
could make a pineapple tap- dance across a desk. Professor McGonagall watched them turn a mouse into a snuff-box – points were given for how pretty the snuff-box was, but taken away if it had whiskers. Snape made them all nervous, breathing down their necks while they tried to remember how to make a Forgetfulness Potion.
"Yeah," said Hagrid, glancing up, too. "Listen, I'm glad we've run inter yeh, Ronan, 'cause there's a unicorn bin hurt -- you seen anythin'?"
Investigations continue into the break-in at Gringotts on the 31 July, widely believed to be the work of Dark wizards and witches unknown.
Salem was mad at both Draco and Blaise, they had gotten them all detention by sneaking into the kitchens that night. But to Draco's pleasure, Weasley had gotten detention too.
"Zabini, Blaise," was made a Slytherin and sat himself across from Pansy. Professor McGonagall rolled up her scroll and took the Sorting Hat away.
Meanwhile, in the locker room, Salem and the rest of the team were changing into their green Quidditch robes (Gryffindor would be playing in scarlett).
" Tom, my boy, put Harry Potter down, let us talk about this." A voice came from behind them, they turned to see who it was.
It was mid-afternoon when Salem and his friends had decided to go back to the dorms. But, Salem had something else different in mind...
" Don't get up Sal... Madam Pomfrey said you had multiple magical seizures, or something along those lines, while you were here. " Draco said, looking at his childhood friend in worry.
Lord Voldemort paced outside of his bedroom door as he waited for his Elven wife to give birth to their son, Salem Salazar Riddle if it was a boy or Syndra Salazar Riddle if it was a girl, they agreed to call the babe.
Salem had a lot of trouble keeping his mind on his lessons that day. It kept wandering up to the dormitory where his new broomstick was lying under his bed, or straying off to the Quidditch field where he'd be learning to play that night. He bolted his dinner that evening without noticing what he was eating, and then rushed upstairs with Ron to unwrap the Nimbus Two Thousand at last.
It happened again. It was as though the broom was trying to buck him off. But Nimbus Two Thousands did not suddenly decide to buck their riders off. Salem tried to turn back toward the Slytherin goal-posts -- he had half a mind to ask Flint to call time-out -- and then he realized that his broom was completely out of his control. He couldn't turn it. He couldn't direct it at all. It was zigzagging through the air, and every now and then making violent swishing movements that almost unseated him.
It contains your Nimbus Two Thousand, but I don't want everyone knowing you've got a broomstick or they'll all want one. Marcus Flint will meet you on the Quidditch fields at seven o'clock for your first training session.
Hardly anyone had seen Salem play because Flint had decided that, as their secret weapon, Salem should be kept, well, secret. But the news that he was playing Seeker had leaked out somehow, and  Salem didn't know which was worse -- people telling him he'd be brilliant or people telling him they'd be running around underneath him holding a mattress.
He tried to edge to the left, to get in front of the glass without Quirrell noticing, but the ropes around his ankles were too tight: he tripped and fell over. Quirrell ignored him. He was still talking to himself.
Quirrell moved close behind him. Salem breathed in the funny smell that seemed to come from Quirrell's turban. He closed his eyes, stepped in front of the mirror, and opened them again.
"Ah, music," he said, wiping his eyes. "A magic beyond all we do here! And now, bedtime. Off you trot!"
Salem pulled the letter from his dad out of his bag, he had gotten a letter knife from another Slytherin to open the wax seal on the letter.
Welcome," he said. "Welcome to a new year at Hogwarts! Before we begin our banquet, I would like to say a few words. And here they are: Nitwit! Blubber! Oddment! Tweak!
Salem went to bed with his head buzzing with the same question. Crabbe was snoring loudly, but Salem couldn't sleep. He tried to empty his mind — he needed to sleep, he had to, he had his first Quidditch match in a few hours.
But as they knew for sure about the mysterious object was that it was about two inches long, they didn't have much chance of guessing what it was without further clues.
" I remember every wand I sold,  Mr. Riddle. Every single wand. It so happens that the phoenix whose tail is in your wand, gave another feather — just one other. It is very curious indeed that you are destined for this wand when it's brother — why, it's brother is your father's wand. "
"It's obvious," said Draco. "You can pretend to be waiting for Professor Flitwick, you know." He put on a high voice, "'Oh Professor Flitwick, I'm so worried, I think I got question fourteen b wrong... '"
"I don't care if Weasley has, but if something's got Blaise. . . it's our fault he's here in the first place. "
Marcus Flint had arrived. He was carrying a large wooden crate under his arm. Salem landed next to him.
WHAM! A roar of rage echoed from the Slytherin below — Oliver Wood had blocked Salem on purpose, and Salem's broom spun off course, Salem holding on for dear life.
"Salem, everyone says Dumbledore's the only one You-Know-Who was ever afraid of with Dumbledore around, You-Know-Who won't touch you. Anyway, who says the centaurs are right? It sounds like fortune-telling to me, and Minerva says that's a very imprecise branch of magic. "
— lives in a hut on the school grounds and every now and then he gets drunk, tries to do magic, and ends up setting fire to his bed. "
They walked in silence, their eyes on the ground. Every now and then a ray of moonlight through the branches above lit a spot of silver-blue blood on the fallen leaves.
At these words, Blaise seized Draco's binoculars, but instead of looking up at Salem, he started looking frantically at the crowd.
Where should he start? He stopped, and thought. And then it came to him. The Restricted Section in the library. He'd be able to read as long as he liked, as long as it took to find out who Flamel was. He set off.
Tom took that disgusting glamor of his son, black messy hair and the Killing Curse green eyes, but he did make sure to write it up and lock it away.
They were looking straight into the eyes of a monstrous dog. a dog that filled the whole space between ceiling and floor. It had three heads. Three pairs of rolling, mad eyes, three noses, twitching and quivering in their direction; drooling mouths, saliva hanging in slippery ropes from yellow fangs. It was standing quite still, all six eyes staring at them, and Salem knew that the only reason they weren't dead was that their sudden appearance had taken it by surprise, but it was quickly getting over that, there was no mistaking what those thunderous growls meant.
Too eager to fly again to wait for Flint, Salem mounted his broomstick and kicked off from the ground. What a feeling — he swooped in and out of the goal posts and then sped up and down the field. The Nimbus Two Thousand turned wherever he wanted at his lightest touch.
He held his head up high, daring anyone to question his power as he walked up to his father, sitting on his throne with his head also held high, ready to curse any of his death eaters if need be.
" No, no — here, ebony and unicorn hair, eight and a half inches, springy. Go on, go on, try it out."
Millicent, her face tear-streaked, clutching her wrist, hobbled off with Madam Hooch, who had her arm around her.
Professor Flitwick, the Charms teacher, was a tiny little wizard who had to stand on a pile of books to see over his desk. At the start of their first class he took role call, When he reached Salem's name he gave a terrified squeak and toppled out of sight.
It looked like an unused classroom. The dark shapes of desks and chairs were piled against the walls, and there was an upturned wastepaper basket — but propped against the wall facing him was something that didn't look as if it belonged there, something that looked as if someone had just put it there to keep it out of the way.
"I found out something about him," he told Severus. "He tried to get past that three-headed dog on Halloween. It bit him. We think he was trying to steal whatever it's guarding. "
" Hold out your preferred arm. That's it. " He measured Salem from shoulder to finger, then wrist to elbow, shoulder to the floor, knee to armpit, and round his head. As he measured, he said, " Every Ollivander wand has a core of powerful magical substance, Mr. Riddle. We use unicorn hairs, phoenix tail feathers, and the heartstring of dragons. No two Ollivander wands are the same, just as no unicorns, dragons, or phoenixes are the quite the same. And of course you will never get such good results with another wizard's wand. "
Gringotts goblins insisted that nothing had been taken. The vault that was searched had in fact been emptied that same day.
They walked on through the dense, dark trees. Salem kept looking nervously over his shoulder. He had the nasty feeling they were being watched. He was very glad they had Hagrid and his crossbow with them. They had just passed a bend in the path when Draco grabbed Salem's arm.
" The Sorting Ceremony will take place in a few minutes in front the rest of the school. I suggest you all smarten yourselves up as much as you can as you are waiting."
Salem woke up at the crack of dawn on September 1. He smartens himself up with a dark forest green robe with silver fastenings. As soon as he finished he headed downstairs into the Dining Hall.
"It's okay!" he called up to the light the size of a postage stamp, which was the open trapdoor, "it's a soft landing, you can jump!"
He saw his reflection, pale and scared-looking at first. But a moment later, the reflection smiled at him. It put its hand into its pocket and pulled out a blood-red stone. It winked and put the Stone back in its pocket — and as it did so, Salem felt something heavy drop into his real pocket. Somehow — incredibly —he'd gotten the Stone.
Bane walked over to stand next to Ronan. He looked skyward. "Mars is bright tonight," he said simply.
Salem left the locker room alone some time later, to take his Nimbus Two Thousand back to the broomshed. He couldn't ever remember feeling happier. He'd really done something to be proud of now— he didn't have to pretend to be a nobody. The evening air had never smelled so sweet. He walked over the damp grass, reliving the last hour in his head, which was a happy blur: Slytherins running to lift him onto their shoulders; Blaise and Draco in the distance, jumping up and down.
The next morning dawned very bright and cold. The Great Hall was full of the delicious smell of fried sausages and the cheerful chatter of everyone looking forward to a good Quidditch match.
"Yeah," said Blaise, "and lucky Salem doesn't lose his head in a crisis — 'there's no wood,' honestly."
" Father. Didn't think you would come, " Salem sat up, ignoring Draco's protest. " did you come to reprimand me? "
And then, once you had managed to find them, there were classes themselves. But it was no ordinary Muggle school class. They had to study the night skies through their telescopes every Wednesday at midnight and learn the names of different stars and the movement of the planets. Three times a week they went out to greenhouses behind the castle to study Herbology, with a dumpy little witch called Professor Sprout, where they learned how to take care of all strange plants an fungi, and found out what they were used for.
He put Lucius' flute to his lips and blew, his hands working delicately against the keys. It was a beautiful tune, from the first note the beast's eyes began to droop. Salem hardly drew breath. Slowly, the dog's growls ceased — it tottered on its paws and fell to its knees, then it slumped to the ground, fast asleep.
Tom sighed softly, as he looked at his son peacefully asleep. As much as he wanted Salem to stay a kid while he still can, he knew it was inevitable with the war he planned to start with Dumbledore. It'll be dishonoring the wishes of his wife, Aelinor, forcing Salem to grow up faster than he should...
" Well, no one really knows until they get there, do they, but I know I'll be in Slytherin, all of our family have been — imagine being in Hufflepuff, I think I'd leave, wouldn't you?"
"Will you stop messing around!" he yelled. "That's exactly the sort of thing that'll lose us the match! "
A tinkling bell rang somewhere in the depths of the shop as they stepped inside. It was a tiny place, empty except for a few spindly chairs that the adults sat on to wait.
Salem knew that there were seven hundred ways of committing a Quidditch foul and that all of them had happened during a World Cup match in 1473; that Seekers were usually the smallest and fastest players, and that most serious Quidditch accidents seemed to happen to them; that although people rarely died playing Quidditch, referees had been known to vanish and turn up months later in the Sahara Desert.
Hermione stretched her hand as high into the air as it would go without her leaving her seat. Salem and his group was shaking with laughter.
"This is where I leave you," Firenze murmured as Hagrid hurried off to examine the unicorn. "You are safe now. "
Salem was gliding over the game, squinting about for some sign of the Snitch. This was part of his and Flint's game plan.
"You're saying it wrong," Salem heard Granger snap. "It's Wing- gar -dium Levi- o -sa, make the 'gar' nice and long. "
Potions lesson took place down in one of the dungeons. It was colder her than up in the main castle, — luck enough, Salem already had the heating charm on his robes and his friends — and would have been creepy enough without the pickled animals floating in glass jars all around the walls.
They had practical exams as well. Professor Flitwick called them one by one into his class to see if they
" Yes, thirteen-and-a-half inches. Yew. Curious indeed how these things happen. The wand chooses the wizard, remember. . . . I think we must expect great things from you, Mr. Riddle. . . . After all. He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named did great things, terrible, yes,  but great." (- Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone pgs. 71-85 )
Tom sits on the side of the bed, his right-hand rests itself on Salem's forehead, trying to sense temperature. Salem's eyes widen, this was the first time that Tom had shown his fatherly side ever since they lost his mother.
Salem had almost forgotten that the exam results were still to come, but come they did. Both Draco and Blaise passed with good marks; Salem, of course, had the best grades of the first years.
It was swelteringly hot, especially in the large classroom where they did their written papers. They had been given special, new quills for the exams, which had been bewitched with an Anti- Cheating spell.
"It was Quirrell." Draco was explaining, "Blaise and I saw him. He was cursing your broomstick, muttering, he wouldn't take his eyes off you. "
Salem ran to their dark dormitory. He pulled out the flute Lucius had given him for Christmas. He pocketed it to use on the Cerberus — he didn't feel much like singing.
Salem tried. And tried. He had no idea what Mr. Ollivander was waiting for. The pile of tried wand was mounting higher and higher on another spindly chair, blimey, it was higher than Draco's pile, but the more wands Mr. Ollivander pulled from the shelves, the happier he seemed to become.
Up in the air, Severus turned on his broomstick just in time to see something green shoot past him, missing him by inches — the next second, Salem had pulled out of the dive, his arm raised in triumph, the Snitch clasped in his hand.
"Yes," said Quirrell idly, walking around the mirror to look at the back. "He was on to me by that time, trying to find out how far I'd got. He suspected me all along. Tried to frighten me — as though he could, when I had Lord Grindelwald on my side..."
"Not if I can help it," said Draco grimly. "Flitwick told me in secret that I got a hundred and twelve percent on his exam. They're not throwing me out after that."
They each seized a broomstick and kicked off into the air, soaring into the midst of the cloud of keys. They grabbed and snatched, but the bewitched keys darted and dived so quickly it was almost impossible to catch one.
"Can't be too careful, Ronan," said Hagrid, patting his crossbow. "There's summat bad loose in this forest. This is Salem Riddle an' Draco Malfoy, by the way. Students up at the school. An' this is Ronan, you two. He's a centaur.
A pink faced girl with blonde pigtails stumbled out of line, put on the hat which fell right down over her eyes, and sat down. A moment pause —
A plump woman outside an Apothecary was shaking her head as they passed, saying, "Dragon liver, sixteen Sickles an ounce, they're mad. . . ."
"Okay, men," he said. "This is the best team Slytherin's had in years. We're going to win. I know it. "
Friday was an important day for Salem and his group. They finally managed to find their way to the Great Hall without getting lost once.
So Salem set off into the heart of the forest with Weasley and Fang. They walked for nearly half an hour, deeper and deeper into the forest, until the path became almost impossible to follow because the trees were so thick. Salem thought the blood seemed to be getting thicker. There were splashes on the roots of a tree, as though the poor creature had been thrashing around in pain close by. Salem could see a clearing ahead, through the tangled branches of an ancient oak.
The Slytherin common room was very noisy that evening. Salem, Draco, and Blaise sat together next to a window. Salem was checking Draco and Blaise's Charms homework for them. He would never let them copy ("How will you learn?"), but by asking him to read it through, they got the right answers anyway.
"Come on, Salem!" Blaise screamed, leaping onto his seat to watch as Salem sped straight at Severus — he didn't even notice Weasley and Draco rolling around under his seat, or the scuffles and yelps coming from the whirl of fists that was Pansy, Finnigan, and Dean.
"Who's there?" he said suddenly as they climbed toward him. He narrowed his wicked black eyes. "Know you're there, even if I can't see you. Are you ghoulie or ghostie or wee student beastie?"
Salem nodded, but he couldn't shake off a lurking feeling that there was something he'd forgotten to do, something important. When he tried to explain this,Draco said, "That's just the exams. I woke up last night and was halfway through my Transfiguration notes before I remembered we'd done that one."
"Probably," said Salem. "They don't look very vicious, but I suppose if they all swooped down at once... well, there's no other choice... I'll run."
The table on the right cheered and clapped as Hannah went to sit down at the Hufflepuff table. Salem saw the ghost of the Fat Friar wave merrily at her.
FLUMP. With a funny, muffled sort of thump he landed on something soft. He sat up and felt around, his eyes not used to the gloom. It felt as though he was sitting on some sort of plant.
The Dark Lord and Lady walked up to the house of the Potters in Godric's Hollow. Tom blasted the door away.
A voice echoed through the train: " We will be reaching Hogwarts in five minutes' time. Please leave your luggage on the train, it will be taken to the school separately. "
Professor McGonagall was again different. Salem had been quite right to think she wasn't a teacher to cross. Strict and clever, she gave them a talking-to the moment they sat down in her first class.
" My dear Friar, haven't we given Peeves all the chances he deserves? He gives us all a bad name and you know, he's not not even a ghost — I say, what are you all doing here?"
Salem did the best he could, trying to ignore the stabbing pains in his forehead, which had been bothering him ever since his trip into the forest. Daphne thought Salem had a bad case of exam nerves because Salem couldn't sleep, but the truth was that Salem kept being woken by his old nightmare, except that it was now worse than ever because there was a hooded figure dripping blood in it.
As the owls flooded into the Great Hall, as usual, everyone's attention was caught at once by a long, thin package carried by six large screech owls.  Salem was just as interested as everyone else to see what was in this large parcel,  and was amazed when the owls soared down and dropped it right in front of him, knocking his bacon to the floor. They had hardly fluttered out of the way when another owl had dropped a letter on top of the parcel.
"All right." Draco gritted his teeth and stepped carefully over the dog's legs. He bent and pulled the ring of the trapdoor, which swung up and open.
Even worse than Peeves, if that was possible, was the caretaker, Argus Filch. Salem and his group managed to get on the wrong side of him on their very first morning. Filch found them trying to force their way through a door that unluckily had turned out to be the entrance to the out-of-bounds corridor on he third floor. He wouldn't believe they were lost, was sure they were trying to break into it on purpose, and was threatening to lock them in the dungeons when they were rescued by Professor Quirrell, who was passing.
Below, in a shadowy clearing, stood Severus, but he wasn't alone. Quirrell was there, too. Salem couldn't make out the look on his face, but he was stuttering worse than ever. Salem strained to catch what they were saying.
He walked up to a black knight and put his hand out to touch the knight's horse. At once, the stone sprang to life. The horse pawed the ground and the knight turned his helmeted head to look down at Ron.
Salem did have his own an owl hat he barely used, but his Father did. His snowy owl dropped a letter in his lap and accepted a piece of toast before flying away. On the front of the letter it said not to open the letter until he was alone. Salem knew it was from his Father it was in his neat scripted handwriting.
Salem didn't know whether he was imagining it or not, but he seemed to keep running into Quirrell wherever he went. At times, he even wondered whether Quirrell was following him, trying to catch him on his own.  Defense Against the Dark Arts' lessons were turning into a sort of weekly torture, Quirrell was so horrible to Salem. Could Quirrell possibly know they'd found out about the Sorcerer's Stone? Salem didn't see how he could — yet he sometimes had the horrible feeling that Quirrell could read minds.
After a short while, they heard panting from Lily as the baby was finally out of her stomach, but they didn't hear the baby..
Blaise did not show the slightest interest in what lay underneath the dog and the trapdoor. All Blaise cared about was never going near that dog again.
"I won't let you do it," she said, hurrying to stand in front of the portrait. "I'll —I'll fight you!"
How long he stood there, he didn't know. The reflections did not fade and he looked and looked until a distant noise brought him back to his senses. He couldn't stay here, he had to find his way back to bed. He tore his eyes away from his mother's face, whispered, "I'll come back," and hurried from the room.
There was a sudden rummage for quills and parchment. Over the noise, Snape said, " And a point will be taken from Gryffindor House for your cheek, Potter."
"Always the innocent are the first victims," he said. "So it has been for ages past, so it is now. "
Salem sprang toward the flame door, but Grindelwald screamed "SEIZE HIM!" and the next second, Salem felt Quirrell's hand close on his wrist. At once, a needle-sharp pain seared across Salem's forehead; his head felt as though it was about to split in two; he yelled, struggling with all his might, and to his surprise, Quirrell let go of him. The pain in his head lessened —he looked around wildly to see where Quirrell had gone, and saw him hunched in pain, looking at his fingers — they were blistering before his eyes.
that day, our little group of Slytherins was in the common rooms, writing essays. Salem excused himself and Draco to go to Severus' chambers. When they had reached the chamber they didn't bother to knock, just going right in, knowing Severus would be fine with it.
He led them to the very edge of the forest. Holding his lamp up high, he pointed down a narrow, winding earth track that disappeared into the thick black trees. A light breeze lifted their hair as they looked into the forest.
The forest was black and silent. A little way into it they reached a fork in the earth path, and Salem, Draco, and Hagrid took the left path while Weasley, Blaise, and Fang took the right.
There will be a five-chapter short story in between each of the main books. If you ever have suggestions on what they should contain please feel free to email or comment on one of the chapters!
" Mind telling me what the bloody hell that was?" Salem's voice was rather calm but held a strain on it.
"We've got to close in on it!" Salem called, not taking his eyes off the key with the damaged wing. " Draco, you come at it from above Blaise, stay below and stop it from going down and I'll try and catch it. Right, NOW!"
They heard him crashing away through the undergrowth and stood looking at each other, very scared, until they couldn't hear anything but the rustling of leaves around them.
"Stay there!" Draco said, and he sprinted up the stairs to the boys' dormitories. Salem and Blaise barely had time to exchange mystified looks before she was dashing back, an enormous old book in his arms.
Salem stood rooted to the spot as Filch and Quirrell came around the corner ahead. They couldn't see him, of course, but it was a narrow corridor and if they came much nearer they'd knock right into him.
"Don't be a fool," snarled the face. "Better save your own life and join me... or you'll meet the same end as your mother and soon your father... He will die, begging me for mercy..."
" Look!" said Wesley, darting forward and snatching something out of the grass. " It's that stupid thing Bulstrode's gram sent her."
They had reached a snowy white building that towered over the other little shops. Standing beside its burnished bronze doors, wearing a uniform of scarlet and gold, was —
Draco had managed to free himself before the plant got a firm grip on him. Now he watched in horror as the two boys fought to pull the plant off them, but the more they strained against it, the tighter and faster the plant wound around them.
Sometimes, Salem noticed, the hat shouted out the house at once, but at others it took a little while to decide. "Finnigan, Seamus," the sandy-haired boy next to Salem in the line, sat on the stool for almost a whole minute before the hat declared him a Gryffindor.
After dinner the three of them sat nervously apart in the common room. Nobody bothered them; none of the Slytherins had anything to say to Salem, wanting their Lord's son to have some peace. Draco was skimming through all his notes, hoping to come across one of the enchantments they were about to try to break. Salem and Blaise didn't talk much. Both of them were thinking about what they were about to do.
" Think my name's funny, do you? No need to ask who you are. My Father told me that all the Weasleys have red hair, freckles, and more children then they can afford. "
Salem took the wand. He felt a sudden warmth in his fingers. He raised the wand above his head, brought is swishing down through the dust air and a stream of green and sliver sparks shot from the end forming the shape of a snake, throwing dancing spots of light onto the walls. The adults and Draco politely clapped and Mr. Ollivander cried out, " Oh bravo! Yes, indeed, oh very good. Well, well, well. . . how curious, how very curious. . . "
A low, soft hooting came from a dark shop with a sign saying Eeylops Owl Emporium — Tawny, Screech, Barns, Brown, and Snowy. Several boys around Salem's and Draco's age had their nose pressed against a window with broomsticks in it. " Look." Salem heard one of them say, " the new Nimbus Two Thousand — fastest ever —" There were shops selling robes, shops selling telescopes and silver instruments ( section deleted ), windows stacked with barrels of bat spleens and eels' eye, tottering piles of spell books, quills, and rolls of parchment, potion bottles, globes of the moon . . . .
"And the Quaffle is taken immediately by Angelina Johnson of Gryffindor -- what an excellent Chaser that girl is, and rather attractive, too--"
Draco took a different view of things. He was torn between horror at the idea of Salem being out of bed ("If Filch had caught you!"), and disappointment that he hadn't at least found out who Nicolas Flamel was.
"Yes, yes, that's right," said Professor Flitwick, beaming at Salem. "Professor Snape told me all about the special circumstances, Riddle. And what model is it?"
" The four Houses are called Gryffindor, Hufflepuff, Ravenclaw, and Slytherin.   Each House has its own noble history and each has produced outstanding witches and wizards. While you are at Hogwarts, your triumphs will earn your House points , while any rule breaking will lose House points. At the end of the year, the House with the most points is awarded the House Cup, a great honor. I hope each of you will be a credit to which ever House becomes yours.
They were standing on the edge of a huge chessboard, behind the black chessmen, which were all taller than they were and carved from what looked like black stone. Facing them, way across the chamber, were the white pieces. Salem, Draco and Blaise shivered slightly - the towering white chessmen had no faces.
"Seize him! SEIZE HIM!" shrieked Grindelwald again, and Quirrell lunged, knocking Salem clean off his feet landing on top of him, both hands around Salem's neck — Salem's forehead was almost blinding him with pain, yet he could see Quirrell howling in agony.
Salem got the message he was trying to send to Potter, he wants her and her little group to travel to he third-floor corridor on the right-hand side.
Salem got up from the couch and threw the letter in the fire before sitting back down and starting on his homework.
" I did not. I'm not mad nor am I disappointed in you. " Tom glanced at Lucius, sending the silent message for he, Draco, and Severus to leave the room. Lucius gives a short nod at him, taking Draco's hand and leading the two others out of the room.
"Draco! Draco! Where are you? The game's over! Salem's won! We've won! Slytherin is in the lead!" shrieked Blaise, dancing up and down on his seat.
I've found him!" Salem whispered. "I've found Flamel! I told you I'd read the name somewhere before, I read it on the train coming here — listen to this: 'Dumbledore is particularly famous for his defeat of the dark wizard Grindelwald in 1945, for the discovery of the twelve uses of dragon's blood, and his work on alchemy with his partner, Nicolas Flamel'!"
" Now we need to hurry to Ollivanders, Salem, your father already left he says he has important business that he needs to tend to now. " Lucius claims.
Blaise went speeding in the direction that Salem was pointing, crashed into the ceiling, and nearly fell off his broom.
"Can't have," Draco said, his voice shaking. "Can't nothing interfere with a broomstick except powerful Dark magic -- no kid could do that to a Nimbus Two Thousand. "
Salem had taken one step toward it when a slithering sound made him freeze where he stood. A bush on the edge of the clearing quivered. . . Then, out of the shadows, a hooded figure came crawling across the ground like some stalking beast. Salem, Weasley, and Fang stood transfixed. The cloaked figure reached the unicorn, lowered its head over the wound in the animal's side, and began to drink its blood.
The class everyone had really been looking forward to was Defense Against the Dark Arts, — well, everyone but the Death Eater Children — but Quirrell's lesson turned to be a bit of a joke. His classroom smelled strongly of garlic, which everyone said was to ward off a vampire he'd meet in Romania and was afraid would be coming back to get him one of these day. His turban, he told them, had been given to him by an African prince as a thank-you for getting rid of a troublesome zombie, but they weren't sure they were believing this story. For one thing, when Tracy Davis asked eagerly to hear how Quirrell had fought off the zombie, Quirrell went pink and started talking about the weather; for another, they had noticed that a funny smell hung around the turban, and Dirk Lynch, a 5th year Slytherin, insisted that it was stuff full of garlic as well, so that Quirrell was protected wherever he went.
The group heads into Magical Menagerie. Salem instantly sees a snake that catches his interest. He identified it as a Black Mamba. Salem felt a special connection with him, he opens the cage, the snake slithering onto his arm instantly.
There was a pop, and a little man with wicked, dark eyes and a wide mouth appeared, floating cross- legged in the air, clutching the walking sticks.
She gasped. So did the people around her. About twenty ghost has streamed through the back wall. Pearly white, and slightly transparent, they glided across the room talking to one another and hardly glancing at the first years. They seemed to be arguing. What looked like a fat little monk saying: " Forgive and Forget, I say, we ought to give him a second chance —"
"He is with me wherever I go," said Quirrell quietly. "I met him when I traveled around the world. A foolish young man I was then, full of ridiculous ideas about good and evil. Lord Grindelwald showed me how wrong I was. There is no good and evil, there is only power, and those too weak to seek it... Since then, I have served him faithfully, although I have let him down many times. He has had to be very hard on me." Quirrell shivered suddenly. "He does not forgive mistakes easily. When I failed to steal the stone from Gringotts, he was most displeased. He punished me... decided he would have to keep a closer watch on me..."
Another positive thing about you...hm...I guess how earnest you are—it's sickeni—" He hissed in pain as he got stung again.
"Good. That's good...I asked Ron to let me stay behind, didn't want to wake you..." He was rambling in his still not quite cognizant state, a yawn interrupting his sentence. He looked about ready to collapse again and Draco had to do something to ignore how his heart skipped a beat. So he insulted him:
Potter gave Pansy an odd look upon taking note of the seating arrangements, but knew better than to comment, so he just silently sat down while Draco did the same. They stared straight ahead of themselves, seemingly pretending the other didn't exist.
Harry did the opposite, secondhand embarrassment spreading through him as he buried his nose on his knees as an attempt to hide his presence. He certainly didn’t want to hear or imagine the details of Ron and, dear Merlin, a bloke, making out or humping on each other like bunnies.
"I’m not leaving, Parkinson. I’m just about to join the game." Harry captured her hands and gripped it flirtatiously. He was certain his Gryffindor streak was showing. "I’m not a coward."
Harry's mind was suddenly bombarded with thoughts of needing to ask Malfoy. Malfoy looked softer than usual. A look that said he was in no mood to harass Harry or taunt him, so Harry tried.
Harry was lost in thinking again. He was speechless and in no position to meddle with Malfoy's business, yet his disturbance about this sensitive topic was extreme.
Harry furrowed his eyebrows and swallowed a spoonful of his morning porridge, his other hand grasping his croissant nimbly. His stomach ached once the porridge reached his digestive system, growling for more food. He just realized he really was hungry he could eat a cow.
The blond rolled his eyes. "Get on with it, Potter, please because your mere presence is suffocating the life out of me," Malfoy said impatiently and Harry's brows furrowed in anger.
"You go fetch the pail and cloth from the cabinet and I’ll go get the detergent, these are all what we need," Draco said blandly, face saying he didn't want any conversation with Potter besides cleaning.
"Let me push you off when I get my strength, it won't be long for the potion to take effect," Harry suggested with a soft voice, and it seemed to help calm Malfoy down since he had let himself fall heavy on him, face on the crook of Harry's neck.
"Harry – " Hermione started but Harry stopped her sentence immediately by raising his index finger. He knew what she has about to say about what happened last Saturday night, and he didn't want to hear any of it, from anyone at all who attempts to remind him.
"I've been following you for weeks and it wasn't some big of a deal? That we should forget?" Harry rose up and found his wand on the floor, spelling his clothes and glasses back to his body before he sat down properly. His arse still stung, so he sat in a rather awkward position. "You're an arse, Malfoy. You're a great big
"You know what Malfoy? I'd like to see you try," Harry teased, actually waiting for Draco to say an apology to him. He was confident he wouldn't receive any kiss from him. Draco didn't swing that way. He knew that they both didn't swing that way because of their preferences. He saw Draco blatantly flirting with a girl one time behind a pillar, and so was he, who had crushes on girls, shagged with Cho Chang and other than that, he was filled with fantasies of having it on the bed with a girl, girlish moans filling his ears, getting ridden by a fantastic girl who could lead. Someone soft and girly was enough of a turn on.
“Potter,” Malfoy said again, raising his eyebrows. Harry wasn’t sure, but the blond’s cheeks were red. “You
you laugh at me,” said Draco, though the usual finesse of his voice wasn’t completely there. He said it rather out of confusion.
Malfoy threw him a scornful glance, not at all sorry for his action. "Neck is one of the weak points of a human body and Healers found out that weak points emit the strongest of scents, and what would you respond if someone asks you to smell your neck? Knowing your Gryffindor arse, you'd blast me off this room without using your brain! Better sniff than never."
Harry bit his lower lip after, not sure if his statement made any sense. When he looked up, he saw Parkinson and Zabini looking at each other, their faces replaced with what he could label as fear or worry.
, Harry could add but hindered himself, staring intently at Draco's eyes instead. Draco's grip too tight on Harry's wrist.
Harry drew in a deep breath, uncomfortable from the contact. "Well, bear with it, Malfoy. It's just for a night. Consider yourself lucky since you have someone to comfort you.”
Draco pulled Harry's front, tipped his head forward and crashed his tight-lipped mouth to Harry's own, freezing on his spot. Suddenly, the air was hotter, Harry's cheeks burned with his heart pounding. He didn't wait for the other boy's sentence to be finished anymore, he moved his lips without pattern and Harry's wand dropped on the floor, not catching up with what was happening before him.
Draco's cheeks pinked, but he didn’t look like he welcomed the feeling of it so he huffed and raised his pointy chin, back again to his default self.
Draco sighed and took a moment to bite on his apple. After chewing, he wiped his mouth with the back of his free arm that held the apple, eyes cool and blank. "Let's see," he scrunched his brows, "a dolt just asked me to speak to him if he won the duel, in which that person in question needn't poking his nose.
"Formal?" Harry scrunched his eyebrows and stared at his chest and legs. He was wearing his robe normally and he looked decent enough for classes so there was nothing wrong with him. "What are you talking about?"
Draco groaned and Harry closed his eyes again, curling inwardly to keep warm, attempting to sleep. He was used to this. The cupboard he slept in for eleven years was smaller than this room. Draco didn’t complain anymore, or at least Harry's tired-induced body said he should ignore whatever Draco was complaining about. He remained still for many minutes and instinctively rolled himself to face the other side, seeking comfort, only to hear a knee bump on a nose. He flicked his eyes open, finding Malfoy sitting beside him, hugging his legs together, shaky eyes trained on the small window that showed little moonlight from the outside. Based on Harry's point of view, it was Malfoy who's not used to being closed in such a small space – and the boy was barely three inches away from him. But Harry didn’t move, instead, he kept his eyes fixed on Malfoy. After a few seconds, the blond finally noticed Harry looking at him, horror washing his face.
Five minutes before six, Harry went ahead to Professor McGonagall's office in his pyjamas. He didn’t talk to anyone through the course of the afternoon (since he stayed in the Hospital Wing for a good hour, getting his bruises tended with Malfoy) and finished his Charms assignments in his dormitory, avoiding Ron and Hermione at all cost.
"I’m just saying you would be a great Potions master if you pursue it," Harry said, and he wasn't joking if he says Malfoy was like McGonagall when teaching – that is, excluding the bits of Malfoy being childish who bully people off their rocker, he was rather a good mentor.
Harry was annoyed again, at some point he thought of saying this wasn't a great idea and burst out of the cupboard with a bang, but he managed his temper. "I won the duel. So you will do as I say!"
And why was Malfoy, of all people, the first man he kissed? And the first bloke who had the honor of feeling Harry's man equipment? Harry shuddered, revolted, and forgot Malfoy was on top of him.
" Ron fanned at himself. "Just ol' McGonagall assigning us some tasks just in case something bad happens during Inter-House."
The other side of the room felt like a slap of coldness and wind of a strong hailstorm, his skin almost numbing from the cold sensation. He shuddered, scanning the room that consisted of stacked objects scattered around him messily like mountains of junks. Everything was randomly piled and he tip-toed across the mess, doffing off his robe as he stepped forward. His quivering hands unbuttoned his shirt, removing everything up to down his trousers, exposing all of his bare skin to the room where eventually Malfoy would see him with
Draco arched his brow. “I don’t believe you’d be able to digest what you'd read from there, Potter.”
"Dilly-dallying in a very fine morning, Mr. Potter? What are your glasses for then?" Snape looked at him like what a normal person would look at an insect, and as usual, the Professor looked brooding and revolted of knowing a Potter still exists to this day. Harry composed himself for a moment. This was not a perfect time to let Snape add to his list of triggers this morming.
Draco’s ears pinked, cursing and burying his head on his palm. Harry sighed and stared at the blond, who was trembling and looked like on the verge of hyperventilating. He had quite been wise enough to know that Malfoy’s pride was extremely high – even if he was on the brink of dying, he wouldn’t ask for Harry's help. This wasn’t something to tease about, Harry thought. Draco seemed genuinely scared coiling like a cat like this. He wanted to ask what caused it but he didn’t want to brew up another fight with Malfoy.
Harry's eyes widened, though his recovery was immediate. Avoiding any awkward interactions, he shot back his own signature smirk towards her that he was sure made some girls blush at some point.
"You told me I could do anything." Malfoy pulled on his hair and Harry groaned at the sensation. "So, now, you martyr, what do you actually want from me? You want this type of attention from me after all this time, Potter?" Malfoy whispered, breath almost as discomposed as Harry's. Harry didn't know what to say now when his head was fucked. What did he even want again? He canted his head backward and stared at Malfoy's pinked face, lost for words, lost what to respond. He didn't know either.
Harry seemed to have been triggered by the word 'Malfoy' and looked Ron in the eyes, eyes flicking fire that it took Ron a moment to swallow his oat. He didn't like it when Harry did that, he was scary, the ones that made girls intimidated and at the same time, liked him more. They liked anything mysterious like Harry, and his best friend wasn't aware he's a heartthrob, waiting for Harry to notice them and get him to bed.
"You and your Gryffindor friends are a bunch of gits, you know that?" Draco said. "Making nonsensical and non-brain theories. What a bunch of
get off fighting with you," Pansy said, and Harry did not miss the smirk that was quick to vanish off Blaise's face as Harry's face heated. Pansy's unannounced laughter reminded Harry of a tickled cat in Mrs. Figg's house.
This was the first time he’d seen Draco Malfoy up close again since his incident. He looked all better in his natural color and was wearing some casual loose robes.
hear him, it'll be about his mum and their festivities at their manor. Although he's more childish when he was younger, but... you know, Draco's just
Harry kept calling his name, making sure Draco was in his line of sight. Harry dashed like his life depended on it and successfully clasped on Malfoy's shoulder. He turned the boy around, yanked him, and pinned him to a wall, causing the books in Malfoy's grasp to fall on the ground. Harry panted, sweat-licked from exertion and held Malfoy's shoulders steadily, squeezing it.
difficult for Harry to catch like a fly and talk to. Malfoy was absurdly five times more avoidant, and ten times more aggressive when it came to getting rid of Harry as soon as he showed signs of wanting to talk to the Slytherin - and it was always the Caterwauling Charm Malfoy did that shut Harry's mouth. Harry
Harry's brain dinged in an instant. He just stroked Draco's large ego and now he was smiling like the git that he is. The blond's nose was up in the air again, a smile escaping his bleeding lips from their earlier row.
Ron, still curious and confused, slowly panned his eyes where Harry could possibly be giving his eyes. He wasn't certain, but Harry's gaze was sharp and murderous despite the cover of his rimmed glasses. The stare directly landed far beyond the two long tables of Ravenclaw and Hufflepuff that separated them from the -
Harry heard that, and, yes, he was aware of it. He would be honest about being irked about Draco Malfoy, the person who made his life harder in school, kissed, lips-bloody-moving, kissed him instead of dropping the difficulty of the task of snogging him who happens to be a man with a willy for peeing exactly like what Malfoy had, and just apologize the way Harry had asked him to. Unfortunately, due to the knowledge Harry learned from staying at Hogwarts for as long as he could remember, he arrived at the conclusion Malfoy doesn't have an ego lower than the seven hundred-feet tall Hogwarts castle. Of course, he'd choose to kiss over apologizing, even if it has to resolve to kissing Harry Potter.
meant. Now, if you all could gather around in circle and play Truth or Dare with me, I’d appreciate it!" she yelled and everyone simpered excitedly, some murmuring their disapproval of the game, and some attempting to sneak off (the Hufflepuffs, Harry guessed) but the door was shut. Harry wondered if he's capable of opening it, just in case.
Draco tried to maneuver his way out, craning his neck to seek a path to escape but Harry had already pressed his own back on the door, pounded on it, creating a startling sound. Draco jolted, stepping back.
to fail, Harry knew. Malfoy had always been favored in his classes, and Snape would have all the more reasons to take points off Gryffindor if Malfoy would suddenly get an idea of sabotaging their antidote where Harry would most likely take all the blame without getting to hear his side, judging the unfairness the potions master reserved for him.
book in the library with Ron and Hermione, solemnly having their head down as if praying in their own books. Harry hoped he could do the same, but the twists and turns of his stomach prevented him from doing so. He was hungry, that is, but then again, he skipped his lunch thirty minutes ago and went with his friends to use their remaining lunch time in the library for their fourth period's test. Annoyingly, his stomach made a loud noise, resulting in numerous heads turning his way, getting soft chuckles by it.
After their talks about their personal lives and Bill's line of work, Bill gave Harry a small toothy grin and pinched his cheek fondly, ruffling Harry's mess of a hair and said his farewell. Harry used to be not used to Bill doing it, but due to familiarity, he didn't complain about Bill's gesture and smiled back, hugging the Weasley down the Grand Staircase where Bill left him after sauntering a bit. He was left alone, again, and now he could go back to dreading being alone –
we really know because he never told us about his incident, and we're not exactly pryful to read his diary."
Harry gaped, not hiding the horror that crept on his face and internally combusted. Instinctively, he stood and ran towards the door. Everyone was encouraging him to come back to the circle, but he knew other things than to listen to them. He didn’t want to, even if God himself asks him to do it. There is no way he'd let his lips lay on Malfoy's again.
Harry lessened the grip on the knob and turned around to face her. It wasn’t her fault at all, but he’d rather leave than kiss Malfoy.
"I'll keep this short and straightforward," Harry said, lowering his wand and cracking his neck before proceeding. "If it would have to be this way then, then so be it. You're up to something, just because I know you are, and I know that you know it."
"You could leave, you know. You don't want to be here, just go. I can manage myself," said Harry, attempting to look like he can when he knows he can't. Expectedly, Harry's spoon fell back to his plate when he raised it.
Harry was getting more and more pissed as seconds passed. He looked at Madam Pince for a second, hoping she was somewhere else farther from his space (because his voice was rising! No Hermione or Ron to control him!) before he answered, "Unlike you, I need to work extra hard on Potions. You don't even need to read because your inflated head's already a know-it-all."
Harry, who was almost two steps up the staircase was yanked backwards when Malfoy grabbed on his wrist, his feet landing back to the ground. Harry was shocked but Malfoy wasn't retuning the expression because he wore a nervous face in contrary to Harry's petrified one. Harry was befuddled why Malfoy looked like he's about to panic like Harry was about to flee.
rumor spreading across Hogwarts like plague. And days later, he still found himself in the same situation with Malfoy, who was suffering as much as he did. They haven't exchanged any Hexes or insults since.
“Why didn’t you complain to Abbot?” Harry asked, aware of the close proximity of Malfoy almost pressing on his body. “We don’t
"Not a word of this madness to your Gryffindor friends or I will blackmail you about getting hard on a man, and crying like an infant to the
Lonely and confused? He was smiling when he was with Harry, almost enjoying himself. "What should I do?"
on Harry's crotch. Harry gritted his teeth, in the hopes of making the situation vanish along with his pathetic cock that pulsed -
If it wasn't for the rather friendly competition they had, Harry wouldn't discover that Malfoy's eyes had a way of excessively tearing up when he's too happy, or how fast Malfoy was with morping his facial expressions that suited his current feeling. Even how Malfoy's forehead crinkled when he's disgusted. How his cheeks pink down to his neck when embarrassed and how Malfoy run his fingers up through his hair back to place when he's nervous. Especially how he looked at Harry so unnaturally piercing when he's excited and challenged. It all brought chill to Harry's spine, knowing they were going somewhere beyond the line of their established rivalry.
concerned of your grades, as always… but it’s not just your grades I’m concerned about. I am your best friend too. You can always tell me and Ron what’s bothering you. If this is about…  your nightmares and Malfoy, me and Ron are always open to hear it."
"Malfoy." Harry's head flopped on Malfoy's shoulder when Malfoy backed his face off after a few moments and continuous transferring and chewing, a pop sound escaping as their lips separated, sweat dribbling down their forehead. To his own surprise, Malfoy clutched on Harry's waist after.
The two of them shared fair laughs during the Hols and worked together decorating the castle with Hagrid and Professor Flitwick during mornings, Flitwick who was, by the way, surprised but pleased with Malfoy's willingness to be with Harry (Being amongst the few teachers who had the chance of issuing dozens of detention slips for Harry and Draco, it was natural for him to be shocked). Although it resulted in Harry in laughing fit and embarrassed, rose-tinted Draco during that particular morning the professor mentioned it (that he really shouldn't have since Malfoy didn't talk to Harry until dusk for that). In afternoons they played chess - both of them terrible at it so no one had won properly, then, they helped Hagrid feed his creatures and sometimes they skimmed some interesting stuffs at the library. At nights, they flew their brooms like the usual, then talked about their favorite professional Quidditch teams and school-related opinions but never about something personal or sensitive. Harry got the feeling they were both avoiding topics related to their rivalry and unwavering hatred towards each other's families and friends so Harry didn't pursue to discuss it. He didn't want to ruin his progress at least. He had gotten this far with Draco.
The blond smiled and grabbed Harry's wrist that was firmly squeezing on the front of his robe. Harry thought he was stronger, but unfortunately, this time, Malfoy had more strength since he was obviously well-fed and Harry was deprived of it. He pushed Harry to the wall and pinned him there. Harry didn't know how both of his hands ended up past his head with Malfoy holding them in place.
Malfoy stared at him, then crossed his arms, the cool and cold look in his eyes was there as well, calm and nonchalant. Harry didn’t look away from it, though somewhere at the back of his head, he thought he might have been worried about Malfoy, but he couldn’t tell Malfoy that.
He was now unfortunately experiencing a heavy breakdown, and he was too scared to admit the weakness pouring out his system at the moment because Malfoy was right. He shouldn't be disappointing his friends.
to after Buckbeak's trial. But Hagrid had always been fond of untamable creatures so no surprise he would be fond of you too." Harry grinned and received another laugh from Malfoy, a lot more carefree. He could hear Hagrid saying,
Harry was the one yelling now and laughing. "I won against my own Firebolt. I guess I'm just way talented, Malfoy. I have the last laugh!"
Harry's eyebrows furrowed, though did what was told, resulting in confusion as to why he was in such a situation. How did Malfoy know their last lesson in Potion? He wasn't in class.
You may start with your antidote to Garish Pink Blended Poison," then was forced to suppress the smirk that tempted to reveal from the professor's crumpled face.
Harry laughed nervously to patch things up, but Malfoy wasn't. He was still lost in the stars, humming a tune from a Celestina Warbeck hit album. "Sorry, Malfoy, forget what I said. What's important is... we reached this far. You've grown by the way, I've noticed as much," Harry filled the silence.
He hitched his breath as Malfoy's gaze slid down to Harry's lips, and Harry unconsciously licked his lower mount that only intensified Malfoy's stare at it, with Malfoy dangerously leaning closer to him. Harry almost shuddered, but controlled it somehow by swiveling his head away to a different direction without Malfoy in his line of sight, pulling himself away from the blond.
To their dismay after a few minutes of chanting spells and practicing hand movements outside the still-closed Transfiguration classroom, Professor Flitwick scurried towards them and announced Professor McGonagall had an urgent meeting to attend to with the Minister out of the country that cancelled their test that would be moved two days later. Everyone was shouting in triumph while Hermione sulked, complaining how her mind was already ready for battle of the brains.
Harry restrained himself from crossing his arms to hide his obscenity and moved forward, the chill of the air causing his skin to protrude mounds uncomfortably. Harry wasn't breathing, imagining how disgusted must Malfoy be now as well for seeing him displayed like this. Two things were sure though; this was
Harry turned away, feeling irritated. There was an urge to say a proper comeback of an insult, but at the same time, urge to ask Malfoy things about his sudden disappearance from the Marauder's map whenever Harry would stare at it before drifting off to sleep like,
," she greeted, eyes crinkling from the smile hidden behind her thick emerald green scarf wrapped around her neck.
The Gryffindor's cheeks reddened. He couldn't connect the dots of what Malfoy rambled about. "Goddamn it, talk English, Malfoy. I want to understand," Harry asked. "I hate that we hate each other like this."
Malfoy chuckled, a very fake one Harry heard on multiple occasions. "God, you suck," said Draco in between laughter. "Is that why you decided to blow up the classroom when you dropped bat spleens in your mixture before it cooled down last week?"
"I’m leaving!" Draco pivoted around towards the door and Harry didn’t stop him. He hunkered down and propped himself down the floor, pressing his back on one of the shelves. He closed his eyes, deciding he should rest before leaving but he jolted back to wake when a sound of a foot kicking a door startled him.
His body tingled for a moment, feeling his surroundings warp to where the room should bring him. He stilled and opened his eyes when everything seemed calmer around, revealing a heavily-detailed bronze door in front of him. He turned the knob with his heart on his throat, stepping inside carefully.
Malfoy did not hesitate to stand beside Harry and unfurled the paper on the table. It might be an illusion for Harry's part that he thought the blond was being gentle with him.
"Wait," Harry called, they glared at each other for an interminable moment, and Harry forgot what he was supposed to say. "No, nevermind."
Malfoy had his own support hadn't he? Parkinson? Zabini? His mum? He didn't really know about that since he barely knew Malfoy aside from what he looked like and what he portrayed in public. They weren't even close to being acquaintances, so he never knew anything clear aside from Draco's whole name and house he's in.
In this tension-filled room, the game continued after Ron had spun his bottle, red patches disappearing off his face.
"So what if he's a Death Eater? What does it have to do with me? Don't ask me about him. If there's one thing I want the best right now, it is for you to stick your nose up somewhere useful. Your parents be damned for having a son like you, out of control and freakish."
Harry, despite himself, cackled atrociously, louder than the previous one. Malfoy's face was priceless and was worth the laugh. "Oh
, and it was all to be blamed to his carelessness. If the cloak did not reveal his feet at that time he was, now he'd admit, stalked Malfoy, then his faith would've been kinder to him as of the moment, sparing him a space of peace in his mind.
"Kill me," Malfoy mewled, Harry could only stare at him and had an urge to actually murder Malfoy because he asked, and at the same time feeling Malfoy's pain of getting an activity,
Harry blinked slowly, processing what Malfoy prattled about. "Y-you don't mean Bill? Nevermind, Malfoy for
Harry groaned. "Did that happen to you and him ever so often? The type of interaction that somehow bothers him?"
Harry's heart clenched but prodded the wand further on Malfoy's skin, watching it sink on the soft and pale flesh since that's how he'd bring his frustration satisfaction.
You and your stupid Savior Complex should vanish off the Wizarding World, and maybe life would be better and brighter. And I won't have to deal with all this shit in my life."
Parkinson's grin widened at the sudden enthusiasm, showing her perfect set of teeth. “Right! That’s more like it, Potter! We need more egoistic bastards like you around here. I know you’re looking for Weasley and Granger. They’d be here in a moment.”
"It's not always the money, the position and the amount of people who recognize you that counts." Harry looked at Malfoy and saw the blond with narrowed eyes. "I mean, some things are more valuable than materials and attention, Malfoy."
Draco's eyes widened and looked at a spot on the ground. A blush had crept on his pale cheeks and Harry, freezing himself, realized why. His sentence sounded -
Harry blinked slowly, remembering the time he stroked Draco's ego that seemed to have an effect on him that time Draco was sprawled on top of him. Could he really do what Pansy suggested? Reach that extent of humiliating himself in front of Draco? Harry could turn away if he wanted to, forget it and let Malfoy be but Harry was stubborn and persistent. He had been living for sixteen fearful years and faced almost-death experiences enough to know that about himself.
"We have classes in a moment, Potter. Or are you too stupid to the point you don't care about your failing grades? And
There was nothing Harry could do about Malfoy anymore, he thought. The blond was hard to convince to talk to him, or rather, it was hard for Malfoy to gain courage and risk himself to do something
. He wouldn't know he was shaking this much if Malfoy didn't hold him like this. "Was that necessary? Doing that? F-feeding me off your mouth?"
“Did… you get all that?” Malfoy asked after his lecture, using the underside of his palm to rest his chin. Harry nodded, skimming his scribbles of notes one by one with a satisfied smile. He really understood the lesson by heart and he couldn’t believe Malfoy was the one who made it possible.
Draco's hand loosened its grip on his chest and slowly backed away, probably just now it caught him how close he was to Potter's personal space and stepped further back. He then nodded, urging Potter to go on and have his momentum.
Draco rolled his eyes, continuing his walk and found that Harry was being dragged to the nearest room Draco found. The blond didn't let go of his grip on Harry's front, he squeezed it tighter, throwing him beyond the latched door and closed it immediately when the two of them were both inside, locking it completely with a spell.
Harry, confused and mad and irritated with the unfair world, decided to avert back his attention to the discussion or else he'd get a big red
After eating in a surprisingly bearable silence, Harry drank his water and watched Malfoy give his empty plates to the elf who was waiting for Harry to finish at the corner. Harry didn't want to say, but Malfoy looked professional doing all the tending. He didn't show his hatred towards Harry during all the work, and that alone was impressive.
if. If I attempt to talk to Malfoy, you know - be - be casual, would he be mad?" Harry asked, wringing his hands. Pansy and Blaise stared at him with intent.
"Well?" Harry waited for his apology, and if Harry could be holding a recorder, then that would be glorious. He would record what the Slytherin would say to him, but that wasn't really important. The important one is that he'd hear it himself, the apology he's anticipating to hear.
"I’m here to study," Malfoy broke the silence. "I believe you have the Potions book I wanted to read the most."
The orange one was the main ingredient for the poison we're supposed to create an antidote to!" Malfoy whispered angrily, his wand doing a sunwise motion at their cauldron. Harry only made a questioning face because the remark didn't make sense to him. Malfoy seemed to have figured out why Harry was making such an expression since his mouth flapped in disbelief. "If you fucking observe, Potter, it's
Harry sighed and like Malfoy was, he was quiet when the game started. Pansy spun the bottle and it landed on Draco first, upon the second spin, it pointed on Ron. Harry kept frozen on his seat and watched Draco's thin lips curve up to a smile.
Harry crossed his arms and raised his eyebrows, trying to even out his breath or else he would combust. "Yes, do take your time."
"I don't want to hear you thanking me. Just don't neglect your health like this. Weasley and Granger would be worried of you.
Draco Malfoy had his back propped to a wall, a painting of a maiden behind him complaining of his hair covering her frame. Draco's hair was masking his forehead that softened his intimidating, prominent features, still as pale as ever, both hair and skin. He was all casual and warm in his black cloak, styled with a shiny belt that emphasized the slimness of his waist. Harry couldn't help but blink ten times to assure himself he wasn't being delusional.
"Thirty points! BOTH OF YOU!" Harry heard a booming voice and he knew who it was. He closed his eyes and sighed in defeat. It was the end of the world, and Professor McGonagall saw a live-action scene of him and Malfoy fighting like twelve-year olds.
Malfoy was silent again—which meant either he was going to attempt to lie or his answer would be something depressing.
"Yes. Well, it's not that surprising that it would be my mother's." He looked haunted at the thought—Harry wanted to reach out and hug him.
Draco walked into the Ministry and rode the dingy lift to the DMLE, the edges of his vision blurred. The familiar tightness in his chest that had made its home there a year ago now twisted further as he stepped out onto the floor. The feeling was background noise now—whereas it had been
"Hey guys." He forced casual into his tone. "I was wondering, before you go report it, could I take a look at those samples you got, I wonder if maybe I'll recognize the magic." He rolled his jaw in an effort to keep it from clenching, schooling himself into relaxation he didn't feel.
"Ronald, do you think they're onto us?" Draco whisper yelled while he and Ron were flying around the Quidditch pitch, practicing for an upcoming game.
Living together really eased running the business, and being married, as far as the public was concerned, helped affirm their credibility.
But Potter didn't look shocked or surprised at all. Instead, he smiled the coldest, most dangerous smile Draco has ever seen on him, and pointed his wand straight at Justin:
"What? Why are you looking at me like that?" Harry decided to give an out of this topic by poking some fun, which he found always worked well to diffuse tense situations such as this one.
"They can all fuck off if they think glaring at you is going to make me step away." Harry snarled, his voice grated with irritation.
He attempted to draw in a breath but the pain spasming through him made it difficult to get anything more than a wheeze. There was someone kneeling by his side and there were hands on him, but he couldn't catch up quick enough.
Even when they finished school, and started working for the Ministry, even as years upon years passed—It was
The magic of the castle itself didn't feel too different, it was still as warm and welcoming as ever, but Harry could taste it. The bitter undertone, something forever tainted by the war that took place. In some ways, Harry supposed it was a good thing, that it wasn't forgotten, that things didn't just go back to being peachy. He was glad he could still taste it.
Suddenly, the halls rumbled and warped, the air shimmered and pulled as a form slid into existence in the middle of a distant alcove where Harry Potter had just screamed himself hoarse.
It was a few months later that Ron and Hermione moved out, just before she gave birth to baby Rosie. Draco had managed to settle in by then and had even found a program that helped ex-convicts find work that had hooked him up with work for an Apothecary, to brew Potions and stock their supplies.
They were going to leave Grimmauld to Draco. Which was sweet of them to do. If they had not let him stay there, he was pretty sure he'd end up homeless.
Harry wondered how it'd feel once it was finally broken and he would stop feeling constantly edge aroused, if the pains in his abdominal muscles would cease once he was no longer constantly hard. He imagined it would be a relief, when it was all finally done.
Harry turned his head to the side and watched the outline of Draco's back in his own bed in the darkness. He was laying perfectly still, as if frozen.
He blinked a few times, released a breath he wasn't aware he'd been holding. Ron and Hermione were in front of him in the hall, mirror grins on their faces.
"Any other way?" Harry felt sheepish asking. It didn't appear as though it were possible, which then in turn forced Harry to look upon the now likely seeming possibility of staying here forever, trapped.
If it was possible for a person to look shattered at the same time as incredibly enraged, Draco looked it to the 'T'.
Harry wrapped a hand around Draco's cock, and Draco's vision whited out for a moment, hips juddering of their accord.
When they boarded the train, Draco was enveloped in a crushing hug and it had taken him a moment to recognize Pansy.
Malfoy's eyelids fluttered, he seemed able to focus now, seemed to really see Harry in front of him, and Harry breathed a subtle sigh of relief. The immediacy of the situation had been rectified, but Harry still couldn't leave. He had Malfoy's wings and feathers to take care of, they'd gotten mangled and bloody and plenty have fallen out. It was important to fold his wings against his back so they'd have the solid form of Malfoy's body to rest their weight on and therefore hurt him less.
Yes, it was true that Harry couldn't quite tell how he'd become a nanny for a Veela, but he'd come to realize that he most definitely could and would and simply just plain
Harry nodded, his own amusement showing through, though a small part somewhere in him bloomed at the fact Draco bothered to correct himself:
Potter to touch him and hold him again, beyond an emergency situation where there is no other solution. Draco wanted Potter to want it, and that was
Suddenly though, Potter crashed headfirst into someone else and they both went toppling to the floor.
Seeing Harry spread out before him like this, his thighs parted to allow Draco to slot in between them, honey hued skin glistening with a thin layer of perspiration, it did things to Draco that he had never felt with any other before.
And he'd just hang out around the door for sometimes up to an hour, just...standing there, presumably doing nothing. Draco never opened the door to confront him, mainly because he didn't exactly trust himself not to jump him then and there.
"I'll stay if that happens. Surely you can find some extra paperwork to pile on me if you need an excuse."
And that was why Pansy and Hermione were so determinedly doing this—to give them both a reason. If that happened to be each other, then so be it, they'd play matchmaker for a bit.
Harry felt so kicked that there were tears pricking at his eyes at the vulnerable, young desperation in Draco's plea. He couldn't take it. He pushed both his arms and wrapped them around Draco, rubbing his back with one and trailing the other to pet his hair, the way he'd always do without realizing in a half delirious state of between sleep and wakefulness in the mornings. Harry held him tighter.
Ron swerved as close to the wards as he dared, trying to peer into the Manor. He strategized outloud:
"We'll have to spend some time with the couple to determine the root of the issue—so we might come up with the best possible solution." Potter talked, all business and professional, his face carefully neutral and his eyes glued to Narcissa and Lucius—far away from Draco, who was doing nothing
"Are you going to admit defeat and just go bloody ask him to dance, because you've gone green with jealousy by this point." She reiterated.
Malfoy blinked dumbly at him for a moment, then did as he was told. When he was done, he looked considerably more composed than earlier.
He watched as Hermione made her way over to the three, knocking into Draco as she rounded up next to the two guys.
"Hey! I have my moments." Harry snickered, then cleared his throat. "Well this all works out very well really." He was smiling brightly.
"Perhaps? But why? We wouldn't take the piss out of them for anything.." Harry mused, heart clenching tightly at the thought that Draco didn't trust him and felt the need to hide something.
Harry copied her position and could bet he'd heard Draco suck in a shallow breath, though he couldn't be sure.
Draco pulled his mother in for a hug. He was so grateful to have her by his side with a father like Lucius:
and Ron had scrambled up out of bed and Flooed into Draco's apartment—where he found him standing on his balcony more than a little
That was until—faint noise caught his ears. He stopped, and listened. A broken sob, then a bitten off curse—though it sounded foggy and indistinct Draco would recognize the voice anywhere.
"What was that?" He asked slowly, one hand gripping a wall when he'd startled from the sudden quaking.
Harry dropped his head between his shoulder blades and sighed deeply. There was the conversation he didn't really want to have. Well, there seemed no getting out of it now:
"Harry Potter!" Salazar bellowed as he floated through the many halls, scaring children alike with his visage. He supposed it was not everyday you meet a Hogwarts founder. Most stared dumbly at him, then scuttled away, none brave enough to offer him insight into
"Really? Tell me about them, the stories." Draco managed a smile and a sly wink. "Potter never has to know you told on him. It'll be our little secret." Were Draco a stronger man, he wouldn't have prodded. Draco was not a stronger man however, he was a miserable sod who wanted to know what his crush thought about him. So Draco prodded.
Harry nodded and considered how to get Draco into the wing again. Perhaps if Draco called to it, as a Pureblood, it might respond to him.
especially seeing as Ron and his other colleagues were getting new cases left and right. Draco was the one who had always been in charge of accepting cases because of the paperwork involved that Harry didn't want to handle, so either they were really being offered no new cases, or Draco was rejecting the offered ones.
Draco paused, worrying his lip for a second. Was he okay in there? Did Draco have any right to intrude?
"I—like them." Draco continued, softer this time, seemingly fiercely determined to make Harry feel better somehow. "That fight—it made me feel something, back when—" He shook his head. "Bottom line is, it's fine, stop looking like a guilty kicked puppy and help me with these fucking cramps."
"I don't know—I'm sure it's fine, it was the full moon yesterday, Harry must still be shaken. And Draco, well...I mean it's Draco, does anything surprise you at this point? Why do you think this has anything to do with me in the first place?" The ginger deflected, as they made their way into down the hall and into the living room.
"I know." Harry nodded solemnly—because he did. He'd spent the last three years of his education falling in love and pining for the same guy who never wanted to be in the same room with him, let alone something else.
"I—but—" Draco helpessly stared at Potter, who only smiled and shrugged, the bastard. "But—you can't just—
It was still hilarious though, the fact Draco's been stuck in a tree for half an hour trying to think of a good way to get down that wouldn't disturb the cat.
Ron leaped out of his chair and startled Hermione, who took a glance at the line to realize what had happened. She nodded and they stepped into their Floo together, tumbling into Draco's living room, prepared for the worst.
The study-date was deemed a success, even though they refused to talk to each other no matter how much Pansy and Hermione pushed—Draco's arm had stayed around Potter, and Potter had stayed resting against it until the very end after all, so it was something to celebrate, small victory though it was.
As much as it felt as though corrosive acid ate away his heart at the thought of never seeing Draco again, Harry wasn't stupid or naive. He knew Draco was probably very right that it would likely be impossible for him to make it in England.
"They won't allow him to return to school unless someone is—chaperoning—him, as it were, and if he's not back in Hogwarts, then he'll be back in—"
She was also surprised to report just how many questions about Harry Malfoy asked her on a daily basis—had to be at least a dozen per day. He never ran out of things he wanted to know.
That ability was quickly impeded as his right arm seized up and sent another trickle of sharp, brutal pain that had him screaming.
"Malfoy!" He hissed under his breath. His voice softened then: "You're hyperventilating. I need you to calm down, c'mon, take a deep breath in through your nose, hold it for three seconds then exhale through your mouth. You can do it."
"I'll be right back Zach, just see what he wants." Harry squeezed past his partner and grabbed Malfoy's shoulder, started pulling him down the hall towards his office, but Malfoy bristled away from it, which was...odd, but Harry didn't dwell on it and instead rounded off into the bathroom and tossed a quick locking charm once they were inside.
In an hour or two, their essay was pretty much done, when Draco remembered something important to the assignment.
He had no clue what the Black signet looked like, but if that ball was somehow it or connected to it, then they were both fucked.
"Well, when your spawn graces this world, I reckon it won't be any longer." Draco teased, inclined his head towards Hermione's belly.
"Potter, you cretin if you mess up this one you could quite literally render us both entirely infertile. It is not that hard to pronounce!" Draco was at wit's end attempting to teach Harry to say it properly, but no matter how hard Harry tried, his tongue bent wrongly each time he tried to speak them.
Harry's eyes lit up with wonder as the rash faded beneath his fingers, dissolved as if it had never been there.
"And thank you for pulling me out of a fucking fire, I wouldn't of made it out otherwise." Malfoy finished, and mimicked Harry's nod.
His head was still swimming from his fall, his vision swirling and doubling from the constant shaking and stammering, but his plan of laying low was a success as he was able to weasel through the oppressive magic much easier than he ever would have standing up.
And he wondered if Harry might feel so lonely and sad sometimes too. Draco didn't want him to, so he reminded him every night:
"Thank you Kreacher!" Harry yelled as loud as he could in his complete and sheer panic. He couldn't ever let his bloody elf say those words to him or he might just have to set himself on fire.
But knowing what he did now, the next full moon should be a breeze. Harry always thought Draco didn't like him, because Draco always stayed far away from him whenever they all gathered to go out.
Without sparing a glance to his father, Draco cracked the wards around their table and made for the Floo.
Hermione smirked victoriously, flicked her wand upwards and muttered an incantation under her breath:
Over the second and third years Draco sobered up and felt the bleakness of prison set into his very bones, but he felt jaded against it all. It was in the fourth year that the misery had finally hit him. Even he didn't feel sorry for himself, even though he was the one underfed in a dingy cell. He felt pitiful about the fact that the one thing Harry had done everything he could to prevent had happened.
Harry's consciousness was going hazy, melting into a blurry puddle, as his body spasmed slowly. A deep pain burrowed through him insidiously. Draco's voice was the only thing that penetrated through the liquid in his head. He used to study to be a Healer. How sadly ironic that was.
Harry nodded, trying to phase himself out, his whole body strained and aching. When this was all over, if he never got horny again it would be too soon, he bitterly fumed.
At that point he'd grabbed me by the shoulders and was shaking me rather violently. I was still rather dumbstruck at that point, but I needn't have worried—because Malfoy was, by no means, done."
Ron walked into their office and found Draco there early as usual, reading over any given case of the day. He glanced at his desk—sure enough, there was a cup of tea there.
Meanwhile, Snowflake had clambered up onto Draco's shoulder and was nudging him with his tiny snout.
He felt arms wrap around him from the back when Harry scooted closer and leaned his torso into Draco, his head nestled into the crook of Draco's neck:
A few moments later, Draco was entering the dorm, looking about ten times more relieved than he did when he went out.
Regardless, what mattered was that Draco felt the same and that Harry would—would ask him out. Yes, that's what Harry would do.
, there's got to be another way--" Malfoy tried one last feeble time. "I don't want you to die..." He admitted, voice tapering off into a whisper.
All the blonde really learned from this is that being around Potter made him emotional and way more invested in things he ordinarily would care little about, such as goddamn homework.
"I'm fine." Draco wanted to leave it at that, didn't feel like explaining Harry was simultaneously the cause and the cure of the damn thing.
"Exactly. McGonagall is going to come up here, demanding answers for that duel, you better pray we can manage to calm her wrath and get off with detention." Harry mumbled, casting the unlocking charm at the dorm door to make it less suspicious when the Headmistress came knocking, and she would.
“Harry,” she called, tapping his shoulders. “I spelled that to not open until the task is done. I'm sorry. I didn’t know Abbot would dare Malfoy that.”
"It's near the staffroom, idiot. Do you want them to confirm their suspicions about the Malfoy-Potter relationship? As we all know, that fucked up rumor reached the Headmaster because the whole staff said so."
And for an unknown reason, Harry blushed. The conversation was getting to nowhere and nowhere. Everything was turning childish. "And that's my fault now? That you didn't get your arse kissed?"
have to say about my life. I just need some proper answers. What is your relationship with Voldemort?" Harry's eyes were intense, not leaving Malfoy's agitated ones.
The two of them stared tense at each other for a moment before Draco broke away first. "Yes, I just said I
He tentatively stretched his hand and held on Malfoy's shin, hoping he won't punch Harry for it. The blond only jolted upon contact but didn't say anything, letting Harry at it.
Harry was caught off guard and before he had the chance to blink and gather himself, Malfoy's fist had already landed on his cheek, crunching. Harry, now combusting in anger, threw Malfoy his blow, wind whishing and knuckles dully aching after. Blood dribbled down Draco's chin and without attempting to wipe it, he limped forward and kicked Harry's stomach with his knee. They continued punching, kicking and pushing each other until Harry felt his knees suddenly freezes, causing him to tip back onto the ground. Malfoy flopped beside him next, in the same state as Harry: lips dampened with blood and jaw either colored a hue of red transitioning to violet.
and it's effectiveness of making a magic folk float in the coldness of the dim Potions classroom, and his paper was still visibly blank.
Draco looked down, and Harry wished he knew what that small reaction meant. "You ask me what I think of you?" He paused and looked back at Harry, "I honestly don't know, Potter. I don't – I don't know."
It was a decent breakfast, Harry supposed. Not until Neville started talking about Malus Domestica and other varieties of apples with a Hufflepuff who joined them at their table. Ambrosia and Granny Smith seemed to be their favorite to talk about and Harry could feel his eyes grudgingly seeking on the other side of the Great Hall because of what the topic reminded him.
Pansy chuckled, cutting whatever Harry had in mind to say. Harry looked rather offended and angry at Blaise's last comment, though it was true. "I heard Draco say Potter is a martyr and pushy prick. I'm seeing it now. I'll say he would get furious of Potter approaching him but... who knows? Draco is very unpredictable. He might kick you, yell at you or snog you senselessly. He's like that," Pansy said.
He was fainting, Harry concluded but a hand scooped him off the floor and carried his body before he realized it. Harry wasn't unconscious yet so he knew whose scent was it that his nose caught.
He couldn't help but think why Malfoy was stabbed but this was certainly not for fun. Malfoy might be a walking spawn of devil, but Harry knew that this was a bit too much for anyone to experience. Now that he thought of it, he was Draco Malfoy, with a Death Eater father. There was so many possibilities that Harry could think of.
They’ve started cleaning diligently. Neither of them spoke to each other unless their exchange of dialogues was  cleaning-related. Malfoy spelled the cloths to clean the trophies one by one with an articulate swing of his wrist while Harry did all the organization, placing the trophies in the shelves one by one with hands since he was more used to physical labor.
"That is the password to my office's trophy room. That also means detention at six in the evening. You will clean the
"What?" Harry asked in a haze and his eyes widened when he found Malfoy was no longer hunkering down at one of the bottommost part of the shelf. He was now beside him, inspecting Harry like a specimen and sniffed his neck in one swift motion. An overwhelming scent of apple wafted through his nose and Harry shuddered from the cold touch of air caused by Malfoy's breathing right on his collarbone. He pushed him in reflex but then he remembered Malfoy had an unfaltering strength.
"But, do try, Potter. A martyr like you? I think you could get somewhere progressive if you keep it up with him, even if it had to be
I know. This is horrible but – if the dare was not done with the people involved, you guys would be stuck in here unless the dare was done."
Harry blushed as he doffed his robe off in an instant, folding it to his lap in the hopes no one would remember the embarrassing event.
Harry drew in a deep breath, shook his head and ate the rest of his porridge silently with a disconcerted chest.
"I should've ditched you, Potter," the blond said, looking at Harry again who was fuming more at Malfoy's words. "I was supposed to have a make-out session with a Ravenclaw after classes, and I told her we should cancel due to
He carefully studied Malfoy's next movements with a racing heart, and when Malfoy didn't move due to obvious confusion, he continued to fill the silence, "I'll be staying in Hogwarts for the Christmas break just as always
Harry smiled at the little dance Ron made in front of their Common Room's fireplace, all dressed up to go to Hogwarts Express, his luggage ready and Pigwidgeon, his small owl, was leaping along with Ron in his cage, probably excited to play with Errol. Harry could share Ron's joy because finally, their first term was finished, including their examinations and other practical ones that induced stress for days. Hermione was practically jumping on her seat as well, probably overjoyed about the fact she would be spending her two-week break in the Burrow with the Weasleys. It was a lot more of a big deal for her since it was a personal invite from Mrs. Weasley.
Draco hummed tiredly and didn't answer anymore, propping his head on the floor and kept his eyes shut. After a few minutes of waiting, Harry saw the Hufflepuff boy's head poking at the door. Madam Pomfrey showed up next, and she was the one who carried Malfoy down to the Hospital Wing and laid him down on one of the beds.
Without another word, Draco fled out of the library with all of his things and Harry's adrenaline instantaneously reacted from it, calling Malfoy's name and continued trotting behind the blond. (Thanks to his leg muscles he developed over the course of continuous Quidditch practice, he was able to catch the pace of Malfoy's longer strides.)
Draco was exasperated again. The same expression he made when he found out he ranked second to Harry in Defense class. "
Ten turns later, he halted on a dark corridor, letting himself breathe for a moment. Upon his recovery, he walked away through the corridor to come back to the Gryffindor tower. Turning left, his chest collided with another person, causing him to stagger backwards.
to his enemy who was posh and fully-clothed. Malfoy's fingers finally stopped caressing on Harry's lips and snaked up to fondle Harry's jaw. "You lost it, didn't you?"
Draco fidgeted, and sank lower in Harry’s arms. He probably didn’t know what to respond about the new fact he heard of Harry. "I always thought you lived in buoyancy and luxury. I meant you held ‘The Golden Boy’ title since you were born. The Daily Prophet always made you look so… heroic and special. I knew you had a horrible Muggle family but not to that extent. I don't say you deserve that but – "
Harry's eyes narrowed. Given that Harry asked Malfoy's company for Christmas, he was thinking Malfoy would act more appropriately than this. "Let people talk then."
Harry, without giving it much of a thought, smiled as he reached his free hand out and offered it to Malfoy. Malfoy had withdrawn his gripping hand off Harry's other hand first before the blond gawked at Harry's other offering hand, as if looking at a strange foreign object for the first time up close, his face first making a confused expression, then warped to surprise, and then panic. Harry shook his own hand a little, as if saying Malfoy should get on with it, and Malfoy, seemed settled and relieved by Harry's eagerness, took it and smiled back.
"Use a different tactic, Harry," Pansy said that morning, at the desperate time he was in his lowest of his mission and asked for Pansy's help during their Care of Magical Creatures class. "Draco isn't easy. He'd always been complicated and unpredictable like we said."
Without a moment too soon, Malfoy was kissing Harry like it was their last time, pulling Harry to himself hungrily with a growl, hands shamelessly running over the skin of Harry's back, waist and arse. Harry cupped Draco's face in return, holding it in place for him and bloody not caring where his glasses landed on to, kissing Draco back with the same eagerness. He could taste and feel everything on fire, telling him that this
A voice rattled him out of his thoughts. He realized the room was suddenly quiet, all eyes fixated on him, some gaping, some looking at him with horror-filled eyes. Wait, why are they looking like that?
Hagrid blushed behind his hair and went to the kitchen again to make some more tea and pound cake practically flying like a giant cupid in euphoria. Harry, a little bitter, grabbed one slice off the plate and nibbled off it to try it out himself. It was... scrumptious. It had the right sweetness, softness and saltiness mixed together that brought satisfaction to Harry's tastebuds that rarely rejoiced these days due to loss of appetite. "Hagrid, isn't it unfair that your pound cakes improved and Malfoy's the first to taste it and not me, Hermione and Ron?"
together. They freestyled their defenses against each other since that was what Professor Scott said in Professor Robin's absence:
"A night won’t be enough to clean this," Harry said, covering his nose as the smell of something-dead creature wafted through his nostril. It was true. He had cleaned the Dursleys' basement that wasn't touched for thirteen whole years for three days. He realized it was a dumb statement since he knew well they weren’t Muggles who needed something too physical to clean the room. They had magic.
He received another smack from Snape's rolled paper because of the noise associated with heavily-stirring and took another set of five points from Gryffindor. Deciding it was best to focus on his and Ron's half-brewed potion, he looked down and chopped some of the ingredients remaining for him to do, face falling to a frown throughout the session.
Harry stood there, confused and lost, at least hoping for Ron and Hermione to appear to make him feel better of himself. He said he was not a coward, yet in reality he wanted to back out and choose to sleep through his Saturday night. That sounded like the best option. Harry thought of planning his glorious escape just like the other Hufflepuffs, but there come Ron and Hermione through the door, panting from running all the way up to the seventh floor. When they noticed Harry’s presence, they smiled.
"You know you could leave now, right?" Harry said as if a boulder had landed on his whole being. There was no point in Malfoy staying, since he would never be available for a talk. And to top it all, Draco Malfoy is Draco Malfoy.
"You're still here with me, Potter?" Malfoy's voice was cracked, and Harry didn't insult him for it, surprising for Harry too because Harry thought he would since they both find it satisfying every time one of them ends up being injured.
Shaking his head, he watched Harry vanish from his line of sight and ate the rest of his breakfast silently.
wander around," Malfoy said, sitting Harry to his bed. It was obvious on his face that Malfoy didn't like being in such a red-infested room from the carpet up to the ceiling, his nose scrunched up a little, and Harry was embarrassed the blond really did bring Harry to his dorm. Harry relaxed himself on his bed as Draco assisted him, palm flat on Harry's back as he lowered the Gryffindor down to his bed. Harry's foot seemed to have step on Neville's toad (and why the fuck was it everloving there) on his blanket and slipped down along with Malfoy on top of him.
"We are aware why we are gathered in this circle," she said, hands on her lap. "As we all know, I was the one who suggested this gathering since I know each of us needed break and to let out the wild beast hiding inside us once in a while. That also meant I was the beautiful beast who suggested this game to the Professor too.”
Malfoy had gone in to the Room of Requirement. Malfoy had been doing this since the term started and Harry never bothered to find it suspicious at first when he himself had gone there out of boredom. Maybe this time, he could find it odd that Malfoy went there
"None of it is true!" defended Harry, although that wasn't the topic he was hoping to discuss with but there were some clarifications he needed to justify. He explained chronologically about his and Malfoy's detention issued by McGonagall and how he and Malfoy were stuck in a room together. He didn't know how he managed to tell all the information without stammering or blowing up, but he did. The two remained deadpanned as they listened, somehow making faces at the parts where Draco had curled himself to a ball and seemed to be terrified of the small space.
Malfoy moved off the wall and walked towards Harry, wearing a smirk. "Meaning not excluding the boys off your fuck list completely?"
"I spoke to Parkinson and Zabini last week," Harry started and tentatively seeked Draco's face. There was a glint of expectancy there of what Harry would say. So, Harry continued, "I didn't antagonize them. I asked them stuff about... you, obviously and they don't know much about you."
Harry, instead of asking more questions, he paid close attention. He scribbled down notes on his paper as Malfoy explained one by one of the different options and procedures of extracting moisture from dead creatures. He sat there, every sentence comprehensible by his brain – it was as if Malfoy purposely made it easier for Harry to understand – just like Hermione. Oh, he is,
. "What was that sharp thing? A broken goblet from Transfiguration?" Malfoy tried standing up again but whimpered in pain, falling back down on Harry's chest, rolling his hips again. He wasn't realizing it, but it was doing something to Harry. "
trembled in his grasp before it cascaded to the floor, creating a startling sound. To his inconvenience, his glasses flew either, joining the fallen books.
"No. I did all the advanced procedures of unlocking doors, I did out-of-class spells too, but this won’t simply budge."
Harry shivered involuntarily, eyes narrowing from the intensity of the atmosphere. It was somehow surprising for him seeing Malfoy being ominous like this. Harry's cheeks were tinted red and he didn't need to look at a mirror to know. What is Malfoy even saying?
Malfoy tensed and stepped back one foot away from the table, as if waiting for his cue to run, obviously wanting to dodge a topic Draco had an idea what.
that wasn't supposed to be pressed on (Malfoy doesn't seem to notice that). Both of Malfoy's arms were on his sides, locking him in an almost embrace. He would've laughed at Malfoy looking constipated in their position, but he knew if he did, Malfoy would retaliate.
He stared at his food, stunned still. He remembered waking up first from Malfoy, who had his arms and legs entangled with Harry on the cold wooden floor they've just cleaned the day before. Draco was curled on his side the moment he opened his eyes with a numb upper body, and a leg hooked over Harry's waist like he was a favorable pillow. Harry, outright disgusted and shocked, had shoved Malfoy all to the other side of the room for it without the unconscious blond having to wake up. Thankfully, they were rescued by a kitchen elf who heard him bang the door at six in the morning ("Oh, Filchey is surprised there are students here!"). They left together (Harry had to pinch Malfoy on the nose to wake him up), not in the mood to look at each other, unsuspected - but then some students on the way to the Hall saw them left McGonagall's office
Walking pass the tables in a blur, Harry sighed and decided to sit beside Neville, and like all the other students, the Gryffindors' noise died down catching Harry on their vision. The atmosphere suddenly turned awkward and that alone made Harry want to Disapparate.
"Fuck this." Malfoy tugged on his own hair and hunkered down the ground as if throwing a tantrum. Harry stared through the whole scenario. It lasted for a few minutes before Malfoy stood up with a more composed look but hands still visibly shaking. He seemed to be uncomfortable facing Harry so turned his back at him. "Luna Lovegood."
Harry sighed, sympathy tugging on his belly, remembering the first year Hufflepuff who helped him find Malfoy in the bathroom. At this point, it didn’t matter if they were enemies.
not you, Harry," said Ron who was carefully adding extra sugar to his croissant. Of course, Harry wasn't able to cover himself under the scrutiny of his best friends. They were always the one who found out everything first whenever something was bothering him.
Harry supposed it wasn't bad to explain to a pureblood he had a muggle thing on his skin. "Er it's a thing that helps with small cuts or wounds - for muggles - their body composition is the same as ours so it would work the same."
He and Malfoy were paired up in D.A.D.A. without Professor Robin Harper's supervision in the Dueling Club right after their Double Potions (who was said to have accidentally stunned himself badly, and now in the Hospital Wing, said by Professor Scott of Arithmancy from the next classroom - who couldn't stand a class defending against the dark arts for a second and fled after explaining).
He was depressed too, Harry would admit that, but he never once thought of resorting to self-harming or suicide because, somehow, he was getting support by Hermione, Ron and the rest of the Weasleys who treated him like their own family, trying their best to fill in the hole of never having a proper family, stuck in a cupboard as his small little haven for eleven years before he found that he was a famous wizard, known in the whole Wizarding World, always a hit topic at the Ministry and
"Five points from Gryffindor," said Snape familiarly before striding off to take his place back in front of the class.
Malfoy glared. "And you're dumb for doing it! You've been taking Pansy's stupid advices and you did that to yourself. Why are you blaming it on me? Why are you expecting me to flow along with your silly plan acting like a gay slut?"
Harry chewed his food, there was guilt in his stomach tugging him recklessly, deciding it was best to fixate his eyes on the fire of the fireplace. He dozed off in class most of the time, and this was not different from the previous scolds he received from Hermione.
The girl smirked and she nodded at Malfoy, like some form of telepathy and signal Harry didn’t want to know. Draco, who seemed not bothered of everything, offered his hand to Harry noncommittally. He couldn’t believe Malfoy was okay with this, kissing him,
Draco squinted and looked away, brows creased. "Why are you telling me those personal things then? Aren’t you bothered I might use it against you? You don’t know what I could do to ruin your life. I'm Draco Malfoy, I could expose you."
Shrugging, he closed his eyes, letting the side of his head rest atop Draco's own nook. He found their state ridiculous, but at that ridiculous moment, he wished that he and Malfoy wouldn't have to get on each other's throats all the time. Just… actually be friends like Hermione and Ron. He was given a chance to befriend Malfoy in the train, but he didn't – all because Malfoy had shown his awful attitude, and now they're life-sworn enemies.
The blond was about to breathe fire again for Harry's sudden motion when a sound of a door slammed on the wall, indicating Harry and Malfoy were no longer alone.
Harry gripped on his map as Draco approached nearer Harry's direction, his eyebrows crinkled as if it joined together. He looked rather stressed, unusually paler than usual, but couldn't be compared to Harry's ways of neglecting himself. He could almost be as thin as Malfoy at this rate.
The blond's shoulders relaxed, or at least his attempt to be. "I just saw, okay? The way you look at her. You always looked at her in a way your eyes sparkled as if she's everything. Potter, I hated her."
As expected, Ron's face blended the color of his hair. He waited for the crowd's noise to dissipate before he answered.
It wasn't concern exactly. Harry told Pansy that he was worried about Malfoy when she asked, and now Malfoy was asking him himself about it, it was embarassing to the core. Compared to how his and Pansy's conversation went, this with Malfoy was a lot more terrifying to admit. Harry looked Malfoy in the eye again, contrasting the fake amused expression Malfoy had on his face. Harry's was genuine.
Pansy stood there, face gawking for a while before she nodded. Blaise was rooted to the floor with a blank expression, and Pansy dragged him by arm towards Harry's direction. Would they be suspicious of him? About to ask questions of how Malfoy's injury was? He never associated himself with Parkinson and Zabini properly before, but he knew the two were less annoying than Draco.
The whole afternoon, Harry was preoccupied even after his classes and didn't bother eating. Exactly three o-five, he dashed towards the broom cupboard without consulting Ron and Hermione about his antics. They wouldn't approve of how he'd risk himself again in the presence of Draco Malfoy, but Harry was fond of getting into danger and knew he'd get something from it. He had been meddlesome enough to prove his antics were effective. He just burned Voldemort's face with his own hands, slayed a Basilisk, prevented Dementors from killing his godfather - all because of his curios nature.
Sighing again, he trudged back to the circle and made sure he threw daggers of threatening glare directly at Abbot before he looked at Malfoy. He didn't knew this lady was up to no good. He always thought Abbot was goody-goody.
They never kissed this passionately. And never he would've dreamed of being kissed like this by a man, and Malfoy, of all people, the fucking -
"But I don't know how to identify which is which and how to arrange it by their strength," Harry said.
obvious who you're thinking of. We have a test in a few minutes, tut tut! Let's talk about him later."
Upon reaching the bathroom, he held the boy's chest gently and said, "I don't want you to come in here with me. You could get hurt. We don't know what's completely there. Could you run to the Hospital Wing and ask for Madam Pomfrey's help instead?"
"I wanted to talk to you." Harry would've scratched the back of his head if Malfoy had let him raise his arm. "But under our circumstances, normal talks aren't in both of our agendas."
"Good to hear," Harry said, relaxed about their current situation. Malfoy didn't look tense around him anymore which oddly satisfied Harry. There was a better and light air surrounding them - something casual friends would have.
The music too was loud and it was practically destroying Harry’s eardrums, the energy of the color-changing room dizzying him. Harry wasn’t a party person, and he thought he shouldn't have come. He guessed it was too late since the Inter-House Unity started at seven o'clock sharp.
Harry squinted at the idea of Inter-House Unity. It wasn't usual in the ears. "What's that?" he asked.
He could hear the wet, obscene noises they were making as their lips smacked and Harry was sure he tasted how much Malfoy wanted him back.
He thought of Luna for a moment after that and explicitly blushed. Well since for so long already, harry never wanted the fame, glory and easy chance his faith had given him for being The-Boy-Who-Lived. Everyone only wanted him for his name and never for what he was inside. No one knew him enough or tried to know him for that matter. For now he just wanted to talk to Draco, clear up the tension between them and hear a bloody good explanation from Malfoy even if that would cost him his pride.
Malfoy didn't move anymore, already deep in his sleep. Harry sighed in relief and tucked Draco back in his blanket himself, up to his chest.
He had been doing the game all his life and at this point, he knew what he'd say, what to do, and how to control it.
Arriving, Blaise and Pansy flopped themselves down the green sofa while Harry sat opposite of them. The place was familiar since Harry had been in their place in his second year. It was still fully-covered in a dark shade of green, the fireplace at the other side of the wall warming up the cold place. He was a bit pleased he was welcomed here as himself and not pretending as someone else.
"By the way," said Hermione, interrupting the boys' fit. “Tomorrow, all prefects are required to go to this Inter-House Unity arranged by Professor McGonagall. I don’t know the rest of the details… but I think the Head Boy could fill me in the details later."
"But I couldn't. You were bleeding! And it wasn't like I'd want to watch you die on the spot. It was a human thing to do."
a different partner!" Malfoy called after a few seconds of their brief and intense staring contest, hand shooting upwards.
" wailed Hermione continuously and she was barely recognizable anymore. The Gryffindors in their table seemed to be keen to scoot away from her spot except for Harry and Ron.
It was making him nervous so he kept his eyes closed as he heard sounds of a robe fluttering disturbingly, small trinkets falling to the ground and a heavy breath of surprise echoing. Harry was under the impression Malfoy was in mortified silence to see a naked Harry Potter.
He looked down for a second, watched Draco hum in his slumber, so peaceful and innocent-looking, as if he wasn’t capable of doing the most nefarious things a student could do to a schoolmate. His unkempt blond hair had softened the look of his pointy face too, and Harry could imagine him self-loathing if Malfoy found out his hair was a mess like this.
"Hey," Harry said, scratching the back of his head. He was terrified of being rejected himself, but he would risk it. "D-do you... I mean on Holiday, do you have - er, plans?"
Harry's eyelids had dropped a little and wiped the tear drying on both sides of his face. Malfoy was still holding him in place, and the sense of protection he felt was too strong that Harry was oddly soothed of Malfoy existing and sitting in front of him, complaining yet concerned, mad but human enough to feel and relate with the pain of other people.
They wiped their sweat off their faces first and spelled their clothes dry. Though Harry's heart wouldn’t calm down. It kept pounding, ordering Harry to talk to Malfoy, to address what happened this afternoon.
They said their farewells and Harry walked back to the castle with a shoulder probably heavier than the fir Hagrid chopped off the forest this morning. He might as well help Professor McGonagall and Professor Flitwick decorate the Hall and spend some time with Hagrid at his hut while Fang's head rested on his lap. He might also nibble on Hagrid's cake with the baking base of an almost-stone substance. Then later he could sneak about to the kitchen and help himself with three puddings and unlimited treacle tarts.
Draco didn’t respond anymore, lost for words. The two of them remained in their odd position for a seemingly interminable night and surprisingly comfortable silence: sitting together, with Draco curling to his side, listening to the sound of the calm blow of the wind from the outside. Harry's eyelids were starting to droop, completely sated despite knowing Malfoy was the one in his arms. Harry yawned after, snuggling closer to Malfoy who seemed to have fallen asleep first, comfortably pressing his head on Harry’s chest.
Double Potions had taken place, and it was the last of it before they proceeded to take Snape's practical test before the term ended. Harry had always admitted his hatred for this class more than what he had for Argus Filch and his cat, but this time, it seemed that his destiny was meant to crumble apart when Snape announced: "Mr. Potter and Mr. Malfoy at the left farthest corner.
Harry blushed further, not expecting her compliment. He couldn't help but smile at her similarity with Hermione. She and Hermione would've been best friends in other circumstances. "Tell me what to do then."
Harry's breath restricted as Draco pressed on his chest further. He certainly didn't expect he would be cornered like this, but he could try to be... civil.
Concentrating, Harry splayed the parchment of the Marauder's Map over his bedside table, not bothering to remove his shoes and doff his robes off since he had other plans for it. He watched the intricate details of moving black dots and places reveal on the paper. He needed it in the hopes it would direct him to the right path towards Malfoy without anyone to interrupt his plan - in other words, he would be cornering Malfoy. Harry rubbed his fingers gently at the rough surface of the paper as he attempted to look for Malfoy's dots.
From time to time, Harry would catch Draco looking at him, which was odd, but he chose to deliberately act he didn’t know he did. Since the space  of the room was tremendously narrowed from all the cluttered stuff, their shoulders would brush every time they’d exchange areas, and their eyes would land on each other accidentally. It kept happening until they finished cleaning the trophy room that it drove Harry crazy. He couldn’t stand being quiet – he couldn’t stand the silence when he knew well he wasn’t alone.
Draco growled, mouth twitching upwards as he stared at Harry avoiding his eyes. "Fuck you, Potter, don't make this about me. Goddamn this,
To Harry's dismay, Malfoy's eyebrows conjoined, head swiveling to look at Harry with a glare and calculative look. "Potter, stop burning holes through my skull. If you have something to say, then out with it! You're acting really odd."
They could Hex each other through the course of it. And it would lead to long hours of detention with lost house points!
Harry looked at him and curved his lips up a bit, amused. For a moment, he thought Draco was embarrassed. "Because this was what I might wanted when I was locked up in that cupboard, to feel someone hugging me, warming me up until it’s over, talking me out of my anxiety. I figured out this might be what you wanted too. Look at that – you stopped breathing heavily."
“Right this is completely pointless." Harry stepped forward, almost cornering Malfoy on a shelf. "Forget it! No more pleasantries."
at the table and asked Harry questions here and there when they decided it was best to sit in front of him, pushing Seamus away, but none of them received proper answers from Harry. It seemed that they finally noticed Harry didn't want attention at the moment so they resumed talking (with Ron changing the topic to legendary Quidditch matches between Montrose Magpies and Ballycastle Bats without involving Harry, which was highly-appreciated).
chance was to be grabbed. He wanted Malfoy to be genuinely his friend, he realized. But was that possible? When he rejected Malfoy's offer of friendship their first year?
" and pushed the door briskly. He stepped forward and had let the cold and dim room envelop him, closing the door behind.
Panic boiled in Harry's blood, almost dropping a pouch of roasted chopped murlap to the floor his elbow bumped. "What? W-what do I do then?" yelped Harry, not wanting to cause a scene and be humiliated about his destroyed arm at the Wing. It was his ego being tormented here, but he had no choice. His wand arm is his pride, the one that he'd use when he becomes an Auror, a head auror even at the Department of Magical Law Enforcement.
As they thumped back into Grimmauld's living room, now perfectly repaired, Harry felt a slight pang of guilt as his eyes fell upon the spot where he messed with two innocent minds. He sighed and willed the feelings away.
He stepped closer and realized the deep red piece of Auror uniform had been snagged on a branch and  torn, now just flapping about in the breeze.
"Then you can—" Draco choked up when Harry licked his lips beneath him. His eyes zeroed in on the action, and he seemingly forgot what he was saying.
"So Potter and Malfoy are...together now?" Hannah piped up from where she stood amongst the others Aurors that had inadvertently walked in on their kiss.
"Harry—Harry, please, you'll blow the place up—" Ginny chased after Harry while he stormed through their house, his magic crackling and snapping through the air, whipping around out of control.
Draco snorted, probably one of the first few actual emotions Harry had seen him express through any of their few interactions.
That was the equivalent of a death wish, Draco mused as he stood in the doorway. Should he go in? He wanted to see how big the damage was, he was horrified to find himself worried about Potter. Well, Potter
He paid them no mind and headed straight for the front door—but just before they were to leave, he stopped and turned around to glare at his father.
Not because of any particular love of academia (Hermione was the only one barmy enough), but because Draco had reverted back to his old ways of pretending Harry didn't exist, which had gotten exceedingly awkward and thick, because now, they were not in a huge manor with two stories and plenty of rooms they could avoid each other in, they were in a tiny Hogwarts dorm.
"No. Breaking it will only make the Masters very sick for a while. However, the bond mustn't be broken for at least six months."
And the things that guy said, they made Harry shudder. He hadn't been at school during that seventh year, he hadn't seen anything Draco might've had to do when he couldn't exactly choose otherwise, but he did know some of it through second hand accounts and it was cruel and dark and sickening. Hearing it so blatantly thrown about really made Harry's stomach tumble, he simply could never imagine Draco as Harry knew him to torture a poor little girl into losing her ability to move.
Harry was sleeping, curled up into Draco, splayed over him, who was carding his fingers through Harry's hair and smiling down at him as if Harry was his reason to
Harry knew he'd made the right decision about a month after he transferred from the Control Of Magical Creatures department to the DMLE.
wrong." He defended himself before they both stepped into the living room, where Harry was splayed over the couch and staring listlessly at the ceiling.
Draco was glad to be back to Hogwarts. It gave his days a bit of much needed structure. Especially when the entire school seemed aghast and suspicious of his friendship with the Golden Trio. It was annoying on one hand, but he could understand on the other.
It took a while, but eventually, his knot softened up enough for Harry to be able to pull out and lie next to Draco on the floor.
He still had Potter's note in his pocket, and he stuffed a hand into the pocket to grab it, the texture of the parchment giving him something else to focus on except Potter's wide fucking happy grin while he sipped coffee and sat back with unbuttoned robes that revealed more of his skin than Draco was able to keep a coherent head around at any given moment.
He twisted around in Harry's arms to face him, bringing one hand to cradle Harry's head and the other to smooth his hair away. His voice felt thin when he finally answered:
She knew that partly from noticing it on her own, and partly (mostly, if she was being honest) from everything Harry constantly told her about him.
He lunged forwards and kissed Harry, toppling him over backwards and onto the hard floor, his full weight pinning Harry.
Harry felt too jumbled to attempt to process it. He hadn't thought that about Malfoy for a long time. Yes, there was a period where just thinking about him made Harry's stomach curdle with fury, but not anymore. Not for a while.
Then, Hermione had leaned over and asked whether they should do something. Harry had blinked and realized that if he'd been willing to give Tom a chance at regret and redemption at least once before they ended things, then Draco Malfoy sure as hell deserved one.
He'd sigh and turn away every time, and Pansy would be there to pick up the conversation and lift his spirits and perhaps lean into him if they were in Draco's line of sight, which they most often were, because Pansy and Hermione coordinated these meetings with great dedication and precision.
should I trust what Malfoy says? He hates Harry, he likely put Harry in danger himself!" Ronald defended, throwing his arms out.
"Right, yea. So does that mean one of us will have to—go into the uh, magic realm thing?" Weasley rubbed his neck awkwardly while he asked, clearly doing his best to catch on.
"But I'd made a Slytherin enemy on the train beforehand, so I figured I wouldn't want to share a house with him when it came down to it."
The blonde almost rolled his eyes, but he knew it would hurt Harry if he did so, so he just huffed and pouted, taking a deep breath before he started to press in, sure he was going cross-eyed into delirium as he entered Harry in a long, slow slide.
Harry mewled softly as Draco pet through his hair, tightening his hold on Draco, whom sighed softly into Harry's mouth.
He unlocked the heavy basement door and stepped in, grimacing at the sight of Harry panting and boneless on the floor, in torn clothes.
was something to ponder. Perhaps Draco was in love with someone too, just like Harry, and that is why the potion influenced him so? Harry didn't know, but he enjoyed daydreaming it was
"Draco, darling, Lucius wasn't thinking properly when he'd spoken." She directed a sharp glare to her husband. "Of course we are in Mr.Potter's debt for saving our lives, and yours too."
There was a silence that felt like hours, even though there was seemingly no discernible way to tell time here.
Ginny and Astoria had been dating for a year or so back in Hogwarts and really fell for each other—until Astoria broke up with Gin because her parents had already arranged for her to marry Draco.
As he stepped onto the floor and headed for his office, Robards met him in the hall and stopped him:
"I...actually have no idea about that one." Harry turned around to face the owner of the voice, who turned out to be Ron.
The old lady was very kind, Draco mused absentmindedly as he and Ron returned to the Ministry from her home. She seemed lonely though. Was Harry lonely wherever he was? Draco hoped not. He hoped Harry would return soon. Draco had been keeping his apartment clean—just in case. It would be no good if Harry came home to dust and cobwebs.
It was now 7:55pm, Harry usually returned around 8. Draco seated himself into the chair, let himself sink into it, eyes trained on the front door.
Harry pushed himself to stand, his right arm searing further. He grit his teeth not to scream out in agony, and instead forced himself to call for Draco.
studying Veelas, Inferi, Graphorns and other magical beasts, it had just grown...repetitive after a while. Dull. He didn't like repetition, it wore him down, so he put in his resignation and applied for training for the Aurors, finding the very energetic, new tempo much more satisfactory.
he is your best friend." Potter deadpanned. "Besides, even if I were willing to tell you, I wouldn't do it for free, knowing the risk to my health." His eyes gleamed in the most conniving of ways.
Hermione had been far bolder and more liberal than Pansy in her moves, which Pansy had to admit was hot as hell on her, because Potter was a bit of an emotional stub.
The public had taken well to his return as well, obviously. There was a huge celebration, but oddly enough the press and paparazzi weren't as pressing as they had all assumed they'd be. They seemed almost fearful of approaching Harry, as if he was some kind of ghost, an alien thing. Harry didn't help the impression when he hissed randomly at those few brave ones that dared come close. He found great fun in scaring away reporters and keeping his name out of the press and the news as much as possible, and Ron had to admit, he found great fun in watching it, watching Harry dive back into his life with all the eagerness and joy of a child.
Harry knew then, without any shadows or doubts—the way his heart flowed with affection and honey thick warmth, that he
tell her, that much was true, but Harry did. He came to her a day before they broke up, and told her
"..Come to think of it..he's been staring at Harry a lot more, though he's been doing that since we were eleven so I guess that's why it took me so long to notice...Pair that with the rest of the story and....
Narcissa suppressed the urge to roll her eyes, it's been almost a decade since the war ended, as she led him into the sitting room and called the elves to bring some tea.
"I am." He just nodded at his ginger friend and sat down to eat. Draco still sat away from Harry during meals, presumably because of Ron and Hermione but otherwise they started pretty much being joined at the hip at all times, which Harry was resolutely okay with.
The day Draco finally removed Harry's bandages, Harry was a bit surprised to see his arm. It looked as though there were merely splotches of pale, milky skin covering his own, it did not look like a scar, or new skin at all. It was smoothed over, looked pretty much normal. It reminded Harry a little bit of a thing called Vitiligo that some Muggles had.
"Hey, hey, Malfoy, everything's fine, calm down—" He assured, allowing the sentence to trail off. Only then did he notice how much his own hands were shaking, his entire body wracked with a terrifying adrenaline rush that left him woozy.
Malfoy was staring at him with this beseeching expression that Harry couldn't quite decipher, but then the moment broke and he nodded so they left the bathroom.
Potter stepped in closer and grabbed Draco's hand, twisting their hold until it represented a wizarding marriage knot. A lump congealed in Draco's throat.
For a heart stopping moment, a terrible thing occurred to Pansy—what the fuck had Draco said? He couldn't have possibly been drunk enough to—
either, because Harry was hellbent on protecting Draco's well-being as much as he possibly could, and while Hermione
"We'll need to work separately with them, to take a look at their magic and respective halves of the bonding individually before pairing it into one." Ginerva explained further, gaze flickering to Draco and Astoria only briefly.
Potter nodded and walked into the room, floating a tray of tea behind him. He took a seat in one of the armchairs and placed the tray onto the small coffee table.
The ginger kicked off his boots at the door and padded through the kitchen and living room, looking for Draco—who was nowhere to be found.
Harry parted his lips when Draco's tongue swept out to push into his mouth and he pressed back just as eagerly, tilting his head so their kiss would deepen.
"You're a menace." Draco chided him with no real inflection as he continued to undress and amble into the bathroom to wash the ashwinder stains out of his skin.
Such a reply shocked Harry. He stopped, stared at Malfoy with the most beseeching expression, he was sure.
He appeared worn and tired, and if Draco wasn't spending all his time staring at him, he wagered a guess he wouldn't of even noticed anything was amiss.
Harry sighed and shifted in his seat—an uncomfortable chill had climbed up his spine ever since he read the letter:
"We both have to participate. Here—" He kept tutoring Harry at it, softer and more patient than Harry deserved at that point. They spent the rest of the day practicing that.
Pansy refrained from chuckling. Draco Malfoy didn't need to be drunk at all to hug you, but she'd be damned if she told Potter that.
A sizzling turquoise light pulsed into the guy's skin before fading entirely, with a faint hissing sound. That was the cue.
Harry didn't stop. As he moved Malfoy's fringe away, he allowed his hand to slip deeper into the blonde hair, fingers combing out the knots until his palm rested loosely on the back of Malfoy's neck. He traced a circle there with his thumb, bringing his other hand to try to right Malfoy's torn robes somewhat so he wouldn't feel too exposed and vulnerable.
The worst part was that Harry knew he was at fault, and that he had done it deliberately. It was just that at the time he didn't know how else to respond because he couldn't let on his true feelings and there didn't appear to be any other choice for him.
Ron's eyes were growing wide with horror, he was gawking, while Hermione's grew narrow with curiosity.
After getting paired up to be Auror partners, the two of them reconciled a lot of their past hatred, and had eventually moved in together for practicality.
The only reason he'd stayed sane is because he had Hermione's love to fall back on, just like she had his, and they grieved together, them, their entire family, they held together like troopers—because they had to.
The bitter tang that this was the last time he'd have Harry sat lodged in Draco's throat like a knife in his windpipe, his nails scrabbling at Harry's back tighter, praying this to last as long as possible, in spite of the ache in his bollocks as he held on savagely.
"Alohomora this." He pointed at it and Malfoy obeyed without complaint, his wand hand trembling slightly still.
been harder to convince. Then he felt horrible for even thinking that, as a life was a life, no matter who it belonged to. And he knew he could never live with himself if he let another person be orphaned when he had the means to do something about it. Malfoy or not, in the end, Harry found it didn't matter. He'd have done the same for anyone.
"And so is she." Potter confirmed and then uncoiled the cord to end the faux bonding and he dropped Draco's hand.
His friends wouldn't lie to him, so if they were so certain Draco felt the same, there must be truth to it, which meant Harry wouldn't have to die alone and lonely, like he'd planned to do before he was told that Draco liked him too.
"Don't know. I found him like that." Draco replied, attempting to appear neutral even though he was actually quite furious at whoever had the nerve.
Just as he was able to make some headway, a particularly violent gust of unstable magical energy burst forth from the hall and slammed into Harry so forcefully it knocked his feet out from under him and he collapsed backwards, colliding with the harsh, trembling floor. His head banged against the wood with an echoed thud and all the air from his lungs constricted out his throat.
"And?" He inquired, voice shaky. There was only one thing that could mean and it threatened to screw everything up.
Draco called to Astoria from the chaise he was lounging on when he heard the ancient bell echo through the Manor. As far as he knew they weren't expecting guests, but he could be wrong. He didn't pay much attention to anything nowadays. After he'd been given no choice in who to marry, he figured he wouldn't ever really have a choice in anything and things stopped mattering. He couldn't be with who he wanted to be with anyways, or really go out and be free to live because of the war—so who cares at this point really.
Harry's breath shuddered as he pulled his hand away, and conjured some lube to spread over himself before aligning his cock to Draco's entrance, and slowly pushed in.
After the pleasantries were over and they were seated, the trainer, Clara, let Snowflake out of the crate and took some notes on his behavior and character.
"All the staring, following around, come on, Harry it's the textbook crush." Ron threw his hands up in clear outrage at Harry's obliviousness. "It's so obvious."
"I'll handle him." Harry muttered to Ron and pushed through the crowd until he was out front, his gaze locked on Malfoy, who seemed unable to discern any of his surroundings.
"And you also like him, we know." Hermione continued. "So why in the name of hell did you ever let him think you're only around out of obligation?"
"I sincerely hate you." Draco informed him in a small, pitiful voice before rolling over to lay next to Harry.
"We sort of just do what you did just now, improvise and hope for the best. Yeah, rarely is it that we actually plan anything, and if we do, Harry usually ends up botching it somehow." She shrugged and Ron snorted as he unlayered the wardswork.
"Okay." He said evenly instead—and Malfoy looked pleasantly surprised, relieved and perhaps a tad impressed that Harry hadn't laughed at him.
"I accepted it." Potter shrugged, lips twitching into a soft smile, the corners by his eyes crinkling.
"Master Harry is indeed in the realm of magic, but, not just anywhere. He has been swallowed by the magic of Grimmauld place. He is within Grimmauld's magic."
"The part of the house you wandered into, that opened for you, it's the Ancestral wing of Grimmauld." Harry explained.
When Draco arrived to work the next morning, he stopped dead in his tracks. Potter was standing...on a chair...with the rest of the department gathered around him and Weasley attempting to coax him down. But Potter shook Weasley off and cleared his throat:
"Yes, Harry." He blurted quietly, and Harry scrunched his nose and chuckled. Merlin, he was whipped, but Draco was absolutely adorable when flustered, so who could honestly blame him?
It was a bit of a struggle to school her features, but Pansy steeled herself and leaned back in her chair, laying off Potter and instead laying into Hermione, to read over her notes and, well, she wore a nice flowery perfume too.
"Fine." Draco's voice was clipped and breathless. There was soft shuffling rustling through the closed door.
He couldn't just tear through Hogwarts' wards either, partly because he doubted he had enough power to do so and partly because that would cause a huge scandal.
"Hermione! They were sucking face! In the middle of their office!" Ron yelled when he came home instead of saying 'hello' like a normal person.
"Yeah. Honestly, Harry, for the Chosen One, you're remarkably bad at noticing you are being stalked. In class Malfoy stares at you, in meals, when we walk around he stays a few paces behind you. Come on, surely you noticed
Harry saw Draco swallow and flush heavily, he himself feeling pretty similarly wrecked as they left together.
Ginny grabbed him by the shoulders and steadied him. "Ease up, okay?" She talked low and Harry managed a clipped nod as his magic stopped simmering.
Goodness, Draco will never understand children and their childish naivete. Teddy was just too young to understand the reality of it, certainly, though Draco couldn't say it didn't warm his heart to see someone interpret his roles in the war as something other than evil.
If Harry was bold enough, he might have wondered whether his presence had anything to do with helping Draco sleep.
"It says I have an incorrigible hero complex that will one day condemn me to a fate worse than death somehow." He snickered instead of kissing Draco like he wanted to.
"Harry. Let's go." Ginerva grabbed him by the arm and tugged on it, breaking the tension. Draco blinked and stared after them as they left.
"The—tattoo? What tattoo?" He hadn't ever gotten any tattoos. He'd considered getting some to cover up the Mark once or twice, but never really got around to it.
"Grimmauld will assimilate me into the magic itself. It can not keep me alive on its own for much longer, I'd drain it beyond repair. Then, when I'm part of the magic, I'll essentially become the house itself and then see and feel everything within it."
was wrong with Draco's office, because between the bathroom incident and all of this new information, Harry was 100% convinced that something was up with it.
Harry let the smile that had been fighting to claim a space on his face since he'd realized grace his features when he heard that, and he chuckled breathlessly:
"Because—" A grocery store was really not a good place to rehash what a horrible individual Draco used to be, so instead of words, Draco demonstrated what he meant with a vague hand gesture between them.
Harry was in a good mood when he'd arrived to work that morning. He got along well with his partner, Zach was a good guy, and he genuinely enjoyed the job. It was odd having to face Malfoy again, who also worked for the DMLE, even odder was the fact Malfoy was a Veela, that his entire family line were Veelas, but Harry found he didn't really mind since Malfoy mostly stayed out of his way. He stayed out of everyone's way really. He didn't even have a partner,  was the only Auror who worked solo. Apparently, too many thought it acceptable to
"Harry wait!" She approached, holding a tiny tin of something. When she was right in front of him she dipped her fingers into the tin and then gently smeared some salve over the hex on Harry's cheek and ear. Healing charms left the skin dry and knitted, so everyone treated Stinging hexes the Muggle way.
Potter laughed, long and merry. Draco was certain something had popped somewhere—it wasn't him, he swears!
Harry sucked in a silent breath. He was pretty sure that Draco's parents, Lucius in particular, wouldn't take well to hearing about it. Though at the same time he couldn't lie to his clients, but he
Always had to be fucking death with these archaic bonds and ancient magics. They had to be dramatic as all holy fuck, couldn't settle for grievous bodily harm for example. At least that can be healed. No, they had to go for lives.
They'd be graduating just a few short months after this ball, and if it's not done now, she doubted it ever would be.
"I'm laying perfectly still, so I'm not doing anything to you. Besides, you're the one who collapsed over me like an utter wanker."
Despite himself, Harry chuckled, figured he was just slightly delirious from everything that happened:
In a few steps she was in front of him and tugging the letter out of his hands to read it for herself.
"I'll explain later." He muttered to them. "How have you guys been?" He grinned as he looked at them. They looked the same and yet not, more grown and mature, but still Harry's best friends.
Potter started to sway them slowly, completely off beat, though he seemed perfectly content, as he pressed in even closer, his forehead resting against Draco's.
Harry came to the stairs and made his way back up, teetering on a dangerous line of stepping on broken glass and splinters while his eyes were upturned to the ceiling, searching. He prayed to Merlin it was still there and wasn't damaged. As soon as his gaze caught on the little nook, Harry sighed a breath of relief. Grimmauld's attic was secured with wards that blasted off magic attacks and the like as well as many different layers of security. It was made such because most of the top secret Order meetings and discussions took place there.
"Yeah, really. The Hat wanted to sort me into Slytherin, buuut—" Harry trailed off with a lilt in his voice.
"You're hesitating. Stop it, stop waiting," Harry's hand did not leave Draco's shoulder yet, nor did his tone become harsh. "Come with me, won't you?"
Narcissa went ashen when she saw her son with Harry Potter, Lucius's face mirroring his wife's, though they both knew better than to say anything.
"What the hell are you doing up there?" were the only words Harry could summon to the sight of Draco Malfoy, the tall, lanky prat, limbs thrown every which way across tree branches, face contorted into a deeply bitter expression, with a ruined, scrathed up and torn Auror robe hanging off his shoulders.
What was there for Harry to say now though? All he could do was lie, or bend the truth at the very least. Anything remotely earnest he could answer with would reveal too much. Skewing the truth was the only option left at this point. He slowly turned around to face Draco and leaned his weight on the door, hoping he looked more relaxed than he felt. Then he affected a shrug and spoke:
"I do care, okay, yeah, thank you Kreacher." He dismissed the elf, who popped off without another word.
There were a couple inches of space between them, a distance Draco had grown uncomfortably aware of uncomfortably quickly as he attempted to fall asleep too.
like this." Harry reiterated stubbornly. It felt important that everyone there knew he wasn't power hungry, he was better than that. With a subdued sigh, Harry knew there was no salvaging this situation anymore and he reached for the device, curling his fingers around it. The moment he did so, he felt a sharp jolt of burning pain flood his veins and continue to blaze for long seconds. Harry let out a soft shriek of ache as the feeling intensified, the magic from the device blending into his bloodstream while the bond fully formed.
"Right. Let's go then." He just about caught the stupefied expression on Malfoy's face as he turned away to stalk back into the house, gesturing for Malfoy to follow him in. He did. Harry lead them to a locked wardrobe:
