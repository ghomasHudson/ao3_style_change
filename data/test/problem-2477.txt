“Thank you” She squealed, lunging at him to wrap her small arms around his neck “Thank you so much, sir”
“This is our matching couple shirt” Draco sniffled softly while looking at the large bucket he found in his apartment, which Hermione had confirmed that it wouldn’t melt from the fire “The arsehole didn’t even wear it more than twice”
can I speak to you for a minute, please?” He could see Potter flinched, his back facing Draco while Weasley snorted and smacked Potter’s back before walking out, and now there were only two of them in the room
“Oh, this is beautiful” Hermione gasped
“Have a wild guess”
“Well, are we ever sure about anything?” Draco said, applying some blush on Ron’s cheeks, making it a bit rosy “Look, do you get jealous when he’s with a guy?”
“Yeah, thank you” Goldstein said, for some reason he was sitting next to Draco today, he was actually waiting for Potter, but somehow this Ravenclaw took the spot. It has been a few days since he started sleeping with Potter, and because he has to keep people from wondering, he has to stay with Potter for a large amount of time for the day. They didn’t kiss or hug in public, but Draco would still appear next to him so other students won’t be suspicious of them.
He heard Ginny hollering, she was clearly pissed again. And even before he could do anything, the blond took off his own Slytherin tie, only to put in around Harry’s neck instead. This time, he finally got a clear view.
“Peas”
“Sounds like a good plan” Potter nodded in agreement as they all left together
you?”
” Harry said breathlessly. According to Pansy, Draco got hit on by his patients numerous times when he checked on them, it wasn’t a surprise, Draco was simply beautiful, Harry was head over heels for him every day, of course others would be charmed by him too, and some of them were even rich Purebloods, how could Harry compete with that? “He would never”
“Hi” He said cheekily and put his legs over Harry’s lap, inching closer to his
“Visiting Draco, why are you yelling, darling?” He could hear Narcissa’s voice and he quickly chugged off his wine glass before getting off the seat
“Oh, really?” Draco smirked, he wasn’t sure whether he was smirking because he’d win in a few moves or because Ron was being so oblivious “He never bring any extra quill, I’ve borrowed many times” He watched Ron’s curious expression closely and continued “Maybe you’re just more special to him than the others”
“Yes…is that okay?” Neville stopped undoing his belt and looked at Theo “Unless you don’t want to”
“We know you have really deep romantic
jealous” Hermione grinned
“Do I get a hug too?” Potter teased him with a bright grin, opening his arm wide.
you love them, or like them, in your case. I fell for Pansy, the one person I didn’t think I would. And why? I mean, she used to be so mean”
“Us?”
“Oh the guy, the guy insisted I should have your name engraved” Clearly another lie.
“Alright, who wants to go first?” Luna shook her hat and Seamus quickly raised his arm along with Padma “One should act and the other will guess” Seamus and Padma started whispering in each other’s ear and Seamus finally put his hand in the box to pick up a piece of parchment “I’ll act, she’ll guess”
“Alright, stop” He groaned “If I have to
“It’s not my turn yet”
“Don’t say that, you’re not a Seer, Blaise” Theo pouted at him and tapped on Draco’s shoulder “So, how is it with Potter? Your future boyfriend?”
“Please, you’re flattering me, Harry”
“What’s going on?”
” Draco cried out “If I
“Can you slip your hands under my waistband a bit? Make sure the cream go everywhere” Draco mumbled and the Auror mumbled some words Draco couldn’t hear, then the hands were going slower, until-
“Sorry, force of habit” Potter said, stopping himself from putting more food in his tray “I can’t help it”
“You’ve got it all right?”
“Don’t worry, I got Splinched once, I won’t get it again, go on,
“How could I not?” Harry said, he didn’t really regret saying it out loud, he meant it. Harry leaned close and kissed him once again, feeling Draco’s nails on his back as he kept ramming in. He trailed down his neck, licking and sucking on his pulse point, making sure Draco will be covered in hickeys the next morning, for everyone to know that Draco was his “I love you”
“Okay” Harry said softly as Molly left them alone, he tilted Draco’s face up by his chin and he was met with Harry’s soft eyes again “What’s wrong, Draco?”
“I’m not the owner” Pansy explained “Just take the dragon”
“I do know how, it’s just sometimes, people can be...”
“Well, I cleaned all the shits that was in it” Pansy shrugged and walked to their spot, her heels clicking on the floor “So…excited to know why I called you guys in?”
“Theo” She whispered in his ear “Be brave”
horny. He looked at the corner of the room and saw Neville staring at Theo, Draco looked at his friend, still being cornered by Roger, and back at Neville, whose hands were balled into fists
“Don’t worry, eye drop is fine” Harry said
“Hey”
” The blond whined when Harry started thrusting into him, it felt so good to be inside Draco again. He never knew he missed Draco that much until he saw him again tonight, Draco was like a type of drug and he has got Harry addicted without knowing.
“Thanks”
“Same difference” Pansy shrugged at Hermione’s words and earned a chuckle from her wife “And don’t get me started on Nev and Theo, traitors”
“That’s how he got me” Ron snickered, putting his chef hat back on his head “Let’s head out” Harry nodded and they walked out of the kitchen, the Auror took a deep breath when he saw Draco again, sitting on a table next to his boyfriend, with the girls sitting around them. He didn’t stop walking, he could face Draco, it could not be
“Really?” Harry snorted and opened the door to his bedroom “I should have seen it coming”
“I could never” Harry cupped his cheeks as Draco leaned into it “Like Luna said, there are many universes, and maybe your world doesn’t have the same beginning like us, it can still have the same ending. Don’t you think?”
because that night was wrong, it didn’t go like you planned, and I want this one to go
version of Draco. He was still unable to comprehend the fact that Potter was in love with him. It could
“You just said your conversation contained an awkward confession, and then you said you gave him your address and you hope to get a date with him” Harry explained, and it took Draco a few seconds to take it in, letting out a short chortle.
“Break the floor, even” Pansy laughed along with Ron and paused for a second before nudging him “Hey, what if I say Draco’s transferred back here because of me?”
would have been horny”
“She said…she’ll be glad in advance when Draco introduces Harry tomorrow to them” Pansy said, grabbing the bottle and chugging it down in one go “That woman is scary”
“He might be cute for you” Draco said, adding his opinion in so Theodore might be curious about Neville, he was hoping it would work. And it did, based on the way Theodore hummed, a small smile forming on his lips.
He whispered with his trembling voice, as Harry kept playing with his nipples, his hands roaming all over Draco’s skin, both of their skins were wet and salty from the ocean. He looked at Harry, leaning close and connecting their lips with a salty kiss, he was never tired of kissing Harry, it was an never ending fire between them every time they kiss. He felt Harry slipping his tongue in as he slid his hands down, scratching Harry’s chest just so slightly until he reached his husband’s hard cock, he stroke it slowly, not wanting him to cum right away, he wanted to tease Harry just like Harry was doing to him right now. He moaned into the kiss, quickening the pace of his hand when Harry pushed the third finger in, curling it and making Draco jumped
“Wait, what? Why was he crying?”
was looking for him. Theo shrunk his clothing rack and his other tools once Draco left, Theo looked around the room and sighed before heading out. He walked along the hall and stopped when he heard voices on his right, he turned and that was it, his heart finally broke into pieces for real, because Neville was kissing Abbot right there. Theo clenched his hand on his bag and looked ahead, the lift let out a small ‘
“Hey” Draco tried to wave once he saw Neville coming to his spot with two empty glasses in his hands while Theodore was putting all his weight on the blond, making him tremble “Longbottom, can I, can I ask you for a favour?”
“Who? Blaise’s sitting on the couch, staring intently at Weasley as if no one sees. Theodore is grinding up against some people, and you are bickering with Granger over who has to clean the party”
“Er, I saw Smith asking you out today” Harry began first “Did you, er, did you say yes?”
“Thank you” He looked at the ring, mesmerised by it, he couldn’t believe they’d do this, it was shocking him greatly “I don’t know what to say”
” He spatted out, punching Neville’s chest, he didn’t even have the strength anymore
a horrible place to put a spare key in.
“You too, er, Malfoy” Potter said, stepping back and disappearing into the crowd. His relationship with Potter since Eighth Year have been…weird, frankly, they weren’t friends, but they weren’t enemies either, they kept their distance since they graduated. And since Draco became a Healer, he met Potter more times than he could count in St. Mungo’s, but recently for some unknown reason, Potter started avoiding him, he always asked for another Healer to check on him, and always find the quickest way to run away whenever he saw Draco. He understood that Potter probably didn’t like him, but he thought they have got over that rival stuff already.
“Look, you can ask someone else here” Hermione said, her eyes roaming around the room. As a shiver ran down his spine, he crouched down, hiding himself behind Blaise and Ron “
” Pansy cut off the Head Auror’s words and poked in his chest again, so hard that he had to step back a bit “
“Can’t promise you that” Pansy laughed and disappeared into the crowd with the rest of their friends. Draco pushed Harry into the spot in the middle of the booth, so if they intended to do anything…
” Harry called out after him, but Draco didn’t listen. He didn’t know why he was running too, but he just has to. He hated confrontation, especially now that Harry knew he kissed Draco and didn’t remember. He sprinted to quickly to the Apparition point and stopped then
“That’s
gift for Draco before Christmas, a grey…what did she call it? A grey Virgin-Killing sweater, the Muggles definitely invented it. Draco tried it on when he was home alone, then somehow Harry was at the door gawking at him with wide eyes. The next thing he knew, they were doing it on the stairs, they didn’t even get to the bedroom, not even the second floor “
“For the Potions test today, we’ll be making three of the hardest potions in three hours, Draught of Living Death, Draught of Peace, and Amortentia in three hours” Professor Slughorn walked between the tables, explaining the test for them “Time is limited toda—…” He stopped when the door was opened, revealing Harry and Ron rushing in, their clothes disheveled. Draco rolled his eyes and turned back to look at the Professor, even at the last exam, he could still be late.
“You’d make a pretty flower girl” Harry pinched her nose, making her giggle “But well, uncle Draco is with Brandon now”
“You are so wild, Theo” Draco commented, his hand fidgeting with the belt on Harry’s trousers “What if you got caught?”
“Yeah, I did” He said, sighing and standing up, when he walked to Harry’s spot, the Gryffindor was opening his legs so Draco could sit between. When the blond sat down, his back was pressed against Harry’s bodies, he folded his legs as Harry put his hands on his own thighs. He could even feel his breath ghosting at the nape of his neck, Draco has goosebumps under his robes and tried to focus on the game.
“I don’t care about the past, do you?” Theo cupped Neville’s face and kissed his lips gently, Neville shook his head, kissing Theo back “But I
“Yeah?” Ron jolted when his husband scared him from behind, he always walked as quiet as a Kneazle “What’s wrong?”
“Have a wild guess”
She glared at the both of them, and in the 14 years being friends with Hermione, he knew one thing, he should
“No, I need you”
“I’m not that daft” Harry said, his hands still clutched on his legs, he didn’t move, so did Draco “You’re back?”
“Oh, Blaise said that?” He asked and Ron nodded, he didn’t know both of them had small talks when they study too, Blaise absolutely disliked small talks “Is this Muggle chess?”
Ginny spoke up and Draco realised the call hasn’t ended yet “Are you still okay?”
“Do you know me, Draco?” She looked at him with her eyebrow arched, he believed her, she could absolutely do such reckless thing to destroy his reputation “
She smirked, walking out of the Great Hall with Hermione and everyone else. She waved her hand and the door closed, leaving Draco and Harry there.
“Okay”
Draco pleaded, his hands grabbing at the sands as water kept hitting his body. Harry draped Draco’s legs over his shoulders, his hand found the blond’s twitching cock and started stroking it “
“Robards found out the location of this group of dark wizards and we need to bust them right there and then” Harry said and Ron noticed he was rubbing a spot on his arm. He
important things he shouldn’t have “Put on some robes”
“I didn’t know you were
“Is it his birthday or yours?” Blaise spoke, making Theodore huffed loudly
“It’s cute how you think you can hold my parents’ hands and they’d be swooned by you, they’re not me” Draco chuckled and opened the door in, they took careful steps until they reached the dining room and Draco pushed Harry away “You stay here, I’ll go in first” Harry nodded at him and stayed in his place as Draco made his way in the dining room, where his parents were sitting.
“N-no” Draco said and pushed Potter away, but the git slipped and fell on his arse into the water
Draco pleaded softly, his hands cupping Harry’s face, leaning in close and rested his forehead on Harry’s “I’m not
“He’s going to lose anyway” He said, startling Ron with his words
“Oh? I have black hair too”
“Longbottom who?”
“Yeah, I think I do” Draco said with a knowing smile, they have been together for twenty two years after all, with just one look they’d know what the other one was thinking about. They opened the door and walked out hand in hand, they could still meet their friends later.
horny yet “I only have that because sometimes my mum comes and she likes it. I also have beer, and coffee. I have decaf, one of my uncles likes it that way. Oh, and I got juice, and milk”
” Harry mumbled and pulled Draco back against his chest, his hands playing with Draco’s hard buds again. Draco didn’t have to move anymore, now it was all Harry’s work and all the blond has to do was kneeling there and take everything “I love you”
Harry missed the voice so much. All he wanted was to touch and to kiss Draco again
talking with the snake, half naked and only has his shoulder holster on, his body shiny because of the lotion.
hard.
“I think I’m falling in love with you” Harry whispered in his ear, nuzzling his nose under Draco’s ear
“I have three things to tell you as well, Draco” He was surprised at his mother’s reaction, and nodded at her so she could continue “First, we kind of know that you’re gay, dear. You’ve been obsessing over Harry, the only boy you ever talked about even before Hogwarts”
“You’re weird”
“He sucks at it, I can see it on his face” Draco looked at Ron, giving him a slight smile “If you want, I can play with you, you’ll have a real opponent then”
“Potter, tell me…what the fuck just happened?”
“I love you—
” Draco breathed out her name as she was walking back to their booth, Draco stopped moving and leaned back on the table again, he raised his hips a bit so the cock wasn’t deep inside him
“Draco?”
Harry sighed again and turned around
“Yeah” Hermione seemed to understand whatever Pansy was implying and helped her “Wouldn’t want the Ginny incident to happen again, right?”
“You’re crazy” She said, chugging on her drink and stomping away, probably to Millicent and Daphne’s spot to tell them. Maybe they could guide her better than Draco.
Potter didn’t cuddle with him. He felt weird and cold even though it was May, it was crazy to feel this way, but understandable, Potter has been hugging him every night for the past month,
“What are you going to do after graduation?” Potter asked him, Draco rubbed his hands together again unconsciously, shivering a little while thinking of an answer.
Draco said, and it wasn’t a lie, every time they celebrated their anniversary, Pansy would send them a special gift that
“No, you just teased me”
“You should head home first” He said and watched the man walked away, Theo sighed and walked into the bathroom near him. He had just let a perfectly good guy go because he couldn’t forget about one person. He stared at himself in the mirror, how did he become like this? Three years ago, he was fine. But Neville decided to come and…be nice to him, Theo wasn’t always cheerful like now, he was depressed, he was lonely, he filled his void by letting men filled themselves in him, he was emotionless. But then one day, three years ago, when a man touched Theo without his consent in the pub, Neville was the one to notice and caught the man, Theo was touched at first. Then it was the little things Neville did, and at one moment, Theo realised his heart beat faster when Neville came in a room, he started smiling more, wanting to be closer to Neville. But what did he receive? Nothing. Theo wasn’t a quitter, of course, he chased after Neville. It started to get disappointing after a while when all Neville did was…well, he didn’t even do anything.
Draco chuckled, putting a lock of hair behind his ear, his cheeks blushed a bit “It’s fine, and for
“It’s fine by the way” Hermione comforted them and they led Hugh away, leaving Harry grinning and Draco blushing red, he figured the might have known why they got out early. Neville and Theo quickly ran to the water along with Ginny and Luna and their kids, Blaise sat on the chair nearby to tie Ariel’s hair up while Ron came to them
“No, it’s alright, go”
“Are you going to fuck me in the Great Hall?” Draco asked, pressing his lips in a thin line. Harry and him have fucked in a lot of places, but to do it in Hogwarts, it was definitely something else, a

“Oh, if so” Harry swallowed and continued, he better let it all out before Draco left again, he was a Gryffindor after all, he could say it, he could
“I really have to go, it’s late” He said, putting all this things in his bag, but when he tried to grab his book, Harry slammed his hand on it “Potter”

I cannot believe we’re leaving Hogwarts tomorrow” Pansy smacked his arm and squealed loudly, the graduation ceremony had just finished, and everything went well. Draco wasn’t quite himself yet, he couldn’t sleep much the night before, he couldn’t stop thinking about Harry “Hey, what’s wrong with you?”
“You got my back?” He asked, he couldn’t believe Weasley could actually say that he’d kick his best friend’s arse for him
“Corporate with me, alright? I don’t wanna embarrass myself in front of him” He whispered to the dragon and she just let out a small blue fire from her mouth, he will take that as a ‘yes’ then.
” Draco squeaked when his back hit the soft bed
and Luna’s shirt just said
“Thank you” He said, shuddering a bit when Harry applied the soap on his back, from the nape of his neck down to the small of his back. He felt Harry’s hands from his feet up to his thighs and stopped there again. Draco turned around and looked up at Harry, who was standing again.
“And you need to stop smoking” Ron murmured
“Well, I guess we’ll go now” Hermione smiled and stood up, dragging Pansy with her. And then, there was only the two of them…
Pansy shrieked “
“That’s brilliant, so it’s at my house, Number 12, Grimmauld Place, you can Floo in or Apparate there, the party starts at 9 and last until after midnight”
“You love me”
“So, one minute until midnight” Potter spoke first after they spent a minute just staring at each other, his hands shoved in the pockets of his jeans, his way too green eyes staring into Draco’s soul, he wasn’t sure what to say. Were they really going to kiss? “
that’s it”
Draco laughed, holding Harry’s hand tightly and they both sped up. It seemed like at this moment, Draco knew he would keep being happy like this, as long as he has his family and friends, he’s got the whole world.
“Sorry, guys” Pansy said, wrapping her arm over Draco’s shoulder “Hugh’s staying at Hermione’s parents’ house today, they miss him. Eddie can stay in the office room in there, it’s just as cosy and child-friendly. Well, as long as Neville and Theo haven’t used it as their own room”
you have to stay tonight” She nagged, swinging his arm and sticking her face up to his ear “We all promise to go back home at the same time, you can’t leave, Theo will leave for France soon and Blaise is going to be busy studying about photography”
” He said, tilting his head to the side and licked a line up Harry’s length, when he reached the head, the blond poked his tongue out to licked all the precome that kept coming, he soon enveloped the Auor’s whole length, making Harry grunted and his head fell back to the bed, Draco knew how to work his tongue. Harry looked at Draco again, watching him bobbing his head up and down, his hands on Harry’s thighs, sliding up slowly. Every time Draco went down on him, he went deeper and swirled his tongue around, hollowing his cheeks and kept his eyes locked with Harry.
“Alright, under those circumstances, I will…let you be my boyfriend” Ron said “If you failed any of those, I’ll—…”
” Draco gasped, tears forming around his eyes as he stood up as well, extending his hand. Harry pulled the ring from the box and put it in Draco’s finger, it fits perfectly. The blond bent down and they met halfway for a hug, Harry has never felt so happy in his life.
“What’s wrong?” Hermione asked “Did something happen?”
“Where’s my Chocolate Frog?” The question made Draco’s stomach do a flip. He could feel the chocolates in his pocket, but Potter wasn’t a kid “Like the kid from before, you gave her one”
“I’m ready, Daddy,” he whispers.
Harry snickers, and Draco lets out a few soft laughs of his own, so Harry knows he’s not upset in any way that matters. Harry thrusts his fingers inside, firm and insistent, fingers pressing over the swollen nub inside. Draco’s laugh peters off into a throaty cry. By now, he knows not to hide his face in pillows, lest Harry snatched them away, and it’s satisfying to hear those desperate sounds again. Weeks with only his hands and memory for company in some noble’s cold castle had nothing on this.
Another man upends the entirety of a velvet coin pouch he pulls from his pockets into the bucket in support of Watcher, to much playful fanfare. Draco huffs again. Pettigrew refuses to add to the pot, and Harry shakes his head as well. Next to them, Edmonton adds a ridiculous amount, and Draco gives Harry the driest look he’s ever seen.
, and then bundles Draco close, who wiggles around until his back is facing Harry’s front.
Dad slings an arm around Scorpius’ shoulders. Scorpius leans into the embrace. He doesn’t doubt it. He’s heard dad speak maybe four sentences about the people who raised him, but there are little things that make him wonder. The way he only uses the Floo for firecalls, if that. The way he hates bullies. The way he always talks to them like they’re equals. His protective spirit. The way he smiles when Father calls him names and kisses him anyway.
“Won’t you join me?” Draco asks.
“It’s fine, love,” Harry whispers back. He kisses the side of Draco’s mouth, which has begun to tremble.
If Al had to call anything in their family sacred, it’s the Christmas they have before beginning their rounds with family friends. Dad hadn’t had a real Christmas until he started Hogwarts, and Father’s had always been solemn little affairs marked with pomp and circumstance, save the private gifts Nan would give him when they had a moment alone. They sit by the tree and watch those awful old stop-motion animations that Father is so fascinated by, even the one where there’s a donkey with ears too long for its head.
“Answer me, Potter!”
“Oh! I--well, it seems rather inappropriate now that I think about it. I wanted to know if we could see some of the duels together at the colosseum.”
They all repeat this process many times. A group of raucous Junior Death Eaters chosen for the final charge make a game of kicking bodies aside and regaling each other with boastful stories of how they will aid the advance. Their cheer is dampened when a pair of skeletal hands shoot out of the ground and grip tightly to one of their legs.
there’s a rumour Potter and the Weasley girl are getting back together” She said, twirling her hair in her hands. Draco’s hands began to tremble, he woke up today thinking it would be a good day, he got to the Great Hall with a smile on his face, he ate peacefully, that was what happened, until Pansy spilled this horrendous thing to him. Harry and Ginny got back together? But how?
Draco widened his eyes and smiled brightly, he quickly pulled Harry in a hug
? It wasn’t his fault that he wanted to know what Potter was up to. He just has to know so he could get on Potter’s nerves. Was he too much? “You probably know him better than the Weasley girl”
“Percy wasn’t even interested in Quidditch, Harry, though he might be interested in a certain Quidditch player. And yes, they were dating back then, they are still dating” Draco said, leaning into Harry and couldn’t believe how oblivious his boyfriend was.
“Yeah, I’d be the depressed husband because my spouse doesn’t have any taste in fashion”
“Hey! I’m glad you could make it!” Hermione waved her hand high, calling Harry to their booth. It’s been another month, and of course Harry was still avoiding Draco. According to Pansy, Draco was still happy with Brandon, so Harry stepped back and let him be happy, after all, he wanted Draco to have the best. And even if it meant he’d have to look at Brandon and Draco together, he would, for Draco.
Ron unfortunately had to be on Draco’s side this time, he understood why he would react this way, since he was in the same situation years ago when he was dating Blaise. He didn’t think his parents would approve of someone like him, he was afraid their relationship would be forbidden if they found out he was letting another man’s dick in his arse. Turned out, he was wrong “So they solved it?”
” Potter said and Weasley stayed quiet with a guilty look on his face “We were j-…”
“Yeah, you were…to be honest, hot while doing it” Pansy added and her wife nodded along, she then nudged Hermione and began “Oh, hey, Potter, do you mind putting sunscreen on Draco’s back?”
“That’s why?” Draco asked and Pansy nodded, sighing deeply, he didn’t know Goldstein has a crush on him, he also didn’t know Potter could get jealous. He has definitely never seen this side of him before, at least not in his world “I thought he just really suck at Potions”
“So no one can get to Blaise?” Pansy spluttered but gasped when Ron only looked down “
“To be fair, we were staring too” Hermione said and Draco turned to looked at the girls
” Ginny gasped by pulled Luna up “Honey, honey, honey”
“Oh, sorry for the language, chop chop, everyone” She grinned and walked to Theo’s spot, murmuring something in his ear while he set up the wardrobe. Draco sat down on his small chair and casted a spell to make his makeup box go back to its normal size, since he had to shrink it before going here. He set the big box on the table and waited for Boot to come to his table
“Oh, er, you know I don’t mind you…er, you know” Harry uttered when he remembered what Pansy had told him
“As a matter of fact, yes, I do, I have to go see Headmistress McGonagall to discuss with her about a few things” She flipped her hair gracefully and closed her robes so she looked more decent for the meeting “I still can’t believe she chose me to talk to the others Houses about unity, like I care about that”
“Oh, honey” Pansy snickered and slapped his cheek softly “You need this” She said, grabbing a bottle of beer from the tray when a waiter walked by. She even hired a group of waiters, Harry shook his head and received the beer from her. She always liked to go out of the way to do things, it was either her way or the highway, which reminded him of someone he knew “Now, would you enjoy this party? Don’t make me pull Hermione here,
“I don’t know” She shrugged, eating her vegetables and continued “Someone from Gryffindor was talking about it, then Daphne overheard it. They saw Potter and the Weasley girl getting pretty close recently, they talk a lot, even getting in the library, we are not even studying anymore, they’re seen together many times. And look” She pointed her fork at the Gryffindor table as the students were still getting in the Great Hall “They’re even sitting next to each other today” Draco turned his head and looked at them, Harry and Ginny, sitting down right next to one another, with laughters on their face. His chest ached when he saw their shoulders touching, their head slightly leaned over to each other. He couldn’t believe they got back together.
“I wish”
He said, his voice shaking as he extended his hand so Harry can slip the ring into his finger. When their lips met, the old clock rang loudly, announcing that it was a new day now, Harry felt like he got his world in the palm of his hand as he was holding Draco in his arms, for Draco was his world.
Voldemort holds up a hand. With a quiet gasp, Draco falls silent, bowing his head.
“Done. I’ve been craving the fudge flies myself,” Draco tells her, with a little smile.
“I love my husband,” he gasps out, willing his awe not to steal his words. “That is a rarity for people of my blood. But I have an obligation, and I have not been able to meet it. I am a failure.”
“I can’t want a conversation with my best friend?”
Harry stills his restless movements with a guiding hand on his back, stroking his hair. “It wasn’t, though.”
Harry hums against him, and with a lazy sway of his hand vanishes his clothes. Sometimes he goes a little far with his charms--he can only hope that he’ll find them in a heap somewhere instead of blinked out of existence completely, because Draco will tease him relentlessly if they need to resort to transfiguring a flimsy set of replacements.
By the time he’s done, he’s trembling and kneeling over his work, either from blood loss or heat fever or both, but he’s still upright, and that’s all that matters. He stares down at the completed array, nervously comparing every aspect to the one in the book. For several long minutes, it seems as though nothing is going to happen. Feeling his eyes fill with tears, Draco reaches for the diary, only to cry out in shock at the sight of an eerie purple light filling the corner of his vision.
Draco has a thing, about doors.
a whore!” Pansy shrieks, once, around snickers of delight.
“I thought you were asleep,” Draco says, weakly.
Harry bites the inside of his cheek so harshly he can taste blood as the voyeurs recount what they remember of that night. Their audience is captive, with some lasciviously curious about Draco and others clearly fishing for details about Harry’s weaknesses. They’ve always taken his unwillingness to engage in conversation as a slight. Harry can see the younger Crabbe and Goyle shifting uncomfortably in their seats, nursing their drinks. He feels a stab of deep irritation at them. Will they not speak up for their friend?
Draco gives Harry a quick, worried look. “My lord, please--”
“Of course,” Draco says, drawing his shawl tighter around his shoulders.
“Ah, yes,” Lucius scoffs. “The Weasleys. Blood traitors all. It is no surprise the children are following in their parents’ footsteps.”
It’s clear in his face that he doesn’t believe what he’s been told. Harry, for the life of him, isn’t quite sure he does either.
“I killed someone,” Draco says.
“How would it work?” Draco asks, biting his lip.
“Yes, of course.”
With a bow, she pops away.
He balances himself with his hands on the grass on either side of Harry’s head, and begins a quick, rocking movement, heat polling dangerously in his belly each time each downwards press. Harry’s cock is grazing his prostate with each punishing snap of his hips, forcing him open. There’s a delicious burn growing in his thighs and lower belly. Draco’s fully aware that he’s babbling, but Harry never minds that.
Harry made it very clear that he wasn’t, under any circumstances, supposed to wait up for him when the meetings start. The first night is still difficult, especially after his long day. After a few hours of tossing and turning and pouting into his new plush toy, he gives up, throws one of Harry’s shirts on over his nightgown, and makes his way to the personal kitchen on their floor. He’s still unused to the Muggle contraption that is being used to store some of their food. He can’t even pronounce the thing and has been calling it the food box in his head. When he pulls its door open, he winces, surprised by the sudden burst of light. It’s powerful enough to illuminate this corner of the kitchen in a low glow, though, eliminating the need to fiddle with the switches on the wall. He pulls out some bread and cheese, and after a moment of consideration, a bottle of aged brandy. Then he leans over the aisle and picks at the snack.
“I’m sorry,” Draco says.
“English is a struggle for him,” Anezka says, smiling affectionately down at her white-knuckled hands. “He has to try very hard, and he doesn’t like feeling like he’s not in on the joke. So it’s just always been a rule. One day I saw some of our staff arguing being the most obnoxious muffliato and tried a counterspell. And they were so distracted that it came down, I suppose. They were fussing with each other about how they’d messed up their mission, and now how were they going to get info on the Death Eaters if they couldn’t get their man sponsored for the duels?”
“Another song, I should think, Lily Luna.” He suggests, like she’s there for their entertainment.
It’s as good of an answer as he’s going to get, Draco knows, so he does his best to hide his disappointment at the lack of certainty. He smiles and runs a hand through Harry’s messy hair, upsetting cowlicks and loose curls in one lazy stripe. He’ll have his luck cut out for him if this child inherits this mop.
Celebrated on the tail-end of Lammas celebrations in August, the Day of Victory commemorates the day the old Ministry fell to the Dark Lord’s power. The Dark Lord will invite guests to the Citadel to accept his blessings, or awards for good service. An award from the Dark Lord on this day is more cherished than any Order of Merlin.
“I was,” Harry replies shortly. He tugs Draco into the room and shuts the door behind him.
At her instruction, Harry helps him pull his robes up and lower his underwear. Draco holds onto his wrists with surprising strength, and when the Healer points her wand at the lights to dim them--playfully huffing and puffing about silly Europeans and their silly instruments--he lets out a trembling sigh.
“How about I try?” Daddy asks.
They are swiftly joined by Hilda, one of the head house elf cooks. She is eager to help and no doubt desperate to stop them from having sex on the aisle or in the pantry again, though she can’t know that the both of them are too shell-shocked to really be in danger in doing such a thing. She quickly puts a tray of neatly lined cookie dough in one of the ovens, smiling in triumph at the delighted smile that breaks out on Draco’s face--he could apparently smell the peanut butter in it. To Harry, it just looked like a bunch of plain dough. Pregnancy is strange.
“And that’s when the crows came,” Beauregard supplements.
From Lucius (on a gift labelled
He accepts the change in subject easily. “I… I’m afraid. I’m afraid the baby will be an Omega.”
As he was hoping, the nickname mollifies Harry into a sullen, attentive silence. Draco smiles despite himself. Harry always gets so proud when Draco calls him that. He takes his role so seriously.
They don’t finish the cake. The same house elf that walked in on them in this very kitchen all those months ago once again finds them half-naked and rutting on the aisle, with the mashed potatoes cold and the chicken burning in the oven.
“Is it not interesting enough between us already?” Harry whispers back, genuinely worried.
They’ve nicked each other during more rowdy duels, sure, but they’re always ready with a healing spell and quick to apologize. Healing of any kind is not allowed while contestants are in the ring. Each round is a war of attrition in its own right.
“Come here,” Harry says, holding his hands out.
“I saw him covering your eyes at the duels! That was precious.” Edmonton says, around a large smile.
“I won’t last,” He whimpers.
He gives them both kisses of greeting, and squeezes Lily into a warm hug, smelling as always of the slight ozone of heavy magic. He joins them for their card game, not even bothering to change out of his work robes, talking happily about his day. He and Aunt Andromeda have that same resting smile, that same kind but funny manner. How Grandfather could ever look at the two of them and see them as anything less than what they’re worth, Lily will never know.
It’s completely at odds with the way he chases Harry’s lips with drunken intensity, and the arm that’s curling around his waist hot like a brand, and the impressive erection pulsing in his hand. But Harry knows what it feels like, to be at war with himself. He gets it. Still, the sting of hurt rising in his throat tastes bitter. Some of it, at least, is familiar--Harry may be the world’s savior, but he does know that he’s nobody’s dream Omega. He’s too willful, too unconcerned with his looks. He’s got a horrible temper when it’s riled. He doesn't play ball. He likes that Draco meets him tit for tat, but he might be the only one. It takes all his willpower to let Draco go, to step back.
“Please, Daddy,” Draco says, pressing a kiss onto Harry’s neck. He smells so good it’s unfair.
Right up my alley! Thanks for the prompt!
“Mr. Thicknesse? Is everything alright?” He asks, shrinking back at the blank look on the man’s face.
“Sometimes,” Hermione replies. “I’m an alchemist’s assistant. We work on integrating Muggle technology with magic so they can be used in the home. Sometimes it’s necessary to use potions to smooth the process out because magic interacts so poorly with technology at first.”
Hermione hums her agreement. "He's just wonderful with her, Harry. If we ever need someone to watch Rosie when Molly's not around, be prepared for us to come knocking at your door."
“Not until you address me properly,” Sonja insists.
“Why? Do you not feel pretty?” Harry asks, raising a brow.
“Potter seems to have figured that out just fine,” Dolohov mutters, because of course he does.
“Clearly I worried more by being in the dark, Harry!”
And so, they retreat to the kitchens, both of them still bleary-eyed from the early morning and their talk. Harry settles on spanakopita for their main dish, both for its simplicity and as a way to indulge Draco’s growing craving for cheese.
He brought the family diary, mostly to have something to occupy himself. He’s mostly skimming, occasionally pausing to scoff and roll his eyes over especially ridiculous passages, before a charmed drawing of the moon cycle catches his attention. It’s drawn in loving detail and is so mesmerizing to look at that he stares at it for a little while in silence. He turns the page and blinks at the peculiar title before him.
“We’re just people. Muggleborns, too. Have I ever done anything to make you feel unsafe? Have me or the servants ever tried to suck the magic right out of you?” He teases softly, tugging on Draco’s hair.
“Caught you,” Harry whispers in his ear.
Despite the cramped space, it’s cozy and lovingly decorated. There’s a small couch and a little table for eating, outfitted with two peeling wooden chairs. Ron’s favorite shade of orange is littering the wall in random places and even on a knit blanket thrown over the back of the couch. The mantle of the small fireplace is littered with several moving photos. Harry recognizes some people, and feels a pang of sadness over the faces he doesn’t recognize. It hurts to know that they’ve made more friends, and love them enough to keep pictures of them, without Harry there to know about it.
“Can’t be serious--” “We met him twice and he called us
To his shame, Draco figures that Harry would--he can feel slick trailing down the inside of his thigh, lingering tackily on simple lace at the top of his stockings. He takes advantage of Harry’s turned back to put the diary in the tiny drawer of his bedside table, though he jumps what feels like several feet in the air as Harry squeezes his shoulders from behind.
“First, the people that did it. A few have stepped forward and claimed responsibility, but it’s obvious they had help. This was a planned, coordinated, and timed attack. The person who claimed to have put it all together is a man named Fred Weasley.”
“He doesn’t!” Draco insists. “We weren’t given a choice, Pansy, you know that. Yes, Harry takes care of me, but he’s just being a good provider. It’s more than I could have hoped for. I just have this feeling. I know next to nothing about him. What I
-Ritual self harm
Harry gives her a small smile. “Listen, I know I don’t have any right to ask this, but please don’t give up on Draco.”
This totally got away from me. Sorry, lovely! Hope you like it!
She nods slowly. “So you’re not reporting me to the Aurors?”
"Apparently," Draco mumbles, unable to tell if the heat in his cheeks is from embarrassment or anticipation.
“And you are how old?”
“Don’t you understand why I would want to help them, even a little bit? The way we live, we can't keep doing this. It isn’t right. Keeping slaves, breaking up families, invading other countries? What about your husband? He’s a Half-Blood. You love each other, you talk. I've seen you. Doesn’t he ever feel wrong? Like he doesn’t belong?” Anezka says, pressing her hands together.
Father’s reply arrives soon, directing him to the Leaky Cauldron in half an hour. They cuddle in contented silence until it’s time for him to leave. As he steps into the floo, he blows Harry a kiss, and the last thing he sees is Harry dramatically clutching it to his chest. He arrives in Diagon Alley laughing brightly.
Aunt Andromeda laughs. “That’s new. Lucius loves the sound of his own voice. I was wondering why he wasn’t responding to my letters.”
Harry is impatient enough to vanish his robes away without even reaching for his wand, which makes Draco sigh in appreciation. He gets to feel Harry's familiar magic enveloping him again as he apparates them straight onto their bed.
Draco gasps. “Why didn’t you tell me?”
“At first it was because it was difficult to talk about. Then I didn’t say anything because I didn’t want to worry you.”
First, I’d like to thank you guys for your support on my last note. I'm doing my best to keep going. Second, as I mentioned I was thinking of doing in the interlude, I’ve changed the summary. Hope it wasn’t confusing!
He bucks his hips, but he’s restricted by Harry’s firm hold. “Yes.”
Harry doesn’t need to ask who
Lily Potter was a tall, slender beauty, bluntly cut hair resting just under her shoulders. When she laughs, she throws her head back, eyes squeezed tightly shut. She twists ears and rolls her eyes and playfully tumbles with her friends and peers concentratedly down at books and wears wildly immodest clothes. She kisses Pettigrew’s cheeks and punches Sirius Black in the arm and piles books in the arms of a tired-looking young man--Moony, according to the playfully written notes--Draco doesn’t recognize. She and James dance, kiss, and shout over card games, young and breezy and plainly in love.
Like he’s read Harry’s thoughts, Draco rolls his eyes, throws a leg over Harry’s hip, and guides Harry’s head to his sternum. He purrs all the same at the wet kiss Harry presses to the curve of his right breast.
She shuffles over to him, and then kneels before him, the very picture of guilt. She reaches out to him, and he pushes her hands away with a disgusted noise. “
They catch their breath in an easy silence. Harry arranges them into a comfortable enough position, half on their backs and half on their sides, Draco throwing his head back to rest on Harry's chest. Every now and then, Harry grunts and rocks against him, filling him with more come. It's the most he's ever done this when they're tied, but heats are different.
“I did,” Harry answers. “I thought about… how you wake me up in the mornings to give me a kiss goodbye even though you hate mornings. I thought about how you cheat when we play wizard’s chest even though you don’t have to in the first place because I’m so bad at it. Hm, thought about kissing you a lot.”
“Mother!”
A year gone, and it feels difficult to imagine what his life was like beforehand. After actually seeing their baby, he doesn’t think he has the heart to deny Draco anything. He endures the ridiculous amounts of jewelers and parlors and clothes stores they sweep through. Draco’s grim, overdramatic logic is that he’d like to enjoy his body while he has the time.
Some of James’ fondest earliest memories are of Father tutting over that, reaching out to slap one pale hand against Dad’s when he messed up a cursive letter. “Stop it, I won’t have you making my children write like common fools,” he’d say, an amused dimple creasing his cheek despite himself at Dad’s grumbled complaints. Now, dad’s iconic print is a staple on all his products, something the wizarding world at large views with affection. The Boy Who Lived, ex-Auror and chef extraordinaire, equipped with possibly the world’s worst handwriting.
"Is that you saying you'll actually want to bond with me?" Draco asks, sitting up.
“Oh, love,” Harry sighs, rubbing his back. “Another nightmare?”
“And ’ll be with you every step of the way, sweetheart,” Harry adds. “Surely between the two of us we can scrounge up one competent parent.”
“I don’t want it. I don’t want any of it.” Theo replies.
It takes some doing, what with them being locked together and covered in a faint sheen of sweat, but eventually Draco is free, sighing as the cooling air hits his bare skin. Then Harry murmurs a few cleaning charms to make the wait a bit more comfortable.
"Please what, love?" Draco's not even looking at him. His silken hair is hiding his face as he stares down. Al slides one hand into it, and he pushes into the feeling with a low, rumbling purr, the sound filling him with a hint of smug satisfaction. No matter how Draco plays around with him, he can't hide what that sound means.
Then he nips the underside of Draco’s jaw, wrenching the most embarrassing, plaintive noise he’s ever made right out of his throat, and that just won’t do.
Hermione chuckles. “It’s good to hear you still do that.”
He’s still embroiled in these thoughts when Draco crawls back into bed and crawls over to him, trembling, his skin cold.
All in due time, Harry thinks, glancing over at Draco, who has cuddled up under his blanket in their companionable silence. Harry just hopes that, after everything that may happen, they will still have each other on the other end of it.
“Are you real Aurors?” He croaks.
“I want you to use this as an opportunity to study.” Harry says, once they’re a good distance away.
“Hey, hey,” Harry says, gently. “You alright?”
It takes him a while to notice that Harry has stopped stroking his hair. Draco always uses him as a living heat source on their TV days. Harry knows his duties well. He is not to move, and he is obligated to provide the maximum amount of affection. He lets out an affronted little noise and tilts his head up, resting his chin on Harry's chest, to see him better.
“Hello, Lily. Are you ready to share your wisdom with us?”
“Life isn’t always happy.” He’s learned that the hard way, recently. After a lingering silence, he adds, “You don’t ever have to tell me if you don’t want to.”
He goes on to tell her about other little incidents--about trying a cleaning charm on a spill and stripping the wood clean off the surface of a table, about the way the letters on books he’s reading start to dance if he stares for too long without processing anything, about the way the house staff has begun to announce themselves to him if only to avoid being badly stung for shocking him. He wants, more than anything, to mention that night with Mr. Thicknesse--that familiar purple light, and the smoke rising from pale skin. He hopes that the examples will serve as a fitting replacement.
Harry follows, making note of turns and restless paintings that peer down at him and mutter in Russian far too quick for him to even begin to understand. He’d interrupted half of Draco’s well-meaning lessons by kissing him until he was smiley and unfocused. He’s still muttering landmarks to himself when Bolotin stops by a deep blue door with gold embellishments.
Draco finally lifts his head from his pillow. The eyes in question look sad, though they do brighten a bit when Draco reaches up to run a hand over Harry’s shoulder in comfort. He continues.
For one, the streets are lined with vendors and entertainers, peddling wares and basic magic tricks for children. The frost Draco saw fall last night has mostly melted, darkening the pavement and sending excitable youths slipping and skidding each time they start running. Harry is amused by the restaurants in particular—almost all of them have propped their doors open to display samples for groups walking along. They try their first round of samples, and Draco finds himself abruptly and desperately hungry. They needn’t worry about the light breakfast they had, because they fill up on tarts and scones and tiny glasses of drink. Draco lingers for seconds more than once. Thankfully, Harry interprets his enthusiasm as holiday spirit and eats just as much as he does.
He thinks about mentioning the body-binding curse, but he can’t bring himself to do it. If some reporter saw it and wrote something up about it, Harry will find out anyway.
“Arms up,” Harry orders, humming in approval when Draco complies. His outer robes are pulled off in short order, lying haphazardly on the floor, leaving him only in his beige chemise, underwear, and plain stockings.
There are no words between them for a few moments, only harsh breaths and Draco’s fucked out giggles, which only quiet as Harry maneuvers him properly onto his side.
“No, you don’t know because you left in a hurry and have made every effort to make yourself scarce ever since,” Father corrects, harshly. “I had to apologize on your behalf.”
“I was just joking,” Bellatrix hisses back, though she quickly subsides back into her chair when Voldemort gives her a look of warning.
The fat head of Harry’s cock pops past his rim, loose from several rounds of vigorous fucking. Harry slides in on one smooth thrust, his thumbs rubbing over the dimples in Draco’s lower back. He doesn’t move until Draco is squirming, and then, he only does moves to give himself space to bring his hand down on Draco’s arse, the crack resounding in his ears. Draco whimpers, his back bowing. Harry’s given him love taps and playful swats before, but never anything quite like that before.
It always feels so tender, when he’s on top. He shudders and works himself back inch by hesitant inch. He stops, trying to catch his breath, but Harry smacks his arse and he hiccups, seats himself fully.
Silence. Then, “The Egyptian Ministry has a collection, in their house of government. It’s covered floor to ceiling with some of their, er, less cursed cultural artifacts. It’s lined with mirrors and the lights are all down low, so you can really appreciate it all. It’s got enchanted statues, amulets, books of spells you can’t even use anymore because barely anyone can read the language anymore and the magic’s so old… that sort of thing. Half of Egypt’s magical history all in one room.”
To his surprise, Lucius gives him a half smile. “A clever person might call it… compartmentalization.”
“Yeah, and you said something about the mirror, right?” Harry said and Draco nodded “And you said we hate each other there, in your universe, but you saw us kissing in the mirror”
, Pansy”
He moaned, hands grazing over the tattoo and sliding up Harry’s face “Look at this” He placed a hand on his lower abdomen, breathing heavily at Harry “This is you inside me, I can feel you, so deep, so full in me” Harry’s eyes widened, staring at him in awe “It’s getting big—

“Yeah” He turned to look at the door and wondered who it could be, their friends would just Floo in, or they’d walk in like their own house. Pansy got off her seat and walked to open the door
“Draco, would you mind taking care of the hospital wing for me for a while? I have to go see Minnie” Madam Pomfrey placed her hand on his shoulder, and he gave her a curt nod before she walked out.
“How could I not?” Draco exhaled when he remembered the night “We had dinner at the rooftop of our building, I kissed you when you complimented my eyes when we were looking at the moon”
“Thank you for…you know, doing all of that” Draco said into his wine glass after they finished their meal, it was quite a while, they watched the sunset together and it was a good experience, because Potter didn’t say anything, that’s why it was peaceful, Draco watched as Pansy stood up and grabbed Hermione’s hand, they both ran out to the beach in their bare feet while laughing
convinced Draco to compromise?”
don’t tell me—…”
Pansy groaned loudly, making Draco chuckled. Who would have known that trait of Hermione was what made Pansy fall for her “What’s the matter with you? Did you hit your head again?”
want to go out with me?”
” He said, pushing Harry back and smiled at the man “Let me do something to make up for it”
“I just have one thing to say” Draco said quietly, leaning down to talk to Theodore “Whatever you do, don’t hurt him, he’s a nice guy”
“Wow, can’t believe your skin is so dry” Draco replied.

“Oh, Draco, do you want more cocoa?” She turned around and looked at him gently in her apron.

Draco asked worriedly while Hermione was already pulling her wand out but Ginny stopped her
it’s still the same” Draco walked in with his hand locked with Harry’s, as they entered the Room of Requirement once again. The Mirror of Erised was there, it looked exactly the same, but without the crack, just like a new mirror.
“Sure, Malfoy, what do you want to talk about?” She said, smiling while putting on her shoes. He took a deep breath and looked at her
“We were friends since 6
! I know what you’re going to choose, Draco! Cormac is a gross shithead, you despise Celeste, and Harry’s the only one left, he’s not all bad, right?”
“Hey, you’re good to go” Draco turned his head to see Ron standing next to him, the redhead waved his hand, gesturing for Smith to leave “Go, you’re up” He said, and Smith glared at him before leaving the chair
“No, no” Potter said, looking at the blond and stuttered the next few words out “Er, it’s your hand, it’s cold”
“Well,
“Another time?” Draco grinned, extending his hand as Ron squinted his eyes again, it was a risky move, he didn’t expect Ron to shake his hand.
like each other, but they can’t see it, every Auror is placing wager to see
” Draco yelled and quickly put his short black silk night robes on, he barely has his boxer on after his shower, Pansy said she’d be here with clothes so he didn’t put on any proper shirt, he obviously didn’t really expect to see Potter standing in front of his door while he’s in his robes, and the robes barely covered his thighs “
“Well, you should, Hermione and Rose and I are in front of his place now, he called me earlier and cried—
“Really?”
“How do you know that?” He turned the question back to Harry because it was true, Draco rarely ever got the flu, he always took care of himself
“How do you know that’s happened before?” She halted and gave him a look, Draco froze there, he couldn’t believe he let that slipped
“What else? Does he have something to make himself invisible?”
“Only two” She whispered, holding up six fingers, her face was totally red now
“That’s interesting” Draco hummed, she could spend more time with Hermione then, she seemed to need it “Blaise, what about you? Don’t you tutor Ron today?”
“So why do you care?”
“I guess I always have been” Draco shrugged, his grey eyes shimmering and Harry felt like his life-long dream has actually came true “After a few months of living with you, maybe half a year after, I realised that. Don’t you remember? That’s when I started walking around the house in my short robes. And I thought it didn’t work, you weren’t turned on by it”
Ron squeaked, his hand clutching on Blaise’s robes “
“I’m sorry I left” Draco said, catching Harry’s attention again as he looked into the pair of grey eyes “I…I was supposed to leave the next day, and, I…I never intended to meet you, well, I did hope I got to see you one last time, but I didn’t expect to do it with you”
“I’m gay” He blurted out “I don’t want you to feel uncomfortable, and it’s the decent thing to do” He turned around when there was complete silence behind him. Potter was done, but he was staring at Draco “What? I’m not embarrassed about my sexuality”
“Oh, honey” Pansy cooed, her lips formed into a pout “He doesn’t have a clue”
“I mean I did think about sleeping alone,
“We?” Blaise arched an eyebrow at her
” His toes curled and he was already feeling his orgasm coming close, with Harry ramming at the right spot and his hand jerking Draco, the blond couldn’t take it any longer
“Oh, it’s done, I solved it last week” Harry said, turning around when a person tapped on his back
“Uncle George told me how to do it” Rose said innocently “Are you mad at me?”
“Fair point” He said before walking away. He knew Blaise, the guy was so patient, too patient if he was being honest. If he could help Pansy pass her tests, helping Ron would be no big deal to him. Draco walked in Charms class and sat down next to Pansy, who was huffing and grunting with Daphne on the next table
. And everyone was there, guys, girls, handing out chocolates to their crushes, Draco didn’t want to admit it, but he kind of made a box too, for someone he liked, for a while now, but it was after dinner now, and he still hasn’t done it.
“I did too” Pansy said “You know, Draco, you and Harry have a long history”
“Oh, Ginny and Luna are busy, Nev and Theo are traveling, Rose is with Blaise and Ron” Hermione replied, Harry sat down next to her in the round table and picked up the menu. They decided to have lunch since they always have to meet at least for one meal a week to bond, pub nights didn’t count, according to Pansy “Pansy’s in the lady’s room”
” Ron stepped back when Draco pointed at him, he immediately hid behind his tall husband and pulled Blaise backwards. Draco looked back at Harry again and huffed out a small laugh, it was
” He purred, feeling Harry’s finger circling his wet rim “Show me how it feels, Harry-
She stared at the two Aurors, and Draco was sure he learned something from this sight, it was that Hermione’s a scary woman, and everyone should be afraid of her. He watched as Ron and Harry looked down before switching their places, Draco moved to his left to put in some space between them when Harry sat down, he couldn’t bear to be close to Harry right now. Draco couldn’t help but smile when he saw how shy Ron was right now, sitting right next to Blaise, their shoulders touching.
“You know, you could
“Hey, studying?”
“That’s what I hope” Draco shrugged, as much as he didn’t care about Ernie, Terrence could be good for the clumsy Hufflepuff. Harry pulled on his lower lip with his teeth, making Draco wonder what the Gryffindor was thinking about “Harry, what’s wrong with you, why are you acting weird?”
“We will sit at that table next to you” Hermione said “We already ordered for you”
“It was the night I accidentally proposed to him four years ago, this happened after that, we joked around, he called me an idiot, I teased him back, he blushed for five minutes straight” Harry smiled, shoving his ring back under his shirt “It’s the moment I felt something towards him, or realised I felt something towards him, then I told you guys and Pansy smacked me for
“Well then, you better do something to deal with this” Ron suggested, he still hasn’t started working on his file yet and still munching on the sweets on his table “Maybe try dating? I’m sure Pansy knows a lot of people. You can ask if she knows anyone with blond hair”
“I can’t, I have nothing to wear” Draco said, most of the clothes he bought recently were all work robes and those wouldn’t be suitable for parties, and all his parties robes were all old and he hasn’t worn it for five years, plus he was twenty five, he might have grown out of his old robes now.
“Fine, I’m going to find Blaise and tell him you’re fine”
“It’s cute how you think Weasley would know about it too, you two are alike” Draco said, he didn’t know what else to say, so he extended his hand in the space between them, speaking up quietly “I only let the guy I like hold my hand, Harry”
“I do not need to know that, Ron” He laughed quietly and sighed again, he sometimes still thought about it, about the fact that Draco moved to Paris to become a Healer there. Sometimes he woke up with sweats on his forehead and a bulge under his boxer, because he dreamt about that night again. It was so memorable that he could not forget how it felt, how he felt when he was inside Draco, the way his body writhed and the sound he made underneath Harry, how they managed to do it multiple times a night until both of them fell asleep, or perhaps he was the only one that really slept.
“Er, it’s all right, you can keep it”
world, which made the whole thing even more complicated.
“You are a good one” Potter said, Draco didn’t turn to look at him. He didn’t want to see how the Gryffindor’s green eyes were gluing at him. He was afraid it would be bad for his heart “If you become a Healer, does that mean I can see you every day again at St. Mungo’s?”
“It’s alright, we can do this tomorrow”
He moaned the words out loud, and just like Draco demanded, Harry was angling his cock at his entrance, pushing in quickly without any difficulty. After all, Draco has been used to Harry’s size for years now, he even felt empty without it. The ecstasy he was always engulfed with whenever he was filled up by Harry, embraced by his love, it was like no other. Draco had concluded after the first time they fucked, it was the best feeling in the world, well, except when Harry proposed to him, or on their wedding day, but that was a whole different situation
“Which is…”
“Draco, are you still here?” Madam Pomfrey approached him with a hand on his shoulder, she joined him on the empty bed and squeezed his shoulder “You know, dear, you can go back to your dorm, no one will be here anyway”
(See the end of the chapter for
way” Pansy said, pointing at the other side of the mall “See Hermione there? From across the mall? She came to pick me up for our date and I sent her the picture when you asked me and she just told me the guy is her friend, Harry, then she saw you and
to give speeches at the Ministry, the only suit he has.
” Draco flinched at the screaming person behind him, he spun around to see a tall man covering his eyes while crouching down “
“You don’t know? The crowd there, you see?” Hermione pointed to the crowd of female students “Harry is, well, in there”
“Er, no” Potter answered and Draco exhaled in relief, the Gryffindor didn’t have a concussion, that was better. The blond took a deep breath before pulling out his wand to heal the injury on his head “Take off your robes” Draco said and Potter slowly opened his robes, flinching at his moves and Draco has to take over “Stop, sit still, I will do it” He ordered, pulling the robes off entirely and his scarf as well. He still has a layer of shirt left, Draco placed his hand on his forearm, Potter didn’t react, he moved his hand up to his upper arm and Potter’s face scrunched up a little, he traced up and earned a hiss from Potter when he touched his shoulder blade “I need to take off your shirt”
“Everyone likes you” He said, implying what he wanted to “Everyone”
“But Blaise—…”
“I never thought of it that way” Potter hummed quietly “I was sceptical at first”

“I’m not”
we’d be together too. But perhaps I’m wrong, maybe I’m just in love with the version of you in that world”
“I knew it” The girl smiled again and put her hand on Potter’s shoulder “So, my friends over there all have partners for the candy making class, I was wondering if you’d want to be my partner? For the class?” She pointed to her group of friends standing near there
“Really?”
“Why would I be mad, darling?” His mother said softly with a smile “Harry, dear, come in, you don’t need to hide anymore” She said quietly as Draco widened his eyes, glancing at his boyfriend and Harry stepped into their view.
“A little lower, yes,
“I don’t think they’d come here any second now” Harry said, pushing another finger inside Draco, they were sitting near the shallow water, with the waves hitting them every few seconds, Draco was sitting on Harry’s lap, wrapping his legs around his husband, pushing himself back into his fingers. The catch they had to agree was that they let everyone join as well, they didn’t have a problem with it at first, but now Draco was starting to think maybe they should have gone somewhere alone “If you don’t want it, I’ll stop”
“I don’t tell lies, trust me on that” He said as Ron made another move on the chess board “Blaise rarely care about anyone other than himself, I’ve never seen him looking after people before, I’m surprised as well. I’m just saying, there’s more to him than you know, maybe you’d like to know”
“Don’t say anything” Narcissa said, looking at Lucius, who was still trying to look calm “We’ll see you two at the wedding”
to have a motorcycle helmet?”
“So, darling” She smiled at him reassuringly “Every relationship has its ups and downs, and I may sound like Hermione right now, but even I know it’s true, and I

“So…you want to be alone…but
“Oh no, I’m not staying”
know”
“Oh, the Eiffel Tower”
oh no!” He denied, maybe he should just confess “I just…I was just…burning things. How-how did you know there was a fire?”
“If the meeting isn’t
“What if I don’t?”
“Er, I will…Malfoy, I choose Malfoy”
“Do you want a drink?” Luna said while her hand was already handing him the drink,
“Hey, I already created this whole thing, I don’t wanna clean it” She huffed, kicking his leg playfully “But anyway, to show her that I’m responsible, like you suggested, I agreed. But what’s up with Blaise? Does he like Weasley or something?”
“Let me see, may I?”
“I don’t have any clothes” Draco said softly and Potter looked up at him quickly before rushing to his trunk and trying to find something
“Good?”
is just a bit of a coward to act on it” Harry sighed at his best friend, he understood how Ron was reacting, he did even sometimes think of himself as a coward too, he lived with Draco every day and he still couldn’t say the three simple words to him.
“Okay, so you go grab a mask, a pretty one” Pansy pointed at Ron and he nodded, it was the least he could do since he failed the only thing he was assigned to, which he still felt guilty for “I’ll call them, see if I can persuade them or not”
” Draco nodded, crying out and wrapped his arm around Harry’s neck, pressing his face against Harry’s cheek “
“I don’t know. Do you think uncle Draco and I look good together?”
“Oh, you’re here” Hermione walked in the Common Room, she clearly looked upset, but he wasn’t sure why “Hi, Malfoy”
“I don’t have my wand” Potter said and Draco glanced at his left hand, sending daggering looks back at the Gryffindor.
” Draco exclaimed “I
“Well…” Pansy tilted her head “I kind of walked in on him in his bathroom, well, he was showering and I was in a rush so I just barged in and…the rest is history”
“Don’t throw up”
“Hey, fellas?” Pansy waved at them “We’re going to head back to our suites”
” Draco murmured “
“Draco…”
you’re never driving again” Pansy spoke this time and Draco was pushed out of the car door
Parkinson, we have to hurry, I can’t do this alone, we have a system” She said, as Pansy widened her eyes at Draco, telling him
“Er…”
Harry murmured into his ear “
“Fine, fine” Draco pushed Potter’s shoulder gently with his hand and took off his shirt and trousers, leaving his black boxer back, he wasn’t going to make his clothes wet. Draco took a deep breath and dived into the water, the water was really fucking incredible, the girls were right, he felt at ease under the water. Draco rose above the water and smiled brightly, he looked at Potter, who was staring at him with weird eyes
had sex”
“I will. Do you think I can’t? Do you think a woman like me can’t blow this place up to protect my wife? Do you?
“We agree with that” Pansy hummed “It’s really good, but I mean you obviously know that, we eat at your place every Friday. Also, look around, this place is crowded with people”
“What do you mean? He told me he always carry a second quill”
birthday when Draco had knocked on his door with Pansy on his side, asking for a place to stay. It had only meant to be a week or two, somehow Draco had managed to stay in Harry’s place ever since, and his heart too. Pansy was the one who insisted Harry to let him stay, along with Hermione, with them being a married couple and all, Harry couldn’t find a way to decline the girls’ offer.
because you’re mad at Draco” Pansy said, receiving the bag from his hand “This has gone way too extreme, you two need to fix it”
Ron glared at Harry, who was smiling at him
“No” He turned Harry down and sat down, putting his brushes back in the box “Just go and change your outfit” After hearing a sigh from Harry, Draco eventually looked up when he left, glancing at Theo’s spot, his friend was putting on…
Ron could hear Draco yelling at someone from outside, he bit on his lips tightly and hoped they didn’t notice he was here with Blaise “What the hell is wrong with you?”
Pansy sat up, her eyes gleaming brightly when an idea popped into her head, a
” Harry exclaimed and Draco stopped, he was kneeling on his knees under the table, his hands on Harry’s knees and his mouth on Harry’s cock, wishing Ginny didn’t notice it
“He’s just too kind for his own good”
“What are you doing?”
“So, what was code red today?” Pansy asked, pulling Ron out of his thoughts
“I’m leaving” He walked away but Pansy grabbed his wrist and pulled him back “
“Nothing” Pansy said, drawing circles with her finger on the table “If what Luna said is true, then do you think in another universe, we’d still be together?” Draco looked at Potter, who was discussing Quidditch with Weasley, not listening to a thing Pansy was talking about
His voice weakened, he couldn’t say anything as Harry slipped the ring into his finger, there was something tightening in his heart. He didn’t know what to do, Draco bit on his lower lip and extended his hand
“Is something wrong?”
“What?”
” Draco covered his mouth with his hand “You…you two were
”I’m really not” Hermione shrugged, standing her ground, she wasn’t wrong, everyone knew Harry wanted to kiss Draco
want that to happen. Instead of confessing, he decided to keep his feelings somewhere deep in his heart and all his friends have to help him do it “
My laptop crashed when I was writing this and chapter 6, so I lost those two chapters completely and had to rewrite it, well, it was one hell of an experience
Pansy gasped, looking up at Harry and Draco as they stopped on their tracks, her eyes filled with horror “
!” As soon as Pansy finished her sentence with a sob, Harry met Draco halfway for a kiss, the room burst into a series of applause and cheers from their families and friends. At last, they were
“Yeah”
Potter laughed as he wiped his face with his hand “You’re mean”
“You could have just said he’s married to me” Pansy suggested
“I don’t
“Really?”
“Helping Ron with his homework in the
” He said loudly with a grin “
“I don’t get it, you know, so you tell him you love him. What’s the worst that could happen?”
“Poor, poor child” Pansy murmured
Everything aside from that was normal, they were going through a lot of tests, everyone was studying hard, no one suspected their relationship, and Pansy, of course, was still nagging him to tell Potter what happened. Draco continued eating, knowing Pansy was probably glaring at him right now, wondering why he just snapped at Potter.
Pansy gasped, slamming her hands down on the kitchen counter “Mione, did you hear that? They did it
again
“Well, after the war, your family is the only left that didn’t become Death Eaters” Draco said, pointing out the truth, Blaise also didn’t become a Death Eater, but he refused the spot and replaced himself with Pansy. Recently, McGonagall had called in four people from each House to have a serious meeting about House Unity, though Draco wasn’t sure what it was about, he only knew Pansy was one of them, along with Granger from Gryffindor, Padma Patil from Ravenclaw and Hannah Abbott from Hufflepuff “And I guessed she chose all the Prefects”
the cuddling, however, now he could not sleep
, and walked out of the room, leaving Draco there like a schoolgirl who’s just been invited to a party by her crush
“You are” He flinched and turned around to see Ginny with a smirk on her face, her arms folding in front of her chest as she stood next to Luna “Hey, blondie”
going to date someone that looks like Draco, Ron” Harry glared at his best friend, it wasn’t like he didn’t try. He had spotted many people with gorgeous blond hair and figures like Draco, but none of them made him feel the way Draco did, that warm feeling in his chest and the urge to be next to Draco all the time “I’ll deal with it myself”
“I cannot believe you’d ask Draco to marry you” Hermione spoke finally, she sighed, patting Harry’s shoulder “Why didn’t you do it?”
“You know well enough by now that I did this on purpose” She said, glancing at him and smirking “You’re smart, Draco, you know that”
“I’m sorry” He said, looking down when they were walking back home. The night was a disaster, he was supposed to propose to Draco, it was supposed to start as a romantic dinner, then he’d put the ring in the dessert Draco ate, and he’d say his speech he’s been practicing for the past two weeks to Draco, and got engaged to him. Unfortunately, the night turned into a mess when he accidentally forgot the
“I know”
again” Harry laughed, his best mate was wearing a formal red robes, it seemed like he was going to one of those fancy parties he always went with Blaise again “What’s the occasion?”
“You thought I was fat?”
“What’s wrong, Draco? Sit down?” Blaise asked him, with Ron sitting next to him in Auror uniform, Blaise was holding a cigarette in his hand
Pansy squeaked, he could hear the desperation in her voice, as if he wasn’t just as disappointed as her “Never mind, I heard what I said.
“Where did you get this?” He held her hand and asked. How could she possibly find this?
Potter held Draco back by his waist to prevent him from charging at the other guy, his back was flushed against Potter’s rock hard chest “
” He pointed at the girls. Pansy was wearing her red pantsuit again, with a gold pendant on her neck that he hasn’t seen her wearing for months now
“Alright, I won’t smoke” Blaise nodded “Never smoke ever again”
knows. So during the war, some people Polyjuiced into Harry to, you know, a kind of distraction. And…who was in it? I remember you, Ron, Fleur…”
“I sent him the stuff” Pansy quickly replied, pulling the guy’s hand so he’d stand next to her “It’s an emergency and he doesn’t have any clothes for…this kind of thing so I had to sent him my old robes, which I had to go home and find”
much during sex, and yelled out his
“What?” Draco’s eyes widened and stopped walking when she spoke “Who told you that?”
“I said I was sorry, Granger” Pansy huffed out loud while sitting down on the floor, pushing books into the shelves
Malfoy narrows those glinting eyes at him, a teasing smirk on his face. "Only if you can make me loud, Black."
“Er, yeah,” Harry says. There is no point denying something someone as shrewd as Hermione has figured out.
It goes smoothly enough for the first few rounds of questions. Draco is tense but collected, answering as concisely as possible. It all takes a nosedive, of course, when Dolores Umbridge rises to her minuscule height and clears her throat. Harry can see Draco briefly wrinkle his nose.
Anezka is about to speak, but her father walks up behind her, clasps his hands over her shoulders, and begins speaking a language Harry’s untrained ears can only peg as Slavic. Anezka laughs, looking down at her hands as her face colors.
“What?”
“Should we let them have it?”
“Did it work?”
“Yeah, she wanted to surprise Hermione” Draco looked at the path filled with candles that led to their dinner table, there was even a violinist standing near there, prepared to fill the place with music
“Aren’t you late for your date?” Harry looked at the Muggle clock on the wall and tried to distract Draco “It’s almost eight, you should get ready, you haven’t even done your hair. I’ll go make some food then, are you hungry? I sure am. Maybe you can eat something light before you go, or not, I’ll just make—…”
say no”
Draco’s breath hitched, huffing out a small laugh. Harry bit his lower lip, trying to hold back from kissing Draco right now, the blond took a deep breath and began reading from the notes Hermione handed him “
“What if they aren’t happy together? What if Draco doesn’t really like Brandon? What if Brandon has a small dick?”
“What?” They both gasped in shock
“If you hurt him, I’ll
“...Welcome back” Ron mumbled, shooting the confetti in his hands along with Blaise, who kept a smirk on his face the whole time
“Sorry” Draco looked back at Harry and gave him a soft smile “My friend, she’s weird like that”
” Harry chuckled and kissed Draco right in the middle of the room
“I know” Draco smiled at him as Harry leaned into his touch “It still pisses me off, and I finally understand how you felt back then, and I want to tell you that…I’m ready. I’m ready to show the world that I’m in love with Harry Potter” He leaned closer and stood on his tiptoes and kissed Harry on his lips “I’m still in love with you”
makes my heart skips a beat. The person I didn’t dare confess my feelings because I was afraid he’d leave, the person that’s going on a date tonight
, you are my first, and my last in everything. And this is one of the happiest days of my life, to stand before you and tell you that I don’t love you from the first time we met, but I love you from all the moments after that, and I know from now on, I’ll always be happy, because I am with you. Even now, I still can’t believe I’m going to get married to you, my best friend, my soulmate, I have and I always will love you”
be our thing, Harry” He said, placing his hand on Harry’s, the Auror’s heart threatened to leap out of his chest, Harry quickly retreated his hand and rested it on his thighs, he noticed Draco’s eyes on him, but he didn’t know what to do, Draco’s in a relationship now, he won’t be able to do things he has always been doing with Draco, not anymore.
“What’s next?”
“Are you sure?”
Draco stayed quiet after hearing Potter’s words, he might feel the same thing, the blond diverted his eyes and cleared his throat “You can go”
the other day I was discussing the party with Granger in the Gryffindor Common Room, and Weasley got in, a few minutes later, she was dragging Potter out of there in a rush” Draco balled his hands into fists and closed his eyes, maybe he expected too much of this insane plan of his to succeed, now that it had failed, he couldn’t bear the disappointment.
“It’s beautiful” Draco looked up at the sky and smiled “The stars are so beautiful” They were sitting on the beach after dinner, the waves hitting their bare feet softly and the wind flowing through their hair, Draco felt at ease more than ever. Hermione and Pansy were sitting a few feet from them, whispering something together. Potter was sitting on his left, gazing at the sky as well, it was like Eighth Year again, just the two of them next to each other
“You girls are weird” Draco said and Harry chuckled, pulling Draco to his lap in a swift move and wrapped his arms around Draco
“I’m flattered” Draco glowered at the Auror “Hawaii hates me”
well, kind of, when we were in your Manor, when you didn’t identify him. I think, some parts of you wanted us to win, wanted Harry to stay alive and win” With everything Hermione was saying, Draco found himself facing the truth…he has always been all over Potter from the start “And after that, do you remember the trial?”
“Absolutely”
Draco grew his hair out, and the look suited him well.
“Harry, I can’t, I have all these books to organise, we almost finished it yesterday but…” She said, looking at Pansy with a glare “
“Draco, what are you doing?” Potter stood up, rubbing his back and looking at him with sleepy eyes.
“Yeah”
“Well, it’s not much, but, does Blaise, er, has he ever bought things for you?” He asked, fidgeting with his fingers, he was nervous, Draco could tell “Like food, stuff”
“That’s unfair” Potter said, he could sense the teasing tone from his voice, but he didn’t care. Potter got off the bed and waved at him before turning to leave. Somehow Draco had acted on impulse and grabbed his robes by his sleeve, drawing his attention back to him.
“You did this?”
“Yes, thank you, Molly” He said politely and watched her pour out the hot cocoa into his cup. She stopped after placing a few marshmallows in and walked out of the kitchen.
“Good night” Draco replied under his breath. He wasn’t sure how he’s going to act tomorrow around Potter, but he still has to face it and he will face it like the brave Auror he was
” Draco yelped when Hannah appeared at the door of the bathroom, she was Pansy and Hermione’s little girl, named after the same girl who helped Pansy and Hermione got together and the owner of the pub that Draco ran into Harry seven years ago, she also had brown hair and was holding a Monster High doll in her hand “What are you doing here?”
“I don’t know” He replied, he really didn’t know, he didn’t know what Harry felt about him too, that was why he’s so frustrated “You either choose to trust him, to trust your feelings, or don’t”
“I’m nervous, I can’t believe we’re an hour late because of you”
“What’s that supposed to mean?”
I got the chance to see you, everyone was…crowding me today so I didn’t get to give you this, but now I have, and I was about to do it, but…you did it anyway” Potter snorted “Ron said he’d lock you and I in a room if I delay this any longer”
“Are you okay, sir?” Draco asked when the man didn’t stop covering his eyes, the blond noticed he was holding his glasses in one hand, so Draco couldn’t have sprayed him
“I do” Harry said without a doubt, he could be uncertain about a lot of things, but not this.
for him, like Hermione and Pansy said, he didn’t know why, or how, he just…
fight that made Blaise fall for Ron, because he wasn’t like anyone he had met before, He put up a fight and Blaise apparently dig that
” Rose shrilled, tears started to form around the rim of her eyes “
“Like, I’ve never spin you around in my arms”
“Not until Potter brings me my sunscreen” Draco huffed and looked around, there were quite a lot of people here, all of them were wizards, Blaise built these hotels and resorts so wizards and witches could still use magic without being caught by Muggles. He glanced at the girls, they seemed to be relaxed, even though they should be cautious, but Draco wouldn’t want them to celebrate their anniversary in fear either, he sighed and closed his eyes
He’s like the guy Harry dislikes most here, because he likes you”
“They…are perfect” Potter said after a while “To me, they are”
“Oh, well” Brandon replied slowly “I’d say saving the Minister, I still have a scar on my back”
“Now that you have the sunscreen, would you put the umbrella away?” Hermione asked
“You’re more adorable” Harry teased him, pinching his cheek and leaning close to kiss his wet lips “Do you want to put it on?”
” Pansy shrieked and pulled him to her by his collar “Don’t you lie to me, Draco Lucius Malfoy”
“Draco and his…
“Can’t, have a date” Draco said. He obviously lied, he just has to find a way to avoid Harry at all costs
“The mirror still works” He pointed at Draco, who stopped walking the moment he spoke up “You said it was broken”
“Why don’t we just sit with them?”
“Sod off, Pansy” Draco smiled and looked at the girls, Hermione was wearing a banana print swing dress while Pansy wore a bamboo orchid red maxi Hawaiian dress, it looked like they switched Houses
we should call you” Hermione added the lie and smiled brightly when Draco glared at both of them
“I cannot believe I just kissed you in there” He murmured, but Harry only pressed him against the wall “I just kissed you” He looked up at Harry, who was beaming at him under the light of the street, he was happy “What?”
“You’re still holding me”
“Er, how much of that did you hear?
Seamus yelled out loudly, he was one of the first few people to come, along with Dean. There was even Ginny and Luna behind them, Draco sipped on his blue drink and observed them carefully. The party wasn’t too wild, just a few spots with games, some light drinks and Sobering Potions ready to make sure the Professors or Filch won’t catch them later.
“No, he is” Draco answered “Jet-black hair, I like it”
“I’m just saying, if you tolerate her more, maybe you wouldn’t hate organising the library so much”
Draco rolled his eyes at the voice and stood up, he stepped a few steps to the direction of the loo and spun on his heels, walking to Potter’s booth with the most confident look he has
Draco shuffled in the hospital wing and found an empty bed for him to sit on, he let out a quiet sigh and glanced at the moon shining outside from the window. It was dark already, but he didn’t feel like going back to his dorm. Ever since he got back to Hogwarts to attend the last year here, he has been feeling lonely. His friends were still there for him, but he still felt like something was missing, his heart was empty, and he yearned to be filled.
“What are you doing staring at that parchment?” Pansy pulled him out of his thoughts, she was sitting on Blaise’s bed, holding herself up with her arms while arching her eyebrows at Draco “You seem to have some problems”
“You heard?” Draco nudged him back “Rumours are rumours, Theo, don’t trust it”
, I’m sorry I’m late” Hermione barged in the room and smiled at them “Hi everyone”
” He mumbled, knowing whenever he spoke French, it would turn Harry on even more. He felt his husband’s arm around his waist and prepared himself for a ride. Draco closed his eyes and felt happiness fulfilling him up, he finally got what he wanted, and it was
Harry put on a jacket and Apparate straight away to Draco’s place
case, then I assume it’s important enough for everyone to hear” He crossed his arms over his chest and arched his perfectly trimmed eyebrow “What were you two talking about?”
“Yeah, they’ve been friends since First Year”
He whispered so the other guy wouldn’t hear
“We know you two have a
“Hey, er, do you see Theo?” Neville stopped in front of Draco and asked “I thought he was just here”
“Sorry, Professor” They both said but Professor Slughorn only nodded at them. He could never stop favouring Harry, couldn’t he?
“Thanks” Theo said “I heard Abbott is slithering her way back with Neville again”
“Potter, what the fuck?”
“The last thing she told me was that she felt uncomfortable, then she just fainted” Luna was on the ground, her hands holding Ginny’s limped hand, her lips were white, he knew she was trying to hide her stomachache earlier, the girl was just too stubborn, like the rest of her family, he should have told Hermione to check on her.
“There” Ron showed Harry the other side of the big kitchen, his finger pointed at his husband, who was also wearing chef uniform. Blaise and Ron were both amazing chefs, that was how they met after Hogwarts “
“I really can’t help it” Harry laughed softly, stripping off his clothes and shoes in a few seconds, when he pulled down his boxer, Draco pressed his lips in a thin line and pinched the bridge of his nose to stay calm. He should have known, he should have known Harry would be hung, he really should have fucking known that, Draco feared for the sake of his arse tomorrow. Draco stepped under the water again and pulled Harry in with him, looking up at those green eyes again and snapped his fingers to charmed himself cleaned, lubed and protected, it was his first rule in sex. Draco leaned closer until their lips were inches apart and brushed past it to reach the bottle of shower cream behind Harry. He heard a small huff of laugh from the Auror and squeezed a bit of cream into his hand, he stood straight back and kept his eyes on Harry, his hands rubbing the cream together to create soap. He placed his soapy hands on Harry’s chest and began rubbing them all over the Auror’s hard upper body.
“I’ll heal you” He said, murmuring a wandless spell and then placing a soft kiss on his wrist, watching the way their son’s face lightened up “All done”
“Don’t, Ron”
For once, the room was crowded with people like the Yule Ball again, but this time, there was no gowns or fancy robes, just a bunch of students dancing and drinking together. Draco leaned on the wall, sipping on the blue drink that has now become his favourite, and watched the room. It’s been specially altered into a party room, like Pansy wanted. He could see some of the students still reading on the couch in the corner. And there it was, Harry standing next to Ron and Neville, talking about something next to the table full of food. Draco looked at him carefully, he was wearing a black shirt, with jeans and boots, his hair messy as always. Somehow he didn’t look like a student in robes anymore, if anything, he looked more mature. Harry’s hands, holding onto his beer tightly, the way he laughed so freely around his friends, Draco almost envied it.
“I just
“Kinda?”
“This is just traditions, after all, we got married” Harry smiled before opening the door and stepped in, just as they got in the house, Draco attacked him with a kiss. He immediately let Draco down on his feet and grabbed his face, sliding his tongue inside as Draco pushed him so hard his back hit the wall
“Sit down, Boot” Draco said and pointed at the chair in front of him “Go away, Pansy”
“You have got to stop drinking my coffee” Harry said with a smile, earning a wink from Draco, he didn’t want him to change if he was being honest, he loved the fact that Draco always drank his coffee and ate his food, sometimes he’d even steal Harry’s clothes.
“Or is it because you are jealous that Brandon can kiss Draco and you can’t?”
“Just a stupid hex” Harry replied to Hermione “Still stings a bit, Ron got some too”
Ron elbowed Blaise when the git tried to push in again, he really didn’t want to be caught
“Er, can I…can I have your phone number?”
“Okay” He replied with uncertainty in his voice, of course it’d be hard for him to be this close to Potter, but if it wasn’t kissing or shagging, he guessed he could bear it. Draco felt his bare skin tickling and turned to the other guy on the bed “Do you usually do this? Hugging me?”
?” Ron asked, just to be sure “A male stripper?
, she gave me a guys and guys one” Neville smiled “I’m not sure if she did it on purpose or not, but I did read it…a few times, for research purpose”
“What?” Pansy shrieked “We sat there for
Pansy was yelling from behind them, chasing them as their friends watched, Pansy sure could run fast in the sand.
“Hmm…
“Twenty two years, I’m so old now”
She turned back to Draco and sighed “Fine, it is. It was Muggle movie night, Hermione got me into it ever since we started dating all those years ago. And I thought of speed dating, so Hermione, being the brilliant, awesome, perfect person she is, thought of this whole thing”
So they actually switched places, Draco gaped, sitting down on his bed and continued reading
“Alright, Harry and Draco, please pick one. This is the last round. You and Harry are tied with Seamus and Padma until now with four points, if you two get this, you will be the winning couple” Luna extended her arm and Draco put his hand in the box, he picked up one folded piece of parchment and opened it. His hands immediately stopped moving when he saw the word
“No, I…I want to talk to him a bit more” Draco said, his hand squeezing Harry’s thigh “You guys should go”
“You don’t have to” Hermione said and looked back at Draco “Well, the point is, she was the opposite of me, how could I fall for her? In the end, I did”
“I’m sorry too” Harry murmured, placing his hand on Draco’s chest as well “For doing this to you”
Blaise cursed, looking up at the ceiling and back down to kiss Ron “You are a fucking treasure”
is why he ran?”
alright” Ginny bid them goodbye and quickly ran off to see her wife, leaving Pansy and Hermione with Draco, who was quite tipsy from all the drinks Theo has been giving him
“Hey” He called her, he wanted to do something nice, maybe a good thing without wanting anything back “I can get you Nimbus 3000”
“Are you sure they’re not snogging the hell out of each other?” Theo smirked while cleaning out the glasses for the dating event, his husband helped mixing drinks from behind. They have been together for almost three years now, Neville became a Herbology professor two years ago and still occasionally help Theo out at his pub whenever he could. McGonagall actually made them the only exception that could go in and out of Hogwarts any time they want “You know they’re always doing it when they’re alone”
“You’re too easy to read, Ron” Draco said, pulling out the blush from his box “Blaise can be a manslut, yes, but he can be serious when he wants to, so no, he isn’t fucking anyone outside”
“But, er, we were supposed to have dinner tomorrow, at the restaurant where we first did a fake proposal to each other” Harry pointed out, he has the whole thing planned out, he has been preparing it for weeks “Before that, I was going to make you breakfast in bed, then I’ll surprise you at work, and er, then I’ll pick you up for dinner, and we’ll go to your favourite ice cream place in Paris, the one you used to go as a child, and ended with us back in our home, decorated with a lot of stuff and…you know, probably ends the night with sex”
