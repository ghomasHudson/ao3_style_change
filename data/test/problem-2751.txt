Harry smiles at that. They have time to figure this out, to make it work. The idea excites him more than anything else.
Sent: Ok, stay. Don't move. I'm just Apparating over now.
“Draco, relax. I was teasing.” Harry had pulled off his coat, tying it around his waist to cover his backside. “You know,” he continued, voice softer now, “generally I quite like it when men want to look at my naked arse. It was just a joke.”
Harry rolled his eyes. “What, do you think I’m stupid? You’re the most opinionated man I’ve ever met. It would’ve been foolish of me, trying to pick out a ring without you.”
“No? Then, how about your performance?”
“Sorry, come again?” he said as he found Harry still in the living room, his back turned to Draco.
Draco chose not to dwell on that part as he followed Harry into a room that was all brick walls and cement ceiling and floor. It was large, with metal shelves lining the walls and standing in two long rows down the middle. One side of the room was filled with boxes of supplies, things Draco had noticed in the shop on his way back here. Walking past the boxes of Blazing Blissbombs and Splendid Sprinkle Sparklers, he zeroed in on the contents of the shelves on the other side of the aisle.
“What was that all about?”
“Your friend gave it to me,” he said. Then, once he realised how that must have sounded, he quickly added, “I— I didn’t ask her for it or anything. She just…gave it to me. Yesterday. I—”
Harry loves his fiancé, but—
“Well, I suppose this isn’t how you intended to spend Christmas.
Even now, seven months later, the image was as vivid in Harry’s mind as if it had happened yesterday. Which was really inconvenient. And highly unprofessional. Not to mention, what the knowledge would do to their hard-earned friendship if Draco were ever to find out about his—
His best friends and his boyfriend each take seats next to him and Draco leans in, kissing him gently on the cheek. The familiar smell of caramel filling his senses makes Harry hum in pleasure and one word floats to the top of his befuddled mind.
Draco nodded, trying but failing to meet his eyes. “Yeah. I know. Sorry.”
Harry tore his eyes from Draco’s fly so fast it made him dizzy. Or, maybe it was the sight that met him when he did; those silvery eyes twinkling at him like the finest tinsel in town.
Smaug joined him at the table and they ate together, Draco relaying his conundrum to his little friend.
,” Harry groans and thrusts back, closing his eyes and letting his head fall back as he blindly grabs Draco’s shoulders for leverage. Draco apparently takes Harry’s bared throat as an invitation because his mouth latches onto his neck with fervour, sucking, biting, licking his way over Harry’s skin with the hunger of a starving man. His pleased humming and the wet sounds of his sloppy kisses join Harry’s panting breaths, filling the silence with the most erotic soundtrack Harry’s ever heard.
Harry frowned, reaching out for the half-empty wine bottle to top off their glasses as he seemed to ponder Draco’s words. “Wanting to hide, huh?”
“You—” He took a deep breath and tried again, something twisting strangely in his stomach. “You made this? But… How?”
“No.” Draco sighed and avoided his gaze. “I wanted an Antipodean Opaleye.”
Received: Wait
“Why…?”
George merely laughed, and with a finger wiggle wave and a cheerful “Toodle-oo”, he was gone, leaving the door open behind him.
Taking his refuge preoccupying himself with the espresso machine, he started in on Ginger’s order, relying on muscle memory alone as the mental whirlwind picked up speed in his brain yet again. It had been relentless ever since he first laid eyes on The Note, tossing his thoughts around in his mind much the same way as the brisk gusts of wind played with the autumn leaves on the street outside.
Draco chuckles.
Harry licks his lips, awestruck.
Received: You don’t like it?
Draco closed his eyes for a second and took a deep breath, wondering for the millionth time that week how he’d managed to get himself into this mess. “Right, um,” he said, squaring his shoulders before facing his colleague and returning to his side of the desk. “We’re kind of keeping it quiet right now, but it seems Charlie Weasley and I are engaged.”
“Ah. That’s… good. I—” Draco swallows and averts his gaze. “I just wanted to check in to see if you ever found yourself a date for the evening?”
"This is… Draco, this is amazing."
Harry thanked the cold weather for excusing his blush when first Draco and then Teddy turned to look at him. They seemed to be talking about him, Harry realised as Teddy gave him an enthusiastic wave. Warily, Harry extracted a hand from his pocket and waved back, only to feel his stomach lurch when Draco, too, lifted a glove-covered hand to wiggle his fingers at him with an amused smirk.
If any of their friends had any initial reservations about them living together, their worries had been unnecessary, if not unjustified. They used to hate each other, after all, but people change. They’ve both grown up, moved on from their black-or-white outlook on life and learnt to appreciate the broad spectrum of colours in between. Just like the world around them, they’ve reached a new level of tolerance and respect, a sentiment shared with most witches and wizards within the British magical community today.
“Would you mind if I came over closer to talk?”
You got a Muggle Survival Kit? I’m sure you understand why the idea makes me wanna laugh. Surely, even you must be able to admit it’s a bit ironic. I’m guessing that’s something the Ministry supplied you with? Well, I guess a torch would be hard to get to function in an ancient magical house like yours — I can’t even get my wristwatch to work in Grimmauld Place (which is bloody annoying, really) —  but see if you haven’t got a box of matches in there somewhere. A small rectangular box with thin wooden sticks in it? If you drag the coated end against the rugged side of the box, swiftly but not too forcefully (or you’ll break the stick), it should light up for long enough to set flame to a candle wick.
Harry hurried to the fireplace, and Draco followed him, watching him trip the ward allowing the call. The person murmured, then Harry turned back over his shoulder to look at Draco. “They want to talk to you. It’s St Mungo’s.”
He was just putting the final touches on the couple’s tray when a deep, soft voice spoke close to his ear.
“But…” Goldstein looked torn, seemingly unwilling to part from his Arithmancy book.
“Hmm?” He looked up from his Transfiguration homework. He’d been struggling with this assignment for nearly a week and he still hadn’t found an answer to why it wasn’t working. Maybe he was putting too much power behind the spell? The book said this was a delicate conjuring, and delicacy had never really been his strong suit. But if he tried to cut his power by half, then maybe—
“Based on what I’ve heard from my siblings and my new colleagues, I beg to differ. You’ve practically been circling each other since day one, haven’t you?”
“Seriously?” Draco chuckled as he got back on his feet. Damn, that laughter was infectious. “Turn around and let me see.”
Your laughter subsides and you take a sip from your champagne flute. I can’t help but watch the movement of your Adam’s apple as you swallow. The sight of it, bobbing along your throat, sends an inappropriate thrill down my spine. And then, as Nott starts in on another tale, you frown and let your silver-grey eyes scan the room.
Sirius threw his head back and barked out a hearty laugh. “Call me Sirius. Charlie’s practically my godson’s brother. I pretty much took them all on as family after the war, and if you’re going to be in the family too…”
And I want to kiss those dry, quivering lips until you’ve forgotten all about your idiot of a father and all you remember is how much you are loved.
“Don’t be.” Draco’s silver-grey eyes returned to him, sparkling like tinsel in the light from the crackling fire. “I know I had a privileged childhood, and I’m not complaining. I’m just… It would’ve been nice, you know, to have experienced that…”
Harry frowns. “And that’s funny why?” he grumbles into the side of Draco’s neck.
, Mr Malfoy, could use a few minutes with your stubborn
So I make an effort to stay positive whenever they’re around, which works fine, I guess, as long as it’s not for hours on end. Sometimes when I’m with them, I even fool myself into believing my life really is as good as I claim it to be. But they don’t know how listless I feel once I’m back in my empty house. They don’t know about how I’m constantly questioning every part of my life, or the total lack of enthusiasm I feel for my chosen auror career.
“Yes, you are. And you deserve to be happy, Harry. You, if anyone, deserve someone who can make you happy. How are you ever supposed to find someone like that if you don’t get out there and—”
Draco shrugged, then cleared his throat as he handed her the gift bag. “A fruitcake. Though I fear it’ll get lost amongst all your amazing pies and such. Maybe just save it for tea another day.”
This day was not about him, though. It was about Teddy. And there was nothing Harry wouldn’t do for his godson, even if it involved bumping into every witch and wizard in the country.
Oh how your father hated me for tricking him into freeing Dobby. You should’ve seen the man’s face as he realised what had just happened; it might just be one of my life’s most satisfying moments to date.
Fuck, my head hurts.
“Minister Shacklebolt. How wonderful to see you here this evening. How are you?”
— who was definitely
“Draco, you’re—
Harry cleared his throat and smiled sheepishly. “Would you mind if he stayed for breakfast?”
Draco sighed. “Fiancé?”
“Well, I never heard of such nonsense,” the wizard gasped. “Mildred and I will certainly be making a donation on top of whatever we purchase tonight at the auction.” He held out his hand for Draco to shake. “Thank you for helping the children, young man.”
Bill and Fleur flanked them, and with the fellow Veela by his side, Draco finally seemed to be able to relax somewhat. "Thank you," Harry mouthed to her, and she smiled.
“Wow,” Draco said, stopping short. “I can’t have been gone more than thirty minutes. How did you get cleaned up so quickly? You look great.”
Her hug was so tight, and Draco had no idea how she had enough energy to hug him like this after that long monologue without a single breath. But the hug…
Most, but not all.
The first dream came on his eighteenth birthday. It was vivid and colourful and real. So real. After waking up, warm and breathless, he hadn’t been able to recall what had happened in the dream, but he could remember what it had felt like. What
Harry shrugged. “I don’t have memories of my parents, only stories I’ve been told and phantom images in my dreams. I think if I did, if I had real memories, I would’ve liked to remember them when I’m missing them. Like a tribute of sorts. You know, to honour them.”
Belatedly, Draco took a seat in the chair across from Harry. He only hesitated for a second before sliding one of the cups over the tabletop towards his boyfriend. Merlin, if only his heart could stop hammering so furiously… “H-here you go, love. One large coffee, black as midnight and sweet as treacle tart.”
12 Grimmauld Place, London
Draco peered over at the man. He’d never seen this stranger before; how could he possibly know Draco’s parents well enough to assert anything like that?
Any other day, the prodding would probably irritate the hell out of Harry. But while he can still hear the amused smile in Draco’s voice, while he still senses the mischievous twinkle in his eyes, somehow Harry knows Draco’s not out to make fun of him tonight. The teasing tone might be there, but Harry recognises the sincerity resonating in the background, the accompanying sympathy and concern. Despite desperately wanting to talk about anything but the current topic, Harry can’t help but feel grateful for Draco’s friendship. When Draco cares about someone, he does so wholeheartedly
“Insatiable, are we?”
“And… you don’t… like being clean?” Harry offers.
Not that he was in any way turned on by seeing Draco as a wrinkled oldie — truly, he wasn’t — it was just… Harry just loved the idea of an old Draco looking so happy and content with his life. He hoped the man would one day, many years from now, look like that for real. Most of all, Harry wished he’d be the one to be there by Draco’s side making it happen.
With Draco’s fairly decent size, Harry had been prepared for at least some discomfort. Not that he had too much experience with this kind of thing, but with the limited experience Harry
PPS And it’s not like you have any right to talk when it comes to weird names. I mean, Draco? Who even names their child that? No wonder you turned out the way you did.
What do you think? Can this be it? I can’t be certain since I haven’t had the opportunity to let anyone else try it out yet, but it does have the same shimmery quality as yours, and it does stay on the parchment when I use it, so I guess there’s a fair chance this might be mine, right?
“Malfoy? What’s a pretty thing like you doing in a place like this?”
“If you only knew,” Draco muttered, but he forced a smile.
“It’s a long story, but—”
Draco merely had time to register Potter’s lips on his before the kiss turned from sensation to memory. A barely-there brush of
“Yeah. I mean, one boy even asked for a real-life dragon.”
Harry nods. “So what does this mean? I mean...” He leans down to pick up his cloak, then extends his arm for Orion to climb and wrap around. “ For us? Do we tell everyone we’re together? Does anyone know you’re Veela? Can I tell Ron and Hermione? What—”
Potter hummed, sounding unconvinced as he seemed to be thinking over what Molly had just told him. Draco’s heart hammered in his chest as he waited for the man’s reply.
Nobody in the room seemed to know who he was talking about, and Draco watched with concern as the first signs of true panic crossed Charlie’s face, his breathing quickening.
“Just a baby. Yeah. I got that. I still can’t believe you came home from the Reserve with a fox.”
No, it’s true. I honestly didn’t even know what our crest looked like — until just the other day when curiosity finally got the better of me. I don’t know what made me do it. Usually, just the thought of venturing inside the remains of my parents’ cottage is enough to turn my stomach. Odd that the first time I do, it’s in search of something as trivial as a pot of ink.
— indulged him. At Harry’s plea, he entered him, pressing the tip of his tongue inside Harry’s body over and over and over again until Harry shamelessly begged for more.
Ducking Malfoy,
Adrenaline flooded Harry’s veins like a tsunami, dread rooting him to the spot for what felt like ages before he finally got the gears of his brain working again.
No, it couldn’t be. Not after… It simply couldn’t.
“No, you idiot,” Draco chuckled, “the city. Mother and I went there several times when I was young. It was usually just the two of us, Father being busy at the Ministry or whatnot, and she and I would spend days wandering the shops and museums, stopping into cathedrals, and savouring granita in the sun at open-air cafés. We’d take a carriage through the countryside and visit vineyards, staying in villas of people she knew.” He paused and inhaled, the floral scents of spring in Florence flooding his memory. “I can still smell the wisteria. It was our special time together, and definitely the happiest times of my life.”
“All right, all right.” Malfoy sighs in defeat. “I’ll eat the fucking pizza.”
“No, it is. I’ve not helped friends who I knew needed it, simply because I couldn’t be bothered. And I’ve ignored many of the values I was raised with because they weren’t convenient.”
It’s not often Harry manages to shut him up with nothing but a baleful glare. Too bad he doesn’t have time to savour the moment; the cinnamon batch is just about ready to come out of the oven, and the next tray is nowhere near ready yet. Not to mention the strawberry frosting and…
Harry makes a decision then. His stomach churns just thinking about it, but if it can get Draco to drop the conversation, he might be willing to offer the man a tiny sliver of the mortifying truth. He can’t look at him, though, or there’d be a good chance Draco will be able to read the unspoken words in his eyes. Instead, he keeps his gaze in his lap, watching his knuckles whitening from the firm clutch on his mug as he speaks.
Draco froze.
Your bringer of truth,
“So, it’s
Draco must read something in Harry's gaze because he pulls his fingers out, leaving Harry terribly empty, then returns again, this time with what must be another finger.
PS Yes, I’m fucking sure his name was Tom Riddle. Tom Marvolo Riddle, in fact. His mother was a Gaunt. Riddle was his father’s name. His
“No, not yet. But you will,” the man answered cryptically. “One day you and I will know each other better than anyone else.”
“Some friend you are,” he grumbles, rising to his feet just as the timer beeps over by the counter. Thankful for the distraction, Harry draws his wand and spells the leaves out of their tea, sending them swirling in the air above their mugs. They look like autumn leaves trapped in a capricious whirlwind, reminding Harry of his own inner turmoil.
“I can get anyone to fall in love with me if I wanted to.”
“Don’t you dare.”
Where his younger self would go into instant counter-attack mode, this Potter stayed calm and centred, as if Draco’s outburst hadn’t affected him in the least. Somehow, this fact managed to rattle Draco more than any offensive move ever would. Draco knew how to handle the hotheaded teenager. His composed older counterpart? Not so much.
the wizarding world would have been most understanding.”
Orion butts his head into Harry's hand, urging him to move the petting to the ridge above his eyes. "
"I want to feel you. All of you. Please, Draco."
“No,” Teddy whined when Harry relieved the boy of his cup. “I don’ wanna…”
without his twin, wrapped an arm around his sister. “It’s Charlie. Of course, he’ll be okay. He’s had worse than this, trust me. Remember that time with the fireworks?”
They were both breathless and blushing when they eventually broke apart, their eyes locked on each other as Harry dropped the magic shield, letting the cheers of the room overtake them. Harry took Draco’s hand, linking their fingers tightly before turning to approach the rest of the room.
He cleared his throat. “You’re welcome.”
Harry lets out a groan that makes Draco laugh. “Come on. We have our whole lives to find out.”
going to use Legilimency on my son,” Narcissa insisted, the last words from the two before the door finally closed shut behind them.
“Everything all right in there?”
Draco laughed and raised his glass to take a drink when an arm reached around him and grabbed his wrist.
Everyone looked at Harry, who shrugged and pointed at Draco. “Ask him. He was the one there feeding it.”
Taking after his father’s gesture, Ron conjured another chair for his own wife, who sat carefully, shooting her husband a thankful smile and began talking quietly with Molly. Ron looked up and scanned the room, his eyes widening as they landed on Draco. “What’s
“Come on, Harry. We’ve been over this.”
“Here you go.” He commended himself for not letting his gaze stray to the table in the corner where the raven-haired bloke was currently busy making himself at home. “Enjoy.”
Whatever happens, though, you can rest assured I won’t be ending up with Ginny, neither at the party next week nor any other day. Not only because she’s apparently crushing on someone else now (who she stubbornly refuses to reveal the name of), but because ever since you mentioned me being with her would be like marrying a sibling, I just can’t see it anymore. Not that I have any real siblings to compare with, but I guess you have a point. It just feels weird to think of her that way now, you know? The same way I’d never even contemplate hooking up with Hermione. And since the rest of the girls even close to my age seem more interested in the myth than the man, I guess I’d better prepare to settle down in Singleton, Loneshire. (Well, muggles could be an option, of course, but I don’t think I’d be able to hide such an integral part of me as my magic from someone who I intend to form a more meaningful relationship with. A relationship like that should be built on trust and honesty, not lies and deceit.)
“You really think we could just…?”
A flicker of something —
“That’s not what I…” Harry stopped himself from finishing the sentence. Whiny and petulant was not how he wished for Draco to remember him while away in France over the holidays. “Of course not. According to ‘Dromeda, he’s not been able to talk about anything else the entire week.”
It’d been a long time since he’d been intimate with somebody, but he wasn’t about to break his streak with Slyvia, no matter how lonely he was. But the invitation, the heart-warming knowledge that someone out there actually did want him, remained with him throughout the evening. That night, as he closed his eyes, he imagined a pair of crystal blue eyes in a weathered, freckled face and fell to sleep with a smile upon his face.
Harry choked on his breath, and next to his ear he could hear Draco do the same.
Pushing off from the counter, Draco took a few steps towards him, searching his face for something Harry didn’t dare put into words. His heart was beating so fast it felt like it was ready to explode, hope surging from his core in a whirlwind he found himself unable to control. “What were you…?”
A low whine on the pillow beside him drew his attention to Smaug, the fox’s ears twitching in his sleep. Draco ran his hand across the animal’s scruffy paws, playing with the tufts of fur sticking out from between the pads. Smaug opened one sleepy eye and let out a loud sniff.
And that’s when Draco knew; it was finally time.
Draco’s jaw drops, and as he blinks, Harry takes the opportunity to extend his arm, offering Draco the long-stemmed, red-tipped yellow rose Neville had said symbolised friendship evolving into love.
Draco’s observations were soon proved incorrect, though, as Harry caught sight of him and that brilliant smile of his evaporated before Draco’s eyes.
PS Well, at least you have a pale natural skin colour for your scars to blend in with. Imagine what they would look like on me. One day out in the sun and they’d be shining like fucking beacons in the dark. You know what the scars on my hand look like, right?
Harry pinches one of Draco’s pebbled nipples, efficiently transforming Draco’s too sensible words into another delicious moan.
“Yeah, I know.” Teddy’s murmur was all but inaudible in the lively square, and his eyes didn’t quite manage to meet Harry’s as Teddy bit his bottom lip and fiddled with his scarf. “I’m sorry.”
“No, fuck
Draco jerked his head around, finding Harry staring at a small box he’d just pulled out from his pocket. As Draco watched him, Harry withdrew his wand and enlarged the box before extending it to Draco, his eyes never leaving the gift in his hand.
Draco's brow furrows in concern. "I'll hurt you."
Your key in the lock catches me by surprise. You nearly never come home these days, and whenever you plan to stop by, you usually let me know beforehand. As if I would mind having you. As if you didn’t live here anymore.
Received: That’s not the line.
his brain supplied.
“I know.” Draco’s voice is so soft and gentle, comforting Harry’s aching heart like a plush security blanket.
Did you know your mother sent her sister a painting of you last week? One with you sitting in an armchair, reading in front of the fire? Andromeda showed it to me that same afternoon after your letters arrived. She really is talented, your mum. Every detail was stunning, every curve of your face, every line of your clothes, and Merlin, the lighting — I barely restrained the urge to trace my fingers over the picture to double-check if the warmth I saw licking your skin was as real as it looked. As for the sight of you, I must say I’m pleased you seem to be doing all right, all things considered. Sure, you’re paler than usual, but who wouldn’t be after spending almost a year and a half indoors? Apart from that, though, you look
“I help Pansy with the Foundation. Fundraising, planning events, and so on.”
“Yeah.” He turned and stepped up to Charlie’s door.
“Do you even know how many calories there are in one of those?”
Draco took his time, sucking and licking and kissing a trail up Harry’s chest, along his neck, and all the way up to his ear. The hand fondling Harry’s cock squeezed lightly as he whispered, “Have you been a good boy this year?”
When Harry wakes up after Merlin knows how long, his head is cushioned on something soft and the sweet scent of caramel and orange fills his nostrils as he takes in a deep breath.
" Orion slithers out of Harry's pocket and down his leg. "
“Tell me, love. Please? I—"
“Well, the likelihood of me being drawn into a Veela bond is pretty slim,” Harry finally said with a laugh. “I just wish I knew how to recognise the person for me when I meet them?”
intolerant traditions of those
“Who?” Ginny looked up from her never-ending flirting with Demelza Robins.
And No, of course I haven’t dated a boy.
Draco’s eyes widened, and he couldn’t quite contain his smile. “You got Shacklebolt to come? Seriously?”
Received: Alright, suit yourself...
He sank down into a chair. “He doesn’t want me.”
Charlie himself was still unconscious.
Harry nodded.
A glimpse of black hair raised his hopes until he realised it wasn’t his cousin’s long, glossy tresses but Harry’s shorter, perpetually dishevelled curls. Harry stood talking with Ron and George, a hopeful smile spreading on his face as the brothers grinned and slapped him on the back. Draco’s stomach fluttered instinctively at the sight, and he stifled a groan. Apparently, his body seemed to have forgotten all about the disaster of last night’s events already. Much like Harry, Draco observed, who looked as cheerful as ever, like last night never happened in the first place.
Smaug began yipping and running towards the door about twenty seconds before a knock came, pulling Draco from his thoughts. By the lack of heels clacking on his ceiling, he knew who it was.
, almost falls from Harry’s lips. Because it’s hard to believe anything else when you’re sitting right next to your ‘special someone’. But then again, if it really were true love, if it were destined, wouldn’t the feelings be mutual?
“You know what?” Draco leaned in and lowered his voice. “I’ll give you both.”
Draco swallowed and glanced up at him. “Because no one else knows, and I’ve been waiting for the right moment to tell you.”
Laughing, Draco pulled Harry's shirt off over his head. "You're eager."
“I don’t know,” Charlie said, searching Draco’s face. He looked confused, but not upset. “Draco?”
the fire. He chided himself for this fact even as he ran faster, watching the fire die out for several seconds only to return again once the irate dragon had gathered her breath.
. Hazelnut?
many reasons Draco could never get enough of showering Harry with his love and affection.
“No, not at all. Why?”
“Harry, please don’t. I can’t… I can’t…“
“I’m sorry,” he said quietly. He met Draco’s gaze. “Really.”
“Of course.” Harry’s voice reached him from the open doorway to the right through which he’d disappeared a moment before. “Haven’t you?”
“It’s burgundy, Potter. Honestly.”
Teddy hesitated, seemingly unsure how to proceed, so Harry patted him on the back, urging him up the steps.
Harry bristled but nodded. Draco put the cat down to eat and decided he couldn’t take it anymore. He needed to clean this dump, if not for Charlie or himself, then for poor Mushu’s sake.  He drew out his wand and started throwing things in the bin and levitating dishes into the sink. Harry followed him around but didn’t seem to be willing to help. “When did you and Charlie start seeing each other.”
, Harry’s sex-addled brain provided. As if Harry cared. Just as long as Draco got the message.
Heart pounding, Draco turned that last corner and finally caught sight of the door he’d been heading for. He was teetering on the verge of a mental breakdown already, and there was only one person he could trust to talk him through it. Circe, how had his life come to this? Sixteen years old, all prospects of a bright future thoroughly squashed, his only remaining friend: a fucking ghost.
“You know, the cock piercing?”
He approached the entrance, hearing the murmurs within, and slowly unwound his formal cloak from his shoulders and draped it over his arm. He was wearing a set of his best silvery-grey dress robes and he knew they looked good on him. He’d taken the time to arrange his still-too-long hair just so but hadn’t had the heart or the energy to apply the finishing touches around his eyes. Eyeliner was probably too much for a morning wedding, anyway.
The set menu did in fact only include one chosen spread with the scone, but hell if Draco was just going to stand there, waiting for her to make up her mind while the queue of customers grew behind her.
“You promised—? Draco, he’s a
“Yeah, I— I have a blind date, actually.”
This place sure is a whole other world during hols. We’re only about a dozen students left over Easter and I don’t think the castle has ever felt more abandoned. Everyone who can just wants to be home with their families, I guess, especially now after the war. I could’ve gone too, of course, it’s not like I wouldn’t be welcome at the Burrow if I wanted to. Ron and Hermione and the others tried to talk me into joining them for weeks, and maybe I should have. I thought about it; even got as far as to start a letter to Molly telling her I’d come. But in the end, I just couldn’t do it.
Hermione's eyes sparkled, her smile wide. "It's quite flattering, really, but I'm only nineteen."
“Oh, well… Any place that offers high-quality food and a decent wine list, really. Preferably someplace with live music that allows for some post-dinner slow dancing if the mood strikes.” Malfoy’s lips quirk into a dreamy smile. “I’m not saying I need to be taken to The Golden Cauldron or anything. Although, it’s on my bucket list…” He shoots Harry a glance before adding, “Did you know they have a three-month waiting list if you want to book a table?”
Still, he leaned into her, grateful for her acceptance of the changes in his life. He'd been worried about Draco's reception in the Weasley family, but although there'd been some initial confusion and hesitation, they'd eventually greeted Harry's chosen mate with cordial politeness, if not eager delight.
Harry wouldn’t have minded going with him, just to be able to be there, experiencing the special moment between the little boy and his idol first hand. He’d wanted to listen in on their conversation, already knowing how much he would love Teddy’s precocious demeanour and not wanting to miss out on a single second of it.
“Do you want me to cast a Warming Charm for you?”
, they said.
But okay, let’s say I humour you and your sudden romantic streak. Let’s say its not a ruse and that you actually want a relationship like that in the future. If you ask me — which I’m quite sure you don’t, but you know what? I’m going to give it to you anyway because, well, for fucks sake, M,
“Yeah. I asked him for a boyfriend for you.”
. He sighs. “I mean…”
“Yes, Draco, you are,” Harry insisted and reached up, chasing any further arguments from Draco’s mind with another bone-melting kiss.
Draco studiously ignored the inquisitive gaze and gave the renowned seamstress an amicable smile.
“Sure. Take your time.” Draco let Harry work while he took the opportunity to examine the room. Shelves of books, binders, and office supplies lined the walls with small personal items staggered throughout, giving the room a comfortable air. A storeroom was visible through a door on the left wall, and Draco imagined it probably ran the length of the entire shop. Overall, it was a meticulously organised space, which Draco realised didn’t really surprise him, the business being as successful as it was.
willingly; just a lick of tongue across those perfect lips and Harry is invited in, allowed to explore, to taste, to devour. Harry’s every nerve-ending is on fire, revelling in the touch of Draco’s roaming hands, hot and strong and eager over the thin cotton of Harry’s t-shirt. With Harry’s both feet still on the floor, the angle is far from great, so when Draco’s hand presses against Harry’s lower back he takes it as a sign to move closer.
“Dreams?” Draco asks, breathless. He’s incredibly still, but there’s a twitch in his wings that catches Harry’s eye.
“Yes. Pansy started it after school.” Draco looked away at that, not wanting to disrupt their evening with talks of the past.
“What?” he says as Malfoy’s scrutinising gaze travels over his attire. “I spent twenty minutes trying to figure out what to wear. This is the best I can do.”
… The words had tumbled out of his mouth unauthorised, and as soon as they registered in his brain, he felt the blush rising on his cheeks.
, and
. The intensity of Draco’s gaze is making Harry dizzy and now the man expects him to find words? Construct sentences? Answer questions?
For some reason, everyone seemed to think this hilarious, and all I could think was, ‘If they only knew. Surely, they wouldn’t laugh then.’ Which was when I changed my mind about telling them that day, deciding instead to try and slip out unnoticed when the time came to meet up with the owl around the block or something — because, yes, apparently I was about to chicken out again. (Some Gryffindor I am, right?)
Draco’s gaze darted over to the table in the back corner just in time to see emerald eyes widen before returning to the array of charts and textbooks splayed all over the tabletop. The girl — Janie — rolled her eyes at her friend’s absent-mindedness and said something to him before glancing up at Draco with a knowing smirk on her face.
Draco looked up at her, incredulous. “But this has nothing to do with him, other than he’s part of the family? I mean, this is about Charlie.”
It’s okay. Love is only meant for some; I know that. And I am happy for you. I must be. Because you’re happy, and that’s the only thing that really matters.
“I’m quite fond of it, actually. I’ve been told it’s made by an anonymous artist.” He winked, watching with satisfaction as Harry’s cheeks turned an intriguing shade of pink.
If this had been any other day, Draco would have been sitting here relaxed and content, unwinding with a book and his usual evening cup of tea. That was what he always did at this time of day, a constant part of his comforting evening routine.
“It’s a side effect of a public proposal, Potter. Not everything is about your fame, you idiot. And if you think I’m not aware of what your life is like, you’re daft. Now kiss me again before I have to go and finish this event. I think the price of your sculpture probably just doubled, and I’m going to have to go raise my bid.”
“You just disappeared,” Harry said after helping himself to a second slice of the dessert Draco had contributed to their evening. Draco looked up from his plate to find Harry watching him curiously. “I remember reading about your release, and then… Was it even two weeks before you—”
“I— But…” Harry blinks. “You’re a man?”
“Maybe a quarter of an hour…”
“Oh. I—” The flower draws Draco’s gaze, holding his attention for several excruciating seconds before those stormy-grey eyes, still swirling with confusion, eventually return to Harry’s.
Pleads. "Draco, please… Just do it."
Sent: And what would you serve for dessert?
“No, she’s not. Is she busy?”
A cleansing breath. A decisive nod. Then Harry turned to give his godson a reassuring smile.
Received: D'you know what I want for my birthday?
Harry could easily drown in those enigmatic eyes, glistening like liquid silver and currently dark with promise. Yet, his own eyes close of their own accord as Draco leans in and finally —
Merlin, what a Christmas.
“Wait,” I call back, scowling at a can of tomato soup before I abandon the kitchen and trudge across the flat towards your room. “How many times have I told you not to—”
Blondie looked sceptical, which prompted Draco to add, “How about you take one of those and one double chocolate to share? I’m positive she’ll prefer the ginger one, but this way you’ll leave the ultimate choice up to her, doubling your chances to leave her satisfied.”
“You’ve set up wards?” Draco called after him, “In a Muggle—”
Charlie smiled. “I’ve had a lot of time to think over the last couple of days. I almost died out there because of a really stupid mistake; a selfish mistake. It’s made me step back and take stock of a few things, and I realised that I don’t really like who I’ve become.”
A flash of metal, a slash of flesh, a scream of fury, and then Hagrid’s voice booming over the growing pandemonium.
He’s not surprised to notice their arrival manages to turn quite a few heads, but it all soon fades away when he catches the wondrous expression on Draco’s face. He looks like a child on Christmas morning, taking in the prestigious venue with evident admiration, his vibrant eyes sparkling in the light from the many chandeliers. He’s so gorgeous like this, all happy and unguarded. Harry has never wanted him more.
“Merlin, Harry…” he murmured, brushing feather-light fingertips over Harry’s bare stomach, making him quiver. “I can’t believe you’re…”
Sent: Only if you stop with the emojis.
Much like Draco himself.
: I get the nagging feeling this version of Draco is indeed aware of Shakespeare's Hogwarts legacy and might have had this in mind as he crafted that first paragraph. What do you think?
“You’re one to talk,” Draco murmured against Harry’s shoulder. “Exam revisions, my arse.” Draco nipped at Harry’s collarbone before rising up on his hands and knees to look Harry in the eye. “You just wanted a reason to get your hands all over me, didn’t you?”
Sleep eluded him where he laid in the dark, thoughts swirling as he studied the shadows on the ceiling. No matter how he tried, he couldn’t stop smiling.
They crashed, of course, snow flying everywhere. Honestly, with Potter steering, what else was there to expect? They tumbled down the hill in a tangle of limbs and when they finally came to a standstill several yards from the sledge, Draco found himself with his back against the ground, straddled by a more-than-usual dishevelled Potter. The git was grinning like a loon, his face mere inches away from Draco’s as he held himself up with one hand on either side of Draco’s head. Time stood still as their panted breaths swirled hot between them, as Potter’s every exhale ghosted over Draco’s bare skin, making him shiver.
“So, tell me more about that exam of yours.”
His first instinct was to call her back, but as his eyes skimmed the note, reading the girl’s neat handwriting, his voice got stuck in his throat. Draco blinked. Swallowed. Read it again. And again. Once he remembered how to breathe, how to move, he tore his gaze from the inexplicable words, frowning as he watched the girl’s chestnut ponytail swing from side to side in sync with her retreating steps.
Received: Er, I have no idea...
It was still hard to grasp it, that Draco was actually here in his bedroom, touching him, holding him. It was like a belated mass delivery of happy childhood Christmases, a whole decade’s worth of them, all wrapped into one.
“Well,” Draco smirked, fully agreeing with his husband but determined to lighten the mood. “I guess we’ll have to come up with distractions to keep us occupied then… Such a hardship.”
“Me too.”
“Sure, I guess, if you don’t mind.”
PS Seriously? You actually wrote to me knowing that first letter could have been the only interaction you’d get the entire year? Merlin. Knowing that makes me even more glad I decided to write you back. Not that it really was a hard decision to make, but still.
The witty remark was on the tip of Draco’s tongue, but he quickly reined it in when he caught sight of Harry’s sheepish squirm. By the faint blush on Harry’s cheeks, the man was already regretting saying anything at all, but were his words really that irrelevant?
Hannah looked up from her charts and smiled. “He’s healing, but no major changes. How are you holding up?” She looked around, making sure they were alone. “Have you told them yet?”
Harry smiles sheepishly. “You know me, I’m always late…”
“Right,” Ginny said, laughing, and held out her hand. “Where’s your map?”
They don’t go clubbing as much anymore, thank Merlin. Not that Harry wouldn’t appreciate the sight of Draco moving on a dancefloor, he would. He did. Too much. So much so that it’s still the most recurring vision of his nocturnal dreams. And his longer-than-necessary showers.
“I’ll show you naughty,” Harry growled and pounced, rolling Draco over on his back and pinning his hands above his head as he straddled him, his cock already swelling again despite their previous activities. Draco opened his mouth to say something, but before he could, Harry was there, silencing him with a feral kiss.
Harry listened intently as Teddy ran into the sitting room and climbed the built-in bench in the bay window to gain a good view of the doorstep.
With the fox ignoring him, Draco gave up the conversation and got up, stretching his aching muscles. His own reflection stared back at him from the mirror as he stepped into his slippers, and he groaned at the sight of his too-long hair all mussed and untidy as it always was after a night of tossing and turning. “I really should find the time to get that haircut,” he muttered. He still hadn’t come to peace with the fact that he’d had to cancel his latest appointment with Mr Wickerton on such short notice, but Pansy and her orphanage had needed him, so it wasn’t like he’d had much choice.
“Harry?”
He watched Charlie nod, trying to ignore the man standing right behind him running his hands through his raven black hair the way he always did whenever he was upset. Draco couldn’t let himself worry about Harry now. He had to finish this. Determined, he turned back to the family.
“Of course, once you know you’re compatible enough to keep a conversation going, or feel comfortable enough in one another’s company not to mind the occasional silence between the two of you, you’re free to choose any activity you’d think your date would enjoy.”
Tension seeped from his body, and Draco laid down on the bed, closing his eyes. Merlin, he was so exhausted.
“Yeah.” Draco shrugs. “Just some bloke Granger wanted me to meet. He’s picking me up in an hour.”
With no means of resistance, Harry is helplessly drawn into the enchanting whirlwind that is Draco Malfoy, spellbound by the man who’s been intriguing him like no other for over a decade.
“Harry Potter. The piece he donated for the auction.”
Draco turned away. He couldn’t do this anymore. He was exhausted, and his head hurt, not to mention his heart. “No, you’re right, she wouldn’t. But you have no idea what it’s like to be alone.”
. Surely, that high-pitched noise wasn’t any of Draco’s doing, was it? Cheeks hot, he cleared his throat and brought his voice back down from the dogs-only territory. “She’s
It all feels smaller now than it used to and maybe that shouldn’t surprise me; it’s been almost two decades since I was last here, after all, a young boy eager to explore everything the world had to offer. Merlin, two decades. Where did the time go? And why haven’t I come back until now?
Ever since your last letter, I can’t get the image of you walking around that house all day blabbering to yourself out of my head. The first sign of insanity, all right. Talking to yourself, I mean. And you’re not even halfway through this year yet; Merlin, you’re going to end up a fucking nutter after this, aren’t you? I’m pretty sure I would.
Merlin, that was a long walk. And they had to make it twice? Draco sighed. “Yes, I know it. So where do you want me to meet you?”
Yeah, they noticed the owl, all right. I hadn’t planned for it to happen, or for them to find out. Well, I had, at first, but then, sometime around mid-morning, I changed my mind.
Draco's lips curve into a smile, and the sadness that had momentarily settled into his eyes seems to lift. "As I said. Thank you."
“Oh, Harry. Please don’t say that.” Hermione scurries around the table to sit down beside him, placing a consoling hand on his shoulder.
“Yes, yes, but we need to raise at least an additional thirty-thousand Galleons if we’re going to have the scholarship fully-funded long enough to begin operating off the interest.” She listened to the other speaker, and Draco wandered the room, studying the painting she’d purchased at the silent auction of one of the autumn’s many fundraisers.
“Charlie—”
No, he really could have done without all the suspicious glances, but at least they were a step up from the hateful slurs and foul hexes he’d had to endure before he’d turned his back on this world all those years ago.
“Hey! I’m not even two months older than you,” Draco exclaimed, giving Harry’s shoulder a half-hearted shove even as his insides buzzed with excitement. The promise of more to come was certainly more than he’d ever dared hope for, but so was this; the two of them together, lying side by side, bantering like old friends.
I thought I had got over the worst of it; thought I’d finally reached some kind of new normal. These past few months, I’ve been sleeping better, sometimes several nights in a row without waking up in a cold sweat and with my limbs tangled in the sheets. I’ve caught myself laughing and joking with my friends without the twinge of grief dampening the moment. Of course, as soon as I realise it, the moment is gone, but still. I actually believed the worst was over, that the bright new future everyone’s been talking about had finally started. I guess I should have known better.
“Slyvia, I’m really not in the mood tonight.” He stood up and stalked to the door. “Yes, you look beautiful; yes, I know my arse would make an angel sing, and no, I will not run away with—”
Harry pulls back his bed curtains and steps out onto the cold stone floor. He casts a quick, low-level
Draco wanted to step back, hoping Charlie wasn’t about to confess something truly horrid, but before he could, Charlie reached out and took Draco’s hand.
Draco went for the door, his left hand sliding into his pocket on its own accord, clutching the silver coin with trembling fingers.
Draco’s eyes finally return to Harry’s, accompanied by an encouraging smile. “Don’t worry; you’ll ace it.”
“Harry…” Draco breathed, his lips mere inches above Harry’s mouth.
Draco forced a grateful expression to his face and turned to Molly, patting her hand still wrapped loosely around his arm. “It’s fine, I can manage to make my way home. I was thinking about going for a walk anyway, just to clear my head.”
“Now, who’s wearing too many clothes,” Harry pouted, already gripping the waistband of Draco’s briefs and pushing them down to mid-thigh.
“Sorry,” Harry’s voice reached him from the living room. “I didn’t mean it like that. It’s nice.”
Meek Malfoy,
Draco’s cheerful voice calls through the flat just as the front door slams shut behind him.
Draco opens his eyes and cocks an eyebrow. "Cheeky, aren't you?"
Draco opened his mouth but nothing came out.
Everyone stopped talking, and a couple of jaws dropped.
“—and Santa got marshmallows in his, even though he didn’t have his pyjamas on, and then—”
“I—” Draco swallowed, his mind reeling with possibilities.
Sent: Potter? Where are you?
“Huh?” Draco blinked, dumbfounded, before realising Harry was referring to the drinks he apparently still clutched in his hands. “Oh. Y-yeah, I—”
Draco nodded, finding himself unable to respond to that. Throwing a fistful of Floo Powder into the fire, he mumbled his destination and departed.
“Because, well…” Harry shifted on the bed, moving to loom over Draco, claiming his gaze with those expressive, emerald eyes. When he spoke again, his voice resonated through every fibre of Draco’s body, low and deliciously sexy. “As your personal physiologist-in-training, I feel obliged to prescribe something for all that heaving. I’m thinking cardio,” he added, rocking his hips, rubbing his hardening cock against Draco’s thigh. “Lots and lots of cardio.”
Sent: Oh, fuck right off. Potter?
I stand by the counter for several minutes, staring unseeingly at the opposite wall as images of you flash before my eyes; your bare skin, your long limbs, your perfect firm arse and that plump, pink lip trapped under shiny white teeth. The entire flat smell of your lemony shampoo, a scent I’ve come to think of as
not suited for any kind of desk job, but I do get what you’re saying about having an activity that forces you to focus. What I wouldn't do for a chance to escape my thoughts sometimes. I’d need something more active than brewing for that to happen, though, and definitely something less complicated.
Somewhere inside him, there’s a tiny voice insisting this can’t be real, that Draco can’t possibly want him in this way. Of course he can’t, or he would’ve said something sooner. If he’d wanted Harry, he wouldn’t have gone for those other men. He wouldn’t have dated that fucking jerk who eventually decided to break Draco’s heart. If Draco had wanted him…
“Well, I mean, men
have had a hand in one of the fics in this year's
you to do — all to make your family happy.”
Secondly, once the man walked out the door, he’d never set foot in Draco’s coffee shop ever again.
— he pushed himself inside.
“It’s about a ten-minute walk. And you said we have two trips, yes?”
But here you are, soaked by the pouring rain, coatless and shivering in the chilly February night. My heart clenches at the sight, and your greeting — not “Sorry to bother you,” or “Can I come in?” or even a “Hi,” but simply, “
Sent: You suck, Potter.
They walked on in silence until they reached the shed again and unloaded their burdens. Locking the door behind them, Harry stood next to Draco as he looked up at the multitude of stars. Seeing them this clearly reminded Draco of Hogwarts, the sky devoid of hardly any atmospheric light and allowing a view of the sky, unlike anything he usually got near London.
,” Malfoy declares, letting the word settle between them as he takes the first sip of his mochaccino. A speck of white foam clings to his upper lip, and Harry can but watch as the tip of Malfoy’s pink tongue darts out to catch it. “While there are certain topics you should always avoid in the initial phase of dating” —
“Yes.” Harry chuckled. “Not at first, but we’ll get there.”
Received: Oh, sod off. I’ll show you how to suck…
to enjoy yourself?”
Draco sighed unhappily but let him go, though not before stealing one final fleeting kiss. Harry already had the door open and one foot on the landing when he stopped, struck by a sudden thought.
Harry’s mouth waters as he roams his eyes over Draco’s bare torso. He can’t wait to explore every inch of Draco’s gorgeous body, memorising every dip and curve with his lips, tracing every freckle and scar with his tongue. He aches to trail his fingertips over every—
How was he supposed to move on and forget about Draco when Draco kept showing up whenever he shouldn’t? When he kept acting so strange and mysterious? When he kept being all sassy and witty and— No, gorgeous wasn’t really the right word.
Draco wanted to hex the man. “Yes, well, he’s changed his mind, obviously.”
“I asked him for a boyfriend for you,” Teddy repeated with a shrug, as if it was the most natural thing in the world. “Can we have that ice cream now?”
"Then yes, of course I trust you. Please, Draco."
And what had he meant, he’d heard good things from other sources?
His heart started pounding as soon as his gaze landed on the sender’s name on the screen.
“You seem tired,” Harry observed, concern evident in his voice.
Still panting, Harry accommodated Draco’s exploration by tilting his head to the side. “Then why…don’t you —
-Harry
Draco scowled. “No. My favourite belt, the blighter. You’re right, though; he shouldn’t be kept in a flat. I’ve been considering buying a house in the countryside with a large plot of land so he could run when he wants to without worrying about cars and such.”
“—then I saw Uncle Harry kissing Santa Claus.”
“Yes, well, sorry about that. I don’t know any short but tall, blond but dark, slim but burly men. But if I happen to run into one, I’ll make sure to give them your number,” Draco added with a wink when Harry finally looked up. Harry opened his mouth to speak, but Draco quickly turned his attention back to Molly. “In the meantime, what about Ginny? Don’t you want to find a nice bloke for Ginny?”
“Yes…?” Harry hissed, nearly arching off the bed as Draco flicked his tongue over the sensitive nipple.
Believe it or not, I actually didn’t intend to be ‘cryptic’ about the creator behind the Sectumsempra curse. And I assure you there’s no need to start preparing for a murder mission as the poor man is already dead. Well, even if he wasn’t, I’m still quite sure you wouldn’t want to kill him, no matter how many wicked curses he managed to create in his life. Because I know how much you liked him, how much he liked you. I’m sorry, but there’s really no easy way to tell you this. The curse was Snape’s.
you see?”
Something soft and warm and refreshing runs along the top of Harry's thigh. "I'm going to take care of you. I'm cleaning you up, and then, if you want, I thought I might draw us a bath in that delightfully large tub."
a ridiculous name. If you really want to know, I got it from your middle name… So no, not intended as feminine at all. I don’t doubt you’re a man, Malfoy, I really don’t. And if it irks you so much, feel free to go ahead and name my inner snake at any time. I’m curious to know what you’ll come up with.
Draco usually made a show of teasing him about those wrinkles, pointing out his old age (even as Draco was, and always would be, eight weeks his elder). Secretly, though, Draco loved those wrinkles, maybe even more than the sprinkle of silver at his temples. They spoke of a full life seasoned with joy and laughter, a reality none of them would’ve even dared to anticipate twenty years before.
Sent: Okay, first tell Pansy she's dead to me. Second, I have no favourite Gryffindors. I hate them all equally.
Harry snorts. "
“Whoa, wait a minute,” Sirius responded, finally dropping the act. “I
But what?
“But that’s why I’m here, right? To teach you how to do it.”
“Did you?” Harry tilted his head to the side. “Miss your parents, I mean.”
“Maybe…” Draco pursed his lips in thought and Harry’s eyes were helplessly drawn to them like moths to a flame. “I could probably persuade him if you…”
Unable to stand it another moment, Draco reached over to where he’d laid his cloak, picked it up, and as the room started to break out in exclamations, he made his way back down the aisle.
Starting today, he would simply refuse to let it govern his life any longer. It was the perfect timing too, with Draco leaving the country for several weeks. By the time he got back, Harry should have managed to shrug off this rose-tinted illusion of possible romance and return to his bloody senses, right?
“What? I wasn’t—”
. I distinctly remember buying it from this charity auction about a year ago.”
“I’m just saying,” Arthur’s voice intruded, booming yet powerless to break the eye contact between them, “that if rubber ducks don’t do anything, they should come with a disclaimer.”
His hands move in unison, bringing pleasure to each in tandem. He refuses to lose himself to his own strokes, though, instead concentrating on Draco's pleasure. With each bob of his head, he manages to take Draco a little further in, a little deeper, and the sight of Draco above him, his head falling back in pleasure, the moonlight bouncing off his pale blond locks, his parted lips pink and swollen from being ravished, brings Harry closer to his peak.
“Merlin, I miss them so much.” The dog let out a low whine and dropped its chin onto Draco’s knee. Draco smiled down at it and stroked his palm over the silky soft fur on its head. “All of them.”
Harry stills in Draco’s lap and lifts a hand to brush a lock of blond hair from Draco’s sweat-slicked forehead. As he does, he watches Draco’s eyes flutter open, dazed grey pools of want blinking up at him beseechingly.
Saturday 2 October 1999
“Oh, right.” The amused huff came with an audible eye roll. “As if any man in history has ever managed to figure out the workings of a woman’s brain?”
Harry can barely comprehend any more than that. Wings. Everything else — Draco standing bare-chested in the cold night air; his pale skin glowing in the moonlight, literally glowing — is all secondary.
“A long time ahead, yeah. So I trust you not to go around showing this to all and sundry, all right?” Draco nodded absent-mindedly, head still swimming with everythi—  “I’m serious, Draco. No one can know about this, or our conversation. Not your parents, not your friends, not even my younger self.” Harry frowned before adding, “Especially not my younger self. Can I trust you to keep it a secret?”
you supposed to say to an unconscious man? To an unconscious man who you happened to have a major crush on? Charlie looked so peaceful like this, as if he were only sleeping. As if his clear blue eyes might flutter open at any second. Around them, the spells continued to beep quietly, urging Draco to break the awkward silence.
You shrug it off with a wry smile, just like you always do. But before you do, your gaze flits to something behind me, your eyes narrowing slightly at whatever it is that’s caught your attention.
“Really?” I turn to look at you fully, meeting your silver-grey eyes. They hold all the proof I need to know you’re telling the truth, that you’ve made up your mind, that you’re going to see this through whatever may come. “That’s—”
Draco sighed and nodded.
“A year ago,” Draco said quickly. Not a total lie, since that was when he’d started helping more often at the Reserve.
“Oh, shut it, you. Teddy and I did it together, okay, and if you don’t like it, fine, but don’t come here criticising my—”
He turned on his makeup lamp and applied the eyeliner he saved for special occasions, the dark lines drawing attention to his grey eyes and making them look smokey. He stepped back to take in the whole package he’d just assembled.
Draco looked back up at Harry, the delight of victory filling his chest, but Harry only looked uncomfortable as everybody in the room turned to him expectantly.
“Oh, Draco…” Harry’s voice sounded strained, and when Draco looked up to meet his gaze, he nearly drowned in the wild swirl of emotions visible in Harry’s deep green eyes. “You make it sound as if it wasn’t a big deal; do you even realise how fucking brave you are?”
Harry chuckles
“So, how did you end up working at the Wheezes? I always thought you’d do something more…”— He looked for a word that wouldn’t come off as offensive, but drew a blank. —“well,
“But I—”
Draco’s mouth twitched at the corner, begging for permission to curve into an amused smirk. “Is that so?”
Buckbeak. Hagrid’s hut, that you set on fire just before I caught up with you and Snape after Dumbledore was killed. Even the trophy room, to which you once invited me to a wizard’s duel but later proved to be too much of a coward to ever show up. Every bathroom in the castle.
Draco knocked on the door to the office of Weasleys’ Wizard Wheezes at exactly seven o’clock that evening. He’d finished the muffins as planned, and with enough time to spare to allow him to clean up the kitchen and change his clothes. Granted, a shower would have been nice, but tardiness wasn’t something he generally tolerated, not even his own.
Sent: You want me? For what?
“No, thanks.”
“I hate you,” he said again, his voice now nothing more than a weak and tired mumble against the warm skin on Potter’s neck.
“And you saved him?”
“You don’t have to—”
Under his feet, the stairs are littered with small feathers blown down from above. He’s unable to make out their colours in the darkness, but they remind him of something—something important.
Worst part was, I couldn’t explain to them why. Not that the explanation I gave them wasn’t the truth. It was. But it was only half of it. I told them I needed some peace and quiet, to be able to think a proper thought from start to finish without being disturbed or interrupted. It’s almost impossible to do that around here, and it’s even worse at the Burrow. People everywhere, moving, talking, doting, caring. Don’t get me wrong, I love them all deeply, but to be honest, I’m still not used to it. Not like Ron and Ginny are. They’ve grown up with it, they take comfort in all the hustling and bustling in a way I don’t know if I’ll ever be able to. I can certainly enjoy it — Who doesn’t love being surrounded by a loving family? — but it usually doesn’t take more than a few days at most before my brain is about ready to explode.
I tense up at the sudden sensation of gentle fingertips stroking up the length of my forearm, playfully caressing my bare skin, eliciting goosebumps I’d rather live without. The man is still murmuring next to me, his mouth now close enough for his hot damp breath to tickle the sensitive skin behind my ear. Before he can get any more ideas, I pull my arm away from his probing touch and reluctantly turn my gaze from the dancefloor.
Over the month they'd been out of school, they'd figured out the appropriate charms to allow Harry to fly with Draco more easily than their first attempt. A combination of Sticking Charms and Weightless Charms did the trick — currently combined with an array of Disillusionment and Notice-me-not Charms — and now Harry was able to fly comfortably with his mate, Draco's secure arms tight around his waist.
marry him —  and
Draco’s eyes widen at the implication and Harry smiles, ignoring his racing heart. “You deserve more too, you know,” he continues, recalling Draco’s words; his rambling apology. “You’re trying to make amends, to be more than what your father raised you to be. I feel like I already know you from the dreams, but I want to know you for real too, Draco. The real you. I want to know you, and remember.”
It took another hour before the reply came, the phone’s unexpected vibration scaring Draco half to death as it resonated through the wood of the nightstand just as he was about to switch off the bedside lamp.
I hope you and Lucy will have a productive week.
— ☕ FRIDAY ☕ —
Even now, long after he’d realised that Potter — that deceitful, lying bastard — had only been playing with his head that night, those words still stayed with him. No matter the impossibility of the statement, no matter the extreme levels of bullshit Potter had been feeding him that night, those four words still managed to ground him whenever his life seemed to be slipping away, whenever his burden felt too heavy to carry.
If I only knew…
“You’re welcome.” Harry gave him a wry smile and did his best to ignore Draco’s impossibly long eyelashes.
— : { o } : —
He can’t remember who took the photo, but he’ll never forget the night it was taken. Theo’s pre-Christmas party, seven months ago.
“Got hexed often on your shopping sprees, did you?”
Draco stood at the window, looking out over the rain-drenched mountains that surrounded the Reserve. It was cold, and wet, and miserable. And he was stuck here. Alone. On Christmas.
“Yes, you are. And that’s okay.” The man sounded so kind, not a trace of disappointment in his voice. Only concern. And empathy. Tension seeped from Draco’s body, even as he felt the man inch closer. “You’re allowed to be nervous about going away. Almost everyone is the first time they’re about to board that train. In fact, my son is just as nervous as you are.”
Each session will consist of bite-sized, easy-to-digest chunks from both elements, repeated as needed as ‘practice makes perfect’. And, since they have a lot of ground to cover in such a limited time, Malfoy insists Harry makes time to meet with him on a daily basis until the Master deems his Apprentice ready for the ‘real thing’.
what they want.
“Oh, fuck yes.” That was exactly what Draco had been craving, the missing ingredient to make this rich, luscious blend go from amazing to sublime. Harry’s hard length rubbing against him, his tight fist meeting their every thrust, hot and slick, chasing them both to new, dizzying heights.
Harry’s eyebrows rose. “And you’ve kept it this long?”
“Draco! Wait, I’m sorry! I didn’t mean to tell everybody!”
Harry settles against Draco’s firm body, breathing in his addictive scent. His heart is still racing, his mind still trying to make sense of what’s just happened, and for some reason, he can’t stop smiling.
You say it casually, in a hushed voice and with a playful twinkle in your eye, but I know the significance of what you’re saying. We’ve talked about it before, the distinct possibility of them disapproving of your sexuality, of them expecting you to disregard it, to hide it. The possibility of them disowning you if you insist on staying true to yourself.
Lifting the sheet, Bill peeked underneath, then back at Draco. “Are they as enjoyable as I’ve heard?” he asked, amusement audible in his voice. Draco felt the flush rising on his cheeks, thankful that the man didn’t seem to expect an answer before dropping the sheet and continuing. “Can’t say that I’d have that done myself, but Draco’s right, and it looks relatively new. It’s all shiny and stuff.” He realised what he’d said and chuckled. “The piercing, that is.”
Ernie looked up as Draco stood. “Are you stopping by the Foundation? I have the monthly staffing papers for Pansy.”
Sirius wasn’t
You really think another dose of my sloppy hungover writing would be able to off you? If I only knew my words were that powerful; I should have struck up a correspondence with Riddle years ago. Thanks for the tip, though. I’ll keep it in mind for the next time you infuriate me enough to make me want to go over there and strangle you in your sleep. Death by grammar; now wouldn’t that be something?
“I— You don’t— Why?” Yeah, because Harry is eloquent like that.
Sent: What in Merlin’s name are you wearing?
The burn is sharp, stretching Harry around Draco's girth, and when Harry winces, Draco stills, letting his mate get used to the feeling. It's a lot. Harry knew it would be, but somehow, he didn't realise it would be quite so much.
a secret that’s all mine, you know.
“Good. Now, give me a twirl, will you?” Harry does what he’s told, feeling Malfoy’s eyes on him like a scorching flame as he does. “That’s it, Potter. No more oversized t-shirts or baggy jeans for you.”
Potter’s voice was dry and made Draco immediately defensive. Fighting his reaction, he took a deep breath, schooled his features, and turned. “Harry.”
“Please…”
“I’m sorry, sir. We seem to be fresh out of those today.”
Draco stops again and Harry's skin tingles as feathers begin to caress the contours of his face, trailing whiffs of caramel and citrus in their wake.
“Can I see?”
“I do, actually,” Harry said softly, his voice kinder now as it reached out to Draco in the dark. “But you’re not alone; you have Charlie.”
That doesn't keep me from being curious about whether you'll be able to pick it out of the crowd, though...
“I am,” the man —
Harry’s barely out of the shower when the green flames of the Floo roar to life in his living room. He blinks at the unexpected caller as he kneels in front of the hearth, making sure to keep a tight grip on the towel wrapped around his waist.
Harry’s brain simply refused to cooperate, leaving him to fight his rambunctious emotions alone. Draco was here, standing on his doorstep, and Harry didn’t know what to— He swallowed, reminded himself he was a Gryffindor, and croaked, “Then, I guess you’d better let him in...”
“Huh?” Harry hummed another line of the song. “That one? I don’t know the words. It’s something Sirius is always humming. He says it’s a tune from his childhood that always gets stuck in his head. Apparently, one of his cousins used to play it a lot.”
Draco winks, easily catching the raspberry cupcake Harry throws after him.
. All of them. Molly and Arthur, the siblings and wives and kids. Ron and Hermione, because Merlin, I didn’t know they could be so nice. And Harry and Sirius. Well, not Sirius. He already knows.”
You’re on your way to a date. A date with a cute guy you haven’t been able to shut up about for days. I should have seen this coming from a mile away, and yet, for some reason, I haven’t. For some inexplicable reason, I haven’t prepared myself for this; for you getting out there, searching, dancing, flirting. Dating. For you eventually finding someone. Someone that’s not me.
Sent: What if I’d rather you were on the menu? Your arse did look especially delicious in those jeans.
. He would do it. He
Sirius leaned in and lowered his voice so only Draco could hear. “Molly hasn’t been quite as steady after losing Fred in the war, and when we found out about Charlie’s accident today, we were really worried how she would be able to handle it. She was a right wreck on our way over here, but finding out that Charlie has someone he loves, someone who saved him from a literal dragon? Well, I think it saved her, too.”
look the part. Every last inch of him. Not that Harry had met too many Santas throughout his life — the Dursleys had seen to that — but Draco was the spitting image of how he’d always pictured jolly old St Nick. A cute blonde toddler was sitting on his lap, giggling at something he’d just said, and Harry had to remind himself how to breathe.
Harry shot her a pointed look and ran a hand through his hair, clearly frustrated. “Something isn’t right, Hermione. He’s obviously up to something.”
Harry led him several feet away and used his wand to erect a Privacy Charm around them. The murmurs of the room dimmed and the surrounding guests grew foggy, as though looked at through frosted glass. Draco could still make them out, though, and it seemed the entire room was looking on in interest.
Draco usually didn’t care much for half-arsed undressing during sex, but there was no way he’d break their skin-on-skin action now just to wriggle out of his pants. Not that it mattered much. Those pants were all but forgotten the moment Harry draped his legs around Draco’s hips and thrust up against him, their hard cocks finally able to come together with no barriers separating them.
It was adorable, really, the confused hesitation. Draco, who was a decent bloke these days, decided to put the floundering Lord of Ineloquence out of his misery.
Now it’s Harry’s turn to roll his eyes, only to sigh in defeat when Orion mutters,
“Wait,” he panted against Draco’s lips. “We shouldn’t…”
Saturday 4 September 1999
Ginny looked on, her voice quiet. “Is he going to be okay?” Her picture was regularly featured in the Quidditch section, usually showing her latest dramatic play, but sometimes accompanying the latest gossip about her many paramours. She looked older, more self-confident than during her Hogwarts’ days, but Draco could easily recognise her from school.
And speaking of… Yes, Malfoy, I do consider us friends. Don’t you? I mean, we’ve been doing this for over four months now, and I’ve told you stuff I’ve never told anyone else. And unless you’re just keeping this quill-pal thing going as a way to gather information about me to sell to the press at your earliest convenience, I’m pretty sure you’re feeling the same.
so good," Draco mumbles in his ear, urging Harry to move against him — as if Harry needed a reminder. Because honestly, Harry couldn't stop himself if he tried. He's too far gone and this feels too perfect to ever stop. He could die this way and he'd be perfectly content. "So good for me," Draco whispers again, eliciting another raunchy moan straight from Harry's core.
Sent: No, please, don’t…
this wasn’t it. An unyielding metal disc digging its sharp edges into Draco’s left palm told him otherwise.
“True.” Harry nodded, seemingly pondering Draco’s words while taking another sip of his tea. “What gave you the courage to do it?”
The dog tilted its head to the side, and Draco could swear it raised a questioning brow at him. Did dogs even have eyebrows?
He walked as was his habit these days, with a clear goal in mind, always on the lookout but avoiding everyone’s gaze, always afraid anyone who met his eyes would be able to figure out his deepest, darkest secrets. He had so many of those these days, too many secrets creeping up on him from every angle, curling their tendrils around his limbs, entangling him, suffocating him — much like the vines of a lethal Devil’s Snare.
Draco’s hand went into his pocket by instinct, tracing the familiar shape of the silver coin that had kept him going for over five and a half years now.
“HARRY! HARRY — WHERE’S HARRY?”
PPS Am I a horrible person for wanting to strangle my best friend? Not too severely, of course, and not all the time. Just, there’s still an entire month to go before the N.E.W.T. exams are over and Hermione is already driving me crazy.
“Nice try, but no.” Gabrielle’s stern voice had no trouble carrying over the noise of frothing milk. “
The laugh escapes Harry without permission, and he opens his eyes to find Draco’s silver depths peering into his own, his brow furrowed in a way Harry’s never seen on this man’s face before. Draco looks… He looks worried.
“I’ve got…?” Draco prodded.
“Don’t fool yourself, little sister,” Bellatrix snickered, “He is, just like his pathetic excuse of a father.”
“He didn’t even let me say goodbye to Mother.”
notices. Before
“Yeah.” Teddy’s face lit up like a Christmas tree, his gaze inevitably drawn to the bearded man on the podium. “Yeah, I do.”
“H-hello?” Draco’s voice sounded awfully small and vulnerable to his own ears, all breathy and quivering. “Anybody there?”
“But, I—”
Harry swallowed hard and knew he was ready to take that final step. He'd gone down on Draco, he'd been inside Draco, but they'd never done this. Not until now.
“No, Malfoy…” Even without turning around to look at him, Draco could hear the git was smirking. “
Harry, who didn’t want him. Harry, who couldn’t give Draco a reason not to marry Charlie.
The rumbling of Teddy’s sock-clad feet on the steps — how was it even possible for such a small kid to make so much noise? — came to an abrupt halt, and that’s when it came again.
“Nice.” Wood pulled the word out, sounding impressed. “Guess our little arrangement is over then, huh?”
?” He stopped pretending and glared. “No shit. We’ve only been planning this thing for months. Honestly, just the fact that I’m still here and haven’t fucked off to some tropical island yet should be testament enough that I am giving this event the attention it deserves.”
“James?”
I did go to Sunday brunch. Just as you said, it was the right thing to do. But Merlin, it was weird. Don’t get me wrong; it was all perfectly nice and no one broke down crying, just… It just felt like everyone was walking on eggshells, you know, like we all tried too hard. As if forced smiles and strained laughter could ever hide the crushing sadness filling up every inch of that house. By the end of the evening, I was so tense I couldn’t wait to get back to Scotland, and once I did, it took me two hours on my broom before I was anywhere near ready to go to sleep.
“Nngh,” Draco offers and Harry grins, pleased to finally have found a way to render Draco incoherent.
, Harry’s brain cries. It’s almost a week left before Valentine’s; this can’t be it.
I never said I didn’t have the urge to crucio that fucking bastard to the end of the earth and beyond. I did. And I certainly possessed the desire needed to do it, too, had I allowed myself to. But I didn’t. Not only because I was exhausted from a long night of no sleep and too much adrenaline, or because I was so fucking sick of all the fighting and just wanted it all to be over, but also because it felt so fucking good to be able to keep my cool, to rile him up by my mere calmness, to outwit that arrogant shit who thought he was so smart and yet, when it really mattered, understood nothing.
… We’re never—”
“Bloody hell,” Harry gasps. “Do that again?”
Whatever Draco and Teddy had been talking about was cut short when Harry entered the room, Draco drifting off mid-sentence as their eyes met over Teddy’s flaming blue hair. Both man and boy sat up as their cups floated over towards them and Harry took a seat next to Teddy on the sofa.
Draco picked up the time-turner and blew off the dust from its bronze circles, barely caring about the sneezing fit as he turned it in his hands, admiring the way the hourglass’ purple sand shimmered in the lamplight.
Arthur’s voice, usually so soft and playful, was direct and booming for once. “What in Godric’s name is going on?”
You’re dangling a bright green shot in front of my eyes and I realise my mind has wandered off, my gaze still fixed on your pouting lower lip. I blink, feeling heat rise on my cheeks, a poor imitation of the excited, rosy flush colouring yours. Your skin glistens in the light from the bar, sparkling like frost under a bright winter sun, and the amused smile curving your lips reaches all the way to your warm, grey eyes.
“Then maybe you should learn how to hide it.”
Draco wrapped slender fingers around his cup and pulled it close to his face, inhaling the sweet scent of the chocolate. His half-moon glasses fogged up when he did, prompting him to tilt his head down to look at Harry over the frames as he murmured a soft, “Thank you.”
“Well, of course.” Harry grinned. “What did you expect, just lying there all exposed and gorgeous? You’re fucking sex on legs and you know it.”
?” Charlie asked, looking as panicked as Draco felt. “What are you talking about?”
“Come on in,” I say, moving aside to let you pass before closing the door behind you. “I’ll put the kettle on.”
Draco shook his head at her theatrics. “Yes, well, I’m high in calories so you’d probably better refrain. Listen, I’m on my way out, so… Did you need anything, Slyvia?”
“But it’s…”
Yet, here he was, caught up in the moment, all common sense vanished, as always, in the presence of this irresistible man. It was all so good, so fucking perfect, and still, Draco wanted more. Needed more.
He straightens up in Draco’s lap, keeping the steady rhythm of his hips as he takes in Draco’s dishevelled state. His brow is furrowed and his jaw clenched, his nostrils flaring around a shuddering breath. If it weren’t for the pleased noises and the feel of Draco’s erection thrusting against his own, Harry’d almost think the man wasn’t enjoying himself. He is, though, he definitely is, and Harry is suddenly overwhelmed by the surge of emotions in his chest.
. In fact, he’s the worst friend ever. Surely, no good man would lust for his best friend or fantasise about doing devious things to him, in the shower or otherwise. No good man would sit here, drinking tea with his flatmate while secretly longing to lean in and kiss him, or heck, just hold him. Maybe cuddle him a little before falling asleep in his arms?
“Good.” As Harry relaxed, he noticed the unmistakable prickle at the nape of his neck telling him he was being watched. Glancing towards its source, he was unsurprised to find Draco’s warm, grey eyes studying him over thin-rimmed half-moon glasses. Draco raised a bushy white eyebrow in question and Harry gave him a reassuring smile, ignoring the pixies in his stomach as he turned back to Teddy. “Now, do you remember what you had planned to ask Santa for?”
I gulp, nodding. “Yeah, always.”
Aww, there’s the prat we all love to hate. Phew, what a relief! You know, I was a bit concerned there for a while after reading your first letter, but I feel sooo much better now that I know you’re still you, and not some overly courteous impostor or mind-altered shadow of the good old Malfoy I once used to know.
Feeling very pleased with himself, Harry smirked and returned to his task, placing the last cup in the plate rack before turning off the tap. He reached for a towel to dry his hands and when he next chanced a glance Draco’s way, the man was looking pensive. Not wanting to be caught staring, Harry busied himself with wiping off immaculate counters while he waited for Draco to sort out his thoughts, intent on letting him be the one to eventually break the silence between them. When Draco did, his voice was soft and hesitant.
This close, Harry can see delicate spines of silver threading through the pale feathers, reflecting the light. He slowly extends his arm, giving Draco time to pull away before he bites at his lip and runs a trembling finger along one of the beautiful feathers.
They made it inside and Harry even had the awareness to cast a one-way Silencing Charm on the door before returning his attention to his… friend? Guest?
“Well, I guess that’s something, at least; one point for Gryffindor. Now, where were we? Yes, don’t speak with food in your mouth,” Malfoy continues with a pointed look that makes Harry’s cheeks grow hot, “open the door for your date and pull out their chair, replenish their drinks and walk them home at the end of the evening. Are you with me so far?”
Godric, this crush was getting more pathetic by the minute.
Draco moans when Harry settles in his lap, straddling him without ever breaking their scorching kiss. This new position is way better, because now Draco is right there, right in front of him, right under him, gripping Harry’s hips with both hands, thrusting up against him as if on pure instinct alone. Harry’s fingers get entangled in Draco’s long, damp locks, pulling his head back to expose that glorious neck for Harry’s questing mouth.
Draco laughed, letting out a little snort that he hoped Harry didn’t notice. “Isn’t she? Slyvia’s my upstairs neighbour. She’s just a little over the top sometimes.”
Harry and Janie had come in at half ten (not that Draco was keeping track), and they’d both been deeply immersed in their studies ever since. Janie had placed their orders, just as usual, and Harry hadn’t texted him once. It was as if the last week had never happened, and by the time Lady Grey and her husband had entered the shop for their weekly fix, Draco was all but convinced The Note, and everything related to it, had only been a creation of his wildest fantasies.
Draco had come last night — all the way from France. He had sipped hot chocolate with him and Teddy, had admired Harry’s Christmas tree and later kissed him in the kitchen. And then they’d… Harry’s arse clenched at the memory.
“Sure. As long as you keep away from the water.”
“One almond scone and a green tea, please.” The forty-something woman barely looked Draco’s way while placing her order, already scanning the room for possible seating options.
“Yes… Good idea…” This time, Harry turned properly to open the door, biting his lip when he felt Draco’s hot breath on his skin as the man leaned in to nuzzle his neck.
“It is to the dragons who need you. And you’re always kind to people, stopping and smiling and saying something nice, even when you’re in a hurry.”
Satrrday
I know she’s right. Of course, she is. It’s only a question of time before someone else notices, before
family. What do you think I should do? Should I go tonight and keep pretending, or should I ruin everyone’s Christmas, again, and tell them the truth?”
Draco gulped, remembering his words to Molly.
“You’ll see me tomorrow, right? In Diagon? Or are you planning on giving Teddy a broken heart for Christmas?”
to see.”
“I guess we’ll find out tomorrow.” Harry was going for cheerful, but it ended up rather strained and a little breathless. Hopefully, the jovial smile he plastered across his face would be enough to divert Draco’s attention.
. And it’s not like you’ll be gone forever.”
. The only thing worse than a customer not knowing what they want? A customer who knows
, Draco observed, decidedly ignoring the twitch in his pants.
Concern. And worry. That’s what they convey. Mixed with a desire so fervent it sends a shiver down Harry’s spine.
“Always,” Draco murmurs, “leave them wanting more.”
“You have feelings for someone?” Draco sounds surprised, intrigued, but not nearly as gloating as Harry had anticipated. “Who?”
His rational voice, the one that still insisted on sounding like Snape, tried to remind him of his initial concerns. What if Harry really was out to get him? Draco had no means of knowing what the man had in store for him tonight. Who in their right mind would agree to go alone to an unknown address, entering their old nemesis’ private den?
Teddy didn’t seem to listen, though, and Harry did his best to keep up with him, almost tripping over his own feet as he sidestepped a little girl who was clutching her mother’s hand tightly.
Harry broke the silence that followed, clearing his throat. “Right, well, Charlie, I’m sure you’re tired and need some sleep, so maybe we should all leave you alone for a bit.” He walked over to Charlie and leaned down, giving the man a casual one-armed hug as best he could with Charlie still laying in his bed. “Good to have you back, mate.”
“Er… No, I guess…” Harry frowned, taking a few steps closer even though he probably shouldn’t.
You remember Fred, right? George’s twin brother? Well, he died that day, in the final battle, like so many others. We all grieve him, of course, all in our own way, and Molly’s still devastated by the loss of her son. But as hard as it is for her and the rest of the family, it’s a hundred times harder for George. He hasn’t been himself ever since, as if he’s lost a limb and can’t figure out how to function without it. And why am I telling you all this? Because, over Christmas, all everyone could think of was Fred’s absence. With everyone gathered under the same roof, it became so horribly obvious that he wasn’t there, that he’d never be there again. The others seemed to be consoled by each other, comforted by their relatives’ presence. I only felt like I was intruding on something private, although they all assured me I wasn’t.
our letters, but the truth is, for some reason, I still haven’t. I probably should, shouldn’t I? No, don’t answer that. We’ve already been over this once and I already know the answer. It’s just, with the entirety of wizarding Britain considering me and every aspect of my life fair game, I kind of like having one tiny part of my life that no one else knows about. Not that I wouldn’t trust
Then he feels it. A pulling sensation in his chest, like a rubber band constricting, urging him to get up, urging him towards…
The queue moved slowly, creeping along the front of the podium, taking them towards the small set of steps in the other end where a charming elf greeted the children as they arrived at the last stop before their long-awaited final destination — Santa’s lap. Harry briefly entertained the idea of going up there himself, wondering how Draco would react if he were to saunter over to him and casually sit down on his lap. The thought made him all but burst into a fit of giggles.
Bill Weasley cleared his throat. “I think we’d all like to hear about that, actually. How did you and Charlie meet?”
“Okay…”
Draco’s eyes flash and he leans down, looking as though he’s going to drop his lips to the same spot. Harry holds his breath, not daring to move.
, and I know it’s only a matter of time before this whole illusion will come crashing down around me.
“You enjoy being just anybody?” Harry’s emerald eyes twinkled with curiosity.
“Wait—”
Hannah gasped. “Fred.”
“You alright?” I say softly, barely loud enough to make a sound and still seemingly too loud in the silent room. Your arm is hot under my palm, your bicep tensing only for a fleeting moment before it relaxes again under my light touch.
Your humble liege,
“And you just eat it like that; slice on slice?” Arthur asked, curiosity sparkling in his pale blue eyes.
Harry’s heart melts just a little at her offer, and his budding irritation evaporates in a flash. “No, thanks, I’m fine. Don’t want to risk it getting too hot for Orion. Now go back to sleep, ‘Mione. Sorry if I woke you.”
Pansy peered at Draco over her tea, so he ignored her and kept petting Smaug.
Sent: You need to be more specific, Potter.
A time-turner. No,
What he refused to concede, however, was how much it felt like coming home.
Draco nodded, not trusting his voice to cooperate.
“But he’s so fun to tease,” Bellatrix all but sing-songed. Tease, in this case, Draco knew, meant torture. With Crucios. For fun. Because, yes, that’s how fucked up that woman was. “And besides, you must agree he could use some serious character-building. He’s seventeen, for darkness’ sake, and still relying on his mother’s protection. That coward is going to need all the backbone he can grow.”
Draco —
Harry cracked then, and his chortle was just as infectious as always. Draco stood no chance.
He was so good at this, urging people to improve themselves by opening their minds to things they hadn’t previously considered. And if they opened their purses to charity at the same time? Well, that was the entire point of the evening, wasn’t it? That was why Pansy needed him.
“And now this. I didn’t mean to mislead your family, just… When Hannah said I was your fiancé, and everyone looked so shocked… I’m not sure why, really. I mean, I’m rich and good looking, why shouldn’t you want to be with me? But then I realised they actually believed it and things just snowballed so quickly. Your brothers were hurling questions at me, and Ginny looked ready to hex me if I upset your parents — I’ve been on the end of her bat bogey hex before and do not want to be there again — and then Sirius told me about your mother, and Hermione looked ready to drop her baby any second, and I just couldn’t do it. They all looked so hopeful and happy.”
And fuck, but Draco wanted to believe him, wanted to trust him, but… How the hell was he supposed to do that when every fact, every rational reasoning pointed to the contrary? No, he knew Potter was wrong, knew Potter had lied to him, again. And yet, Draco had let Potter lead him on, had let himself believe — if only for a moment — that what he said could be true. That it would, in fact, be okay. Eventually.
Just like Hermione will eventually have to accept that Kreacher is back with me at Grimmauld Place. (Actually, I think she was more upset about that than me secretly exchanging letters with you for eight months.) Apart from her disapproval, though, I think his presence has actually improved the situation here, just like you said it would. I almost never feel compelled to leave the house anymore — well, except that time last week when I, with a string of expletives, punched my fist to the wall of the second-floor landing after accidentally stumbling on the stairs and almost breaking a toe — and I can’t say for sure, but I think there are other changes going on as well. If there are, it’s all too subtle to put a finger on, but I can swear the place feels brighter somehow, more welcoming. And I might be imagining it, but I think the air feels easier to breathe.
"Harry," Draco gasps. His hand falls into Harry's hair and his wings begin to move over Harry's skin. No longer able to stand the pressure, Harry drops his free hand to his own groin, palming his throbbing erection through his jeans. With a bit of wriggling, he manages to open them and push them down, just far enough to let his cock spring free. With it in his left hand and Draco's in his right, Harry proceeds in his endeavour.
He sighed and took a seat in the chair beside the bed, looking down at the burnt hand laying out on the sheet. Charlie already looked better than he had in the paddock, the skin beginning to heal. Draco cleared his throat as Hannah stepped out of the room.
“No, I… I’ll be back after New Years, I promise. Mark my words, two weeks together with Mother is more than enough.”
Harry pulled the silk scarf from his face and took it all in. The sun was low in the sky behind them, but they were staring out at the sea, their view uninhibited by any buildings or people on either side. They appeared to be entirely alone, the nearest signs of humanity the little speckles of houses they could see in the distant cove.
“Yes, Sirius Black. The first man ever to escape Azkaban, aka Potter’s godfather, aka my last living relative, who seems just a tad crazy compared to his cousin, my aunt. He said that Molly almost lost it after her son died in the war and that when they heard about Charlie, she started acting strange again. But then she learned about me, and apparently, the news distracted her enough to get back to normal.” He winced and took another sip of his tea. “And as for Hermione, well, you should see her. She looks like she’s about to drop a baby any day now.”
And if that reason turned out to have messy raven hair and vibrant green eyes, Draco really didn’t want to think about it.
PPS What’s wrong with Lucy? He’s a part of you, after all, and I thought it’d be fitting for him to be named after you. Would you prefer Snuffles? Paw McClaw? Fluffy Meowington?
Received: Got it from Parkinson. She says hi btw
He watched the girl hurry back down the hallway and set the bag down, looking around for the only person he could blame for this situation.
Draco stood outside the door, stunned at the turn of events, unable to make his brain function.
The wind and the rain drowned out any other sounds of the surrounding wildlife, and the lack of people made the usually busy Reserve feel eerily abandoned. On a regular day, it would not only host the dozen dragon-keepers that worked and lived on the premises, but a decent amount of support staff that alternated in through the week, visiting groups of students eager to learn about the dragons, and the random visitors that had to be monitored while on the grounds. It rarely felt this desolate.
Molly looked satisfied at winning a point and turned back to Draco, her face melting into a soft smile. “Draco, dear, what drew you to our Charlie?”
I wasn’t expecting to see you tonight, had just settled in for a quiet evening in front of the telly when Michael Aspel was suddenly interrupted by the doorbell. There was a brief moment when I contemplated ignoring it, unable to think of anyone who’d pop by my flat unannounced like this on a Sunday evening. After all, I just came home from the Burrow an hour ago, just back from spending the day with most of the people who are otherwise prone to come over. And even if you entered my mind — not that you ever really leave it — I never thought you’d be the one I’d find on my doorstep as I left my comfy couch to answer the door.
“Yes,” the man chuckled. “I don’t know how I’ll survive without him, but I wouldn’t let him miss it for the world. Starting Hogwarts is still one of the best things that’s ever happened to me.”
The silence in the room was deafening, but Sirius broke it by letting out a long whistle. “Well, fuck me.”
Draco felt a chill run through him, and his eyes stung alarmingly. He ignored it, scowling. “Yes, well, if you know me so well, then what
since we first met, you’ve been nothing but a calculating, conniving bastard, and now, here you are, suddenly talking about stuff like desire, devotion, lust, and passion as if they
“I hate him,” Draco spat, gripping the sink with both hands as he stared himself in the eye. He stood like that for several long, defiant moments before he capitulated to his fatigue, letting his head fall forward as a fresh bout of tears threatened to burst forth. He wasn’t strong. He wasn’t resilient. He was a weak fucking coward, a worthless failure who didn’t seem able to stop crying.
“You helped, you know. You work nearly as hard at this as I do, and I don’t even pay you.”
Received: Zabini? When the hell did he become a lion?
Also, Cotton! Excuse me, but I’m not sure I’ve ever seen a more adorable cat in my life. He looks so content sprawled out like that, no doubt enjoying the warmth of the sun better than any human ever could. And the name, Lord Cotton Candy? (That’s American for candy floss, isn’t it?) I’d say three-year-olds should probably be in charge of all pet naming procedures from now on. You think I could get the Wizengamot to sign off on a stipulation like that?
So Draco does. It's only the work of a few moments to banish their shirts to a windowsill in the corner, the cold air hitting Harry's chest turning his nipples into hard pebbles in no time. Draco kicks off his shoes — he prefers to fly barefoot, Harry's learned — then gathers Harry close and pulls them both to the open ledge. Harry wraps his legs around Draco's waist and notices Draco's wings unfurl, feels the feathers brushing his neck, but he can't look away from the serious grey eyes just inches from his own.
Sent: Two-letter word. Very useful.
Harry was waiting on the other side, and he held out his hand as if to steady Draco when he emerged. Draco took it, standing up straight, but his confusion must have been visible because Harry shrugged.
I open my eyes and squint up at the man towering in front of me. He’s barely more than a silhouette against the bright sun, but I can still make out the smirk curving his lips.
Luckily, the universe decided not to embarrass him at this time, sending him a much-needed distraction in the form of his godson.
Harry’s eyes had dropped to Draco’s hand, though, and he ignored the question. “Is that an invitation?”
Malfoy turns to give Harry an inscrutable look. “Er, yes.”
Except… it is.
Charlie lit up and a brilliant smile stretched across his face. “You saved her.”
Draco’s heart tore a little at that, but Harry was right. He wasn’t an expert. “Yeah, well, spending two decades with them hasn’t made you one either.”
“Draco,” Sirius said as they approached the lifts. “I think I’d like a cup of tea. Would you mind joining me? We can just go up to the tearoom?”
PS No, I don’t actually think you’re useless, Malfoy. I’ve already told you how much that spark of silent defiance meant, not just to me, but to the end of the war.
This time, the reply came almost instantly.
“So, what do you say?” Harry’s mouth quirked into a playful smile. “Ready to leave the past in the past?”
And hadn’t that been the worst of it all, that intoxicating pride he’d seen in Potter’s eyes that night? Draco should’ve known it wasn’t real, that it was only pretend. Pride like that didn’t exist in the real world; Draco was aware of that now. He’d been searching for it his entire life, after all. Dreamt of being deemed worthy of it, by his father, his mother, his teachers, his teammates. Only Uncle Sev had ever come close, and even then, it had only been because he was better at Potions than his abysmal classmates, an accomplishment that really wasn’t much of a feat.
Mother didn’t speak up against her sister often. Not that Draco blamed her; Bellatrix was… intimidating, to say the least, and more than a tad volatile. That Mother defied her now, on his behalf, made Draco’s heart swell, even as fear for his mother’s well-being surged through his veins.
Draco smirked. “Look closer.”
Harry frowns and bends down to pick one up. It’s larger than the others, nearly twice the length of his hand, and something encourages him to raise it to his nose. Caramel.
Draco’s heart leapt.
“Of course I did, every fucking day.” Draco still remembered the long, sleepless nights that first year with no one but Fayette to keep him company. “Just because you had a shitty childhood and no family worth its name to be homesick for doesn’t mean nobody else did.”
“Draco?”
“Charlie?”
And now, if Potter was dead, it meant that… his older self would never exist. Because, Draco finally acknowledged, they were one and the same. His sworn school nemesis, the constant pain in his arse, was the same person who’d comforted him as a frightened child, the same person who had dried his tears as a despairing teenager. This younger version of Potter may not ever have cared for him, but the older one did. Always had. He’d given Draco hope; had made him believe this nightmare would one day be over. Had given him faith it would turn out okay.
“Yes, I am.” He took a deep breath and stood. “Now, if you’ll excuse me, I have to finish up everything I can for next weekend so you won’t need me much this week. We might not be taking a honeymoon right now, but I’d like to take a few days off with my new husband.”
“So, you’re coming to the celebration tomorrow, then?” Ernie asked without lifting his gaze from his own paperwork.
Harry’s mouth twitched, amusement twinkling in his emerald depths. “Guilty as charged.”
He touched his fingers to his lips.
“Don’t worry about it,” I say, even as I know you will, no matter what I say. You’ve always been a proud man, and to suddenly become so dependent on another person’s benevolence will surely take some getting used to. “Now let’s get you into bed. Do you want me to fetch you a sleeping draught?” You nod silently and follow me towards the spare room. “Good. You’ll need all the sleep you can get; I reckon we have a lot to do tomorrow.”
to see, but he’s suddenly terrified of what awaits him up there.
He only hoped the man was all right.
“Oh, aren’t you just wonderful?” Harry looked up at Draco, his green eyes piercing. “He gets around really well for only having three legs.”
“Bullshit,” Ginny yapped, unaware of the way her mother’s eyes widened at the word choice. There were children at the table, after all. “You hate it when a man is taller than you, Harry. Or too much shorter.”
says on the phone.
Draco tilts his head to look at him, grey pools of inscrutability catching Harry’s gaze from the corners of his eyes. Harry counts five unsteady heartbeats before Draco finally speaks.
“Well then, let’s get walking.”
“He said it wasn’t that painful,” Ernie continued, seemingly misconstruing Draco’s reaction. Thank goodness. “Can’t say I’d like to have a bar through my knob, but evidently, blokes and birds both love it, so I guess he thinks it’s worth it.” Ernie used his wand to send a copy of next week’s dragon-keeper schedule to the wall where it stuck in place. “According to Charlie, anyway. It’s been quite the crowd-pleaser, to hear him tell it.”
However. “So,
PPS I hope the Ministry owl doesn’t call too much attention to itself when it arrives to fetch your letter later today. (Because it should be clever enough not to fly up to Scotland, right?) I’m not sure I’m up for the Weasley Inquisition Squad to pounce on me today.
What he needed was to see people, to erase this lonely lethargy of lamentation.
She let him go and patted him on the cheek. “Come on, now. Help me set the table?”
“Pizza?” Malfoy sneers in disgust. “Really, Potter? What is it with you and fast food?”
Esmeralda and I wish you both a pleasant week.
No, muggles in general aren’t cold-hearted, towards their own blood or otherwise. But I guess all societies have their rotten eggs, just as some pure-blood families find it fit to disown one of their own for something as innocent as falling in love with a muggle-born…
Leaving Hogwarts was kind of bittersweet, though. It’s the first and only real home I’ve ever had so it’s going to take a while to get used to the fact that I’ll not be going back in the autumn. Sure, I’m welcome here at the Burrow, and I probably should start calling Grimmauld Place my home one of these days, but they’re not the same. Don’t think they ever will be.
Then he turned, left the room, and headed for the lifts. He had an old movie, a glass of wine, and a fox waiting for him at home.
“Prince Albert?”
“Cool!” Draco enthused, instantly feeling nothing but, once he registered what he’d just said.
Harry chuckles. “Yeah, I heard.”
“I need to…”
They’re magnificent. Shimmering in the pale moonlight, they reach nearly nine feet wide on each side, the largest feathers similar to the one Harry found on the staircase on his way up. The same heady caramel smell wafts over Harry again, stirring his body’s interest.
“Pardon,” muttered a middle-aged woman who rammed him with her shoulder, too busy perusing the shopfronts to look where she was going.
“Well,” Draco said, opening the box, “this is it.”
“What’s…?”
“Well, aren’t you a well-behaved little guy?” The owl let out a little hoot of agreement as Draco untied the scroll attached to his leg. He fetched an owl treat from a ceramic bowl on the sideboard and held it out, watching as the owl grabbed it in his beak and flew away.
“Can you feel that?” Harry asks, amazed. “I barely touched it.”
“Oh. I—” Harry threw a glance in the mirror and felt his eyes widen.
Draco studiously avoided Harry’s sculpture, unable to bring himself to look at it. All over the room, people were talking about it, mentioning Harry’s name, chattering about the raw beauty of the sculpture. With every mention, Draco’s chest tightened and his smile became more forced.
If only it were as easy to speak openly to the conscious one.
Harry returns to the view, contemplating Malfoy’s words as he watches the constant stream of tiny people moving along the streets below. He wonders what it means that Malfoy decided to take him here; if he’d anticipated an awkward silence to stretch out between them — just to give Harry a practical example of his point — or if he actually thought them ‘compatible and comfortable enough’ to enjoy it. Thing is, the current silence doesn’t feel uncomfortable at all, and when Harry eventually decides to break it, it’s solely out of sheer curiosity.
“Only because you kept buying them for him,” Ginny added in, laughing. “You told me you did it to annoy Lily.”
I never thought of it that way, but yeah, now you say it, I guess I was a bit like a house-elf to them, albeit without the no-clothes rule and the magically enforced self-punishment routine. (Maybe that’s why I found it so easy to sympathise with Dobby?) Yeah, they did have me cook for them almost daily, basically from the day I was tall enough to reach for the things I needed to make myself useful in the kitchen. I usually ate with them at the table, though, if I wasn’t locked up in my cupboard or, later, my room. I didn’t do all the cleaning, just the heavier stuff my aunt couldn’t be bothered with, and she didn’t trust me with the dusting. (I think she feared I’d break some of her gaudy knick-knacks if she ever let me loose with a feather-duster in her house.) I did the laundry too, and most of the gardening, although, that wasn’t much of a burden since it was nice to get out in the fresh air where Dudley usually preferred not to go and therefore left me alone.
PPS Okay, I cave. We need to talk about these ridiculous euphemisms of yours. You know writing stuff like ‘what the shell’ and ‘leave the duck alone’ makes you sound like a preschooler, right? Or a toddler’s parent. If anything, it reminds me of how Andromeda talks whenever Teddy’s around. Is it part of your haughty upbringing, not being allowed to curse or something, or are you just being snotty on purpose, to rub your refined superiority in my plebeian face?
Stepping into the letter room, Harry’s eyes are inevitably drawn to the door leading out to the roost. It’s open just a crack, and through the gap he can discern the subtle movement of something light in the surrounding darkness, something shimmering like stardust in the pale radiance of the moon. A large wing, nearly six feet in height, obscuring the view of a man standing in the window, overlooking the grounds. Harry can’t see the man’s features, but he doesn’t have to. He already knows his name. He’s read it on the map.
And yet, here Harry was, enduring it all…
Harry swallowed, powerless against the flush rising on his cheeks. “Y-yeah, I know. He told me… I’m…”
Draco’s frown grows deeper, his eyes filled with concern. “Who says there’s going to be heartbreak?”
Tonight, though, his book still lay next to him on the side table, silver-rimmed reading glasses on top, flanked by an untouched cup of tea. He was in no state to concentrate anyway, thoughts running in every direction as the clock counted down towards the inevitable.
The air was cold and crisp, nipping at Harry’s cheeks as he strolled across the snow-covered lawn with a grumbling Malfoy by his side. The others were already approaching the top of the hill, a vibrant splash of colour against the glittering white backdrop.
Don’t you have any music to listen to, at least, or does your record player crave magic too? I wish I could send you other things too, not only letters. If I could, I’d send you some muggle music to liven up your days. Or would you have preferred Celestina Warbeck?
“I— I don’t think that’s a good idea,” Harry argued, stepping closer and getting into Draco’s space.
Draco chanced a glance at Harry. He hadn’t said a word since they’d all entered the room nearly an hour ago, and although he was surrounded by family, he just looked so…lost. Draco wanted to comfort him, to reassure him Charlie would be fine. Because Charlie already was fine, wasn’t he? Both Draco and Sirius knew that. And now…
agree this is surreal; you asking me to pick out your clothes. “Just pick one.”
Perhaps he was most confused by Sirius’ silence. The man had known the truth all along, had encouraged the lie and sworn he would help fix the situation, but where was he now? Why had he abandoned Draco?
Harry’s pull towards Draco — like a tether.
“And watch out for snakes!” Harry calls after him.
Harry chuckles. “No, that won’t be necessary.”
“Huh?” Harry frowned, seemingly thrown by the unexpected topic change. Draco couldn’t really blame him; he’d probably suffer from mental whiplash too, had the roles been reversed.
And with that, he was gone.
Draco nodded. It made sense.
Strengthened by the notion, Draco smiled. “Hello to you too.”
Harry didn’t know what he wanted more; to find out what they were saying about him or remain blissfully ignorant. He decided on the latter as he witnessed Teddy saying something that had Draco choke on his breath. Whatever had come out of the boy’s mouth, it certainly didn’t bode well for Harry, at least not if Draco’s sideway glances were anything to go by. Harry did his best not to squirm under Draco’s inquisitive gaze and stubbornly refused to acknowledge the intriguing blush that spread over Draco’s high cheekbones as he tried to recover from his sudden coughing fit. He looked absolutely adora—
“Circe, that was…” Draco pants, resting his head atop the back of the couch, his face turned towards the ceiling.
Knowing Lucius, the prideful head of the Malfoy family is probably a lost cause at the moment, but Harry still holds out hope for Narcissa. He’s witnessed the love she harbours for her son, and if it was strong enough to make her lie Voldemort straight to his face, Harry figures she’d be capable of doing almost anything for him.
“And this is a problem because…”
“The twin, yeah. I just… I can’t

And all through the night, until I’m safely back in the privacy of my bedroom, I keep the walls from falling down.
Next thing he knows, they’re kissing again. It’s messy, all wet and urgent and absolutely brilliant. Harry’s hands are back in Draco’s hair, tugging at Draco’s silky locks to secure the perfect angle. Draco complies without hesitation and moans into Harry’s mouth, a most delicious sound that Harry can but swallow greedily.
, Harry’s brain dutifully reels off — “you should always be honest. You should always strive to show yourself for who you are. Otherwise, you’re just setting yourself up for disappointment later. Don’t try and be perfect—”
Harry frowned. “And this is the right moment?”
Molly tutted, her voice scolding. “You just don’t know Draco, Harry, dear. You’re imagining the boy you knew in the war. This young man is perfectly lovely, and quite attractive too.” Draco thought he might blush at her words but concentrated on keeping his breathing even, not wanting to betray his eavesdropping. “It’s no wonder Charlie loves him. You’ll see.”
“Now, there’s a thought.” Malfoy takes a sip of his wine while Harry splutters, lost for words as he looks between the two of them. “All right, Potter. Here’s a proposition for you. It’s four weeks until Valentine’s Day. How about, during this time, you’ll date me? I’ll study your moves, give you practical tips for improvement, and teach you all there is to know about successful dating.”
The smell of the wings — the light caramel scent Harry associated with his beloved long before he knew his identity — is heady, and the cock now in front of him suddenly seems larger than it ever felt wrapped in his hand in a dark classroom or broom closet. It's pale and pink, and Draco is looking down at him, eyes dark and intense as he awaits Harry's next action, making it easy for Harry to let his instincts take over, stick out his tongue, and taste.
“Right,” Ernie said, amusement dripping from the drawn-out word. “Last time, he came back with his cock pierced and was showing it off to the lads down in the hatchery.” Ernie grinned. “Got a glimpse myself, actually. Very nice. And the piercing wasn’t bad, either.”
The dog cocked its head, listening in the same way Smaug usually did, and Draco let out a little laugh. “Tell you what. I’ll sit right here, and if you come over, I’ll share my sandwich with you. Maybe your family will come back looking for you.”
“Draco?” Barely more than a whisper, low and husky, and utterly delicious. Draco’s fists tightened around the bunched-up sheets on either side of his head, clutching the soft cotton for dear life. “Are you—”
“Sure!”
Draco raised his eyebrows in question. “And what did you expect?”
Gryffindor Tower, Hogwarts
The sound that emerges from Harry's chest is incomprehensible. It's loud and needy, and he'd be terribly embarrassed if this wasn't so.
Harry started to babble. “Wait, anyone could know that by just sleeping with Charlie. That doesn’t mean they’re engaged. You know how Charlie…” Harry cut off when Sirius hit him with a Silencing Charm, his mouth still moving.
Draco doubted it’d be as easy as Sirius professed, but he didn’t have it in him to argue the point any further. At least for the time being. “So now what?”
The thoughts had swirled around in his mind the entire night and most of the morning. He’d found himself staring at the shower wall for Merlin-knew-how-long or chewing a bite of his breakfast until there was nothing left to chew, his mind unable to focus on what he was readying himself for.
Sighing, he turned and made his way into the hall and adjusted his jacket in the mirror before opening the door.
sorry. I should have told you everything from the start. I should have told you all, and I’ll never forgive myself that—”
“Oh, I—” She pursed her lips, frowning. “Maybe jam?” she ventured, as if Draco held the answer to her unknown desires. “Or cream cheese? I don’t know, I—”
“Draco! You made it. Here.” She shoved a glass of chilled white wine into his hands. Draco estimated she’d had at least a couple of those herself already, at least if her loud and boisterous voice was anything to go by. “Now, please tell me you’re going to relax and have fun tonight.”
Seriously though, I felt like a fucking prize animal at a cattle market, and honestly, I don’t know if I’ll ever be able to stomach having to go through anything like that again. Do you really think they would try to make me?
For some reason, the scolding voice in his head always sounded just like Professor Snape. Draco unclenched his jaw and schooled his face into an amicable smile before turning back to the counter with Ginger’s drinks.
Draco watched a smirking Sirius enter the room and walk over to the bed. Once there, he sobered and put his hand out to rub at Charlie’s foot.
I guess ‘technically’ I could’ve written this letter earlier in the week.
The pile of fox puke greeting him by the door as he entered his flat was disgusting, and now, it was stuck to the sole of his shoe. His Italian leather shoe.
perfectly capable of being considerate when he wants to be.)
“No?” Harry turned a sceptical eye towards Draco where he stood leaning against the counter only a few feet away.
“You think?” Harry could tell Draco worked hard to make it sound casual, but the uncertainty was still detectable underneath.
. Whoever he was.
They’ve already agreed to stay away from the wizarding world, neither of them ready to instigate the commotion being spotted together dating would doubtlessly cause. But Harry had no idea Malfoy was such a Muggle-savvy man. Not only does he handle pounds and pennies like a pro, but he knows how to talk with Muggles without causing suspicion. He can easily blend in, navigating trains and buses and even the ticket barriers on the Underground.
“Sure.” Malfoy turns to face him fully and Harry readily mirrors the action, ignoring the town far below. “Take a place like this, for example; the London Eye. Thirty minutes trapped in a limited space is a surefire way to kill the buzz if you suddenly find yourselves with nothing to talk about. So, if you haven’t met before, always make sure to provide the possibility for either of you to retreat, if only to the loos, should the need arise.”
“No, but seriously,” Harry said a few moments later as he tried to regain control of his features. “Put like that, it does sound scary as fuck. Do you think that’s what Sirius is going through too?”
He dropped his head in his hands, uncaring of the way he was crumpling the invitation still in his grasp.
, Harry mused as he entered the sitting room with three steaming cups floating in front of him. Draco was still handsome, though, with all those perfectly trimmed curls and his long, lean legs stretched out like that towards the fireplace. He looked so content where he sat in Harry’s favourite armchair, as if there wasn’t another place he ever wanted to be other than in Harry’s sitting room. Draco looked like he belonged.
“Smaug?” Draco called. “What are you doing?”
His heart sped up the instant he caught sight of the messy mop of raven-black hair in the doorway. It had been twenty-four hours and seventeen minutes since The Note had first touched his skin; The Note that was currently burning a hole in the back pocket of his suddenly tighter-than-usual, black trousers. Piercing emerald eyes found his, and Draco had to look away before he made an absolute fool of himself.
“I’m not—”
Harry blinks. “Y-years?”
“You know, I had plans to contact you then.”
Hannah, the traitor, was fully in the room now, deftly pushing aside the family members so she could get to Charlie and change the bandage on his arm. “And I don’t know if they told you, but Draco saved his life.”
“What’s wrong?” The slight tremble in Draco’s voice throws Harry for a loop. He sounds so insecure, so unlike the confident and sassy man Harry knows so well. Harry has no idea what to do with that fact right now. Trying to gather his thoughts and scramble them into coherent words is hard enough as it is, what with Draco’s delicious scent surrounding him like this.
Harry paused and stared. “You help run a charity?”
you.” Charlie shook his head. “Amnesia. Crazy.”
and begins to rummage through his trunk. As long as Ron didn’t take it the last time he slipped off with Hermione, it should be right— “Found it!”
Draco rolled his eyes. “If I am, it’s only because you take my breath away.”
“I can’t! He’s going to tell them the truth, and they’re all going to hate me. Merlin, I wish Sirius hadn’t talked me into waiting. I can’t do this. I
“I have absolutely no idea. I have amnesia.”
“Draco,” he says quietly.
His heart was still racing ten minutes later when Teddy was all tucked in; his stomach still fluttery as he whispered, “Sweet dreams, cutie cub,” by the door. His knees were still weak as he descended the stairs, unsure of what awaited him down below.
Potter’s eyes narrowed, and Draco watched with trepidation as the man opened his mouth to speak. But then Potter hesitated, seemingly coming to some sort of internal decision before taking a deep breath. “Congratulations on your engagement,
He would never be able to recall who leaned in first. Maybe neither of them did, maybe both. It was as easy as magnetism; natural, instinctual, unstoppable; as if — now that they finally allowed it to happen — their very cores acted as opposite magnetic poles, attracting each other, drawing each other in. Draco’s lips were soft and warm and delicious, gentle at first, feather-light, brushing over Harry’s so fleetingly Harry almost couldn’t believe this was actually happening. That he was actually kissing Draco Malfoy. After all this time.
But for fuck’s sake, Malfoy, you're such a bloody tease. You can’t just mention you draw too and then go straight on to saying you won’t show me. Of course I’d want to see! Especially now, after having heard proof of how artistic you are. What do you usually draw? Would you at least tell me that?
The panic in his voice caused several people to turn to look at him, but Harry only had eyes for the five-year-old boy in the red-and-green-knitted hat and scarf currently running away from him. This was one of the reasons he avoided the crowds whenever possible; the not-so-exaggerated fear that something would happen to any of his loved ones on his watch. It was enough to have to experience it in his nightmares.
Draco chanted to himself.
Harry stepped in and with a smile, wrapped his arms around Draco in a perfectly acceptable, friendly hug. “See, a hug is simple,” he said over Draco’s shoulder. “It involves arms, and people, and caring. And sometimes a little squeeze.” His arms tightened demonstratively around Draco’s torso. “If it’s Molly, it also involves something inherently maternal, but I don’t know how to do that one.”
Harry rubs his hands against his jeans, his palms suddenly and inexplicably sweaty.
He smiled. “My favourite; I remember that. Thanks, Mum.”
They sat down at the long table and when Molly joined them, everyone began to eat, the conversation flowing around them like a rising tide.
Gryffindor Tower, Hogwarts
The jazz club Draco took him to tonight was about the swankiest place Harry’s ever set foot in, and the cocktails they’ve been drinking have made him tipsier than he’s been in quite a while. He knows those conniving things are nearly pure alcohol, but it’s hard to keep that in mind when they taste so sweet and look so pretty. Also, it’s easy to lose count when your thoughts are occupied elsewhere, like with the pleasure of your company, his glorious wit, his ravishing looks.
Saturday 29 May 1999
“What does it look like? It’s a wedding invitation. I hope you’re free tomorrow.”
He moved to undo the buttons before pulling Draco's trousers and pants down in one swift move, then sat on the bed to kick off his shoes. Draco groaned when Harry leant back, shimmying out of the rest of his clothes before scooting back on the bed, meeting Draco's heated gaze.
Draco walked up to the cottage and crossed the worn wood of the porch in three long strides, passing the rocking chairs that always looked so welcoming. He jumbled the keys around, looking for what might be the correct one. On his second try, the key fit and he slipped inside.
Draco twirled around and strode back towards the office building where he’d be able to Floo home and put on his pyjamas. And then maybe he’d have a good cry over a carton of ice cream and a cuddle with his fox. Because fuck Harry Potter.
The dog barked happily, letting its tongue loll.
“Yes, well, that’s probably for the best, yes. And I’ll have you know that my arse is perfectly delightful. How dare you not have noticed?” Trying to distract from the blush and not caring that he was playing just a little bit with fire, Draco twirled so his back was to Harry and clenched his arse.
After all this time holding back, this sudden, unexpected nearness is outright intoxicating. Every fibre of Harry’s body is aching to touch, to taste, to feel — but he knows he shouldn’t. Not if it could ruin what they already have; the unlikely friendship they’ve finally found in each other after everything.
With only one week left before the end of the term, they really shouldn’t let anything distract them from their studies; Harry knew that, even without having Hermione mentioning it in every single letter she sent. Yet, when Goyle pointed out how lovely the grounds looked all dressed in white, sparkling in the sun like a luxurious wedding gown, Harry couldn’t help looking up from his Potions essay.
He smiled and rung up the order, offering the credit card machine for her to pay just as a cheerful jingling had him glance over to the entrance.
“You…?”
They weren't expecting any company. All the people Harry knew had places to be, friends and family to be with. Moreover, if any of them had indeed decided on a change of plans, they’d use the Floo, right?
“How fortunate,” Draco purred, his eager wet mouth never leaving Harry’s skin. “Would’ve hated to come all the way from France just to walk in on you with someone else…”
Teddy had come to a sudden halt, and Harry was
Draco narrowed his eyes at Sirius who refused to look his way, instead finding something on the back of Harry’s jacket to brush off with rapt attention.
“I’m not wearing any pants.”
Harry's heart melts a little at Draco's quiet words. "It's already so good," he whispers.
"Well, that would be unfortunate. But it's my birthday, and I'm waiting for you to fulfil your promise."
Draco was once again thankful for his upbringing, the ability to hide his reactions second nature to him. Internally, though, he was reeling with the shock of seeing Potter —
“Nah, but it happens. George and Ron usually take care of it, but… Well, George is the expert anyway; I’m mostly here to assist, making sure nobody distracts him and helping clean up the shells after he finishes. It can be dangerous to do it alone.”
Draco missed whatever Ernie was saying as the door slammed shut, cutting off the sound. Hurrying across the grounds, Draco scolded himself for not checking the bag sooner. Or checking with the other keepers. Or
It was all so unfair. His life had been far from easy lately, but he’d managed. He’d been able to stay strong, to carry on, to work on his task, and he had actually thought it was okay, that he’d be able to see this through. And then Potter popped by without warning, after five and a half years of radio silence, and just expected Draco to believe him, to trust him.
Draco shuddered at the memory of the Dark Lord barging in on their quiet evening, outraged by something (Draco still didn’t know what), throwing Bombardas in every direction until the room and everything in it had been transformed into nothing but shards and splinters and rubble. The house-elves had later been able to restore it to its former glory, thank the stars, but the memory remained. A dull ache of dread buried deep in Draco’s core.
“I’m not—”
“You mean to tell me there’s someone out there dressed as San—”
Draco promptly pushed the thought aside. “Well, if you’re going to wear your coat like that, we should get inside. We can’t have your delicate Gryffindor nature taking a chill.”
How was he supposed to love this? Leaving his home, leaving everything he knew, for a murky old castle all the way up in Scotland — which, for all he cared, might as well be on the other side of the earth? Just because
Thirty minutes later, Draco was ready to scream. Harry hadn’t outright accused him of anything, but he was consistently fishing for information, trying to trip Draco up.
“Then repeat it to me, please...”
Whatever that meant.
Harry nodded. “It’s easier to get along with challenges when you don’t know anything else. It’s harder to lose something once you know what you’re missing, though, isn’t it?”
Harry felt his cock harden at the thought, and Draco must have felt it too because he let out an intriguing little groan and nudged into Harry's hips with his own.
— and, if you find yourself as smitten by their work as I am, do remember to shower them with all the love and affection they deserve in the chapters' respective comments.
“You guys are the absolute worst.”
Harry’s smile widened, deepening the crow’s feet at the corners of his eyes. “Thanks.”
at first sight. I mean, look at them. Charlie loves a good shag, and Draco’s pretty enough to catch his eye.”
Oh, and I almost forgot. Guess what happened last week when your letter was delivered to me at Andromeda’s? Andromeda got one too, from her sister…
My words get stuck in my throat, hindered by the lack of oxygen in my lungs. Apparently, I’ve stopped breathing at some point, probably when my body realised the tip of your nose is only a few inches from mine, and for some reason, I can’t seem to figure out the mechanics of inhaling and exhaling anymore. Instead, I smile, hoping it will convey the support I’m currently unable to articulate.

“Check,” he ground out as he strode past her for the umpteenth time. His body was exhausted after days consumed with work and several restless nights, yet he wasn’t able to sit down for more than mere minutes at a time. So he paced.
For some reason, that didn’t help Draco’s nerves any. It was the same thing he’d assured Draco for three days now, and things still weren’t cleared up.
Love bites. So many love bites. It practically looked like he’d been mauled by a wild beast. He probably should have been appalled by the sight, but for some reason, Harry found that he wasn’t.
Accepting the situation for the time being, Draco shrugged and took the canvas bag of things from the witch. It wasn’t her fault things had got cocked up. Yelling at her would solve nothing.
I don’t have the first idea how to go about earning a house’s trust, though, so any helpful pointers you might have to offer this clueless friend of yours would be most appreciated. I still have a couple of weeks left here before I plan to take the erumpent by the horn, but with your reassurance that the miserable state of the place might not be permanent, I’m feeling a bit less reluctant to at least give it a try.
“I didn’t say that.”
She leaned back on her hands with a cat-like smile. “I know that. But do
With no waiting customers in line, Draco finally allowed himself to slip his phone out of his pocket. He seldom received texts other than from his boss to confirm details in his work schedule, or colleagues begging to switch shifts for one reason or other, but this time, it was from someone else entirely.
The room fell quiet and all eyes turned to Draco in unison. It was a rather comical sight, reminding Draco of a pack of meerkats on the lookout. It might have even made him laugh, had he not been genuinely afraid half the people in the room wouldn’t hesitate to attack him if given half the chance.
Narcissa didn’t counter her sister’s dig at her husband, but her momentary silence spoke volumes. “Well, since Draco isn’t here, how about you join me for a nice cup of tea in the Purple Parlour instead? I think the elves just made a fresh batch of those cranberry biscuits you like so much.”
Lucy is
And, he’s a Veela. And—
Trembling hands notwithstanding, Blondie managed to make it over to their table without drama. Draco followed her with his gaze until she was sat across from her girl, knee bouncing under the table as she placed her purchases between them with a hopeful smile.
“Indeed. It
And they were. The room was stock full of his siblings, though all of the spouses and children had chosen to stay home this time. That still left nine people, plus Draco.
It’s all so peaceful, Harry’s just about to doze off when his makeshift pillow suddenly starts trembling under him.
Each ornament Draco lifted off the tree, he wrapped carefully and placed back in the box. These decorations had belonged to his mother, and some of them they’d purchased together in their travels. It was the main reason Draco loved decorating for the holidays so much; it was like having his mother back for just a little while every year.
prissy twats, then do’nt. If you want to choose your own wife, do it! If you want to marry for love, just fucking do it already!
"You like that?" Draco asks with a satisfied smirk. "You like it when I hit your prostate, huh? Merlin, you look so amazing like this, falling apart so beautifully for me."
Every piece of it, every moving trinket and spinning child absolutely screamed
“Anything else?”
PS You think I have ‘striking emerald eyes’? Is this your wistful inner poet talking, Draco, or have you been sneaking down into the wine cellar again?
the final battle, nothing’s the same at the Burrow anymore.
On the kitchen table, Harry’s Quidditch Monthly lies half-covered by Draco’s Potions Review and their latest tenancy bill. Along the wall above the counter, their favourite mugs hang side by side on their designated hooks, Draco’s rainbow-striped ‘Earl Gay’ design somehow complementing Harry’s white on black ‘Smells Like Tea Spirit’ perfectly. Fixed to the front of the fridge is Teddy’s latest work of art, a colourful mishmash of shapeless scribbles bestowed upon them both as a joint gift during their latest visit to Andromeda’s.
As he quickens his pace — suck, lick, swirl, swallow — Draco gets louder, crying Harry's name, his wings unconsciously expanding the closer he gets to his climax.
So he stays.
Malfoy sighs and shakes his head, exasperated. “It’s loud,” he says, raising one long, slender finger as he starts ticking off his mental list, “which doesn’t encourage conversation. The lighting is much too bright for anyone to feel attractive. The vegetables were overcooked, the waitress is a walking perfume factory, and this table is unbalanced. Want me to go on?”
Never did he think that world would one day come looking for him.
“I-I didn’t.” As if Draco still were a naive eleven-year-old. As if he didn’t already know the truth. “Please, Draco, I swear…”
“Yeah.” Harry smirks. “Yeah, I did. Just getting ready now.”
After all, I am nothing if not stubborn.
“Must be nice to finally get some time to yourself, eh? To have me out of your hair.”
“Well, I accepted it for Charlie, too, but look at him now. Draco, honey, it’s made me so happy seeing another one of my chicks finally settling down.”
Orion lets out a hiss of irritation and Harry just knows that if he could, Orion would currently be treating him to an epic eye roll.
“Then—“
. Scrambling for an effective defence, Harry huffs a strained laugh. “As if I’d ever tell you that.”
“Sure, he does.” Just then, a small, grey and black tabby cat emerged from Charlie’s bedroom and rubbed along Draco’s leg, trying to get at the food in his hand. Draco grinned and leaned over to pick it up, brushing past Harry to enter the kitchen area. “This is, uh, Mushu,” he made up on the spot, remembering a Muggle film he’d watched a few years back.
Charlie’s fate rested in Draco’s hands.
Received. Where then?
Draco perked up. “I’ll make the House team?”
“I can’t believe you’re still here. I thought you’d be fed up with all the attention by now.”
Sent: It's the only explanation I can come up with for your mangling of the English language.
I can’t take my eyes off you.
“George, the owner of a fucking prank shop, told you I was pregnant — and you believed him?”
The head of Draco's prick is softer than Harry expected it to be as it connects with his tongue. He wraps his hand around the base and runs his nose along the length, nuzzling it and leaving a trail of soft, wet kisses as he goes. Draco's whimper encourages Harry to run his tongue along the foreskin, licking and sucking, unhurriedly following the vein that runs along the bottom of Draco's cock, back to the end where he sucks the knob into his mouth.
Fleur sighed and wrapped herself around Bill, laying her head onto his shoulder. “Was it love at first sight?”
Sirius ducked in right after him but managed to avoid Draco. When he met Draco’s eyes, however, he grinned, shrugged, and then mouthed,
Merlin.
Friday afternoons were never busy at the coffee shop. People had other things to worry about; family dinners, weekend trips, pub crawls, club night preparations… Not that Draco knew much about any of that, but he’d heard enough from his colleagues over the years to get the general picture. Sure, he was no stranger to the gay club scene, and he usually enjoyed it once he went out, but it wasn’t exactly a regular occurrence in his life or anything. The physical need for a hookup seldom overrode the comfort of a quiet evening at home, after all, and as for the rest, well, it wasn’t like Draco had anyone to experience any of that with, was there?
“One decaf mochaccino and one chai latte, please,” the willowy blonde said, fiddling with the wallet in her hands.
Just as he turned around, reaching for one of the shop’s black signature cups — adorned with the gorgeous logo Luna had helped him design, an ethereal silvery-blue Patronus in the shape of a classic teacup and saucer — Gabrielle slid up to him, apparently back from her break.
“Shh,” Draco admonished, looking around him at the staring eyes of the other patrons. “For Merlin’s sake, Sirius.”
Draco gulped, hoping Harry didn’t detect the shiver running down his spine at Harry’s words. Because that’s what this was; Draco could attest to both the yearning and the feelings. And Merlin, the bodies, too. Harry’s body pressed tight against him, warm and solid and perfect. His own, tingling and needing and wanting. His own, that was starting to show inappropriate interest in the current situation, blood rushing south in preparation for—
Draco felt his face flush a bit. “Well, can’t set your recovery back by having you feel too sorry for yourself, now can we?”
Draco hit the send button and swallowed. This was madness. Complete and utter madness. Yes, he
Confused, Harry pulls down the neckline of his jumper. “What do you mean?”
“Harry?” Draco is suddenly right next to him, his cool palm cupping Harry’s cheek, gently forcing Harry to meet his worried eyes. “What’s the matter?”
What the fuck was Draco doing here? Why wasn’t he where he was supposed to be, with Narcissa and Andromeda? And why the hell had he shown up dressed like this, wearing his Santa costume? Why did Draco always insist on being so weird and unpredictable? If he’d only been able to behave like a normal person… It would have made him so much less intriguing and irresistible.
Harry’s cock sprung free and… damn, Draco’s mouth watered at the mere sight of it. Hard, flushed and leaking, its base surrounded by a patch of dark, curly hair, it seemed to reach for Draco much like a love-sick teen begging to be kissed. Draco happily obliged. Leaning in, he licked the bead of pre-come from the slit and moaned as the erotic taste hit his tongue.
“Er… yeah. Did I…” Draco frowns. “Is this an inopportune time?”
at a party of Slyvia’s. As far as he knew, not a single one of them had gone by without the Muggle police being called to the building for some reason or other. “I’m really sorry, but I have plans.”
. And yet…
Godric, what would people even think of me if I dropped out? Becoming an auror is the next logical step for me, the only logical step. What if I don’t manage to do it? What if I don’t want to do it? Everyone expects me to land my dream job, the only one I’ve had since the moment I learnt auror’s even existed. What would they think of me if I don’t make it happen now that my dream is finally within reach? What signal would that send to all the post-war hopefuls? Don’t hope, don’t dream, don’t pursue your goals? I can dislike my fame all I want, but there’s no denying the impact my decisions and choices tend to have on the public. No matter how much I wish it wasn’t so, it comes with a responsibility, and at the end of the day, I guess I just don’t want to let everyone down.
Draco could barely breathe, waiting for Bellatrix’s response. Out of all things about his aunt, her unpredictability was what scared him the most. Her constant whims made it impossible to anticipate her next move, her mind just as unpredictable as a box of Bertie Bott’s Every Flavour Beans.
Being the professional he was, Draco refrained from rolling his eyes. At least out loud.
I guess I shouldn’t be mad at you for assuming I would get back together with Ginny, though. Everybody seems to have expected I should. But I haven’t. At least, not yet. Ron still thinks it’d be a great idea, and maybe it would. I mean, we’re practically family already, and unlike most other girls, she knows the real me, the real Harry.
It takes two hours and several cups of whisky-laced tea until you speak again.
Harry could feel Draco’s hot, ragged breath ghost over his hypersensitive skin, alerting him to just how close Draco’s mouth was to where he wanted it to be.
“Hey, Draco?” Harry asked, walking back into the kitchen area. “Wow, it looks great in here. I’ve been coming to Charlie’s for years, and I don’t think I’ve ever seen it like this.”
Sent: Who knows what nonsense you might get up to.
Draco tastes sweet, but like nothing Harry could ever describe. He tastes like…well, Draco, he supposes, and the notion is making him dizzy. The feel of Draco’s tongue brushing against his own, learning the contours of Harry’s mouth, has Harry craving to do the same. Reaching up to wrap his arms around Draco’s neck, Harry pulls him closer and pushes back into Draco’s mouth. It’s hot and wet and eager, it’s lips and tongues and teeth, and the intimacy of the give and take, the push and pull, makes Harry want so much more. Running on instinct, he moans and pushes his hips forwards, prompting Draco to gasp and pull away.
The fox yipped, then puffed up his tail and followed the branch that extended across the room to the window perch where he often liked to sleep.
“Of course, you do. Blame it all on me if you have to. I can take it.”
“Potter, what the hell are you talking about?” He didn’t sound breathless. He didn’t.
"Not yet," Draco says, capturing Harry's mouth with his again and taking away what is left of Harry's breath. His unconcealed hunger is intoxicating as he greedily laps up every moan and whimper escaping Harry's throat, kissing Harry like he'd never need air again. He pulls back after a moment, panting as he lets his forehead drop to Harry's. "You're still too tight. I don't want to hurt you."
You actually don’t know what a shared patronus form means, do you? Yes, in its original state it represents the caster’s innermost personality, but as it happens, it can change. If the caster falls in eternal, unchanging love, it’s not unusual for their patronus form to change to match their loved one’s. Yes, Snape was in love with my mum, probably ever since before they went to Hogwarts, and once Riddle threatened to kill her, he went to Dumbledore for help, swearing loyalty to him as a way to try to save her. It’s astounding what you’re willing to do for the ones you love, isn’t it?
Blinking his eyes open, he had a moment to wonder about his state of undress and the unusual clammy heat before he noticed the… — Harry frowned — …the weight of an arm thrown around his waist?
“Look, Uncle Harry!” Teddy’s excited voice tore through Harry’s thoughts, his beaming smile evaporating every trace of irritation in a single heartbeat. “There’s the tree!”
“He’s not here, Bella.” Mother’s voice this time, as calm and level as always. “And even if he were, I wouldn’t let you touch him.”
Sent: No, Potter. I don't know what you want for your birthday. It may come as a shock, but I really don't care. And you’re ruining Mr Darcy's proposal!
What if he was walking straight into a trap? Draco didn’t think that was the case, but what if he was wrong? What if Harry was just playing him? For fun, mortification, or revenge; Draco could only guess. Either option was a viable possibility whether or not he wanted to admit it.
Only one problem, though. Denim. The sturdy fabric meeting him at the small of Harry’s back reminded Draco of the man’s current state of non-undress. Before he’d even made a conscious decision, Draco had rolled them over, surprising Harry enough that he broke their kiss to stare up at Draco, dark eyes wide and chest heaving.
“Harry Potter is dead.”
was pointless.
“Why?” I whine, looking up at him with my best, puppy-dog eyes.
“Yes, but…” Draco closed his eyes and willed himself not to scream in frustration. “Not by accident, you blithering idiot. It takes months of potions and a fuck-ton of magic to make it happen, and even then, it’s rare because adoption is so much easier. Merlin, Potter. Why the hell would you think I’m pregnant?”
In fact — and you do best to keep this to yourself if we’re ever going to get Ron on board — but if I’m being honest, I kind of prefer your friendship to about anyone else’s right now. With you, I don’t have to pretend that everything’s fine and dandy all the time. I can be real with you, brutally honest if I wanted to, spewing my petty broodiness, and I know you wouldn’t disapprove. Not that the others would ever say anything if I did (at least out loud, or at least not to me) and I know they’d listen if I ever needed to ‘talk’, but it’s just… they’re all so happy, and I don’t want to bring them down with my shit. The war is over, the world is safe (at least for now), and everyone seems to be moving on without a hitch. Which is brilliant; they do deserve to be happy. After everything we’ve been through, they’re worthy of a life free of worries and concerns for a while. Besides, they all have so much going on; they shouldn’t have to worry about me too.
“Pans, I’ve covered the last four holidays. I promised Smaug—”
Received: Look to the left. By the bar.
“When are you getting married?”
It’s interesting how you’re always so quick to jump to conclusions about me. Not very Slytherin, is it, to talk before thinking? I thought snakes were supposed to be more calculating than that, more prudent, weighing pros and cons, analysing possible options, all that stuff. Making groundless assumptions sounds more like something a Gryffindor would do, don’t you think? Tell me, is this something you always do or is it only when it comes to me? Should I perhaps be flattered by the special treatment?
“I— No?” Harry squirms, avoiding Malfoy’s intense eyes.
“You know what?” He stalked back to her and leaned over her desk, pointing back at the invitation. “I can. His family is wonderful, he’s attractive, and now he’s asked me to marry him. So yes, I
“Come on, it’ll be fun.”
“And what happened then?” Andromeda asked amused.
“You’re such a bloody goner,” Harry mutters to his younger self before abandoning him to his fate and continuing towards the kitchen.
Draco straightens in his seat and turns to face him. “But Harry—”
Sent: Me? Me what?
A knock at the door eventually spurred him into a decision: the corner near the kitchen it was. It was his flat, for Salazar’s sake; his decision. And it wasn’t like anyone else would come over to see it or question its position anyway.
I will take care of it, I promise. I wouldn’t want to overstay my welcome here, no matter what Molly says. And auror training starts in mid-August anyway, so I figured that’d be as good a time as any to leave for Grimmauld Place. (Even if I don’t look forward to it, like, at all.) But you’re taking the piss, right? You talk about that house as if it were a sentient being or something. You’re seriously expecting me to believe that crap? No, I’m quite sure you just want me to make a fool of myself so you can have a laugh at my expense later, aren’t you? What were you envisioning, really? Me walking around the place trying to talk to it? Maybe caress its walls? Embrace the stair railings? Fondle the doorknobs? Really fucking hilarious, Malfoy. You twat.
Received: Okay, sourpuss, I'll give you a hint. Rawrrrrr 🦁
Harry tilted his head back and closed his eyes to the sun, inhaling the crisp December air and allowing it to fill his lungs with hope and reassurance. He’d make it. In a few week’s time, his infatuation would all be over and forgotten, left in the past, and everything would be alright. It wasn’t the end of the world, after all. It wasn’t even the end of their friendship. Merlin, maybe one day in the future, this silly crush would even seem distant enough to serve as a harmless joke between them. And until then, Harry had amazing friends, an adorable godson, a job that he loved… And Christmas — Harry’s favourite time of year — was just around the corner. What more could he ever wish for?
(See the end of the chapter for
“Your bowl was auctioned off as by an anonymous artist, but it’s Potter’s. I tried to get him to relent on that as I would’ve been able to raise more for the charity with his name attached, but he didn’t want it on there for some reason.” She shrugged and gave him an evil grin. “It still went for more than I’d expected.”
