In the car, Remus sat in the driver’s seat, but instead of sitting in the passenger seat as Harry had expected, Sirius sat in the back with him, encouraging Harry to lay down and use his lap as a pillow. Between the simple comfort of the contact and the gentle, rhythmic feeling of Sirius’ angular hands threading through his long curls over and over, it didn’t take long for him to fall fast asleep.
“It fucking isn’t! C’mon, get up.” He groaned again and dragged himself out from under his duvet, rubbing sleepily at his eyes.
Draco and Harry made eye contact and both lost it, falling against one another as another round of laughter overcame them. They had admitted how long they had had feelings for one another earlier in the day, so it was rather hilarious to know just how obvious they had both been, and also just how oblivious.
Seeing that Teddy was occupied, Molly turned back to Harry. “Now, Harry, love, no one knows what to do at first. But you’ve got us, and if you ever need any help, you know I’m just a floo call away.” She smiled at him and he felt his eyes well up again. As soon as Molly saw the tears form, she was out of her seat and pulling Harry tight against her. “Oh, love, it’s alright. I’ve got you.” She pressed a kiss to his thick hair and he smiled against her shoulder, hugging her back.
“You- you really want me?” Harry’s eyes were damp, and at that so were Remus’.
The pleasantness was broken, however, when in his last period on Friday their defence professor, professor Everglade, announced that they would be learning legillimency. According to him, knowing legillimency would make learning occlumency far easier, and that was something they needed to know for their NEWTs. Immediately the idea of having to learn occlumency again terrified Harry, but when Everglade announced that they would be learning legillimency through casting it on their partners, as there was no way for a miscast legillimens to be harmful, it would simply not work, Harry felt his hands start to shake.
Harry clenched his hands into fists as he turned to glare at the ugly 19-year-old. “What do you want, Flint?” He spat.
"Was gonna happen sooner or later, I guess. We'll have a look now." Harry hung up the phone before waiting for a reply and loaded up the Daily Prophet website. The first link had a photograph of Harry and Draco in Knocturn the day before. He groaned when he saw the "By Rita Skeeter" byline. "Love, apparently Skeeter's outed us."
Draco’s face darkened. “If you want, I’ll go and find them and curse them.”
He practically jumped out of bed, excitedly getting dressed and checking the store location on his laptop before apparating to an alleyway further down the street.
“My son and my husband, both turning against me! The betrayal!”
“I’ll suck your dick.” The boy offered and Harry almost fell off his chair, he startled so badly. Looking the boy up and down, he certainly wasn’t…. against the idea. He’d realized he liked men as well as women when he was thirteen, but he’d never exactly had much of a chance to experiment with it. Most of the boys at St Brutus’ were violently homophobic, and so certainly couldn’t fool around with any of them, and the only other people he even saw were the guards.
He thought to himself, curling up into a ball on the edge of the bed.
“Yep. And yet every time I try to talk to him, I end up acting like a fucking arsehole.” He groaned and dropped his head down on her shoulder, bending his back severely to do so due to their height difference.
“Okay, that’s great. And your plans for your transition? Socially, medically, anything like that, but don’t worry if your answers to that change, its perfectly fine.”
After class, Hermione and Ron followed him towards Remus’ classroom.
“What are you on about?” Harry laughed.
Draco’s heart was pounding in his chest. “I- I love you, too. That’s why-”
“Uh- good morning.” Harry wasn’t quite sure how to greet people politely so early, as he was used to being woken and expected to cook immediately.
“My pun was brilliant, thank you very much!” Draco grabbed the discarded pillow and shifted until he was practically sat on top of Harry’s stomach, pressing the pillow onto his face.
“Move your feet, darling.” She passed him a glass and flopped down as soon as he did as she asked, sighing as he dropped his feet directly into her lap. “Really? Now, tell me how it went, already!”
"Ah, well that's good of you then-" just then Harry ran over and passed Ron a huge pile of clothes, all in pastel colours. He looked down at them bemusedly.
Draco couldn’t hide his smile, and he felt his eyes start to well up. “Thank you.” His voice was soft.
“You’re right, I- I don’t think I’ve changed that much.”
“Goodnight.”
I wasn’t expecting Draco to burst out laughing, but he did. “What?! Harry, no. I’m gay, and she’s a lesbian.” He leaned back against the wall, his head tilted back as he laughed, and I couldn’t stop staring at his mouth- I could see how sharp his teeth were, and I couldn’t help but think that I sort of liked them.
“Dinner’s ready!” Harry called from the kitchen, plating up two servings of spaghetti bolognaise.
“Oh, alright.” Harry nodded, smiling a bit. Draco felt his heart race a little at the feeling of being on the receiving end of one of Harry’s wonderful smiles. “Why’d she kiss you?”
“Merlin, Harry.” Draco put his empty plate and cup on the tray and banished it across the room, turning to wrap his arms around Harry’s neck. “I’m so sorry.” Draco couldn’t help pressing his nose into the side of Harry’s neck and revelling in the fact he could smell his own aftershave over the smoky-sweet smell of Harry’s skin.
“Just wanted to tell you that Harry, here,” He slapped Harry’s shoulder, and the black-haired boy glared at him, his face getting redder and redder. “Thinks you’re the most attractive person in school, and he’s super into you.”
Time turners- back in time, return to point in time with current body
"That's good. You'll be going back to boarding school in a few weeks, won't you?"
“Oi!”
“Yes sir.” Harry nodded. Already this place sounded better and freer than the Dursley’s. he was shocked that he would be given cigarettes… maybe he would take up smoking, who knows.
Draco just sighed and flopped down onto the grass of the pitch, folding his arms behind his head and closing his eyes. “It’s fine.”
“You alright?” Harry’s heavy brows scrunched down.
“You- you want me to live with you?”
People were staring at us in the corridor and I tensed up, stepping closer to him and looking down at my feet. He squeezed my hand and I smiled to myself. Eventually, we made it to the Hospital wing, where thankfully there was no one to stare at us.
Draco smiled, fond and a little amused. “No.”
"Which ones?"
“Fuck off, Smith!” The gorgeous boy sneered, his voice low and drawling.
“Whatever, Pans.”
“Mr Lupin?” A stern-faced Professor addressed him as he walked through the front doors of Hogwarts Boarding School, which apparently Sirius and Remus had forgotten to mention was in the fucking
Platform 9 ¾ was possibly more crowded than Harry had ever seen it, and there were reporters all over the place- they all kept trying to talk to Harry or snap photographs of him, and he had to dig his fingernails into his palms to stop himself from screaming. It was just too much. It was even worse when he got onto the Hogwarts express and Hermione and Ron had to disappear into the prefects' cabin- McGonagall had agreed that the 'eighth year' students who would have been perfects during their seventh year would retain their prefect status, with the exception of Draco. Harry tried to find any of his friends on the train, but it seemed they had all congregated into one cabin- Luna and Ginny, Neville, Dean and Seamus, along with Hannah Abbott and Susan Bones from Hufflepuff were crowded into the seats, leaving no room for Harry.
Once they finally got back up to Remus and Harry’s suite, Draco was smiling and laughing, and Harry didn’t think he’d ever seen anything more beautiful than Draco’s smile. He caught himself staring dreamily and flushed, hoping that Draco hadn’t noticed. He had.
“Real Addams spirit, wouldn’t you say, Lurch?” The man addressed the chauffer, who upon Harry’s inspection appeared almost Frankenstein-esque. Something about his waxy, dead-looking skin and grunting agreement put Harry at ease. “Say, what is your name, pequeño?”
"Ooh! Dray! You could add that to the piney-love song you've been writing about him!"
Remus burst out laughing then, shaking almost uncontrollably as he tried to catch his breath. “Oh my god, Harry.
Once they got up the stairs, Remus led him towards the door at the very end. The suite itself wasn’t as nice as the cottage, but it was close. The same neutral colour pallet and a comfortable looking sofa were evident in the sitting room, and there were 2 doors on the back wall.
Avery was just about to release a litany of near-fatal curses onto Draco when a dark voice came from behind him, “
Nym smiled at him good naturedly and pulled him into a quick hug, resting their chin on his head. “No problem, kid.”
“Yes, that’s good.” Draco pulled the blanket from our shoulders and laid down on the bed, waiting until I was laid beside him, our chests almost touching, before pulling the blanket back over us. I laid my head on his pillow, just looking at him. He really was absolutely gorgeous. His cheekbones were high and regal, his jawline sharp and angular. His eyes, when they were open, were as silver as the mercury we used in potions class, and his lips, currently slightly parted, were perfect and pointed. I could see the white scar up the left side of his face, tapering off just before it hit his cheekbone, that I knew was caused by the sectumsempra I’d hit him with in sixth year- I had apologised to him for that at his trial, and he had assured me it was okay. I reached up my right hand and ran it along the scar lightly, and his eyes fluttered open. “What are you doing?”
"I disagree." Her voice left no room for argument and Draco huffed and sat down beside Harry.
Harry was stunned by this- Draco was unable to look him in the face after his little rant, but Nym certainly wasn’t, and given how easy Harry was to read, it was clear to see that he was crushing hard on her cousin, and they couldn’t help but start to plot a few different ways to try and get two of their favourite boys together….
Draco snorted. “I’d be an idiot to take that bet, we both know he’ll be in Hufflepuff, love.”
“Mm. Potter still in that class with you?” She smirked knowingly.
"Right, okay. That makes sense." Draco sat up, sitting cross-legged across from Harry, although his far longer legs made the position look almost comical on him, and Harry couldn't help but mentally compare him to a praying mantis. He tried not to laugh at the thought, but he failed fairly quickly. "What?" Draco asked amusedly.
They were leaning into one another, giggling and watching the sun set, when Harry looked up at Draco. The last bits of sunlight were dancing over his angular, pale features in just the right way and Harry couldn’t even think before his mouth was moving.
Draco sighed heavily. "Well, let's see what she's said then."
His wand woke him up the next morning and he groaned, blearily waving his hand to cancel the spell, but a few seconds after he flopped back down on his back, a smile worked its way onto his face as he remembered why he'd set the alarm in the first place.
"Ron might, but I reckon Hermione'd go for a punch." He joked.
“Harry?” Harry awoke to his shoulder being shaken gently by a tall man with amber eyes and heavy scars criss-crossing over every inch of skin Harry could see.
He pulled off his shirt and kicked off his trainers and socks before kneeling down to remove Draco's boots. As he did so, Draco yanked off his own t-shirt, and as soon as both were shirtless and barefooted, Harry's lips descended back onto Draco's. They kissed passionately, Harry's hands roaming up and down Draco's torso before he reached for the fly of his jeans.
Wordlessly, Harry placed a piled high plate in-front of his already morbidly obese cousin along with the butter dish and a bottle of syrup. Turning back to the stove, Harry continued pouring, frying and plating up more pancakes, two for Petunia, which he silently set in front of the horse-faced woman, and a second tower for Vernon. When Vernon finally entered the kitchen and sat between his wife and son, rolled up newspaper in one hand, he glared viciously at Harry.
"I- well…. You… you know you told me to think about the whole caregiver thing?" Laura didn't express any surprise at the abrupt change in topic, but just nodded her head. "Well, I think- I think I'd like that? But not with someone who wasn't also my boyfriend or girlfriend. But because I've been in love with Draco for years even though I tried not to be, that basically means I want Draco to be my d- my caregiver, but he'd probably punch me if he ever found out!" Harry tangled his hands into his hair and pulled slightly.
Harry put the kettle on and made himself another cup of tea before settling in to the sofa with one of the baby books. It was rather informative, and before he knew it, it was almost 10 PM and he was over half way through. He was considering making himself another cuppa when there was a knock at the door. He frowned, confused as to who on earth would be knocking at his door so late, particularly when the only people who knew he was living there were the Weasleys, Hermione and Kingsley.
Draco recognised what must be going on- he'd been wondering since he'd caught sight of Harry going into the shop over summer, and had been almost certain when he saw his new way of dressing, whether Harry might be a little, but he didn't want to bring it up in case he was wrong or made Harry feel uncomfortable.
“Locked me up, smacked me about a bit.” He shrugged again, awkward. He didn’t particularly like talking about the Dursleys, but he sort of wanted Draco to know. “My bedroom ‘till Hogwarts was the cupboard under the stairs, then I had my cousins second bedroom each summer. And Aunt Petunia is the reason I get the migraines.”
Harry considered briefly before nodding. “Just don’t drop him.” He handed the baby over to George, who already had his arms out to take him. Teddy blinked his big golden-brown eyes at him, scrunched his face up and turned his little hairs orange. Harry laughed.
“No problem, kiddo.” Sirius smiled, wrapping his arms around Harry tight.
“How’s your project going?” Potter smiled crookedly and Draco felt his pulse race a little.
“I love you.”
“Harry Potter?” They were greeted at the entrance by a grandfatherly old man with a long silver-white beard.
The third floor was filled with shoes, accessories and a few more little-specific items like dummies, bottles and sippy cups.
“So, what’s up?”
“Sorry.” He loosened his fingers from where they were digging into her arm and saw the slight red marks and crescent moon shaped indents his nails had left. “But why was that so fucking hot?” He asked.
When the police finally arrived, it was a hard-faced, attractive man who approached them, his partner only two steps behind.
He wasn't sure how long he'd been there, shivers and sobs wracking his small frame, before the door was again pushed open.
“Sorry.” He heard Draco whisper as he put something on top of Harry’s trunk gently and closed the door. “Weasley and Granger said you’d be in here. Do you need a hand?”
so "make some friends
the only thing we have in common is this pretentious-ass last name
Harry just instinctually knew that Draco wasn’t even joking. “No, no, its alright. I mean, it was shit, but I never have to go back there, so its fine.”
Draco turned his head and cracked his eyes, staring at Harry’s handsome features, from the way his hair curled sweetly where it had fallen from its knot atop his head, to the unique zig-zagging patterns of his scar, to his strong nose, to his defined jawline dusted with dark hair. “I don’t always mean to be cruel. Not to you, anyway. Remnants of my upbringing, I suppose. I’m sure Pansy will be proud of me for actually managing to have a civil conversation with you.”
"Yeah, he actually found out the night before we got together. He looked after me when a class made me regress, and the day after is when we got together. Apparently Ron already thought we were dating."
He was almost out of the castle when he heard voices, just off to the side of him down the hallway to the Slytherin dungeons.
“Alright, same as dad then. He doesn’t wear his docs anymore, if you want them? He wanted to give them to me but they’re a couple sizes too big.”
“Why’re ya sittin’ alone, mate?” His voice was warm and happy sounding. Harry’s lips curled.
Draco sat up, remaining perched on Harry’s lap, and held his hands out in front of them. They were shaking terribly, and when he tried to flex his fingers they barely twitched. “Guess n-not. I think you’re going to have to help me today.” Draco gave up and dropped back down to lay on Harry’s strong chest.
Harry didn’t even think before stepping through, his feet bare and his mug of tea still in one hand. “Thank you for contacting me, Auror….”
It turned out Harry was right about that- all of the teachers, even Professor Snape, continued to use his correct pronouns and address him as Mr, and they would give detentions to and take points from any students they saw being transphobic towards Harry, even, with the exception of Snape, if those students were in their own house. Plus, Ron and Hermione, along with a small group of other students including Ginny and her girlfriend Luna, Neville, Seamus Finnigan and his boyfriend Dean Thomas, Hermione’s roommate Lavender and her girlfriend Parvati, Parvati’s twin sister Padma and the entire Gryffindor football team, took it upon themselves to become what they called the Harry Protection Squad.
He barely had time to get his bearings before he was bent over, Aaron’s hands forcing his too-loose grey trousers down around his ankles and a lecherous voice breathing hotly into his ear, “Be a good boy and stay still.”
“You were ACTIVELY TRYING TO GO BACK IN TIME?!” Draco shrunk under Granger’s glare. “We are UNSPEAKABLES, our job isn’t to mess with the timeline, its to research and experiment, but not do such
“Okay, cool.” Harry ducked his head and took a drag of his cigarette.
so play the victim if you want to
“Who’re you?” His voice was groggy and he felt disorientated until he realized where he was.
“Good job, Kane, you finally picked up on what everyone else has known since before I even came here.” Harry laughed from his perch on the edge of the entryway roof. It’s not like he’d never heard it before, after all.
“What?” My voice was uneven and croaky, and I couldn’t figure out how to articulate what I wanted to ask….
“Nym! Did you really have to wear a matching outfit?” He groaned.
Draco looked into the kitchen door, rocking Teddy softly, and whispered, “Just a minute, he’s fallen asleep, so I’ll just put him down in his cot first, alright?”
“You always were this person! People don’t just change like
“Do you really think so? Even though, well, I’m me?”
“I saw you with Potter! You’re a traitor to the cause!” Avery’s wand was pressed painfully hard against Draco’s throat.
"Is he your little, then?" The sales assistant asked them smilingly.
That startled a laugh out of Harry. “Really?” His eyes crinkled at the corners.
Upon hearing Harry’s laughter, Draco looked up, his breath stolen as he looked up at the usually much shorter man, and the angle did wonders for his strong jawline. Harry’s hair was damp and curling all over the place, and he was wearing tight jeans that actually seemed to fit him for once, pulled taught around his muscular thighs, and another massive sweater that made him look soft and warm, along with the yellow boots he’d worn yesterday.
“Okay, I’ll be over in 5 and you can tell me all about your appointment.”
“You do know you could have just asked rather than rooting through my mind.”
“Thank you.” Harry put his mug down on Andrews’ desk and followed him out into the hallway. He was vaguely aware of his bare feet on the highly polished floor as he padded towards Kingsley’s office, but it was distant, pushed down by his need to get to his godson. As Andrews pushed Kingsley’s office door open and his eyes fell on the tiny, snuffling blue-haired baby in Kingsley’s arms, he felt all of his breath whoosh out of him.
It bleww awaayy.” Harry’s heart almost stopped as he walked into a small clearing about twenty-five meters into the forest to see Draco Malfoy, the boy he’d had feelings for since at least sixth year, leaning over a muggle acoustic guitar, his long, slender fingers plucking at the strings. “Blew away.
so "make some friends
Harry looked up at the blond through his tears and just sobbed.
"That's lovely. Does he know about your being a little?"
Try to change,” His icy blond hair was falling into his face, and his eyes were screwed closed as he sang, his voice breaking slightly.
“I was thinking, we should probably go shopping today, you know, get any stuff we need for us, Teddy and the house.” Harry was suddenly struck by how domestic this was and felt his heart ache.
“The girl, that’s my girlfriend, Rosie. The guy’s my best friend, Charlie.”
Ron looked doe-eyed at Hermione. “Definitely ‘Mione.”
“Draco, we need to leave.”
“Goodnight.”
Harry was wearing a pair of jeans he vaguely recognized as his own and assumed that Remus had come in and taken them out of his drawers- sharing a room for 24 years had made him a master at not waking him up- and a green sweater he knew was Remus’ from their third year at Hogwarts- his husband almost never threw out his clothes, so even though the sweater was far too small for him now, it had been in a box in the attic since they had moved in. He supposed it was a good thing, now, seeing as it meant Harry had something to wear while they went shopping today. His jeans were clearly a bit too short for Harry, but they seemed to otherwise fit okay, and he figured it was better than nothing.
“Of course. It’s no problem, really, as long as you don’t act like a dick.” Harry shrugged.
“Me too.” Harry pressed his lips back against Draco’s and smiled as the blond practically melted into him, hooking one long leg around his waist. Harry moved the hand on his lower back to grasp at the dip between his arse and the thigh wrapped around him, and released his hair in favour of running his thick, square fingers over Draco’s sharp cheekbones and jawline as they kissed.
By the time Nym came to pick him up, he felt as jittery as if he’d had thirty coffee’s and maybe a line of coke. Nym just laughed at him and told him the Sirius would be over at about 4 with his bass.
“Oh, I didn’t know. When they were pregnant. I actually now know a rather ridiculous number of protective spells for pregnant people and babies thanks to that, although she never did actually come after them.”
As soon as they were out of the practice Sirius called his GP and set up an appointment for ‘his son’, a title that made Harry smile goofily to himself, for a few days later, and within the week Harry was on testosterone, a shot every 2 weeks, which Remus tended to help him with. Sirius was too squeamish to be helpful, and Harry was always worried he’d do it wrong, so the job tended to fall to Remus. It also meant that once he started at Hogwarts, he wouldn’t have to worry about keeping up with it because Remus would still be there with him.
“At least sixth year, that’s when I realized, but probably longer. I’ve definitely liked you since at least third.”
“T-thanks.” Draco twisted his fingers together in his lap, avoiding looking up at Harry and letting his hair fall to cover some of his burning face. As he fidgeted, his sleeve slipped up, showing inked black lines all around his wrists.
“You think I’m cute?” Harry was a little stunned at the admission.
Harry woke up sobbing. He'd dreamed he was back in his cupboard, alone and unloved, and that his friends were all one incredibly unfair dream, gifted to him and then wrenched away for him to remain locked under the stairs, starving and alone.
“Where the fuck are you even from, you fucking poncy freak?!”
Harry made it almost the entire day without seeing Aaron. He’d, naively, thought he’d gotten away with it when on his way out of school, he still didn’t see the older boy. But in thinking that, he let his guard down, giving Aaron the perfect chance to strike. One minute Harry was following the crowd of students out of the main doors, and the next a large, pale hand was wrapping around his scrawny arm and dragging him painfully into a storage closet.
, Ron.”
For the first time in his short life, Harry was able to shower with warm water, picking out the nicest smelling soaps and using them all. He smiled to himself as he got out, wrapping one of the warm, fluffy guest towels around himself instead of the greying rag he usually had to use and padding barefoot towards Dudley’s room. He opened the closet and flicked through all of the clothes- they were mostly incredibly ugly, and were all at least five sizes to large for him, but there were a few items he thought were probably salvageable. A plain black button-down shirt, some black jeans and a pair of black leather boots that Dudley had only worn once to go to work with Uncle Vernon. Harry laid them out on the bed and pulled on thick, plain black socks he’d stolen from Dudley’s drawers as well as a pair of plain red boxer shorts. He then dressed in the clothes, which were far too big but definitely nicer than the cast-off’s he normally wore.
Kingsley frowned, and silently turned back to the computer. A few moments later, he looked back at Harry. “There is no record of you having any scars prior to the Dursleys gaining custody of you, but that scar looks like a Lichtenberg scar. From electricity.” He added.
Ron still looked shocked, and turned to Remus. “Harry thinks bloody
“Well, I’m going to get disowned either way, so yeah, I’d definitely rather not have to deal with all of my fathers bullshit sober if I can help it.”
Draco scrunched his eyes closed, shaking his hands out under the hot water of the shower as he rocked back and forth on the balls of his feet. The entire day he’d felt as if he was in sensory hell. The stiff material of his uniform had been irritating his skin to the point he’d not been able to focus in any of his classes, and everything felt like it’d been too loud and too bright and just too much.
Remus raised an eyebrow at Harry. “Never marry a Black, they’re drama queens of the highest order.”
It was a Tuesday, and everyone was on their way to lunch when Flint decided to harass Harry again.
"I think he had a nightmare about being back at the Dursley's, and now he's acting like a little kid or something. I don't really know what's going on." Ron told her softly. Harry was looking between them, his bright green eyes wide.
“Alright. Won’t be long.”
Freak looked down at him. “It’s human bone and hag’s hair. Grandmama favours bone over wood.” His voice was cold, a clear warning to never touch his things again, and from the possessive hand he had laid on the small of Draco’s back, the entire room could see that that warning now included Draco.
Draco reached over and unstrapped him from his pram, rocking him and shushing him softly. “Its okay, honey, its all okay.” He whispered against the baby’s head.
“Erm, I was just coming by to see ‘Mione.” Potter scratched the back of his neck awkwardly, which made his shirt rise in a way Draco tried very hard not to notice.
“One of you two’ll have to sign for him too.” Sirius leaned over and scrawled his name where she tapped, and Remus nudged Harry to go sign it. “Okidoke.” A second, taller girl came through the side door as Harry put the pen back down, and she grinned as she saw Sirius.
“Hm, no.” Draco smirked at him and lit his pilfered cigarette.
“Potter?” The blond seemed confused.
They were on their way to a much larger homeware store nearby when Harry pulled Draco towards a second-hand shop with a gasp.
Whispers suddenly started circulating, and Harry felt hundreds of eyes on him. He pushed his half-full plate away and stood up, rolling his eyes as almost everyone in the hall watched him leave. He headed up towards his room, but was intercepted by professor Snape.
“Alright, do you want some toast? We’ll have to go food shopping later, all we’ve got in ins bread and butter right now, but we need to take you to get some clothes and things anyway.”
but only if you're who i want you to be"
was well worth the fucking price
Harry almost couldn't breathe from laughing so hard. "Okay! Okay, I'm sorry!" He wheezed, before breaking out in another peal of laughter.
“Hiya, Lu.” She leaned down to where he was sat and wrapped her arms around him, her metal bangles tinkling.
It turned out that Harry was actually a rather good roommate. He wasn’t particularly messy, and he never pried into why Draco sometimes acted oddly, or, really, into anything he could tell Draco didn’t want to talk about. He respected his boundaries and made sure to never touch any of Draco’s things without explicit permission, which was something even Pansy didn’t always do.
“Draco, do you have tattoos?” Harry blurted before he even thought, and when he realised his mistake, he felt his cheeks heat and mentally thanked his father for passing on his dark skin which made it unnoticeable. He half-hoped Draco wouldn’t notice, but when the blond’s head snapped up, he knew he’d had no such luck. The blond’s molten silver eyes bored into his and his breath caught in his throat. Draco the most beautiful person he’d ever seen.
“Okay.” I nodded.
“Absolutely they are. The Head is actually a friend of mine, and I can assure you that they are very much used to dealing with problem cases such as young Mr Potter. Now, if you want to take Mr Potter home to collect his things and say goodbye and then meet me at St Brutus’ in, say, two hours, we can get everything signed off on and sorted.”
“Do you want all those? We can replace them if you’d rather.” Remus offered kindly, but Harry shook his head.
“G-goodmorning.” Draco’s teeth chattered a bit.
It was barely an hour later when Harry walked back in, his head bowed and sheepish.
“Yes, thank you, Lanky.” Draco granted the elf a small smile before they returned to the kitchen.
you think that I'm a doll for you to dress up
“That’s Draco Malfoy. He’s in Slytherin and he’s… well, he’s rather unpleasant, really.” She sounded almost apologetic.
“Oh, I don’t? So, you and Potter aren’t shagging? Because that’s sure what it looked like to me.” Avery didn’t even give Draco a chance to reply before casting “
“Just chemistry with Uncle Sev.”
“He’s too good for me anyway, Pans, so its not like it’d matter either way.” At that she smacked him around the head, hard, and he leaned back. “What the fuck, Pans?!”
“I’ll pay you back somehow.” Draco insisted.
“Yeah, you get the pram.” He nodded.
"I didn't have to deal with anything. Look, come here, calm down." Draco reached out and pulled Harry closer, guiding him to lay back down and then resting his hand on his upper arm. "Now, what exactly do you think you need to apologise for?
"Right…. Where would I even get that kind of stuff?" Harry thought the idea actually sounded rather nice- he never got to have nice things when he was younger, so it would be really cool to have them now. And Hermione had told him that her and Ron would be willing to look after him for a while, so he would definitely be doing better than when he was a child. Plus, he had been avoiding getting new clothes, so maybe he could buy some while he was out shopping.
Harry huffed a laugh. “Morning.”
Remus smiled. “If you want.” When Harry grinned he turned back towards Sirius. “Pads, Harry wants a piercing too.”
“Well, objectively speaking, it would have to be Harry, I suppose.” Harry choked on his pumpkin juice, and Hermione rolled her eyes at the outraged expression on his face. “Oh, don’t look like that, Harry, you know you’re like my brother, but you are a handsome man.”
“Oh! Yes!” Draco sat up excitedly. “I used a rather hideously complex runic sequence I designed myself, so now it receives no magical feedback, doesn’t require charging and has a permanent internet connection and signal regardless of where I am! I did Pansy’s phone too, and it means I can text my therapist and don’t have to worry about asking Headmistress McGonagall if I can use her floo. Plus, an internet connection will certainly make studying a lot easier, particularly as I want to go into healing and cross-referencing magical texts with muggle medical texts is incredibly helpful. And online shopping is far more convenient than having to go to muggle London for some of the things I need. My mother promised to go by my flat once a week and owl me any post and packages, so even while I’m here I’ll be able to access more books and other helpful items without it causing an issue.”
"Uh, great…" Ron started, but just then he caught sight of Harry jumping to try and reach something from a higher shelf than he could naturally reach. "Shit. Right, I'll leave these with you then go help him, alright?" Ron barely even thought before passing the pile over to the assistant and walking over to Harry. "Harry, bud, what are you trying to reach?"
Sirius turned gracefully, a goofy grin on his face. “Ooh, what do you want, kiddo?”
“What? No. But you shouldn’t pretend to be a boy if you’re not one, I can’t imagine your roommate is too happy about it.”
Draco raised one pointed brow. “Says
He came away from the shopping day with bags and bags of clothing, from sweatpants to jeans to t-shirts to hoodies, and even his own leather jacket that looked just like Sirius’, which Sirius had insisted were all completely necessary whilst Remus shared commiserating glances with Harry, new bedding and blankets to “make his room his own”, two new binders (which were far nicer quality than his old one) and a haircut. He didn’t really want to cut his hair short, because he liked being able to tie it up when it got too unruly, but he had it cut into a sort of undercut style which meant he could tie it up on the top, and it was a more masculine style, plus it had the added bonus of thinning out his thick curls a bit.
“I don’t even know why I’m surprised, to be honest.”
Remus reached out and squeezed his shoulder briefly before turning and going back inside and Harry couldn’t fight the smile that made its way onto his face.
“you told me
Harry turned to Mx Greenfeld. “I’m so sorry! You shouldn’t have done that, now you’ve lost your job because of me!”
“Oh. I’m not telling you that.”
“Follow me.” Harry stood and made his way towards Tonks’ room. He opened the door and waved his hand to quickly tidy it up, piling up any clothes that looked as if they would fit Draco on the bed (mostly Remus’ trousers as Draco was tall and slender like he had been and Tonks and Ted’s t-shirts, as they were both fairly thin) and cleaning the sheets. “This was Tonks’ room, so it’s yours now, and those clothes should probably fit you. I don’t know what size shoe you are, but there’s a few different sizes in the closet. If you’re a 9, though, I already took all those, so just let me know.”
cause I'm everything that you fucking despise
“You’ll need to take off the ear-defenders so you can hear her.” Draco’s voice was low and soft. I nodded, moving them until they were around my neck instead.
. I kissed him deeply, pulling him right up to my chest and smiling into the kiss as he shifted his leg until it was slung over my thighs. I adjusted the blanket over us until it was covering us both from our feet to our shoulders and just relaxed into the kiss.
"You let him look after you?" Laura smiled encouragingly. "Is he your caregiver, or?"
“You feeling better this morning?” Harry’s voice was low and gravelly and oh-so-enticing.
"You alright, love?" Harry's face looked as stony as ever, but Draco could see the warm affection in his hard green eyes.
“If you say so.”
“Malfoy- Draco. Whatever your bloody project is, its not worth you putting yourself at risk.” Harry leaned forward, eyes imploring.
"Ron and Hermione are partnering together, so I'm partnering with you! If… that's alright with you?"
“Malfoy. What are you doing here?”
"I'm so pleased for you, Harry. You deserve it."
Nott’s face went red and blotchy. “I- you-”
Harry was wandering around the black lake when he heard something coming from the forbidden forest; it wasn’t the usual creature noises or even the centaurs, but, oddly enough, distant guitar music. Someone was in the forbidden forest playing a song he vaguely recognised as muggle on an acoustic guitar. He stopped, puzzled, and whoever was playing started singing.
"Okay, good."
Draco’s silvery eyes flickered down to the small boy. “So, is this Teddy?”
Draco let out a laugh that was bordering on a giggle. “Thanks.”
“Thank you so much. I don’t-”
Once Draco was comfortable, he propped the book open on his chest and Harry rested his head against his shoulder, tilted until he could see the pictures as Draco started to read.
Harry groaned. “Christ, you’re so pretty.” He pressed a kiss to the pointy end of Draco’s nose, which made him scrunch it up cutely. “But yes, absolutely. I love you, and that means you’re never getting rid of me.”
Harry felt his face flame at the last point and hoped it wasn’t visible. “Yes sir.”
"be yourself,
“Yeah. Just take a shower and come to my room, I’ll pick out some stuff that should fit you. What size shoe are you?”
“Oh, hush, love. I’ll see you soon. Okay?”
“Can I ‘old ‘im?” She asked, her eyes shining.
Slowly but surely, more and more people started leaving Harry alone. It wasn’t as if he was somehow making people less transphobic by diffusion or something, but people were just starting to lose interest, which meant that his friends started letting him spend time alone more and more.
“You- I-” Draco gave up on trying to verbalise his feelings and just leaned in, kissing Harry deeply. Harry seemed surprised at first but then kissed back passionately, taking control of the kiss and pulling Draco until he was straddling his waist. When they pulled back for air, Draco dropped his forehead onto Harry’s. “I’m in love with you too. Since at least second year, although I’ve liked you since Madam Malkins.”
"Malfoy, you're an idiot. All he does is watch you and complain about how now you wear makeup it's just 'unfair how hot the way his lipstick smudges!!', put us out of our misery and just make a move already." She sighed, exasperated.
“O-oh.” He looked startled by that.
but wheres the fucking fun
"I just- the way you look with your legs crossed, you look like a praying mantis!" Harry howled with laughter as Draco protested loudly, shoving Harry playfully.
“What?” Draco rested his head on his knees and looked at me, and I noticed that he seemed to be focusing on my hair instead of my eyes like Ron and Hermione always tried to do- I was glad, that always made me feel squirmy and uncomfortable.
By the time he got back to his dorm, he felt so intensely drained that he almost immediately curled up on his bed, only kicking off his slippers and dropping the silencing charm, delighting in the loss of the odd buzzing magic sound and the silence of the wards he’d put around the room, before he wrapped his weighted blanket around his shoulders and rocked back and forth. He stuffed his hands into the pocket of his hoodie, trying to stop himself from smacking his head or biting them, and summoned over his chew necklace from his drawer. His face was damp with tears and his chest felt tight. The door opened again and he screwed up his eyes.
Later that day, in their dorm, Ron sat across from Harry and stared at him as if he didn’t recognise him.
Sirius managed to get Harry in to see Dr June, a private specialist in HRT and gender confirmation, on February 23
“No, yeah, but I do.” Harry saw Draco about to protest and held up a hand. “No, seriously, I have more money than I could ever need. You really don’t have to worry about it.”
“Although your choice not to return to the manor is… unfortunate, I can understand your reasoning. And I’m not too certain what ‘autism’ means, and so I’m afraid you will have to explain it to me.”
“Harry-kins!” Fred called.
"Oh, honestly." Hermione shook her head, exasperated. "It seems he wants you to be his caregiver, Draco. Is that something that is okay with you?"
"Alright, mate, if you're sure." Ron shrugged and grabbed one of each colour- pink, blue, yellow and purple with white clouds and white with blue clouds.
“You like Queen?” Draco asked, smiling almost indulgently when Harry nodded vehemently.
“Wait, what? Draco’s related to Sirius?”
"Thank you for telling us." Hermione smiled gently. "If you want I can either explain more about it or lend you the book I read about it in." She offered.
that to get what you want!” Harry started to protest but Draco just spoke over him. “Look, its not like I’m trying to tell you to use your influence for nefarious purposes or anything, but using it for things like being allowed to fetch your son to school with you
It was at dinner that night, which turned out to be a takeaway because apparently neither Remus nor Sirius could cook particularly well, something Harry had found out and been horrified by when they went food shopping (and had insisted that he would start cooking dinner so they weren’t all living on ready meals), when Sirius brought up the idea of booking Harry in with a doctor.
“Kingsley. Can I-” He held out his arms for Teddy. Kingsley smiled sadly and passed him over. Harry clasped him to his chest and ran one square finger across his pudgy little cheek. He was so enamoured by the child that he didn’t even notice the door click shut as Andrews left.
“Firstly- not really, and secondly, I’m definitely not THE most attractive person! I’m not even the most attractive bloke in our year!”
“Dray! You’re going to bruise me!” Pansy’s whine broke through the daze he was in and he realized Lupin had disappeared at some point.
“You’re in love with me?” Harry felt dizzy and giddy- he almost wanted to laugh, but he knew Draco would take that the wrong way.
The class passed uneventfully, although Harry was sure he had missed quite a lot of the instruction because he was too busy staring at Draco or chatting with him. The blond had high cheekbones and a long, slender neck that Harry just wanted to bite. A few times Draco would move awkwardly, and Harry saw lots of silvery scars poking out of his sweater sleeves, but that didn’t bother him. They all looked fairly old, so he chose not to worry too much about it.
“No, I don’t.”
people’s shop?!” Vernon’s moustache trembled angrily.
.” He whined.
“Well, then, Ronald, you can help me with my research.” Ron groaned and followed her out of the room, shutting the door behind him.
“What?!” I was shocked by how he took that. “No, no, of course not! I’m bi!” I shouted, and then realized that we were in a fairly public space and I had, in fact, just yelled out my sexuality to my crush when I hadn’t even told my best friends.
“Oh! Narcissa’s boy?”
He was pulled from his thoughts when he felt Harry seemingly try to burrow into his chest, mumbling sleepily.
“Group 2.”
cause you were a shitty-arse dad
“pequeño, I was wondering if you needed help.” The man reached out as if to clap Harry’s shoulder, but the young boy ducked and held his knife to his throat before he could make contact.
"No! Why would you think that?" Harry asked through his giggles.
“And who is this boy?” Lucius leaned in towards Draco, which Draco knew was his father’s way of showing his interest.
Draco hesitated a moment before nodding, hesitantly. “I’m being disowned. The papers will all be signed in the morning.” His voice was quiet and shaky.
As soon as Harry was out of the kitchen Draco dropped his head to the counter, Teddy balanced on his hip. “I am so fucked.”
“Where’s my food, freak?” Dudley’s face was as pink as a pigs and just as ugly.
"Excellent. Well, unless you have any questions...?" Harry shook his head. "Then I will see you next week."
“I- both.” Harry rubbed one hand through his hair nervously.
They finally stopped walking on the third floor, besides a large oak door flanked by gargoyles. “This is the Headmaster’s office. Come along.” She pushed the door open and he wasn’t really able to do anything but follow her up another, smaller set of stairs and into a large, round room, where an old man was sat at a heavy antique desk, the modern computer sat atop it looking entirely out of place. A macaw was perched on the man’s shoulder, and it tilted its head at Harry as it saw him.
Almost as soon as Molly headed back into the kitchen, Fred and George sat themselves on the arms of his chair.
“’m sorry for bothering you last night.” His voice was thick with sleep and he sluggishly unhooked himself from Harry. “’nd for wrapping myself around you, I guess.”
He made his way over towards them as Draco turned and hissed to his cousin “Why did you have to shout Potter over Oh My God.”
"Don't forget to get some underwear and socks, Harry." Hermione reminded him gently when he seemed to be entirely ignoring that section.
“Alright, I’m done.” He smiled sheepishly at them.
“Yes, I have to. Professor McGonagall spoke to the aurors and it was agreed that so long as I attend the eighth year, I wouldn’t have to go to trial or anything.” Draco shrugged awkwardly. “Are you?”
“My pleasure.” Draco’s cheeks pinkened at how true that statement was. He couldn’t think of anything he’d rather have spent the day doing than running his fingers through Harry’s soft hair… well, almost anything, anyway.
Chemistry was definitely Draco’s favourite class, but mostly because his godfather didn’t care if he showed up stoned and spent the entire lesson with his head on his desk staring at the back of Harry bloody Potter’s head, especially since Severus had been tutoring him since he was six, and so he knew he already knew the entire curriculum (plus, if he were being honest, enough to get him through at least the first two years of a chemistry degree if he wanted to do that). Today, though, it seemed to drag on as he worried about what he was going to do that night. He was definitely glad he’d chosen a Friday to do this, so he at least would have the weekend to adjust to most likely being disowned without having to deal with school as well.
“You’re safe. You’re okay. I’ve got you.” Harry whispered against the side of Draco’s head as he shivered in his arms.
Draco didn’t think he’d ever been stared at this much in his life. He really should have expected it, but he’d been so wrapped up in the thrill of finally being able to look the way he wanted to that it hadn’t occurred to him that turning up to school in his Black Sheep t-shirt, green and black plaid jeans with chains, his green doc martens that Ted had assured him he could keep, and with sky-blue hair and an eyebrow piercing might garner him some attention.
“Do you need a lift home?”
“Yeah, ‘course. I already told him I’d show him around and that, ‘Mione.”
"I don't know what that means!" Harry knew he sounded pouty, but he couldn't help it. He just wanted someone to wave their wand at him and bippity-boppity-boo make him normal.
“To the library.” We laughed.
Harry wasn’t sure how to answer- he usually had 6, because it was almost all he could get away with stealing at the Dursleys to keep him going, but he supposed he didn’t need to do that anymore. “Uhm, two?”
“That was for making such a shitty pun!”
“No, no, we need to leave right now.” Harry’s eyes were wild and panicked.
It was early November and Harry was showering in the locker rooms after practice- his teammates had all finished up and headed back to the castle, so he was able to use the showers, and he was washing the mud and grime from his skin and hair with his eyes closed when Zacharias Smith looked in, having heard the shower running on his way to shower himself after a run around the grounds.
“Either this is a really unfair dream, or the best day of my life.” Draco laughed breathily, his words muffled by the fact his face was still buried against Harry’s skin.
Piers and his friends all backed off, looking innocently at the toad-like pink monstrosity that was their headmistress.
“Cool.” I wasn’t sure what to say about that. It was cool to know that Charlie and Arthur were autistic too.
“Excellent to meet you. I’m Professor McGonagall, and I’ll be your head of house. Please follow me.” She turned and made her way up the stairs.
"Oh, uh, no, he's our best mate. We're looking after him till he finds a proper caregiver, though." The tips of Ron's ears were pink.
"Only if you want to."
"Right, sorry." Ron replied sheepishly, the tips of his ears turning red. As he did, Harry blinked his eyes open a bit.
“Would you rather I hit you? Leave me the fuck alone.” Harry sat back to try again to eat his dinner, only to be interrupted by the Headmaster speaking from the front of the hall. ‘fuck that’ he thought to himself and carried on eating.
Harry hesitated for a moment before whispering "Yes." quietly.
The grey light slowly shifted to a vibrant purple. “Yes, Mr Potter, it seems you are autistic. I can recommend some techniques for dealing with any issues that you may have relating to this, although you may be better speaking with Mr Malfoy, here.” She looked over at Draco and he nodded.
“Er, yeah, you don’t have to leave on my account, Malfoy. Actually, you know what? I’m just- I’m just going to go, yeah?” he nodded, apparently to himself before looking back at Granger. “I’ll see you later, ‘Mione.” Potter’s eyes were pointedly averted from Draco, but Draco would have sworn that just before he left, he saw them land on him and Potter’s cheeks pink up, although he couldn’t for the life of him understand why.
“Mm, morning love.” His voice was thick and sleepy.
Hermione wandered over to Harry and although he started talking to her, his attention was quickly stolen by a jacket near the back and he pushed his pile into her arms, running over to it. It was thick and soft, a warm brown only a few shades darker than his skin, and it was made to look like a teddy bear. He found a small, which was definitely too big for him, but when he tried it on he immediately wrapped his arms around himself, holding the plush fabric to him. "I need this! I need it!" Harry almost shouted excitedly to them and they both just smiled.
“Yes.” Harry wanted to laugh at the pained expression on his best friend’s face when he confirmed that fact.
“Yes, Aunt Petunia.” He started getting out the ingredients for a full fry up- Friday mornings meant a full English, no tomatoes, extra bacon, and essentially ensured Harry didn’t get anything at all.
“So this-”
, you loveable idiot. That’s possibly the nicest thing I’ve ever heard, but if you ever attempt something so STUPID again, I will lock you in a room where your big brain can’t get you into trouble.” She threw her arms around him and he awkwardly patted her back, still unsure of what to do with physical contact.
“Yeah, rich people are fucking weird.”
“Ah, well, you see-” Draco licked his lips nervously, trying to think of anything to say that didn’t sound like a love confession.
"If you like. Do you want to pick a book?" Harry dropped his legs and ran across the room to his desk, fumbling through a pile of storybooks until he found the one he wanted, while Draco moved over to the bed and toed off his boots, settling himself upright against the headboard on one side. Harry practically leapt at the bed once he had located the book he wanted and thrust it at Draco's chest before rooting around in his bedside table and pulling out a pacifier. It was a large, hardback book with some sort of minotaur drawn on the front called 'where the wild things are'. Harry scooped up his dragon and leaned against Draco's shoulder so he could look at the illustrations.
"Yes pwease, daddy." Harry didn't even seem to notice what he said, but Draco felt his heart stop for a moment. He pressed a soft kiss to Harry's thick curls.
"O-okay.
“You offering?” Harry’s smirk slowly transformed itself to a grin.
Draco rushed through changing into his pyjamas, leaving his clothes in an uncharacteristic messy pile at the end of his bed and padding back down to Harry's room as quickly as he could. As it happened, he walked back through Harry's door just as Harry came out of the bathroom. Almost immediately, Harry jumped at him, clinging to him once again and laying his head tiredly against Draco's collarbone.
the summer between his 6
Harry immediately let go of his hand and ran over to his wardrobe, pulling out what looked to Draco like just a pile of pink fluff and disappearing into his bathroom. He was about to leave when Harry walked back in wearing the pink fluff, which Draco could now see was some sort of one-piece pyjama that was made to look like a cartoon dragon. He looked adorable, and Draco had to smile a little.
Being taught by Remus was brilliant as well- as Ron had said, he was definitely the best teacher, and had them doing fun activities like acting out scenes from the plays they studied, which all the Gryffindors enjoyed but most of the Slytherins rolled their eyes at or acted too cool for. Plus, with Mx Greenfeld in the library and Hermione as his friend, he never had to worry about not understanding the homework. His chemistry teacher, Professor Snape, seemed to dislike him, but he was rather good at chemistry, and he was definitely used to teachers hating him at Stonewall, so it didn’t particularly bother him.
“I can’t keep living like this, Pans. I’m constantly paranoid he’s going to figure it out, and then I have to sit and listen to him spewing homophobic bullshit over dinner every night and I just can’t do it anymore. I’ve moved my trust fund over to an account he can’t access, and even if he kicks me out, it can’t be much worse than this, yeah?”
“Excellent. Now, here is your weekly pack, you will be given one of these each week, and any sensible requests may be submitted and may be given in the next week’s pack.” Harry was passed a moderately sized sack. “Your basic pack will contain toothpaste, cigarettes, soap and shampoo, and this pack also contains a refillable water bottle, new underwear and socks, three sets of uniform, five pairs of pyjamas, a toothbrush, which will be replaced every three months, a disposable razor and a pair of ear plugs. Sensible requests would include items such as more underwear or socks, new shoes, a replacement water bottle, a new toothbrush, a new razor, new uniform, new pyjamas, extra soap, shampoo, or toothpaste, if you find yourself running out too quickly, conditioner, lotion or condoms. Understood?”
Hermione rolled her eyes at her boyfriend. “Oh, honestly, Ronald.” She shook her head and turned to Harry. “Harry, we’re very happy for you.”
"Small."
“What, that you’re gay?” Draco nodded. “Of course not. Be a bit hypocritical of me if I did, wouldn’t it?”
"Books? 'n' colouring stuff." He started to stand up and sleepily made his way to the book section. He grabbed seemingly at random, just picking any that he liked the artwork of, and handed them off to Hermione, then moved over a case to the colouring books and picked out a few different ones, some with more detailed bits and some more simple. Finally he grabbed packs of pencils, pens and crayons from the table next to it and handed them to Hermione too, all while still clutching at his bear. The only other thing he bothered grabbing from that floor was a massive variety pack of play doh, because he remembered Dudley having some when he was little but he'd only ever gotten to touch it once it was already dried out.
Draco moved one of his hands, pressing it against his forehead theatrically. “My entire reputation, my years of hard work and carefully cultivated cruelty, shattered! All by one cute boy!” He spoke with a level of drama Harry was sure even Sirius would envy.
"Of course! If you want to get ready, we could go today, if you like."
He found Luna and Ginny in a compartment at the end, leaning against one another and chatting, but they both gave him bright smiles when he asked if he could join them. He'd only just sat down when the compartment door was opened again, this time by Draco. He had on the same combat boots Harry had seen at the tattoo shop, along with green plaid trousers and a distressed tank top.
you told me
Mens capitat + time turner?
“Its weighted?” I asked, ignoring my friends. He nodded. “That sounds nice.” He grinned prettily at that.
!” Draco privately thought that it was cute how excited Harry was by such a simple thing.
“Harry, what’s going on?”
Harry did the match quickly. “81%, sir.”
“HIS name is Harry, and he is perfectly well behaved when he isn’t being harassed!” Harry felt his eyes start to water at the way he was being supported for the first time ever.
“Well, you’re welcome to sit with us during classes and meal times, isn’t that right, Ron?” She phrased it like question but Harry had the feeling that Ron had to agree or he would face the consequences.
“So, where were we? Oh, the butterfly effect!”
"I can see that." Draco chuckled, cuddling Harry close against his chest. "Do you want me to read to you so you can go to sleep, bear?"
Even worse, as soon as he got onto the Hogwarts express, Hermione and Ron had to disappear off into the prefects carriage- McGonagall had decided that since there was an extra year group, an extra set of prefects would be a good idea, although he was fairly certain Draco would have lost his position.
Harry watched them interact with growing interest. He turned to Remus. “Can I get a piercing?” It’d never occurred to him before, but it suddenly seemed like a brilliant idea.
Harry pressed a hand over his mouth to contain his sniggers and Sirius drained the rest of his coffee, standing, placing the empty mug on the table and dramatically pressing his hands to his chest as if he had been shot, slowly dropping to the ground.
“She’s just gone for a fag, she’ll probably be back in 5.” She pulled out a consent form and slid it across the counter to him.
“Correct on all counts, Potter. It seems as though you may not be as big a dunderhead as you look. Now-”
Mils shrugged. “Sure, why not.”
It was then that Ron woke up, roused by his best friend's pained crying, and began to panic. Something was wrong.
Harry just stared blankly. “House?”
“She’s a Slytherin sixth year, Daphne’s sister. She’s pretty cool, actually.” He said, fondly.
Once the video downloaded, Harry handed the laptop to Draco and leant on his shoulder, showing him how to upload it to YouTube. Draco laughed to himself as he typed in the title ‘Lucius Malfoy is a shitty father | original song by Draco Malfoy’ and Harry felt himself just melt at the lovely sound. They clicked upload and soon had a link, which they sent to all of their friends with the message “Send this to Lucius Malfoy and share it!”
“It is. Here.” He shifted it, lifting up one side so I could scoot closer to him and wrap it around my shoulders too. The weight was instantly calming- it released tension I wasn’t even aware I had.
“N-no, no, I’m alright. I just…. Let’s go to a different shop?” Harry’s hands had finally stopped shaking.
“Yes.”
" A small stag, much smaller than Harry's patronus, and with less points to his antlers, formed out of the end of his wand. "For Ronald Weasley and Hermione Granger, Harry is with me, he's perfectly safe, I'm going to take him back to his room now."
“Thank you, sir.” Harry nodded.
Draco was barely half way through the book before Harry was asleep. He levitated the book back over onto the pile by the chair and brushed Harry's thick fringe out of his face. He was about to lay down properly and try to go to sleep himself when Harry's door opened softly.
“And is that alright with your parents?”
Once Draco’s bowl was empty, he leaned back in his chair and steeled himself. Taking a deep breath, he decided to just go for it.
“Well, Teddy-bear, just me and you now. I’m an orphan too, but you’ve got me. I’ll look after you, bud.” Harry felt his eyes well up as Teddy reached up one tiny hand and pressed it to his cheek. He leaned down and pressed a kiss to the boy’s forehead and leaned back, spending a few minutes just rocking Teddy.
“I know a lot of things. What I don’t know is how on earth you can stomach tea with that much sugar, but to each their own, I suppose.”
Harry kissed back passionately, perching himself on Draco's abdomen and wrapping his arms around his neck.
, he saw it was 3AM. Granger wouldn’t be in for another 4 hours. Shaking his head at himself, he made his way to the bathroom, showering and then dressing fully and grabbing his new notes before stepping through the floo and into his office.
Draco hesitated for a second, before admitting “Actually, I really want to get my eyebrow pierced, and I want to dye my hair blue.”
He was half way to his closet, ready to throw on his robes over his pyjamas and head into work when it occurred to him to check the time. Granger’s daughter, Rose, had just been born, and as such she’d cut her hours down to a regular schedule as opposed to the standard erratic hours most of the unspeakables adopted. Casting a quick
“Because you’re a gay mess who’s head over heels for Harry Lupin?” She suggested teasingly.
who was just like you but younger
"I love you, bear."
“Oh! Really?” Harry’s eyes were wide- no one had ever wanted him as much as it seemed these two men might.
“I don’t understand.”
“O-okay.”
"Check their website now, you and Draco have been outed." Harry sighed.
It took all of Harry’s self-control not to burst out laughing at that. “I’m not, I just learned this at St Brutus’ last year.”
"Of course. Molly would kill him if he tried to arrest me, you know I'm her favourite." Harry buried his nose in Draco's soft blond hair, breathing in the scent of his expensive shampoo.
kisser.” Harry took a bit of sadistic pleasure in tacking that on the end, barely restraining himself from full-on laughter at the sight of his friend’s misery.
"Mind if I join you?" He asked, and Harry secretly wanted to just melt into his voice and stay there forever.
“Because you hate me!” Draco’s face was guarded.
“Uhm, injections, I guess.” Harry remembered seeing somewhere that pills, patches and gels were all daily options, and he had a feeling he’d be likely to forget them, so injections seemed far more sensible for him.
"And how is that going?"
He had made sure he had plenty of more socially acceptable pieces, although they were mostly still in pastel colours, which he found himself much more drawn to than the bright colours- they made him feel more soft and comfortable, whereas the bright colours just felt wrong, and he was sure that he could probably pass off even a few of the more 'little' clothes he'd picked, like a few t-shirts for cartoons he'd been enjoying, or a few plush jackets modelled after characters or animals, as fashion choices, but some of them he knew he would probably never wear out of his house - that was okay, though, because he could still enjoy wearing them at home.
“Don’t be silly, Ronald.” Harry raised a brow at her. “Its clear you’re not that dangerous. I’m sure you could be if you wanted, but you’re not. So, we’re going to be friends.” Her no nonsense, matter of fact tone was what got him and he cracked a grin.
“I know.”
"Yeah, I guess that makes sense. So, what does that mean for him? Does he need to take a potion or…?"
"Good, but first- how do you actually feel about him?" She asked, her eyes penetrating in a way that made Draco want to squirm, but he didn't for risk of waking Harry.
Harry pulled together every scrap of his Gryffindor courage, and, voice cracking, asked, “What if that’s forever?”
“Brilliant! He’s the best teacher here by far.” He seemed to be about to say something else when the door was pushed open and a petite black girl bustled into their room, her timetable in her hand.
“I suppose she could, but I’m also planning on telling him that I’m never moving back to the manor and that I’m gay at the same time, so I really ought to do it myself.”
“Right, Auror Andrews. Would you mind taking me to my godson, please?”
“Right, yeah, Grimmauld definitely isn’t even nearly ready for that. I reckon I’ll move into Andromeda’s.”
“Ew! What the fuck!” Harry physically recoiled.
Snape looked vaguely impressed. “Correct. So, then, Potter, lets see… In a theoretical experiment, 1.3 g of sodium chloride is made. The maximum theoretical mass of sodium chloride is 1.6 g. What is the percentage yield?”
"S-sorry." Harry apologized, pulling away and looking down at the bed.
"Oh Merlin, this is going to be a mess." He said to himself. Just as he finished, the door from the girls hall opened and Hermione and Pansy dragged Harry in, each holding one arm, before shoving him down onto one of the sofas.
“Oh, you must be Ron’s new roommate.” Her voice was very matter-of-fact. He grunted in agreement. “I’m Hermione Granger, Ron’s girlfriend.”
“Right. Of course, you can stay here as long as you need. I’m sure Harry will be happy to share his room.”
“Good lord! What on earth has happened here?!” Her voice was high pitched and panicked at the amount of blood all over Aaron.
Harry woke up on the most comfortable, nice smelling pillow he'd ever felt. His pacifier had disappeared some point during the night, as usual, but he was still clutching his teddy bear in one hand.
She didn't seem to be treating him any differently to normal, so he hoped they'd just be pretending the night before had never happened. She floated his tray over to him along with the toast and he helped himself to 2 slices, grinning when as soon as the smell hit Ron he stirred and pulled himself up into a sitting position.
"Okay, sweetheart. Do you want to finish up here or go home? There's just this floor and the next one left." Hermione asked him.
you decided you were betrayed
“Sorry. Was it that bad, then?” He laughed lightly.
cause who i am isn't abnormal
"You can have as many as you want, Harry, you know that." Hermione reminded him. He had given her his Gringotts card to keep ahold of for him before they had set off.
"Fantastic." Harry pressed in for another kiss, this time pulling Draco away from the wall until he was entirely sat on his hips and walking him towards the boys tower, never once breaking the kiss until Harry's dorm room door was closed behind them. He pushed Draco lightly until he was laid out on his back on Harry's bed, legs spread wantonly. "Now, I believe I heard something about going all night?" He raised a brow and almost laughed as Draco, his eyes bright and his cheeks pink, nodded fervently.
“Headmistress Allan, Officer. Mr Potter here saw fit to stab a sixth former, Aaron Michels, three times.”
Kissing Draco was nothing like kissing Malcom had been. With Malcom things had been fun but there was no passion, no excitement. Kissing Draco, however, felt like the earth had somehow shifted. His lips were soft and pliant, and he leaned back against the wall, letting Harry step between his legs and deepen the kiss. Draco let out a sound that was somewhere between a gasp and a whimper and kissed back heatedly. What Harry had intended to be a quick, chaste kiss quickly devolved into a full-on snog session, pressed against the wall of Hagrid’s outside classroom.
“Harry. It’s no problem. You get settled in; I won’t be long.”
“Thanks, mate.”
“Draco. I honestly don’t know why you seem so surprised. I thought you knew I was in love with you.” Harry didn’t want to make Draco feel uncomfortable, but he genuinely thought the other boy was aware- Pansy certainly was, particularly after sharing a room with Hermione for weeks.
“Ah, right, no, Sirius was actually wrongfully imprisoned for that. The real culprit, Peter Pettigrew, was just caught, so Sirius is a free man now.” The taller man smiled nervously.
“Shit! I look good!” They both started laughing.
“I’m in love with you.”
“That’s really cool. You have a really nice voice as well.” Harry bit his lip. He could honestly just sit and complement Draco all day, and if he didn’t stop soon he was sure he was going to end up making a prat of himself.
“Uh, hi?” Harry shot a panicked look at Remus and tried to adjust the way he was being hugged so that the man wouldn’t touch his chest.
“Sirius. Not in jail?”
“Wait- what? Murdered?!” Harry’s eyes bugged almost out of his head.
“How so?” Draco knew his voice came out a bit higher than normal, and he grimaced.
you wanted a perfect son
The next morning, gossip had spread from Slytherin and to the entire school, and by the time first period rolled around, everyone was talking about how Draco Malfoy was being disowned for being gay.
"Is he alright?" Ron asked, worried.
Once Draco calmed down enough to speak, he murmured a quiet “Sorry.”
“What do you mean?” They got out of the car and walked closer to him.
Draco groaned. “
so that his catheter would be out before the end of Christmas break of his 7
“Touch me and I slit your throat. I already did my aunt’s, so don’t doubt I’d be able.” He practically snarled, but to his surprise, the man grinned in response.
"N-no. Won and 'Mione have been looking afta me, but they not my caregivers." His voice was even younger than it usually was when he was in headspace, his vulnerability evident.
Harry dropped his head and looked down to the ground, trailing after her as she waddled through the courtyard.
Harry pulled his eyes away from them to look at Draco’s face- he seemed nervous, his cheekbones dusted pink and his sharp teeth chewing lightly at his soft bottom lip. “You’re gorgeous.” Draco’s eyes widened in shock and Harry panicked- that wasn’t what he had meant to say! “I-I mean they’re gorgeous!” His face felt so hot that he knew that it would be practically crimson, but he couldn’t break the eye contact. Draco’s eyes were still wide, but his pupils were wide and his breathing was laboured. When they flicked down to look at Harry’s lips, Harry froze. He was still frozen even as Draco leaned in, surrounding him with the intoxicating scent of lemon and clove, and pressed his lips to Harry’s.
“Hot. Should dye your hair, as well, really commit to the punky-fag vibe.”
Mr Harry James Lupin walked out of Kingsley’s office with copies of his change of name and change of gender paperwork and the adoption certificate stating him as the son of Sirius and Remus Lupin, and a massive grin splitting his face in two.
“Yeah. I came out as gay so….”
for what must be the twelfth time, tapping out a rhythmic pattern on the worn spine as he read. “Potter!” He didn’t even attempt to straighten his robes before reaching out for the espresso Potter was holding towards him. As soon as he took it, the other man dropped to the floor across from him, legs crossed beneath him.
The next morning, Harry and Draco were woken up by the sound of Harry's phone ringing.
“Right, well, if you want, I’ll teach you this weekend then you can borrow my bike whenever you want, yeah?” Remus groaned, but Harry just grinned.
my personality,
Hours later, Draco was sat amidst a pile of hastily scrawled notes detailing how to build a time turner and possible adjustments he could make to the spell work when his charm sounded, startling him so violently he tore the page from which he was reading right out of the book. He cursed violently and hastily stuffed the page back into the book, collecting up his pile of notes and rushing towards Granger’s office, a smear of ink across his nose where he’d been pushing his glasses up.
“Like, being a burden and stuff.” Harry’s dark cheeks flushed red and he looked down, letting his hair flop over his face.
“Draco, I’ve had a crush on you for years. You’re gorgeous. Can I please kiss you?”
“I-oh. Uhm. Thank you, Potter.” Draco flushed, and Harry couldn’t help but think it was the prettiest thing he’d ever seen.
They’d been wrapped up together for a few hours when Draco’s body started shaking, not too severely but bad enough for Harry to notice. “Are you alright?” His voice was deep and laced with concern, which made Draco melt inside.
“Of course.” He knew he didn’t have to warn Fleur like he did the twins, and sure enough as soon as Molly handed him over, she cradled him gently against her, stroking her fingers against him softly.
“Yeah, Remus is my dad. Him and Sirius adopted me.”
In order to rectify mistakes- big changes cannot be made- Potter must be AK’d x2, horcruxes must be destroyed, DH’s must be given to Potter, DL must return 4
“Okay, good.” He settled himself on the wall beside Blaise and reached over, stealing a cigarette from his box.
"Hi, Harry. How are you feeling?" Laura asked him as he sat down.
Draco finished the song and lifted his head, flicking his hair off of his face and opening his eyes. When he saw Harry standing about a meter in front of him, he startled violently, letting out a loud yelp and overbalancing, tipping himself backwards off of the log and onto the grassy floor- Harry almost laughed as he saw Draco, instead of putting his hands down to catch himself, lift his guitar up into the air with both hands to stop it getting damaged.
He stood up and hurried out of the bathroom and towards the science corridor, smiling to himself as he heard her muffled “Love you, too, gaywad!”
“Morning, Harry. You’re up early.” Remus smiled tiredly at him.
Draco had his gun cocked right back, but Harry could see the hesitation on his face. Draco hated having to kill people, he always said it made him feel too much like his father.
The door swung open, revealing a gangly, freckle-faced ginger boy who was easily as tall as Remus. “Hi, Professor Lupin.” He smiled awkwardly at Remus and then turned to face Harry. “I’m Ron, Ron Weasley.” He stuck his hand out to shake but Harry just glanced at it and then back to Ron’s face.
Draco woke up the next morning to a soft, warm weight on his chest. Harry's head was laid on his sternum, his mouth slightly open and one arm and leg thrown over his body. His hair was somehow even messier than usual, and the pacifier he'd had in his mouth when he fell asleep had somehow disappeared during the night.
This opinion changed, however, when he walked into the classroom to see Draco Malfoy sitting in the corner, chatting lowly to a girl with frizzy, dirty-blonde hair and radishes hanging from her earrings. He flopped down on the chair across from the two of them and cast a glance around the room. Most of the students in there he didn’t recognize, although he did see one of the boys who had tried to fight him, McClaggen, and one of the boys he vaguely recognised as a fellow Gryffindor, Neville.
“Because he needed his blanket.”
so guess what, arsehole,
The next few days, Harry and Draco didn’t only sit together in potions, but also in every other class they shared. Now that they’d (mutually and unspoken) decided to leave their rivalry in the past, it had already become a common sight to see them sitting a little too close, laughing at some funny comment the other had made. Harry went to bed on Thursday night actually looking forwards to potions in the morning; Thursdays were the one day a week he had no classes with Draco, having only Defence all day while Draco had Arithmancy and Runes, and Harry had found himself missing Draco. He’d been in love with the blond for a few years, but he hadn’t ever missed him as acutely and in as brief a time as since they started spending time together- his presence was practically addictive.
"Hey, 'Mione, I-" Potter caught sight of Draco and halted. "Malfoy." He nodded, a vaguely bemused look on his face, and Draco flushed.
After dinner, Molly dug out as many baby books as she could find and sent him off home with a shrunken stack of them and a fresh treacle tart.
“Same. ‘night.”
"Okidoke, now, sing, dray!" They both flopped onto the other sofa, leaning towards one another.
“Is that so? Hm. Potter, come with me.” Harry gulped but stood up, following the blond out of the hall and into one of the deeper alcoves in the corridor. Once there, Draco leaned against the wall, crossing his arms in front of his chest. “Was Finnigan being honest or just a prat?” He raised one pointed eyebrow, which pulled Harry’s attention to his beautiful, silvery eyes.
“Draco!” Harry’s laughter was muffled, and he reached up and grabbed Draco’s wrists. Draco might be taller, but Harry was definitely stronger, and he threw the pillow across the room, flipping them over until Draco’s back was against the mattress. Draco struggled and laughed, trying to wrestle against Harry, until he just went lax and started practically giggling. Harry had Draco’s hands pinned above his head and Draco’s legs were wrapped around Harry’s waist, his face flush and smiley. It was then Harry became aware of the fact that both of them were hard and straining in their respective bottoms. His green eyes darkened, looking into the molten silver of Draco’s and Draco’s breath caught in his throat. Neither of them was quite sure which of them moved first, but suddenly they were kissing, hungrily and passionately. Harry felt his knee start to ache again and flipped them until Draco was perched in his lap, whereas he was laying down and could rest his leg whilst continuing to kiss Draco. Draco’s hands were fumbling and shaking as they grasped at Harry’s hair and shoulders, and so were his thighs where they clamped around Harry’s narrow hips, but he would be willing to put up with even the worst tremors to keep on kissing Harry.
Harry heard Ron laugh and saw Hermione flush. “Oh. Well. Anyway, he’s our best teacher. Have you met anyone else here yet?” Harry had only known her for an hour and a half, but he’d already noticed that Hermione was rather nosy.
“No. It’s fine though, I always get to eat now so…” He shrugged.
“By the way, if you don’t want to wear those stuffy old twat clothes, I’ve probably got some shit that’ll fit you.”
“Excellent to meet you, Harry. Now, your father has signed his parts of your entry paperwork, so if you could just sign these, I’ll give you your timetable and Professor McGonagall can show you to your dorm.” Harry leaned over the desk and scrawled his signature on the papers he was given. “Fantastic! Thank you, Harry. Here is your timetable, you will have all of the same classes as your roommate, one Ronald Weasley, so I’m sure he will be glad to show you around.”
“Yes, Aunt Petunia.” He sighed to himself, dragging himself off of the much too small cot he was laying on.
Research time turner function magic more fully
“Yeah, how’d you know?” Harry ran his large, square hands up and down Draco’s back.
“Mate, you’re telling me that you have a DATE with
"I- I think there's something wrong with me!" Harry sat, his head in his hands, across from his therapist.
“Of course, my apologies. Mr Potter, it seems your actual guardians were initially declined custody of you due to their being a homosexual couple, however they are still listed as your primary guardians in the system, so if both you and they are amenable, they will be able to take you in.”
Freak made his way up to the front of the hall. He wasn’t dressed in the uniform or robes, but no students or teachers were stupid enough to try to punish an Addams for dress code- they were the most feared family in the entire magical world, even more so than the Malfoys or the Lestranges. Instead, Freak wore tight black trousers, tailored with blood-red stitching, black dragonhide boots with steel toe caps, a dark red button-down shirt cuffed to his elbows, showing off the thick knots of scarring on his hands and arms from Uncle Vernon or his siblings and the black leather wand holster strapped to his right forearm, and a beautifully cursed black pendant his mother had given him that morning, his shoulder-length black hair falling in waves around his strong face. He sat himself on the stool, legs crossed elegantly and his back straight and looked disdainfully down at the students in the hall- they all looked nervous or scared, except, seemingly, for one fourth year boy at the Slytherin table, who looked…. Interested.
Sirius gasped dramatically and clutched one hand to his chest, “Betrayed! And by my own husband! You don’t love me anymore!”
He set a charm to go off when Granger reached her office and sunk into one of his many tomes, an old, almost disintegrating book as wide as the length of his forearm, his golden framed reading glasses perched precariously on the tip of his pointed nose.
“Pretty sure I do regardless.” Harry flicked the knife back and forth.
“You’re sure you’re ready, though?”
“Mate, what’s going on? Why’s everyone staring at me?”
"Yeah she-" It suddenly hit Harry what Draco had said. "Hey! I'm not small!"
Draco nodded, leaning in shyly, and Harry pressed up, hungrily capturing Draco’s lips with his own. Draco had always assumed that earth-shattering kisses were works of fiction, simple flights of fancy in the flowery romance novels his mother liked, but he had been wrong. God, he had been so wrong. Kissing Harry was like fireworks going off against his lips, like a tectonic shift when their tongues touched, and he was breathless.
“Harry?” The shorter man was staring at him as if he couldn’t believe his eyes. Harry nodded awkwardly. “Christ, you look just like your dad.”
“Because I wanted to? I know I should have asked if you were okay with it first, but I didn’t think.”
Eventually, us stopped kissing, both of us droopy-eyed and sleepy, curled together. Draco’s sleepy voice broke the silence. “Do you want to go to muggle London tomorrow? We can get you some ear defenders and stuff, and your own weighted blanket, if you want.”
Draco could barely get his breath, sobs shuddering through his body and leaving his breathing as irregular pants. ‘I want Harry’ he thought to himself, and before he could even fully think it through, he was out of his flat and half way down the stairs.
"Yes, he's been our best friend since we were eleven, so since he recently started regressing it just makes sense for us to take care of him until then, and he agrees. He did say, however, that he wanted his caregiver to be his partner."
Ron was barely able to see over the pile of pyjamas once Harry deemed he had enough, and Hermione guided him over to the underwear. At first Harry only seemed interested in the socks, and grabbed so many different packs Hermione had to take them off of him because they kept falling on the floor behind him, but she made sure he grabbed plenty of boxer shorts too.
“Oh, Lucius!” Narcissa pulled her husband up and into an embrace and leaned up to kiss his cheek chastely.
“Sometimes sacrifices are worth it, Potter.”
Draco was confused, and stated as much.
“Ronald!”
combined with the magic from a time turner was his most inspired idea yet, if he did say so himself, and if he could somehow prevent the entire second war….
“Good.” Harry smiled at him, and he felt his heart pounding so loud he was sure Harry could probably feel it too. Harry was still looking at him, his expression soft and fond, and he ran his thick fingers down the side of Draco’s face until they were just under his sharp jaw. Draco’s silver eyes were wide. “Can I kiss you?”
“Mr Potter, what is your reasoning for this…. Despicable behaviour?” Harry could see that his partner’s face was lighting up with glee at his harsh tone, her curly black hair falling around her face and giving her an even wilder look than her heavy-set dark eyes already did.
When Harry didn’t respond, Draco pulled away sharply, his pale skin flushed pinker than Harry had ever seen it and his eyes wide with panic. “I-I’m so sorry.”
“That is such
Draco smiled to himself. "Love you too, bear, goodnight." He pressed a kiss to Harry's cheek as he felt the smaller boy relax and drift off again, then quickly erected a silencing charm around him.
Harry’s answering grin was dazzling and he leaned back in, connecting their mouths with a kiss no less earth-shattering than the last.
Draco made his way towards the road, and he’d barely reached the end of the driveway when his phone buzzed in his pocket. He fished it out with his free hand and saw the text from his mother. He immediately hit call on the number she’d sent him, and after a couple of rings a woman who sounded remarkably like his mother answered, although her voice was a little deeper.
"'Mione. Not the point. So you think Harry has this age regression thing, then? Why did he never do this before?"
"No, no, of course not! He most likely just needs someone to look after him when he regresses, and he might like to buy some things for when he is regressed, such as pacifiers or plush toys."
"This- this year our dorms are single person, so my room will be okay for that, I think. I can take most of the things I got for my little space with me and just put them in there."
“I do, yeah.” Draco knew he should elaborate but he wasn’t sure how without outright saying he had sensory issues and the silk sheets were the only ones he could sleep on.
“Oh. Uhm. Ok.” Harry shifted uncomfortably. He felt sweaty, and really wanted to shower, but he knew he wouldn’t be able to get to the bathroom on his own- he still couldn’t move his leg at all and he wasn’t adept enough with his cane yet, as he’d only had it for a few months. “Uh, would you mind helping me get to the bathroom? I need a shower.”
“Y-yeah. Sorry about that.” Harry’s brown cheeks flushed.
“Yes, please.”
“You’ve made your decision, then?” Draco smirked at Harry who just rolled his eyes.
“’s me.” Harry nodded at him.
"He called you daddy?" Ron's eyebrows were almost touching his hairline.
"Okay, darling. Do you have a caregiver?" He asked with as much delicacy as he was capable of, which was far more than people tended to think.
Lucius seemed frozen in place- he was blinking quickly and his face was almost entirely blank.
“Of course! I’ll grab them for you. now, shower. And don’t take too long, I want to head out.”
“Hey, Malfoy.” Potter opened the door and
"You- you love me?" Harry knew his eyes must be wider than ever.
“Nope.” He served himself a small plate of steak and veg.
Ginny looked resigned as Luna responded brightly, "Of course, Draco! Your wrackspurts are clearing up nicely, although the adora moths are still dense around your ears." Harry had never heard of adora moths, but he had long since learned to just go with what Luna said instead of questioning it. Draco, though, seemed to know exactly what she meant.
Remus chuckled warmly. “Sorry. Good morning.”
“That’s it?!” Harry almost shouted, tightening his arms even further and splaying his palms against Draco’s back.
“I- well. I will admit I had thought that Astoria and you would be a good match, and I’m sure Gustav will be dismayed to find out that the contract will not be going ahead, however I suppose, after everything, I cannot force you to marry a woman, and I do only wish for you to be happy.” Lucius nodded his head to Draco and Draco felt his eyes well up.
"Yes. Yeah, I can- I can look into it."
Draco flushed prettily. “Still, I’m sorry.”
“Wonderful, shall we go then?”
The person behind the counter looked rather out of place among the pastels and bright colours- they were tall and dressed in all black, with dyed black hair, but they gave him a cheery smile as he walked in. "Hi, if you need any help, just give me a shout, alright?" He nodded, still a little stunned by the array of clothes.
“You have absolutely nothing to be sorry for.” The vehemence in Draco’s voice made Harry look up into his silvery grey eyes. “You have every right to cry about the shit you’ve been through, and I promise you that I’ll be here for you as long as you want me.”
July, Gryffindor House, Year 11, Transfer from St Brutus’, Dorm Assignment Gryffindor Tower room 4B, Roommate Ronald Bilius Weasley. Hogwarts does not have a uniform, however please avoid dressing inappropriately. Outfits like the one you are wearing currently are perfectly acceptable. No smoking in the dormitories, hallways, hall or classes, and violent behaviour will be punished with detention and possible suspension or expulsion.” Headmaster Dumbledore read off of his screen. “Your roommate Mr Weasley shares all of the same classes as you except for your Friday afternoon Special Ed class with Hagrid, when he has a free period, and as such he will be able to help you get accustomed to the castle. Here is a copy of your timetable, and I’m sure Remus will be happy to show you to your room, Mr Potter.” The old headmaster smiled at him, eyes twinkling. “I’m sure you’ll also be glad to know we have no rules about piercings here.” His smile almost turned into a smirk as he looked up at the little barbell through Harry’s eyebrow.
They were picking out new blankets for the living room when Harry caught sight of an abnormally fat man with a moustache and his thin, horse-faced wife. Vernon and Petunia Dursley. He felt his blood run cold.
“Why?...” Draco’s voice was small.
Apparently the store held everything from clothes, shoes, and pyjamas, to toys and plushies, to everything you could need to set up a safe space.
At the end of the period, he was all set to just leave when Luna stopped him.
“No problem.” Harry hooked his chin over Draco’s shoulder, breathing in the subtle, clean scent of the blond’s citrus shower gel.
“Edward Lupin-Potter!” Headmistress McGonagall called from the front of the hall. Harry sent his son a reassuring grin from the staff table and Teddy smiled toothily back, making his way towards the sorting hat. Half way there, he tripped over his lace, but just managed to catch himself before he fell to the floor. Everyone laughed, and Harry turned to his husband, smiling good-naturedly.
"Does it feel weird to you? When you've found yourself regressing before, has it felt wrong or strange?"
As soon as Draco finished singing, Harry stood up and started stalking towards him, green eyes darkened. Draco wasn't sure if he was about to be punched or kissed, but that was answered when Harry pushed him back against the wall and covered his lips with his own hungrily. Draco gasped at the intensity, and Harry took advantage of his open mouth to deepen the kiss. Draco's back arched towards Harry, and he distantly heard the
"Yeah!" He shouted excitedly, grabbing another box, this time from the pile under a pair of pale pink vans.
"All of them!!" Harry's eyes were wide with wonder.
Draco looked shy and nervous, and Harry thought he was the cutest fucking thing he’d ever seen. “Uhm. Yes.” And suddenly they were kissing, harsh and passionate and so sweet that neither of them could imagine ever wanting to do anything else.
No one had seen Draco since about 9PM the night before, and there was a lot of gossip about where he might have been since then.
“That I’m gay.” Draco’s voice was small and nervous.
“Oh, and what would that be?” Draco feigned ignorance; an entirely useless endeavour given the fact he’d been inside Harry’s mind not 5 minutes before.
Harry looked up into Draco's face. "I- I love you too. For years." He still felt stunned, even more so when Draco's face broke out into an uncharacteristic grin and his lips descended onto his in a gentle, tentative kiss.
year.
“Oh! No, you don’t have to, I can-”
Indeed, Harry barked a laugh, reaching out and putting his empty cup by the bed and wrapping his arms around Draco’s lithe form. “Thanks, but I think I’m good.”
Ron laughed. "Alright, all of them then. What size?"
“Ron!” She walked over to his bed, not even noticing Harry, and pressed a quick kiss to his lips before continuing to talk quickly. “How are you? My parents just dropped me off, I-” she finally seemed to catch sight of Harry and he waved awkwardly. “Hello, my name is Hermione Granger, what’s yours?”
Draco, however, burst out laughing. The sound was rich and melodious and Harry vaguely wondered if it was possible to live in someone’s laugh. The blond’s face lit up, his silvery eyes dancing.
“I do support him!” Ron’s ears went red. “I Just reckon he’s got bad taste.” At that Harry burst out laughing, Hermione and Ron joining him soon after.
“Mm, I think it’s time. And if I have to tell him the other things anyway, I figure I might as well do it all at once so he can either disown me or deal with it.” Draco laid his head back on the arm of the sofa and closed his eyes, then opened them again almost immediately so he could take a drink without pouring wine all down himself.
He had 3 new wardrobes, all painted pastel colours- one yellow, one pink, and one purple, and a set of drawers painted a light mint green, and he replaced his simple striped duvet and curtains with the super soft purple ones he'd gotten. With the addition of a plain white nightstand with cloud handles with a cute dinosaur lamp and a dinosaur patterned rug, his room was complete and perfect.
"No? Do you want me to carry you, bear?"
Ron turned a bit green. “I don’t want to think about that! Why the ferret, of all people?”
“You have English next too?” Hermione asked. He just nodded. “Oh, Professor Lupin is the best. You’ll love him.”
“Harry, what-?” He was cut off by a booming voice Harry had hoped to never hear again.
"Do you know what's wrong with him?" Ron asked, still a bit confused as to what was going on.
“Mate, Malfoy? He’s so weird looking.” Ron looked even more shocked than the others.
“I-I guess.”
“Morning.”
“Congratulations, Harry, welcome to the club.” Draco smirked at me as he opened the door for me.
“You say that, but I know you, Pans, you’d’ve probably told him in an argument, just like you did your mum.” He rolled his eyes again. He remembered the day Pansy had come out to her mum; they were 15 and Violet Parkinson had been convinced that him and Pansy were secretly shagging and kept trying to catch them at it since they always locked her bedroom door when they were hanging out, and once Pansy had figured out what she was doing, they’d gotten into a screaming match where Pansy had yelled that she was “a raging bloody lesbian” and admitting that she’d been sleeping with Millicent Bullstrode since the end of year 9. Draco had spent the entire argument trying to blend into the wall and not burst out laughing at the expression on Mrs Parkinson’s face.
Somehow, walking into school on Tuesday garnered him even more attention than the day before had, and he couldn’t for the life of him figure out why. That is, until he sat down with his friends and was passed the
It was almost a week since most of the boys left when someone finally came to sort out Harry’s arraignments. Officer McKinnon arrived with two men and headed straight to Harry’s room.
my honesty,
“Why’d you do that?” He asked, and Draco flinched so violently he almost fell over.
“Harry Potter.”
It took about three tries before Neville's legillimens broke through, and Harry was violently flung into a memory from when he was around 9.
Remus laughed. “You couldn’t tell? Between the eyes and the melodrama, its pretty obvious.”
“N-not at all.” Draco’s voice cracked but he hoped that Harry hadn’t noticed.
"Uh, can you explain it please?" Harry always found he absorbed information better when things were explained to him out loud.
“Draco, calm down a minute, alright? What do you mean, why?” Harry threaded his fingers back through Draco’s hair gently.
Harry didn’t even have a chance to reply before Ron cut in. “Actually, I’m perfectly fine with Harry being my roommate. Maybe you should look into not being a prick, eh, mate?”
“You know, Draco, that’s actually a really good song.” Andi smiled at him. “Do you know what you should do?” He cocked his head. “Record it and get all your friends to send it to him.” She winked devilishly.
“Still, sorry.” He muttered, dropping his head, but just then Harry pulled him back towards him and against his chest.
“Oh, shit. And your father’s homophobic?” Harry wasn’t the best at being empathetic, but he was trying his best. Draco nodded.
"Nah, Ron'll smooth it over for me, don't worry about it." Harry's best friend, Ron Weasley, was the head of the ministry's department of law enforcement, and as such was technically Harry's boss, although he never really acted like it.
“Okay, Harry, follow me, Gryffindor Tower is just this way.” Remus smiled down at him and led him down a series of insanely confusing corridors until he reached a large painting of a fat woman in a pink dress. “This painting is over the doorway, just pull it like this,” Remus tugged gently on the right side and it swung open on a hinge, revealing a small set of stairs. Remus headed straight up and Harry followed him, pulling the painting/door closed after him. “Then this is the common room, where all the Gryffindors tend to hang around when they’re not in their rooms, and your room is just up here.” Remus led him up 4 flights of stairs and then knocked on the door labelled ‘4B’. “Ron? Your new roommate is here!”
"O-okay." Harry's voice was small and childlike as he made his way over to the case of dummies. He picked out a big box of different coloured plain ones and dropped his head, putting them on top of the pile of shoes and grabbing a couple of different sippy cups.
been this person!”
, we’re not talking about me, here, we’re talking about you. And I’d really rather you keep yourself safe, alright?” Harry seemed almost hopelessly sincere.
She felt her eyes well up at that- “Oh,
“Y-yeah, I will.”
Harry thought for a second. "N-no."
Draco looked at him incredulously. “Potter, you could ask her if you could have an alligator in the school and she’d sort it. You’re
"Okay, Harry. Are you done with the clothes then?" He nodded, seeing the huge piles both Ron and Hermione were holding and remembering the even larger pile already behind the counter.
but only if you're who i want you to be"
Draco shuddered theatrically, and Harry let out a quick bark of laughter, making Draco jump a little.
Harry woke up tucked in a huge bed, still wearing Remus’ sweater and his boxers and wrapped up in a heavy, downy duvet. He smiled to himself, stretching like a cat and rolling his neck before padding barefooted out of the room. The floors of the hallway were rustic stone and he felt a shiver run through his whole body as he made his way towards what he thought might be the living room. He was right, and when he entered, he saw Remus curled up on one of the armchairs, a large cup of coffee in his hands.
A familiar voice sounded behind him. “Pretty sure you’re already mental, kid.” He turned so fast he thought he might give himself whiplash to see Nym stood behind him in an almost identical outfit to his, only with black boots and yellow plaid jeans.
were you thinking?!”
“No problem. Also, if you need me to beat Theo up, that’s chill.”
.” The nasty blond, Smith, sneered at him.
“Neville. Do you want to talk about it?” Harry offered.
Draco looked stunned, and I was sort of worried that he was going to kick me out when he pulled me into another kiss. “I’m in love with you too. Since we met, more or less.”
“If that’s okay with you, yes, absolutely.”
Harry was smiling at the word-vomit coming out of Draco; he didn’t think he’d ever heard him talk this much, and even though Harry didn’t necessarily understand everything he was saying, it was terribly endearing to see the boy he’d been in love with for years so enthusiastic. “That’s incredible. I know Hermione and Ron’s dad, Arthur, have both been trying to figure out a way to get muggle technology functioning around magic, so if you wanted to talk to Hermione about it, I’m sure she’ll be interested.” He grinned crookedly.
“Detention. Never speak to me like that. Tomorrow evening you will be spending an hour scrubbing beakers.”
Instead of replying verbally, Draco leaned in and pressed his lips to mine, both of our eyes closing this time. He clutched the front of my sweater and I kept my hand on the side of his jaw as I traced his lips with my tongue. Draco gasped at the sensation, his mouth opening and his tongue coming out to meet mine. He tasted slightly sweet, like he’d just eaten fruit, and his mouth was warm and soft and lovely. After a few minutes, he pulled back. “Why?”
Regardless, the center was closed down. The boys were allowed to go home with their families until further arraignments were made, and those like Harry, who had no families to return to, were allowed to stay in their rooms. The night most of the boys left, Harry picked the lock to the storage room and nicked all of the trousers, boots, pyjamas and t-shirts that would fit him, along with one of the black backpacks that no one ever got (not even him). He would be the first to admit that he had grown incredibly fond of the uniform, and he knew it wasn’t so obviously a uniform that he would be unable to get away with wearing it in public, wherever he was sent. Besides, good clothes and shoes are good clothes and shoes.
"Most likely." Draco shrugged. "I wonder what they'll all say when they find out we're getting married." He mused, twisting the ring on his left hand with a slight smile. "Do you have work today?"
you told me
“There’s that sorted, then. I’ll let you get settled in and see you at dinner this evening.” Dumbledore nodded to them and headed up the stairs.
“Oh, Diddums, darling, do have a lovely day at school!” Petunia simpered sickeningly and Harry slid out of the kitchen as silently as possible and back into his cupboard, changing into his ‘school uniform’. It was actually just some of Dudley’s old clothes dyed a dingy grey, but as it was the correct colour, none of his teachers cared enough to correct the fact that they were not technically the correct uniform. Stonewall High was a state school in the lower-class area, and as such students wearing hand-me-downs or even torn clothing was practically expected. Pulling on his trainers, which were Dudley’s from when he was eight and were definitely not the correct shape for shoes anymore, let alone the fact they were being held together with duct tape, he slipped the pocket knife out of his pyjamas and into his school trousers and exited the house and quietly and unobtrusively as possible.
She huffed. “Yes, well, I really don’t know that much about Autism, so I need to do some research. Harry, I’m glad you told us. I love you.” She leaned in and gave me a quick hug, before turning and heading towards the door, grabbing Ron’s arm on her way out.
Draco took a deep breath and nodded. “T-thank you, doctor.” He stood up and made his way over to the office door, twisting his fingers into the large stitches at the wrists of his sweatshirt. Once out of the office, he kept his head down, hair falling into his face as he walked through the waiting room as quickly as he could, pulling out his mobile phone. He wasn’t sure how he was going to cope without it when he returned to Hogwarts….
, and Harry felt their large, thin fingers rest against his shoulder. He flinched, but then settled when they didn't dig in. "Harry? Are you alright?" Draco's voice was laced with concern.
“As I’m sure some of you have noticed, we have a new student this term. Harry Potter is a transfer from St Brutus’ Secure Centre for Incurably Criminal Boys, and will now be a member of Slytherin House. I hope to see you all welcome him warmly.”
“Yeah, what she said. Charlie and dad are autistic, too, you know. Wait, that probably means I know more about something than Hermione!”
“You thought this was
Harry's voice was small, but not young, when he finally responded. "You don't…. Think it's weird?"
"Right, good, I suppose. I have a feeling they'd both hex me otherwise." Draco remarked, and Harry cracked a lopsided grin.
” Harry’s voice and eyes were flat, and his textbook was closed in front of him.
"Pans, I don't know. I don't know why he would be."
“You should probably buy it, then.” He raised one brow.
Harry laughed good-naturedly. “Fair enough. I guess that plus the whole lack of consent thing would make it pretty gross.”
“Y-yes.” Harry gulped- this was a woman not to be messed with.
“Bet I can make me’sen worth ya time.” The boy had an arrogant grin. He was handsome, Harry would give him that. Tall and thin, with golden skin and dirty-blond hair.
“Yeah. Right, I’ll just upload this to my laptop then we can post it, yeah? Do you wanna smoke while it uploads?” Harry knew he was blushing but hoped his darker skin would cover it. It didn’t.
“I’ve liked you since the first day, too.”
"Y-yeah, sure. Why?" Harry pulled himself up into a sitting position, wrapping his arms around his skinny legs.
Harry, and so Harry told him to shove off. He didn’t even particularly
“You’re not actually that bad, you know?” Harry tilted his head and opened his eyes, pinning Draco with his green gaze and smiling crookedly.
“What the fuck me? What the fuck you! Draco Lucius Malfoy, I’d better never hear you say anyone is too good for you again!” she reprimanded him.
"So, you and Draco are a couple now?" Laura leaned in interestedly.
you told me
Pansy laughed. “You sure that’s a good idea, love?”
He froze as he heard footsteps coming towards him, and looked up just in time to see Harry Potter step through the doorway across from him. Harry’s hair was messier than ever, flopping down into his vibrant green eyes- eyes which widened as they landed on Draco. He knew he must look a mess, his hair waving all over the place, his hand bloodied and his eyes red-rimmed and almost wild.
“Do you swear it’s safe?” Draco felt like he couldn’t breathe, panic at the thought of other misinformed students much older and stronger than him trying to take revenge on him for something he hadn’t even done- he’d always been an anxious person, and this attack had just tipped him over the edge a little.
Risks:
but only if theyve been approved of by me"
When they got home that evening, Harry just waved a hand to put all of their shopping away and dropped down onto the sofa as Draco unlatched Teddy from his pram and headed into the kitchen to make him a quick bottle. Once that was sorted, the blond sat himself on the other end of the sofa, feeding Teddy and toeing off his boots.
“See you in September, Mx Greenfeld.”
He spent the rest of the day holed up in the library finishing his song, and then at 7:45 started making his way back to the eighth year tower. He was absolutely terrified, but if both pansy and Hermione thought it was a good idea....
He had expected to be led to her office for some sort of disciplinary action, but instead wen he looked up he realized they were in the reception area, and he looked at the Headmistress confusedly.
Harry raised a brow at him. “Harry Potter.” He nodded.
“Oh, you don’t have to-”
“I-I’m sorry, I had a r-really awful dream. I’m sorry.” Harry reached out and pulled Draco into his flat, wrapping his arms around the taller man as he practically collapsed against Harry, burying his face into his shoulder.
“Aw, is little retard-boy gonna cwy?” He jeered.
Draco’s drawling voice answered. “Better? I used to be ignorant. And he’s not an it, you disgusting cretin.”
“I just can’t believe anyone would treat a child like that! Its horrible! Why did they think that was even remotely okay?”
The taller man, Remus, smiled warmly at him. “Absolutely.”
Harry used the arm he was still grasping and pulled Draco into his lap, only just managing to stay balanced as the taller boy’s weight landed on him. “Draco.” Harry was intending to say more, but as soon as Draco looked up, Harry couldn’t help but pull him into a kiss- a proper kiss this time, and he could hardly believe how good it felt. Even kissing Ginny had never felt as wonderful and earth-shattering as this. Draco almost whimpered into his mouth, pressing himself as close to Harry as he could get. When they pulled apart, both gasping for breath, Draco tucked his head into the side of Harry’s neck, and Harry turned so his face was buried in the soft blond hair. “I love you too. Since at least sixth year, maybe longer.” He ran his hands under Draco’s sweater and up and down his back.
“Hello, Harry Potter. I’m Luna Lovegood. You’re here for behavioural issues.” The blonde girl was suddenly right in his face, leaning so close the odd necklace she was wearing brushed his chest.
Potter is well known to be ruthless and dangerous, trusting very few people and avoiding any signs of vulnerability-
“Okay, thank you, sir.”
“Nope. Not at all.”
As if called by the word ‘baby’, Molly stepped out of the kitchen in a flour-covered apron.
Harry raised his eyebrow. “Harry.”
Harry nodded enthusiastically. "Yes pwease!"
Harry was a very curious person- he couldn’t walk away from a good mystery, and it had gotten him in trouble lots of times, both at Hogwarts and before, and he figured that a mysterious boy playing muggle songs in the forbidden forest at lunch on a Hogsmeade weekend was as good a mystery as any. He followed the sound of the voice, and the closer he got, the louder and more emotional the voice got.
“I’m proud of you! You’ve far less Nargles around you, now that your father is out of the picture. It’s a shame the Slashkilters got to him.” He hugged her back softly and hummed his agreement.
“He’s not that bad, and you’ve got to admit he’s bloody gorgeous.”
Draco huffed and rolled his eyes. “Harry, I know. Come here, love. it’s fine.”
“I mean yeah. I heard you vocal stimming before I came in, and you’ve been rocking back and forth this entire time, and you said a bunch of stuff that sounds like you’re probably autistic, or at least have some kind of sensory issues.” He shrugged awkwardly.
He couldn't keep the bounce out of his step or the smile off his face as he made his way to the shop, and as soon as he stepped inside he had to just stop for a moment to take it all in.
"Yes!"
“Oh.” I knew my face would be bright red now.
“Hey.” Harry smiled crookedly up at Draco.
It was Monday afternoon and Harry was distracted. Not super surprising given that he was in potions class, but what was different this time was the concern he was feeling. He’d been spacing out staring at his potions partner of the day, Draco Malfoy, as was essentially routine at this point, when he noticed the way the blond’s hands were shaking. He seemed to be attempting to chop the ginger root, but this was the trickiest stage of the stomach-soothing potion; the ginger had to be in tiny, even slivers, otherwise it would induce vomiting. The harder Draco tried to focus, the more violently his hands shook. Harry looked down at his own ginger- it was perfectly prepared and sitting on his cutting board. Before he could even think about it, he leaned over and switched their cutting boards, settling back onto his stool to chop up his second load of ginger. They weren’t technically allowed to sit whilst brewing, but Slughorn turned a blind eye on account of Harry’s bad knee. One of the Carrow’s had hit him with a dark curse that ripped through the muscle during the final battle, and now it was liable to give in if he stood too long, and led to him requiring a cane to get around when it flared up. Harry was so focussed on getting the second load of ginger just as perfect as the first, he entirely missed Draco’s incredulous staring. The blond almost couldn’t believe that had just happened- he had no idea why Harry had helped him.
“There’s a new librarian?” She leaned forward interestedly.
Instead of shaking the proffered hand, Freak grasped it and brought it to his lips, pressing a soft kiss to the back. “Freak Addams, the pleasure is mine, amado mío.” The blond’s cheeks pinkened and Freak smirked.
“The day Lucius sodding Malfoy is supportive of anything I do, let alone any queer person, is the day I’ll… I don’t know, fancy a bird.” Draco’s bloodshot eyes were watering as he laughed.
"Uhm, hi? Do you mind if I leave these here while I go to the other floors?" He enquired quietly.
Draco was rather impressed that he had made it almost three weeks without having a meltdown, but then he woke up one Friday morning feeling the worst he’d felt in months. He had to cast a silencing charm around his head for most of the day and had a transcribing quill copy out all of the professors’ words so he could do his work, and he had to attend his classes in the clothes he’d usually never wear out of his room- thick, fleece-lined leggings, a hoodie that fell down to his knees and slipper boots instead of shoes and socks. He knew he was getting stared at all day, but he just couldn’t muster up the energy to care.
“God, growing up with the Dursleys, you just saw what they’re like, I was told that not being white, being queer, being basically anything outside of what they said was normal, was this horrible thing, but Freddie Mercury was an embodiment of all that. I used to listen to their music whenever I could on their radio, and my neighbour, Mrs Figg, she loved them, and it was just insane to see someone who was just like me doing something so amazing.” Harry felt his cheeks pinken as he realized what he said, but Draco just smiled at him.

“No. There’s only Aunt Marge left, and she’d be more likely to set her dogs on me again than let me in to her house.”
“No way, Dray, your da’s bloody terrifying.”
“Love you too, idiot. Now let’s go get something to eat, because I’m starving.”
“I’m Remus Lupin. I’m your godfather’s husband. He’s just signing the paperwork for us to get full custody and adopt you with Kingsley.” The man, Remus, was soft spoken and kind, with a welsh accent and light brown hair.
He groaned. “
It was only when his pillow shifted that he remembered exactly what he was lying on- he looked up and locked eyes with Draco Malfoy, who's silver eyes were droopy with sleep.
"Y-yes pwease." Harry's voice was small, younger sounding than Draco had ever heard it, and he felt something inside him melt- every fiber of his being was screaming at him to look after this precious boy, and he certainly wasn't going to argue. Harry took his hand as they headed out into the corridor, and Draco squeezed it reassuringly.
The inside of the store was intense; just the first floor was packed to the brim with clothing, and Harry felt his mind start to slip into giddy excitedness. He rocked up onto the balls of his feet and craned his neck so he could see further, albeit not much further given how short he was. The clothes were split into brights and pastels, and he found himself drawn immediately to the pastel colours of the left side. Almost completely forgetting about Ron and Hermione, he headed over to the first stand and started grabbing xxs sizes in any of the trousers, shorts and dungarees he liked. Before long his arms were full, and he looked down morosely before remembering Ron and Hermione, and ran back over to them and thrust his pile into Ron's arms.
School was no better. Dudley, luckily, didn’t go to Stonewall with him, but some of his friends, Piers and Malcom, did, so they were always there to make his life a living hell in Dudley’s absence. None of the teachers cared, even when he was left with broken bones and concussions, and they refused to use his real name either. Only one of the librarians, Mx Greenfeld, ever treated him properly, but their co-workers never listened to them or used their correct pronouns either. He’d long since started carrying an old pocket knife with him so that he could at least defend himself against some of the more brutal attacks, but busted up knuckles and a rusty knife were never enough to really dissuade people from picking on him.
“Yeah, sure, but… Malfoy, Harry, really?”
“I thought I warned you
“Look, do you want to come in for a cuppa or something?”
Harry had thought he’d had feelings for Draco before, but walking out of his room to see him sitting cross-legged on the floor playing with Teddy made everything he’d ever felt for him crash over him all at once, more intense than when he’d realized he was in love with Draco in sixth year.
Once Harry had finished with the shoes (and Ron had grabbed himself a pair of bright red converse to replace his old sneakers, which he could afford from helping Fred and George out at Wheezes), he made his way over to the other side of the floor, which was full of things like dummies, bottles and sippy cups.
The room wasn’t particularly large, but it wasn’t as small as Draco had feared. There were two double beds and nightstands with curtains around them, two wardrobes and then a rug and a window seat in the middle of the room. Everything was in neutral tones, which wasn’t Draco’s preference but he supposed it was to avoid house colours. He immediately headed over to his bed and stripped off the covers, folding them and placing them on the bottom of his wardrobe, and then replacing them with the silk set he’d fetched from his own bed. He felt Harry staring at him and turned to him.
“Oh, same reason. Plus, Hagrid is lovely. It’s always nice to see him.” Her voice was dreamy and lilting, and Harry thought she seemed a little bit insane. He rather liked her.
“My- my change of name?” Harry’s breath hitched in his throat.
“Uhm. Alright then. Yeah, sure.” He knew he must look like a mentally deficient owl with how much he was blinking, but the men just grinned at him.
“Jesus fucking Christ, Lupin! You scared the living shit out of me!” Harry couldn’t hold in a bit of a snigger at that.
Sirius seemed almost startled. “Of course, me and my husband- we just want him to be happy, whatever he needs.”
Draco rolled his eyes. “I found Harry having a meltdown, and as I am also autistic, I recognised the signs, then once he calmed down, I took him to Madame Pomfrey to get diagnosed, and then we came back here, and because of the noise in the common room I needed to sooth myself before I ended up having a meltdown, so we had to come in here so I could get my weighted blanket.”
“Malfoy…. Andi was killed this morning.” He knew it came out too blunt, but he had no idea how one was supposed to break that sort of news.
“Oh, fuck yes.” Harry leaned up and threaded one square hand into Draco’s fine blond hair, pressing their lips together. The kiss deepened, and Harry walked them backwards until Draco’s legs hit the side of the bed and he fell. Harry positioned himself comfortably and continued kissing him until Draco broke away.
They arrived at St Brutus’ at 18:00 on the dot, and Harry dragged his black trash bag of Dudley’s old clothes towards the reception doors. The metal fencing and barbed wire was somewhat daunting, as were the gangs of boys, mostly older than him and all dressed in black t-shirts and combat trousers, gathered in the courtyard, but he comforted himself with the thought that he would never again have to see the Dursley’s, and besides, he had a knife tucked away in an old, knobby pair of mustard-yellow socks that used to be Vernon’s, so he would at least have a way to defend himself if needs be.
“Harry?” She let go of Sirius and turned to Harry. “Oh my god!” She launched herself at him and almost toppled him over. “Oh my god, you look so much like your dad!” She pulled back to look down into his face. “God, your eyes are just like Lily’s. So, you want your eyebrow done? Same side as the scar or opposite?”
“Now, I’m aware this must be a distressing situation to be in, particularly today of all days, however there are the matters of Teddy’s custody and Andromeda’s will that must be dealt with today.”
“Why did you do that?”
Draco hummed. “Okay, good talk…. And for the record, you’re right, you really ought have known I were gay- I’ve never been particularly subtle about it.” He looked Nott up and down with one of his patented sneers that always made Harry’s heart flutter and whoever it was directed at cower back slightly, and turned away, walking into the great hall with Harry’s arm still firmly around him.
In the accessories, he picked out two different bags- one was very childish, with dinosaurs all over it and a dinosaur plush keychain attached, and the other was more wearable for everyday, a muted lilac with no designs, but the inside had lots of little pockets that he thought would be perfect for carrying things when he was back at Hogwarts. He also found a pack of 5 different pastel beanie hats, each with a different coloured tag on the front, and a plush my melody hat that felt incredibly soft.
Remus looked over at Harry and made eye contact, his mouth tugging into a wry grin. “You know he’s Sirius’ cousin?” Harry shook his head. “Yup, on his mother’s side. Now, come on in.”
Clearly something he said must have been correct, because her stern expression gave way for a genuine smile. "You should tell him that. Now, Ron, let's go."
Try to change,
Draco laughed. "That is certainly very true."
’ Harry tilted his head to the side in question.
“Come in!” Hermione almost shouted. “I’m very interested, how on earth did you manage it? I’ve tried what feels like everything I could find.”
“This is the Slytherin table.”
I sighed.
“Things get too much for me too.” I was surprised by that.
"Harry! Have you seen the prophet yet?" Hermione practically shouted down the line and Harry winced. Draco sniggered at him, laying his head back down onto Harry's bare chest and closing his silvery eyes.
“I said objectively speaking, so not just your girlfriend! Like, I’m most attracted to Dean, obviously, but objectively I’d say Zabini.”
“Harry! Come here.” She held her arms out wide and he immediately stepped into her embrace, balancing Teddy on one hip.
going to treat you differently because of who you are and what you’ve done, so you need to
"Mm. I had noticed…. Your issues with food." Draco said a little awkwardly. "If you ever… need someone to talk to about it, I'm sure you'd feel more comfortable going to Weasley or Granger, of course.. but if you like, you can talk to me too."
He finally seemed to catch sight of Harry's outfit and asked, "Are you attempting to turn
“Potter, this will be your bed. You can do whatever you wish to it, and the lockable drawer is for any personal items you may want to keep safe. Now, before I leave you, do you have any sensible requests for next week?”
"Mm. So do I." Harry smirked, pulling out of the embrace. "Come on, let's go home."
“But why?” Draco couldn’t comprehend why someone like Harry would bother with someone like him.
“Jesus fuck! You scared the shit out of me!” Harry whipped around, pulling his fag out from between his lips.
"It's great! It's really, really wonderful. He's so…. I don't even know how to describe it. I love him so much. And he loves me as well." Harry looked down at his hands, smiling to himself.
The second floor was full of pyjamas and underwear, and Harry had already loaded Ron up with piles and piles of onesies and pyjama sets.
Draco just rolled his eyes and put the pipe to his lips, holding his lighter over the half-burned weed and taking a deep breath in. a few seconds later he exhaled, intentionally blowing the smoke back into Pansy’s face and sniggering as she scrunched up her already upturned nose. “I need this more than you, you slag.”
“Draco. Draco Malfoy.” He introduced himself, and god- Harry almost wanted to laugh at the ridiculous name, but somehow it suited him perfectly. He just nodded, handing the lighter back over and looking up to the sun rising over the forest.
The entire group looked gobsmacked, until Seamus started sniggering. “Good one, mate!” Everyone else joined in until they noticed Harry’s confused face.
"We c'n finish." His voice was muffled.
“Thank you, professor.”
“Fuck you.” The door slammed as Harry left and Draco collapsed onto the floor where he stood.
“What do you want?” Harry scowled.
“Oh, darling, you really are gone over him, aren’t you?” Her face was full of sympathy.
“Freak Addams…”
“I’m sorry.” Draco moved as if to stand up, but Harry reached out and grabbed his forearm.
“W-what?!” Draco blushed even brighter, if such a thing were possible.
“Divergi Diagnosi.” Madame Pomfrey waved her wand in a complex pattern and I felt the tingly spell settle over me. Thankfully, it only lasted a few seconds before dissipating, leaving behind an odd grey glow. I looked over at Draco, who smiled at me- he really was very attractive, particularly when he smiled. I was still somewhat embarrassed that he had seen me earlier, but I was also thankful that instead of looking down at me for it, he’d been helpful and even kind. And the way he’d held my hand made a traitorous part of me think that, just maybe, he might like me back. Unlikely, but still, a guy can dream, right?
“Okay, great! Kingsley just needs you to sign a bit of paperwork, stating your change of name and gender- if you want- and your adoption.”
Harry cut him off. “Don’t be fucking stupid. I’m not making a scene; I’m going to bed. Hopefully tomorrow I won’t be gawped at or fucking challenged when I try to eat. Goodnight, sir.”
“Are you alright with us driving home tonight? If you’d rather we can get a hotel, but Moony said he’ll be fine to drive, though it’s about 9 hours back to Hogsmeade. You’re fine to sleep in the car though, I know I will be.”
Draco started to shake his head automatically, but then stopped and nodded- he did want Harry to know. “I guess we’ve both got shitty Aunts. Before my occlumency shields were good enough, Aunt Bella got through and found something out, and then spent the next few days torturing me for as long as she could without driving me insane.” He shuddered. “She didn’t stop until Mrs Weasley killed her. I really have to thank her for that sometime.” He smiled weakly. Harry tightened his arms, pulling Draco right against his chest.
Pansy caught his eye and mouthed ‘Calm down’ at him, and he took a deep breath and tucked his other hand into his sleeve to use both to twist the plastic back and forth. He wasn’t sure why muggles made everything out of plastic, but he would admit that the textured bobbles on the surface of the toy felt much nicer than they would have were they made out of metal or glass like most wizarding items.
“Harry!” That was all the notice he got before the man flung himself at him, crushing him in a hug that seemed much tighter than the man looked like he could manage- he was slim and around 5 inches shorter than Harry, who wasn’t particularly tall to begin with. “Oh my god, oh my god, I can’t believe its you! You look just like your dad!” The man sobbed into his shoulder.
After a little while, Harry pulled back a bit. “Draco, will you be my boyfriend?”
Hogwarts was far better than Stonewall had been. Of course, that didn’t mean much, but still. He liked it. He had actually become rather close with Ron and Hermione in the two months since term started, and he had even joined his house football team. Of course, he couldn’t wear his normal binder to play sports, but Sirius had bought him one specifically made for sports before term started so he could do PE. The captain of the team, Angelina Johnson, had almost immediately picked Harry at try-outs- she’d told him later on that she barely even wanted to watch the others after seeing him play.
"Is this it, then, 'Mione?" Ron looked up at the tall grey building in front of them. It was directly across the road from a tattoo studio and was far taller than any of the other buildings in the area, but it was otherwise entirely nondescript.
“Don’t be a selfish bitch, Dray.” She giggled.
“O-okay. Yeah. I can do that.”
“You will have to wait until you’re 16 for the surgeries, and I’m afraid the surgeon I work with, Dr Jones, doesn’t offer them at the same time, but once you have been on hormones for 6 months you will be able to book in for both. I would recommend top surgery first; however, it depends on which would be most necessary for alleviating your dysphoria, and of course, your personal preference. In 6 months if you want to book them in, you will have the options for which surgeries you would like, and I’ll provide you with some information on the different options you have. If you want to just book in a general check-up with your GP and call me afterwards, I’ll get your prescription sent through. Would you prefer pills, injections, patches or gel, do you think?”
"When he gets over Malfoy, you mean." Ron rolled his eyes- Harry's obsession with Malfoy wasn't exactly a secret, and he'd confided in them about a week before that he was actually in love with the blond.
Draco blushed prettily. “N-no, you don’t have to do that.”
“God, I hope so.” He was about to say more when Shacklebolt came back out of the office. He blinked at him. “That was quick.”
“Alright. My rooms are this way.” Remus grabbed one of Harry’s bags off of him and headed down the corridor towards another set of stairs that led to the professors’ suites.
Rays of sunlight were piercing through Draco’s eyelids. ‘that was an incredibly unfair dream’ he thought to himself, snuggling down into…... something that definitely wasn’t his bedding. His eyes shot open, and he saw that he was laid on Harry Potter’s sweater-clad chest, the desi man’s strong arms curled around him. ‘so, not a dream…. Good to know.’ He pressed his face into Harry’s broad shoulder, closing his eyes again and revelling in the spicy, smoky scent of Harry. He felt the shorter man start to stir, and was entirely expecting to be shifted away, and so was incredibly surprised to feel Harry pull him tighter against him, one square, brown hand moving to card through his soft blond hair. Draco looked up into Harry’s face, and flushed when he saw his green eyes watching him.
"Hello, sweetheart. Just go back to sleep, we love you." Hermione kept her voice low.
“Marvelous. Thank you ever so, Officer Riddle.” Vernon nodded to the taller, more slender man and shook his hand vigorously before dragging Harry off towards the car and shoving him into the back seat. Harry vaguely realized that nobody had thought to take the knife off of him and pushed it further down into his pocket.
“You were disowned?! What? Why?!” Potter looked shocked. “Is that why you’ve, like, had a total style change? Wait, is that why you have that shirt? I’m pretty sure Sirius has the same one.”
“Okay, you’re okay, sweetheart, I’ve got you, come on.” Harry kept one arm around Draco as he pushed his door closed and guided the blond towards his bedroom. Draco kept repeating “I’m sorry” in gasping breaths as Harry got him into his room and pulled him towards the bed until they were laid side by side, Draco tucked against Harry’s chest. “Okay, love, do you want to tell me what your dream was about?”
