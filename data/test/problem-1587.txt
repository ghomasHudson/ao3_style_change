“You will all hopefully remember that our theme this term is ‘magical community defence’ and your homework for the weekend was to find an article or photograph from a newspaper or magazine that shows magical community defence or a need for it. We’ll go around the room. Ms Greengrass?”
When tea and cake were ordered and on the way, Hermione pulled out a biro and a huge notebook with coloured tabs stuck to a number of pages. “We’re really excited to do this,” she said. “I know it seems unusual, but this sort of thing is very popular in the Muggle world. I think we can make your wedding one everyone talks about for years to come, and you won’t have to worry about a thing.”
And Grand Granger-Potter Parties were indeed going for the volcano theme for Padma and Theo’s wedding. Hermione had insisted on adding
“Morning sickness should stop soon and then the first thing I’m going to do is eat an entire fucking eggless-German Chocolate cake.”
He pulled Snape’s portrait from his bag and stuck it to the front of his robes with a quick charm. Appeased, Snape quit whinging, although Harry was nearly certain he would be only slightly happier with the view of Malfoy’s torso he currently had.
“I found a picture from one of Celestina Warbeck’s old Muggle concerts before she faked her death so they wouldn’t think she was living too long. It was in New York in 1991 and afterwards two Muggles saw her Apparate away from the back of the concert hall. They had to be Obliviated, obviously, and that caused a lot of stir because it was the first time a Muggle had had to be Obliviated in the US since the 1970s. They get really upset about Obliviating Muggles over there. They say it infringes on the Muggles’ rights. Now their magical Congress is going back and forth about how much their government should do to protect the magical community from exposure to Muggles.”
Orkney was very pleased. Unsurprisingly. “Oh, very good, Ms Greengrass. And an excellent insight into how a single concert can affect an entire community’s safety. Full marks.” Daphne beamed.
“Welcome and welcome back, sisters and brothers, to this year’s first gathering of the Order of the Golden Cup,” said Alick Macmillan. “Last year, a test of faith and skill awarded the dual positions of high druid to my sister-in-magic, Emily Abbott, and me. We call this gathering to order. Do any among you challenge our leadership in ritual for the duration of this school year?”
Draco looked extremely discomfited, especially as he was still half-covered by his mother, who would not let go of him any more than Harry would his hand.
Lucius smirked. “Your revenge turned out to be less revenge and more personal gain. There’s nothing wrong with that.”
“Cold,” Harry said, immediately. “It's skin was ice cold and clammy, like death. And it was tall and thin, stringy muscle. It was wearing clothes but the fabric felt strange.”
Draco smirked at Harry over his shoulder as he swept inside, navy blue robes fanning out behind him, not at all unlike Snape’s. Damn it, Harry had worked hard to copy that billow with his own robes, and it wasn’t right that Draco could do it, too, and probably better.
They needed a huge, global spell to return not just Atlantis, but the whole Earth, to a hidden place out of time and space. A place the aliens couldn’t find them again until they were magically and technologically advanced enough to protect themselves more directly. That could take centuries—centuries they would need to live through, not trapped in frozen time. And with a surface area of 196.9 million square miles, the Earth was not a small project.
Harry stared at the camcorder again, swallowing heavily. A thousand things came to mind. He said none of them, thank god. “I don’t know.”
Just then, Professor Croaker, their resident celebrity, slunk in. Having been an Unspeakable for three-quarters of a century, his talent for remaining unnoticed was here to stay. The students all thought he was dead cool for that, and Harry could count on one hand the students who’d not chosen to take Croaker’s Theory of Magic & Spell Creation class. He was an all-around nice chap, though, and gave Harry a smile and a wave as he glided by on soundless feet, just like a happy Dementor.
He was lucky he’d been behind the wards today. Those Ravenclaws and Slytherins had looked absolutely spell-shocked coming back from their Muggle Immersion trip.
Belatedly, Harry remembered what they’d actually left to accomplish. He fished out a vial. Navy blue potion sloshed around in it. “Liver Repair. Draco said it’s perfect. Have a look.”
She nodded. “That’s always the case, but I think they would’ve been proud no matter what.” Thankfully she turned to look in front of her as the steppes curved around.
That, Harry thought, was a brilliant idea, too. “I love it,” he said. “Now I can brew sal ammoniac potions, too, since I’ve got handmade a stone cauldron.”
They headed to Flourish and Blotts without requiring any discussion, but the shop was huge, endlessly filled with books and people, and one step inside the door had them both quickly backtracking. “Maybe we shouldn’t get her a book this year,” Ron suggested.
Proulx’s the first to arrive, of course. Arseholes seem to always show up early to the party. He shoulders Harry out of the way and starts speaking to Draco in rapid-fire French. Unimpressed, Harry activates the buggering translation charm and pretends to be clueless as he continues to cast.
“We’re going to pour it over the stone,” Draco answered for him. “And then I’m going to transfigure it.”
Hermione turned at his exclamation, but she was far enough away now that the boggart didn’t notice her attention. He heard her gasp. “Harry,” she whispered.
Malfoy picks it up, laughing at the tag, and unwraps it without any of his normal fanfare. Harry’s just as intrigued at what’s inside as Malfoy is, though he pretends like he’s not. After five years an Auror and another three in the Academy, he knows how to do subtly now. Malfoy pulls out a pair of wayfarer sunglasses with a note from Harry’s Ministry-issued stationery spellotaped to one of the lenses. Malfoy reads it aloud:
Draco opened his eyes just enough to narrow them. “Only if you promise to stop doing stupid shit, like leaving me and binding your magic to other countries.”
Harry had barely made it to a yellow pouf before he crashed, falling headfirst into the fluffy pillow and refusing to move for anything. The others had not fared much better. Draco made it as far as an armchair, but that was likely due more to an ingrained sense of dignity than any real strength. Harry did not have such a thing to worry about. He lay on stomach over the pouf, staring at the fireplace and trying to chew on his chocolate bar. Draco’s feet were right by his head. His boots were muddy. That never happened.
Harry faltered in his chant, but they finished strong and the magic stabilised and sunk into the earth. The ward was up, and soon, that heart-stopping spectacle would bring something ugly to every shore.
“Ron, leave him alone,” Hermione said, nudging him with her shoulder. “Harry’s perfectly normal. It isn’t fair to compare him to my family’s obnoxiously tall genes. Tell us about the other girls. Do you know who has my bed?”
He took a deep breath, wrapped his fingers around the cork, and pulled. It popped free. The liquid inside sloshed dangerously. Harry held his breath. It didn’t spill over. He released his breath in a rush, and carefully set the cork aside, inside-up.
“Just what I always wanted: to be arrested by the ICW on international Muggle telly and die in Azkaban, sharing a cell with Harry Potter, magic-less,” said Malfoy.
Suddenly, Malfoy looked serious. “You know what we’ll choose, Potter,” he said quietly. “Neither you nor I would ever settle for second best. We don’t bother with commonplace things.”
“I don’t feel like a real Hufflepuff,” said Harry. The weight of their re-sorting was finally settling around him. There was nothing familiar here; nothing to anchor him. If only Neville would come back, maybe that would help. But for now, it was just him and two relative strangers.
March passed thus, and Harry and Malfoy fought for first and second place in their fantasy league all through the month. He and Malfoy spent so much time together that Greengrass and Parkinson came to Harry’s room when they were looking for Malfoy, and all the other eighth years knew to leave a spot next to Harry in the Great Hall. It was like having a best mate again, and it was brilliant. He’d never known just how much like him Malfoy thought, or acted when he was with friends, or complained about Charms homework.
The message was heard loud and clear. They gave all of their focus to appearing as normal as possible. Just one day of classes. That’s all they had to make it through. Harry had Defence and then he was done, as Herbology had been cancelled. There was really just one thing Harry was waiting for, however, and it arrived with the flapping of dozens of wings not long after. Draco’s
Harry inhaled slowly. Justin had seen part of Draco, but he hadn’t seen all of it. Harry was certain that this was not the reason the Hat had given Draco to Hufflepuff. There was more to him than those things. Justin might yet see it one day, but for now, he saw the surface level Hufflepuff parts of Draco, enough only to sponsor him in this. Harry would find the foundation.
“I felt restless, too,” Harry said, and was more sure than ever that he knew the reason Malfoy couldn’t complete his visualisation. “It was part of my animal’s instincts.”
. Let’s all give ourselves a pat on the back for a job well done. Congratulations to this task force for solving the problem of Atlantis!”
The he chattered the whole way home, but Harry could only manage ‘mhmms’ and ‘wows’ every few sentences. His focus was on Draco, who’d sometime between Griphook’s office door slamming behind them and the first clack of steel-toed boots on the marble floors of the lobby, hooked his little finger into Harry’s.
What Harry was most perturbed about was the fact that they charged him five cents for a sodding bag. He could’ve shrunk and pocketed the juice if he was in the Magical world, but not here. All of his Muggle shopping totes were about five metres deep in his rolling luggage, and he couldn’t exactly sort through a 2,200 sq ft suitcase in the Whole Foods queue to find them, so he had to pay the five cents and it was the
“Why?” Ron was eating an apple from a wild apple tree. Hermione had already checked to make sure it was a real apple while Harry and Ron patiently, and quietly, waited for her to do so. They weren’t stupid, after all.
Padma turned back and said, “She accepts our request to speak, though we must join her underwater, as she’s drying out. Bubblehead Charms on, and let’s go.”
“Seriously, how did you not have nightmares all night? I don’t think I’d even be able to fall asleep with that git in the room.”
of money and it’d be great for public relations! People would be so excited if they got to see the inside of the bank, you know, the
Harry and Hermione arrived early to string up the bunting, which was shaped into erupting volcanoes, each with a letter spelling out P-A-D-M-A-&-T-H-E-O.
Classes were cancelled for the morning and all the Hufflepuffs, both old, new, and current, showed up in the Sett, worry clear on their faces. They were exposed, but they still had to solve the problem.
“...It shouldn’t,” Hermione said, though she still didn’t look happy. “We’re basing it off that city-wide
“She’s got a subplot,” Draco, arms crossed, said to Harry as they watched Narcissa laughing at something Mr Redfellow was saying. “I don’t know what she’s up to, but I knew she’d written herself a little plot as soon as our Portkey landed.”
Malfoy opened his mouth, but just then, there was a knock at the portrait door before it was tugged open. Hermione peeked in, her eyebrows soaring as she saw the two of them around the fire.
Silence echoed, and Draco was beginning to despair that this was all for naught, that after all this, they’d still be doomed to a fiery death from above, when Galene, the Queen’s elf, popped in.
They travelled the length of the corridor and paused by a stack of barrels where the pair of prefects hesitated again.
“They’re going to press tomorrow morning,” Lee said. “The Mers, the cruise ship, why we’re in the country, the rubbish ward… everything.”
,” Millicent said, voice strident. “They’ll just take it away and I’ll never get—we’ll never retrieve Professor Dursley. I’ve already
Potter, Granger, and Millicent positioned themselves at the Queen’s and the aliens’ feet and side, casting distance-measuring spells from their wands to make sure they had exactly seven feet on all sides. It took some manoeuvring, the blue lines from the measuring spells connecting their bodies, for the four of them to get a perfect square. When they did, Draco mentally checked it off his list.
He sits down on the visitor chair next to her bed and props his feet up on top of her sheets. “I can’t fix a broken leg,” he says mildly.
“Are you not fighting to return home, darling?” said Narcissa, carefully settling a new wrap of noodles around her fork. “To win, you must defeat your enemy. To defeat your enemy, you must know your enemy.”
He wished he’d brought Snape’s portrait, that it wasn’t still down in Atlantis, probably waiting to be nuked. He had a hysterical moment where he hoped Snape got to his frame in Hogwarts before that happened. But his eyes were glued to the field and the relief of shadows and light barely visible in the fading gloaming light.
summer school trip for their Muggle Immersion students, but it was the first year they’d decided to risk something more exciting than a day at Brighton Pier. Dudley was uncomfortably upbeat as an adult, however, which was the only explanation Harry could give to the fact that he and his soon-to-be-second-year Ravenclaws and Slytherins were on their way to meet him at the Edinburgh Festival Fringe.
“Well, you better be prepared to have a very frank discussion with Ron if you pick Hermione,” said Dennis.
“It’s fine with me,” Malfoy said. “Come back in with the Hufflepuffs when they finish their practice, and I’d better see you both at dinner.”
Harry nodded, looked out to the crowd. Immediately, they started shouting things out—oranges, tomatoes, cricket balls, a laptop computer, even an elephant, which Harry grimaced at. A woman in the front row was furiously scrolling her mobile and then stuck her hand up and shouted, “a rose bouquet!”
Harry thought of the ones from the Yule Ball; maybe the one showing Ron dropping to the floor when Mrs Granger came out to the St Mungo’s waiting room to let them know Rosie had been born; those of Ron drooling as he slept on the Weasleys’ new recliner with his mouth open. “I’m sure I can find something.”
Harry swallowed, kept his eyes closed. He had another minute and a half of this before he had to stir again. “Last time,” he said, “We were terrified.”
“Alright, books away,” he said, after finishing a lecture that had been much more interesting when he planned it out.
They dumped their bags on the table in the sitting room and Harry summoned a stack of books from his bedside table. He heard Severia yelp and when the books floated over to him, she was atop
There was silence as the three of them stared at her, and then she said, “Yes, get me Deshawn.” Another moment of silence, and then: “Deshawn, I’m going to need you to run another background check on the Brits. Especially the Potter one. He might be on the list… Yeah, that one. Oh, really? Well do it anyway, just to be sure. Looking specifically for anything suggesting coup attempts or desire—might get Profiling in, too. Yeah, thanks.”
Harry spread his legs eagerly, allowing Malfoy to fit himself between his spread thighs, press one finger past Harry’s ring of muscle. Harry moaned, angled his hips even more, and Malfoy began to work his finger in and out, deliriously slowly.
“Murdoch would,” said Yaxley. “And perhaps he might. What’s more interesting is the two motions he tried to pass, but failed. The first was to remove a hereditary seat if a family could no longer provide someone from the main line of the family to fill it, and let the seat go to an elected official instead. That nearly passed. The second was to add term limits to Wizengamot members. That one would’ve passed, save for the hereditary seats. They came together on it.”
“Chemicals always leach and get into the water eventually,” Harry added, casually taking another sip. Getting her worked up sometimes helped to speed things along, too.
a war, had not made it as far as Colombia. He turned back around, kicking at a wave rolling in. “I don’t know why I like him, precisely.”
broken it.” He tapped harshly against the headline. “Several times now. And they’re already starting to second-guess their tendency to explain magic away. It’s only a matter of time before we’ve completely blown it, Smith. I’ll be amazed if we make it to Yule.”
from his bag, and did his best to be useful. There was a chapter on how fire intensified magical spells, and an appendix with a cool spell that could put out fires by separating the elements. That one might be fun to try in the reverse if he ever went camping again, which would be never. He read through a few more pages, into the chapter on physics, and became engrossed in a discussion on how banishing and vanishing spells worked within it.
That was their cue. They stepped out onto the stage. Across from them, the Queen entered with Snape and Millicent just behind. They met in the middle like they were coming onto a late-night chat show, waved to the roaring crowd, took their seats, with the Queen in pride of place at the centre.
Harry turned away, scowling. Hermione touched his arm, whispered quickly, “Harry maybe you should see if one of the other men could do the same? You need someone to compare him to before you get too worked up.”
“Nothing,” Lucius said. “But one must always be prepared. I want you to know where they are, in case…in case things ever go awry, which they very well might with the ICW putting its fingers into everything. You, Scorpius, and Astoria must take one—any of them—if you ever need to leave quickly.”
“That you don’t trust yourself around me when you’re drunk,” Draco said. He shifted his stance, somehow bringing their bodies even closer together. Harry willed himself not to die from overexposure. “But I agreed to let things go further, as you asked. So that begs the question—what would you not trust yourself not to do when drunk? I’ve given you leave to do almost anything.”
Dawlish comes in a while later, and it’s only then that Harry realises he’s still reading the sodding
Malfoy looked back but didn’t stop. He was wearing his reading glasses. Why Harry never noticed whenever he wore them before, he couldn’t say, because they were rather fetching.
“Ah, ah, ah,” Snape said. “Not quite yet, I think. This is part of the assignment. You will remain as you are for the entire hour, noting the differences in the body, and when you’ve transformed back, you will have Draco perform a gender transfiguration on you so that you may compare the effects. You knew this, Potter.”
“He did see it,” said Draco. “That’s why Mother’s hands shake now after too much exercise. Nerve damage.”
“Happy birthday,” Harry says, unthinking. His voice catches, as it often does these days, and the words come out dry and brittle, not unlike Harry himself.
He wished he could talk to his family, to Hermione. Get her advice and tell them all he was sorry for doing this without telling them, but not sorry if it saved their arses from certain death. He wished he could talk to the Queen, or Snape, or Dumbledore, or anyone who had more sense than him and Malfoy and Millicent—which, given their actions, could be argued wasn’t much.
He falls asleep tracing a crack that reminds him of the constellation Draco. And then he dreams of Draco, and when he wakes up, his heart hurts. How did he ever go so long and not realise what Draco means to him? He doesn’t know; he hasn’t any idea at all. The sun’s not up yet, but he can’t sleep anymore, so he rolls onto his side and stares blankly out the window at the brick of the building across from his, and he thinks about all the years he’s had to make things right with Draco.
“And why,” Lucius finally grits out, his voice low and menacing, “did your mother and I have to learn from the fuc—
bed last night!” he said on a harsh whisper. “We argued for twenty minutes about it, but when it came down to it, Neville’s had the best view, so I just took his instead so we didn’t have to sleep next to each other, and we’ve got a spare since there’s only four of us now, so we left Dean’s empty for a project.”
When everyone had a plate of food, including Mrs Malfoy who was studying her noodles with some degree of intensity, Malfoy began:
“It’s Dumbledore’s doing,” Harry said. “He’s scheming again. There’s a boggart in that wardrobe, and that mirror shows things one ought already know.”
It was while he was steaming his chicory roots that he caught the movement from the corner of his eye. The painting was of a darkened transmutation lab, so he blended in well. Snape watched Harry’s brewing with a curious focus. Their eyes met once, but Harry quickly looked away, back to his potion, before the examiner could see him. This was one NEWT he definitely didn’t want to get accused of cheating on, and soon the feeling of eyes on him faded away entirely, and he lost himself to the meditative effect brewing brought him.
Harry swallowed, but kept his chin lifted stoically. He would not go down like this. “What do I want?”
Narcissa laughed happily. “Oh, I could tell you liked them. I have her make it for you each week to ensure you always return, my dear. We’re always happy to have you join us.”
“That sucks,” said Goyle, quietly. Harry nearly turned around in his seat to look. He’d never heard Goyle offer a single comment in class before.
“Oh, Mill!” Hermione rushed her, but unlike Harry, Millicent barely swayed from the impact of Hermione’s arms going round her neck. She fairly dragged the other woman from the room, as much as anyone of Hermione’s skinny stature could drag Millicent Bulstrode.
“Where the fuck do you get a name like Seabiscuit when you could have given him a respectable, regal name, like Draco? He does look like a little dragon, doesn’t he?”
Draco whispers things to him. Unintelligible things that may as well be in code for all Harry can concentrate on them. His entire existence is narrowed down to the sound of Draco’s breath in his ear. Draco draws it out, it’s like an eternity. When he finally speeds up again, his fingernails digging into Harry’s shoulders, his cheek pressed tight against Harry’s, they breathe the same air and everything
Ruby and Zeph also found a caterpillar. Ruby guessed that it had to do with Hermione, but the way his explanation was worded made Harry wonder if it was because he thought Harry would be interested in a threesome with Hermione and, perhaps, him. Baffled, Harry set that letter aside.
“That Muggles are absolutely bonkers,” said Addolgar, still leading him away. Somehow they ended up walking back to the Great Hall, where the communal study-and-snack sessions occurred, instead of down to Hagrid’s hut, where he’d thought to take tea during his free period. “I noticed something, though.”
“Of course,” Draco said absently, still staring at the gneiss. Harry came over to look, but had no idea whether it was much changed or not. It was still pinkish-grey on the outside, like many the stones around the Highlands, but a specimen wedge had been cut from it, and in the centre, the stone was shiny grey, like mercury. There were a few spots of clearish-looking quartz or quartzite, but Harry really wasn’t well-versed enough in the subject to know which.
Harry pushes the lab door fully open and steps into the room. The lights brighten with his presence, but all it does is highlight just how dark Nigella is compared to her family. He steps closer, terrified of setting Randy off or his touch somehow sucking the last bit of life from Nigella. When he’s close enough, Harry leans over the pen, his hand hovering inches from her body. So close he can feel the tepid warmth from her body, like all her life is leaking out slowly and there’s not much left to go.
“Drop your wands, you are under arrest for attempted breach of the Statute of Secrecy!” an American voice yelled. Harry would’ve curled his lip at that obnoxious twat from New York, if he hadn’t been busy with other things. He, Malfoy, and Millicent dropped behind their chairs and hid, as Galene popped away with the Queen and Snape’s portrait.
The next wizard flew in. Harry gaped as he dismounted. “Michael Corner,” he said, as if Harry could forget. “Ginny’s other gay ex-boyfriend.”
He’d never noticed the feeling until he left Draco’s flat last night. There is a physical weight in him Draco caused, but it isn’t new. It hasn’t formed since the bond snapped into place. The truth is that Harry has felt this misery—this knowledge of potential futures, all fearsome and lonely—for years. Because he has always loved Draco, and he has always feared losing him, and six weeks together didn’t make that any better. Because Draco is like sunlight in the Forbidden Forest—he can shine light on a terrible path or filter through the trees in warm brushes against Harry’s skin, a gentle reminder of safety and desire.
They played on. Several beers in, Harry was certain that the kids were joining forces against woozy-headed adults. Hermione was laughing and giggling at nothing, and seemed to lean against Millicent far more than she needed to. Millicent did not appear to mind.
If Malfoy’s a Veela, then Harry’s never stood a chance against him. All these horrible, desperate nights he’s spent wishing Malfoy was his were just the product of synthetic lust. He feels cold and ravaged and a little bit terrified.
don’t think he’s fit—that’d be fucking grim—but my mate Piers has this weird thing for him. No idea why. Says he’s fit, though. And you’re like Piers, right? I mean, you’re not into women.”
Sometimes, old Hufflepuffs would show up in the Sett. Harry learned that the giant chessboard on the floor was meant to be played by the entire House, not by two students alone. He was roped into being the knight in a game between Malfoy and Ernie Macmillan’s little brother, Alick, who’d been re-sorted Slytherin, and was also Head Boy. Malfoy’s team won, and Harry had still been standing on the board when it happened. It was the closest he ever came to being useful in chess.
It didn’t have to be acknowledged; it didn’t have to be obvious. It was just how Hufflepuff was, and he understood that now.
“A stasis spell combined with a forced change,” Harry said. “Maybe it needs to be transfigured.” He'd thought transfiguration came at the end, though.
Draco nods, turns, and Apparates. Harry busies himself pouring them both another cup of tea-whiskey while he waits. When Draco returns, Harry’s on his third, but his hands still aren’t steady. Why is he having this reaction to Draco? He’s never reacted this way to him in his entire life and it’s patently ridiculous that now, when he actually cares whether or not he looks like an idiot in front of Draco, this is when he does.
“Being Hufflepuff is great,” said Anthony. “You get to read about what you want without anyone judging you for having loads of books on the forgotten princesses of Eastern Europe.” All three of them turned to stare at Anthony. He daintily licked his finger and turned another page, ignoring them.
When Padma was back to herself, they set about unloading the rest of the oysters. Several Mer pages came up to bring down the oysters. Hermione offered to follow to cast sticking charms for them, but they waved her off.
Malfoy continued looking at him, saying nothing. Harry noticed that his breathing sounding rushed and he wondered if Malfoy was feeling just as raw and exposed as he did. “I knew,” Harry said. “But I didn’t really
Fields laughs. “See if you can make anything of this, Potter. Mitchell, give me the golems, I’m going to show him the spell underpinnings.”
“Flight paths do cross that area of the Atlantic, as I said last time we met,” Hermione growled. “And the Parrot AR Drone, a smartphone-controlled quadcopter for consumers, was released this year. Muggles can now send remote-operated cameras wherever they want to take photographs for them. I’m sure someone with enough money to blow on toys has already purchased and piloted one out there. Has anyone bothered to check with their Muggle Liaisons on this? Not to mention,
“Anyway,” Draco repeats. “They put the code into the location, and then people who want to participate have to figure out the next time and location from clues in that one.”
, and his magic came, rushing up from his toes and surging into his fingers. He threw it at the cauldron, and the fire swerved backwards at the impact. When it steadied again, it was half as tall, but it had noticed them now, and the flames reached out for them, calling their names, screaming and writhing.
Harry froze. Were they going to talk about that arm-over-the-shoulder thing from last night? Should Harry have pushed him off? “Yeah?”
“Right,” said Harry. He pulled out his wallet and extracted a shrunken bag of his entire Gringotts vault and his Barclays accounts. He set it on the counter and slid it over. The teller peeked inside and her well-defined eyebrows rose quickly.
Ron starts in on embarrassing stories of Harry, which is fine—Harry would rather they get them out of the way now, and mostly they’re harmless ones about him refusing to leave the flat without his hat on and that one time he tried to design a womenswear line.
He desperately wanted a cup full of sugar at the moment, but it felt rude—it felt insensitive to Dudley to drink sugary tea when Dudley was always on him about eating healthy. Dudley wasn’t here to give him an exasperated look. He was up in some rotten spaceship, maybe being exper—
“I got loads of insider secrets,” Hermione explained one evening at Harry’s flat, while they ate curry from takeaway boxes and read each other the letters from Hogwarts that their kids had sent them. Both Rosie and Teddy had ended up in Ravenclaw, to no one’s surprise.
Malfoy’s mouth dropping open, the blood draining from his face—Harry can see it even through the flames. Malfoy’s eyes blowing wide and terrified. Then: his mouth firming, lips pressing into a rictus of anger that Harry hasn’t seen since sixth year.
“And so will you,” Harry said quietly. Hermione flushed even more and her eyes cut to the side. Padma was already entertaining Libby with a book on deadly monsters.
“Fantastic,” said Harry, grinning. He was so beyond caring about the story breaking this morning. They were pushing forward and Murdoch and the United States of Arseholes, as Draco so loved to call it, could bugger off. “How about the crawfish?”
He took a deep breath. There would only be two eliminations tonight, but it still wasn’t easy. “The first one goes to Titus.” Because he’d so enjoyed their flirty conversation over gyros. He handed Snitches out to Socorro, Dune, Zeph, Michael, and Ruby. When there was just three people left—Hermione, Finian, and Harry Henry—Harry knew that everything Luna’d said, all her whacko wisdom was about to go right out of the window.
A slow, evil smile spread over Draco’s face as he looked over at Harry. “You know, Teddy,” Draco said. “I think you’re right. Harry, let’s
Hermione slides down the wall behind her, face in her hands, but she doesn’t say no. She doesn’t call it off. Doesn’t say anything at all. Really, they both should’ve been Slytherins from the beginning.
In the back of his mind, Ron leaves the tent. Sirius falls through the Veil. Hedwig dies in a flash of green. His mother screams. Nigella struggles for a breath she doesn’t want to take.
“That makes it easy, then,” said Quincy. “I bet I could spell a sliver of demiguise hair into each of the eggs to turn them invisible. When they reproduced, about half would come out invisible, too. Maybe more, depending on how they bred. Then they’d take care of the rest themselves. I’m sure we don’t have to concern ourselves overmuch with inbreeding since oysters are born and die in the same place. There can’t be too much genetic variation there.”
“Right there,” Draco demands, and then, “Yes, god, yes fuck me just like that you annoying son of a bitch.”

She actually rolls her eyes at him. “I’m very impressed by the region code this Floo call is coming from,” she says. “Did you know you’re calling from Western Asia?”
The conversation died down after that, and then it was just eight anxious people sitting in the same room with a kid and an invisible pet. Ron and Hermione left, and Dudley, Ginny, Luna, and Al trickled out soon afterwards, and then it was just him and Malfoy. At some point, Harry’d refilled their teacups without bothering with tea this time, and they sat staring at the dying fire in the hearth. Malfoy’s transfigured chair was still stable, not even a hint of fading fabric, while Harry’s would’ve returned to a playmat by now.
“I’m afraid I must agree, Your Majesty,” said the German Supreme Mugwump’s assistant. “The ICW requires all member nations to remain in compliance. As of yesterday, Atlantis is out of compliance.”
“Yeah.” That was pretty much the sum of it. Because his boggart was himself. Right now. Like looking in a normal mirror.
Potter and ex-Potter followed suit, though Ginny performed a lovely, deep curtsey that Draco would not have expected a Weasley to be able to execute. They began to file out, some faster than others.
“See you, Harry, see you, Dudley!” Hannah called, as they headed for the door leading out into wide, open London.
Hermione pursed her lips. Firmly, she said, “They will. We just have to show them that they need us. Ooh! Padma at work just got engaged to Theodore Nott. We can offer to do theirs gratis, to build our portfolio. It’ll be a big society wedding, so we’ll get lot’s of exposure.”
There were perhaps twenty people altogether, most of whom were older and that he’d never met. As his eyes travelled around the table, he was surprised and dismayed to see Happy Terry Boot there, with a girl perhaps three or four years their senior. The sandy hair and beatific grin on her face gave her away as another Boot. Terry gave him a grin and an exuberant wave, and Harry forced one in return.
Hermione removed herself immediately from Ron’s bed and replaced herself on Harry’s instead. Harry should’ve seen that one coming. “I don’t know,” she admitted, “but I’ve no inclination to find out. Merlin, I didn’t think it was possible to sleep five women in Ginny’s room, but somehow, it happened.”
She turned a shrewd eye to Harry, who was still trying to aim the coffee spigot correctly over his mug. “Do you think Muggle governments are crafty enough for that? It would certainly be a simpler answer. I don’t know if I like the idea of people from other planets…”
They all retreat, moving on to the next model while Harry takes in Malfoy’s appearance in Harry’s favourite design of the collection. All that’s left now is for Harry to finalise the fit. He makes a few adjustments on the snugness of the waistcoat and decides he likes the buttons better in silver before he moves down to the trousers. They’re a bit loose at the hips, but Harry finds that he likes the effect, so he leaves them as is.
Dudley shrugged. “She said something super strange when I rang the other day. Said she finally remembered.”
“It suits him,” says Harry, who’s already shuffling his models around in his head so that he has as many as possible of his warm tone models in some form of glonde. “What about on deeper skin tones?” asks Harry of Dean.
“No, I swear it,” said Harry. He felt his face heat from more than the August heat. “I just kinda wanted to see you.”
They walked out to the pitch without speaking. It wasn’t entirely uncomfortable, either. Who would’ve guessed they could walk so far without sniping at one another without the excuse of light alcohol and Hufflepuff friendliness?
“Maybe,” Granger said. “But I can’t imagine, don’t want to imagine, really, that you would do something this monumental without it being the only option. And if that’s the case, we could’ve started helping sooner. We could’ve found you a loophole, Ron could’ve worked the DMLE, any number of things. Now we’re scrambling. So,
The post office owner rented him an owl for free when he recognised Harry. He put on his public smile and thanked him effusively, but all he could think about was his bloody boggart and that if becoming a Potions Master didn’t change things up for him, he might very well go live as a muggle monk in Tibet just to get away.
He doesn’t even have time to rethink the wording before Malfoy’s tensing up and whining low in his throat. The first burst of come lands on Harry’s cheek and he belatedly remembers to close his eyes. Malfoy’s gasping and covering Harry’s lips and chin with hot strings of come, and it is without doubt the hottest fucking thing he’s ever experienced in his entire life. He melts into it, feeling warm and aroused and like he needs to be fucked
Draco’s lips pursed. “Under guise of interviewing him for something heir-related, she tested his mind to see where the Obliviation was blocking his ability to learn multiplications by seven. He did brilliantly with every other number that she tested him on; she said his mind lit up like fairy lights when he was doing maths.”
Snape scowled. “Alchemy will be the death of us all,” said Snape, as if he weren’t already dead. He fixed his eyes on Harry. The paint glittered with his anger and his curiosity. “We can’t discuss this here. Meet me by my rooms.”
“Harry, honestly,” Draco said. “You sound moronic. Don’t you know any other words?” Harry turned his attention back to the bed. Draco had managed to pull himself up in a reclined position, and appeared to be watching this exchange with some amusement.
Dudley sat down next to Malfoy without hesitation. As Harry would’ve once guessed, the months since Malfoy’s arrival showed he and Dudley got on. Very well. It didn’t even matter that Dudley was a Muggle, because Dudley had apparently told many stories about Harry at the little welcome party the Slytherins had thrown for Malfoy (which Harry had not been invited to), and that was enough for Malfoy.
“Harry,” Ron’s voice comes through and Harry looks up to see his eyes are seer-blue and he’s built a wall of flame between them and the rest of the Department. Beyond it, Draco stares wide-eyed. Hermione yells, unheard. Apex watches. Ron swallows, takes a step forward but only one. “It will work out.”
The way Draco’s mouth pursed when he was thinking was something Harry would never get out of his head. He took another drink, and Harry’s eyes followed the path of his tongue as it licked the foam from his lips.
his fainted students and hauled them up. He spared a moment for Dudley, somewhere in the crowd before them, but the students had to come first. Something was not right, and they had to
The wizard behind the Arrivals desk smirked and continued typing on his computer, pretending he wasn’t listening. A sign behind him had an enlarged photograph of a witch in thigh-length American flag robes, with a caption that read: Terminal M, Gate One-Seventh, Washington, DC International Airport.
Harry slumped on his stool, frowning down at the table. The wood was worn smooth and shiny from so many years of use, which could have been an allegory for how Harry felt this week. He’d loved his job back in London. He’d loved the work, and the people he worked with—all Muggles. He’d loved getting to scuba dive and travel all over Britain to collect samples. He’d loved swimming with kelpies in the Scottish Lochs and Mers along the Irish coast and all of the mundane fish, too. And he’d had to leave it all behind to come save the United States.
“Has the ICW made contact with the inhabitants of Atlantis, yet?” Granger spoke up, her voice carrying above everyone else’s. Draco suspected a spell.
“What’s wrong with a subplot? Everyone gets bored if it’s just some dumb hero trying to save the world.”
Draco humphed in an unnecessarily disdainful way, if Harry were consulted on it. “Yes, just the ticket after the troubles earlier this week.”
which was nice news, although Harry doubted Snape would let him out of his sight for long enough to attend. And frankly, he’d had enough of camping for a while. Draco would probably be interested though, Harry suspected, upon reading on. The English National Team had made it to the playoffs last year, before the war interrupted everything, and Draco’s favourite Chaser, Hermes Kilgore, was on that team.
Draco stepped out of the Floo into Dudley’s house in Hogsmeade. The place was the same neat and tidy set-up he’d seen when they came over to watch the football, nothing at all out of place to suggest anything untoward had happened.
“I have one—very invasive—idea,” Malfoy said quietly. It was meant for just the two of them, but no doubt at least some of the video cameras’ microphones picked it up.
Neville nodded. “Yes, we were measuring atmospheric magic in the area from a year ago against current levels. The International Magical Data Society does an annual worldwide survey.”
, which were already weakened from all the magic they’d used earlier. Still, Draco could make out the colour of Potter’s eyes, the serious set to his mouth.
But there was one thing he knew now, one thing he’d not known when he and Hermione came upon this same room in eighth year. He'd once dearly wanted to just be
“Fuck off, Malfoy,” Potter said, but he was too busy staring at a fine, white Saluki with hair like that American witch Stevie Nicks, who was graciously accepting a basket of sweetbreads from the butcher, and there wasn’t much feeling behind it.
He kept hoping to see Dumbledore, but both the frames behind her desk were empty, and there was no white beard or purple robes hidden in any of the other Headmaster portraits. He’d checked—like some magical
Harry had not thought it would ever be so easy to relax with Draco Malfoy’s arm around him. Now that he knew it was, he didn't want it to ever stop.
So Harry unshrunk his laptop and set it up on his Aunt Petunia’s WiFi, where she then, for the first time in his life, taught him how to do something that wasn’t cooking or cleaning. She pulled her chair around to his and guided him through creating an account, writing the copy with the date, time, and instructions for how to participate, and creating the petition.
He got a finger in and had himself stretched enough to go for the pulsator when there was a knock at his door. Harry choked and pulled the blankets over himself, expecting Luna and at least one cameraman to burst in. The door stayed closed, and Harry slowly relaxed. After about thirty seconds, the knock came again. Harry scowled. Of course, the one time he was going to enjoy himself and someone had to come by and interrupt it.
didn’t think he was up to dealing with just now. He’d made too big an arse of himself half a year ago on that one.
“I feel it,” Neville said. His eyes spanned the table’s offerings, and he grimaced. “Can’t a man have a bloody sausage?”
He looked so regal sitting straight against the royal blue upholstery, his white-blond hair contrasted against the cotton. For the first time, Harry wondered what it would have been like to spend evenings in a common room with him at Hogwarts, what he and Astoria had talked about during spare few months of their marriage, when they’d been young enough to not be exhausted all the time.
“No, there’s a New York branch,” Harry said. “Not a Mid-Atlantic branch, or a Seattle branch, or fuck it, even a Dallas, Texas branch.”
“I’m not leaving.” To demonstrate, he flicked his wand in an annoyed arc and a set of sharp, shimmering wards snapped into place. “Proceed.”
Weasley ignored her. “Needs must, Hermione. We need to get to the island and see if we can find the Queen. Find out if she’s still alive. You said you need to do the spell on Atlantis, right? Because of all the leyline crossings there?”
Harry has been married ninety-six years and estranged for eighty-nine and it’s been seventeen seconds since he touched his husband.
Draco stared at him for a moment, his fingers pausing as they did up the last couple of buttons on his shirt. He blinked. “Sure, yeah.”
Harry swallowed, felt his face flame like the finicky burner in Slughorn’s class. “You owe me a tip first.”
He’s so annoyed by this that when she falls through a mineshaft sort of thing in a renegade goblin hide-out they’re scouting, he takes her to St Mungo’s instead of calling for a healing Auror to help them. Anytime they end up in St Mungo’s, there’s paperwork, and Harry gets some small degree of satisfaction from the scowl she sends him as he levitates a pile of Accident and Injury Report (AIR) forms onto her lap as she reclines in her hospital bed.
Harry thinks, panicking. He can’t bring his daughters into a place full of lead paint, and they’re probably going to have to move there eventually because Draco’s flat’s just a studio. There’s no way four of them can live there together. Grimmauld’s got six bedrooms and a garden. It’s definitely the better idea but if there’s
“Anyway,” Dudley continued. “What do you think’s got you so freaked? Surely not the Obliviation. It sucks, but it’s over. Now we can all forget about it…though, Mum’s still acting a bit odd. Maybe you’re right about it hitting her, too.”
“Well, anyway. We stopped at the Gulf Water Nation rendezvous point first, which is just outside New Orleans, and met with Chieftess Fontanne and her daughter, Genevieve, who’s in her official apprenticeship years for training to be Chieftess. Genevieve was still young, and I thought she looked rather like Padma, really. You could see her blueing a bit around the gills, but they’ve still got a lot of pollution from that oil spill a few years back, and you can tell she’s going to go more of a jet colour than green, like her mother.”
Harry’s expression didn’t change. He wasn’t surprised. Regardless of how their marriage had turned out, Ron and Hermione had always been, first and foremost, friends. They’d do whatever they could, bury their difficult emotions, to keep that possibility open for the future. And for Rosie.
Dennis’s eyebrows lifted and now Harry could see that even Dennis’s usual beatific smile was forced. Wordlessly, Dennis opened his DADA portfolio and pulled out an evening edition of the
“But Snape likes you,” Harry said. “And I’m pretty sure he sort of likes me now, too, since he’s been calling me ‘moron’ instead of ‘Potter’ a lot lately. You think he’d let us in?”
“Don’t hold your breath, Malfoy,” Neville said. “You like to pretend you’re so very cool and superior, but don’t forget
The arrival of more bodies forced Draco into sliding closer to Harry, which was all part of his master plan. The other part of his master plan was that playing with other people would loosen Draco up, and then Harry could regurgitate his heart out to him and have a better chance of it going well.
Draco re-cast Penelope Clearwater’s translation spell on them both, even though he knew the resulting migraine would be agonising.
Down on Thatch Cottage Lane, just past The Elegant Hag where Luna and Ginny sometimes stopped for dinner and a pint when Harry took Albus, his son would’ve been curling up to bed with a plush Erumpent and a politely worded demand for one of Auntie Hermione’s mystery books. Knowing the three of them were safe in Hogwarts tonight—and the foreseeable future—was the only reason Harry’s burlap sack of tangled emotions was not spilling out into the gravel and onto Malfoy’s dragon hide boots.
“What do we do?” asked Harry. “How are we going clean all those landfills if we can’t use magic on them?”
He reached the door, pushed it open. Millicent Bulstrode was there, panting heavily, looking like she’d run to Harry’s door all the way from Hogsmeade. But why would she be there, when she had rooms in the castle?
to host New Year’s,” Draco said. “I’m just saying that Mother told me I had to tell you that you were.”
“It’s a newer concept. But it’s a way to get many people to agree to support a single idea that they find valuable. Usually, it’s with money, but you just need pledges, right?”
But then Malfoy moved his hips and Harry’s head fell back. He panted, the delicious feeling of Malfoy’s erection against his own sending his blood pounding.
Hermione sighed. “You’ll need to know the theory behind Potion-making if you’re to have any hope at all, and Snape only assigned that sort of reading in first and second year.”
it. It hissed at her. Draco felt his blood run cold, but stood his ground. Fuck, Millicent should’ve been a Gryffindor.
They could do that. It would focus their minds from the anxiousness, make them feel productive. It was the only thing they
“That’s where it’s getting pulled out,” Draco told him. “You need to focus on blockading that spot so your magic can’t get by.”
But it wasn’t normal because Potter followed Draco and Scorpius to the door and—very obviously—kissed Draco on the mouth before he left.
Harry shrugged, peeked at his cauldron quickly before Draco could see him looking. Still not roiling. “Why not Tom or Daniel or…?”
He heard footsteps above and pulled them to a stop, pressed against the stone walls and breathing as silently as possible. He’d used this sneaking spell—unfortunately, largely employed by burglars—all through fifth and sixth year to sneak down to the pub with Pansy and Blaise. In seventh year, they hadn’t had the guts to try it, though they’d needed an escape more than ever.
Draco sighed again, endlessly longsuffering, and took hold of the Nokia mobile phone. It had a Chinese dragon case, which normally would’ve caught at least a bit of Draco’s attention, but not today. Today he was mourning his life without his cousin, whom everyone seemed to like except Draco, who probably did like Kyle at least a bit, but kept up the complaining because it was just one of his better talents.
And he had to give a little speech first. To soften the blow. He imagined Ron sitting at home in front of the magicbox, wearing only his pants and Rosie’s spit up in his hair, Rosie passed out against his chest, a beer in his free hand. Fuck, Harry would love that. He’d love to have a family of his own.
“We’ve never even formally introduced,” she said on a laugh. “Despite being in the same year and running into one another in the bathrooms. Please don’t call me Sally-Anne. I go by Sally. I did have a few Hufflepuff friends who call me Perky, but they’re in other houses now.”
He’d transformed for the first time, and the person he loved had been in his head the whole time and witnessed the entire incredible experience with him—
“If,” said Severus, “Atlantis was destroyed by a great flood, then where, pray tell, did all the water come from?”
“I still go by Draco,” he said automatically. They shook and she grinned. She was rather bland looking at any given moment, thus probably contributing to how easily she was overlooked, but when she smiled, her personality was actually evident.
Malfoy’s surprise was caught on camera, as was everything else embarrassing that night, but Harry felt rather pleased (and drunk) as he passed the final Snitch to Malfoy, and Malfoy’s cool fingers brushed over his to take it. Harry shivered, probably drunk, and Dennis got it on film.
“Then my life would be incrementally worse than it was this morning, and again worse than it was this afternoon, when the world quite literally exploded.” Draco glared over his shoulder. “Is Potter even gay? Or bi?”
She was staring at Luna across him and he could practically feel the unspoken communication between them. It was something they’d never managed together. Luna stood and went to the hearth, lighting the fire and calling down for some tea.
This, understandably, caused a stir amongst those assembled. Dudley smiled blandly, directing his gaze to no one in particular, and generally looked as if he could punch any one of them and knock them out cold without even standing from the table. The murmuring died down after an extended, wasted minute. Draco studied his nails.
It cuts off, and the fire dims to a resentful-looking smoulder. Harry stares at the fireplace, trying to finish that sentence.
“Mother,” said Malfoy, and took her in his arms for a fierce hug. He pulled back, studied her face, and said nothing before turning to Lucius. “Father. You look well.”
Inside, his room felt decidedly empty. Even Ms Danger was out, hopefully returning library books. The last thing he needed after the past two days was Irma Pince coming up to him at breakfast and reminding him—not in her library voice—that his mix-breed Demiguise had overdue books again. Staff did not get discounts on library fines.
“Works for me,” said Harry. Draco popped the cork and tipped it back. He passed it to Harry. “Cheers.”
“Yep,” says Harry, pleasant. He comes further in, not sure which side of the barrier he should choose, and in the end, goes for Hermione’s. It feels safer. Less hostile. He lays the book open on her desk, the pages already opened to the one he has in mind. Draco stands from his desk and approaches the shield, but doesn’t bother coming around.
Malfoy nodded, “Yes, but the plan is to use the time to bring our magical and non-magical communities together…to advance both our race and our technology enough that we can be more evenly matched when the time comes.”
He found himself grinning, like a complete sap. Or a complete idiot. He wasn’t sure and he didn’t care.
Just knowing the problem and having a small-scale solution in mind was a major breakthrough for them. The Ministry had yet to come up with
The clearing began to fill with celebrants, already laughing and giggling from pre-gamed liquor. Many brought baskets of food and drinks to share. As the final celebration before the wedding itself, potlucks were common.
He wasn’t afraid of his emotions. He was afraid of Draco’s. That’s how those-people were: they hid everything, even from themselves sometimes.
“My theory is that the—love—could be… redistributed. Towards people you actually want to be in love with.”
Harry jumped up and dashed over to the cabinets to find some plates and bowls. Lee came over to help, giving him a wry look as he pulled open drawers looking for the silverware. They had the table set and the food out in short order. To Harry’s infinite surprise, Malfoy had uncorked a bottle of red and poured a glass for his mother in the interim, before offering Hermione a glass with a quirked eyebrow. It was much too difficult for him to actually
That is how he and Malfoy are found sitting across from Ron and Hermione at Le Persil Étuvé. Hermione is wearing plum eye shadow and looking phenomenal, which isn’t fair. Harry smiles placidly at his friends, who are, after startled greetings and three minutes spent staring fixedly at their menus, now staring at him and Malfoy instead.
“I missed you for half a year,” Draco said, annoyance lacing his voice. “You rude shit. How dare you just stop showing up? I’d started charging you for those pH strips at cost!”
Harry huffed and let his eyes roam back over to his house’s table. There was Draco, sitting with Neville, Luna, Sally, and Mandy crowded around him. Imani and Fayth weren’t far away. Maybe it was just Harry, but he felt unravelled after last night, and as he saw the thoughtful looks on the faces of his fellow new Hufflepuffs, he thought they did, too.
Astoria was received next, while Lucius held his hand out for Draco, looking very confident and composed for a man who’d dragged their entire family through hell—physically, mentally, spiritually, financially, and reputationally—and was currently serving the most useless and public-facing community service magical Britain had ever seen.
Draco sat at the side of the bed, staring into the darkness. “I hate that we’re condemning Millicent.”
She nodded, eyes wide, as she took the flowers from Draco. He did a series of four more transfigurations—some of them even more complex for lack of apparent similarity. Each apple became a cast iron frying pan, a working pocket-watch, a plush dog, and a snail.
Harry stripped his t-shirt off and tossed it in the corner, only belatedly remembering that Kreacher was dead and certainly not in the United States. He was going to have to find a wash-and-fold somewhere unless the house had a machine because his cleaning charms were rubbish. The stink of rotting algae stung his nose. He needed a shower bad, and maybe a good wank, which would be hard to get in the single bath this place had.
He wishes that he could care more, but honestly, he really doesn’t have anything else to say. Not until Draco wakes up. He
in bright orange script. Draco eyes it distastefully, but when Harry adds, “I’ll lube up and ride you for an hour if you wear it,” he slips it right on. Draco’s belly’s getting big quickly, but it’s not too big to fuck Harry yet. In public, it’s softened by the glamour he puts on when he’s going into work or the shops. It can’t cover all of it, but it makes it look like he’s just getting pudgy instead of carrying two additional humans.
They settled on the placement of the crest (Harry chose to have it embroidered inside because he felt outside was too ostentatious), the exact shade of green, and the lining. He didn’t go with kelpie lining – after hearing about Mrs Norris, he just couldn’t. But the jackalope was weather resistant as well, and a solid choice.
“Oh for god’s sake,” Hermione muttered, pushing around Harry to exit the alcove. “It’s not mysterious.”
Annoyed, Draco shook that off. He had a rare evening alone, and tomorrow was going to be a clusterfuck, and there was no sense in being maudlin over something so ridiculous as where Scorpius spent the night.
“Your magic,” Ron says, quiet. “You weren’t… you weren’t in the right place, emotionally. You need—”
Harry ignored her. Draco was already at the bar, securing a bottle of Rosmerta’s house-brewed firewhisky and apparently placing a considerable sum of money down on the Wasps to win. Harry scowled again, remembering his not-ideal-against-Malfoy’s-tricky-team line-up. He pushed out into the street to wait on the other man, and the chilly April wind caught against his pub-warmed cheeks as he stepped out. It was a shock to his system, one that almost made him gasp. It was a lot like being around Draco in that way.
Next to Draco, Potter rubbed his face with both hands as if he could wipe off all his sensory organs and not have to live through this shitshow any longer if he did it hard enough.
,” Harry said. He frowned. He’d spent way too much time around Hermione without Ron to temper it, recently.
“I knew I kept you around for a reason,” Harry said, guiding them towards a group of white-aproned wizards levitating silver covered dishes. They found Hermione directing their leader with a stern gaze and a firm hand.
“I know, I know,” said Harry. “I keep trying new brands, trying to find a good one, but they’re all terrible.”
But he couldn’t say any of this, despite how significant it was, because the walls were paper thin and Michael Corner was just on the other side. He bit down hard on his wrist, breathing quickly through his nose as he watched Malfoy suck and finger-fuck him, his hips thrusting up of their own volition, and then it was just too much, the delicious feeling too much, and Harry’s back arched all the way off the bed as he emptied himself in Malfoy’s hot, waiting mouth.
“Thank fucking Merlin, you’re here,” Draco whispered. Neville would’ve been pleased with his progress of not swearing so loudly in public.
Harry just didn’t know what that something was, yet. He didn’t know if he even believed his own memory.
For a moment, Harry stumbled over his thoughts. Had she caught him eavesdropping? Was he even eavesdropping? He felt his face heat up. “Er, pardon?”
Harry scowled at him and unrolled the vault statement. There was a very small balance, a single credit of one million galleons, and three debits: a 2,000 galleon contract fee for two house-elves who agreed to bind themselves to the Manor for its upkeep, and a single purchase of 512 galleons at the Diagon Alley location of Wittle Wizards, the toys and baby supplies shop that Ron and Hermione were always in these days. Rosie had the full collection of
“You got the onion naan, right?” asked Lee, who was already sticking his head in all the bags, looking for tin foil-wrapped bread. Padma slapped his hand.
“Are you going for extra points, Mr Potter?” the examination witch asked at the end, without looking up from her note-taking.
“How are you?” Harry manages, while Ron continues studying Nigella’s breathing, palpating her stomach and so on. “Did it help?”
Maybe if Demelza had been his partner the whole time, if he’d never had Draco, he’d be perfectly happy blowing things up with her.
“Nope. Nothing.” On this, Harry was annoyed. He desperately wanted to avoid another debacle like last year’s Christmas, and it was bloody hard to do that when he didn’t know what Hermione’s mood was going to be. She was
“It feels…weird,” Harry finally said. He shrugged, and hated it because he really had no idea how to describe becoming part animal.
Professor Orkney was dismayed by Harry’s disarray, which frankly stretched beyond his satchel and well into his life as a whole. Especially since yesterday. He gave Harry a deeply unimpressed gaze before turning to the class and welcoming them to another fantastic Defence lesson.
! Probably,” Harry says, scrabbling for his wand so he can coat his fingers with charmed lube. It’s turning out to be a very good morning indeed.
“He said…” Narcissa swallowed, gathered herself. “He said they’re here to kill our children and ensure we don’t continue to pollute the earth with magic. He said there’s enough of them to wipe us all out.”
Draco gave Mrs Granger a nod and a smile and followed Potter in. The rest of them were already seated on the couches and chairs in the living room. Mr Granger was speaking to Mrs Dursley and Dudley, and Draco felt an odd surge of something at seeing Dudley alive and, at least physically, well. He looked…slower than normal, his usual obnoxious cheerfulness dulled, but his whole demeanour changed when they walked in.
you, Harry?” Her eyes water and then she launches herself at him. “Oh god, I’m so glad you’re alive. I was so worried. I’m always so worried, but oh my god, Harry, I’m just…” She breaks down into sobs then, none of them actual words. Harry hugs her back, rubbing his hand up and down her spine. He and Ron avoid eye contact during this time, focusing instead on Draco, still unconscious in the hospital bed.
“I should set him free,” Harry said. “I never should’ve kept him to begin with. He just needed to be put with another herd.”
It was a good night for all of them, and one thing was certain: America was way less shitty than he’d thought it would be. At least, with Malfoy here.
By the time Draco realised he was currently wanking, he’d already given up on the pretence of his having any control over where his mind drifted. But he refused to think of Potter.
Harry glanced up and saw that Draco’s hair was sticking to his face, just as it had in his lab at Hogwarts when Harry used to visit him. He swallowed, feeling a sudden rush of longing. What were they doing? Could it last? What if Harry was just setting himself up for more heartache?
Harry snorted into his coffee, began coughing and possibly asphyxiating, but no one paid him any mind.
Harry and Hermione shared a look. Of all the people to show up to Andromeda’s, Millicent Bulstrode had not been a consideration. Until now, apparently.
There was an awkward silence. Predictably, one of the Ministry idiots broke it. “Doubtful. They died or disappeared about a thousand years ago.”
“Good. I do fine with the meditation, but when I try to visualise, I don’t get anything. I know I’m doing it right.”
after each one. People all over the UK were following the story of Padma and Theo’s nuptials, and for Harry and Hermione, business was soaring. They had dozens of letters every day begging them to take on someone else’s wedding, and they hadn’t even got to the marriage ceremony itself yet.
Draco’s Portkey brought him to Hogsmeade, where Harry, Yaxley, and Ron had arrived just moments before. Draco landed straight, on both feet, closed his eyes and seemed to sway for just a moment. Then he swallowed, took several deep breaths, and stepped out of the town Portkey and Apparition spot.
“Harry,” Granger said again. She looked agonised. “Harry this spell requires a big sacrifice. Didn’t the Queen tell you?”
Ron let out a rush of breath. “You’re awake, thank Merlin.” He turned around, said over his shoulder, “Hey, Harry’s awake.”
Draco obligingly lifts his hips for Harry to tug his trousers and pants down, his long fingers tangling in the messy curls on Harry’s head. Harry doesn’t stop to think before he lowers his mouth to Draco’s cock. It’s just like he remembers… better. There is something strange about the eroticism of taking another person’s flesh in your mouth, the weight of it, the heat of it, the odd way it fills something not evolutionarily designed for it. Harry closes his eyes, relaxes his throat as he sinks down. Is he perverse to enjoy this so much? To feel complete only when he has to consciously
from here forward, I suspect there will be a sharp divide in people who hate this fic and people who love it.
Despite her apparent pain, Bulstrode pushed her chair back and gathered Hermione off of Harry and into her arms, where she immediately turned her face into Millicent’s shoulder and attempted to both laugh and cry at once. Harry, concerned for her sanity, tipped his head towards the antechamber the staff used to enter the Hall, and Millicent followed him through, half-dragging, half-carrying Hermione along.
They dried off with discreet charms before hopping back in the Rover. Padma drove again, and Hermione navigated again, but the ride back to DC was heavy with quiet. Harry, for one, couldn’t stop thinking of that thing Draco’d said, that… that first comment, when Harry had pulled him in.
Harry pops it open and pours them both a glass. He divvies up the noodles and tosses all the lime wedges onto Draco’s plate without comment. If he doesn’t let himself look beyond his blinders, it almost feels like it used to. It almost feels
“Well, Neville thought there was a rate of four percent decline in magic between last year and this year. It’s actually closer to four-and-a-half percent. I know that seems tiny, but it’s actually a material difference. At this rate of decline – which, fortunately, doesn’t seem to be linear or exponential but instead based on the Arithmantic law of Reverse Triplices Wobble – it means that we will decline another 2.25 percent this year, and 1.125 next year, before reversing again and declining further at a rate of 1.496 and then–”
Malfoy frowned, but did get up. Harry turned away while he dressed. He heard the hotel door close as he slipped out, feeling emptier than he had before he started this stupid game.
In his own head, Harry struggled with the same moral dilemma. He thought it was the right thing to do, but it still seemed a hard way of doing it. But it was done. The ward was up, and rubbish would start coming in with the tides within the week. Within three months, all the rubbish floating equidistant or closer from US land would have arrived.
Draco was already ahead of him, swimming off towards the seafloor just below where there was a collection of coral and anemones and, hopefully, some immortal jellyfish polyps to collect.
“You’ve come,” she said, her voice hoarse. The translation spell grated against Draco’s ears, but his Greek was too rough to go without it. “We were afraid you would not.”
Potter had lunch brought up to them and they worked all through the morning and into the afternoon. He called the ICW around lunch and tried to relay the urgency of their discovery of the UFOs’ mission and how all magical people were all in danger, but Herbert Kurzschluss’s assistant only said he’d pass the message on. Their Floo call was never returned.
When the sun finally started setting, Harry knew the students would soon arrive. The train was set to the astronomical clock and always managed to get them to Hogsmeade Station at the stroke of nautical twilight.
Neville was thoughtful. “I think we should try it at least once, just to see. If it turns out to help the magic levels in the area, I say it’s worth the sacrifice.”
-in-the-dark) poster of the Cannons’ new season team line up. Harry managed a smile for him. He’d willingly contributed to his own inability to sleep. Friendship was so difficult sometimes.
a magic in the knowledge of loss. And it’s ripe to be harvested if you’re willing to make the sacrifice.
“Mr Koetsu asks his camerawoman to make sure she gets a good shot of this,” said the translator. “Mr Koetsu wants it filmed from all angles.”
Harry doesn’t drink tea all that much. He drinks it at Malfoy’s place because Malfoy drinks it and now, tasting it for the first time in months, he doesn’t know what to make of it. It’s familiar and exotic all at once, and it’s still just tea.
His grey eyes flicked from Harry, to the cat, and back to Harry again. He cleared his throat, as if nervous. “Jollies?” he asked.
But there was something new between them now. There was a single word, yelled out by a sentient hat that said something about them was
“She’s in her Addams phase,” Kyle assured them. “It sometimes lasts lifetimes, but one never knows.” He shrugged, grinning through his beard. “Anyway! Hermione and Padma arrived this morning, and I think your Mom’s heading down to DC to visit that Redfellow dude for a bit first? She said she’d be here on Christmas Eve. I suppose the others will get here when they get here.”
Harry stiffened. His eyes widened. Come was dribbling down his throat and he started to choke on it and then on Draco’s cock. He slipped off it and stood, wiping his mouth on the back of his hand and feeling as though he’d never been as turned off as he was the moment he heard his godson’s voice while he had his partner’s prick in his mouth.
Winter Solstice arrived, and with it, the morning of Padma and Theo’s wedding. Harry woke up with a tremble that had nothing at all to do with the shitty warming charms in Grimmauld Place. Draco was still sleeping, which was unusual in itself. He was normally the first to wake.
Harry rolled his eyes and turned back to his son. “Ready for breakfast? The elves will have pumpkin pasties out to dunk in your tea.”
“You want to me to force myself to fall in love with Malfoy to break the bond,” Harry surmises, voice quiet.
“No,” Malfoy said sourly. “Potter picked an almost identical team to the one you would’ve taken. With all the player competition, you would have diluted teams, and I’d easily be in the lead.”
“They want to live on our planet and breed with humans, but they think magic’s dangerous, and they intend to wipe it out first,” Potter offered. “Killing magical people is the first step to them moving in, so to speak.”
He leaned in and kissed Draco, and Draco let him. He made a needy sound in the back of his throat, and Harry rolled over on top of him, exploring his mouth again. He pulled away after a moment, long enough to say, “You’re forgetting, Draco. We don’t want to destroy the bad parts. We have to encourage them.
The Fudge case is solved and Ron has the time to fully submerged himself in a new episode, focused, uncomfortably, on winning his wife back through sheer force of will.
So they lugged out all thirty crates to the front garden, and started stacking them in as Padma and Blaise got out of the car. Blaise was in a Juventus jersey today, though it was still a well-tailored Juventus jersey.
“Please,” Harry begged, thrusting his hips up to try to reach Malfoy’s prick. Malfoy grabbed his hips and flipped him over. He tugged Harry’s arse up in the air and pushed his shoulders down. He pushed back in and then leaned over Harry’s back to grab hold of his hands, preventing him from touching himself.
Their breakfasts at the Hufflepuff table had begun to include gluten-free chocolate scones, chocolate protein shakes, and chocolate granola bars. The quiches had grown on Harry and he began to look forward to Thursdays, when the mushroom-ricotta ones appeared.
It wasn’t that Harry wanted to spend two years on this project—he didn’t, and he didn’t want the Mers to have to wait that long, either—but he almost—as Kyle would put it—kinda, sorta wished Draco wanted to stay.
Ooh, that was clever. Harry wished he’d done the same now. It might’ve prevented a large portion of Hermione’s disbelief when he’d first explained the situation to her. But then again, he hadn’t wanted her to know about
“That is highly dangerous,” Snape said. “The third one will still be highly reactive. It is, in fact,
Draco’s legs were wobbly, like after an afternoon of Quidditch practice, and he grimaced, remembering just how long it’d been since he’d engaged in that degree of physical activity.
on his lips. Nothing like a good mystery. Hermione’s wand twitched, and the wardrobe door swung open. Something slumped onto the floor, and Hermione screamed, then slammed a hand over her mouth to dull it. The Grangers were on the floor, bloody and half-decayed. He gagged at the smell, covered his mouth, and pulled Hermione away.
Draco watched him for a long moment, saying nothing. Finally, he closed the difference between them. For a moment, Harry thought Draco would kiss him, but instead he held his hand out. “Share my Portkey?”
. Draco shifted and then he was stretching his arm across the brief expanse of floor separating the beds. “Then choose me, Potter,” he said.
Harry wrinkled his brow. “Well, er, that’s great to hear. Since you’re on a gay dating show, I mean.”
“I suppose,” said Ron, thoughtfully. “But if they know about us, they’ll know we’re hiding. And they might start looking more closely when we make mistakes out in Muggle places.”
, and even he was frightened of it. Perhaps fire became even more terrifying when one was highly flammable paint and canvas, though he’d not seemed at all bothered by
Half an hour later, the second round of distillation was, too, completed. This time, the solution was even more concentrated than before. Again, he separated out the sludgy impurities, and emptied the purified, condensed vapours back into the cauldron. He could see through the liquid now; the stone sat at the bottom, blood-red and vibrant, even in the murky solution.
“No,” she said. “We developed in isolation, though we are still related. People with magic in your world came about it the same way we did, but you were less noticeable to the Creators, developing as slowly as you did, and spared the alterations and scrutiny.”
“We were going to tell you,” Harry says. Draco shoots him a sharp glare. “Honestly,” Harry says. “We had a bet and everything. I lost, by the way, so I was supposed to say something every time we came over for dinner but I…” he trails off, shrugging.
“Obviously,” Snape said. Harry heard his robes shifting. “Draco—you will make sure that Potter wears all of the safety gear?”
with him? He opened his mouth, but couldn’t think of anything to say. Draco wrenched free, and took several seconds with the pretence of straightening the buttons on his robe sleeve.
Draco’s expression softened. For a moment, Harry wondered if, and was horrified by, the possibility that, Draco was using
Dudley laughed. “Nah, he’s a good chap these days. Obnoxious about travelling, but a good friend. Plus, he’s bloody freaked about these UFOs. He’ll help us. I’ll call him.”
Still, he stops and bends to pet the Manticore as he nears the man selling questionable food items on kebab sticks. The Manticore stops and purrs, curling it’s tail around Harry’s arm and panting happily. He’s a Mediterranean Manticore (Harry knows his breeds), and the fatal stinger barb was bred out of them hundreds of generations ago, but their bite is still venomous. At this young age, he’d not give Harry more than a migraine, but he seems well behaved enough to not bite anyway.
A great force crashed back into their cave, shattering Weasley’s protective shield, deafening Draco. But that was okay because he was already just a spirit, not a person, not tangible any longer.
There was a further silence, and then, so quiet Harry almost didn’t hear it, Malfoy said, “Okay. Yes.”
Harry was still struggling to slow his breathing down. He felt like he’d been trampled by an Erumpent.
“People do incomprehensible things, Mr Potter,” said Orkney. “It’s unfortunate, but it’s how the world is. Not everyone cares how their actions affect others so long as they themselves are not unduly harmed. That is a sentiment, I’d wager, that escapes you.”
The St Mungo’s Healers arrived then, a stretcher between them. Madam Pomfrey explained the situation as they, too, checked Harry over for vital and magical signs. He was lifted onto the stretcher. Draco directed them to his office Floo, all the while giving Harry a desperate, exasperated look.
“Yeah, but Atlantis is an island with roughly the same surface area as Greenland,” Harry said. “Hardly representative of the
“Right,” Harry said, grinning. They stared at each other awkwardly for a moment, and then Harry couldn’t take it anymore. He threw his arms around Ron and hugged him, not at all concerned with how gay they looked. Ron hugged him back, which was an even bigger surprise.
Galene led them through a broken door beyond the Queen’s toppled privacy screens. It led to a rough-hewn corridor, with steep steps leading down. Torches on the wall were lit by Muggle candles, some burnt so low they would soon go out. Draco dragged his fingers along the wall for balance as he descended, his legs still wobbly from the aeroplane. Their footsteps echoed like distant thunder, on and on they went.
“I think we’re going to Hogsmeade to have dinner at the new Tuscan-Malagasy fusion place this Saturday. You both should come. Bring people.”
The magically raised people were unsettlingly less concerned than Harry felt they should be—they seemed to find it strange and curious, but not anything that magic couldn’t take care of. It wasn’t like the ship had attacked them; it wasn’t like it was
Pansy tapped the newspaper. “There are Muggles on the internet having arguments about that thing you and Dudley saw. Some of them are blaming it on their government and some of them think it’s actually people from another planet.”
They rushed down the back stairs, took lefts and rights without thought, no care whatsoever where they ended up, but enjoying the game of losing Mrs Norris. Up ahead there was a classroom door ajar, with a faint blue light seeping out into the hallway. He grabbed Hermione’s hand and tugged her in. They fell against the door, breathless, laughing.
“You’ll take it,” Draco repeats, his white teeth sharp, so close he could rip Harry apart with those alone; he wouldn’t even need his words, but he’ll use them anyway, because Draco is Draco and those are his weapons. “How convenient for you, Potter. How
The models start streaming out behind him, walking briskly around the catwalk so the editorialists can get a few more snaps of his designs. He knows the very moment that Malfoy walks out in his boxers and open dressing gown, with his little white sparkles catching the low light and his fucking hard-on pressing against the soft silk fabric, because the roar of the crowd grows, impossibly, even louder.
“This chemical compound,” Wayne replied, and pointed his wand at the diagram. “It’s made of chlorine, oxygen, and hydrogen. It must’ve formed when the plastics decayed, although I don’t know where the chlorine came from.”
Draco was some feet away and even from this distance, Harry could see his hands shaking in terror. Draco cast again, but his lungs were depleted and even if he did get a new Bubblehead up now, there was no air around him to fill it. It would be a bubble of water. Harry looked up. The others were above them and hadn’t yet noticed the emergency, but the surface was still a two minutes swim to the top. Draco would never make it.
Harry pressed his lips together. He felt so much for Draco in that moment because Draco was here anyway, ready or not. “Me neither.”
“Right, but I only have Hermione’s email address,” Harry said. “Well, and Dudley’s. How do I tell Muggles about it?”
He’s been dead, out of his body, out of his head—where has he heard that before? He needs to be back in himself, in his own feelings, everything he’s given up to keep himself from falling over the edge since he left Draco’s flat and came into his office to find his friend dying. She’s Hedwig, reincarnated, he thinks. She’s his mother, bound to be born and die with him over and over and over again, teaching him an important lesson that he’s taken too many years to learn. But now, she is Nigella, and she is dying at the back of his office while he tries to save everyone but himself, and she deserves him to
The door to Hermione’s room opened and Millicent strolled out, glanced disinterestedly in their direction, and then noticed the potion. “Liver, is it?” she said, sounding very much as if she couldn’t care less.
Padma, pursed her lips and finished for her. “Chieftess Kaybree, and Chieftess Mother Brynlee, along with all twelve of Chieftess Kaybree’s husbands—”
Well, maybe exiled was too strong a word for it, but to Harry, it didn’t really feel too strong. He felt like he’d been pushed between a rock and a hard place, and the Minister had
“Oh, for fuck’s sake,” Draco says, slumping back against the bed. “She’s just a child. She doesn’t need to be saddled with all of your baggage. She hasn’t done anything to deserve it yet. Save this emotional guilt trip for when she’s coming home from sixth year engaged to a Hufflepuff.”
“Can me and Scorpius go down to the Quidditch pitch and watch the Hufflepuff practice? We’ll take Ms Danger.”
Her gaze moved and settled on Harry. He smiled at her and she returned it. ‘Eat your chocolate,’ she mouthed. He grinned at her. She was so very different from McGonagall, and so very alike, too.
They crossed Trafalgar Square, all twenty of his students fixing hawk eyes on the crowd around it. The tourists snapping photos in front of Nelson’s Column appeared in good spirits. The British Muggles, hurriedly making their way to and from work looked generally displeased by the raucousness, but that was hardly unusual.
Hermione levers herself up from the stool and drains the last of her coffee. “Obviously I’ll need it.”
She ignored him. “Plus, we really helped the Mers. Even if it doesn’t seem like we did enough, we did a lot, Harry. They can’t ignore that ward. The beaches are
It still smelled like him, Draco thought as they entered. That same herbal mix that had always reminded Draco of the digestive bitters his parents served after dinner parties. As if Draco’s godfather had just been here, breathed in, and breathed himself out into the room.
They fell back onto Harry’s bed, arms and legs tangled. Malfoy’s wrist brushed against Harry’s cheek as he tangled long fingers in Harry’s hair. This close, Harry could feel Malfoy’s warm breath mingling with his own, their mouths coming together again and again. He thought he’d die if he had to stop kissing Malfoy.
Harry sighed, annoyed, and went to grab their No Refuse Left Behind Biodegrading Portkey™ aubergine, ignoring Malfoy again. If he had to speak to him again, he’d sick up all over him. Maybe on purpose. Malfoy followed him over, holding onto the aubergine just by Harry’s hand.
game box and he knows she’ll be playing it before the night’s over. Honestly, why she doesn’t just get her own…
The scenery never changed. He just kept walking, and walking. It was a familiar scene. A scene he’d walked before, in real life, only months after he’d started using it as a meditation device. Had his subconscious known he would walk the forest to his death? Had it known how quiet it would be when he did?
But then Malfoy stood to leave, breaking the moment and the muffling spell, and leaving Harry stuck half-transformed and wholly undone. His entire life was becoming an Animagus transformation. He just wasn’t sure which he wanted to be—human or animal, present or future, Harry or…someone who liked Malfoy.
Both Harry and Hermione were desperately curious to see who Malfoy had brought with him, but the living room was empty, save for Malfoy. They heard Lee’s laughter trailing in from the kitchen and headed that way, ostensibly to set down the food and drinks.
“Come on and get dressed for breakfast, okay?” Potter said. “Then you’ve got to finish your homework for school on Monday. I know you have an assignment due in your Maths.”
Millicent tipped her head back towards the sitting room. “I’ve been carting him around with us for days. Dunno what to do with him. I was planning to use him for ransom for Dudley.”
Draco was in jeans and a t-shirt, as Muggle clothing was always required at Andromeda’s events. Having discovered the internet in 2002, Andromeda had in recent years become a Mummy Blogger with a popular blog, ironically titled ‘Our Magical Home’. She therefore insisted that they be Muggle appropriate in case she wanted any photos for her blog. Teddy’s hair colours were explained away as liberal parenting.
“I—I really can’t do this, Potter,” Malfoy breaks in. He shakes his head several times, looking hunted. “I don’t want them. Keep them.”
He’d just thought he was over this Potter attraction hippogriff shit. He was exasperated to find he was not.
Harry pushed himself out of bed, wobbling only a bit. He wasn’t fully back to himself yet, but he was getting there. He slipped out of his pyjamas and into the trousers Draco had brought him, pulled a fresh shirt over his head (the old Harpies shirt Ginny had given him, not one of his green ones) and slipped on his trainers. Draco shrank his things for him and led him to the Portkey point.
He slid off the bed, and fumbled with the buttons of his trousers until he managed to get them undone. Draco was still propped up, watching, apparently unconcerned about having his cock out. Hands shaking, Harry lowered his trousers, stepped out of them, and kicked them off to the side.
the whole sodding world. The others filled in around the edges without any efforts at all toward strategy. Most of the British Ministry officials did make an effort to get seats near the Queen, but had not acted quickly enough to be successful, and were stuck standing midway down the table next to the German Mugwump’s executive assistant, the sole representative for the ICW itself.
McGonagall slipped her glasses back on her face. “I’ve put my faith in you before, Professor Potter. I daresay I can do it again.” She turned then to Draco and Millicent, adding, “And I have never doubted either of you your resolve, Professors. Have the elves help you gather what you need and leave the castle within the hour. I won’t be able to
Draco’s eyes widened as Harry began to twist and stroke. Their eyes locked. Harry’s fingers slid up to tease at the underside of the head, and Draco’s mouth fell open, his eyelids sinking almost closed. Harry was fascinated by the way he seemed to struggle with breaths, the way his chest flushed, the way, he fingers curled and uncurled against the duvet.
Then the Portkey activated. It was a smoother trip this time, and Harry was only a little unsettled when they landed at the International Portkey Arrivals dais at JFK airport. Despite all the holiday travel, they were able to make good time exiting security and finding the Arrivals pick-up spot.
“Just now,” Draco said. Harry’s eyes followed the sound of his voice. Draco was leaning against a leg of his personal brewing station, breathing heavily and looking a little worse for wear. “I suspect he was seventy to seventy-five per cent drained before he managed to stop the flow and reverse it.”
Still, he knew a lost cause with Minerva. He tried for some levity: “I know. I just feel really compelled to die on this hill, you know? It’s my last battle.”
But no. Not all of them. These were not Nigella and Randy’s first litter. There had been one other a year ago, a set of two. But Fred had died and George grew up.
Draco didn’t answer. Even if he’d heard those mutinous thoughts, Draco always knew when to keep his mouth shut.
“I went with lobsters next,” Quincy said. “The crawfish were proving a bit difficult. I’m trying a few things, but I’ll have a batch of lobsters ready for release next Wednesday. And the lobsters
Malfoy’s smirk came slowly, but when it did, it made Harry’s chest clench in the most uncomfortable way. “I am known for my biting wit,” he said loftily, returning to his closing.
“Oh? What would you say?” Harry asked, as he reached Draco. He reached up and brushed Draco’s soft hair back from his face. Draco’s eyes flicked back and forth, taking in his expression. His smile was saucy and yet still somehow tender.
Malfoy pulled himself up on one elbow to look down at Harry. His face was contorted with disbelief. “No one? Ever? You’re twenty-six years old.” Belatedly, they both remembered that silencing spells existed and Malfoy cast one. He said, “You’ve never come without something in your arse, and you’ve never come from someone else pleasuring you?”
Draco rang off as they crossed the Mall. “He’s coming down now,” he said. “Apparently there’s an Inter-city Apparition point just inside the Smithsonian Castle.”
If for nothing else, meeting Miguela had made clear one thing: he could love Potions, in his own way. He wasn’t just doing this to keep himself from self-destructing. There was a magic in it that felt very like the magic in himself sometimes: chaotic, restless, ever-changing.
On the bedside table, Snape’s repaired portrait sat empty. He was no doubt back with McGonagall again, discussing the danger of allowing apprentices to attempt Alchemy for inter-subject projects. It felt weird having Snape on his side, even if Snape’s way of being on Harry’s side was to roll his eyes and tell McGonagall that Harry was entirely too stupid to ever successfully manage even a fraction of the Alchemical process, and this was proof that he’d never come close.
For one, Draco was certain he’d finally landed on the correct method to incorporate wands into the Atlantis spell. If his maths were correct (and they always were) then they could, theoretically, put out enough power between the two of them—assuming they were standing in Atlantis at the time—to reach the mainlands in either direction, rushing over the oceans in search of conduits to bounce it back into the air again, stronger than before.
Draco settled back into his meditation, and Harry leaned his head back against the wall and felt sort of amazed that Malfoy was letting him do this. Minutes passed, and then Draco’s arm began to tense. Without thinking, Harry leaned around him and held him—carefully—still. Draco didn’t immediately relax, but he didn’t jump up, either, and when another five minutes had passed in this manner, Draco finally, slowly, untensed. Harry lifted his head from Draco’s shoulder, and found him looking back, grey eyes intense and only inches away.
, after being reunited with me for less than a week in the fucking United States of Arseholes, you hump me on a kitchen table without so much as a by your leave! Do you not see anything wrong with this? Does
The meeting was scheduled just outside Annapolis in Cedarwood Cove at seven that evening, because Merpeople were, apparently, crepuscular. The six of them drove up in a Range Rover loaned to them by the Department of Non-Magical Perceptions. Padma was driving and Hermione navigating, and Blaise and Lee seemed to go back further than Harry had anticipated, which left him sitting next to Malfoy in the back row. It could’ve been worse.
He can’t help that he gets so excited over his research. This is the first time Apex, the Department Head, has ever assigned him anything that personally affects him. How did his mother’s love save him—that’s the current question, and one that Harry hopes he can answer with the help of a family of Wolpertingers. Even though everyone else in Love laughs at his adorable ‘pet bunbuns’ whenever they get a chance.
There was a heavy pause. “You named a female, squib kneazle after me,” Snape said, to clarify. Harry nodded, too busy trying to keep count to respond with words. “
Finally, there was nothing else Harry could do. He stood up and waded back to shore. Seabiscuit’s tank looked so lonely here. He couldn’t just take it back with him. So he decided to deconstruct it to its base elements and return it to the earth, as he had with the rubbish in the Bay. It was the work of only a few moments, and then there was nothing left to take back.
He turned around, found Potter watching him intently. Malfoy swallowed, kept talking, too excited to shut up.
Harry flopped back on his bed next to his mobile and crossed his hands behind his head, staring at the ceiling and thinking of hypoxic waters while he waited. His phone vibrated. Harry grabbed blindly for it and brought it to his face.
Harry was up with the sun, as usual, but he was feeling considerably less rested than he normally did. The ICW was meeting in Brussels, and he had an international Portkey to look forward to, which was never a good way to start a day. Especially when he was sharing it with Malfoy, pre-coffee.
Millicent, for her part, was not one to linger, and had replaced Dark Lady with her physical and metaphysical opposite by the weekend. Peep was white, frequently terrified, and annoying as fuck.
This morning it occurred in Potter’s rooms, with their keen-eyed sons giving them curious looks over their identical plates of eggs and bacon while Draco and Potter sipped coffee, read the newspaper, and pretended everything was totally normal.
“That I need to take the antidote right now,” said Harry, already moving towards the door. He’d find Miguela, and she’d give him the antidote, and then he could have his bollocks back.
“I chose to sponsor you because I thought you would need someone who understands Gryffindor in order to learn to understand your Hufflepuff side. I know we’ve never really spoken much, but I think we can understand one another, and I think you need that.”
A knock came at his portrait one night, and he waved his fingers vaguely in that direction to open the door, too engrossed in the September
Not a single one of them was willing to ignore a direct order from their Head of House, especially an order that involved mandatory hot chocolate. Professor Sprout must’ve sent word ahead to the house-elves, as there were eighteen hot chocolates with marshmallows waiting on the pass-through window when they got to the kitchens.
They had chosen to keep trying, and there was still some tension between Harry and Ron that Harry had, in Ron’s words, ‘given up’ and not joined him in Auror training. And Hermione would never say it, but she found it hard to stop trying, too, and she couldn’t understand how Harry would walk away from a good fight.
Zeph nodded. Quickly, Harry moved them along to the next sculpture, which was Titus’. He’d recreated a startlingly accurate and sturdy rendition of the London Eye. “I love London,” he said. “It’s the best city in the world. I’d never leave.”
Griphook gestured to three chairs before his desk, the one in the middle just a little higher so that Teddy could see over it. “Please, have a seat. Furleezja tells me that you must speak to me about the Patil-Nott financial review ceremony. Is there a problem?”
awake. What the fuck has been making him fall all over himself for Malfoy if he hasn’t got any allure?
They had to recombine the sulphur-infused quartz, the Poison, and the calcined ash. The question was how. Harry wanted to use fire, but he had no idea what ingredients composed Poison, and that was just asking for death.
But that was where the dream skewed from reality. In the dream, his parents were standing behind the Dark Lord—which had not happened—and they were frantically gesturing for him to come to them, to escape with them. Between him and his parents, the Dark Lord soliloquised.
They turn back to the cat—likely a kneazle—still staring at them from the window. Her eyes are clear and intelligent. She presses her nose against the glass. Unwillingly, Harry presses his hand back. He feels a thread, a shimmer of magic pass between them, the same magic Nigella gave him before he killed her to save himself, to save Draco.
“Harry Potter, one of two Muggle Immersion Professors at Hogwarts in Scotland,” and sat right back down.
Malfoy shrugged. “True, but I’m preparing for a Transfigurations apprenticeship. I don’t have time to teach you Potions. Nor do I care to.”
That sorted, they moved on to various and sundry Weasleys. He and Ron ended up going in together on a Precise Prose Quill for Percy because they were sort of expensive and Mrs Weasley would’ve been really miffed if they’d actually regifted old homework journals to him. He’d be really pleased with it, Harry suspected, since they edited everything one wrote with it to be as dry and academic as possible.
In the front, Dudley sat in the co-pilot’s seat, a thermos of tea in one hand, while he and his friend chatted over their electronic earmuffs to one another. Millicent was sat in the next seat back, with the alien next to her, listening in through her own earmuffs, but contributing nothing. She just stared out the window, frowning. Granger and Weasley sat behind them, hands clenched tightly together, while Granger read through the spells again and again, making notes in the margins with a lead pencil.
Harry breathed a laugh, turned his head to face Draco. Their noses brushed, and the brief connection sent a rush of want right through Harry. He couldn’t help himself. He pushed himself up and swung a leg over Draco’s thighs to straddle him.
from us?” Malfoy asked. They’d asked the same question yesterday at the library, but were no closer to an answer now.
“Mhm,” said Yaxley, staring at his phone again. It vibrated then, and Yaxley tapped out a few words. He stood from the table, sent the dishes zooming off to the department kitchen to start washing themselves. “Time to go.”
“It does,” Harry allowed, “but the couple doesn’t want to be rained out while they work through the vows.”
Malfoy laughed that time. He shook his head, disbelieving, probably, of Harry’s ridiculousness, but didn’t offer how long he himself had wanted it. Harry hoped it was for more than the five minutes preceding that interlude.
Harry was feeling more and more frustrated. Why couldn’t people just keep their noses out of things they didn’t fully understand? He knew who’d leaked the story—that underpaid admin. Probably for a cash deal. Maybe just to be an arsehole. But he knew one thing for certain—they wouldn’t have done it if they’d seen what Harry saw in the Mers, or heard their stories.
Harry’s not much of one for acoustics, but Luna’s never steered him wrong before and he pays her to care when he doesn’t, so he leaves her to it. He snatches up his knapsack and tosses it over his shoulder. Ivan Abbott opens the door for him as he approaches, as if Harry can’t fucking handle a doorknob on his own. He passes through without a nod. If Abbott strives to be a doorman instead of an intern then Harry is happy to oblige him.
He sloped off to the refreshments table and hoped that some enterprising student had come by earlier to spike the punch. Upon pouring himself a glass, he found that not to be the case, but positioned himself in a corner to nurse it anyway. Networking was not his thing. It wasn’t long before his peace was interrupted.
The cup went around again. When it got to him, Eloise drank from the cup, and said, “I, Eloise Ezola Midgen, druid of the Cup for four years, do hereby offer for initiation Harry Potter. Though he began Gryffindor, I have seen the love he has for our community, those he knows well and those he knows not at all. He gives selflessly. He is a true Hufflepuff.” She passed the cup to him, and he was startled to find that his hands were shaking when he accepted it from her.
“Neither am I,” said Anthony. “I’d find it very fascinating if I were, so don’t even try to give me that boring Shakespeare stuff. The only gay people in this room are you and Harry, and Harry hasn’t even figured it out yet.”
“In the meantime,” said Hermione, “we should talk about that New Year’s Eve party we landed with Fortescue’s.”
Harry grinned a little, his heart pounding furiously in his chest. He was on a cliff, and one word from Draco could send him in either direction, either plummeting into the gorge below or back to safety. Bravado had always worked for him in the past. “Give me a chance to show you that you’re worth it to me.”
Harry laughed. “And I was determined enough to leave it. They’ll be fine. We’re Hufflepuffs, remember? Together, we’re larger than any enemy.”
Then, to Draco’s great surprise and discomfort, the Queen spoke a few words in a strange language, a language unlike anything Draco had ever heard—a language the Translation Charm didn’t even bother to attempt translating—and reached out to take the alien’s hand. Sostrate closed her eyes.
“I know,” said Hermione. She read through her own checklist, finger skimming the paper as she went down. “You and I will arrive at three on the thirty-first and start in on the colour theme charms. Oh, and here’s a copy of the event timeline for you. Be sure to double check those firework and noise permits we secured from the Department of Community Affairs.”
Malfoy snorted. “Get out of my way, Potter. If I don’t eat breakfast, I will absolutely rip the head off of Ms Lovecraft in my class today. She’s been badgering me for ancient protection spells against Shoggoths for weeks.”
Harry rolled his eyes. Suddenly feeling weary, he pulled out a stool and slumped down at his worktable. There were two strips of litmus paper in front of him. One used to be blue. Both were now red.
“It’s just magic,” Draco told himself. “I know how to use the internet. I know how to board an aeroplane. I have transferrable skills. I can live as a Muggle.”
The boys rolled their eyes, but agreed, and when their waitress—Madison—returned with the ales, they put in their full orders. She left, giving Lee an extra smile. Harry leant back in his wrought iron chair and watched the people go past. The night was cooling off quickly, but the day’s heat lingered in the pavement, giving off a wistful sort of warmth.
“We could have fought it the right way, Harry,” said Draco. “You know, the way where you don’t irreversibly bind your own magic to another
, not gay,” Hermione said, as if this were a conversation they’d had more than once. Harry really hoped it wasn’t. “Don’t presume he’s
To his surprise, Draco grabbed his wrist and pulled him into an alley. He looked both ways, and smirked. “Can’t let anyone see us leaving,” he said. He stepped closer, one arm going round Harry’s waist to pull him in. Harry’s breath left him in a rush as their bodies came together. He knew his eyes were wide as he looked into Draco’s, but Draco just smirked again, and then he turned their bodies and the feeling of infiniteness that he always got during Apparition overcame him.
Apparently Malfoy, who’d spent an entire five-year house arrest reading about them like the annoying swot he was.
Hermione huffed. “The mirror, you twit.” It was reflecting the blue light from the wardrobe, making the whole room light up in a soft, eerie glow.
Harry grunts and rubs his hands slowly up and down Draco’s stomach until he lets go of the cravat and sinks back against Harry’s chest. “It’s just that I sort of almost like your mum these days and I don’t want her to hate me again.”
“Yeah,” said Dudley, rubbing the back of his neck. “No idea how you pulled that one off. Maybe magic just liked him better? I dunno, but she’s alive and so’s he. Poppy says he doesn’t have any magic, either, so maybe he somehow willed himself to be part of your spell.”
“The skiving snackboxes!” said Justin, chuckling. “I asked…” he hesitated for only a second before powering on: “I asked Fred and George about them once. They activate with stomach acid, but any acid will do. We could get vinegar from the kitchens.”
Then he had one Snitch left and as he stared at the men still waiting empty-handed, he realized he didn’t know any of their names. He couldn’t give the Snitch to one of them even if he wanted to. Harry began to panic. And that’s when he saw Malfoy’s scowling face in the back row. Relieved to have even one person he could call up, Harry said, “Draco Malfoy.”
He resumes his exploration of Draco’s arse with his tongue. Draco tries to resist for only a few more perfunctory moments before he relaxes back into the bed moaning. When he has Draco gasping for breath and begging him, he decides that’s well enough and slicks up his prick. Draco presses his bum back enticingly, and if there’s anything Harry doesn’t need when it comes to Draco, besides a broken nose, it’s enticing.
Harry’s heart is hammering so fast he thinks it might burst out of his ribs. It suddenly feels as if everything in the world has just flipped.
“It’s got to be corrupted,” Draco said. “The tethering spell the druids used is broken. It can’t renew. The magic’s just going to float around until it just wanders off into outer space, never to be seen again.”
“Oh, there it is,” Lee said, as he ducked to inconspicuously siphon the latte from his clothes with his wand. There was still a faint stain.
Usually in the bedroom, but sometimes again in the lab. And what was better—he’d started waking up to find Draco still there in the mornings. He didn’t know what Draco was telling Blaise or his mum, and frankly, he didn’t care. It still felt like a dream that would break apart and disintegrate like Ron and Hermione’s marriage if he studied it too closely, so he tried not to. He tried to keep his heart back and enjoy it, let things progress as Draco allowed them.
Harry couldn’t help turning for one last look at the train before he stepped through to the other side. It was the exact moment that Draco turned from his mother’s dotage to look his way. Their eyes met, and held, and then, with more willpower than he actually felt, Harry turned away and walked through the gate.
Malfoy seemed to notice his as well then, and it might’ve been Harry’s imagination, but he would’ve sworn Malfoy’s lips twitched upwards.
“Quite true,” McGonagall said. Daphne and Pansy grinned at one another. And there went Boot being happy about something.
“Goyle said that place is great,” Ron said. “I really want to try those sundried tomato rice dessert things.”
Malfoy looked at him as if he were mad, which was, all things considered, probably close to true. “You should get a
Harry has been married ninety-six years. He hasn’t touched his husband in eighty-nine. But god, how he wants to most days.
Harry did laugh, ducking his head, to hide the extent of his fondness for McGonagall and her inability to be subtle, even when she was breaking the rules. There was no question about whether or not to trust her. Headmistress or not, they were of a kind, and Gryffindors were loyal to their own. “One might be a crow, Headmistress.”
“Nothing,” said Harry. He couldn’t say it right now. Not when Draco was so worried about being experimented on by Muggles. But he could kiss him. That, at least, they could both handle at the moment. He leaned in. When their lips touched it was like fire down his spine. Harry had expected the thrill to lessen with each encounter, but it never did. It got stronger and stronger, and during landfill clean-ups, Harry would swear their magic did, too. Draco moaned into their kiss, and it made Harry shudder. He fell into Draco, kissing him desperately, determined that this moment shouldn’t end even if the world were to fall down all around them.
“Back to surnames, are we?” said Draco. The evenness of his voice helped Harry’s racing heart a little.
Harry suddenly wanted very much just to hug him. Instead, he just nodded and followed Malfoy to the Headmistress’s office.
She stood, came over to press a kiss to the top of Scorpius’s head, and patted Draco’s matching one with rather more amusement. “I’ll see you later.”
Sometimes, it was just so unnatural to be without him. Like they’d all been made from the same molecules, and even when he was far away, they could sense him in the way that they were incomplete themselves.
Downstairs, Seabiscuit looked even less thrilled at getting packed away as he had the first time. Harry apologised with a few crumbles of bacon.
Harry scowled. “I’m done with that. I want to do something unexpected.” It wasn’t until he said it that he realized how true it really was—and then, he paused, mouth parting slightly in understanding. That must be what his boggart meant; he was afraid of
“Of course she did, we told you!” Potter said, looking no less agitated. Draco could feel his own body tensing. They’d missed something. Something was wrong and—
“Hello,” said Quincy, after thoroughly rolling her eyes at her husband. “Quincy Addams Malfoy. Lovely to meet you.”
“Oh, thank Merlin,” Hermione said, stepping out. “I’d forgotten about the limited hearth space at the holiday. Oh, Millicent’s coming next, bugger.” She floated out the two most cumbersome cauldrons, and held them aloft while the floo activated again, before replacing them, once Millicent had exited.
Harry saw a crack in the armour and dug his fingers in. “Draco, I don’t want to lose you, but I think being forced to come here is the best thing that’s happened to me in years. It reminded me of the good parts of the magical world but it’s not stifling me in it. And I’ve seen my best friend more this month than I’ve seen her all year. It’s the first time in years that I haven’t been bored to death and vaguely resentful of the magical world, and part of that is because of you. The biggest part. If I go back to England, I’m going to be going back to watching Top Gear alone, on my couch, eating yesterday’s take-away. If we go back, it’ll definitely end us and you know it. The British wizarding world’s not going to stand for the two of us together, but here… here we can be anyone. We’re nobodies here. Hasn’t that felt like a relief to you?”
“I do,” Snape said, “but it is not easy.” He sounded like the words were being pulled from his mouth like teeth, every syllable painful and unwanted. He was
Ron and Hermione both rolled their eyes. “And a last minute career change to your worst subject ever,” Ron said.
No. That was a lie. Harry knew the uncomfortable and unbecoming ways a heart worked. He knew how one wanted—needed—to be near the person one loved, even when there wasn’t a scrap of a chance. He’d let himself get ripped off because of that for years, after all.
Lucius smirked wryly. “As well as I look every week in the Ministry announcements section of the paper, I’m sure.”
That sort of stubbornness was all that was, currently, keeping him from losing his shit in the middle of a Hogwarts corridor. He was, understandably, quite disturbed by the possibility that the Statute of Secrecy could’ve been damaged in such a startling fashion. All thoughts kept returning to Scorpius, tucked up safely in Astoria’s over-decorated suite. What would happen if Muggles found him? Would they hurt him? Experiment on him? Draco couldn’t stomach the thought.
She paused, eyed them shrewdly. “I suspect that you all have enough knowledge of worldly affairs to be going on with. Therefore, the Board has agreed to relax the requirements for eighth years. Any of you who wishes to apply for apprenticeship at Hogwarts must submit your proposal in writing by no later than 1 May.”
He walked them backwards into his bedroom, shut the door behind them. Malfoy flipped them around, pushed Harry against the wood. His mouth crashed into Harry’s again, and they both moaned, and that thought—that Malfoy was into this as much as Harry was—sent shivers of pleasure up and down Harry’s spine.
Harry’s heart skipped a beat and he forced himself to look forward, straight into Ms Jones’ narrowed gaze.
“Minister, with all due respect, their homes are being destroyed and their children are dying. Gruesomely.”
Ron gave him a sideways grin. “I know, mate,” he said, and even though he was smiling, there was sadness in his voice. “There’s time for happiness yet. For all of us.”
“So we have to both stop the riots and counter the fear. We can’t simply give the Mers what they want and be done with it. To do so will only prove to our cowardly government that we’re too powerful to be allowed home. We have to make the Mers happy while also evidencing that Potter and I are powerless to do much of anything useful.”
“For all I know, you don’t even have a secret. You’re just going to pretend you have one for ten years and then tell me it was all a laugh over a pint one day.”
They made their way out the castle and down the path to the gates. The clearing where they did their rituals was on the other side of the castle, but Harry felt like the entire forest was part of them now. He brushed his fingers along the leaves and branches as they walked past, humming the melody of the spell they incanted before Yule.
“This is the first instance of AMCC, so you’re something of my test subjects. I’ve structured the syllabus by region rather than chronologically, as you’ll find that cultures and their methods of spell casting were derivative. For example, we’ll talk about the similarities among Greek, Phoenician, and Atlantean schools of magic—and yes, I’ve reordered the lesson plans, given recent events, to cover Atlantis first.”
Hermione returned with their basket of ingredients and he set to work finely slicing the herbs per the book’s directions, and chopping the animal bits with less finesse to save time. On his NEWTs, he’d only get a set amount of time to brew his potion. He knew now that he could save time on the fatty bits because of the way fat reacted with other ingredients.
Draco slid into his seat and folded his hands on the table before him. A moment later, Potter practically fell into his own seat, giving Draco a tight smile as he did.
Malfoy wasn’t the type to be scared. The last time Malfoy’d shown fear, he’d been climbing a tower of burning furniture. Harry didn’t want to see if that fear was there again.
“Take Shaadhon,” Ziyad says immediately. “He can sniff strong magic out. As a matter of fact, he’s been really excitable lately. I thought it was just you showing up, but now that I think on it, he started a few days before you arrived. Has it been here all along?”
“If this could’ve really been done before then why didn’t Muggleborn children do it to their families ages ago?” asked Harry. Surely at least Hermione would’ve given it a try.
Harry grimaced. “Can we? They sent me here because I was the only expert on water with ties to the Wizarding world; they didn’t have a plan or even the
exponential. And further, it wouldn’t just be an even distribution. The land naturally wants to renew itself from whatever sources are nearby – us. But our bodies have built-in protections against leeching; our magic would fight very hard to stay in us, and that will tire out the land even more. The least sentient and oldest magics around magical communities would go first… things like the protections around Hogwarts grounds, which were set a thousand years ago, and those around the Ministry, which came only a few hundred years later. The sentient magics, like Hogwarts castle itself, and the newest set magics will be strongest, so at least brooms will keep working.”
His students were subdued, as they had been since the ship sighting earlier in the school year, but some seemed to be rallying. There was a general consensus that things were going back to normal.
“I’m gay,” Draco says, as if this trumps all. He still can’t stop looking at Hermione’s face, though.
“Our goal today is to demonstrate magic to you in order to convince you of our community’s existence. We understand there are non-magical people who perform ‘tricks’ that look like magic, but this is not that. You may take turns checking us for hidden devices or props, but please—no more than two or three at a time, and keep the floor clear for the cameras.
“Because the code’s blown up with the explosions. I’m not even a hundred per cent sure this is it, but from some of these pictures, it looks like there are always messages written, and those messages probably give directions for the next attack.”
Blaise was already toying with the idea of doing exactly that, if his close proximity to the line and contemplative expression were any indicator. Lee jogged over, tapped his toe on the other side and then grinned. No sirens blared.
The kitchen was on the ground floor now, taking up the back corner where the library had once been and flowing into an open living and dining area that gave lots more light than the original floorplan had allowed. Harry had converted the  whole thing into a single room, taken out the mouldy house elf heads and burnt them in a garden bonfire along with the dining room table, a curio cabinet he couldn’t unlock, the rugs, the curtains, and two books, both of which had attacked him in his sleep when he’d nodded off in the library.
The charm snaps on his head, sounding a long, high-pitched ringing in the middle of his brain while it calibrates to his location, native tongue, and the words he’s presently looking at. He scrunches his eyes closed and breathes through the discomfort until the ringing stops. There’s a soft chime to alert him the charm is active (as if he wouldn’t be able to tell). He opens his eyes and scans the cover sheet, noting down the Aurors involved, the date, the situation, etc. etc. etc., with only half a mind.
Harry meets his eyes again, feeling his skin tighten with the uncomfortable crawl of dread. He’s an Auror, for fuck’s sake; it’s not like Lucius or Narcissa could do anything to him if he told them he’d knocked their son up...but the thing is, when the Malfoys find out, that means that the Weasleys will be shortly following. And what if they don’t like it? What if they can’t get past Draco’s past? What if they make him choose between them and Draco and his baby?
Draco nodded. “Good. I want Teddy to have the best chance possible with Gringotts. I don’t want our… indiscretion to harm his prospects.”
“I could latch on to several things,” Harry said, leaning forward. “But right now, I’m thinking of that time, last year. We were in your office—”
“Oh, right here,” said Harry, patting awkwardly at his sternum. “And a bit down, too. Hard to breathe.”
“Erm,” said Harry. He shifted to his other foot, only now realizing how weird it was to be alone in a dark corridor, talking to Malfoy. “I guess I do now?”
Abruptly, the Queen stopped screaming. She and the alien fell still and lifeless on the ground. The fog of magic rushed up, pushing them all back with its force, and Draco started counting in his head, his wand still raised, as they barely managed to maintain the grid.
Neville looked relieved. He hesitated for a moment and then said, “Hey, Harry? I just want to say… I’m glad you’re here. I didn’t know where you’d get sorted, but Hufflepuff suits you.”
“Spare me,” Snape said. He crossed his arms over his chest, stared at Harry for a moment past good manners, and then crossed to the stool at his painted potions laboratory work table. “You don’t have the patience to be a Healer, Potter. Nor for artistic endeavours, or rather, anything at all. I do wonder—will you manage to contribute to society at all?”
“I know,” Potter said, firmly, “but it will be an even bigger disaster without Muggles standing with us for the spell. I’ve no doubt of that. This wasn’t a choice for us, Headmistress. There
It turned out that Harry and Hermione both had previously undiscovered creative streaks, something that surprised everyone who knew them. With the success of their Fortescue New Year’s event, the press had got hold of their venture and done several pieces on their business, which they belatedly came up with a name for and registered with the Ministry, once Francine Fortescue asked them for it and they abruptly realised they’d forgotten it.
“Hm?” said Harry, turning his head as little as possible to see her, so he wouldn’t have to take it off Draco’s shoulder.
“You knew about them?” asked Draco. The chocolate was definitely helping, and he felt his body responding to him again, his limbs flowing with blood.
“Fuck! Fuck, don’t say it,” Harry yelped. He reached down and dug Hermione’s claws out of his thigh. “Shit.
“Not that different,” Harry said, scrunching his nose. “Just opposite. One part creates value, another destroys it. The link is already there.”
And the more time he spent with Malfoy in their Friday night tip-for-tip meetings, the more that jealousy was both diffused and strengthened. He and Malfoy were becoming
Terry clapped him on the back. “Bad luck, mate. Now you’ve got to have a free dinner with Malfoy. Could be worse—could play for the Cannons. Then you’d have to wear orange
“It’s how I roll,” Harry said, shrugging. “And also, you know I’m stupidly in love with you, right? Like, it’s really bad.”
with paws. When the third hour came, and I still couldn’t change back, I decided to wait it out, but I’m not a patient person.
Severus eyed him. “Yes, but it also means your time is limited. With this extra activity, she has very little time to assist. This will be left to you to solve.”
Harry craned his neck down to the middle of the table, and found McGonagall’s sharp green eyes glaring back at them. “She did, mate.”
“Professor Sprout’s writing to some colleagues at Oxford to get an analysis on some samples,” Neville said. “She’s pretty certain it’s hydrocarbons, but we don’t have the equipment here to test for that.”
Potter’s tent,” Draco called. A gaudy purple bag on the floor started wiggling wildly and Potter jumped on it, making an ‘Ah ha!’ sound.
Madam Pomfrey made a face. “As I understand it, Pansy,” she said, as she turned and led them further back into the Infirmary. “It wasn’t
It was really late before the Grangers, Mrs Brown, and Mr Lovegood left for their own homes. Harry, Draco, and Ron were all yawning hugely by the time they stumbled into bed. Even the stupid lit-up poster above his bed didn’t keep him from passing out, dead asleep, within minutes.
Sostrate continued on, telling how magic came about and the threat it represented to the aliens. She was careful in how she phrased their response to it, but left no doubt the danger they posed to magical and non-magical alike. When she finished, by telling the story of Atlantis’s hiding from the Creators, of how she and her council lost their magic in the process, of how magic chose this time to bring them back because this was when they were needed, there was a silence.
, I really do. I love hanging out with him and teaching him things. I just don’t…fuck, I don’t know. I feel better making the world a better place
“I dunno. I kind of like this area. Maybe I could just put it next door. The wizard-space spells aren’t that difficult. I’d just need to get a permit from MACUSA, probably pay some import taxes. A few general forgetfulness spells and the Muggles would even think it had been here the whole time.”
“That’s why I want to play them,” Draco says. “For example...” He puts down a black card and reads, “‘What ended my last relationship?’ — Harry Potter.”
Malfoy eyed his cauldron. The water in his spare pewter cauldron was simmering now, but Harry hadn’t done anything else to it. “Is that just distilled water?” he asked. Harry nodded. “Set up your lead cauldron with a vitriol base and watch the differences in how they heat.”
Lucius grimaced, tied off his hair, and knelt on the pillow next to Narcissa. “We had to call Healer Farrow in to fix our hearing. Your mother had a ringing.”
“It is dangerous to them,” said the Queen. “Technology and magic—those are two things that can destroy worlds. It only took technology for them to destroy their own; they do not want to adapt to a world only to have to leave it again.”
“They seemed…fine.” Hermione stared at her plate. The silence around the table was tense enough to make Harry’s skin crawl. Ron didn’t notice. Harry wasn’t sure he’d even noticed the swearing yet, actually.
The newspaper article was just a little fluff piece, but it made Harry’s gut clench in a way he hadn’t experienced since Horcrux hunting—that ‘instinct’ feeling was going off like bells. He couldn’t place it.
The Queen frowned, but Draco knew it was not at him particularly, but at the message he’d been forced to relay.
People shuffled, looked around at one another with confused, awkward grins. A few chuckled. Most looked bemused to some degree, and uncomfortable to another.
, Harry snaps. The man hesitates. Harry stands up, projecting his most menacing face, and he drops the towel and Apparates out.
The Queen opened her eyes, stared up at the blank, stone ceiling above them, and took a steadying breath. “We must hurry. They know we’re doing something.”
In twenty minutes, the first round of distillation had completed. Harry separated out the impurities, then emptied the alembic back into the cauldron to start the process again. He sat back down, next to Draco. The backs of their hands were touching. Harry closed his eyes and focused on the feeling.
Harry crouches down, whipping his measuring tape from around his neck and running it up Malfoy’s inside leg. Everything looks to be in order but perhaps he could take it in another eighth of an inch since they’re being worn so low. It’s getting late now. He can hear Luna and Marietta lining the models up with their Thestrals and in the background, Ivan’s probably holding a door.
“Ah,” the Queen said. She set Severus’s portrait on the fountain’s edge, angled for viewing. “Where shall I lie?”
Ron sighed. “That’s just like you. Plenty of more tolerable people you could fall in love with all over wizarding London, or even Muggle London, and you pick Malfoy. I suppose you can’t buy good taste.”
Ron slumps back in his chair, whistling faintly. “I dunno, Harry. But thinking on it, that’s what Veelas do to rope ‘em in, isn’t it?”
She nodded once, and walked out. The other Hufflepuffs were busy studying, and the rest of the Great Hall was empty. Harry supposed it was about time for that tea with Hagrid. He had a lot to think about.
Malfoy reached up and brushed his hair back from his face, but it floated out again, and Harry desperately wanted to touch it himself. How smooth would it feel underwater? How would it fall against his face when he stepped out? Suddenly, he was reminded of visiting Malfoy at Hogwarts, waiting for him to finish brewing so they could talk the Chemistry-Potions divide and Malfoy could rip him off on some litmus papers. Malfoy’s hair had always stuck against his face then, damp from the heat of his cauldron, and Harry had always wanted to brush it back then, too.
, that he found himself thinking it scared him more than if London Muggles had straight up reported how to get into Diagon Alley.
“It’s just thirty-six hours,” Harry said, tiredly. He was ready for about three cups of coffee himself. “And I slept off seven of them.”
Malfoy shook his head. “I mean, we aren’t just looking for a few Muggles to help us out, Muggles who already know about us, like Granger’s parents or Dudley. We’re going to have to tell
“I’m sure,” Hermione said, dryly. She was seated next to Padma, both poring over a map of the United States while lovely-smelling coffee steamed in mugs before them.
Thus, he was last to arrive at the staff room, and of course there was only one empty seat remaining. The one next to Draco. His kneazle trotted in after him (she refused to stay behind and her caterwauling was not something he would willingly suffer), curled up on his lap and immediately went to sleep. He felt eyes on him; cut his own to the right, and was simultaneously pleased and dismayed to find Draco smirking at him.
Draco nodded, accepting this easily. “What was different about this one piece of gneiss? The explosion woke me up, so I know it was big. Could have easily been fatal, if not for your annoying magical strength. So, death or near-death is apparently required to make an object that gives eternal life. It’s macabre, but it’s balanced. Why that particular stone though?”
It still had a month to brew, and then Snape was going to have Miguela put animal hairs in two, and her own hair in the third. Harry would have to figure out which two were bad, take the one with Miguela’s, and report on what happened to the body when one changed genders via potion versus via human transfiguration. He was not looking forward to it.
Or maybe, he just remembered, somehow, the path he’d taken during the final battle, for it wasn’t long before the trees broke away and Harry was staring into a clearing. He inhaled sharply. Ten feet before him, he’d died.
New York City was a whirlwind of activity from the moment they arrived. Luna’d scheduled a tour of the city that took up the entire first day and left Harry raw and exhausted and a little bit lighter than he’d felt in a long time. They saw the Statue of Liberty, and on the crowded ferry back to Manhattan, Malfoy pressed close to his side, the heat of his body taking off the chill from the ocean breeze. Harry shivered anyway.
The best thing to do when Hermione was upset was let her work through it on her own. She never trusted anyone else to do as good a job, and she was probably right.
“Do you think today’s news coverage will be better or worse?” asked Potter, biting down into his sandwich while holding Draco’s out to him.
Draco tipped his glass to him and they both took a slow sip. Their glasses clunked against the wood of the table in quick succession, and it sounded to Harry like the sharp, abortive noise of finality.
Down and down they went. Draco seemed to have forgotten the existence of No Spill Spells; either that or he’d wanted the excuse to focus on his wine glass and say nothing as he let Harry draw shapes on his back all the way down to the lower vaults. They slowed and Harry quickly readjusted himself.
“What must be done?” asked Narcissa. She sneered at the alien, ground the foot of her boot into its toes, and it hissed in pain. “We must stop them.”
“All right, get your cloaks on and Transfigure them to the navy Muggle peacoat we studied in third year. We’ll Floo down to Diagon and then take a walk through London so you can all see for yourselves that the Muggles are still fine.”
They wandered through St James Park. Muggles strolled with friends, sat on benches chatting on their mobiles, and played in the grass. Despite it being only just ten on a weekday, the park was bustling.
Ron looked at him quickly, but seemed to realised Harry wasn’t hitting on him. He shuddered—probably thinking about Harry’s sex life with Malfoy again. Harry really hoped that would continue. Draco had been pretty pissed off.
Harry yawns. He’s had a lot of time to think about what he’s going to say this morning—a lot of time to consider the phrasing and word choice and voice modulation—and yet, he still chooses to go with: “Are we Mated now that you’ve fucked me?”
Slughorn called: “I’ll have a decanted sample on my desk before you leave, then a twelve inch essay on the process due a week from today. And don’t forget that you’re all invited to my little party this Saturday evening. Eight pm, come dressed for success and fun!”
Inwardly sighing, outwardly smiling, he rose and accepted the handshake she was offering. “Any pet you’d like—any pet at all. I can’t thank you enough for what you did—”
“I want clams on a stick,” says a young female Auror. “And a stick of scorpions, too. Here, I’ll give you gold for those. A wizard with a baby Manticore sells them near the docks.” She passes him a handful of knuts and sickles and then wanders away. Everyone else seems okay with the shawarma, whatever the fuck that is, but Fievel gives him a list, and it’s in English, so he will persevere.
“What kind of not-right?” Ron asks, finally settling onto his knees and leaning in closer to the Floo. Ron’s always trusted Harry’s instincts on things like this, and as a fellow explosives Auror, he knows exactly how wrong things can go when Aurors who aren’t trained for them try to deal with explosion spells.
“A few orders of business, and then I’ll see the first-year apprentices. Firstly, Professor Switch will finally be taking on the role of Head of Gryffindor. If you have any issues with Gryffindor students—”
“I love him,” Harry said, somewhat stupidly. By the lowering of Narcissa’s eyelids, he could tell that she agreed.
They brought the boys down with them, though Harry despaired of ever convincing Albus of the brilliance of sports in general and Chelsea in particular.
Titus’ eyebrows waggled. “Oh, I know all about those sorts of nights. He leaned in, grinning roguishly, and took a bite of his gyro. Tzatziki remained on his lips, and Harry eye’s flickered to his mouth. Titus’ tongue slid out to lick it clean. Harry’d never seen a gyro made to look so delicious. He bit into his own. So good.
“Potter, you kinky slut,” Malfoy says, taking up an achingly slow thrust. “If I’d known you’d get a hard-on for my erection in your clothes, I would’ve taken a picture of myself every Friday night for you.”
“Of course we don’t think that,” Hermione jumped in quickly. “But it is surprising to see fire burning underwater. On land, water puts fire out. How do you do it?”
, he thought. He and Ron could be mates until the end of the world, and it still wouldn’t make up for the feeling he got whenever he turned to tell Draco something funny, and Draco wasn’t there.
“Even if you could talk, which might I add is extremely important in the field, the fact remains that your reporting officer hasn’t cleared you for field work yet. Or, really, any work.” The Auror-in-Charge thumbs through the folder on her desk and then looks back up at him with a patient expression. “You’re suspended pending medical evaluation, Auror Potter. To be frank, there’s no way in Merlin’s infinite arsehole that I’m accepting a transfer request from you.”
His breath caught. He released it in a shudder, and then a second finger followed and then Draco was
Neville looked like he was getting on board. “Eighty percent is nothing to scoff at. But it would be more like a plaster on a wound because we don’t know what’s really causing the problem, only that it’s probably in landfills, smog, water, and the ground.”
She switched, automatically, to Mandarin, her voice clipped and angry even in a different language. The alien, to everyone’s surprise, narrowed its eyes as she spoke, and then, after a moment, replied back.
“You’re overthinking it,” said Harry, who was grateful Malfoy apparently hadn’t caught Harry’s Freudian slip. “It’s probably part of your animal’s temperament. Why don’t you meditate again here, and when you reach the visualisation stage, focus on the feelings of restlessness instead of pulling out of the meditation.”
Draco hesitated. He turned his head, focusing on the china cabinet full of taxidermied fairies that Harry kept meaning to toss. “I don’t know. I need time to think.”
“You shoved me in there and cast all those high-grade privacy spells! You could’ve locked the door, too, you know!”
He sets the mail down on the counter when he’s done, goes to the icebox to pull out a jug of pomegranate juice, chugs straight from the glass, puts it back, and then spells away the jizz from his table. Where the fuck is his Crup, he wonders. Hermione comes by to feed her and let her out during the Seasons, but it doesn’t mean the little shit won’t start in on Harry’s loafers if she gets bored enough.
Professor Sprout bustled over, peering down at the lump of soil in his testing dish. She prodded it with her wand. Her eyebrows furrowed further, and then she stood and looked around the greenhouse. “Has anyone else got to this step yet?”
He looked over his shoulder and then dumped out all three of their glasses in the shrubs, inconspicuously refilling them with
Millicent’s fingers clenched around Harry’s thigh. “Are you—really okay?” she asked, working her throat. “I mean, you sound okay, but are you really okay?”
Malfoy’s smile turned soft for a tiny moment. Candlelight was reflecting little bright sparks in his eyes. “Dumbledore was a Transfiguration Master, too.”
The Mediwitch takes Twin Two from him and then rolls her eyes. “She’s hungry, Mr Potter. I’ll send a Mediwitch in with formula to teach you both how to feed them.”
The worldwide magical population just wasn’t large enough to complete a spell so large. And it certainly wasn’t capable of harnessing the power of Muggle tech without Muggle assistance. But Muggles didn’t have magic, which put them right back at the beginning.
Severia blinked wide green eyes at Snape’s portrait, and then flexed her front feet lazily against Draco’s chest. She made a little rumbly, mewly sound and curled her fluffy tail up before falling back asleep. Snape narrowed his Perylene eyes.
Luna hmms in response. “You’re referring to Draco? And the fact that he moved to Beirut four weeks ago?”
“I found the pattern. It’s fucking Muggle technology. They’re bombing places on Wikipedia pages for each of the locations. And look." He hands Draco a print out from Google Maps Street View. The photograph was taken only weeks before today’s bombing, and barely visible on the bottom of the statue is a short string of Arabic graffiti.
It was only 4:30 here and the barest hints of civil twilight were coming through. It was quiet and peaceful everywhere. The leypoint was at the bottom of the south-end of the Golden Gate Bridge, in a national park. He didn’t have to worry about being seen. This part of the world was still sleeping, just a few early risers already on the road and getting started with their days.
Draco does so, and they each pick up a couple. There are patterns here. Patterns Harry’s seen only in his head until now. That’s always been his value to the Aurors, this preternatural knowledge that he can often only prove until after the fact. Harry knows things, and then he finds the evidence for them. Draco works the other way, and their partnership has always been a clash of instinct and evidence.
“Each time the…the aliens came to my house, they came after he’d been by. They were looking for him. When I found one in the house, it was in his old room, the one he still sleeps in when he visits. They were never interested in
Draco frowned, reached up and tapped the stone with his wand. It emitted a soft, even hum that resonated all through the room. “You’re right…” he said, wonderingly. “I’ve never seen red quartz before, but it’s definitely resonating like it.”
When he’d ascertained that the coast was clear, he came fully into the kitchen. “What’s wrong with Draco?” he asked.
Harry laughed. “Hey, kiddo. I bet you are,” he said, piecing together only a few of the Gobbledegook words. Teddy’s enthusiasm over the years had forced him to learn some basic phrases, but the best he could do in this situation was infer Teddy’s excitement at finally going off to school.
was going on. They just hadn’t yet pinpointed what that something was. Letters to the editor opined a number of different explanations, from a perfectly plausible (to some) wormhole, to a connection with crop circles in Wiltshire. No one had yet suggested magic.
“Oh?” said Harry. They were still carefully not looking at each other. Matters of the heart were entirely too much to bear when they were about your best mate. It was gross, frankly.
a culture. We are many, many cultures, actually, but we are all over the world. In every country, we exist. In nearly all, we have remained hidden, at first due to our own fear of non-magical people, and later because of law. An international body, the International Confederation of Wizards, established a global law in 1692 that prevents any magic-user from revealing, through action or inaction, the presence of the ‘wizarding world’. By doing so today, Harry and I are committing a grave act of international treason. We therefore ask your cooperation, attention, and kindness, as it is unlikely we will be…free to provide this demonstration ever again.”
A harassed yelp came from his wardrobe as his last jumper flew in, and then his kneazle jumped out, her face covered by the same.
Extracurricular time with Malfoy was a horrible idea. For one, he’d probably enjoy it. Right up until Malfoy made some smart remark about Hermione’s parents, which was an even more forbidden topic than before. Could he stand to be around Malfoy and keep his weird desires under wraps in the interest of the greater good—or at least, his
There’s an uncomfortable silence. Harry happily sips his tea, even though he doesn’t like it, and smiles at Narcissa and Druella. Druella still refuses to even look at him, which is not a problem for Harry since he and Draco have moved into the Malfoy property here in the city anyway.
“It’s just Charms,” he said again. “You altered a Protean Charm for a galleon, made an infinite handbag, and survived a duel with Antonin Dolohov with only a 30 centimetre scratch. I think you’ll be fine.”
Harry shrugged. “The memo said you could decline for your own death, immediate family member death, or women’s issues. I didn’t think anyone would believe I had immediate family, and I worried my paycheque might stop if I said I was dead personally, so I ticked the box for women’s issues and sent the form back. No one noticed I’m not actually a woman so I figured they also wouldn’t notice if I actually didn’t show. It’s not my problem that Draco’s annoyed I thought of it first.”
“Splendid,” said Rosie. “Mum got me a new astronomy set—the one I’ve been wanting that has a mini black hole that really eats objects that come near it.”
“You’ve been all I could think about since Saturday,” Harry said as he tugged Draco inside. He locked the door behind them and turned to give Draco a saucy grin. “You knew that though, didn’t you?”
“Professor Potter,” said Gemma Lovecraft, during his fifth year Ravenclaw-Slytherin class. “Are you sure Muggles aren’t messengers of the Deep Ones? Because that’s what my mum says. And also that they’re going to feed us to the Shoggoths.”
Harry glared at him. “The only thing I’m missing is three weeks of my life. Thanks for that, by the way.”
face. Harry’s breathing slowly returned to normal, and he lowered himself to the bed next to Malfoy.
Harry’s mouth opened, closed. Opened again. “So that means if we performed this spell on Atlantis, we’d be able to tap into both our own power, the power under Atlantis,
“It helps if you close your eyes,” Potter eventually said, closing his own. “You need to clear your mind of extraneous thoughts…what you’re eating next, what your job’s like, what’s going on with your family. But all those things will seep into your head naturally, so the easiest thing I’ve found is to try to meditate on one thing. In this case, you could try meditating on the feel of energy coming into your body.”
“Addolgar was right – some of the samples were creating a magical trap. These are the samples that absorbed the most magic,” said Mandy. “They each absorbed ninety-five percent or more. The others did not absorb magic at all or absorbed very little of it… so little as to be considered negligible.”
“You really should’ve taken me up on those Nargle scouting expeditions I invited you to after Hogwarts,” Luna says. “Do you know which countries border Ireland?”
“Millicent,” Potter said, softly. “Surely this is a human rights violation. Er, an alien rights violation. Somewhere. An intergalactic one?”
Which of course set Draco off on a treatise of Hermes Kilgore’s ability to carry a shoddy team through to the Championship. The roar of the pub faded to the background, and sometime between their second and third firewhisky, Harry forgot completely that he was not supposed to be in love with Malfoy, and that in the event he was unable to help himself, he still wasn’t supposed to show it.
Malfoy quirked a grin. He had a rather nice grin, actually. And his cheeks, when they were flushed from exertion, were quite nice, too. “I wish that I could brag about this, but I’d much rather have a shot at a second go, so I won’t.”
Malfoy rolled his eyes. “Scorpius wouldn’t be able to inherit if he were illegitimate, you fuckwit.”
“I think you will find, madam,” the Queen said lowly, “that not only can I do that, I can also order executions. My patience is long, but you have worn it away like the tide. Leave,
Harry had lesson plans to work on and he needed to stop devoting mental energy to Malfoy, who was not worth it, despite pulling off skin darker than his own hair very well.
She looks to Harry and he shrugs. She asked him to do what he had to do to save them. He’s doing it. Whatever it takes, whatever ruthless measures. She has always known the cost of winning.
“Thank you,” Draco said. He tugged Harry close again, and together they watched the heather. It never changed, but that was a good thing. The dawn had already come. The light was already golden.
Hermione was waiting for him in his room when he came out. She took one look at the portrait and lifted her eyebrows. Harry shrugged. He couldn’t very well leave her all alone down there. She had been frightfully lonely since Kreacher’s death.
Harry kissed over his jaw, behind his ear, and Draco made the sluttiest little ‘unf’ sound and tilted his head sideways. Harry practically melted into him, thinking of nothing but the taste of Draco’s skin beneath his mouth, how Harry could almost taste the anger and primness in his sweat. He began unbuttoning Draco’s Auror robes, kissing down his neck and chest with each loosened button.
And to make matters worse (they could always be worse for Draco), Potter had been hired on eleven years prior and somehow Draco had not realised this when signing his employment contract. It had been a shock at breakfast that first day and Draco was still recovering from it. Even more so now that Astoria had taken to setting up playdates with Potter’s spawn.
Malfoy detoured them by the pet shop on their way to the Three Broomsticks. He grabbed hold of Harry’s arm to stop him in front of the window. “See—look at that cat there. It sort of looks like you.”
“Potter you ask too many questions,” Draco said tiredly. They fell into a silence, sipping on their Ever-Warm chocolates, and then Draco said, “My father always believed it was a network of pathways between our organs and vascular systems – a type of energy that sparked to life because of how other parts of our bodies worked.”
“No argument,” Draco sighs. He flops down again, takes another drink of the Firewhiskey, and passes the bottle to Harry. “And yet you find it without being trained in intelligence.”
“Yeah, it’s really cold,” he agreed. He pulled out a t-shirt from his drawer and slid it on, followed quickly by a warm flannel and his favourite comfy jeans and black sneakers. He grabbed Sirius’s old jacket from the back of the door and slipped it on. “You’re not going to stay in bed all day, are you? Don’t you have books to read?”
Harry stared into the fire, thinking. Did he have that problem? There were times when he’d ignored Hermione’s good advice because he didn’t like it, and certainly a better man would’ve sucked it up with Snape’s Occlumency lessons. Maybe he did. But did he still?
Pushing everything he had into the spell, he slashed his wand upwards, and with it, the room went blood-red and blindingly bright. In the distance, Harry heard Snape exclaim, but he didn’t have time to think about that as the first ward around the cauldron tore open and a gale of heat and wind and magic slammed out in all directions.
There was a pregnant silence. Malfoy sipped his whiskey and seemed to come to a decision. “I suppose you divorced because of her sexuality,” he said.
At the end of the tour, they wandered into the shop, which had items more to Harry’s tastes. Dildos, specifically. Large ones, vibrating ones…a new kind that pulsed, even. He wondered if it would be as good as when Malfoy had fucked him, if it would feel as good as his cock thrusting in and out.
“I know it isn’t healthy or normal to require another person in order to stay alive, but honestly, when has my head been healthy or normal since the war? We both know it hasn’t, and…that’s okay. You make me as normal as I can be. You’re my meaning of life. Without you, there
Why this wasn’t a done deal was quite beyond Harry. Hermione didn’t have any other support, and apprentices didn’t receive any stipend beyond room, board, and ten galleons a month. Barely enough for necessities. She needed it.
“Come in, come in,” Mrs Weasley said then, bustling Draco off to the table. “You’re entirely too thin, Draco. We were just finishing lunch. Have a mince pie. Or do you rather yorkshire pudding? There’s leftovers from last night.”
Well. Hermione was a saint, but Harry wasn’t sure that this wasn’t pushing it a bit far. “You’d better ask,” he said.
They got two crêpes from the Crêpe Love truck and sat down on a bench by the Smithsonian Castle to wait for Malfoy’s unexpectedly named cousin.
But the tiny creases around Malfoy’s mouth did kind of surprise him. They looked suspiciously like laugh lines.
“We’ve been through rather a lot together,” said Draco. There was no inflection to it, and Harry couldn’t gather what that meant. He was pretty sure Blaise and Malfoy didn’t sleep together, but… well, pureblooded wizards could be rather... Ancient Greek. There was really no telling.
“We might not have to if we can impress Francine Fortescue,” said Hermione. “If we do a good job for her mum’s shop, then she might write a story on our business. She usually writes in the business section.”
Harry sighed. He considered taking some breakfast and running like the Ravenclaws, but he had a strange need to be with his Hufflepuffs today. Just as he stood to return to his house, the post owls swooped in. Hermione’s copy of the
Harry was thrown backwards, his wand falling away somewhere, and had barely enough time to call out,
“Yes, because time is a construct of the mind,” Malfoy said. “There was the past, but it only exists if I let it exist and if other people let it exist. It’s only real here, in my brain.” He gestured at the brain again, and when he looked back at Harry, his expression was challenging. “I refuse to be bound by the past. I only recognize the present and the future.”
“Wow, second time out of Britain in my life, and it’s still cool,” Dudley said, peering out the window of the International Portkey Arrivals waiting room as they waited for their connection. “Mum would love to travel here. Looks way better than Brussels sprouts would have you believe.”
“So obvious and yet so effective,” Harry muses. He taps his wand to Two of Two’s wrist and a bracelet materialises declaring the same. He repeats it on One of Two. Draco sends him that smile, that same smile he’s never used in public before. Harry melts so hard that he’s almost afraid of dropping Baby Potter.
Harry snaps. He knows he shouldn’t be an arse, but the realisation that Malfoy doesn’t want him around is so very different from the reality he’s accustomed to that he can’t process it. His heart is somewhere in his throat right now.
“Draco,” Potter said, pointing to him and causing him to blink at the sound of his own name from Potter’s mouth, “is an historian of Atlantis. He’s studied your casting methods and history for years—what we know of them from records anyway—and he could probably help adapt it to modern spellcasting. I have a friend who’s very good at solving magical problems who could help, too.”
The sound stopped. Every single Hufflepuff collapsed. The last thing Harry saw before the world went black was the unnaturally pale irises of Draco’s grey eyes.
Luna shrugged, striding over to the window and snapping the curtains open. Harry groaned at the sudden influx of light. “I really couldn’t say, Harry. I’m neither a Muggle nor a San Franciscan.”
Hermione snorted, but shook her head. The cat was long gone by now, probably in Slytherin territory. “I hate that bloody cat. He leaves white fur all over my robes and he’s afraid of
Water was literally made of oxygen and hydrogen. How could the sea beings not be able to breathe? But then, just as soon as he asked the question, he knew the answer: it was a dead zone, sucked dry of oxygen by pollution and the algae that thrived in it.
Near the door, there was a small mahogany desk, and one single, old woman sat at it, writing in a vellum book with a crane-quill pen. She looked up when they entered. Her white hair was big, fluffy, piled atop her head in a braided bun, and contrasted sharply with her deep olive skin.
“What the hell is that?” Michael asked. Malfoy held out his hand, in which there was a clay bowl with a containing spell over the top.
He looked over to the Gryffindor table and saw Ron loading up his plate with croissants and kippers. Then he looked to the Ravenclaw table and saw Hermione grabbing two apples and a travel-size mushroom quiche to stuff in her bag before she, Parkinson, and Bulstrode ran out of the hall again. Harry narrowed his eyes in suspicion.
even for studying Muggles. But,” and here his voice softened further and he kept his eyes focused on the students filing in, “what really interests me is why the Muggles’ own governments haven’t released the information. We know enough major countries have met with her by now to know.”
“There’s got to be a way to talk to lots of Muggles on the internet,” Malfoy said. “My mother has a blog and talks at several dozen that way. Should we start some blogs? Ten or twelve? That won’t be nearly enough, but maybe word-of-mouth will help.”
Harry’s face contorted oddly—something between a pleasant smile and a baffled grimace. “Ms Lovecraft, I would be really interested to see your home life.”
Then Malfoy says, “Mushroom and parmesan soup with chive crème fraîche,” and Harry and Hermione both groan aloud. Fuck that sounds good.
Millicent and Hermione didn’t seem to have ever experienced it, or if they did, they hid it well. The loss of magic hit Harry the hardest of all of them, which surprised him. Before all this, he would’ve said Draco would’ve taken the longest to adjust.
