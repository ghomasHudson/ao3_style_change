Why did everyone think he always wanted to be involved in fighting, in defense?? He knew a fraction of the spells the Order had known, and he had only known a miniscule amount of the ones the Death Eaters had used against him. His repertoire of spells included the basic defensive spells and a few of those from the Half-Blood Prince. Fighting wasn’t his strong suit, it just happened to be what he
“Do they understand what they’re doing?” she asked, shoving a book in her bag and forcing the clasps closed.
“Undue… Strain… Draco, it’s not a big deal.” He quickly stood to grab his hand pull him close. “I just wanted one year where I could pretend I was a normal student, but as usual, you had different plans.”
“I… wasn’t sure if I was still mad at you.” Harry shrugged, looking away as he took a drink of his champagne.
“How can I make Draco understand? This isn’t something where I can just cry about my feelings and be better before Easter! There is so much pain, and anger, and grief, and guilt, and fear all the time… And Dumbledore said that these feelings made me human and I told him that I didn’t want to be human… And I meant it. What’s the point if all I’m going to feel is like shit all the time.”
trying, but there’s so much to do, to fix…” He trailed off, but Harry knew what he was thinking. So many people were lost during the war, so many jobs now unfilled because they’re corrupt or dead. Without much prodding, the conversation suddenly slammed to a halt as memories of their friends and family lost floated to the forefront. Ron took a deep, shuddery breath, and Harry swallowed his own tears. They looked down at their laps, thinking about different people and different what-ifs.
The first task was to lay Teddy down for a nap. The second was to start painting. The base coat went on easily enough, but the rest of the house took days. Of course, Harry insisted on doing it the Muggle way, which just made it take longer. But slowly, the house became more and more friendly.
But he kept his mouth firmly shut, and he and Draco sat in silence until Hermione came to ask them to dinner.
“Oh, I heard that the Patils just re-established trade with their partners in India, you must be working with them.”
With a triumphant grin, Draco set the stylus onto the carefully chosen record, closing his eyes as a guitar started happily plucked along to various bird calls in the background.
. Hermione, Andi, and I got rid of her this summer. Thankfully… Teddy’s fits were getting louder and longer, and so she would throw a fit and... it was...a busy summer.” Harry swallowed and stared past the empty space on the wall. In the blink of an eye, he was smiling again, ushering Draco through the hall to the main living room.
They walked dejectedly into the kitchen, Hermione taking a seat at the kitchen table while Harry picked up Teddy, bouncing him around and allowing the little tyke to gnaw on his potion-free fingers while he paced the kitchen.
i have discovered that once this story is finished, i'm going to be writing a few one shots and maybe even another, shorter, fic that talks about 19 yrs later. i have officially created my own universe
“He’ll need a minute,” Narcissa laughed. Seeing her son excited again was worth everything to her, and she didn’t want to miss it.
As they started towards the school, Draco slipped his hand into Harry’s and laced their fingers together. They didn’t look at one another. Both of their faces were a deep red, as silly as it was, at the fact that they were holding hands. Kissing was one thing, mostly in private and away from most everyone. Hand holding… Well, to the rest of the school, it might as well have been a declaration of love. Words didn’t fill the space between them, but they didn’t need to.
“Really? That’s sounds amazin’! What made yeh decide?” Hagrid added the tea leaves to the giant tea kettle, busying around the small hut while Harry collected his thoughts.
Seamus was late for breakfast the next morning, and the eighth years were gathered in a clump at what was previously the Gryffindor table looking a little worried. Seamus hadn’t missed a meal since they’d returned to Hogwarts for fear of them being taken away without reason, leftover from the cruel detentions he’d suffered last year.
He grinned like a lovesick boy, blushed, and flopped over and pushed his face into his pillow, suppressing a giggle. Merlin’s pants, he’d become a blubbering mess in a matter of hours.
“Draco Lucius Malfoy!” she called, still staring right at Harry and Andi. Wide-eyed, Draco hurried into the living room, Teddy on his hip (
Harry had launched into a story about how the boggart one of the upstairs rooms had turned into McGonagall telling Harry he was a failure as a wizard because he’d be unable to finish his time at Hogwarts, that he was worthless for needing an extra year.
“Oh, she never deserved him anyway!” Juliet, Nicholas’ wife, said with a laugh. “There were talks of him marrying a distant Brown cousin, but he met that mudblood and decided to throw all the traditions out the window. A good, pureblood boy married to that foul-mouthed mudblood
When they finally met up with Andi and Narcissa, they said there were going to take the food, the toddler, and what little Draco and Harry managed to agree on enough to buy home. The boys were given orders to stay behind and continuing searching, preferably in Diagon.
Ron and Hermione loved Harry, had been through so much with him, but there was only so much a person could take. He ate cereal forlornly. He sighed all the time. He rarely changed out of his pajamas. Harry was currently curled up on the couch, staring forlornly at the TV as it cycled through Saturday morning cartoons when Ron tugged Hermione into their tiny yellow kitchen.
He laughed on a shuddery breath as he pulled it from the box. It was split evenly into fourths, with a large panel with words on it in the center. The bottom left corner was a black muggle band tee, one of Sirius’ no doubt. The bottom right was a soft gray flannel. Harry had a feeling it was Remus’. The last two, sitting at the top of the pillow… They were soft and warm, and they complemented each other. One was a black soft tee that had been worn down to a gray, and the other was a soft blue.
“Unbelievable,” Hermione said as she threw her hands up. They settled into a desk at the back of the class,
“There are people looking to meet you.” Her voice was stiff and awkward, more so than it had been two weeks ago at the family dinner.
After another couple of pints, Harry suggested they leave. Tomorrow was Christmas Eve and there was a lot to be done.
Her tone wasn’t the scolding one she’d used during school. But she was being gentle and soft with him like he was fragile, and Harry wished she would just go back to scolding him for acting the way he was.
The night had crept up on them with horrible news floating in on the staticky underground Potter radio.
Harry stared at McGonagall for a second as she raised an eyebrow, her eyes crinkling slightly. Harry unfroze, stammering out, “Are you telling me to break more rules, Professor?”
As the holidays approached their end and the school year began to loom heavier over him, Harry had become a little more tense and closed off. Draco had tried to talk to him about it, but he would just shrug it off and would continue what he was doing. Harry was doing more repairs around Grimmauld Place, trying to fight off memories with pure exhaustion.
They’d told Dennis they’d been playing a new game they’d invented. It was basically tag with hexes and charms, but also had elements of Red Rover. Dennis didn’t fully understand it, but they’d been playing when all of the sudden Harry Potter had darted from around the corner and the next thing they knew, their wands were on the floor. One of Harry’s students had run to fetch Dennis, worry for his professor out weighing his fear. Eighth years were scary, and she really only knew Dennis. Once the story had been brokenly relayed, Dennis had rushed off to find Harry’s friends.
to break, Harry’s friends never strayed far from his side. Someone was always with him. Harry, not being completely stupid, noticed this. He wasn’t a child. He didn't need constant supervision. He’d survived this long on his own, he thought he would do just fine brooding by himself for a bit. So, he attempted to ditch them at every given opportunity.
Harry was recounting the most recent trial and tribulation with Teddy: his hair. He had decided to go mint green with what little hair he had, but was slowly discovering he could do more than one thing with his hair. Aunt Petunia had though Harry’s hair was near impossible to cut? Teddy made his hair grow whenever and however he wanted, often to the dismay of his godfather who was trying to trim his hair out of his eyes.
. Reluctantly, Draco agreed and off they went. It took longer than strictly necessary because Draco kept stopping, insisting on kisses. And who was Harry to deny him?
“These families are also fraught with social traps like you said, so maybe it wasn’t the time or place to cut them down,” Ron added. “He should still apologize though. His family was horrid to you. Blood status aside, that was a shitty thing for them to do, and he should have come to your aide, family be damned.”
“What did Malfoy do after that?” Ron asked, leaning forward to place his hand on Harry’s leg. Harry sighed and rolled his head to look at his best mate.
“Harry!” Andi came down, a small blue haired boy in her arms. Harry grinned and took Teddy from her, kissing all over his face. The baby laughed and attempted to grab Harry’s glasses from his face. Draco watched them, awkwardly standing in the doorway as the happy family reunited. Andi told Harry she’d see what she could get together for tea, but as she made to turn away, she finally noticed Draco standing awkwardly.
Not for the first time that day Harry started crying. He thought he’d lost every connection to the people he’d loved. They had left nothing tangible for him, except the love that protected him. But Draco… The man he’d been with for all of two days officially, had created this for him. Before they’d been official. Because he knew how much it would mean to Harry.
“Lucius had it made for me when he proposed.” The smile she sent her husband was intimate and soft and they quickly squeezed hands before Narcissa turned back to Harry.
warning: after christmas in the fic, things are going to get a little dark for a while. harry is NOT over what happened in the war and i want to discuss that in this fic. i'll try to tag the beginning of the chapter the PTSD flashbacks occur in and where you can pick up to ignore that PTSD stuff if you can't/don't want to deal with it.
“Come on, Malfoy,” Harry muttered as he slid from the booth, extending his hand to Malfoy. “Time to go.” In a rather childish gesture, Malfoy shook his head and refused to move. Sober Harry would have greatly objected to what slightly less sober Harry was about to do, but that was a problem for in the morning. Harry grabbed Malfoy’s arm and gently pulled him from the booth and placed his arm around Harry’s neck, Harry’s arm around Malfoy’s waist. Together, they made slow progress back towards Hogwarts.
“You can leave now. I’m awake.” She still didn’t move, and Harry rolled his eyes. Maybe breaking up with Ginny was a bad idea… Now he had been relegated to sibling status, which meant days like these.
To add onto the crazy, Tedd was becoming more of a nuisance. He had finally learned to crawl and was now doing so at hyper speed. Often. And now that he could crawl, he was trying to climb everything, though that was still a ways off, thank Merlin. Still, nothing seemed to stop him from getting into any and everything.
“Afterwards, we went out for a pint to avoid the party that was evidently going on in Gryffindor Tower. I, erm, got a little bit more wasted than intended, and there were some embarrassing confessions. After that, we started hanging out more and then he asked me to stay for Christmas and… Well, you know the rest of the story.” He shrugged nonchalantly, his face almost as red as the strawberries Fleur was using to make compote.
Shuddery gasps turned to deep breaths as Harry and Draco moved close, though not as close as they had been. Draco stayed curled in Draco's arms, breathing in the heady scent of leather and sweat. Harry whispered something into Jacob's hair, pulling him tighter against his chest.
“What’s the problem?” Draco said, turning a chair around to sit in it. Harry glared at him briefly before laying his forehead down on the cool wood of the table, his arms stretched out in front of him.
“Oh, yeah, forgot about that,” Harry said. He waved his hand, as if swatting a fly, and it disappeared.
The Bowtruckle scrambled down Hagrid’s beard and leapt across the table in a few bounds. Once she’d reached Harry, she climbed his shirt and his neck until she sat in his hair. Smiling, Harry watched her while Hagrid went on with his stories.
Malfoy wasn’t hard to find in his black Muggle clothes and silvery blonde hair. Harry quickly joined him, setting the glasses down.
… We’d have to go through the Ministry…” At Harry’s grimace, she sighed. She knew Harry would rather avoid the Ministry at all costs, so spell creation was out the window.
Harry readjusted his suit again as they walked up to the steps. He’d met Narcissa and Lucius before, but he didn’t really think they’d like to remember the times they’d almost been responsible for his death. As if he could read his mind, Draco grabbed his hand, squeezing it tightly. “It’ll be okay,” he reassured as he raised his hand to knock.
“Ready?” she asked quietly. He nodded and swiped the match against the box. The fire came without the usual tingle of magic that left his fingers but still it burned. He laid the match against the kindling, striking a few more to ensure the painting caught.
The students had all missed the sun, but there was an odd desperation to the eighth years’ need to be outside, surrounded by green and light. Of course, none of the younger students would understand how much time they’d spent in the dark last year. Between the darkness of the castle, of dungeons, or of forests, there never seemed to be enough light. Nevermind whatever other kinds of darkness preyed on them.
They fell silent again. Harry’s eyes drifted to stare forlornly at the limp pamphlets. Draco watched Harry, afraid of losing him again to whatever plagued his head again.
Several minutes passed before a highly polished door appeared to rise from the stone, brass fittings gleaming in the light of the torches along the wall. Smiling, Harry opened the door to find the same well-furnished room he’d taught an army of kids to fight in. The thought hit him like a bag of stones, but he left the door open and turned to face the curious students at the end of the hall. They hesitated until Harry beckoned the students to come into their temporary classroom.
“No, becoming an Animagus,” he said as he stared up into the leaves of the oak above him. “I dunno, the more I think about it, the more appealing it sounds…”
“I’m sorry whatever this is is going to cause undue strain, Potter,” Draco said stiffly, setting Teddy onto the floor next to him. Harry looked up, frowning at Draco.
, and not a supposed serious newspaper. He snorted at the irony and shook his head, handing the paper back to Andi.
“And?” Draco let his eyes drift from Andi to Harry, his heart aching at the thought of Harry suffering alone.
Even though he didn't have to, Harry took History of Magic again. Part of his wondered in Professor Binns even noticed there was a war.
“But, since you’re here, would you like to have some tea?” With a grin and a nod, Harry plopped back down into the chair. McGonagall moved to grab a teapot and boiled the water with a flick of her wrist, pulling cups out of nowhere and calling a tray of cookies up from the kitchens. The sounds were comforting, though short.
had let you announce it yourself.” Fleur agreed vehemently and started in on the respectability of the
She stood slowly, her robes unfurling gracefully. She pinned Harry with a look he couldn’t name, a look that was somewhere between disappointment and sadness, with a hint of that look she gave him before admonishing him.
“I haven’t seen you much at the social lunches, where have you been hiding?” he asks, obviously digging for information. He didn't even try to cover it up with any type of subtlety.
“I told them to just be there for him… Told them his favorite comfort foods post-episode, and that he needs to be held, whether he’ll admit it or not. He’s lost more than any of us because of Voldemort, and he just shoulders it.”
“I said, you were really brave that night… Mum told me she’d spared you because you told her I was safe. That was brave too, but you went out to face Voldemort and no one is ever going to compare to that, Harry. That’s like the bravest thing ever....”
Almost immediately, the door opened and a house elf ushered them inside. They walked through a long entrance hall, Draco leading the way to the dining room. To Harry’s surprise, it wasn’t just Lucius and Narcissa. Lucius’ brother, his wife, and their two children, and Blaise and Pansy were there.
There was a sharp pain in his chest and Harry swallowed hard. Draco did support his family, even though they were so obviously against him, his supposed boyfriend.
“Of course not, Potter.” Once Harry had caught up, McGonagall started walking again. He fell in step with her and they moved easily through the throngs of students flooding the halls for lunch.
“This is where I taught Dumbledore’s Army how to fight You-Know-Who and his followers,” Harry started. The fourth years settled onto the silk cushions while Harry stood in the same place he had three years ago, giving a rousing speech about rebellion. “It’s bigger than our classroom and is a lot safer, so it’ll be a great place to work on the actual spellwork.”
Students slowly rose from their seats, going to classes and study periods and wherever else they went after breakfast. Only Draco and Harry were left.
The sudden scraping of the bench startled Draco. When he looked up, Harry was already halfway down the Hall. Draco scrambled to grab his bag and shove his book in there, running to keep up with Harry. A loud door slam told Draco which direction he’d gone, and Draco ducked into the classroom after him.
“Troll! In the dungeon! Thought you ought to know…” he yelled before slumping against his boyfriend who shoved him off, laughing. The eighth years cackled at the impression, but the rest of the Great Hall went up in furious whispers.
“Do you know how to go about creating a spell?” He ran his hand through his hair, his mind racing through any and everything he could think of that might remove Walburga.
“And I’m not looking for your forgiveness either, Draco,” he rushed to say. He wanted to make this better, not receive empty forgiveness and platitudes. “Don’t just say you forgive me so we can move forward. It’s not fair to either of us to pretend this didn’t happen. That I don’t struggle with how to live after the war.”
“Ow…” Harry pouted, rubbing his head gently. The pain briefly blinded them both, but Draco held Harry close in case there was real danger.
. But she did miss her sister. There was a lot to fix, both with her sister and her son and his boyfriend. Lunch seemed a good a place as any to start.
this morning?” she asked tightly, shaking the offending paper. Harry watched a member of the Holyhead Harpies zip around the back page of the paper. He shook his head, genuinely confused about what could have happened to make her so angry, and grabbed the paper from her to read the headline.
In the quiet aftermath of their night, the despair they'd showed to the side came barreling in, nestling itself deep in their hearts. Their thoughts should have been only of the one in their arms, but instead, they were imagining what was happening across the pond with Voldemort.
“Look at Ronald, having more than the emotional range a teaspoon,” Harry teased, pulling out of the hug. Ron laughed and told him to fuck off. Their conversation was lighter after, but Harry felt so relieved Ron didn’t hate him for becoming a thing with Draco.
Tears sprung to his eyes as he thought about how close he was to constantly falling apart, that god-awful shitty feeling of dread sticking in his chest. They’d been in America for six months, but the idea of You-Know-Who still haunted them. Harry had managed to close off all mental access to Him and vice versa, but the nightmares weren’t His fault; the idea of Voldemort still haunted them, chased them across the open road.
Without asking his opinion, his friends set about breaking up the class schedules that worked best for them.
“That’s reassuring coming from my best Chaser,” he said, smirking faintly. The normality felt nice after being stuck in his head for too long.
“Thank you,” he murmured. “So much. This is perfect, and I love it.” Harry kissed him again for good measure. “I don’t think what I got you is going to stand up to this.” Draco laughed and told him he didn't care. He had too much stuff anyway.
The last thing Harry remembered as he fell asleep was watching his mother’s Bowtruckle, fast asleep in a small box of leaves and twigs.
Draco shifted closer to Harry, their leather jackets creaking together. The blond’s sunglasses dug into Harry’s back in a comforting kind of way, the rumble of the engine a lullaby to them both.
It took a little while longer to open up presents, and half that time to clean up. Tea and butterbeer and firewhiskey were served and passed around once the room resembled a living room again. Everyone drank, and the atmosphere was tinged with sadness, but the laughter helped a little. Harry and Draco drifted between groups, talking and laughing about this and that. They settled next to Ron and Hermione, Ginny, Luna and Neville and the seven of them chatted until the light left the room.
The class continued like this, spells shooting everywhere, Harry correcting students gently as they needed it. Only a few students managed to successfully disarm their opponent, but the whole class made a lot of progress anyway. The hour ended all too quickly and Harry dismissed them, telling them their next few classes would be here in the this room.
Draco told himself they’d return at the best opportunity and reclaim the Isles from Him, but he knew it was a sweet lie. There was no way to beat Him. If there was, then Harry Potter, the Boy Who Lived, would’ve figured it out. They would have figured it out.
“How is she?” Harry asked, moving to sit back down across from Ron. None of the werewolves should be treated like they are, but especially not the ones turned as a result of a war they should have never been involved in in the first place.
“We have to get ready for the day,” Draco mumbled as he snuggled closer to Harry. He squeezed Draco in response, not wanting this moment to end either. Today would be...a day. Unbidden, his mind raced ahead of him. This Christmas was a
“You are so like your father. He would be proud of you, Harry. I hope you know that,” McGonagall said as she looked at him over the edge of her glasses. “Come by my office after dinner and I’ll get you the paperwork. You may be like your father, but you are going to do this one thing properly. Good day, Mr. Potter.”
“Harry,” Andi said, looking over at the boy she’d claimed as her son. “I want you to know Sirius would be so proud of you today.” She watched tears form in his eyes at the mention of his godfather’s name and he turned to her slightly, twisting the dish towel in his hands.
The conversations resumed like nothing had happened. Pots and pans clattered and water boiled and laughter bubbled and vegetables were chopped. All of it was surprisingly comforting to Draco, though everything was essentially new to him.
He took a deep breath before he grinned. “Unfortunately, I will not be teaching you how to rebel against the system. Learn that in your own time. Instead, we’re going to start with
“Hey mate,” Ron said as he stepped in from the dining room. Ron wrapped his ridiculously long arms around Harry, holding his best friend close. They hugged for several long moments. When they pulled apart, Harry felt embarrassment creep over him.
“Hey, it’s better than Harry obsessing over him, let’s be honest. Come on, Ginevra, let’s leave them be.”
“Oh, is that all?” Harry said, thinking of how many times he’d have to start this over to get it right.
i think i'm approaching the end of this story!!! three or four chapters at the most, i think. and it probably won't have a perfect, tied up with a bow, ending. it'll be happy, and satisfactory, but i really want to stress that this isn't some one-and-done kind of thing for harry and the others who've been in the war. (i also may write a few more shorter stories in this universe)
Narcissa didn't say anything, and there an awkward silence. Andi was the first one to break it by inviting her sister to lunch. Narcissa hesitated. The welcoming invitation was obviously the last thing she had expected. She hadn’t talked to Andromeda is
“Sirius. He once told me that being an Animagus was a luxury he never would have thought of. He could wander the world and explore. He could change into a dog and think. Things were much simpler for him. And… That’s something I think is right for me too.” Harry swallowed a small piece of the rock cake quickly, letting it stop every other word from flowing out of him. Hagrid was easy to talk to. There wasn’t much judgement from him.
“He’s basically been taught that it’s his burden to bear,” Draco scoffed into his tea. “That’s why he snuck off at the battle to face Voldemort alone. He thought
sorry for the sobbing u may have done, but not sorry bc Damn. this is a good chapter. I'm really proud of it, of all of it, and of the story i've created (this isn't the end, i'm just really fucking proud)
The next day, Harry knocked over the umbrella stand in the entry hall as he came in from the store. He listened as it clattered to the floor, followed by blissful silence.
“You’re always welcome, Draco,” Andi whispered into his ear and Draco wrapped his arms around her tightly. She pulled away after a long moment, smiling brightly at him, promising something good for tea. Then she bustled her way into the kitchen, where Draco heard Kreacher ask what it is that was needed.
The flat was empty when he returned to the bookstore where he worked. Harry couldn’t figure out if he was happy or sad that Draco wasn’t there. He wandered into the kitchen to stare into the fridge, unsure if he was truly hungry. The color on the fridge made him do a double take. Their fridge was normally white, but this one was now covered in various colored post-its. Slowly, Harry walked towards the fridge to read the various notes. They were all in Draco’s hand.
,” Ron hissed. They fervently looked to the doorway. If they stayed gone for too long, however, Harry would come look for them so he could mope around other people and complain.
“Well I’m sorry you feel that way, Harry.” In Harry’s anger, he was deaf to the tears in Draco’s voice, the anger and pain on his face. All he could see was Draco walking to the door and grabbing his bag. He watched Draco’s back as he made his way out of the classroom, shutting the door quietly behind him. If he’d slammed the door, Harry might’ve felt better about their interaction. But listening to the latch click softly made Harry even angrier.
. Afterward, we rarely interacted. Passed each other in the halls, sure, saw each other at meals, of course. But then the Quidditch game… I’ve always been a bit weak for Quidditch players,” he said with a bit of a blush.
“You asked about my rings. Lucius had them made when his mother wouldn’t give him the family rings. I wasn’t her first choice, my sister Andromeda was as the eldest child. She would have rather had Bellatrix before me. I wouldn’t make an adequate wife, she thought. Too delicate to bear children, too delicate to run a house. Of course, she had very good reason to believe that.”
“Alright, let me just tell Andi we’re going out.” Draco watched him leave the room. After realizing he’d been staring at Potter’s ass, he came to his senses and ran upstairs to change out of his lounge clothes and into something worthy of actually being seen in.
The music swelled as Harry roared down the road, a grin lighting up their faces as they felt the power beneath them bunch and release as they opened up on the long road.
The sobs tore out of his chest like screams, lost in the roar of the thunder. His best friends. Gone. And Ron, the other Weasleys, dealing with it without him… Sometimes he felt like a coward, leaving. But the whole nation had looked to him. At twenty years old. For guidance. For help. To win a war that they’d already lost. But he
“I got one of each so you can pick your poison,” Harry said as he took a sip of the butterbeer. Malfoy didn’t respond as he quickly downed both shots of firewhiskey before taking a long gulp of the butterbeer. Frowning into his pint, Harry watched Malfoy. An hour stretched into two with Harry and Malfoy sitting together in companionable silence. Five pints of butterbeer later and Harry was ready to go, but Malfoy was still sulking into his seventh butterbeer. Rosmerta had capped them after Malfoy could barely stand to grab the next round of shots of firewhiskey for himself.
“My son, half a celebrity couple…” Narcissa shook her lightly, a bright smile on her face. Draco had forgotten the look, and he realized how much older his mother looked without it. The realization made him look around at the women standing in here with him, and he was surprised at how much older they
“The magic, I know. But do we actually know the effects muggle tech has on brooms? And, really, do you think it would? It’s just like a camera, just recording lengths of time rather than snapshots. And I think it’s time for the Wizarding world to move out of the Second World War.” Harry grabbed a chip from the fresh basket the waitress had just brought, using it to point at Draco. “The rest of the world has, kinda.”
He stalked out to the pitch, his grip white on the handle. He took a running start, jumping on the broom at the last second. Without much guidance, the broom jolted him upwards and Harry quickly disappeared into the clouds. Freezing wind stung his cheeks, but the upward ascent thrilled him.
The warmth of the kitchens warmed Harry against the November chill and he relaxed marginally. The house-elves tripped over themselves to being Harry some warm pumpkin juice. He sat at the table, suddenly exhausted. The party in the common room seemed less and less ideal the longer he sat there. So many people at once and forced interactions with everyone… maybe he’d pretend to fall asleep here and not go. Or better yet, he could go down to the Three Broomsticks for a butterbeer.
Neville opened his mouth to say something but Harry walked towards the door, ignoring his friends’ requests for him to come back.
Together, Harry and Draco walked down the stairs to join the Christmas chaos. Harry was surrounded by Weasleys the moment they reached the last step, and Draco wandered into the kitchen to see Andi and Teddy. While Draco knew the Weasleys were a package deal with Harry, he wasn’t quite ready for
“What’s wrong?” she asked, giving him that pitying look Molly often gave him when she thought he wasn’t looking. Wanting to ignore it and any conversation about feelings that may follow, Harry shrugged again before forcing a bite of the cardboard oatmeal into his mouth to avoid answering Hermione’s questions. She narrowed her eyes, and, for a moment resembled Professor McGonagall as she examined Harry. After searching his face for a moment, she said softly, “You know we’re all here for you, Harry.”
“I’m glad you’re helping, Ron. I know it would mean a lot to Remus.” A proud grin had spread across Harry’s face; his best mate was doing something all his own, outside of anyone’s shadow, which is what Ron had always wanted. And not only was it something all his own, but it was something that helped other people. People who were shunned because of something that happened
“Hey!” His indignant cry was still muffled by Ron’s shoulder and Harry could feel Ron laugh a little at him.
“Where am I needed the most?” she asked, wanting to break the awkward silence her presence had created.
i keep trying to finish this. but my friend, irene, keeps egging me on and multiplying ideas and what was supposed to be one and done is now three with possibly a little bit more
A house elf appeared at Lucius’ elbow and set a large tray of cookie dough on the table. With a snap, cookie cutters appeared with various sprinkles and icings. Harry raised an eyebrow, but Draco started telling the story of how his grandmother teaches them all how to make cookies each Christmas as a way to teach them they weren’t above getting their hands dirty from time to time. Of course, that didn’t really stop everyone from being dressed to the nines. Like they couldn’t be bothered to dress down to make
Though neither of them had had an excessive amount, they still leaned into each other to walk, the alcohol destroying one more little barrier. Draco let his thoughts run away with him as they walked, thinking about Harry dragging him back to his room and using his deft fingers to… He groaned inwardly at the thought. Or, he
Molly had knitted him a tiny jumper, one that he could grow into over the next year or so. Charlie got him one of the tiny dragons Harry had received during the Triwizard Tournament. It blew steam from its nose and breathed tiny sparks of light rather than fire. After a few minutes of playing, it curled up next to Teddy’s leg and promptly fell asleep. Hermione had gotten him some muggle books for him to grow into, and Ron had thrown in a few wizarding classics as well. Harry and Andi thanked everyone while Teddy went back to playing with the little dragon. Harry moved to sit next to Draco on the couch, wrapping his arm around the blond’s shoulder.
Which is why Harry was running late to meet his friends after class. He and Malfoy had been enjoying a snack in the kitchen when Harry had remembered the time. Malfoy made some mention of maybe seeing him at Hogsmeade later anyway and they parted ways. As he left the kitchens, one of his students had stopped to ask him for help and… Well, he couldn’t tell her no. He’d spent thirty minutes helping her with her wand movements before sprinting out of Hogwarts and down the front walk.
“You aren’t going to threaten me or--or fight me? Or even insult me?” He sounded sincerely confused, as if he wanted Harry’s anger to be directed towards him. Harry gave a heavy sigh and turned around to face Malfoy. The Slytherin stood up, looking like he was ready to fight. But there was hesitation in his posture because there was already defeat on Harry’s face.
Harry thanked him again and wandered his way back up to Hogwarts. He crawled into his bed that night and he smiled as he drifted off to sleep. For the first time in his life, he felt like he knew his family. Not just as the legends everyone thinks they are, but as the people they were.
Afternoon bled into night, and people slowly bade their goodnights and Flooed home. Molly and Arthur left first, claiming old age and long days. The rest of the Weasley clan followed shortly after. McGonagall said something about making sure the house elves got their presents before night’s end and left with Narcissa when Andi went to bed. Ginny, Neville, and Luna left together, caught up in some conversation, too busy to hear everyone bid them good night.
“I promise Harry, the war is over. It’s been almost a year now…” Neville piped up, moving away from the group. Harry’s eyes locked on him, and there was a scar on his forehead (
you defend them. You know what they say is wrong! Blood politics killed people, including my parents! So how fucking dare you sit by and let them say that, and then
Harry didn’t notice Dean and Seamus leave to get supplies for their class, or Neville and Luna leave discussing syllabi excitedly, or Hermione Apparating without a goodbye to tell Ron the news.
Laughter won out and Harry doubled over, snorting. Draco snatched them from his hands, his face cherry red.
Hermione sat next across from him, nibbling on toast as she flicked through the pages of the Prophet. Absently, she asked, “Are you excited to play again?”
History of Magic was still as dull as he remembered. Even though History of Magic (the parts that didn't include goblin wars) had played a large part of his battle against You-Know-Who, he still couldn’t bring himself to care.
Seamus was late for breakfast the next morning, and the eighth years were gathered in a clump at what was previously the Gryffindor table looking a little worried. Seamus hadn’t missed a meal since they’d returned to Hogwarts for fear of them being taken away without reason, leftover from the cruel detentions he’d suffered last year.
“Harry. You’ve been keeping things from me again.” Draco’s tone wasn’t judgmental, simply matter-of-fact. Harry fidgeted in his seat for a moment, before meeting Draco’s eyes.
The conversation came to a halt, though, so Harry had to swallow quickly before it became too awkward. “I came to see you because… Well, I wanted to ask you about my mum and dad. And Sirius. And Remus!”
“Tell me again what happened, Harry,” Hermione said. She leaned into Harry’s shoulder, trying her best to comfort him when she just wanted to laugh at his behaviour. They were twenty-two for Merlin’s sake.
“Tonight, we acknowledge the old while celebrating the new. All proceeds from tonight will be given to the R.J. Lupin Foundation for the Welfare of Werewolves. Please, enjoy the exhibit!” Draco said, raising his glass. Social convention required everyone to do the same, even though they weren’t sure what they were toasting to. Most of them wanted to be offended but they knew the Malfoys would cause them many more problems if they spoke against them, especially Draco.
“And you didn’t get a detention? Typical Potter.” They laughed, real laughs, as they separated, grabbing their bags from the nearby tree.
“What was the rebellion like at Hogwarts?” Lucy Hornswallow asked excitedly, leaning forward. Neville hesitated and looked over at Harry. He really wasn’t used to the hero treatment, but Harry gave him a small nod to continue. Neville knew more than Harry did, of course.
“Don’t look at me like that! You don’t know how I feel! You’re just standing there and looking at me, pretending that understand, BUT YOU CAN’T! NO ONE CAN!”
The first Quidditch game quickly snuck up on everyone. It was the first game since the war, and energy thrummed through the school. Most of it was excitement because it was the first real game in a long, long time. Some of it was nerves, mostly on the players' side. But nerves were the last thing on Harry’s mind. Even with the first match on the horizon, he couldn’t make himself feel even a fraction of the excitement he used to feel before games. He enjoyed flying, and he enjoyed the wind on his face as he sought the Snitch, but the game itself was rather bland to him at the moment. Winning didn't matter to him, though he knew it mattered to his teammates.
“Harry, will you hand me a fresh pot of ink? Weaselbee has stolen mine because she forgot to bring a backup,” Draco said lazily, his paper floating above his head as he checked his essay for errors. Harry, who’d been half asleep laying on Draco, grumbled and turned onto his side. He nonverbally
Six years, they’d stayed and fought. Six years of continuous war, hiding and fighting, and dodging spells and bullets alike. When they’d realized Voldemort couldn’t be defeated, that he would eventually absorb the rest of the Isles, even the Boy Who Lived had fled.
“Just meet here next time, there’s no need to parade through the school,” he said with a grin as the students filed out of the room. Once the last student had closed the door, Harry turned around and let out a sigh. He remembered vividly what the first meeting had been like, the sense of rebellion and accomplishment that followed. Now there was just an ache while he assessed where the students could improve.
The next morning, the boys went into town for breakfast. A greasy spoon, somewhere no one could find them, recognize them. They spent their day pretending to be normal, to be happy, to be without the crushing weight of expectations.
Harry’s team had been debating the outcome of the match as they entered the Great Hall. Dean had proudly crowed Gryffindor would take the Cup, but of course Ginny couldn’t let a good rib like that go to waste.
Harry stared at the ashes at his feet, a grin starting to spread across his face. It was the first time he’d really smiled in what felt like years. She was finally
The kiss was tender, but desperate. Draco could feel Harry holding back, but he’d been waiting too long for this. Harry could be hesitant later. He nipped at the Chosen One’s lip, licking into his mouth. Harry felt Draco grin against his mouth when he moaned, moving his hands to the blond’s hips. When Draco bucked up against, Harry smirked like a tosser and pulled back. He was breathing heavily, his lips slightly swollen, and he looked gorgeous in the low light of the alley. He could only stare at him for a minute, unable to believe Harry Potter just kissed him. Someone he used to hate with all of his being. Just
Taking a deep breath to steel himself, Harry made his way into the Hall. Some of his students waved at him, fellow Quidditch players calling out hellos. He did his best to return them, but he was soon so focused on Draco that he didn’t notice anyone else.
Hermione gladly claimed fifth and seventh years, excited to teach everything she knew on the Dark Arts. She took O.W.L.s and N.E.W.T.s seriously, and no one could help them better than Hermione.
He and Harry hurried through the corridors, making their way for the side entrance near the Herbology labs. The less people that saw them, the better. Harry hated the limelight, and he hated it even more right now. As they made their way past the labs, Draco talked about random things as he and Harry. He hoped that mundane things like how much Charms work he had to do before the term was over would help ground Harry. He hadn’t spoken yet, but his tight grip on Draco’s hand hadn’t lessened either.
“Come on, you can do better than that!” a deep voice called out. A sharp red light and a cackle followed it. Pain hit Harry squarely in the chest and grief consumed him briefly.
“And she’s right. But even she’d say that fear of his name is just as big as the fear of You-Know-Who himself. He made them that way. He knew what he was doing when he made his name a Taboo…” Harry trailed off, unable to stop his mind from spiraling through the events of that lead up to that night at Hogwarts.
“A gap year is used for that exact purpose, Potter,” Draco drawled with a fond roll of his eyes. Harry looked at Draco, pulling his arms into to make a pillow for his head.
. His thoughts wandered to Christmas plans as he meandered through the hall. A few people stopped to talk to him, students and classmates, before moving onto their own compartments.
“Yes dear, magic paint. It withstands years of dust and living and can only be covered by more magic paint. With all the bad in this house, you’ll need it.”
Across the hall, the younger students looked confused. Was there really a troll in the dungeon or was it an inside joke? When should they panic? As if sensing their confusion, McGonagall stood. Seamus only grinned in the face of her withering stare.
“Harry, you don’t understand,” Draco pleaded, looking at Harry with what he hopes is the right expression of regret and pleading.
Harry put Teddy into his high chair, glancing back at Draco, but he didn’t move. He and Andi stepped into the hallway to discuss whatever had Andi so riled up.
“She’s as good as she can be. The transformations are hard on her, obviously. But she’s tough, and she’s doing her best to not let it ruin her life. I’m taking notes from your dad’s book and starting the process of becoming an Animagus.”
Between Quidditch, teaching, and their own classes, Harry and his mates didn't have a lot of time to study. Any time they did find, they couldn’t focus anywhere in the castle. But being an eighth year had its perks. Hogsmeade visits were just one, but they were the
“Yeah, yeah, love you too. See you Wednesday,” Harry grumbled as he shuffled out the door. The latch clicked back into place and Hermione dissolved into giggles almost immediately.
“Magic or muggle?” Andi held an odd little contraption in her hand and wanting to avoid embarrassment, he almost opted for magic. But Harry’s words about feeling more accomplished when doing things the muggle way echoed back in head. Grumbling, he took the potato peeler from Andi and leaned over the pan they were using to catch the peels; Andi walked him through the basics and off they went.
As the morning slowly unfolded, Draco was finding himself further and further out of his element. Having a literal hand in the preparation of the meal was foreign. The kind, easy, mindless chatter was new but nice. Molly talked to Fleur about the preparations for a baby, Andi told stories about everything new with Teddy, and Fleur excitedly talked about her work with Bill and how they were settling into their new house.
Teddy helped pick out a myriad of decorations, and often helped settle arguments between Draco and Harry. Mostly by pointing and cooing. It was a surprisingly effect way to handle disagreements, but they were quickly discovering Teddy had a loyalty issue.
Harry didn't say anything. Draco had always been torn between family and what’s right because, for him, they contradicted each other. But if he truly cared about Harry, wouldn’t he have said something? He wouldn’t take him to meet the Malfoys officially if he didn't care, but how deep did his feelings run? Were they going to get married?
As the crowd dispersed to talk in whispers about what just happened, Harry wandered to the edge of the room, reeling. He leaned against the wall, struggling to process what all Draco had just said.
“The Snitch was sitting straight in front of me, just bobbing up and down merrily. I was wondering when he’d notice it, but it wasn’t a second later that he’d noticed it. I knew the game was over then. He sped towards it, and I’m terrified he’s going to slam into me because the Firebolt is
He trudged his way back up to the school. He squinted into the sun, holding up his hand to block it out. It told him that it was roughly lunch time. He hoped Draco and his friends would be in the Great Hall...
Surprisingly, there was no chatter about what happened in the hallway, though the second years did eye him warily as they walked past. The tension eased from Harry’s friends and the mood seemed to return to a semi-normal. Bad jokes and puns, threats of hexing, and impersonations of least and most favourite teachers. There were pieces of food thrown with furtive glances to the Head Table, the veterans still afraid of McGonagall.
The Alley was full of last minute shoppers, so Harry and Draco disguised themselves with a slight glamour, hoping to avoid… well, anyone. Of course, being unsupervised meant they could do some searching of their own. And there was some searching… There were searching hands and two boys searching for places to hide and reporters searching for more juicy gossip on the Wizarding World’s hottest new couple.
After dinner, Draco made his way into the kitchen for some tea, only to see Harry washing dishes by hand. He stood there for a moment, just watching.
“Harry, do you remember what day it is?” she asked gently as she came to stand a few feet away from him. She’d become an expert at this kind of thing, between Harry and the Weasleys and her own nightmares, she knew exactly what he needed.
“Malfoy, those days are over. I’m too bloody tired to fuel our rivalry, or whatever this was.” It was the first civil thing Harry had said to Malfoy in Merlin knows how long.
journalist to tell the real story…” Neville said, drawing them back to the moment. He gave Harry a small smirk at the idea of there being a
’d the ink pot, holding it above his head with a mumbled “here,” all without opening his eyes or leaving his very comfortable pillow of Draco’s stomach.
Hermione stepped towards Harry slowly, the rest of his friends exchanging worried looks behind her. She held her hands out to show she meant no harm, her brow furrowed in concern for him. Harry shook his head, confused. Hermione looked different…
While he sat above the game, circling lazily, Harry couldn’t tell if he wanted to catch the Snitch quickly or drag the game out as long as he could. His teammates would appreciate a nice, long game, so he continued to absently scan for the Snitch, drifting closer to the Ravenclaw section of the stands.
Harry nodded, chewing his lip. The idea of hosting it at Grimmauld Place was… daunting. Mostly because there hadn’t been that many people in his house ever. And the holidays were bound to be hectic anyway. It was the first Christmas since the war. People wanted it to be extravagant because the war was over, but they also wanted a chance to mourn. The losses were going to be felt more keenly than most days. Mrs. Weasley may be thankful for the distraction, or for the ability to mourn those she lost without worrying about having Christmas.
Harry stalked through the castle, his thoughts dogging him the whole way. His feet carried him of their own accord, and suddenly he found himself standing in front a picture of a bowl of fruit. The pear giggled as Harry tickled it and the door swung open to reveal the warmth of the Hogwarts’ kitchen within. Harry stared at the entrance, confused as to why he brought himself here.
With exams quickly approaching, Harry had to decide on an exam for his students. A practical felt like the easiest way to go about it. He’d stage it much like the one he’d done for his O.W.L.s. The students had come a long way since he’d started teaching in the old D.A. room, and he was really proud of them. He just didn’t want to grade papers while also studying for his N.E.W.T.s.
Staccato drum beats sounded from somewhere outside as Harry yanked Draco close. They stumbled with the change of pace as they dragged out a heavy, heady kiss. Tongues languidly intertwined as their hands twisted in clothing, desperate to keep the other close.
. So, Harry ignored Malfoy’s baleful glare in lieu of scarfing down the amazing food in front of him.
No time at all seemed to pass, the kisses slow and unhurried, their limbs heavy with peace for the first time in… too many years to count.
“FILTH! BLOOD TRAITORS IN MY ANCESTRAL HOME!” she shrieked as Harry dropped a book in the hall, startling the curtains open. Cursing, he picked the book up, clutching it in his left hand. Mrs. Black continued to shriek about the nature of the people living in her home and Harry had had enough. All through the renovations, she’d screamed and shrieked until Harry cast
, from one of the most brutal Dark Wizards of our time, Harry. You are a hero, whether you believe it or not.” With a flash of her green robes she was in the fireplace and the words
The lunchtime chatter was light and easy, with Harry and Draco making jokes about the article, Andi cooing over Teddy and his antics, and Narcissa attempting to adapt to the informal, mostly muggle dining.
“What’s so funny?” Ron asked when he entered the kitchen again. Hermione was clutching her stomach with one hand, leaning against the counter with the other. When she looked up at him, he could see tears in her eyes.
The end of winter slowly faded into spring, and it was welcomed by students and teachers alike. The air warmed and became sweet with the smell of flowers and fresh grass. The sun shone brightly, like it was proud of its return, and no one was going to tell it otherwise. Between classes, the students could be found lounging in the sun or playing in the shallows of the lake. The eighth years were studying, holding office hours for Defense a few feet away from their friends, and taking naps under the sun during their breaks.
Harry sat behind his godson, showing him how to rip the paper off. Once he’d been shown, Teddy tore off the paper excitedly, needing little help. He cared little for what was in the presents, however, and instead had fun making a mess and a lot of noise with the paper.
Instead of responding, Malfoy just nodded at the mural standing in front of him. It was a mural Harry remembered someone telling him Luna had done a few weeks ago. In typical Luna fashion, she had gotten to the heart of most survivor’s fears and poignantly reassured them. A large black and green cloud grew off to the left of the mural, but the familiar wands at the bottom cast a collective Lumos and forced the cloud back. Harry watched it repeat a few times before he noticed the black-outlined blue words surrounding the right edge.
The next morning at breakfast, Harry settled himself between Neville and Seamus. Wary looks were exchanged over his head, but he ignored them in favor of smiling at his boyfriend. He talked about Quidditch and anything else written about in the morning
“Gotcha!” Harry said as scooped the small boy into his arms. After a brief standoff with the tiny monster, the pants were removed from his head. The monster was then promptly released to wreak havoc elsewhere, and Harry turned to Draco with the pants in his hands, an eyebrow raised.
Yet another death report had filtered through that morning. More Weasleys. Pansy. Blaise. All gone. Grief heavy in both their hearts, they’d wandered to a pub where an overly friendly American had offered them a pint to ease their pain. They’d been there, they said. They said they knew war when they saw it, and Harry and Draco looked like they needed a drink, or ten.
“Who are you talking to Harry?” a dreamy voice asked. Luna sank down next to Harry, who said, “Myself.” She sat her books beside her, obviously expecting to be here a while. Her eyes wandered up and down the hall, and she let silence settle between the two.
“The muggle technology would interfere with--” Draco started with an exasperated tone. How often did they have to over this?
Narcissa, Lucius, and Draco stepped onto a platform at the center of the castle where the majority of the attendees were gathered. They quietly garnered everyone’s attention, and Harry wandered in from the adjacent room. He leaned against the door frame, getting ready to zone out of one of Narcissa’s boring speeches.
“You mean theory? Well, it’s not my expertise, but I try to help them figure out the feelings behind their spellwork. As much as I hate to admit it, Bellatrix was right. To cast Cruciatus, you had to mean it… Well, after I’d figured that out, other spells became much easier when I focused on their intent,” Harry said with a slight shrug as if understanding magical theory was easy. And he’d taught it to fourth years. Like it was easy.
Harry walked into the dining room with Ron in tow and was delighted to see the spell had worked. There was enough room for people in the dining room now, both for the food and the people. Around the table sat the Weasleys, Fleur, Hermione and her parents, Draco and his mum, Andi and Teddy, Neville and his gran, Luna and her dad, Professor McGonagall, who had actually accepted his invitation, and Harry himself. Twenty-two people were in his house, the biggest group it’d held since the last time it was Order headquarters. There were very obvious gaps, of course. No chair was left open, but they were felt nonetheless. Fred. Remus. Tonks. Ted. Sirius. Mad-Eye Moody. Harry felt the pain in his chest at those who were missing, but it was eased a little by all those still here.
to my face! Saying how my mother never deserved my father, how a good pureblood like him shouldn’t have married a dirty girl like her!” he shouted as he walked down the drive. Oh, he wanted to so badly turn and spit these words through his teeth and jab his finger into Draco’s chest. But he needed to get away
“Like I need you to buy drinks for me, Potter,” Malfoy sneered, but even he seemed to notice it was weaker than it had been. Harry laughed good-naturedly and pulled up so the two were walking in step together.
Harry started to leave, weaving through the crowd as inconspicuous as he could be. He wanted to go out and get pissed and do something reckless.
“Alrigh’, Harry?” he asked, settling rock cakes down in front of Harry. Fang settled his head into Harry’s lap, and Harry’s hand started scratching his ears immediately.
me, instead of letting me find out like everyone else.” She looked sad, knowing her son was drawing away from her. He had every right to, after the events of the last few years. But that didn’t mean it hurt less.
?” Harry gave a sheepish grin, rubbing the back of his head awkwardly. “My, my, Potter, have a little crush did we?”
“No, I mean it! In the end, Sirius had the entire Black fortune which he left to me, his half blood godson from a dirty marriage. But,” he said, “his family didn't love him like yours does. They won’t say
“Harry wants to become a dog, apparently,” Hermione said with a fond roll of her eyes. They dissolved into bickering until a student of Harry’s walked up and timidly asked for help with his counter-curses. With an easy smile, Harry stood and walked a few feet away with the student. A dummy was conjured from the Room and they set about practicing.
Before, he’d been in the public eye at every turn, but he’d ignored what they said because there were bigger things to battle against. Now that the war was over, he was having a minor identity crisis. He’d rather everyone believe he was still an enemy of the Ministry than believe he’s this chosen hero.
“After, we just started hanging out more. Meals, studying in the library, homework help. The usual stuff. But when we were heading home for the holidays, I invited him to Christmas. I knew his family probably wasn’t the greatest right now, and so I offered him an escape from that if he wanted. Everything was great! We did the shopping and the decorating and the caring for Teddy. It was great. We went out for a pint after an incident with Teddy stealing unmentionables and…that’s when things escalated a bit more. Obviously, you saw the
With both of them so focused on their individual tasks, they didn't see Hermione and Ginny poke their heads in.
The Chosen One they want me to be. I just… I did what was I was made to do. Not because destiny or whatever chose me, but because there was someone else controlling the strings...” He trailed off, thoroughly confused about how he saw himself now.
“Blood politics has no place at a family dinner, especially when they bring up outdated gossip in order to force him from their home. I refuse to stand by their belief in an outdated gatekeeping system, especially when it means to keep me from my boyfriend, to keep me from “marrying dirty,” whatever that means. I renounce my family’s passing of laws to keep others the old system has deemed to be less than out of our society.”
Once everyone has quieted down a little, Narcissa cast a Sonorous charm, giving a smile that sparkled like diamonds.
All of these places were important to Harry, for various reasons. Some he avoided. Others seemed to call out to him, wanting to return him to a simpler time when You-Know-Who had simply been a bad dream to children.
They fled the little white church to find a local pub for a few drinks. They only had eyes for each other, happiness blotting out, briefly, their incessant pain. Tomorrow they’d head out to see the Grand Canyon and they wouldn’t listen to the underground radio. They were determined to be a little bit happy, if only for a little while.
this is a Long Chapter for me. it took a few days to put together, and I'm honestly surprised at how long it is (it is the longest chapter so far) but there was so much i wanted to fit in!!!
“Me too,” is all Harry said. He ended up not going to the Three Broomsticks that night. Instead, he and Malfoy went to The Hog’s Head Inn and had a pint, talking in hushed voices about anything and everything like old friends. With his friends, he felt like he had to be fine all the time. Being open with Malfoy was… easy.
“We spent so much time in our fifth year in there, and then again when the war started. Itt was a safe space. A base. Home. But now it won’t even open its doors when it feels like we need that place more than ever. It’s...weird,” she said again.
“Welcome, everyone, to the 318th annual Malfoy charity gala!” she called over everyone’s head. “We’re so glad to see everyone here, especially in the wake of this past year. I won’t hold your attention any longer, though. This year, my son will be introducing the new exhibit he’s been hiding from everyone!”
chose Harry. The anger bubbled into a full-on boil and he spun on his heel and stalked back to stand in front of his… Draco. He jabbed his finger into his chest, spitting his next words through his teeth.
The conversation petered out after that, both of them lost in their own thoughts as they watched Harry play with Teddy. All of his pain and sadness seemed to disappear when he was with his godson, the smile of the baby enough to make his heart feel a little lighter, even if for just a moment.
He slowed his pace as he reached the far end of Hogsmeade to admire the murals that had been painted on the long wall following his path into Hogsmeade. The familiar faces and words on it brought him a small measure of comfort, and he smiled. But as he reached the end of it, he noticed an interesting new addition with a familiar blond standing in front of it.
“Oh, mate, I’m sorry,” Ron said, pulling Harry into a sideways hug on the couch. Hermione leaned into his other side, rubbing his arm.
” Harry spun on his heel again and continued on down the long drive. At the gates of the Manor, Draco watched Harry Disapparate.
“Should we do this by oldest or youngest?” Molly asked, looking over to Andi who eyed Teddy, who’d discovered the wrapping paper made noise.
“Mrs. Malfoy, those rings are gorgeous,” Harry said in his conversational tone, the one he reserved for boring meetings. “I’ve never seen anything like it.”
Added about 700 more words and altered one scene completely. This notification chapter will be deleted 3/29/21!
“This looks different…” Draco commented. He’d only been there once before, when he was younger, but he remembered it being much more cloying and dark. But it was light and spacious and it felt like a home. Maybe that was all the kids’ toys scattered about, or the worn couch, or the warm fire. Whatever it was, Draco loved it.
“Meeting up with a mate, Rosmerta,” he said. The word felt weird to say, but it was true. He and Malfoy were mates, at the most. He felt that if he’d said “friend,” Malfoy would have come over to hex Harry before leaving in a dramatic scene. Harry chuckled to himself at the image before bewitching the glasses the float ahead of him.
3/4/19: hello this story is just getting bigger and bigger. i'm almost finished editing!! maybe i'll eventually get back to the real story!! i'm slowly figuring out the next real chapter.
He expected the Entrance Hall to be empty, but Malfoy still stood where Harry had left him, looking as if he’d been Confounded. There was a split second where Harry debated going up behind him and whispering “boo.” But they were all still jumpy, Malfoy arguably most of all, so Harry slipped off the Cloak and made his presence known.
“Sometimes I forget,” he whispered when Harry couldn’t find anything to say. “I forget he’s not here anymore, he’s never coming back, that I
The next morning, just hours after the sun had made its way over the horizon, Draco and Harry readied their motorcycle, ready to head out once again.
“Have a biscuit, Potter,” she said with a gleam in her eye that Harry equated to a smirk. With a small smile, he pulled off the lid and took a biscuit while McGonagall pulled out what looked like an instruction sheet.
“It’s hard to know where to start… I mean, yer mum was always kind. She would come see me when she had found an animal, magical or not, tha’ needed caretaking. Lily always came by to check on ‘em, and help to care for ‘em. Yeh get yer love fer the thestrals from ‘er.” Hagrid stood again, looking through the various baskets in his hut before finding a small twig that clambered onto Hagrid’s beard. “This is a Bowtruckle Lily found with damaged limbs. She helped me care for ‘er, even though she got no credit from it.”
Harry shifted his weight uncomfortably. He wasn’t sure where this was going, but he wished he was back in the dining room of French speakers.
Harry liked to keep his spring classes shorter. The students had improved immensely over the year and with all the stress of the upcoming finals and general end of the year things, so he reviewed for the first forty minutes of class and left them the last fifty minutes to play games using the spells they’d learned.
“If you’ll excuse me.” Harry’s words as sharp and terse as he rises from his chair. His steps are long and quick, and before long, he reaches the front door. All semblance of manners flew out the door with him and his last fuck, and he let the heavy oak door
hi!! it's been a while!! between final exams, going home and working over christmas, and rushing for a sorority like a week after i got back to school, i've been a little busy!! also, this chapter is a fucking monster for me. it's like 3.6, almost 3.7k and it took for fucking ever to figure out HOW i was going to get to the end of the chapter and kinda what i wanted to happen.
After making their way back to the motel, Harry and Draco laid on the bed, thinking. Faint music meandered in through the window, promising something slow and sweet and good, though temporary.
With an inward sigh, Harry started, “As it so happens, I am struggling with memories of the war and it’s been making it pretty hard to focus on much of anything really. I’ve mostly laid in my bed with the curtains drawn when no one is in the room. If there are people there, I’m hiding in Firenze’s classroom or the actual Forest. You see, I’m also avoiding human interaction so I can pretend there’s nothing wrong with because I am apparently a broody person.” The sarcastic answer rolled off his tongue without second thought. Harry was astonished at himself, and a little terrified. This was the second time in his life that he had given serious lip to McGonagall, and he wasn’t sure if he’d survive a second attempt. He watched her face carefully, his face a blank mask. He wasn’t even sure what emotion it was supposed to be displaying anyway.
chosen. By whatever fluke of nature, Voldemort chose you first. Your mother’s love protected you in a way none of us could have imagined. Everything after… Well, it seems you have a little Felix Felicis in your veins, Potter, but--”
“Are you really upset that I’ve not been open with you?” Joking aside, anxiety seeped into Harry’s voice. Pale gray-blue eyes stared at him for a minute, mulling over how he felt about Harry’s lack of sharing. It hurt, sure, but it’s not like Draco was always an open book with him either.
When Harry woke up the second time, he could feel how raw his throat was and how sore his body was. His memories slowly came back. First the dream, then Draco running in, Draco holding him while he cried, Draco comforting him and listening to him…
Harry’s eyes widened as Hagrid talked. He’d known Remus was a werewolf? But the more Harry thought, the more it made sense for Hagrid not to care. People thought of Remus and Hagrid the same, as if they were less than.
“...Oh, well, in that case…” Harry stood, opened his mouth to say something else then shut it again. He turned awkwardly to walk from her office before McGonagall spoke again.
“It’s only Christmas Eve, Harry,” Draco whispered back with a roll of his eyes. There wouldn’t be people over until Christmas Day.
. He and the others often went down to the little village once classes were finished, so they could study away from the sometimes stifling air of Hogwarts. With most of them being a professor of at least one Defense class, their students pestered them almost constantly.
It wasn’t until they reached the dining room that Harry seemed to brighten a little. The sight of the rest of the family, and food, lightened his spirits. He scooped Teddy into his arms, covering him with kisses and holding him close. Draco had sat down for a much needed cup of tea, which he was now just staring into. He didn’t see Andi come in through the front door, her face twisted into a scowl. She held
He’d watched too many people he loved die. Once Voldemort had taken over Ireland, Harry and Draco had called it quits and caught the next plane out of the country with charmed papers to get through customs. Sirius’ motorcycle had made it easily to the States in Harry’s bag, undetectably small in his bag, warded against muggle tech.
“Good luck,” Draco said, waving away his mother and aunt with Teddy. They went their separate directions, and the very long shopping trip began.
“Did you ever think of potions?” Hermione cut him off and Harry opened and closed his mouth quickly, brows drawing together. Then his face split into a grin and he hugged her.
As the effects of their night at the pub, their kisses grew more urgent and desperate. Whimpers and moans filled the cheap motel room as Harry and Draco dragged each other impossibly closer until there was nothing to separate them anymore.
“It’s very romantic. How… How did you guys meet?” Harry asked awkwardly. This was not a topic he really wanted to discuss, but now he’d backed himself into a corner.
Today was one such day. He’d been pacing in front of the Room of Requirement, asking it for a place to escape for a little while. The door never showed and Harry sighed, looking at the ceiling. After the Fiendfyre, he understood why the room was reluctant to let him enter.
“Removes the previous owner’s influence in one coat,” he murmured, readjusting Teddy on his hip. “It sounds like a really good idea.”
Harry bade them a good night and continued meandering. The art was interesting, but overall, the night was a drag. He missed Draco being with him at these things. They could make snide jokes together and occasionally sneak off to make out in some closet. Merlin, he missed Draco.
“Ready?” he asked in a low voice. Draco nodded, trying to keep his mouth from falling open. Together, they walked into the evening air, ambling towards a pub a couple of blocks over. Harry made comments about some of his favourite Muggle places to go for fish and chips, coffee, a nice lunch.
i think one or two more chapters before this fic is done!!! obvs this isn't the end of the series, i plan to continue more in a few one shot or short chapter fics!!!! i can't believe this is the first multi chapter fic i will have finished!
Outwardly, everything was fine. As hard as Harry tried to open up to Draco, he still kept locking up the bigger things. Like not saying that he was afraid of losing Draco. He was afraid to go somewhere else because it might be exactly what he wants and he may never come home. He was afraid that he was useless now that the war was over and he was a war hero instead of a rebel. He was afraid You-Know-Who could come back and they’d ask him to do the same things all over again…
“Thanks for not hating me,” Malfoy said in between a poorly contained laugh. Harry grinned and looked at his ex-enemy and said, “Thanks for not always being an asshole.”
“You played well today,” Malfoy mumbled. Harry startled slightly at the words and asked the Slytherin to repeat his words. When he did, Harry was still surprised.
The two of them stared at each other, shocked. But Harry wasn’t going to try and cover up what he said, or make excuses. He really did want Draco over for Christmas.
Exploration was mostly a bad idea, too. Parts of the castle were off limits to students, the magical residue from the Battle causing problems. The castle was healing too. So Harry decided it was best not to provoke the castle by roaming around, picking at healing wounds. So, the only area that held a tiny bit of interest was the kitchens.
The banter continued merrily as the sun climbed higher and higher, and Harry dozed lightly on his boyfriend. This was nice. It was something he never go to enjoy. The spring was always filled with Voldemort’s latest plot, the latest schemes from Harry and the gang, and never ending amounts of sadness and grief. Being able to just exist and enjoy the nice weather was a balm to Harry’s ragged soul. Days like these made it harder to remember that he was so warn torn.
“They’re going to look at me and see a hero. But, Professor, I’m not. Despite everything I’ve done, I’m
They stopped in the dining room and Draco frowned. The table in front of him could barely fit eight people, let alone the twenty-plus that would be here for Christmas… As if reading his thoughts, Harry said, “We did an expanding charm on the dining room so it’ll expand to fit as many people as needed. It’ll come really in handy for Christmas Dinner. And the paint…”
“And the tables aren’t separated anymore! Everyone sits where they want now. So, Luna sits with us every day at meals now, and we chose a random table every meal. The other students are doing the same. I honestly don’t think the first years know how drastically different Hogwarts used to be.”
“I am thinking about it, at least a little,” he admitted. Hermione was pulling an apple from the covered basket.
“It’s your fault I was woken so unceremoniously,” Draco said with a roll of his eyes, putting his palm against Harry’s face to push him away. They struggled for a few minutes, Draco trying to keep Harry as far away as he could before he relented and let Harry kiss him.
The Quidditch pitch provided an excuse to be close and friendly without anyone judging them too harshly. Of course, they were never alone, but it was a start. Alongside their regular, single team practices, Harry and the other captains organized small scrimmages against each other for extra practice. It had been years since most of them had flown in something other than battle formations. They needed the most practice they could get.
“So how did you two end up in this position?” Fleur asked as she checked the pudding in the oven again. She’d moved onto to the other desserts, and somehow still managed to remember exactly what she was doing and never wasted a moment. Draco hesitated to tell the tale because it did involve some embarrassing stories on his part… But he might have to start getting good at it if the Wizarding World does become invested in his relationship.
“There’s one in here… Ah! Here it is!” Andi held up the little piece of paper for Harry to see. It was light blue and
Instead of the slow wake up that Harry had intended, Draco jolted awake, knocking his head into Harry’s as he reached for his wand.
An uncomfortable shuffling rippled through the crowds at the mention of the Battle of Hogwarts. Harry swallowed the lump forming in his throat at the memory of little Colin, who would
“Okay, Andi and Narcissa, you’re in charge of food and drinks because you’ve actually planned and hosted Christmas dinners before,” Harry said once they reached the Muggle shopping center.
“Honestly? I don’t know what to do with myself. I’m teaching kids defensive spells in the old D.A. practice room because it makes the kids feel
for fires. The acrid smell of burning paint and charms filled the hall. Hermione turned away coughing, but Harry stared at the fire as it changed colors while the charms came undone.
article…” Harry’s face was a deep red by the time he finished his sentence lamely. Ron laughed at Harry’s face, but placed a warm, steady hand on his leg.
“Definitely not.” He rolled his hips against Draco to make him make that noise again. When he did, Harry leaned back in, kissing him roughly.
“It’s great! When we’re not at the shop, we’re figuring out what laws are harmful and how to fix them, learning what’s true and what’s myth, and finding werewolves all over the country to tell them what we’re doing. That way they can get involved if they want, and we can at least offer them housing and support. It’s a lot of work, tough work, but I’m glad we’re doing it. And, so far so good!”
“Well, it’s a hell of a story, that’s for sure.” The matter of fact way Draco said it made Harry laugh Draco smiled, at the carefree sound Harry was making. It was a relief after the night they’d had.
“Plus there’s that patch of swamp left by the Weasley twins!!” a boy yelled with a grin. Harry had a feeling Ginny had been telling stories about her brothers to anyone who would listen.
Harry found himself picking at his food and falling out of conversations. He stared at his plate with a forlorn expression that caught Draco’s attention.
Ron. This was the longest they’d been separated since they’d met. Even during the war, when he left him and Hermione, there wasn’t this long of a separation. It was nice to see him again, and he vowed to make a better effort to keep in contact this semester.
They became anxious, though, as the match drew nearer and their Keeper was late.  At almost the last minute, she ran into the locker room amid grumbles from her other teammates. She hurriedly changed into her robes while Harry ran through the last few plays for the game, and then they were out onto the pitch. Screams and cheers and Luna’s lion hat’s roar met their ears and Harry grinned, waving at Hermione and Neville where they cheered next to Luna. He moved to shake the Hufflepuff Captain’s hand, managing to return her smile before mounting his broom.
Everyone at the table just gaped at him for a moment. Harry looked up to see all eyes on him (again).
Draco nudged Harry slightly, pulling him from his reverie. Arthur stood up and cleared his throat, drawing attention from the side conversations around the room.
“If they don’t and we end up with a sulky Harry again, and we have to repeat fifth year, I will personally make Malfoy's a living hell.” Ron leaned down to kiss Harry’s forehead too. Once his best mate was tucked in, firewhiskey safely stored on the floor, Ron and Hermione snuck off to bed. Harry was too deeply asleep to hear them laughing at their friend’s flair for the dramatic.
Most days it did feel like they were alone, the last living souls in their world. Everything they had known was thousands and thousands of miles east, being slowly obliterated by a fascist power.
“That’s a mean trick to play on the little ones,” Hermione said as she hid her smile behind her goblet.
with a picture of the Elder Wand beneath it. (A present from Ron on his 18th birthday.) Murmurs followed him all the way into Muggle London, where he just blended into the rest of the lazy millennial population.
Dean said he’d take the sixth years, knowing they especially would need someone who’s kind and patient; plus, he’d mastered nonverbal spells during the war and was excited to teach his method.
Harry started to explain all the little details he painstakingly worked to ensure existed and Draco found himself impressed with all of the work Harry had done, mostly by hand according to both Harry and Andi. Harry recounted funny stories of Teddy getting caught up in the renovations, or when silly accidents would happen.
“I’m removing your painting and making sure none of it can be salvaged. Now SHUT UP!” Harry slammed the curtains against her screaming that had started once he’d threatened her. Exhaustion washed over him and he slumped against the wall, glad her screams quieted in the darkness of the curtains.
“We were supposed to hate each other, Draco. And I thought I did. For a long time. But… turns out my interest was of a different kind.” Harry leaned in, fully intending to show Draco just what
“After what we’ve been through, there’s no need to hate each other. We were both affected by You-Know-Who and neither of us chose that for ourselves. So… Yeah, I don’t hate you.”
Much like he’d done during his first tenure at Hogwarts, he started thinking about something else. He thought about the renovations he’d done this summer, and the time he’d spent steeped in the Wizarding World like he hadn’t before. It was the first summer he’d never seen the Dursleys. That was weird in and of itself, but it was also the first summer he wasn’t worried about Vold-- You-Know-Who’s plot to kill him. Instead, he worked to make Grimmauld Place a home.
“It’s no’ right for a kid to be wanderin’ like tha’, ‘specially not when he looks like a stiff wind’d blow ‘im over. Once yer dad and the rest’d completed the Animagus transformation, they joined our monthly breakfast and teas.”
“We’re all very lucky to have each other,” Narcissa said, looking fondly at Draco. With the awkward pause, Harry looked around for something to continue the conversation with. His eyes finally drifted to Narcissa’s hand as her rings caught the light. They
Harry wandered through the gallery, snacking on anything that came his way and slowly sipping butterbeer. The gallery was impressive, for sure. He stopped to converse with the paintings occasionally, curious about their life in this castle, one without children. They told a few interesting stories, but in all honesty, they told him they were a little bored.
