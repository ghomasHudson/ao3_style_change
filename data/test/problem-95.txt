Ginny sat next to Harry and shot him a smile. He returned it, but quickly looked away from her and started piling his plate with food. All throughout last year, Ginny was one of the only things on Harry’s mind. She was a huge part of the reason why he kept going. And after the war, he assumed that everything would go back to normal, or as normal as it could be, and Ginny and him would be together again. But so far, that hadn’t happened yet.
Before long, someone else was beside Harry, staring up at the night sky with him.
Ron’s mouth started to move, but no sound came out. His eyes frantically darted around his surroundings. Slowly, but surely, he started to regain control of himself and he managed to speak.
“I thought it was a nice sentiment,” she replied huffily before the door swung closed.
Harry felt bad for the girl, but he couldn’t help but enjoy Malfoy’s irritation.
“If McGonagall’s Headmistress, then who’s…” Harry’s question was soon answered when McGonagall started to speak.
“It’s quite nice, really, but,” Harry paused. “I’m in Gryffindor, so wouldn’t something red or gold be better?”
“Hello,” he said to the snake. The words sounded normal to him, but then again, Harry did have a habit of slipping into Parseltongue without realizing. He repeated himself, focusing on the snake. “Hello.”
Harry rolled his eyes. It was nice that the

talk to him first. Give him a warning.”
“Yeah,” Harry said.
“However, given Potter’s return to Hogwarts, we suspect that he will have to make a trip to Diagon Alley to fetch some school supplies.” Hermione set down the paper.
“Romania’s not going away anytime soon.” Ron shrugged and shoved a spoonful of his ice cream sundae into his mouth.
(See the end of the chapter for
Harry slept uneasily, flashes of the war frequenting his mind and disturbing his rest. The next day was a blur of packing and animated conversations about returning to Hogwarts. Harry didn’t realize just how much he missed Hogwarts until his letter arrived.
“What’re you looking at Harry?” Ron looked behind him to try to spot what Harry was watching.
Harry, Ron and Hermione decided against visiting George’s shop; they didn’t want to get in the way. So the three of them headed back to the Burrow, where Hermione went upstairs to pack. Ron and Harry played a few rounds of Exploding Snaps before the rest of the Weasley family arrived at home. They ate dinner and Harry turned outside for some fresh air.
“It’s not just you, all this summer it kept happening to me.” The group reached the grand doors and waited for a teacher to open them. “I would be working in the greenhouse or talking to my Gran and then suddenly I was back here, fighting Death Eaters.”
Sorry for the updates folks, I'm just finally fixing the spacing on this story so hopefully it'll be easier to read!
“And finally, and most importantly,” McGonagall addressed the students. “I would like to recognize the events of the past year.” She paused. “The defeat of He-Who… of Voldemort was a great feat. But it came at a priceless cost. We suffered many losses during Voldemort’s reign of terror, especially in the Battle of Hogwarts.” She took a breath. “Their lives were not lost in vain, but that does not make their deaths any less grievous. We can never truly recover from their loss, but we can continue to live in their image. We must continue to be loyal,” She glanced over at the Hufflepuffs. “Wise,” McGonagall looked at the Ravenclaws. “Ambitious,” She gave a nod to the Slytherins. “And brave.” Her eyes finally landed on the Gryffindors.
“I’m fine,” His breathing was rushed and shallow. “I just- I mean… it was like…”
lucky day.” She turned to Harry. “Looks like you’re going to have to pay a visit to Diagon Alley after all.”
“At least they spelled your name correctly,” Hermione pointed out. “Apparently I’m Hermione Ginger.”
Although the Ministry has decided that this seventh year at Hogwarts is optional for all-of-age wizards and witches, Potter, along with most of his classmates, has decided to return. Of course, for all underage wizards, continuation of Hogwarts education is mandatory.
“Well, goodnight.” He made his way back into the house and up to the second floor, taking the stairs two at a time. It wasn’t that Harry didn’t enjoy Ginny’s company, he did. No matter what happened between them, he knew he could always count on Ginny to be his friend, but everytime they were alone together now, it felt like she expected something of him. Something that he couldn’t give her.
“I’m Head Girl,” Hermione breathed. She looked up from her letter and Harry saw tears lining her eyes.
“I guess not.” Harry shrugged. He wasn’t disappointed; being a parseltongue was of little use to him now.
Again, I'm sure most of you are already probably aware of this, but I just thought it best that I reiterate this point. Let's use this fandom and fan-work as a way to create space for our most marginalized friends, and remember that it is always more important to value human lives over a fictional story.
Soon enough, dinner was over and Ron and Harry were escorting Ambrose up to the Gryffindor dormitories. Hermione tailed behind the group, making sure no first years, got lost.
“Yes,” Hermione nodded and Harry saw a slight blush creeping up her cheeks. “And now that you mention it Ron, I suppose I could. Although,” Hermione considered for a moment. “I
“She. And nothing.” Harry beamed. “She’s just a dog.”
“What about you, Neville?”
“Beautiful night.” Ginny glanced at Harry and he hummed in agreement. Silence befell them once again. Harry looked at Ginny.
“Just Malfoy telling off a first year.”
“So who’s teaching Transfiguration then?” Neville asked.
“Let us take a moment of silence for those who unwillingly gave their lives for the peace of the wizarding world.” The hall fell silent as the hundreds of students paid their respects to the dead. Even the Slytherins wore solemn expressions on their faces. Some minutes later, McGonagall broke the silence. “Let the feast begin.”
Before Harry could be too entranced with his robes however, Madam Malkin began yelling across the shop.
“Good evening students,” she began. Her hair was pulled back into a tight bun and her face was just as stern as ever, but Harry saw a slight smile tugging at the corner of her lips as she regarded the students. “It is with great pleasure that I welcome you back to Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. I am glad to see that so many of you have returned. We shall begin the Sorting Ceremony momentarily.”
Not for lack of trying on Ginny’s part; every chance she had, she not-so-subtly hinted that she wanted their relationship to start again, but Harry just wasn’t ready. And if he was being honest with himself, he wasn’t sure he ever would be.
She returned his gaze, her eyes taking in Harry’s features. She opened her mouth, but before she could utter a single word, Harry spoke.
“I’m just going to go clean up in the kitchen a bit. You all dig in,” she said hurriedly, her voice thick with oncoming tears.
“Oi! What do you think you’re doing here?” she bellowed. Harry turned to see where she was looking and saw the back of a familiar blonde head. “You’re not welcome here.”
“Er- yeah,” Harry stammered, taken aback by the wizard’s sudden appearance. “What does she… you know, do?” The man gave Harry a quizzical look. “I mean, is she magical?” Harry suddenly felt stupid asking.
“Password?” The Fat Lady asked once they reached the entrance to Gryffindor tower.
“You could at least congratulate me!”
“Anywhere else we need to go after this?” Harry asked. He loved Diagon Alley, but he was starting to get tired after being on his feet all day.
“Nightmares,” he muttered, keeping his eyes on the ground. Even after everything, Harry hated to admit to Hermione that he was having night terrors. He couldn’t bear to remind his friends of the devastating losses  they had suffered at the Battle of Hogwarts. If Fred’s face haunted Harry’s dreams, he couldn’t possibly imagine the horrors that Ron was going through.
“Malfoy,” Ron said without missing a beat. He jerked his head in the direction of the Slytherin table. “Bullying a first year and classes haven’t even started yet.”
“Merlin, is there going to be another Triwizard Tournament?” Ron whined.
“Like you were back at the battle?”
“This one? Oh no,” The man laughed and scooped the pup into his arms. “She’s just a dog. Found her and her mum outside in the trash bin.” He plopped the dog into Harry’s arms, and Harry nearly dropped her, as he hadn’t expected to be handed a puppy. The man leaned over the cage and picked up an empty food dish and promptly turned and started walking away. Harry followed him to the back of the shop. “Only one of the litter who survived, poor thing. The mum wandered off as soon as I took ‘em in, but she left this little one behind.”
Ginny snorted and tried to steal a glance at the paper, having to lean across Harry to do so.  George wandered into the room as Hermione turned to page eleven and started to read aloud.
“Yeah, her,” Harry confirmed.
“Wait, Charlie?” Harry asked.
“I forgot we’d be able to see them this year,” Hermione said grimly.
“Dementors,” Harry lied vaguely. It was an awful lie, and Harry knew it, and from the way Hermione squinted at him, he could tell she knew it too. But luckily, she seemed to accept his answer for the time being and didn’t press any further.
“This is a load of rubbish!” Ron said from behind his newspaper. He picked it up once Charlie had finished and was now examining the front page. “Sidekicks? Really?”
“Ron!” Hermione said. “I can’t abuse my privileges as Head Girl. At least,” She lowered her voice and smiled evilly. “Not this early in the term.”
“Harry?”
“Hello,” Harry replied. The sound of crickets filled the air.
However, one of his peers didn’t seem to give the carnivorous beasts a second thought. Malfoy strode over to the carriages, glanced at the Thestrals, and took a seat, not even noticing the frightened stares around him. Blaise Zabini clambered in after him, equally calm, although Harry wondered if Zabini could even see the creatures. He didn’t think that the handsome boy had stayed for the battle.
“If you think about it, it’s actually sort of impressive how they managed to write a four page article about it.” Charlie chuckled.
“The new password’s a bit simple, don’t you think?” he whispered. The Fat Lady overheard him.
“Boys, your dormitory is upstairs to your left, girls, to your right.” She gestured to the staircase behind her. “Classes start tomorrow and I expect everyone to get a good night’s sleep and represent Gryffindor well, goodnight,” she finished firmly. The first-years and more easily intimidated Gryffindor students moved up the stairs while most of the older students hung around in the common room. Hermione spotted Harry and Ron and made her way over to them. “How’d I do?”
Applause exploded throughout the hall, and Seamus stood up and whistled. McGonagall raised her hands in the air, signaling for the students to cease their clapping and return to their seats. She unfurled a sheet of parchment and called up the first new student.
“SLYTHERIN!” The black-haired boy hurried over to the silver and green clad table.
“Yeah, we just moved from America.”
He stepped into Madam Malkin’s and was immediately greeted by the stares of several onlookers in the shop. He quickly made his way past them and searched for the dress robes section of the store.
The students settled down and McGonagall began speaking again.
” it cried, and she walked over to the table on the right where she received several high fives and hugs.
“Seriously, he can’t even pick on someone his own size anymore?” Hermione said, exasperated. “He’s going after eleven year olds?”
“Hey Charlie,” Harry said.  Charlie glanced up from that morning’s
“About what?” she said. Like she had to ask.
“Like anybody’s surprised,” Ron joked, and Hermione thwacked him with her letter.
“I would first like to introduce the Heads of your houses. Professor Pomona Sprout: Head of Hufflepuff House.” The Hufflepuff table gave a cheer. “Professor Filius Flitwick: Head of Ravenclaw House.” The Ravenclaws burst into applause. “Professor Horace Slughorn: Head of Slytherin.” About half of the Slytherins clapped half-heartedly while the other half sulked in their seats.
“S-She’s in love?” Quinn asks, surprised.
Potter hums thoughtfully, and Draco stands up once more, turning towards Potter to watch him frown at his timepiece on his wrist.
“Peele and Prone, you patrol the school corridors, while Bones, Smith, Keir, Quinn and myself will start questioning prefects, the Head Boy and Girl, as well as the late Miss Travers’ boyfriend,” Harry says, and then gives the Aurors more specific instructions about who will be questioning prefects from which house.
Their father’s gaze whips back to Albus, and Albus is surprised as he had thought that
“Stop at once! State your business!” Quinn yells, his wand at the ready.
“Miss Scott told me that Miss Travers and Mr Malfoy continued their conversation further down the corridor, after noticing that other people were listening to their conversation, making it impossible to hear what they were speaking about. Miss Scott stayed in her compartment with her sister and her sister’s friend Miss Westen. Scott explained how they saw Mr Malfoy and Miss Travers, before Miss Travers’s boyfriend Mr Riley joined them. According to Scott, Mr Riley and Miss Travers soon left back to their compartment.”
Scorpius grimaces slightly. “I – I sought Travers.”
He exchanges words briefly with Walter, the young eager Auror, who seems to be getting well with the students, and has managed to calm them down somewhat, as James, Fred, Dominique, Lily and Hugo do not seem as anxious or worried as the rest of the children had been.
– or if he knows anyone who had –
And possibly, James already knew when he went after Scorpius. And if James knew then, Albus isn’t sure if he knows his brother at all.
Draco gives him a curt nod. “I will analyse her blood for potions and poisons, examine the wound more closely and do some diagnostic spells before I’m ready.”
Potter gives Draco a wan smile. “What? No scornful words?”
“Julian,” Scorpius says in the morning. “Could I have a word with Albus?” He asks with a tight voice.
Harry walks up to him, to clap him on his shoulder, to hug him. He wants to reassure him, wants to tell him that their children have nothing to do with Travers’s death, that it must be an unfortunate coincidence that they are being questioned today under Veritaserum. But nothing comes out from his mouth, as the words are stuck somewhere in his throat.
The same.
Thankfully, he had all the time in the world. Kingsley was very understanding, giving Harry time off to heal from his ‘extensive injuries,’ as Tina had told him. Harry wondered if Kingsley knew of his absent memories, knowing Ron’s files would recount it all, but if Kingsley knew, he didn’t let on.
“I don’t think I could stop even if I wanted to,” Harry replied as he grabbed the floo powder and stepped in.
“Harry…” Neville started, but with one look at Harry’s face, filled with conflict and confusion, he let it go. “Goodbye, it was good to see you again. I’ll beat you the next duel though.”
“I just don’t like that idea,” Harry started, building up the courage to say his fears. “The memories aren’t mine. They’re someone else’s. Things are fuzzy when people don’t remember specific details.”
He looked around and saw Ron and Hermione sitting together, looking over the room. It didn’t seem like they were speaking. Then Ron’s eyes landed on Harry, and he beckoned him over.
It was driving Harry insane.
He was growing increasingly impatient.
“Okay! I’m done,” Nott announced loudly, grabbing some of the attention from those in neighbouring tables.
Harry’s had a lot of hit or miss experiences when it came to change. Finding out you’re a wizard? Definite hit. Waking up to find your entire 5 years of life memories are gone? Definite miss. Killing Voldemort? Hit. Losing so many in the process? Miss.
Breakfast was new territory, as Harry was usually never awake before Malfoy left for work. So when Harry said a sleepy good morning to Malfoy, he wasn’t really surprised that he ended up with Malfoy’s wand pointed at his face.
Harry shrugged and gave an easy smile. “Anything you’re willing to tell me.”
“There was a duel. Forgot I came out of the hospital today. Y’know, the usual.” Harry joked.
Harry looked at the book, and gasped. “This is Beauty and the Beast?”
Malfoy’s voice was laced with sorrow. Harry was amazed that Malfoy could remember, or notice something like that. In a way, he could understand why it was hard for him.
Oh, Merlin. The familiar surge of heat, acid filled envy and bile of jealousy fizzled in his chest. He’d forgotten just how much he’d lost from that accident. If he remembered something,
Neither of them seemed to mind though.
“No, this is your space.” Malfoy looked around hesitantly, then continued. “I know you don’t remember, but we agreed that our offices would be spaces for ourselves.”
Malfoy and Ron put a comforting hand on Malfoy’s shoulder, he couldn’t help but squeak.
Arthur was at the entryway of the room, his face in a cringe.
The floor stopped shaking, and the books stopped falling out of the shelves. But no one moved. Not Malfoy. Not Harry.
“Oh, Nott’s an author, he’s written a lot of books. All that romance stuff. ‘Easy for him to do,’ he says. ‘I’ve got two boyfriends.’ Goyle works in a repair shop in Hogsmeade. He repairs enchanted stuff like charmed mirrors and picture frames that got all weird, but he’s also really good at making things.”
“Christ, Harry, you’re definitely overthinking this.”
Healer Tina took a quick visit too. He was awake enough to hear that there was no physical damage with Harry, once again, before leaving. But soon fell back asleep.
He arrived a few shops down from Malfoy’s apothecary. Keeping his head down, and making himself as small as possible, he speedwalked to the front door.
Harry sighed. “Look, I appreciate it, but I should go back to my office-”
Harry had just called Malfoy ‘Draco,’ and it didn’t feel wrong rolling off his tongue.
But even with the conversation from Pansy, he knew he wouldn’t stop. Every person that told him to stop brought him farther away from the edge, but his desperation and jealousy always dragged him towards it.
He sat down next to Malfoy at the table, and opened the top of his noodle cup, then groaned.
Harry gulped, trying not to choke in his cookie. “Your friends said that? Maybe you should get new ones.”
Malfoy’s face was overcome by worry and confusion. “What?”
It wasn’t a lie, Harry decided. But he wasn’t ready to come to that truth yet, not like this, not while he’s still like this. He isn’t the Harry Malfoy loves yet, he can’t do this. At least, not yet.
“Got a letter for me?” He asked the owl. The owl just bowed its head and stood still as Harry unfolded it.
That was the first of many moments Harry realised Lavender Brown was completely and utterly in love with her job.
Harry sighed in relief. Confidentiality is one of the utmost important things working in this department. Lavender, Ron, Harry and everyone working under Kingsley Shacklebolt understood its importance.
do that.” That word was a hammer and nail to his skull. His spine thrummed with magic, and his brain broke.
Harry, true to his word, started packing his stuff. He filed the folders into his desk drawers, noting to check the pensieve memories of interviews and interrogations tomorrow.
“It was… At Ginny and Luna’s wedding, you were dancing with Blaise. The both of you were elegant, just as you’d expect by learning from a young age.” Harry commented.
But the idea was all he had, so he kept to it. At least this way, he felt like he was actually moving instead of the sad stagnancy from before.
They all nod, and say their thanks as Lara skips away. Harry’s amazed, despite not doing or saying anything, Lara couldn’t tell anything was different with Harry. She just treated him like the Harry from before. A small idea comes into his head.
Malfoy pointed to the shelves behind them with his thumb. “All those books on the shelves are mine, but it wasn’t always like that. You had your own books there too. Believe me, I was surprised when I found out you actually read but you filled up a lot of space.”
In silence, they turned and walked to the back. He quickly put their food in the space under the counter for Malfoy to have when he’s free. Harry looked back once to find Malfoy, but found him only being swarmed by more customers.
Malfoy’s face showed way too much. For one, Harry knew he hadn’t had a proper night’s sleep. Heavy bags under his sunken eyes, and his usually flawless skin had spots. Along with that, Malfoy’s cheekbones had sharpened immensely, his jawline jutting out. He looked sick, thin, and much too tired.
Harry ducked his head, hoping no one would recognise him. Neville and Goyle immediately noticed his reaction, and said it would be best if we left now.
“About three weeks. 20 days to be exact.”
“Okay.” Parkinson and Zabini said together.
“Out of all the songs in the world... Why that one?” He shouted to her as he hoisted Teddy up.
She laughed lightly in response. “Teddy’s missed you the most, he never lets go of that plushie now.”
“Don’t forget he got 3 chocolate frogs!” George chimed.
Harry was silent. His anger was bubbling. He didn’t know if he was angry at Malfoy for making sense, or himself for wanting to ignore it. “No, I didn’t know.” He finally said through gritted teeth.
He also noticed how they helped each other, there was always someone who watched just in case a hippogriff would reject a student. There weren't any rejections yet, and the students were overjoyed.
*****
It’s been about a week since the celebration at the Burrow. Despite feeling a lot better, he knew he wouldn’t be a good guest. So when he heard Cauldron Full of Hot Strong Love and Ron’s absolute outcry, he knew Malfoy was finally within reach. Harry kept to his promise with Malfoy and sought him out after hugging Teddy in the kitchen.
“Wait, what was the dancing?” Harry asked, amazed at how pretty much everyone looked like they wanted to forget.
Instead, she just smiled sadly at Harry. “Well, you’re Harry James Potter. Son of James and Lily Potter. Partner to Draco Malfoy. Godfather to Teddy Remus Lupin. You’ve got a large array from friends who would proudly stand by your side through anything.”
“...So yeah, that’s how it’s been.” Harry shrugged.
Harry stepped into the apothecary, the bell ringing just as it always did. “Malfoy, I got you-”
Silence took over the room again. Malfoy didn’t seem to have eaten even half of his plate yet. Despite that, he looked much for sure of himself than Harry could muster right now.
“Malfoy,” Harry said slowly. “I don’t remember the past 5 years. Last I checked, Hermione just became Minister for Magic… It’s all really sudden for me, this entire situation. Even this place.”
“I don’t believe it, that doesn’t make sense. I just decided to?”
“The vials are the same throughout all the rooms, but each needs a case ID and assigned member ID to access. So many memories, so many important details of a case waiting to be found.”
After Malfoy took a plateful, Harry got his food as well. When he ate one bite, he hummed happily. It was nice, and let Malfoy know it.
Harry tried not to be shocked at his own words. The voice that came out of him couldn’t have been his. There was concern woven into the words, but a stray piece of affection had found its way too. The affection was so noticeable on his ears, and Harry didn’t think it should’ve been there at all.
Commending Hermione and her logic, he changed into the new clothes that Ron gave him. He endured through one last diagnostic charm by Tina with gritted teeth. When she smiled and nodded in satisfaction, Harry moved to hug her, thanking her for everything she’d done.
How on earth did he develop feelings for Draco Malfoy?
“That's why he was here when I first woke up…” He said more to himself.
As he enters the Great Hall, a wave of memories hit him. It wasn’t new memories, no, it was memories of a battle, of a body falling on the other side of his wand, of bodies covered and grieving people over them. But it was also laughter, and friends at a table, food between them, it was staring contests across the hall with a blonde with grey eyes, and a hint of uncertainty and suspicion.
It had to be true. Because how could he love the person in front of him? The man from his childhood? The man who took so many good memories from his grasp? It just had to be true. So why did his body scream out ‘LIAR!’ His heart yearned to be closer, to take the words back from the air before they reached Malfoy’s ears.
strong enough. It was driving him crazy.
“Sorry, you two just-” Another burst of laughter that Malfoy tried so hard to contain. “Were so shocked, and then the wings-”
“You’re early. I wasn’t expecting you for at least another hour.” It was Malfoy’s voice. Slightly deeper than in his memory. A lot more calm than from when he woke up. “Couldn’t wait to get out of there, could you, you impatient git.”
“Thank you,” Harry put on a smile.
Harry’s cheeks turned red. Oh, crap. He’d forgotten the food from the cafeteria. Harry held on a finger, and ran over to the cafe across the street.
But Luna and Ginny just started laughing softly.
Harry was in awe. In a way, that’s what made Harry want to become an auror. He was so inspired by how many of those around him constantly fought for justice and the rightness of the world.
“Read this to me. It’ll be like the first time again.” Teddy’s smile shone so brightly, Harry couldn’t possibly refuse.
“And she landed on my head, and she hasn’t gotten off since. She won’t go on my shoulders or my arm, or her cage.” Harry looked up as Isolt, and Isolt looked back just like before.
“You’re not him.” Malfoy cut him off. His voice was so gentle, so caring. “What are you doing, Harry? What have you done?”
This laugh was different from before. Very different from the laugh Malfoy had when Isolt stayed perched on his head, and more so different from The Burrow party when Ron stole Ginny’s storytelling spotlight.

“July 31st, 1980.”
*****
But it worked out, Charlie had sorted it all out, and Hagrid had an international portkey ready for Romania as soon as the Christmas holidays began. He was ecstatic, and Harry was extremely happy for him.
“Can you guys tell me something? Maybe it’ll help me with more memories.” Harry asked as they ate their food.
his mind told him.
When Goyle shook his hand and smiled back with a hint of hesitation, Harry decided his plans would slowly go in motion.
“Because,” Ron’s voice cracked. “Because it was my fault. If I had just gotten there quicker, if I had just told him to wait, then…”
“Not strange, it’s just enchanted to make the room seem more manageable. It helps people concentrate. If the room expanded to it’s full size…”
If they somehow knew what he was doing, the lies he was spouting, the false hope he planted in his friends, it would hit them harder than it did for Harry.
Harry read the letter.
They made it to the apparition point. Harry could hear children playing and screaming in the park just a few metres away. For a split second, he thought of Teddy, and how much he’d enjoy running around with them.
Lunch came and passed, and Harry did forget to eat. He was too busy rearranging the book shelves, making room for his book space without ruining the order that Malfoy had put his books in.
His mind asked him. He put that thought away for later.
Gathering that maybe, this time, he was okay, he opened his mouth to speak. It was only when his breath formed a bubble in his throat that he realised what it all meant. Just the depth to how much he’s lost, and how much he has to regain.
“Oh, I don’t mean like that. With your memory gone, you feel much younger.”
okay, right?
Harry cast a
Malfoy looked at him and continued chewing then swallowed.
"YOU RUINED MY MOMENT!" Ginny shouted.
“And then Neville realised what was happening, didn’t he?”
It fell flat on everyone’s ears. Malfoy sighed in defeat, and raised his arms up in amazement.
“Please?”
But Harry didn’t miss the widening of Malfoy’s eyes, or the slight burn of his own cheeks.
Harry looked at Minerva as she walked on and wondered if he could risk doing the plan. Minerva was still as observant as she always had been. It was obvious by the way she could reprimand a student causing a ruckus down the hall, just out of sight.
By the time Harry fully wakes up, it’s a new day, and he’s on his bed. His head hurt slightly, but the pain ebbed away.
“Damn it.”
“Yeah?”
Lavender looked at him oddly, an eyebrow raised in question. “Of course, I love my job. Don’t you?”
“Yeah,” Harry cleared his throat. “Yeah, I’m okay. I don’t know what happened.”
Harry waited for him to continue, but he never did. “That seems very mature of us.”
Harry told himself.
!” Harry’s wand was up, pointing at Malfoy square in the chest.
Isolt didn’t buy it, and nipped a little harder.
Harry ground his teeth together. Everything that Malfoy was saying was right, and he knew it, but it was so aggravating. Each and every world felt like a slap across Harry’s face, and every look was a punch to the gut.
Harry nodded in response, and felt the anger turn into a slow simmer. He sighed, and tried to control himself. Nothing made sense. None of it made sense. This unknown Malfoy, the unknown Harry of before, this unknown Hermione, Ron, Isolt. It was all unknown.
The memories stayed hidden. Even with confused healers performing the spell that counter Obliviate, nothing came. The Obliviate took his memories, but the hit on the head ensured they stayed gone. He’d have to try and get them back another way.
“About 3 years, give or take.” Ron stood up, moving away from Harry, giving him space.
“How are you going with everything, Harry?” Kingsley asked.
“Yeah, you’re right…” Harry trailed off, and guilt grew back again, realising that he didn’t really know that, not completely.
Harry walked to his bedroom, and flopped onto the bed. The tiredness and alcohol began to cover Harry like a just-too-heavy weighted blanket. He folded his glasses, took out his wand, and placed both of them on the bedside table.
The next few days were terrible.
Harry’s eyes widened at the news.
Harry’s never cried this hard before. His lungs were on fire, and his heart felt beaten up. But so much had happened in that one hour, he was exhausted. There was a part of him that felt guilty for ruining Malfoy’s day off, but it was quickly washed away by his exhaustion and the mind splitting migraine forming in his head.
Blaise shook his head. “No, he’s been too stressed with the shop lately. We didn’t want to say anything yet.”
“Morning, Malfoy,” He called out as he ran into the kitchen busily.
*****
The next few rooms were grand. There were rooms with pin boards to help visual and keep track of the timeline of cases, rooms filled with muggle criminology textbooks that lead off into the wizarding ones, room filled with international floo call lines, and even areas for language and code decryptions.
Lavender laughed and patted his shoulder. “Don’t worry, you’ll get used to it.”
That night, Malfoy and Harry talked about many things. They didn’t speak of their relationship, how they met after 8th year, or what they’ve done together and Harry was eternally grateful for that. But Harry did learn a lot about Malfoy in every other aspect.
They walked into one of the health examination rooms, and found a familiar face smiling at him.
“You need to let me cook eventually, you know that, right?” Harry joked, elbowing Malfoy.
Harry sighed internally but chuckled. “Of course.”
!” Malfoy’s wand shot out.
He didn’t know anything from the last five years, let alone what Draco Malfoy was thinking. There was so much stress and tension in his brain already from the day before, now add onto the events of today, he could feel himself slipping.
“Editors, publishers, they’re all over the world. Sometimes Theo would go to different places to write, like if it’s at a wheatfield, he’ll spend a day there as if he was his characters.”
He took out his wand and tried a few cleaning charms. The ink was stubborn and unrelenting, but he managed to clean it decently.
“Thank you, healer Tina. I’ll keep in touch if anything should arise.” Kingsley shook her hand.
Tentatively, he opened the cage. The owl must’ve been wonderfully trained as it flew out only to rest at Harry’s arm. He pet it and scratched its neck. His heart soared and sobbed at the same time.
Andromeda hadn’t aged a day. Her face was still shone with youth just as it had done all those years ago. Her smiles were bright, and her eyes had a sense of peace in them. He held back all the tears that threatened to take over. He told himself he wouldn’t break down again, not like yesterday.
“Either way, I’m still your main healer.” Tina started to talk, gesturing for Harry to follow. “Unless you wish to have a different healer?”
“Hello, Potter.” Pansy Parkinson waved confidently.
For some reason, the idea of Malfoy knowing, or hoping, that Harry’s memories were coming back made him feel like he was going to dry heave. The same went for Hermione and Ron too.
Harry could feel Malfoy begin to close up. He saw it in the twitch in Malfoy eyebrow and the clenching of his jaw. But Harry wanted to keep asking questions. He needed to know, he was dying to know, to remember.
Even now in sleep, pj’s messy, and hair poking out like Harry’s, he was just as beautiful as he was when he got ready for a day outside. Even now with a blank sleepy face, all Harry could see was the way he smiled and laughed, the way he did with his entire being, walls down but carefree and content.
They spoke at the same time, and cut off at the same time. The sides of Harry’s lips twitched upwards.
“For me, it would depend on the lie,” Harry answered.
“Harry?” Malfoy called out.
“You’re not going to get off my head, are you?” Harry asked as he caught his breath.
Harry’s arm slowly patted the table next to him until he felt the frames of his glasses underneath. He carefully and slowly put them on his head. Everything cleared up. He looked at Malfoy again, watching him as he blinked himself awake.
“It’s better if we apparate, there’s a point not too far from here.” Hermione said, opening the door.
Maybe it wasn’t such a surprise after all. That scared him the most. That felt the most real, like somehow that just merged the old Harry and the new.
“AND THEN THEY MADE ME SING WITH THEM!” Ron yelled, then immediately covered his mouth, shocked at his outburst.
“Now read this one, it’s one of my favourites.” Teddy held up The Fountain of Fair Fortune.
“Nice to meet you, Kiana. By the way, about your notes on lacewing flies…”
But what no one told Harry was how incredibly frustrating stagnancy was.
The apothecary looked just as it did before with the addition of new customers coming in. Harry was amazed. Malfoy had such a cool and collected nature around himself. Despite the flood of customers, he never showed his stress.
Feeling better, heaps better than 3 weeks ago when he woke up, he just wanted to go home. But where was home? Where did he live? Was it still at Grimmauld place or did he move out? He’d been thinking of moving out for a while, but that was 5 years ago. So much could have happened since.
Lavender moved up to the shelves littered with lifetimes.
Like the mature adult he is, Harry pulled a face at Malfoy. As expected, he got one back.
Malfoy these days, Harry was just wondering. Still, he never asked again.
Nott suddenly jumped and scrambled for his pockets, mumbling a jumbled mess of Harry’s words back to himself. After about 3 seconds, Nott had a muggle pen and notepad in his hand, scribbling messily onto the pages.
“Thank you!” Harry smiled.
Malfoy was the first to let go when they reached the stairs. He yawned again and looked over at Harry with tired eyes.
He could imagine Hedwig looking down, perched on the shoulder of ones of his passed mates. Maybe even his mum or dad. Despite the forest where she’d have a multitude of friends, Hedwig would still go to one of his friends or family, and just watch as Harry moved along life.
Malfoy stopped short of the last room which Harry concluded was his own office. “Harry, you don’t remember anything from the past 5 years. You don’t remember… us. So, until you get your memories back, we’ll be sleeping in different rooms.”
But he bought them anyway. After all, if it was a good book, at least he could enjoy it for the first time again.
It was a picture frame. A moving picture frame. A group of people laughing and smiling, arms over shoulders and a flash of the camera. A moment of camaraderie held within a simple frame.
But Lavender’s hand was still on his shoulder. It felt like it was burning through his clothes and onto his skin. He hated it.
Malfoy still wasn’t looking at Harry. But Malfoy was all Harry could look at right now. That calm and collected nature, the way his voice didn’t rise anywhere near a shout. Harry could do with a big dose of that, knowing how his emotions took over much quicker than anyone else.
“What’re they doing these days?”
Harry kissed Teddy’s cheek and held him tighter. “Yeah, I’m okay.”
A few minutes, one steaming cup of earl grey tea, and a soothed mind later, he walked over to the boxes of picture frames. Fear and anticipation filled his entire body. There would be a lot to go through in there, a lot to handle, and Harry knew it would be too much.
His words were dripping with a mix of fear and anger. Malfoy went on and on about how worried and annoyed at Harry he was, how much he hated him even. But Harry didn’t really mind, he could smell his favourite  soup cooking in the kitchen.
“Send me a message if you need me,” Lavender said. “You don’t need to start any cases today if you don’t think you’re up for it. But you’ll be expected to be in top shape tomorrow.”
Pansy Parkinson was there with him along the way, though she branched off into the muggle world a lot sooner than Blaise had. In fact, it was her that encouraged Blaise to try it out.
Malfoy barely got through the incantation, but Harry’s legs collapsed right underneath him. For seconds, it was just the two of them breathing, gasping for air. The tension in the house was still so high, and the air still sparked with anger.
He glazed over the details. Name: Lia Adwin. Would be age 22 now, disappeared 5 years ago, short punk styled hair, tan skin, and short. Has a scar on her lip that goes down to her chin.
Feeling them both slowly get up, release the Muffliato charm, and walk out the door was hard. But nothing hurt more than when he stopped his breathing to hear whisper-shouts out the door and realising with a cold, empty feeling that Malfoy was outside, crying in the arms of his -no,
“How is your mother, by the way?”
.” Harry said, walking towards the door.
“Will you be going to the duelling club session today, Mr Potter?” A third year Slytherin asked politely.
“You kept all of this… Why didn’t you tell anyone? Ron and Hermione?” Malfoy asked quietly after processing all the knowledge.
Before he could even turn his body to get out of the kitchen, Teddy leaped in, snitch plushie still in hand. Teddy took one look at Harry, and tilted his head.
She flew onto his shoulder and stayed there proudly. Harry was so happy to have Isolt. Together they left the house, a fierce determination written all over Harry’s face.
Malfoy smirked.
Whoever the guests were, hopefully they didn’t mind Harry just casually on the floor with bloody trousers and blood dripping from his mouth.
“Huh.” Harry nodded in amazed understanding.
Harry finally looked up, amazed at the obvious friendly teasing in Malfoy’s tone. Harry commanded his eyes to focus on the man in front of him. His friend. His apparent partner.
Harry nodded, and turned to leave.
His emotions were all over the place, as he sat down on the chair in front of Kingsley’s desk. Familiar bubbles of jealousy, hope being strangled by desperation. Nothing makes sense.
But even so, Harry just kept looking as Malfoy rode through the waves of pure joy.
There were so many things he didn’t think about, like how many fights did he have with his friends? What else did he give up without trying? That life was becoming less perfect, and more real.
Every lunch break, Harry would spend it with Malfoy. Even if the customers only continued growing, even if Malfoy told him to take him and his paparazzi elsewhere, even if more ridiculous headlines popped up. He knew he’d be there again.
Harry closed his eyes and begged his heart to stop aching. His heart was crying, he could feel it, and his mind had stopped moving completely. Something was wrong, the words he was saying felt like cotton stuffed into his mouth. It felt like soap bubbles filling up his throat.
And for the first time in a long time, he meant it.
“You haven’t gotten any memories back?”
worked. For a moment, he thought it hadn’t. He took a sip of his drink.
His lie rolled off his tongue like he practiced it for months beforehand. Truthfully, he didn’t even know that park was of any importance until they brought it up 4 days ago.
“You think I don’t know that? Merlin, for once in my life I try to do the right thing, and you come and fuck it all up. How else should I have acted,
There was already so much information thrown in his face that when Hermione ran and
Malfoy’s head turned so fast, Harry thought it might end up on the floor. Before he could even laugh at the thought, he was engulfed in a tight embrace. Harry, mind racing and still very confused by all the information he was given, patted Malfoy’s back three times and pulled away.
They finally reached the last door. “Welcome to your office, Harry James Potter.”
It was extremely confusing, but also comforting.
Blaise talked about how it was rewarding at first. It helped him build up his confidence, and put him back on his feet after graduation. But after the first few years, he couldn’t accept how the photos didn’t matter to anyone. How it only gained traction because he was beautiful, which was definitely true.
Malfoy took it, and didn’t let go even after he got up. One part of Harry was screaming at him to let go, the other was telling him to hold on even tighter. Harry ignored both of them with a fierce determination.
He knew he was being rude. But it still irked him how it’s been so long and no memories have returned yet. He is still Harry, he knows, but that Harry had just about
Harry was amazed at the deduction, and simply nodded.
Harry decided not to question it, though in a way, Luna was right. “Thank you. So, how have you been? What are you doing these days?”
“Oh Merlin, I’ll never forget that,” Nott laughed, wiping a fake tear in his eyes.
Harry didn’t care to change into something better. He slipped on some shoes, and followed them as they walked towards the front door. To be honest, Harry kind of forgot they had one. He’s been using the floo to leave the house the entire time since he’s been here.
“Harry!” Pansy roared. Harry’s head snapped back to Pansy. Her composure was neat and calm, like that shout couldn’t have possibly come from her. “What you’re doing,” Her voice was like a whisper. “It’s stupid, and insulting.”
“Anything new?” Harry asks, sitting heavily opposite to Malfoy, who organises his parchments with a flick of his wand.
“I was going to talk to you in the morning, in any case.” Harry says, and it is the truth, as it is quite late at night already, and he hadn’t known that Malfoy had still been at the scene. And Harry could’ve gone to see the compartment in the morning, allowing himself a few hours of rest. He gives Malfoy a shrug, “And…you said
The parents leave with Moonstone, who escorts them to the station to see their daughter. Harry agrees that he or one of his Aurors will meet them in the village the next day to give them an update about the investigation.
think about Malfoy right now. He checks the time – eleven – and lets out a weary sigh; he still needs to pop in at all houses, except Hufflepuff.
An hour later, Harry’s in for another row with Ginny, as he asks her permission to have Albus questioned under Veritaserum.
Ginny even has a new
“Why?” Albus’s brother mutters, sounding a bit worried. “Is it – is it about what happened?” James asks mutedly.
celebrity of the wizarding world,” he says with a shrug, aiming for indifference.
by that? He looks at the silvery-grey eyes, searching, searching for something. Anything that could give him the answer, because he can’t bloody well outright ask his best friend if he fancies Albus’s brother.
“I told her,” James says quietly, letting out a deep sigh. “She…didn’t take it well.”
Harry also knows that he needs to sit down with his own sons, that he needs to figure out what is going on in their lives. If Harry has learned something from the past three days, it is taking a responsibility, and being a parent when it is needed. He and Ginny together will have to do something that is long due: be honest to their children. And in return, perhaps, they will do the same.
Harry stares at Albus, not really knowing what to do, or what to say. He had suspected that Albus’s and Scorpius’s relationship had been something more than a friendly one, but in the end, he had thrown away those suspicions, thinking that it had been a mere lie on Scorpius’s part. And apparently, it had been.
He gives Parkinson a curt nod. “Smith will return to the village after midnight, along with Bones, Keir and Quinn. Peele and Prone will stay at school premises. Summon them if you need anything,” Harry says, and then frowns a bit before adding very quietly, “In case of an emergency, send the usual messenger, but alert the teachers as well, since they are closer and can provide assistance faster.”
“Yeah, I know…” Harry mutters. “There will be others, questioned later today. But I have to say, Hermione,” Harry says, giving his friend a grim look, “It doesn’t look good. We’re not closer than we were two days ago.”
you say?” He asks slowly, something contemplative – which Albus doesn’t really like – in his expression.
James nods, and then gives their father a short summary of what happened at the party. James also tells him it was the last time he spoke to the girl.
“For Merlin’s sake!” Potter exclaims, standing up with a huff. He walks towards the side table, presumably to pour himself a stiff drink but lets out a disappointed grunt when he finds only Butterbeer.
“Secondly – is that why I’m being questioned? Because I dated her four months ago?” He asks, gritting his teeth, thinking spitefully that the Aurors should then probably question the whole school if that was the reason.
”You reckon she was killed?” Albus whispers to Scorpius, sitting on his friend’s bed.
Albus feels like his chest might explode with distress. “He’ll choose his career. He’ll choose Char.” Albus says, knowing,
Albus shares a grim look with his classmates. What is left unsaid – what Albus reckons is undoubtedly in everyone’s minds – is the question whether it was an accident, or if there is a murderer in their midst.
“He has a girlfriend,” Albus says, knowing that it is pointless to bring it up. Knowing that he’s a right knobhead to say it.
Albus briefly thinks, that the old Madam Pomfrey must’ve been out of her mind to think they’d be finishing the several dozens of bedpans during this evening, without magic.
Harry is mortified, while Ginny lets out shocked ‘Their
Well, Draco didn’t go back after the war, like some others did. He didn’t graduate from Hogwarts. What he did before he decided to become a Crime Scene Investigator, was taking care of the Malfoy investments and fortune, which didn’t really require a degree.
Albus and Scorpius exchange a look, before Albus turns away, taking a couple steps back towards the castle, swallowing down the frustration and ache that presses against his chest, that twists his stomach. He stills and closes his eyes as Scorpius says his name behind him, as if asking where Albus is going, but at the same time, like he’s merely acknowledging Albus taking his leave.
After James’s arm was fixed by an irate Madam Pomfrey, they received a thorough reprimanding from both their parents and the Headmistress. Albus and James were then directed straight into detention, to scrub out the bedpans in the hospital wing. Without magic.
And then there’s Albus. Harry sighs wearily. Albus’s version actually sounded like it could’ve been the truth, but then again, there is history between him and the victim, there is the party… and then there had been that rather shocking reveal about how other people – witches, mainly – see him, and treat him.
anymore.
Albus sighs. “I don’t know. He wanted to humiliate her in front of everyone. I suppose it was to pay back for the shit she did to me,” he says, and as his parents give him shocked looks, he continues, “James didn’t have any beef with her. He didn’t even know her.”
“I feel responsible, for what Albus feels – the anger inside him, and the stress he’s been put over, because of who I am,” Harry says quietly. “I wish it didn’t have to be like that for him. I wish, sometimes, that I wasn’t the Chosen One.”
Albus wants to scowl at him. Apparently, the only thing his friend is worried about, is what
Zachary, Julian, Cory and Cecil had all been curious to hear why Albus had landed himself into a detention, astonished that their usually calm and collected friend had lost his temper in the most Gryffindorish way. However, after they had heard that Albus had been brawling with his brother, their initial surprise had diminished somewhat. Albus’s friends know quite well that if there is someone Albus has ever lost his temper at, it is his brother.
? It’s the fact that my best friend, and my bloody
“It appears I need you to question my niece as well, Quinn,” Potter says quietly, watching Quinn with a weary look.
“I’ll be back at one for Albus’s questioning,” she informs Harry, before turning in her heels and marching towards the Grand staircase, presumably to see if Lily or her nieces or nephews have a free period.
Harry watches at his Aurors taking in the information, before he clears his throat. “There is no reason to suspect that any of the students we have questioned during the past three days, have something to do with Travers’s death. Albus Potter and Scorpius Malfoy had shared an argument with the victim, but that had been their only contact to her during the train ride. James Potter had not seen Travers at all during the train ride. Nate Riley had spent a short amount of time with Travers, as had Skylar Westen and the Scott sisters. All other students, who had seen Travers during the journey back to Hogwarts, were questioned during the first night and today afternoon, and each of them had seen the victim during the first hours of the trip, either with her friends, her boyfriend Riley, or alone,” Harry explains wearily. “The information we have now, does not point to any specific person. It is likely, that this case –” and Harry grits his teeth as he even thinks of it “– that this case will stay unresolved, for the time being.”
Quinn nods at him. “So, during your Christmas holidays, how did you feel towards her?”
“You wish to question her first?” Neville asks quietly.
Malfoy gasps against Harry's mouth as soon as their hips meet. Harry is breathless and frantic, shuddering as Malfoy's other hand tangles with his hair, while his other hand slides down to rest against Harry's arse. Harry feels feverish when Malfoy tips his chin down to press small, biting kisses onto Harry's jaw and throat.
Draco thinks – asks, staring at him with a questioning look from the seat next to him. “Did you hear what I –” She turns to look at the direction Draco had been looking, and growls under her breath. “For Merlin’s sake!” She grits out and stands up to march towards the group of Weasleys, ordering them to leave Potter alone, reminding them that the longer they prevent him from doing his job, the longer they have to wait to see their children. Granger then asks Potter to go ahead to the meeting room to go over the situation, while she will talk with her husband’s relatives.
Harry sighs, and sees the alarmed looks in Mr and Mrs Travers’s eyes. “But what she didn’t know – what she failed to realise, was when to stop.”
The question had come out of the blue, and Albus had quickly disregarded the sudden feeling of apprehension, telling himself and Scorpius that that wasn’t the case. But it had been. After Scorpius had left back to Wiltshire, Albus had watched his parents, had listened their conversations when they thought no one else was in the room. And he had realised what was happening between his parents. He had felt…betrayed. They had been planning it, agreeing to keep it between them, to lie to Albus, James and Lily.
Scorpius evidently tries to fight against the potion, but in vain, as the answer bursts from his lips a moment after, “She saw Potter and me, upstairs.”
Harry gives an affirmative grunt, trailing a hand through his hair as he turns to watch Moonstone fix them tea. Even though Miss Westen’s story matched Mr Woods’s, something doesn’t seem right. But he doesn’t know what it is. Not yet.
“Let’s go over what we have learnt today, shall we?” Potter says, looking around the room. “Today we questioned Scorpius Malfoy, Pamela Scott, Hazel Scott, Albus Potter, Skylar Westen, Nate Riley, James Potter, and Rose Granger-Weasley. After many inconsistencies in the descriptions of events they gave us, I decided it was needed to question all of them under Veritaserum,” Potter explains, while both Keir and Quinn take notes. “Nate Riley and Pamela Scott were questioned again later today, under Veritaserum, and the rest will be questioned tomorrow.”
Albus and Scorpius exchange a quick glance before they move forward and take their seats; Albus next to his brother, and Scorpius next to his father. Professor Fox moves to the side where Professor Flitwick is already sitting in a chair against the wall.
“I have a theory I want to go through.”
“It’s nothing. Just feeling a bit off, nothing more,” Scorpius murmurs back to his friend, averting his eyes from Albus’s.
Scott lets out a muffled sob.
“What do you think, boss?” Quinn asks, after they’ve questioned both Miss Westen and Mr Riley – for the second time.
“Go to bed, boys.
There’s something off with Potter’s voice, and Draco thinks back to the previous night, when he left the couple to the chamber. Perhaps they’d had an argument, and Weasley had gone back to home. “Trouble in paradise?” He asks half-jokingly, giving Potter a wry look.
He takes a step closer, and then another, moving to stand in front of Malfoy – who stays admiringly still, his eyes tracking Harry’s movements. He’s an inch or two taller than Harry is, he only then notices, and is looking slightly downwards at he stares at Harry.
Albus feels irritated by Scorpius’s dickish behaviour. He moves back to his own bed and watches his friend closely. “And yours.”
Quinn, however, is focused on Rose. “What happened then?”
was the one arguing with Travers and her boyfriend.”
“Hey Scor,” Albus greets his friend at dinner, as Scorpius sits down next to him at their house table.
Harry chews the inside of his cheek. “But it might,” he says slowly, and then lets out a weary sigh.
Draco rolls his eyes inwardly. Unlikely. He just has to figure this out by himself. He needs to speak with his son, in private. He needs to know that Scorpius hasn’t got anything to do with the girl’s death.
“ – Or someone who doesn’t go to this school,” Cecil murmurs, watching Julian’s face intently to take any hints, as said classmate who is one of the fifth year prefects, stands rigidly in front of the teachers' table and listens the instructions from Slughorn.
Before Harry had left the village early in the morning to meet the Headmistress, he had talked with Quinn, and asked if he was going to question James about the party – as he, like Quinn, was aware that there had been alcohol and underage kids involved in the party, and not an adult supervising the get-together; something that could be quite uncomfortable to Harry, should it come to public knowledge – but Quinn had told Harry that he didn’t think it was important to ask about it, as they were more interested to know where James had been during the train ride, if he had seen Travers during it, and, if he had anything to do with her death, or, if he knew anyone who had.
As Harry looks back at Malfoy, he can see there’s something flickering in Malfoy’s gaze. Something close to…curiosity.
Potter stills, pulling his head back slightly to meet Draco’s eyes. His glasses are askew, his pupils blown wide, and his mouth…well, Draco will steer his eyes away from Potter’s delectable mouth, at least for the time being.
Malfoy’s eyes move over Harry’s features. “I take it she was not overjoyed?” He asks, his voice now void of the sharpness, his expression less menacing than it was mere moments ago.
Scorpius huffs with irritation, and Albus can hear movement in the room. “So – what? One mistake and your life is over?” he asks darkly.
Berrycloth goes to the bar to order them some food, while Harry takes a steadying breath before entering the private chamber of the pub.
“Is there anything else that happened during the trip? Or anything else you would like to add?” Harry asks.
Albus lifts his brows at Quinn. “Scorpius told me.” He then sees Quinn looking at his notes again. “Why? What did Scorpius say to you?” Albus asks with suspicion.
Thank you for reading!
“Why?” Quinn continues calmly.
“I don’t know,” Albus says. “She could have.”
Albus’s mother interrupts. “She wanted
What happened, was something Draco hadn’t done before, even though he’s been aware of his…preferences…ever since he was a young boy. What he felt with Potter, he hadn’t felt with others; it was…arousing, and so…
Draco lets out a weary sigh, closing his eyes to centre himself, but flinches when Potter’s stomping feet bring him back only seconds later.
Draco clears his throat. “The scan confirmed my preliminary analysis; A sixteen-year-old girl. Cause of death: blow to the head, resulting a massive blood loss and a traumatic brain injury. No other wounds, damage or bruising elsewhere in her body. Based on body temperature at my arrival, and what could be determined from the scan, the time of death occurred between five thirty and six thirty pm, two days ago – which we now know to be between six and six thirty, based on witness questioning. The sedative levels in her bloodstream were high; most likely Calming Draught – however,” Draco says, pausing, glancing at his notes, “Those tend to be more difficult to recognise after certain amount of time.”
Ten minutes later, Potter arrives again, alone this time, a small frown between his brows. Time, during which Draco has identified the preliminary cause of death; traumatic brain injury, along with the fact that every speck of blood in the compartment is from the girl. He thinks it is rather curious.
“Where’s Quinn?” Potter, who has schooled his features into a serious expression, asks from the grumpy one – Keir, Draco thinks.
“Calming Draught or the Draught of Peace are the most probable potions; both of which are used in Psychopharmacology, and with an abnormal measure those could cause a similar result to what was found in the blood analysis,” Draco clarifies.
“…Draco?” Granger –
It is quite different from what it was when Dumbledore had been there. Bittersweet memories lift their head in the far corner of his mind as Harry takes in the room; all the peculiar trinkets and apparatuses are gone, replaced by practical bookshelves and chests of drawers. There’s a seating area in front of the fireplace, occupied by McGonagall who looks very tired, and very devastated looking man and woman. The man with dark short hair and pointy nose is not much older than Harry is, while the woman who is blonde and willowy, is definitely younger.
, Albus, you know that,” he murmurs, and then glances at Scorpius before he clears his throat.
McGonagall smiles sympathetically at Harry. “Good night, Harry.”
Hermione nods. “We both know there will not be anything crucial found by questioning Albus again,” she says, giving Harry a small smile. “The boy doesn’t have a dishonest bone in his body…”
His father trails a hand through his hair, “You say you dated her months ago, but then you invited her into a party not two weeks ago?”
“May I suggest that you carry out the questioning in the offices of the Head of House? Meanwhile, I would like to keep one of your Aurors in each house common room, just in case,” McGonagall says.
, Al?” James says, with such an infuriating meaningfulness, that Albus wants to hex him again, and again, until the fucker in front of him will stay quiet.
Harry gives Bones a nod. “Anything to report?”
“They’re not.” Harry says promptly. He gives her a meaningful look, before glancing at Ron and Rose. “Let’s get this over with, yeah?”
Malfoy lets out a muffled sigh against the junction of Harry’s neck, thrusting against him – and Harry shudders as he can finally feel the hard line of Malfoy’s cock through his robes.
A moment later, Harry watches from the back of the classroom, as Rose’s hands shake when she tips down the vial of Veritaserum, and watches, as Quinn begins to question her as he did with James and Scorpius earlier.
Malfoy arches a brow at him. “It appears that I am.” His voice is snarky, and Harry walks up to him, still frowning at the other man.
“The Headmistress is with Miss Travers’s parents, expecting us there shortly. I have been in touch with the school governors, and asked them to inform the students’ families about the…incident. There will evidently be concerned parents arriving to the village tomorrow,” He says, and glances at Bones, Keir and Quinn before moving his eyes back to Harry. “Shall we?”
Hermione worries her lip before she shakes her head. “We don’t know what you are up against. Harry –” She says and gives him a frightened look. “What if –”
“Both Mr Flint and Miss Hawthrone – the fifth-year Slytherin Prefects – spoke about a New Year’s party that occurred at your house,” He says, and Potter visibly stiffens.
Malfoy’s both hands stop at Harry’s shoulders. He pulls back slightly. “What
Harry groans, leaning forward, pressing the heels of his palms against his forehead, while resting his elbows at his knees, his fingers tangled into his hair. “You knew when you hired him, knew when you assigned him…”
“I want to know exactly what went through your heads when you organised a party at my house, and failed to ask permission for it,” is what he starts with, and Albus can almost hear the groan James must be doing inwardly.
Scott looks…disappointed. For someone, who is...
Potter then clears his throat and looks at the others. “There is something else,” Potter says, chewing the inside of his cheek as he flicks his wand at the book on the table.
“Albus,” Pamela Scott calls quietly, lurking in the dungeon corridor.
As he steps into the dark platform, surrounded by trees and the Hogwarts Express that stands eerily still, the handful of streetlamps reveal someone standing there. That someone is in the middle of the station, leaning against the stretch of a wall separating the couple of buildings from the platform.
Potter frowns at his wife. “Didn’t Hermione call you?”
Moonstone is immaculately dressed, as always, his brown hair neatly done, but his owlish features now darkened with seriousness. Harry nods at the man. “Moonstone.”
know that the
Potter turns to look at Draco over his shoulder. “Yeah?” He asks, lifting his brows in question.
“…Draco.” Potter whispers, and
Potter is quiet for a moment, chewing the corner of his lips, before he speaks again. “I don’t even know why I’m telling you all of this…” He says, his voice hesitant, as is his expression, when he looks up and gives Draco a long, somewhat intense look.
“Good,” Quinn says, and then glances at his papers. “Do you know why we are here?”
? What the bloody hell is going on in here?” She nearly shrieks, and as Draco glances at the woman, he can see her face lined with tear tracks.
“You organised a party, where you apparently had a dispute with the girl who was possibly killed on your train ride back to school?” Their father continues starkly, his eyes blazing.
“Potter…?” Malfoy asks quietly, but doesn’t say more, doesn’t object, as Harry steps into his space, so close that their thighs are touching. The air is charged, compressed between them.
“Perhaps, now you understand,
Neville gives him an understanding nod. “And I will stay here until Leonard returns,” he says kindly. “Do you know where his office is?”
without consulting him first, and then, keep something like that – and keep something as big as fancying men – from Albus, is…outrageous. He bristles at the thought, feeling betrayed, his mind still in a haze, his stomach still somewhat nauseous, his eyes still stinging – which he thinks is probably some after effect of the potion – and finally steps into the common room. Scorpius is nowhere to be seen.
Albus shakes his head, giving his father an incredulous look. “I know. I was with him then. And I believe
There’s still Albus, and after that, Harry can focus again. When Albus’s questioning is over, after the Veritaserum has removed any possible suspicion towards Harry’s younger son, they’re back in the beginning. This time, however, Harry will be glad to have been wasting two days, if he can prove that the suspicions towards his children can be removed.
Instead they talk about other things; how his mother has managed to get a full interview - with all the sordid details - out of a famous and previously somewhat aloof Quidditch star; a piece she was working on somewhere in Europe.
Does Scorpius know something about Travers’s death? Surely, he would tell Albus if he did - they tell each other everything. Albus knows everything about his friend. He knows about Scorpius’s childhood, his relationship with his dad, and how Scorpius still misses his mother. He knows what annoys Scorpius the most, and how to calm him down. Scorpius has spent so much time with Albus and Albus’s family during the past few years, that it is like he’s one of Albus’s siblings. Except he is not his brother. Definitely not. Still, Scorpius doesn’t keep secrets from Albus. Hell, Albus even knows the girls his friend has fancied during the past years – not that Scorpius has had the courage to ask anyone out – and the fact that his friend hasn’t kissed anyone.
A small frown takes place between her brows, and she looks away, her eyes moving from one goal-post to another.
The Aurors mutter their agreements.
Albus narrows his eyes at his friend. What
Potter definitely wants to ask more but manages to stifle the urge and nods at Draco to continue.
Harry walks up to Albus and Scorpius, who both haven’t moved an inch.
Harry thinks over Riley’s answers, and something – like in Westen’s case – is bothering him, but he is not sure what it is. He has the feeling that Riley had left something unsaid. Riley was probably the last person to see Miss Travers alive, but if he spent the last forty-five minutes of the train ride in the company of his friends, it could be possible that there was someone else who saw the girl after he did. For now, he knows he cannot press further without upsetting both the student and Moonstone. He needs to go over the results from other Aurors who are questioning the Prefects, and if indeed they do not find anything, he will have to approach Riley’s parents to get the permission to question him under Veritaserum.
And Albus, he doesn’t object – not even though they are in the middle of an empty Entrance Hall, where anyone could see them. He leans against his father’s side, briefly marvelling how familiar and safe he feels. And for a moment, he closes his eyes, wishing he would be a young boy again, wishing that the world – his world – would be like he remembers it had been when he was younger.
Harry frowns, knowing that they’d better find something soon to eliminate the threat. There are too many people who
Potter lets out a deep sigh, his gaze fixed at Draco. “It seems that we need to question Miss Westen and Mr Riley again. And probably the Scott sisters as well.”
was different. But he was proved wrong, in the most painful and embarrassing way. The thrill of snogging the boy who looks like the Saviour, is apparently, quite remarkable. Scorpius’s words, not Albus’s, he reckons.
that he shouldn’t be saying these things to Scorpius, and that he should be the bloody friend Scorpius deserves, but the ache in his chest and the tightness in his throat forces it out, and Albus feels powerless.
...Also, I'd like to know what you guys think of this story so far...Who do you think did it?  ;)
Unsurprisingly, the parents had been shocked, and had not considered that as a possibility – that their name could have been the reason to what had happened to their daughter. Potter had also asked them if their daughter had had access to any sedative potions, as there had been a high dose found in her bloodstream. Mr and Mrs Travers had been adamant as they had told Potter that their daughter wouldn’t have had access to those potions in her home.
Albus swallows hard. Of course, there bloody well was. Still is, some days. But…can he be mad to his own father, for being the Saviour? For making a better future for everyone? In his own mind, he can, and he was. But not – not so much anymore. He’s tired of being angry about it, because it will not likely change. Albus will always look like his father. He will always be his father’s son. The saviour’s son. And he will always be outshined by James. And if that doesn’t make him sound fucked up, he doesn’t know what will.
to take back. That one night at the Leaky Cauldron – possibly the only time Draco has been out after Astoria’s death, and possibly the first time in his life he has been three sheets to the wind drunk. Potter was there; he found Draco from the corner table, where he was nursing his fifth – perhaps it was the tenth – drink in the completely packed pub.
Malfoy blinks quickly a couple of times, but his expression stays impassive otherwise, as he looks at Harry. “It would be highly unprofessional. Not to mention, unwise, all things considered…”
Draco suppresses a whine, and instead grabs Potter by his shoulders, digging his fingers into the tense muscles.
“Well, I wasn’t sure if you two could keep your hands away from each other, considering what happened the last time you met,” Hermione says to Draco in a saccharine tone, her smile wide.
have had some impact on Potter’s ‘problems in paradise’? And if so, can Draco expect to be murdered in his sleep now that he’s left the safety of his Manor’s wards?
“Was the brief encounter in the compartment the last time you saw Miss Travers?” Harry continues.
Riley is tall and well-built; a bloke who seems like he would be popular among other students. But as he sits in the armchair, Harry reckons he looks rather weak…like he’s lost.
“Was it Travers?” Albus whispers, and Harry barely suppresses a flinch.
Malfoy gapes at Harry for a moment, and then scowls at him. “You utter imbecile.” He growls, before shoving him away. “You realise what I said merely moments ago, about this –” He hisses, gesturing between them “– being entirely inappropriate.” He lifts his brows at Harry, who now feels a wave of embarrassment flicker through him under Malfoy’s hard stare.
James straightens up, and then turns, watching Harry with a hesitant look. “I’m sorry, dad,” is what James has decided to start with, and Harry groans inwardly, already knowing it is nothing good.
Harry looks at Malfoy, sees the closed expression on his face, and wonders, how strained Malfoy’s and his son’s relationship actually is.
?!” She nearly snarls, her eyes turning cold as soon as she sees who it is. “What do you want, Malfoy?” She asks tersely.
Rose rolls her eyes. “Dad – when have I been something else than good?” She asks, innocently.
“Not really. She dated my brother a while back, and dumped him in front of everyone after getting what she wanted,” James says indifferently.
the girl not six months ago, and James had invited her to his place during the holidays. Draco himself hadn’t even heard of the girl before, even though he thinks her family must be one of the Sacred Twenty-Eight. But apparently his and Potter’s children did know Miss Travers. Apparently, they knew her well.
Albus shakes his head again, and doesn’t look at Scorpius. He leaves the room, before he says something hurtful.
Cory snorts, shaking his head, while both Scorpius and Albus snigger, all of them knowing that their friend’s description of their classmate is quite accurate.
Draco glances at Potter; he looks quite authoritative with his perfectly tailored Auror robes, and the most serious expression. Potter looks nothing like the flustered and breathless version of him from this morning in the hallway. He looks nothing like the anxious boy from his school years, and nothing like he had been two years ago, the last time Draco has talked to him before yesterday.
“Scor?” Albus asks, and frowns as Scorpius walks closer to him, but doesn’t actually look at Albus.
Draco eyes Potter’s reddened face, those innocent wide eyes, and the disbelief in them. Still, after all these years, after being the
is in fact single?!” She yells, and as she does so, the door to Moonstone’s office opens, and Malfoy steps in.
Albus and James glance at each other, before sitting down. However, their father doesn’t. Instead, he starts pacing behind his chair.
As Keir starts to summarise his interviews; the Head Girl and six Prefects – including two more of Potter’s nieces – Draco is somewhat amazed Potter hasn’t brought up the book yet, as it does concern one of his nieces. He watches Potter carefully as Keir goes through the information he received – nearly all of them
Quinn’s eyes flicker back to his notes. “The party at the Potter house? What did she see?”
Draco clears his throat, glancing at the notes he has stacked neatly in front of him. “Sixteen-year-old girl, found in the train compartment with a severe penetrating blow to the head, resulting a massive blood loss and a traumatic brain injury; which I have confirmed to be the cause of death. Based on the body temperature, time of death is approximately between five-thirty and six-thirty pm,” he says, glancing at the timepiece on the wall, “yesterday, on January ninth.”
Harry nods slowly, wondering what else Malfoy needed to think, besides the obvious murder inspection. “Scorpius?” He asks hesitantly, knowing that he’s right when he sees Malfoy’s lips twitch into a rueful smile.
There’s a shocked silence, as the arrivals take in the situation. Then…
Albus sighs wearily, knowing there’s nothing he can say about it, knowing that everything he wants to say, would be a very dickish thing to say, to both James and Scorpius. Because, deep down, Albus knows that James wouldn’t – he wouldn’t do anything, if Albus said he’d minded.
Travers – and even during the holidays, Scorpius wasn’t his normal self.
!” Weasley – Ginevra – bursts through the door, and makes her way swiftly towards her husband, throwing herself straight into his arms. Draco then remembers disappointingly that her last name is
Scorpius nods, walking into the room without even glancing at his father or Harry. Malfoy follows him and looks at Harry for a split second, right as he walks past him.
Keir sits down next to Draco. “He’ll be here soon. Was with Moonstone and the Head Boy when we left, going through the last of his interviews,” the man grunts.
“Potter.” Draco says stiffly.
Harry apparates home late in the afternoon, after saying his goodbyes to his children. As soon as he sees the familiar sitting room materialising around him, he checks the wards – a habit that is integrated deeply into his daily life, after witnessing so many break-ins to other people’s homes during his long career as an Auror. However, nothing is out of order – not that Harry was expecting it to be, knowing that his wards are rather impenetrable.
Potter narrows his eyes, but his cheeks tinge slightly with red. He licks his lips before stating calmly. “Of course. What have you got?”
be in danger, and too few to protect them, as most of the students are underage.
Draco swallows hard, and sees Potter’s eyes following the movement on Draco’s throat.
“How did she take it?” Quinn asks.
He feels overwhelmed already, even though the night is only beginning, and he knows that it will be several hours before he can even dream of catching a bit of sleep.
Harry chews the inside of his cheek in thought. They really need to tell their children about their separation. They planned to, during the holidays, if not for Ginny’s unanticipated business trip that conveniently took place right after Christmas and is still continuing. And Harry wasn’t going to do it alone, certainly not. But the fact remains that he and Ginny haven’t been living together for quite some time and haven’t been a couple for even longer.
Albus’s eyes move from James who seems confused and a bit shocked, to Scorpius who sits rigidly in place looking like he’s going to chunder at any moment, to his cousin Rose who trembles under the protective arm her father has thrown over her shoulders, looking terrified. Albus tries to think if one of them could’ve done it, but he can’t. He can’t even picture it happening by accident.
Harry wonders if the dispute Moonstone had heard had also been about Albus.
“Hey Al,” Julian says from the couch near the fire, where he’s sitting with Cory and Cecil.
Quinn’s eyes flicker momentarily to Albus’s father. “When you dated her, you mean?” He asks calmly from Albus.
Ginny cries, looking appalled and speechless. “How can you speak to – to
Potter hums thoughtfully, and then glances at him. “Cast a locking spell at it.”
“ – Can we – “
Mr Malfoy gives him a strained smile. “Just
it was closer to Hogsmeade then, but that he definitely met his girlfriend briefly, before the train reached to Hogsmeade.
“Nate Riley,” Mr Travers says, his voice hoarse. “Nate and – and Jenna. They were dating.”
He wants to think ‘good riddance’, since the girl was nothing but a mean and selfish bint who used people for her own gain. Who used him. But since he is not a horrible person, he feels bad especially for the girl’s friends and family. And if someone actually killed her, well, that is even more concerning. They could have a murderer on the loose.
Albus is too stunned by the recent events to point out how odd Scorpius appears. He feels angered. He feels exasperated. He stomps towards his bed and tells his friend about Scott.
Scott frowns at Albus, and then gives him a small shrug.
Albus thinks with mild annoyance. He watches absently as his brother, his cousin Fred and their friend Jordan howl in laughter, while their classmates sit next to them, shaking their heads with amusement. Bitterness flares in the bottom of his stomach as he thinks how his brother had managed to screw things up for him.
– and that is really the only term for the bloke, Harry thinks; a bloke who is in his early thirties – Mark. Mark is a French Wizarding Genealogist. Harry had to look that up from the Ministry library, since he wasn’t aware wizards had such professions. Apparently, Wizarding Genealogists trace and keep records of a family lineage in the Ministry of Magic Records Room. Only, Mark is employed by the British Ministry of Magic, keeping records of the British wizards and witches who have French ancestry. Harry remains that that is the most boring job he has ever heard of.
Scorpius, who is crouched over the nightstand between their beds and is in the middle of rummaging through his books visibly flinches, his grey eyes quickly darting around the room behind him. Albus too glances at the others; Zachary’s is in the bathroom, Cory and Cecil are both already in their beds, curtains closed. Julian – who had told them everything about the interrogation, and confirmed that it was Travers who died, thirty minutes earlier – is sitting cross-legged on his bed, furthest to Albus’s and Scorpius’s, and writing to his parents.
But he doesn’t. Instead, he stands quietly, not really answering to his mother with more than one or two words in form of grunts when she continues to grill him about his school work, his future plans and so on. Hazel comes out of the room, and then it’s Pamela’s turn. Time crawls forward in a snail’s pace, and finally Pamela Scott and her parents walk to the Entrance Hall.
Albus quickly turns and sees Professor Fox, a tall man with wavy black hair and severe eyebrows – the Head of Gryffindor and their Defence professor – standing there, his hands clasped behind his back.
Albus frowns deeply at Quinn. “No.”
Scott seems embarrassed. “I – I told them that you were there, but, um…”
“Yeah?” Harry mutters, his mind already going through the possible threats they might confront. He glances at Quinn, whose grim expression doesn’t falter as he speaks to his boss.
“It’s James,” Albus says, finally, his face red, as if he has tried to stop himself from saying it.
Every quill is scratching violently, as Harry continues speaking. “Which means, that the time of death, as well as the blow to the head had happened between six and six thirty pm, possibly only moments after Rose Granger-Weasley left her compartment.”
Quinn gives Draco a strained look. “According to Scott, less than two hours before the train arrived Hogsmeade.”
Quinn watches Albus carefully, before he speaks. “You said she threatened to reveal your personal and confidentially told information to others. How did you feel about that?”
Harry nods again. “Let’s get this over with,” he grunts, and steps inside, feeling nervous and concerned.
A moment later, Albus notices that Scorpius is even more aloof than he typically is. Albus knows that chatting with others is more his thing than Scorpius’s, he knows that while Scorpius does get along with others, he usually prefers to stay quiet and listen, watching the participants carefully. Albus often wonders if his friend is feeling lonely sometimes, as he hasn’t seen Scorpius really spend time with anyone else but him.
“I should go,” Draco mutters, saving them both from the uncomfortable silence. He glances at Potter, sees the somewhat desperate look in his eyes. Draco’s not sure how to interpret it, but he has a vague idea what Potter is on about. “…It is best not to mention this to anyone,” he adds, before murmuring a quiet, ‘excuse me,’ and slipping out of the room quickly and silently.
But it hadn’t meant anything. Albus is nothing more than a friend to Scorpius. And now Albus is not sure if he is even that.
“Yes, I did. To change into my robes, as did my friends,” Scorpius says immediately.
was the reason he was going to be questioned – not because he dated the witch.
Harry blinks at her, feeling resigned and angered at the same time. “I’m not the one who spends half of their holidays in
Draco watches Weasley take in the news, the confusion and then the dread taking over his expression, but for some reason, he doesn’t feel a bit derisive towards the ginger-headed third of the Golden Trio. He watches Weasley to make a number of floocalls as well, and wonders, if he should be informing someone about his son’s situation. He already knows the answer
Fox gestures at the hallway behind them, “Shall we go, then?”
“I did hear Miss Travers bickering with Mr Riley in front of my office, before the holidays,” He says slowly.
Harry follows James’s gaze, and sees Malfoy and Scorpius, standing against the wall near them, both looking tensely at the floor.
Scorpius stops in his tracks, and turns to gape at Albus. “W-What?”
Riley shrugs. “I went to hang out with my dorm mates – Tristan and Carter – for the rest of the trip.”
Rose frowns at him, shaking her head. “No. Jenna and Albus – they broke up a long time ago, and ignored each other afterwards. James shouldn’t have said those things to her.”
Scorpius blinks and swallows hard. “Yeah. I’m fine,” he grunts, looking away.
, he thinks, “– what you just said.” He finishes, feeling quite uncomfortable.
Albus looks back blankly. “Yes. A friend. In case you’ve missed the fact during the past five years?”
But now, his friend is not even pretending to listen to his classmates, and lets his gaze trail over the Great Hall; with worry and annoyance mixing in his features.
“I – I have to go,” Albus mutters, turning away from Scorpius.
Albus doesn’t need to ask more questions, and Scorpius doesn’t have to say anything – Albus can see it from his friend’s expression. Because he knows Scorpius.
Quinn doesn’t say anything, but his lips twitch slightly upwards.
Albus feels anger and dread mix in the bottom of his stomach. “Shit…shit, shit shit…fuck!” He curses, and Scott flinches.
He lets out a long breath, knowing that it is going to be a long day.
Draco doesn’t even know how to take Potter’s explanation. Sure, Weasley knowing is not something Draco had been wishing, since, well, probably her whole family knows by now, and as it is the Weasley family, Draco does not have high hopes for discretion. But…Potter doesn’t seem to – to regret it, does he?
They walk the rest of the way in silence, until they reach the gargoyle, and all Albus can think of is what Fox might have heard from his and Scorpius’s argument. Fox gives the password, and then they take the stairs up before stepping into the Headmistress’s office.
Draco shakes his head slightly and resumes his inspection. He is not daft;
Keir shakes his head slightly, still taking notes, and Potter then proceeds to go over Hazel Scott’s and Skylar Westen’s questionings; as both Westen and Hazel Scott had left unmentioned the incidence in the train corridor between Albus, Scorpius and Travers, they too will be questioned under Veritaserum the next day.
Riley starts to explain the events, from the moment he stepped on the train, to the moment he met his girlfriend; during which he chokes down a sob. He continues after a moment to describe how he spent time with his other friends – Harry asks what the time was then, and if it was closer to Hogsmeade or London. Riley tells him that he
Albus muffles a cry of pain, and as James actually pauses to see if Albus is really hurt, the Slytherin in him sends a quick levitation charm, before throwing James sideways against the wall with a sickening crunch.
He finds James thirty minutes later, walking towards the Gryffindor Tower. At least, Albus thinks, he’s not accompanied by his girlfriend, knowing it’ll make what Albus intends to do a bit simpler.
Draco nods slowly, and then starts to speak, but so does Potter.
“Malfoy,” Potter says quietly, falling into step with Draco.
“Do you know anyone who would know what happened to Travers?”
underage wizards and witches?!”
Draco wants to roll his eyes, but settles for an unimpressed raised eyebrow. Of course, he thinks.
“Scor…” James whispers with a weary sigh.
He walks to the castle, and doesn’t look back, even though he wants – even though he wants to run back and demand both James and Scorpius to say it aloud, to tell him what the hell is going on, so that he can prepare himself for what will happen. Instead, he runs into his dad as soon as he steps into the Entrance Hall.
Their gasps fill the quiet and dark room, and Draco feels euphoric, as Potter returns to suck the skin below his jaw, all the while bringing Draco closer and closer to the most intense ecstasy. Too long has Draco thought of it, reminisced it – the night at the pub, and Potter’s touch and taste. And now that he has it, now that the emptiness has been filled, and Potter is there with all his attention on Draco, allowing him to finally
Harry lets out a quiet sigh of relief. Rose doesn’t know anyone who would know anything about Travers’s death either, as Quinn asks it from her next.
Draco then explains the results of the post-mortem-scan that had been performed to Travers’s body. He tells the others, that no other magical signatures had been detected, except her own. The scan confirmed the cause of death; blow to the head, resulting a massive blood loss and a traumatic brain injury. The scan hadn’t really revealed information they hadn’t been already aware of; the morgue confirmed that the sedative levels were high, and based on the laboratory examination of a sample of Travers’s blood, the sedative was most likely Calming Draught.
Quinn gives Albus a tight smile. “I’m afraid I cannot speak about it.” He glances at his notes, and then back at Albus. “How would you describe your relationship with Scorpius?”
have this much dirt on others?
“Amongst the spells Miss Travers had cast with her wand that day, were two Vanishing spells, before the last spell Miss Travers had cast; a Locking spell to the door,” Harry explains. “Vanishing spells, that were likely used to vanish the vials of the potion.”
Draco thinks, how good his name sounds coming from between Potter’s lips, and he remembers vividly the last time Potter had called him by his first name – when Potter’s dick had been buried deep in Draco’s throat in the dirty toilet of Leaky Cauldron, right before Potter had exploded in bliss.
“What?” Potter asks quickly, his eyes moving across Draco’s face, searching for something.
They sit in silence for a long moment.
There are some questions, some arguments that are discussed; if it was a suicide – to which Travers’s last spell nor the way she had died do not point; or if an outsider had gone to her right after the train had reached Hogsmeade – which would’ve been noticed by the train wards. Wards, that are put up by the Headmistress herself. Harry knows it
“I’m sorry,” Potter finally says, moving his gaze to Draco, who feels a small twitch in the back of his neck for being under the intense stare of the pair of bright green eyes.
the otter speaks in Hermione’s voice.
Harry frowns at Lily. “Of course. Of course, I’ll be okay. And so will your mum.”
come forward. And questioning everyone who saw Travers yesterday, could take days – there could be hundreds of people who saw even a glimpse of her. Albus starts to fill his plate, still somewhat bothered by the questioning looming ahead and what he already endured with his father.
Indeed, his father and brother sit there, along with his cousin Rose and her father.
Malfoy is there, with a handful of parchments scattered over the table. He lifts his head up, his gaze dropping at Harry, and Harry sees a deep frown between his pale brows. And now that Harry has more time and patience to actually look at the other man, he sees that only a little has changed since he last saw the blonde Slytherin; his hair is short and stylishly cut, his skin is as pale as ever, and his robes look expensive and sleek. However, there’s a smudge of ink on his temple, and more on the tips of his fingers. He must have been scribbling his notes furiously after returning to the pub. Harry swallows hard, calming himself, forcing himself to stay cool and politely distant.
“…You’re saying the post-mortem-scan did not reveal any other magical signatures but Miss Travers’s?”
Last night, all kinds of thoughts were filling his mind; mostly those featuring plans to make sure his son is kept out of harm’s way. But there was something else as well…
Was it really so? Or is Scorpius lying to Albus? He tries to remember exactly what happened; the words, the expressions, the tones of voices…
Which Harry thinks is not actually the truth, since he floocalled Moonstone only the previous week – but, they haven’t seen each other
Potter stares at Draco for a long moment.
“Dad, it was just a party,” James says coolly, and Albus cringes.
Scorpius nods and swallows hard.
“Malfoy,” Weasley says blankly, turning slightly towards him, still keeping a tight grip on Potter’s other arm.
this, Albus.” He says pointedly, and Albus’s cheeks go slightly red for being chastised.
Malfoy doesn’t continue, so Harry speaks about his sons, hoping it would help Malfoy to open up to him a bit more, thinking it would help the blonde Slytherin, as Harry is quite certain Malfoy hasn’t spoken to anyone about him and his son.
prefers men, who the bloody hell is he kidding?
Ginny whirls towards the door. “
Before Harry could realise something had gone terribly wrong, Malfoy had grabbed his plate and left, disappearing upstairs. Even Isolt seemed to give him a stink eye as he stayed loyally on Malfoy’s shoulder.
Teddy was still holding the golden snitch plushie from before. Andromeda was cooking away in the kitchen, singing the Cauldron Full of Hot Strong Love with obvious disdain.
Since then, everything started to look up. Even though opening the shop was so hard, everyone glaring and wary of the ‘Death Eater,’ his teacher never gave up on him
Harry took the stairs all the way down. His mind was racing with mindless thoughts, as if everything he’d been pushing down was begging for release. A headache started to form, like he was miles underwater.
“Oh Merlin, is that tikka masala?” Harry asked as he moved to sit down on the chair opposite Malfoy.
Nott and Goyle, two Slytherins that he could only recall as being unpleasant. But he did remember their distance in 8th year, how they never started fights or followed anyone blindly. Their walls were higher than ever last time he saw them, just as all Slytherins had been. Except maybe for Malfoy, Parkinson and Zabini.
Then an idea popped into his mind. Isolt looked at him questioningly, her head tilted to the side.
Harry walked back into the shop to talk to Malfoy before going back to that damn desk. The shop was quieter now, less crowded, and no broken things in sight.
“By the way, why do you call Andromeda ‘Andromeda?’ Isn’t she your grandma?”
He groaned into his arms as he tried even harder to think. He could go downstairs and ask Malfoy, but then he’d definitely make fun of him for calling Isolt like that. Harry decided he wasn’t ready for that again, remembering the duel from last night.
Malfoy held up a hand to stop the beginning of Harry’s word vomit. “A few years ago, you wanted to teach me. So you did.”
Under a stasis charm, the food awaited patiently for Harry. He looked around for Isolt, but she was nowhere to be found. However, the window was open, and he knew how smart owls were. He tried to quell the tiny bit of worry for Isolt, and started eating breakfast.
5 years gone, disappeared, obliviated.
During Malfoy’s apprenticeship, his research began to expand into the world of muggle science, in particular to biochemistry. That’s why there were many muggle science books on the shelves. He found ways to make potions a little easier to brew, last longer, and act faster. It took him a long time to do so, but he gained the confidence to tell his teacher, who gave him the confidence boost Malfoy needed to open shop.
Harry closed his eyes, and breathed deeply. The back of his eyes began to ache slightly from the sudden crying, and he clenched his fists over and over again to try and release some tension.
Harry closed the door behind him, and walked out of those Ministry doors in no better state than when he entered.
He walked in with a purpose, a bounce in his strut. The feeling of the familiar auror authority from a lifetime ago surrounded him. The receptionist didn’t even glance his way as he continued on straight to Kingsley’s office.
As Harry approached him, holding out the takeaway food, he realised that this break was the first to truly feel like one.
while he… well, he had almost nothing but the friends and family he knew would never leave him. It should be enough, right? So why did Harry still feel so jealous of everyone, even himself.
“We know it’s used, but we have to know
When he finished, it was silent. Malfoy hadn’t said a word, nor had he moved. Harry started picking at the carpet underneath him, leaning against the couch. He didn’t look at Malfoy at all.
The food comes a few minutes later with a smiling Lara and a wink. They all thank her, and she jokingly bows like an inside joke. The only reason Harry laughs is because he really wasn’t expecting it. It made no difference though, Lara still didn’t think anything had changed. The small idea started to grow.
Harry grabbed his wallet and paid while his friends got their food. They decided not to walk back to Malfoy’s shop yet when they saw two more overly energetic kids enter.
over the room. He thought that maybe he should run before he finds out what’s going on. But when his eyes landed on Pansy again, he was frozen with the ice she held in her gaze.
Harry looked at Parkin and Zabini with curiosity and uncertainty. “Let’s go to the back.”
“That life was
“Could be…” She said, uncertain.
They all nodded. Harry was thankful he didn’t need to answer. He didn’t remember Lara at all, and he thought maybe, just maybe, if he stayed here a little longer then something would come back.
Harry, with a heavy heart, realised just how much time had passed.
Throughout those days, he had made no progress on the Lia Adwin case. He even began to look into the other case files on his desk, but none interested him as much as Adwin’s file. Sometimes it felt like he was just reading the same things over and over again from every angle but the right one.
“It’s amazing, don’t get me wrong. But why- how-” Harry struggled to ask the question.
Pansy nodded then put down her food. Blaise was silent, watching. “They told me it didn’t have my signature flair. Said it was more like…” Pansy looked right into Harry’s eyes. There was no malice, or hatred, or accusation, she just looked. “A lie.”
“Is it true you sucked at potions?”
For a moment, Harry could just
He couldn’t have stopped the sudden onslaught of laughter even if he wanted to. He felt it shoot up from the bottom of his feet to the top of his chest. It lasted about 5 straight minutes, and through it all, Isolt stayed perched proudly on his head.
“I almost lost you to the aurors.” Malfoy whispered.
It was different from before, it was hopeful. Malfoy got up, leaving their dishes on the table, and started walking up the stairs.
“Oh, I bet Draco went on and on about what a matchmaker he is,” Harry joked, trying to get used to the way Draco felt on his tongue.
“Mum and dad were the
Looking around, he realised a lot of the people he was most anxious to meet weren’t there. Theodore Nott and Gregory Goyle were nowhere to be found. Pansy Parkinson was talking to a very intrigued Hermione. Harry heard from Arthur that Blaise Zabini would be coming late due to some happenings at work. Neville Longbottom was there, talking to Ron about Hogwarts.
One of Draco’s eyebrows lifts up. “Oh? Do tell.” He drawls in a narked manner, as if he’s offended that there were any doubts regarding his or Harry’s professionalism in the first place.
Potter gives the food a longing look before evidently deciding that work needs to be done first, as he squares his shoulders and tells the others to sit down. “Let’s start without Quinn. What have we got?” He asks from everyone, then nods at Draco to start. “Malfoy?”
Potter groans, breathing heavily against Draco’s neck, and then makes a quick work of opening Draco’s trousers, before shoving his hand inside them. The next moment, Potter proceeds to squeeze his half-hard cock to achingly hard while leaning his forehead against Draco’s shoulder.
“Don’t ‘Gin’ me, Harry!” Ginny hisses, “This is on us! We should’ve been there, and not let our jobs come before our children!” She says, her voice anxious. “There wouldn’t have been any parties on New Year’s, and we might’ve learned about Albus’s troubles long ago…”
As they step into the Entrance Hall, Harry greets Professor Moonstone – the Head of Hufflepuff house. The girl was one of the students in his house.
Harry places his hand against Malfoy’s shoulder, watching his reaction, his throat tight. He watches Malfoy’s every movement very carefully, as he lets his hand slide upwards, his fingers moving, touching Malfoy’s neck, and the line of his jaw, brushing the corner of his lips with his thumb.
“Headmistress,” Harry greets McGonagall with a grim smile. “Neville,” he adds. “Good to see you.”
“And we will proceed with Berrycloth, Fungbury, Keir and Quinn–” He says, nodding his head at the four more experienced Aurors,” – to Hogsmeade village, station and the train with me. The rest of you; Peele, Prone, Bones, Smith, Higgins, Bletchley, Walter and Parkinson – you will be inside the school and on school grounds. Peakes and Figg will cover the Office.”
James gives him an incredulous look. “Why would you care?”
A group of girls leaves the common room, towards their dormitories, and they are followed by a handful of boys.
“Do you have anything to do with Jenna Travers’s death?” Quinn asks, for the third time today.
Scorpius glances at Albus. “I’ll talk to you later,” he mutters, and then walks towards the Slytherin house, not stopping to wait for his father.
His father frowns at him. “Answer me, Albus.”
The Aurors start to emerge from the lifts and the Auror office fireplace that is connected to one of the ones in the Atrium.
Harry gives him an agreeing gesture to lead the way, and Moonstone does so. “Longbottom is keeping company to one of your Aurors stationed in my house,” Moonstone explains as they take a detour from the Entrance hall, slipping behind a tapestry and making their way through the narrow passage towards upstairs.
have an argument with Miss Travers, possibly around the time of her death. What was that about? And Albus – he
Both Albus and Scorpius grumble something close to “G’night,” under their breaths, and drag themselves towards the boys’ dormitory. Harry waits until the door closes, before he gives Parkinson a nod and leaves the Slytherin common room.
Harry nods at the incoming witches and wizards and waits patiently for ten minutes, until all fourteen Aurors he summoned have arrived. A silver otter floats through the back wall before he has a chance to say anything.
James stares at the floor with a strained look. “I’m not proud of what I said. But, what he did to Albus – “
He lets out a wheezing huff and stammers incoherently, “You! She – she said – and, and – bloody fuck!” Potter growls, trailing a hand over his unruly mop of hair. “You’re the bloody crime scene investigator!”
The silence stretches between them, but neither of them speaks. Draco knows, that Potter’s mind is on the case again as he sees the same look of concentration, the same ambition in Potter’s eyes, that Draco knows has shone from his own every time he’s been absorbed in his work. He doesn’t disturb Potter.
he thinks, as Potter’s eyes stop at Draco’s lips before he looks up into his eyes again.
Malfoy arches a brow at him, putting more distance between them – at least, as much as he can, since he’s pressed between Harry and the wall. “What about?”
Rose, how could anyone – if someone is behind this – if someone has done it on purpose –“
Mrs Travers gasps, while McGonagall gives Harry a contemplative look.
Quinn introduces himself – kind of unnecessary, as both Albus and his mother have met the guy before – and then explains how the investigation will go forward. He tells them that they do not have any suspects yet, and that they are only hoping to get as much information about the train ride and the victim – Albus almost shudders at that – as possible.
Scorpius hadn’t asked about the detention the previous night. He had only asked Albus if they could talk a bit, but Albus had outright declined, lying to his best friend that he was too tired. Albus knew that Scorpius had seen right through him and had understood that Albus simply hadn’t wanted to talk to Scorpius, which made Albus feel even more ashamed than he already was.
“Ron,” Harry breathes out in relief, feeling calmer, now that his friend is there.
“I was sad…and humiliated after what happened, but I think I recovered rather quickly,” Albus says steadily.
“Your father sends you his best,” Harry tries, and Scorpius’s eyes whip back to meet his.
“Did you know…?” Malfoy asks then, finally looking at Harry, “Did you know that my son was being bullied during his first year? That people were saying that – that Astoria –” Malfoy’s voice cracks, and he looks away again.
interrogation,” she says, giving Harry a pointed look, “you must know, that you will need a permission from the child’s guardian.”
Behind Ginny, there’s Professor Fox – James’s Head of House, and James.
Riley nods his head. “Yes, it was,” he says, his voice thick.
Harry lets out a weary sigh and leans back in his chair, checking his dented old watch that had once belonged to Fabian Prewett. Seven-thirty. He wonders if the kids have already arrived to the Great Hall for the welcome feast. He makes a mental note to write to James the next day, to inquire if anyone has yet contacted him after the Quidditch trials he participated earlier that week.
“What do you reckon she wants from us?” Albus asks quietly, as the two of them make their way up the stairs, towards the Headmistress’s office.
Then his mother inquires if Albus has already decided which NEWTs he’ll take, and Albus lets out a frustrated groan. He doesn’t want to talk about this with her, especially not here, not when every five minutes both Scott sisters and Westen send him surreptitious looks. He shrugs his mother’s questions off, and is glad that the door to the classroom opens after that.
“Common spells,” Draco murmurs.
Potter also tells the group that he had questioned both Mr and Mrs Travers before arriving to the village, trying to find out if either the parents or their daughter had any enemies. Potter had explained to Mr and Mrs Travers that as they were an old Death Eater family – and Draco almost flinches at that – the possibility that someone had wanted to harm them in the most cruellest way couldn’t be dismissed.
“Dad!” Albus gasps loudly, jumping up from a seating area near the entrance. He gives Harry a quick hug, and then looks slightly self-conscious, glancing quickly behind him. “Um. What is going on?” He asks quietly, looking worried.
“You do make a good team, after all,” Hermione says slowly, her mouth curving up slightly. “I did have my doubts.”
Scorpius’s eyes widen in surprise. “I don’t know anything!” He almost shouts. “I’m –” Scorpius’s voice suddenly dies away, his gaze fixed at somewhere over Albus’s shoulder.
This manages to pull their classmates from the discussion, and then, all of them stare at the gathering.
“What about the cause of death?” Potter asks firmly, murmuring a similar spell than Draco had to his shoes before stepping into the compartment.
“You can send them here in an hour,” Draco tells him, knowing that he doesn’t
“Yes.” Rose says without a doubt.
Harry greets the parents politely.
Harry is met with a similar welcome than in the Slytherin common room, if not a bit louder, as Rose, Roxanne, Lucy, Molly and Louis all attack Harry with hugs and anxious questions. He manages to calm everyone down, and listens as Lucy – who is a fifth-year Prefect – starts to explain the questioning she went through, and sees how Molly becomes even more nervous, as she hasn’t yet been to Flitwick’s office with Auror Keir.
Albus narrows his eyes at his father. “An hour – maybe two – before Hogsmeade. Why is Scorpius going to be questioned?”
“Feels different.” He says again, frowning at the door.
James snorts.
snowball fight, and how they had the chance to prank the Hufflepuff Head of House by sneaking into the greenhouses and leaving a present in the form of a dung bomb to him, Albus wonders if Scorpius would’ve preferred to have stayed in the school as well. He certainly wouldn’t have wanted to stay at home, Albus knows at least that much.
Albus realises with bitterness and resentment boiling in his stomach, that James…
“You’re gonna be okay, dad, right?” She asks, her gaze on the frozen field, as their walk slows down into a stop.
“James. Come here,” Harry says and gestures for James to sit next to Ginny, before taking the seat on James’s other side.
“Mrs Potter.” Quinn says steadily, giving Ginny a sharp look, somehow, to Harry’s astonishment, making the redheaded woman silent. Ginny too is a bit taken aback, and stays quietly gaping at both Quinn and their son.
Scorpius frowns at him. “What did you do?” He asks mutedly, his eyes flickering to the almost healed cut on Albus’s lip and back to meet Albus’s steely gaze.
“Could you – “
After a short silence Potter speaks. “You think it’s true? …That bit about our sons…you know. Dating?”
“What time was it then?” Harry asks.
Malfoy’s eyes flash with something Harry can’t place. “Is this about my son?” Malfoy asks, as soon as he has sat down opposite to Harry, on the other side of the table.
Scorpius shifts in his seat, taking a surreptitious glance around them, but Albus knows nobody’s paying attention to them. Everyone is focusing on taking their seats at their house tables, eagerly waiting for the feast to start, or still emerging into the Great Hall from their carriages.
They are questioning Scorpius still before lunch, then Rose during lunch, and Albus after it. After Albus, there’s a handful of students to be heard, whom have informed that they had seen Travers during the train ride. Harry sighs inwardly, knowing it will be another long day.
“How the fuck will I lie, when they’ll use bloody
No, it can’t be! It’s James. And Scorpius! Albus knows them. They couldn’t be responsible for something so horrible, no…
Albus feels his father shifting next to him, and as he looks, he can see the deep frown he gives to Quinn. Albus looks back at Quinn. “I told her that I didn’t care if she did. I thought that if I didn’t need to be bothered by her again, I’d gladly let her
Harry shrugs. “I’m fine with it. It’s been a long time coming.”
, that is. He hopes Malfoy has found something that could help them solve this mystery faster.
Albus shrugs. “Indifferent. I hadn’t talked with her in a long time, hadn’t been close to her, until the party.”
to happen, as neither of us had had the courage to admit it before. That we’re not the same anymore. That we’re not happy together.”
There’s a faint blush on tops of Malfoy’s cheeks as the Slytherin looks away, evidently due to Harry’s blatant staring. Harry’s mind goes back to the pub two years ago, and then, to the previous night, and he feels himself drawn towards Malfoy once more, feels his pulse quickening and feels the longing that he has tried to dampen down ever since their paths uncrossed.
They both become silent, and Albus kind of regrets what he said, as he glances at Quinn – who looks like he has never been this embarrassed.
Potter lets out a soft grunt, his eyes glued on the book. He then tears his eyes away from it, and looks at Draco. “I suppose we need to expand our investigation,” he says with a grim look.
Albus nods. “She did.”
Hermione nods, watching Harry carefully. “Is everything all right? Between you and…Draco?” She asks, and Harry feels odd, that Hermione calls him by his first name, while Harry, well…Harry tries to keep it at ‘Malfoy’.
that someone, a very skilful witch or a wizard, had somehow managed to alter the wards momentarily, and put them back up. However, as the magic would’ve left a trace, and there would’ve been another magical signature, Harry thinks it is highly unlikely to have happened. And in addition, an outsider would’ve likely been seen by one of the hundreds of students.
There’s a short silence.
my magic,” He says, feeling somewhat aghast. “It’s…personal. You cast it.” He adds accusingly.
James then speaks about his train ride, after Quinn asks him to, and he tells Quinn that he didn’t see Travers on the ride back. He tells them he spent the most of the ride with his girlfriend and his friends, and only left them for thirty minutes when he briefly met Rose and Hugo, one to two hours before the train reached Hogsmeade.
Peele is Harry’s newest recruit in the Auror forces, a young lanky man, who has only just finished his training in the Academy. Harry reckons Peele is very promising, and reminds him of himself when he was younger. When everything was different.
They sit down side by side, and Albus shrugs, knowing that his father is waiting for an answer. “I’m fine. I’ll be fine,” he adds, after seeing the inquisitive look in his eyes. Trust his father to know all about the fucking embarrassing drama between Albus, James and Scorpius.
Albus’s eyes widen with shock. “You – are you on love potion? Has someone – just – I
, who decided to invite her just to mess with all of our heads, it seems,” he says, throwing a glare at James, who has the audacity to roll his eyes at Albus.
it’ll clear him of your ‘suspects’,” she says with an arched brow, “but that still doesn’t eliminate the fact that you are talking about him like he
A muscle in Draco’s jaw jumps, but he gives Harry a small nod, seemingly unaffected. Harry, however, sees right through him. “Harry,” Draco mutters.
Harry smiles at the portrait. “It is good to be back, regardless of the not so joyful reason,” He says, and then mutters the password, “
don’t feel the same for you, I’m afraid,” He says harshly, clenching his jaw, feeling very,
“You realise what I’m saying, Potter?” Malfoy asks with an inpatient tone.
Lily turns to Harry, and levels him with a serious look, making Harry nearly stumble backwards. She looks so like her mother, looking straight through Harry, in a way that is almost scary. “I knew about you and mum. Before today.”
towards Scorpius! No, Scorpius is his
“N-No…” Albus says unsurely, “I don’t know.”
“Why would she have the book?” Draco asks, suddenly. “It was a sixth-year charms book.”
James answers ‘no’ in a calm voice, when Quinn asks if the boy had anything to do with Travers’s death, or if he does know someone, who did.
her, Albus?” Albus’s mother asks, her voice rising.
Neville shakes his head, still looking anxious. “Just tell us if there is something we can do to help?”
He then explains what they have established so far; that nothing out of ordinary was found from the village, the station, or from the school. He tells the parents that his crime scene investigator is still investigating the scene, and that they can go see their daughter in a bit over thirty minutes if they so wish.
Quinn clears his throat. “And why did you think Travers would have told someone about it?”
“Dad?” Albus asks, as they walk down the spiral staircase. “Mum’s gonna be here, right?” He asks, glancing back at his dad.
Potter has been staring at Draco, so intensely, that it almost seems like he has forgot there are others in the room. Draco keeps the walls protecting his mind up, keeps the blank look on his face, and watches emotionlessly back as Potter’s concerned, green eyes try to search his, try to find something, before they move away, and focus on the middle of table.
Potter then takes a look at the room again, his mind somewhere else. “Something…there’s something, I’m missing,” He mutters.
Albus frowns at the man. “She…told me to mind my own business and if not, she’d tell the other students some things I’ve told her confidentially.”
You know they’ve got nothing to do with it…”
“Hi,” Harry says tentatively, stepping forward. “There’s, um, ink. On your – just – there,” He mutters, pointing at his left temple.
Albus nods at his cousin, still in a foul mood, after his conversation with Scorpius before breakfast. “Rose.”
“…Yeah, I knew.” Harry says softly.
Harry gives Moonstone’s words a contemplative moment. “We need to question them – all of the Prefects. I assume they were all patrolling the train during the trip?” Harry asks, looking from Moonstone to McGonagall.
Harry is quiet for a moment, trying to think if any of the students could’ve done it. Of course, it is possible. It
Potter lets out a dry laugh then. “It would’ve been better if they did…” He says, and as he looks at Draco, and sees his confused expression, he continues with a weary sigh, “Today, I learned that…that some girls in the school, they…” Potter trails off, looking flustered, embarrassed.
Quinn nods. “What happened after you found her with her trunk, on the train?”
Riley frowns at Harry, and then glances away before looking back. “No…I don’t think so. She – she didn’t quarrel with anyone,” he says, looking slightly edgy.
, Albus thinks.
Moonstone sighs, standing up. “You’re more speculative. Harsher. But all of that probably comes with the job, hm?” He says, walking to his desk, his back turned towards Harry. “Have at it,” he mutters, waving his hand towards the fireplace at the back wall.
“Merlin,” Potter groans, placing the book back on the table before trailing a hand through his hair, worry flickering into those weary green eyes.
It isn’t until one-thirty in the morning, that the Aurors finally decide to turn in for the rest of the night, after agreeing with the plan for the next day; who they will question, and how they will proceed.
He doesn’t move an inch, Harry notes and swallows hard. “Kissing you,” He murmurs, moving himself closer.
Harry gives Malfoy an incredulous look. “What?” He then shakes his head quickly, realising what Malfoy is on about. “No. It’s not,” He says firmly, and then looks away, rubbing his neck. “You just witnessed me asking Ginny if she will agree to it – to let Quinn question Albus under Veritaserum.”
Harry frowns at Ginny, and then stares at both Albus and Quinn in bewilderment, wondering, what in Merlin is going on, knowing, that there is possibly no way either of the boys could have been able to lie under Veritaserum.
Draco knows exactly what it is. It is many things. The fact that Potter is still
“It would be appreciated.”
Potter nods slowly. “What about the wand analysis?”
Potter follows him upstairs as they go towards their rooms, but before they reach the first landing, Potter takes Draco’s hand, stopping them both in the middle of dimly lit stairs.
Quinn nods, his expression calm. “Was she alive and well when you left her compartment?”
“So, to make it short; nothing unusual was found on the school grounds, inside the school, at the station, or at the village. We are still not sure whether the girl was a murder victim, or if her death was caused by an accident – nor do we know if other people can be connected to the incident. There are some things that do not add up; she locked the door of the compartment she was found from with a spell, but there weren’t any unlocking charms placed on it afterwards. However, according to the students who found her, the door was unlocked. There also seem to be two possibilities how the wound in her head – and the severe head injury that is the cause of her death – could have been caused. Our crime scene investigator can confirm the cause later,” Harry explains after locking and securing the door with silencing charms.
“Higgins, Bletchley, Walter and Parkinson will be stationed in common rooms,” Harry says, giving orders quickly, “Peele and Prone will search the school, while Bones and Smith investigate the grounds.”
Quinn continues to ask if Albus had had anything to do with Travers’s death –
together, weren’t they? So, something
Two years ago. That sounds an awfully familiar amount of time, on Draco’s opinion. Is there a possibility that
, Albus thinks with an inward grimace. They had – Albus had – had an idea; the two of them exploiting the nightlife in London during their holidays, as they were quite free to come and go as they wished. It wasn’t like they had any parents watching them at all times.
“No. We didn’t – we’re not intimate.” He says instantly, a confused look on his face.
Draco can hear his boss’s question, but his focus is on Potter, who right then walks into the pub, only to be confronted by a group of anxious Weasleys.
They are all dismissed, and Albus’s dad ushers them out just as he hears Rose inquiring if her mother will be there.
Harry’s eyes widened. “What made you want to do potions?”
it’s used.” She pointed to another drawn insect pair of wings. “Why can’t we use the lacewing fly in a laughing potion? Why does it have to be billywig? What is the main component, structure or chemical wise, that is so crucial? Why the entire insect instead of that one piece? Don’t even get me started on the theoretical ideas for potion improvements.”
She must’ve been new because he has never seen her before in St Mungo’s. Merlin knows how many times he’s been here since the auror job.
Harry watched as Malfoy picked up his wand and pointed to the corner where the table of candles were.
The group of students turned their heads away and continued their conversation, unaware or uncaring of Harry’s slight confusion.
“Oh.” Harry simply replied, as Teddy got up to another book.
Harry wanted to drink his, but he didn’t fancy the taste of blood mixed in. It smelt divine though. It helped distract him from the growing pain right above his stomach. It wasn’t a sharp pain anymore, it was a distant ache. He no longer wanted to cough, but once Harry opened his mouth to say anything, Hermione, Ron and even Malfoy shot him a look that said, “Nope. Shut up.”
Parkinson merely nods at Harry, “Of course, sir. Until tomorrow then.”
Draco quickly looks away and distracts himself with his notes, while the rest of the Aurors mutter their goodnights and leave.
Harry quickly suppresses a snort, while Draco simply rolls his eyes, even though his cheeks flush with pink.
“I have examined the compartment, and found two objects that could have caused the impact and the wound; the edge of the compartment bench and a schoolbook,” Draco explains, and sees Potter swallowing hard, evidently thinking about said book’s owner.
Scorpius nods, “Yes, I spent my holiday with them. Mr Potter took us to the train, and then, Albus and I went to sit with our friends, Julian and Cecil, in their compartment.”
Several pairs of eyes give him puzzled and expectant looks.
have a motive. Revenge…protecting himself or his best friend by making sure Travers was unable to fulfil her threats,” Harry tells Quinn, chewing the inside of his cheek.
Albus doesn’t look at his mother, and barely listens as his parents start yelling over the other, before the Headmistress cries loudly, “For Merlin’s sake, Harry. Ginevra! Pull yourself together!”
His father is silent for a while. “Albus…why didn’t you tell me you knew? About – about your mum and me?” He asks quietly, his voice thick.
Scorpius blinks, visibly relaxing.
Because, of-fucking-course he is curious.
Potter rubs the bridge of his nose, his glasses moving slightly up. “Her parents are at McGonagall’s office. I’ll talk to them about the situation, but they will most likely want to see her before you send the body to the morgue,” Potter tells him wearily.
James inclines his head, “To figure out what happened to Travers.”
Albus gapes ahead, unable to believe what he’s hearing. James and Scorpius? Do they – do they actually have something to do with Travers’s death?
,” Moonstone says to the gargoyle in front of the entrance to the Headmistress’s office.
Scorpius
“Based on this – based on the evidence; I declare this case solved. Jenna Travers died by an accident. An accident, she had caused by herself.”
And as his friend finally speaks after a long silence, only to tell Albus that he’ll be down for breakfast in a moment, Albus cowardly uses the opportunity to flee from the situation, snatching his bag and nearly running out of their dormitory, feeling like the world’s worst human being.
James smirks at the Auror. “Laurean Quinn,” he says easily.
“All right, then. Get out of here, before you get too smug for your own good,” Harry says good-naturedly.
“I have a bad feeling about this,” Albus whispers, almost silently.
Neither the Scott sisters nor Westen had anything to do with what happened to Travers. But, as all three girls were close to the victim, Harry thinks there could be something else, some small detail they didn’t know to ask, and the girls didn’t know to tell. Miss Westen hadn’t mentioned the row in the train corridor during her first questioning. During her second, she had told Harry that she hadn’t thought it was important, and thus had left the occurrence unmentioned. Today, Westen told him that she
Harry squints at Quinn, before putting his glasses back on. “I want to question the boyfriend under Veritaserum. Both Scott sisters, Miss Westen, and – Scorpius as well,” Harry says wearily, grimacing inwardly as he thinks how Malfoy will take the news.
The longer Albus watches the occurrence, the more he feels restlessness trickling down his spine. The conversation is interrupted by a strained looking Headmistress, who quiets everyone up as soon as she walks up to them. Albus sees them exchange a couple of words before the Headmistress walks briskly towards the other end of the Hall, towards the teachers’ table.
Enjoy!
Potter lets out a frustrated and desperate noise, and then stomps away again, grunting orders to the other Auror.
Draco wonders, what Potter might be thinking, what goes around in his strategizing Auror-mind, and how he is possibly going over the events that led to this. The fact that the Weasley kid had been here, mere moments before Travers had got hit in the head and died, is…fascinating, and at the same time, infuriatingly frustrating, as the girl had not seen anyone, and Travers had been quite all right as Weasley had left the compartment. If nothing else, they had managed to shorten the time range into thirty minutes.
“Sod off, Malfoy,” Potter grits out. “It's a fucking
. Like that was what he was supposed to do, supposed to feel, preferably for the rest of his life. And he knows that a large part of those feelings originates from the fact that sexually he somewhat prefers men. He lets out a quiet, self-deprecating laugh. He
Harry takes the lone armchair while Moonstone and Riley sit next to each other, facing Harry. Quinn hovers further in the room, observing quietly.
Draco knows that there are still people – still, after almost twenty-five years! – in the wizarding world who think ill of the Malfoy family, and old Death Eater families in general; at least of those whose family members fought in the wrong side of the two wars. Will the Aurors be impartial, and give Draco’s son the same treatment and the same benefit of the doubt than they do for the rest of the students? Something they will most certainly do for the Head Auror’s sons?
Enjoy ;)
James stops in his tracks, and turns around in the middle of the stairs. “Hey Al,” he says easily. “What’s up?”
hiding something. But I don’t know what to think. Not yet.”
a party, James?!” He almost yells. “
Scorpius moves his eyes quickly away from James and glances at his friend. “Yeah. Sure, mate.” He mutters.
Potter pulls his wand and flicks it gently against the girl’s wand. “
“Today we questioned six students under Veritaserum, who had been reported of either having contact with Miss Travers during the holidays, the train ride, or had been otherwise close to her; Hazel Scott, Skylar Westen, James Potter, Scorpius Malfoy, Rose Granger-Weasley and Albus Potter,” Harry starts with and looks over the twelve Aurors, all of them taking notes while keeping closely attention.
He tells them and the Headmistress, that Miss Travers’s death occurred before the train reached Hogsmeade. When he tells them the cause of death; a severe head injury caused by an impact to her head, the mother, Mrs Travers, bursts into tears.
had said to him. It had been James’s fault. Albus is certain there would be nothing to say, nothing to reveal, if James hadn’t been a tosser.
“– told us that your son dated Miss Travers in the beginning of their fifth year.”
wrongly.
Albus nods. “She told me when I confronted her. After I demanded her to tell me why had she lied to the Aurors.”
“What was distracting her?” Harry asks, and sees how Riley’s posture stiffens briefly, before the boy relaxes and clears his throat.
McGonagall looks rather bothered by the thought of her students or faculty being examined, but nods slowly. “You do what you must.”
Harry lets out a long sigh, while Ginny stands up, looking defeated.
friend to snog you, so – here we are,” Albus says back venomously, scrubbing one of the pans furiously with soap and a cleaning brush.
Harry gives Neville a small, tight smile and gestures at Higgins. “Auror Higgins will be stationed here for the night,” he murmurs the words, as approximately seventy pairs of eyes watch their conversation carefully.
Albus’s eyes narrow at his brother. “And was
“Don’t you fucking dare to cry on me,” Albus grits out, as a tear escapes from the corner of her eye. He wants to hex her. He wants to – he wants to – he wants to get the bloody hell away from her! “I’m leaving. Stay – stay away from me.” He says harshly, marching past her and slamming the door closed behind him.
And even without actually saying anything, Albus thinks that James knows what Albus wants to say. What he forbids himself to say.
Albus is shaken from his thoughts. “Yeah. Night.” He says, and chews the inside of his cheek, still staring at the canopy of his bed.
Draco suppresses the urge to roll his eyes. “It would appear so.”
She whispers, looking like she’s going to faint soon. And Harry thinks vaguely, it is quite remarkable, since Ginny’s not a person who is easily shocked, not after growing up with six older brothers.
“W-What?” Ginny breathes, utterly taken aback “J-James?
Potter swallows hard and gives a frown at Draco. “It’s nothing,” He mutters, and then nods at the school, as they approach its gates looming ahead of them. “Have you been here? After – after school?” Potter asks, changing the subject, and for a tense moment, Draco was afraid Potter was going to say ‘after the war’, but when he doesn’t, Draco thinks the Hero of the Wizarding Britain
Draco thinks quickly how long it will take to collect and analyse all the evidence with the probable interruptions. “I should be,” he says after a short moment.
Ginny scoffs loudly, her words, and the glower in her expression aimed at Harry, after she sees the hesitant look in Harry’s eyes. “Why are you taking Scorpius’s word over our son’s?!”
Scorpius’s father walks forward and Scorpius follows, his back rigid. Scorpius looks back to share one last look with Albus, before he steps into the classroom.
And it goes on, almost the same as the day before; James spent the train ride with his girlfriend and his friends, and left them only to change into his robes for a thirty minutes time, around five in the afternoon, during which he met first with Hugo, and then with Rose. He had given some joke products to Hugo, which Rose had then confiscated from her brother. James had gone back to his compartment after that.
(See the end of the chapter for
Draco clears his throat. “No. No need,” he says quietly, not quite able to hold Potter’s gaze.
“Malfoy,” Harry says, surprised to see the man still there. Harry blinks at him. “You’re still here.”
Harry pinches the bridge of his nose, feeling now more nervous of Albus’s questioning than he earlier had been. There’s of course Rose, who was probably the last one to see Travers alive, but…it couldn’t have been Rose. It couldn’t have been Albus, either, Harry reminds himself.
“Oh, Harry!” Hermione breathes, shaking her head in bewilderment as she walks up to Harry, leaving Ron and Rose close to the classroom. “What is going on? Rose isn’t – you
As soon as the door closes, Albus takes in a couple of deep breaths, his hands shaking on his lap.
He notices that his hands are shaking.
“Sir?” Quinn; a strikingly good-looking bloke in his mid-thirties – Harry’s assessment that he hasn’t shared with anyone beyond his own mind – and an excellent combat trainer; an opinion he shares with all of his Aurors, asks, as he falls into step with Harry.
“Goodnight, Harry.”
Hermione grabbed hold of his arm, and he felt the familiar pull of apparition in his gut.
He nodded at Malfoy who nodded back, then followed Pansy and Blaise into the backroom.
“Take it easy, mate.”
Harry was ready for a lecture, or a glimpse of stress hidden in his face. Anything to tell Harry that he was right, it was a bad idea after all. But none of that came.
Grabbing his wand, given back to him at some point by a faceless person, he cast an Incendio, and watched as each printed sentence burned. There were still a million copies, but at least it wasn’t in the same room as him anymore.
“Did you tell Draco about this?” Harry asked, afraid of what the answer would be.
When the Great Lake came into view, he instantly noticed the crisp lake air, slightly different but no less refreshing, from that of the hill and the field. A tentacle poked out of the water, as if the Giant Squid was greeting Harry. He just smiled, and waved back.
Harry got up, unsure about leaving the papers on the floor but trusting Malfoy’s decision. “But I’m a mess right now, give me a few minutes.”
Harry took another bite from his sandwich, something light for lunch. “It doesn’t hurt anymore, Tina. I don’t know what happened, but I feel like I’m supposed to.”
“Okay, thank you.” Harry moved to sit down, but Lavender stopped him.
Harry just kept looking at him, and only then did he realise how tired Ron was. He hid it well, but his freckles stood out just a little more, his eyebrows creased a little too tightly. Harry never would’ve realised if he didn’t know he was looking for it.
“Of course. Especially with this new situation and all,” Parkinson added after pulling herself together quickly.
Hagrid turned around, bucket dropping out of his hand. Thankfully it was empty, though it didn’t stop a few of the baby thestrals from sticking their heads into it. Harry wove between the animals, trying not to hurt or disrupt any of them as he walked quickly towards his friend.
The past times were just luck, and knowing himself, it wasn’t going to last long. Someone will reprimand him for his choices soon enough, and he was dreading it. But at the same time, it can make everything seem that little bit better.
“Sorry,” His voice was hoarse. Clearing his throat, he tried again. “Sorry, I was distracted.” Slightly better. “What were you asking?” He turned to face the healer.
Those words made Harry want to run to him, but also to run far far away.
They sat down and ordered their drinks. Firewhiskey for both Nott and Neville, Goyle took a mulled mead, and Harry ordered butterbeer to a still youthful Madam Rosmerta.
He talked to Andromeda for a bit. Harry found out that Andromeda wasn’t working anymore, her vaults being generous enough anyway. He hugged her tightly, and didn’t quite want to let go just yet. But he did, and he just smiled and thanked her for taking care of Teddy.
“Are you going to teach us today?”
“You’re so lucky the wedding cake wasn’t on that table.” Hermione piped in, smirking at Ron’s astonished face.
He so desperately wanted it back. His memories, his life, his smiles, the connections. How it could’ve all just gone, Harry didn’t know. Hadn’t Harry suffered enough in his life? He died and came back just for this?
“Hm.” Pansy’s eyes narrowed.
Harry didn’t need to catch up on Hermione and Ron’s past 5 years. That was one of the things they talked about in the weeks he was in hospital.
Malfoy visibly relaxed and took his hand off Harry's shoulder. Harry felt the difference. He decided to put that thought in for later. Thoughts for later seemed to pile up.
Harry noticed that Molly, Arthur, Andromeda and Teddy were going to the backyard. Teddy was jumping up, as if he was practicing catching a real snitch. It made his heart bloom.
There was one place Harry wanted to be right now, and he hoped and prayed it hadn’t changed since his 8th year, as his memories didn’t seem to show him going to that place before the 5 year void.
Her job was fashion designer. Her eye for the next trend, for things that could be altered slightly into a completely new thing, was impeccable. Harry discovered that once Pansy started talking about her job, the conversation would last significantly longer.
Harry woke up the next day feeling a million times better than he had when he fell asleep. Eyes blinking awake, he patted at the table next to him for his glasses. Finding them, he yawned, and put them on.
Malfoy had time to spare a glance, but couldn’t wave them off before a scream and a crash echoed through the shop. Harry inwardly cringed and tip toed out the door to where Parkinson and Zabini were waiting patiently.
Harry, face still in his hands, just nodded. He could just imagine the smirk on Malfoy’s face as he walked to stand next to Harry and looked upon the mess of clothes on the bed.
“Mate, you got there before, you can do it again. Besides, does it look like you’re gonna do this alone?” Ron gestured to the room.
Harry wondered if Malfoy was okay, and had dinner since Harry wasn’t there to make sure of it.
Neville’s smile never left his face. “Thank you. It’s old news, about 2 years, but I’ll never get sick of telling people. I’m glad I got to tell you again.”
Soon everyone was petting their own hippogriff as Hagrid began to talk about cleaning their feathers. The class was engrossed in their learning, even as no one took notes or wrote down the teachings, Harry knew they’d remember the important bits.
*****
When he finally stopped crying, his breathing now normal and glasses put on, he reached over for the stack of journals and began reading.
“Why do you ask?”
Kingsley stood up slowly, mirroring Harry’s stance but with a gentle kindness in it. “You’re not mentally ready to get back on the field. You need a change of perspective, it’s what almost got you killed.”
After about half an hour, give or take, Harry and Isolt walked down the stairs into the dining room only to find the picture frames still all over the floor. He looked at Isolt’s corner, but she didn’t move off his head. Before he could tell her to go, Malfoy’s voice rang out.
“I’m going to visit Parvarti. She’s probably waiting for me so…”
As Harry got up, walking towards the kitchen, he kept note of the lack of picture frames. He wanted to ask Malfoy about them.
Harry put up his shield, and hid behind the chair. “
Their methods of fighting weren’t the headfirst Gryffindor methods he’d been used to with Ron, Neville and everyone else. These two kept up the pretense that he was succeeding in his performance, and Harry didn’t even know they had known for so long.
“I know.”
He couldn’t stand it in the house anymore, surrounded by things he didn’t remember. Endless hours spent looking for memories that he began wondering if they existed anymore. He’s done with it. He’s going back.
A rattle of a cage caught Harry’s attention. He moved over to Isolt, and put out his arm. She perched on it happily, and hooted affectionately.
“Oh, Draco dear. I’m looking for wolfsbane?” An elderly woman wobbled into the shop.
“20.”
Half an hour or so later, Malfoy and Harry were saying goodbye to each other, wishing each other well for the day ahead. Harry told Malfoy about going to Hogwarts, and Malfoy just said to say hello to McGonagall and Neville when he got there.
Harry grabbed his glasses off the bedside table and followed Hermione downstairs. He sat down at the table next to Ron and across from Charlie, whose red hair was now falling into his face. Normally, Mrs. Wealsey would have never allowed Charlie’s hair to get so long, but given everything that had happened, she had hardly noticed.
“The Boy Who Lived has remained relatively reclusive this summer, only being sighted outside of the Weasley residence on occasion to go to the local market or visit with friends.
“I just hope we have a good Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher,” Ron said gloomily.
“Sorry, it’s just, you were screaming quite a bit.” The crazed panic behind Hermione’s eyes faded a bit, but she still looked concerned. She settled down so she was sitting next to him, their backs against the bed.
“She seems to like you.” The wizard pointed at her. “Then again, she likes almost everyone.”
“So how was your summer?” Harry asked the pair once he had settled into a seat.
Harry awoke with a start, moving so suddenly that he accidentally turned and fell out of his bed onto a creaky wooden floor. He let out an “oof” and pressed his hand to his forehead.
“Ron,” Harry nudged Ron in the side. “What is it?”
“Oh, I just stayed home. Every Time I tried to leave the house, I was surrounded by photographers and interviewers,” he told them, wide eyed. “It was a nightmare.”
Gradually, the tables filled with students and the walls echoed with chatter. Once everyone had arrived, Professor McGonagall stood and clinked her spoon against her glass, calling the students to attention. The talking died down and heads turned to listen to the new Headmistress.
was no longer calling Harry a crazed lunatic, but the constant attention was exhausting. Everytime he left the house, he was surrounded by reporters and photographers eager to report on Harry’s latest adventures, even if those adventures merely consisted of going shopping or visiting Andromeda and Teddy.
Hermione pushed her way to the front of the group and addressed the first-years.
This continued until “Kirk, Ambrose” was sorted into Gryffindor and the last of the first years settled into their new houses.
Harry had spent a lot of that summer pretending not to notice things. Like the way Ron and Hermione sometimes casually held hands, or the fact that they snuck out after dinner almost every night. Of course, they always invited Harry along, but he knew that they would really rather spend that time alone, so he always refused.
Harry glanced around, wondering what could possibly be rendering his classmates dumbstruck before he remembered the Thestrals: the black winged horses one could only see after one had witnessed death. He had been seeing them since fifth year, after the murder of Cedric Diggory, but he realized that after the battle of Hogwarts, most of his friends would be able to see them for the first time.
Not to mention the fact that he didn’t want to give either of his best friends yet another reason to coddle him. He appreciated how gentle they were being with him, but he was tired of being treated like he was made of glass and about to shatter.
The next day, Harry, Hermione, and the Weasley family set off early in the morning for Diagon Alley. They spent most of that morning finding all their school books and avoiding various reporters. By the time noon rolled around, Harry was starving and ready to sit down. Unfortunately, he still had to buy his dress robes, as his old ones from fourth year were far too small for him now.
Harry didn’t get to see the cashier’s reaction to Malfoy though, because Madam Malkin had finished measuring him. She gestured for him to follow her, and he did. She led him to the front of the shop.
“You’re Head Girl?” Ambrose asked in awe.
Sorry, that was kind of long winded. But I love you all!
The golden platters on the tables filled with delicious smelling food. There were roast chickens, mashed potatoes, fresh loaves of bread, and many more delectable treats that made Harry’s mouth water. He heard the new Gryffindor first-years gasp at the newly appeared food. He loaded up his plate and dug in.
“No,” she said, not looking at all upset about this.
“Where’s Ron?” Harry’s eyes flitted around the room, searching for any sign of the tuffs of red hair and sprinkle of freckles that branded the Weasley family.
The three of them looked over their lists for a few more minutes before Hermione broke the silence.
“That’s amazing Hermione!” Harry smiled at her. If anyone deserved to be Head Girl, it was certainly Hermione.
“I don’t know how you handle it Harry. I don’t think I could ever get used to that kind of attention.” The train lurched forwards as it started to move. “Although, it wasn’t all bad. I convinced my Gran to let me build a miniature greenhouse in the backyard.”
Darkness fell over the train as day turned to night, and soon the five students were conversing about the Hogwarts professors.
After a few minutes, Mrs. Weasley sat down at the table, her eyes considerably drier.
Hermione snatched the paper out of his hands.
The rest of the ride passed in silence. When they finally reached Hogwarts, Harry hopped out of the carriage and stretched his legs. He had been sitting all day and he was feeling a bit restless. They were walking up the steps towards the entrance to the school when Ron suddenly froze.
Once everyone had finished their dinner, the leftover savory foods disappeared and were replaced by a vast assortment of sweets. Harry glanced across the hall as he piled his plate with treacle tarts and saw a Slytherin first-year talking Malfoy’s ear off. Malfoy grew increasingly annoyed and eventually barked something at the small girl that made her shut up.
