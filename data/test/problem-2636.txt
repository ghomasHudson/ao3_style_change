"I...I....well, I didn't say it was YOU. And, I am serious about her. She's my girl and I wanted her to know that I'm turning over a new leaf. I've had a chance to reflect on my actions.  I'm taking her to see my parents tonight at dinner and then split off to the theatre in case dinner doesn't go well."
“I’ve got to get you to do something about your hair. Maybe I’ll let you use some of my potions.” He yawned, “anyway, let's take a nap.” He glanced down at Hari once more to see his eyes closed and softly breathing. Glancing at Teddy he saw the baby in the same state, his hair a light blue color. The eyebrows faint as they were just tinted blue as well.
“Yeah, but it was weird...it was you but it wasn’t. You transformed into a giant white dragon.”
Sucking on his teeth for a moment before making his decision, Draco gave one sharp tug revealing naked hip bones to the drafty air. Potter bucked and cursed and kicked at him as Draco fought to remove his trousers and pants at the same time. Finally had enough, Draco took handfuls of Potter’s hair, lifted his head and smacked it sharply into the tile floor, once more dazing him. The task of removing Potter’s trousers and undergarments finally done, Draco took the seconds needed to sit up straight whip his hair from his eyes with a flick of his head, and momentarily peered down at the dazed Potter beneath him before reaching down and unsnapping his own trouser buttons.
would or wouldn't let him say.
As the words echoed around her, the air seemed to shimmer in the early light. Narcissa’s shoulders sagged as if a weight had been taken from her shoulders. She moves from the west to the heart of the circle where the altar stood with its blessing. The fog circle parted and glided in a misty trail in her wake. Stepping to the altar, she took a bejeweled athame, and cut with percicition a chunk of sage and tossed it into the cauldron.
I thought maybe, you’d be willing to take her on. I know you probably haven’t gotten over the death of Hedwig, but she needs a good home and I couldn’t entrust her in more of a loving friend. Consider her an early birthday present and I won’t take no for an answer. She’s a two year old eastern grass owl. See the color on the face, males don’t have this. Her name is Eliana.
reigned in his desire, before he could do anything more than touch. It is a very good thing that Hari was not yet of age. Who knows what he would have done otherwise...That was a lie. Of course he knew what he would have done. He was fantasizing about it moments ago. Angry and disgusted with himself, he paced the length of the room. He couldn't let his dragon, his alpha instincts win. He didn't want to lose Hari again.
“Er...Uh...well actually, flying sidecar was quite frightening and it was unpredictable. I prefer my broom.” His owl was not the only thing lost in that damn thing.
Draco cackled in delight. He'd finally get a chance to listen to Hari sing actual lyrics and not just a melody on the wind from a fourth floor window.
“I don’t love Hari because he is famous!  Gods mother, even you think I am that shallow.”
Yes, a second chance. Didn't they all deserve a second chance? Now here they all were living under the same roof. And Draco said he loved him—had even loved him for some time now apparently. Hari snorted with a fond smile on his lips. It had taken him being drunk off his ass to confess.
“Is everything alright over here? Need help with a selection?” Candice was back from talking with her colleague. Hari noticed Draco grit his teeth. If he hadn’t been looking carefully he would have missed the slight crack in his Malfoy-mask.

Sheryl patted Draco’s cheek with a pleased smile. “Yes, you’ll be good for him.”
The Prosecutor went on with the trial. “Now for testimony by the accused, Mr. Malfoy?” Draco startled, “The elder.”
"You told him to bite me, didn’t you?"
All he ever wanted growing up was to be just like his father, so he did everything his father asked of him, said whatever he needed to say, acted in whatever mannerism he was supposed to. Draco rotated his stiff shoulders, flexed twice, feeling the faux pain of the scars from the caning he received more than once for being a disappointment to his father. Draco learned the hard way that the life he grew up with was wrong. It only took a war and living with a deranged murdering monster for three years to knock some sense into him. Sure he could still be proud of his pedigree, but that didn’t mean half-bloods and mud…muggle-borns were less. Take Harry Potter and Hermione Granger; Granger is perhaps the smartest witch in his year, if ignorant of wizarding ways, and Harry Potter… well he’s lacking in the brains department, but makes up for it with looks, and magical power. Draco was not afraid to admit that he was vain. Weasley was still dirt poor and an uncivilized weasel.
"I didn't know I was one until Hagrid came and got me on my eleventh birthday. My Muggle relatives never told me my mum was a witch. I knew nothing about my parents at all. Up until the moment I was sorted into Gryffindor I believed at any moment someone would say there had been some kind of mistake and take my wand away."
Narcissa was still standing at the railing, staring in astonishment on how Hari had manipulated her son. She suppressed a giggle at the exchange. She stepped back into her room when she had a thought.
Now it was like some cosmetic joke; Harry refused to cast the Killing Curse during the war, but now that the war was over, and he did cast it, how could he justify killing Kreacher. He murdered Kreacher, why?
"Let's have it for our first singer, Queen Beryl, singing..."The DJ checked the clipboard. "Aretha Franklin, 'Respect.'
“So, you and Hari?” Narcissa asked taking a seat on the bed and then gesturing Draco down to sit beside her.
“Good, very good. Now, wrap like healing bandagesss.” This reminded Harry of how he had wrapped a blanket similarly around Dobby’s lifeless body at Shell Cottage before burying him, and choked up a little. Harry watched with halted breath as his emerald colored magic was met with copper magic and wrapping around Kreacher. “Copper isss like the tassste of blood, and isss the color of magic for all thingsss living.  Your Kreacher livesss now.”
“My Muggle family beat and starved me.” Hari suddenly growled, before storming out of the parlor, barely managing to avoid collision with Draco who couldn’t scramble out of the way in time. Hari stumbled to a stop, just looked between Narcissa and Draco, and huffed out, “Let’s go.” Before grabbing Draco’s hand and dragged him back into the Parlour and through the Floo. He didn’t look back at Andromeda.
An undetermined amount of time later, Hari paused in his reading. In fact his whole body paused. The hand in Draco's hair stilling.
Andromeda hesitated for only a moment. “Letters that I never sent. Hateful, hurtful letters about the war, and my daughters death, the failure of the Ministry. Feelings I don’t need or would like to get rid of.”
------
Hari had spun around fast, but didn’t run. He didn’t want to look like he was guilty. He looked down at his clothes. Yes he looked like he was street rat. Then he looked up at the person who signaled him out. It was a woman, or rather a man dressed like a woman. “Er no, sir…I mean ma’am. I’m sorry. I mean no disrespect.”
Draco laughed dryly, a broken chuckle, before sighing as he shook back his hair from his face. "What brought that on anyway? Surely, you've seen more gruesome scars than this?"
He struggled to get Draco to his feet and out of the study. If Hari thought it was hard to get the still drunk and half conscious Draco through the Floo, maneuvering him up four flights of stairs was more difficult. It never crossed his mind to use magic.
Draco and Hari were covered in mud. Hari stood a ways away from the fallen Draco. If it wasn’t for the near besotted look on her sons face, she would have said there was some type of alteration between the two and her dragon had lost.
"In addition to healing the ley lines, the Cup, although made by goblins,was defiled by Dark Magic, then belonged to Voldemort because of..." The chieftess looked over at Andromeda, hesitating on saying this last part, but Harry immediately understood and in that split second, decided to trust Andromeda.
Harry Potter was clinging to Kreacher, his breath smelling like vomit. “I could free you, you know, or you could go find a better master. I’m…not a good master, I killed you.” He mumbled. Suddenly sitting up straighter, swirling around in the chair and in his excitement he nearly tipping over the back of the chair.
“It sounds to me like you wanted him to notice you as much as you noticed him.” Narcissa told her son. Draco grumbled something under his breath. “What was that?”
Even though he knew it was a perfectly normal teenage boy’s function, he couldn’t help but feel ashamed of his body’s reaction.
With a jolt back to reality, Draco awoke to realize his room on fire, his two house-elves, Kocoa and Dot trying desperately to wake him up, and get him dressed into soot stained but as of yet burnt clothes. For once Draco didn’t care about his appearance, what clothes he was wearing, or if his hair was neat. He jumped out of what remained of his smoking bed, slipping on the sooty garments, Draco hastened to reach his mother's side. He was not worried about getting burnt, after all he is partially dragon, thanks to his mother’s creatures’ blood passed down to him, but rather having a beam fall on him.
It was the only explanation. '
lingering on his body.
The Wonderful World of Harry Potter, the characters and images all belongs to the amazing mind of J.K. Rowling and no copyright infringement was intended in the creation of this fan fiction.
Andromeda positioned them around the altar, like a diamond with the altar in the center. As instructed Hari nervously held his willow wand tip facing the ground. His palms were sweaty. At Andromeda’s instruction, they each made a circle of their own, chanting “
Hari sucked his lip into his mouth. “I didn’t think I needed it.” Draco knew the words coming out of Hari’s mouth were not meant to sound so arrogant; despite Severus Snape saying contrary, Hari didn’t have an arrogant bone in his body. That was all Draco. But still the words said almost callously, grated.
"I never had to before now. It isn't exactly legal to reveal our kind to Muggles." Cho said wringing her hands.
“Yeah, Voldemort doesn’t give second chances, and Voldemort had been more than generous with his loyal followers. But he doesn’t see the Malfoy’s as loyal followers. You see, Lucius Malfoy first mistake was pleading not guilty after the first Wizarding world. He denied his loyalty to his master, saying he was under the Imperius Curse, and got away scot free.” Bill and Draco didn’t understand the exact muggle reference, but they caught the meaning.
Shrugging off the discomfort of discovering she had the poor boys named spelled wrong on her menu for two years now. To remedy the situation, she quickly hopped nimbly on a stool in stiletto shoes, to change the spelling. At the bar, one customer shouted down the line. “Hey Mama? Did that skinny blonde beat the challenge, that why you changing the name. Damn. I had my money on Hari winning.”
Harry felt a tingling sensation in his hands, for a moment he got excited, thinking perhaps this was it. He opened his eyes to peer at the door.
"Well...I liked the story. Thank you for sharing it with me." Hari said gently. "You're doing it again, Dray." Hari says dryly as he jostles Draco's tail away from his groin by wiggling his leg. "And you aren't doing it on purpose are you?"
------
"What's this? Another journal?" Hari says turning the journal around and around in his palm.
The lower level was packed with sweaty bodies gyrating and grabbling with each other for space and partners. The fifth and final song for the first set began, and Mary. Queen of Scotts began to sing a very abt song for the club, Whitney Houston
p.s. The lightning shaped scar is pink.
"He hit me in public, not hard mind, not in public...never in public." He whispered taking another swing of firewhiskey.
"You'll see!"
"we're...wha...we're, who? You and Hari?" Blaise sputtered.
How can I go home and not get blown away
Draco sat elbows to knees and hands clasped together, with his head bowed as if in prayer. But Draco was not praying; he was seething. He glared over the top of his hands, before he glanced over at his mother. “There was an issue with the vaults. You see…father gave access to the Dark Lord and he was slowly siphoning funds into his own vaults. I went over the ledgers, it’s almost all gone. That leach was bleeding Father dry. I would say good riddance but that money was rightfully ours. There is barely anything left, how we live now the gold would run out before the year is up.”
“I’m not a snake.” Harry said.
Ever since he was attacked, trout kept a close eye out for him. He taught him how to look out for mad dogs like the man who attacked him with an alcohol bottle, and mostly he warned him against Tom's and Rat's.
"Yes. Muggle sympathizers are usually written off as blood traitors. Like your father, the Weasley's, and Aunt Andra." Draco agreed.
"I was born while my parents were in hiding. She must have known about the prophecy. She knew my due date was near the end of July or the beginning of August. The prophecy said, 'born as the seventh month dies. According to my birth certificate I was born two minutes to midnight on 31st of July."
Hari was taking his sexual frustration out on the juncture between Draco's shoulder and neck, leaving behind blooming hickeys. Draco was against the wall, helpless to Hari's affront. As Hari was more than slightly tipsy and Draco's dragon blood was quickly nulling the effects of hard liquor in his blood; Draco wisely kept his hands plastered to the wall. He was testing his will power against
He's never confessed like Draco had to him. He's asked Cho Chang to the Yule Ball that one time. And got rejected. Ouch that had hurt. But they ended up dating a few times fifth year after the death of Cedric, her boyfriend.
Emmet laughed merrily. "You were coming here to drink anyway, sister."
"IF I find my godson, I'll look for Potter. But only then." His black robes billowed behind him as he left his office.
The third Queen came on set set wearing, an honest to God, kimono. Well one, you might find at a lingerie store. The garter belt and stockings a seductive black against beefy, thankfully hairless creamy thighs.
------
"Are you asking me out on a date?" Draco asked in disbelief.
Then they waited. Suddenly the fireplace burst into green flames and the long nose, big eared silhouette of a house-elves head appeared.
“What?” Hari squeaked out.
"Is it because I am lonely, and miss my friends that I can even think to be friends with Draco?" Hari asked with hands clenched tightly together.
"You do know, if you go with me, she'll want to dress you up as well."
. I am the secret keeper. There is also a
"Ah, no. You look so young, but I get that a lot too. I'm nearly forty but I've been told I look younger. And your friend?"
Draco Malfoy wore all black as he stood by his mother's side. His dressrobes were custom tailored to fit his tall, slim and lithe frame to perfectly accent his broad shoulders and tapered waist. His back was iron straight and his shoulders stiff. His pale complexion stood out in stark contrast from his all black attire, from his white blonde hair, moon-glow skin, and stormy gray eyes.
More tears swelled to the surface as did the hope and joy in his heart.
Hari turned his head to look at him, the smile disappearing on his face. Shadow cast over on his sun bronzed skin, and Draco realized he was blocking the light, looming over Harry like a predator about to devour his unsuspecting prey. Draco reached down his hand to offer Harry a hand up.
11 June 1987
------
Draco seemed to know what would pleasure Hari more than he did himself and Hari tried not to think about what that meant considering this was a dream.
“Where did you get off to?” Connor asked Oliver, snagging Mary from his grasp. In public Connor was Mary’s father and Oliver was her uncle who lived with them. It wasn’t something that any of them liked to pretend, but Mary was teased relentlessly at school, and the board of governors called in at one time. It was easier.
When Sirius Black escaped Azkaban during Harry’s third year, and turned out to be his godfather and not the murdering lunatic out to get him as he and the rest of the world was made to believe, Harry felt ecstatic that he would finally have someone who wanted to call him family. With the Dursley’s he was a dirty little secret; hidden away to live in the broom cupboard under the stairs for 10 years, without even a picture of him gracing the walls of his Aunt Petunia’s and Uncle Vernon’s home. He was malnourished, and beaten, and worse than all the negative attention was being ignored. The teachers in Muggle schools didn’t care when he came to school bruised, or smelly from not bathing, or wearing unclean clothes, or clothes two to three times too big for his small frame. When Uncle Vernon’s boss discovered his existence, his uncle called him
He didn’t want to befriend Muggles or Circe, forgive them all, marry one, just observe and form his own ideas without the influence of his parents and friends. Also something not Slytherin of him to think. But, together with his five friends, they came up with the scheme to see for themselves.
Hari scoffed. "You maybe not, me..."
Trout clamped Hari's thin shoulder with one large hand and led him away. "Look alleycat. It doesn't matter if you're a boy or how old you are. Some Tom's don't care. If a big Tom gets you, they hurt you, just like this here Molly is getting hurt, see?" Trout tried to explain in as easy way as possible.
Draco frowned harder. “I’d need to get my Newts first in Charms, Potions, Arithmancy, and Transfiguration. Then I’d need to apprentice under a Master Magist, and perhaps, join a fellowship, then maybe. That’s if Drumstand would welcome me, or perhaps maybe Beauboton,  I am fluent in French.”
Snarling Draco managed to bring one of Potter's legs up over his shoulder and head, to position him on all fours, Potter aiding this desired position by trying to get away, inching forward on bound wrists and shaking knees. Draco landed the rest of his weight onto Potter’s back, grappling with him, trying to gain purchase on wet skin, before finally grabbing onto his narrow hips, and slamming balls deep into him. Holding Potter up barely by his hips, Draco began to ruthlessly thrust into Potter’s tight hole, angling for Potter’s sweet spot, his prostate with every thrust.
Gritting his teeth, giving himself a little pep talk about the merits of not scaring off his host, and losing this safe haven, he pushed back his alpha's dominant nature, barely. Looking down the hall he finally noticed another room. The sign read, Hari J. Potter. In Draco's mind it was like a Weasley's Wizarding Wheezes firework show went off in his brain, and a choir was singing holy music, and Draco was lightheaded with delight. No. That was Draco nearly passing out from holding his breath too long, and his mother catching him before he face planted and further embarrassed himself. Luckily all this happened within a few seconds and Hari wasn't actually paying attention but talking about their living arrangements.
Hari returned to his room that night and paused at the sight of his bed. Did he forget to make it before his date with Draco. And then, why didn’t Dot tidy it up? She’s always nagging Hari to let the tiny house-elf do more for him.
Hari does all the cooking for the Dursley's but is only aloud scraps or unwanted food from the table. Hari purposefully burns food so that he can get a little extra food whenever he can. He gets discovered and as punishment Hari's aunt feeds him raw and spoilt meat. He is forced to eat it, and gets food poisoning. He goes in and out of consciousness and discovers that this is not the first time he had been abused enough to warrant a trip to the hospital. Hari's memories had been altered so he wouldn't remember the incident and others by Dumbledore.
"Wai...what? How did you know. You thought the Weasley's abused me? They would never!" Hari was outraged.
When he came to, Harry was in the back of his uncle's car. It was just he and his aunt and cousin. Uncle Vernon was not in the moving vehicle, nor was Piers. Dudley sat in the shotgun seat next to his mother, who was driving. Harry was laying across the back seat, bleeding on his uncles patent leather seats. Despite trying to remain quiet when he woke, he groaned involuntarily. His cousin in the front seat turned around at the sound, frightened.
A shadow appeared over Draco, blocking out the light.
"Oh!" Hari smiled sheepishly. "Well, let's continue the tour, shall we?" Hari said gesturing to the narrow stairs in the back of the hallway. Descending the stairs, before he continued the tour. "This is the kitchen, it use to hold important Order business after Voldemort returned." Draco flinched at hearing the Dark Lords name. "Fear of the name only increases fear itself". Hari said after seeing Draco's reaction.
“But Lucius still had his uses. The second time Lucius was to use his connections with the Ministry and the Wizengamot to get me expelled from Hogwarts so I would lose the protection of the wards. That plan failed and I wasn’t expelled. So the next plan was to lure me away from the protection of the school.” Hari was pacing now as he told the encounters that led to Draco being forced to take the Dark Mark. Bill and Draco were enthralled.
But here they were. Sheryl swept forward with a haughty, "they're with me, Winston."
“Now we eat breakfast.” Draco said excitedly. He tugged on Hari’s arm and pulled him along to the altar. Delicious fruit filled sweetbreads and scones sat next to round goblets of pumpkin juice, orange juice, and by the smell some kind of spiced alcohol beverage. “Honey mead.” Draco said at Hari’s curious glance.
Draco was speechless. He had no words. Hari, who Draco has always accused of favoritism, and special privileges, did just that to help Draco--again. His attention shy Gryffindor went out of his comfort zone to return his gold. Controlling, barely, the besotted look off his face, he did what came best to him, hackling Hari Potter.
01 September 1991
"I'll be off work at six, if nothing major comes up that delays my return."
"Draco" He corrected Potter as he took the hand he had so desperately wanted to grasp the first time he offered back seven years ago on the train ride to school.
The few treasures he found he stacked neatly on the writing desk to keep on hand and from losing. His father's invisibility cloak, the Marauder's map, the photo album from Hagrid, his expandable mokeskin pouch, a sneakoscope, extendable-ears, and the omnioculars from the Quidditch World Cup. Smaller items he kept on his person, like the watch Mr. Weasley gave him on his seventeenth birthday, the pocket knife from Sirius, a shard of glass from the two-way mirror that saved his life, and the first ever snitch he caught.
Draco snickered and leaned down to steal another kiss from Hari before his time alone with Hari was taken. Not a moment too soon, either, for the sound of squealing rust hinged doors creaking open behind them and the dark halo of Andromeda’s head peeked from around the door.
"Alright, alright, sheesh! I hear you. I just only heard him sing along to the radio and he's good." Arlys says.
He thought. Then he tackled the white and black heavy and smooth leather skirt. He couldn't get it over his thighs before he saw the zipper that ran up one side.
“I know Sirius…” Hari began.
"You're not drinking anymore," Ollie agrees with a sigh and hard stare at Sheryl.
"Well my Dad was an unregistered animagus. His animal form was a red stag. He got the name Prongs from the antlers, I guess...you know two prongs, three prongs and such." He said as he attempted to organize a pile of clean?...clothes, and failed.
Hello my wonderful readers,
There is no vaccine. It is not an issue of finding the code and plugging it into the strands of flu we have vaccines for. We were able to do this with the Swine flu ten years ago, it wont be the case for the coronavirus, it is a different micro-monster than that.
He decided. The rubbish bin was too nice a place for such foul rags.
"Oh, we have a couple witches in our mist, do we?" The two wizards froze. "Or do you call yourselves warlocks or something? Alice asked innocently. Slurping at some yellow frozen drink.
------
And he won. He caught the Golden Snitch, allowing Gryffindor's 150 points, and ended the game. They won. 170-60.
"I won't do no running drugs for you." Harry said fiercely.
“We can’t ever hope to be what the world expects for us. It only leads to disappointment and heartbreak. So yeah, I guess…well I…” Hari rubbed the back of his head enduringly. “When I offered you my hand, I was offering you a truce. I was willing to forgive you, to make amends, and start anew. From here on out, it is our choices that determine what we are to each other.”
Draco raised his eyebrow at Blaise's childlike behavior. "Yes, Blaise, our relationship is too new. I can't risk it. Especially since his inheritance is right around the corner.
"Hey, where did C'iemone and Arlys go?" Hari wondered.
shrugged his scrawny shoulders. "This way."
"Read your mind?...Yes Mr. Potter I have. I was born with no sight, but that gave me an even greater Sight. I see into your mind, I assess your honor. I know what you have done, why you did it, and why you are here now."
“What’s the matter, Malfoy? You scared?” Hari said with an uncharacteristic leer.
Harry pondered what Asclepius was trying to tell him. ‘Close his eyes and open his mind,’ sounded like meditation to Harry. He was use to trying to meditate when practicing Occlumency. ‘Feel and see the magic.’ When Harry uses his magic, he often feels a warmth in his diaphragm surging up and out of his core and traveling down his wand arm when spellcasting. “There I feel it.”
“I don’t want any trouble here. I just need to purchase a wand. I am a paying customer. Your uncle’s wands are the best in the UK, my family has continued to use this shop for generations, and I intend to continue. Please just let me make my purchases and I will leave.” Draco now pleaded. He desperately wished that Hari would arrive soon.
Hari inwardly cringing at the thought of what Hermione’s reaction would be when she returns from Australia, learning that instead of just the one house-elf, Hari now owned three. Koako and Dot were originally Narcissa’s house-elves as part of her dowry when she married Lucius Malfoy; however with his death and their return to their ancestral home, they wish to resume service to the scion of the House of Black. That meant that Hari would become their master, even if he became the de facto heir through legality rather than blood.
How are you? I floo-called the Burrow hoping to get a hold of you and Ron, but Mrs. Weasley said you left. I suspect you are at that dusty old house used for headquarters, I know your hiding so I won’t say the name in case owls are still being intersected.
“Yes, but this time it affects us more than just compiling evidence against Father and the others.” He paused,” Mother come sit down next to me”. So, Narcissa complied, still managing to look elegant and graceful even without thousand galleon worth of fine dressrobes and French dresses. Draco took a deep and shaky breath, and Narcissa knew something was the matter if her son was this physically shaken up that his perfect Malfoy mask slipped.
"Alright, Potter. Convince me."
Registering Draco’s incredulous expression, Hari pushed Draco slightly flushing red. “Not like that, sheesh. I meant her mannerism is infectious.”
Narcissa was floored, they couldn’t be broke. “What about my inheritance, my dowry, the vault I was given when I turned eighteen, and when I married. Or the gold willed to me from my parents after their deaths?”
Draco wondered. He couldn't remember if the villa had been seized. But then he remembered Minister Shacklebolt's words of those out for their blood and offering a place of protection.
affected him. Or he could some how manage to convince his cousin, Sirius Black, to tell his godson about creatures blood so he could show Hari his dragon. Those were the only two current obstacles they had to overcome to move forward.
Changed the title of this chapter from Funerals and Old Flames to Dying Embers. It was dull and similar to an earlier chapter called Funerals and Trials.
"What about Hari's, then?" Draco tried craning his neck to see Hari but he was blocked by a curtain.
Sheryl snickered. "You'll never know unless you ask. Right Mary-Alice?"
Dudley looked awkwardly between them. He didn't think the kiss was too risqué, he's seen couples snogging on the streets all the time. That little chaste kiss was nothing. A chaste kiss that was between two boys.  "You're together, together?" Dudley asked pointing a finger between Draco and Hari.
"Harry, it is you!" Cho said. "It is so good to see you." She leaned over and hugged him. That snapped him out of his daze.
Clean clothes now was an issue. He didn't want to go into the shops, certain he didn't have enough money, and that the noisy sale girls would not sell to him. Instead he found an open flee market. Here he put his small stature to work, easily ducking beneath racks and hiding behind people to escape detection.
And a few dates did not mean they would become boyfriends.
“Most shops now a day make off-the-rack clothes that are mass marketed worldwide. Measurements are written on the tag.” Hari forced out. “But I don’t know my size. I’ll have to try a few sizes on… Maybe I’ll call her back after all.” Hari said uncertainly, beginning to turn his head to the sales associate.
The Prosecutor cleared his throat gruffly and peered down at first Narcissa and then Draco, completely bypassing Lucius altogether. “A week or so ago, a letter in triplicate arrived by owl to the Department of Magical Law Enforcement. So many letters had been sent to this department, vying for a conviction of the accused, that this letter was almost overlooked; except this letter was addressed directly to the Minster of Magic, the Chief Warlock, and the Head of the Wizengamot.” The Prosecutor paused in his deliverance. “written by none other than Harry Potter" Draco sucked in a sharp breath and couldn't believe what was happening. The Procecuter had to shout over the excitement in the room, "REQUESTING THE RELEASE OF DRACO AND NARCISSA MALFOY!" The chatter stopped at that announcement and the Procecuter cleared his throat, "I will now read this letter to the chamber at large.”
Blaise seemed to take amusement in all their awkwardness. "They have a new outlet for their hot tempers."
… Hari really wanted to feel connected to his mother; in any way he could other than having his mother’s eyes. But he was frightened to be rejected by something he so desperately desired, would be too much.
Mary liked the later idea better. Her imagination went wild at the prospects of superheroes or secret agent spies for interpol.
“…foy? …Malfoy? Mr. Malfoy? Draco Malfoy!” Draco shocked at hearing his name being called, raised his face to reveal eyes wide and red from crying, peering out from behind a disheveled fringe over the left eye, and tears still streaming down his face. His mouth was slightly opened in an “O” shape. “Very good! Now that Mr. Malfoy has joined us on this plain of existence,” once more the Prosecutor sounded amused. “Your testimony, now!”
Draco scoffed looking arrogant as always. “If I have to dress like a Muggle, be seen as a Muggle, I better be the best looking one, and not like some popper street urchin, hadn’t I?” Of course Draco had Muggle clothes it was required to blend in with Muggles when leaving the secluded wizarding villages and shopping centers. That answer irritated Hari, taking it as a personal insult to his own Muggle clothes he wore.
Yet, Harry hesitated taking the last steps across the street. At the moment Grimmauld Place meant sanctuary but It also was the house Sirius Black loathed.
You are all so amazing and supportive. I am nearly to 1K subscribers.
Andromeda decided to let her own instincts guide her. Taking a deep breath in and letting the scent linger in her lungs, before letting it out. He wasn't lying, didn't smell aggressive, just apprehensive. Trusting her instincts, she took a chance and took the nervous boy by the hand. "The worse thing I could do is say no Harry Potter. Just tell me.
Hari’s mouth popped open in asoundment, not at Draco’s proclamation, but at the sudden realization...he pointed his finger accusatory. “You were jealous I got the fly Buckbeak and not you.” He said with no uncertainty.
Draco recognized that spell. “That’s one of Severus’s charms! How did you come across that charm?”
Harry meets a certain blonde prat we all love. Kaa, seriously, stops eating owls. At least long enough that Harry get a chance to read one letter.
"Alright, Dray?" Hari's voice wobbled. "Sounds like it’s not going so well. Maybe we should leave it for another time?"
In the end Sheryl settled on styling his hair in a half up do with French braid crown. And topping his ensemble was a
On the other side of the door, Hari let out a shaky breath. "What the hell was that?" Hari said as he raised his fingertips to a suddenly icy-cold cheek. Draco's hand had been freezing.
"WHAT DO YOU MEAN THE ZOO WILL BE PRESSING CHARGES FOR ALLOWING A BLOODY SNAKE OUT OF CONFINEMENT." Uncle Vernon soundly screamed.
"We'll he isn't here." Petunia drew herself up trying to hide her son from the giant's view unsuccessfully.  "You'll have to find him elsewhere." Petunia reached around her husband and tried to close the door in the half-giants face. One beefy hand reached out and took hold of the door.
“Err, what…?“ Hari tried.
“She sent her parents there, when the Ministry under Voldemort’s regime were hunting down the families of Muggle-borns. She altered their memories, and now is having trouble restoring them.”
“Hari, come look!” Narcissa motioned Hari through the curtained archway. The room was tiny. Against one wall was a writing desk with cracked parchment, frayed feather quills, and dried inkwells. Two bookcases sat on either side of the desk, and another two on either wall. Next to the archway was a single gas lamp mounted to the wall, and an oil lamp sat on a tiny stool by the adjacent wall. No other decorations, lights, or paintings hung on the wall.
Sherly tapped Draco's forearm, the one with the severely scarred and faded Dark Mark. Draco tugged insecurely on his long sleeve shirt, noting the long sleeves on the manakin.
Severus slimmed the lid of the trunk. "Minerva, I don't have time to deal with a spoilt child, who ran away from home..." Severus turned away to gather some other item, but Minerva grabbed his shoulders with surprising strength.
"Urgently? What is this?" Minerva asked as she tracked his movements from potions stores to satchel, to hastily balled robes in a traveling trunk. "A future student has gone missing. Four to be precise, but one in particular...one has special qualities. Harry Potter."
“I name Edward Remus Lupin, my godson, heir to the Most Ancient and Noble House of Black.” The mist changed from white to black briefly, then flashed back.
"Do you want to have a drink?" Hari suddenly blurted out louder than expected with his face flushed a burning red.
Narcissa had Teddy once more, cooing at him and making him giggle. She always wanted more babies. It was a shame she couldn’t bare any more, alpha hormones interrupting her estrogen levels making it difficult for her womb to fertilize. But she snuggled the sweet thing to her anyway, thinking about Hari’s nickname for her great-nephew.
“She was flirting!” Draco bit out. “And you didn’t seem to mind!”
It’s difficult thinking of them as my mum and dad now. I was the one who gave them their memories, but they’ve progressed far past what I’ve ever imagined. They are celebrating their nineteenth wedding anniversary with a second honeymoon in Australia, and I don’t even know how to voice this in a letter, but I think they are trying for a baby.
12 November 1991
Hari could see it now. Cho Chang was all of those things. But she was merely a crush, besides Quidditch they’d had nothing in common. When they kissed, she cried. When they talked, they only talked of Cedric. When they dated, all they did was argue.
“It still doesn’t lessen the guilt… I thought…I thought that with Teddy, I could create a family… like how Sirius wanted to do with me.”
"Stop! You'll only ruin your makeup. No smudging your lip stick." Sheryl said, pushing Draco down in a seat before a mirror.  His reflection scowled back at him.
Harry has never seen Kreacher so excited, and certainly didn't appreciate his enthusiasm at the moment. He currently felt like he could murder the squeaky and chirping house-elf all over again. He didn't think he had any taste buds left to enjoy even the orange and cranberry scones currently being served. His throat and tongue felt like sand.
------
In the books Hagrid explains to Harry, "17 Sickles in a Galleon, 29 Knuts in a Sickle", which means there are 493 Knuts in a Galleon.
Hari took that moment to interrupt. "Hagrid says there isn't a wizard alive who isn't half-blood or less."
“Let’s go, now.”
“Ah, yes Master Orion made Sirius drink nearly a whole bottle of this when Orion’s prized Bourbon was discovered in his room. Sirius was not enjoying it so much then either. Master Orion was also a Bourbon drinker. Lesson number one, be awares of the proof. Don’t be asking for just any Bourbon. That there’s a 94 proof, 18 year charred oak. ” Snapping his fingers Kreacher banished the bottle back to the bar, and another took its place. This ones…I thinks more your style. Tries this. Slow sip and let sit on your tongue, before swallowing, no gulp like before.”
"Who's the new owner than if not family." Blaise inquired.
He realized by Draco's confused look, he didn't know what that is. "Um...drag is were men dress up as woman for fun and entertainment, and the karaoke bit is singing. They are called drag queen's. Not everyone who attends have to get dressed up, but If we go no doubt Sheryl will rope us into dressing up."
If Sheryl had to guess, she would have pegged the boy as asexual. He never took interest in any of the unique patrons that frequented her place, and never spoke of any past relationships. It could stem from the obvious low self-esteem issue that he had. Many patrons flocked to the restaurant to get a glimpse of the often brooding teen with killer eyes. Those emerald eyes often slayed many hearts. Not that Hari noticed.  Sheryl had to nurse a few broken hearts in Hari’s wake.
It appears I was wrong about the weasel family abusing Harry. Their best mates now, and nearly inseparable.
Draco stuffed his hands in his pockets. “I threw out a book on the Dark Arts. Father gave it to me the night before I took the Dark Mark.I had forgotten about it as it was hidden in the lining of my trunk under a
It is just Zabini and I in the dorm tonight, we sent the others to the infirmary. But still I lock my curtains and keep my trunks locked tight, just in case.
"Better luck next time,  babe." C'iemone says, but when she turned around whispered to Draco and Hari as best one could over the music, "she has no singing talent. She's total tone deaf."
"Minus ten points from Slytherin for tardiness and another ten points deducted for not completing the homework assignment on time. The assignment must still be completed in its entirely by the end of this week with an extra foot in length." -Snape
Draco shooing Hari out of his room thinking cleaning up his room would take a while, but it only took minutes to re-sort, organize, and gather trash to be disposed of. He had a bag of Dudley’s old clothes by the door that he was going to ask Draco if he wanted to accompany him to a bonfire.
Perhaps if he woke, he’d think more on the meaning of this dream. The irony of questioning the meaning of his dream was not lost to him. Perhaps, he should have taken Trelawny’s Oneiromancy unit on dreams more seriously. Then his Occlumency lessons with Snape would have gone better. But for right now he allowed himself the pleasure of Draco's hot breath on his skin, and sweet lips brushing his collarbone.
And that was the least she could say about the other three missing Muggle-born children. She'll file the proper forms to have the Unspeakable run an investigation.
"Wstimsit?' The muffled question asked against Hari's numb and very uncomfortable shoulder.
Nott, that sneaky conniving bastard, has already tried to insert his dominance over me. I am a Malfoy! I showed him. I hexed him with the best Pimple jinx
Harry looked around frantic, not knowing what to do. So far, all he has ever been able to do is unlock doors, vanish glass, and heal wounds (Two of those were involuntary) . No, no, no, no, no!
------
Hari sat back on the floor with his head resting on the cushion besides Draco's knees. He let out a whooshing breath in relief of not spilling the rare potion all over the place. "It'll scar, but it shouldn't be too noticeable" He mumbled.
“I suppose you are going to be as tight lipped as ever, about where you’ve been these last two years.” She said to Hari. When she didn’t get a response, she stepped out of the way.
Sheryl tilted her head a bit and tapped a finger to her scarlet lips in thought. Despite the haughty exterior, she knew what it was like to have disapproving parents.
"Never! If anything, it would be omegas. Omegas are rare, perfect, fertile creatures that any alpha would love to have as a mate. Alphas are just very proud to begin with." Draco defended. "Betas are the only one of the three that do not have a creatures manifestation, though you could be classified as beta and not have any creatures blood at all."
He didn’t wake. There was no pain.
Hari continued oblivious to the silent cry in Draco’s heart. “When I look at you, I see that same struggle within you to survive. We just went about pursuing it differently. I wanted to live, you wanted to not die.” Draco didn’t see the difference at first, but then suddenly he did. Hari said so himself, he
Hello my wonderful readers,
Sensing Hari’s discomfort, he tilted Hari’s chin up. “What is it, love?”
“After all the things I’ve done…I don’t deserve…Why?!” Draco’s words lodged in his throat.
Draco shook his head once and tried unsuccessfully to blow the hair out of his eyes. He raised his head and looked no one else in the eye, except the Prosecutor, straightening his shoulders, he declared clearly if not a little raspy from crying, “I’m guilty. I do not pretend to be otherwise. The chargers against me are all true; I have the Dark Mark, I am a Death Eater. Those two actions have single handedly become the things I regret the most in my life thus far. My actions as a Death Eater has caused harm to a great deal of people. In trying to complete the tasks set to me by the Dark Lord, I used the Imperius Curse on Katie Bell, trying to have her deliver a Cursed Necklace to Katie Bell and was gravely injured and could have died. Ronald Weasley consumed the poison Mead meant as a Christmas present for Dumbledore; if it wasn’t for the quick thinking of Harry Potter, his friend would be dead. On the night of Dumbledore’s death, I finally finished repairing the Vanishing Cabinet and let Death Eaters into the Castle. I did not know the werewolf Fenrir Greyback, was among the Death Eaters who infiltrated the Castle. He repulses me. Many people were hurt that night because of my actions. Dumbledore died, I did not kill him, but I am responsible for his death.” With a last deep breath, Draco looked at his mother on the other side of his father. “I am guilty, my mother is not. I request that the Jury and the Wizengamot be kind to her.”
"No Hari...shhh. I'm trying to...Blaise saw the obituary and wants to meet up...today in Muggle London...he says, he's sorry he couldn't make it to the funeral and wants to make it up to me." Draco sat up, "Hari, can I?"
Yeah it's me, I am back! Sorry for the long, long, very long wait. Hope this super duper long chapter is worth the wait.
“Don’t thank me, it was a unanimous decision of the Wizengamot, you two are innocent.” Kingsley chuckled but spoke seriously to them. “I understand you may not choose to stay at Malfoy Manor. And despite charges being dropped many pureblood sympathisers will be out for your blood. I will arrange an Auror escort to follow and ensure your wellbeing for the time being. Once you have your affairs in order, there might be a protected place for you to go, if you so choose.” He spoke quietly to them, and shook each of the Malfoy’s hands, inconspicuously slipping a piece of paper into their grasps. Then he walked away as if nothing happened.
He sobbed for his parents, only twenty-one when murdered by Voldemort. He sobbed for the life he could have had. He sobbed for the responsibility placed on his shoulders at fourteen months old. He sobbed for all those brief moments of happiness at Hogwarts ripped away each year; always fighting, always surviving, always looking over his shoulder. He sobbed, because it was finally over; he survived but didn’t know how to live. He’s alive but how does he live knowing nearly everyone who cared for him is dead. Sirius, his godfather, didn’t have a chance to enjoy freedom before he was killed, locked away in Azkaban and then in his loathed childhood home. Freedom; Dobby was a freed house-elf with no master and a dozens of mix-matched socks on his feet and killed while saving Harry’s life. Tonks and Remus, whom just found each other, married, and had a baby, now killed in the war and their son is left an orphan. Collins Creevey, just sixteen and had his whole life ahead of him and that was ended like a flash of his camera.
Hari tilted his head in thought. “…Sheryl might have rubbed off on me more than I thought.”
She did; however, send a Christmas gift of an unextraordinary vase. That was the extent of her correspondence with her sister. She never got a letter in reply. She pushed the hurt away. It's not like she cared one iota about her freak of a sister, and her no doubt just as strange and abnormal son.
He found himself in the crisps aisle. He noticed some of Dudley's favorite crisps that he was never allowed to touch. Feeling like he was getting away with something naughty, he took a bag of those and then a half dozen other choices. Then he made his way over to the candy section, and finally drinks and checkout.
This also means he would be courting a minor, and proper etiquette tells him he needs to ask permission from a parent or guardian. At this point Draco was just going around in circles.
Draco woke up later that morning, wincing at the bright light of the late morning sun streaming through the open window. His head was pounding and his tongue felt like cotton and tasted like rubbish. He didn't remember how he got to bed last night.
Andromeda Tonks née Black was at her wits end. Edward Remus Lupin, or more affectionately nicknamed Teddy, after her own late husband wouldn't stop screaming. The Muggle neighbors would surely hear and start coming over to offer assistance. They were very caring people, but Andromeda could not handle another hassle at the moment. Teddy was only a month old, although having not contracted the Werewolf gene from his father, he clearly took after her own daughter, Nymphadora, a metamorphmagus. His tiny head of hair was currently changing from a sickly green to an angry red, and Andromeda didn't know what was wrong with him.
***Hari’s Flashback Age 15 with some Sheryl’s POV***
Narcissa was waiting for him at the entrance of the Manor, several trunks protected by fire retardant shields floating by her side with the aid of house-elf magic. This was all planned out, well they were supposed to burn down the Manor as they left, not rushing out due to Draco not being able to control his body. Narcissa hugged her son none the less, sensing his distress levels and said “Don't worry about what cannot by undone. We are ready, non? Oh, mon petit dragon, you are handsome” Draco grew a few more inches in height, his features became sharper-if that was even possible with his already pointy features, and his hair grew in length to brush his shoulders. As planned, they walked out of the Manor together, three trunks in front, two behind, with two house-elves in toe.
Feeling lighthearted, Hari slipped out of the room with a dopey smile on his face. He had a lot to ponder on and so left them to finish their conversation.
The five new Queen's were paraded on stage. Aryls was first in line, proudly strutting around. Aryls said she was dressed as Padmé from a Star Wars. Draco had no idea where that was, but when the DJ made the announcement calling her titles as scripted, "Her Royal Highness, Queen Amidala and her excellency, Senator Padmé Amidala of Naboo!" The crowd cheered.
“I killed you, I’m sorry, I killed you!” He was babbling, words tumbling over each other.
Harry discovers he's not alone at 12 Grimmauld Place
There lied the other problem. It was indecently short and wouldn't be surprised if his penis was showing from beneath the leather skirt. Paling, Draco glanced in the mirror.
Not that most dreams followed reason to begin with, but as dream logic went; he was aware that he was in a dream and felt the compulsion to move forward. His body had no choice but to follow.
Bill let his shoulder go and went to move around him, “Good luck,” Bill laughed mockingly, “you’re going to need it.” He said as he passed on the left to get to the basement to Floo home. Inside Bill’s head he said,
Draco kept a strong grip onto Hari's hand as the undertakes escorted the remains down into the crypt. Hari didn't complain, only accepted the pain for what it was--Draco's.
I've decided to help. I guess I am putting my own studies on hold to study up on dragons.
Narcissa was setting up a picnic blanket of all things, and Andromeda had pulled out a radio, with a flick of her wand, the nob was randomly switching through channels.
Aryls was there next to Hari pulling him away towards the stage. Draco blinked. He was alone in a room full of unfamiliar scents and bodies, and noise. Hari was not longer with him. Draco watched Hari shrink through the crowd, the further he got away the more panic started to sink into Draco's bones. Then he saw Hari move up the steps to the stage. He could see him visibly shaken.  Arlys must be in this round, because she never left Hari's side.
Draco finally closed his mouth with an audible snap. “Potter, you are outrageous.  How can you just flippantly tell me the Deathly Hallows are real, and then shrug it off that you own one?”
“You do?” Both Draco and Hari chorused, Hari in dread and Draco in disbelief.
The legend said that Melusine was a beautiful woman of wonderful mannerism; kind, noble, beautiful, and good-willed. She married into royalty but she was an outsider who did not share in the same beliefs as the common people.
Mon Mère said to share, but I don't think I will. Blaise my only friend this year doesn't eat sweets. I've been studying with a few other Slytherin's from my year. Pansy Parkinson is one such Slytherin that I am having a hard time shaking loose. For some reason she is now attached to me at the hip. I helped her one time, not a very Slytherin thing to do, bam I am stuck with the pug nosed girl for the rest of the year.
The sound of a gentle
“This room is mostly used for guests who do not have access to the Black’s personal library upstairs; it's secluded enough that private floo calls could be taken here. Dot, can you hear me?” Narcissa called a little louder leaning closer to the tiny flame.
A wailing sound echoed on the stone stairs, catching their attention. Eliana ruffled her feathers and abandoned Hari’s soft scratches to sit above the pans. Kokoa huffed in irritation at the unsanitariness of having an owl on the pots she used to cook with.
"Slytherins" He scoffed with an eyeroll, "... what do you want?"
Draco only hovered over the chimneys of the row of townhouses. From this angle they could see the line shimmering mirage between the disillumination charm that separated them from the Muggle homes. The truly magnificent restoration of the Black townhouse; five stories, lavish garden, and a gleaming white glassed owlery atop the roof.
"Oh pooh!" Sheryl exclaimed. "You could have pulled off that look ten times better." She said to Draco. " I would have seen to that."
“Well, well, well. Look what we have here boys, a confession. And just in time for the trial. Now we get to see why Minister Shacklebolt is giving these two Death Eater scum special treatment.” Three scarlet clad Aurors stood outside the usually closed transparent barrier that separated the white room from the rest of the Ministry building.
Then a miracle happened. Not in the sense that his magic kicked in and washed his hair for him, that would be too easy for him, instead he spotted a gym. A gym with showers. It was easy enough to sneak passed the tall counters in the front, snatch a towel, and secure a stall. When concerned people asked him where his parents were, he just said, "I'm ten not five. My mummy says I'm too old to take a shower with her." He faked pouted and left quickly after that if they asked too much questions.
Draco unhelpfully tried to mime how big Teddy was with the width of his hands.
Stay Awesome!
It's been two days since Harry was put in the Hospital wing. He still hadn't woken up once. Whenever possible I visited Harry. I left my favorite candies by his side. Whenever the Weasel or Mud-blood wasn't around I sat by his side. Dumbledore caught me one time, but didn't say anything.
It appeared that Draco had attempted to skin his forearm to remove the Mark. He let out a shaky sigh of relief.
"Fine?" Hari asked incredulously.
, roused him from a fitful sleep beneath the stoop of a shop called, Nik's Bake n' Take Bakery. Then he heard the click of a lock and a bell jingle. It was the toe of someone's boot and a man's raspy voice that jolted Harry into full wakefulness with a racing heart. "Kid! Hey, Kid. Wake up."
Draco pondered as he trailed his hand over the banister on his walk down the flight of stairs. …
Just like a prayer you know I'll take you there
They both watched as the bike shrunk smaller and smaller under the tight control of Hari’s magic. Hari then pocketed the bike.  They exited the street together.
"God I am so tired. No more alcohol tonight. I mean it." Ollie says pointing his pen at them over the notepad. He then ripped off the receipt and set it on the table.  Draco was surprised to note that not only was Hari's tab cleared, but the price on the entrées were also halved.
"That was one of the scariest things I have ever done." Hari says, clutching at Draco's fur caped shoulders.
He emerged from the cupboard to see a mountain of brightly wrapped birthday presents that nearly took up the entire table. Harry had no doubt that Dudley would have everything he asked for and then some. With an annoyed and only mildly jealous eye roll, Harry turned to the stove to finish preparing breakfast. He would have to prepare a full Irish, unless he wanted to be burned on the stove top again for not preparing enough food. Harry of course, would get none of it. It's a good thing he hid those stale crackers then.
Draco grinned like the cat who ate the cream. "Hari and I are dating."
A light bulb went off in his uncle's head. "BOI-EY!" Harry's uncle shouted at him in a rampant charge towards his nephew. The hit game swifter than expected. Harry's already frail and bruised body collapsed to the floor, blood spurting everywhere and his whole left side of his face erupted in pain, while white and dark spots swam in his vision when his head hit the cement floor.
He glanced over at the trio of tables in a cluster, that Hari agreed to wait for him and saw that Hari was no longer alone.
Draco pecked his mother on the cheek before scooting up the stairs.
Draco was definitely a tomato at this point. "I did not wipe my mouth off after kissing you. My lips were turning blue from
"So, when you were a child you wanted to read books about me. You wrote about me in your, excuse me, your
"Yes. just one question; what is a page?" Hari laughed with humor.
“Your French is atrocious." Draco responded with the snobbery that only the French can possess.
When he awoke it was in the dark; skin flushed, body soaked with sweat, and an uncomfortable wet stickiness in the front of his pajama bottoms. His whole body shook worse than a leaf clinging to a branch of the whomping willow tree on Hogwarts grounds.
And Hari lost it.
I knew that he knew I knew about the baby dragon so I came to gloat. I pretended to Madam Pomfrey that I needed to borrow a book. Honestly that Madam should have realized we were from rival houses.
was all Draco could think with glee as he led Hari to his room.  His dragon would have preferred scenting Hari, personally, but this was the next best thing.
Draco thought with a curled lip.
12 June 1992
A dream could just be a dream without it being a vision.
"Are you alright, Dray?" Hari asked so softly, almost sweetly in Draco's ears. On a shuttered gasp, he nodded, not yet able to form words.
A mighty fist banged on the door, shaking its frame like a battering ram. If the door had been weathered or rotted, it might have fallen in; however, it only served at cracking a tiny window within its frame.
Draco heard his mother scream, and frightened he sped up, running the final two feet into the house and stopped in his tracks, "mo..." the word dying on his lips. Harry rushed in behind him to see the joyous reunion himself. Narcissa and Andromeda had each other by their forearms as the jumped and twirled in each others arms, shrieking their laughter, and tears running down their cheeks.
Teddy, a metamorphmagus, like his late mum, rabidly changed his hair from wild yellow, spastic green, and bright turquoise. The baby would lift his head, grunting with effort, before collapsing forward and whaling.
He wouldn't starve in his cupboard for once. Because Harry Potter could do magic. Yes. Magic.
Wanting his completion, wanting to claim Potter as his and no other, and knowing the bite would send Potter over the edge into oblivion with him, Draco yanked him up by his hair, causing him to give a painful yelp, and keeping him upright by placing a hand over Potter's abdomen muscles, feeling his own cock outlined beneath smooth skin and tight muscles. Potter was still speared on Draco’s cock, knot finally locking them together, when he whispered in his ear for the first time, “Harry, your mine now.” He roughly yanked Potter into a bruising kiss, all tongue and clashing teeth, before pushing him back onto all fours, still buried inside, and bit into the tender flesh at the nape of his neck, and finally claiming Harry Potter as his. Draco threw back his head, mouth gaping, blood gleaming against his teeth and roared out his orgasm. Potter was also orgasming, brought to the end and finally tumbling over it, as Draco’s hot seed spurted into him in short, hot, intervals.
"I'm adding a new rule, no signing people up for karaoke without their consent." Sheryl says, worrying her thumbnail between her teeth.
Realizing he was treading on thin ice, Draco backtracked. "For the men, who weren't able to woo her, Hari." When Hari only grumbled, but the fire was mostly burned out in his eyes, Draco continued. "Anyway, this book documents not the births of my ancestors, but when they presented and what their secondary gender is. See, mostly beta, beta, beta, oh here, my third cousin, Callidora, or maybe my fourth cousin, is a female alpha just like my mother. It even says what their manifestation is. Look, my mother white antipodean opaleye dragon, just as I am. Dear cousin, Callidora is a Bugbear. Not from the Black line, Hari." Draco flipped a page. "Oh, look it says my third great-grandfather was also an alpha and manifested as another opaleye dragon. See, So I can trace what lines my inheritance is from." Draco said with pride.
Groping blindly for his glasses on the tiny shelf above his head, he heard a rustling of plastic as his hand grazed over a plastic packet. Pulling the item down into his lap first then groped for his glasses once more. Putting those on with his right hand while his left reached for the string to turn on the light above his cott. Suddenly his face broke open in a megawatt grin. He remembered everything from the night prior.
"I..uh...not yet, Blaise. I'll tell her in person, where I can swear her to secrecy." Draco decided.
13 November 1991
From the archway a gentle heat came wafting out, carrying with it the delicious scent baked yeast and other delectable smells. When the warmth of the shop mingled over the chill of the morning on Harry's skin, he shivered uncontrollably before the smell caused his stomach to let out a rumbling sound.
with high woven peaks and black gems.
When Draco left Hari on the third floor nursery, he had another destination. Minding Asclepius on the banister, Draco eagerly swept up to the fourth stairs. Instead of making a right at the stairs and passing the lavatory to his own room, he stepped into Hari’s room.
"Cho-cho, there you are. I got us the tickets for the theatre." Dudley said, uncomfortably looking at Hari as if he'd say something outrageous. Hari looked between he and Cho in confusion. Cho looked wearily back and forth between the too.
Draco unclasped his hands and let them hang loosely between his knees and looked up at his mother lost; speaking as if from a daze, “After we questioned it, the Goblins discovered the loophole in the contract, they didn’t question combining the vaults then, because Father presented forged documents with a sample of your magic. It was too easy. And then the Dark Lord turned around and stole the Malfoy’s wealth.”
"I am taking this," He said gallantly, while holding up a pile of banknotes. "You owe me, not the other way around. Think it as a fee for services rendered." He said, sarcastically. They worked him like a slave. Well this is a slave revolt.
Draco was grinning as his eyes devoured the content of the letter in hand. That grin bloomed into a full toothed smile and his teeth flashed white as he actually chortled. “It appears that the chieftess has seen it fit to return my vault key. Ministry investigation be damned.”
The reasons for my absence is life keeps getting in the way. I work during the days, come home to take care of my family, and if I am not too tired once everyone is in bed, I write.
Hari just raised his black eyebrow with a smug smirk on his face. “Talent. It’s in my blood.”
Harry's grin broadened as he pumped the air with his fists in excitement. "yes." he whispered in excitement. only to jump when his aunt barked through the door, "What did you say?"
"Well, I am going to celebrate." So saying Alice took a shot glass and pitched it back. "Woo, strong stuff."
"I don't drink. I'm supporting Rossi. I quite smoking too." Emmet said proudly.
He drew out awkwardly.
Andromeda was pale, numb, she didn't know what to do. Her Ted always paid all the bills, but he was gone now. Reported dead over the radio station Potterwatch. She was barely making by with the money her husband had taken out of the bank accounts for her, before he went on the run before his death. Her daughter and husband unable to help pay bills themselves, because they were long out of a work; him being a werewolf and her being an ex-Auror and known member of the Order of the Phoenix.   Then Death Eaters were reported in the area and Remus and Ted left Andromeda alone to care for her heavily pregnant daughter. They had all had to flee the neighborhood, she had only just arrived home a week ago and there was indeed a pile of unopened post waiting for her when she returned. Not soon after the birth of Teddy, Nymphadora left to fight in the final battle with her wayward husband, and they both perished in the fight.  Now here she was, a popper, husband dead, daughter and son-in-law dead, and grandson left an orphan for her to care for.
"Well, no. I...er...don't know much about my family. Sirius and Remus were the only ones to really tell me anything helpful about them. Well actually Severus Snape was a friend of my mothers, hated my father, because he was actually the worst bully, despised me because of it. Rather unfairly." Harry said in conversation as they packed. "I couldn't believe it at first, I only ever heard good things about my father, and here was proof that my father was a worse bully than Draco Malfoy." Harry laughed.
For a second, Nik's kind amber eyes came to mind. But when the man spoke, Harry could hear that it was not the sound of Nik's voice, but a strangers. It didn't sound crazed, "Come on down, Alleycat. It's safe."
“You’ve improved a lot since third year.” Hari said.
£1 = $1.80 (roughly)
will cool off your
“What?” he whispered through a lust fueled haze.
Roomers say Harry Potter was seen entering Diagon Alley through the Leaky Cauldron of all places, yesterday. After 10 years he’s finally shown up. He’s the same age as me. Somehow I thought he was older. They say he was with a Giant of all things. I don’t know much about Giants, but I don’t think you can tame one as a pet. They are sentiment creatures after all, capable of a least a little cognitive thought, right? The Prophet ran an article saying Harry Potter was raised in a protected tribe of Giants in Mesopotamia.
Dear Journal,
Was he imagining it, or did his pillow smell like Draco as well. It was soothing. Eyes heavy with the events of the day, a smile graced his lips in sleep
"The Black heir, but...but, I know I inherited the money, the house, and Kreacher, but..."
Hari looked worried as he paused at the door. "You don't find that a bid odd, like a set up?"
Truth behind the legend.
was exactly, but he decided to call it
Draco gets an awesome new haircut.
"I don't want to know what they will say when they find out we're dating." Draco sighed out.
Harry smirked when everyone turned their heads towards the door when it opened unannounced.
Dear Mrs. Malfoy, we wish to offer our deepest condolences for the death of your husband, Lucius Abraxas Malfoy. Mr. L.A. Malfoy’s death, occurring by asphyxiation at 03:17:19 on 19th June 1998. No ill will or harm shall befall the remains after death and fall in the care of our Undertaker department.
“Harry Potter,” Kreacher spoke up finally, voice high and squeaky. “I no longer wish to serve anymore masters but you, sir. You saved my life, you healed me. Kreacher is a better house-elf now. You healed me, I was corrupt, like this house was by dark magic. You, with Light magic, purified this house and me. You punish my intolerable behavior, killed the old me, and bring me back to life. I serve you and your family for life.” With a final head bob, Kreacher put an end to all that being freed nonsense. Pouring a glass of water to clear his master’s palate.
Having Teddy to worry about, Andromeda didn’t step too close. Instead she once again used her wand, levitating the letters into the air and into the fire.
“What are you squabbling about?” Narcissa asks.
Taking a deep breath in and then on the exhale, “
It looks painful.
Harry didn’t know how to read music; he listened by ear and played by heart. He just didn’t have the patience to learn it. He would only call himself a novice at best, and an amateur  at worst. Harry learned the basics from the cat obsessed old women who babysat him when the Dursley’s went away on vacation. She only lived a few blocks away, still in Little Whinging Surrey, making it a convenient and cheap way for the Dursley’s to temporarily get rid of him while they had fun.  Mrs. Arabella Figg often bored him half to death, talking about her prize-winning cats. But sometimes she’d take a break and try to teach him the piano. So from listening to Mrs. Figg ramble on about cats, the piano, and escape into the garden to pull weeds, Harry learned a bit about the functioning of the piano, how to play, and how to tune one.
I was walking with Crabbe and Goyle to the Training Grounds for our first flying lessons when the incident happened; of course I already know how to fly. I was never able to get Father to buy me a broom though, apparently Father isn’t that easy to bully. I was walking behind Harry and his trio of friends, Granger, Longbottom, and the Weasel, pretending like I was actually a part of their group when Longbottom dropped his Remembrall. I snatched it up. No one even noticed. Harry had been ignoring me since Hogwarts Express. It was time to let “Operation Get Harry Potter To Pay Attention To Me” commence.
“I’m guilty, your innocent. I have the mark, I let the Death Eaters into the Castle. I am responsible for Dumbledore’s death…”
Mrs. Figg was more than a crazy old cat lady, whose house smelt like cooked cabbage, or who rambled on about classical music and musicals. She was actually a Squib who worked for Professor Dumbledore under the Order of the Phoenix, and sole assignment was to watch out for Harry Potter until he was reintroduced to the wizarding world and then once Voldemort returned. She had to keep up the pretense of the dreadful babysitter, so the Dursley’s wouldn’t think she was treating him nicely, and get another worse babysitter. When she wasn’t undercover keeping an eye on Harry, she was a well-known breeder of hybrid pets; half–Kneazle and half-cat.
Hari didn't do well when he had too many choices. He didn't respond well when those choices were taken away from him either, but what could he do? It wasn’t like he’d ever had the chance to exercise much self-determination when it came to the major events of his life.
“Well…well, I mean, uh…not date. I’ve never…no” The words were having a hard time coming out. “like a trial. To see if, we get on well enough to…date.” Hari finished defeated with a lack of better words for what he wanted.
Only once. Nonetheless, now she had hundreds of children to look after. Four were missing.
Meanwhile in Surrey, an animal loving half-giant approaches the rows of nearly identical houses of Number 4 Privet Drive.
Hari has THE TALK with Narcissa.
As they reentered the drawing room, Hari heard Draco say with conviction, “Hari will not like that idea t’all.”
Stepping out of the entrance threshold, Harry nervously fidgeting around with the quiet and attentive stare of Teddy gazing up at him, as if he could see into his mind, judging him. Sitting down as carefully as possible in the cramped little living room of Andromeda's home, he finally looked up to meet his hostesses eyes.
Harry said, "Surprise!"
were lined in black with silver specs like stars speckled over each eyelid. His cheekbones highlighted with
In that moment Hari was annoyed with himself for thinking Draco was stunning, he had always been annoyingly enough, haughty good looking. Hari was always able to pick him out of a crowd of over a hundred students just by his signature white-blonde hair. He didn’t understand his sudden reaction to the blonde now. He knew the wizard since adolescence. He could still see the slim boy from the robe shop with sleek, perfectly styled platinum blonde hair, pointy features, and haughty attitude that grated against his nerves from day one.
Enjoy!
Hari was suddenly dragged into Draco's crushing grip as he twisted on the spoke to aparate back to Grimmauld Place. Head reeling from the dizzying compressed journey, Hari held his head and stomach, before Draco dragged him inside and silent stormed up the stairs.
Criminal trials in the Department of Magical Law Enforcement are held in the basement level of the Ministry of Magic beneath London. The accused are held secure in chained chairs in the center of a giant colosseum like hexagon chamber where fifty members of the Wizengamot sit above on benches, wearing plum colored robes with giant silver “W” embroidered on their chests. Along with the Judge, Prosecutor, Jurors, and Scribe; the Chief Warlock, the Head of the Wizengamot, and the Minister of Magic reside. Most trials are brief and concise, where the accused may present witnesses to be questioned by the Prosecutor.
“He nearly bit my head off when I tried to tell him that.”  Draco said. Narcissa laughed.
"NO ONE BY THAT NAME LIVES HERE. LEAVE OR I'll CALL THE POLICE." The angry man was shouting.
Harry Potter!!!
Trout grinned. "You smart, Alleycat. Resourceful...you and me, we can have some type of working business. I teach you how to survive here on the streets, you be my fetcher. I don't like thieving, but with no money and no clean clothes, respectful business don't let the homeless in. You, are a child. easily overlooked. Tiny to get in small places. You could scavenge a few items here and there for me. We share the bounty."
It was nearing dawn once more, but Hari couldn’t sleep. The restless magic in his blood hummed with energy. Narcissa ensured him that the high would wear off and he’d more than likely crash.
“Right, I think I read that in your diary.” Draco bumped his head in the wardrobe. Cursing, he pulled his injured head out, glaring at Hari.
"Ah-ha! gotcha." Hari said smugly. For a drunk person he was awfully gentle as he pulled away the bandages from Draco's injury, wincing in symphanty as he pulled away dried blood with flesh in the process. In unsteady hands, he took the stopper off the phial and took a couple drops of dittany to the mess of Draco's hand. Green vapor appeared as the skin slowly knitted back together. The scars now appeared faintly pink, against albester skin.
Draco looked down blankly at the piece of parchment in front of him, shading in a few lines. “Goyle drew that, I just charmed it to move.” He had been quite proud of that charm work, it was his first successful feat. Slowly he made the proper incantation,

Forgetting formality, she lifted her skirts giving her enough room to run, and rushed through the grass to fall over Harry in an excited heap, hugging him. She was babbling in French, the only words he knew were "Merci, Monsieur Potter, Merci". She then gave him first one kiss on the right cheek, then the left, and a brief peck on the lips. Harry was stunned at seeing this usually rigid and cold women, so full of emotions.
Behind Hari's back, Draco's hands were clasped together in prayer as he silently begged his mother to stop embarrassing him, as Hari's shoulders were shaking with laughter.
He liked looking at Draco’s body and he enjoyed the kissing, way too much. Did he have to put a label on his feelings? Couldn’t he just enjoy it for once, like a normal teenager? Draco said he loved him, but what did he want from him?
A quick look at a family tree
I must not stress this enough, THE CORONAVIRUS IS A SERIOUS VIRUS.
When Cleopatra was called, Hari gave a nervous smile and wave. He nearly tripped over his own feet as he turned to hide behind Aryls. The crowd seemed to coo at Hari's mishap.
"I had a lot to be afraid of, Potter. He lived in my home for three years. I've seen so many unthinkable things. He...he, made me do unthinkable things, alright. Things that I am rightly, ashamed of." Draco shivered and unconsciously was gripping the scars of the Dark Mark on his forearm. "So let's drop the subject for now...please?" The last part costing him greatly. It wasn't often he found himself begging for things.
Hari frowned at the memory. To this day, he preferred his meat well-done and he couldn’t even look at rare or medium rare meat, the sight of even a twinge of pink blood turning his stomach. His favorite foods were barbecue for the burnt and smoky taste.
"Honest." Harry pleaded seeing his chance at practice slipping away.
Severus was there. "Severus.." Minerva said between pinched lips.
The way our Houses are divided is unfair. I don’t wish to be in any other house, but I don’t want to be this far away from Harry either.
it for the rest of the night. I will return it to you at breakfast." Hari countered.
At first they made a selection of sizes, because something about Muggle made products couldn’t be adjusted magically for size, they made their way to the fitting room. Draco was looking forward to this part the most-Hari parading around in front of him half-naked.
Harry ducked and tried getting away, the man in smelly brown and coat with dark stains kept swinging and advancing. He somehow ducked beneath the fire escape and thought he was caught dead for sure. Then he saw the ladder. He could try to climb up over the man's head. But he's have to reach it. Then he thought he'd be able to jump possibly to the other fire escape and escape up to the roof and then possibly over to a safer side.
Harry thought bitterly.
Grateful for a momentary reprieve, Andromeda carefully arranged Harry's awkward arms in the proper position to hold a newborn. It was adorably obvious that Harry Potter had never held a baby before as he stiffly held his godson for the first time, swaying from the shoulders without moving his hips to try to soothe the crying baby.
Draco was irked. “Fine don’t believe my words, I’ll show you.” And with a huff, he actually let go of the broom and fell backwards. Hari’s quick reflexes had him steadying the broom as the second body weight suddenly disappeared.
"There is nothing stopping you." Aryls said already standing with an embarrassed belch that caught her off guard. "Oops, sorry. I don't think my Ginny went well with the greasy food."
He couldn't very well owl his friends. Ron was still grieving over the death of his brother, and Hermione was trying to find her parents to restore their memories.
to do that for him. He didn’t deserve it.
***End of SMUT/ You've missed Draco's inheritance in
Looking at Hari for a moment, he settled back and raised his outstretched hand towards the canopy above their heads and let his dragon manifest to the surface. Fingers elongated, white scales that reflected light erupted over his skin, and claws sprouted where manicured human nails once sat at the tips of each finger.
"Stand aside ... stand aside, girl ..."
Draco only scoffed. "No."
Norbert?!!!! He calls her Norbert!! Are you blind. Do you know anything about dragons. Clearly she is female.
Sean Mason was typical popular high school jock, captain of the Lacrosse team, and took his cheerleader girlfriend to prom. He was expected to accept a full ride sports scholarship to Louisiana State, and become a professional athlete. But that wasn’t his dream but his fathers, and that wasn’t what he wanted his life to be. So Sean packed a bag, and with the aid of his supporting baby sister waitressing tips, accepted the culinary scholarship to a University in London, and never even gave his parents a forwarding address. Once in London, he changed his name to Sherryl and never looked back. Now living as the person
“Draco? Shut up.” Hari kissed Draco swiftly before jumping up, wiping suddenly sweaty hands as he said, “It’s decided then. We’ll do what I do best.” Draco’s heartbeat calmed down instantly.
He thought,
Hari thought he liked Draco all the more for it.
Hari ignored the question and asked instead. “Why does it look like you just stepped off the cover of a Vogue magazine?”
Letting out a shaky breath he dragged both hands across his face in frustration.  Pulling his legs up to his chest, Hari wrapped his arms around his knees and buried his flushed face in its cradle.
"Ginny? Oh, Ginny. We broke up after Dumbledore's funeral. I didn't want anyone going after her because of me. I haven't really spoken with her about getting back together. There just hadn't been enough time, with the funerals and what not..." Hari trailed off. "I don't know if I feel the same way anymore." Hari said sullenly.
Then again how often did Hari get a chance to indulge in Muggle snacks? Not that often.
Sheryl saw the brief slip of the mask and answered the unspoken question. “These here are American portion sizes. The challenge is two large entrees, three large sides, and a large beverage. You think you’re skinny frame can eat all that in around an hour?” Draco’s face paled trying to imagine the amount of food. How can one stomach take all that food
"And if I lose?" Hari said.
"Eighteen, he just had a birthday before he moved in here." Hari said.
The one Auror stuttered. “No, ma’am…not… not prisoners, we are your guard detail…protection.” He finally managed to get out.
Draco turned the nob of the door, and pushed slightly. Justin lost his footing and stumbled into the restroom. Draco's talons hooked into the collar of Justin's jumper jacket and tugged him around the cramped room. Hari followed inside blindly. His mind not catching up with the action.
The same hand then followed the line of Hari’s body up and then back down. Fingers glided over the expanse of Hari’s chest, descended down to tweak one perk nipple, then lower still to trail fingers through his happy trail, stroking Hari’s sated and limp cock.
Hari sat dumbfounded. Draco looked up from his cleaning to see Hari’s gaze. Supporting his weight on one hand by Hari’s head, he dipped his other fingers low and Hari felt Draco’s fingers trail over his  cum splattered chest and raised them to Hari’s lips.
Draco’s smirk fell away as he looked at the metal monster that Hari was standing up by some type of metal twig.
“Oh, no worries dear. You’re not disturbing anyone. I’m normally up with Teddy at this hour anyway. Why are you up, dear? We weren’t going to wake you for another hour or so.” Andromeda asked kindly.
"I just want you to slow down. If you eat to fast when your stomach is not use to the amount of foot, you'll up-chuck breakfast and we'll be back to square one." Nik advised.
I am writing this letter on the behalf of the accused, Draco Lucius Malfoy and Narcissa Malfoy née Black. I do not presume to know everything there is to know about the two, but I do know that they do not deserve a sentence in Azkaban. Let me present my case and hope the jury and Wizengamot can come to the same decision as I. No one knows the inner most thinking of Voldemort as I, because the famous scar on my forehead is a Cursed Scar that linked our minds. I could see into the mind of Voldemort and experience every feeling as he did.The Daily Prophet always posted articles about my alleged "fits" where in actuality, I unconsciously slipping into his mind when his emotions were at its height, when Voldemort was either torturing or killing people. The darkest wizard of our time is gone.  As the Dark Mark on the forearms of his followers fades with time, so too will my scar fade, and let his memory fade from our minds for good.
Until then, stay at home. Every time you go out, that timer starts again and you put yourself and loved ones at risk.
"Yes, Trout. On the count I catch 'em and eat 'em. Some fok' come to me to trade for a fresh meal."
Hari was not yet aware of his audience as he relieved his bladder first thing in the morning. He didn't bother with his glasses first thing, and was still a bit drowsy and disoriented perhaps because of it and a bit sleepy yet. It wasn't until he was washing his hands that he opened his eyes after letting out an enormous yawn, that he saw his blurry reflection through fogged up mirror and noticed the warmth from steamy air.  His eyes went wide. Reflected in the foggy mirror behind him, over a waist high divide that separated the bathing area from the toilet and sink, was the blurry outline of tense muscular shoulders and platinum blond hair of Draco Malfoy. Startled he cursed, apologizing profoundly and hastily turned off the water, using the hand towel next to him to dry wet and still slightly soapy hands.
Narcissa and Draco waited in tense silence for the creak of Hari’s door closing before visibly relaxing.
Hesitating only for a moment, Harry reached up to feel Draco's smooth but strong grasp take hold of him and haul him to his feet seamlessly. But he didn't let go right away. Harry tilted his head to the side in question, "Well, where's my welcome?" He said with a teasing white toothed smile.
"I'm ten." Harry said indignantly. Nik's heart sank. He would have guest younger, but didn't want to offend the kid, and thought the kid would have been proud if he aged it up a bit. But no, the kid wasn't lying. He was ten and that meant he was heavily malnutritioned if he looked so small and young for his age.  Then he couldn't allow the kid to go back to that abusive house.
And cut through all this red tape
But he didn’t remember the incident as it played out in his mind now. Before that very moment all he could remember was the point up to that first bite, being thrown in his cupboard, and waking up in the hospital three days later on Monday night. Why had Dumbledore used
"It's big... magnificent. " Draco says remembering the castle in its glory. "It's peaceful. It overlooks a lake. When the water is calm the surface is so smooth it looks like black glass. There's a boathouse. The area's surrounding is heavily forested, but students are forbidden from going inside. There is a small Scottish village about 5 kilometers out we can visit with our guardians permission after second year."
With that thought in mind, Hari smiled to himself and turned his head to kiss one hollow of Draco’s high cheekbones, before offering his lips to Draco’s sensual kisses.
Draco took too long to respond and Hari’s words rushed to fill the silence, “I was actually coming to you for advice.” Hari looked at Draco from beneath his lashes. “Maybe you could help?”
"I invited him." Draco says as he turns back to Blaise.
When the moon began to approach its place above their heads at the zenith point, Andromeda as conductor, once more instructed them to resume their places in the circle. The gold lines of the magical circle hummed and rose to waist level. The color changed to white, and Andromeda said it was time.
“I know that
With a bruising and sharp nailed grip, she marched Harry to his broom cupboard where Harry slept for a room. She ignored the small voice proclaiming his innocence.
"Oh, master Draco! yours poor hands"
Draco moved immediately to his wardrobe, a handsome dark wood affair with stained glass in the doors. The enchanted dragon moved as he approached; the glass illuminated by unseen light to reveal a crescent moon in a starlit blue sky. Emerald green and pale rose wrapped in vines around the white and lavender dragon. It wasn’t an Opal-Eye, but it would do.
It is fatal to those under 1 year of age, those with a previous health condition, those with weakened immune system from a recent illness, those over 65 years old.
What will Hogwarts Staff do when they discover Harry Potter is missing? And one more.
“He’s going on three months.” Hari said promptly.
Draco still grimaced. That implied she hadn’t been. He knew underage sex did happen. Starting third year all the witches had to take mandatory birth control potions. He still didn’t need to hear about his mother’s sex life.
, your mum, and Andromeda's sort of like my godmother now."
Front and center, Hari looked like a winter breeze could knock him over. Draco frowned. Where was his Gryffindor confidence?  He vaguely heard the voices of his group as he focused on Hari.
, and mirrored on his left eye, its twin, the eye of Horus.  Emphasizing the look, his upper and lower lids was colored green and gold. His usual golden tanned completion blemish free, with rosy cheeks and cherry red lips.
He didn’t have wet dreams often and became awfully flustered as to what to do with his morning wood. The fear of being caught jacking off at the Dursley’s still sent a cold sweat down his spine.
"That's Terry. She's barely 20," Emmet returned with drinks and appetizers. "And is currently doing hormones therapy to keep her testosterone levels low. She hasn't been coming lately. I think they make her sick while her body is adjusting."
“Let’s not fight you two. Bill, this is his home. He has every right to be here.” Hari had to defuse this situation fast. He loved his surrogate family with the Weasley’s, but they all despised the Malfoy’s. They wouldn’t understand hearing it from Bill first. His girlfriend Ginny had a very similar temper to her brother and his best mate, Ron and both of them hated Draco Malfoy. They would be furious to find out that Hari is living with him. This is why he hadn’t told them yet. If Bill stormed off before Hari could tell his side of the story, and went straight to his family, he might lose the entire family forever.
"No, I...I just want to know everything about you...because I love you!" Draco blurted out without thinking. A fraction of a second later, Hari watched as all the color drained from Draco's face, and his eyes pop wide with fright. Hari felt his own jaw drop in astonishment.
The most eventful part of the day was the reptile exhibition Dudley had been looking forward to seeing the dangerous and venomous snakes of the world, such as the King Cobra, which wasn't a cobra at all or a Black Mamba which was not actually black but a ghostly gray with a green sheen and a pitch black mouth, or even the giant python. Behind glass. Harry bet that if any of these  reptiles raised in captivity were to escape Dudley would surely wet himself. He had to hide a snigger behind a cough.
Harry opened his mouth in denial, when the doorbell rang. Literally,
Hari thought as he followed Draco to his bedroom door.
Draco's laugh was strangled, "Sweet Salazar, that poor child!"
"Its good to see you, too Cho. What have you been up to?" Hari says as he returns the embrace.
"Because it’s fun! Who says women get to have all the fun of putting on make-up, a sexy number or two, and experiencing the agony of a night out at the club in high heels? Getting glossed up, singing, dancing in drag its all entertainment. But..."Sheryl sobered a bit. "Cross-dressing is not something to joke about. For some it’s a way of gender expression. For myself, a transgender woman, I was born a man but always felt I didn't belong in my own body and felt more in tune with my femininity." A sharp tooth grin speed across Sheryl's lips. "How I dress has nothing to do with my sexuality. Because I identify as a woman and am attracted to both men and women, I am a bisexual trans woman. You feel me?"
"I'm counting it." Draco sing-songed. "We camped under the stars, too." Draco hummed in satisfaction when Hari only growled.
***SMUT/WARNING/RAPE/NON-CON***
"Come on, that’s a pagan holiday, right?" C'iemone called out. "You have an alter you say some prayers under the sun and the moon."
Sheryl, Alice, and C'iemone snuck up on him in the crowd. He was pushed and shoved closer to the stage.
“I took you shopping.” Hari insisted.
"Yes, Potter, fine!" Draco slipped up using Hari's last name with old habits hard to break. "It's not like you haven't heard my mother use a pet name on me."
Hari gave a week chuckle of his own. "So, what do I do, Sirius?"
Turn the half-giant into the authorities? Tell Dumbledore? No Harry might get into trouble.
Harry was still struggling with the concept of him being a Black, 'does that mean I have to change my name, would my parents be disappointed if I no longer went by Potter? And what does she mean by my full name, as if Harry James Potter, as he knew himself to be, wasn't his real name?'
“Hari?” Draco asked quietly almost shyly.
The policeman took a hesitant step back, one hand raised, and the other hovered over his gun. "No, Mr. Dursley. I know your upset. But you must see how grave it is to let a dangerous and invasive creature like a Brazilian Boa Constrictor out into the city. Animal control has still not been able to obtain the confused beast, and they will still need to be compensated for their service and time." The policeman tried to reason.
Back in the garden, Hari was sitting motionless.
“Oh!” Hari said, coloring a bit. “Well, this is loads better than that. Are you planning to make a career out of it?
"That does sound like my mother." Draco mused. And so recognizing a losing battle when he saw one, he made a tactical retreat to treat his injured ear. Rubbing his abused ear, he sat down the letter to take a sip of his forgotten tea, grimacing at the now cold liquid. “Kokoa! More tea, please.” He called to the house-elf, taking over Hari’s work at the stove.
“Do you, Hari James Potter, so swear to uphold the honour and responsibility bestowed in you by heading two of the Most Ancient and Noble Houses, the House of Black and the House of Potter?”
She paused before heading back into the kitchen before walking away with a tight throat and pinched lips. She had her son to take care of and a meal to prepare for her husband before he got home from work.
Draco heart dropped and he wanted to scream out. D
And because, thinking rational for once, he wouldn't want that, and he really did want to spend more time with Hari outside his rut-infested mind, that is.
When the Dursleys returned that night, Dudley was passed out on his father's shoulder. The husband and wife stood in the foreir, stunned speechless.
“Kreacher…” Harry whined, “Do you hate me? Hic! Do you think I’m a poor master? …Kreacher? Why is that your name anyway? It’s ...hic...cruel!” Harry Potter appeared to be a whiny, clinging drunk, who knew?
"Winston, thank goodness. This boy hear was trying to harass us. He has a camera and was taking pictures." Draco honest to God simpered.
"Malfoy, Draco Malfoy I am Andromeda's only nephew from her younger sister, Narcissa."
"You told her about me? Why?" It was Hari's turn to reel back. Hardly anyone knew about his abusive upbringing.
Koako spoke up first as Kreacher was still disorientated after banging his head so many times. “Mistress Malfoy-Black wants to have breakfast on the terrace patio.”
The first thing he'd do is unlock the cupboard so he could sneak into the kitchen for a small snack that would probably be missed by his pig of a cousin Dudley, but not by his aunt or uncle.
"Ah...ah...er...Star Grass! Mother used Star Grass Salve." Draco stuttered out.
"You do far more than your job requires of you, because your a good man." Nik says as he places a steaming cup of tea in front of the officer in uniform. "The kid ate it, but I guess I can sacavange up some more. I'd be a piss poor baker if I didn't have extras or two." He laughed. He placed a white bag with the bakery's logo on it on the countertop, and he offered a kiss to the officer who accepted both with a sweet smile in his bright blue eyes beneath copper brows.
"You hungry? Come on it." The man insisted gruphy. The offer too tempting to resist, Harry moved warily inside. The tawny hair man shut the door again with a gentle click and he closed the curtains. The
Draco rattled Hari's shoulders, making his head bob back and forth. "Love, stop it. Blaise was never on the Dark Lord's side. The Dark Lord would have never allowed he or his mother in, because of their creatures' blood. His mother is a succubus. He may be an Incubus, the male equivalent. I'm not worried."
“That is a long journey. What does she have to say?” Draco asked.
“Yeah, I thought, you know…with the flirting making us both uncomfortable, it might be better to make it clear we were not interested. You…You don’t mind do you?” Hari stuttered, suddenly conscious of his choice of words.
Harry pulled the plate closer and bit into his third puff pastry this one with raspberry jam instead of egg, cheese and sausage. And munched in contemplation. Pulling another cup of tea this time with sweetener in it, he blew before taking a sip. He was just about to say yes, when a tapping on the window drew his eyes to the door with the closed blinds and closed sign on the door to the bakery.
The next day, Uncle Vernon, Dudley, and Hari, took the tube. It was on this day that Hari went anywhere extensive outside suburbia, of Little Whinging, Surrey. In little Whinging, everyone was essentially the same, same tidy houses, same neat little square lawns. Only behind closed doors would an outsider know something was amiss. Inside the walls of Number 4 Private Drive, you wouldn’t know that there weren’t only three people living there but four. There was no sign of Hari Potter in that household; no smiling pictures of him on the walls, no signs of a fourth set of shoes by the door, no room that belonged just to him. Hari hadn’t any new possessions, everything he owned were just old hand-me-down clothes and broken toys from Dudley, and a broom cupboard with cot to sleep on, or be locked away in when company was over.
The snowy-white marble of Gringotts Wizarding Bank stood towering imposingly over the other shopfronts of the intersection between Diagon Alley and Knockturn Alley. The multistoried building is just a front for the miles of underground rails and high security vaults located beneath the streets of London. The grander the wealth, the larger the vaults, and deeper beneath the ground the vaults go, the higher the security there is. The bank is run by goblins, extremely greedy creatures that would protect their wealth by any means, and have a code that forbids them to speak the secrets of the treasures and protection within. The motto for the bank is
"This is bore-ing!" Dudley proclaimed disappointedly when he didn't get his way. Something that Harry found he did often, if not frequently with his parents.
"Geez Potter, no need to bow to me. I forgive you." That got Hari to snap his head up, eyes flashing emerald green to meet laughing gray ones, and realized that Draco was joking.
They wouldn't want him sneaking food.
“Dot, along with clothes, items of necessity, hygiene and beauty products; I need for you to collect my school supplies, Quidditch gear, and family owls. Grab any documents portraying to the Malfoy estates, the ledgers, and the vaults. Kocoa, any valuables not in the Vaults I need you to transfer them too, as long as they are not dark artifacts. All dark artifacts unidentified by the Aurors leave at the manor.” Draco instructed.
“You lived and are still alive. And Teddy and my aunt are extremely grateful for that.”
Why are the Weasley's so poor?
He wanted to be left alone for a while, which is why when Harry got inside he was going to go to the big fireplace in the parlor on the first floor and close the Floo Network and house wards to all those not related by blood.
"She knew." Andromeda whispered hoarsely.
Like him, Draco was entirely naked, but unlike him; he wasn’t entirely human. Draco was the silver dragon. Scales all over his body glistened from the light of the moon somewhere overhead with a roofless ceiling, and pupils completely disappeared in swirling pools of colours.
A look of confusion passed over Draco's face. He shook his head, then nodded and reached underneath his pillow next to him to pull out a leatherbound book. He offered the book towards Hari, before swiftly moving it over his head beyond Hari’s reach. He giggled.
Hari gave a humorless laugh. “We were not allowed in Order meetings, Andra. Mrs. Weasley forbade it. She insisted we were too young. To keep us out of the grown-ups hair, she had us clearing this place from top to bottom. Well as much of it as possible without the use of magic. You know, underage witches and wizards are not allowed to use magic outside of school.”
Harry didn't know what to say. He walked in the wake of Trout, uncertain as he was being lead to an unknown destination.
Hari’s shoulders drooped defeated.
A deep chuckle. “Well, I like it.” Draco said, stretching his neck down to kiss Hari’s lips. One arm wrapped around Hari’s neck to hold his head in place, the other gripped Hari’s thigh to hitch his leg around his own bare hip and hooked Hari’s foot over his buttocks.
Where we'll plan our escape
"That oaf is my friend, and one of my best friends is Muggle-born." Hari warned. Draco sighed.
"That's my job. Now where's my breakfast?" He asked with a roguish grin.
“I thought my cousin and I made it quite clear that you are not welcome here.” The other witch with bright yellow, not blonde, but yellow hair said.
The beginning of this chapter takes place before the events of chapter 2; however timelines merge in the end.
home.” Bill said referring to both of them. Hari smiled in gratitude.
"Open your eyes Draco. Look at your transformation. Dangerously gorgeous, Draco my darling. Don't you agree?" "Sheryl gushed.
"Your not going to force me into..." Hari stammered.
“Um… what do you want to do first?” Draco only looked at Hari as if he grew two heads.  “Right, maybe window shop a bit?” At Draco’s raised eyebrow, he mumbled something under his breath and then chose a direction at random.  “Come on!” Hari said offering his hand. Draco slid his hand into his, before he had a chance to question if ‘come on’ counted as asking permission. Evidently it did, because Draco’s hand was met with a warm grasp instead of icy fingers. Smiling he allowed Hari to tug him along.

“Yes, he taught me how to fix it up, keep it running, and how to ride. You doubt me. I’ve saved your life twice at the Battle of Hogwarts, and got you out of prison. I think you could trust me not to kill you now, Malfoy.” They only called each other by their last names when they were annoyed with each other.
Where his nose led his lips and tongue followed leaving hot moist trails in their wake.
A looming shadow shifted in his peripheral vision behind Cho that he hadn't noticed before and Hari instantly tensed. Turning to face the bulk, he prepared to pull out his wand. Instead, he dropped his mouth in astoundment. More so than seeing Cho, here in Westminster, the Muggle world and outside the school setting, he saw--his cousin. His cousin he hadn't seen since last summer.
Draco slammed his hand against the door, caging the smaller boy in. Draco pulled out his wand and rolled up his sleeve, revealing the Dark Mark.
Harry looked on in dread for a second, thinking he was not going to be able to climb onto the counter and unlock the padlock without waking the rest of the house up. But then a light dawned in his head. Harry was magic. Surely if he used magic once, he could do so again. The padlocks on the pantry required a key. while the combination lock on the fridge had a dial between zero and ninety-nine, with a three digit combination, and no numbers could repeat that gave Harry 99*98*97= 941,094 possible combinations.
"I am not going to let you beat me, again. Or starve me, or lock me in that cupboard. Or anywhere else for that matter. In fact, I am out! Leaving, gone. You'll never have to see me again after today."
"You broke my glasses--my board!!!" Came a small outraged voice. Draco eyes startled up into narrowed green eyes glaring into his own grey ones. The Muggle boy had pitch black hair, unkept and wild. His significantly more tanned hand fisted into his fine shirt, instantly wrinkling it. He was hauled up by a surprisingly strong grip for a Muggle boy few inches shorter than he. Blood dripped from the messy haired boys nose.
I watch him on the Quidditch pitch. He is a spectacular flyer. Through the rain, and the wind, and the muddy Earth, I've watched him practice. He is diligent, fast, and aggressive against players double his height and weight. The littlest person on the field he is the easiest to spot, and my eyes are always looking towards him.
Looking out once more into the garden, he sighed. This place was nice, from what his mother had told him, the ancestral home of Black had fallen in disarray after his uncle Orion had passed. Hari had made this place a home. He frowned, lost in thought. For the first time, thinking Hari's name didn't send him into instant arousal. That was a good sign. His rut was over, and if it didn't completely ruin any chance at a fledgling friendship, perhaps they could start over.
It wasn’t until Hari was out of the shower that he realized he wasn’t really sleepy.  With a quick
Doxies were fairy-like creatures with black coarse hair all over their bodies, double set of limbs, and an extra row of sharp teeth, with a venomous bite. As for the Bogart, well; no one knew the true form of a Bogart, as it is a shapeshifting creature that takes the form of that which is most feared by the person who encounters it. It’s not like Harry could just call someone to terminate pests like Muggle’s would. Then he heard Hermione’s persistent voice in his head, screaming at him,
Hari put down the letter, a shadow of a smile graced his lips as he gently stroked the russet feathers on her head. The owl reminded him a lot of Hedwig, and he felt a pang in his heart at her abscents. He missed his first friend, dearly.
“Oh, you're back!” Narcissa says, unwittingly mimicking her sister's words. “See here, Dragon, Corbeau; many of this furniture can be salvaged. And look at this fireplace,” Narcissa exclaimed excitedly. “It won’t take much work at all to bring back this floor to its former glory, like the others.
His own eyes mirrored hers, reflecting such emotion and depth of a man, Andromeda knew, stricken with grief and crippled by guilt. And suddenly she realized, Harry Potter was just a boy, not yet eighteen, uppressented and had the weight of the wizarding world on his shoulders. For his entire life. He was shackled to this life, no options, no way out. Now that the war was over, he was lost. He lost everything to this war, his family, and any sense of normalcy taken and stripped from his grasp. Famous before he could even talk, and put on a pedestal and revered by all. And his eyes reflected a soul aged beyond his years, tortured by unknown ghosts and nightmares. This boy beat all odds, survived, and now feels guilty for those who did not survive.
Draco gave a long exhale, before nosing up his neck. The sensation of each breath on his skin both seductive and ticklish.
“Wh...ah...what?” Draco said, caught off guard by Hari’s remark. He wasn’t aware that Hari knew he was into magical art, at all. His father never even knew.
Letting out a relieved laugh when his candle flickers to life, he moves to the center of the circle. Setting the candle in its proper west facing position, he cupped a handful of water, taking a sip before letting the water stream through his fingers and into the cauldron to join Narcissa’s sage incense.
Humming and skipping about, Kreacher busidly prepares a quick breakfast, consisting of a warm cuppa and hot buttered scones.

Hari could never hope to achieve that level of attractiveness that came from confidence. Or did the confidence come from the knowledge that he was attractive. Oh, Draco certainly was conceited enough to think that way.
He concentrated on the ladder, hoping his magic would do what he wanted on purpose and not accident. Just as the man on a rampage reached for him through the gaps, the ladder came down with a shuddering zing sound, knocking the man back a step. Harry wasted no time in jumping to grab the lower bar a foot over his head and clammering up the ladder, while the man was cursing at his injured arm.
Severus Snape swept into the bathroom, pushing Potter out of the way. Draco wanted to say, ‘stop! It wasn’t his fault. I raped him. He was only…only…Potter…Harry, I’m sorry. I only wanted to be your friend, why? Why? It’s not fair professor, don’t you see Harry? Why can’t anybody see him suffering? Why does he continue to suffer by my own hands. Help him! He deserves saving, not I. ’
A little girl with auburn hair and curious blue eyes escaped the grasp of her papa and ran to the alley entrance. “Mary? Mary? Come back.” The desperate cry of one of the men with her called after her. She stood confused when she didn’t see the black motorbike tucked away.
Hari flushed and chuckled embarrassed and amused. Draco was like a child when drunk. "Night, Dray. Put some pants on why don't you"
Hari couldn't help but notice, it looked like rain.
Hari took the moment to collect his thoughts. "Hermione can be...stubborn."
Draco was seriously wondering if these ladies weren't already in the cups as is.
