Suddenly there’s a foot making its way up Draco’s leg. Harry is too far away, and he doubts Dean Thomas would go for either him or his neighbours. Which leaves…
"C'est vrai." Draco stands up and takes a few unsteady steps. The ground is moving slightly, making it hard for him to know where it’d be safe to walk. He reaches the end of the table when Harry grabs his arm.
Draco wraps an arm around Potter to hold him in place as he begins to move his hips. Their cocks begin to slide against one another, occasionally brushing against the hem of Draco’s shirt. The fabric provides some lovely friction, but it isn’t enough. Potter’s kisses grow desperate as his hands grip Draco’s hips, moaning into his mouth every time their cocks touch. He runs his hands over every inch of Draco’s body, then slips a hand between them to try and touch their cocks.
Harry mumbled things into Draco’s hair, words he wouldn’t remember later, as the stage went dark around them.
He kisses Harry’s left nipple while his right hand plays with the other one. Harry’s nipples are his sensitive spot, and he arches his back, moaning in unrestrained pleasure.
Draco stands outside the library for a moment, before he turns the handle and pushes the heavy double doors open. What he
In an almost completely dark room, Draco registers a warm body curled up behind him and soft huffs of breath tickling the back of his neck, causing his hair to stand up. A warm palm rests on his stomach, directly on his skin thanks to the borrowed shirt that has ridden up.
However, disagreeing with Neville would mean confessing the real reason for his behaviour, and quite honestly he’d rather take his Healer exams again. All thirteen of them. So instead, he inquires about the shop, about Luna and Augusta, and they also talk about the next few days. Neville tells him that Luna will be joining them later.
“Nico, you can’t just let her–” Charlie began, pulling his wand out, but Nico tightened his grip on Charlie’s other arm and cut him off.
“Ah, little flower, it has been too long!” Nico crooned, his Greek accent as thick as his English was flawless. Lily pulled away with a rather sheepish smile in return.
“Draco,” you break through the arguments, through the water, and your voice is soft. Your smile is so sad. I wonder if you can see the heartbreak on my face or if I’ve managed to keep my expression as cool as I used to.
“I think we’ll leave them on,” Harry said softly and then turned his head slightly to press a kiss to the inside of Malfoy’s ankle just above the strap. The skin was softer than he had imagined it to be. Malfoy’s face flushed pink, his mouth dropping open as he gazed up wantonly at Harry and the dark-haired man just smiled.
“Malfoy sent Harry an invitation to Lily’s wedding,” Ron said nonchalantly as he dropped onto the couch beside his wife. He set the wine bottle onto the table and then leaned back, wrapping his arm around her shoulders. Even as Hermione looked at Harry with something akin to worry, she settled right into Ron’s side and the sight made Harry’s stomach drop.
Five years ago, Lily’s desire to see her friends happy together may have been a little Hufflepuff, but the way she had gotten Teddy and Vic together – first by talking up the Yule Ball, then by somehow convincing everyone but Teddy to be conveniently unable to ask Vic to be their date, and then by making sure Vic looked like an actual goddess and ensuring Teddy got her specific flowers that conveyed he was ready to worship her – was definitely Slytherin. By virtue of growing up as Lily’s cousin and being involved with Draco after the man and his mother rekindled a relationship with Andromeda, Teddy felt like he had gotten to know Theo pretty well over the years.
Lily met Alex in the middle just as he was climbing down from his friend’s shoulders. His friend grunted in irritation and mild pain, but Alex just threw him an apologetic smile and turned back to his fiancé. Alex was tall, slim, and brown. His hair was dark and almost as curly as Lily’s, though he kept his much shorter than hers. His eyes were a warm brown and his gaze was almost always focused entirely on her every time she was in the same room. Lily reached for him and wrapped her arms around his neck, pulling him close to kiss. He smiled against her lips, his arms wrapping snuggly around her waist.
“Well, I reckon he probably feels as though he didn’t,” a voice interrupted them and the table turned to look up at the easy smile of Charlie Weasley. Lily scooted in closer to Vic, but the redhead dropped two full plates to the table and pulled up a chair instead.
I’ve never loved anyone as much as I love you, will never love anyone the way that I love you again. I knew that even when I sat you down and said I had to go. You cried and you screamed and you threw things. Your magic sparked around us, a living angry thing that threatened to consume me. I was ready to let it.
“Freeze him?” Daphne asked, torn between confusion at the situation and amazement at the scene in front of her. With one last scratch of Geronimo’s head, Lily stood up and stepped back, looking at her godmother.
“It’s not uncommon in young Skrill. The males can be pretty territorial. Nico wrote to me and asked if we could take Geronimo. It’s not safe for him here anymore and they want to focus on breeding Gina and Ladon if they can. Increase the population. We have room for him in Romania. I told Nico I was going to be nearby anyways; said I could stop by and take him with me when I go. They should have the enclosure ready by the time we get there.”
he did not learn from her – pulled his attention away from his growing family. Lily was being quite forcibly dragged in the direction of the boat by her much smaller charge. When Greg followed his son’s line of sight, it was to see a tall, lithe figure gracefully approaching them with the slightest of smirks on his face.
“Yes. Well, this one had been in Romania for almost eighty years. She was old. But she was my first dragon. I got attached. When she died, I was…I was devastated. Getting over her was the hardest thing I ever had to do.”
“Ginny?” Lavender nodded this time, smiling a little at the confusion in his voice. “We’re divorced.”
I want to tell you that I love you. I want to take it all back. I want to beg you to come home with me, to stay, to pretend like this never happened. But I remember how you looked last week, standing with him, and I don’t say any of those things. Because you stopped looking at me that way before we even got married, to be perfectly honest. And I can’t go back to the anger and the resentment and pretending like it’s all ok, like this is all love really is.
“Yes, alright, what can Auntie Pansy do for you?” she drawled. Teddy smiled, rubbing at the back of his neck in clear nervousness. Now that she thought about it, Pansy wasn’t sure she’d ever spent time alone with the boy. He was almost always accompanied by a blonde.
“But, uh, no, Percy won’t be there,” Charlie thankfully changed the subject. “Bill and Fleur will be though.”
Teddy laughed and pulled his cousin into a hug, ruffling her hair as his curled to match. The pair leaned back after and looked quietly up at the stars. Lily was the first in the Black family line in generations to not be named after a constellation. When she was six, her and Teddy had made one up. The flower looked down at them now and Teddy smiled into the comfortable silence.
, her friend had somehow been absolutely pants at the subject. Lily had laughed, said she’d been too busy enjoying the last vestiges of her youth to listen to a word on the theory her dad was always spouting off at her. Vic spent the next seven years extensively tutoring Lily so that she could pass her Potions NEWT. Through all their years at Hogwarts, Vic had watched Lily struggle with her ability to focus on subjects she couldn’t get by with just a little hands-on experience. She watched Lily retain information better when she jumped between subjects while studying rather than spending hours on a single topic. She watched as Lily doodled to keep her hands busy so she could process the information the professors were telling them. She listened to every excuse Lily had as to why she couldn’t do that assignment until the night before it was due, lest she squirm and complain until Vic shooed her from the library. As much as Vic would love to find out that Lily was a Weasley, there was only one person Vic knew that learned and processed information in almost exactly the same way. And when her friend turned those trademark, open, green eyes on her, gazing at her curiously above her glass of juice, Vic was absolutely positive she knew who Lily’s other father was.
“What are you reading?” he called out. Draco started, sitting up before he suddenly remembered the boy tucked into him. The book fell to the floor with an echoing tumble in the spacious room and Draco wound his arms around the boy to keep him from meeting the same fate.
“I didn’t either.” Lily chewed on her bottom lip, and Vic knew that look well. It was the expression Lily always wore as she tossed an idea around in her mind, usually before sharing some harebrained scheme or wild dream. That look Vic knew she got from her dad. But just as Lily opened her mouth to speak, a shadow fell over their table and the girls looked up into the nervous grin of Vic’s vote for Lily’s other father.
“Yeah, but you didn’t start fucking him now, did you?” Harry started choking on his beer and Charlie looked at him a little too knowingly.
“Well, I was talking with Lily about what I can do to get Vic back. She has this idea, and, well…I need you to teach me how to dance.” This time, Pansy’s laugh came naturally. It was long and loud and the redder Teddy turned the harder she continued to laugh. Teddy finally whined, “I’m serious!”
He began to press open mouthed kisses to Malfoy’s neck, tugging at the t-shirt Malfoy wore and pausing in his ministrations only to pull it off the blonde. Then Harry pressed their bare chests together and they both groaned at the feeling. Malfoy wrapped his arms around Harry’s shoulders again, pulling him back in for a kiss, and Harry obliged until they had to break away for air.
But the words were swallowed by Draco, the blonde’s lips crashing into his once more like the waves drawn to the shore. One stroke, two, three, and then Harry was digging his nails into Draco even harder as his hips stuttered and he came. Draco snarled at the feeling of come splattering over his hand and his own cock and followed with a long, drawn-out groan.
“I like them a lot,” he rushed out. He didn’t know if it was the spirit of the game, as the others had all been surprisingly honest tonight, or the alcohol giving him the courage to speak freely, but the responding blush on Malfoy’s face was worth it.
“I tried that once. It wasn’t worth my time.” Draco looked away just as Harry looked back up. He didn’t want the other man to know he was lying. This man might have fathered Lily; he would never regret that. Even without her, Draco wasn’t sure he could ever regret Harry anyways.
“Yes,” Harry agreed, his hands coming up to clutch Draco’s waist. Draco planted his hands on either side of Harry’s head and leaned in close, his eyes studying the shorter man’s face before landing on his lips.
“I don’t need your money, Pans. We get by just fine, thank you very much. Besides, Lily has this idea for putting us on the why fly interweb.”
According to muggle mythology, the Greek god Dionysus was born and raised on the island of Naxos. However, before the Statue of Secrecy spread across Europe, it was originally said that Dionysus was born on Kalokairi at the end of August. Though celebrations of the god throughout the world vary by location, inhabitants of the magical island still celebrate the month of his birth through to the middle of September. The island itself, almost as though it is celebrating along with its people, is said to be at its most magically fertile during this time. Male pregnancies aren’t unheard of in the magical world, though they are exceedingly rare without the aid of potions and spells. But in Kalokairi, during the Feast Month of Dionysus, they’re almost expected.
. Harry grinned at him, his smile growing wider as Draco’s cheeks began to warm. “They were real cute together.”
Lily found Theo by the stage. He had managed to get out of the dancers and away from them ever so slightly. He was looking at the stage, new since he had last set foot here, and examining the hand-carved details he knew Draco had always been so enticed by.
“What the fuck?” Malfoy spat, his gaze hardening as he looked down at Harry between his thighs. But Harry just grinned and pulled himself up Malfoy’s body to capture the blonde’s lips with his.
“DoyouhaveanyexperienceinDNAtesting?” Lily managed quickly, her face turning a darker shade of green that indicated she was flushing red on her side of the fire. Luna pretended to take a minute to ponder just what Lily might be really asking.
I tear my gaze away and address your lawyer instead. If I keep looking at you, I’ll back down. I’ll drag this out and neither of us want that. You should be getting on with your life, should be getting on with him. I won’t be the one to hold you back anymore. I can’t be.
Slytherin interrogation. The island’s African gray swooped overhead and Harry could spot which patrons were native islanders based on their response to the singing bird.
“Well, you’ll have to speak to him.” Despite the fact that Draco had kept this from him for twenty years, Charlie couldn’t just break the younger man’s trust. He really hated being such a Gryffindor sometimes.
“Don’t, Ted.” Teddy gaped. She hadn’t shorthanded his name like that in ages. His gaze softened and his grip tightened instead. She was feeling vulnerable and he didn’t want to let her go.
.” Vic ran her hands down her sides, making sure everything was straight, and then squared her shoulders. She glanced back at Teddy with narrowed eyes. “Don’t you dare tell Lily about this. I wouldn’t want to get her hopes up.” Then she looked forward and began striding back to their suite.
She cleared her throat and stared at the gap between Teddy and the wall. He took the hint and stepped more to the side so she could move around him. Just as she was about to leave their own alcove, Teddy reached out and snatched her wrist. She turned back to him with a glare.
“I’m sorry,” Charlie said gently, frowning. Lily just nodded, not sure what else to say. Charlie seemed to be fighting with himself to say something though; Lily waited. Finally, Charlie sighed and dropped his hand away. “I went to the sanctuary in Romania right after I graduated Hogwarts. There was an old Amphiptere there that I was tasked with taking care of.”
Harry never got over that weirdness. Ron hadn’t gone back to school with Harry and Hermione for their eighth year. He had taken up with George in his shop, so he had never quite become as friendly with Malfoy or the other Slytherins as his friends had. Ron had later taken to watching his niece Victoire for Bill on slow weekdays and because of Harry’s relationship with Andromeda after the war, he had ended up taking on Teddy at times too so that Andromeda could run errands or have time to herself. When Andromeda and Narcissa had begun to mend their fences almost a year after Harry had taken his NEWTs, and Malfoy’s daughter had started spending time with the grandmothers, Ron had ultimately ended up taking the little girl as well. After all, she was Teddy’s
“We should get back for Lily,” he told them and they both smirked, moving towards the bedrooms to change their clothes.
“Potter,” Draco breathed in surprise, Harry finally coming to a stop in front of them. He averted his gaze from surprised, curious grey ones in favor of looking at the boy who was shyly gazing back.
The lawyers and the mediator are all speaking at once. But I’ve been drowning since I walked through the doors. They’re speaking from underwater and they’re muffled and all I can make out is you.
Two months into the term and things were going surprisingly well. Harry and Malfoy didn’t talk much, and he actually somehow saw very little of the blonde despite all the classes and the room they shared. It was weird, but not unpleasant. Malfoy was quiet, withdrawn. It bothered Harry a little to not see the fire he was used to stoking in the taller man, but he always reminded himself that it could be worse. They could have punched or hexed each other by now.
Lily was short, much shorter than her father and grandmother and shorter than both of her best friends, though she had the lean Malfoy frame. There were some days where folks would tell her she looked just like her father and other days they were surprised to hear her last name. She was almost as blonde as him, though her hair was more golden in color and was a long, thick, mess of curls, a stark contrast to her father’s thin, easy to style hair. And while everyone in the Malfoy line seemed to have some shade of gray eyes, hers were spectacularly green. She was okay with this because she felt it made her and Victoire look almost like sisters. The taller, curvier girl had the same shade of golden blonde - a magical combination she said she had gotten from her mother’s white blonde hair and father’s red. Victoire’s eyes were a brilliant sea blue, not quite the same green, but the matching brightness coupled with the endless freckles speckling their faces always convinced strangers they could be sisters. Her father used to change the subject whenever she brought it up. Looking down at the box in her arms, she thought she might know why.
“I’m just here for my book,” Harry said quickly. He snatched the potions book up off his desk where he had left it and then immediately spun around, practically running from the room.
Harry traced the underside of Malfoy’s prick with his tongue as he pulled his head back up, and just before the length popped out of his mouth completely, he hollowed his cheeks and dropped his head back down. Malfoy tangled his hands in Harry’s hair, and Harry let him guide the pace as he licked and sucked. He pulled his mouth off only for a moment to murmur a lubrication spell and then he was swallowing Malfoy back down as he gently traced Malfoy’s entrance with a slicked-up finger.
Draco slept on his couch for the rest of the summer. Greg should have known better; he knew when he was eight, he was stuck with the dramatic ponce for the rest of his life.
Harry realized he had forgotten his potions book and decided to detour from back to his dorm to pick it up before he went to lunch. The eighth-year common room was empty and his stomach was grumbling, so with nothing to distract him, he took the stairs two at a time to the second floor.
“What are you doing here, Potter?” Greg’s voice was low, rough. He was speaking straightforward with no room for nonsense. Harry was starting to think he liked this man as an adult. He grinned.
“Hey!” Harry protested, but he couldn’t stop the laugh. This is what his friends were for. They were always honest, even if it was for their own benefit, even if it did really suck to hear.
“No, never. I’ve never even seen a dragon outside of the ones from that tournament fourth year, and only from a distance.”
Harry let his gaze travel slowly up Malfoy’s body, over his long legs and sharp hips, over his flat abdomen and lean chest and sharp shoulders. His eyes paused briefly over the faded Dark Mark, but he had grown quite used to seeing it over last semester and he quickly drew his eyes away to dance along Malfoy’s pronounced collar bone and his long pale neck before meeting the blonde’s darkening gaze.
Daphne stepped forward and wrapped an arm around Lily’s shoulder, smiling over her head at Charlie. He smiled back.
You meet me at the lifts. I would have taken the stairs to avoid this, but my legs are too weak. Everything hurts. I’m grieving. I’m fucking grieving for you when you’re right fucking next to me. I wonder if you’re grieving for me too.
Confident someone of age would look after Vince, Greg turned to greet the men unloading his kitchen’s food. The cool sea breeze blew over him as he mechanically worked through the order, taking quick inventory and delivering quick instructions before sloppily scribbling his name at the bottom of the page.
“I need one item of his that contains his magical signature – so a charmed bag or a transfigured stool. Something he’s put his wand to. Then I need the same from you and from your dad. By subtracting what your dad’s magic adds to yours, I can determine if the rest is made up by him.”
“I don’t know.” Charlie didn’t know why he was playing dumb, but he was still trying to wrap his mind around it. This was
Teddy dropped the box. Lily managed to stop its fall with a levitation charm at the last minute. One of the photographs floated out of the box and drifted to the floor, but no one seemed to notice. Teddy was too busy staring with his mouth wide open and Victoire was looking down at the vials as though she could see into the memories without a pensieve. Her lips were pursed in thought and Lily knew if she gave her friend a minute the girl would piece it together.
Harry had gotten over that weirdness years ago. Victoire had spent a little bit of time with the Malfoy girl when they were younger, but the pair had bonded quickly being in the same year at Hogwarts. Even if they had been in separate houses.
with the man, but there wasn’t really anything right about him either. That was the problem. Nott never felt strongly about anything or even took a stance on something. Greg might have been dead wrong about all his beliefs before the war, but at least he hadn’t been just vague enough about the whole thing to survive no matter who won. It somehow felt worse at times. He had actual things to repent for and mistakes he could never make up for, would always be marked for. But people like Nott would go on, their inaction unnoticed forever, even if their silence made them just as complicit in the face of oppression.
“Why? You’re Uncle Theo.” Greg turned away to survey the movement as Nott came to a stop beside him.
“I didn’t know you were friends with Draco,” Harry mused aloud. When he glanced up at his ginger friend, the man was focused entirely on the sea before them, but a wide grin split his face in two.
Harry kissed back hard, tongues and teeth clashing almost painfully but he didn’t care. He was just trying to consume Draco, to pour twenty years' worth of anguish and loss and resentment into that kiss. And Draco drank all of it.
“I think so. He’s nearly finished the prep-work. Between the wedding and the regular guests, he’s never been more frazzled but I’m managing it.”
“Merlin, Harry, yes,” Malfoy moaned against his lips. “Please, Harry, more. Don’t stop. Harry. Harry.
When Draco was six months pregnant, he finally told Theo. He hadn’t wanted to say anything even then, but it was getting harder and harder for Adrianne to keep the news to herself when most of her life was being impacted by it. Theo had been shocked speechless, but he still seemed to have done the math in his head because his first words out of the fire were, “Is she mine?”
“You can have all of it,” I say and your eyes widen. Your gorgeous, glowing, green eyes. The eyes I swore could always see right through me.
Lily began to gasp for breath, to reach for the bar to keep herself standing. The edges of her vision began to darken and the music seemed to be fading faster than it actually was. A few people nearby seemed to notice something was happening because suddenly a couple of her friends were approaching with looks of concern.
Harry laughed, pushing himself to his feet and dusting himself off. When he looked up, Draco was leaning against the doorway with his arms crossed and an almost fond smile on his face. It lasted only a moment before Draco remembered who they were and where they were. Then the blonde straightened up, pushed Harry back another step, and stepped out into the hallway. The door fell closed and then they were standing in the empty hallway alone.
Lily and Vince absolutely loved Nott, their Uncle Theo. Even Lavender found him charming. So Greg forced himself to relax and reminded himself to square off only a little bit when he strode forward to make sure the coward wouldn’t rub off on his son. Vince wasn’t going to be like Nott or even like his dad, if Greg could help it. Vince was his brave, beautiful mother and Greg would ensure the boy was nothing less.
Malfoy was wearing a pair of extremely tight black jeans and a snug, thin, pale pink long-sleeved shirt with V-neck that would normally button closed but had been left loosely open to reveal an expanse of smooth, pale collar. Malfoy was just pulling on a faux fur cloak that completed the ensemble.
“Yes, well, he’s always been stupidly observant,” Pansy drawled, glaring at Daphne a little. Draco couldn’t help but laugh at the absurdity of it.
“Please, Harry,” Malfoy moaned, and Harry hummed against the blonde’s length, which only made him moan again and arch his hips. Harry took the opportunity to push a finger into Malfoy, and then another, curling them up into Malfoy’s body. Malfoy rocked himself on Harry’s fingers and Harry knew he had found the blonde’s prostate when the man let out a loud, low moan and tangled his fingers tightly in Harry’s hair.
You don’t speak. You don’t look at me. You step onto the lift beside me and we ride together like total strangers. When we pass the twenty-second floor you reach out and take my hand.
“Er, yeah. I thought you said he talked about me?” Harry raised both brows at her. Lily flushed a little and cleared her throat, sipping at her juice to collect her bearings. Vic stifled a laugh from beside her.
“You don’t have to do that, ‘Moine, but thank you,” Harry said with a tired smile. He set his empty wine glass down and stood, stretching his long limbs. “Alright, that’s that then. I’ll RSVP in the morning. What’s the worst that could happen?” Ron and Hermione shared another look.
“Oh hello, Lily Luna,” Luna greeted her namesake with a warm smile. “Shouldn’t you be getting ready for a wedding? I never imagined you’d have time for me.”
“I need your help.” Pansy barked out a sharp laugh and closed her eye again. But when still the shadow didn’t leave, she realized the boy was actually serious. With a sigh, she opened both eyes and reached for her sunglasses, sliding them on with another dramatic sigh.
“I did not come here to discuss the patients, Luna,” Hermione interrupted harshly. Luna winced and looked down. She wasn’t quite ready to face the music. “I thought you were Harry’s friend.”
“Err, truth,” Harry managed to say, taking a large sip of the rum and soda to parch his suddenly extremely dry mouth. Parvati grinned at him.
Harry slowly kissed his way down Malfoy’s neck again, licking and sucking and kissing down over his chest and tracing the long thin scars from sixth year with his tongue and not a word. Malfoy gasped and arched up into him, tangling his hands in Harry’s hair as he mouthed his way farther down over the blonde’s abdomen. Harry tugged on Malfoy’s shorts, pulling his pants down with them, and quickly discarded them with their shirts.
“You must have; I saw the invitation.” Draco tried to recall the guest list, but it was difficult to remember every one of the two hundred and seventy-four envelopes he and Lily had painstakingly addressed by hand. Figures his kid would want such a large wedding. With another groan, he dropped his face back into the pillow and vowed to smother himself right then.
The tears began to flow more heavily now, Harry sobbed and drew his knees to his chest and hugged his legs. McGonagal crawled closer to him, and put her arms around him. He stiffened for a moment, before relaxing and leaning into her. Only now did she see the faint bruises covering his skin. Her blood boiled at the thought of that man harming a child as he did. She could only imagine how bad it must have been to cover his skin so completely, for him to have trouble walking days later.
"Can you help me? I can't seem to get up." The injured child asked sheepishly, a faint blush formed on his pallid cheeks.
They laid like that for a while, basking in each other's company. Harry taking comfort in having his one and only friend by his side.
They crept into their hidden alcove, and McGonagal turned as she transformed back into her human form. Crossing her arms, a questioning expression on her face. Her brows were knitted in concern.
Harry woke up the next morning shivering and with an aching belly to accompany his side backside. Luckily, he had something in the way of a blanket in the cloth he had used during his magic show yesterday. Delphi also helped to act as an extra barrier of insulation against the elements, her thick, lengthy body covered the majority of him beneath the cloth.
"Why so worried now? You didn't seem too concerned the last time I approached you about his safety." Her irritation pricked at the edge of her voice.
Papers shuffled as Dumbledore leafed through various documents anxiously. His hands trembled with the stress and smoldering anger he felt burning within his chest. The days following Harry's disappearance hadn't been kind to the old wizard, as he scrambled to maintain his reputation and influence among the chaos.
"Please. Do consider," she said. It took all of her will to keep as much venom out of the words as possible. She turned toward the stairway leading out of the office.
Harry woke suddenly, breathing heavily, nearly gasping for air. He attempted to sit up, but immediately fell back as he was hit with waves of nausea and pain.
Harry ran as if the devil were on his heels, which wasn't too far off, as Dudley could easily be compared to the anti-christ; albeit a very, very fat anti-christ. Running at this speed meant tearing up garden soil and flora alike, which didn't mean much to Harry, considering his health was at stake. That and Dudley's goons were doing far more damage in their uncoordinated and clumsy persuit.
Suddenly his remaining breath was thrust from his lungs as his back impacted the wall of his miniscule living space. The young one crumpled like a sac of bones, and moved no more. His skin was mottled purple and yellow all over is body, a variety of strips of many lengths.
"No, I dont think it will be necessary." Dumbledore, once again, declined her suggestion to remove him from the Dursley household. It was late in the evening, after that days lessons.
"Oh, yes, of course! I have it in the fridge, would you like me to warm it up?" Lupin asked, turning toward his kitchen unit.
Harry knew he didn't have enough time to approach every cell he had on the list. He estimated that he had enough time to kill maybe half of the men on his list, if he were very quick, and didn't take time to admire his handiwork. So he did his best to follow these rules, managing to eliminate slightly more than half of the men due to their proximity to each other. But soon he heard a stampede of footsteps coming from the opposite end of where he entered, a large sect of officers were uncomfortably close. He made a sprint to the where he had first entered. He got close when he saw them, maybe twenty heavily geared men flooded from the far end of the block.
Well, that answer only seemed to inspire a multitude of new questions. But what of his scar? He'd been told differently.
The masked child looked around the room, a few people in suits cowered on the floor. One of them stood out, a man wearing wireframe glasses, his nametag read "Lead Records Associate," along with his name: Bernard. Harry spoke to his serpent.
In the meantime, I'll be doing my best to crank out some more of this fic, and potentially write some other things to try getting my flow going again. But it's probably best to not expect any content for about 2 weeks at the time this is being posted. I would appreciate some feedback on what exists of this fic, whether or not you guys like it. Part of why I'm so down is because I've been feeling pretty unappreciated when it comes to the things I create, whether it be my stories or my artworks.
He fell hard, the ground forced the air from his lungs as his back and skull collided with dirt and sod. Spots danced before Harry's eyes as he struggled to breathe, he coughed and felt flecks of copper dot the back of his tongue while his lungs bled slightly within his ribcage. He finaly managed to pull in a few small, precious breaths before he rolled on his side. He touched the back of his throbbing head and gasped as a wave of pain struck like lightning, he brought his fingers into his sight to find the tips dyed red. He slowly rolled onto his stomach, nausea and pain wracked his frame. With each shallow breath he felt something in his chest shift painfully, unnaturally. As he slowly brought his body off the ground he felt a new blow strike him in his abdomen. New pain exploded in his stomach as air was forced back out of him, he retched, it was almost lucky that today was one of those days where the Dursleys neglected to give him any form of breakfast.
"I don't have toilet paper, unfortunately. It's sadly not really within the budget at this moment." He said, opening the door very slightly and slipping his hand through. He felt the wad of napkins being tugged from his grasp.
“Thank Godric you did,” Harry said with a deep sigh and a faint smile. “It used to be a quiet island, this.”
“I could never stay away, knowing you’re nearby,” he murmured and Lily nearly swooned. She pressed herself closer and rested her head against his chest. Even as the frantic music swirled around them, threatening to swallow them up, Alex guided them in a slow, swaying turn.
The closet door swung open and Draco stumbled out, the bird twisting its way out of his grasp. Benny ruffled his feathers wide and bobbed his head at Draco with a particularly offended squawk before flying over to perch on the towel cart. Draco cleared his throat, straightened his
His grumbling was cut off short by a loud rumble, followed quickly by the ground beginning to shake. A group of cries sounded not far off. Cursing his luck, he ignored every instinct telling him to find cover and broke out into a run. By the time he was sprinting into the hotel's atrium, the shaking and rumbling had stopped. But a small group of locals were stood in varying stages of fear and agitation, crowding around a new crack that spanned the length of almost the entire floor.
“Good morning,” Harry chirped, running a hand through his already messy hair and shifting from foot to foot.
“I’ve been looking for something meaningful to have as my ‘something old,’” Lily explained. “I thought it might be nice to look through some of Dad’s family’s things.”
“I believe you have a kitchen to prep and a cake to finish.” He nodded, squeezing his wife to him once more. “But perhaps your wife would like to. After all,
Every time I walk away from this building, I still feel like I’m drowning. But maybe I can learn how to swim. I hope that you already are.
“Aunt Dromeda will be here, I think you know her,” Lily said and Harry bit back a laugh. He had practically lived with the woman all during wedding planning. She had been his escape, his sanity, and (what he thought was) covertly his source of information on Draco when she started corresponding with her sister for the first time in almost thirty years. “Vic’s folks are coming today and most of the wedding party and their family.” Here, Lily’s eyes lit up. “And Alex is coming in with his parents today.”
“I heard you really like my heels,” Malfoy drawled, dipping his head so that his lips grazed Harry’s ever so slightly. “What about them is it that you like, Potter?”
And they were new, Harry could tell. On top of Malfoy’s desk was a box Harry recognized as the one that had been delivered to Malfoy that morning at breakfast. It had been slightly enlarged and it was open, tissue paper spilling over the sides. The heels must have come out of the box, though Harry wasn’t sure who had sent them.
Draco had wanted to be honest and tell him that he didn’t think so, but he really didn’t know. He was just so emotional by then and despite the support around him, he had felt alone. But even with the fire distorting his face, Draco could read the terror plain as day. And Theo couldn’t risk his very precarious reputation by being with Draco, let alone fathering his child. So Draco had forced a smile onto his face and said that no, his daughter most assuredly did not belong to his friend. Theo never asked the question or anything like it again.
“When’s the wedding?” Hermione asked, as though she didn’t already know. Harry knew there was nothing Ron knew that he didn’t tell Hermione. There was no doubt in his mind she didn’t know about the floo call Harry had had with Ron earlier that day when he had first received the invitation.
“Yeah, she checked me in,” Harry said easily, but he looked anywhere but at Draco. Draco didn’t think anything of it, just swallowed the lump in his throat and nodded, turning around, and made for the doorway again. “It was really nice seeing you, Draco.”
“What are you up to today, Benny?” Draco asked as he unlocked door number twelve, pushing into the darkened guest room. It was spacious, with a large king bed taking up more than half the room, the rest occupied by a desk, a small fridge with a coffee maker above it, and a sliding glass doorway to its balcony. The hotel had a few suites, but the majority of the rooms looked just like this one, some perhaps with two queen beds in place of the one king. Draco snagged an armful of towels from his cart and headed to the closet outside the bathroom. Benny followed him into the room.
“Oh fuck, Draco,” Harry moaned as Malfoy clenched down around him. And as he wrung the last of Malfoy’s orgasm from the body beneath him, he let his own orgasm take over. He pushed his hips forwards, once, twice, three more times, emptying himself in the man pressed tightly against him.
Harry didn’t know anything about fashion, but he had listened to the Gryffindor girls in his year talk enough to recognize the names of the high-end brands. Hannah’s eyebrows rose at Malfoy’s response and Harry realized that Le Couteau must be one of the top high-end wizarding brands.
“I’m still a little upset I was never considered,” Daphne piped up, dropping into a reclining chair across from them. Draco and Pansy both laughed.
This was the Gryffindor that had signed up for the DA without hesitation, that had stood up in the Final Battle with barely a break in her stride. Now she was a Gryffindor used to fighting for the man she loved and their…child?
Harry pulled out the two bottles of lager and opened them, passing one to Charlie. He sat down on the bench closest to the steering loft, picking slowly at the black label on the bottle.
Well, that wasn’t strictly true. Sometimes he came up in conversation when Andromeda or Teddy came to visit. The last twenty years hadn’t been a completely Potter-free world. He’d heard bits and pieces. He hadn’t been allowed to forget, no matter how much he used to hope for it. But Draco was older now and wiser now and he had more important priorities to focus on.
Charlie Weasley had always been a morning person. Even before work with the dragons had him up by four in the morning, it was simply as though his body didn’t know how to sleep much past six. It used to drive his mother crazy. Now six was “sleeping in” and Charlie liked being up this early. It seemed to be a small percentage of the magical population that agreed, which meant the Hotel Ariadne was quiet and the property was nearly empty. Only the workers seemed to be awake, and even they moved with a tired sluggishness through the halls and across the lawn. Charlie could only think of one other person happily awake and puttering around somewhere.
“Hi, Goy- err, Greg,” Harry stumbled through a greeting. Greg raised a brow at him again and Harry had to wonder if the move was part of why they became Slytherins or if everyone in the house learned it on their first night there.
“Really, they call that girl the brightest witch of her age, and it takes her twenty years to solve this?” Narcissa snorted uncharacteristically and Greg felt Lavender stiffen a little bit at his side.
“The penny’s dropped now, good and proper. That’s why you sent me the invitation. You want your other old dad here to walk you down the aisle. Well, I’m not going to let you down. I’ll be there!”
“I see you’ve broken a feather,” Benny cawed at Draco, fluttering his wings and puffing out his chest.
Except, Harry could not stop thinking about Malfoy’s long, shapely legs and wondering what it might be like to see Malfoy take longer strides in those heels. Or, more embarrassingly, to have Malfoy wrap those legs around his waist and press his heeled feet into Harry’s arse as they– Harry flushed a cherry red and pulled the curtains on his bed closed.
Draco froze in the doorway, his hands just settling on his towel cart. He glanced back into the room at the Gryffindor. Harry stood in the same spot; he hadn’t moved from it even once. He stared back, his green eyes piercing as he raised one hand in a small wave farewell.
liked Ron at one point so she wasn’t exactly without taste. Harry had given most of the other Slytherins a second chance; he supposed he should give Gregory Goyle one too.
“No, Oliver and I were never really that close. Even if we did play together on the quidditch team for a few years, he was always closer to Percy.”
made after you. I wanted to be an Auror and now I run the whole bloody federal department! You knew exactly what my dreams were, and you didn’t even consider them.”
Harry paced back and forth in the empty hallway, not quite sure what he was waiting for. For all he knew, Draco would stay with Lily for the rest of the night. His only options were to knock on the door and force his way in to the love of his life and their daughter – and fuck if that wasn’t a weird thought – or go back to his room and pace there all night long instead. He wondered if this was something that happened to Lily a lot or if Draco was as panicked as he was. And if Draco was panicked, then surely he should be in there comforting the other man, right? Right.
“How have you been?” Harry asked, unsure what else to say. Daphne’s small smile melted into something more genuine and she turned back to Lily.
If Harry didn’t know any better, from this distance the little boy could have been James when he was that age. The idea made Harry’s stomach flutter and his heart twist all at once; that at some point he might have come close to that very idea being a reality made it very hard to push away all those ‘what ifs.’ Harry wondered if Draco would have been like this with James and Albus, if he had been like this with Lily, and felt his heart break. Harry would never regret Ginny– she had given him their boys– but he would always regret leaving Kalokairi when he did. There was nothing for it now, though. All Harry could do was move forward, and he knew the day before that the moment he laid eyes on the blonde for the first time in twenty years that he would do anything to make sure he moved forward with Draco. So pushing Lavender’s arm down and staunchly ignoring her inquisitive stare, Harry began to step forwards.
Nott dropped his bags and dropped to a knee, something Greg had to give the former Slytherin – he only did it for these kids. The dark brunette disappeared behind a swarm of limbs and hair as all the children surged forward to wrap him in their arms. Their voices were muffled as they talked into each other, but when no sudden exclamations from Theo were forthcoming, Greg was sure that Lily wasn’t putting some Mamma Mia plan into action this morning.
“You’ve been to Kalokairi then?” Lily asked and Harry turned to look at the curly blonde. He could feel his heart leap every time he looked at her. The similarities between her and Draco were striking. Especially when she was looking at him like
“Harry! Funny seeing you here,” Lavender beamed, her smile wide as she gathered up the rest of the flowers and shoved them into her basket. Harry stood with her, still staring on in shock as she paid the vendor patiently waiting for them.
“M-my shoes,” Malfoy managed to get out between strokes. Harry grinned and pulled his hand away, his grin growing as Malfoy whimpered at the loss of touch.
“I was being polite,” Draco grumbled, but he was already wheeling the cart off. Lavender laughed behind him.
“Do you even know if he knows about you?” Alex asked, his body tensing. Lily reached up to set her hands on his, twining their fingers as he clutched her shoulders tighter. “I know how important this is; I’ve
“You’re an adult now, Lily. You have the right to know your lineage and seek out your family. If you want to know your roots, then I’ll help you find them. I’m on your side now.”
“You’re mostly your mother’s,” Charlie teased and Vic scoffed, stealing one of Charlie’s croissants in retaliation. Charlie gasped and pretended to be mock offended. Lily laughed and looked across the table at Harry, who was watching her with a very sad smile. She blushed, but met his gaze head on.
The couple in the dark stared wide-eyed at the emptying alcove across from them. Vic had never been more grateful for Teddy’s charms skills in her life. The disillusionment spell he had cast on them had held firm, aided in part by their staying perfectly still in shock (and disgust) at the scene that had unfolded before them. Vic finally released a breath she didn’t realize she was holding and turned to look at Teddy, who was already looking down at her with a (she was sure matching) horrified expression on his face.
Despite his years on the Gryffindor quidditch team and his use of a broom at work, Charlie learned twenty years ago that he wasn’t fond of flying over an ocean so this time, he had gone out of his way to rent a little boat (dubbed
“No,” he said and then fell silent. Something close to relief began to creep into Draco inch by inch, but the longer Harry went on saying nothing the heavier his heart felt.
“Dare,” Malfoy said immediately, when Parkinson had turned towards him. Her responding smile was absolutely feral, and Malfoy flushed a light shade of pink. Harry wondered if he was going to change his mind, but Malfoy just lifted his chin higher.
The warm breeze ruffled his long hair, tousling the strands that had fallen loose from his ponytail, and though he might have once been frustrated with how the weather affected his hair, he had already spent the morning ruining it with sweat-inducing labor, so he really didn’t think twice about the wind. He welcomed it instead, rocking back and forth on his feet as he waited for the boat to come in. It was quick to depart, but it always took its sweet time docking. He knew how unpleasant the rocking could get as the motor turned off and the boat glided just a little awkwardly through the shallow water. He could just imagine his friend squawking loudly through bouts of nausea about how undignified traveling by boat was, how he should have taken her up on her offer to just buy him an island and let her pay to connect it to the international floo.
“You’re right,” he said. “But I’d like to.” Lily’s brows rose in surprise this time. Then her eyes narrowed as she studied his face.
“Oh.” Draco heard Harry sigh, but he couldn’t look at the other man. Not yet. “I came…to make things right, I guess.”
“Oh no way,” he said, grinning wide. “We use your Guérir moisturizer line on the sanctuary to help with healing burns. It prevents a lot of scarring.” Daphne’s cheeks flushed a little deeper and Charlie’s smile grew.
“I haven’t told him, no,” Lily admitted. Victoire just nodded and leant down, dropping the vials into the box and picking it up before shoving the box back at Teddy to take.
“I talked to Theo before I left,” Pansy began delicately, looking down into her very strong drink as she spoke. Draco turned his head to look at her, frowning as he waited for her to go on. “We talked about Lily’s wedding. He’s coming. Isn’t that a little fucked up, even for you?”
“He does,” Lily tried to save. “I guess I just haven’t heard all that much about what he was like then. Auntie Pans and Daph never mention what school used to be like and he won’t let Greg or Lavender say a word. It’s like he didn’t exist until I was born.”
“I’ve no idea what you’re talking about. Either of you,” Draco sniffed, turning to look out the window again.
The restaurant inside the Villa Ariadne was known for its buffet. Locals would come spend meals here. As Vic filled her plate up with breakfast foods, she couldn’t help but wish Uncle Ron were here to see this. With out of country wedding guests starting to fill up the rooms, Draco had outdone himself with the sea of offerings. There were three different styles of eggs, three varieties of pancakes and waffles, four different kinds of meats, twelve different breakfast pastries, potatoes cooked six different ways, fresh hotel made toast and muffins, and fresh squeezed orange juice. Vic was sure her friend was going to have to move in with her after the expenses on this wedding. But one bite into the fresh island fruit and she wasn’t complaining.
“Dear Merlin, I’ve got it!” a voice boomed from beside her again. Lily whirled around, her eyes widening. “Talk about slow on the uptake. I’m your other father!”
to say.” Draco tried to clear the sudden lump from his throat. “The idiot left and we’ve both moved on and that’s that. Now drop it.” Draco abruptly sat up, dropping his feet to the ground so he could properly glare at each of his friends. They exchanged a look he couldn’t quite decipher, but seemed to silently agree to drop it.
“Come,” Nico said, motioning for all of them to move towards the entrance to the cave. “We must be going.”
“I was more afraid they would try to take her away,” Draco muttered against the pillow. “I didn’t want…I couldn’t lose her. I couldn’t.”
“Dammit, Malfoy!” a voice from the distance cried out and Luna bit back her laughter. She did always love these children. And she had a feeling she knew why they were seeking her out. She did still talk to Harry. Very often, in fact. Almost as often as she spoke with Draco.
Theo and Charlie were good companions. They were also the only other men in the place. It seemed the taverna had been taken over by Lily’s bachelorette party and the curly blonde stood several tables away, surrounded by friends. Harry actually recognized many of them from Hogwarts, a few of them girls Teddy had brought home in between his dating Victoire. Harry was surprised Teddy wasn’t allowed in, but the unfamiliar, purple-haired, nonbinary looking person pressed to Lily’s side made Harry briefly wonder if his godson hadn’t found a way in anyways. With a grin, he turned back to his conversation partners.
“James and Al are so jealous that I’m here with you,” Harry told him before pulling back from the hug and pulling Victoire into one. The blonde sighed in annoyance and rolled her eyes at him, but she hugged him back anyways.  “Are your parents here yet, Vic?”
“And?” Teddy finally asked when the pair looked back at her. Lily sighed in frustration. Maybe she understood them just fine and maybe they just knew her as though they had known her almost her entire life (because they had, she reminded herself).
Luna Lovegood’s office was a small, cramped space tucked away on the seventh floor of St. Mungo’s Hospital for Magical Maladies and Injuries. It contained a desk covered in medical files, scattered pieces of parchment that experiment data or new ideas had been scribbled onto, and a variety of eccentric paperweights with a solid oak chair that spun in circles and housed another pile of medical files and well creased books. Behind the desk and on either side of it stood four tall bookshelves that were crammed from floor to ceiling in books, crafts, and indoor plants. A few of the plants had begun to grow across the ceiling and in between the bookshelves, but their owner either didn’t mind or didn’t seem to notice. With Luna, one was never quite sure. Across from the desk was a small stone hearth and a wide, very comfortable, very well-worn armchair covered in a garish yellow and green plaid pattern. Next to it sat a small side table with two empty teacups and one full cup of rapidly cooling tea. The place gave Hermione Granger a small heart attack every time she visited, but Luna always felt quite cozy and right at home in the office she had occupied as an attending for the last eight years.
At this, Draco brightened exponentially and the beautiful, charming boy Charlie had met that one summer was standing in front of him. So it didn’t occur to Charlie to ask why Draco already knew what he was going to ask.
I wanted to be angry. I really did. But what right did I have when I was the one who left? And before my anger could bubble over and explode, it froze with the rest of me. I remembered how tired I was. Of all of it. I just…deflated.
“Maybe for the holidays, you know what the British winters does to my joints,” Marcus grunted and everyone laughed. Draco held the door open and escorted the men in, Theo coming over to greet them.
“Right, well, she says Alexander can create a newspaper for our hotel. She seems to think it’ll drum up business.”
“Well, you have sons, don’t you? Albus and James, right? They’re still at Hogwarts.” Harry looked at her in surprise.
“Dad floo’d him two days after Alex proposed last year. I remember because Uncle Theo congratulated me. He was happy for me, but almost a little sad too. I totally forgot.”
“Is that really what you want to do?” Lily began to fidget with her rings, her face turning a light shade of red and a distant expression sliding over her face.
“Why?” she asked softly, following the rest of them out of the Wrangler. She looked up into the large cave they had parked in front of, the entrance to the Skrill enclosure.
“I told you I was in love with you. I was mortified. You were Harry bloody Potter. You always fought for what you wanted. When weeks turned into months without hearing from you, you made it clear that there was nothing from me that you wanted. What was the point in writing to you then?”
“Harry, Uncle Charlie, this is my friend Lily,” Teddy announced. “Lily, this is my godfather Harry and my uncle Charlie.” The girl stepped forward, large grin on her face, and held her hand out to Harry.
“Patients are allowed to bring someone they are comfortable with to appointments.” Hermione glared at Luna. She couldn’t help it. But the blonde just stared firmly back, her hands folded in front of her on the desk.
“I think you should leave that poor girl alone, Edward. You’ve put her through quite enough,” Pansy sniffed, straightening out and making her way down the beach. Teddy followed along like a puppy, huffing in irritation at the use of his full first name. Pansy smirked.
). When he was really lonely, he could almost pretend he was telling Lily’s other father about the things he missed while she was away. Even if it wasn’t the man he wished he was telling all about her.
“Draco, wait!” Harry called out, running after him. Draco either didn’t hear him or didn’t listen, but as he was suddenly picking up the pace Harry thought it was the latter. “Can’t we talk?”
“I’d love to meet him,” Harry said, and found he genuinely meant it. To be fair, with two sons of his own, they would always be his weakness. “I remember that age. James was much more rambunctious than Al, but that summer before they started primary school was my favorite.”
What the hell are the men doing here?” Draco’s voice echoed into his microphone, suddenly breaking the connection between them. Harry blinked and stood up from the bar, making to move forwards or
Harry bit down on the soft flesh of Malfoy’s calf, just above his ankle, and sucked on the skin until a small, dark mark appeared beneath his lips. Malfoy whimpered, but only bit down harder on his lip. Harry licked and kissed along Malfoy’s ankle, loosening the strap only enough to slip his thumb between the shoe and Malfoy’s foot in order to press it into the middle of Malfoy’s arch. Harry firmly stroked his thumb down over Malfoy’s arch without dislodging the shoe, biting again at his calf, and finally Malfoy released a long, soft moan.
Without hesitation, Ginny tells Harry she’ll pay him back before practically dragging her wife off the table. Pansy waves a quick hand at them on their way out.
Draco didn’t answer him; there was probably no way to phrase what was going through his head into a proper sentence. Or maybe there was nothing going through his head. The emptiness that threatened to consume a person, Harry was very familiar with that feeling. It could also be the not-understanding of how something like that could happen, and you had to live on without them in your life. Harry also knew that all too well, having lost so many people over the years. His parents, his godfather and his husband, some of his friends…
In the middle of him devouring the bowl of noodles, Pansy is done with being patient. “Can we please talk about your boyfriend troubles now? Some people have work in the morning.”
However, it’s the first one since they’d ‘gone public’. They only had to because… well… if there hadn’t been the shagging-incident in Draco’s office and them noticing afterwards that the door hadn’t been locked, he’d have waited longer.
Draco pushes Harry’s knees up to his chest, opening him up wide, and fucks him hard. His balls slap against Harry’s arse with every thrust, and he’s hitting Harry’s prostate with every wet slide of his cock in. Harry arches his back; the entire library fills with his moans. He looks better than Draco could have ever imagined in his wildest dreams. Harry’s eyes are closed, his forehead damp with sweat. Stray strands of hair are clinging to his forehead, to his neck; his mouth open wide in a groan. He chokes out Draco’s name and Draco, shuddering when he hears it, picks up the pace.
“Is this how you treat people who’ve been keeping you company while your boyfriend is running late?” Pansy asks.
Draco throws a deadly glare at Ginny and Pansy, respectively, as he pockets the Muggle thirst trap device. If Potter continues with sending him pictures in similar fashion, Draco will probably bend him over the counter, customers and Mr Ollivander be damned.
“Yeah.” Draco feels Harry’s eyes on him as he returns his attention to his dough, glancing up only to find Harry making his way over to him. “And what do you think you’re doing? Giving the dough a gentle pet? Dig the heels of your hands into it.”
“I can’t believe that the machinery is still good, even after all these years,” Draco says, giving the bookcase a fond stroke. The house seems to appreciate the compliment—the unlit torches set in the scones burst into flame the moment they take a step forward into the passageway, one after the other in rapid succession. The air doesn’t smell as musty as it should be, despite the passageway being shut up for years, although a chill settles over them as they walk down a slope that heads towards the back of the house.
All of them were together in paradise where they belonged. Every single person that had been taken away from them too early. They would be dearly missed, but they would never be forgotten.
The way his name sounds in Potter’s mouth has Draco tugging lightly on Potter’s hair. The way Potter looks right now—on his knees in front of Draco, his lips wet with saliva and precome, his eyes wild with lust—is a feast for the eyes.
When they break apart once more, Draco’s hot all over, and his cheeks are flushed. Potter must see it, because he smiles at Draco before leaning in again, gently licking Draco’s bottom lip. When Draco parts his lips, Potter, to his surprise, slides his tongue in slowly. Draco follows Potter’s lead, and takes his time to explore Potter’s mouth. He tastes traces of the wine they’ve both been drinking, and hints of mint. But he doesn’t have time to focus on that, because Potter breaks off and swings one leg over Draco to straddle him.
“Banish the thought. Carry on, Potter.” Draco says, and leans over to give Potter a quick kiss of reassurance.
Sadly, seeing Harry again is unavoidable, but maybe he’s been able to fix the boiler, allowing Draco to at least go back to Neville’s flat. He just needs to get this over with, and it’s not like it can get any worse. Dry and dressed, Draco exits the bathroom and crosses the room, taking a seat across from Harry at the dining table.
With the sleeve of his jumper, he wipes sweat from his forehead and casts another Patronus. The silvery stream barely hits the plants before it's gone.
A truly unflattering moan escapes Draco’s mouth, and he gets the sinking feeling he’s blushing again.
is my knight in shining armour.  I can always count on you, darling. Thank you so much for all your help on this. <3
“Yep. I’ve already brought the plants from the flat to the shop downstairs and put two small electric heaters in there.” Draco feels a warm, calloused hand on top of his own, a thumb gently stroking over the back of his hand in a far too intimate fashion. “It’s all right. We’ll figure it out," Harry says softly. "Let’s just get to bed.” Draco gets up and walks to the front door because his first instinct is to put as much distance between them as possible. “And where do you think you’re going?” Harry asks, confused. “The flat’s still cold as ice.”
of all places. Draco might admire artworks and jewellery in different body areas, but he’s never been fond of anything spiky. Some would say he’s squeamish about needles.
The loud beeping of an alarm clock rudely pulls Draco from his dreams. It feels like a hoard of Thestrals have trampled over him; his head is throbbing, and muscles ache that he didn’t even know existed.
The music swells, and Potter’s steps quicken. Draco keeps up effortlessly, and his hands slide up Potter’s arms.
“No, I most certainly did not. Anyway, this will be our fifth date, and no Ginny, we haven’t passed that line yet. Potter has been a perfect gentleman.”
Reaching the destination, you force him to put his hands on either side of his head and spread his legs. One after the other, knives of different sizes and shapes are revealed, and then you vanish them.
By the time Draco has told Harry literally everything he can think of, the bottle of lemon vodka is nearing its end. Draco’s never been one for spilling his guts, and he’s not quite sure how or why it happened tonight. He’d briefly considered the possibility that Harry had spiked the booze with Veritaserum, but no matter why it came to happen, he feels relieved. A burden lifted from his shoulders.
Five minutes later, he is still waiting for someone to answer the door. His feet take turns tapping on the stone step, mostly to check that his toes haven’t frozen off yet. Not even his best heating charms are helping him at the moment.
“Am I a joke to you?” Draco says icily, snapping out each word. His heart is hammering in his chest, beating painfully hard against his ribs, but his voice comes out steady and cold. “You’ll make sure I’ll never want to leave? Potter,
"Let's get you more comfortable, darling. It's far too hot in here to be dressed from head to toe in multiple layers."
It’s not that Draco minds coming to Diagon Alley so much — most people just give him a side-eye instead of jinxing him these days — it’s more that he doesn’t want to come
“And why did you come back here, Draco?” Draco’s eyes snap back to Harry’s. He hadn’t even realised he was looking elsewhere. “Neville told me you grew up in England?"
Draco snaps his hips forward, slamming home, and Harry groans loudly, hooks a leg around Draco’s waist, trying to pull him in deeper. “Like this?” Draco asks, panting, and Harry responds, “Merlin,
Upon opening the door to the bakery, Draco can see that Harry is still dressed in a stained apron, cleaning up. It makes sense, otherwise he’d been upstairs, but Draco’s brain doesn’t make the connection until now. Nobody should be allowed to look good in dirty clothes, but somehow, Harry manages.
leaning in, gravitating closer and closer to each other, until a noise from outside snaps Draco out of his trance. He pulls back, staring wide-eyed at Harry for a second before rushing to the bathroom.
Evidently, the confusion is too much, and it would look too gauche to undo the charms, because Draco hears the live musicians begin the dance music.
“Potter’s gay?” he blurts out. His cough afterwards doesn’t help to cover anything up. He’s also not thinking about Potter in his uniform. Absolutely not.
when she’d given her life to save his. He’d promised he’d do it, celebrate her in the only way they knew how.
“Be right back,” Draco whispers against Harry’s lips and makes as if to get up. Then his eyes catch sight of a familiar blue bottle near Harry’s head, reflecting the flames from the fireplace.
The second you lay eyes on him, you understand that coming here to his territory was a grave mistake. Charging right at him, you try to make up for your lack of foresight. Malfoy blocks the first spell and dodges the second, so you holster your wand while closing the distance.
Placing one hand on the golden door handle, he carefully turns it. The door creaks loudly as he pushes it open, the sound resonating throughout the entire house. When Potter doesn’t immediately appear, Draco takes a cautious step forward, then another, until he’s in the front foyer. It’s completely dark by now, but he knows the outline of the house by heart. He’s spent plenty of evenings here; months Flooing in to see Potter in secret.
The silence that follows is very awkward. Draco doesn’t want to say goodbye yet, and even Potter appears to be torn between staying and leaving.
Harry Potter has evidently deigned to show up, and his outfit is as dramatic as his entry. His robes are black as night with Glitter Charms woven into the fabric, turning him into an enticing figure draped in inky night sky that holds Draco captive. His face is obscured by an elaborate masquerade mask, at odds with the dress of all the other attendees, but it fits with the overall aesthetic. Somehow, he has tamed his hair into an attractive sweep of curls that rings the mask and his bright, bright green eyes perfectly.
His eyes fall on big hands kneading dough, on flexing arm muscles, and broad, moving shoulders. The white apron can’t hide the well-toned chest, and Draco is secretly grateful for it. When the person lifts his arm to wipe a bit of sweat off their forehead with a small cloth, Draco sees the most beautiful face ever. Or at least the profile.
Draco has barely hung his coat on its respective hanger when his Floo chimes… and chimes… and chimes. He hastens towards the living room; panic rises within him, and a thousand possible scenarios pop up in his brain, each one more horrible than the previous.
“Up,” Potter commands, his voice husky, and Draco does as he’s told. Potter slowly pulls Draco’s trousers and underwear down until they’re pooled around his ankles, until he’s wearing nothing but his buttoned-up shirt and waistcoat.
“No, but I—” Draco looks down to where one of his hands is still holding a mimosa leaf “—Je suis occupé.”
Pansy snaps him out of his thoughts. “All right then. How many dates have you been on? Tomorrow’s definitely not your second. And please don’t bore me by asking how I know.”
There’s one building nearby with the necessary height for this shot and the skill required to execute it rules out everyone you have ever worked with. Everyone except—
And Harry wouldn’t let anyone tear him away from Draco. No matter what people might offer him, Harry would always choose Draco over all the money, wealth, or fame. Nobody in his entire life had ever understood him the way Draco did.
The whistle of the kettle signals the end of his refuge in the kitchen. He pours the mugs and carries them to the living room. He halts abruptly in the door frame where he can finally see what his guest, or rather the invader of his sacred halls and thief of his precious time, does.
Like the time he’d suddenly opened up about Sirius saving him from drowning, only to be swept away himself. The helplessness against the pure force of nature. Harry had screamed and shouted Sirius’ name for hours, to no avail.
It’s her fault. Hers and her bloody wife’s. Never again will he go out to a 'fun pub night' only to discover that half of their year is present. Potter being among them, of course.
“Oh for Salazar’s sake, how is it that you know almost nothing about your own house?” Draco demands. He casts a disdainful look at Potter. “You’ve been living here for
That startles a laugh out of Harry. “It wasn’t our combined intellect that came up with them. We got wasted at a party, and we lost a bet against one of our friends’ older brother, George. It’s never a good idea to bet against George, especially not while drunk.”
“You liar,” Ginny gasps, looking at her wife. “You told me that you’d rather shag Pince before doing it on a broom.”
Draco’s eyes widen as more of Potter’s gorgeous tanned chest and shoulder comes into view, lovingly backlit by the fire roaring in the grate behind him. Potter catches his eye, and very deliberately runs a hand up from his bare chest to his shoulder and then to his neck, his fingers stopping on the pulse point right below his jaw. He tilts his head as he looks at Draco, very obviously drawing Draco’s attention to his neck, to his fingers tracing little circles on his skin. He looks like a Greek god come to life, a sly curl to his mouth under that tousled hair, one leg crossed seductively in front of the other, half-dressed and inviting.
“Well, I’m exhausted from work, and you’re rather squeamish today.” Draco rubs his forehead before diving back in. “How did you manage to look like this after a training session anyway, Ginny?”
“No more ink on my skin. I have enough marks for a lifetime,” Draco finally says, linking their arms before they walk rather
Potter’s pacing now, antsy like a caged tiger, all thoughts of seduction gone. Draco watches him, waiting. When the silence stretches on and on and Potter doesn’t offer any new suggestions, Draco finally gives in and says, “What about the secret passage?”
One of Draco’s hands finds its way into Potter’s raven hair, running through it in a caress. As Potter starts to swirl his tongue around the head, Draco can’t restrain himself any longer and unthinkingly, he grips a fistful of hair as his moans begin to fill the air. Potter begins to move his hand, stroking Draco’s cock from the base up until it reaches his mouth.
Harry moans again at the loss, and flops back onto the rug, throwing one arm across his face in frustration.
The snort Ginny lets out is so loud, Draco wonders if the entire wizarding community heard it. “I highly doubt that.”
. Just because most of them were in Slytherin doesn’t mean that they used Dark Magic to lock away secret passageways. A blood sacrifice is used to weaken somebody. Why would we do that to our own kin?”
“That’s our queue.” Pansy grabs her wife’s hand, dragging her out of the room. “Make yourself at home, but the only persons who have sex in this house are me and Ginny, clear?”
He takes one more quick glance before he hurriedly brings a hand up to block his view of Potter’s lap, and the goods that are very obviously put on display. “You’re naked!” Draco exclaims, his voice gone high and scandalised. “You’re lying here, in a
“What the actual fuck, Potter.” Draco grabs hold of Potter’s arm and heals the cut, murmuring a spell under his breath. It’s a superficial cut that heals almost instantly, the skin knitting together under the warm glow of the spell.
Under normal circumstances, you’d have never let that happen. Blinded by fury, you miss the signs and Malfoy steps aside, leaving you punching air. You jump and dive straight into an ukemi roll when your ears pick up the sound of a knife flipping open. Space matters now.
He cuddles into Harry’s chest. It’s soothing to hear his heart beat and feel his calloused hand running up and down his side.
These lines were the first thing Draco had said after the doctor had informed them about Pansy passing. They’d been sitting in the car back to the hotel. Harry had been worried because Draco had shut himself off the moment the words had left the doctor’s mouth. At that moment, he’d been looking out of the window — utterly lost and fragile. Harry had been holding his hand, but other than that he didn’t know what to say. ‘Sorry’ wasn’t enough, actually no word in the English language could encompass what Harry was feeling.
“I could put in a good word for you. That might help. No, it’ll definitely help.” Potter smiles, but the smile doesn’t reach his eyes. He’s watching Draco carefully, gauging his responses.
Draco rolls his eyes, but he wants to get out of the room as much as Potter does. He walks over to the bookcase. The rim of each shelf is lined in rich gold, and in the flickering firelight it looks like the shelves are luminous. Which, Draco supposes, is the entire point of it.
“Potter, I’ve literally had my cock up your arse in a loo before. Anyway, clean up the mess you made. I’m not going back out like this,” Draco huffs with a goofy smile on his face.
After the incident earlier, Draco has been fuming all day. To his dismay, there’s a big window on the right wall of the flower shop, offering a perfect view into the bakery, and whenever Draco’s risked a glance, he’s told himself to be angry, to not pay attention to the way Harry’s trousers hug his arse in all the right places. To not wish he were the customer at whom Harry was smiling. It was similar to, but not quite the same as the smile Draco saw on him yesterday, and the only reason he wants Harry to smile at him again is because this small gesture makes people happy. Anything else would be preposterous.
“Luna gave them to me when she visited yesterday. And,” Harry hesitates, but forges on when Draco gives him an encouraging look, “she basically told me to not let you leave so easily again.”
“Oh for fuck’s sake,” he says as he enters the house, his voice echoing into the depths of the house, “now this is just ridiculous. No house wards, no locks, and he didn’t set up the traps like I told him to? At the rate he’s going, he almost deserves to get clobbered to death by some crazy fan, that stupid arse.”
He attempts to turn away, only to realise that Potter’s still holding onto his wrist. Draco gasps as Potter begins to kiss said wrist, his lips soft against Draco’s skin. Potter looks up through his eyelashes, his tongue tracing the stark black lines of the Mark on Draco’s arm, his gaze intent. Shocked, Draco pulls his hand away from Potter in a one swift, sharp movement, and promptly drops the book.
“Please, I don’t know anything.” His face is unreadable in the twilight, but his voice is quivering.
Potter carries on, almost talking to himself as he tries to puzzle out the mystery before him. “I can’t decipher the notes, but we have similar, albeit simpler ways of encoding messages. We’ve been trained to detect them, and are instructed to at least attempt to decipher them on our own. The ones you used are almost impossible to crack, and usually, we would’ve given these notes to another department.” He lifts his gaze to focus on Draco as he says slowly, “...to the Department of Mysteries. That’s your department, isn’t it? You’re an Unspeakable. I’m almost sure of it. ”
Millicent makes an attempt at pointing her wand at her throat as if to cast a Sonorus, but Pansy stops her mid-motion. “I think we’ve teased him enough. What do you think of Ernie’s sister, Draco? I think you’d have lovely children.”
Potter’s eyes glitter as he leans forward challengingly, his green eyes still fixed on Draco’s face. He tracks Draco’s every movement even as he leans down to pick up his glass again, sipping at the wine. Draco can feel his pulse quickening when, unthinkingly, Potter licks his lips, still staring at Draco as his tongue collects a stray drop of wine from the corner of his mouth. It’s the same mouth that had driven him mad earlier, and the faint mark of Potter’s handiwork is still evident on his neck.
On Harry’s suggestion, they relocate upstairs to his flat, rendering Draco seated across from Harry in the dimmed light of his cosy kitchen. Add to that Harry’s soft expression, and Draco is suddenly unsure of what this is. He holds Harry’s gaze this time, feeling challenged by the man, and it’s not like he can start eating when his host hasn’t. He might not have acted like a Malfoy the entire evening, or the entire last two days if he’s honest, but he hasn’t forgotten everything he’s been taught.
“Right back at you. And since you’re stalling, I’m figuring your date went either incredibly well or horribly bad.”
Draco reveals that he went commando under his robes — they’re surprisingly rough — on his first day as a Healer. As everyone has expected, Ginny and Pansy have had sex in a bed while someone else was sleeping next to them, apparently more than once. What shocks both Ginny and Draco though is that their partners are members of the Fly High Club.
In between, flashes from last night creep back into his head. The harder Draco forces them out, the more they come back. Every inch of his body that Harry has touched tingles, and it's amazing and awful all at the same time. A once-in-a-lifetime thing, and Draco wishes he hadn't been tipsy when it happened.
That night was perfect in every way possible. It was a high like he’s never experienced before. Sometimes, when he’s all alone, he catches himself wishing the person were… Draco shakes his head lightly as he gets up from his seat. It’s impossible and he knows it.
Potter’s eyes are suddenly wide, his gaze fixed on Draco’s face. Draco simply shoves Potter behind him once he’s done. He glances back over his shoulder, his eyes dark as he stands in the same position that Potter had stood just mere seconds ago. “Just exactly how barbaric do you think my ancestors were, Potter? A
“Practice game, and the new Beaters are very… unerring. Which is good, but I wasn’t really prepared for that.”
It takes a few minutes for Pansy to enter the room. When she lays eyes on him, she simply asks, “When?”
Draco doesn’t get the chance to reply before Potter leans in again to kiss his neck, nipping gently at his skin. Potter’s warm breath on his neck sends tendrils of excitement running through Draco, his skin goosepimpling with anticipation. He can’t resist, and he leans back to rest his head on Potter's shoulder, giving him full access. Potter takes full advantage of it, dragging his tongue in hot little swipes against Draco’s neck. Draco’s white-blond hair sticks in sweaty strands to his forehead, his cheeks are red, and his cock is straining against the zipper of his trousers.
Potter begins to move, shifting his weight as he pushes himself to sit upright, his legs folded gracefully underneath him. His bathrobe conveniently falls open as he does, displaying his  body up to the navel, though most of it is, thankfully, still hidden in the shadows from the folds of the robe.
The kiss goes on and on and on. Draco revels in the feel of Potter’s lips on his and vows to repeat this kissing-Potter-thing. Regretfully, he pulls away (because he’s not exactly an athlete and maintaining the dipped position is hell on his core muscles) and stands up straight.
The box Potter produces is enormous. Draco has never seen such a long wand — at least seventeen inches.
That's why Draco had come back; Narcissa. Being a Healer, an expert in Spell Damage, can't help his mother if he’s hundreds of miles away. He can't support her from France, and he
Harry presses open-mouthed kisses over every inch of skin he can reach. Draco bites back his own moans and puts more effort into getting Harry off.
He picks it up and gasps, “Wow, that's huge—” followed by “—Sorry!—” when he almost drops it because his arm isn’t used to handle so much wood.
Harry chuckles. “They’re not all like this, thank Godric. There’s been a few over the years that’s made me want to say ‘fuck it all’, though. I never thought owning a bakery could be so stressful at times.”
“And you’ll be a Potions Master soon, I gather. At least that was what I got off the notes in that book you’ve left here. Why haven’t you told me before? We always need good suppliers for the Department. When we’re out in the field, potions are some of our lifesavers.” Potter’s voice is casual, like they’re just talking shop.
He grins down at Harry’s stunned face and leans forward to lick the scars that crisscross Harry’s chest. He seals each lick with a kiss, and Harry pushes himself up on his elbows to watch him, shuddering under each kiss. Draco moves slowly, and by the time he’s done, Harry’s twitching under his touch and swearing under his breath.
He’s unceremoniously dumped onto the couch — Ginny is too strong for his liking — and has a glass of wine in his hand within seconds. Courtesy of Pansy.
As one, their steps quicken in unison, and he hears Potter exhaling in a quiet sigh of relief when they cross the threshold from cold stone to warm wood, and arrive back to the warmth of the library fire still burning away in the grate. In one dramatic movement, Draco untangles their joined hands and walks over to the bay window. He sits down on a plush cushion, then looks around and realises that the room has changed in their absence.
It takes all of Draco’s willpower to force himself to look away. He bites down on the insides of his cheek, and the sharp pain reminds him why he’s here.
“Oh,” he says, faint, when Harry puts a hand in-between his legs, and holds up a sticky finger coated with Draco’s cum, examining it before he wipes it off on the rug. Draco can’t hold himself up any longer. He flops down next to Harry, exhausted and happy. Streaks of Harry’s cum are drying on his stomach and chest, and he finds that he likes it, likes being marked by Harry like this.
Draco moans, a long, shuddering groan as he feels himself emptying into Harry, his hips still jerking. Harry wraps an arm around him, holds him through his orgasm. Draco presses their foreheads together, trying to catch his breath.
“No, I can handle them, don’t worry. You’re gonna get us breakfast while I’m changing. No arguments.”
He’s lost in everything, he’s forgotten all about his own, by now achingly hard, cock. When Harry wraps his hand around it, Draco is ready to burst. His muscular fingers alter between loosely moving up and down and applying just the right amount of pressure. Every time Draco thinks he’s gonna come, Harry readjusts his grip. Torture in the best of ways.
Clothed in one of Harry’s heady-scented t-shirts, Draco tentatively slips beneath the quilt they’ll apparently be sharing. While Harry's bed is certainly big enough for two adults, they're lying closer than Draco would’ve liked. Every time Harry touches him — why in Circe’s name can’t he keep his hands to himself — his body responds way too much.
Draco can see the shiver that runs through Harry’s body before he complies. He locks eyes with Draco the entire time he gets down on all fours and presents his arse to Draco. Harry arches his back as he does, then turns his head to watch Draco over his shoulder. It’s not what Draco had in mind, but he has never allowed Harry to turn around whenever they had sex previously. It was Draco’s way of self-preservation, of trying to stop himself from feeling anything for Harry. Now, for the first time, he wants to see Harry’s face when he comes.
Greg’s eyes narrowed and his jaw clenched. He couldn’t help it; he had never really liked Theodore Nott. There was nothing specifically
“The more the merrier,” Charlie replied cheerfully before Lily could. Lily was too busy looking shocked to even so much as squeak. “I’m Charlie, by the way. Charlie Weasley.” Daphne turned to shake his hand, a wide smile breaking out across her face and a faint blush rising on her cheeks.
“I don’t know what you did, and I won’t pretend I agree with it,” Alex whispered, wrapping his arms around the blonde, because he knew his bride to be and knew she must have done something, “but I love you. Always.” Lily nodded, pressing her face into his neck and breathing him in. Alex tilted his head down and kissed her crown of curls, swaying them together with the music again.
“If I had known wearing my heels in front of you would lead to that, I would have done it years ago,” Malfoy sighed. He seemed to realize what he had said because his body suddenly stiffened and he began to draw back. But Harry just laughed and tightened his grip around Malfoy’s waist, pulling him flush against his body.
“How could I not? You two were dancing queens at my house for New Year’s,” the woman laughed, and suddenly it clicked. Daphne Greengrass. She looked practically the same, just a little aged. How could he forget Draco’s oldest friend?
“No, but when I was looking through some boxes in the basement, I found some information,” she started lightly. “I think I might have figured it out.”
He barely had time to say hello to the rapidly approaching women before they were both throwing themselves at him, wrapping their arms around him and squeezing him tight. They were acting as though they hadn’t seen him in years, despite having seen him months ago. Though, with everything going on, he supposed he hadn’t had time to floo them as regularly as he usually did. The women stepped back, both holding him at arm’s length so they could look at him as much as he was scrutinizing them.
“So does that mean you’ll help?” Teddy asked when no other answer was forth coming. Pansy paused to glance at him, a curious expression on her face as she studied him.
“Can I take my shoes off now, Potter?” Malfoy mumbled into Harry’s shoulder and Harry laughed. He managed enough strength to lean down and pull the heels off, giving each of Malfoy’s feet a gentle squeeze as he did.
“Should we tell him?” Greg finally asked the question they were all thinking, but the expressions turned on him told him they weren’t quite sure how this fit into their plan. Yet.
“Mm, lovely,” Hermione said absentmindedly, opening one of the kitchen drawers and shuffling through the papers they kept inside.
Charlie found Lily across the Taverna, by one of the exits. He grinned at her, his face warm with drink.
“Yes! Yes we absolutely do!” Lily shouted, pushing Victoire back aside and taking her spot in front of the fire again.
“It’s never too late.” Charlie laughed with his head thrown back, his grin widening as he looked down again.
A short mirror Malfoy must have conjured or transfigured lay on the ground against the wall. He was taking small steps back and forth in it, practically spinning on his toes when he turned to walk the other way. His focus was entirely on his feet and legs in the mirror, admiring his new shoes.
“I already went,” Harry said roughly and forced himself to look away from Malfoy. “Truth or dare, ‘Moine?”
“No one knows Harry better than you, ‘Mione. Do you really think Lily’s parentage will matter to him?”
The audience erupted into loud cheers and whistles and thunderous applause. The entire taverna seemed to shake with the energy as the trio on stage laughed and bowed. Harry grinned, clapping and whistling right along. Draco was just straightening up from a third bow when he glanced back at the bar and froze. Grey eyes met green and all at once everything around them seemed to completely fade away. The sound dropped to a faint hum and all Harry could hear was the sound of his own heartbeat clogging his ears. Fuck, how could he still be so in love even after all this time? How could nothing mean more than the blonde man he had only managed to fight with since seeing him for the first time in
The man was quiet and reserved in a way that Lily usually wasn’t, but Teddy grew up with Lily even if the first half of their lives was mostly long distance. He had watched her silently fade into the background, studying the people around her before engaging. Watching her interact with different people through the years was like watching a dozen different sides of his cousin. It didn’t seem to matter if the person was a studious introvert who lived in the library or a sports buff who breathed Quidditch – Lily fit herself in one way or another. Lily had laughed when he mentioned it. She’d called it “social flexibility.” It didn’t seem strange to Teddy that she already had a name for it until he overheard Draco teasing Theo for the same thing. Theo had been around a lot when they were young; Teddy had assumed that perhaps Lily had picked it up from him. Now, Teddy knew that Lily had inherited the trait.
