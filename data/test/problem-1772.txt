“Do you?” Harry can smell fresh grass cuttings from the bin, sugar carried on the breeze as Teddy yells something giddy, incomprehensible.
“Honestly, Harry,” Draco’s saying, and oh,
want to come. Like, right now.” Draco looks at him properly, half-naked and reclined against the pillows, a very pointed look on his face, like he really isn’t used to getting this far in the undressing process before being jumped. To be fair to him, they
There are a lot of ways to make the separation easier, and renting
“Harry,” Draco says into his hair, when Harry shows no signs of letting him out of the circle of his arms anytime soon. “They’ll quite literally launch the thing without me.”
Harry sucks air into his lungs, feeling a bit lightheaded, in a pleasant, floaty sort of way. Malfoy watches him, one hand still combing through his hair.
“God, do you ever shut up?” Potter asks, walking them backwards with her hands now under Draco’s arse for balance, toeing off her shoes as she goes. She throws Draco unceremoniously onto the bed — Draco absolutely does not
“Harry, really,” Hermione reprimands with a sigh when she comes over and finds him on the sofa, all the lights off and Harry already on his second re-watch of the afternoon.
“Oh,” he says, when Harry screws his eyes shut and his hips buck needily upwards, teetering on the edge. He leans down and touches his mouth to Harry’s, Harry’s lips pressed too tightly together with the effort of not breathing to actually kiss back, and says “Ok,” just like that, simple and decisive, and Harry comes on a long, perfect exhale, back arching as Malfoy strokes him through it, limbs locking and then seeming to deflate, like all the air in his body has been expelled with that one breath.
Potter’s plonked himself down very close to Draco and he leans into him right away. Draco doesn’t know why he expected Potter, who’s practically the patron saint of throwing oneself into things, to be less forward now that they’ve crossed whatever line this is, but he’s surprised again how easily Potter just kisses him, no preamble.
and Draco hopes there’s no one else in the house, bloody hell.
Potter’s staring out of the window. “It never feels like Christmas until it snows.”
over.
, Potter, I get it.” Draco pulls his knees up and wraps his arms around them, stares at the rain outside and tries hard not to miss his dad. He’s not surprised that it doesn’t work -- he’s been failing at it for months.
“Oh.” Potter smiles so wide Draco can see his fucking molars. “It’s been better. Didn’t you say something about warming it up?”
Potter flips two fingers at him.
Harry screwed his face up. “Yeah, but. I don’t know.” He sighed, never able to say what he meant because he couldn’t find the right words. “Thanks, I guess. Is what I’m getting at. For still wanting to— you know. Be around me, even with all this other shit.”
Draco wears the stupid paper crown.
Harry looks over when the ball bounces off his skull and glares at her. “What?”
He tenses up, and Harry, still eager to hear his name on Malfoy’s lips one more time, prods firmly at his prostate and hollows his cheeks. Malfoy’s almost nonverbal at this point, making noises that are less words than pained, desperate sounds, but — God,
“Fine.” Her tone is exactly the same as before: reluctant, annoyed that this is their only option. She jabs her wand. “Get in then.”
God—”
“Harry’s not very good at realising things,” Lovegood says cryptically, nudging Draco out of the way gently to get to the cupboard behind him.
Seamus starts laughing and Ginny shakes her head, face splitting into a grin. “Oh god,” she says. “Oh my god.”
Malfoy, annoyingly perceptive as he is, looks shrewdly at him. “Someone stamp on your head again?”
What he doesn’t like, is the stupid sight correction charm. He can’t wear his glasses for games, for obvious reasons, unless he wants to replace them every week, so he sticks with the spell, even though it feels like someone’s digging their thumbs into his temples when practice goes on too long.
The bathroom smells good, sort of clean and woody, which means Potter definitely nicked some of his products again. Not that Draco really minds. It’s distracting, is all, having to wash himself with soap bars that may or may not have touched Potter’s body, lathering shampoo into his hair from a bottle that might have, only hours before, had Potter’s hand wrapped around it, squeezing.
“Merlin
“It’s the only thing left I can think of,” he says to himself, out loud, and Potter raises his eyebrows. Parts his lips further, probably to ask Draco what the hell he’s talking about, but he doesn’t get a chance. Draco kisses him.
drunk.
Potter makes a humming noise, one Draco recognises from when he was to prod Potter awake in the middle of the night and tell him it’s his turn to keep watch.
His nostrils flare for a minute but then he sighs, seeming to deflate. He comes over and sits heavily on the floor next to Draco.
Draco shakes his head, wincing as it moves against the pillow. He’s never touched sheets with this low a thread count before, they’re like paper, and the head injury isn’t particularly comfortable either. “Don’t think so. I mean, can’t be sure, obviously. But I don’t usually get this far.” He hasn’t woken up somewhere other than that street for more days than he can count. If he ever sees the godforsaken place again it’ll be too soon. When all this is over, if Potter wants to move back to his bloody birth town, Draco’ll just have to put his foot down, he’s not living within ten miles of the place and oh, where did
In truth, he made for a strangely comforting presence. Harry liked living alone but it was nice all the same, on nights when he couldn’t sleep, to know he only had to push open the door off the landing to see Draco, muttering to himself about cloud coverage or the incessant annoyance of aeroplanes always throwing off his charts.
the parents?” Potter says, like Draco hasn’t spoken. “I’ve been meaning to ask.”
“Merlin, fine,” Potter says, and her muttering about high-maintenance insufferable pureblood
Draco shoves him right back, hard enough that Harry stumbles to the side, giggling like an idiot. “Oh my God,” Draco scoffs, fighting a smile. “Fuck
“That’s what does it for you?” she asks, deliberately elongating her vowels and exaggerating her consonants, though she doesn’t know how much of it comes through the desperate tone her words have taken on.
Neville only snorts in response.
Draco runs a hand through her own hair distractedly, messing it up in a way she absolutely had not practiced in front of the mirror when she’d first cut it short a couple of years ago. Years of slicking it back into a tight ponytail are over and now it falls loose and messy down to her cheekbones.
At two minutes to midnight, Draco watches the clock on his desk tick down and hopes his mother’s ok. Someone lets off fireworks somewhere when the two hands meet up, he can hear them echo, but they must be over in the direction of Hogsmeade because he can’t see anything out of his window except for the star-filled sky, even when he turns his bedroom light off and leans there, cheek against the cold glass, watching.
“I know,” he says, simply, and offers a hand to pull Harry up and into the craft, the two of them, for the first time, on the same side of the sleek metal walls that have been separating them over and over for years.
necessary when Draco works him open, though. Feels pretty vital.
“Christmas was two weeks ago, Potter.”
The thing about saying goodbye to Draco so that he can go and climb aboard a rocket and get flung into space, Harry’s learned, is that it doesn’t get any easier, no matter how many times he has to do it.
of an inconvenience. I know you’re in there.”
So far he’s managed to uphold both conditions: he’s generally decent (though not entirely, he is still
“Oi,” Potter says, turning Draco’s face back to hers so she can kiss her again. “’S not my fault. You were giving me bedroom eyes all night.”
"I suppose you always liked an entrance," he tells Blaise.
“Yeah, I know, I just-- never heard someone use it in verb form like that.”
“It’s not the fucking same at all.”
Potter smiles, a small one, but Draco feels a strange sense of accomplishment anyway. “Oh, I don’t know,” he says. “I know where you sleep.”
Draco’s chest fills with dread when he looks down to see Potter’s eyes are closed. “I’m trying to save your life here, Potter.”
“Now.” Her face is round and friendly, but her tone is firm. “Are you sure there’s no one I can call? Your parents?”
“Potter,” she says, keeping her voice level with a bit of effort. “Fun night?” It’s a stupid question but she’s not going to do anything so crass as wish Potter a happy birthday and she can’t think of anything else to say. They don’t talk, normally, they just occasionally exchange smouldering eye contact whenever they happen to stumble across one another.
Potter shrugs with one shoulder. “Tradition, isn’t it?”
“Hello,” Draco all but yells back. It’s so loud here, in the thick of it. She can see Pansy giving her very unhelpful thumbs-ups over Potter’s shoulder but it’s enough to get her over the initial shock of having Potter suddenly all up in her face. She moves closer on the pretext of casually starting to move to the music again and then they’re sort of— in each other’s space, moving together.
He’s been meaning to ask the pair of them about Potter, actually, whether there’s anything to be done to make things between them less— well,
Draco sighs and stretches his legs out. “Be more like this. More often, I mean. You’re surprisingly well adjusted most of the time.” That and forgiving. More accepting than Draco’d ever dared hope for.
Weasley frowns at him, and Potter looks so disappointed it makes Draco’s throat tight, but he forces himself not to care. It’ll start all over again soon, and they won’t even remember that he chose to stay outside.
Draco sighs long-sufferingly. “I was going to wash my hair.”
Potter laughs. Draco likes it when he does that and he looks down at his hands, folding them in his lap.
There’s a small ensuite off his bedroom, just a toilet and a sink, but he appreciates the privacy anyway. The elves are even sending food up for him -- Mcgonagall had told him meals in the Great Hall wouldn’t start up again until the rest of the school returned, and it means he doesn’t have to leave his room at all, except when he needs to shower. He still has use of the Prefects’ bathroom for that, if he wants, which feels weirder than anything else for some reason, still having those privileges after everything he’s done. There’s no one around as he walks up the two floors to get there. He doesn’t even pass any ghosts, and it makes him feel like he’s up in the middle of the night, though the sun’s not long gone down.
"Of course I can, me boy. I'll be there in an hour."
Harry averted his eyes from the floor and glanced around the hall to see who was clapping. His eyes landed on Seamus who was smiling brightly at the two boys. Harry saw Seamus mouth the words "proud of you" as he continued to clap. Dean was the next to join in, after shooting a quick thumbs up at Harry and Draco, smiling and nodding his head. Then Neville, then Hannah, then Pansy, then Hermione, then Blaise, then Ron, then the rest of the hall.
"Hey, baby. It's me. Merry Christmas." Draco pressed a kiss to Harry's forehead. "I've got you a gift, but I'm not going to tell you what it is in case you can hear me. I really miss you baby. I want you to be here with me. I need you to be here with me. Please come back to me Harry." Draco sighed gently. "The Weasley's are coming over later. And Hermione and Luna. Neville's here visiting his parents, I'm sure he'll stop by. Pansy and Blaise are also coming. But, it'll just be me and you for most of the day."
Draco heard a crack of twigs above him and immediately opened his eyes. He searched for the cause of the sound and his eyes landed on a little rabbit. He smiled softly, Harry loved rabbits and it never failed to make him smile when he saw one running around the forest.
"What do you mean? I am a great cook and a great teacher, I think you'll find." Draco gasped in mock offence.
Harry knew exactly who he wanted to go with but... he couldn't. It was never going to happen. He couldn't tell Ron and Hermione either, they were his best friends but what would they think if Harry told them who he wanted to go with.
So Draco found himself in his dorm room, a mirror in front of him, attempting to put eyeliner on. His first attempt was dismal, both sides were uneven and the lines were very bumpy. He knew what it was supposed to look like, every line sharp and smooth, he'd seen Pansy apply and wear it enough times to know and Draco was determined to get it right. Malfoy's didn't settle for less than perfection. Draco sat there for hours applying and reapplying, perfecting the art of eyeliner. After what seemed like the hundredth attempt, Draco sat back and admired his reflection. Both sides of eyeliner were even, every line was straight and smooth, wings so sharp they could kill a man. The black liquid framed his eyes perfectly, the grey seeming more like a sliver and the blue flecks, normally very faint, now popped brightly, making his eyes even more stunning than they already were.
"Shut up." Blaise said before grabbing Pansy's hand and walking into the Hall.
"Put the lid back on that. I refuse to let that enter my mouth."
"What actually is an advent calendar?"
"You're everything." Draco said, quietly.
Harry opened the box carefully and gasped when he saw what was inside. He gently took Bud out of the box and cradled him. "You got a puppy?" Harry asked, almost crying.
"Hermione, I know where Harry is."
Ron groaned. "Ugh, they both make me feel so sick. I don't get wizards, like we can do so many cool things but we can't travel without feeling like we've been shoved in a bloody washing machine made for dolls."
Harry took Draco's hand and the two boys walked into the Hall. Everyone turned their heads and were staring at the two boys. Harry's face was burning and he shifted on his feet. Draco gave Harry's hand a reassuring squeeze. All of a sudden, they heard someone clapping. Draco looked over and saw that it was Pansy. Slowly everyone started joining in and Harry and Draco walked into the centre of the dance floor. The music began and the boys started swaying slowly.
Dean Thomas's parents owned a pub and a hotel just outside of London. Everyone had been there before and Dean's friends got discounted prices so it would be relatively easy to take and hide Harry there
The image of Malfoy flooded back through Harry's mind. Had his hair always had golden strands scattered throughout? Had his skin always looked so smooth? Harry tried to remember what they looked like before, had they always been such a stunning shade of silver with bright blue flecks? Had his lashes always been so long and thick? Had Malfoy always looked this pretty?
Harry gently ticked Belle's stomach.
"No, no. We were just-," The person began before Draco cut them off.
"Love you too, mate. Now, go find your date." Seamus said, pushing Harry into the crowds.
"Dance with me." Draco held his hand out.
Harry waited for everyone to filter into the hall before approaching Draco. He looked amazing. Black dress robes with a green sheen, complimenting the boys eyes perfectly.
"But what if they're unsupportive of us?"
A few weeks after Seamus had been caught, Harry had come to Draco and told him he wanted to report the Dursley's for what they did to him. He told Draco that the only way he could make a full recovery is if the Dursley's were punished for what they did. Harry and Draco reported them together and they were all sent to prison, Vernon for child abuse, sexual assault and rape, Petunia and Dudley for child abuse.
“I wasn’t expecting it, that first night. Suddenly it had all these flowers again and then you were there in the window, which was, you know, a whole other-- surprise.”
“It is,” Draco says and watches him look around, watches his eyes take in the bed and the bookshelves and the thick rug that Draco had shrunk down and brought over from his favourite parlour at home.
“Fuck,” he sighs, unsure whether he’s relieved or not. “Ok. One more time.”
Draco hums again. He’s tired, in that slow, comforting way. It’s late; he doesn’t know long they’ve been up talking. He should probably go to bed soon, or he’ll fall asleep and tip right over the edge of the sill.
stream,” Luna admonishes, frowning.
Potter hums in agreement, eyes still fixed on the view.
“Food’s about ready,” Harry says, chest warm when Draco smiles, easy and sweet, and gets up to follow him downstairs.
Granger doesn’t respond, or Draco doesn’t hear her, distracted by Potter’s small, hitched noises, indistinguishably pain or pleasure, Draco can’t tell.
Luna makes a doubtful noise. Ginny listens to her turning more pages, staring resolutely at a frozen picture of a politician she doesn’t know. The way Muggle photos don’t move really weirds her out.
Potter’s face cracks into a small smile. “Told you. Can’t sleep.”
“Nice catch.” Potter laughs, sounding disproportionately pleased that Draco’s appeared. He looks good, not just in his jeans and t-shirt, but happy. Draco hadn’t registered the subtle tension in his face this past week until he looks down now and sees it gone.
Harry's been missing it for two weeks.
“Right.” Neville raises his eyebrows. Everyone in this house has a bloody eyebrow-raising problem. Maybe that’s why Malfoy fit right in.
a hundred times,” he says, gesturing at his own face.
Potter’s hand twitches against his thigh, like he was going to reach out and thought better of it. “I had help. People to talk to.”
Even thinking about it makes him sway slightly for a moment, the distance between he and Potter shortening dangerously. Potter clears his throat and Draco blinks slowly.
“Lobsters,” Harry says, to break the slightly awkward silence.
He swears and crouches lower over Potter, trying to share some of his body heat, but there’s not much of it to spare. Potter quirks a look at him at this new position and ok, Draco is practically on top of him, his body held uncomfortably upwards to avoid crushing the gaping hole in Potter’s side, but he’s
Quite of its own accord, his hand has found its way into his trousers and he presses the heel of it against his cock to relieve some pressure. Next door, Malfoy’s moans have taken on a breathy quality and he’s going to come before Harry can bloody well decide what to do, the bastard. Something’s going to have to give, and soon. He can’t just keep secretly getting off to his roommate’s sex noises indefinitely.
Potter seems unperturbed, still climbing up the side of the castle and dripping all over Draco’s floor.
about it, too happy to see each other again to be bitter. Or at least, that’s how he feels. Maybe that night hasn’t been weighing on Draco’s mind (heart,
The man was sweet, was the problem, innocent and unassuming, old enough to be Harry’s grandfather, and all he wanted to do was thank Harry, talk to him for a moment. The war had felt like a lifetime ago, even then, a million miles away from that sun-drenched street where Draco’s hand was in his and all he had to think about was what flavour of ice-cram he was going to get, but Harry had smiled as best he could and let the stranger pat him shakily on the shoulder. He’s never thought he deserved any kind of praise for what he did as a teenager, not now and not then, but he wasn’t going to be an arse about it. He wasn’t going to tell a nice old man to leave him alone.
Draco rolls his eyes. “Good night, Potter.”
— but he nods after a moment.
Draco’s head is starting to feel warm and muffled, like someone’s wrapped something around it. He uncurls a leg, pokes a foot into Potter’s shoulder, gentle. Potter rocks sideways anyway. “Why do you do that?”
He hadn’t been able to stomach most of it, just venturing far enough to feel what had been ruined, to establish which of his childhood memories had been blackened beyond repair and what rooms he could go in now without feeling sick.
“Oi,” Weasley calls from the end of the aisle. “One of you please come tell ‘Mione there’s no point having a Christmas dinner if we’re not getting pigs-in-blankets.”
All that time spent muffling his moans face-down into the pillow and his dick seems to have started associating the limit to his oxygen supply with coming his brains out.
“Hi.”
Weasley tries to stun Dolohov but he dances aside and cackles, shoots a jet of fire out of his wand that sets the mouldy curtains alight.
Has he finally caught on to the fact that Draco is, maybe, a little bit into him and is now uncomfortable? He’s fun to mess with, sure, but Draco doesn’t want to make things weird and have to move out.
It works -- Potter looks far from annoyed. His smile’s widened, teeth sunk into his lower lip again to try and contain it and his eyebrows have lifted in amusement. “Went a bit far there,” he says, eyebrows climbing even higher. “Bit over the top. Less believable.”
“I was twelve,” Weasley says, exasperated, but his eyes are on Potter, watching him with a worried expression.
The turkey ends up tasting a bit off, whether because it was from a discount supermarket or because Weasley has to shrink it and then regrow it again in order to get it cooked properly, Draco doesn’t know, but it’s not bad after his third mug of wine, and even he can admit Weasley makes a damn good roast potato. Granger puts away about nine of them, and half a mushroom wellington.
The day of, Draco’s antsy, his energy high and restless. He goes into work before Harry’s even out of bed and they meet at reception once Harry’s had some breakfast and thrown some clothes into a bag. What exactly one brings to space, Harry has no idea, but he steals a couple of jumpers out of Draco’s room, assuming the t-shirts and shorts he packed for the Florida heat won’t cut it.
“Ok,” Potter says quickly, quietly. “Ok, we have two options,” but he doesn’t get the chance to tell them what the options are, because there’s the unmistakable sound of a door opening down the hall.
He turns and heads off down a long corridor, leaving Harry to follow along behind.
Draco lets her slump them both down further, content to lie there against Harry. Harry entwines the fingers of their hands and Draco rolls her eyes but allows it.
Draco’s known Blaise for over a decade, long enough to read the relief in the lifting of the corners of his mouth, the almost invisible apprehension and the genuine, if well-hidden, warmth at seeing Draco again.
Nobody bothers to answer him. Draco inspects the tiny plastic penguin that fell out of his and cranks the wind-up dial on the side until its little feet start pedalling frantically, startling him.
Hermione huffs, twitching her notes out of the way of bits of flying chess-piece. “We don’t
The summer days, long enough to begin with, seem to stretch on longer and longer that week. Harry’s starting to think he might be losing his mind a little, keeps walking around in a sort of warm haze, the kind where he often catches himself standing, eyes unfocussed, staring unseeingly at random walls whilst his mind strays unhelpfully to Malfoy.
Granger stands there, fretting. “Couldn’t we try Side—? she starts to say, but Draco’s losing patience.
Draco feels her bones go all pliable at the level tone and the words Potter says so freely. Potter’s teeth are a light scrape on the skin where her neck meets her shoulder. One strap of her top falls down her arm and she starts trying to get her jeans off without even undoing the button, almost braining Potter with the back of her head when she pushes up to get them over her arse.
Weasley laughs. “Fair point. Now you mention it, I seem to remember you being
“Get these out the way,” Potter says, and Draco is pleased to note she sounds breathless too, like she’s as gone for this as Draco is. She pats at Draco’s hip with the hand that Draco hasn’t just had in her mouth, and Draco obediently pulls her knickers off and kicks them off the end of the bed. Potter wastes no time in getting straight down to it then, pushing one finger into Draco as Draco tries not to writhe around unattractively and fails. Although, she might actually manage to do it attractively, if the way Potter has started making these appreciative noises is anything to go by.
Harry kisses up her neck, her other hand pinching one nipple between her fingers so that Draco gasps and jerks back into her. “Fuck yes,” she breathes. “Your posh pureblood accent talking about tasting me— Jesus, Draco.”
Draco stops listening. Potter’s eyes have fluttered closed. “Potter,” he says, sharp.
He does, at least, stop Dolohov’s initial spell, the one that goes off like a small explosion. Dolohov tries it again right after Draco blocks him, succeeds in blowing out all the windows, but by that point Draco’s had just enough time to shout “Granger! The bag!” in warning and get a hastily conjured shield up, which protects them from the worst of the flying glass.
It’s that odd, nothing-y bit of late December after Christmas that he used to spend curled up in his room with his gifts, or slumped in the library at the Manor, eating whenever he felt like it and watching his parents decide whose New Year’s party they would be making an appearance at that year.
or whatever she might accuse him of. He’s fine with it because he doesn’t really think about her in that way anymore. Seeing her happy and having fun, even with people that aren’t him, only makes him happy.
Draco doesn’t even know why Potter and her friends are here, she and Pansy come to this bar specifically because it’s usually packed out with most of the wizarding population of London under the age of 30. It’s the kind of place Potter avoids unless she wants to get mobbed. She must have made an exception for her birthday — and Draco cannot be blamed for knowing that, it’s been all over the press — and she watches as Potter starts making her way towards the bar. Draco shifts so she’s hidden from view by Pansy in a move that is clearly not as subtle as she thinks because Pansy snorts at her.
“Tell me things like that. Tell me anything at all, whilst we’re on the subject.” Draco laughs, once, curling his legs back under him.
I’m going to—,” he pants, slipping a small amount further down Harry’s throat. Harry pulls his fingers out and shoves them back in, timing it with his slow pull back off Malfoy’s cock, and then speeds everything up, works his hands and his mouth together as Malfoy continues to babble above him. “Yes,
“It’s actually quite fascinating,” she says, defensive. “I’ve never even
Draco steps back, out of arm's reach, but doesn’t turn to leave yet. “Hey,” he says. “I love you”
He rubs his side, glares hard. “Now he’s going to think I’m into some kinky shit.”
“I’ll have to start
“Hang on,” Draco says. “How did you know the bag exploded?” He nods at where the bag is very obviously still intact, clutched in her hand.
“Are you watching this?”
“God bless the NHS,” he says, and the four of them file through the many corridors, hidden under Notice-Me-Nots until they’re outside in the dark. The snow here is barely snow at all, grey slush on tarmac under the wheels of hundreds of cars.
Clearly he hasn’t spotted Draco, which is fair enough seeing as Draco’s sitting there in the dark. His eyes are on the ground, scanning for rocks to assault the window with, probably. It makes Draco want to laugh, the sight of him bent over, hands in his pockets, slightly unbalanced. He hadn’t felt like laughing in months before he came back to school.
Potter’s not really helping his concentration either, propped sideways in the window, one leg either side so that he’s half-in, half-out, chatting inanely about things like: “It’s weird that everyone’s going to be spread all over the castle, isn’t it?”
Harry picks a fight on his last night because he can’t take it anymore. They never fight — on a day-to-day basis they don’t
“Morning to you, too,” says Potter, and Draco turns to find him only feet away. They’re in adjacent beds, the walls white, the clinical smell of disinfectant everywhere.
Harry rolls his eyes. “Seriously.” He knocks their elbows together. “Friends? We could do friends.” He can do friends, he
If he really does like Harry, though, why all this messing around? Are they so far past a simple “fancy a drink, Potter?”?
that sends pieces of brick and plaster rebounding all over the place. For a brief second Draco wonders if he’s not the only one stuck in a loop, some of Dolohov’s moves are starting to seem a little too premeditated, but then:
“Right.” Potter claps his hands together. Draco’s become quite familiar with that little move. It’s the “I think I believe you but literally nothing is going to change my mind about walking into this house” clap.
Potter laughs, loud and incredulous and then stands back, hands shoved in his pockets. He seems to be assessing the wall underneath the window and Draco has about two seconds to process that before he strides forwards and gets a hand on the trellis that’s built onto the castle wall. It's new; Draco was surprised to see it that first night, but he likes the look of it against the brick, the weaving ivy and the small white flowers. It’s pretty and delicate and unlikely to hold Potter’s weight. Draco can’t watch; he’d meant the
be responsible for thousands of galleons worth of delay compensation if I make them wait any longer.”
“Yeah.”
Draco’s hands are gentle where they close around Potter’s wrists and tug his hands down. The skin under Draco’s fingers is hot, Potter’s glasses slightly fogged up from where he’s been breathing into his hands.
“How they expect us to learn anything,” Draco would say, when it would start raining and he and Harry would have to cart all the equipment inside to clutter up the spare bedroom instead, “when the light pollution is this bad and most students can’t afford a place with
The back of the castle -- his side, as he’s already unconsciously started thinking of it -- really is pressed right up against the edge of the hills, the ground starting to slope upwards barely twenty feet from the stone walls. It’s sheltered, quieter out of the wind. Draco looks up at his own window but keeps his head forward as he passes it. If Potter sees him go by, he doesn’t make any effort to let know Draco know he’s there, and Draco carries on until he’s out on the bank, staring at the sky reflected so perfectly in the surface of the lake that the two are almost indistinguishable from one another.
And he’s been in a permanent state of semi-arousal since Malfoy’s fucking move-in day, but that’s beside the point.
“Don’t fucking say it,” Draco pants, pressing hard on the wadded up jumper even though he knows it won’t work, hasn’t worked, any of the other times.
Potter opens his mouth just as they pull onto the slip road. “Bit of a—”
Draco would have thought this payback for his whole yoga display at the weekend — the look on Potter’s face when Draco had demonstrated the plow pose — but unfortunately this is something Potter does every week. Not the intense eye contact, so much, but the weekly pre-game stretching before he heads off to pummel several large, sweaty men in pursuit of a ball.
Draco narrows his eyes at him. “Come on, Potter, you’ve had worse. Watching you try to dance at the Yule Ball,
“You could, you know,” he says, after Harry mentions offhand that he wouldn’t mind seeing what it’s like up there for himself. They’re at the Space Centre, the Muggle one, with Teddy running excitedly ahead and Draco snorting at the inaccuracies he keeps finding in the information boards. “I have way more leverage with this new position. I could pull some strings.”
“Seven months,” says Draco, like Harry needs reminding. “It’ll almost be Christmas by then, we can go to that winter pop-up in Hoxton that you like.”
“Malfoy,” says Potter, quiet. His hands have wound themselves tight into the front of Draco’s jumper.
Potter looks at him deadpan for a second before pulling his glasses off his face to clean them on the bottom of his t-shirt. “I didn’t like it the first time.” He slumps down until his back is pressed against the wall under the window. Draco has to put his legs down flat so he can still see him. “I thought they were so annoying. Dramatic.”
lumpy. A dodgy back might be a reasonable price to pay for consecutive nights of uninterrupted sleep.
The year Draco gets promoted to a job with a title so long and complicated that it doesn’t even fit on the subject line of the email he sends, Harry goes to space. He’s in Florida for the first time since that night on the beach, just
Draco, climbing in ahead, turns back to him, smiles when he sees the look on Harry’s face, expression clearing until he looks ten years younger, just as excited as if this were novel to him, too, and not just an everyday part of his nine to five.
“Robbie,” she says, shocked into smiling, and Potter laughs too. He does that most times when Draco has to use that piece of information. It makes Draco wish Granger had picked something else; it’s getting too hard to watch Potter’s smiling face knowing that in less than an hour, it'll be screwed up in pain.
“Hi,” he says and immediately loses his balance when he tries to prop himself up with his elbows.
bored, which is making her think a run and a cold bath might have been a better way to spend the afternoon.
Potter gives her a look. “C’mon, ‘Mione. We need to save our pain relief potions. They’d be giving them to me anyway if I stayed.”
acting like the wounded party.”
“I didn’t want to be too high, you know.” Potter’s rambling. “I didn’t want a view of the forest.” He flinches like he’s said too much. Apparently he’s the kind of person who’ll just keep talking if there’s an uncomfortable silence to fill. Draco’s never noticed that before, but then they’ve hardly had many conversations over the years.
Tom walked over to him and gently took his hands, stopping Severus from cause himself any more harm.
“Yes, alright you can groom my wings.” He stood up and guided Harry until he was sitting in seat Draco had just vacated. Draco spread Harry’s legs and knelt in-between them, resting on the cushion Harry had brought over. Harry eagerly opened the jar of oil and getting a small amount onto his fingers preened Draco’s pure white wings. Taking his time to make sure each feather got individual attention and care. Draco had his arms wrapped around Harry’s hips and was crooning happily, giving his mate a long hug in return.
He went through the dossier on all the potential candidates for the next Minister of Magic. Tom had no desire to be the figurehead for the British Wixen. He was far more interested in being the power behind the throne. After all, Kings and Queens changed all the time, the power that would stay the same for centuries if done right.
“OOO, he needs some fattening up. I cook him something special.” Molly said. There were other mutters and remarks about his body he heard stuff like
“Is the situation with Harry worse than the exposer to dementors that Lucius is suffering through? I only have enough resources to rescue them one at a time. If you tell me yes, I’ll believe you and I will leave Lucius where he is for the moment and pull Harry out. Otherwise, I’m so sorry, but I’m going after Lucius and Harry will be the very next thing I promise. But he will have to wait.” Tom said calmly, ready to change his orders at the very first sign of Severus say so. Severus bowed his head and answered.
“So let’s stop being idiots,” Harry says. Any chance they had at going back to how they were (the way he really wants them to be, the way his whole body aches for) might be ruined but that doesn’t mean he can’t still have Draco in a different way. It doesn’t mean he has to have this Draco-shaped hole in his life forever.
Instead, Harry sucks it up and loses at chess, lets Hermione seat him next to Ginny and Luna for the wedding breakfast.
It stings. Draco brushes it off. He’s ruled out another possibility.
,” he says when they’re in the backseat once more, bloodied and breathless.
“Yeah. Well, I should-- bed.” He gestures behind him.
“Ow, what the hell? What was that for?”
“Ok.”
Over her shoulder, Weasley rolls his eyes and mouths
“Better?” he asks. Five minutes might have passed, or five years, Harry’s endorphin-stupid brain doesn’t know or care.
Just once, he manages to get to Potter in time, predict the right moment and push him out of the way, but all that achieves is both of them in the firing line and he lies there, breath stolen by the pain, feeling Potter shake under him as they bleed out together and it goes black and Draco wakes up back in the street in the snow. He doesn’t try that again.
. There’s every chance she’ll laugh in my face.”
,” Ginny instructs, sending a martini glass full of something orange and glittery over to him with such a wonky levitating charm that Harry thinks it best to resign himself to the role of guinea-pig with good grace and go and join them, if only to stop the floor from getting too sticky.
“Is he,” Potter starts to say. Draco can’t look at him, afraid that it’s not real, that he’s not really ok and that if he turns around Potter will be on the floor, bleeding. But he comes up behind Draco until he’s only a few inches away and they both look down at Dolohov’s twitching hand, his wand still clutched in it.
“Turn it up, for God’s sake,” she sighs, shooting an annoyed look at the ceiling. Seamus complies, thumbing the button until the sound of the TV is so loud it’s ringing in their ears. “Pair of bloody hypocrites.”
“Ok.” Draco’s whole body feels tired. “Alright. I’m going back to bed.”
you’re getting laid. Show him how annoying it is.” She mutters something else under her breath. Harry might catch the word
“Alright, Dolohov, you absolute
aside, staying here past when he should, alone with Draco, feels inadvisably hedonistic. It’s the same feeling he’d had when Draco kissed him at Teddy’s birthday (and that was the last time, over two years ago now, they’ve been very good, and Harry only thinks about it oh, every other night), that potent, selfish joy of breaking the rules, just a little.
Draco, to his downfall, has only just remembered that Ravenclaws can be quite as devious as Slytherins, when they really put their minds to it. He’s also just recalled why he doesn’t usually drink tequila, and both sudden remembrances explain why he’s currently losing solidly at cards to Lovegood.
It’s Christmas day, something Draco had almost forgotten until they’d brought round pathetic looking turkey slices just after noon. He’s quite glad they’re ready to leave, honestly. There’s something horribly depressing about the limp strands of tinsel strung up everywhere. The only thing worse than a hospital room is a hospital room trying not to look like one.
Then, a couple of days in, they hit some turbulence. Harry calls it that, because it’s the only thing he can compare it to, but in reality it’s much worse than anything he’s experienced on a plane, worse even than the nausea-inducing motion of lift-off had been. The shuttle has layers and layers of intricate charms built into it, regulating the oxygen and gravity and stability, but things are still rough for an hour or two and Harry ends up in the tiny bathroom off of Draco’s private bedroom, apologising in between bouts of emptying his stomach. Draco tells him gently not to be stupid, and sits there with him, the room so tiny that they’re squashed together, Draco’s head knocking into the sink.
Potter just looks at him. “I meant the other thing.”
It’s not logical, really. Potter’s already injured, so ending the time loop now won’t necessarily save him. But there’s still one thing Draco hasn’t tried, something so completely out of the ordinary that it might just work. And maybe it’s the head injury, or maybe he’s just getting really, stupidly desperate, but it might be worth a shot.
Harry huffs a noise, not quite a laugh, and Draco chases it, kissing the tail-end of it out of his mouth. He’s going very slowly, maybe because stretching Harry out magically isn’t an option, maybe because he assumes it’s been a while (it has; Harry hasn’t let anyone touch him for a long, long time). Maybe he just likes it as much as Harry does.
Draco looks down from where his eyes had unconsciously resumed their search for the lake in the darkness, his eyebrows raising.
It throws Draco, standing there, faced with the idea of a tiny baby Potter, one who’d probably learned to crawl along this floor and pull himself up on the bannister. From the outside, the place where the killing curse backfired is obvious, half of the roof caved in, but from in here it looks like a normal house. A little shabbier, a lot less grand than what Draco grew up in, but a home all the same. They probably had to keep a protective enchantment across the bottom stair to stop baby Potter trying to climb them.
He hadn’t intentionally given Malfoy the room next to his, it was the only one both free and habitable when he moved in, and the fact that Harry’s bed is pushed right up against the adjoining wall hadn’t mattered at all when the room was empty. These days he toys with the idea of moving it almost every night, but it’s summer and too hot to be shoving heavy furniture around and, anyway, he likes it where it is. He just doesn’t like being woken up at one in the morning because Malfoy’s decided to hell with anyone else’s sleeping schedules, he wants to have
Potter—
“Is it me or,” Harry starts as soon as he’s gone, unable to finish the sentence. Like, the guy is white but besides that it’s
It doesn’t really sink in that this is happening until Harry’s face to face with the rocket and then he remembers to be excited, the sensation hitting him all at once so that he has to bite back a laugh at the sheer wonder of the moment.
“No, I mean-- well, they take them places. Trips away from school. Or at least make them run around outside for a couple of hours a week.”
— he manages a throaty “
“Ok,” Potter says. “So.”
“Ok,” he says. “Friends,” and they shake hands like they’ve gone back in time and eleven-year-old Harry, standing in a train compartment on the first day of school, has been given the chance to make a different decision.
Potter sticks his tongue out, which is such a non-response that Draco has no comeback.
“Not to inflate your ego, but wow,” Harry says, after a minute or so, and Draco laughs, watching the way Harry’s thumb is stroking over the back of her hand. “Although next time I’d like to be able to see your face properly when you come.”
“What?”
It’s simply bad roommate etiquette, that’s all. Harry needs his sleep.
Draco starts to shove Pansy for that one but Pansy holds steady on her stool and shifts her weight so she’s propelling Draco in the other direction, saying, “Look, she’s on her own, go now, before the Gryffindors descend,” and Draco has no choice really but to stumble over there.
“This is really stupid,” says Harry, because it really fucking is. “I miss you.” He means to say
Malfoy’s eyebrows raise. “Hm. Interesting.”
, though, that history, and Harry doesn’t think he’d want to if you could.
“Guh,” Harry says, making Malfoy laugh hard enough that Harry’s still embarrassed about it an hour later, when they’ve said goodnight and are both in their respective beds.
“Hello,” he says on a sigh. He advances on Harry, climbing onto the bed on his knees. Harry resists the urge to scoot backwards away from him. “I thought we should have a chat, Potter. About things.”
"We will, sir. We are so sorry that you are in this situation." An officer said. The officers stood up and got ready to leave. "Mr Malfoy, are you coming?"
"That was the most adorable thing." Draco whispered.
"Draco?" A smooth, deep voice called out.
"Thanks." Harry rubbed his hand behind his neck. "So do you two. You both look stunning."
"We won't stop searching and the case will be open until we find him but the searches are going to be less frequent. The reason for this is that no new leads have come up and we don't know exactly where to search next. Harry could easily be in a different country but we can't start searching abroad until we have evidence that he is in another country or he has been taken out of this country." Kingsley said. He wasn't meeting anyone's eyes, as if he was scared to see betrayal in their eyes.
"Where's Seamus?" Kingsley asked no-one in particular.
"Well, I was just walking around town and I saw you and uh, wanted to say hi?" The last part sounding more like a question.
Draco woke to the sound of his alarm. Bloody hell, he hated that alarm. He opened his eyes but immediately closing them after the light literally blinded him. He stretched his arms above his head and flopped one to the other side of the bed. The impact of arm on sheets surprised Draco and he opened his eyes. He looked over to the vacant space on the bed and sat up.
"I'm gonna go aswell." Ron gave everyone a quick hug. "Don't be surprised of I wake you in the morning."
It was so much more and so much better than Harry ever could have imagined.
"I'm sorry. I'll get you another drink."
"I love you too." Harry snuggled close to Draco. "It's late, let's go to sleep."
"We only have lemon flavour."
"No, baby. I'm sorry. I shouldn't have thrown such a fit about a tree. You're right, it won't be Christmas without a proper tree so we'll go out and get one now."
"Harry, are you okay?!" Neville asked.
Lift or stairs? Lift or stairs?
"Seamus?"
"Oh, yeah?" Draco whispered, playfully.
Even though Draco's eyes were on the television, they knew that Harry was looking at them with those warm eyes. Draco felt like they were laid bare by Harry's eyes, and even though they had known each other since they were eleven, they felt almost completely defenceless in the face of Harry's genuine smile. The vulnerability and affection made their chest warm and Harry reached out and gently ran his fingers along the side of Draco's face.
As soon as the clock hit ten, Draco was up and ready to go.
Draco sat down on the sofa and out his hand to his head. What was so bad about not wanting to wear a Christmas jumper? There's too much colour on them, they're so bright and it's like they demand attention. Draco got interrupted from his thoughts when the door opened quietly.
"What can I do for you Mr. Potter and Mr.Malfoy?" McGonagall asked.
"Harry."
"Hey." Draco smiled back at Harry.
Harry put on his bow tie before looking at himself in the mirror. He was wearing his finest dress robes. They were jet black, paired with a crisp white shirt and a black bow tie. Harry thought he looked pretty good, the robes were tailored perfectly to him, his face, somewhat miraculously, hadn't broken out with spots and his hair was-
"I knew that, I was just uh... testing you?" Harry said, the last part sounding more like a question.
When they had finished doing that, Draco set the Christmas pudding to steam. He lounged around for the rest of the day, filling the pot up with water when needed. By the time the pudding had finished steaming, Draco was ready to go to bed. He hadn't started making it until mid afternoon so it was quite late by the time it was cooked. Draco got ready for bed and jumped in next to Harry who had gone up around half an hour earlier.
Draco went on to show Harry all the notes. At first, Harry was awful, he pressed all the wrong keys and created a horrendous sound but by the end Harry had kind of got it. It went extra messy when he tried to add in the left hand. The two spent hours at the piano. It was one of the most magical things Harry had ever experienced; he was there with the boy he loved and they were having fun. They didn't have to worry about getting caught by anyone. After listening to Draco play
"Oh, really?" Draco smirked.
"Shut up." Draco scowled. "I was just making sure I was getting the best makeup for mother and is it a crime to be happy because last time I checked, it wasn't."
Draco let his head fall back against the back of the sofa and pushed the thought of the promise out of his mind. Instead, he focused on Harry. His Harry who deserved nothing but happiness. Draco wondered if Harry was alone, if the kidnapper had locked him in some room all by himself, leaving him with only himself or did the kidnapper go and see Harry. What would they do to Harry? Draco quickly pushed that thought away, he didn't want to think of anything the kidnapper could do to his Harry.
"What?"
Harry nodded and looked down at the floor. Draco swore they saw the tips of Harry's ears to pink. Draco's mouth twisted up into its famous smirk as an idea hit them. They grabbed Harry's hand, ignoring the way their stomach jumped as the pairs hands slotted together, and dragged him towards the fitting rooms.
"Dray, how long did you set the timer for?"
"Do you, Harry James Potter, take Draco Lucius Malfoy to be your lawfully wedded husband, promising to love and cherish, through joy and sorrow, sickness and health, and whatever challenges you may face, until death do you part?" The vicar asked.
Harry was everything Draco could ask for and more. He was kind and sweet, he constantly made Draco feel like they were on top of the world and better than everyone else and he accepted them, which Draco was more than thankful for. Right from the beginning, Draco had never face any judgment from Harry. Not when they told him they were non-binary, not when they had made Harry look at an outfit in a shop, not when other people gave them strange looks, not when Draco had asked Harry to paint their nails.
There were also times when Harry wouldn't eat, or rather couldn't. He sometimes refused to eat because he felt like he wasn't good enough to eat and sometimes he just couldn't eat because the memories affected too much. It broke Draco's heart to see Harry push away countless plates of food but Draco made sure Harry at least ate something, even if it just be half a slice of bread. It was better than nothing.
Draco spun his head. "What?"
"Ready." Draco stepped out of the bathroom wearing about 10 layers of clothes, his hat, scarf and two pairs of gloves.
"Jesus Christ, what?" Ron asked, exasperated.
Hermione wrapped her arms around Draco. "It's going to be okay." She whispers in his ear. "It's going to be okay."
Draco almost wanted to take a picture of it and frame it because Draco wanted to claim it as theirs. They knew they had no right to want to claim anything of Harry's as their own but everyone needed to be a little bit greedy now and again. Draco could hear their heart beating considerably faster than it normally did as they noticed Harry's soft smile as he observed what Draco was holding.
"Hurry up, we need to pick up your partner!" Ron yelled, not ceasing the banging.
"When I used to cook for the Dursley's." Draco saw Harry's face drop a little.
Harry looked up at the sky as church bells rang out. It was Christmas morning.
"It's not your fault. Don't ever say that it's your fault." Hermione said, sternly.
Harry silently nodded before smiling at Draco and carried on pulling them around the rink. The two skated around the rink for what felt like hours, basking in each others company. It felt so right, being next to Draco, making them smile and laugh that laugh that was so soft and gentle yet rang so clearly. Harry would never get sick of hearing that sound.
The two spent the rest of the day curled up on the sofa, opening presents from each other and sharing kisses and cuddles. It was one of the best Christmases Harry had ever had.
"Because it is itchy and tacky and it creates a mess and it's not elegant."
Draco wanted feverishly for Saturday to come, he was so excited that it seemed like time had slowed down just to mess with him. He decided he wasn't going to tell Harry that he was getting new makeup, he wanted it to be a surprise. He wanted to see Harry's reaction when he saw him with more makeup on. Draco loved how flustered Harry got when he wore makeup and how pink his cheeks and the tops of his ears got. Even though Harry had seen him with makeup on plenty of times, it was still like he was seeing it for the first time.
Harry smirked smugly as Ron didn't retaliate. Harry knew he was right, what part of being locked out of your apartment in minus three degree weather whilst it's snowing is character building? Trying to find new ways to break into your apartment because your roommate has forgotten or lost the key is not character building. Opening the door to find the key on the side after you've waited three hours for your landlord to let you in is not character building.
"I've always wanted to go to a roller rink." Draco tugged on Harry's hand, excitedly pulling him into the building. "Anyway, how is Neville doing? Has he got himself a partner? He and Luna always seemed to be close."
"Aw, it's Christmas Draco. You wouldn't hex me on Christmas, would you?"
"Of course, now go get your man." Pansy smirked and pointed towards Harry who was making his way across the hall to Draco. "By the way, tomorrow you are teaching me how you get your lips so perfect."
Draco didn't know what to say. Their mouth was open slightly and they could feel tears filling up their eyes. Is that really how Harry felt? Draco didn't even try to stop the tears as they fell down their cheeks, they wouldn't have been able to even if they tried. It was in that moment that Draco realised that Harry meant home.
"Twelve years of friendship, and you're okay with just throwing it all away?"
"Ready?" Harry asked, softly.
After he had recovered, Harry suddenly became a lot better at dressing himself appropriately after suffering a lot more coughing fits and being bed bound for a few days.
Harry usually didn't enjoy wearing suits, nor the events that called upon wearing a suit. He found the whole affair to be uncomfortable if he was being perfectly honest. He didn't like the stiff, starchy shirts that made him stand up right for the entirety of the time wearing it. He didn't like the slacks that were always either too big or too tight on him. He didn't like the hot heaviness of the blazer and he didn't like the feeling of a tie or bow tie around his neck.
"Shit! He's choking! Does anyone know the Heimlich Maneuver?" Ginny said.
"I know." Draco sipped their drink, nonchalantly.
"Not bad." Draco took another bite from the cookie, which admittedly, was actually quite nice. "You've improved. You'll be ready for the Great British Bake Off soon."
"Thanks mate, but Draco made dessert. He made a Christmas pudding."
"He's worth nothing. He's a dumb fag, just like you. He deserved every punishment." Vernon spat.
"Fair enough." Ron walked over to Harry and patted his shoulder. "I'll go out and get some ice cream."
"What's that really nice chocolate you bring home sometimes?"
"Is he going to be alright?" Draco asked.
"Please just say it." Hermione whispered.
It also calmed himself when he did this. It reminded Draco that he had the love of his life next to him and he was always at home when he was with Harry.
"Is that a cover up for 'I want to have sex'?" Harry asked, smirking.
"Everything about this is frustrating. Nothing could have prepared us for this. I'm going to be honest, I thought this would be like what it is in TV shows. He'd be missing for a couple of days and then we'd find him, but no." Ron said.
"I actually can't wait." Harry said, excitedly.
Draco could hear and feel this photo. He could hear Harry's laugh so clearly as it flew away with the perfect noise of everything else. He could feel the wind as it whipped past his body but most importantly, he could feel Harry's gaze. He could feel the warm, fuzzy sensation he got whenever Harry looked at him like that, his eyes full of love and happiness. It was so obvious to anyone who saw this photo that Harry was filled entirely with love and happiness. The way the photo captured the glint in his eyes and the dimples in his cheek was just perfect.
"Whatever."
A small whimpering sound escaped Draco's throat as they found it difficult to breath. Their whole body was heaving with effort to try and take a breath between the coughs. They could hear their blood passing through their ears in deafening thumps and as soon as their coughs began to slow down, they dug the palms of their hands into their ears.
"Only one of the best rom-coms you will ever see."
"I love you." Draco whispered before capturing Harry's lips into a kiss.
"Mother, this is huge. What is it?"
"Uh, Harry. Can I talk to you for a moment?" Draco asked as he jogged to catch up with the trio after DADA.
i will be topping you tomorrow
Draco pulled open the box and saw a face he would recognise anywhere. Draco immediately went to hug the man in front of him, inhaling the familiar scent, finally getting the touch he had been craving.
"Oh no, no, no. No tinsel on the tree or anywhere else in this house." Draco said.
"No. We have to keep looking." Draco said, his voice breaking slightly,
Draco wondered if Harry remembered what was today. He probably did seeing as every year, Harry got so excited for this day but Draco wondered if the kidnapper had done things to make Harry to forget what was today. He wondered if Harry was even alive to remember today.
Draco took Harry's hand in his and relished in the familiar feeling. The roughness of his hands, the warmth and the way their hands fit perfectly together, like a jigsaw. Draco began to rub small circles with his thumb on Harry's hand, he always did this to calm Harry.
"And you think I care?" Harry gave Ron a pointed stare as he slipped his shoes on. "Right, ready to go?"
This was becoming more than just annoying, it was goddamn frustrating. Why couldn't Ron get it through his head that Harry didn't want to talk about who he was going with to the Christmas ball? Harry glanced over to Hermione, silently begging she come and rescue him for this situation before he did or said something he regretted. He received a smirk and that fucking look in her eyes as a response.
"Yes!" Harry gave Draco a hug. "Let's go get the stuff."
Harry finally felt like he belonged.
"What?" Both Hermione and Draco exclaimed, whilst turning their heads to look at Ron.
"It's basically liquid chocolate. Starbucks do this really nice one at Christmas, salted caramel brownie hit chocolate." Harry explained.
"Okay, thank you." Draco finally felt at ease, his Harry was going to be okay.
"What are you doing here?" Draco asked. Tears rolling down his face from how happy he was.
Draco leant forwards, carefully running the lipstick across their top and bottom lips. It felt soft and velvety against their lips, gliding over them with ease. Draco pressed their lips together and let them go, with a small 'pop' sound. The red looked stunning with the outfit, striking in its own way. Draco's cheeks flushed as they realised just how pretty they looked. They plumped and pouted their lips absentmindedly and played with their hair so it fell to one side. Draco smirked at themselves, before smiling softly, appreciating how much they loved the outfit.
"What?" Kingsley's face wore an expression of shock and horror. "Merlin, are you sure?"
They pulled the top over their head and did the same with the dress. Draco fiddled with the straps for a moment before stepping back and looking in the mirror. The black denim fell a couple of centimetres above their knee and was cinched in at the waist, showing off their figure. The black was a stark contrast to their pale skin, dark and bold. The top fit perfectly, snug and comfortable against Draco's arms and torso.
"Well, at least we can travel anywhere we want in seconds."
Draco watched as everyone's eyes went wide and a couple of mouths formed an 'o' shape. Draco began to laugh bitterly at the sheer ridiculousness of the situation.
"Oh, he called me this morning and said he had a dentist appointment." Dean said.
All of it began to pile up over time. The self-hatred, the self-doubt, the insecurities, the previous emotional abuse from their father and one day, Draco couldn't hold it back anymore. The afternoon during his seventh year when it all came out was something that Draco had mixed emotions upon, but what mattered is that Draco finished the day feeling so much better about themselves.
"You know Harry would never walk off, no matter how drunk he was and besides, he would've stumbled across a phone or shop by now and he would've been found." Draco said.
"Not bad, Potter." Draco said.
"Yeah, see you."
"Okay...," Harry said, a bit uncertain as to what exactly a Colorado Blue Spruce was.
Harry grabbed Draco's hand as they headed towards the field where the reunion would be held. Harry swung their hands happily between them as a sense of nostalgia washed over him. A pleasant sense of familiarity and home lingered in the air as Harry took in the sights that were the setting of his teenage years.
"Black and white go together, just like us."
"Two things, one, you are acting way too happy right now for you to be the real Draco and two, you literally just spent two hours inside a makeup shop. So, who the fuck are you and what have you done with Draco?"
"Ron? Ron? Ron!"
Draco walked through the door and found the vet sitting at her computer.
Three months ago, Harry was told to be careful. He was told that it was very dangerous. He was told that it was going to be very difficult.
"No you don't."
"That was cute." Draco said. "Carry on, I want to watch the rest of them."
"Oh, yeah. Cool, yeah." Harry said, awkwardly. He wasn't really expecting that reaction from Ron, he was almost expecting Ron to freak out because he and Draco had never exactly been the best of friends.
The two filled the air with their usual jokes as they walked to Draco's apartment. Harry was insanely excited to see Draco in the dress. Actually, Harry thought, he was more excited to see how Draco felt wearing the dress. Harry longed to see the sparkle in Draco's eyes when they were truly happy.
Draco pulled Harry into a hug. Draco gently flicked his wand and some beautiful classical music began to play softly through the air.
Both boys were destroying themselves with their own thoughts.
Why would anyone love them? They wore skirts and dresses, they painted their nails and wore make up. Draco scoffed bitterly to themselves, they did all of those things yet society would never perceive them as anything but a boy. Draco couldn't help but think it was pointless, who were they even doing it for anyway? Themselves? No, they didn't deserve that much.
Almost. Not quite.
"I'll just ask someone."
"Why'd you stop? I was enjoying that." Draco whispered.
One of Harry's favourite coffee shops was Starbucks. Yes, it was overpriced, yes, it was always busy, yes, it was so basic but he loved it. Harry had taken Draco into a Starbucks once but it didn't go very well. It was discovered that day that Draco hated coffee. And when I say hated, I mean hated.
"Can't say the same here. Pansy is about as straight as a u-turn but Belle is straight. Pans is actually also on a date tonight."
Draco sighed before pushing back their hair so Harry could see behind their ear. Harry got closer and squinted, trying to make out the design, eyes widening when he saw what it was.
"Hey, hey, hey. It's going to be okay. He's going to be okay. He's Harry freaking Potter and he can get through anything." Hermione comforted Draco and brought him into a hug.
Their hair fell loose in front of their face in small waves which framed their face perfectly. Their lips had been carefully painted with a sheer gloss and there was a light pink dusted subtly across their eyelids. Their eyes were captured perfectly by sharp, black eyeliner and their lashed were long and thick. Their cheekbones shimmered with a bright white colour when their face hit the sun right. Draco came to a stop in front of Harry and smiled as they waited for him to say something.
"You're perfect Draco. For finding him and bringing home, this is honestly the best Christmas present ever. Thank you so much." Harry leant forward and gave Draco a kiss, being careful that he didn't squash Bud.
Who does
"You, uh, you started scratching your chest and said you couldn't take it anymore and you wanted it to stop." Hermione explained, her voice shaking.
"Yeah, just like Hermione's preference was to go on a date with that girl instead of hanging out with you tonight." Harry retaliated, fumbling in his pockets for his keys before Ron chucked them at him.
"This is fucked up." Harry said. "I don't wanna snog this git."
Draco jumped up from the sofa and ran out of the room. He had been waiting to do this tomorrow, when it was their anniversary but Draco thought that now seemed like the perfect time to do it. He rifled through his sock drawer, smiling when he found what he was looking for and immediately ran back downstairs.
The receptionist looked up and saw the state of Draco and Hermione. "Well, he's just come out of a meeting so if you're quick, he should have about ten minutes to talk."
Draco just glared at Harry.
"Come here." Draco beckoned Harry over to a window. "See those clouds?"
"Draco, I've called Ginny, Luna, Neville, Dean, Seamus, Pansy, Blaise, everyone and they all said he's not with them." Hermione said, running her hands through her hair.
"What?" Draco smirked.
"Ron, do I look okay?" Harry asked, nervously biting his lip.
"Thank you." Harry pressed a quick kiss to Draco's nose before stepping into place.
Harry lightly slapped Draco's arm. "Oi, you're supposed to be on my side."
The grin that broke out across his face was something Harry couldn't contain as he grabbed Draco's hand and walked around the corner, finding Ron leant up against the wall scrolling through his phone. Ron glanced up at the pair and said a quick hello to Draco before the three set off to Hermione's apartment.
Draco sat up and slid the bracelet back onto his wrist. He stumbled to the door and opened it to reveal a very worried looking Hermione.
"Dray, we don't have a dog, why have you got all this?" Harry asked, extremely confused.
He passed the eyeliners first. Draco knew he didn't need a new eyeliner but having an extra one wouldn't hurt. He scanned the eyeliners, trying to find the same one he already had. He didn't want to use a different brand when the one he used already was so good, he eventually found a tube right in the corner of the display and smiled as he put it in his basket.
"Of course I did. I haven't seen you all day, thought you might've been ill." Harry replied.
"I promise." Harry was still confused as to what was happening.
Harry obeyed and continued playing the adverts. By the end of the 2015 advert, The Man on the Moon, Draco was practically sobbing.
"Okay, thank you so much." Draco picked up Bud who was starting to fall asleep and wrapped him up in his scarf again.
"Don't thank me. I just did what every friend should." Hermione squeezed Draco one last time before she let go and ran over to the others to update them.
"You may." Draco giggled whilst taking Harry's hand.
Harry felt quite proud, he had made it through half of dinner and he hadn't looked up from his plate and he was beginning to relax more. Harry realised that he'd messed up when Hermione asked him a question and he looked up and immediately made eye contact with Malfoy. Holy shit, his eyes were pretty, Harry struggled to look away.
"Do you think it's gonna snow?" Harry asked.
"Everyone is the same." Luna said, everyone turned their heads towards her, expecting her to elaborate. "We all feel the same. We're not fine, none of us are alright but we're holding up the best we can. We all want him home."
"Merry Christmas guys." Harry smiled as he gave everyone a hug.
"Sounds good." Draco said, trying to contain the excitement in his voice.
"Yeah, Harry. You've got people all over you." Neville said.
"Draco, the invitation says festive. That means Christmas jumper, everyone will be wearing one."
Draco cradled Harry closer to his chest as he stood up and ran out of the hut. All he cared about right now was getting Harry to the hospital and out of this hell hole. Draco was going to fucking kill Seamus.
"Go away." Draco mumbled, knowing full well the person behind the door wouldn't have heard him.
"I want to get there before it gets too busy. I don't want other people's sweaty bodies pressed against me." Draco said. What he said was true, he just didn't mention the fact that he was also in a rush because he was desperate to try out some new makeup.
No one else could ever compare to Harry.
"Sure buddy, you keep telling yourself that." Harry stood up and ruffled Ron's hair earning a slap on the arm. "Rude. Anyway, to answer your earlier question, probably 2:15 to get to 'Mione's for 2:30. That gives us enough time either way."
tw: brief mention of self-harm
"Alright, calm down. I'll be out in a second."
Harry was starting to give up at this point. He didn't understand why Draco didn't want to embrace the festivity.
"You ready?" Ron asked.
Draco had just gotten back from an interview with the ministry. Each interview became harder and harder to get through. Draco pushed open his apartment door.
"Okay, Silent Night is pretty simple." Draco said.
she said its not because of what i wear or any of that shit but the aura i give off??
"Lovely. If you could just take a seat and someone will be with you soon."
"Sor-,"
Ron, Hermione, Draco and Molly sat and had a cup of tea and talked everything over before Draco and Hermione left for the police station. Draco was still hesitant in letting the muggle police get involved but he knew it was best.
"Stop giving me puppy eyes." Harry chuckled as he plopped back down on the sofa and began sorting through the takeout bag. "Give me a second, okay?"
"Please, tell me why he deserves punishment and he deserves to be kidnapped. Is it because he did everything you asked for sixteen years? Is it because he sat through the abuse? Is it because he never disrespected you or talked badly to you? Is it because he saved the world? Harry deserves nothing but happiness. He deserves all the happiness in the world. Harry deserves the fucking world and everyone can see it but him and that's all your fault. You're all sitting here, going about your lives knowing that you've destroyed a person, how the fuck do you do that?" Draco shouted.
Draco just let out a breath of amusement before leaning down and pressing a kiss to Harry's lips causing him to break out into a smile despite wanting to maintain the angry façade.
Draco turned and looked at Harry. "I have everything I ever wished for right in front of me."
"You wish!"
"You're the only girl who can keep up with me." Draco replied.
Draco picked up his phone and rang Hermione. After what seemed like years, Hermione finally picked up.
"And just what do you think you're doing?" Draco asked.
"I take it you like it then?" Harry chuckled, resting his hand against Draco's cheek.
They stepped into the fitting room, taking another glance at Harry before shutting the curtain and placing their head in their hands. Draco resisted the urge to squeal and they looked up at the mirror. They were smiling like an idiot and a gentle pink colour was dusted across their cheeks.
It was the night of the ball and to say Harry was freaking out was an understatement. He hadn't been able to eat breakfast or dinner because with all the butterflies in his stomach and his head buzzing, there was no way on Earth he'd swallow a bite, yet alone a whole plate.

Draco pressed a kiss to Harry's lips. "I'm sorry. I love you."
Both Harry and Draco had big smiles on their faces by the end of the advert.
"Plus you're an ugly cryer." Pansy added, smirking.
"Yeah, yeah. I'm fine." That was a lie. Draco was anything but fine. Draco muttered Hermione and Ron's address. "Can you get there as quickly as possible please."
"Harry. I am a little bit annoyed at you. I told you to wear more layers but you didn't and now I have to put up with an ill you, which is not fun for me." Draco ranted.
Draco refocused on the fact that Harry could be all alone right now. Harry hated being alone for long periods of time, he got really scared and anxious, his thoughts became too big and he often had flashbacks to when the Dursley's locked him in the cupboard under the stairs for days on end. Harry had told Draco the reason he was so scared was because he was scared someone would find him and hurt him, like the Dursley's did. Draco can remember his heart breaking when Harry told him this and he remembers holding Harry close to him and telling him 'I'll never leave you alone'.
"Yes you are."
"Can I have their full name, age and when they were last seen please."
"That was so good. Merlin. Why didn't you introduce these to me earlier?" Draco wiped the tears falling from his face.
Fuck, they were a death eater. They were a part of the group that nearly destroyed the entire wizarding world. Why they weren't rotting away in a cell in Azkaban was beyond them sometimes.
"I mean, I always thought they'd be good together." Draco shrugged. "Come on, I wanna roller skate."
"It's our anniversary today." Draco said, quietly.
"Why haven't you been answering anyone calls or texts? We've been really worried about you." Hermione asked.
Harry stood there, tears rolling down his face. The boy he loved loved him back. He didn't realise he had been silent for almost a minute now.
"I could say the same." Harry's eyes flicked up and down Draco again. "You look good, by the way."
"This is officially the best Christmas dinner I've ever had." Pansy smiled.
"You locked him in a tiny cupboard for sixteen years. You beat him every single day. You cut him, you punched him, you kicked him, you knocked him unconscious, you scarred him. You raped and sexually abused him for no reason except for your own sadistic ways. You constantly told him he wasn't good enough, that no one would ever love him. You even convinced him that it was his own fault that his parents died. You caused his depression, his anxiety, his PTSD. You caused him to self-harm, you caused him to almost commit suicide because he was terrified to return to this house. He was scared he wasn't good enough, he was scared he was going to mess up, he was scared that every summer would be worse than the last. You caused him to have anorexia at one point. He couldn't eat in fear that you were going to make him throw it up again and tell him that he's not good enough to eat. You caused him to be terrified anytime he dropped something or messed up a spell or potion. Did you know he lived on the streets the summer he ran away because he was too scared that someone would take advantage of him or he'd be refused help? Harry still suffers today, he has nightmares, panic attacks, flashbacks. He still can't eat sometimes and he still self-harms sometimes. You physically and emotionally destroyed an innocent child and you're telling me that he deserves punishment? That he deserves to be kidnapped?" Draco yelled.
in sixth year?”
“Ooh, are we making fun of Draco again?” Blaise said as he pops out of nowhere and grabs Draco’s shoulders from behind. Draco stops himself just in time from yelling in surprise.
“Ah, he’s back with us. Anyways, Harry, Ron and I were trying to figure out what to order.”
“Do you think I should become a male escort?” Hermione says.
“ But she’s a Slytherin!”
“Actually, no, taking Love Potions off really was a horrible mistake.”
Their break-up had been mutually agreed upon. Ginny hated the 'blandness of a long-term relationship,' and Harry refused to tie her down like that, even though she’d said she would be perfectly happy being his beard. Besides, in the spirit of Gryffindorness, Harry would rather not hide his sexuality away like that.
Harry walks to the desk and picks up this week’s issue of the Daily Prophet, which is currently being used to press flowers. He carefully shakes them out - bluebells, a flattened foxglove - and flips to the society pages.
“I want sushi.”
Thanks for reading!
“Yes, Harry, open a newspaper! Oh. I’m sorry. That was insensitive.”
“Ha! ‘Mione, you’ve been outnumbered.”
The next day, Draco, along with everyone else, gawks at Harry.
“I’ll get it!” Harry ducks out of Hermione and Ron’s bright, airy,
The trouble was, Harry thought as he stared at the morning sunlight creeping across his bed, Malfoy hadn’t done anything wrong. Oh sure, as a frightened teenager he had done plenty. And yesterday he’d laughed at Harry for five full minutes while he tried to find his glasses, and then frantically Disapparated as soon as Harry could see again. And he was still a classist excuse of a human being. Probably still hated Muggles and was only in the band for- for god knows why. The exact sort of person Harry would always save a bit of his contempt for. But somehow, Harry couldn’t bring himself to dislike him. Or even to hate him.
They haven’t made much progress, what with Harry’s shenanigans and a couple other players who also seem to be complete novices. Draco drifts away to a corner of the room as the other witches and wizards begin to pack up and chat. He kneels on the carpet to dissemble his flute. He’s just shut the clasps of the case, making satisfyingly loud clicks, when Potter looms up in front of him, still wearing the stupid glasses.
She’s already hung up.
“We so were.”
In which the Savior of the Wizarding World takes personal offence to furniture.
“They outed you to the entire Wizarding public, though. I still feel like there should have been consequences for that.”
“In fact, I- What? Why would I do that?”
Harry sputters in rage and gropes blindly for his wand. This was going to be a long month.
(See the end of the chapter for
“No.”
Harry tries to avoid looking at the coffee table but it’s no use. And he’s happy for them, he really is, why wouldn’t he be happy for them, they’re his best friends? Harry looks up just as Ron abandons the argument and steals a kiss instead, chastely pecking Hermione’s cheek, and she glances back at him with such a look of fondness that Harry thinks he’ll explode. Clean and perfect. Harry resists the urge to kick at the coffee table.
"now i'm imagining drarry marching band aus and i know EXACTLY how it'd go
“Please make sure to keep practicing your respective parts. We’ll begin outside next Monday.”
Harry looks at him for a long second, his eyes strangely blank, or strangely full, Draco can’t tell which, then turns away.
"AHAHAHHAHA
“Only fifteen hours of moping per week. You’ve already been through seven, if I recall correctly.”
“Oh my god, do you remember her room? The fluffy pink walls? The tassels? The rhinestones?”
It was all Hermione’s fault, when it came down to it, her fault for convincing him “a bit of fresh air would do him good” and “learning something new is just what he needed to get out of this funk.” Hermione’s fault that he had to spend hours with sodding Malfoy of all people.
“Keep that up and I’ll tell Blaise about the Omnioculars.”
Ginny laughs at him for at least a full minute, almost falling through the fireplace at one point.
“Me? Didn’t you take orders from
“Oh, Harry.” Her voice drips with sympathy, and Harry genuinely cannot tell if it’s mocking or not. “Anyways, get me Pansy’s address, thank you so much! I love you! Bye!”
“Merlin’s sake, Pansy, shut up, nobody cares if you say ‘oh my god’ or not,”
and said, “Oh, I simply required a change of pace,” flapping his hand around like it was every day that former Death Eaters went around joining marching bands for Muggle charity. Then, Malfoy had glanced at the instrument case Harry was still mindlessly holding in his shocked confusion.
“Oh, but that’s part of the allure, isn’t it?” she says, leaning further into the flames and batting her eyelashes at him.
“That-”
“Apologize!”
may have been a little too honest. Merlin, he’s losing it. He shuts his eyes.
“...what?”
”) And worst of all: (“Still wearing prescription sunglasses, Potter? How charming.”)
, perhaps?”
“Don’t have to do
"Harry," Hermione says, conducting baton still in hand, "why are you wearing sunglasses at an indoor rehearsal? Can you even see the music?"
“Am I really that bad?”
He’s jealous of Ginny. It always seems to be so easy for her. Or maybe she’s just more unashamedly Gryffindor than he’ll ever be. But God, did she know how to get things from people. He briefly wonders if she would’ve done just as well in Slytherin.
become male escorts?” Harry asks.
Kudos and comments (?) are highly appreciated! Thank you for reading.
“Harry!” she manages to get out, “Draco Malfoy! Homophobic!” and she starts laughing again. “There’s a Prophet article every other week about which influential wizard Draco’s been gallivanting around with! Harry! He’s
“Who are you after this time, Ginny.”
“Remember what we said, Draco?” a patronizing voice drawls out suddenly.
Harry stares back at him, evidently just as confused, even though
“Well, yes I did- Wait. You were there too!”
for Hermione and Ron. He returns to following their conversation.
Harry shakes himself out of it. An admittedly bitter internal rant. But it’s just because of the coffee table. That’s all. That bloody coffee table. The thing inspires true vitriol in him, it just looks so disgustingly smug, what with its stubby little wooden legs and its
eighth notes! How are you not capable of that?”
Malfoy removes a shrunken rectangle from his jacket pocket, which expands into a case when he taps it twice. He opens it, snapping the clasps louder than necessary, Harry suspects, for some kind of dramatic effect, then lifts out a flute. Harry watches his fingers as he fits the pieces of the flute together with care, as if the silver of the instrument is something sacred, venerable. And yes, his flute is undeniably elegant, to Harry’s annoyance. Draco raises it to his mouth, resting his fingers against the keys. Then he turns to look right at Harry, extends his arm so that the end of his flute almost touches Harry’s ear, and with a practiced movement flips Harry’s glasses off his face.
Draco stares at him for a second.
His alarm went off. Harry dragged himself out of bed, ran a comb through his hair, and slouched his way through the dusty sunlit hallways of 12 Grimmauld Place. He still hadn’t figured out how to bypass the wards, so he had to use the porch whenever he wanted to Apparate. He turned on his heel, felt the familiar crunch, and came out on the steps outside the music room. Second rehearsal.
“You’re apologizing?”
“I think you should stick around to practice for a bit. You’re just as bad as you were yesterday. I could give you a few pointers.”
“You play the trumpet? Rather an undignified instrument, I’ve always thought. It suits you perfectly.”
But none of it changes the fact that Harry has fumbled the trumpet run every single bloody time they rehearse, and it sounds as though he hasn’t tuned the bloody thing in months, even though Draco watched Ron help him with the tuning slide an hour ago. And if Draco has nothing else to say about Ron, the Weasley is surprisingly proficient with the instruments.
