Harry knew. It was all about his past and the loss the Weasleys' suffered because of him, no matter how indirectly or how small of a part he played in starting the war from the wrong side. After all these years, there still are people who condemn reformed children of Death Eaters and want them to be eliminated off the face of the Wizarding World. For a while, Harry believed that whoever followed Voldemort or even had such an intention was to be killed without a second thought. His mind then had been clouded with nothing but anger and unbridled hatred for those who hadn't been on Dumbledore's side during the war. It wasn't until much later when he saw the Weasleys helping a few innocent and orphaned children of Death Eaters in the camps the Ministry graciously yet thoughtlessly installed, Harry realized that maybe Death was too big of a punishment for being born into the family of a Death Eater. It wasn't their choice.
“I must eat, huh?” he chuckled but made no move to get up. He was too upset to fill his insides with anything but smoke.
“You imbecile!” Hermione screeched, much like their late Professor, Severus Snape. The reminder caused him to flinch involuntarily as he stood rooted to the ground.
“Your call,” Draco shrugged, fumes popping out of his mouth and nostrils as he spoke.
Malfoy sneered. Harry smiled in amusement.
This time, Harry didn’t ask him to say it again but rained down a shower of punches -
“Why?” Harry asked.
"Oh my God! Ron, help me here!" Hermione's shrill voice filled the room and seconds later, Ron and Hermione were pulling Harry away from a nearly passed out Draco. Harry was possibly satisfied with the work he did on his passive husband because he didn't protest when Ronald pulled him away and into the living room.
By the time Harry calmed down, Draco long finished his cigarette. Now the black haired main’s sobs turned into hiccups and Draco summoned a glass of water. The only positive thing that came out of this whole mess was his magic and he was ever so grateful for its return.
"I'll give you two choices and one minute, Harry. Choose well," Draco started.
"But -"
'How typical,' Draco thought.
“You tell me; since you’re so keen on taking MY decisions too,” Draco snorted.
"Bad?" Harry asked, looking sideways at Hermione. "How bad?"
Harry wondered.
Fortunately, he was saved answering with the arrival of the person of the day, Rose Granger-Weasley. One look at the miniature human bundled up in a fluffy white blanket just wasn’t enough to describe how monumental her presence seemed in the room. Even from the distance, Draco could see wisps of ginger hair strewn about on the baby’s head and without meaning to, he smiled. Rose kept cooing and sputtering saliva onto her chin in her attempt to smile at every person present in the room. When the Healer (Eastoft, Draco presumed) handed Rose to Granger, Harry shifted away so that Ronald could take his place beside his wife. Ronald held out his index for the baby and she curled her itsy-bitsy fingers around it and brought the finger down to her mouth. The room filled with wholesome laughter and Draco would swear anytime in the future that Ronald Weasley was the biggest baby as he sat there crying profusely while his little baby slurped happily on his finger.
“I came to apologize for everything,” she said when Draco didn't respond, sipping her drink.
“Calm down, mate. You didn’t kill him, Harry. He’s all right. ‘Mione healed him, okay?” Ron said soothingly yet his heart pained miserably trying to take in Harry’s grief. Why had they left him alone after the war? If only they didn’t believe when Harry had told he was all sunshine and roses… If only they could’ve gotten him help sooner… His mind was barraged with many such possibilities but he knew that none of them would be of any use now. The time when Harry really needed them in his life was long gone. They weren’t there for him and partly, Ron blamed himself and ‘Mione for ignoring Harry in the name of recovery.
“Neither of us will be going anywhere, Draco. It’s time we ended this tug of war. You need answers and I’m ready to give them to you. Honest. But let me say this first. If you think you’ve suffered, I’ve suffered heaps too. We are still suffering.”
“I haven’t got anywhere to go to. Ron and ‘Mione, they’re all I have left.”
The next morning, when he woke up, Harry was not in their room anymore but left him Draco’s old wand on the bed beside him with no note. And, Draco understood. He was alone in this and he decided stubbornly that he would live through it without Harry’s help.
“No, I’m not! Just leave me alone!” his struggle renewed and this time, he felt more hands on him.
And for the first time, Arya Reynolds had finally broached the topic of Draco Malfoy on the day before.
“Have you flown recently?” this time, the Healer wasn’t looking at Harry but was glancing sideways through the notes her quill had been writing down, hovering a few inches away from her head but still in her line of sight.
“I will be once you lot leave or let me leave,” his voice sounded so vacated from hope to Hermione’s ears that she frowned in annoyance at the situation. This wasn’t how it’s supposed to be. She never questioned Harry’s decision when he up and resolved to bring Draco Malfoy home by marrying him. Whatever he wanted to do in his life was up to him. Though she had been skeptical, upon watching Harry’s behavior change after Draco entered his life, she felt that for once, her best friend had chosen wisely. Yet, she failed drastically to see that Harry was amiss all the time and he had only gotten worse over time.
Please do leave Kudos! Or a comment, if you wish.
For a few minutes, Harry was left speechless as he tried to process the fact that the Healer had been completely thorough with his tests. It wasn't the Healer's fault. His child was dead. No, it had been ruthlessly murdered by its own Father who refused to carry it and nurture it. Harry took in a deep breath, trying to stop the onslaught of tears.
The horror of getting raped by the Chosen One almost brought tears to Draco’s eyes. But he wouldn’t cry. He would fight or die trying but he wouldn’t let this deviant take advantage of him.
“Maybe, I do. Does it matter though? You know
“I was wrong to spike your drinks. All I wanted was a family of my own,” Harry said.
He watched Harry cough and the tears contained in his eyes spilled down and landed on Draco’s clothed chest. Sighing exasperatedly at Harry’s attempt, Draco took the bud back, inhaled it slowly, savoring the bitterness that filled him yet again. Before he could blow out the smoke, Harry caught his face by his chin, lifted it up an inch and pressed their lips together. The kiss they shared was sinuous at best as Draco reluctantly opened his mouth to Harry’s tongue which tried to lick the smoke off of every nook and corner of Draco’s cavern. Harry’s spectacles, which he gifted, poked him uncomfortably on the forehead but that didn’t matter. Harry’s presence, as he always knew, was better than Nicotine. He didn’t care that the saliva they shared dribbled down their chins, which was extremely dirty. Nor did it bother him that Harry’s nails were digging painfully into his chest through his shirt. All he needed was Harry to consume him like he always did. Let his heart shatter some more with every pleasantly horrifying kiss and burning touch. Let his mind go numb with agony so powerful that his every thought would scream for Harry alone. Even after the taste of smoke was washed away, they didn’t stop kissing. Only when Draco felt wetness on his cheeks which he was sure that it wasn’t saliva, he broke the kiss.
Shocked for a brief moment, the cigarette bud between Draco’s fingers never quite made it to his lips.
“I’m sorry, Draco. I’m so goddamn sorry,” Harry hugged the man and Draco let him. For the first time, Harry felt Draco’s arms wound around him in a gentle but desperate embrace as the blonde cried into Harry’s chest, letting out all his held back anguish until that point in his life. It was so unbecoming of a Malfoy but then again, Harry reminded himself, Draco was no Malfoy anymore and he was allowed to cry like any other normal human being. It had always been the other way round. Draco held him but never held onto him. There would always be times when the ones pretending to be strong would break down. It was Harry's fault that he couldn't control his actions and no amount of apologies could ever make things right or could turn back the time. He could only wish for forgiveness as he said sorry over and over again until Draco found it in him to forgive and maybe, forget too.
Malfoy knew that he was behaving like a lowlife by bringing Potter’s dead parents into this but he couldn’t help it. He was sure that Potter would only understand his pain if he took that dingy road. Yet, to his dismay, Potter didn’t walk that road.
Yet when the knife vanished from the underside of his chin and his survival instincts kicked in yet again, Draco couldn't help but fight Harry again to the best of his abilities. He prided himself for landing a rather hard kick in Harry's stomach and the man fell over backward. Now, if only Draco could get away from this mad prick... He scrambled a few inches away but once again, when Harry's hands clamped down on his foot and pulled him back to where he was a few minutes ago, Draco somehow knew that he wouldn't get out of his predicament alive. Harry Potter was going to KILL him tonight and there was no one to stop him from doing so.
“You can’t keep hurting yourself like this,” this time, Harry’s voice was just a tired plea.
Draco ignored Ronald and glanced at Harry. He didn't want to wake him up but didn't want to spoil Harry's day by not celebrating his birthday. Draco had celebrated his own birthday alone and Harry didn't even know. Nobody knew except him and he stood by the floor to ceiling window, staring down at the fields and up at the sky, replaying his past birthdays when his Mother would bake him a huge Belgian chocolate cake herself and his Father would give him his blessings and an expensive gift. That night, he wanted to tell Harry that it was his birthday as they ate dinner together but held himself back as it was useless anyway, according to him. Hence they had eaten in silence until they retired to their own rooms for the night.
“Draco?” he placed the same hand on Draco’s shoulder and tried to wake him up.
“I can’t! It’s too painful,” Hermione cried; fat tears of pain wetting her cheeks.
“You might not believe it but I Floo called my Mum and demanded her to tell me the truth. ‘Concentrate on your tournament, Ginny! Don’t lose focus!’ That’s what I got,” she chuckled humorlessly. “I was repeated the same words from Ron and Hermione. They said they were taking care of everything to the best of their abilities and not once did I doubt them. I should’ve! What was Harry thinking when he did that to you?! Without your consent! This is the lowest I’ve ever seen him and what could I even do? A punch could hardly hurt him; or a stinging hex for that matter,” Ginny’s voice edged on pure anger now.
“I don’t think it necessary to hit Draco. I just can’t help it, that’s all! I see him laughing and something in me snaps. Who gave him the right to smile like that when the people he killed could smile no more? Who gave him the right to live when he should be dead?!” his voice rose extremely high and Arya was pretty sure that the Weasleys heard every bit of what Harry uttered.
When the silence Harry left behind was broken by Sebastian hooting loudly, Draco opened his cage, gingerly picked him up, and let him out into the fresh air. As he watched his owl spread his wings and soar into the night sky, probably hunting for prey, Draco wished he were a bird too. He could just fly away and leave everything behind without bother. He needn’t think about Harry or what would become of them. At least, up there in the sky, he would have a life of his own choice instead of someone else doing that for him. He would be free from being a Malfoy, a Death Eater, and Harry Potter’s insane husband.
“Right, sorry. Stupid of me to ask that,” Ronald smiled sheepishly. “You can stay here, Draco. I’ll make sure that Harry doesn’t drop by and bother you.”
In his mind, it seemed as if the session wasn’t what he expected it to be. He thought they would be talking about the war, his anger, the people he lost, his baby, and the cruel way he hurt his husband, not about why he did or didn’t fly these days. He wasn’t there to learn to fly again but because he pounded his husband into oblivion and he wanted to be able to control his anger. Skeptical about the sessions, Harry decided to speak to Ron and Hermione about it later but for now, he decided to play along with the Healer.
“Say the word, Malfoy,” Harry repeated.
"You can take your suggestions and shove them up your arse," Harry muttered darkly before pushing his friends away and bursting into Draco's ward.
“Sorry,” Draco apologized under his breath.
“I almost killed him,” Harry whispered to himself.
- This chapter and its summary are titled after one of my favorite songs
She didn’t follow him. And, he was more than thankful for that.
Surprisingly, Harry complied and stepped aside for Draco through pass through. Assuming Harry was letting him go without a fight was the first mistake Draco had done that day for as soon as his back was facing his husband, Harry picked the opportunity to grab his wand arm and pull him back into the kitchen with abnormal force.
"I've relayed the information to your husband, Mr. Potter. Feel free to discuss the counseling sessions with him and let us know. I've prescribed some potions so that the uterus removal from Draco's body will be a bit less painful. His magic is still unbalanced. I suggest you stay close to him in the next six to seven weeks so that his magic can regain control using your core, and I suggest you calm down for that," the Healer said but Harry didn't hear anything. His mind was replaying the death of his child and his insides were rapidly filling with anger towards his husband, the one who killed his child; his chance at having a normal family; his chance at happiness.
Harry laced their fingers together and buried his face in Draco's neck, panting heavily as he felt his release close in on him. By the looks of it, Draco was close too.
That was the point of time where Draco broke character for possibly the third or fourth time in his entire life. The Malfoys’ indifference was so deeply ingrained into him that no matter what happened, he always kept his cool, kept his face. He lost it while carrying out the Dark Lord’s orders to kill Dumbledore and during the Dark Lord’s stay at his home, the Manor. He wanted to be saved but couldn’t find refuge anywhere until he was completely removed of such an opportunity by being thrown into the Azkaban. Harry hadn’t come to any of their trails. His Mother assured him during the dark lonely cramped nights after that Harry Potter would speak for them at least, if not for Lucius, and then they wouldn’t be sent to Azkaban. Yet when the day finally came, when the culprits were brought in for the Wizengamot to judge, the absence of Harry Potter weighed heavily on not only his Mother’s heart but also his’. When no help came from the Golden Boy even after years, Draco made peace that there was no escape and tried to be brave in the face of all his fears that the Azkaban dangled in front of his eyes even when he was asleep.
"Yeah, who would've guessed, right?" he asked, rejoining the others in merry.
'I deserve it. Please, stop now.' Draco's eyes rolled back into his head and he surmised that Harry's wrath would be something he took to his grave any moment now.
The rest was a blur to Draco. On the verge of tears of humiliation and contained rage, he signed wherever Harry told him to sign under the name ‘Draco Potter’ and not ‘Draco Lucius Malfoy’, all the while berating himself for choosing life over death. Yet, if given the choice again, he wouldn't have changed anything. That realization hurt him more.
“People don’t like labeling themselves as mad or broken in the head hence the general consensus is they decline to visit a Mind Healer. When they do, they try to lie their way out of questions. I can tell that you’re not one such person. You want to be healed, don’t you, Mr. Potter?”
. Right? He was free to leave. And, he will. It’s taken more energy than he possessed to dress up and visit St Mungo’s. For naught it was and completely blasphemous. Wasn’t at all like him. Then again,
"Who wants chocolate cookies?" Molly burst in with a tray full of chocolate biscuits and with lightning speed, Ron got up and grabbed the tray for himself, stuffing four biscuits into his mouth at once.
“What is it this time?” Draco rolled his eyes.
“Thank you, Mrs. Reynolds,” he said from the bottom of his heart.
“A bit peaky. She had to suffer but it was worth it in the end. I’m sure she feels the same,” Ron wiped his face with the back of his hand.
"Draco, this is a chance for both of us at a new life. Why can't you see how wonderful that would be? You, me, and our beautiful child!" Harry encircled a pale and unresponsive Draco with his arms.
“Oh, hello! We meant to be out of your way before you arrived, sorry.” My mother apologised. I rolled my eyes.
“Yeah,” I laughed shuffling awkwardly. “See ya, then.”
and tapped my nose with his index finger.
“It wasn’t a date, mother. I told you there were other people with us!”
“Why don’t you live with them now?” I asked tentatively, not wanting to overstep any boundaries. Harry frowned, walking a bit faster.
“You feel so nice,” I whispered. His skin was so soft under my hands, almost like silk, but also rougher in some areas, more manly. With one hand, I touched the hairs leading up from his crotch, which were coarse and felt amazing. I found myself wanting all his clothes off, wanting to see all of him. I could feel myself getting hard, and I had to look back into his eyes, biting my lip.
Patting his cheek lightly.
“You were bullied too?” He asked sadly. “But... But you’re so... Amazing.” I blushed, looking down at my feet.
“I could teach you.” I offered. He was so cute... I wanted to kiss him. Harry bit his lip and turned away suddenly.
“I don’t know what I’m meant to do, now.” He admitted.
Harry shook his head and let out a breath. “What if I don’t want her to?” He murmured.
“Ron. It’s fine,” Harry said, shaking his head slightly. Ron frowned, but stayed silent.
***************
“Ok.” He whispered.
“Yeah.” Seamus shrugged, and went to put the kettle on.
When Harry woke up the next morning, and stretched his body to find an empty bed, it took him a moment to remember to be angry about it. It was nice, really, the space. And the knowledge that there was no pressure to do anything, be the perfect person, because nobody was there. Of course, that only lasted for a few seconds, until he opened his eyes properly and remembered that he wasn’t pleased. He loved Ginny, and he thought she knew that, but she’d left anyway. There was absolutely nothing to be glad about.
It was November, and Harry was not in a back alley, not yet. He was sitting on his bed, in Grimmauld Place, where everyone had eventually started to live while they waited for the future to start. After the battle it had seemed like the obvious place for him to go. If he had known he was to survive, it would have always been his plan, probably. That being said, he would have probably expected it to be a much more solemn affair. But then, who could have predicted moments after Harry had snapped the elder wand, Mcgonagall would announce that she had spoken to Dumbledore, walking and talking, and the evidence pointed towards the idea that anybody who had ever been murdered by or in the name of Voldemort was currently resurrecting themselves. That had led to a lot of aurors being sent around the country to find these people and take them to St Mungos, a lot of Obliviators working overtime with terribly confused muggles, and a lot of spirits lifted as the war came to an end. The No Longer Dead, as the Prophet had dubbed them, weren’t allowed to integrate yet. They were being kept in the hospital to be checked up on, and for those who had been deceased for a while, updated on the magical world. Still, the idea that Harry’s loved ones were breathing, and he could see them again - meet his parents, even - was one that he hadn’t properly stopped thinking about since he heard it.
She was in his room quickly, a vial of potion in hand, which she threw over. Harry caught it in a hand and downed it in one. Down to about 50%, which was lucky, because he didn’t fancy throwing up all over Hermione.
“Y’know, this is lovely.” He slurred.
All in all, everything was working itself out.
Ginny’s face fell, just for a second, but Harry didn’t think anyone else noticed. Her wide smile was back quickly as she smacked Seamus playfully on the arm, saying, “Plus you keep stealing my clothes.”
“Um. Yeah, sure.” Harry knew he had turned red. It was probably normal to feel uncomfortable at that, he reckoned. Seamus was just trying to embarrass him, after all.
Ron hurried upstairs. He mumbled something about going to change. Harry thought he had the right idea. He knew from experience that even Ginny’s good natured hexes were not to be taken lightly.
“For what?” Harry shook his head minutely, eyes wide. “Ginny, what are you doing?”.
“It’ll wash off in a couple days. Plus it looks hot anyways, hey Harry?’ Seamus smirked.
“Harry, 	who is that?” Dean was watching Dudley approach.
“Is it about Ginny?” she asked.
Harry shook his head, suddenly determined to move on. “Your parents were scared. You were a kid. It’s fine.”
Harry thought that was a bit mean. It wasn’t his fault that Malfoy had got in the way of his feet, because that’s who the person was, now Harry squinted in that direction. He looked very cold in those clothes. He didn’t even have a coat on. Harry was thinking about offering his coat over, but then Malfoy sniffed and walked away.
“As you should,” she beamed, and walked over to sit on the end of his bed. “Are you going to tell me why you got so worked up yesterday?” She asked. “I’m worried.”
As soon as they were through the doors, Hermione snatched everything the pair of them were holding and shoved both of her friends up the stairs.
“Depends where we go,” Harry shrugged.
Harry stared at him, his breath coming out shakier than he would have liked.
Still, leaving for the Weasleys’ couldn't come soon enough, and Harry was relieved when Ron pulled out the floo powder the next afternoon. Harry grabbed the presents he had wrapped for everybody, and stepped through into the Burrow.
“Still shit.” Dudley grunted.
“Well, you’re going to see her today, you know. We’re going back over for New Years, Ron says, if that’s ok with you? You could always talk to her about it.”
“Expand.”
Harry was sitting in the kitchen with Hermione and Ron. The sun was just peeking in, through the window, and Hermione was reading through accounts of reversed memory spells. Ron was pretty sure that getting Hermione’s parents memories back would be easy, Hermione was worried it would go wrong. Harry thought maybe she was also putting it off a bit because she didn’t know if they would blame her for what she had had to do. He was eating the toast Ron had burned because really, with some jam on it, you could hardly even tell.
“Sure. In a letter.”
“If this is about Gin, mate, she’ll come around.” He nodded.
“What the fuck?” Ron said again, louder, this time leaning back heavily in his chair. “You are though. She’s been into you since she could bloody talk, Harry. Don’t worry, she’ll come round. I’ll smack her if she doesn’t.”
**********
Harry went to the cupboards and found himself a croissant that he’d bought the other day from Sainsburys, and started to butter it as he spoke.
“Yes, Harry” she rolled her eyes fondly.
“To be fair mate, I do reckon you could have got those from like, a Claire’s.” Harry said.
place, it’s past not so relevant when it was full of Ikea's finest furniture and a plant collection that could have rivalled the Hogwarts greenhouses. Most people weren’t coming back until the new year, but George started coming with them on their day trips more often than not - be it to Camden’s markets, or pubs in the evenings. One day Hermione convinced them to take the train to a petting zoo that she had gone to when she was younger, and that seemed to make her even more focused on perfecting the spells to bring her parents back.
Luna and Dean left soon after, and it was at that point that Harry felt the need to check with Ron that he’d still be welcome at the Burrow even with Ginny leaving him. Ron tutted and rolled his eyes, promising him that Molly would always want him around and anyway, if anyone had a problem they could do one. Harry punched him lightly in the shoulder, but nodded a thank you.
Harry frowned. Ginny pulled herself up, and sat with the sheets nestled around her. She gazed into his eyes.
Harry bristled. “Oh my god, Ginny. Why can’t you drop this?”
“There’s a reason she likes me most,” Harry grinned, before turning to Ron. “Is everyone ready then?”
“Yeah. You’ve changed.” Harry looked over at Dudley, finally.
Seamus left a few days before Christmas. He seemed nervous, but Dean wasn’t there and so Harry sat with him in his room and let him vent about the muggle village he grew up in, which was apparently very small and very Conservative and Catholic and genuinely believed he might be a demon because of the time that he got off a bus there wearing a skirt. Harry pulled him in for a hug and offered to stay at Grimmauld Place with him for the holiday, but Seamus rolled his eyes.
“I’m not shouting, mate. Want me to bring a hangover potion in?”
**********
Once Harry had showered, brushed his teeth and even his hair, gotten dressed, shaved his face and given a moisturiser he found in the bathroom a try, he could think of no more excuses to stay in his room. He pulled open the door to go downstairs. He crossed his fingers tight, not one for superstition but willing to prolong the idea of having to talk about it for as long as possible. To be fair, he often was the first one awake, and it was only just past eight. So perhaps it made him cowardly, but if the others - especially Ron - were still in bed, he would most likely enjoy his breakfast a lot more.
“I am.” Ginny said, her face scrunched in an expression that looked far too much like pity.
“Me and Perce have sorted it! Get excited, big brother!” George grinned, the mischievous look that he’d been missing lately back on his face. Percy grimaced, and Ron laughed. Hermione, on the other hand, seemed to have her own plans she was working on.
**********
Ron grunted and held onto his arm tighter. “How much did you drink, mate?” He asked. He looked worried, but there was no need to worry. He ought to see that. Harry stumbled down the street, his friends arms never leaving his, but he still almost walked into somebody. They were in the way, it was their fault.
**********
“Told you. Nothing to it,” Ron said.
of cousins, christmas, coffee shops, and wavering heterosexuality.
“Nice one,” Harry grinned, keeping his face as encouraging as he knew how. “What’ve we got to do?”
There were eight doors of the calendars open now, and even Ron admitted there was some merit in having a reason to eat chocolate every morning. Last night they had gone out to a pub where nobody knew who Harry was, so it was a slow morning, but hangover potions definitely helped. Today was a Christmas shopping day, it had been decided, so Harry pulled on his jeans and an old Weasley jumper with his gryffindor scarf. Ginny was lying on the bed, probably covering it with mud from her boots, waiting for him to be ready. He caught himself trying to hide from Ginny as he changed, before realising that there was absolutely no reason to do so, seeing as they were together, and slowly turned back around.
They were caught up in a swirl of Weasleys, who seemed to take a break from busily setting up the house to launch in for hugs in turn. Molly shoved mince pies under Harry’s nose (which he ate, gladly), Charlie had high fives all around, Fleur greeted Harry with a kiss to his cheek. Harry’s eyes flickered to find Ginny guiltily at that, before he remembered that he had decided to just ignore her. It was too late, though, and she caught his eye with a small smile, gesturing to the garden with a nod. Harry nodded back, minutely, and watched as she edged around the room to go outside. He pulled Percy in for a slightly awkward half hug, noting with pride the effort Percy was making to be polite, and then shoved the presents he had brought under the tree so as to follow Ginny.
Harry nodded slowly. He thought he actually was. He said so. Hermione shot him a knowing smile, her lips together, and even Ron grudgingly nodded. Harry didn’t need to worry about Dudley, he decided. They would finish shopping, and then go home and eat the lasagne Kreacher had promised. And if Harry happened to buy Dudley a Christmas card, there would be nothing more said about it.
Ron dragged the pair of them to the Electric Ballroom - a nightclub that Seamus had introduced them to. Harry wasn’t really a fan of clubbing, and he knew Ron and Hermione weren’t exactly too keen either most of the time, but as escapism goes he decided it was worth a shot. He let himself be taken in by the mass of bodies, the flashing lights, the pulsing music, and the drinks being poured.
“What the fuck, mate?” Harry raised his eyebrows, but also his feet, grudgingly.
Dean shook his head. “She’d definitely notice.”
Oh Jesus, Harry thought, collapsing onto a slightly damp bench. Ginny might have been right.
“Well, eat your breakfast, I think.” Luna told him, seriously, but something in her eyes told him she hadn’t misunderstood.
By evening, Ron seemed restless. “Let’s go out, hey,” he suggested, “get pissed, forget whatever it is, Harry?”
The news of the No-Longer-Dead were the reason that Harry’s move into Grimmauld place was a happy one, and he had vowed to make it nice enough that Sirius would be able to smile here, too. Living here was obvious for him, so he had picked a bedroom and made sure there weren’t any dead things in it. Admittedly, it was a less obvious move for all of his friends, but they had trickled in slowly and Harry felt the place was better for it. Ron and Hermione had come with him straight away, and awkwardly took a double room. It was strange, and different, but they were happy so Harry was too. Besides, it’s not like he hadn’t been expecting it. After a few days Ginny had come over, and she had asked Harry what was going to happen now, and Harry had said “I don’t really know” and Ginny had laughed and suggested they try being together again and Harry had laughed at that and he hadn’t laughed at much after the war ended so he figured it would be a good thing. Ginny moved into his room too then, and Harry hadn’t really got used to that, but he did like not having to be alone at night and he thought he’d probably adjust over time. The four of them started to spend most of their time performing cleaning charms, throwing rats out of windows, and building IKEA furniture the muggle way, which Harry insisted would make it feel more like a home.
It could be worse, Harry supposed. Luna was sitting at the island in the kitchen with her long hair in three braids around her head, a bowl of frosties and her favourite mug. (It had a pink sheep hand painted onto it, and Ginny had got it for her last Christmas. Harry felt his courage start to shuffle away.)
“Well, yeah. That’s probably on purpose.” Harry admitted.
**********
Seamus came crashing into the kitchen and lunged under the table by Harry’s feet.
on hold for a bit.”
“I’ll do this, off you go!” She chimed.
“What the fuck?” Ron frowned, and despite Harry’s worry this was going to start an argument, he had to wholeheartedly agree with the sentiment.
Harry blinked. “You know about that?”
She turned to look at him, her dark eyes gentle.
Harry frowned. “Told you?”
“Thank God!” Dudley laughed. He hesitated before continuing. “When we were in the safe house Dad got a bit weird. Bit like he did when we were eleven, you know, but this time he couldn’t run anywhere, so I had to, sort of, figure things out for myself for a bit. And there were all these people, right, magic people, and with what Dad said I thought they’d be horrible, but they weren’t? They were dead kind and then I started to think, you know, they’re just people. Dad wouldn’t have any of it, course, but when we got out of there I moved in with my girlfriend instead and got a job teaching gym at this youth mental health centre and, well Harry, there’s people going there for a lot less than what we did to you.”
“Hermione?” He interrupted.
Ginny leant back, in thought for a moment.
The one thing he knew is that he loved her. He did truly love Ginny. But, maybe she did have a point about one thing, at least. As much as it terrified him to admit it, Harry was starting to accept that he thought of her in a very similar way to how he thought about Ron. She was like a sister - almost too much like one given the way he thought of the Weasleys as a family. It was almost strange, really, that they had slept together. He wished he hadn’t started thinking that way. It was very quickly tearing apart all of his plans, and they were plans he knew Ron shared. He didn’t want to let anyone down, but he could see that Ginny was probably right about him not being that romantically invested.
“There’s nothing I can do, Gin!”
Unfortunately, the calm of the morning was broken only seconds later, Seamus sliding down the banister, Ginny running after him.
“Do you want to sit down, maybe?” Harry got out, vaguely gesturing at a nearby bench, one that looked out over the Thames,
*****
“I mean, okay. Put it this way. Let’s think of Fleur naked, right. Feel anything?”
“Not really. He has to go back to school once it’s open next year, I think.” She shrugged.
“Sorry. Should have warned you.” She said, a glint in her eyes.
“What?” He said.
“Yes, Harry, Merlin,” Ginny moaned. Harry was watching a spider. It was crawling on the ceiling, headed for the corner with the mould.
On New Years Eve, Harry woke up with a headache so bad that he almost forgot Voldemort was gone. He shoved on his glasses, trying to move as little as possible. The risk of being sick was definitely at about an 80% chance. He dragged his phone towards his face to check the time. It was almost twelve. He groaned and tried to sit up. Up to 90%. He took a few deep breaths, but it was no good. He used his phone to ring Hermione.
They ate in silence, for a bit, and Harry let himself think about what it would mean if he and Ginny had broken up. It really did throw his whole plan out of the window. Up to now, he’d been working on the assumption that he and Ginny would eventually get married and have kids, and he would support her quidditch career and she would support him as an auror, and their children would be best friends with Ron and Hermione’s, and they would all live a nice, normal, happy life. It was a fantasy that had gotten him through some of the hardest parts of the last year - the one he tried to never think about. It was what everyone expected of him. Ginny couldn’t just throw that away, right?
“So. I think you might have a point,” Harry spoke in monotone, staring at the bedframe behind Ginny, “about the gay thing. But I don’t know how to know.”
He sighed as he went to throw the curtains open. It was definitely going to be a strange morning.
That was one of the first muggle things they bought, for the house. Dean suggested that it might be nice to make the place a whole lot more muggle-friendly. That way they would have options. Harry agreed. It helped that he thought the Blacks would have hated it, and Sirius would love it when he came back. They had bought the kettle from Asda without realising that electricity in general wouldn’t work - not until Harry bought an expensive energy converter from a shop on Stronem Street. The price had come as almost as much a shock as it had been to discover new Wizarding areas of London. He’d never even thought to ask if there were more places, which was strange, looking back. The converter had been weak in a place as magical as Grimmauld until Hermione fixed it up a bit. Since then, though, they had been working to create a very muggle house, with the exception of the extension charms. Light switches started working, laptops got plugged in, phone calls started getting made. It was nice. It was a compromise between the magical and the muggle parts of Harry and he loved it. Though, he wouldn’t say that out loud, scared he would break this fragile happiness they had found.
“Do you know anything about what happened to Malfoy after his trial?”
“I wanted to apologise. For - well. You know.”
**********
It was with a grimace that he turned the corner to hear a gentle humming coming from the kitchen. Harry gathered his supposed Gryffindor courage and went through the creaking door.
He was well and truly wasted by the time Hermione pulled him up from the corner he was sitting in, and said it was probably time to leave. He wasn’t happy to hear it. He liked that corner. It was lovely and solid and if he had to move he might fall over, and the corner had a very funny phallic drawing next to it that he was busy appreciating.
Luna turned to him, eyes wide, and nodded. “I think you probably did, then.”
**********
They had all been happy. They were finally all happy, and Ginny had to go and ruin that. There had been a sort of peace that they had all been enjoying for the first time in years, really, and now Harry had to break the news that something had changed.
“Oh, Merlin, Harry I know. That’s my point. I think you really should try thinking about it instead of writing it all off. For me? Please?”
**********
“Harry, are you okay?” Hermione asked, her eyes creased.
Although, Harry thought, slowing down as his eyes widened, the idea of being with a man, a future with a man - it wasn’t as terrible as he had hoped he’d find the idea.
“No, like you really, really aren’t. For fucks sake, you’re hardly even hard.”
Hermione was hugging him, now, supposedly as a comfort, and Neville was looking at him with an expression of loyalty, which was lovely considering how close he and Gin were.
At some point in October, Neville had confided in Hermione that he didn’t want to be living with his Gran anymore, and Harry agreed that they had more than enough space than they knew what to do with and so he had found himself a bedroom there too. The house was slowly filling up with plants - another definite improvement, as far as Harry was concerned. Next was Luna, who Harry couldn’t remember officially deciding to live there, but she stayed over more and more and hadn’t left for weeks now. Then Seamus and Dean had let it slip they were looking for somewhere to move together, and Harry had scrunched his face, laughed, and said they were welcome to another of the empty rooms in his house. Seamus had immediately agreed. Dean had raised his eyebrows and asked Harry if he was serious, but Harry realised he was. Dean was great at painting the walls too, and then Grimmauld was colourful and covered in murals. George came over a lot, not usually to sleep, but enough to make it clear that he didn’t really know how to act waiting for Fred to be let out of hospital. He was quiet, and seemed unsure of himself, but he was learning to be his own person at the same time as counting down the days, and Ron told Harry he was happy about that.
“Ah, yeah. My father got a job in the area.” I supplied. Harry brightened up, resting his hands on his hips and
"It's alright, Harry."
“Good!” Luna smiled, standing up from her position on the floor, “So let's go.” She held a hand out for me to take, and I let her help me up and bring me across the cafe to the unisex bathrooms.
“Draco!”
It will.
:) Thanks for all your support!
“Sure, that sounds good.” He said softly. “I’ll tuck these away then,” he said, raising the box in his hands for emphasis. Harry stepped back down the hallway, and I was left with Remus and Sirius again.
“Oh?” I murmured, amused and slightly turned on.
“But I know you do!” I shouted. “I know you wish I wasn’t gay, that’s why you’re so uncomfortable around me!” I bit the inside of my lip, feeling a crying fit coming on. All my insecurities just kind of gushed out, coming out to Harry had put me on edge. “I know you want me to work harder, do better in school, and I know you wish I was more of a man.” I took a deep breath to calm myself. “I... The truth is, no matter how hard I try, I know I’ll never be enough. I know I’ll always disappoint you...” I clenched my hands under my thighs, blinking back tears. Now that he knew what a giant pussy I really was, I may as well just go all or nothing, but I still had some pride.
“Is it noticeable?” I touched my cheek self-consciously. Luna batted my hand away and started applying more makeup to my face, hiding the bruise from Blaise, Pansy and Theodore. Draco agreed not to tell his friends, saying it was my choice whether I wanted to share or not. Before we went to get them, he helped me apply some ice to the sore spot and a bit of Luna's makeup to hide the darkened skin.
“It will.” He agreed.
“No, that’s my fault.” I insisted. “I haven’t fed you, like a good date would.” I winked, unable to resist the chance to tease him. Harry looked away, smiling but blushing deeper.
, followed by a hand-drawn happy face.
“That’s our Draco. Are you going out for the evening?”
“Draco!”
“Okay.” I agreed easily. Harry attempted a smile, and I flung an arm around his shoulders. “I won’t force you to talk about it, but if something’s bugging you then you know you can talk to me, right?” Harry smiled again, this time with his eyes as well.
“Don’t push yourself too hard, pup. I’ll come down and visit later on, okay?” I nodded again, wiping under my eyes to make sure there were no more noticeable tears.
“Alright...” He grinned and started crossing the street, turning away from me.
Thank you so much, everyone, for the supportive comments on my last chapter. It was scary opening up, even to strangers online, but I'm really glad I did. I was furiously writing for days, editing and building on to the half written Chapter Six I made years ago, and pounded out this chapter for everyone, already working on the next. Really, thank you for encouraging my renewed spark of passion for writing. I hope you all enjoy!
“I thought so.” I smiled at him and went back to where I was looking, biting my lip to stop smiling. He was CUTE, and SWEET and FLIRTY and
Nearing the end of the story!
“It’s a long story. Not for winter weather.” He waved dismissively. I realised we had been standing in the cold for a while, and Harry was trembling all over. I nodded in front of us, and we started walking again, Harry nudging me with his shoulder. “I wonder why the kids at your school didn’t see how good you are.” I wrinkled my nose.
“Why? What do you mean?” I asked, getting worked up.
“Ah, yeah.” I stuttered awkwardly. Harry pursed his lips to hide a smile and moved behind his counter.
I didn’t cut for a long time after that, but you know what they say.
I chuckled, moaning when his hips rocked against mine, brushing my own erection, which was straining against my trousers.
I really liked Harry. He was so kind and funny and cute and I
“Oh, you don’t have to do that...” I waved away his hesitation, leaning forward.
“I’m sorry.” I sobbed. “I’m sorry...”
“I never thought I’d never get it back, but I did.” Harry smiled slightly at me, touching a thumb to my bottom lip. “It’s funny,” he said, “ but maybe I needed it.” he shrugged. “‘Cause it took the worst thing I ever thought could  happen to me, to make me feel secure. I know I can come out on the other side, stronger. I know everything will be okay.”
“Draco.” Harry’s nervous voice floated over to me from the entrance to my kitchen.
“Hello there,” I laughed, looking at the little candles as Harry dragged me inside. “Did you lose power or something?”
“Alright,” I snapped, getting all three of their heads turned towards me at once. “I don’t know what kind of silent agreement you have about this, but I was not let in on it.” I crossed my arms over my chest, leaning against the wall closest to the couch. “I’m getting you some ice.” I directed at Harry. He opened his mouth, presumably to deny me, but I cut him off. “No, I am. And you’re going to deal with it.” With that, I turned and walked into my kitchen, throwing the cupboard under the sink open and getting a new washcloth before wrenching the freezer open to get ice.
“Draco, I don’t think I tell you enough that I love you.” I held myself back from rolling my eyes, my stomach lurching. The last time he told me he loved me was four years ago, at my grandmother’s funeral, when he addressed my mother and I by saying he ‘loved his family’. My father wasn’t very affectionate, to say the least. “I understand that you are a teenage boy, and you’re going to start having thoughts and urges-” I turned to face my father in shock.
Sorry if there's a big break between chapters, guys. I like to have the chapter that comes next done before I post and sometimes it takes a while.
“I-uh- I saw your nametag.” Harry looked down and blushed, rubbing his head awkwardly.
“Theodore.” I laughed despite myself. “He has brown hair and hazel eyes. He’s... Kind of gangly, but in an endearing way. He’s just a bit taller than me. We’ve been friends throughout elementary school.” I rolled my eyes to myself, remembering our awkward relationship. We snogged a few times and he tried to get me off once, but it was too weird for us. “We tried dating, but it was just too awkward. Whenever we kissed, I would think of when we used to have sleepovers and swim around in his little plastic pool. I kept seeing him as a ten year old in his white briefs and it was a major turn-off.” Harry let out a surprised laugh, holding his stomach. “I’m sorry, that was probably a bit too much information.”
“Uh, I don’t know what you’re talking about...” He looked up at me pointedly, his eyes begging me not to say anything. “Luna and Neville here already?” He asked softly, passing me and pausing before walking into my flat.
“No!” My father huffed in defeat. “Unlock your door, we need to talk.” I ground my teeth nervously, but stood up to unlock my door, opening it for my father. “Thank you.” He managed. “Take a seat.” I sat on my bed again while my father closed my door, pulling my desk chair over in front of me and sitting down. “I’m a bit frustrated right now,” He started.
“So let me go first.” His rough voice swept my anxiety away and replaced it once again with tight, aching arousal.
“Yeah, but I’m going upstairs to get a bite to eat before I start. Uh, want to come with me?” Draco looked surprised, and a bit pleased, but he shook his head no. “Okay. See you in a bit.” I waved shyly and walked up the stairs, catching Draco looking at me before he went back to his book. Draco was really handsome, and his eyes were brilliant. It was kind of distracting. He had taken to hanging out with me while I worked, and though I really enjoyed having him around, I felt a bit guilty. I felt like I was taking time out of what was really important. But I couldn’t- didn’t want to stop.
“If you’re not ready-”
“Why didn’t he?” I asked tentatively.
“I’m afraid I won’t be any help there. I’m not very popular.” He shrugged nonchalantly. “Just be yourself.” He smiled at me and handed me my tea, our fingers brushing and causing me to almost drop my tea. “You can bring that with you to the books if you promise not to make a mess. My boss would have my head.” Harry grinned crookedly at me again.
“That’s fine, mother. They don’t mind.” My mother came up beside me and hugged my shoulders, looking at Neville and Luna, Neville shrinking under her gaze.
“Sirius! Now's not the time!” Remus hissed, resting a hand on my shoulder. Harry looked determinedly at the ground. The two men stared each other down, passing something between them wordlessly.
“Don’t be.” Harry waved a hand dismissively. “I’m alright with talking about it now. I have a lot more family with me now than I did then...” He trailed off, biting his lip. “But...” It was quiet for a moment, just the soft crunch of snow beneath our feet as we walked. “What’s your father like?” Harry asked suddenly, looking up at me. I accepted his not-so-subtle topic change and thought for a moment before answering.
He tasted divine, and I sucked softly at his pulse point, blood hammering through his veins. His hands ran through my hair, his head dipping down and lips capturing mine, his fingers resting behind my ear and his thumb on my cheek. His tongue slipped against mine, rubbing, tasting. I sucked gently on the muscle, squeezing the length in my hand. He moaned into my mouth, then pulled away to pant into my ear.
"These frames don't break, unlike the ones you are wearing," Draco said as he sat down on the bed.
“You, my dear boy. You gave him the right to live,” she said calmly as though treading on thin ice.
“I’m fine,” he mumbled, stifling a yawn. The room was boring, as was the Healer.
“Is he safe? What about the baby?” Harry asked hurriedly.
Draco didn’t stop scrubbing.
“Nobody has to ever go through that, Draco. I was in a bad place and seeing you only made it worse. You triggered the memories which I kept locked away. I am getting help now. I’ll surely get better,” Harry tried to reason.
“Why are
“It’s all my fault,” Hermione’s voice broke into his ears.
"For once I really believed you changed, Malfoy. Now I truly think the saying is true. Once a Death Eater, always a Death Eater," Ron apparated with a crack knowing fully well that Draco wouldn't answer him.
“Scandalous!” Draco finished triumphantly.
“What does that mean, Molly? Draco isn’t safe with me? With his husband?” Harry bellowed.
“This is an invasion of privacy and I can legally take action,” Harry ignored her and continued.
The rest of their day had been pretty eventful. Whispers traveled around not so subtly wherever they stepped into. Draco had to remind himself constantly that this was his new normal and he had to live with it. There was no disgrace far greater than the one he hadn’t already put himself through. People pointed at him and spoke of how many he killed, how he must have enchanted Harry Potter even though said chances were absolutely minimal to none, how he murdered Harry Potter’s child. The same phrases repeated over and over in his hearing range made him slightly numb to all of it as their day went on. Ginny did try to lighten his situation by conversing mundane things about her life with him. She told him of how she spent days during her Quidditch tours, shenanigans the girls in her team cooked up at every given chance, about Dean Thomas with a look of unadulterated love, and more. What luck it was to find someone you could adore and love for the rest of your life, eh? He shook that thought away as soon as it registered. To be honest, Draco loved listening to her stories. After Harry just up and left, it had always been him, the television, and Sebastian; accompanied by his current obsession with cigarettes. Speaking of, he noticed his lack of need for one as the day progressed to evening.
"You're no better than your Death Eater Father, Draco. You're just like him. A filthy murderer," he spat venomously.
He chose to admire the bright fields outside. The breeze, just warm enough, kept licking him on the face occasionally. Draco breathed in deep and his mind was immediately filled with the smell of wet soil. Oh, how he loved that! The smell of soil right after rain drove him to serenity. Alas, his peace would only be short lived. The prospect of facing Molly and the other Weasleys, after everything that transpired, was terrifying.
“Potter Residency,” he whispered after stepping into the fireplace and the flames engulfed his cold body warmly and took him away from withering stares of fury.
if you would
“My mum thought it would be good for me. She didn’t see her sister often. And when dad died...” He trailed off, sighing. “Maybe we should talk about this later.” He looked uncomfortable.
“Yeah. Neville and Luna I don’t really understand. Neville is pretty ‘normal’, if not shy. Although Luna has her quirks, she really is lovely... As for me, well, I sort of brought it on myself.” I cocked my head to the side.
“We’re all misfits, Draco. As far as our group goes, a little homosexuality is quite normal. Besides, your sexual orientation does not affect your personality.” She pulled back to look at me, gesturing to herself. “I’m pansexual, and Neville doesn’t care.” Neville nodded in agreement. “So don’t worry about that.” I grinned and pulled Luna into another hug, feeling a wave of affection for my new friends.
“Really, Draco! And to think I believed you had some sort of class!” Pansy teased. “Please, tell me a bit about yourselves.”
“Your nipples are so tiny,” I couldn’t stop myself from giggling. Harry covered his chest with his hands, grinning.
“Hey, it’s okay...” I tossed the ice into the sink, holding him with both arms, resting my hand on the back of his head and petting his hair. “Just let it out, Harry. Have a moment.” I could feel his choppy breaths on my neck, my shoulder becoming warm and wet from his tears. “I’m right here, it’s okay.” We stood for a moment, Harry’s soft sobs interrupting the sounds from the telly in the other room. I breathed with him, held him tightly, stood strong for him.
“I’ll try.” She threw one, which I caught, and another one directly afterward, which I barely managed to get in my mouth. All three of them burst into cheers, Harry grabbing my arm while he laughed. A shock of warmth went through me where he touched me, and I felt myself blush, looking down while I laughed with them.
“I love you,” He said eventually, breaking the comfy silence that had surrounded us. I carded my hands through his shaggy hair, bringing his head up so I could look into his eyes again.
“Father...” I croaked. He moved onto my bed beside me and put an arm around my shoulders, pulling me to his side. God, he hadn’t hugged me since I was twelve, when I started secondary school. I couldn’t stop a sob from escaping, but I bit back the next one that threatened me.
“It’s important that you use safety when you’re-“
“Draco, love, what’s wrong?” I sighed, ignoring when she started petting my hair.
“Should go to my bed.” He continued, tilting his head back further and offering his neck to me. I smiled before kissing it again. “Should have way less clothing on.”
"It could cause miscarriage, mate. Judging by the looks of it, Malfoy really needs a Healer," Ron said sympathetically.
“Oh, God, no!” Draco groaned under his breath as he walked into the kitchen for a cup of coffee to go along with his morning cherry, only to see Ginny Weasley seated at the dining table, calmly sipping on
“This,” Draco waved his hand, indicating the entire shop. “How can you order groceries from a shop such as this? Frozen chicken in a box! I can’t even imagine. It’s simply…”
Draco only sniffed harder in anger. He couldn't understand what was happening anymore. Just yesterday, they were happy, weren't they? Harry had come home early and they went to a muggle theatre to watch some stupid movie, whose name Draco couldn't recollect because of his current turmoil. They made out in the darkness of the theatre and almost got caught by the people sitting in front of them. Then they went to a French restaurant and had a good amount of sophisticated dinner that satisfied Draco's tastes before retiring to their home. Harry had been so gentle to him yesterday while making love and for the umpteenth time, Draco thought that he might be falling hard for his husband.
His stomach growled once again for the umpteenth time reminding him that he hadn’t eaten anything since a day or two. Reluctantly, he walked towards the kitchen to cook some food only to find Ronald Weasley snoring and drooling on the dining table. If he wasn’t so out of it, he would’ve screamed. Gritting his teeth angrily, at himself for not noticing Weasley’s arrival or at Weasley for breaking and entering but not waking the sole inhabitant of the home, Draco marched towards the sleeping man and slapped his palm down onto the table, a few inches from Weasley’s face. Ron sat up with a start, mumbling “Bloody hell!”
“He’ll come. Don’t worry about him now. Let’s concentrate on you and the baby, alright?”
“Why are you behaving like this?!” Harry gritted, involuntarily shaking Draco by his bicep, forcing his husband to look into his eyes hesitantly.
Draco regarded his husband, trying to blink away the torpor that consumed him until a minute ago. It’d been so long since he slept so peacefully and both his body and mind craved for more.
He watched her take a small bottle with a squeeze bulb out of a navy blue pouch. Pressing the bulb to gather some liquid in the tube, she poured it drop by drop over Draco's face.
He crystal clearly remembered the days he gave up on food and sleep altogether and waited for someone to come and save him, hold him as he voluntarily fell down from the tower of sanity. Yet no one came because the others were busy trying to mend their own broken minds, to move on from all the destruction and debris. And one day, something in him finally snapped - as Ron and Hermione later called it - but for him, it felt like a second chance; like he was finally put together somehow but only a little differently this time.
Never once in their previous sessions had she suggested directly about Draco. Now that she did, it shocked Harry back to reality. Draco was why he sought her out in the first place. He should’ve known that someday, they’d talk about Draco. He finished his frog and licked his index finger before clearing his throat and sitting down on the sofa.
“I wanted to apologize. I know we are not friends, per se, but I want to be. No matter others’ opinions, I believe from the bottom of my heart that what Harry did to you was monstrous and he doesn’t deserve your forgiveness,” Ginny’s hand moved as if to hold Draco’s but she withdrew as it would’ve been awkward.

that Draco supposed they would not have. It didn’t matter that Harry had stayed. Nothing really mattered to him anymore.
Together, Harry and Draco opened the package to find a huge soft baby blue blanket that would easily cover the both of them. It was actually beautiful even to Draco. The material was softer than fur and Draco wondered what spells Molly used on it.
The subtle change in his posture did not go unnoticed by Arya and she noted it in the back of her mind. It started with light topics and heavy issues were to be dealt with later. Step by step, they would be reaching there and picking out all the unnecessary weeds in Harry's garden. Together.
seemed to trigger something irrational in him that reminded him of St Mungo’s and his miscarriage. He had a mild panic attack after. Only, there was no one to support his fall this time. He cried unwittingly. And when he thought he spent all his tears away, his mind proved him wrong by supplying some more. They didn’t seem to stop. Even his Marlboro couldn’t help. His body shook like a leaf in a storm and it was a very long while before the hurricane in his heart died down to a gentle breeze.
"Not like this, Harry! You didn't ASK me for my consent. If you had, maybe, just maybe, I would've thought about it," Draco's body started to shake and he couldn't control the onslaught of tears anymore.
Thank you diddleymaz (I never had Raspberry. Should try sometime!), Brambles, Madcheshirefox, The_Real_Nymphadora, Kikukaku, Yuizae for sharing your thoughts with me!
It was a while before he regained consciousness and he noticed that Harry still sat on the floor at his dangling feet. The irony of it brought another noiseless chuckle to his lips. His body was beyond exhausted and it took him a good four to five tries to finally sit up on the sofa, sneering disdainfully at his blood and Harry’s semen coating the blue upholstery. It needed a change now that it was tainted. He removed his legs from their position on the sofa arm and the movement spurred Harry into action. Draco watched wearily as his husband stood up and did the same as if they were in a staring contest. Blood now dripped from Harry’s wounds scantily onto the floor, Draco observed. Harry stretched his left hand out and his discarded wand flew into his palm effortlessly. He then partially healed the cuts Draco inflicted on his chest and waist until they were no longer bleeding.
“Why?”
thoughts of Self-harm (minor)
"No, no, no, no! It's impossible! Perform the tests again. The baby can't... Do them again," Harry rambled on in a commanding tone.
“It is our first Christmas after marriage, Draco. Molly is bound to make something special for us as she did for the previous couples. I don’t want to miss that, not because of your pureblood tantrum,” Harry’s mood riveted towards anger now.
That day had been the first and the last time he went to Fresh Mart with Harry.
in the first place! If I didn’t let the Dark Lord Mark me, my family would’ve been cursed to death. You didn’t know how the Dark Lord was! Death in his hands was never instant. He made sure you were cursed to the periphery of insanity and then made you beg for your death. I had to bear his Mark!” Anger coupled with fear dominated his mind and body and Draco shivered.
“Were you happy with your decision?”
But Ginny wasn’t fazed by it. No one would be raining on their parade and she would make sure Draco enjoyed their friendly date.
“No.”
This time, it wasn’t Harry attacking Draco in anger but the other way round. Draco pulled back his fist and socked Harry on the jaw with a force of colossal magnitude that Harry stumbled a few steps back.
Harry shook his head.
It was only when Harry had finished his croissant and done the washing up the muggle way that the others started coming down, grabbing food and drinks. Harry sat at a chair, smiling at the right moments and laughing whenever Ron did. It was past ten, actually, when Ron looked around.
Harry liked it this way. It felt like the building was being forced to change in more than just the physical ways. It was full of young muggleborns, half bloods, blood traitors, and they were stripping it of the place it used to be. Kreacher was upset, and refused to talk to Harry for three weeks, but one day at the end of October, he emerged from the attic where he had been hiding and cooked them all a delicious roast dinner. From that point on, he seemed to warm back up to Harry, Ron and Hermione, who introduced him to their friends. Kreacher even seemed to support the changes in furnishing once he saw Harry was strangely equally reluctant to remove the Black family tapestry. Harry was less keen on the painting of Sirius’ mother, but it didn’t seem to be going anywhere and Kreacher was comforted by that, too.
Ginny raised an only slightly purple eyebrow. “If you get both you’re sucking up.”
“Yeah. I think I will.” He decided.
The three of them went back through the floo to the Burrow that afternoon, and it was just as lively. Bill and Fleur were absent, but otherwise the family was all together again. This time there wasn’t as much food cooking, but Molly still stacked plates full of leftovers, Harry’s being noticeably fuller than the rest. He heard her mumbling about looking after himself better as she pushed it his way.
“Oi, where’s Ginny? She really still in bed?” He asked.
Harry clenched his fists, jaw tightened. “Look. I’m not - that. Honest. I’ve never even thought about all that, I swear.”
She sighed. “Yeah, but I am, though.” She grew more solemn. “I’m sorry, you know? I just panicked. I didn’t know what to do. I mean, that’s a pretty fucking heavy accusation I made.”
Harry blanched. “Ew, Ginny. Let’s not think of your brothers wife naked, becuase what the fuck?”
“Yeah.” Harry agreed, cautiously.
“Harry, you’re not even remotely enjoying this, are you?” She asked. She was laying on her back, determinedly staring at the ceiling as Harry looked over, eyebrows furrowed.
“Not the point,” Dean rolled his eyes.
“This was delicious, Molly, Arthur. Thank you! Tell you what, I’ll take the plates and wash up as thanks.” She smiled.
But then if he didn’t want Ginny, who did he want? There weren’t any other women who he felt anything for - he knew that. And even if he did humour Ginny’s ideas, it wasn’t like there was a man he loved.
“Right. Okay. So I’m not into that, I guess.” Harry frowned.
“Change it back.”
“Please?” She asked, eyes crinkling.
Hermione moved to Harry’s side and clasped one of his hands. “Are you okay, Harry? What’s going on?”
“Give me a minute?” Harry asked, his fists clenching against his sides.
“What? Course I am!”
“I don’t-,” Ginny said, but she kept her eyes away, focusing on the bags in front of her. “Maybe. Not forever, necessarily. It’s just, I think, it’s only fair, you know, that you think about it. And I wouldn’t blame you, if you are gay. Like, you know I’m bi, so I get it, and, well. Just - I think we should sort of put
He was on the front page again. This time it was mostly speculation about where he had gone and why he had vanished. (“You don’t owe them shit, mate”, Ron’s voice echoed in his head.) Otherwise it was filled with talk of Kingsley’s expected rise to Minister, the recovery of the wizarding economy and other things Harry was supposed to have an opinion on but didn’t quite understand. He threw it perfectly into the bin, shaking his head. But on the back cover, Draco Malfoy was smirking back at him.
Today’s drink of choice was an iced latte from Saint Espresso, which he was definitely regretting given the cold. He tucked it into the scarf he was wearing to carry it without his fingers hating him, and started the walk back.
Harry heard footsteps approaching, and turned around.
But as Christmas is wont to do, most of the day passed in a haze of shiny ornaments and food and music, and later, mulled wine, and before Harry knew it he was standing outside in the dark field as the stars shone down, cold and damp from definitely losing the snowball fight. And then soon enough again, he was warm and cosy in his pull out bed in Ron’s old room, listening to the soft snores beside him.
“Harry,” Ginny sighed. He hoped the mould was safe. He’d been breathing it in for months. He’d never really thought about it before, but knowing the potions that had likely been here, he really should have checked it.
“Bit of a coincidence, this,” he said.
Harry, meanwhile, took to waking up early and walking down to coffee shops, seeing as they were out of tea at home and the local Sainsburys wasn’t doing his favourite kind anymore. The walk gave him a chance to be alone, and think. He had promised Ginny, after all. The issue was, he didn’t really know how he was supposed to figure it out.
Ron raised his eyebrows, looking pointedly at Harry.
Honestly, Harry thought, this was all very unfair. She’d just walked out, presumably apperated away by now, leaving Harry to deal with everything. How could he explain this to everyone? Oh and Ron! Ron would be furious - he’d assume that Harry had hurt his sister and how could Harry explain the truth without telling them what she had accused him of? Which, by the way, was completely unfounded. Harry wasn’t gay. He’d know if he was. He’d only ever been with girls, hadn’t even questioned that. Ginny hadn’t even let him speak, she just ran away without a second thought.
“I should be getting off,” Dudley sighed, awkwardly getting to his feet. “You got a phone, Harry?”
He thought about making a cup of tea, but there were no tea bags in the cupboard so he poured a glass of Hermione’s orange juice instead, and then sat down opposite Luna.
Harry gulped. “Oh.” He said, and Ginny nodded playfully.
written on the bottom in permanent marker. Harry tried not to cry. Ginny smirked at him, noticing the tears anyway.
Harry stuck his tongue out, but did as she said nevertheless, and followed Ginny into her room.
“Oh, God, no. I didn’t mean - not that.” Harry spluttered.
Shit. Harry had been so caught up in his worries that he hadn’t actually thought of an excuse. “She reckons we aren’t, like, a good couple”, he tried, “and she pretty much told me that and then left.” Harry muttered.
Please do leave Kudos! Or a comment, if you wish.
Madcheshirefox, Kikukaku - Damn, you guys are really out there to kill Harry, aren't you? I could sense your frustrations and could help but feel happy that I elicited such a response from you. Thank you for staying with me and nudging me forward.
“Good. Thank you,” Draco only wanted them to leave him alone. He couldn’t maintain his façade anymore.
"Draco, you can't be thinking of aborting the child!" Molly butt in and Hermione nodded in assent.
“Yes,” she replied after a pause. “I’ll protect you if anything happens, I promise,” she expressed truthfully.
- None
“Don’t. Just don’t,” Draco interjected. “All these months, I needed you. You knew that. You KNEW, Harry. Where were you?” Draco found Harry’s guilt-ridden eyes.
When the room fell abnormally silent, Draco looked up to see that Harry was gone. He sighed and let his heart calm down. Facing Harry was such a tedious task these days! Just as he was about to have another spoonful of his flavored rice, out of the corner of his eye, Draco saw an object fly towards him and instinctively, he picked up his wand from where it was placed on the table and yelled, "Protego!"
"Everyone thinks I'm invincible; even Ron and Hermione!" Harry chuckled humorlessly.
"Then the wards wouldn't be triggered by my arrival here," Draco said and left the 'How did you know I was here then?' unspoken. Still, Ron understood what Draco meant.
"Alohomora!" the guest bedroom door burst open as Harry strode in, followed by Ron and Hermione.
Draco shut his eyes when he felt Harry’s hands kneading his hips and in a moment of weakness, let his head fall against Harry’s shoulder, which, he later realized was a mistake. Harry’s scent infiltrated his senses at once and his magic, which was deprived of Harry’s support during its reformation, was thrilled at the closeness and sought out Harry’s core, bringing them impossibly closer. Distantly, he remembered that they must be talking about something but his mind was too fuzzy to recollect what.
serilla, Laura, Babygirl33 - I'm trying my best to find happiness for Draco. Thanks!
“My Healer, you moron!”
MadamePerverell - Haha, dear, that's a nice dream you have there for Draco. I don't think Drasco can clear the required procedures to go to America as he is but nothing in the eyes of London's Wizarding Law. So, he wouldn't get a port key. I would love to write Draco loving himself though. I was aiming for it at the start but somehow, this story turned into a huge mess of domestic violence and self-abuse.
“Why do you love being an Auror?”
Draco settles down with his husband, Harry Potter.
“Wear the protective charm bracelet I gifted you, please,” said Hermione, taking Draco’s hand in hers.
"But - ,” she started to argue, just not knowing when to shut up.
“Since the other Father, in this case, you, Mr. Potter, is one with a strong magical core, the baby formed inside Draco triggered his dormant and almost non-existent magical core. Where he stayed for the past few years only suppressed his magical abilities because of the mental trauma he was put through. Luckily, your magic and the baby’s magic jerked his unresponsive core into action. Return of magic is quite painful and if coupled with copious amounts of alcohol, it can cause adverse effects. Hence the foam,” Yeager elucidated as if he were teaching a class of students at Hogwarts.
fought for?  How can you even –
Draco’s jaw tightened and do did his hold on a particular burn wound that sat a few inches below the wrist, right on the snake’s head. He savored wiping away the snake’s hissing smirk when he put out his cigarette on its head.
“I wouldn’t have stood a chance,” Draco slurred, with his eyes still shut.
Minutes of thick silence filled the room.
“What do you think you’re doing?” he asked her incredulously.
Rita Skeeter had always been known for her indifference and sly nature. For the first time in an eternity, she was truly terrified of the man sitting cozily in his chair, making statements about wanting to OWN someone else’s loss. In no way was she tempted to sympathize with a former Death Eater, but she couldn’t help but feel extremely sorry for Draco for being forced to live with a man such as Harry Potter. He had changed a lot more than she imagined. For only a minute, she let her composure crumble before building it back and screening her face with her usual wall of frigidity. No one, not even the Hero could make her break her character. Ever. Period.
“Tell me, Draco. Has anyone had a taste of you, hm? Did Voldemort bite into the son of his favorite Death Eater?” Harry pushed into Draco and the blonde felt the outline of Harry’s clothed erection.
This was information to Draco and he gasped indignantly.
And I set that fire.
Her words comforted him and strangely, he wanted the session to prolong. He didn’t want to leave her office as he felt the barrier inside his head crack a tiny bit. He wanted her to poke at it until it crumbled and broke down so that all the grief that he locked up inside him would pour out into the invisible glasses she laid out in front of him. For the first time, Harry felt that he could change and not hurt his loved ones anymore with his irrepressible fury.
Do expect frequent updates from now. I apologize for keeping you waiting!
“Do you think that almost a decade’s worth of pain and anger would simply be healed in days? Or weeks? I have lived with him for the past few weeks and he’s scary. Not always but there are days when I had to restrain him. His magic would be all over the place and it was affecting all of us. I had to send Hermione away to my Mum’s so that Rose would be safe from Harry’s outbursts,” Ron said in a dejected tone. Admitting his best friend's weaknesses aloud only cemented the fact that Harry was indeed a problematic man who needed as much help and support as possible.

Irisk - Here's the update you've asked for. Thank you for showing your love for my story!
“Don’t worry, I never order frozen foods. No frozen chicken,” he threw in a large bottle of peanut butter and mixed fruit jam.
Harry's head hurt with all the counseling he'd been receiving tonight. He was tired and hungry. Most of all, he couldn't face Draco like nothing happened. He hadn't the spine right then. He couldn't look into his husband's eyes and take in all the pain and resentment he caused. At least, not right now.
“It was the first thing I truly loved from the bottom of my heart after I came to know that I am a wizard. I didn’t have the slightest knowledge about flying on a broomstick but I can still remember the first time I sat on a broomstick, it felt like home. Up in the air, I was home. The air was my family. I could do anything! Anything, Mrs. Reynolds, and I would never fall. Even when I did fall, I used to be more worried about my broomstick rather than the state of my limbs or head,” Harry chuckled, remembering his third year and his broken Nimbus two thousand and one.
Not just a couple of weeks ago, he had been ready to smite one Draco Malfoy for hurting his best friend but upon finding the same guy compliantly taking a beating from an enraged Harry Potter, there was no way his heart didn’t change. The slightest bit felt huge. It was brutal. And, Draco was just lying down with his eyes closed, letting Harry beat him into oblivion. In the depths of his heart, he desperately wanted to believe that Harry wasn’t a bad person even though his actions screamed otherwise yet as a human, he could no longer ignore the simple fact that his best friend was long gone and the soul inhabiting Harry’s body was beyond corrupted because of the war and years of neglect. And that soul needed a target to vent out its frustrations. It took pride and pleasure in pinning Draco, once a Death Eater, to the ground and punching him till he was on the brink of death. Such a soul needed help. It craved love. And a whole lot of restraint.
“I doubt that. You have a shite way of showing that you care for me,” Draco pulled another cigarette from the pack and lit it up. Harry looked at him disapprovingly but otherwise didn’t comment.
And, in real life, Draco woke up to the Sun glinting harshly in his eyes, which for a moment, he mistook to be the knife dream Harry held in his hands.
"You made your choice, Draco," Harry said his given name and Draco winced at its awkwardness.
I'm coming to you, Draco. After all these years, I'm finally ready to face you. I never did answer your questions that day when I came into our home with Ginny's ring around my finger. I had no answers and to be frank, a part of me refused to answer you. It wanted to be free from your shackles. Stupid, I know. I can't turn back time. So here I am now, determined to look you in the eye and take whatever you give me. Whether we'll be friends or something more or nothing anymore, it's upto you to decide.
Draco can only face them with all he's got.
“Draco, how are you feeling?” Hermione pushed Harry aside and came to his side.
Without waiting for Hermione’s reply, he cut the connection and sat back on his heels, staring at the hissing embers.
“Do you mind if I have a word with you?” she was still speaking to him.
And just because they help the weak doesn't mean they aren't weak themselves.
“About that. I think he still needs some time away from you, Draco,” if Hermione was physically present, Draco would’ve hit her, pregnant or not.
“I don’t know what you are expecting but believe me when I say, there’s no particular reason, Draco. The day I visited you was peculiar, yes. I woke up, bought a ring and came to you,” Harry answered and Draco raised a curious brow.
“Give me the rest of your cone and I’ll give you mine. Deal?” she asked.
“I’ll be fine,” Draco said, letting Harry fondle his palms as it was gradually calming him down.
“I’ll pay for mine,” he said.
~ Wheezy
“Come on, let’s get you settled upstairs in our room,” Harry’s voice blasted through his evaluations and he turned around.
He let go.
Thank you for all your warm Kudos!
“Good for you,” Draco said mockingly. “Will you ever answer me or are we still dancing away from it?” Draco asked when he saw that Harry was about to say something foolish once again like before.
Harry cleared his throat before responding. “First of all, he’s Draco
“You’re not the only one, Harry,” she answered.
Draco never felt any better as he collected himself into an upright position before walking towards the only exit; towards his horrific drunk of a husband who stood, blocking the doorway. If there had been any other exit, he certainly would've preferred that. If only he could apparate to their bedroom... But he knew he couldn't. Not even Harry could as the man strictly hated apparition from one room to another. Even when he direly needed Draco's body pliantly rocking underneath him, he would make sure they reached their room by means of NO apparition. Gulping, Draco wished for a hole to swallow him and spit him back in their room. As there would be no such luck dawning on him, he resolved himself to stay strong and not be afraid of his husband with every heavy step he took towards Harry, towards the exit. He would then lock himself away in their bedroom and stay there until Harry left for work. Only then would he be safe from his husband's untimely wrath. If by any chance it came down to a duel, Draco was sure that he wouldn't win. He had no advantage over Harry either magically or physically.
“I wonder how I’d do without my Lights in Azkaban. Think you could put in a word about that?” Draco didn’t let his voice falter as he lit another cig, not caring when Harry hissed in displeasure at Draco filling his house with nicotine and caffeine. Not that Draco cared.
"Blimey!" Harry exclaimed softly, much like his best friend Ronald, before turning around and walking toward Draco determinedly.
“I’m leaving then. Convey my heartfelt regards to Granger,” Draco said flatly to Harry.
Thank you all for you warm Kudos and comments. You inspire me to write more. What started as probably a oneshot has turned into this. Being in Draco's and Harry's minds is getting extremely difficult. Some of it, I am writing from my experiences so it's a become mentally exhausting.
"I need to cleanse my eyes," Ronald said after a while.
“Let’s go home, Draco,” he extended his hand, silently asking for his husband to take it and cut the drama but Draco’s fears came back in full force, remembering all the days Harry hit him for nothing. A few kisses wouldn’t change a man’s existent personality. So, he shook his head, declining Harry’s offer and he heard Hermione sigh in relaxation beside him.
“Thanks, I suppose,” said Harry as he placed the bags on the floor. Draco smirked at the realization that the Chosen One was lifting his bags for him.
Healer Yeager had never given emotional advice to anyone. It wasn't his duty. But, he supposed he could make an exception for the man that saved them all from a gruesome fate.
"Yes! I'm sorry for going against your wishes but I was worried about him! He's not well at all. He needs help, Harry; he's harming himself," she spoke so fast that Harry couldn't understand what she was saying. Yet, he got the gist of it and tried to calm her down.
For the third time, Draco began watching the season one of Supernatural, admiring Dean's humor and stripping Sam of his unnecessary clothes with his eyes. Being married to a bloke surely turned him gay or he probably had been inclined towards both the genders all along and he simply didn't recognize it to explore. He took a large gulp of coke before dragging on the cig he held loosely in his right hand. There was no better place than nicotine and caffeine combined into one, settling warmly down in his stomach. Strange, but oh so blissful.
“You wouldn’t have agreed,” Harry replied.
“No, Draco. You. Only you,” he chanted while placing light kisses on Draco’s nape.
"I'm broken, Draco. And if you're with me, I will bleed you to death," Harry said every word so slowly that Draco feared that the time had come to an abrupt irreversible stop.
“Until I know what happened to me, I won’t be leaving this place,” Draco announced with a slight quiver to his tone.
The first time Arya asked Harry to tend to his broomsticks, he suffered a major setback. All the progress he made was for naught, she realized, when she observed in their third session that Harry had broken his knuckles punching the wall in order to curb the pain the sight of his broomsticks caused. She hadn’t apologized because Harry’s reaction was exactly what she wanted to analyze and discuss. Yet she hadn’t learned anything in that session too as Harry seemed utterly closed off to anything she wanted or questioned. Still, she gave him the same assignment – Tend to your broomsticks. At least one is fine. Their fourth session was a bit more productive though Harry hadn’t tended to his broomsticks. He opened up about his Godfather, Sirius Black. No one seemed to realize how Sirius’ death affected Harry. And later, the war. The war was still a topic they haven’t reached yet but Arya knew that they’d get there. Baby steps.
“You couldn’t help but blame the Death Eater who murdered Harry Potter’s unborn child, according to the Prophet, which, I must sincerely add, no one frigging denied!” he whirled around facing her, fuming hotly.
Inside the room, he saw Draco fast asleep on the hospital cot; his skin deathly white. The Helpers who tagged along with Healer Yeager were moving their wands over Draco in repeating motions which irked Harry more than it should’ve; not knowing what they were doing to his comatose husband.
Thank you aurol, PeoniesandIrises, slashie, diddleymaz, and Irisk for your comments!
There it was again when his right ear slipped free.
“Want to choose again then?” said an angry voice that sounded a lot like Harry.
Thank you Kikukaku, Madcheshirefox, Irisk, PeoniesandIrises, MadamePerverell for your comments!
Defeated emotionally, he watched as Sebastian flew towards the brown owl with one of his treats in his beak and fed it to the brown bird, which accepted the treat and afterward, combed Sebastian’s feathers with its beak in a loving gesture. Draco smiled ruefully and slipped Harry's wedding ring onto his left ring finger, letting it rest against his wedding ring.
“Harry?” Draco’s voice was feeble to his ears. Maybe because he kept them closed.
“Oh yes! I was in my third year when Dementors attacked me on Hogwarts grounds. I fainted and when I came to, I was asking about the match and my broom. Believe me when I tell you that my heart was blown to smithereens when I was shown my broken Nimbus. I still have it, you know?” somehow, the smile on his lips didn’t want to die down and his cheeks hurt from smiling so much.
“Hermione, are you alright?” he heard Harry and a soft grunt signified that he might’ve hugged Granger.
“I will if you quit that,” Harry’s nose twitched due to the stagnant smoke rolling around the room.
(See the end of the chapter for
Trapping Draco between him and the wall, Harry began to nudge Draco’s nape with his nose in an almost loving gesture that only felt disgusting to the blonde, given the situation. He struggled harder and whispered a ‘yes!’ of triumph when one of his flailing arms caught Harry’s ribcage in a painful shove. Draco almost freed himself but Harry was faster. He recovered quickly and with a surge of anger, he held Draco’s wrists in his hands and pressed them into the wall, high above Draco’s head.
“Not today,” uncharacteristically, Harry’s face seemed to contort in pain and Draco hadn’t argued anymore. Clenching his mouth as tight as the fists balled at his side, Draco nodded curtly and took Harry’s arm for a Side-Along. At least, the tug of Harry’s magic at his navel felt good and left warm traces on his skin after.
“Actually, my mother is dragging me out of town tomorrow to visit my friends from my old school for the weekend.” Harry’s face fell for a moment, but he quickly smiled at me.
“This is my job.” He laughed, pushing the books aside. “Just the one?” I nodded and fished out my wallet while he scanned it. I left a tip, thanking the wavy-haired boy before turning to leave the shop.
to go at first. I’d rather stay here, but Remus agreed with Siri and you always said he was the smart one.” I babbled, laughing weakly. “I thought it would be a good idea to listen to him.” I glanced at the clock on her bedside table. “I’m sorry; I have to go to school now. Don’t worry, Aunt Petunia said she would feed you. I’ll check when I get home just in case, but she’s usually pretty good with you. At least, I trust her to do that for me while I’m gone. I hardly ever go out anyways.” I sighed, finally looking up at my mum. “See you tonight. I’ll tell you all about it.” I stood and placed a kiss on her forehead, checking her machines before I left. “Sorry...” I mumbled, stepping out of the room.
I booked it home.
“It’s different.” I admitted. “I went to a private school before. Things are a bit more relaxed here.”
“They’re just green.” he protested. Then, a little boldly, he added, “I can think of something else you’ll like the look of.”
“Good. We love you, don't forget that.” I smiled at my friend and pulled her in for a hug, kissing the side of her head.
“Is it?” He asked mysteriously, returning to the front counter. I looked down at the book and followed him, placing it on the counter. Remus smiled and rang it through, handing me a bag, but not putting the book in, knowing I preferred to start reading in the shop, often with a latte in hand. Speaking of lattes…
I was definitely done for.
“You know we’re already dating, right?” I asked, grinning at him over my glass of wine, “You don’t need to impress me.” Harry huffed a laugh, rolling his eyes.
I kicked off my shoes and placed them in the closet before removing my coat and hanging it up. I folded my scarf and tossed it to the shelf above the coats, sighing to myself. I closed the closet door and was face-to-face with my mother. I let out a small shriek, jumping back and leaning against the wall to calm my heart.
“Can I ask why?” I wondered politely. Harry froze while pouring the water for my tea, his free hand clenching on the counter.
“Hey.” Harry’s voice was quiet and tired. He looked damp, the jacket he had slung over his arm wet and dripping on the hallway carpet. He was wearing baggy, worn jeans and an old green Henley that looked amazing with his eyes. Or, one eye, considering the other one was clearly swollen and beginning to bruise.
“Fuck,” Harry moaned, and this time I saw his cock twitch. “Would love that, babe.”
I washed my hands and moved my hair out of the way, getting to work cleaning cups with a sigh. A short glance up at the customers confirmed my fears that people had been staring as I made eye contact with a teenage boy in the fiction section. I smiled shortly and went back to prepping, feeling embarrassed. He probably went to my school; probably spread rumors and gossip about me. I felt Remus looking at me, pausing in his work sorting out our new books. He walked over to me, leaning down to talk in my ear.
“Excuse me.” I said quietly, not wanting to disturb the boy who was sorting. He looked up, his hazel eyes scanning me quickly. “Sorry. I didn’t want to interrupt.” His nametag said
“You want to fool around with me?” I replied stupidly, nearly choking on the words. Harry stifled an amused snort, biting the tip of his tongue in a new, painfully cute attempt to keep from laughing.
“Er, yes…” She was beginning to irritate me, and was moving from innocently curious to pure nosiness.
...” I joked. Harry laughed and turned back to his pastries, putting them on a cooling shelf. His free hand pressed to his stomach, pushing harshly against the flat plane. A sort of grimace came to his face. “Are you hungry?” I asked, critically eyeing his prominent cheekbones. He was getting skinnier lately, almost skeletal. “When’s your break? I’ll take you out.” Harry flushed cutely, and I stopped myself from smiling like a dopey love-sick child.
A peek into Harry's home life, movie night with the group and Draco has a talk with his father. Enjoy!
, where we can take
“Hey guys.” He greeted them like everything was normal. Neville looked up first, his jaw tightening, but not saying anything except for a polite hello. Luna didn’t even look at him, just holding his hand when he sat next to her, keeping her eyes on the telly. I watched them in shock.
“Yeah, that’d be great.” Neville blushed and smirked at me, and I went into my kitchen to grab the snacks and a few cans of pop. I returned after a moment, finding Luna struggling with the TV remote and Neville face-palming beside her.
! I couldn't look away!
“Whatever you're thinking,” he said, “You're wrong. You've got that self-deprecating look on again.”
“Oh, that’s probably Harry.” Luna looked worried all of the sudden, so I rushed to answer it.
“Draco...” My father sighed. “I’ve been reading up on homosexuality for months now. I bring it up whenever I can, and never in a negative way. I’ve told you over and over that I don’t mind-“
My only saving grace was when I could find a quiet place to read while I ate my lunch, digging into the book I got from the store the other day. Though it made me a bit sad to read about how happy the couple was, I found myself loving the author the more I read his books. In this book, it was less about the couple and more about everyday life and struggles, focusing less on the gayness of the characters and more on their personalities and relationships.
Our school had a discreet classroom that was open for students to use as a study place, but it was often empty and occupied instead by Harry, Luna and Neville. They simply closed the door behind them at lunch, and people assumed the class was closed.
“Is that cheese souffle?” I asked Harry as he returned to the loft, slightly out of breath from going up and down the stairs. He shoved his hands into his pockets, grinning with a shrug.
I laughed against his throat, where I was working on marking his pale skin.
“Lu, what are we doing?” I asked once the bathroom door was shut behind us. Luna smiled and pulled a powder compact out of her sweater pocket.
“You first saw me in a book shop, and I have one right here.” I smiled as I held the book up, and Luna grinned widely.
“Oh, well,” she began, shuffling slightly away from Luna, but facing her, “That’s one way to compliment someone.”
“Alright, dear. Don’t forget to take a shower. I’ll have breakfast ready for you before your father leaves.” I smiled back at my mother, albeit more strained than her smile.
“N-no! He’s a boy, and-” Remus cut me off, looking amused.
“It’s…” Sirius dragged out the ‘s’ and skipped across the apartment, Marshy comfortably draped across his shoulders again. “Nine-fifty. You should go down soon.” I wolfed down the last bit of what I was eating, getting to my feet and placing the plate in the sink. Sirius enveloped me in a big hug when I turned around, and I let myself be held, resting my head on his chest. I missed hugs. I missed being here. “I know you don’t want to hear this, Harry,” Sirius whispered.
I found myself at a quiet Lunar Cafe on a Friday evening, utterly charmed by the line of tealights I could see from outside, leading up the stairs to the apartment. Harry pulled the door open with a shy smile on his face, placing several small kisses on my lips as greeting.
“That’s incredible. How did you know that?” Harry grinned, shuffling slightly.
“That was hideous.” I managed to say, my voice rough and tight from crying. My father squeezed my shoulder and said nothing. “I didn’t mean to let that happen.” I apologised without apologising, removing the evidence of my tears.
“Harry!” He replied in kind, folding the front cover over to keep his page. “How are you?” He looked me over, a small crease appearing between his eyebrows. “You look a bit pale.” I smiled sheepishly, rubbing my head nervously.

“This is quite a change from your usual.” He commented, clearing his counter to ring it through. I felt myself flush.
“I’d… Rather you not.” He said softly, smiling at me. I knew masks well, having grown up with politics. Harry’s wasn’t as good as what I was used to.
“Yeah, okay. Let’s go.” I left a tip on the table, tugging my coat on along with Harry, who looked distracted. We started back towards the cafe in an awkward silence. I poked his arm and stuck my tongue out at him when he looked at me. Harry gave me a weird look and looked forward again, a smile coming to his lips. That’s what I wanted. I poked him again, making a ridiculous face at him when he looked back at me. “What the-? Stop!” Harry laughed and bumped into me on purpose, shoving me to the side playfully. I grinned like a demon and pushed him back, Harry taking his hands out of his pockets and pushing me again, staying close to me as we continued walking. I smiled at a girl that walked by, my hand brushing against Harry's. I looked over at him, but he was looking away. It seemed like he hadn't even noticed. I brushed my hand against his again, longer and on purpose, but he didn't even blink. I grinned at him. He was so handsome... I had been thinking about that a lot, how handsome he was. Harry turned those green eyes on me and I felt myself melt...
“Next week, Harry. But that’s
” Remus exclaimed, and then burst into loud, uncontrollable laughter. “He's single! He and Luna are just close friends!" I blushed deeper, running a hand through my hair and looking away.
“Don’t be. You can trust me with anything.” I smiled and hugged him back, squeezing him extra tight. Harry was skinny and bony, but warm. He smelled like cinnamon again, and some kind of masculine body spray. Harry let out a cute grunt, being squished by my sudden rush of affection. “Ugh, my organs are gonna come out my ears.” He rasped into my ear, making me laugh.
