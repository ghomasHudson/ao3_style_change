Draco needed time and Harry did not blame him for wanting it. Both of them stayed silent in each other's arms until Ron and Hermione returned.
"Hmmmm."
Draco reappeared in front of a barren land and paced back and forth. What was happening? How could he have walked out of Hogwarts and right into another dimension because that's what this clearly was. This wasn't time travel because father had always been a business man, not the head auror. This was inter-dimensional travel. But, how was this even possible? Inter dimensional travel was supposed to be a myth!
"STAY FUCKING AWAY FROM HARRY. YOU SNATCHED HIM AWAY FROM ME. HE ALWAYS CHOSE YOU AND WEASLEY OVER ME. FUCKING NOSY IDIOTS." He shouted again and stormed towards a still very shocked Hermione Granger. He pointed his wand out and Harry realized that he would have to act now if he wanted his best friend alive.
"Did – did you lead me to that room that night?" He asked and Ron shook his head "I would rather die than leading anyone to – to that."
"Are you kidding us Draco?" Black starts, his face pale.
"Draco - Draco Malfoy," Draco said honestly and the man's eyes widened in shock and disbelief. Draco took the advantage of his speechlessness and turned around and fled the room. He couldn't apparate from the ministry so he ran as fast as he could, ignoring the polite, "Good morning, Lucius," or "slow down, Malfoy."
There were two more chairs in the room. One was beside him and the other was on the right side of the table. Weasley took the one that was beside him. His jaw was clenched and he pointedly did not look at Draco. Potter did not sit. He stood on the other side of the table and looked at Black. He had broad shoulders and chest and muscled arms. Instead of the uniform, he was wearing a white shirt and black denims. Everything had changed about him. He was no longer a scrawny boy who wore round glasses. He was handsome and was wearing stylish, rectangular frames. There were other changes though that he didn't understand. His eyes were blank, apathetic and his brows were creased in a frown. His face had lost its glow and his lips were set in a straight line. His face gave nothing away, nothing at all.
Petunia's head was pounding and she was suddenly feeling dizzy. Maybe, she was about to wake up but still, nothing happened. Her heartbeats accelerated. This couldn't be real.
"Dr- Draco." He whispered. His voice broke and his panic showed itself. The images of a bleeding Draco swam in his mind. Draco could do anything if he was left alone. Earlier he had tried to hang himself and today he was trying o slit his wrist. How could Harry be their to always protect him?
"So you have already decided, eh?" Hermione scowls at him, "This is completely absurd. Running away is not a solution."
"Malfoy is my mate," she mutters and her simple words shatter whatever peace he had regained by seeing the image of Lily in Potter, "I want you to talk to him. Ask him to reject me. Prejudiced that his entire family is, I know he won't accept me. I'll leave this country with Ariana, Lily and James forever."
"What the actual fuck? That thing-" Weasley hisses.
He did not turn around though because he stunned speechless when he saw his aunt's eyes well with tears. Her face was pale and thin. She was practically a bag of bones. It was like she was not eating anything at all.
Severus spoke in a low voice "Ask Draco about the identity of those who started it, when he is comfortable." Harry nodded and spoke "He will tell me today."
Now, how Ron and Hermione react to this news remains to be seen - especially Ron who really, really despised the Malfoys and probably still does and Ginny of course.
"What?" Draco asked and Harry sighed "Nothing."
The moment, Harry feels the wards shudder, he jumps up. This means that Sirius has taken Draco and Harry has to alert the aurors now. They had planned this in the middle of the night. They had sent Kreacher with letters for Kingsley and Ron. Ron and Hermione had somehow involved their entire family in the plan and so they had a lot of help now. It was almost too easy. Almost because he really did want to know who was waiting for Draco. He hopes it is Ron and one of his brothers. They are the only ones Harry trusts.
"Harriet," Uncle Severus started, "You can enter the castle as a member of the harem only and that too only after you catch the eye of the lord and I am not sure if Lucius still entertains himself or it's only Draco who uses the harem. Do you know what that means?"
"Go and lay down in the guest-room." Potter replies and returns to whatever he was doing. Draco purses his lips and regards him. It seems that he's making a small square shaped table. However, he has no muggle tools except for a few screws and screwdrivers and a tube of something. Maybe it's some kind of glue. His palm is currently placed on the corner of the wooden table where the ends are glued together. He is stroking it. Draco's eyes widen in disbelief.
From the corner of his eyes, he noticed that Draco's fingers trembled on his cup of tea and he placed his hand on Draco's knee gently. The trembling stopped and Draco had rest of his breakfast peacefully.
Five days later found Draco in the lab. The meeting with the delegates had been good. They did not recognise him and he did not recognise them. It was good and he explained the concept to them and gave the samples as well.
"Have you even seen him? He looks like a beast." Draco grits his teeth together. He doesn't want to hear all this again.
Harriet wondered who Ariana was talking. There was just something very final in her tone, something that suggested that she was going to do something about this hatred of hers.
"We don't have to sleep separately." Draco whispers ad Harry shakes his head, "This is not a punishment Draco. How should I explain this to you?"
"Can I just -" Potter cuts off, his right hand carding through his hair helplessly, "I want to comfort you. Can I?"
"I am still sorry." Harry whispered earnestly because saying sorry wasn't enough.
For the first time, Draco slept very peacefully and he pressed a soft kiss on his forehead. "I love you Draco."
He wonders if she knows that.
"This isn't about Ginny. It was her decision. She has her reasons. It's about Harry and the fact that you're the only one who can do this." Weasley mutters in an irritated voice.
Petunia breathed deeply and slowly, whispering, "Harry, say something."
Draco shouting at him for being late ...
"Shall we go right now?" Skeeter asks politely.
"You are - how may times shall I apologize for it. I am trying to explain-"
"Save me the bullshit, Mrs. Malfoy. I am anyways leaving. Go and talk to your coward of a son." Draco practically jumped in shock when Harry barked at him, "Have some decency to dress properly in front of your parents at least. You are not a bloody child."
A few minutes later when Severus has healed Draco's wounds and cleaned the blood, he finally looks at Draco. Draco wonders if the man will answer him now. To his utter disappointment and annoyance, Severus doesn't.
He served for Draco and then he served for himself.
It was next to impossible to express it but he did because he needed to. He felt a bit lightheaded now. He had gotten up and walked towards the window because he could not express it if he Harry was in front of him. Harry's footsteps were so soft that he did not even realize that Harry had walked towards him until his warm hands wrapped around his body. Harry did not say anything. He just placed his face on Draco's shoulders and stood behind him.
"Be here tomorrow at seven thirty."
Sirius shook his head and said, "Like I said, Ron is running a chain of bakeries now and Harry is the finest auror as well as detective we have."
"I know that." Replies Scorpius.
So, it was quite astonishing and alarming to see Fred, George and Neville walk towards them. Harry had been merely eighteen the last time he had met them and he wondered how Draco would react, especially since Harry was still not aware of the identity of the people responsible for whatever they had done to lead Draco. As far as he knew, they could be anyone. From what had slipped Draco's mouth accidently, he could deduce that their were three people.
finish it? We are not even going out. Just because I love you or want you doesn't mean that you have to satisfy me. What- what is going on in your head? I want to understand Draco. What the hell is this?" He hisses sharply.
So he started stroking Draco's hips softly and he wanted to explore them but he knew that Draco needed him so he settled for stroking the skin.
Draco answered politely "Thank you." And Harry just remained quiet, worried about Draco's injuries.
"But I was with you in the initial years of our marriage, Draco." Harry frowned and Draco looked away "But you did not know about my problems. Now you know and support me." His stiffened back loosened when he felt Harry's hand on his lower back. "That I do. Try this. It is delicious."
"Come on Harry. Let's move inside." Dudley said and Harry moved inside the house.
She presses her fingers insistently on his chest and her tear streaked face flashes in his mind. Immediately, he pulls back and stares at her, his chest heaving as he takes deep breathes.
Potter couldn't know. He couldn't. Not that he cares. Potter loves him. He would anyways protect Draco. Draco doesn't care. It doesn't matter. Except that it did matter and Draco did care. If only because he was a little afraid that Potter would refuse to protect him if he knew that Draco had been betraying him all along, that Draco had never loved him.
Severus takes a deep breath and starts, "We can just owl the things to her. Why do you want to visit?"
"What do you want, Draco?" Harry asked and Draco did not answer, so he pushed his fingers inside his pyjamas, waiting for the blonde to snap at him. The reaction that he got was opposite. Draco's trembling stopped.
"Harry. Mate." He heard a voice and did not turn around. It was Ron. "Harry. What happened? Kreacher did not say anything." It was Hermione. Harry still did not turn around. He just stared at Draco. Draco would never laugh again. He would never give him goodnight kisses or scold him for being too messy and irresponsible. Harry's throat was closing and his mind was spinning.
"I'll not pry but you can always count on me. I'm there if you want to talk." She says and smiles sadly at him, "It's okay Harry. I know. Dean told me."
"He belongs to no-one, professor and he never will. I won't let it happen and since he won't listen to me as I am, I believe that the five year old version of myself might be more convincing." She continues, rubbing her wrist nervously.
"What's this smell, Dudley?" she asked curiously, "Didn't Maria come to clean the house yesterday?"
Aunt Sierra bowed her head but Harriet saw her cheeks redden before she did. Harriet looked at uncle Severus. He was staring blankly at her.
Harry removed the shirt and vest and Draco stood in front of him in his trousers, his eyes desperate.
That is why the first question that Harry asks, is, "Where is Draco?" When Lucius doesn't answer he looks at Narcissa who has started crying silently and asks again, "Where is Draco?"
Finally, finally he took a long breath and Harry's arms loosened around him. he noticed that his shirt was wet and looked up. Yes Harry's eyes were wet but he stood strongly in front of Draco. He was Draco's pillar of strength and when he looked into Draco's eyes and spoke "Are you all right Draco?" Draco nodded .
"Underneath a cloak," he said, his teeth gritting.
He was rarely present but when he
"Shut up, Severus." Father snapped and Severus snapped back "You bloody shut your filthy mouth."
"Lucius, James was not just experimenting with you. He was aware that he was a bi."
It is a surprise that she is desperate enough to believe that Harry will marry her. He hides behind a tree and waits for Draco and others to apparate. The aurors arrive one by one and position themselves at different locations waiting for them as well.
Draco struggled nonetheless and Ron just stayed on the floor, looking at Draco in shock.
After breathing deeply with his head stuck out of the window, Draco turned towards him. Harry had not even realized that his fingers were on his cheek. Draco's eyes widened and he walked towards Harry, his eyes guarded.
silver eyes.
"Yes, though you do not need my permission." Draco replied and Harry closed his eyes. Unconsciously, Draco started humming and Harry said "I love your voice."
"The effect that your stupid actions would have on me did not cross your mind even once Harry. I had asked you to stop drinking, hadn't I?" Draco asked furiously.
As such, she doesn't have any energy to take part in the war and she is not very proficient in wandless magic but she does wish to watch the dark lord die and she does wish to help in his death if she can. So instead of using the portkey, she follows Potter, knowing that he would go directly towards the dark lord.
Draco did not answer and Harry felt him wrap his arms and legs tightly around Harry, as if trying to feel Harry all around him.
The aurors enter as well, disillusioned so that they are not visible.
Draco swallowed and looked as Harry lay down and opened his arms to welcome Draco. He went willingly in them, not questioning Harry or his decision.
"Just leave. I don't need anyone's help." Harry snapped at him and he replied "I am bringing our breakfast."
The door opened and Harry still did not open his eyes.
Sirius grins. Skeeter frowns and Sirius smiles some more. He would never forget that day, that day when his little godson turned Lucius's life upside down the man became a prey to Harry's doe-eyed looks.
"Potter." He hears an urgent call behind him and knows just like that that it's Snape.
Albus knows that his last few words are not true. He doesn't correct himself though.
Maybe, this was all a nightmare. That could be the only sane explanation of all this. Yes! Maybe he would wake up and realise that the blast had not even occurred in the first place.
"Draco, listen to me-"
"Okay." He heard Harry's reply and rubbed the side of his neck nervously. He did not know what to tell Harry and what to conceal. He couldn't tell him the whole thing of course or perhaps he should tell everything to him. That way, he will be free of the burden.

Draco looked at him for several minutes and Harry tried to control his temper. Why had he never bothered to encroach the topic? He wanted to slam his head on the wall.
Harry's soft eyes pierced into his soul, as if he knew everything, as if he heard all those unspoken words and feelings of his. He averted his eyes from those mesmerising eyes and turned towards the closed door.
"Draco." Harry murmured and placed his hand on Draco's wandering one. The fingers stopped but Draco didn't look at him.
The biggest thing is that Potter is nowhere to be seen. He can hear soft chuckles that belong to a five year old Harriet but can't see her anywhere. He scowls at no-one in particular. His robes are wet and he hates cleaning clothes magically. Elves do a better job. Magic always spoils the quality of the cloth.
Voldemort sat across them and he did not know why the first thing that he said was, "How do you discipline Draco?"
"Say something," she murmurs, her wings stiff behind her back. Her entire frame is stiff as if she's planning to flee at a moment's notice.
Harry could also see that Draco was sweating. He might be able to hide his anxiety from everyone but Harry had always seen Draco too clearly.
"Just go. I don't wish to talk about it anymore." Severus murmurs adamantly and averts his eyes. Potter leaves and closes the door behind her, her long and curly hair flowing behind her.
It was amusing to see how predictable Albus' passwords were or maybe, she just knew him better than the others which was why she was wondering if this was some kind of plan of Albus. It won't surprise her if it was. She walked past the gargoyles and went up the stairs.
Draco woke up with a jerk and looked around him wildly. He was still in his own house on his own bed. Blindly, he got up and started scrubbing himself all over. When that did not work, he hurried inside the bathroom and jumped inside his tub and turned on the faucet, thereafter increasing the temperature of the water. Draco sat huddled, his knees on his chest and his face on his knees, sobbing.
"Come inside, Harry. Ron." Black said, his eyes hard and Potter did just that.
They had decided to live in Harry's old home in Britain. It was nice to see Draco make plans excitedly for finding the culprits and punishing them.
"What about your lab. You have still not set it up." Harry asked and Draco nodded again, replying "I will do it today."
Draco stared at Harry and then sighed. He did not want to know what the damned letter was about. He smiled sadly when Harry looked at him but did not ask anything. Harry was startled for a second but then he continued speaking and Draco looked at Ron's white face.
"Are you okay?" Asks James and Scorpius nods before replying calmly, "Yes."
He leaned a bit and wrapped his arms around Harry before taking his soft lips in his.
"Hello, Scorpius." Says Ginny. She dislikes both father and uncle Harry. Scorpius often wonders why.
Where Narcissa seems relieved, Lucius seems furious. Severus is quite unreadable and Albus is lost in his thoughts.
"Did you get her checked up by a healer after feeding her the potion?" Draco asked, still facing away from the man.
He would think of something. The bigger concern was the meeting with those blasted delegates that were arriving tomorrow. He was sure that they were the reason Draco had snapped tonight. He had known that they were trouble.
"I have nightmares Harry and I scream and say things that you don't want to know." Draco mumbled and Harry looked at him with soft eyes "I do. Do you think that I sleep while you are in another room tossing and turning and trying to sleep for just a few minutes?"
She is in the middle of the room. He leans against the table and crosses his arms.
"There is no door," Dudley whispered softly, "You killed him. You murdered him in cold blood. He suffocated to death. His screams echoed in this house as he died. Dad and I stood there and watched you pound on this wall as he moaned and screamed and begged to be let out."
Why the bloody hell had he not known?
But then she opens her eyes and he freezes. They are red- they are not just red. They are Voldemort's eyes. But how is it even possible.
"If he wants her to join-" Potter started, his eyes on Weasley only to be cut off by the man, "We don't want her to boss us around and we don't have to agree to everything he says, Harry."
As soon as it ends, Harry storms out, praying silently for Draco to just keep away from him.
"Are you sure about this Harriet?" Headmaster Dumbledore asks, his eyes twinkling behind his glasses. He is wearing a soft smile on his face, one that indicates that he has accepted Harriet's decision. Harriet regards him, wariness shadowing her eyes.
Albus stands up too but Draco's eyes stop him from moving. The man strides gracefully and slowly towards Albus.
"Why would you do that if you don't want to?" He asks sharply. He is not himself right now. His emotions are out of his control. He wants to understand.
He unlocked the door with his key and entered it.
"No, Harry, I was not raped. You don't understand. I was not raped. I am a Malfoy and Malfoys are not weak." Draco's voice was urgent and Harry broke down completely. He started sobbing on Draco's shoulder.
"I want you so much Harry." Draco murmured and bit him hard on the junction of his neck and shoulder. Harry moaned and wrapped his hands around Draco's neck as there lips met again and Draco dominated there kiss, his lips biting and his hands pulling his face the way he wanted.
"Scorpia's age as recorded in the ministry records is sixteen but I don't think that's right. She must be James age. I am fairly certain that she was pregnant when she married. No-one remembers though. No-one cared much about that small detail." Hermione finishes.
It was so silent. Nothing could be heard except his sobs or the ticking of clock.
What she does next is completely a shock. People like to romanticise everything which is why he thinks they like to believe that a veela shows her wings to her mate only. This he knows because Lily was a veela and veelas do not show their wings to just anyone because they know that a veela's wings are priceless potions ingredients. He has always been quite sure that Potter doesn't know that her mother was a veela. She had never seemed to like Delacour much which is why Potter's wings take him by surprise. They're magnificent and but then it's hardly a surprise. He eyes are hard and her lips are pinched in a straight line. Severus can imagine how hard it must have been for her to do this considering the fact that he's a potions master and was once a trained auror.
Silver eyes looked at him desperately before the blonde shook his head and murmured, "Of course not. Why would I want that?"
He helps her to lie on the bed and places her blanket over her.
Draco wonders and lays down on the bed, trying to calm himself down. He doesn't want to sleep but it seems that Severus gave him a sleeping potion. he wants to think about what he saw. But just a few seconds later, his eyes close and he doesn't even realize when he falls asleep.
A flick of Harry's fingers and Draco found himself dressed in a black shirt and pyjamas. On this note, Harry left the room without sparing them another glance.
Father finished his speech and Draco watched him walk down the dais. He was amazed because father's eyes were shining and he could read father very well. Before he could even attempt to do anything, people started clapping their hands and surrounded him. He heard Harry whisper in his ears "I am going to talk to your parents." He nodded and spoke to the press and people who surrounded him. Some of them thanked him and some of them wanted to purchase some potions from him. He gave his card to some and autographs to others.
Suddenly, she is terrified and she wants to leave. But she can't because she has no money and she can't go back home. She needs work desperately and this is the only thing she is good at besides potions.
As soon as she approached him and leaned to look at the measurement cup, the door burst open to reveal a very furious Harry Potter. It was good that his grip was strong because the red potion would have fallen otherwise.
Once he comes out of his shock, he opens his mouth only to be interrupted by a very familiar voice.
Her face is still buried in his stomach and he is still confused by her mood swing.
He knew that Draco would not agree. He did not want to quarrel with the man so he just nodded and spoke softly, crawling out of the bed "Okay. I had thought that it would be good for the duelling academy I wanted to start. I had wanted to announce it at this event. But it's fine if you are not comfortable. We don't have to go."
"Master Draco. What- oh Master Harry-"
Voldemort leaned back and didn't answer. He did not care about Harry Potter. He would go tomorrow and wait until Potter came out after playing at the Dursley house and then he would kill the tiny brat.
She glared at him for a few moments and walked away without giving another reply to him. He stared at her hips as they swayed. They were round and her legs were long and -
He nodded, "I'll start tomorrow then."
"We won the match." The man replies gleefully and his eyes widen and sparkle. James has inherited his love and passion for quidditich and the talent in the sport from Mr. Potter. Albus was never interested in the sport.
Draco opens the door and walks out and turns around to look at Harry. The green eyed man has kept his emotions in control till now but now his face is quite transparent and all the terror is clear on it. He doesn't want Draco to go. Harry has waited long enough for this day but now Draco can see that Harry doesn't want any of this.
Potter was following him. Underneath her cloak. Again. It was as frustrating as it was amusing. Hogwarts was clearly pissed off at him. He wanted to pee and the moment he tried to get inside a bathroom, Hogwarts just closed the door on his face. There was one beyond the seventh floor stairs so he was headed there and of course, Potter was following him, thinking that he was upto something.
They nodded at Draco and Draco continued "I want you to take your leave now and behave as if we never had this conversation. I do not want to investigate anything at all. Thank you and good night."
Draco frowned. They thought that someone was purging purebloods. He stored the information in the back of his mind for later consideration and looked carefully at the green eyed man. He expected Potter to snap and hiss and maybe yell at Black and remind him that Draco was a git and that he would most certainly not be Draco's partner because he hated Draco but Potter said none of that.
With trembling hands, he had a look at the photographs. Draco had never spoken to him about his past and he had always wondered about the reason. When he looked at the photographs, he realized why.
"Yes, in the kitchen. I got back half an hour ago." Draco yelled and Harry tried to control his fury. He was feeling so bloody possessive and he just couldn't bear to see Draco in another person's arms.
She blinked and nodded.
Thoughtfully and slowly, she adds, "There is something wrong with the girl though and I always found Malfoy's abandoning her education odd too. She was ambitious and excellent at potions."
Draco turned to look at him and he almost staggered because Draco's face was red with fury. His silver eyes were burning and he was looking absolutely murderous.
"Kreacher." He called. A lot of years had passed since he had used Kreacher's services.
Harry stared at him and when he turned to look at Dudley, he found the man looking somewhere outside the window, tears streaming down his cheeks, his eyes practically burning with shame.
"Don't you know how to go back," she asked and Dumbledore looked at her from his half moon spectacles. His eyes still didn't give anything away.
He hated crying. He hated being week but Harry always had this effect on him. Why did Harry not understand that Draco would never be the same, that he would never heal.
Harry walked towards Draco with the letter in his hand. Draco was sleeping and he sat beside him.
Sweet Merlin, mum was breaking and now he could hear sobbing. His mother was crying openly. How could he bear it? His parents had held him when he had cried and now it was his responsibility of caring for them.
"What happened?" Black asks and he realizes that he had been staring at the point where Harriet had just been.
"My degrees." He drawls and pushes the folder towards Potter. The man doesn't move to take it.
"Will you stop reminding me? It's been twenty three years. Get over it." He mutters coolly.
"Yes Harry. You are going to start obsessing over Malfoy again, aren't you?" Hermione continues where her husband stops. She is irritated as well.
Draco turned around and smiled at Harry. His smile faltered when he saw Harry's eyes. They were narrowed and they were burning. Something had happened and Harry was angry and Draco froze.
The blonde slammed the door open and shouted at his best friend who had turned red from embarrassment "Just because I whored myself out to you years ago because I did not have money and was misled, you think that you have a right to enter my bath and watch me naked with Harry. Let me tell this to you, Weasley. I have not hurt you for the past decade because you are Harry's friend, not because I have forgiven you. I hate you and your entire family and not because you are blood traitors. "
Harriet breathed deeply and restrained the urge to snap at the man to be polite. Lavender looked put out.
"We'll come tomorrow morning, yeah- at eight." Weasley said casually, "Will that be all right?"
"Tell us god damnit so that atleast we can take precautions."
"Now, ask your questions Draco." He spoke and Draco sat beside him, putting forward his first question "Did you get my letter for giving me the job related to potions in your joke shop?"
He hears a knock and a voice, "Mate." It's Ron and Harry murmurs, "Come in."
"You git. You stupid idiot git. What if you had died?" Draco snapped at him and his eyes were furious. Harry snapped right back "What if you had died Draco?"
"Harry." Draco nudged Harry's shoulders lightly to wake him up. It was time they left for home. Harry's discharge slip had been given to him by Granger. Harry had slept peacefully in his lap all the whole and Granger had told him curtly that Harry had not slept so well in years.
Ron grimaces and mutters, "Could you please not call her by her first name? To answer your question, no, she is not."
He sits up to look properly at her. He wants to understand that why she thinks like this- just because she initiated something, she must complete it, no matter whether she wants it or not- it's ridiculous to even think about. What gave her this idea. Surely, it couldn't be that - that- well that incident with Riddle. She must know how wrong it was.
He yawned again and removed the blanket to get up. That was the moment when his eyes fell upon the tray containing his breakfast. It had a warming charm on it. His heart swelled for Harry. Harry had not been so thoughtful in the initial years of their marriage.
Harry stared and so did Ron. Their expressions were completely similar. They were gaping at Draco, open mouthed and shocked.
They approached the dais and stood in front of it. Draco finally looked at Lucius and Narcissa. Narcissa's eyes were wet with tears, though her face was determined. Lucius was looking sad. He continued when his eyes met Draco's "I am sorry for failing you. My single wrong decision destroyed your past and I am so proud that you did not let it affect your future Draco. You are a strong man and I just- your mother and I am so proud of you. I wish that you would visit your old man and mum. And that's all. I won't take further time of yours. Please enjoy your night."
Draco sighed and replied "Ministry will issue burn on sight orders if I don't supply my potion to them."
Draco couldn't stop once he started. Harry was delicious and warm and strong and Draco wanted him so badly. He pulled Harry's hair and bit his lower lip angrily. The git had to fight with him. How dare he talk about dying so casually? He pulled back and glared at Harry before biting his neck almost viciously.
From the corner of his eyes, he peaked to check whether mum dad had left but they were still their and he couldn't control himself from looking into Harry's eyes desperately. He was ashamed of himself and though father said that they weren't, he knew that he would never be able to look them in their eyes.
"I wanted to ask you whether you know that we're in some other dimension. It's 2001 and my father is the head auror."
"Thank you." He whispered and Dudley whispered "I am sorry, Harry. No matter how many times I apologise, I know it will always be less."
"The bag has a wand. She said in the wetter that cousin Dudwey is a wizard." Says the child before taking out a toy wand from the bag.
He places his hands on either sides of her waist.
How could Sirius Black return at a time like this? Everything happened too fast after that.
Snape smells nice although nowhere close to Malfoy but Harry is desperate. He doesn't wish to go to hunt.
With time, he would heal Draco's wounds. It would take time, but it would be worth it.
"You won't dare," Albus said, his eyes huge.
Petunia rests her head on the wall and closes her eyes. It's time to say goodbye to her little sister now. Maybe she can do for Harry what she couldn't do for his mother.
It had been his job and he had been paid for it.
The door closed quietly, so quietly that Sirius did not even hear it.
"You are not listening to me. Calm down. Take a deep breathe and listen to me properly Draco." Harry whispers, his green eyes boring into Draco's, "I love you. I loved you even when we got separated and I will always love you, till my last breathe. I want you to - to take the first step Draco when you feel like taking it not because I want you to."
"Over the past year, I have come upon a decision Ms. Potter. I won't interfere in Severus's decisions. If he says that it's okay, then it is okay. I won't intervene unless you require me to. Severus won't take it kindly if I defy his decisions where you are concerned. He is already very disappointed over the fact that I let you live with Lily's sister. Disappointed is the wrong word I guess. He is still very furious over it and I don't think he is going to forgive me anytime soon." Headmaster finishes.
Mother cleared her throat uncomfortably and murmured "Your elf let us in. He was frightened so-"
Granger couldn't have chosen a worst time to arrive. She knocked the door and he flicked his wand to open the door. To say that he was irritated to see her would be an understatement. Her greeting was just an icing on the top of his fury.
"I forgive you." Harry said, his eyes somewhere ahead and he realized that he had in fact forgiven them for everything they did to him and perhaps he was like that, he was like his mother. His mother never held grudges. This he knew from what Severus had told him.
They turn to look at him. Harry studies them.
He hadn't thought that he would get attached to this little child and he hadn't wanted to get attached. He can't afford it. Of course, fate had something else in store for him. Severus will never understand why Harry's not afraid of him. Weasley's children tremble and hide whenever they come across Severus. Only Draco isn't afraid of him and that's because Draco's not afraid of anyone.
Harry walked towards him and Draco's feet froze. He did not want to run off. No, he wanted Harry to – to -. He just wanted relief. It was all too much. He wanted a reassurance that Harry was his and that he loved Draco even though Draco did not deserve him at all.
Fuming angrily, he took out a parchment and penned down a fresh order of his drinks.
But Harry couldn't stop. He wanted to. He wanted to stop so very desperately but he couldn't control his hands that squeezed Draco's arse or his teeth that sunk into Draco's neck.
"What will you do if I do? I will say it a thousand times, not that you care. I have ordered again and I will order as many times I want to." Harry mocked him.
"I am Scorpia Malfoy." She says and Harry feels faint- not because she is different no- but because she has Voldemort's eyes and is Malfoy's daughter and Malfoy has been behaving weirdly ever since Voldemort died.
What does he want? Harry wondered and knew that he won't get any answer from Draco even if he asked.
." Ron points out and Harry opens his mouth to protest but Hermione doesn't let him speak.
In the matter of seconds, Blinky had brought two buckets full of water and they poured the water on Draco's head. Draco screamed and cried and moaned and begged them to stop. Harry was trying to control himself. It was hard but he was trying.
On this note, Draco pulled Harry in his arms and Harry's breath hitched as he wrapped his hand around Draco's neck and his legs around his hips.
Potter nods quietly.
"I certainly did not," Draco muttered, rolling his eyes, "Just - all that groping and manhandling had unsettled me. You have to admit that she doesn't seem very comfortable right now and she had not seemed comfortable then."
He opened the door and their was Draco, standing near the kitchen table, attempting to slit his wrist with the biggest knife of their kitchen. His heart raced and his wand clattered on the floor. His eyes shot wide open.
"Mas- Master Harry. Oh- oh no."
Tears stream down her cheeks and his eyes rove form her face to toes.
"No, Hermione. He is right. I should have stopped you all those times I let you and Ron speak between us. Please leave." He whispered, his eyes on Draco whose anger melted a bit.
Severus sighed " I can't tell you. I have heard that Minister O' Dmello is hosting a party in a couple of days and is going to invite Draco and you. I am quite sure that he will invite some important people from Britain as well. Stay with Draco. That's all I can say. "
"You will bring his wrath on our heads. He will kill us."
"Draco." He murmured desperately and Draco moved. Before Harry even knew what was happening, Draco had moved close to him and was kissing him urgently. His hands were on Harry's cheeks and Harry's eyes shot wide open as they met Draco's.
"Let's lock the wards and apparate." Harry said.
"Your body won't be able to bear so much alcohol, Harry. You have to stop it. It has been four years." She continued and placed another vial on his lips. He dutifully drank the potion again before replying "How did you find me?"
"Then don't get caught. Anyways, I am giving you a portkey. As soon as you are alone with Draco tomorrow morning, activate it and it will take you straight to The three broomsticks. Do it tomorrow otherwise I am -"
In the past, Harry had winced and glared at him accusing him of being possessive but Harry just melted in his arms, letting him do as he wished.
Draco closed his eyes and tried to breathe. His mental stupor was interrupted by an impatient tapping.
Draco holds his breath, knowing that they're at a distance of only two feet. Any moment, they will turn around the corner and find him and then they will either kill him or take him to Burbage.
Draco opened the huge door of the great hall and stood at the doorway. The hall, now, had several circular tables spread instead of the four house tables. Before he could lament over the fact that Hogwarts would never again be a place where students could come and study, a loud laugh caught his attention. He turned his head slowly towards the source of the sound. As expected, it was coming from the table that was currently occupied by the Weasleys. All the Weasleys sans Arthur and Molly were there and not surprisingly, they were now dressed in expensive dress robes and were donning high-priced jewellery. Arthur and Molly were sitting with Dumbledore and Longbottom's grandmother on a separate table. They had their backs towards their children.
Her eyes become damp and his heart goes out to her. She is in so much pain but atleast she is still alive behind all that darkness.
Ginny doesn't say anything so he follows Albus out of the house, knowing that this is a wild goose chase. But, he had promised uncle Harry and father that he'll always take care of Albus, that he'll never leave him alone and it happens that he loves Albus and does want to find them. They have been exchanging letters with them ever since they disappeared and he wants to meet both of them in person.
He had simply stared in the fire and thought about Harry. It had been his mistake. Harry was right. Draco needed to move on and forget his past and for that he needed revenge. Letting them go unpunished would be accepting defeat and living with the humiliation and he couldn't do that. He couldn't live with the feeling that he had been manipulated into selling his body. He was a capable wizard and could have done something else to earn money but they had taken advantage of his helplessness.
"I thought that I do not deserve him." Draco argued softly and Severus snapped at him "Who gave you the right to decide that? He loves you and you love him and that's it. Get your act together before it is too late to change anything."
"Harry, we are leaving. I just wanted ot say that I am your friend as well, Draco. Please don't ever think otherwise." Ron spoke from outside the closed door and Draco murmured "Okay." He was not ready to talk to Weasley and did not pressurise himself. Harry kissed his forehead and whispered "Go to sleep." before accioing a book and he closed his eyes.
"Harry. I am fine. Please calm down." Draco repeated and a laugh bubbled low in his throat. He laughed hard and loud. He must have looked mad, laughing with fury in his eyes because Draco's eyes shot wide open in alarm. Draco was asking him to calm down. How does one calm down when he returns home to find his love, his life trying to kill himself?
The next question was put to Neville "I owled you and requested you to give me the job of tending to your greenhouses. Did you get my letters?"
"You- You- You bloody interfering-" Harry started and Draco just sneered at him. And then he walked towards the wardrobe of his drinks and took all the bottles one by one and dropped them on the floor.
Harry's heart was thundering and he saw red when he thought of the person who had probably written this letter. All he wanted was to confront that vile, bastard, bloody swine. But he would wait for Draco to come around because that's what Draco needed.
"Oh - oh no. Dudley," Dudley gasped, getting up, "I asked him not to go there again."
His eyebrows rose when he saw Harry sitting on his bed, his legs crossed, still in his night clothes, looking at his hand, looking vulnerable and small.
Dudley placed both his hands on the wall and closed his eyes and his hands sparkled but nothing happened. Petunia could taste the smell now. She wanted to back in time and wondered if she should just sleep and then she would be back there.
In a matter of three seconds, Harry had stood up and pointed his wand on Ronald and Hermione. In another second they were tied up.
Harry opened his mouth and then closed it again.
"We will be there for you. Please. We have to put him behind the bars."
Why was he always too late? He should never have Draco alone. Why did he leave Draco alone?
Licking his lips, he cautiously touched Draco's shoulder with his fingers and waited for the man to snap at him. The reaction that he received was shocking. All of a sudden Draco turned around and jumped in his arms. Harry was surprised but wrapped his arms around Draco's waist willingly. Draco wrapped his legs around Harry as well and started sobbing in his neck.
That voice said again. Petunia ignored it and finally - finally it came into view - it, being a wall. The cupboard wasn't there. It was like a wall had been built around it. There was no wood - only cement.
Harry pulled his hair in frustration and concern before continuing, "Stop defending me."
"No Potter. That's not how it works. You know me." He replies and Harry grimaces. It would be so easy to just give in and feed. He can use his lure and seduce Snape. He can make Snape love it. Before Snape fell for his godfather, the man allowed it. It was convenient.
stay there and you
"I tried to talk to you about him. But you didn't listen to me." Ginny continues. With a jerk, Harry realizes that he had scolded Ginny very harshly when she had attempted to talk to him about Draco.
P.S. Do look at those photos. He is quiet sexy, eh? Have you tried binding him and spanking his bottom with a stick? It's a great turn on, I have heard. Also, do try fucking him with a knife before you send him back to Britain. I have heard that he screams and cries beautifully.
He ignored it and started speaking "Harry. I want to tell you everything. I want to tell you the reason due to which I entered in prostitution at the first place. I am tired of keeping secrets from you Harry."
"I know and I sympathize but that does not mean that Harry should waste his life over Malfoy. Ginny was good for him and she has married but there are lots of women who would want to marry him. He slapped me the other day and he is always shouting at me. You don't care at all that he slapped."
"Leave me alone." Dad says blankly and continues staring at the opposite wall, "Send Scorpius inside."
Dad cuts mom off with a coldly murmured, "Is it too much to expect him to stay out of my mind, then?"
"Aunt Petunia."
"She had accomplices Draco. We need to investigate their identities." Harry said and Draco shook his head "I don't want to know. I don't want revenge."
Harry nodded and turned around to look at the gathered crowd. He spoke strongly "Kindly return to enjoying the party and give Draco and his family some privacy." He avoided his godparents who simply squeezed his shoulders and left him with a mumbled "Please meet us when you can find some time."
Meanwhile, Ron continues, "I will have you know that none of the Weasleys or our extended family hate Scorpia or even Malfoy. We forgave her when Harry spoke to us about his reasons for speaking in her favor at the trials."
"All right then. All right." Sirius mutters and walks forward to stand behind Snape whose hands are still digging in Harry's shoulders. They are keeping Harry grounded. Harry knows that he would have apparated by now if Snape had not stopped him like this.
The gate opens after Albus touches it with his wand. Albus walks inside. Draco is an expert legilimens. He is an unrelenting, intimidating, attractive older man and Albus is afraid that his eyes might let on the desperation he is feeling.
Thank you.
"Mr. Malfoy, can I have a word with you."
"All right Potter. If you really must do so, bring your godmother and tell this to her. I won't have her murder me in cold blood because I won't leave her goddaughter well enough alone because of something she did with James more than a decade ago." Severus mutters and Potter opens his mouth to argue, her eyes irritated. Severus doesn't let her utter even a single word and continues, "No arguments on this. Take it or leave it."
"Your protests were weak. Perhaps you have forgotten me Draco due to our separation but I haven't. I know when you mean it and when you don't. Just- just drop it, all right. Don't lift your hand at me ever again. I will keep away from you. I should have gotten used to not being able to touch you but I guess I haven't. My bad. Good night." Harry muttered and closed his eyes. The door to their bathroom slammed shut which meant that Draco was angry too.
Green eyes search his face for something. James is slightly taller than Scorpius and is more muscled and handsome.
He sneers at her and mutters, "Bitch."
Draco stared at the spot Harry had just stood on wondering about the man. Each and every gesture of his dripped his love for Draco.
"Spinner's end." He murmurs and a moment later Snape's blank face flickers in front of him. It's like he is going backward- looking younger and handsome as the days pass. A delicate eyebrow is raised and his eyes are as dark and cool as ever.
He had just undressed when the he heard a knock and a soft voice "Harry."
As soon as she was finished, Draco asked "So, Tessa, tell me about your grandfather."
"Goodbye." Harry says and smiles to himself as the boy leaves.
But as Harry stares at the smirking face, the face morphs and right in front of him, he changes into one of those Lestrange brothers. Harry stares before whirling around. He almost stumbles in shock when he finds the other brother standing in front of him with Bellatrix.
"Please, turn it back so that we can bury him properly," he said and Petunia didn't really understand why Vernon was so calm about this when he was obviously horrified and unhappy and pained.
He realized that he had fallen in love with Draco all over again. He had fallen in love with Draco's little smile, his bright eyes, his humour, his softness, his understanding, his kindness, his everything. He realized that he couldn't bear to live without Draco ever again. He had not taken their relationship to a higher level. It was too soon and he wanted Draco to set the pace.
when that happened. Why are you lying? If Harry was a freak, then so are you," Vernon hissed, "He was a wizard, not some freak." His nostrils were flaring and he was breathing heavily. But, he wasn't yelling as he usually did when he was angry. Petunia didn't say anything. She waited for this nightmare to end. Anytime now, she would wake up because this was not real.
"Okay. Top secret." Harriet nods vigorously, placing her finger on her lips.
"Pwease, Mr. Maw- no - Mr. Ma-l-foy. Pretty pwease." Requests Harry and then Draco turns to look at him and makes a very politely worded request, "I would ensure that he doesn't hurt the peacocks, father. Can I take him? Father plllleasssee."
Vernon's jaw dropped and he stared at her before his lips twisted into an ugly grimace and he snapped at her, "Lily Potter
TAP. TAP. TAP. TAP TAP TAP TAP TAP.
She stretches her legs, turns on her back and waits for him.
But there was no other alternative. He couldn't let them be burnt. He couldn't take it on his conscience. It was a few seconds later that he heard a knock on the door.
Perhaps it was the faint tremble in Draco's words or perhaps it was just that Something was stopping Harry from leaving Draco alone, that compelled Harry to ask "What time did you say I should be back?"
He shook his head, muttering, "Never-mind. Tell your brat that I'll quiz him on what I taught him last time," and before Lucius could answer, Voldemort apparated. He only cared about killing Harry Potter. THAT WAS IT. Yet, he couldn't get his silent weeping, scratches -
"Then, why don't you just move on? When you know that he would never be back, what is the point of waiting for him?" She asked and he looked at his hands. It was not something he did not know himself. The duelling academy in which he trained students had asked him to attend once a week. Not that he blamed them. He was almost always having a hangover.
"Yes. They are Voldemort's eyes." Hermione whispers and Ron nods too.
"Father knew." She mumbles so softly that he almost doesn't hear. When her words finally register in his mind, everything starts becoming clear to him.
She got out of her bed and tip toed towards her door. It won't do to alert the enemy that she had woken, that is, if someone
They were moving photographs and Draco was bleeding and screaming hoarse in each of them. He was being fucked bareback in one of them and in one he was being fucked by a knife, Blood was trickling down his legs and his eyes welled.
"Dare not explain my limits to me, you pathetic excuse for a father."
"I didn't know that he had taken you. Had I known, I would never have let him do that. I would have died but won't have let him do that."
"I was five but I remember his words very clearly. He promised to be good. He promised to obey you and not as- ask for extra food or water. He only wanted to be let out. He wanted the pain to end," Dudley stopped. His voice was shaking so much, "Was it too much for you to feed a five-year-old? He was your sis-" Dudley sniffed before continuing, "-sister's son. He was my cousin and you lied to me. He died believing that his cousin hated him enough to let him die. You said that he was freak and bad and evil and I trusted you since five-year-olds trust their parents."
"What would I ever do without you, Draco?" Harry asked and Draco teased "What indeed. "
Severus knows what's going to happen a second before it does. Harry's eyes become huge and sparkle. Yes they sparkle and he sticks his lower lip out and then crosses his arms before saying, "But mom wrote me a letter. I showed it to you. She wants me to give all those things to her and she wants me to give that toy wand to Dudley."
Potter snarls at him, cutting him off very effectively, "Our desires were never similar. It was not what I wanted. Your horcruxes have been destroyed Tom."
Harry looked at Hermione and she looked at him. He shook his head dismissing the apology that her eyes had. She sighed before continuing "I understand. Now, though, you can just come to me for help. You don't have to feel shy and I won't tell Harry if you don't want me to. I think I will need to examine the rest of your body before prescribing medicines.
"Oh, and you are singing love songs for me, eh? That's rich, coming from you." Aunt Sierra snapped at him although she didn't look back. It was a surprise. A pleasant one and Harriet looked at both of them with relief.
As much as he tries to appear confident and arrogant, Scorpius knows that James isn't really very confident and he only knows that because he has spent a long time in studying Mr. Potter.
Finally, her gaze stops at Sirius whose hands are tied as well and yells, "You bastard. You dare double cross me."
"Damnit. Got to lose weight- can't even run properly- he is in so much pain." Harry would have stared at the man in shock if he were able to.
Draco looks at the green eyed boy who is looking too calm, too collected, not even close to the boy who had literally scolded her yesterday night. It takes a good few seconds to realize that Draco herself is not calm. The mere memory of his slimy hands on her hair is enough to make her throw up.
." Hermione's hiss attracts several eyes. He had wanted to have a quiet breakfast.
"She said that you hate her, that the entire Weasley family hates her and her mother." Harry gets straight to the point.
"But lord Burbage said-" Corner murmurs and Draco wants to slap his face hard. He resists the urge though because it won't do him any good to confront them when he is so injured.
Weasley walked towards them and sat on the nearest chair available, looking at him "How is Harry?"
"Hey, mister, can you give me some money?" Malfoy said suddenly and brought a hat from somewhere behind him and placed at Harry's feet before continuing politely, "Scorpius is hungry. He hasn't eaten anything for two days now and he has fever. I need medicines. Can you also tell me what medicines should I get him? I do not remember anything."
She ignored it.
She couldn't say so, though. She just levitated Harry's bleeding body with gently and whispered "Draco. you have to get up and take rest." He did not reply, just continued looking at the blood and their was no time to talk to him so she mumbled in concern "Ron will arrive with Snape shortly." and then hurried towards the master bedroom.
"Father, did you join the death eaters because-" Draco started and Lucius cut him off sharply, "That is none of your business."
Draco just swallowed because he couldn't speak. His heart was racing. Harry was too close to him. Their lips were touching and Harry's eyes were so soft. "I was just startled by the sudden moment." Draco lied and Harry caressed Draco's cheeks. Then Harry sucked his lower lip and Draco couldn't prevent a soft moan from slipping his lips. Harry's teeth dug in his lower lip and Draco slumped in Harry's arms, wrapping his arms around Harry's waist.
He walked very slowly and stood behind Draco "Draco." He whispered and Draco's hand trembled.
After they separated and Harry finally realized his mistake, he wrote to Black, Lupin and him. Though he forgave Harry, Black and Lupin didn't, not completely atleast.
Perhaps, then Draco would realize that he is not the only one who is broken.
Just before Scorpius leaves, the boy stops at the entryway and looks at him for a few moments. He doesn't say anything but his eyes speak a lot. Unlike Malfoy, who said many things and meant none of them, Scorpius is a man of few words.
His house is modest with three bedrooms, one sitting room and an average-sized kitchen. Bedrooms are on the first floor. It's dimly lit and there are windows that stay closed with curtains over them. There is a small fireplace in the sitting room which is only used for communicating with Snape. No-one in the wizarding world except him knows about Harry being alive. Harry snorts at the thought.
These words rang in his mind over and over and he turned to look at Draco. Draco was not sleeping. His eyes were open and tired as if he had not slept at all.
Harry had also said the same vows and he had not fulfilled them. He had broken his promise. He had not paid attention to Draco. He had not loved him enough. He did not deserve Draco at all.
He will wait inside if that's the case. But when he opens the door and meets crazed eyes of Draco Malfoy, his feet freeze.
"Calm down." he murmured and walked towards Draco. He was trembling with fury. It had been years since he had felt such fury coarse throughout his body. "CALM DOWN. BLOODY CALM DOWN." He screamed at the blonde and pulled his hair frantically. "JESUS CHRIST." He shouted and slammed his hands on the slap.
This meeting- she wants to ask some things from father. She wants to know why he did what he did. She wants to know if she ever meant anything to him. She is waiting by the window, settled on a rocking chair, staring at the gloomy sky. It's raining today morning and although Draco loves this weather, today she just feels sad.
Draco narrows his eyes before replying indignantly, "I'll have you know Potter that brewing is still my passion and I've been doing it even if I didn't use the art to earn money. I didn't need to work before now."
Draco shook his head again when there eyes met and Harry bowed his head, mumbling, "I have apologised before and I apologise again."
She stares at the beheaded body in front of her. It's over.
He hiccupped and wiped his eyes. He did not want to meet them. It was possible that one of them knew and they would take him back. He did not want to go back.
Draco's eyes widened in shock when he heard Harry's heartfelt words. He said softly "You were not the only one at fault. You have your own ghosts of past, Harry and I did not try to know. I was so engrossed in myself that I did not talk to you about you at all."
Harry wonders what the matter really is. There is no dark lord and Lucius is anyway not dark now. He is running many orphanages and hospitals. He burned the manor down and built it from scratch. Harry has never been inside but it's rumored to be the most beautiful house in Britain. It's rumored to have innumerable windows and paid house elves. Harry doesn't understand why Scorpia and Malfoy are not happy. Nott was a git but he wasn't evil.
"He never let me know that you wanted to court me. I never knew. Had I known, I would have asked for help." She murmurs.
"Come on, you git. Your father is waiting for us, glaring at ceiling and muttering to himself." Ron smirked and Draco glared at him, "Don't talk like that about my father."
Black cut him off with a calmly spoken, "I didn't say that he isn't an auror. He does have a chain of bakeries, Draco. You can ask him."
"Draco, are you quite all right?" asked Pansy, her palm resting gently on his forehead, "we wondered where you disappeared after the meeting."
" I am not supporting him, Draco. Do what you must. Please do not do anything illegal. I would rather have you with me than in prison. " He muttered in defeat and Draco glared at him before dressing both of them with a whispered spell.
"Aunt-" He started and she shook her head. It must have been uncomfortable sitting like this for her. But she did not even move.
He felt like vomiting and the letters and photos slipped from his hand as he rushed to the bathroom.
Draco ran out when Severus cursed loudly and creatively. He loved teasing Severus.
She nodded and replied "It's okay. You are forgiven."
The voice belongs to her father. She spins around and points the sword at her father.
"Very well, then I will start. Years ago, when I was in my fourth year, I fell for your father. We had a secret relationship and met each other at night. I never told him that I loved him because he did not love me. I still don't know what his purpose of going out with me was but then he fell for Lily and told me so. I told him that it's okay and that we can stop our meetings and he just nodded and left." Lucius's voice was flat and his eyes towards the fireplace again, his legs apart and his hands joined. Everyone sans Remus was shocked.
there, he was serious all the time and never gave any preferential treatment to Albus, James or Lily. They were equal in his eyes. The fact that Scorpius was the son of the man who tormented him for seven years didn't change anything. Try as they might, neither Scorpius nor Albus ever understood him. Till date, they don't know what really happened between Uncle Harry and father. They had never seen eye to eye and argued a lot. In fact, they used to shout at each other quite a lot when they thought that the kids were sleeping. Then when they turned eleven and went to Hogwarts, they just disappeared. Both have been sending letters to them but they never came back. They gave their custody to Teddy who was sixteen at that time and could take their custody since he had a job and earned well.
She feels a hand on her shoulder and a whisper, "Draco."
"Dumbledore needs to be here to listen to this. I have wasted enough time. Please request his presence too." She murmurs and Granger walks out of the room wordlessly.
Vernon was still not looking at her. In fact, he was trying hard not to look at her. Dudley was just frowning at his plate. He was lost in his own thoughts. The smell was so strong over here. It was so - so - it was of rotting flesh or maybe, rotten eggs. Her heart was not calming down and her head had started pounding now.
He had never known that Harry loved him so much. He had always had a
Noone makes a sound. It's like everyone is frozen in time.
It's quite dark but her silver gaze is fixed on him. Her face is expressionless. She doesn't trust him which is quite understandable.
Warnings: An instance of assault. It starts with ** and ends with **. You can skip it if you want.
"What happened , Kreacher?" He asked and Kreacher stammered "An owl brought a letter for the master but master should not read it."
"Harry." For a few moments, he was confused as to who would call his name. The voice was not recognizable at all. He turned around and his cup almost fell from his hand when he saw his aunt Petunia standing at a few feet from him. He turned to look at Dudley but the man was literally gaping at his mum.
Taken aback, potions master Draco stumbled. His face became red. Draco had searched his dragon for years and mother had told him just last month that she had found it in her wardrobe and he had taken a huge risk by assuming that the man in front of him was also searching for the lost toy. It was worth it though because Draco took advantage of the potion master's embarrassment and opened the door and after a last glance at Harry Potter who was torn between laughing and gaping, he took the step out and closed the door behind him and was utterly, utterly relieved to find himself in his own room. Blaise was sitting on his bed, playing chess with Pansy.
"I'll go and bring him back." These were Harriet's first words and uncle Severus wasn't surprised that she had gotten straight to the point. Jameson was five years younger to her and William was a child. That left her because uncle Severus would have to ascend the throne in father's absence.
"That's anyone's guess." She says.
Draco decides to answer honestly, "Father kicked me out when I refused to marry. I was studying for my potions mastery."
"Now, let's get ready. They have done their share of the work. It's our turn now. Back then, Draco you were a boy who was lost and frightened but now you are a successful potions master and have been invited to Britain by Kingsley himself, the judge who gave the judgment to banish you from here. Not just Britain, but various ministries have been owling you to live in their country. Always remember that there are people who would fight for you if you disappear. Remember that your duelling skills equal mine and that no one can overpower or control you now." Harry whispers, Draco's hands in his and Draco breathes before murmuring, "Okay."
"I am sorry Mr. Malfoy." Harry replied, his eyes full of wonder. Father flicked his finger and the ring was invisible again.
"Draco." Father whispers and she ignores him. Blood is still fresh on the corner of her lips and her cheeks are still red from his slaps. A madness overwhelms her and she conjures some nails and a hammer. The dark lord's eyes widen and this time Severus murmurs, "Draco... think before-"
"I love Black- you know-
"But I don't need-" Draco started and Harry cut him off, his voice an octave higher "We are still seeing him." The blankness of Harry's green eyes had transformed into fury. Draco's heart beats sped up and he tried to hold Harry's hand, shifting a bit towards him before mumbling softly, "Harry, I-" but Harry pulled back rudely with a curt, "Do not touch me."
Potter stares at him, her eyes unreadable and licks her dry lips. Draco glowers at her.
"I can't- can't let him hate me. Can't." Draco mumbled to himself.
Harriet followed Malfoy as Parkinson sat with Hermione and Zabini sat between the twins so the only chair remaining was beside Malfoy. It was satisfying to watch Zabini give the twins the taste of their own medicine. The twins were straight. At least, as far as Harriet knew, they were. Of course, they had very little space for her between them and had left no scope for themselves to shift and make more space. Zabini wrapped both his arms around their waists. It was quite hilarious to watch their red faces.
He swallows a couple of times and then breathes hard to stop another bout of tears. He shouldn't cry. He should be the one to comfort Draco. If he will start crying, then who will be there for her.
"Tell me." Harry pressed and she shook her head again. He was about to ask again when he felt Draco squeeze his forearm. His silver eyes asked him to let him handle this and Harry nodded.
"Harry. We have to leave now. You can sleep at home." He said and Harry opened his eyes to look sleepily at him "Are you coming? I can't walk properly for two months"
"Will you take us away?" She asked and extended her small hand towards him.
She kissed his small nose before saying, "I need to go and bring father back."
Draco tried again when Harry did not speak "Should I bring something? Tea and biscuits, perhaps?" but Harry just shook his head again.
"Yes." Says Lucius.
Dudley didn't stay anything. His eyes became hard. Petunia swallowed.
Scorpius blinks a few times and focuses back on the man sitting in front of him.
She backs off and hides behind Potter.
"It wasn't me. I- it must have been someone else polyjuiced as me." He stutters but his body is trembling and his eyes are still terrified.
Harry looked at him as if he had grown another head, "Me. Wrong with me Draco. What's wrong with you. You burn yourself and are unconscious for four days. When you finally wake up, you start - start-. Can you even imagine what I went through. It's very easy for you, isn't it? Trying to commit suicide again and again. After all, your husband is always there to save you. You just have stay to unconscious during the period. You were burning. Your skin had peeled off and you were red and you were bleeding and you were crying and screaming and moaning and shaking and I was falling apart Draco. You were the one who was burnt but I was the one who went through the pain. You were given numbing potions when you lost consciousness. You were not there to see what I went through. You just-"
However, Harry is already standing up, "I told Ginny before she left for her detention. I'll see you later."
Kreahcer trembling figure came in and the elf was pulling his ears. He asked, a bit startled "What happened?"
"Harriet, we will talk about this." Black's voice is softer then Severus's and Lucius looks at Draco to find him still frozen in shock. He is still looking at the kid's face.
Granger's and Weasley's divorce that had occurred two years ago had come as a shock to everyone. Draco, however, who had witnessed and envied the golden trio and their strong friendship had been absolutely stunned when they had divorced and given the statement that their relationship had died twelve years ago. They had lived together for their children.
"How is it even possible? Voldemort was busy searching the elder wand-`1"
Draco breathed and his throat clenched as he looked at the woman. For just a moment, he could see Lily Potter in the woman and he could simply stare as she spoke her next words "I- we are sinners. I should have ensured that Harry had a happy childhood and god is punishing me for it. Dudley tortured his cousin and now he has to live with the fact that his won father tortured his daughter for god knows how many years. So you see, Mr. Malfoy-Potter, it is circle. As you sow, so shall you reap. Those who tried to destroy you, those who hurt you will be punished, just like my husband will be, at your hands. I just hope that you would find a family in me and Dudley as well, with time. It seems that you have already accepted Tessa. We will wait for that day."
"When did they monopolise me? When did they snatch me away from you?" He whispered and gently took his wand away from his hand and kept it back in his pocket. Of course, Hermione had to intervene.
"Potter, he really didn't mean any harm to you," Blaise murmured quietly, "he- we thought that you were feeling uncomfortable that's why he intervened."
Draco opened the window and let the owl in. It held a wrapped invitation and Draco realized at once that it was an invitation to the ministry party. The owl flew off after giving the invitation to him.
"Do you plan on staring at me all night Potter?" Even his way of speaking has changed over years. He still drawls of course but his voice softer now and devoid of his trademark arrogance.
Severus and Black are quiet and even Draco's quiet. He's only staring at Harry. Lucius wants to ask his son about his supposed hatred for 'stupid Potter' and 'stupid Potter's stupid green eyes'.
"You will get an infection. It is possible that you already have an infection. How can you so irresponsible and unhygienic? " Draco stopped and looked at him questioningly.
Granger's mouth dropped open in shock and she stuttered "What do you mean? I –"
Narcissa's face drenched with tears and Lucius's haunted eyes turn towards him and a dread settles down in the pit of his stomach. Narcissa crawls... she literally crawls towards Severus and kneels in front of him on her knees. That's when he realizes that something is wrong with his goddaughter, that Lucius has done something again.
Draco looked around to check if father and mother were here and they were there, sitting beside the window, sharing a pudding. Smiling to himself, he headed towards Granger's table with Pansy and Blaise. Granger looked up from her lunch. There were deep dark circles underneath her eyes. He waited for the request to sit at some other table. She was obviously busy, judging from the papers spread on the table.
"It's-" Aunt Sierra cleared her throat and looked at Harriet with red cheeks, "It's not a sacrifice. I love him."
But, then Harry's soft sobs had reached his ears and the fact that his godson was still alive had registered in his mind. He had turned his eyes towards the crib in which Harry was standing with his hands on the bars. He was crying and his huge green eyes were staring at him. Sirius had stood up and gone to his godson. It was like the child was calling him although he could only cry and stare at him at that time.
"I want to visit the Mawfoys." Harry's the picture of innocence with his doe-eyed look and polite voice.
"YOU BASTARDS. HOW DARE YOU?" He shouted at them. It was obvious that Longbottom and twins were shocked into silence. "YOU BLOODY BACKSTABBED ME. YOU- YOU- I WILL-"
He turned around to find Petunia Dursley looking at him with horrified eyes and Dudley looking at the ceiling, ashamed. Tessa was simply sitting on the sofa, her eyes on her lap, her shoulders shaking a little. She was crying soundlessly again. This gesture infused a spark of cold fury inside him. A small girl should not have to hide her pain like this. She should not hide her fear just because others would feel that she is dirty or week.
"I was frightened and my accidental magic came to my aid, blasting him to the opposite wall. He ran away and - and then he tried again after a couple of days. This time I was sleeping and it was early morning. He entered and removed my blanket and then removed my pajamas. I was fast asleep. His cold hands woke me up and I tried to struggle but he was stronger and pinned me and spanked my hips hard before biting my left hip and trying to insert fingers inside by anus again but I blasted him apart again. That is why I used to lock my bath room and bed room. One night he tried to mix something in my juice so that I lose consciousness but I did not drink it. That is why I always check when offered anything from anyone. He tried many times and then I came to Hogwarts and he was afraid after that. Once I was preparing breakfast in the kitchen and he spanked by bottom hard before squeezing my hips. I glared at him and he backed off, scared of my magic. I -" Draco was not lying on the bed anymore. He had sat up straight and hugged Harry tightly "Why did you never tell me? Sweet Merlin. Did he ever, ummm do that?"
"Perhaps you should have, Severus. I MADE YOU HIS GODFATHER FOR A REASON. YOU FAILED BECAUSE YOU WERE CONCERNED ABOUT POTTER'S WELFARE ALL THE-" A solid punch on his cheeks silenced him and Draco stared at Severus who was staring red faced at father.
The man comes to a halt in front of Scorpius and starts running a hand through his hair. This is something both Mr. Potter and James do when they're slightly nervous. When Scorpius looks quietly into his eyes, he averts them as if he can't bear to maintain the eye contact.
"Okay. Your tea is already cold. You need to have it." He spoke softly and Draco stared at him, the letter crumpled in his hands. "What? You expected me to snap at you, to force you to spill the secret that has been torturing you for the past decade. You want me to shout at you to tell me about the writer of this letter? Believe me Draco, I am not going to do either. Do not forget to burn that bloody letter."
She tried hard not to break down and wore a thigh-length jacket over her gown before walking out of the house. Vernon was sitting in the sitting room, watching T.V. and Dudley was reading a book, sitting on a chair, his elbows on the dining table. He was writing something in a notebook and was also doing some calculations. She didn't understand how Vernon and Dudley had gotten accustomed to the smell and she headed towards the door and then walked out.
But the fact remains that Severus was there and all the while he knew that Potter was alive. Yet he told no one.
It had felt good to talk to Draco and he would like to do it again in future.
Harry did not know how to answer Draco's question. He had opened his eyes to find himself in the hospital and had been waiting for Draco since then. Hermione had told him that he had sustained injuries in his legs and won't be able to walk for a couple of months at least and had suggested bed rest to him after that period too.
He sniffed and strong smell of medicines attacked him which led to the realisation that he was at St. Mungos. The voice of a throat being cleared attracted his attention and he twisted his head a little. His confusion transformed into shock when he came face to face with Hermione who was now wearing her gloves and coming towards him with a very blank face. Ron and Hermione had given up on him and vowed to never meet him again. He was jealous and had missed Draco and had lashed out on them. It was truly a surprise to see his old friend again and a very pleasant one at that. He had missed Ron and Hermione terribly.
The words are spoken softly and his voice is so low that Draco almost doesn't hear it.
Dudley came back and sat across him, giving his cup of tea and looked at him silently.
The resolution lasted for 24 hours.
"It doesn't matter. I just want you to be well. Are you well?" He says. He is not making it up. This is the only thing he wishes. He just wants her to be happy and well.
"I told him that I was sorry and I begged him to help me. I begged him, though I had already tasted betrayal at his hands. I had no other alternative. He betrayed me again. He fucked me hard and rough and then he slapped me and gave me some money, saying that it was all I was worth. He had promised that he would get me some job if I let him fuck me. I had no other choice. No- other choice-" Harry felt tears well in his eyes and looked at Ron. Ron's eyes were wild and his face was completely white.
"Harry." He whispered and Harry yelled again "Get out. OUT."
Lucius Malfoy had changed a lot during his sentence in Azkaban. He had actually realized his mistakes and had wanted to start over. The rumors about Draco had reached his ears and had been confirmed when Severus had started fighting him the moment he set a foot in his home.
Draco loved Harry so much that he couldn't really express it in words. He knew that Harry wanted to kiss him but did not say anything because he felt that Draco was not ready.
"There was no door when I woke up. There was a wall and Harry was shouting - but
He pulled back and Draco looked at him "I am dirty. Please don't - You don't understand. They - they - so many- please."
Shock of seeing the man in flesh after ten years renders Draco utterly speechless. His jaw drops open and his eyes widen and he literally has to brace himself against the wall so that he doesn't fall down. He closes his eyes and rubs them with his palms. Some stupid part of his brain still believes that this is all an elaborate dream, that a twenty seven year old alive Harry sodding Potter isn't sitting in front of him, on crossed legs, his muscled arms straight and his hands resting on his knees. Draco's eyes flicker from his strong thighs to his flat stomach to his broad chest to his rectangle glasses. He is dressed in black pajamas and a cream shirt.
Weasley nodded and sat down, turning his melancholic eyes away from Draco.
"Hey. Don't sleep on me." Harry spoke but Draco flicked his wand to turn the lights off and muttered "Well. You are the softest pillow of this house so I am not getting up."
The moment Malfoy leaves the room, Harry takes a deep and erratic breathe although he doesn't need to. He wonders what he looks like right now. With nostrils flared, eyes wide and lips curled in a snarl, he must look mad. It took a lot out of him tonight to sit still and simply stare at Malfoy who was bleeding and smelling spicy and delicious. It was tempting, almost too tempting to resist.
Harry with his red cheeks and sparkling green eyes and polite voice has this stern man wrapped around his little finger.
"Harry, I told you not to keep your memories like this." Mom mutters as she comes inside and stands beside dad who is now looking at the wall.
"I said, shut it. I don't care, not even a bit." Lucius snapped angrily at Remus. Harry looked at the blonde. His eyes were burning with an unnamed emotion. He stood up, his face rigid and his body straight and his intense grey eyes fell upon Draco and him and Draco tried to move away.
with him. As far as Albus knows, only mom, uncle Ron and aunt Hermione are close to dad.
"No. Just leave me alone." Petunia whispers.
He waited for Draco's flinch but it never happened. This was new. Draco snapped back at him which was new as well "I am not a coward."
He had wasted time in brooding about his childhood, his insecurities.
"Draco. I am home." He called after placing the groceries on the table.
Harry took a step back, surprised. Malfoy did not recognise him which was absolutely absurd. Malfoy detested him - like really detested him and that hatred had only increased after Harry had defeated Voldemort.
He dragged his chair inside and closed the door. With some difficulty, he placed himself on the bed because his legs hurt.
Draco stammered "You are not my keeper. I can protect myself."
George shook his head muttering "No. I didn't."
Draco takes a deep breath as she finishes. The tale is nowhere near over but she needs to know why father lied to her.
"Sign them."
He cuts her off, "Sorry but I am not interested in knowing." He could provide a shoulder to her to cry but he knows that is not what she wants. This madness has been building inside her for the past few days now. He shivers when he witnesses darkness in her eyes. In the blur of the motion, she reaches for his hand.
"I'm worried about Scorpius. He's infatuated with Potter. It's not healthy and-"
He continued, his voice and eyes disgusted, "He's dead. Today is his tenth death anniversary or have you forgotten, Petunia. I don't understand how you can when his dead body is still trapped inside that damned cupboard under the stairs. After all, you were the one who trapped him there."
"Hello, little girl." He said and Draco followed his example, kissing her right one and murmuring "Hello. Tessa."
Severus stares at the five year old boy in surprise. He had always scoffed at parents who melted at the sight of their crying or smiling children and had vowed to never succumb to their huge eyes and adorable pouts. However, he really finds himself empathizing with all those parents as Harry stares at him, settled on his lap and dangling his legs in the air.
He shrugs in response and Harriet's sudden arrival prevents him from saying anything. She has an art file in her hands and pencil and crayons too.
"I will send everyone away if you want but you have to understand that they need to know about this if Riddle is alive. We literally know nothing." He murmurs and waits for her response.
Draco felt something press on his lips and then a hand pressed his throat softly. He drank water and the hands were removed and so was the bottle. His body felt heavy and it felt that he had been sleeping for a very long time. It burned a bit in some places but otherwise it felt fine. He knew that he would have a lot of scars on his body, hideous scars that would disgust Harry and would ruin there already non existing sex life. How could he have been so stupid?
Draco's hands scratched his back and Harry moaned, his desire evident.
"She is in her room. I won't raise her again. Take her away from my home." The woman barks at him. He towers over her, his cold eyes boring in her terrified ones.
"We scold him a little and take his toys away for some time. We give him more homework but that's it," Narcissa answered.
"Do you even like chinese food?" Scorpius asks James, amused. He knows that James isn't a big fan of chinese food.
Harry just shook his head.
He sighs and she looks at him. His eyes are watchful, guarded as if he expects her to cry.
None of them had noticed that Draco's parents had arrived and were standing at the door. Only when Harry turned around did they notice them standing there.
He had invented the potion which had made male pregnancy possible years ago. It was quite a comfortable potion. Since Male body was not made for bearing children, the potion created a temporary womb and he had also invented spells to conceal the bloated stomach from everyone's eyes. It was so ironical that he could not have kids and all due to his stupid insecurities.
"I will leave for Hogwarts." Narcissa murmurs, her voice blank as she gazes out of the window. Harry looks back at Snape and Sirius and murmurs, "Let's leave."
"What is this smell?" She asked finally. He gaped at her and at first, he was just surprised but then anger replaced the surprise and he said in a voice that barely concealed his rage, "I just asked you not to remind me. Will you, kindly, refrain from talking about him?" and then he stalked out of the room, slamming the door behind him. Petunia's head was starting to ache and the smell was not going. Ten years had passed in one night and Dudley didn't want to talk about that boy. Vernon hadn't shouted for her yet - not once. Everything was strange and unusual. She didn't move for a full ten minutes, testing, wondering when Vernon would finally lose his patience and shout for her or for Harry. She waited for things to become normal and for Dudley to come running inside her room, complaining about that boy, lying about how that boy had been stealing food.
"IT IS YOUR FAULT. YOU LEFT ME AND THEN THE MEMORIES WON'T LEAVE ME ALONE." Harry screamed at the top of his voice and Draco crawled out of the bed.
"You have to understand one thing Draco. Rape-" Harry stopped speaking and then breathed hard. It came down to it. He was as bad as those bastards. Just because Draco pushed him off and nothing happened it didn't mean that nothing could have happened.
Her knees feel weak and she stumbles on the floor, watching young Harry walk towards her with a letter and a small bag.
"We will leave this place then. It's not worth living. We can't live in muggle London until all the remaining death eaters are caught and sentenced."
"Okay." Says Scorpius and stands on the entryway while James tells his mother that they're leaving. Albus keeps on looking into Scorpius's eyes. Scorpius doesn't look away and he doesn't smile. Their relationship was sham although Albus didn't know that Scorpius was never in love with him. He will realize eventually. Not that it would matter. Albus himself was only ever interested in father.
"He is my best friend and we have a right to interfere." Hermione started and Draco looked so murderous that Harry was pretty alarmed.
"You tried to-" Harry started but broke off because their was no way to express his madness at that moment. He was furious, worried and just so pathetically helpless at that moment. Their was no way to save Draco from himself.
What could Draco say to this? He wrapped his arms around Harry's familiar waist and buried his face in Harry's neck, breathing his scent.
Harry sighed and opened his eyes. It was not much but it was something. No one knew the extent of emotional torture he had suffered at the Dursleys. His best friends knew a few things but he had kept most of the things from them as well.
Harry's cheeks were wet and he hugged Draco frantically before closing his eyes. "Harry, it's fine." But harry did not reply. He just hugged Draco desperately and Draco whispered "Sit beside me. I will complete the tale."
Draco hugged Harry, his arms and legs around the man and spoke "I love you."
Two hours later, Severus finds himself, sitting with Black in his study. He had counted upon Black to deny but the woman had to go and agree to it. Only Lupin was against it and so the man had refused point blank to be even present. Severus agreed with the wolf.
An owl was tapping on it and it seemed to be the same owl. He looked at it suspiciously and walked towards the said window to let the owl in.
It was a couple of minutes before Weasley left and Draco did not pull away. He hugged Harry tightly and tried to inhale Harry's familiar and clean fragrance.
"What do you mean?" Draco murmured, trying to understand him.
"I locked the door. I
"Yes. I am confused too. It doesn't make sense." Harry says, "Albus said that she is in trouble and she doesn't want to talk about it. She is afraid of something."
. Kindly leave. I will, however warn you to not fall for my best friend's charms. He is a ruthless man."
told him not to ask for your help. He is
He has to swallow again because he wants to hear her voice. He wants her to bicker with him like she always did. But she doesn't respond to anything. The shock is replaced by a lost and distant look again and Harry turns around and flicks the lights off.
Harry nodded and looked at his breakfast. Draco tried to control his breath because it felt that his throat was closing and his heart was beating too fast. British delegates were arriving and one of them could be his past client. He closed his eyes and covered his ears with his palms to keep the words and images out but they won't leave him alone.
"Harry, listen. Don't do anything rash. We will gather everyone and-" Sirius starts and Harry snaps at him, "Do you think that I have time to waste?"
Draco stayed quiet. Harry turned a bit to check if he was listening. Draco was looking outside silently. But he kissed Harry's neck and Harry realized that Draco was listening to everything.
He ran as fast as he could and screamed "Floo Hermione. Ask her to bring her team over here."
"I wasn't following you," she said and whirled around.
Harry smirked when Draco’s cheeks turned red and tried again "Let's go."
She shoots up at his words, her mouth open and her eyes wide and frightened. He backs off to maintain a distance from her and stays silent. He doesn't move at all. He ensures not to even blink because he knows that any movement will scare her off.
Harry did not reply. He just stared at Draco. "Hey. I am fine." Draco murmured and a lone tear fell down Harry's expressionless face "You almost died."
Draco returned with some snacks and stopped in his tracks when he saw Harry looking at a child playing with his father. Harry had a longing on his face and this meant that Harry wanted children as much as he did.
Harry cuts Ron off with a forced, "Please leave me be. As far as I am concerned, your world can go to hell. I have had enough of it.
" Please. " He whispered and covered his face again, to hide his tears. He bloody hated crying.
Harry frowns. What's Albus on about.
"Talk about yourself, dear husband. I do need your protection and I AM coming with you." Harry replied loudly and continued "I am ready and I am waiting in the sitting room. Do not get up without having your breakfast."
She crawls inside the blankets and turns to face him, her knees pressed against her chest. She looks small and vulnerable like this. Harry turns to face her after turning the lights off.
"But Draco. I want to play with him. You pomished that he will play with me."
"You don't have to. I can help myself." Harry grew defensive and Draco wondered why. They had never showered together because Harry had hated it.
"I want to kill him, Draco." He finally spoke, looking into his husband's eyes. Draco looked at him and finally let his hand go. Harry walked towards the window and looked outside. Draco walked towards him and held his waist before placing his head on Harry's shoulder.
Harry averted his eyes. Now he really was hurt. Perhaps, Draco did not want his presence at all.
"You have the perfect excuse to stalk her now, don't you?" Ron grumbles.
Slowly, realization dawns upon Draco. His lips part and his eyes widen in horror.
"Draco." She whispered and the man finally noticed her presence. His eyes were dead when he looked at her.
He looked at Draco's sleeping figure and knelt down to hear his heart beats just to make sure that he was indeed alive.
Draco was happy with the deal he had entered into with French coven of vampires. They had signed the agreement papers and he was trying to fix a meeting with another coven of vampires now. This time the coven was British and they had known his reluctance to enter Britain even though he had received various invitations from the ministry so they had requested that they would meet him in his office in France itself.
The images won't stop...
"Yes."
"Spare me the drama, please. Good bye." Draco said curtly and stormed out of his house, leaving Harry surrounded by empty rooms and walls.
He turned his betrayed eyes towards his best friend and Ron looked at him, shaking his head wildly and opened his mouth again but he wanted Draco to speak up so he shook his head and Ron took a deep breath.
"We are going out to shop today." The words have just escaped his mouth and Harriet is already jumping up and down in excitement.
He placed the plates gently and sat opposite Harry and waited.
He ignored Weasley's "Malfoy, wait. Meet Harry." and continued walking. He simply didn't have patience for this right now.
XXXXH
"MADNESS. You are calling this madness, Draco." His voice was soft but no less dangerous. "THIS IS NOT FUCKING MADNESS." Draco was jumped in surprise when Harry shouted abruptly. "You don't even stop to think what your death will do to me. Just return and kill yourself, eh? The end. Harry can go to ruddy hell. It does not matter that I can not live without you. It does not matter that I will go insane, INSANE WITHOUT YOU. IT DOES NOT FUCKING MATTER THAT I, HARRY POTTER-" Harry slapped his own chest so hard that Draco swallowed and tried to speak but Harry beat him to it "-WILL NOT LOVE ANYONE EXCEPT YOU, NO MATTER WHAT. NO, WHAT MATTERS IS THAT YOU THINK THAT-" Draco jerked when Harry poked his chest with his finger, tears streaming down his eyes " -THAT I WILL BE HAPPY WITH YOU GONE, THAT I WILL BE HAPPIER WITH ANOTHER MAN. IT DOES NOT MATTER THAT YOU ARE MY LIFE, MY STRENGTH, MY EVERYTHING, THAT YOU ARE IRREPLACEABLE, THAT NO ONE CAN EVER TAKE YOUR PLACE IN MY LIFE OR MY HEART. WHAT MATTERS IS THAT YOU WANT ME TO BLOODY MOVE ON."
Draco was still in pain and Harry had his ghosts which showed themselves sometimes through his nightmares but they had time and they would fight all their demons together.
Draco looked at his husband before continuing "I think that you had hated my spying or sneaking on you because you had always been sneaked upon. I should have not done that. I am sorry."
"Come on brother. Finish him off." The younger brother who is Bellatrix's husband screams and receives a rough, "But the game has just started. I don't want him to get off so easily. I want him to be in pain before we crucio him. We can't risk it. He can't recover from our attack otherwise the dark lord will kill us. This is the best way we can prove our loyalty towards him."
His friends murmured "We will prepare tea in the kitchen. " but he paid no attention to them speaking to Draco instead "I am so sorry Draco. So sorry."
Everything is ridiculous. Potter is supposed to be dead but he's alive. His wand was snapped and he's still doing magic. The sheer absurdity of the situation leads Draco to believe that he's dreaming and everything will simply be gone when he would wake up. He'll probably find himself in a holding cell with handcuffs around his hands and dementors as his guards.
"Is anything the matter, Draco?" He asked and Draco's eyes turned wide for a second after which he shook his head and answered sharply "I am going out for the day. I want you to leave for Severus's place since I won't be there to take care of you."
Harry pulled back and Draco looked in his eyes, his hands on Harry's shoulders now as Harry looked at him with red rimmed eyes and his hands on Draco's cheeks.
"This might have worked in the past when I was immature and was welling in my own insignificant insecurities but it won't work now. You might want to hide it from me but you might be successful as well. But who will you talk to, if not me Draco. You had told professor Snape but I know it is not the same." Harry stopped and Draco's mouth was open in shock. Harry continued "Even if you don't tell me, I will find it and I will destroy them. I will destroy them because they hurt you. The whole world would watch me destroy them bit by bit. I will avenge you Draco, no matter what happens. No matter what you say, I know that you want revenge too."
He had to swallow to stay in control.
It would be next to impossible to listen to it. But this fact made him realize how difficult must it have been for Draco to live the memories again and again for the last decade. So yes, he would listen and heal his husband and one day he will throw those bastards on Draco's feet. It was so difficult for him to even think that Draco was ra- assaulted. He could not even think the word. It was understandable that Draco couldn't accept it. Perhaps Draco thought that he was one of those people who leave their spouse when something like this happens.
Of course, his mind came back to Black's words. Draco was a freelance detective and was one of the best in his field. When he had said that he would only come if he would have the finest auror or detective they had as his partner, he hadn't known that it would be Harry Potter.
Harry had just served a glass of Vodka for himself when he heard a Pop and wondered how could anyone apparate inside his house. Only Draco, Hermione and Ron could. Ron and Hermione never did and Draco, well, he never would. His glass almost fell from his hands when Draco Malfoy stormed inside his kitchen with a very teary Hermione Granger. He was holding Hermione's hands painfully. Belatedly, he realized that he was gaping open mouthed at his husband who was looking him with furious and narrowed silver eyes.
Harry was looking at him and his eyes were soft but Draco knew that Harry meant every word.
The mocking voice in his head belongs to Malfoy. Harry shakes his head yet again to focus on present.
It was a few minutes later that Draco finally relaxed and pulled a bit, keeping his ashamed eyes averted. However Harry held his chin in his hands and pulled it to face Draco's eyes.
He opened his arms and sighed worriedly "Come here, my Draco." Draco stood up slowly and walked towards him, his eyes worried "Don't worry. I am not angry. I am just concerned. We will talk again later."
Draco looked at Harry and hugged his stomach. Harry hugged him back. A few minutes later he felt his shirt become wet with tears and he hugged Draco tightly but silently.
"Harry what's the matter?" Hermione repeats and Harry backs off after a muttered, "Come over. We need to talk."
Amazingly, Harry got the hint and placed his hands on Draco's bare back. Draco had kept his hands on Harry's shoulders or back, not wanting to cross his limits but he just couldn't control itself. His hands crawled inside Harry's trousers and squeezed his hips. That was the moment when Harry moaned and came. Draco followed soon after.
Harry stopped and stared at Draco. His eyes watered and a sob wracked his whole body. A lone tear slid down his left cheek and he wondered why was it so hard to see Draco like this. Why did it feel that Harry was burning? Why did it seem so unbearable when he was not the one who had stepped under boiling water.
A few minutes later, he realized that Draco had slept with his face on Harry's shoulders and Harry couldn't sleep. If Harry's presence soothed Draco then Harry would sleep with the blonde and he would promise Draco not to take advantage. But he knew that Draco knew that Harry would never take anyone's advantage. He wouldn't want to look weak and so he would never accept Harry's decision. Harry would have to devise some other way.
. I hope you
Petunia clenches her hands into tight fists.
Slowly, she turns around and gasps.
"I loved you, Draco. I still love you. I always have. Perhaps I did not know how much until you left. I- I have missed you so much." He spoke and Draco looked at him with eyes that were sad and Harry's heart ached to take him in his arms but he knew that it would break whatever spell Draco was in and he did not want that.
"I am so very sorry for making you think that I have a right to force myself upon you." Harry stopped because next came the words that were most difficult to utter but had to be said. Draco had to understand.
"- our fifth year. It was one Thomas Resley and he-"
"Harry." Draco said and Harry did not look at him. He had no strength left now to quarrel with him. But when hands grasped his cheeks, he had to turn to look into his husband's eyes.
"Hate is a quite strong word," Scorpius argued in a polite tone.
"Protego." Draco shielded himself again and Harry screamed "Stupefy."
Very slowly, he opens it and peaks outside. Severus is nowhere to be seen so he walks out of the room and walks slowly, his hand resting on the wall. The sitting room and the kitchen are downstairs so he starts climbing the stairs silently. He's on the last stair when his eyes finally fall on the pair. The sight that greets him is so shocking that he almost drops on the floor.
"Harriet, stop being so stubborn. You will get - fuck."
"Yes," Harry answered, frowning at the youngest Malfoy before he started walking towards the door again.
"It must be Ginny. I think that she took our hair to polyjuice into us and I think that she intercepted their letters to. It would have been easy considering that she was dating Neville." Ron said resolutely.
She swallows nervously. His eyes trace the movement.
"I-" He starts and then someone starts banging on the door.
Harry thought. Draco Malfoy - potions master extraordinaire, son of a multi millionaire, sole heir of Lucius Malfoy was begging
"I did everything to discourage Albus. What's my fault?" Draco asks coldly.
Harry was shocked and wanted to slam his head into the wall at Ron's stupidity. Draco was another story. He was angry. He was so angry that Harry wondered if his hands were the only things that were stopping Draco at all.
"Dad, I think that she is here." Albus's soft voice echoes in the silent room a second after the bell rings. Harry notices slight tremor in his voice and chooses to ignore it. He is slightly worried now. James wasn't this terrified while introducing Electra Zabini. But then Albus has always been the most sensitive amongst the three. The wizarding world doesn't exaggerate when it claims that Albus is his carbon copy. He doesn't like people prying in his matters and will tell Harry in his time.
He could see that Draco was swallowing and that his eyes flitted behind him, as if someone is watching him.
What will he do now? The photos will destroy the relationship that had built between them in the past few days. He shook his head and tried to clear his thoughts. But the image of Harry's devastated and disgusted face when he would finally see these pictures won't leave him. Tears started slipping from his eyes and he pulled his hair in frustration.
"Stay away from me, Malfoy," she said in a low, dangerous voice. Her eyes were were so sharp and wary that Draco opened his mouth to answer her, to defend himself but her wand dug painfully on his throat so he shut it.
Harry stayed frozen and tears fell from Draco's eyes. He had finally accepted it. It had taken him a complete decade to do so and Harry wanted to take him in his arms to comfort him but he knew that he must let Draco get it out of his system.
Severus nodded and Harry apparated to house. He opened the lock and entered the dining room. As expected, Draco was sitting on the dining table waiting for him. As soon as he entered, Draco looked at him with furious eyes. Draco had prepared the dinner today. Every dish was his favorite. It was obvious that Draco had taken time to prepare a delicious meal for him. Their dinner had been good the other night and Harry had fallen in love with Draco all over again.
"I'll not drink. I promise." Harry said quietly.
Ten minutes had elapsed and he still couldn't think of anything. His tortured eyes turned towards the lone window of his lab and a third option came to his mind. There was only one way, only one.
Dudley nodded and finally spoke "I do not know what to do. She is so terrified all the time and she did not want to stay in this house. At night, no one can enter her room now."
" Shhh" Harry murmured and covered Draco's body with his, dragging him towards the wall.
"Master, you must visit Master Draco's lab. I hid the letter and photos their so that Master Draco does not destroy them. Kreahcer will punish himself for going against Master Draco's wishes but you must see them Master Harry, before Master Draco wakes up. Kreacher will stay here and will call you if Master Draco wakes up."
Vernon looks at the clock and sighs for the umpteenth time.
"What's the matter?" Draco asked and Harry stayed quiet. "Did I say something offensive?"
It was Harry's presence that had infused confidence in him. Harry had promised him that he will be just a call away and he knew ample of magic which was uncomfortable but could protect Draco if needed even though he couldn't walk without moaning in pain yet.
"Please forgive me. Please." Father begged her and the sword fell from her hands. The blood, his blood covers her palm and she stares at it.
"Enter." Drawls the professor in his deep voice. Harry obliges and opens the door.
But, how could a castle glare? Clearly, Draco had gone mad.
When Draco raised his right hand to wipe his tears, Harry couldn't take it anymore and pulled Draco's shaking body in his arms.
However, Ron cuts continues, "No. I've to say this. Had you not betrayed him, none of this would even be happening."
"Malfoy is not good for him, Ron. He should have married Ginny. You know. You were there at past ministry functions. You know that Malfoy behaved like a madman, an- an animal." Hermione yelled at him and Ron sighed in frustration for the millionth time "Hermione, Harry is not a child. Will you stop interfering in his life? You know the reason for Draco's behaviour."
He can't cry. He needs to be strong for her. A few hours of someone's insanity have destroyed Draco's life... his life.
Draco almost pounced on the trio. It was Harry's quick thinking that prevented them from getting hurt. He hugged Draco's waist and placed his lips on his ear lobe.
The next thing he knew was that lips were pressing on his head and a voice whispered in his ears, "Of course I do."
And then it became really silent and a few moments later, he heard a door close. Presuming that Blaise had left, Harry opened his eyes only to find the other man crouched right in front of him. His dark eyes were dark and angry but he didn't say anything.
He became worried when their was no answer so he shouted  "Draco."  and climbed stairs quickly to check Harry's room. He should not have taken the liberty to enter it without knocking but he did. He shouldn't have just opened the bath but he did.
Wasn't it
But Draco did not speak. He simply looked on the floor. Harry couldn't empathise with him because he had never been in Draco's shoes. He had lived his life in constant terror, yes but Vernon was just one man and he had protected himself.
A few minutes later, he realized that he had been right. He heard Draco sobbing and crying frantically next door. Alarmed, he sat straight.
"Blinky will take Mr. Black in his room."
"This is the twenty fifth time you have been brought over here in the past year because of the over consumption of alcohol and-" She started speaking and placed a vial containing blue liquid on his lips. He interrupted her after consuming the potion "I am sorry for that day."
" I was with Severus, trying to get him to spill the thing that you are hiding from me. He refused of course. " Harry said and his stomach grumbled. " The meal looks delicious. I am so hungry. Merlin only knows how you manage your profession and cooking at the same time. Did you eat? I wish you haven't. I want to eat with you. "
Severus sighs and replies, "Only if Lucius, Narcissa and Draco come along with us."
"Guess who told on you Black?" Fred mocks and George continues, "Kreacherrrr. Your old friend."
"We need to talk about this." Draco whispers under his breath because the lecture has started. Harry doesn't reply so Draco resorts to grabbing his hand under the table.
As soon as Albus is out, the man slams the door on his face.
Potter was about to say something but Creevy clapped his hands, squealing, "Perfect. Please, stand beneath this chandelier."
She can't be sure but his eyes are flashing and she waits for him to leave before crawling out of the bed.
He has definitely said something wrong because dad's eyes narrow and his nostrils flare.
"Petunia, look at me."
"Had you not been stupid to join-" Severus sneered and father cut him off "I committed a mistake and I apologised for the same. I have paid for it. I had left him in your care. As a godfather, you must have forced him to listen to you but you-"
Granger was panting, his eyes burning with anger. Draco simply stared at her.
Dumbledore however, he is frozen like a statue.
"Why would you go? We could launch an attack." Jameson murmured.
He swallows and a bead of sweat trickles down his forehead as he tries hard to concentrate at her face. She has just showered, it seems. Her hair is wet and the shirt is sticking to her damp body.
So he gets up and places her utensils away. She looks silently at him.
. As if having her family disappear and being pushed into marriage at the age of seventeen wasn't quite enough. Things were already complicated. This would only complicate them further. Knowing that she had nothing to say, Harriet only huffed in response and headed towards the door of the great hall. She walked slowly but made sure that she wasn't walking beside any of them. Maybe, she would not have to sit with those wretched Weasleys today.
He blinked his eyes, his vision blurred now.
"Blinky, bring two buckets of cold water quickly. Slinky, go and bring Hermione and Ron immediately. Tell them what has happened." Harry ordered, his voice trembling, as he reached his husband's shaking body.
When Harry placed his hands on both of Draco's shoulders and dragged his face towards his own, Draco blinked hard to stop his tears.
"Accio invisibility cloak," she muttered, pointing her wand towards the door and the cloak came flying inside. She wrapped the cloak around her frame and moved out, heading towards the headmaster's office. She knew that he was hiding something from them and she hated it when things were hidden from her.
"I won't and not just because father and Uncle Harry made me promise." Scorpius stops. Scorpius is a very private man and doesn't like exhibiting his feelings.
They glowered at each other, his hands holding Draco's fist. A yank and Draco fell on his chest. Draco looked at him with narrowed eyes and bit his cheek. Harry retaliated by kissing Draco. The kiss was bruising and harsh. He bit Draco's lower lip and glared at the blonde all the while.
Of course, Severus nods just a second later before murmuring, "Of course, I'll take you. Of course."
As they dance to the music, Draco smiles and laughs and Harry revels in it.
"I'll be in my office. If you have your own office somewhere, just let me know." Potter said, his back facing Draco and walked away, his hands pushed inside his pockets and his face straight ahead.
Lost in his thoughts, he forgets that he is standing in front of James's naughty five year old daughter until she tickles his ribs with her soft, small fingers, standing on her tip toes.
"Mr Malfoy-Potter, you are right. I am so-" Dudley started, an apology in his eyes and Draco stopped his speech with his raised palm. He heard Harry sigh behind him. But the mans stayed silent. they were completely different in this aspect. Harry was too forgiving and Draco did not forgive anyone, not so easily atleast.
"So do you." Draco smirked and slumped in Harry's arms muttering "You have exhausted me now. I am sleeping."
"When I was small, I dreamt of having someone to share my sorrows and happiness and I also dreamt that that person would tell me his sorrows and joys. I dreamt of having someone who would need my care and love, who would share everything with me. I promised that I would never let that person go." Harry muttered and Draco was looking at him silently, frozen in time. His eyes did not blink. They were blank and his face was pale but then it could be because he had not been sleeping at all for the past couple of days.
Harry jumped up in shock and stare at him, his eyes wide and thunderstruck.
He closed his eyes to sleep but couldn't sleep well, in spite of Draco's warm presence in his arms. He would have to convince Draco to sleep with him somehow and he would also have to convince Draco to talk to him.
Sirius gets out of the bed and walks towards Harry before placing his hands on Harry's shoulders, "Harry what's the matter?" His near escape from death at the department of mysteries has changed him a lot. He doesn't take rash decisions anymore and it's a good thing that the aurors managed to catch Pettigrew too. Sirius understands that he is not alone now, that he has a godson who needs him.
"Pity she married him, eh Draco. Did you cry a lot after the wedding?" Blaise drawled mockingly and after just a second Pansy and Blaise came forward to stand beside him.
- Petunia closes her eyes and doesn't let herself finish the sentence. There are some things she can't accept yet.
Hermione had been in the hospital, studying the case of Elisa Mount. She is a ten year old girl and as reported by her mother, was constantly vomiting everything she ate. She was on the second paragraph when Ron burst into her room. She had planned to stay angry with her husband for a week at least but when she saw his panicked face, she forgot the quarrel they had had that morning and stood up to meet him half way.
"Everything." Harry whispered softly and Draco turned to look at him, murmuring "What?"
Suddenly Harry places his hands on Draco shoulders and starts shaking him hard.
Draco just stared at the man "This is so unfair."
He had never imagined that a day would come when he would crave the other man's presence so much. So many times Draco had wanted to give him a head massage to sooth him and he had refused, choosing to just take a capsule.
Draco dragged Harry to his private office and locked closed the door behind them.
He bends down and presses another soft kiss on her mouth. She is delicious. He wants her in a way she doesn't understand. She can't understand. Maybe she never will.
"Yes." He says, not just because his son'll benefit from this but because he really wants everyone to know how wonderful and intelligent this child is. It's difficult to decide whether he would land in Gryffindor or in Slytherin.
He opens his mouth to say something but someone else beats him to it.
She laughed bitterly at his stammered words "We had been stupid enough to acquiesce to your wishes a year back. It won't happen again. Insult us all you want, Harry. I'll be back."
Irritated, he heads towards the door and rings the bell. A middle aged man, dressed in a black suit greets him and takes him inside and straight towards the sitting room where Albus waits for his mother who does not arrive. He waits for five more minutes and then heads up the stairs and towards mom's bedroom. It's not required though. He finds her standing in the middle of the gym. She is dressed in joggers and a top and tries to pretend about not knowing about his presence at her door.
"What are you doing here at this hour, mr. Potter."
Draco stared at him, trying to read the man's face for lies. But he found none. However, he had a feeling that Black was hiding something from him, something crucial. He didn't say anything though because he knew that Black would not tell him the whole truth.
Lucius just blinked at his wife who had tears in her eyes and murmured "I need to tell him that I am proud of him Narcissa. I do."
Harry's eyes shot open when Draco pulled his hair and crushed their lips in a brutal and hungry kiss. Harry's eyes closed and his hands cupped Draco's buttocks. The kiss was passionate and Harry had missed Draco so much. He had missed Draco's warmth and fierceness and possessiveness because that was the only word that explained Draco's strong hold on Harry's hair and the blood that had gathered on the corner of his lips, as a result of Draco's biting.
"One word more and I will throw you out of this house. The only reason I have tolerated you is that you are his best friend and have supported him throughout his life. I respect you but you will not interfere between me and my husband." Draco whispered, glaring at Hermione and she muttered defensively "The divorce papers-"
There was this constant fear in his mind that if any client came in front of him, he would be forced again and the thought was so terrifying that Draco could barely breath.
"Draco, you know my relatives did not trust me with anything. I wanted them to love me and trust me. But they did not love me. They turned my life into a hell. Ever since I have understood love, I have been in love with you. Your trust Draco. that's all I want. You can take as much time as you want but you have to stop hurting yourself." Harry stopped and breathed deeply "You don't trust me with your protection and I think that perhaps Vernon was right. I am useless and worthless. I must be if my husband does not trust me."
Draco's eyes suggested that he would not answer any of Harry's questions yet but won't run away from Harry. He was clutching Harry's shirt too hard.
Harry replied "yes." And served some pineapple for Draco.
Scorpius says, looking into James' green eyes, "But you're not -"
Scorpius sighs. He can't initiate anything with James right now, not when he's not sure whether or not they'll even meet again. But it won't be fair to leave James with the thought that Scorpius liked him only because of his resemblance to his dad because it isn't true.
"Hermione and Ron are returning in a couple of days."
"Go away." Draco mumbles.
"Treacle tart," she murmured but the gargoyles didn't move.
"Malfoy, Narcissa, Snape. What's happening?" Sirius asks and Harry speaks in a hard voice, "Voldemort has Draco. I have to rescue her."
"You are. Running away, cowering in the face of situations that involve interaction with other people are symptoms of cowardice, darling." Harry muttered and Draco pulled back to glare at him. Harry continued, unaffected by his husband's glare "Never figured that you will turn out to be such a big coward."
"I never asked you. Perhaps I should have. Did they always hurt you?" Harry asked and Draco was breathing hard by now because the memories were overwhelming. He had buried them in a corner of his mind and did not want to live those moments ever again. "I don't want to talk about it. Stop."
"I don't want them hurt needlessly for something that they cannot control." Draco spoke and Harry argued again, his eyes alarmed "Draco. Listen to me. You have to think about yourself too. I know that it would overwhelm you. You have stayed away from Britain and everything connected to Britain and it is quite possible that you know those delegates. "
Draco looked back at Weasley who was pouring a glass of water for himself.
So much blood...
Potter stares at him, her green eyes impossibly wide and startling. Draco has to avert his eyes so as not to get lost in them.
Harry backs off in disbelief as Snape's eyes sparkle with amusement.
Draco just stared at Harry's furious face. The tears had dried and tear tracks were visible on his cheeks. Harry's eyes were red rimmed and Draco was rendered speechless. He had nothing to say so he turned away from Harry.
"I am not sorry. I needed you to know that you can trust me." Harry cut him off and Draco replied very softly "I want children. I dreamt about our kids. Teddy and Lily."
Draco murmured "I am sorry."
Draco found himself looking at Black, waiting for him to meet Draco's eyes so that Draco could communicate his surprise and confusion. Potter looked back at the wall and Black turned his eyes back at Draco.
"Just so you know, we don't mind if he stays with us." Weasley spoke and his eyes were unreadable. Draco snapped at him "There is no need. I am capable enough. Don't imply that I consider my profession more important than him."
Harry slammed his hands on the slap again and shouted angrily "SHUT UP. SHUT UP. SHUT UP. DO NOT SAY SUCH THINGS. YOU- YOU COWARD, YOU UTTER AND ABSOULTE SELFISH COWARD. HOW DARE YOU ATTEMPT TO LEAVE ME ALONE?" and merlin, his face was wet and too hot in rage. He had never been so angry. Never had he felt such madness course throughout his body.
Her small hand wraps around his larger one and he stares into her innocent eyes hoping against hope that Draco doesn't ruin the gleam and happiness he can see in them.
"All right, you stupid cunt. I will do it." He snapped at Ginny. She was utterly crazy. Harry was madly and irrevocable in love with Draco. He would never leave the blonde for anyone and now Sirius was very terrified for himself. He was just sure that somehow Harry knew. The looks that his godson gave to him when Sirius embraced Draco were enough to terrify him. Merlin only knew what he would do once everything is out of the box.
"Save it, Lupin. I am not interested. It was a school-boy crush." Lucius snapped at him and Severus spoke, "Lucius-"
"Then what happened? Tell me."
Draco looks coldly at him. Potter abruptly pushes his chair back and stands up.
"Draco." It's her mother who is standing at the door quietly, her face dull and her eyes puffy and red-rimmed. It seems that mother didn't sleep at all last night.
He had married Draco and he had vowed to protect and love him. He had broken those vows the last night.
Harry's tongue peaks out of his lips and his eyes become huge for a moment as if he's just realizing the loop-hole in his plan.
Absently, he wonders who else made the connection before giving her his brightest smile.
She only nods and starts walking, her frightened eyes looking straight ahead.
"We are leaving. Floo us if you need us Harry." Hermione spoke and they left after another hug.
This time no one would be able to stop the inevitable from happening and he would leave Harry in peace. With these thoughts in his mind, he unlocked his door. Surprisingly, their were no tears in his eyes. He went inside the kitchen and decided to do it the muggle way. But first, first he wanted to remember Harry and his eyes, his smile, his innocence and his beauty, his honesty.
"I'll see you in evening today. Maybe we'll sneak outside the castle." She says and Harry nods.
Draco was not comfortable with either Weasley or Granger but she was better then an unknown healer who would lead Draco to a panic attack so he sighed wearily and spoke "Then, I think Granger will be best. She is professional and does not hurt any of her patients. I have heard that she is devoted to healing." Draco whispered and Harry nodded. He turned to pick his boxers but Harry stopped him "Wait. Just put on your trousers. Boxers will burn your hips."
"Yes, master."
"I am sorry you had to see this. We will just retire to our room now. Have a good night."
"I know that you are brilliant at potions. I am also aware of the fact that you are a very good teacher. I would know, considering that Snape often paired us together and I was absolutely pants at potions." Potter says.
"What's wrong?" Harry asked, already heading towards the kid.
A bead of sweat trickled down his cheek and he called loudly " Kreacher. KREACHER. ", jumping two stairs at a time.
Voldemort despised muggles. One day he would eliminate them or rule over them. However, right now, he would ask Malfoy about his beloved diary and take his leave. That was why he had come here - not because he wanted to ask Malfoy about - about anything except his diary. Potter was a nuisance. He had to get rid of the brat otherwise the boy would wage a war against him. That was what the prophecy implied at least and he would rather not fight another war and lose magical blood. As it is, the magical population wasn't even forty percent of the muggle population.
"Mate. what's the matter?" Ron's brown eyes study him silently. It's been a while since they met. Harry takes a minute to think about what he is doing. Ron and Hermione bring memories with them, memories that he would rather not relive.
"You can scold me if you want." Harry whispered and Draco finally shouted angrily at him "You have turned our house into a large dustbin. You are messier than a child and you never think of the repercussions at all."
"I remember her handwriting Hermione. She wrote to me as well. I did not tell about that letter to Draco. I had recognised her writing."
"Albus," McGonagall started, her tone as incredulous as her face was, "How did we travel through dimensions without realising."
For a moment, Harry was stunned because something was definitely wrong. Draco would not break down in front of him, not if he can help it and Harry was alarmed so he knelt down in front of him. Draco was sitting on his knees, his hands clenched into fists on his thighs as he stared at Harry, his eyes shining.
Ginny laughed and laughed "Oh you poor bastard! What will Harry say when he realizes that you had a hand in destroying his husband's life? I have not told anyone about you till now, not even my other accomplices, though, they have wondered. But I can and I will tell everyone if you don't help me. I will get you thrown in Azkaban. Mark my words, Harry will be the first one to know about what you did."
He moved on to another scar. It was a carving. Most of it had disappeared. Something had been carved with a knife.
"Draco, hullo." Draco grimaced. Weasley had taken to calling him by his first name and he spoke so politely that Draco could not help but revert back.
Were Harriet not determined to pursue Malfoy, she would either have given up entirely or sunk into depression. As it was, she couldn't just let this go. Malfoy is the only one she has ever wanted. She will not give up so easily.
He pulls back and shivers as desire slowly takes him over. He wants her. He needs her. She could have stayed away. Now that he has tasted the forbidden fruit, he wants more.
?" He asks softly and he has to close his eyes to stop the images that are now dancing in the forefront of his mind, the memories - the reminder of his worst mistake. He is still bearing the consequences of that mistake. He wishes to stop this before it gets out of hand but he can do nothing about this. Draco has many qualities but a good heart is not one them. He's his father's son through and through.
Hermione shrugs before replying, "She is sleeping. I heard her sobbing before she finally fell asleep. She is - I don't really have words for it Harry. I think that she will need peace and quiet but I think that she shouldn't be left alone. She needs friends too, friends who won't make her conscious of what happened, atleast till Hogwarts doesn't reopen."
"Yes, master." The elf said and vanished.
He sighs and floos over to Kingsley's office.
They walk out of the house. It's bright and sunny.
"You will clean the bathrooms and bring groceries. I trust there are other elves in the Manor to serve father and mother." The elves replied in unison "Yes. Master Draco."
"Of course I'm coming." Replies Scorpius.
A gentle squeeze of Severus's shoulders and "Thank you for taking care of him." and black is gone.
He heard a knock on the door and said "Enter."
he followed Dudley towards the sitting room and Dudley spoke politely "Sit. Coffee or tea or something else?"
To say that he was sad would be an understatement. He had not eaten anything even after Narcissa's requests. He had started respecting his wife during his sentence. She had been the only one with him and had not accused him even once.
"I -" He started and Lucius blinked before cutting him off, "But that's not the part you should worry about. Your godfather Sirius Black wanted me and I am not aware whether it was love or lust. I did not care to find out. Somehow he knew about our clandestine meetings and blackmailed me. He said that he would expose me if I don't agree to have a relationship with him. I, of course, refused. My housemates knew that I was a bi. I had thought that he would forget about it but I don't think he has. Then I joined the ranks of death eaters and forgot all about it. But, now, now I think that he is somehow connected to Draco's sentence and what happened after that."
He closes his eyes and wonders if he is hallucinating.
"What do you need Granger? I am busy." He snapped and the woman snapped back at him "I would leave if you like Malfoy but I thought that you would want to know that Harry fell down the stairs at Gremmauld and has received several injuries during the process. He is in the hospital with me."
"It will take you to Godric's hollow, at my parents's place. It has wards and protection charms and Hermione is there with a few elves. Let her heal you. She is a nice person. She will only want to help and she will not insult or mock you." He stops and looks at her. She only stares at him because - because this is exactly like a fairy tale. He has come as a knight in a shining armour and he is giving her a way out and he doesn't stare at her breasts even once.
Around three and a half years have passed since James and Lily died and Harry became the boy-who-lived. When Sirius had seen James's dead body, he had realized that Peter had betrayed them. He had gone inside Harry's room to check if Lily was still alive only to find her dead body sprawled on the floor. He had been so enraged at that moment that he had decided to find Peter and kill him.
"I'll not hurt your brat," Voldemort drawled curtly, leaning back and spreading his legs. He was wearing a shirt and trousers today. It was hot. He hadn't wanted to wear robes, seeing that he had gone to kill the kid and it usually didn't require dressing up.
"Dad wants breakfast," Dudley repeated blankly.
"Do you have Veritaserum?" Harry asked and Draco pulled back, looking at him in surprise "Yes. Why?"
Harry was looking at him, as if expecting something. Draco just muttered "Go to sleep, Harry." After helping Harry on his bed.
Sirius stares at Draco with terrified eyes all the while, not even uttering a single word, not even attempting to move, his gaze steady and terrified on Draco, trying to breathe. Finally Draco drops his hands and Sirius heaves a huge breathe before Wealseys pull him up.
"Off with you Potter. You mustn't be late." Potter smiles at Severus. Severus doesn't. He is too conflicted. He knows that Potter is doing this for Draco but it will not bode well for Potter and he doesn't like it.
Ron and Hermione shifted close to them now and sat in front of them. Draco laid his head in Harry's lap again and Harry started stroking his hair.
"So how do you prefer your tea." He asks sweetly. She gapes at him. Albus grins. His fingers are still wrapped around Scorpia's.
A little boy, dressed in simple trousers, shirt and robes is staring at her with Lily's eyes.
They glared at each other for a minute, after which Harry snapped at him "I will not sign the papers."
"He won't." The voice is soft but panicked, "We should - we should break it off. It's getting out of hand."
"Draco you won't-" Harry started and Draco had almost climbed the stairs "No. I will never attempt to kill myself again. Don't worry. No matter, how difficult it becomes to go on, I will not commit suicide. Nothing can console me or change the past ..... but..... rest assured I will live..... for you for I love you and will always do."
From the corner of his eyes, he peaks at others to realize that they think so too. Ron and Sirius are literally gaping at her, their mouth wide open.
Severus stares at her. He has been doing this quite a lot.
He stood up decisively and Hermione glared at him "Where are you going?"
"It was you." Harry mutters in a matter of fact voice and Draco opens and closes his mouth a couple of times before settling on keeping it firmly shut.
He sat back and smiled before looking at the breakfast. The tea was still warm and just like he liked. He finished everything and then went into the bathroom to get ready, feeling nervous about the promise he had made to Harry last night.
"Draco. I am opening the door." Still, Draco did not answer and Harry cast a wandless spell to open the door and his heart clenched when he saw Draco curled in a ball on the corner of his bed, trying to rub his body all over with his hands.
"This... as in?" He asks and she replies, "Helping me. Why are you helping me? I have never been civil to you. I have always mocked you."
The boy settles down on the other side of Draco and summons a book for himself.
"Draco," Pansy exclaimed, her eyes wide and her face white, "It's 2001 and my office wasn't even there."
Harry was talking to his mother. Father was hearing the discussion silently. Draco made his way towards them quietly and decided to talk to them. His courage left him as soon as he reached them though.
"Run!" Draco screamed and the three of them ran towards the front door of the castle. At first, the gate won't open, no matter how much they tried and when the dogs were only a tiny bit away from them, the gate opened and Draco hurried inside, followed by Pansy and Blaise. They were out of breath and terrified. He had this weird feeling that the castle was still glaring at them.
He was pushed and pressed against the wall. Harry twisted Draco's face the other side and kissed him fiercely. Draco whined lowly and Harry unbuttoned Draco's shirt with gentle hands. Soon, Draco' shirt was on the floor and Harry's mouth was all over his neck and jaw and chest and nipples. Draco moaned and Harry sucked a particularly soft spot on his neck. Draco was startled when Harry buried his nose in Draco's armpits and inhaled.
"All this because I refused you to make love to me." Draco whispers. He isn't asking. He is damn sure that this is the reason.
"Apply it on effected area, yeah. Call me if you can't. I am just outside, in the sitting room. I am a healer so I can be professional with him. I am going out now. Ron is with me just outside."
"I'm asking you, Harry, not telling you." Black said politely and looked at Draco from the corner of his eyes.
Scorpius places his hand on Harry's and replies with a sparkle in his eyes, "Mr. Potter, you're not forcing me to do this. You don't have to be sorry or feel guilty."
Creevy wasn't done after one picture. Potter was obviously not comfortable. But, no one said anything.
Yes, he had planned to let Harry go but Harry did not want to go and they were finally starting to understand each other.
Malfoy's gardens and peacocks were lovely but he did not stop to admire them. He had no time for it. He walked ahead and opened the gate. A house elf greeted him with a bow.
Draco smiles back at him and Ron nudges the blonde before muttering something. Draco glares at him and the twins snicker.
Harry said and looked at him again after placing his cup on the table. Draco had frozen from shock on his chair.
Something shifted between Potter and herself yesterday night. Before yesterday she hadn't wanted to tell anything to him. But then - after what he said - the words just tumbled out of her mouth. She would have told everything to him, except she knows that others deserve to know everything too, considering the fact that they are going to have to tolerate her mood swings and irrational rage or extreme sadness for the next few months, until she recovers.
Draco opened his eyes and yawned. When he felt for Harry around him, he realized that Harry had already gotten up and left. He cast 'Tempus' and realized that it was half past eight and he was way too late than usual.
Harry opened his eyes and expected to find himself on his floor, surrounded by empty and mostly broken bottles of Vodka and blinked his eyes and realised that he was on a bed instead. His eyebrows rose in confusion and surprise when he looked around and realised that he was not at home.
"Goo- Goodbye Draco." Harry whispered and moaned before falling hard on the floor. By the time Draco came out of his stupor, Harry had already fallen unconscious.
A knock on his door brought him back from his reverie and he hiccupped and tried to stand up. That, however, proved to be difficult because his head was spinning and his eyes were drooping. Not more than three seconds later, his knees gave up and he fell down. He tried his best to stay sober but couldn't and gave in to the darkness that was hell bent on enveloping him.
