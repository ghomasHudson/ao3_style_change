George stepped forward; his face seemed emotionless, though Harry could see the grief and the betrayal in his eyes. "Ron's right", he said as he met Harry's gaze, the intensity sending shivers down Harry's spine, "You should go."
As soon as the window was open enough, the owl flew inside, landing promptly on the back of the armchair Harry had vacated a few seconds ago.
He stood up, untangling himself - much to the other boy's protest - and holding out his hands for Harry to take. Harry looked at them warily for a moment, an unreadable look in his bottle green eyes, but took them either way, letting himself be pulled up by the blond.
Pansy rolled her eyes, a smirk on her face. "You've heard me, Potter. I've noticed that every day, you're becoming more and more dramatic. Perhaps the Slytherin you're sharing a room with is rubbing off on you."
Turning around, he came to stand face to face with the portrait that guarded the entrance to the common room. Salazar Slytherin stared down his long nose at him, his lips curling into a menacing sneer.
Draco wondered if their Saviour would return to Hogwarts this year. And if so, he hoped he would have the chance to thank the boy and apologise to him - as well as many others - for the way he had acted throughout their time at school. If he truly wanted to start over he should at least start with the people to whom he owed an apology, although he knew a simple apology couldn't really take back the things he had done to them.
He had shaken his head, throwing the letter on the coffee table, and had sat back down in the chair, picking up his cuppa and taking a tentative sip.
"Are you completely off your rocker, Goldstein", Theo said, giving the Ravenclaw an incredulous look. "Weasley wouldn't be able to hold our team together for more than five seconds."
"Potter," Draco sneered, his sparkling grey eyes finally meeting Harry's emerald green ones, "if you could be so kind as to take your Fanclub elsewhere, that would be highly appreciated."
believe what the bloody hell just happened!" Ron bellowed, his loud footsteps thundering down the wooden staircase to the boys' dormitories.
Just then, Hermione appeared at their side, throwing her arms around her boyfriend's neck and kissing him lovingly. Ron staggered a little at the extra weight thrown at him, but he recovered quickly and answered Hermione's kiss with as much passion, picking her up and twirling them around.
The low buzz of discussing murmurs filled the silence. "I don't think Ron being captain is such a bad idea", Anthony Goldstein spoke up, his voice just barely audible above the rather loud murmurs.
Ron eyed Harry suspiciously as the latter walked to the bathroom to search for some Pain Relief potion. He was pretty sure he had restocked his bottles somewhere near the beginning of the school year.
In the first year of their relationship, Draco hadn’t asked Harry to do anything on Halloween, despite it being one of his favourite holidays – bar the Christmas holidays, of course. He had let Harry sulk and mourn the death of his parents, too scared he might ruin the still fragile
A dark shadow hovering above you, clouding your view of reality. It leaves you feeling empty as loneliness slowly creeps through the cracks of your skin, swallowing the small bits of happiness on its path.
Harry looked around him. Most eyes were directed towards him. "I'm sorry, what?" he asked, his cheeks flushing slightly again at all the attention he was getting. They had probably asked him something important whilst he had been too busy staring at Draco bloody Malfoy... again.
The longer he stared at the flames, the heavier his eyes became. So, he decided to go on a stroll around the castle, hoping it would wake him up enough to prevent himself from falling asleep on the spot.
Draco waited patiently as Harry tried to get his breathing somewhat under control. When he spoke, his voice sounded hoarse, "Light, the ground, darkness, the moon and silver eyes."
So, perhaps he wasn't fine and hadn't been for quite some time, but... Could he really trust Draco enough to tell him? Did he really want anyone else aside from Luna know how he really felt?
Harry had to refrain himself from jumping the other boy right then and there; his hands clenched into tight fists.
Confused, Harry tilted his head, milling the words over in his head. "So, you had known them a while before you actually realised?"
Now that he really thought about it, he had been a horrible friend to them for the past few years. It was his fault, after all, they had to fight a war. It was his fault so many people had died. He was the one responsible for all their grief.
. He couldn't quite imagine something interesting written in that book - or in any book for that matter.
Harry felt content at that moment. He was surrounded by two of the most important people in his life. He was surrounded by his
were heard from the students before McGonagall nodded her head. "Very well then," she said, gesturing towards the exit of the hall, "if you will all follow me now. I will lead you to your new common room."
The sound of his name sent more blood rushing down to his already very prominent erection and he quickened his pace, seeking as much delicious friction as possible and groaning lowly. He could already feel the tension in his stomach building up, waiting for the inevitable release.
Nodding his head once with a polite smile, Draco turned around and started walking down the maze of corridors to the Entrance Hall at top speed.
The amount of homework the teachers kept giving them was unbelievable, not to mention the training sessions of the Quidditch team. Ron had wanted them to train at least two times a week, but sometimes they would even practice three times or even
Noticing the sombre expression on the boy's face, Godric sighed sadly. "It wasn't just anybody, though", he continued, catching Harry's attention again. "They were very special to me - a pain in my arse, I should say, but still very special."
Harry laughed freely at that, throwing his head in his neck as they started walking back towards the castle. The others had already disappeared inside. They walked side by side, brooms in one hand and their other hand dangerously close to brushing against each other.
Shrugging, Luna sat up, glancing at the enormous clock on one of the walls. "Oh!" she exclaimed, quickly standing up and placing her empty cup of tea on the side table as if it had suddenly burnt her. "How silly of me!"
There - right in front of him - stood the Weasleys in a half-circle, surrounding the unmoving body of none other than Fred Weasley.
As Ron set Hermione back down, she turned to Harry and wrapped her arms around him too, squeezing tightly. "You were absolutely brilliant up there, Harry", she mumbled against his chest, her voice sounding slightly muffled through the fabric of his Quidditch robes.
"Of course, dear boy", Helga smiled sweetly, waving her hand at him dismissively. "We will not hold you up any longer. Go have fun! And good luck!"
It felt like he had been chasing the Snitch for ages already, twisting and turning around the pitch. Yet the small, fluttering ball always stayed just out of reach. If Harry didn't know any better he would say the Snitch was actually teasing him.
"I know", Harry said, an apologetic smile grazing his lips, although Luna couldn't see his face. He really appreciated the thought behind the gift, yet he didn't see himself doing it. It felt ridiculous.
"Is it true what I've heard?" he asked, the sneer turning into a malicious smirk. "The Ministry is really keeping a close eye on you? Breathing down your neck so they can throw you in Azkaban from the moment you set one step out of place?"
Like Harry, Draco was wearing an outer robe over his shirt – fastened by a crescent moon-shaped clasp – though his was dark blue, almost black,  decorated with a million small diamond-like gems that sparkled in a non-existing light with every movement. Draco’s long, pale hair fell in soft waves on his back.
Careful not to make anything worse, Draco moved his hand from Harry's shoulder to his shaking hands, taking them into his own to steady them.
His two best friends - Pansy and Blaise - were sitting in front of him, both of them listening to their fellow Slytherin Theodore Nott telling them about his summer. How his father had been put into Azkaban too and how he had decided to rent an apartment for himself somewhere at the edge of Wizarding London in the hopes of getting a fresh start.
need help", Harry growled, his temper rising with every second. He turned his head away from the girl next to him, stubbornly staring back out over the lake.
Draco shook his head. "No, I was on my way to the Quidditch try-outs", he replied, only now realising he should be going if he didn't want to be late.
A smirk of his own appeared on Draco's face as he leaned even closer. "You would like that, wouldn't you?" he whispered, his teeth nibbling at his bottom lip. His eyes flickered to Harry's lips for a second before returning to stare into Harry's green gaze.
"You know", she continued, "Now that I think about it, Draco might actually be the solution to get rid of all those Wrackspurts flying around you. They're clearly clouding your mind more and more."
Harry hummed before visibly suppressing a yawn... and failing miserably. "Well," he said as he stood up from his bed and took a pair of joggers and an old-looking T-shirt out of his suitcase, "I think I'm going to hit the hay now." He walked towards the bathroom and closed the door behind him, leaving Malfoy alone in their room.
Draco nodded, though he couldn't bring himself to look at her. He felt ashamed. He had made a complete fool out of himself, crying like a bloody baby and over what? People standing a little too close to him?
All returning Eighth Years were sitting at that table, talking quietly amongst each other and ignoring the attention - good or bad - they were all getting.
"Our own Quidditch Team? Like the Eighth Year Quidditch Team?" Terry Boot asked, his dark eyes wide with excitement.
He cursed the unwanted tears that had started forming behind his eyes; he cursed the butterflies that were once again doing somersaults in his stomach; he cursed his bloody life.
"Oh yes, my boy -" Godric huffed sadly "- almost every night. I used to wake up screaming bloody murder and sweating like a pig, completely disoriented."
At some point during the evening, the 'celebration' party for the Eighth Years had moved to the shores of the Black Lake. All Eighth Years, and a few of the younger years as well, were sitting around a large campfire, laughing and singing campfire songs - although the latter had left most purebloods
"What are you doing, mate?", Ron asked, his gaze never leaving Draco, who was standing rather close to Harry - perhaps a little too close. "Aren't you coming?"
Perhaps he was scared; scared people would find out that Harry Potter wasn't mentally stable; scared they would look at him differently; scared his friends would see him as a different Harry and not the one they knew; scared his friends might actually start seeing him as a freak.
Weren’t they supposed to turn up now? Weren’t they supposed to come collect him? Why weren’t they coming to get him?
Rolling his eyes, Draco replaced Teddy’s small star-shaped hat on his messy, blond hair, charming it to not fall off that easily. “Alright then”, he said, a tender smile dancing around his lips. “I think it’s time we should go to the Burrow.”
People were fighting for their lives, yet all Harry could do was stand still and watch everything happen as if he were simply watching a film on the television like he had seen the Dursleys do many times before.
Harry laid a hand on the trembling lump of blankets as Draco took his other one, their fingers automatically intertwining. “Nobody’s going to take you away from us, Pup.”
Draco's gaze shifted to Harry's hands who - although they somehow managed to land safely onto the ground - were still clutching the handle of his broom in a vice-like grip, his knuckles as white as a sheet of parchment.
The girl had never done anything wrong to him. He didn't even know of her existence until a few weeks ago when he had first seen her on the Quidditch pitch.
Approaching the owl slowly, Harry took the letter from its leg, closely examining the rather heavy envelope. He shook his head, an incredulous yet fond smile lifting at the corners of his lips once he saw the familiar Hogwarts crest on the seal of the envelope. Leave it to Headmistress McGonagall to find a way to reach him, even though he had done everything to make sure he
"How dare you!" Salazar exclaimed, his eyes wide in horror. "And I was beginning to think you were on my side!"
Running a frustrated hand through his raven locks, Harry turned to look at his best friend, raising one of his eyebrows. "I think I can decide that for myself, thank you very much", he said curtly. He
How could he be so stupid? Once again, he had caused people nothing but pain and it was all his own bloody fault.
thought about was winning that damned cup! Fred and George were always complaining and making jokes about his obsession with winning. I'm fairly certain that if he could, the bloke would have married the bloody cup long ago."
As Harry stopped in front of her, she put a gentle hand on his shoulder and squeezed. “I’m glad you chose to come willingly, Harry. It makes this whole situation easier for everyone.” She smiled, or at least she tried to. Harry could easily see the pain shimmering behind her spectacles.
know someone. After all, sometimes people think it's safer to hide who they really are behind their masks of indifference."
"Just go, Harry", Hermione said quietly, coming to stand next to her boyfriend, whom took her into his arms again. "You're only making it worse for everyone."
He shouldn't have taken that Dreamless Sleep potion the night before. The way his body reacted to the potion afterwards really wasn't worth the two hours of sleep he had managed to get.
His heart felt like it had been stabbed, tears forming behind his eyes. Yet, he was angry at the same time. Not at himself, but for some reason - he didn't dare to name - he was mad at the girl; that gorgeous girl standing way too close to Draco.
Though, he had to admit the cheers of the students sounded an awfully lot like the cries from his 'vision' - if you could even call it that; an episode perhaps?
A quiet chuckle could be heard from the ground in front of the couch. "What's wrong?" Draco asked, catching Harry's gaze, challenging him. "Scared, Potter?"
Malfoy answered his smile with one of his own, although slightly hesitant. "I also wanted to say thank you", he continued. "You know, for saving us in the Room of Requirement and for you defending Mother and I at our trial."
Spluttering indignantly, Salazar placed a hand over his heart. "You wound me, Helga dear", he said loudly. "I was one of the best players of our time, mind you."
managed to speak for more than five minutes over the last week was in the Great Hall at a few mealtimes. But even then, Ron and Hermione had left the room before all the others had, claiming they still had a lot to do.
Groaning, Harry buried his head deeper into his pillow, immediately regretting it. He felt horrible. His whole body ached and his head felt like someone was continuously pounding on it from the inside out.
Luna giggled as she glanced in Draco's direction. "I've seen the way you look at him, Harry", she smiled, ignoring Harry's protests again, "And I've seen the way he looks at you too."
"Don't you dare act all innocent on us now!" Ron bellowed, his blue eyes narrowing dangerously. "We all know this is what you've planned all along!"
"Now, I'm sure you will all be tired from the long day. Have a good evening and I will see you all tomorrow in class." And with those words the Headmistress walked out of the room, her emerald robes billowing behind her in a way Snape would be proud of.
The silence in the compartment was slowly but surely becoming too much for Draco. He knew he shouldn't have told his friends yet. Still, they deserved to know. After all, they were probably the only real friends he had ever had.
"Weasley might be right", Draco said, taking a green apple from the fruit basked. "Potter is perfectly capable of looking after himself. He's made that clear on multiple occasions."
“Okay, okay.” Taking a deep breath, Draco met Harry’s gaze. “There’s something about the way you make me feel”, he took another deep breath.
Harry blinked a few times as he felt Draco release one of his hands to retrieve his broom from the grass.
There, right in front of him, stood a group of Slytherins, their wands held loosely in their hands. Draco recognised the group as the ones who had kept glaring at him in the Great Hall at the beginning of the year. He wouldn't have been surprised if they had been amongst the handful of people bold enough to shoot a stinging hex at him throughout the first month. They were cunning enough, though, not to get caught.
“You… you think I’m beautiful?” Harry asked, bewildered. Nobody had ever told him that. Nobody had ever cared enough to say something so… nice. He could feel his cheeks warming.
They both sent him cold glares before resuming their bickering that now didn't have anything to do with Slytherins anymore. Now, they were just arguing about whether they should shower in the morning or in the evening.
It was still dark outside, heavy clouds hiding the stars from view. If he had to believe the huge clock on the wall Draco had brought with him a few weeks ago from Hogsmeade, saying it would be convenient if they could keep track of time when Harry had given him a weird look- Harry knew Draco actually loved the clock, though he would never admit it out loud - it was around four o'clock in the morning.
Harry laughed at the small boy. “Of course we are, Pup”, he chuckled, “What else did you expect from Draco?”
A small gust of wind blew inside the room, his platinum hair falling slightly in front of his eyes and Harry thought - in that moment - that Malfoy looked like he came straight out of one of the portraits spread around the castle. He looked like he was
The way his pale hair contrasted with the darkening sky outside and the stars becoming more visible, Harry was reminded of their first day of the school year. Malfoy had been sitting in the window too when Harry had arrived in their room - much the same as he was now.
The corridors were dark as he meandered his way through, much darker than normal. He could hardly see anything in front of him and he had already managed to trip over some invisible rock three times in less than one minute.
Luckily, most of his year mates didn't spare him another glance. He was glad they were slowly starting to see him as one of them instead of the 'celebrity' most of the other people in Wizarding Britain saw him for. After all, he only wanted to finish his education after the unfortunate events the year prior, just like the rest of them.
"No, of course not, 'Mione", Ron said, leaning closer to whisper something in her ear, though Harry could still hear it loud and clear. "It has something to do with Head Boy and Head Girl", he smiled. "She has been so busy she had forgotten to assign them in the beginning of the year." His lips lingered a moment longer next to her ear, nibbling softly.
Harry absolutely loved it when Draco was being loud. Ever since they had moved to the cottage, they hadn’t had to use any Silencing Charms again – unless you counted the permanent Silencing Charm on Teddy’s and their bedroom, of course. They could be as loud as they wanted, screaming their pleasure to all who could hear. They didn’t care. And Harry absolutely loved every moment of it.
Draco’s head snapped up, barely contained excitement sparkling in the depths of his grey eyes. “Really?”
Seeing as they weren't going to stop any time soon, Harry glanced at his watch and decided to go upstairs to try and catch up - although reluctantly - on some sleep.
times. With their first match in three weeks, he wanted all of them to be absolutely prepared for anything.
McGonagall nodded in understanding. "Putting you all together might have been a poor decision on my behalf. My apologies."
And there… only a few feet away from him, sat one of the most stunning creatures he had ever had the blessing of laying his eyes upon.
Harry couldn't quite decipher what they were reading about. He never had been good at reading upside-down anyways.
“It’s an outer robe”, Draco explained when he saw the confusion still on Harry’s face. “I’m sure I don’t have to explain to you what it is, seeing as you have your own fair collection of them, Mister Head-Auror-To-Be.”
It had quickly become an unspoken tradition to spend their Saturday afternoon down there with friends. Even some lowers years, who had friends amongst the Eighth Years, were present from time to time.
Glaring at Pansy, Ron opened his mouth to probably say something that would make things worse, but was stopped by Hermione as she quickly placed a hand over his mouth, whispering something in his ear that made the tips of his ears go red.
would wait on the rocky shores of the island, their scales the only colour against the dull grey of the stones and the water.
Raising a dark eyebrow, Harry eyed the trunk in one of Draco’s hands. “What happened?” he asked, confusion lacing his words. “Are you leaving?”
Nerves started to kick in the closer he got. He will see his best friends again. His best friends with whom he had fought a war, friends who had stayed by his side no matter what, yet he had abandoned them. He had left them.
She wasn't stupid though. Even though she knew something was amiss, she hadn't tried again after that. If she had, she was sure it would have ruined their already fragile friendship.
As Harry lazily wandered through the castle, not really knowing where he was going - not that he cared anyways - he noticed that the corridors seemed to be darker than normal. Only a couple of torches on the walls were actually lit and the dark clouds of the night prevented any moonlight to come through.
But Draco was too busy with what was happening to really care about his precious broom. The group had taken yet another step closer, almost completely surrounding him now. He found himself with his back already pressed against the wall, his wand uselessly dangling from his fingers.
For about three minutes he managed to concentrate on his essay, scribbling down a few sentences that probably didn't have anything to do with the potion he was writing about. He didn't bother rereading what he had written down, however. His thoughts were too distracted.
Harry stared at Draco, racking his brain for a believably answer. He could easily say he was fine; he had done it a thousand times before. But something told him that Draco wouldn't believe him. Especially not after what had happened earlier.
Draco huffed, amusement visible in his silver eyes. "That as well", he smirked. "But it wasn't the only thing that made me smile. Because, sadly Potter, not everything revolves around you."
At the mention of the girl, Luna's face had completely lit up, every trace of sorrow or sadness gone as if it had never been there in the first place.
When Harry pulled back eventually, he was smiling broadly. “How about that walk now?” he asked. “A little midnight walk with your fiancé.”
The Dark Lord was standing on the opposite side near the door, his wand lying loosely in the palm of his hand. His red eyes were alert, contemplating if the young woman in front of him would be a difficult opponent or not.
But it had felt real; the sounds of people screaming, the feeling of the cold air on his skin, the smell of destruction and
Draco took a step back and patted the clasp once before turning back to the box and taking something out that looked suspiciously like a tiara…
Malfoy huffed a laugh, his fingers fiddling with the sleeve of his left arm. "Yes, but I still felt I owed you an apology."
The mayor sighed and squeezed his shoulder again. “You and I both know I wish things could have been different.”
the portrait swung open, revealing the corridor outside the Eighth Year common room. It was cold in the castle, the stinging autumn air coming through unrepaired cracks in the ancient castle walls.
Despite his reaction earlier that evening at Harry's close proximity, Draco now found himself to actually enjoy it. He relished in the warmth of Harry's body and how perfectly it fitted against his own.
building being constructed next door! Honestly!” He flailed his arms around wildly while he talked, a few strands of his messy, shoulder-length, blond hair falling in front of his eyes. “Not to mention the bloody neighbours! Haven’t Muggles ever heard of being more discrete whilst having sex? It’s not like the whole building has to bloody hear them!”
Nevertheless, he managed to spot the blurry shape of a blob on the ground near Potter's desk; a blob that was moving rather weirdly.
Ron huffed, but didn't say anything else so Harry bid the both of them - and Rowena too, of course - goodnight before heading upstairs to find his own room. He looked at all the names next to the doors, yet it wasn't until the very last door at the top of the winding staircase that he saw his name in beautiful, gold calligraphy next to a name in silver calligraphy.
Ron's hand squeezed his shoulder painfully hard as Harry stood up from his crouched position on the ground, turning his back to the body lying on the ground.
Even now, Draco wasn’t holding back the noises. He was squirming and moaning in Harry’s arms, rutting frantically against Harry’s leg, desperately searching for more friction.
“Hmm, if you say so, love”, Harry mumbled, taking another sip of his still steaming cup whilst easily avoiding the scone Draco threw at his head. “Besides,” he continued as if nothing ever happened, “it’s not like you
"Hey, I know you're tired, but you can't fall asleep here", Draco said, shaking his shoulder so Harry's head fell off it.
The portrait of the common room suddenly opened and in stepped a grinning Ronald Weasley. His hair was a mess as if he had been running his hand through it multiple times and his cheeks were slightly more pink, making the freckles on top look like tiny, dark ink stains.
After the war both Harry and Ginny had come to the conclusion that things had changed too much for them to still be together. So they had left it behind them, closing the chapter of their romantic relationship and starting a new one as good friends.
"Hmm", Luna hummed thoughtfully, "I also might have overheard Helga and Rowena gossiping to each other about the two of you," she giggled fondly, "but I do believe I have to agree with them."
The next time he had asked, Malfoy had even made a snide remark about Harry's inability to remember where he had put his stuff:
With the faint sound of the shower running in the background, Harry felt himself easily drifting off in a light slumber.
They had been running around in his head from the moment he had woken up, trying to drive him to his breaking point like they had done many times before. Not to mention the weird feelings he had been feeling recently towards a certain blond - and rather handsome - Slytherin.
Eventually he sighed, opening the door - although reluctantly - and walking onto the small landing outside the door. "Alright then", he said, glancing one more time at Harry who hadn't moved a muscle. "I'll see you in classes then. I'll bring you something from breakfast, if I don't forget."
started the whole thing? After all, who - in their righteous mind - would believe Death Eater scum like himself?
"Oh, get a room you two!" Theo exclaimed, an annoyed look visible in his dark eyes. "I have to see enough of that as it is."
Packing away his stuff didn’t take as long as he had expected. So it was only about half an hour later that he found himself standing in front of the Floo, the powder slowly slipping through his fingers.
"He'll be fine, 'Mione", Ron interrupted from opposite of her, his blue eyes looking sceptically at the four Slytherins next to them.
Harry laughed, throwing his head in his neck as he followed the blonde to the hall, his shoulders shaking with mirth. "I'll show you out", he offered, already reaching to open the door.
Once again, Malfoy turned around, although now his eyes were more curious - and a bit accusing - instead of spooked like only a few moments earlier. He raised one of his pale eyebrows at Harry, urging him to elaborate.
Draco moaned at the friction, his hands gripping Harry’s hips tightly for a moment. “Alas…”, he sighed heavily, releasing Harry, and taking a few steps back to create a little room between the two of them. Still, Harry could clearly see the lust and the desire swirling in the silver depths of his boyfriend’s eyes. “We don’t have time to do that right now. I’m sure Teddy’s already waiting for us.”
Blaise's eyes followed the girl, narrowing them as he gazed over his friend's shoulder, glaring at something behind them.
She looked to her left and was met by the icy blue eyes of Pansy Parkinson staring worriedly into her own.
Ron - now also flanked by his two best friends - opened his mouth to retort some nasty insult to the three Slytherins, but was interrupted by the strict voice of their Headmistress, "Mr. Weasley, Mr. Malfoy please refrain from whatever you were doing and join the rest of us inside." McGonagall gave the six of them a cautionary look. "We do not want a detention on our first day back, now do we?"
She had talked to Blaise and Pansy about what had happened and together they had helped him through the worst parts of it all, until he was able to go to an actual mind healer.
She looked each and every Eighth Year in the eye before continuing, "Seeing as technically you do not belong to your original houses anymore, I have made some arrangements in which you will have your own house, namely the Eighth Year House. You can still lose or gain house points and also have a chance at winning the House Cup if you so please."
Though his mind was screaming at him to get out, his heart desperately wanted him to enjoy this moment, standing so close to Harry
"I know, I know", Ron sighed, running a hand through his ginger locks. "But we will have to do with two Chasers for now, seeing as Neville is still recovering from his broken arm."
He had been sitting in the same spot for the whole day instead of going to the library: underneath a large willow tree whose long branches were delicately touching the velvet-looking surface of the lake.
And he was glad that - although they weren't together anymore - things hadn't really changed between the both of them.
Nobody said anything, so Terry continued, "Very well then. Congrats, Ron! You're our new Quidditch captain."
"Yes, okay, we get it", Harry said, scowling at the three Slytherins. Honestly, they were being extra insufferable today.
The two boys stared at each other for a long while before Potter nodded his head slightly. The movement seemed to be one of the hardest movements he had ever done - if the jerkiness of his nod was anything to go by.
, dammit – much like the one Harry was wearing. Only this one wasn’t gold with yellow, orange and red gemstones. This one was silver with white, dark blue and black gems. It shimmered in the low lighting of the room.
Draco shrugged as he sank further down in his seat. "I don't think I have many other choices if I want to start over, Blaise. It's not like people here in Britain will look past that disgusting Dark Mark on my arm and give me a proper chance to prove myself."
"Some people might find it disturbing if you keep staring at them like that", a dreamy voice said from Harry's left, blue eyes twinkling merrily in the soft light of the campfire.
His whole body was trembling like a leaf by now; every muscle in his body tensing painfully. He knew what was happening. He had been here before. He was standing on the Hogwarts grounds as people were fighting or fleeing around him, dropping dead as the killing curse - shot by one of the many cloaked figures - hit them unexpectedly.
It was already late in the afternoon of the following day when Harry joined his year mates in the common room. He had lost track of time when he was rewriting his Potions essay, causing him to miss both breakfast and lunch - much to the disapproval of Hermione.
A small, curvy woman clad in a long, yellow dress entered the portrait, a bright smile lighting up her round face. "You only say such nonsense because you are a sore loser." She chuckled as she turned towards Draco, her honey-brown eyes sparkling as she leaned closer, shielding her mouth with one hand and whispering, "He never got over it, as you can see."
“So”, Harry began, turning away from his reflection. He had been trying to figure out exactly what or who he was supposed to be, but the only thing his mind could come up with was the
Both Pansy and Blaise were here at the pitch and Harry thought he had seen Theo around here somewhere too. That meant Draco was completely alone...
The only times Harry had managed to forget about the bad things in his life, were the times he was up in the air and the times he got to speak with Draco.
know what I mean, Harry", she said, her eyes twinkling softly again. "You and Draco would be a lovely couple. A rather strange and unexpected, but lovely couple."
Was it the way Draco's eyes would light up whenever he talked about something he was passionate about? Or perhaps the way one side of his lips lifted up more than the other whenever he smiled? Was it the way he rolled his eyes when Harry had said something particularly stupid again? Or maybe it were the annoyed yet fond huffs whenever Harry asked to borrow yet another quill?
Running a hand through his hair, Harry turned to look at the campfire. He thought he could faintly see a pair of silver eyes glancing at him from the other side, but when he took a closer look it was already gone, as if it had never been there in the first place.
It hadn't gone unnoticed to her how much Harry had actually changed. Not only did he look thinner than he had ever been throughout the years, his behaviour had changed too.
"Plus," Ron added, still leaning on the door frame, completely unaware of the internal turmoil of his best friend, "I've heard they're pretty addicting too." He ran a hand through his messy ginger curls.
Harry shrugged, pulling Draco closer so they were standing chest to chest. “You got what you wanted, right?”
Three years ago, Lucius Malfoy had announced that Draco and Astoria were to get married once she became of age.
The Siren in front of him looked like pure silver, with long, white, almost translucent hair adorned with pearls and shells. Glistening skin that slowly merged into the silver scales of a long tail.
He could hear an annoyed huff followed by a grunt as the unconscious body of Oliver Gage was dragged away from him. Footsteps came closer and warm, gentle hands were placed on his shoulders.
“I can do whatever I want, Narcissa!” Father snapped. He pulled his arm away from her, his silver eyes burning. “I’m the head of this family! And if my own son does not want to obey, doesn’t want to fulfil the only thing that is expected of him as the heir of the family, I will not
Rolling his eyes, Malfoy handed him a fancy-looking, brown quill. The feather gleamed gold in the morning sun coming through the vast window. "You're lucky I always have some spare quills", Malfoy said, stepping out of the room.
Mr. Weasley was also sitting on the ground, his hand rubbing comforting circles on his wife's back, his eyes red and his lips trembling. Every now and again he would lean closer to Molly, whispering sweet nothings to try and calm his distraught wife down.
It wasn't often Harry got to see the Slytherin so relaxed. He liked this side of him better. It made him look younger. It even made him look kind of... cute.
After all, Luna had been the only one to know the truth so far and Harry had hoped she would stay the only one for a little longer. It had already been hard enough to tell one person, although he didn't regret telling her, but still...
during the chase of some drug-selling wizard – not to mention the juicy gossips that went around the Ministry about the daughter of some high-ranked Pureblood git who had run off to marry a Muggle in
Not to mention the almost irresistible urge to yell at the mysterious, brunette girl - Harry had learned her name was Astoria - who seemed to be at Draco's side wherever he went, her perfect smile never faltering, even when the other students clearly didn't hide their dismay for her companion.
Mrs. Weasley was sitting on the ground, cradling the head of her lost son in her lap as tears streamed freely down her face. Her loud sobs filled the quiet of the night.
“The whole point of what I’m trying to say!” Draco exclaimed, throwing his hands in the air. “I think I’ve lost it… oh Merlin, I’ve actually lost it!” He ran his hands through his hair, tugging at the blond locks. “I can’t believe I managed to fuck things up
"It's just... everything, I guess?" He shrugged helplessly as he fidgeted with a loose string on his t-shirt.
The thunder once again roared loudly outside as Harry made his way to the small, open kitchen and poured himself a big glass of water.
“Yes, I did!” Draco exclaimed. “I messed up the perfect opportunity to bloody propose to you! And it’s all my fault! How could I be so stupid?”
Every now and again, his eyes would wander to the other boy sitting in one of the two windows of their room. He was bent over his own parchment, his eyebrows furrowed in concentration and his tongue poking slightly between his lips. Every once in a while, he would look up and take a drag from his cigarette before turning back to his sketch, his piece of charcoal gliding smoothly over the parchment.
"I'm sorry", Harry choked out, taking a step backwards from the other boy. He couldn't do this, not yet at least. "I'm sorry. I can't do this."
he was going to stay at the old, dusty house. Nobody was supposed to know about his whereabouts. Even the owls hadn't managed to locate him, returning back to their senders with the unopened letter still in their beak or tied around their legs.
He felt his mother shake her head. “Don’t be sorry”, she said, pulling back so she could look him in the eyes. “Never be sorry for who you love, my dragon. Be proud instead.”
"Summer really is a lovely season, isn't it?" The smooth, dreamy voice of Luna Lovegood filled the - for once - pleasant silence. Her baby blue eyes glimmered behind the rim of her own teacup, an easy smile dancing around her lips. She was sitting on the windowsill next to him, her legs dangling over the edge. "The whole world seems to be alive and buzzing."
It didn't take him long to find it, however. There, in the middle of it all, the black mob of messy curls accompanied with crooked round glasses was trying to make their way through the crowd - and failing miserably.
Harry had exclaimed, glaring mockingly at the still laughing Slytherin, although he had been unable to ignore the warm feeling spreading through his chest at the sound of Malfoy's laugh echoing through their room. It definitely was one of his favourite sounds and he would love to hear it more often.
After what felt like years - but was probably only minutes - Draco had managed to get his breathing to even out, his body relaxing in the safe and warm embrace he was engulfed in. He didn't want to move away. He didn't want to lose this warmth.
Shaking his head, Harry opened his mouth to protest but Draco put a finger against his lips, silencing him.
He felt tired, yes, though he couldn’t ignore the faint thrill that had started growing in the pit of his stomach all afternoon. Tonight wasn’t over yet. It was All Hallows’ Eve; the one evening on which both Harry and Draco traditionally went trick-or-treating with little Teddy. They would Apparate or Floo to their friends’ and family’s homes, asking for candy, dressed in the most original costumes Draco had come up with that year and
Uncertain if he should, Harry chanced a look at the girl in front of him, seeing a whole mixture of different emotions visible in the depths of her brown eyes.
His joyful giggles echoed around the room as he ran out to go get his little costume, leaving the two men alone in the room.
Shrugging, Luna finally averted her gaze from the fire to look at Harry. An amused twinkle was visible in her dreamy, blue eyes as she lifted her hand and pushed against Harry's chin to close his mouth again. "You're going to catch Wrackspurts."
Later that day, they had decided to at least become friends, seeing as they were expected to spend a lot of time together in the future.
A sudden flash of light immediately followed by the ear-splitting roars of thunder made the small cottage tremble and shake. Teddy squeaked loudly and threw his covers over his head, hiding underneath them. Harry could see the small lump trembling violently.
With a huff, Draco stepped into the already green flames, Teddy holding firmly onto his hand. “We’ll see you in a bit then”, he said, winking before crying out
Harry didn't do any of that with Ron or Hermione, let alone with any of his other friends - even the mere thought of him doing any of that with Neville made him shiver unpleasantly.
Harry stepped forward again, taking Draco's hands out of his hair and entwining their fingers together. “Calm down, love”, he said gently, “everything’s fine. You didn’t mess anything up.”
They would all laugh at Harry's expression and the fact that he actually believed what they had said. They would all have a good laugh and Fred would stand up from the ground and hug his brother tightly with tears of laughter running down their faces.
They all turned around, only to find none other than Draco Malfoy standing in his Quidditch robes and with his broom firmly clutched in his hand. His grey eyes looked determined, though Harry thought he could see the slight uncertainty in them too; the edges coloured slightly red.
"Okay," Draco continued, "I want you to listen to my voice and do as I say. Do you think you'll manage to do that, Harry?"
so Ron continued once again, "Well, every house has its own Quidditch Team and since we can't play on the teams of the other houses, I thought it would be nice if we had our own Quidditch Team."
“No!”, Teddy exclaimed quickly, climbing clumsily off Harry’s lap. “I’m not scared of them anymore!” He ran the short distance towards Draco and threw his arms around the blond’s waist, his chin resting against Draco’s stomach as he looked up innocently.
It was quiet for some time. Harry was staring at their - by now - intertwined fingers. Draco's thumbs were still moving in slow circles over the back of his hands.
Harry nodded his head, though he couldn’t – for the love of every witch and wizard dead or alive – figure out what their costumes were supposed to be.
Malfoy held Harry’s gaze for a few more moments until he nodded his head in greeting, a small smile curling at the end of his lips before he turned back to the parchment in his lap.
Hermione, who was sitting in the armchair next to Harry's, snorted and looked up from the large leather-bound book she was reading. "Of course not", she said with an amused twinkle in her brown eyes. "He's just being dramatic for no reason."
And that was all it took for Harry to give in. He crouched down in front of the Siren’s bemused face, his knees scraping the rough stones.
was filling in the paperwork of closed cases and filing it into one of the many boxes littered around his private office.
about me? Oh!" - he gasped, placing a hand dramatically over his heart, his eyes wide - "Can you imagine! The great Draco Malfoy, Prince of Slytherin, caring about
"Well, look who finally chose to bless us with his presence!" Seamus exclaimed from one of the armchairs at the opposite side of the room with a content and half-asleep Dean in his lap. "If it isn't our Saviour!"
"Oh, don't be so sour, darling", Pansy grinned, patting his head a few times. "We all know you're our one and only Drama Queen and
And apparently, as it so seemed to be, that was the last little push Draco needed before he tumbled off the edge.
Harry nodded, smiling back, though he couldn't dismiss the feeling that something felt off. Something was missing. Even high up in the air, he hadn't been able to shake off the feeling of it. Like a piece of a puzzle was missing.
Her attempts hadn't gone unnoticed by the others either and soon enough, almost all Eighth Years were following her lead. They talked to Harry occasionally, walking with him to classes or sharing some sweets they had bought in Hogsmeade the other day. The dynamics between all the Eighth Years had changed slightly from still being tentative towards each other to an unspoken camaraderie.
was very addictive. So, that's why he had promised not only himself, but also his two best friends he would cut back on the consumption of the drug-like potion. Hermione had even offered to take away his stash so she could hide it from him, but Harry had politely declined, claiming he could manage on his own, thank you very much.
Harry watched quietly as Draco took Harry's other hand in his own and leaned closer, his grey eyes boring into Harry's. "Why?", he asked softly, his thumb absentmindedly caressing the back of Harry's hand, "Why do you keep lying to everyone? To yourself?"
Harry looked around the other Weasleys, his eyes landing on Ginny. She stood quietly between Percy and Charlie, the latter tightening his protective arm around his sister as he glared daggers in Harry's direction. Ginny's usually bright brown eyes met his briefly before she looked away from him again as if ashamed.
Often, Draco would be seen walking with some of his friends down the corridors, but never alone. Probably to prevent students from doing him more harm. With the Ministry breathing down his neck, Draco couldn't afford to be involved in any fights. They would gladly throw him in Azkaban for that.
"Are you going to keep standing there and stare at me like a buffoon?" Malfoy asked, not bothering to look up from his sketch.
Malfoy waved away the words. "Don't mention it", he said, taking a deep drag from the cigarette before looking back at Harry and the food on the plate. "Now eat", he said pointedly. A few lingering clouds of lingering smoke came out of his mouth and nose as he spoke, "I do not fancy force-feeding you like a baby."
It wasn't supposed to be empty, though. McGonagall had made sure of that after poor Neville had been locked out the common room on one particular night a few days ago. It had been Filch who had found him after Peeves had gone through the corridors yelling about some students out of bed.
A mischievous glint flashed through Draco’s eyes as he tightened his grip on Harry. “You,” he mumbled, his face only inches away from Harry’s, “will find out in a bit.” And with those words, he took a few steps backwards out of Harry’s embrace.
When Head Auror Robards had offered Harry the position of DHA a few months back – shortly before the man announced he was going to retire soon – he had grabbed the opportunity with both hands. But what he hadn’t known, though, was that he would be stuck behind his desk at the offices more often than not, instead of doing the real work out on the field.
Draco was wearing the same thing as him. Relief flooded Harry at that thought. Perhaps he wasn’t that stupid after all.
"I have no idea what's going on", Neville muttered, shaking his head at the group. He had been half-following the conversation whilst explaining to Hannah what the pros and cons were of Devil's Snare. Still, he had no idea what to make of what just happened. More than anything, it left him more confused than before.
"Ah, of course", the Gryffindor Founder smiled understandingly, a thoughtful expression crossing his face as he stroked his beard with his free hand, the other still running through the lion's mane. "Nightmares truly are a horrific phenomenon. When I was - well, still alive, I should say - I also used to have them frequently. Their horrors would sometimes even haunt me at day."
As Harry walked further and further away from them, he could feel his world slowly caving in. He had lost it all. There was nothing left here for him anymore. He was done; done with everything.
Do normal friends place a finger under the other's chin to bring their faces even closer? Close enough for their lips to almost touch...
A forced smile curled at the end of Harry's lips. "Of course 'Mione", he said. "I'm fine. No need to worry about me."
"That was brilliant, mate!" Ron exclaimed, clapping his best friend on the back as he landed, dismounting his broom with the Snitch firmly clutched in his fist.
The second time Harry had asked Malfoy to borrow a quill, he had sighed and had thrown one at Harry's face without looking up, even though Harry swore he saw the corners of the blond's lips lift up slightly.
It had been quite a long time since Harry had seen his best friend as happy as he was now. His heart contracted painfully as thoughts of his nightmare from last night resurfaced. The cold look in Ron's normally light blue eyes, the painfully tight grip he had had on his shoulder, the rude words he had spoken before Harry had left...
As everybody rushed to their dorms to find out with whom they will share a room for the next ten months, Harry stayed behind in the - now abandoned - common room. He didn't feel like going to probably his and Ron's room, having to listen to Ron's endless blabbering about the Chudley Cannons' bad performances lately.
Harry choked on his own saliva, spluttering and coughing his lungs out as he sat upright, Hermione patting him on the back with an amused smile tugging at her lips.
Now thoroughly confused, Harry turned back around to continue his way, but stopped when he heard a noise coming from further down the hall.
As the group started making their way back up to the castle for lunch, Harry managed to grab a hold of Draco's sleeve, pulling him back. "Can I talk to you for a moment?" he asked Draco whom had turned around, a questioning eyebrow raised.
Groaning, Harry leaned back into his chair, running a tired hand through his unruly hair. He hadn't written anything new in over half an hour. The only thing that
However, Harry knew the other Seeker didn't stand a chance against his Firebolt. It would be highly unlikely for them to catch up on him, seeing as his broom
"Anyways!" Seamus quickly said, effectively cutting off a very angry-looking Ronald Weasley before everything exploded. "Harry, perhaps you have someone in mind who can be captain then?"
So, no. Perhaps they weren't just normal friends. But why couldn't he tell Draco how he really felt though? Why was all of this so bloody confusing?
It was storming outside. The wind was howling, the rain was pouring and every now and again a flash of lightning closely followed by the roaring sound of thunder would join in, causing the whole ground to tremble violently.
Turning his head, Harry glared half-heartedly at the Slytherin's back. "Thanks", he muttered, "I hadn't noticed yet."
But all in all, their home was truly perfect, an exact representation of their relationship. In every room, you could find at least two soft, warm rugs – very handy if they didn’t manage to make it to the bedroom in time. The floor to ceiling windows were decorated with heavy curtains in all different kinds of colours – because even after a week’s long argument they still hadn’t been able to come to an agreement to which colour of fabric would go best with the rest of the house. Every corner was filled with different kinds of plants and photos – both Wizard
Draco wasn't really paying much attention to the boy next to him, though. Instead, he chose to observe his two best friends and the way they would look at each other with one of those lovesick smiles etched onto their faces.
"I'm sorry", he whispered quietly. He had started shaking again without him noticing and new tears were streaming down his face.
Confusion crossed Ron's face, his eyes narrowing and glaring at Draco. "Are you sure you don't need any help with the Ferret?"
A smirk appeared on the blond's delicate features as he shrugged. "Fine," he said, "have it your way."
Now that he actually thought about it, he wouldn't mind to share a room with someone else than Ron. Maybe it would be a nice change for once.
A laugh escaped his throat as she said this. Of course she wouldn't believe him, she never did. Though it was worth the try.
Harry, on the other hand, had tried to act as if nothing had happened, pushing away any thoughts of Draco to the back of his mind by busying himself with his friends or drinking some of the suspicious beverage Dean and Seamus had made.
He hated to admit it, but - despite the pain and the headaches he had to endure when he awoke - he was getting quite addicted to the potion, depending on it more often than he would like.
The way she had asked the simple question made it look like she had only done it to be polite. But the three Slytherins - and Draco was sure even Theo - knew better. They could easily sense the hidden concern behind it and Draco couldn't help the smile spreading across his face.
“Oh!” Harry exclaimed when he saw Draco standing in his living room. He quickly dropped the spoon on the counter, his cheeks flushing. “Draco… I uhm… I didn’t expect you to be so early.”
Reluctantly, Harry had turned back to his essay, taking a new parchment to restart once more. Luckily, thanks to Hermione's help, his essay would at least be Acceptable now.
None of the Four Founders was present... again. The portrait was completely empty, even though a few weeks ago McGonagall had made sure there would
If Hermione saw him like that, she would definitely kill him, but not only for being late. Ron had lost count of all the times she had scolded him for turning up to classes looking like he had just rolled out of bed - which most of the times he had. Though, he couldn't help but love her even more for it. He knew she cared about him, even if it didn't always seem that way.
Not wanting to risk having an upset Hermione Granger, Harry obediently ate all the food, thanking her kindly as he ate the last crumbs of the treacle tart on his plate.
. I started posting the chapters of Downhill on there too in smaller parts and I also post some of my Tumblr stuff on there too.
appeared on the parchment were dark ink stains from where his - once again - borrowed quill had been hovering above it.
Harry poked at the little food left on his plate. He didn't really feel like eating anymore, not that he'd eaten much of the food anyway.
“The question you were asking before you decided to completely ravish me”, Draco explained, his lips brushing ever so slightly against the sensitive skin of Harry’s neck as he talked. “What our costumes were supposed to be.”
All hope of them joking was lost as Harry turned the corner and disappeared out of sight. He walked, farther and farther away, past the still empty portrait to the Eighth Year common room.
Anyway, I really hope you liked this chapter (and the whole story so far). Let me know what you thought, I'm really curious!
A small, yet genuine smile lifted the corners of his lips as he returned the hug, hugging her as best as he could with one arm; his other hand was still very much preoccupied with holding Draco's hand, their fingers firmly intertwined - not that either of them seemed to mind much about that.
“I know.” Mother was standing next to him now, one of her hands softly touching his elbow so Draco would turn to her. She smiled sadly.
It appeared that he - amongst every other student who hadn't got the chance to finish their final year at Hogwarts due to last year's events - was invited to go back for a so-called 'Eighth Year' to complete his education and hopefully receive a diploma.
"Just go, Harry", Hermione suddenly said, coming to stand next to her boyfriend. "You're only making it harder for all of us."
But who would want to be with a Death Eater like himself? Who would ever be able to look at him and not see him for the boy with the disgusting Dark Mark, but for who he really is? Broken and in need of someone who truly understood him. Someone who could love him unconditionally.
However, before he went inside, he glanced back at Harry still standing in the empty corridor. He opened his mouth as if to say something, but shook his head. "I'll see you around, Potter", he said instead and went inside, leaving Harry alone.
Though that didn't stop her from at least making sure he had eaten something every day, or trying to engage him in conversation in the common room, much to the boy's chagrin at times.
This was all his fault. He was responsible for this; just like he was responsible for all the others too.
Eyes widening and breath catching, Harry looked at the Slytherin in complete shock. Draco had winked at him; he had
He walked to one of the golden armchairs in front of the fireplace, sinking down into the soft cushions. The colours were very different from the ones in the Gryffindor common room, but - weirdly enough - Harry didn't really mind. He had thought he would miss the warm scarlet and gold more.
Excited claps and cheers rang in the air, Pansy running up to them and throwing her arms around the blond, her delighted voice audible above all the other noise.
“Bloody, fucking hell!” Draco exclaimed loudly, throwing his hands in the air before letting his head fall into his hands. “I can’t actually believe myself! Could this get any worse?!”
So here he was, trying to find his way through the maze of corridors in the enormous castle without so much as a light to guide him. Even the moon he had seen earlier through one of the windows in his room was gone, hidden behind the large mess of dark clouds.
Another group of people passed on the street below, their drunken giggles filling the warm evening air. Harry closed his eyes, letting his head fall back on Draco’s shoulder. “I could go for a little walk, right now.”
They walked the small distance to the golden bed. Harry happily crawled under the covers, not even bothering to change into his pyjamas. He nuzzled his head in his pillow, sniffing the familiar scent of his own shampoo. "Thank you, Draco", he mumbled, a tired smile lifting the corners of his lips.
“I’m not done quite yet”, he smiled. “As I was saying, you make me feel powerful, Harry. Whenever you’re by my side, I feel like I can take on the whole world. So that’s why…”, Draco fumbled for something in one of his trouser pockets, “that’s why… hold on a moment, I can’t find what I’m looking for.”
At some occasions, his mother would sit with him, her bright robes blending beautifully with all the different types of flowers around them. They would talk about things that had happened at the Manor or they would sit in peaceful silence, relishing in the beauty and the warmth of the earth.
Uncertain of what he might find around the corner, he tightly gripped his wand and shuffled forward.
Now turning back to look at the other boy, Draco rolled his eyes. "Of course, you would say that", he said, placing his hands on the edge of Harry's desk and leaning closer. His warm, minty breath ghosted over Harry's face as he spoke, "That's why I'm not asking you to come. You're coming with me, willing or not."
They had done it every year after that. However, with the storm still raging over a large part of Britain, Harry feared this year they wouldn’t be able to go trick-or-treating. Apparating in a storm wasn’t a good idea, after all.
Shaking his head furiously, Draco clutched his book to his chest, his gaze fixated on a spot on the ground. A lump had formed in his throat, his mind focusing on everything around him.
He reminded Draco a little of his younger self with the way he seemed to look down at Draco - although he was taller than the boy - and the way he lifted his chin in the air as if he owned the place. Younger Draco would have done exactly the same - if not a little more dramatic.
Grumbling under his breath, Harry complied – only a tiny bit reluctant this time, seeing as he had managed to steal another quick yet passionate kiss before Draco literally kicked him out of the room and into the bathroom to change.
Strong arms wrapped around him, the comforting scent of Harry’s shampoo filling his nose. “You’re not alone, Draco. You will always have a family.”
Unfortunately, his decision to stop using the potion also meant his nightmares had returned - the very reason he had even started taking the potion in the first place. He had known from the moment he had closed his eyes to sleep, they would come back at full force.
Uncorking the small bottle, Harry poured the liquid in his mouth, closing his eyes as he felt the pain slowly fading away. He sighed contently as he stretched and walked to his desk, gathering all the materials he would need for the many assigned essays this week. He already felt ten times better.
So of course, he had expected the fiery redhead to be angry at him. He would have been surprised if she wasn't. He had just completely left without so much as a sign of life for
Taking a step in the direction he had come from, Harry shook Ron's hand from his shoulder, retrieving his wand from the ground. "I'm sorry", he whispered, his voice wavering slightly. "I didn't mean for any of this to happen. I really wish things could've ended better."
It sounded like someone was crying, quiet sobs filling the otherwise silent corridor. But why would somebody be crying in the cold corridors at this ungodly hour of the night? It couldn't be Moaning Myrtle; she hardly left her bathroom...
Teddy nodded his head against Harry’s chest, not saying anything as Draco stroked comforting circles on the small boy’s back.
He should have just asked the Ministry to transfer him immediately to France so he could join his mother. Maybe there he wouldn't be looked at as if he was the worst person to ever walk this earth.
Harry swore he saw a tear running down her cheek when she turned back around and strode to the village, leaving him standing alone on the dark and suspiciously empty rocks.
Ron scoffed, rolling his eyes. "Oh yes, I'm sure. That's why most of the Death Eaters we've fought against were
Grumbling under his breath, Harry had complied, although reluctantly – though Draco didn’t need to know that; he still valued his life, thank you very much.
Luna had been visiting him frequently since he had arrived at the old, cranky house. One way or another - he still didn't know how - she had been able to find him, though he was certain he had made sure nobody
Frowning, Harry took a step closer, before realising he probably shouldn’t. Though, the Siren didn’t seem to mind. “I don’t understand”, he said, “aren’t I supposed to be ‘sacrificed’?”
Harry couldn't prevent the fond smile from appearing on his face as he rolled his eyes. "Of course not, Gin", he said, motioning his hands at them to go away. "Go ahead."
Hermione look up from her book, her head tilted in silent question. "The both of us? Why would she want to talk to us? We haven't done anything wrong, have we?"
them. He can tolerate them to a certain degree, though Harry was fairly certain his fiancé wasn’t planning on accompanying him to any Muggle shop anytime soon. Not after the – rather hilarious, Harry thought – incident in an electronic shop. Draco may or may not have ended up with cursing a toaster they were testing, causing the toaster to sprout flowers from the moment you put bread into it – much to the shop owner’s utter confusion and Harry’s amusement. Though Harry hadn’t bothered asking Draco to join him after that.
“Of course”, Draco said, smiling brightly. “We won’t let anything get to you, Ted. Not even those horrible and evil Thunder Gods.”
Harry rolled his eyes. "Of course not, you tosser", he smirked. "I just wish I could have seen you lose again." A smirk of his own appeared on Harry's face. "We all know
It didn't take long for Ron to join the party too, wrapping his arms around his best friend and girlfriend. "Welcome back, mate", was the only thing he said before his voice broke, a lone tear escaping his eyes.
Stopping their conversation to listen to what Pansy was saying, Blaise and Theo nodded. "She's right, Dray", Blaise said. "You know what happened last time."
For the whole week, Harry had looked forward to this moment, imagining him and Draco flying through the air after the Snitch, teasing each other and giving each other secretive smiles or even some bloody
Harry nodded, a smile of his own tugging at the end of his lips. "Of course, 'Mione", he said. "I've been through worse."
Peeking up at Harry through his blond lashes, Draco gave him an incredulous look, both eyebrows raising towards his hairline. “Did you really think this was it?”, he asked, his voice accusing. “Honestly, Harry,” he drawled, “you should know better than that by now.”
Luna sighed as she leaned closer to Harry, resting her head on his shoulder. Though the gesture wasn't something big, Harry always felt a little better knowing Luna was trying to lift his spirits, if only by a little.
Draco must have thought the same as he squeezed Harry’s hand in silent comfort and pressed a light kiss on Harry’s shirt-clad shoulder.
Apparently, those words were all it took for Draco to tip over the edge. His frantic movements came to an abrupt stop as he cried out, Harry’s name repeatedly falling from his lips as he buried his face in Harry’s neck.
He didn't want to show his sketches. Not yet, at least. He didn't want Potter to know everything and ruin the fragile friendship - if he could even call it that - that they had formed so far.
When she had given it back to him, Harry had thanked her once again, offering her his help whenever she would need it. She had shaken her head, a fond smile playing around her lips before saying,
"Remember, Harry", he said, looking directly at Harry who was still sitting in the armchair. "You have to look deeper than the surface to
Shoulders slumping, Harry looked at the other Weasleys, his gaze eventually landing on Ginny, who stood between Percy and Charlie. He gave her a pleading look.
A faint blush coated Draco’s cheeks, a smile appearing on his lips. “Shut up”, he muttered. He leaned in, touching his lips softly against Harry’s for only a moment before pulling away again. “Now, we should get ready too. It’s already getting late.”
He felt absolutely drained to the bones. It had been quite a long time - a little over a month - since he's had a full blown panic attack like this. Yes, he's had a few moments where he's had to use his many grounding techniques for the most stupid things like him not finding a matching pair of socks or a staircase moving when he was already halfway to the top. But he had always been able to shake it off.
The first thing Draco noticed, as he stepped out of the familiar Floo, was the sound of the Wireless blasting music.
Taking a deep breath, Harry took another sip of his wine, swirling the liquid in his mouth before swallowing. It had been two years now. Two years of them living in that cosy apartment Draco had talked to about. And two years of Harry very slowly learning how to communicate with the locals. Though he would never be as fluent as Draco, his French had improved immensely. At least now, he could ask for the right bread at the bakery.
But Draco shook his head. “Nothing is going on”, he said softly, “I just…I need to tell you something.”
Her face softening even more, Astoria kissed the top of his blond head, a smile lighting up her doll-like face. "Of course, Dray", she said. "Don't worry about it."
Throughout the whole day, he had felt like he could fall asleep wherever he was, even if he was standing at that given moment. He didn't care. He just wanted to close his eyes and doze off... if only for a few minutes.
Understanding flashed through Luna's eyes as the girl nodded, squeezing his knee gently. "You're still having nightmares?"
With a deep sigh, Harry eased of his filthy, muddy shoes and hung his wet coat on the rack next to the others. The fire in the hearth was blazing merrily, casting a soft hue over the living room and kitchen of the cottage. Draco had already arrived home.
No, instead they could sit in silence for hours without having to say anything to one another, simply enjoying the other's quiet yet amiable company.
Draco was still standing next to the couch where Harry had last seen him, looking as regal as ever with a soft smile decorating his delicate features. Even from the other side of the room Harry could see and
Harry huffed, raising an eyebrow in playful challenge. "Who are you to command me like that?" he smirked. "I don't recall agreeing to being bossed around."
He had ruined it again. He had managed to ruin a perfect opportunity. He had managed to ruin whatever they had going on between them. He was sure Draco would easily go back to hating him, and Harry couldn't even be mad at him for that.
He looked up at Draco, his smile widening. His hands had almost completely stopped shaking, his breathing had evened out and he was leaning slightly against Draco.
Alright... He had been asking himself that question many times, but if he was completely honest he hadn't been alright for quite some time now.
Draco felt his chest tightening, his breath speeding up a little more. Although the little voice in his head was jumping up and down in excitement at the rather close proximity.
It was one of his happiest memories from when he was little. Him and his parents were happily sitting under one of the blossoming apple trees in the orchard, laughing and listening to stories Lucius was telling - probably about some fool he had met at the Ministry.
With a small, fond smile on his lips, Harry crawled off the bed and stalked towards Draco, wrapping his arms around the other man’s waist as soon as he was close enough. He pulled Draco flush against his body, their foreheads touching. “You’re going to be such a good father when we get our own child one day”, he whispered, one of his hands coming up to cup one of Draco’s cheeks.
Rolling her eyes, the mayor shook her head. “I can’t say I’m going to miss your ‘brilliant’ sense of sarcasm.”
He huffed in exasperation and tried to look over the heads of the students to find the culprit of this stupidly unnecessary gathering.
The words that had been ready to come out of Harry’s mouth died on his lips. Teddy didn’t want to lose them too… How could he be mad at his godson for reading forbidden books when he had said such a sad thing. He had no idea Teddy had thought like that, but it hurt knowing the boy was scared of losing them too. He had already lost too many people in his young life.
Sighing for what felt like the hundredth time, Harry shrugged hopelessly. "I think 'troubled' is putting it lightly", he smiled sadly. "Couldn't sleep again."
Harry thought for a moment. He immediately thought of Ron and knew he would be a great captain if he really wanted to. He just needed a little push to boost his confidence and everything would be alright.
When he had emerged from the bathroom, Draco was already standing in the living room, his white angel costume – consisting of a tight, white t-shirt with large wings on the back and white leather trousers – a stark difference from the dark and gloomy atmosphere of Harry’s flat.
Harry thought as he positioned his body even further to the front of his broom, the action causing him to wobble slightly. It was a risky move - if the gasps he heard from the students in the stands below were anything to go by - but he managed to pull it off easy enough.
"Granger gave it to me", Malfoy continued when Harry shot him a questioning look. He sat down on the sill of the now open window, one of his legs dangling over the ledge. His sketchbook was perched against his other leg, a freshly lit cigarette placed between the fingers of his right hand. "She told me you skipped dinner today, as well as breakfast, and she asked me to give you that plate." He motioned his head towards the still full plate. "She also said - well, more like
Harry laughed at the dark blush creeping up the ginger's neck and onto her freckled face. He threw his head in his neck. "Hello to you too, Gin."
Harry walked down the last stair and started meandering his way through the packed room towards one of the empty armchairs near the fireplace; the one he almost always sat in.
Harry nodded quickly, taking another sip from his tea to hide his face. "Of course. Why would I lie to you?"
She leaned closer to him and laid her head on his shoulder; just like she had done many times before over the summer. "Have you used the journal I've given you yet?"
He wished he could find someone who would look at him like that: with love clearly visible in their eyes. Someone who would hold him in the middle of the night when the nightmares managed to overtake the little happiness he had still left in his life. Someone who would whisper sweet nothings in his ear to try and calm him down when even the grounding techniques his mind healer had learned him didn't work.
Draco wasn't someone who backed down from a challenge this easily because he was scared of losing. He had
Mrs. Weasley let out a heart-breaking sob at that, her shoulders shaking violently as she stroked the ginger hair of her son.
This was all his fault; all the deaths were his fault. Fred's death, Remus' and Tonks' deaths. Even Sirius' and his parents' deaths were all because of him. If only he had been faster, if only he hadn't been alive...
Surprised at what his best friend had said, Ron turned on the chair, all anger and hatred he had been feeling a few seconds ago disappearing immediately. Slowly but surely, a smile grew on his still slightly red face.
Sighing deeply, Harry ran a hand through his hair, causing a few strands to stick up in different directions. "I...", Harry began, "I'm fine."
And with a last smile, Luna let go of his wrist and walked out the front door, her blonde curls swaying in the slight summer breeze as she walked. Once Harry felt her cross the heavy wards that guarded the old house, she Disapparated from sight.
"You've done well, Malfoy", Ron said as everyone had landed safely onto the ground. "The position is yours."
Draco shrugged. "Not all of us are always as depressed as you are, darling." He winked at Harry before turning back around and walking further down the stairs.
He should have expected this. He should have seen this coming. His father would never accept him for the way he truly was…
"I don't understand why that potion is still legal", he added under his breath as Harry pushed past him, walking back into the room.
Still confused and feeling very stupid because he had probably looked over the other half of the costume and Draco would definitely complain about blind Gryffindors and their inability to find something even when you would hold it right in front of them, Harry opened the bathroom door.
Draco didn’t answer. He couldn’t. He felt oddly numb, though the reality of what had just happened was slowly creeping closer.
To say people were starting to worry about what had happened to their Saviour - their friend - would be an understatement. Nobody had a clue about where Harry had gone off to and if he would ever even return. For all they knew, he could have already been dead.
and getting caught by a teacher or prefect. He has had enough detentions to last him a lifetime, thank you very much.
"Harry?" Hermione's worried voice drifted through the low buzz of voices in the Great Hall, her big, brown eyes eyeing him thoroughly from the other side of the table. "Are you alright?"
Draco's questioning gaze had returned, but yet again Harry shook his head, giving the blond a tentative smile. "I'm fine", he mouthed.
Draco shook his head, a teasing smirk tugging at the corners of his mouth. “Nope, we don’t have time, love”, he said. “Now, go to the bathroom and change!”
It had felt like he was trapped inside his own mind, not being able to gain control. Not enough, at least, to focus on controlling his breathing. He had been stuck in a spiral of the same thoughts, repeating over and over, holding him in their claws and preventing him from escaping. If it hadn't been for Astoria breaking through, he was certain he would have still been sitting there: a curled up and whimpering mess.
The soft voice of Ginny Weasley drifted through the silence as she sat down next to him, her arm slightly brushing against his own. Her brown eyes were looking out over the lake.
"Draco can try for Chaser, if he's still allowed to", an unfamiliar voice called from behind the group.
Draco had blurted it out, apropos of nothing, just at the moment Harry had taken a sip from his wine.
The wind was howling in his ears, his heart beating rapidly and his veins full of adrenaline. The rush of finally being back in the air, the gold-winged ball fluttering right in front of him as he chased after it, Harry hadn't felt this good in a very long time.
“I’m really sorry, Ted”, Draco said, a sad smile on his face as he carded his long, pale fingers through Teddy’s now messy, blond locks – a combination of both Harry’s and Draco’s hair.
"What do you want, Gage." His voice sounded surprisingly flat, devoid of any emotion. He knew better than to let them see what was going on inside his head. It would only work in their favour.
Gage was the smallest one out of the five, his dark hair neatly combed to one side, a few strands covering one of his eyes. The other eye was glaring at him, his lips curling into a sneer Salazar Slytherin would have been proud of.
his mother in telling the Wizengamot how they had saved his life multiple times during the war. If it hadn't been for his testimony, Draco was sure they wouldn't have been let off so easily.
They couldn't remember a time where they had laughed that much, seeing as with the looming return of the Dark Lord back then, their families had been quite uptight.
It was at times like this he truly despised his fame. After disappearing off the radar for the whole summer, he had hoped the excitement about him defeating the Dark Lord would have calmed down a little. However, as he leaned against the wall of the train corridor with a heavy sigh, he couldn't have been more wrong.
"You don't look so happy, Harry", Neville noted, looking up at him from his place on the ground next to the coffee table. Hannah Abbott was sitting next to him, a large book of Herbology in front of the two.
," McGonagall said, giving them all a pointed look, "you only get one chance. If I find that this privilege is being misused, I will not hesitate to give all of you an early curfew and a couple detentions."
The orange/golden outer robe flowed down his body, pooling at his feet in a sea of fabric that rippled softly with every movement. The colour of the robe went beautifully with his maroon shirt and even his olive skin looked a deeper brown now. The robe gave off an elegant, yet strong and powerful vibe. Like Harry was the king of the whole universe. And even though there was only a faint hue of the fireplace in the room, the yellow, orange and red gemstones on the golden tia-
Cold, blue eyes stared back at him. "We don't want you here, Harry", Ron said, his voice as chillingly cold as his eyes.
Seamus wiped it away with his thumb, cupping his cheek. He leaned forward and kissed the other boy, Dean responding by wrapping his arms around Seamus' neck and pulling him closer.
"Hey, hey, it's alright", Draco said quickly, squeezing Harry's hands, his thumbs never stopping their movements. "Try to take deep breath first. There's no need to rush anything, okay? Take your time to reply."
“Oh, yes”, Harry chuckled, “Because of Teddy and certainly not because I told you I’m not wearing any pants underneath these trousers.”
Pansy had given her some pretty good advice on how to tame her - although now less - curly hair and Hermione in exchange had helped the Slytherin girl with her Ancient Runes essay.
"What the bloody hell is going on here?" His voice echoed through the small corridor, making the crowd fall silent.
He had packed his bags at the Burrow where he had been staying at that moment and had said goodbye to the Weasley family - with the promise of writing at least once a week, of course. Molly had embraced him tightly with teary eyes before he'd said his last goodbye and had Apparated to 12 Grimmauld Place.
"I have to share a room with Blaise bloody Zabini!" Ron's arms swayed around dramatically and Harry couldn't resist but to roll his eyes at his friend's antics.
Draco had been in a sour mood for most of the day, scowling at anybody who had tried talking to him. And by looking at his reaction now, Blaise realised it might have something to do with the Golden Boy.
"Says the one who probably won't even try out to be on the Quidditch Team anyway", Justin Finch-Fletchley joined in. Theo ignored him.
The mayor greeted him on the rocky shore, her eyes soft and apologetic. Harry had always been rather fond of her.
Compared to the other tables though, the Eighth Year table was relatively more quiet. Of course, you would hear someone laugh occasionally about something that had been said, but it wasn't the same as it used to be.
Draco was still standing on the balcony, his silvery blond hair gleaming in the light of the street below. He was staring at Harry, a look in his eyes that hadn’t been there in months. His hands were clasped in front of him, though Harry thought he could see them shaking slightly.
Awoken by the noise of the students in the corridor, Pansy lifted her head from Blaise's shoulder and glared daggers at the door. "Why can't I have a nice and peaceful nap for once?" she grumbled, already starting to get up and tell them to bugger off. "Some people need their beauty sleep."
The morning before his eighteenth birthday, Harry had been sitting in one of the comfortable armchairs with a hot cuppa of Earl Grey in his hands after a rather rough and sleepless night when all of a sudden he had felt something cross the heavy wards he had placed around the old house.
“I have tried to change his mind.” Mother’s voice drifted into the darkened room. Draco could see her silhouette standing in the doorway behind him through the mirror on the mantelpiece. “He’ll come around eventually. But you know he’s a stubborn man.”
He looked up at the two men, a huge grin plastered on his tiny face. He squealed loudly when Harry picked him up and placed him on his hip. “We’re all matching!”, he exclaimed, clapping his hands together repeatedly.
The ginger held up his hand, interrupting Harry once again. "Save it, Harry", he spat, "I don't want to hear any excuses from you anymore. Leave."
After many cold and wet months, August had been unusually hot in England. The once green grass had turned a dry yellow, the leaves on the trees were shrivelling up underneath the hot rays of sunshine and even the birds seemed to have lost their will to fill the air with their cheerful chirps.
He wouldn’t last much longer and if the crescendo of Draco’s moans and cries was anything to go by, neither would he.
And even though Harry had laughed at the ridiculousness of his boyfriend’s behaviour at that moment, now he had to admit he used the mirror more often than not. Not that he would ever tell Draco that.
“I also didn't know you could draw", he continued, popping a piece of the tart in his mouth. It was only then that he realised how hungry he actually was.
He missed going out in the field. Not that there wasn’t any work for him besides paperwork – on the contrary – but as Deputy Head Auror the only thing Harry had been doing for
Draco nodded, standing up and walking towards his desk where he safely put away his sketchbook. He wobbled slightly on his feet as he stumbled to their wardrobe, taking a pair of his pyjamas. All the while he could feel Potter's concerned gaze following him around.
touches they exchanged whenever they were talking to the other. He wondered how long it would take them to realise their feelings for each other.
Perhaps it had something to do with the fact that his parents were taken away from him on this particular day. That also meant many other things were taken away from him, such as his chance at having a happy family who truly loved him for who he was - not one that was forced to take him in and practically treated him like their personal slave just because he was different.
Not to mention all the utter rubbish the Daily Prophet published about him every day. From rumours about his love life - because apparently he had a love life
Draco squeezed Harry's hand comfortingly while he was talking to Blaise and Pansy. The gesture immediately calmed Harry back down.
Terry waved his comment away. "Yes, yes, we know, Weasley", he said. "Now, are there any more objections?"
Though he hated how concerned she could be at times, he also couldn't help but be grateful for her perceptiveness. Without it they wouldn't have come as far as they had now. It had saved them multiple times over the years.
As Voldemort opened his mouth to speak the curse that ruined Harry's life, Lily's eyes met Harry's, their gazes locking for a moment. He stumbled backwards, his eyes wide as his mother gave an apologetic smile.
Ron closed the door behind him, his footsteps fading away as he made his way down the stairs towards the common room.
"Oh, come off it, Ron", Hermione exclaimed, taking one of Ron's hands in hers and dragging the loudly protesting boy with her towards the castle. She turned around and smiled knowingly at Harry before saying, "We'll see you in the common room, Harry!"
What if Draco would be his solution for those invisible Wrackspurts Luna always saw? What if Draco would be his solution to his nightmares, like Godric had told him about a few weeks earlier?
At the beginning, Draco seemed to struggle a bit, but he soon got the hang of it, throwing and catching the ball as if he had been doing it his whole life, dodging a Bludger every now and again with remarkable ease.
He had smiled at the girl when she had given it to him, thanking her politely, though he had known he wouldn't do much with it. Really, he wasn't planning on keeping some sort of diary. He was sure - after all that had happened - he had grown out of that stage.
“Don’t worry, Draco”, Harry said softly, his thumb drawing invisible patterns on the back of Draco’s hand. “You know I would never force you to leave here if you don’t want to, even though my flat isn’t the best.”
Once he was sure his friend wouldn't burst into his room again, Harry fell down onto his bed, cursing himself when pain shot through his head.
backed down from an opportunity to beat Harry at something - especially something as simple as Quidditch.
The trembling lessened slightly, Teddy tentatively poking his head from underneath the blankets “Really?”, he asked quietly, his eyes still watery and his cheeks flushed.
But with Draco looking at him like that; like he understood exactly what was happening to Harry; like he truly wanted to help him with whatever was happening to him...
Just like most days, it had been a rather boring day at the Auror’s offices for Harry. He had been doing paperwork
Draco had been delighted when Harry told him, rambling on and on about a cosy apartment he had found in a small village. He had wanted to move as soon as possible.
When she had asked him that question the first time she had come around, he had lied to her like he had done with the countless of other people who had asked him. However, she hadn't taken his
", Gage growled lowly, his hot breath ghosting over Draco's face. He had grabbed the front of Draco's robes and had pulled him closer, completely oblivious to the still rising panic inside the now slightly shaking boy.
“You have to promise me one thing, though”, Harry whispered, his eyes closed as their foreheads rested together.
The other four chuckled as they all took a few steps closer to Draco, causing him to take a step back, his breath catching in his throat as he noticed the wall being closer than he remembered it to be. They were going to close him in completely.
"You haven't eaten much, Harry", Hermione noted, ignoring the chewing sounds coming from the boy next to her. She gave Harry a pointed look.
“Yes, I did”, Teddy said, louder this time. “But I didn’t mean to, honestly! I just stumbled upon them and… and… I picked them up and started reading them. But I wasn’t planning on reading them though! Please Haz, I don’t want them to take me away from you and Dray. I can’t lose you too…”
Biting his tongue to prevent himself from saying anything that would get him into more trouble, Draco kept quiet. He knew what they were trying to do, but he wasn't going to take the bait.
Rolling his eyes, Draco's lips turned into a smile of his own. He locked gazes again with Harry for a moment and then winked at him before returning to something Pansy had said.
The smooth voice broke through Harry's thoughts, filling the silence in the common room. "Or should I say night? Morning, perhaps?"
Draco returned the glare, already opening his mouth to retort a nasty comment, but one look at Pansy's cautionary eyes, Blaise's raised eyebrows and Theo's slightly shaking head, made him close it again.
Was he really willing to go back so soon? Did he really want to drown in the attention people would give him all over again? Was he ready to face his friends again, knowing how disappointed - and probably furious - they were about him not telling them where he was?
"Of course we are, love", Blaise replied, rolling his eyes playfully. "Although life will be different without you, mate."
"Alright then", Ron said, standing up and stretching his arms above his head. Harry flinched at the sound of one of his joints popping loudly next to his ear. "McGonagall said we're allowed to have two players of each house on the team. Something about more unity, I assume. So everyone who wants to try out, I will meet you next Saturday morning at ten o'clock sharp after breakfast on the Quidditch pitch."
Every word felt like a heartless punch to Harry's face. Realisation slowly made its way through the haziness that was his mind. "George, I-"
Eventually the feast ended and prefects started to lead the students of their houses to their common rooms. The Eighth Years stayed behind, waiting for Headmistress McGonagall to show them their own common room.
It wasn't big, yet big enough for two people with two beds, two desks and one big wardrobe they probably would have to share. A fireplace divided the room in half and - just like the common room - the furniture had or the colour gold or silver.
Draco, on the other hand, had flushed a deep scarlet, the tips of his ears burning as he shot Pansy another glare, her shoulders shaking with mirth.
Though who could blame him? Ron had worked his arse off over the last month to get his team in top form for the match and his efforts had clearly shown their worth.
Nodding his head, Harry turned around and slowly made his way down the corridor from where he came, lingering for a moment in the hope they would call him back and tell him it was all a joke; a joke the Weasley twins had come up with.
He cursed under his breath at the sight of their messy wardrobe. All their clothes - mostly Harry's though, Draco would
The grip on his robes suddenly loosened as the heavy - now unconscious - weight of his attacker slumped against his body, causing Draco's legs to give out underneath him. He slid down the wall, curling up as small as he could as he clutched his head between his knees, trying to get his breathing under control by focusing on the sounds of his surroundings.
Though Draco had his own flat on one of the side streets at Diagon Alley, the people who lived in his building weren’t the most welcome towards him. Even his landlord – an old man with a stomach so big Harry wondered how he even fit through doors – hadn’t been very civil towards Draco.
Harry visibly flinched at that, causing Ginny to withdraw her hand. "I'm fine", he muttered lowly. "You don't have to worry about me. I've told all of you
The sound of the door opening caused Harry to break free from his thoughts. Footsteps were walking around the room and he could just see the top of blond hair out of the corner of his half-closed eyes. The quiet humming of an unfamiliar song filled the silence.
"Alright!" Ron said loudly, getting the attention of the gathered Eighth Years. "I think it's time to announce who has made it on the team."
Harry started out of his thoughts, spluttering in protest at the girl's words. "I... I don't... I don't know what you're talking about."
The Siren smiled, revealing a row of sharp teeth. “Of course not, you would have been long gone if you were.”
So yeah, have a nice day or night or whatever time it is when you read this and I will hopefully post the next chapter earlier than 5 months ;)
They had encouraged him at times he thought he would have given up. They had held him as he cried into their shoulder at times where all the bottled up emotions came flooding out at once. They had even stayed awake the whole night with him when his nightmares had become so bad he was unable to fall back asleep.
Harry had given him a questioning look when he had put up the full-body-length mirror one evening, a few years back. “At least then I know how good I look whenever I exit the house”, Draco had said defensively, daring Harry to say anything else.
Of course, Draco hadn't been at all pleased with the news, thinking Astoria would just be some stuck up pureblood girl who only wanted him for his family's wealth and name. But as some years had passed and they had gotten to know each other better, Draco had actually grown to like the girl and they had become quite close friends. You could say she was the sister he never had.
Ron and Hermione, on the other hand, looked at Harry as if they had just seen a ghost. Different emotions flashing behind their wide eyes.
Perhaps sharing a dorm with the Saviour of the Wizarding World wouldn't be as bad as he first thought it would be.
Of course he was very grateful for the outcome of both his and his mother's trial. They could have ended up in Azkaban amongst his father and several other Death Eaters. Fortunately for them Harry Potter had chosen to speak in their favour on their trials, defending both Draco
Silence again filled the compartment after that as its occupants didn't really have anything else to say. Instead they just enjoyed each other's quiet company; something they had done countless of times before in the Slytherin common room over the past seven years.
"There are a lot of things you don't know about me, Potter", Malfoy said, finally glancing at Harry, who was sitting on his bed, trying his hardest not to spill any of the delicious dessert on his clothes. Unfortunately it seemed to be an impossible task as he managed to drop his piece at east three times in less than a minute.
He had to get out of here, but he couldn't. They blocked every exit, their bodies pressed tightly together.
Ron and Hermione had somehow disappeared between then and the moment Harry had started talking to Luna. How they had managed to do that without someone noticing, Harry didn't know. And where they had gone to or the reason
It hadn’t been his idea to go live on the countryside, surrounded by nothing but fields and hills, away from all the hustle and bustle of London, though he couldn’t say he regretted it one bit. Draco had been the one to suggest the idea three years ago.
"Well..." Godric paused, pursing his lips and for one moment Harry thought the man would tell him off for asking such ridiculous questions. One could not easily stop their mind from creating dreams, after all.
But now - as he was sitting in his armchair in the common room - he asked himself if he actually still could manage on his own. He was extremely sleep deprived and with the amount of homework assignments the teachers kept giving them, he never went to bed early either.
A trembling voice broke the silence of the corridors. Harry jumped at the sudden sound, his heart beating wildly in his chest and his wand raised, ready to attack anyone who dared to cross his path.
Confused, Harry watched as the mayor nodded her head and started to walk away. “Goodbye, Harry,” she said as she looked back over her shoulder, “You will be missed dearly.”
A mischievous smirk had found its way onto Harry’s face as he took the crown and stepped into the green flames. After all, he wouldn’t miss the chance to tell everyone how his fiancé had almost forgotten his beautiful
Even now - sitting at the Eighth Year table with laughter surrounding him - he could feel the nasty looks that were sent his way. He was convinced it wouldn't take long for some students to take revenge for all the things he has done over the past years. They could easily corner him and hex him or beat him to a human pulp and he wouldn't be able to do anything about it. He couldn't defend himself - not without getting into trouble. And he surely couldn't rat them out either, since that would only cause things to get worse.
"Well, well", said one of them, taking a step towards where Draco was standing. Draco thought his name was something along the lines of Oliver Gage - or was it Nicholas? He wasn't entirely sure. Not that he cared anyways.
Harry snorted, shaking his head. "I'll eat it later", he said, motioning to the plate. "After I've finished this essay."
"You haven't answered any of our letters", she continued as she crossed her arms over her chest, fixing him with an accusing glare. "Mum has been worried sick. She thought you'd finally had enough of our family. She thought she had lost another bloody son!"
"Alright Eighth Years," McGonagall said as she came to stand at the head of their table, "your common room will be located in the additional Eighth Year tower, which I will show you in a second after we've made some clear agreements."
Harry's eyes widened as he shook his head violently. "I think you're getting the wrong ideas", he said. "I don't know what you're talking about."
Draco nodded, though his smile suddenly disappeared, a serious look taking its place. “Of course, if you’re too scared of the Thunder Gods coming to get you, we can stay home and simply watch an uhm… what do Muggles call it again? You know, that thing with the moving pictures?” He looked at Harry for help.
Draco lifted his head to look Harry in the eyes. From this close Harry could clearly see all the different emotions swirling around in the deep, silver depths that were Draco’s eyes. That was the thing he loved most about Draco. He could be as cold as ice to some people, but whenever he let his guard down his eyes were almost as expressive as Harry’s own. Sometimes they didn’t even have to speak with words to understand each other. Sometimes a look said more than a thousand words.
Surely, he must have misheard Ron? Fred was his family too; so why wouldn't they want Harry to be around anymore?
So when they had first formally met each other - three years ago at Malfoy Manor - she hadn't been that excited either. She had been rather rude and slightly disrespectful towards the Malfoys - to great disgust of her parents.
family. And although Teddy technically wasn’t his own child, Harry didn’t care. He cared for the little boy as if it were his own and he knew Draco did too. Maybe one day they might adopt a child of their own, but for now they were more than satisfied with having Teddy around most of the time.
“Yes, of course!” Harry placed a kiss on the palm of Draco’s hand. “The most important thing is that I love my
Draco squeezed Harry's hand again, letting go of the other and placing a finger under his chin so Harry was forced to look at him. Their faces were only a few inches apart. "You don't have to lie to me, Harry", he whispered, his minty breath ghosting over Harry's lips, "I don't want you to lie to me."
A smile of her own appeared on Rowena's full lips as she clapped her hands together, her eyes now scanning the students behind the Headmistress. "Oh, that must be our Eighth Year students!", she exclaimed happily. "Welcome back. My name is Rowena Ravenclaw. I am one of the Four Founders of Hogwarts and I - together with my three companions - will be guarding your common room."
"I've already told you," Harry mumbled, his voice low and annoyed, "don't worry about me. I'm fine. Just not hungry at the moment."
Everyone looked expectantly at Ron, whose cheeks slowly flushed a light pink at the sudden attention he got. "Uhm... I uhm... We could... I mean if it's...", Ron stammered, running his hands repeatedly through his flaming red hair. He groaned in frustration at his own inability to form a coherent sentence.
“All of those feelings I’ve got, I can’t explain it. I know I sometimes second guess your intentions, even after all these years we’ve been together. But we’ve come so far and I sometimes find myself wondering if this…” Draco gestured around him, “if this whole life isn’t some kind of joke, some kind of dream. I’m scared I’ll wake up one day and everything will be gone.”
Silver eyes narrowing, Draco glared at Harry. “Whatever, you Know-It-All-Muggle-Professional. I should’ve let you dress up as Granger instead.”
Why won't they go away? Why wouldn't they leave him alone? Why wouldn't they take a few steps back so they weren't standing as close as they did now?
The two words were still ringing in his ears as he sat up in bed, untangling his legs from his covers. He was covered in sweat, his hands shaking uncontrollably and his breathing irregular as tears were freely streaming down his cheeks.
He turned towards the other two Chasers, nodding his head at them. They both mounted their brooms, pushing of the ground and flying into position in the air. The two Beaters followed quickly, their bats held firmly in their hands.
Draco stood in front of Harry, his silver eyes roaming over his face, searching for something Harry didn't know. The intensity of Draco's eyes sent shivers down Harry's spine as the blond's face became less blurry with every second.
Draco was rudely awoken by the sound of something heavy falling on the ground. Still half-asleep, he sat up in his bed, trying to find whatever it was that had fallen down. It was dark in the room and his tired eyes had trouble focusing on anything.
Draco’s pink lips curled into a smug smirk as he approached his little devil boyfriend, wrapping his arms around his waist once he was close enough. “You look devilishly delightful, darling”, he whispered, his hot breath ghosting over Harry’s exposed neck. “I could take you right here, right now.” He rolled his hips into Harry’s to confirm his words. The feeling of Draco’s already very prominent erection made Harry’s breath hitch in his throat.
Draco nodded, promising to talk to her soon as the girl made her way back towards the Slytherin table.
Harry eyed the girl sitting next to him, though he had to squint his eyes slightly to actually focus on her.
"What?" Harry repeated, glancing at the four Slytherins on the couch - well, three on the couch and one in front.
Knowing he would never fall back asleep now, Harry swung his legs over the edge of the bed, stretching his arms above his head. Quiet as not to wake the sleeping boy in the bed next to his, he sneaked out the room, descending the winding staircase to the abandoned common room below.
Why couldn't they just leave him be for once? Who even cared about what type of aftershave he used in the morning? Or what brand of toothpaste he had? Or - even worse - if he slept
A smile appeared on Harry's face as he heard his best friend mockingly repeat his sister. He could only imagine the way Ron was looking, his face not far off from that of an angry, ginger toddler.
The second thing he noticed was the voice screaming the lyrics to the song. Always slightly off-key.
A breath - Draco hadn't realised he had been holding - escaped his mouth. He honestly hadn't thought his friends would react as well, if not better than his mind healer. He had expected them to start yelling at him - mostly Pansy though - telling him that he was about to make a mistake; that things wouldn't be better in France than they are here.
But before he could take hold of the doorknob, Luna caught his wrist, her slender fingers wrapping firmly around it. She turned back towards Harry, her intense blue gaze freezing him in place.
As a very annoying hand kept poking the side of his head, Harry didn't see another option but to wake up from his for once relatively peaceful sleep. Still half-asleep, he managed to sit up in his chair, the annoying hand still poking the side of his head. "What...", he grumbled.
"Draco?" Astoria called out to him, Draco protesting as she pushed him slightly away from the embrace so she could look at him. She brought one of her hands up to cup his cheek, her thumbs wiping away some of the tears that were still streaming down his face. She smiled at him; a bright, loving smile, though Draco didn't miss the sadness that flashed through her dark eyes. "You're okay", she said firmly.
Once again, the disappointment was very badly concealed – he had to work on that, Harry thought. He felt his heart break a little more at the sound. He truly hated having to disappoint his godson. He didn’t deserve that.
His cheeks flushing pink, Theo turned back to his staring contest with the flames in the fireplace, ignoring the snickers around the room.
His breathing had quickened, his heart pounding in his chest as his throat closed up, unwanted tears building up behind his eyes.
"Healer Glover was rather supportive", he said to his friends now, the tiniest sliver of a smile twitching at the end of his lips.
Mrs. Weasley let out another heart-breaking sob at that, her fingers stroking the ginger curls of her late son.
Harry turned around to look at the girl, his head tilted in question. "What's wrong?" he asked, concern clouding his features.
Even though they had never officially announced it, it was still as clear as day Ginny and Luna were together. You would have to be blind not to see the way the two of them looked at each other sometimes; it wasn't like they were hiding it anyways.
Gratefully munching on the food, Harry had promised Hermione to be more on time for classes - much the same as Ron had done a few days prior. Still, the three friends knew Harry wouldn't be able to keep that promise. He had tried many times throughout the years, yet he never seemed to succeed.
Harry could see the colour shine brightly under Draco’s touch as he moved it around Harry’s shoulders. It was only then Harry realised the fabric wasn’t just fabric – or even a curtain. Honestly, he should have known better. Draco loved making costumes. So, to presume this year their costume would simply be a shirt with a pair of trousers was just ridiculous.
And if he needed a late-night talk in the common room after a rather stressful day, both his friends would listen and talk with him until none of them could keep their eyes open for much longer.
From that moment, Draco had known he wouldn't actually mind being married to a strong minded woman like Astoria. She might have actually been one of the few good things his father had even done for him.
Loud screams were coming from all-around him as he looked around. The Quidditch pitch had changed. The ground was littered with large pieces of stone, which looked suspiciously like pieces of the castle walls. People were running around, screaming their lungs out as they jumped over what Harry thought to be bodies lying on the ground, unmoving, their eyes staring unseeingly at the darkening sky above.
Next to him, Draco suddenly sat up, a bright smile lighting up his whole face. “Hey Teddy?”, he asked the boy as he scrambled off the bed. “Remember I told you I had bad
Harry balled his fists and clenched his jaw, trying very hard to stay calm in the suddenly far too loud room. His hands had started shaking and his breath became uneven as he fought his way through whatever was happening to him.
Malfoy huffed, running a hand through his hair before staring back at his reflection, his wand now safely tucked away in one of his robe pockets. "Anyway," he said, "what are you still doing here? Breakfast is almost over and classes are about to start."
Rubbing his eyes, he stared at his - still mostly empty - parchment, willing the essay to write itself. Maybe if he stared long enough he might also see double the amount he had already written.
Smiling widely, Harry nodded his head. “Absolutely”, he said, “You’re not the only one getting tired of having to listen to our neighbour’s apparently very active sex life every morning
Malfoy rolled his eyes at him before turning around and opening the compartment door he had been leaning against earlier.
The silence that followed nearly suffocated Harry as he stood in the doorway of the narrow door, not trusting his legs enough to take another step forward.
Now both of them were free again to love - and perhaps eventually marry - the person they truly loved.
It didn't take long for the ginger to fall down on the golden sofa next to Harry's armchair, taking deep breaths to calm down his racing heartbeat.
He knew what he had to do next. Healer Glover had prepared him many times for moments like this, yet most time he had to do it for himself as he fought his way through a panic attack of his own. "You'll be okay, Harry", he said, squeezing his shoulder again. "You'll be okay. I'm here."
"Oh, uhm..." A sheepish smile appeared on his face as he scratched the back of his neck. "Well, as much as I would be honoured to be our captain, I don't think I'm the right person to do that right now."
"Please", the voice - Harry now recognised as his mother's - whispered softly. She sounded as broken and defeated as Harry felt himself.
Yet the hands didn't go away. Instead they pulled him away from the cold wall, his head coming in contact with something soft and familiar, the scent of lavender and grapefruit filling his nose.
"Look where you're going, Weasley", Malfoy muttered his silver eyes narrowing momentarily. Pansy and Blaise came to stand either side of him, just in case.
“Of course you could,” Draco’s lips brushed the side of Harry’s neck, “you and your strange midnight walks.”
"Well, that's fantastic, Draco!" Pansy exclaimed, clapping her hands together. "She really deserves some happiness after everything she's been through."
Ginny honestly didn't know what to say anymore. She had tried talking to him many times over these two weeks of being back at Hogwarts, yet nothing seemed to work.
This scared him to no end. What if it happened all over again? What if he would have to start all the way back from the beginning? He had thought he was getting better. His healer had
"I don't think you have to worry about Astoria either", she continued. "She's a very lovely girl, though I'm fairly certain Draco doesn't really swing that way."
Harry looked down at his lap, his cheeks flushing even more as he ignored the smug expression crossing the girl's face.
Beaming at the boy next to her, Astoria gave him a quick peck on the cheek. "Very well actually. I'm glad you're okay though."
Luna pursed her lips, her face turning thoughtful as she picked a biscuit from the plate on the side table next to the window. "I don't think I believe you."
"Speaking of your other three companions," the Headmistress said, "weren't they supposed to be here too? To greet our students?"
He often found himself not having the energy to get out of bed, causing him to be late for many classes. He skipped more meals than ever, never feeling hungry anymore or simply forgetting to eat. And not to forget his darkening thoughts.
It had taken Harry 3 months to think it over, eventually deciding that, yes, moving to France wasn’t that bad of an idea.
“You look absolutely stunning, love”, Harry growled against Draco’s neck, rolling his hips forward again and relishing in the amazing friction that caused. By now he had Draco pressed against the wall next to the fireplace, one leg between Draco’s legs.
Shaking her head, Astoria placed a finger underneath his chin, turning his head so he was forced to look at her.
Draco shrugged, turning his head away as he looked at something outside one of their windows. Harry thought he could see the blond blush though.
"We asked you if you wanted to become captain of our Quidditch Team, Potter", Pansy drawled. "Maybe if you would stop daydreaming about Draco over here, you would have actually heard what we were talking about."
So he wasn’t really surprised when two men of the village came barging into the small cottage he had managed to build for himself not long after he turned of age. He wasn’t surprised when they hard-handedly took him outside, not leaving him any time to say goodbye to Flo, the old stray dog he had found a few weeks earlier.
Hiding the emotions - and slightly rising panic - behind his mask of indifference, Draco sighed and ran a hand through his loose, blond hair.
Harry rushed to the family he called his own and dropped down on his knees next to Fred. Tears were already streaming down his face.
Everybody knew, however, that Neville wasn't particularly good - if not horrible actually - at flying on a broomstick. Let alone him flying
However, she hadn't missed the ways his eyes turned into hard emeralds. Or the way he had clenched his jaw, his features hardening as he built up strong walls around him to prevent anyone from getting through or from knowing the truth about what was
Feeling the blush creep up his cheeks at being caught staring, Harry quickly averted his eyes. Instead he opted for checking out the room.
"Go on without me, Ron", Harry interrupted, squinting at the buttons on his shirt. His vision kept blurring every few seconds. "I'll be fine. I don't want you to be late because of me again." He nodded towards the door, urging Ron on.
"These two colours are your new house colours", McGonagall explained. "You're new robes, as well as you luggage will be sent to your dorm which you will share with one other student. Your names are engraved next to your doors."
Draco tightened his grip on the handle of his trunk. “I think he’s had enough time to get used to the idea of me being…”
Though he couldn't help but try one last time. "Brilliant", he responded, willing his lips into a - what he hoped to be - reassuring smile. "I'm doing brilliantly."
The first thing Harry noticed when he opened the door to his new dorm was the scraping of charcoal on rough parchment. The room was cold, shivers running all over his body at the low temperature. Though August had been hot, the weather had turned completely around in only a few days.
His still damp hair clung to his forehead, falling down in front of his eyes and Harry had to restrain himself from brushing the strands away from those two beautiful, silver eyes.
Anthony rolled his eyes at the Slytherin. "I still think we should give him a chance. We can always choose another captain if really necessary."
Draco’s smile softened, his hand caressing Teddy’s blond hair. “Alright then, Champ. Let’s get dressed then.”
Malfoy rolled his eyes. "Of course", he ginned, his silver eyes locking with Harry's. "My apologies, your Majesty."
"Please consider using that journal, Harry", she said. "I know you think it won't help, but you never know." Her eyes darted around the entrance hall of 12 Grimmauld Place, a sad smile appearing on her lips. "It also might be the solution to finally get rid of all the Wrackspurts around here."
She had also noticed how he seemed to space out during classes more often than not. Or how he didn't really laugh with the jokes their fellow Eighth Years made. Not to mention the times she had found him working on homework assignments even
Before Harry could answer, she turned away from him to face the ocean, her hand falling from his shoulder as she did so.
Draco had closed his eyes, mentally bracing himself for the familiar pain to hit him somewhere in the face or the stomach. They always aim for the face or the stomach.
Furrowing her eyebrows slightly, Luna narrowed her eyes at him. "Are you sure?" she asked, the dreamy undertone in her voice now gone.
Yes, he appreciated his best friend’s attempts to still include him, he really did, and it wasn’t like becoming DHA had been a mistake – absolutely not. He just couldn’t help but feel an emptiness creeping inside his chest at the thought of not belonging to the group anymore; of missing out on all the fun…
Malfoy shrugged as he put a worn and old-looking book in his satchel. "I always have some emergency potions for when the need would arise. You know, just in case."
"Breakfast's ending soon", Harry noted, eyeing the numbers of the watch on his wrist before turning to his friend. "You should go down to the Great Hall, Ron. Hermione is probably waiting and you don't want to be late, do you?"
He rummaged through a drawer in his own desk next to Harry's, pulling out his - what Harry thought to be - sketchbook and making his way to the window nearest to his bed, a piece of charcoal firmly clutched in his left hand.
George emerged from between his brothers, stepping towards Harry. "Ron is right." His voice sounded hoarse as he met Harry's gaze, a haunted look clearly visible through all the grief in his eyes. "You should go."
Harry chuckled then, peeling Draco’s hands away from his face and leaning in to place a soft kiss on his lips. “If it helps you at all,” he whispered, “I would gladly marry you.”
So, that left Harry alone again, though he didn't seem to mind as much as he thought he would. Maybe it was the alcohol in his system talking, but still, he felt more relaxed than he had felt that afternoon.
"Oh, come on, Granger. You have to admit it was becoming rather exciting", Pansy smirked, winking at the two boys in question. "I bet you it wouldn't have taken much longer until they would have started a good ol', traditional fistfight."
Draco’s eyes widened, barely suppressed desire flashing through them. “What are you waiting for then? Come on, you slug”, he said impatiently, throwing the powder into the hearth. “No time to lose! We don’t want Teddy to stay up too late, now do we?”
They both stood up from their places on the armchair and turned to Harry. "Will you be alright without us?" Hermione asked, giving him a gently smile as she tried to hide the obvious blush on her cheeks.
"Don't worry too much, Hermione", came a whisper from next to her as the brunette felt a hand being placed on her arm. "He'll be alright."
Of course, he wasn't going to tell them that; just like he wasn't planning on telling them how he had been feeling over the last month. They didn't need yet another concern to be added to their already long lists of tasks they were expected to do since they had become Head Boy and Girl. They were busy enough as it was. The last thing Harry wanted, was to be a burden to them; to anyone, really...
Malfoy sniggered at Harry’s struggling, putting away his sketchbook and closing the window. He ignited the fireplace with a simple flick of his wand. "Honestly, Potter," the blond smirked, "haven't you ever heard of manners?"
Never in his relatively short life had he expected this conversation to go as well as it did. It even felt like him and Potter had been friends for a few years - if you didn't count the small, awkward silences, of course.
He could see Draco blushing even harder, a small yet genuine smile lighting up his face. "Thanks", he said. "I would say the same for you, but I haven't actually seen you play."
Of course, Draco had calmed him down, reassuring him that it didn’t matter anyways; that one day, they would find their own home and be happy.
"Oh, you poor thing." Draco rolled his eyes and turned back to his sketch, smiling softly as he started to recognise the scene he'd chosen to draw.
“Enough, Draco”, Father continued. His voice sounded drained, though his face was an impassive mask. “We are done discussing this. You will do what is expected of you. What is expected of every Malfoy. And that’s final.”
"So tell me, Draco," Astoria said, placing a small hand on his arm, her sweet smile never faltering, "how have you been?"
"How did you know where I was?" Harry asked surprised. He hadn't expected Ginny to be the first one to find him. Knowing Hermione, he had expected her to be first.
It was still hard to believe how those two had ended up together. Especially since he thought Blaise hadn't shown any interest in Pansy whatsoever over the last couple of years. Yet he couldn't deny they didn't fit together either. They easily completed the other in a way Draco wished someone would complete
Harry rolled his eyes as Draco draped the robe over his shoulders, fasting it with a small, sun-shaped clasp. “Of course I know what an outer robe is, you prat”, Harry said, shivering slightly when Draco’s fingers brushed against the sensitive skin on his neck. “I just hadn’t expected another part to the costume, that’s all.”
Harry took another handful of the powder and went to throw it in, but something caught his eye. There, on the coffee table lay another tiara – no, a
And second of all, the landlord had threatened Draco more than once to kick him out of the apartment because some neighbours had complained about Draco making loud noises even when he had barely set a foot in his own apartment ever since he and Harry had gotten together.
Silence filled the room, the only sound coming from the dancing flames in the fireplace. Harry stared at the fire, admiring how the flames slowly destroyed the log. The way they surrounded the whole piece of wood, swallowing it until it literally fell apart and ruined its shape - its form - until the only thing left were its ashes.
Harry noticed that he - like Blaise - was smoking a cigarette as he listened to whatever the girl was saying. He smiled fondly every now and again or added something to the story and Harry suddenly found himself wishing it were
People were dancing and singing on the streets below, the orange-yellow hue of the streetlights making everything look ethereal. It was Harry’s favourite time of the day. He had just eaten a delicious home-cooked meal and was now relaxing with a glass of wine on the balcony, enjoying the slightly off-key French songs filtering up from the crowds below. The iron railing of the balcony was adorned with wisteria, the sweet smell filling his nose.
“Of course, Mother”, Draco said. He stepped into the Floo, a fresh hand of powder slipping through his fingers. “Goodbye.”
"Indeed they were, young man", Godric smiled, a faraway and glassy look in his dark eyes. "It's a shame it had taken me so long before I truly saw them for who they really were, though. It would have saved us a lot of fights and nasty words."
Shaking his head, Harry offered Ron his plate, the latter gratefully taking the piece of meat and starting to eat it, earning him a few disgusted glares from their friends around them.
Ron stood behind him; an intense, cold expression on his face as he stared down at his best friend. "We don't want you here, Harry", he said sharply.
A startled yelp suddenly sounded from behind him, the yellow robes of the Hufflepuff Seeker disappearing from sight as they were hit by a well-aimed Bludger from one of the Eighth Year Beaters - Harry thought he could faintly hear Terry Boot's triumphant howls.
Turning around so he was now facing Ron, Harry tried to smile but it only turned into a painful grimace. "It's nothing. I'm fine", he said softly. "Just a small headache."
But why wouldn't his mind believe those words? Why did he always feel the need to apologise profusely after something like this happened?
The other Weasleys were hurled together, trying to find some sort of comfort in each other. Even Hermione stood between them, tightly clinging to Ron who had his strong arms safely wrapped around her trembling frame.
Draco's mother, Narcissa Malfoy, had been put on house arrest in their manor in France. It was one of the reasons why Draco had chosen to go to France after Hogwarts and not some other country. That and his ability to speak fluent French, courtesy of his pureblood upbringing.
It didn't take him long to put the pieces together. The blob wasn't actually a blob, the blob was Potter sitting on the ground next to his fallen chair. He was clearly having trouble breathing; Draco would have recognised that sound from anywhere.
"You should tell him what happened", she simply said and Draco knew from the tone in her voice that there was no room for debate. He would have to tell Healer Glover about what happened. It was the only way the man would be able to help him and he knew that.
For a moment, he seemed to get lost in them. Although on multiple occasions over the years the boys had been standing even closer than they were right now, Harry had never taken the opportunity to really
A half-hearted glare was sent his way as Malfoy started walking down the winding stairs. "Ha-ha. Very funny, Potter."
Teddy’s eyes widened in horror whilst Harry tried his hardest to suppress his laughter. – a tell-a-vishion, really?
have had her wand she wouldn't have stood a chance against the dark wizard in the room. Voldemort was the strongest he had ever been at the time.
Potter turned towards the window, narrowing his eyes at Draco. "Stop laughing, you git", he grumbled. "Now I have to start all over again!"
“Don’t call me that”, Draco said, rolling his eyes, though Harry could see a smile tugging at the corners of his lips. “I can’t believe this actually didn’t go the way I intended.”
Harry didn't turn around to look at what had happened to the other Seeker though. It wasn't exactly that he didn't care; he was just getting tired of having to chase after the Snitch. He wanted it to be over and done with, so he could take a well-deserved, hot shower and finally relax. And he was certain that if he looked away at that moment, the Snitch would disappear... again.
Sadness, so heavy it felt like he would suffocate, washed over Harry as he saw the true anguish and hopelessness in the depths of his mother's eyes at the thought of leaving her son so early; at orphaning their only son, their treasure.
Bloody hell, that boy did things to his heart Harry had never felt before. Not to mention the warm, fuzzy feeling that was slowly travelling southwards - or was it northwards now that he was lying upside-down?
"When is your next appointment with Healer Glover?" Astoria asked, her fingers combing soothingly through his hair.
Both Theo and Blaise - sitting on the couch next to Pansy - snickered quietly, exchanging knowing looks.
"Let him be, Ron", Hermione sighed. "Maybe you should take a leaf out of his book for a change, hm?"
From that day on, he had promised her to try and not be late again and he had yet to break that promise.
The other students of Hogwarts, however - mostly the younger years - didn't seem to have the same mindset. They would squeal or giggle whenever he looked in their direction, doing everything they could to get his attention. Some even swarmed him, asking for autographs or pictures or they kept thanking him for saving one of their relatives Harry didn't even know had fought in the war too.
"I'll go", Draco offered instead, a mischievous glint shimmering in the depths of his silver eyes. He stood up and made his way to the door.
"Hex them?" Harry asked once only the two of them remained in the corridor, his head tilted in confusion. "I thought you weren't allowed to practice offensive spells without permission..."
Harry raised an eyebrow as Ron's face reddened dangerously, his eyes narrowing and a finger pointing to the Slytherin. "Listen here you b-"
From the moment he had set foot in the castle, memories of what had happened only a few months ago plagued his mind. Images of all the people who had given their life for him flashed before his eyes, causing Harry to be in a rather black mood.
As far as anyone knew, Ron didn't have a clue his little sister was in a relationship with Luna. Though how he hadn't noticed yet, Harry didn't know. If even he - one of the most oblivious creatures to ever walk this earth - had noticed; how had Ron not...?
"Well then, Potter", Malfoy said as he walked to the door and opened it. "I'll see you around, I guess."
"Me?" he asked, disbelief audible in his wavering voice. "But I was awful a few years ago. Why would I be a good captain,
