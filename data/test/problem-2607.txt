Again Harry complied, moving as fast as he could.
Hayden told the portrait on the wall the phrase he had gotten from Sev the other day. The portrait immediately swung open, revealing a dark lit room with dark green and black furniture decorating the area.
"Open your eyes!" Pansy squealed.
“You are just like your mother” Tom smiled as he watched his son laughing and smiling for the first time since he arrived back.
"Of course" Severus said, walking over to their window and opening it. He whistled a short tune before stepping to the side to let the snowy white owl in the room.
"Eternal glory. That's what awaits the student who wins the Triwizard Tournament. But to do this, that student must survive three tasks, three extremely dangerous tasks. For this reason the ministry has seen it fit to impose a new rule. To explain all this, we have the head of the department of National Magical Cooperation, Mr. Bartemus Crouch"
Tomorrow would be his birthday, but he didn't think much of it, other than the fact that he would be turning 14. He looked at his alarm clock by his bed and saw that it was already 11:58 pm.
"Hayden Snape"
"I'll see you in a little bit." Hayden told the blonde.
Once again, Draco's letter made him smile.
Hayden couldn't believe the audacity of the man. He was actually trying to take advantage of him. Talk about giving Hufflepuff's a bad name. Thankfully he knew most of them before and knew they were some of the sweetest kids in the school.
Draco: https://i.pinimg.com/236x/f0/b3/98/f0b398be4f8a3226f473f517944bacd7.jpg
Quickly, before Draco could even process it, Hayden had backed up and retracted his wings, an intense blush covering his cheeks.
"Um, thank you. I'll look into that when I get back to Hogwarts. Excuse me" Hayden said quickly, turning around and making a beeline for his destination and out of the situation he was just in.
As the clock turned 12:00, he sang a quiet happy birthday to himself.
"I would be surprised if he doesn't respond by morning," Sev said, leaning down to ruffle his son's hair.
Trigger Warning!
"Well, I think it's time you make some new friends," Tom said looking at Hayden.
In the next room over, Severus heard Harry's scream of pain and came running into the room Harry was in. He saw the boy thrashing around in the bed and was almost thrown into a panic. He didn't know what to do, he didn't even know what was happening.
"-about to compete against 3 students! Not only vastly more emotionally mature than yourself, but who have mastered spells that you wouldn't attempt in your dizziest daydreams. Concerned?"
He had time, not much, but he had it. At the moment, he would much rather try and figure out what in the world is going on with Draco.
After making sure that Hayden was ready, Severus pushed open the door.
Lots and lots of chocolate, the strange thing was, it looked like it was muggle chocolate and not the magical chocolate treats he was used to seeing in the wizarding world.
"Come on, leave already. One at a time" the leader said, ushering them towards the door. Soon they all managed to leave. Hayden wondered how they couldn't have been caught yet, but he guesses that's why he was there.
Not even a minute later the headmasters of each school and Mr. Crouch entered the tent.
Draco smiled and leaned in to brush his lips ever so slightly against Hayden's so as not to wake him.
He laid in bed for a moment, wishing that he didn't have to get up and that he didn't have to endure this family any longer.
The girls seemed to wither and close into herself under the intensity of the glare pinned in her. Finding it in herself, she started to elaborate on her previous statement.
“Hayden, why don’t we go find somewhere
The two ended up sitting there for quite awhile before the silence was broken once more.
As Draco and Hayden were walking back to their dorm that night, Draco was thinking of possible ways of getting Hayden out of the tournament.
"What are you talking about? I would never try to-"
"Well, I suggest that you hurry and make friends with him again, half the room right now I'm sure is willing to do anything to have him smiling again" Blaise said, glaring at Draco as he left.
"Well, how was it?" Draco whispered after a while of peaceful silence.
When Harry woke up again, it was dark out.
""Oh come off it Malfoy, we're barely even in the hall" Granger pointed out.
Hayden couldn't help it. His face turned even redder as a squeak of embarrassment left his throat.
No, instead he was surprised to see Luna waiting behind him.
“A book” Hayden almost snapped impatiently. All he wanted to do was check the stupid book out so he could go back and read it in the common room while snuggled next to Draco in front of the fire.
Draco had never felt such panic as he did in this moment. He was frantically looking over all the castle and still no luck.
Hayden walked through the common room, practically ignoring the existence of everyone in the room, and went straight over to his dorm room.
He turned the knob to open the door, but had to pause at the sight he was given.
Smiling at his thoughts, he went to look at his outfit in the mirror.
Draco looked away from Hayden, trying to reassure himself that Hayden was right and he was just being overly protective. He couldn't help his Veela instincts though! He constantly wanted to protect Hayden and make sure he was safe from everything that could pose as harmful!
“It’s Defense Against the Dark Arts. Now if you’ll excuse, I need to be getting back to my dorm” Hayden growled out, glaring at the other boy.
They watched the professor as she started to call out partners, only really listening for their names.
"I may or may not know, either way, I'm not telling you anything," Sev teased, causing Hayden to pout.
“Oh” was all he said, signaling he was done talking before turning back to the teacher who was handing out different objects to each pair of partners.
Draco took a sharp breath, it tore him up inside that he made Hayden cry.
"Oh then please, enlighten me" Draco said as he crossed his arms, daring them to prove him wrong. Maybe he could trick them into giving him some sort of information regarding what Hayden had confessed to him.
He could understand though why they would forget about him. He just wasn't worth enough to friends like them. They deserved better anyway.
"I think I have a crush and I don't know how to deal with it" The younger confessed.
"-ed to enact our plan soon or else other will start to become suspicious" one of the men said,
Severus carefully walked back over to the man he loved and gave him a gentle hug. Tom latched onto Severus and cried into his shoulder, regretting all that he had done to try and get rid of what he thought was his 'enemy' for the past couple years.
"I-I" Hayden tried, but he couldn't form his thoughts coherently. He breathed heavily before trying to speak again.
"When are the others going to be done?" the other man said.
As soon as he had apperated to the Manor he took a steadying breath before walking into the Manor, purposely forgetting to knock.
Thankfully, it didn't take to long find him as he was in his study.
"I'm here" Severus assured. After Hayden had calmed down they released the hug and looked at each other.
He was pacing in his study when there was a knock at the door.
"So, you're the new student then" Malfoy said, now leaning against the door frame where Weasley and Granger once stood.
Hayden shakily tried to stand up, reaching up to hug his mate, but was abruptly pushed back down to the ground. He looked up confused, his mind still a bit foggy from his encounter with his uncle.
Hayden closed his eyes, hiding his face into his arms as if to shield himself from the man berating him. "After all this family has done for you, taken you in and gave you a bed and the clothes on your back, this is how you repay us! By stealing from my precious son!" Hayden shook from fear, tears running down his face. He knew what was coming, maybe if he stayed quiet it would end faster.
He broke out of his thoughts when he heard an explosion come from the other side of the room. He rolled his eyes when he saw Seamus Finigan and his partner covered in the fail potion they were making.
“Good night, love”
“I know that, I’ve put many people down there, I can't remember everyone's names, can I?” Tom laughed.
Dumbledore stepped away from the podium where he was speaking to make way for Mr. Crouch, who seemed as though he were afraid to be there. Hayden wondered if he suspected anything.
The next morning, the two made their way to McGonagall's class for Transfiguration.
Looking around the room for the source of the noise, he spotted a window over by the far wall. An owl stood there patiently knocking its beak against the glass as it tried not to crush the letter attached to its leg.
"Professor Snape, um, I was wondering if you knew what was going on with Hayden?"
Draco's eyes sparkled at the answer. He almost couldn't believe that he was lucky enough to have someone as special as Hayden as his mate.
Harry looked over the words on the parchment three times, making sure that what he was seeing wasn't a mistake, before putting it down.
"There is no need for you to call me sir, you may call me Sev" Severus replied, knowing he might not be comfortable with any parental terms yet. "Are you alright Harry?"
"I could show you if you wanted," he said as he brought his arm up to caress Hayden's cheek, his thumb rubbing soft circles into the underside of his jaw.
Grabbing one of the blankets on his bed, he wrapped himself up and left his room so he could find his father.
"Come in" they heard Tom call out.
He whined in inconvenience as he peeked an eye out from his blanket, just to see that the fire he lit the night before had gone out, leaving the cold of the castle to seep through the walls of the room.
They both blushed when they realized they were now holding hands. They looked into each other's wide eyes, neither knew what to do. It felt nice though, it wasn't awkward at all, in fact, there was a sense of belonging instead.
Slowly but surly.
"No, I did not, nor did I get someone else to do it for me!" Hayden said as confidently as he could with all the confusion swirling in his head.
"What are you doing up at 3 in the morning?" The blonde asked again.
"Are you ready Hayden? They will all be here in about half an hour." Severus asked the boy.
Harry collapsed on his bed in exhaustion that night, the Dursleys having worked him harder than normal.
Harry looked at his wings again, this time with eyes filled of wonder. "Do they stay out all the time? How am I going to hide them when school starts?" Harry asked.
On the other side of the room a particular red head was swooning, to the point of almost falling out of his seat.
"I'm still upset with you,... but for now, I guess I can accept it," He said with a small pout.
"Thank you, Sir" Harry whispered again, looking down. He had appreciated the thought, but he wasn't used to this. He didn't quite know what to make of the situation.
Hayden stared in confusion through a foggy haze.
This would be a good place to read when I have the chance Hayden thought to himself.
Hayden moaned into the kiss, making Draco smile into the kiss. Not a moment later though, Hayden decided to be bold and licked at Draco's lips, asking for entrance.
"Yes Sir?"
Hayden was pale, paler than he should've been, and he had tired marks under his eyes that dictated just how much sleep he was getting. His normally bright and vibrant eyes now look dull and lifeless and he looked as if he was being completely weighed down by something.
Hesitantly, Harry did so. When the blood had seeped into the parchment, words had started to form. It looked like some weird sort of birth certificate with all your information on it.
"She doesn't look too dangerous," Hayden said.
"I think that we have classes tomorrow, and that it would be hard to sneak off of campus" Hayden reasoned with a smile on his face from Draco's thoughtfulness.
Hayden started to look around the store, but found himself gravitating more towards the women's section. Severus had expected this, so he went over to Hayden and handed him a dress telling him to go try it on.
"First of all, I want to make it clear. Mr. Snape is not my son" the teacher said, gesturing to Hayden. "I'm sure that you all have it within your minds that I have a child, well you are wrong. Hayden is my nephew and nothing more. Now that that's out of the way, we will continue on to other businesses. Unlike other house heads, I will be staying here in Slytherin with you. If you ever need me, let the portrait know and you will be let in. My quarters are located on the second floor, if you have trouble finding it, ask an upperclassman and they will help. I want you all to know that even while all the other three houses put us down, we are strong and are so because we are family. That being said, I will not tolerate any mistreatment of fellow housemates. If I hear of anything of the sort, your punishment will not be pleasant" Snape said, bringing his point across with a sharp glare he leveled the students with.
"I know that you can handle yourself, but still. I can't just stand by and watch you get hurt or even die Hayden!"
Hayden hissed.
"Hayden Snape"
He got up from his bench and began wandering around Hogsmeade. After about 5 minutes, he began to rethink the letter.
"I think I found my mate"
After dinner, he and Draco had come up with the idea of just opening the egg, but they realized their mistake almost immediately and closed the egg as quickly as possible.
Harry watched Petunia walk away with her nose in the air before rushing to the kitchen to get started on breakfast.
"I-I-" Draco stuttered.
Hayden thought for a moment before responding, "I think I remember reading something about that in a book somewhere, I don't remember too much though. Why?" the boy asked.
"Hmmm" Draco hummed as he looked into Hayden's eyes.
When they had finished, Hayden had flopped down on his bed and almost immediately, he was asleep. Severus tucked him into his bed with a smile and silently left the room.
"I am going down there to make sure Hayden is as far away from this tournament as possible, I will not allow him to battle a dragon all on his own!" Draco said with conviction.
"Yes I am" Malfoy growled lowly. "You know I find myself wondering how you two can manage to get into even more trouble without your infuriating leader"
"Well, the reason for that is because Phoenixes have extremely bright magical cores, but once rejected that light will slowly start to burn out. They will grow cold and distant. As their fire dies out, so will they" Severus explained.
"What now?" Lucius groaned.
Hayden relayed almost the entire night to his mother, all except for the part where he almost kissed Draco. Severus was so happy and proud for his son!
I'm not trying to make excuses or anything, but if you guys are wondering what the hold up is, I have had a lot on plate for the past couple of weeks.
Draco turned when he heard the rapid footsteps of his mate. He held his arms out in time to be able to catch Hayden who literally jumped into his arms, wrapping his arms around the blonde's neck and his legs around his waist. Draco spun him around a bit with the moment Hayden came at him before letting the raven bring his legs back down. .
Right now, Hayden was on his way to the Malfoy Manor to conduct a meeting that his father cannot.
just like he was. But they were a rare creature, and not many of them tended to be in this part of the world.
The reception was set to be during the second week of August, only a couple weeks before school starts.
Unfortunately, luck was not with as it immediately started to pour. Hayden just stood there, wondering why all this was deciding to happen to him now. He briefly wondered what would happen if he just stayed here in the rain, would he die of hypothermia? He kinda hoped so, but then again, he still had things to do before he died.
Oh, well. He didn’t much care at the moment as he was currently plotting the deaths of those he called his peers.
“It's for one of my classes. I don’t see why you should be so interested”
He couldn't stop thinking about Draco and then the impending doom of what the next task was bound to be and how to get the clue he needs out of the egg.
Before Hermione could open her mouth, though, Hayden had turned to face the professor with the biggest smile he could.
against
"How did you get the book open?" Draco asked with astonishment.
He tried to sit up, but when he went to do so, he felt an unusual weight on his back weighing him down. He turned his head, trying to see what was on his back.
"Why not," he said, smiling at the other two men in the room.
"Are you ready to talk?" He asked. Hayden just shrugged as he looked at the ceiling.
The owl flew right over to Hayden and gave a short trill, happy to be sending a letter for him.
“I think the look in Hayden’s eyes says something very different. I think it would do you good to let go of him” Viktor responded, watching as Cedric slowly leaned back and stepped away from Hayden.
“I see that you're doing better, that's good!” The Hufflepuff started cheerfully.
Hayden watched as the gears turned in the blondes head, separately trying to figure out what was going on. Not a minute later, a look a realization flashed across his silver eyes before a look of anger hardened them.
Hayden quickly pulled his hand back, a fierce blush covering his face as he squeaked out a hello in return.
The blonde's eyes flickered down to Hayden's lips before looking back in his eyes. At the others' response, Draco leaned forward even more, closing the small gap between them to gently press his lip against the others.
Hayden looked at her weirdly for a moment before closing his eyes with a muttered "Aright".
"Yes" Hayden looked toward Severus.
Then it clicked, Severus had thought that he recognized Harry's smell for a moment, from a distant memory of a long time ago. '
Draco continues to look Hayden in the eyes for a moment before telling him to wait there for a second and that he'll be back in a minute before leaving the bed and out the door of their room.
Hayden took a breath in as he was graced with Draco's smile. He had never seen it before, it was beautiful. It was a soft smile but it showed how happy he was. An emotion Hayden had just never seen before.
Hayden took the box, and opened the lid, in it were 6 beautiful crystal roses.
"What do you mean?" Draco asked worriedly.
"Hmm, speaking of your parents, how do you think they'd feel? Proud? Or concerned that your attitude shows at best a pathological need for attention, or worse, a psychotic death wish?"
"Well, I think it's finally time I deal with Dumbledore and what happened to Harry Potter" Severus said in a bored tone.
"What?" Hayden shouted in surprise.
"I don't see why not, in fact I would love to have you here! Severus?"
Harry closed his eyes and concentrated on his wings, after a minute or two, he felt his wings disappear into his back.
"I am out here so that I don't wake a sleeping dragon" Draco half joked.
"I think I'm having a crisis" Hayden mono-toned.
A couple days later, Harry finally had woken up. He reached over to the nightstand for his glasses out of habit. Once he had put them on he looked around the unfamiliar room. He noticed that this was not his room almost immediately, it looks far too nice to be anything close to his. The walls are done in deep forest green with a desk in the far corner of the room and a couple book cases holding an array of different books. The bed he was in was a soft one, the most comfortable one he had ever been in (he thought it might even give the Hogwarts beds a run for their money!) The sheets and pillow cases were black but the comforter on top matched the walls quite nicely with deep green.
Their little moment with each other broke suddenly when Dumbledore started speaking again.
"Why?" The boy asked.
"You better have a good reason for this, Nott. Or else" Draco threatened.
"No Draco, I have to compete. I don't think there is anything to be done against it. Now, can we please stop talking about it?" Hayden replied, edging on harsh.
"Now, not that I'm not happy you're here, but aren't you supposed to be in classes?"
Unlike the last letter, Hayden knew exactly where to go for this one.
"Are you okay" an accented voice behind him asked.
“What happened? Where were you? I was so worried!” Draco rushed out.
Hayden was a little taken aback with all that Blaise just told him. He felt warm inside, that his house seemed to really like him, and not just for who his family is or for what some dumb prophecy says about him.
(See the end of the chapter for
"Um, Sir? What am I?" the boy asked.
Sorry this chapter is so late! I wanted to get it out yesterday, but my WIFI had been down for the past couple days. Thankfully it just started working and now I can post this chapter for you all!
"The Hungarian Horntail"
“Where’s the fun in that?” Hayden whispered with a devilish grin as leaned up into Draco only to bring the blond down on top of him and into a kiss.
It was the dragon.
Until then, Severus sat back down in his arm chair and picked his book back up, hoping that Hayden would feel a bit better after sleeping.
Just as he made it down the stairs, he was stopped by Severus, who seemed to be waiting for Hayden to come back down.
"Really, why?"
"I got permission to skip for about a week. Moms going to bring over my work during the weekend" Hayden explained tiredly.
"Hayden?" the older man asked.
"Hayden, can I kiss you?" Draco asked so quietly, that Hayden wouldn't have been able to hear the question if Draco wasn't as close as he was.
"Hayden, you need to take better care of yourself. Unless you've forgotten, you were out for two days" Draco gently admonished.
As Hayden entered the elaborately decorated room, he couldn't help but feel anxious as he walked down the stairs case.
Hayden weaved his way through the few tables that were in his way, making his way over to the booth in the back of the place where Blaise was.
"Father, do you kno-" Draco started before looking to see who else was in the room. He immediately froze, eyes locked on the masked person in the room.
"We told you, in a couple days. They'll let us know" the first reprimanded.
Once over his initial shock, Severus lightly returned the embrace, albeit a bit awkwardly.
"No, I don't. If you want him you can have him" Tom said, giving his son a slight smirk.
The dragon looked at him cautiously before breathing a bout of fire his way causing him to jump out of the way right in the nick of time!
"Hmm? Oh, just some Mudblood that thought they could make a difference. Disgusting" Tom answered his son.
"Are you okay?" Hayden asked, a little worried at the sound coming from the blonde. Hayden could almost feel himself shrink a bit.
Hayden thought for a moment, pondering what it would mean for his future before facing his father.
Hayden started to tear up a little. He was feeling just so happy that he was lucky enough to have someone like Draco.
Sorry for the short chapter.
The only thing that was bothering him was the fact that he couldn’t dance. He never learned how to and was a bit embarrassed because of it.
“Draco Malfoy and Neville Longbottom” she called.
“Is it time for bed already?” the blond teased, pecking the ravenette on the cheek. Hayden nodded in reply as he rested his head against Draco.
Hayden just started crying again as he felt his mother's tight embrace around him, keeping him safe. He couldn't be more grateful.
Draco took a deep breath and went back to his seat, not caring about the scene that he caused in the Slytherin bleachers.
he thought to himself.
“Who did he tell?” Hayden demanded once more.
Hayden took a moment to calm himself. A couple deep breaths later, he expressed his new revelation.
Hayden closed his wardrobe doors and flopped onto his bed, tired. It had been a long day, this was really the first time all day he had had time for himself.
"I want to know everything! Who is it? What house are they in? Are they from Hogwarts or from a visiting school? How did you two meet?" Sev asked rapidly with a giddy smile on his face.
"Are you okay? Does anything hurt?" Draco asked worriedly, grabbing his hand gently.
Hayden breathed a sigh of relief.
"After due consideration," Mr. Crouch started. "The Ministry has concluded that for their own safety, no student under the age of 17, should be allowed to put forth their name for the Triwizard Tournament. This decision is final!"
"Hayden, I love you, now and forever. I realise that this might be a little early to say, but it's true. You may or may not know this, I kinda hope you do, but, we're mates. I can't tell you how ecstatic I am that you belong to me and I belong to you" Draco reached into his pocket and took out a box. "I am giving this ring to you because I honestly can't imagine my life without you! Not only do I want to be your mate, but also your boyfriend, and someday, maybe even your husband! So, what do you say? Would you be willing to spend the rest of your life with me?"
"Did you ever feel anything for me?" Draco asked, a tiny bit of his heartbreak shining through in his words.
Hayden stood from where he was seated, bowed his head in acknowledgment of the apology and disapperated from the study.
"I'll follow you in a few minutes," Tom said before ushering Hayden through the doors.
He slipped into a calm sleep.
“How do you not know how? You were rai-”
He knocked again, but just like last time, there was no answer.
"Is anyone even still alive down here? When was the last you put someone here?" Hayden asked, noticing the almost echoing silence of the dungeon.
"Hayden!" Draco called as he rushed out of his bed to go help Hayden. Draco wrapped an arm around Hayden's waist, the other reaching out to the boy's arms which were still gripping the table like his life depended on it.
The threat didn't scare Draco at all, but he did come to see reason. Hayden may have not wanted to do this, but it is something he has to do.
After a minute of no one getting up, Theo finally stood, giving a heavy sigh, "Guess you all are wimps, huh" He muttered under breath.
“I d-don-“
All his pain and suffering was all dealt to him by the hands of his own father.
Hayden thought about it for a moment.
The Hall was silent. Everyone was confused, no one knew that Snape had any relatives. Most assumed that Hayden was most likely Snape son's which baffled everyone.
Severus smiled at him. "No, you are able to hide them. Just concentrate on them disappearing, and they will"
"Yeah, what's it to you?" Hayden asked, trying to ignore the urge to go cuddle up into the blonde.
He slowly made his way to the castle, in a way he actually enjoyed the rain. Soon enough he made it back to the castle and started to climb the stairs to the seventh level. Unfortunately he wasn't the only one.
Severus knocked on the study door as Hayden adjusted the mask over his face.
The boy smoothed some of the feathers on the bird's head before tying the letter to Hedwig's leg.
“I guess? It might just be a part of her plan to befriend me. I never told her that I was though, and I don’t think she’ll be able to figure it out either. But, I guess now that you mention it, the Gryffindor's have been a bit nicer since this semester started” Hayden responded with a tired sigh.
"Hayden, please? I need you to let me in" Draco tried again.
Hayden: https://i.pinimg.com/564x/4b/e6/b6/4be6b65d6944dcb13d978da416fe9a96.jpg
Hayden took it and placed it in his pocket. "Now close your eyes again" the Slytherin girl once again demanded.
Was it worth it to interrupt his class and let the boy suffer, or would it be in everybody's best interest to solve the problem Hayden was having.
"Do you remember us? I guess you were maybe a little young to remember" Narcissa smiled, trying to form a connection with the boy. "I remember holding you just a few days after you were born"
“What’s his name?” Hayden asked his father as they sat in front of a warming fire.
Hayden was erring on the edge of unconsciousness and couldn't quite think straight, but the dragon starting to shrink back was not something he could've missed.
Now all he had to do was wait.
[ Sorry guys, time skip. I can't figure out what to write for this part. Basically, Hayden finds Severus and he gets permission to leave Hogwarts for a week and a half, you can imagine what they tell the school, and goes to Riddle Manor.]
Within the span of two months, Hayden became Toms official successor, but no one knew other than Voldemort's inner circle and other loyal followers, thus keeping him hidden from people like the Order of the Phoenix.
Harry thought. Just as he was distributing the breakfast onto three separate plates, the Dursleys came down for breakfast.
Now he didn't feel so bad about crushing on the other boy. But wait, does that mean that Hayden was the one meeting his father that day?
Draco could swear that he recognized that cold tone from a meeting he had accidently walked in on a couple months back.
Griphook looked at Harry, then looked at Severus. After a minute the goblin agreed.
"Well, um, I found out last night, right after getting back to my dorm" Hayden started out shyly. "It's Draco" the boy smiled.
"Shirt off, now!" the whale of a man said while raising his voice again.
Severus spun around quickly when he heard a soft groan sound from one of the corners in the room. His dark eyes widened as he looked down at the sight before him.
Hayden studied Viktor for a moment before hesitantly agreeing with the thought that the only peaceful way out of this situation would be to take his hand.
“Why would I go with you?” Hayden demanded incredulously, finally coming out of his thoughts at the question directed towards him.
"You're finally here. I've been waiting here for what seems like ages!" Blaise replied dramatically. He grabbed something beside him and handed it to Hayden.
"What do you want Malfoy?" the Weasley spat out as the two Gryffindors
Every free chance he has gotten has been spent trying to find his mate, but he’s had no such luck. He couldn’t believe how ashamed he felt when he finally went back to Professor Snape's office a couple days later.
The camera flash went off as Hayden and the three other champions posed for the picture.
It was a simple red dress, but he thought it looked great on him. He popped his head out of the curtain of the dressing room.
"I will never love you. In fact, I hate you, and I always will"
After they had both calmed down, they had continued on a lighter subject.
Two sets of jem colored eyes pinned Bellatrix making her squirm a little under the gaze of Voldemort and the new person in the room.
“Just Ron, I promise. I think Viktor might’ve seen as well and Loony Lovegood” the girl explained as fast as she could.
"What's this for?" Hayden asked, taking the mask from his father.
“Why are you laughing?” Tom asked, chuckling a bit at his son’s silliness.
“Draco you can’t kill anybody”
Not even fighting the urge, Draco lifted his hand and gently ran his fingers over the soft feathers protruding from the raveonettes back.
Was that somehow too much to ask?
"How do I know when it happens?" Hayden asked, face tinged a pink from embarrassment.
"Do you know where he is then? I need to talk to him" Draco pleaded after a moment.
Draco smiled, content that he was able to make Hayden smile like that.
“I was showing Hayden something, now if y-”
He looked to Draco's side of the room to see the blonde sitting in a chair near his bed. He must've moved it from the desk.
Once the sorting was done, Dumbledore went up to the podium to give his beginning of the year speech and school rules and whatnot. Many of the Slytherins including Hayden did not pay attention.
Draco glared at them, trying to hide the emotion, but Hayden could tell that the blonde obviously didn't want the all girl school there. He wondered why.
Suddenly on guard, Hayden looked around for a hiding place before finding one behind a potted bush that his mother no doubt planted.
The staircase soon ended and opened into a small little room that only consisted of a door. Opening the heavy metal and wood door, a wide hallway stretched before the two with a couple of rooms that led to individual cells on each side of the hall.
Unfortunately, a lot of them were backless and he just wasn't comfortable with that style yet. It made him feel exposed. He didn't want to wear anything fancy or too casual. Why did this have to be so hard?
Dumbledore looked towards Mr. Crouch who was standing away from everyone else.
(See the end of the chapter for
Hayden flopped down on the sofa, happy to finally have time to himself so that he could think and maybe even take a nap with the feeling of Draco's eyes on him. Not that he minded it, though.
Tom could help but feel like somehow, his son's pain was somehow because of him. He just wished he knew how to help him. Wandlessly, he sent a warming charm onto the blanket Hayden was wrapped in.
"She may not look it, but she is. She's ruthless, just like most others from the school" Draco told him.
“Fine, lead the way” Hayden muttered as he placed his smaller palm within Viktor's bigger one. Gently, he pulled the Slytherin out of the library. The glare Viktor sent Cedric was just daring him to try and stop him.
I hope to get the next chapter out as soon as I can, but I make no promises. I am writing it, I have the beginning of the chapter done!
The doors to the Great Hall opened and at least 20 girls came striding into the room, a giant of a lady walking behind them. She was even bigger than Hagrid!
Hayden walked into the quaint little cafe noticing that there weren't all that many people there at the moment.
He had never made one before and he didn't quite know where the idea to make one came from, but it made him safe every time he laid down in it and when he lit the fire, it was like his own personal heaven. It was warm and safe and his, and he never knew just how much he needed it until he had it.
"No, I'm afraid I don't," Draco answered meekly.
"I don't know, Si- I mean- Sev".
“Yes, Draco, what did you need?” Severus asked, barely even looking up from the abysmal essay he was grading.
It was definitely a nice little study. He bet that if he asked his father he could have it, that would have to wait though.
"Uh, yeah. You said that everybody saw them?"
All these thoughts and more were going through his head as he looked all around the room before noticing the note that sat on Draco's pillow.
A couple hours later Hayden finally left his room, but since the Room created the door on a different wall, he missed the blonde that was sitting on the floor asleep, waiting for his once love.
“What book is it?”
Just as he started a new paragraph, he felt a raindrop fall onto the back of his neck. He looked up at the sky, trying to gauge whether or not it would actually rain, he was answered when he felt another drop fall onto his cheek.
Hayden stormed into the common room, obviously in a fowl mood.
he thought as he walked out of the store, bag in hand.
Hayden couldn't help but laugh at his father. He might not have been trying to at that moment, but his father somehow had a way of lifting his spirits. Kind of ironic since it wasn’t really that long ago when his father was trying to crush his spirits.
Hayden just giggled silently to himself. He was not expecting them to act like this, he kinda enjoyed it.
A cage caught his eyes as he looked at the window. It looked like an owl cage, and were those owl treats? Whose room was this?
Harry couldn't have rushed down the stairs fast enough. As soon as he reached Petunia, he stood quietly in front her, eyes steadily trained on the floor beneath him as he waited.
The Hall burst into excited applause.
"The Chinese Fireball" He moved on to Cedric, breaking Hayden out of his panicked thoughts.
"Why do I bother?" Severus sighed, pinched the bridge of his nose as he prepared to tell Draco something he should already know.
"Come with me," Tom said and led him to the doors of his study. "Are you ready to come in?"
More and more Draco knew that Hayden was telling him the truth and Draco had grossly over reacted.
Harry tried to get up, he couldn't at first, but he tried again and he slightly managed to crawl back into the kitchen.
"How did Draco get you to skip classes today?" Hayden questioned as began to eat.
Hayden's heart broke. The only family he had, never wanted him? They meant to just leave him? Tom ripped his hand away from Hayden and stood up pointing his wand toward the boy sitting on the floor, shaking with tears.
A picture of Hayden's promise ring that Draco gave him!
The streets had begun to get busier as time passed, looking around, Hayden saw a Slytherin go into a store near where he was standing.
"Only if you're ready" Severus explained.
"What are you smirking at?" Hayden asked, guessing the reason as to why.
"Thank you, Pansy. I think I can manage though!" He said with a smile.
"Wasn't he the one you've been crushing on and the reason you were having a 'crisis' on my couch?" Sev asked as he smirked. A blush covered the poor boy's face as he stared down at the floor in embarrassment and nodded.
Hayden rolled his eyes before leaning against the wall again, fully intent on ignoring the other.
Hayden woke up the next morning feeling, strangely, well rested and relaxed. He had a faint memory of the nightmare he had last night, from what he remembered, it wasn't pleasant. So, why does he feel so safe?
Hayden breathed a sigh of relief when he saw his mother grading papers in the empty classroom.
Under all this anger though, was sadness.
Hayden pouted not wanting to stop, Draco only smiled though, loving the adorable look on his mates face.
Hayden shook himself out of his trance. He needed to get ready for the day.
“Granger here was just filling me in on everything I’ve missed. Apparently I can be second in the last task for the tournament. She was just telling me how much she and the other missed having me around” Hayden finished with a happy tone.
Hayden was a little nervous to see his father, especially since they have been trying to kill each for the past three or so years. Hopefully they can put all that in the past and focus on the future and, hopefully, being a family.
"Get up boy!" Vernon shouted, Harry fearfully and cautiously stood up, keeping his eyes pointed to the floor.
"I think... It's a very well written letter"
"Do you have any plans for him, other than just letting him rot of course?" The ravenette asked, looking back at his father.
He looked down at himself not noticing a thing, he grew slightly worried because of the mysterious force not letting him up.
Hey everyone, sorry for the wait! Thank you everyone for your wonderful feedback, it helped a lot!
"Um, excuse me" Hayden started before being interrupted.
Hayden sat next to Draco, he began to feel nervous, like something was about to happen, but he had no idea what!
"What are you doing back out here? He kicked you out or something?" Blaise said once Draco reentered the large room.
Hayden was confused, was that directed at him? It certainly seemed like it!
"Hayden? Can we-" but before Draco could finish, the Phoenix had turned around and was walking the opposite direction, heading to their next class before lunch was over.
After a week had passed, it was finally time to see who the 'lucky' students to be entered into the Tournament would be.
With that thought he flooed to Riddle Manor.
“I'm just trying to be friendly. I might be able to help you out with the class too!” Cedric insisted with a smile that showed no ounce of happiness in it.
“Because we were discu-“
"Mhh Hmm," Draco hummed. "You made the dragon submit to you with them. To be honest, it was really rather amazing"
"Um, could I ask you a question?" Draco asked.
Tom was a bit upset with that answer. "Why not? Did they do something to you?"
“I don’t need any of your help. I am completely capable of doing my coursework on my own” Hayden sneered, growing more and more frustrated by the second.
"When am I not!" Hayden responded with a grin of excitement.
“I was wondering if, um- maybe if you had the time, could you possibly teach me how to dance?” Hayden mumbled, face flushing red with embarrassment that he had to ask.
So this chapter has some non-con. It mainly just forced kissing but there's a bit of unwanted touching as well, so if that bothers you or makes you uncomfortable you skim or skip entirely up until the last couple paragraphs of this chapter.
Severus expected to apperate outside the front door of the house but was a bit surprised to find himself in someone's room.
What happened?
Hayden pushed the feeling to the side, wanting to focus on the new day instead of his emotionally confusing night.
"Okay, so...what?" Hayden asked, still confused about the concept.
"No I haven't yet" He responded in a defensive tone.
It was from the Malfoys, inviting him and his family to a ball that was taking place that weekend.
Soon enough, it was time for Hayden to go out to the arena. As soon as he walked through the curtains he could hear the crowd of students chanting his name.
Hayden nodded for a moment, taking it in the new information before realizing something.
He did get his time card though. He would look over it tonight. He didn't have classes until tomorrow, so he was good until then.
Of course when that was said, pretty much the entirety of the Gryffindor table and a few Ravenclaws started to protest the new rule.
Draco thought to himself.
He was positive that if he asked, either Draco or his mother- perhaps even both- would be perfectly happy to help him learn, but that didn’t mean it was any easier to ask.
"It's over on the desk," Draco said, pointing over to the desk.
"And who is the lucky soul?"
Harry held out his hand as Hedwig dropped something in his palm. Taking his hand back, Harry saw that Hedwig had brought him a pretty little green hued rock.
"Thank you, are they still in father's study then?"
"Can I ask a question now?" Hayden asked when he calmed down, subtly scooting closer to the blonde. Draco nodded.
Hayden mused.
"Every year around this time we hold a reception of sorts for the recently inducted members of our cause. I would like you to attend this year" Tom told a surprised Hayden.
Little by little Hayden was able to breathe a bit calmer. Suddenly something touched. He flinched backwards, noticing that the closet he braced himself against was no longer there.
At this point Hayden was sobbing, he flinched as he heard the belt come undone. He tried to contain a yelp of pain as the belt made contact with his skin.
"We'll talk about that after your mating with Draco, if you mate with him. It's your choice if you want to pursue a relationship with him. Remember that, don't feel pressured by anyone, alright?"
"Malfoy" Hayden sighed out. The reality of it crashing down on him. Why me?
"Alright, thank you Draco" Hayden said as he walked out. He's never felt happier than he did in that moment!
Hayden thought, tired of thinking.
"Champions, in a circle around me" Barty directed moving Fleur on his left, Viktor next to her, Cedrick between Viktor and Hayden, who was on Barty's right.
"Mum, could I talk with you?" Hayden asked, closing the heavy door behind him.
Draco was not amused.
"I think you're right," Hayden smiled.
Feedback of any kind would be greatly appreciated! Thank you!
"And?" Hayden's muffled voice urged. Draco sighed but relented anyway.
"Draco, nothing will happen. Now go back to the dorm" Hayden sated firmly.
"If you want, you can wear your mask," Sev said, gesturing to the mask laying on Haydens hip. "No one would it against you"
"I'm so sorry, my child! I'll make sure you are never put in harm's way again! Can you ever forgive me Hayden?" By this time, Tom had tears flowing down his cheeks and pretty soon Hayden had a couple tears as well.
So this specific story is coming to end soon! There's probably only going to be a couple chapters left although I don't know the exact number. I have been toying with the idea of making this a series but I don't know what the next storyline would be yet. Anyway, let me know your thoughts!
"Draco?" Hayden brokenly whispered, eyes trained at the ground at his feet.
"Come here, Draco! Thank you!" Hayden said before hugging Draco as hard as he could with only one arm.
Hayden complied to Draco's wishes by opening his mouth, welcoming Draco to slip his tongue into his mouth.
Hayden woke up the next morning shivering, cold and miserable. No matter how far he burrowed under the blankets in his nest, he couldn't escape the chill that was settling into his bones.
"Of course I'm sure! Do you think I'm not aware of my own actions?" Hayden snapped.
“I’m just happy,” Hayden smiled. “Those are three very different names, you know”
"Wait, why?" Hayden asked, confusion etching over his features.
"Yes, I'm going to be a fourth year" Hayden replied, not sounding too enthusiastic about it.
"What did you expect out of a rejection? You know, if you were rejected, you would've died within 36 hours, Hayden has a month. Now tell me which is worse, dying in 3 days, or having it being spread out throughout a month?" Severus asked
Hayden stood staring at the door she went through absolutely shocked. After a couple of moments he smiled as he came back to himself..
"Are you sure you don't want me or my father to go to the Ministry to force them into letting you out of the tournament?" Draco asked, almost pleading with the other to let him do this.
Giving the ravenette one more kiss on his head, he walked back to his own side of the room, willing his wings away at the same time.
"No, I would never, please-"
He reached over for the note, unfolded it and began to read:
"Oh nothing, it's just a little hard to imagine the hard and emotionally stunted Draco Malfoy to be soft and doting much less loving" Hayden teased with a smirk.
"Excellent we now have our three Champions, but in the end, only one will go down in history. Only one will host this Chalice of Champions, this Vessel of Victory, The Triwizard Cup!"
"Draco, I love you too! There's nothing I would love more than to say yes you, but I... I have something to tell you that will most definitely change the way you look at me" Hayden admitted, tears welling in his eyes.
"Draco?" Hayden asked, confused on why they were stopping when they were both obviously enjoying it!
As soon as he got to the egg he picked it up and turned back to the dragon, who looked guilty.
"How are you adjusting to being a new person? I'm sure it is difficult."
"Are you ready to go down?" his father asked while holding out his arm. Hayden smiled and took his father's arm as they went out of the room and down the stairs that led to the ballroom.
"Oh, uh, yeah. I guess, since you confided in me, the least I can do is return the favor" Draco said as he shifted on the bed.
Draco groaned at the feeling, but kept his mouth closed, smiling when he heard Hayden whine in disappointment. Draco finally gave in though when he felt one of Hayden's hands comb through his hair.
Hayden was surprised at how comfortable the mask on his face was. Once he walked into the study, he saw all of Voldemort's inner circle of Deatheaters, and strangely, he didn't feel like he should be fighting for his life. He felt powerful.
Hayden smiled, Draco really spared no expense when it came to giving him gifts.
"Well, I do, but I'm not sure I would consider them friends anymore"
He hadn't told his parents what had happened at the Malfoy Manor. He hadn't told anyone in fact, he only told Hedwig, who had blessedly followed him from the Durselys.
"Do we have anyone in the dungeons?" Hayden smirked.
"Yes you did" Severus answered, letting him go and helping him to sit up.
"Draco you cannot go down there," Blaise said, getting up to block Draco's way.
Not long after Hayden came back to Slytherin did a disgruntled blonde walk through the door to the common room.
Tom froze for a moment, trying to decide if what the man before him was telling the truth or not.
He took a deep breath to try and calm himself before opening the door, hoping that the other boy was in the common room, but the raven had no such luck.
"Alright" Hayden said, a little excitement showing in his voice.
(See the end of the chapter for
“If you would like, I would be honored to escort you back to your common room. At least there you might be free from idiots such as this” Viktor responded, sneering at the Hufflepuff and effectively cutting off the angered sixth year while extending out a hand to Hayden at the same time.
"Well what are we supposed to do now?" The first man asked.
"He rejected me," Hayden deadpanned.
"But I want to," the blonde interrupted. "I want to, I want you to know that I'm like you. I have creature blood as well"
Once Hayden was done he walked over to the outfit that Draco had left out for him.
"Who's he?" Hayden asked.
"Sure" his mother responded, making his way from his arm chair after putting down the book he had started reading.
Draco startled at the sound, seemingly to only now notice the heterochromatic boy.
Draco had almost caught up to him, his hand just barely brushing against the other robes. Right as he closed his hand, the ravenette turned and his hand grasped at empty air.
"Professor-" Harry began but was cut off when Snape shushed him. Harry looked at him with a confused expression.
"Are you ready to go?" Severus asked.
"I kinda did forget, though" the raven muttered as the blonde sat him down on his bed. "Anyway, in response to your question earlier, yeah, I do have creature blood"
"Hayden? Will you let me in?" Draco tried calmly.
As if reading each others minds, they both unfurl their wings at once. Silver and gold feathers met as their wings curled slightly inward.
"Clean up the dining room table! After that here is your list of chores for today." Petunia ordered him, dropping the list before she even finished her sentence.
Hayden looked up from his book, looked at Draco for a moment, and then nodded.
What he found there shocked him.
"Thank you so much" Hayden whispered once they broke away.
Draco hurried out of the common room and up to where his and Hayden's dorm was, hoping that he didn't put any locking charms up.
"Does he know I'm his father?" Tom hesitantly asked.
When Draco turned back around to unpack more from his truck, Hayden noticed that his shirt was unbuttoned, showing off his pale, but toned upper body.
"W-what! H-how..." Hayden stuttered, completely baffled at how Luna could've known he was once Harry Potter. How could she have known, he hadn't even told Draco yet! No one else knew, right?
“I-I” before the Gryffindor could give him a proper answer, they were interrupted by some else interjecting.
He couldn't help but enjoy the looks Malfoy gave him, strangely enough. Shockingly, he didn't see an ounce of malice in his silver gaze.
Harry scrambled to get up from off his bed and stood in front of his uncle, head down with an attempt to make himself seem as small as possible.
He opened his eyes again and saw that his wings weren't there anymore. He turned around to look at his back and saw a shimmering gold tattoo in the shape of his wings spreading down the length of his back. He looked back at the man standing beside him and smiled up at him.
"What if they decide they don't like me?" He said, just about ready to give up. Severus walked into the room and sat down on Hayden's bed, gesturing for Hayden to sit next to him.
An idea struck him just as the beast raised its tail to strike at him.
When Draco did turn back though, he couldn't help but gasp in shock and surprise.
Like instinct, Hayden brought up a hand lightly running his knuckles across the impossibly soft feathers. Draco's inner Veela purred at the attention of his mate. Hayden smiled.
"I want to do everything I can to help you make the world a better place for the wizarding society and to make sure that it can become great again, like it once was. I want to follow in your footsteps. Before I found you again, I was constantly confused and never really knew what I stood for or what I thought in regards to the world, but now I know how twisted it is. I know that it needs to be fixed and that you can fix it. I want to help" Hayden finished, conviction and determination in his voice.
Hayden walked back to his room a little while later after just visiting with his mum. When he got back to his dorm, quietly as to not wake the blonde, he saw his owl sitting on his desk.
"Why do you not want to disturb him? Afraid he'll blow up in your face!" Blaise teased.
"Hayden, I couldn't have asked for a better successor and son. I know you will do great things, with or without me and I am honored that you would rather be with me. Thank you" Tom said as he hugged Hayden tighter, tears falling from both of their eyes.
"Hayden, I am so happy for you!" Sev said as he hugged his son, After a moment, though, he let go and began to speak again.
"I did?" Hayden couldn't remember much of the end of the task. Now he wishes he did though as he watched Draco nod his head.
"Of course he wants to meet you!" Hayden thought for a moment before making his decision.
"Are you sure? Where is he?" Tom said, jumping up from where he was seated and running to the other man.
Theo started to panic when he saw tears well up in the other boys eyes, he didn't know what to do to comfort him though!
He took a step backwards, and fell into darkness.
"Excuse me, who do you think you are? What gives you the right to say that? Just because you are a journalist doesn't give you the privilege to cross lines like that! Like I told you, I did not enter, I do not who put my name in or why it was spit out! Also, shouldn't your quill only be writing down words verbally and not making up senseless drabble?" Hayden spoke up, getting annoyed.
"Hayden? Honey, can I come in?" Draco sighed when he didn't get an answer. Assuming that Hayden was just sleeping, he carefully opened the door.
"Who do you think you are, you blonde bimbo?" Granger sneered.
"And what brings you here so early in the morning?" Severus questioned. Draco shifted uncomfortably in his spot at the tone in his teacher's tone.
“I know but that doesn’t mean you should! If you go and do something rash then someone is bound to find you have creature blood and by relation, that I have it as well! I cannot have the entire school knowing that we are creatures! It’s bad enough that Granger and Krum know, it would be disastrous if anyone else knew” Hayden explained, muttering at the end as he sat on their bed.
"Hayden, I'm sorry if I ever made you feel like this. If I had known who you were, I would've never touched a hair on your head. I love you and I always will" Tom whispered to the boy in his arms, tearing up with the many emotions.
"Where are you taking me? You know I can't stand being left in the dark, what's going on?" Draco demanded.
Eventually, Hayden and Draco were able to get back to their dorm. The entire time, Draco had been talking rather animatedly about the dance. That it would be the first one he’ll go to without his parents and how excited he is about all that!
"Well, your wings came out at the end of the task and I'm pretty sure I'm not the only one who saw. So, i'm going to go out on a limb here and guess you have creature blood?" Draco inquired, to which Hayden only stared back in shock.
“We have a class with the Gryffindor's again tomorrow, right? I guess we'll see if Granger and the rest keeps up this act, then” Hayden said, finishing the conversation as he wrapped his arms more firmly around the body on his chest.
He groaned, with all that has been going on he hasn't had the time to think of how he was going to deal with the whole Harry Potter situation with old Dumbles.
It was easier said than done. Somehow, everywhere Hayden went it seemed the Draco was always there before him!
"I know you're awake. Come on out, I promise I won't hurt you. You'll be alright." Harry heard the oddly familiar voice say. He could've sworn it was Professor Snape, but that was impossible, he hated him! Harry felt the bed dip down as the person sat beside him. "It's alright, I won't hurt you" the person reiterated as they began to pull back blankets so Harry could see him. Harry was so confused at that moment, it was Professor Snape! But, why?
All-in-all, it wasn't that bad, mundane stuff if Hayden was being honest. It was rather boring, but was necessary.
"Don't call me that" he gritted out, startling the other two in the cab.
"If you don't mind, where is here?" Harry whispered.
Tom looked sadly at his son. He reached over and he wrapped Hayden in his arms and hugged him tight. At first Hayden was shocked and flinched back a little at the contact, but then hugged his father back with full force.
Viktor followed Hayden down to the dungeons and to the portrait leading to his common room. The ravenette briefly entertained the idea of confronting the other about him seeing his wings, but eventually decided against. He was exhausted and just didn't want to deal with it at the moment. He would have to talk with him later.
He let himself think about the month he had been at the manor. He had definitely been happier than he had been in the last couple years. Sadly, he hasn't had much time to really connect with him like he did with Sev. In a way he missed his father, even though he didn't really know him outside of being Lord Voldemort.
Severus quietly giggled to himself.
"Hayden, I wasn't expecting to see you so soon," Tom said as he greeted his son with a hug.
"No, why should I be concerned? As far I know, I have far more experience than the three out there" He mumbled, watching the quill.
"Mr. Snape, could you come with me please?" She said as if there was no other choice but to follow her.
Hayden and Draco hoped that McGonagall would have mercy on them and put them together, but it wasn’t a very likely wish.
Hayden stared at the two for a second, wondering if he should be civil or if he should just ignore the two. What harm is there in introducing himself.
As discreetly as possible, Hayden opened the door to a study room attached to the main room. It was a good sized room with a desk and a couple bookshelves, a window sat in between the two selves with a comfy looking window seat below the glass.
Draco leaned his forehead against Hayden's, both looking into each others eyes.
Hayden finally woke up almost three hours later on Severus couch. It took a minute for him to remember where he was and why he was there, but as soon as he did, he wished he could forget again.
"I'm here" Sev responded from his place in the arm chair. He placed his book down to turn his attention to his son on the couch.
Hayden reasoned with himself that it was definitely a clothing store, so now he just needed to find one.
Draco smiled, kneeling before Hayden.
Harry ran back up the stairs and into his room. The Dursley were back any minute now from their vacation and Harry didn't dare show his face. He didn't want to ruin their good mood with his freakish face.
"What do you mean 'What do
For some reason, McGonagall seemed to buy the phony explanation, but he could still see the sliver of suspicion and doubt in her eye.
He chuckled to himself before turning back to his own cauldron, startling when he saw the color
Would Hayden even survive that long?
Draco took a look at himself in the mirror, fixing his shirt and making sure his hair was perfect.
Hayden woke feeling warm and safe. He opened his eyes slowly, thankful for the dim light. The first thing he saw when waking up was the color green. He looked around and soon deducted that he was in his room in Slytherin.
Draco had obviously started to change his clothes but never seemed to finish. He stood at the wardrobe in a pair of black pressed slacks -part of the school uniform- and a white button up, the rest of the school uniform laid spread out against his bed.
Harry had several broken ribs, a dislocated shoulder, his leg was cracked in two different places, he had been malnourished and had cuts and bruises all over his skin.
"I'm joking, but it is a serious matter that requires attention sooner rather than later," Sev said, chuckling at Hayden's reaction.
“If you ever need help again, please do not hesitate to find me. Good night” he finished as he gently kissed the top of Hayden’s hand before leaving.
Tom was shocked. His son was Harry Potter? The same boy he had been trying to kill for years?
Harry ate a little bit of the food that was brought to him, but couldn't eat much. When he was full he set the tray on the nightstand and laid back down onto the bed. He was sure that Professor Snape wouldn't mind if he took another nap.
While still standing near the entrance, Hayden scanned the small area for Draco. Looking for a head of blonde hair to help in his small search, but he didn't find one.
"Yes, want me to walk you there?" Severus suggested.
-------
While Harry was watching the words form on the paper, Severus didn't dare look at the document for fear of disappointment in what he might see.
"You look so much like your father," Severus said softly.
"You're right, there," Blaise laughed.
Hayden took a step forward, the students around him parting a path for him. Draco watched as he continued his walk, wishing desperately that he could follow.
Tom couldn't be more happy to allow him the rest he so obviously needed.
He listened carefully. When he heard it again he recognized it to be Potters' voice.
"A mate, in short, is someone who will love you unconditionally through thick and thin, no matter what"
For some reason, getting up from his bed was easier than his struggles that morning.
"I would like to make an announcement now that everything has been arranged" Dumbledore began. The Great Hall broke out in murmurs, everyone guessing that the announcement had something to do with the one Dumbledore gave that morning.
"Of course! I can't let you have all the fun" Draco teased.
The next morning, Hayden went down to breakfast and was greeted by his mother.
After getting dressed, Draco went over to Hayden's side of the room and opened his closet looking to see what exactly he had.
"Dad?" Hayden asked.
He checked the door handle, but he couldn't open it,
Draco scowled as Hayden left their room. Whoever just ruined his moment with his mate was going to pay, and he had a feeling it was Blaise.
Upon entering the store, he noticed that it was a jewelry store. Exactly the place he thought he wasn't supposed to go to!
Hayden made his way over to where Theo was all the way at the back of the store.
It would be a long day.
As Hayden was about to enter the Great Hall, he was stopped by Professor McGonagall.
The two followed Griphook into a back room where they were seated down at the desk. Griphook took out a piece of parchment and laid it in front of Harry. He handed a needle to Harry and asked him to drop three drops of blood onto the center of the parchment.
"Wait, you got to hold him? How come you never let me hold me?" Bellatrix pouted as she crossed her arms.
Of course, Draco already knew this, but he felt better knowing this secret was shared willingly.
He didn’t really say much, just that the dance was nothing new and that the dress should be formal and elegant. The last thing he said before leaving was that a week from today, after classes, the Slytherin House is to meet in the practice room closest to the dorm so that they can learn the specific dance they will be doing to start out the ball.
“Now, now. It's so hard to be attentive when you're so determined to be a brat” Cedric chastised, keeping his fingers against Hayden's lips as he leaned a bit closer.
Happy Holidays everyone!
"The Durmstrang Champion is, Viktor Krum!" The rest of the hall applauded, Draco seemed pleased at this.
"Okay, open your eyes"
Grabbing her throat, she looked to Weasley with panic racing through her eyes. Weasley didn't look any better with the horrified expression on his face.
"Now, Miss Delacour, if you will" Opening up the bag for her to choose whatever was inside it.
"A Veela, huh. How amusing!" Hayden giggled.
Getting out of bed, he gently kissed the boy's forehead before starting his morning routine, all while trying not to wake him.
He laid down the length of the seat, his back up against the wall of the coach, and fell into a light doze. Unfortunately his peace seemed to only last for a couple minutes as he could soon hear voices outside of his compartment.
The dragon's tail seems to come out of nowhere and nails Hayden, sending him flying back into a nearby rock.
“Why wasn’t I told of this?” Draco snapped out of his ever growing annoyance.
Hayden could help the smile that spread across his face as he sighed into the others lips, finally able to relax from the day's events.
During dinner, the small family discussed what the upcoming year of Hogwarts would look like for Hayden.
(See the end of the chapter for
Severus would've loved the possibility of finding him, but couldn't bear it if it turned out the boy in front of him wasn't who Severus was thinking he might be.
His pale skin seemed to have grown even paler, almost ashen gray. His once vibrant jewel toned eyes were dull and faded. There was just nothing there. It almost scared Draco just how emotionless Hayden looked.
Please don't hesitate to tell me if you want to see something specific or I've unknowingly forgotten something you want to finished! I love having feedback!
He looked back towards the potions professor who was behind him and gave a small smile, receiving one in return, before looking back at himself in the mirror.
"They have an unbreakable charm on them, so don't panic too much if something happens to cause them to fall" He reassured, giving Hayden a smile.
I'm so sorry for not getting a chapter out recently, unfortunately its going to be a little while longer before I can update again. Just to clarify, this book is
"Of course" the blonde replied as he stood to take one of the fluffy white towels off the shelf they resided on. Unfolding it, Draco held it out open for Hayden, looking away when the raven stood out of the water filled bathtub.
Once he was done he scurried back into the kitchen to dispose of the broken glass and to wait until breakfast was over.
Hayden thought, groaning out loud as he started to slide down the wall to the floor.
Draco chuckled quietly to himself as he watched his mate nuzzle himself into his chest. Draco couldn't help the warm feeling in his chest as he wrapped an arm around Hayden’s waist to pull him even closer.
“No need to get upset, I was just trying to be thoughtful. What class is it for?” the older boy insisted with determination.
"I want it to be your first mission as the enforcer of our cause. Recently I have been given information that we somewhere in our ranks is a rat" Tom explained.
He lied there, not having the energy to try and get up. He turned his head in the direction of the window to look at the owl on the other side, who had thankfully stopped its knocking and was now watching him with the same patience it had before.
When Hayden woke up he did quite recognize where he was or how he had gotten there, but at the same time he couldn't really find it in himself to panic or even care that he didn't remember at the moment.
Hayden hugged him back just as tightly.
"You should keep your little boy toy on a shor-" Granger started but was immediately cut off.
The train suddenly jerked forward, signaling the start of the journey to Hogwarts.
"Do you know what you did to him?" Severus asked, curious if Draco even knew the consequences of his actions.
Hayden had ended up moving to Severus's couch in his room, wanting to be close to his family.
"Cruicio"
"Sorry" Draco said quietly, eyes still trained on the Bulgarian.
One question, when events come up in the future like the Yule Ball and other celebrations where Hayden and Draco dress up, do you all like when I post pictures of the outfits, or would you all rather prefer links instead?
"Hello, Harry" She said in her light and airy tone of voice.
Hayden thought to himself, struggling to prepare himself for this unexpected turn of events.
He wondered. He tried to get up again, being more careful now that he apparently had wings on his back. Once he was successfully able to sit up, he quickly looked around and saw Severus Snape sitting in a chair by the bed in the darkly lit room.
Hayden was soon on the path that led to Hogsmead. Logically, there weren't many other students out considering classes would be starting in a couple minutes, so Hayden was pretty much by himself on the path along with maybe a handful of other people that were either well ahead of him, or just getting on the path.
Vernon came at him, dragging him up to Harry's room. Once there, Vernon threw Harry up against the wall and started to repeatedly hit and kick him, all while yelling at him, calling him names like, freak, worthless, mistake, and many more things to bring down Harry's self worth.
"Oh yeah, Bellatrix, Narcissa, and Lucius" Hayden remembered. "Wait, I am meeting them now?" He panicked.
Hayden meandered down the hall, looking at the nameplates and seeing who was bunking with who.
Sorry for the shorter chapter, I've been unexpectedly busy the past couple of days.
Thank you!
"Look at what you did! You ruined our meal!" Vernon shouted, Harry flinched.
Pretty much all of the students in Slytherin knew how to dance, mainly because of their high standing families, but Hayden had been raised by Muggles practically his whole life, and coupled with the fact that he was previously in Gryffindor, he never had the opportunity to try and figure it out.
"Oh, I almost forgot, here" Pansy handed another letter.
His wings were out? He didn't even realize, but he guessed it did make sense considering when he woke up a couple hours ago they were hanging off the bed.
"What" Hayden asked breathless
"Goodnight Hayden"
Draco couldn't help but coo at the sight. Draco walked over to the sleeping boy, making sure that his steps were quiet.
"Agh" the blonde grunted as he stumbled forward, listening as a door slammed closed, presumably right behind Hayden.
He had never been so grateful for those classes Madame Pomphrey had made all the teachers attend at the beginning of every year.
"Goodnight Draco"
Finally, Hayden stood up. He stood for a moment, intently staring into the old man's eyes to intimidate him. He succeeded if the waiver in his eyes was anything to go by.
Tom gave him a very confused look. He would think that he would know whether or not he did in fact know his son. He urged Severus to go on but was not expecting to hear what Sev said next.
"So tell me, Hayden" She starts as they sit, "Here you sit, a mere boy of 12-"
Harry picked up the document and started to read the information on it:
“What do you think we should do about your little discipline problem, hmm?” Cedric whispered into his ear before starting to lean down even farther, all while Hayden reached further into his sleeve where his wand was hidden. Just before Cedric could get to his neck, though, they were thankfully interrupted.
"Nothing too bad, just something that affects your future" Sev teased as he closed the door.
Now Hayden was extra nervous, these dragons were known for being especially ornery.
"Sleep well, love" Draco whispered before getting up and silently leaving the room to go back to the common room.
"Oh stop it! I know what you're trying to do, you're trying to swade me into a false sense of security, but guess what, I could never feel safe with you! You're a pathetic, self-obsessed little coward. How dare you try to tell me that you can protect me and bud into my personal life. I never asked for your help and I never will. So stop. Go away. Leave me alone. I never want to see your perfect face until you can figure out how to apologize for being a snobby prat." Hayden cried, tears streaming from his bi-colored eyes.
"I know, but I would feel better if I was in there with you. That way I can make sure that she isn't going to make up bad things about you" Draco said.
"Wait, I wouldn't be meeting Draco would I?"
In the end, Draco had to help Hayden into his pajamas before burying him underneath the blankets on the bed.
"Albus, there has to be something we can do! We can't possibly let him in the tournament!" McGonagall implored.
"Can you take this to the Headmasters office for me?"
Of course, Cedric wouldn’t dare.
"Harry is not our leader you git, he's our best friend!" Granger all but shouted.
Draco could feel the moment that Hayden relaxed in his hold, he could hear when the ravens' uneven breaths slowed.
He was surprised at how comfortable the outfit was. The green somehow complimenting his two toned eyes.
“What do you have there?” Cedric asked when he noticed Hayden was not paying attention to him. So, of course, the upperclassman decided it would be a good idea to step right into the Slytherins personal space.
Hayden, again, looked over to the blonde, noticing how tense the other was. Without thinking, Hayden gently ran his hand down the blondes and slipped his hand into the others, who relaxed almost immediately at the warm touch.
"Speak up Hayden, there's no need to mumbled"
A couple days later found Hayden pacing nervously in the Champions tent waiting for the first task to start.
"Alright, Hayden, I'm coming in"
“What are you-” Hayden exclaimed before he was cut off by the feeling of Cedric’s index finger coming to rest on his lips, stopping him from protesting.
"Hello?" Hayden called. Hearing no response, he decided that there were no students in the room.
"Where is the egg then? I haven't seen it?"
"Would you reject receiving a hint?" Viktor said.
you have done to that poor boy?" Severus asked, honestly rather astounded that his godson could be oblivious.
"Alright" Hayden sighed, his exhaustion finally starting to creep up on him. "Could you hand me a towel, please?"
He leaned against the wall, waiting for the doors to be opened, he briefly wondered what would happen if he was sorted into Gryffindor again.
"Hello, Theo. I understand you have something for me" Hayden said playfully upon approaching him.
"Hayden! You're awake!" Draco cried, rushing out of his seat to kneel beside Hayden's bed.
"You don't mind if I use a quick-quotes-quill do you?"
"Are you okay?" a voice asked, shaking Draco from his thoughts. He hadn't realized he had been starting.
"You passed out right after you had gotten the egg," Draco replied.
I will be deleting this A/N a couple days before I post the next chapter, so there's something to look for!
"I am sure you are all wondering why I called you all here today" Voldemort began, "Many years ago I had a child who was taken from me. A-"
As Griphook watched he couldn't help but feel a little emotional that a family had been brought back together again.
“Well, we were all just so worried about you. You missed the last couple weeks of school before winter break and nobody had known where you were or what exactly had happened” Hermione explained matter of factly.
Hayden broke, tears finally streamed down his face as a sob broke past his throat.
"The Welsh Green" Barty announced moving on the Viktor.
"I had some questions, Professor Snape. I was hoping that you might be able to answer them for me?" Draco asked.
Nope.
It took him a couple minutes to take the wards down but was soon done and was able to open the door.
Hayden apperated straight to his bedroom in the Riddle Manor. Taking off his mask, he couldn't help but notice the warmth in his cheeks.
"Alright, go ahead" Hayden relinquished.
Hayden screamed in pain, both physical and emotional. Hayden tried looking to his mate and his mother for help, but they were just standing there, laughing.
“You know, you could’ve asked me to get on the bed instead of pushing me down” Draco smirked as he positioned himself so he was leaning up on his forearm.
Thank you all so much for your patience and kind comments! I hope it is worth the wait for all you!
When there was no answer, Hayden opened his eyes to see why.
Once dinner was done and dessert had been served, all the students were sent to their respective house dorms, the first years being led by the prefects of each house.
Draco sat there blankly for a minute, processing his teachings words, before slowly getting up and shuffling back out of his office.
"I think I just met my mate"
After kicking him once more, Vernon shouted at him to clean up the mess he had made.
"So, what now?" Hayden asked Severus.
A knocking shocked him out of his tired reverie, but only for a moment before exhaustion weighed back over him.
Draco thought, making sure he did not voice it out loud.
Hayden uncurled himself and tried to crawl away from the danger he thought was there, but when he looked up, relief washed over him. It was his mate, he didn't know how but he knew it was him. Behind him were his parents.
“I was at the library, you knew that. Unfortunately, I ran into a bit of trouble. Nothing that wasn’t easily taken care of though” Hayden answered as he hugged Draco back just as tightly.
He shakily stood up, the dragon stared, almost seeming worried.
HAYDEN was Draco's mate.
This wasn't turning out at all like he had hoped. He just wished that what Draco said was true.
Severus just wanted to leave and keep Hayden to himself if this was how Tom was going to act, but he was trying to think of his son and put him first. He knew that Hayden would want to at least meet his dad.
"I'd rather not," Blaise responded. "Are you not going to go to class?"
Hayden jumped away a moment too late and his arm got mildly burned.
"Hayden, I promise you, no matter what you say, nothing will change. I love you and that will never change" Draco tried to convince as he stood up before the raven.
Something was wrong.
"No buts Draco. We just had fought about this subject. I'll be fine, I've dealt with the press before. I know what to do!" Hayden spat, a little fed up with Draco.
She led him to a small room in the back of the store where a desk and chair sat with various jewels strewn about the table and a mirror in front. Pansy sat him down in front of the mirror and stood behind him.
His facial features had softened slightly as well, his bone structure no longer as angular and sharp. His waist had slimmed and his bone structure looks smaller than it was when yesterday giving him a more fragile and slightly feminine stature. He actually kinda liked how he looked. He thought it fit him more and felt more comfortable with the look.
"Ha ha" Sev sassed. "I'm sure, you might want to know what happens after you mate with Draco?"
What was he supposed to do now? He didn’t even know where Hayden was in the first place and now he had to wait a whole week and half just to be able to set things straight?
Upon walking into his dorm room, he was immediately wrapped in a pair of arms that only could’ve belonged to his mate.
When Draco finally entered the common room, he was met with the glares of the few Slytherins who were in the room and not in their dorms. One of them being Blaise, who walked right up to him.
"Get started with breakfast and then get your chores done" Petunia said, looking down at the boy in front of her as she put her hands on her hips. "I expect you to be done by lunch."
Finally they arrived at Hogsmead.
"The Champion for Beauxbatons, is Fleur Delacroix"
Tom had never been prouder of anyone in his life.The man stood up from the chair and made his way to where his son was seated on the bed and pulled him in for a hug.
"I am sure they will love you. And if they have any problems at all with you, they will have to answer to me and your father!" Hayden gave a small smile at that.
"Sure, if he's your 'best friend' then where is he? Are you two suddenly too good for him?" Draco joked with an irritable undertone.
"Alright" the raven said, the soft smile never leaving his face as Draco carefully began to lean over the edge of the tub.
Hayden gave him his hand, intending for it to be a handshake, but was stunned when the other brought his hand up to his mouth, kissing his knuckles.
The pain stopped and his mare walked up to him, crouching down in order to meet his eyes. "I can't believe that i'm tied to a worthless little mess up like you. Your a pawn, a fool, and that's all you'll ever be. You should've known that nobody can ever love you, much less stand to be in your presence"
"Well, fancy meeting you again"
"Draco Malfoy"
"GET UP BOY!" Harry's Uncle Vernon yelled. The poor wizard could tell already that Vernon was in a very bad mood.
Hayden just nodded with a relieved smile gracing his features.
Thank you for hopefully understanding, I will see you all soon!
(See the end of the chapter for
As a result of these feelings, Draco's potion was beginning to suffer. The potion was supposed to be turning a deep cobalt blue, but was instead varying on the side of lavender, and Draco had yet to really notice.
"Oh, h-hi Luna" Hayden greeted nervously. Honestly, he felt a little bad. He had seen Luna around the halls and in a few of his classes, but he hadn't made the attempt to talk to her at all yet this year.
Most of the students milled about the common room before heading to their respective dorms. Hayden walked down the stairs that led to the fourth year dorms which were located below the common space.
"Draco" Lucius growled at the still kneeling Draco. "Just what were you thinking? I told you he would be here today and to not disturb us"
Trying to push down his disappointment, he then tried to see if anyone in the cafe was a familiar face. Luckily he wasn't the only Slytherin there.
Once he had calmed down, Severus had continued to keep a hold of the man in his arms, and Tom was grateful for it.
Hayden was a bit shocked he hadn't recognized Pansy and even more so when she practically dragged him away from the small crowd in the store.
Once the meeting had ended, about an hour and a half later, a knock sounded on the study door. Before Hayden even had the chance to stand, the door opened and Draco Malfoy walked in, completely oblivious to what was happening.
He hadn't been walking long before he heard someone running to catch up to him.
Hayden quickly walked over and took the letter from her and gave her a treat as a thank you.
Hayden guessed that might be another reason as to why the Hall was as quiet as it was, seeing as how Professor Snape had rarely ever shown any expression the last years he was at the school.
"We're going to the dorms, your roommate needs you or else he might explode, literally" Blaise said, remembering the feel of Hayden's magic when he stormed into the room.
Before he knew it, Draco had stood up and was offering his hand to him. Hayden bit back a smile of his own as he took the blonde's hand. Draco gently pulled him to his feet before leading them both to the Great Hall.
Once everyone was seated with their partners for the day, McGonagall started giving out instructions on what they were to be doing.
"Don't boss us around Malfoy, you little weasel" the red haired baited.
"Is there anything else I need to know before I go back to my dorm and crash? I feel like I haven slept in three days, despite my 2 day coma" the raven jokes.
"Fine" Hayden grumbled, standing as well.
After rushing through the portrait door, and ignoring the few still in the common room, he ran upstairs to find the door locked, again.
