After a long time, Draco breathed out exhausted and looked at Potter to find him quickly looking back down at his book and blushing. Draco smiled.
"I don't think you should go on your own," Granger said, "Harry might not want to talk to you, who knows."
"No, mother, be quiet. I love him. And he loves me. I guess...", Draco looked at Potter, who nodded smiling.
"I better get back down before my friends worry about me," Harry said, trying to escape the silence.
Now, he lay there, almost crying because Potter wad right. Draco's friends weren't better than Potter's friends. They were just the same.
"Mister Draco!", another elf said happily and jumped in the chair next to Draco. He laughed as the elf nearly rolled down again.
Was Potter looking for him? Did he care? Of course not, after what Draco had said. But he was just so hurt. Draco knew that Potter and Weaselette had been together and that he had been happy back then- apart from the war of course.
Days passed and their visit to Hogwarts (or the start of Hermione's term) crept closer. Harry still hadn't heard from Malfoy but he wasn't very surprised about it, hewouldn't be surprised if he would never hear from him again. With every day closer to Semptember the first, the books in Hermione's room piled up more and more. In the last week of August, Ginny had decided to come and visit them because Tonks' mother Andromeda had dropped off Teddy Lupin. Harry had been honored to be Teddy's godfather and he was very keen on making Remus and Tonks proud. So Hermione and Ron were in the kitchen making dinner while Harry and Ginny sat on the living room carpet and played with Teddy.
"And you're sure it's not too much trouble taking care of him and preparing everything for your party?" Harry asked Nott when he got ready to leave that day.
"The blonde one?" Harry asked and as Malfoy nodded he said, "Yeah, I didn't care much for her but Seamus seemed to be ordering a lot of drinks."
Harry and Malfoy shared a look, both wanting Harry to go home. Malfoy wanted him to go home. Harry knew it. They were making their way through the atrium of the Ministry of Magic and Narcissa led the trio to the fireplaces.
"We have to do this more often as long as the weather is this good." Ron shouted from his room over the hall to Harry's room, where he stood and pulled out fresh clothes.
"Shut it.", Malfoy said, "We're going to our room, you're going back out and leave me alone. We will not talk about anything. Just because we share a room it doesn't mean, we become friends, alright? So, let's go."
"I'm not going to discuss my morning routine with you. Now get out, I have to get dressed," Malfoy said annoyed.
"I'm... I'm sorry.", Draco said and tears streamed down his cheeks. He closed the door behind himself with a lout
He turned around and looked at Malfoy, who stared at him. He had used Legilimens to talk to Harry through his thoughts.
And with that, Malfoy left and vanished through the door into the house. Harry could hear the front door being shut just before he too got up and ran after Malfoy. But Harry didn't have to run that far. Malfoy sat on their doorstep with his broom and shoes in his hands. Harry sat down next to him and took the broom out of his hand.
At night, Harry woke up from a dream he couldn't remember and shivered. He looked around his room, which was lit by the low moonlight coming through the window. Bond was sleeping in his cage and Harry sighed. Sometimes the feeling of missing Hedwig came over him and then he was reminded of missing everyone else. Harry felt a lump in his throat and rolled his eyes annoyed. He didn't want to cry, it seemed so ridiculous to sit alone in the dark and cry.
"No, you twat. I just want to check if you're alright.", Potter answered and rolled his eyes, looking down quickly, but Draco didn't miss his cheeks blushing hardly.
These words hurt Draco. He wasn't Potter's first one like Potter was his. Draco wanted to be something special to Potter and not just someone else.
Harry felt sick today. He slumbed out of the bathroom. Malfoy sat on his bed and stared out of the window.
Draco opened the door and stepped into the room. He put his broom next to Theo's and his shoes on the mat, then walked into the living room. Draco rolled his eyes when he found Pansy sitting on the couch biting her nails, while Theo stood in the open kitchen waving his wand while cooking.
"It's called yoga, idiot.", Potter answered and stood up. He rolled up his mat and shoved it under his bed.
"Anyways", said Hermione quickly before an arguement broke out, "I think you should just try and be nice to her. After all, she let you go in the forbidden forest, didn't she?"
"No, I do not," Draco insisted, but his heart started beating very quickly. He felt his cheeks blushing. Why was he always blushing?
He picked up a paper, not in an envelope, and gave it to Neville. He and Ron slid closer together and read the letter.
"A phone." Potter repeated, "It's a Muggle device to call people. Hermione just called me. She is saying something into her phone and seconds later it comes out of the speaker of my phone. Same thing the other way around when I speak."
Even in class, he couldn't resist looking at the blond git. In potions, their eyes met and Malfoy scowled at him. Harry rolled his eyes and looked back at his potion, that was boiling now.
Harry turned the pages until he came to the last one where he himself had glued in the letter that Sirius had wrote him after his escape from Hogwarts. Harry wiped away the single tear rolling down his face and closed the album.
Draco put his arms around Potter's torso and pulled him close. Draco liked him. He couldn't explain why, but he really did.
"I really like you, Harry, and if you like him, I can try to understand.", Ron said smiling. Harry smiled too.
was allowed to hurt Harry in any way, and what Malfoy did was the least of the least. It was just disgusting and disrespectful and-
Theo didn't answer. He grabbed a book and sat down on the small balcony. Draco followed him, hoping he would say something.
There was one empty bottle of fire whiskey laying in Malfoy's bed, another one was shattered into pieces on the floor. Neville noticed a blood stain on the wall. He slowly shook his head, closed the door again and walked two doors further until he reached his own room.
It would have been logical to push Potter away and demand an explanation, but Potter's tongue traced Draco's lips, begging for entrance, and Draco couldn't deny the request.
Everything was so heavy right now. He needed to talk to someone. Maybe he wanted to talk not to someone, but to one specific person... That was completely ridiculous.
They sat down on the floor opposite of each other and looked at each other. The moonlight perched thorough the curtains and lighted up the room a bit. Harry could see the surfaces of Malfoy's pointy face and he could see that Malfoy looked stern.
"You were rude earlier today. This rude.", Potter grinned as his hands slid lower, fingers grazing the skin between Draco's arse cheeks.
Satisfied with his letter, Harry folded it and put it in an envelope. Dressed in his pyjama and letter in his hand, Harry knocked at the door to Malfoy's room and asked if he can come in. After a second, Malfoy answered and Harry opened the door. He froze. Malfoy wore a black silk pyjama with silver seams, that looked really expensive. Harry looked down on himself, wearing a pyjama Mrs Weasley had made for him.
"Draco was so happy he could finally go to Hogwarts. And he was even more excited to meet you.", Narcissa said and looked at Harry, smiling.
"I think we should start with my phone, maybe I have sent some messages or something.", Harry suggested and stood up.
Draco quietened and turned around, closed his lips with Harry's and smiled. Harry smiled too and got pressed against the wall. They stood under the wather and kissed.
Harry hurried outside again and before he could shout for anyone, music filled his ears. He looked around hastily, but couldn't see anyone. What was going on now? Harry heard someone singing. His heart took a jump when Ron and Hermione stepped out from behind a tent into the light of the bonfire. Hermione held Teddy in her arm.
But Harry didn't want to say his thoughts out loud, so he only furrowed his brow. "I don't know, Hermione. Why do you ask?"
"No one is going to get naked in our dorm!", Ron shouted after them, but Harry had no intention of doing so.
"You are the man of my dreams!", Harry whispered and kissed Draco. Draco smiled and rubbed his nose against Harry's.
He was so angry right now. What right did this woman have to speak like that about Potter's family? What was wrong with these people?
Pansy laughed her evil and dirty laugh, that was so Slytherin it was almost like Draco's, but of course Draco didn't laugh very often.
Malfoy led Harry into a dimly lit cloakroom with a few red lamps. Harry had barely closed the door before Draco had pulled out his wand of the walking stick, put a silencing charm on the door and pinned Harry against the wall. Harry gasped and melted into the kiss. Malfoy was so fierce and intense. He bit Harry's lower lip, what made him moan. Before Harry knew what was happening, Malfoy sank to his knees and pulled of Harry's newly-bought trousers in one motion. Harry gasped and moaned and banged his head against the door. He got week in his knees and felt like the room was spinning.
Harry lay awake half of the night, unsure whether to go or not. This could probably be a trick. Or not. Malfoy didn't say no yet. Maybe he would actually say
Potter didn't answer that question, he stood up and walked around his stool, his hand gliding softly over the dark brown wood. Potter glanced at Draco and for a second, Potter gave him an encouraging smile.
Draco sighed and stuffed the letter into his bedside table to all the other letters he got drom his mom and his friends.
"So she hated me as well. Dumbledore left a letter for my aunt and my uncle in which he explained the situation and in which he said that they should tell me the truth before the day I turn eleven. They didn't. They told me my parents died in a car crash and they told me nothing about me being a wizard. My uncle hated me more than everything on this world and my cousin bullied me until I was fifteen. I had to live inside the cupboard for eleven years, until one day thousands of owls arrived. Each of them carried a letter from Hogwarts, but my uncle forbade me to read these letters. On my eleventh birthday, Hagrid broke into our hut and told me everything about my parents, my past and myself. I left with him and hated the family I had to live with even more."
The death of Draco's father had been the hardest on Narcissa. Since then she'd never left the house, she only spoke to a few people and whenever Draco came over she seemed less and less happy. Today was such a day. Theo and Pansy have agreed to join Draco for a visit.
, so they filled him in. Draco was so ashamed when he heard what he had done - cried on Longbottom's neck, threw up on Weasley's socks, pulled off his shirt in front of them and told them how much he loved Potter and how much he missed him.
"Every bad thing they did to each other only shows how strong their love for each other was and is, if they can stand here today on their wedding, holding hands and being happy." Theo said with a wide smile.
Draco's parents said goodbye to his friends and together, they stepped outside. Narcissa and Lucius waved after them for a while, then closed the door and Draco, Potter, Theo, Blaise, Pansy and Greg walked down towards the iron gate.
Harry decided to give the two of them their needed privacy and he left. When Harry opened the door to his own dormitory, the light was off and Malfoy wasn't there, but on his bed lay his pyjama and light came beneath the bathroom door. Harry heard the shower running and walked closer to the door. He heard Malfoy singing. Harry had never realized how beautiful Malfoy's voice was - perhaps because Harry had never heard Malfoy sing. But he sang beautifully, Harry couldn't move. He stood there, his ear almost touching the door and listened to the blonde asshole singing.
He asked Hermione to sit down and stop being so worried. She tried her best. Harry sat there for two minutes when Neville asked him if they could talk. Privately. Harry nodded and he felt excitement spreading through his body again. Finally he could tell someone.
"We could go somewhere and drink something," Malfoy suggested. Harry was surprised Malfoy wanted to keep doing something with Harry.
"You have to talk to him. Yes. You have to talk. And ask him," Neville thought out loud, "Or maybe wait until he talks to you."
"Okay, alright.", he told himself and felt Ron's comforting hand on his shoulder and Harry felt immediately stronger.
" Draco looked at Harry with so much love in his steel grey eyes. They walked back to Ron and Hermione when the song ended. Hermione smiled when she saw them holding hands and they both rolled their eyes. Many people stared, but Harry couldn't care less.
Harry took a shower when he got home and so did Ron. Harry didn't know if he could leave Malfoy alone with Hermione, but he encouraged him to go. Harry stood under the hot water stream and closed his eyes. He loved Christmas. Malfoy and Hermione stopped talking when Harry came into the living room. He furrowed his brow. Why was everyone acting so weird lately? He went back to his room without saying a word and stumbled across Ron, who rubbed his wet hair with a towel.
They separated from each other and breathed heavily. Draco's eyes hushed over the dark haired boy. He was beautiful. And Draco could feel that something was different. Very different. Potter smiled.
After they finished eating, Draco knew exactly what was coming. He had to introduce his boyfriend properly. He took a deep breath as they walked into the living room. Potter was standing by Draco's side and smiled uncomfortable at the people Draco knew he had hated for so long.
"It may be quite simple, but now that it's done..." Fleur's and Bill's beutiful voices echoed through the night.
They all sat down on the long black wooden table, Lucius on the head of the desk, Harry next to Draco.
"Because he would've been happy there! And we wanted to have a normal life, that's why we didn't tell him about his parents or the wizard-thing. We wanted to have a normal life! Is that too much to be asked for?", Petunia answered.
It was really nice seeing everyone again and talking to them. And what Harry appreciated very much was that the band wasn't too loud so you could understand every word your opponent was saying.
Parkinson narrowed her eyes and grunted. She walked outside again, slamming the door behind herself.
They finished eating and then spread into their dorms. To Draco's surprise he found that a lot of Potter's stuff was already gone. His trunk was gone, his bed was neatly made and his closet was half empty. His toothbrush and other products in the bathroom were gone. Draco sighed, then started to pack his own stuff. He opened his trunk and pulled out a lot of clothes from his closet. Draco grabbed his toothbrush and other stuff and put them in a kit, which he put in the trunk.
They finished their breakfast and left the kitchens. On the way to the library, where both of them wanted to study and revise, Weasley and Granger crossed their paths.
"Sounds like your years at school. Things happened that never happened before since you were there.", Draco said to Potter and laughed.
"He really is scrawny," Ron said, "Also, if he wants to fight Harry, he would have to fight us as well."
Harry had lost so much during the war, but rebuilding Hogwarts and returning there made him feel much better. He had been glad to see McGonnagal's smile as he told her he was going to help building it up again. And he had been even happier when he received her letter after he had given that interview for the Daily Prophet where he told that he was going back to Hogwarts. His teacher and now new headmistress had been so happy to hear the good news, but Harry knew she was a bit disappointed he didn't tell her, but she had to find out over the Prophet. He didn't want to tell too much people about his plans concerning his school. He had only told Hermione and the whole Weasley family, but he couldn't keep it a secret anymore when the interviewer had asked.
"Look," Harry continued, trying to make it better, "I don't want to sound cruel, but I know this seems like a hopeless situation. You have to always remember there are people in your life that will always be there for you. Neville had no one but his grandmother until he came here, now he has a giant family who supports him. Just like myself."
"I was thinking about tomorrow." He lied quickly and suddenly he was really worried. "What do you think they are going to do with the rooms? And the houses? I mean most of the Slytherins don't come back." He asked Pansy.
"This isn't an excuse and isn't supposed to be one. This is an argument against the wrong accusation in the case of Lucius Malfoy." Potter turned to look at every member of the Wizengamot.
He decided that he had been in the library for long enough and that Potter's annoying friends wouldn't be there anymore, so he went back to their room. But as he opened the door-
? Was it one? His eyes wandered to Malfoy. He still hasn't said anything, he just let them insult him and did nothing. Harry was surprised.
"So, first, because you're the only person I'm going to spend my holidays with and not to forget that I only stay here because you do-",
It wasn't that bad at Grimmauld Place, because Potter had been there, but now, Draco was alone again and it reminded him of the times the Dark Lord had been at the Manor.
Harry nodded grinning and Draco rolled his eyes, but grinned as well. Harry lay back down next to him and nuzzled at Malfoy's neck, what made Malfoy moan a little. They didn't do anything else, though, for Malfoy had to rest. Harry's heart felt like it was going to jump out when Malfoy rested his head on Harry's chest. Harry traced his fingers through the soft silver hair and smiled. This was it. This was all he wanted.
No one talked until they had finished eating and Hermione told Harry he should lie down and get some sleep. Harry figured he could at least give it a try, stripped down to his boxers and curled up beneath the blanket in his bed. The room was chilly and the air felt clean inside Harry's lungs. He closed his eyes and his breath slowed down.
"Boring. I've learnt much more when Snape was teaching the subject.", Draco answered. Potter's brow furrowed.
Malfoy nodded and Harry put down bag and cage. Malfoy closed the door to his small library and sat down on his bed. "I just- you know, I wanted to say thanks." He stammered.
Neville clapped his own in front of his mouth. Malfoy's knuckled were swollen and blue. What has he done? He really seemed frustrated about Harry leaving. Right before Neville's eyes, Malfoy stumbled and fell to his knees.
He really had no idea what had been going on in his brain, but he knew now, that he wanted to be with Draco, not Ginny.
Harry and Ron watched her vanish in the crowd and they decided to look for something fun. When they found a hilarious deck of cards, a boy stepped between them, his face so close to Harry that Harry had to take a step back.
"Coming," Draco said, shoved his letter and wand in his pocket, grabbed the trunk and the box and left the room.
Everyone stared at him, then at Harry, then back at Malfoy. "What in heaven's name is going on?" Ron asked.
Harry nodded and didn't even bother to argue. Malfoy should get home to his friends and Harry should have a talk with Ron. Malfoy nodded too, like he wanted to convince himself. He then put on his shoes and Harry wordlessly handed him his broom. Malfoy forced a smile.
"Ugh, get lost." Draco said annoyed when someone pushed him and he sspilled a but of lemonade over his shirt.
It was an out-of-breath kiss. They kissed fast and hard and Harry pressed himself against Malfoy's cool body and ran his fingers through Malfoy's still wet hair. When Malfoy's tongue slipped into Harry's mouth, he gasped and felt something in his pants move. Harry pulled out his wand and without turning away from the kiss, he locked the door.
Potter's movements slowed, his hips imitating the unhurried, sensual licks of his tongue. It was both frustrating and perfect and Draco had no urge to complain. His balls ached, his cock pulsed against Potter's, and Draco closed his eyes, concentrating on the feel of Potter's cock and his tongue.
Harry's breath caught in his throat as he stepped into Draco's room. He had thought the room at Nott's apartment was impressive, but this one... Harry looked around curiously. The room was twice as big as Harry's, so were the bed and the closet. All of the furniture, like the one in London, was made out of dark black wood and beautiful figures were carved into it. Of course, there was a Slytherin banner hanging on the wall and Harry smiled. He himself had a Gryffindor banner in his room. Malfoy just stood there and watched Harry looking around his room with wide eyes. Harry was even more impressed when his eyes fell on a small marble mantelpiece.
He started eating his bread, but it didn't taste as good as it did without a unconscious boyfriend next to him and this horrible smell in his nose.
As they stood in Purge & Dowse Ltd., the entrance to the hospital disguised as a department store, that Harry had been in not long before to visit the injured from the war, Malfoy walked towards the door.
He followed Potter back down to the living room, where he sat down on the couch. Potter offered Draco something to drink, but Draco insisted on getting it himself.
Draco smiled and kissed Potter on the forehead. He mumbled something sleepy. Draco laughed and cupped Potter's face with his hands.
They left the store, Malfoy carrying a whole bag filled with sweets. He had bought the two lollipops and Drooble's best blowing gum, lots and lots of chocolate frogs - Harry had never expected Malfoy to be a fan of them - a glass of ice mice and licorice wands. They weren't talking when they walked down the street. They weren't talking until Malfoy had found a bench away from all the houses and people.
Harry watched him while he scrubbed his back with the soap. Draco smiled into the mirror as he saw Harry watching him and Harry looked away quickly. Draco laughed.
Harry cupped Malfoy's face with his hands and wiped away the tears with his thumb. Malfoy didn't say a word and he didn't put Harry's hands away. He just sat there and looked at Harry, tears streaming down his face.
. Stunning." Potter said and put on a charming smile that made Draco's heart flutter and his knees weak.
Harry laughed and they walked forwards, the chattering crowd letting them through. No one really realised that Harry and Draco were walking together, everyone was deep in conversation or concentrated on their own outfit. McGonnagal told the four champions to wait on one side of the doors while everyone else went inside. Hermione hasn't spotted Harry yet. She was blushing and talking to Krum. Fleur and Roger Davies, who was her partner, stationed themselves nearest the doors. Cedric and Cho were close to Harry, too. Harry looked away from them, so he wouldn't have to talk to them.
As he lay in bed and pulled his blanket to his chin, he heard knocking on his window. Harry sat up and put his glasses back on to find Malfoy's eagle owl sitting outside on the windowsill, a letter in its beak. Harry got up and opened the window, his heart pounding. The scary-looking bird hopped inside. Harry shivered from the cold coming through the window and closed it again as soon as the owl sat on the armrest of his chair. Harry stroked its head and flunked himself onto his bed, ripping the letter open with as much excitement as available in his tired state of mind.
Draco's eyes got wet again. He held his head under the stream of water and took a deep breath. He relaxed his body and leaned against the cold stone wall.
Harry had tried to calm him down for almost ten minutes now, but he wouldn't listen. "Ron, do you really believe what
The others all sat up and looked at him. Harry felt bad for Malfoy that he didn't even know the big things that have happened in this family, but how could he? No one ever talked about it. Harry sighed and took Draco's hand.
"Yes. Your parents must have told you so much about the evil Slytherins that tried to kill every muggleborn and helped to destroy the school we are heading to in a battle where they had killed hundreds of people." Draco said and was pleased with himself because he portrayed it really good.
Draco was afraid they would hex him and this time no one would come to rescue him because Potter was the only one who cared about him and right now he didn't care. Draco kept his gaze at the floor and avoided eye contact with the other students.
Theo and Pansy looked at him wordlessly, their jaws dropped and their eyes widened. They couldn't believe what they had heard, even though they probably should have expected it.
That was the end of the conversation. Draco checked the clock nervously and was pacing up and down the living room. He decided to take a shower, before he was going to go mad. Stepping into the shower, everything he could think about was Potter. Potter and his emerald eyes that made Draco feel warm and happy. Potter and his sixpack and back muscles that shouldn't even be there considering how scrawny he had been back at Hogwarts. Potter and his stupid messy hair that used to annoy Draco, but now he loved it. Potter was perfect to him.
Malfoy took Harry's hand and rocked on his heel to the rhythm of the song. Harry watched him with a smile. This beautiful man, his pale skin and hair shining in the winter sun, snow falling down on his face. Malfoy's eyes were still closed and his cheeks and nose were flushed by the cold. He licked his pale lips when a snowflake landed there. Harry could watch him all day.
of Malfoy and got a hard-on. That was really unbelievable. Wouldn't Malfoy be such a prick, Harry would maybe understand it, but Malfoy is...
Hermione just threw him a meaningful look, Harry rolled his eyes and both of them sat down and pretended their talk had never happened. Wordlessly, they started eating and everything that was heard was silent chewing and the sound of fork meeting plate.
And when Potter took another step closer to Draco, Draco didn't back away. He stood right where he were. And then Draco understood what Potter wanted. He didn't want to be mean. So Draco opened his mouth a bit. And when Potter got even closer, fire in his eyes, Draco opened widely. Potter slowly opened his own mouth as well, coming incredibly close to Draco's. Then Potter stuck his tongue into Draco's mouth, their lips touched and fireworks inside Draco exploded.
Harry grinned and pulled a small piece of paper out of his jeans and typed in the number. Malfoy looked at him questioning.
Just as the two of them wanted to sit down on the couch, an owl soared in through the kitchen window and dropped an envelope in front of Malfoy's feet, gracefully turned around in one movement and swooped out through the same window. Malfoy and Harry both looked at the parchment envelope on the floor, before Malfoy slowly bent down to pick it up. Harry watched Malfoy curiously as he opened the envelope and read the letter. Malfoy didn't say a word, but Harry could see that something wasn't right.
A picture of the three was beneath the article and Draco pinched the bridge of his nose with his thumb and index finger. This was a disaster. He hoped his parents weren't going to read the paper this day. He hoped the mail would've gotten lost or they would've gotten blind or anything that made them
But it was Malfoy that came through the living room door. He looked at Harry and crossed his arms in front of his chest. Harry picked up Teddy.
Draco lit a cigarette and nodded. He was really going to do it. He held the cigarette with one hand and bit from his bread with the other hand.
"What's wrong?", he asked sternly after he banged open the door and stamped towards Draco. Draco blinked at him innocently.
Malfoy nodded understanding and looked into the cauldron. The potion had a yellow-orange colour and smelled like old shoes. Draco grimaced and Harry laughed.
Harry laughed, pressed a kiss to Draco's lips and grabbed his ass for a short moment. He was quite satisfied with himself, as this movement made Draco groan. Harry grinned.
Weasley crossed his arms in front of his chest. "I'm worried you're going to act out, get aggressive, lose your nerve. We all know it happened."
The following seconds felt like an eternity. Draco watched Potter fall to the ground in slow-motion.
"Shut up!", Harry said and glared at the idiots. Draco only looked at his hands and didn't say anything.
Ron didn't answer, he stared straight ahead. And before anyone could hold him back, Dean launched himself onto Malfoy.
Harry opened his eyes and breathed heavily. His heart was hammering against his ribs. Draco lay next to Harry, their fingers entwined. Draco moaned silently and looked at Harry, sleepy.
"Well, I expected to see you in the hospital this morning.", he answered shrugging. Hermione froze and looked at him with an apologising look.
Malfoy finished his cigarette, exhaled smoke one last time, stepped on the cigarette butt and then turned so he looked directly at Harry. Harry looked at his grey eyes that glistened in the moonlight, and his breath fastened. He didn't know that look in Malfoy's eyes. Harry didn't know whether to back off or not, so his complete body froze as a defense mechanism.
"I'm going to take Cedric's advise and go to the prefect's bathroom.", he answered, unsure what he was going to do there.
Harry thought. The common room was empty and Harry assumed that everyone else was in the Great Hall or outside while the weather was still dry. Suddenly, Harry and Neville heard a loud noise. Seconds later Ron stormed into the common room and let himself fall down on the couch between his friends. Harry looked at him. He had seen Ron like this only once before - when they had been in the forest and Ron had thought Harry and Hermione had a thing for each other.
Until finally Draco decided to leave. He finished his second glass of whisky, put it on the bar and pushed himself through the crowd. Disgusting. Everyone was dancing like they weren't even in his way. And they smelled so bad, Draco hoped he didn't adapt their stench.
Harry nodded. "Well, imagine what they would have written if I'd have told Romilda what Malfoy and I really did."
Miss Williams chuckled and wished Harry a good day. He smiled and continued shopping, checking everything from Hermione's list first and then started his own. He crossed paths with a few more people he knew fleetingly, exchanged nods and smiled and held small-talk with some of them.
He rolled over several times, trying to find the perfect position. It was cold in the room and Harry needed the warmth of Draco next to him.
That question seemed to have hit not only Draco's nerve, but also Potter's. Before Draco could snap something, Potter answered rudely, "He is here to help me, just like everyone else here. Do you have a problem with that?"
Draco spotted Blaise and his new friends sitting at the Ravenclaw table and felt sudden anger rushing up inside him, but he decided to take a deep breath and walked over to them.
The three nodded and Fred left to help whomever just called. Harry turned to Hermione and Ron and found that they looked just as concerned as he felt.
After a while of asking and annoying Draco and guessing what could be wrong, he finally told them. They were eating dinner when Draco summoned the letter from his room.
Now Draco could only wait until Pansy decided she was ready to ruin his evening and go out into the flaming heat and wander around the alley.
Potter smiled and Draco kissed him very hard. So hard they both fell backwards on the old bed. Now Draco was lying on top of the scarred idiot. He really was an idiot, messing with Draco like this. But Draco couldn't concern himself with that right now. His whole body was tingling and his heart jumped up and down, pounding in the same rhythm as Draco and Potter were grinding against each other. Draco felt as though he didn't get enough air in his lungs. Everything was so exciting.
Draco nodded and Harry gave her a meaningful look. McGonnagal cleared her throat and continued. They did so, and everyone in the Great Hall applauded as they entered, Fleur and Roger first, then Krum and Hermione, Cedric and Cho were the third and Harry and Draco were fourth and last. As soon as they entered, everyone started whispering hectically and Harry's eyes fell on Ron. His jaw dropped. Yeah, Harry had a
"Why not? I don't want that this stupid bitch is stealing the man of my dreams, for God's sake!", Draco answered annoyed.
Draco also had to admit it was very clever of Potter to go and talk to the minister himself, because the minister owed him a lot more than any other person - he owed Potter his life. Yes, Harry Potter was a little hero. Draco rolled his eyes.
Harry and Draco wished him a good night and went into Harry's room. They stood frozen-still two feet apart from each other and looked uncomfortable. Harry wanted to take a shower as well and he was sure that Malfoy wanted the same.
"I'm sorry.", he said. Harry smiled too. Was he allowed to kiss Draco again? Before Harry had the chance to make the right decision, Draco already stood up and walked back to his own bed.
"I still think you're a prick, but I guess I can forget about that for a while." Ron grinned, "But I will remember when you screw any of us over."
Draco's throat dried and he was just about to suggest they should work on covering Potter's whole body with hickeys right now.
Malfoy crawled on the floor over to his bedside table. He looked so vulnerable and lost. Neville knew he had said he would punch Malfoy in the face, but seeing him like this... it just wasn't right. No one should be seen like this. So Neville got down on his knees as well and sat next to Malfoy. Then Neville turned around and waved Ron over to them. Ron sighed and then did the same thing.
"Nothi-", he said, but the moment Draco looked at him, his grey eyes reflecting the moonlight, Harry couldn't hold it back anymore.
Malfoy thanked Harry under his breath and closed the door. Harry waited in front of the door to the staircase. Fully dressed, Malfoy came back out a few minutes later, bewitched his wet clothes to fold up into a tiny ball and grabbed it.
Sitting down on the sofa, Harry told Luna and Ron what had been going on at St. Mungo's and why he was back home for now.
"Not that I know of, and Hermione hadn't said anything either. We all took turns in watching you in case you woke up," Ron said, what disappointed Harry a bit.
He heard someone clear their throat and Harry looked up. Ron stood in the door and looked at the two of them. Harry waved him over without Hermione noticing Ron sneaked to the couch. He took Harry's place on the couch and Hermione looked up. She looked at Ron with big, wet eyes.
Harry nodded, kicked off the ground and flew behind his group of friends. Even though Harry didn't wear his jacket the wind in his hair was warm and soothing. The sun was slowly setting and the sky took a light shade of pink. Harry smiled happily.
"We'll stay the night at home, Teddy has to sleep in his crib." Harry said unsure, "And my back hurts from these horrible chairs."
. That was hard to progress. This thing had been something very special to Draco but to Potter it was just another blowjob. Draco stood up and made his way to the door.
Several hours later, late in the night, Nott and Zabini decided to go home to sleep and would bring over some of Draco's clothes in the morning. Harry didn't want to leave, he would stay until he was allowed to go inside and see Draco. He fell asleep in the uncomfortable chair before he knew it.
"I said shut it, Malfoy!" Potter said with a loud voice and pulled out his wand. Draco took a step back. "I dare you to ruin another year for me! Hogwarts is the only thing I have left and I bloody dare you!" Potter said.
Then, he felt a hand on his shoulder and looked up. "Are you alright?", Ron asked. Harry groaned in return. "Okay", Ron said, took his hand away and stood up. Harry sighed and buried his head back in his pillow.
Draco laughed and pulled down his trouser. Potter knelt down before him. Glancing at Draco for permission, he slowly and carefully pulled the fabric of his pants away from his skin and down his thighs.
"Malfoy?" Neville asked and jumped up, "Malfoy!" Rage came up inside Neville. He balled his fists and got ready to punch Malfoy in the face.
Like a blessing, Malfoy came through the door. He didn't look around much, he walked straight towards Harry's table.
"Don't pretend it's such a loss for you. We don't even talk outside of this room," Potter said. Draco could see the hurt in his eyes and hugged him.
"I guess." Harry said even though he didn't want them to be afraid of him, he wanted them to get along with him.
"So that was when you had your Mojito, right?" Harry asked and Malfoy nodded agreeing "What means you saw me the same time I saw you."
"Malfoy, shut up now. When someone curses you I can't sit still and just watch, ok? Now tell me, who did this?", Harry said angrily.
" was the headline staring at Draco when he opened te box. Yeah, he did, he did return. It was the last newspaper that had an article about Potter in it. Nothing exciting had happened to Potter at Hogwarts so far. It made Draco wonder, because the last time he had seen this Daily Prophet he was sure this year wouldn't be easy for Potter. Maybe it wasn't easy for him but the news just didn't know about it yet.
"I would like that, yes. But I think it would be best if I had only a couple of days, so the others can spend time with him as well," Draco said and was surprised he actually thought of what the lunatics wanted.
Potter ran his finger carefully over one big scar on Draco's chest. Draco realised, that Potter noticed the scar for the first time now. He looked up at Draco with big green eyes.
"And my father and my mother wouldn't tolerate this. I mean, even if I would want this, they wouldn't," Draco finished the sentence anyways.
"Whoooah, easy there," Draco said and noticed he sounded a bit intimidating, so he added, "Where did that come from?" and a laughter. Potter just shrugged grinning.
Draco nodded understanding and looked at his hands, ashamed. He didn't exactly know what to say. He has always been annoyed by people calling Potter a hero, but Granger really
"You look neat," Malfoy said and smiled. Harry smiled too and felt his ears heating up. And now every time Harry was expecting Malfoy to be nice, he was going to be nice. Harry hadn't been disappointed in him for the last few weeks. Malfoy was nice most of the time, he got Harry out of awkward situations with his friends, he wanted Harry to look good, and his smile was just amazing.
Harry hesitantly stepped into the living room where Draco's mother sat on a leather couch. She wordlessly pointed at an armchair across from her and Harry say down. She didn't say anything for a moment, she just eyed Harry from his head to his feet. He felt very uncomfortable, being inspected by her like this.
Narcissa smiled, what looked rather like a grimace because through all the years she forgot how to smile properly. Draco replied with a soft smile and a nod of his head. And his mother went inside, followed by him.
That sat in awkward silence and sipped at their hot drinks. Harry looked around every now and then and watched the people coming and leaving.
Harry swallowed thickly. He wasn't stupid enough to do anything to Malfoy, but he still took the threat seriously. He nodded and the smile came back to Theo's face.
his face breaking into the first smile he had worn for days. Potter's hand gently rested on the banister and a silver watch glistened on his wrist. It was obvious he had tried to comb his hair. And his clothes... he wore a dark green turtleneck pullover that toned his muscular body, a white scarf wrapped around his neck and a very classy coat in the same colour as the pullover over it. Potter looked into the crowd and as he turned his head, Draco saw a silver earring sparkle beneath his wild black hair.
"Draco, don't start with this again. I already told you that I don't want to see him or my aunt or my stupid cousin.", he answered.
Since George wasn't here anymore, Ginny had agreed to help Fred out in the store for four times a week. As they stood in front of the doors, Harry just hoped today wasn't one of those days. He couldn't imagine the awkwardness.
"Hermione, do you want to study with me right now?" He asked at the sight of books and quills and rolls of parchment.
"Yeah. He told us he wanted to 'get in her pants'." Neville made air quotes, "But she wouldn't let him."
Draco bent over and kissed Potter hardly. Potter still had his tea in his hand and spilled it all over Draco's pants.
Draco fell down next to Harry. They both were breathless. Harry's heart was pounding so fast, as though it wanted to escape his chest.
For example that Harry and Draco talked every night. Or that Harry and Draco had sex. Or that Harry teached Draco how to produce a Patronus. Or anything else they had done.
"Malfoy asked Potter to marry him, months and months after the confirmation of their relationship and just a few weeks after their graduation. Draco Malfoy had proposed with a big gesture, suitable for such a dashing gentleman like Harry. All of their friends and Malfoy's mother Narcissa Malfoy were present and so happy for them."
Harry sat down on his bed and listened to the sound of the shower while looking out of the window. Malfoy didn't make it easy for Harry to like him. Harry desperately tried to win sympathy from Malfoy but all of his attempts banged against a wall - a wall Malfoy had built around himself.
She shrugged and they walked towards the library. Draco walked next to Potter in silence, while Potter talked to Granger and Weasley.
"Ron, is food really the only thing you love?", Hermione asked and crossed her arms in front of her chest. Ron smiled.
Tired and stuffed Harry, Hermione and Ron sunk into their couch and sighed happily. The sky outside was already getting darker. Harry felt a cool breeze of air coming through the opened window. He smiled.
"Maybe he's not as bad as you think he is." Hermione said and Ron and Harry looked at her in disbelief.
Straight after Harry came back from the bathroom, he wanted to talk to Ron and Hermione and tell them about what he had found out.
In the morning, Draco's back hurt and his head felt heavy. His legs had fallen asleep in the middle of the night. Draco wasn't sure if he had slept and if he did, it could have been only a couple of hours. With a lot of trouble, he got up, wiggled his feet to wake up his legs, and went into the bathroom.
"I'm sorry, Hermione, but I have something to do. We'll talk later.", Harry said and fought her arms off.
Harry woke up a few days later. He looked around. The sun shone through the big window. Malfoy was still asleep.
Hermione couldn't hold herself back and started crying. "I'm sorry, I know you don't want me to," she said, but Harry just wrapped his arms around her and pulled her closer.
Harry was woken up by Hermione's voice whispering his name and her slightly shaking his shoulder. He slowly opened his eyes. Unlike every other morning, he could see everything clearly right away, so Harry figured he must have fallen asleep with his glasses on... in the living room...
"You just made your biggest enemy," he said in a dangerous voice. Harry knew this voice - it was the same in what Malfoy used to talk to Harry. He was afraid that Malfoy was going to start a fight, so he came from behind and grabbed Malfoy's shoulders.
Harry searched for a black boxershort in his drawer and pulled it out, but Draco looked like he waited for something else.
Draco gasped and quickly grabbed the box from Harry and opened it, pulling the silky ribbons loose and dramatically pulled the lid off. He smiled with delight after popping a truffle in his mouth and fed one to the man next to him who reacted alike. Harry licked his chocolatey fingers.
"You made my life a living hell at Hogwarts! You ruined so many days for me with your stupidity and viciousness."
That went well. Depends on how you define well. At first, Harry got a bit aggressive, he had to admit, but then Malfoy opened.
Harry couldn't hold back a smile, but he also felt really sorry for Malfoy. It must have been such a big change. Harry just sighed and smiled emphatically. He didn't want Malfoy to feel bad right now. Harry's hand twitched, he thought for a second, and then carefully lay his hand on Malfoy's shoulder. Malfoy glanced over at Harry, who suddenly realized what the hell he was doing. Harry pulled his hand back and slid away from Malfoy. Why did he do this? Just when Harry didn't want to put Malfoy in the same position as the last time.
"Welcome to the family," Luna said in her dreamy voice and smiled. Harry laughed when he saw Malfoy forcing a smile as well. Neville clapped Malfoy on the shoulder and wished the two of them a happy reunion. Malfoy thanked him, what threw Neville a bit off track, but he smiled and left the hospital wing with his girlfriend.
Harry closed the fridge door with an outraged look. "Don't tell me you don't know what Mac and Cheese is!"
His hair was ruffled, his lips were pink and well-kissed, his cheeks were rosy and his pyjama was a simple mess.
, the beloved boy. Everyone had known his story when he was only a child and now even more people knew his story when he was eighteen. It was so unfair.
"I don't have the right to tell you things Harry told me in secret. And I thought we have better things on our mind right now," Hermione said and gestured around the hospital wing as well.
"Anyways, Ron, Dean, I would really appreciate it if you would be a bit more supportive," Harry said, his eyes still on Malfoy.
He knew Kreacher was just going to snap his fingers and everything was magically going to clean itself, but Harry just liked the old-fashioned Muggle ways. But sometimes a little magic in the household didn't hurt. For example making Harry's bed. Harry hated making his bed, it was so unnecessary. So Harry grabbed his wand, flicked it and watched the blanket lift and fold itself and fall down again neatly, the pillow squishing itself. Harry nodded satisfied and went back into the bathroom, where he cleaned toilet and sink, also with the help of magic.
What was suddenly starting to go wrong inside his head? Everything had been perfectly fine since Malfoy and Harry didn't argue anymore, but now these dreams and thoughts appeared and Harry's mind felt twisted. Harry reckoned it must have been the fight between Malfoy and Ron that reminded him of what a person Malfoy used to be. Harry didn't know if he could talk to Ron and Hermione about it, not after all that had happened. They wouldn't understand how Harry had felt before those dreams and to them the dream would be justified.
He opened the door and stepped inside. On the bed sat a boy. He was less fat than he had been when Potter was eleven years old and wore the same horrified look as his parents.
Draco had his head sunken while they walked upstairs to the sleeping rooms and while his freinds laughed about him. He held Potter's hand tightly.
Draco didn't answer. He just pushed the door open and Theo followed him inside. Draco looked around fascinated, so did his friend. The Muggles were crazy.
Harry thrust his fingers though Draco's hair and rested them there, Draco lay his hand on Harry's arse. They stood there in the middle of the deserted corridor and kissed, groping ass and hair.
Malfoy rolled his eyes and finally stuck out his index finger. Teddy wrapped his tiny fingers around it and his hair turned silvery-blond. Harry smiled at Draco's surprised expression.
"Let's go then," Longbottom said when Draco joined the group in the common room. He followed them down the stairs, over the grounds, through the main building and down to the station.
After they had finished their drinks, Harry paid the waitress and they went outside. The street lights illuminated the empty streets and Malfoy's pale skin and silver hair shone.
Draco felt lonely. Blaise, his only friend back at Hogwarts, had abandoned him and made friends with some weirdos from lousy houses. And Potter, who tried to be nice to Draco and who wanted Draco to be nice to him, wanted to sit next to him but Draco couldn't get himself to be seen with this idiot, especially not in the Great Hall where every student and every teacher was present. Draco sighed.
"I know.", he said and then, Draco took his hand. He needed to know that someone was there who would hold to him. Someone who won't let go. Draco needed someone like Harry Potter. And he had someone like Harry Potter.
"So.", Seamus squeezed himself next to Ron on the couch, while Dean sat down on the other armchair, opposite of Ginny.
Harry felt the nervosity again and concentrated hard on not to have another panic attack. Malfoy turned his head to look Harry in the eyes.
"Now, if you may excuse me... You don't want to talk to me anyways so-", Harry grabbed his bag and stood up.
Malfoy nodded again wordlessly. Harry gave up on the conversation and looked around. His friends were all having fun and Harry had to smile. Until his eyes fell on Katie Bell, who stood frozen in the middle of the crowd and stared at Harry and Malfoy. Harry nudged Malfoy in the side.
Without waiting for another response, Draco grabbed Potter's wrist and pulled him away from the rest of the group.
Draco watched Potter kneeling down on the floor in front of his bed and unpacking his own suitcase as well. He only had colourful clothes, the only dark clothing Potter owned were his school robes. Weirdo. Even his underwear was colourful. Draco placed his books on the shelf and put the box next to them.
This sentence hit Harry like a bolt. How- why? Why would he think that? Why would someone raise their child in the belief that being weak is wrong?
deep down. Harry felt so stupid. He stared at the boy in front of him and in one movement he turned around, opened the door and stormed out of the room. As he entered the common room he didn't know what to do. He couldn't talk to Ron or Hermione because they didn't know anything about it. So Harry started walking. Like he was being pulled by an invisible thread he walked through the trees, past Hagrid's hut and down to the lake where Neville sat and leaned against a tree.
Either Professor McGonnagal was reading Harry's mind, or his face gave away that he was worried about something.
It really helped him when he talked to Potter every night, but now that he and Potter didn't even sleep in the same room, Draco needed his mother.
At first, Harry's wrist was in a strange angle, but then he changed the angle a bit and-wow- it was fitting perfectly in his hand. Draco made a low desperate noise and bloody hell. Harry felt excitement flooding through him. Draco was moaning, his fingers digging into Harry's arm. It was incredible.
He and Potter had talked about the Half-Blood Prince before one night and Potter had also told him about the spells in the book.
"I wouldn't know. We don't actually talk about the Tournament. We don't really talk at all. Vic is more the physical being.", Hermione said with a slight laugh and Draco snickered.
In this moment, Malfoy swayed and fell face forward from the couch. Neville and Ron stormed towards him and lifted him back up.
On the roof, Malfoy pulled out his wand with one hand, holding his tea in the other. He elegantly flicked his wand and levitated the cup so it soared next to him in midair. Harry watched Malfoy pull out his pack of cigarettes, stuck one between his lips, lit it with his wand and put both wand and pack into his pocket again. Malfoy started sucking at the cigarette and puffed smoke into the night while the moon peeked through the clouds and lit up his silver hair. How could Harry be mad at him when he looked this good? Malfoy took a sip of his tea every now and then and Harry had emptied his cup already.
"Hermione gave it to me. The two of them seem to be pretty good with each other and Hermione said in case she'd loose her phone, I would still have her number." Harry explained calmly and tipped with his finger on the name of the Slyhterin.
"Harry, listen to him," Hermione said suddenly sternly and then suggested she and Ron will leave them alone.
"Oh, but yes I do. Granger would kill me if she would find out I'm not there for you. Also, I don't think I could stand not waking you up when I know you're having a nightmare," Malfoy answered smiling.
Harry's head was spinning. He grabbed his jacket from the coat rag and went back to the living room.
"Come on, let's watch James Bond." Harry said enthusiastically, but Malfoy still seemed unimpressed. He shook his head and said he wasn't interested in muggle stuff.
So Harry told them. About the room he didn't want to see, about the weird behavior of Mrs Malfoy, about the talk she had given him in the evening.
The last day had passed too fast for Draco's liking. He would have loved to spend more time with Pansy before they weren't going to see each other until the next holidays. Draco got up and dressed himself as fast as he could. Draco went downstairs where normally his father was already sitting in the dining room, but today there was only his mother placing the dishes on the table.
They had an enormous dinner. Mrs Weasley really outdid herself this time. Harry and Ron ate the most, though Ginny was close, too. Draco seemed to enjoy the food very much and praised Mrs Weasley several times for it. She always blushed and thanked him with a grin.
Harry took it and Draco pulled him to his feet. They stood on Draco's bed and Draco started dancing. Harry laughed. They danced and danced. Ten songs and then, Harry's Elvis Presley playlist ended.
"Good. Because, Potter, I love you. I never said that to someone before, but I do. Really. And no one could ever take your place.", Draco said.
"It's my room too, Malfoy. If you can't get dressed in the bathroom you have to count on me laying here and watching you," Potter answered.
"How can you expect me to sit here with this Death Eater and pretend nothing ever happened?" Ron asked loudly.
"Welcome back, Harry." He said, though his voice wasn't as clear coming through the portrait as Harry had known it in person.
"There is no but!", Harry shook his head groaning and left his two friends standing in the corridor alone.
"Oh Hermione, dear I'm so sorry. I didn't want to snap at you." The woman said suddenly friendly. "Harry. Ron." She greeted them shortly.
"In fact, I do." Hermione answered from the kitchen. She waited until Harry had tied his second shoe and then gave him a list.
The others grinned. Potter grabbed Draco's free hand and his green eyes sparkled behind his glasses in the light of the fire. Draco couldn't believe he had fallen in love with these green eyes. They talked and laughed for quite a while and it was the best Christmas day Draco had ever had - he almost didn't want it to end. But he was excited about what would happen next.
Draco nodded and Harry was relieved he could bring this stupid idea out of his head. But seriously, he knew Draco better. He knew that he won't give up.
Harry woke up when he felt Malfoy twitching next to him. The floor was still dark and the other hospital visitors were still sleeping. Harry figured Malfoy must have a nightmare, because his lips and upper body were twitching and he had a frightened look on his face, but his eyes were still closed.
"Please, Mr Potter." The minister said and pointed at the stool in the middle of the room. Potter stood up and gave Draco a quick look, before he walked over to the chair and sat down.
wasn't doing anything stupid? Ridiculous. Draco turned on the water and washed his face and mouth, so he got rid of the sour taste on his tongue.
Neville immediately noticed that something wasn't right with his friend and he asked Harry about it. Harry sighed. He reckoned he could tell Neville about it. Someone impartial who wouldn't try and squeeze the name of the person out of Harry, like Ron or Hermione would do. So Harry sat down next to him and folded his hands.
"You may not be who I had imagined, but I love Draco. I only want the best for him. And over the last few years he didn't get the best." Narcissa's voice wasn't as arrogant as Harry remembered it, but she seemed to get her old glow back with ever word that she spoke, "I suppose you do too?"
Harry sighed and started singing "Love me tender". Draco smiled and Harry's cheeks felt hot. As he finished, Draco held his arm up.
"The corporal is a lot more difficult, so no blame if you don't do it the first time. It took me several times until I managed it.", Harry smiled.
Draco wasn't very fond of the idea of sitting together with stinky boring Hufflepuff's and annoying smartasses Ravenclaw's. At least Blaise had got a little self respect left and didn't make friends with
In his room, Harry fed Bond and arranged the papers he wanted to take with him tomorrow, so he wouldn't forget anything. Exhausted, he fell into bed and closed his eyes. He still couldn't comprehend how his life had turned out so great. He only wished Sirius was here to tell him...
Harry stopped in mid-track. What if he really was in love with the git he had to share a room with? He walked faster and eventually run the last corridor to their room.
Apparently he thought Draco was just another young man looking for a random tattoo. How could he know Draco had more money than probably most of his customers had? Draco pushed his hair put of his face, showing the flashing ring with a silver serpent on his finger.
This was the perfect moment for Harry to tell her, he was going to tell Ron later after classes. So he told Hermione about how him and  Malfoy had kissed a few months ago and how they have been in the Shrieking Shack and how this has been going on for almost two months now. She didn't say a word, Harry saw she couldn't believe she had been worried about Malfoy killing Harry. Harry looked at her, unsure of what Hermione thought about this. But she didn't judge him, she didn't insult him or Malfoy. She had known that Harry liked boys just as he liked girls, but she hadn't known that he liked
"I'm also in love with you.", he said and his heart, God, his heart. It was hammering against his ribs and Harry wouldn't be surprised if Draco could hear it.
They danced for a long time. Ron, Neville, Seamus and Dean were already upstairs and probably already asleep, as Harry and Draco stopped dancing. But still a lot of students were in the Great Hall. Some were dancing, some were sitting and chatting and only a few were eating something. Hermione was still dancing with Krum.
Malfoy knew what Harry meant. He nodded, t didn't say a word. Harry needed to know what the reason for his trip to the hospital was, and who was responsible for it.
Goyle's reason was he wanted to stay at home and recover from the tragic loss. And he wanted to stay away from the place where it had happened; were Crabbe had died. The two of them had been very best friends since their childhood and Draco kind of understood him.
Theo left again, closing the door behind himself. Draco could hear him and Blaise talking in the living room. He stared at the black cashmere pullover and then finally decided to just put it on. Looking at himself in the mirror, Draco picked at the pullover - he didn't know if he liked it. He put on a shining silver watch, what made the outfit look a little better.
After a long time, Harry was getting sleepy and yawned. "Do you want to sleep in your uniform?" Malfoy asked, but Harry only shrugged. He was already half asleep.
Harry sighed. This was horrible. He couldn't understand how people were still thinking like that, thinking there is only good and evil. Harry always had to think about Sirius when a topic like that would come up. He could hear Sirius's voice in his head saying "The world isn't split into good people and Death Eaters." Harry got up and changed into his pyjama a nicely knitted one (by Mrs Weasley of course). Halfway through, with both hands in the sleeves of his sweater, Harry looked at Draco and sighed.
"Because I just saw your little girlfriend in the library with someone else and I was a bit surprised," Draco answered.
. Draco pulled a face like he had just bitten into a citrus. The thing that had happened a week ago... Draco didn't want to remember. He was so ashamed of himself. It was nothing, Draco knew that. It's not like the had kissed this idiot or something, he was just so close to him and so nice and handsome and ugh. Draco shivered.
Harry tried to sit up, but it didn't work. His arms were too weak to hold him up. He sunk back down and closed his eyes shortly.
"I bought it when I was at Diagon Alley with Theo the other day. You know, when we met in the bookstore."
Harry laughed. Even though this situation was far from happy, the fact that Draco wanted to see Teddy made it all seem a little better. He decided he would go as soon as possible the next morning.
"Go on, then. Get dressed and get back in your own bed.", Draco said and smiled. Harry nodded and pulled up his pyjama bottoms and walked over to his bed.
"You're pretty good with elves, aren't you?", he asked grinning. Potter looked perplexed to see Draco grinning.
Harry smiled and sat down on the chair Dumbledore used to sit on when he heard footsteps coming up the stone stairs that led to the office. A young student Harry didn't know knocked shyly on the opened door and Harry waved her inside. The girl say down on the chair across from Harry and took a deep breath. Harry could see how nervous she was.
When they make Potter that unhappy, then they are no good friends. Draco stepped out from behind the shelf and walked up to their table. The three of them looked at him, only on in Potter's face was relieving to be seen. Draco smiled at him.
"Hermione, if you won't shut up I'll curse you alright? I won't discuss with you about Draco. Ask Ron what he thinks about that."
"Look, forget it. It’s not like I care either way.", but Draco sounded like he did care. Harry was getting nervous.
They all stood around the big bonfire, that was bewitched to shine through the snow, and warmed each other. Harry looked into the snowy night, eggnog in one hand and Malfoy in the other, and smiled. Everyone seemed very happy as the evening went on and the quarrel about Fred seemed forgotten. Harry was happy to have Draco by his side.
"Draco Malfoy, son of prominent Death Eater Lucius Malfoy and proud Slytherin, had his arm around Potter's waist and with Potter's friend Ron Weasley, he helped Potter to stand straight."
"How was your day, Malfoy?", he asked and hoped that Malfoy would use legilimens again to talk to him, but he didn't.
"I do. I think it's for Hufflepuffs!", he said and smiled. Potter chuckled, pressing a kiss to his mouth.
"Yeah, well it's not that hard to believe since you tried to kill me for the last seven years," Harry said jokingly, but Malfoy didn't think this was funny at all.
wrong with Malfoy these last weeks. He hadn't spoken since he ran out on Harry in the Shrieking Shack. Where did the sudden change of heart come from? They have been so close and all of a sudden he ran out. And then it occured to him. Harry jumped up and took a few steps.
"Hermione, we're both alright. Malfoy's mother has plant poisoning and I didn't want to let him visit her on his own."
Harry was surprised. So was Hermione. Harry thought he saw her flush for a second. Malfoy really knew how to play and Harry nudged him in the side. He looked at Harry, grinned and shoved an entire cinnamon bun in his mouth. Harry laughed and turned back to his friends. This was nice. Everything was nice- the snow, the friends, the food and the feeling of Malfoy's arm brushing Harry's.
Draco breathed out relieved and stepped in. He grabbed fresh clothes and made his way back to the Room of Requirement.
"I know, okay? I know. But something has changed, don't ask me what. I don't understand it myself!", answered Harry loudly.
"Well how could I if she never told me, huh? See I go here with her because I wanted to get into her pants okay, but for weeks she won't let me and now I know why. This little slut never told me about her stupid red-headed boyfriend so how the hell am I supposed to know, can you tell me that?" Flynn said.
Harry grinned at Draco and they got into the car. At first, Draco was hesitating to get into a Muggle thing, but he did it anyways.
Oh Potter, why did he have to look like that? And why did he have to be so nice to Draco? And why, for heavens sake,
Draco smiled and Harry pressed a kiss to Draco's pale lips. Harry hugged him and Draco buried his face into Harry's shoulder. Harry stroked Draco's beautiful soft hair, smiling. Draco sniffed.
Harry nodded. He had read about it in the Prophet a few weeks ago. Horrible picture, horrible article. A lot of other Death Eaters were being locked up at Azkaban. Harry wondered why Draco wasn't.
Harry moaned himself and let go of Draco's skin. A dark spot made itself visible and Harry smiled satisfied.
Harry smiled, got up and walked over to Malfoy's bed. He lay in there all snuggled up and looked ridiculously like a child.
Draco felt Potter's breath against his neck and Potter put his arms around Draco's waist. Draco grabbed his hands. They stood there and looked at Draco's mother- Narcissa Malfoy.
"What? No! For what?" Malfoy said suddenly very loud, "You didn't do anything wrong! This guy is an asshole who doesn't know what he's talking about."
"Before you ask, I'm not giving you Potter now. He needs to explain something to me. It's private so I can't let you listen. And besides, Potter doesn't have to stick to you whenever you want. So if you will excuse us, we have something to discuss."
"So you don't have to sleep in them, you idiot." Harry pulled off the black shoes, then the trousers and folded them up on the chair.
nice. And then we went into the Shack. I wanted him to talk to me without being afraid anyone could overhear him," Harry explained.
Suddenly Harry's heart dropped. The smile fell off of his lips and his hands got sweaty. Harry's heart was pounding and hammering against his chest so loud he could hear it.
Draco read the letter one more time and then rolled it together. He walked out and climbed the stairs to the owlery, where he chose a brown owl and bound the letter to her leg. She flew away. Draco looked after her.
"Look Malfoy, I just want to talk to you." Harry said and felt his own nervousness rising, but at least he got Malfoys attention now.
Harry and Ron were applying for training as an Auror at the ministry, even though Harry figured they had good chances even without applying. Ron nodded, so they went underground to the Ministry of Magic after lunch.
As Harry finished, he stood in front of Draco's bed, his arms crossed. Draco didn't look up, but Harry knew he noticed him. After the fifth time that Harry had cleared his throat, Draco finally looked up.
Harry clicked at a picture where Harry and Malfoy were walking down a street, drunk. He scrolled further and came to a video.
They sat down on the table, next to the other Gryffindors. Where was Draco? Had it something to do with bus friends? What did they talk about? Was Draco just too proud to tell Harry and to ask him for help? Harry sighed, what caught Ginny's attention.
They stood in front of the South entrance of the Ministry of Magic. Even though his father had been in the ministry most of his time, Draco had been here only once and they had used the North entrance, therefore this entrance was new to Draco. Narcissa turned to her son and looked at him.
He was more than grateful that his friends were starting to come around on the idea of him and Malfoy being kind of nice to each other.
Days had passed, but Draco hadn't heard any news about Potter. Many people whispered around him when he came closer, but he was used to that and nothing they whispered was true. Draco hadn't seen Matt since the accident and he thought it was better this way. Apart from classes, Draco stayed in his room all day. He barely ate and barely slept, he couldn't find motivation to do his hair or shave. When the weekend came around, Draco found himself sleeping until ten or even eleven o'clock. He had missed breakfast many times because he had slept in.
He took a deep breath and Draco held his hand. Every house in thus street looked similar. In front of this house stood a red thing with four wheels. Potter said it was a car, which Muggles used to get feom one place to another. Draco had read about cars in the book.
Harry shook his head. "He can't just show up here and expect me to forgive him. That's not how it works."
Potter huffed as though he was suffocating and pulled away. Draco was soothed in a moment, however, when Potter slipped off him and rolled to his side, pulling Draco with him, so they ended up facing each other again.
Potter sat up, too. Draco could hardly see his face in the dim light, but he knew Potter looked unsure. "I would never,
He shuddered. Draco didn't look away from Harry, he just glared at him, his eyes dangerous and somehow full of lust.
They lay there on the couch. Draco was being used as a pillow by his boyfriend, who read the Daily Prophet.
They sat up unsure. Draco ran his hands slowly yet surely up the thighs he was currently knelt between, savouring the shiver than ran through the body they were attached to.
"No, Draco. This man can answer to any of your questions about these things.", he explained and Draco nodded. The man smiled.
Draco had always had the feeling Pansy kind of had a crush on him, but he didn't care, he had never cared.
Harry realized it had been silent for a long time now. No one talked. Not even Malfoy. He didn't try to talk himself out of this, he didn't start a fight and he didn't leave. He just stood there and looked at Harry with his amazing steel-grey eyes. Harry looked at him questionable and tried to figure out if it was okay to tell them officially - together. But before Malfoy could give Harry the slightest clue, Ron talked.
"I tried to be nice because Potter wanted me to. But if you come at me with all of this bullshit, then I just have to say go drown yourself!"
So Theo had left half an hour after Draco had and hasn't even noticed Draco hadn't been there anymore.
Weasley didn't answer her, but kept talking to Draco, "See, Malfoy. Without their consent, we can't tell you where Harry is. So I suggest you better get your damn shit together and be nice."
"You can't always shut me out!" Harry said quietly but loud enough for Malfoy to hear it through the noise of the rain.
Harry understood and followed Ron into the kitchen where the stove was filled with pans in which eggs, bacon, sausages and vegetables were cooking.
Every single one contained at least one article about Harry. "This is like my life as titles, stuffed in a box," Harry said.
Harry nodded understanding. He never thought of it like that, but he finally realized how hard it really must be for Malfoy to accept all the things he had done wrong.
"Stop being so suspicious, Potty. I said it and I meant it. Don't be so shocked.", Draco said. Harry couldn't trust his ears. His jaw dropped. This was a joke. It needed to be.
"I'm just worried about his mother. And what if being there makes me remember all that stuff and we fight?" Harry said, now starting to eat the eggs himself.
"Draco, we need to get up.", Harry whispered. Draco rubbed his cheek on Harry's bare chest and shook his head sleepy.
"I think you don't have to figure it out.", he said friendly, "Maybe you could tell me what's going on inside
She hugged Harry and Harry smiled kindly. Malfoy turned away, but his mother slapped him in his head and looked at him with a stern look.
If someone would have told Draco that he would some day end up sitting on Harry Potter's couch watching a movie with Harry Potter, Draco would have told them they were crazy. But it actually was kind of nice. Well not nice... but not bad.
Harry nodded. He didn't want to be impolite, so he smiled as he gave her the money. And when he left the store he turned around again and waved her goodbye.
Potter steered right towards them and just when he reached them, he opened his arms and hugged Draco's mother. He gave her a quick kiss on every cheek and then let her go.
They lay down in their beds and Draco smiled. Somehow Potter understood him. In some way both of them shared the same past. With a smile on his face, sleep swept over Draco.
They stopped in front of the library doors. Ron took a deep breath and Harry lay his hand on Ron's shoulder.
Harry grinned back. He knew that Draco had no chance against his Firebolt, and soon enough, Draco found that out himself. They soared through the air, the wind ruffling through Harry's hair while Malfoy's hair stayed exactly as neat as always, after all it had taken him fifteen minutes this morning to get it like this. Flying had always been relieving to Harry, something where he can clear his mind. But now, as he was flying above the grounds of Malfoy Manor with Draco Malfoy, Harry couldn't clear his head.
After breakfast, Draco sat down with Teddy at the piano and played a calm melody in the background whil Ron and Harry sat down to open Hermione's letter and answer her.
Harry widened his eyes curiously. Before Malfoy got up, he leaned in for a kiss. Harry chuckled and watched him walk out of the room and out of sight. When Malfoy came back, Harry gasped. Malfoy held the mysterious black box in his hands and carried it over to Harry. Harry already reached for it before Malfoy even sat down, but Malfoy pulled away.
Now there was no Potter who banged on the door for one thousand times because Draco needed to hurry up.
"What are you smiling about?", Potter asked and lay his head on Draco's chest, his black hair tickling Draco's chin.
Malfoy put the glass on the mantelpiece and took a step towards Harry. Harry's eyes widened as he saw Malfoy smiling at him softly. This was something completely different.
Harry grinned and followed Hermione upstairs into her and Ginny's room. She took out a trunk from under the bed. Harry furrowed his brow as she opened it.
Harry didn't know what to do. He wanted to believe him, but he didn't know if he could. "You're drunk." Harry said.
Theo snorted. "No, but even though you might be able to hide it from everyone else, you forget that I know you pretty well and you can't hide it from me."
"Smooth move, Potty. Is that your technique to get me doing it with you on this table?", Draco laughed.
"Exactly. And besides, I don't think you will be the only one returning for their last year, what is really admirable by the way." Harry said nodding.
Harry smiled. He loved her. Ron grabbed a piece of parchment and they both dipped their quills in ink and started to write an answer. Harry told Hermione that Malfoy was doing fine, he was currently playing the piano with Teddy. Ron told her about his work and that he missed her as well. As usual, they filled the envelope with pictures - this time some of their Halloween celebration. Bond squeaked happily as Harry have him the envelope and he jumped out the window.
"I'm not. I don't want to see all these people staring at me and thinking about hexes they could use on me the second I leave the hall. Even
Platform nine and three quarters was already filled with students from Hogwarts. Draco could clearly see the new first years, who were all standing next to their proud parents. There also were the cool middle school kids - the ones from fourth grade who wore sunglasses and bewitched chains around their neck. Draco rolled his eyes. Sunglasses. Ridiculous. There were also many faces Draco recognised from his time at Hogwarts. Beneath them the annoying little Creevey boy, who looked rather grey and didn't talk at all, what was very odd and unusual for him. Draco and Blaise got eye contact and Draco told his mother he was going to go on the train while Blaise made his way through the crowd over to Draco.
"Your friend Nott said to me-", Harry swallowed, "You know, when we left, he said to me that I should keep imagine that you like me, because you don't."
"I'm sorry about last night. I was a drunken idiot and I shouldn't have behaved like that." Draco said while he played with Teddy's small hand.
Harry smiled at the scene and Hermione shook Draco's hand as well. As soon as they said goodbye to everyone, Harry and Draco left Kings Cross. The car of uncle Vernon parked on the street and Harry's family stepped outside.
Potter's hand held him awkwardly, but then Potter released Draco's cock and re-gripped it more surely, caressing, before his thumb circled over the wet tip and his strokes evened out.
Harry visited Malfoy the first day of the following week. He was glad to see the colour - as much as he had - coming back to his face and he seemed to get stronger as well. It was in the evening when Harry came over and he planned to stay the night. Ron was visited by George, so he wasn't going to be alone, he also basically sent Harry off. Of course, Malfoy's bed was big enough for the both of them plus extra space for each one. It was an impressive bed, Harry hadn't expected it to be this soft when he sat down.
After a while where Blaise laughed about his absolutely funny new friends, Draco couldn't stand it anymore.
Harry smiled back thankfully. He and Ron grabbed as many drinks as they could get and walked back to where the group was dancing.
"You know, I just did what he told me. Harry told me to bring you his message and I did. He said if you dont listen to me, I should tell you that your boyfriend needs you. That's it.", Weasley said and smiled.
"Maybe I can teach you.", Harry suggested carefully. Malfoy looked up and his grey eyes met Harry's.
Theo's nosy look followed Draco from the door through the living room until he sat down next to Theo on the sofa.
"Oh come on, as if that wasn't your plan," Draco answered smirking while taking off the dress shirt. He stood there in his tight black undershirt and looked at Potter, who stared back at him.
"Anyways", Harry cut Ron off, "Draco didn't want to spend his holidays at home, so he said he'd go to Parkinson or someone."
Outside, Harry found that as hot as the days were the nights were cold, and he was glad he'd brought a jacked with him. Just as he wanted to mount his broom, his eyes fell on someone leaning against the wall of the pub and what seemed to be smoking a cigarette.
Then he stopped. Four confused faces were staring at Harry and Malfoy with open mouths and wide eyes.
Malfoy took another breath and Harry realized that Malfoy's eyes were glistening because they were getting wet. Harry didn't know what to do, he had never seen Malfoy cry - to be honest he'd never even thought Malfoy was able to.
Harry nodded. He didn't know what to say. Malfoy had never - not once - said a nice word about Harry's parents. All he had done was insult them and Harry couldn't bear to hear it one more time.
"But I just need someone who can feel, you know? Someone who can show me how they feel." Harry added.
Malfoy's lip twitched. And finally after so many years, Harry saw him smile. It was gone as fast as it had appeared, but it was progress.
"Father, I'm sorry, but for one- or five times- in your life, you should have listened to him.", he answered.
When Harry and Ron landed at The Burrow, Hermione and Ginny already stood outside and waited for them. Ginny smiled and hugged her brother, then Harry. Harry was very grateful for her friendly behavior even though she sort of knew about what had been between him and Malfoy.
Malfoy made a sound that almost could have been a laugh. It made Harry smile. He sipped at his beer and watched Malfoy drinking his whisky while his gaze was fixed at something outside the window. The waitress brought mugs of coffee to the business men and Harry wondered how many cups they have already had. Harry and Malfoy drank their drinks in silence as Harry felt the awkwardness slowly washing away.
Draco didn't know when the movie would end but it seemed like it had already reached its climax. It was shortly after eight p.m. and Draco didn't know when Weasley and his girlfriend would get back. But when Draco turned his head to ask Potter about it, he found that Potter was fast asleep. Draco froze. He didn't know what to do - should he say something and wake Potter up or should he just let him sleep?
Harry folded the map open and searched for Draco. McGonnagal, Nearly Headless Nick, Mister Filch, but no Draco. No where. Harry searched desperately for him, but he wasn't visible anywhere.
"What are you doing?" Potter asked, Draco opened his eyes and snapped his head back down so fast that his neck hurt.
"We can confirm that your mother suffered from plant poisoning. She is now awake, so if you wish to visit her you can do so, but only for a few minutes, because she needs to rest." She read from her clipboard.
"Don't be sorry for everything. I'm an asshole and you know it, so don't be sorry for me doing shit!"
Ginny only nodded wordlessly and turned back to Hermione. Harry helplessly looked at Ron, who shrugged and sighed.
Draco didn't pay attention on where he was walking, and so he found himself nose to nose with a fat seventh-year from Gryffindor, who was surrounded by four other boys. One had his wand pressed into Draco's back, the other three held their wands chest high. Draco breathed out.
Ginny waved him over to the table she, Ron, Hermione and Dean sat on. Hermione wasn't in her familiar position - nose buried in a book, but a giant leather-bound book lay in front of her and Harry suspected she was having it at the ready for when Harry and Ron would have left.
Harry didn't read the rest of the letter, he put it on the couch table and sat down next to Malfoy, putting his arm around him. Harry looked at Malfoy. He had never seen him so broken. Without saying a word, Malfoy got up and walked towards the hallway.
Draco nodded and even though he tried to hide it, Harry knew he was happy about that. Harry smiled and leaned back in his chair. Did Malfoy reall think it was necessary for Harry to come out to him after the kiss they had shared on the rooftop? Harry figured Malfoy was just very unfamiliar with this story of thing - coming from a strict household like this. But it was still good to see that Malfoy was ready to talk, maybe not about everything, but about a lot.
She leaned over the armrest of the couch and stared at Draco. Two days ago he'd been glad to finally talk to Theo, but now Pansy was here again and she was more annoying than before.
Harry could vomit right now. Were they kidding? Yeah, good idea. Leave Harry and Ginny alone. But Harry said they could be friends.
It's been three days since Narcissa Malfoy has been released from the hospital. Draco had written Harry, telling him that he would stay with his mother until the end of the week. Harry had been happy to hear from Malfoy and immediately wrote back, saying that he hoped she would feel better soon. Harry, Ron and Hermione spent the day after Harry had gotten the letter in their garden.
He headed back to his room, which was empty as it had been before. Also Draco's bed was still untouched. Harry walked over to this bed and smelled. He inhaled the wonderful smell and smiled. It almost felt like Draco was there. But Harry knew he wasn't.
The brewing of the potion took a long time and Harry checked his watch every now and then to make sure it will have finished the time he told Malfoy to come.
"Merlin, if you want to see my dick hanging around just tell me, you homo," Draco said annoyed and pretended to loosen his towel.
Harry stood in the shower, cold water running down his back. He couldn't help but think about Malfoy's face when he'd stormed out of Harry's house - the image was for ever going to be burned into Harry's mind. Harry thought it was such a shame they have wasted years of hating each other when instead they could have been friends. Turned out they really could get along. They have just started becoming friends and then this stupid thing happened. How did this happen? How could Harry think it was the right thing to do?
"We love Harry, all of us do. And we haven't seen him as happy as with you in a long time. So many things, you included, made his life miserable. But Harry kept living, put everyone else above himself and sacrificed his happiness. He sacrificed himself just so we could live. You might disagree, you might be sick of hearing this, but Harry is a hero. Ron and I were with him on this horrible journey and we know what he went through. So for us the term
Ron and Hermione sat with Neville and Luna and, to Harry's bad luck, Ginny. He had managed it to avoid her for the last week, but now it was impossible, because he wanted to sit with his friends.
"I don't think I have to ask what your favorite colour is, do I?" Malfoy said, nodding towards Harry's red T-shirt.
"My- What my problem is? I'LL SHOW YOU WHAT MY PROBLEM IS!", Mr Malfoy shouted and stood up, trembling with his whole body.
Tongues entwining, bodies moving against each other, Harry cried out as they came together, Draco groaning deeply against his mouth.
"Ready?" Dean asked. Everyone was ready, so they went downstairs to the Great Hall. Breakfast was already in full swing when they walked in.
Malfoy looked at the small creature and smiled. He nodded without saying a word. So it was not only Harry he was not taking to.
Malfoy only shook his head again. He kept his gaze on his shaking hands in his lap and Harry could see that he bit his lip. Harry would've bet that Malfoy had looked like this all sixth year but he had just hidden it very well.
"Oh, I absolutely can." Harry said grinning, "What's behind that door?" Harry pointed at a wooden door with a beautiful handle next to the small fireplace.
"Kreacher!", he shouted loudly and Draco twitched. He heard footsteps and someone jumped down the stairs.
But now after the war, after everything that had happened, Harry felt sorry for him. Harry had realized not long after Lucius Malfoy had died, that Draco Malfoy was a coward. And the events at the bookstore proved that once again. Malfoy felt superior to everyone, everyone except his family. Harry remembered when they had been at Malfoy Manor and Draco had been so afraid of his father, so Harry couldn't even imagine his fear of Voldemort. Malfoy must have been really afraid after all he had done.
The three of them walked inside. The first two desks Harry saw were empty. They walked a few steps and Harry, Neville and Ron scanned the library until Harry spotted - sitting on a quiet table - Hermione. She was sitting next to a boy Harry didn't know. His arm was wrapped around her shoulder and she was more laughing than studying. Harry and Neville looked at each other and then at Ron. He stood there frozen still, his face white as chalk.
"This will be cold for a second.", he said and waved his wand over Draco's red knuckles. Indeed, coldness swept over his hand, but vanished after a second.
Seven faces were burnt out of the tree. Draco noticed Potter looking at the burnt hole over the name of his godfather Sirius, but Draco noticed another face.
Silence swept over them again, but this time it wasn't as uncomfortable. Harry even slid back towards Malfoy, but only so close he didn't quite touch him. Harry heard Malfoy's slow breathing and couldn't keep his eyes off the simultaneously rising and falling chest. Maybe Malfoy didn't notice it, but even if he did he didn't say anything. Malfoy looked extremely tired, but Harry didn't want to mention it because he thought Malfoy would leave then. And funnily enough Harry didn't want him to leave.
Harry heard Ron sitting up and grabbing his wand. Whispering "Lumos", the tip of Ron's wand lit up and Harry could see his face.
Tongue met tongue and sparks flew inside Harry's stomach. He breathed hardly but didn't stop moving because he wanted and needed to hear Malfoy moan again, but to Harry's surprise Malfoy made him moan again by digging his fingers into Harry's butt. Harry pulled away even though he didn't want to, but he suddenly became very aware of the fact that they stood on the roof of a hospital in the pouring rain while Malfoy's mother was downstairs unconscious.
Seamus looked immediately intrigued. He smiled charmingly and pushed a hand through his neatly combed hair. Harry might have even seen him blush. He guessed there was one employee for everyone of them in these stores.
Harry smiled and stood up. He pulled an MP3 player from the pocket of his jeans and searched a good song from Elvis Presley. "Jailhouse Rock" started playing.
Harry watched her running a hand though her hair and turned his head to look at Malfoy as she came close to their table.
"Being Harry Potter in a room full of wizards and witches can be really hard. Especially when every two minutes someone comes up to you and wants to talk."
"Bring him to the bed over here.", she said, pointing on one bed with grey blankets, that looked just like every other bed in the room.
She had black hair and a snooty expression. It was Draco's aunt Bellatrix Lestrange. Draco didn't answer. He should be on the family tree as well. He should be on the same branch as his mother was.
The first few times Theo had said it have already annoyed Draco, but now hearing Pansy's voice was unbearable. She was knocking at his door, which he'd locked carefully when he'd gotten home the day before and Draco hadn't seen the outside of his room since then.
Nott shrugged. "She must have gotten a letter as well for she is his mother. I got one because I live with him, you know?"
That was it. The time had come where Draco was afraid of what people thought of him. He was even more afraid of what they would think if they knew what had happened two weeks ago in his room in the dark. Draco sighed and sat back down on the armchair and put his homework on his lap but had no intention to actually do it. He was lazy today. All he wanted to do was to sit and sigh. Draco was afraid to tell Potter how he felt because first, he didn't know what exactly he felt and second, he knew Potter didn't feel anything at all. Draco sighed again. He tilted his head back, closed his eyes and sighed.
"Careful, Malfoy. You're in a room full of people who hate you.", he said and Harry would have loved to hex him.
Draco heard them getting up and walking over to him. He threw up once again. This was so disgusting!
take it the wrong way. "I'm sharing a flat with Theo." Malfoy continued to Harry's surprise and relief.
"Mr Malfoy?" The same healer that had asked Harry about their relationship earlier came up to them just as they entered the third floor again.
Harry groaned silently and stood up. Without a noise, he threw on his oversized t-shirt and slipped into his shoes. With his wand lit in the right, and the invisibility cloak in the left hand, he sneaked out of the portrait hole. The portraits were snoring peacefully, as Harry crept past them. He couldn't believe he was doing this.
Draco tried to fight his smile and shoved Potter away. The idiot let himself fall on his bed and switched on the dim light next to it. He watched Draco who took off his watch and put it on the desk.
"Go outside then, if you want. I'm looking for my books." Hermione said and rolled her eyes. But Ron was too in love with her and maybe a bit too scared of making her angry, so he stayed by her side.
Down in the Great Hall all of his friends were already eating. "Where have you been?" Hermione asked with her usual worried look. Harry only waved the question away and sat down. He piled food on his plate, started eating and listened to the talk of his friends.
left the pub half an hour before Theo had, but he hasn't come home at that time. He sipped his tea and skimmed the page of the Daily Prophet. Something about a Quidditch game and an injured player. Draco closed the paper again and put it back on the table. He looked at the sky and let the sun burn his skin.
"I like it when you're smiling," Potter said and traced his finger over Draco's lips. Draco flinched by the touch and pushed his head into the pillow.
For a second, Harry didn't realise it was him, that Draco had named "sweetie", but after a moment, he followed Draco down into the common room. Many people were looking at them.
After dessert Harry and his friends left the restaurant and strolled around Diagon Alley. Ron and Neville kept their promise and politely but firmly stopped every excited witch or wizard running towards Harry. Either way, the group met with Dean, Ginny and Seamus as they walked past a second-hand store. They all wished Harry a happy birthday - Ginny decided to give him a hug instead of an awkward handshake, what made Harry suddenly realize how much had changed. He didn't feel the tickling sensation in his chest when they hugged, his heart didn't rush and he didn't inhale her perfume. He just hugged her and was glad when they separated again. The group made their way further up the Alley until they reached the Hog's Head.
Hermione wasn't very approachable that day, her nose was buried in books already, what Ron and Harry couldn't understand at all.
Malfoy and Teddy watched each other intensely and Teddy reached out to Draco with an interested look. Harry saw Draco's hand twitching.
He breathed out and followed his mother to the dining room. In front of the long table stood his father- Lucius Malfoy.
They stood up and followed Ron dowm into the common room, where Dean, Seamus, Hermione and Ginny waited.
"This is Draco's room. I think he doesn't mind if you stay in here for tonight.", Narcissa said, smiling.
"Malfoy. Hey. I didn't expect you to be here.", Harry said. Malfoy rolled his eyes as Harry sat down. Two elves brought him his  breakfast.
To Harry's relief Malfoy nodded. He still seemed uncertain, but Harry took what he could get. Harry thought he might have even seen a tiny lift of Malfoy's corner of his mouth.
After his mother had convinced Draco that the Manor wasn't the best place for him anymore, Draco had left her with a heavy heart and moved in with Theo. It still made Draco sad thinking about his mother never leaving the giant house in which she was all by herself. And besides, he hated Theo's small rudimentary flat.
"Will you eat with me and my friends tomorrow?", he asked. Draco didn't know what to answer to that.
Harry laughed even louder as Hermione grabbed Ron's bag and pulled out three boxes of Liquorice Wands. Ron shrugged sulky and put two boxes back.
"Bye, Harry. Malfoy.", Weasley and Granger called after them. They both waved and Potter took Draco's hand.
This was crazy. Harry wasn't sure if he could say this out loud, but it was, it was crazy. Newspapers. Just-
Draco's fingers skimmed over the head of Harry's cock and Harry forgot how to speak. How to breathe.
Harry laughed. He sat Teddy on his lap and smiled as Teddy's brown hair turned black. This little bundle of happiness was all that was left of Remus and Harry would give his life to protect him. The bell rang. Harry gave Teddy to Ginny and got up.
As soon as Harry had finished his lessons for the day, he walked up to McGonnagal's office. Harry knocked and stuck his head inside. "Professor?" He asked politely. Professor McGonnagal looked up at him, shoved her glasses up her nose and smiled.
"No, of course not, Mione. You come right after food.", he said and laughed as Hermione pushed him on his shoulder.
When he finally got Ron out of bed, Neville pulled him into the common room where Malfoy half sat, half lay on the couch. Ron turned to look at Neville with big eyes.
Harry nodded nervously. He felt his own cock leak against his stomach, then Draco's hand skimmed over his navel, and he knew Draco would be feeling it too, the slippery trail of pre-come. Draco's breath caught in his throat, a little stuttery inhale, then his fingers brushed across Harry's shaft and Harry bucked wildly into his touch.
Suddenly, the others around them vanished. It was now only Harry and Draco, the voices of the other students were dull. Harry smiled.
After a few silencing charms, he pulled down his pyjama bottoms and grabbed his dick. He started rubbing his hand up and down and his thoughts drifted off to Malfoy. Not how he was in the dream, but how he was in real life. An arse. But he was somehow... no! He was not cute! Frustrated, Harry came over himself, but didn't feel more satisfied than before. Great! Now the fist time he ever wanked was because of
Harry slid down under the covers and tried not to do anything too stupid. Draco's knee bumped into Harry's, cold and a bit bony, and Harry made a hiccuping kind of noise of surprise, and then they both laughed, together this time, and when they stopped, there was a kind of expectant silence.
Harry and Ron agreed and Hermione got up to take a shower. Ron said he'll come with her. So Harry sat on the terrace in the sun, thinking about how he didn't have anyone to go take a shower with. He sighed.
"Well, I don't know...", said Harry, "I already know who I'm going to ask, but I don't know whether they already have one."
Harry got up and got dressed. He didn't need his school uniform today, because the talk with McGonnagal and the people from the Ministry of Magic was going to take up most of his classes, so it wouldn't be worth attending them after the meeting. So Harry put on his dark blue jeans and a white shirt.
"Blaise and I will check out the place to see if everything is as I told them." Theo replied, "You only need to get ready, I know how long it takes."
Potter's palm, pressed to Draco's cheek, was spreading heat over Draco's skin and he couldn't help making a small sound of approval when his bottom lip was pulled between Potter's teeth, then his lips, before it was released and the warm touch disappeared.
In the matter of the following week, London has evolved into a beautiful winter wonderland. Harry and Ron have been at work most of the week, but on Saturday they went out and about with Draco. It was nice to see him again and even though they didn't hold hands in public, Harry felt Malfoy's hand brushing his own every now and then. They walked through the snow, wrapped in coats and scarfs, through Diagon Alley. Ron wanted to stop and see George, so they made their way down to the joke shop.
"It's- it's really hard for me to tell you this." He breathed out heavily again and closed his eyes once more.
Harry nodded. He really needed to talk to Draco's roommate about this before he could make a final decision. Harry took a quick shower and got changed into fresh clothes before he packed Teddy's bag with magical diapers, toys and clothes. In the kitchen, Harry grabbed a box with leftover food and a banana for Teddy.
It was hard to explain. Harry never felt something for other boys apart from Draco. He was the only one.
Draco's heart leapt forward together with his body as he shot bolt upright. He pressed one hand against Potter's open mouth and gripped Potter's hip with the other.
"YOU ARE A DISAPPOINTMENT TO THE WHOLE FAMILY! FIRST, A GRYFFINDOR, SECOND WITH A MUDBLOOD MOTHER AND HE IS THE ARCH ENEMY OF YOUR FATHER'S BOSS! I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHAT IS GOING ON INSIDE YOU, BUT I WANT YOU TO SOLVE THIS PROBLEM AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE!"
"Including this table?", he asked and pointed on the small round kitchen table made out of dark wood. Potter nodded.
Both he and Hermione jumped up and asked Harry what was wrong. "What did the letter say?" Hermione asked.
"So, the first time, you came out of the shower and you had a towel wrapped around your waist just like this and your haor was a mess, just like this and I have to tell you, I became hard within two seconds.", Harry continued and Draco smirked self-satisfied.
In his dormitory, Harry grabbed a towel, the Marauders map, his egg, wand and invisibility cloak for the emergency. He left Hermione with Ron in the common room and set off for the fifth floor.
"You will see him soon again." Andromeda said to him even though he couldn't understand what she was saying.
Lucius looked at Harry for a long time and leaned back in his chair. He narrowed his eyes and drank from his red wine.
"What? Can't we even go to the owlery now without having your face in the way?", a girl from Ravenclaw asked, looking Draco through narrowed eyes.
Harry opened the door and pulled Draco inside. He heard the others jumping up from the sofa and they stormed into the hallway.
"I mean, I love how you paint.", Harry said and kissed Draco, "And some rooms are too dark and black, so when you would paint on them, it would be a lot more beautiful."
Harry let himself fall on the sofa next to Ron and Hermione, who threw each other a strange look as Harry said these words.
He walked out smirking. On his way to his room, he passed many students in the corridors standing in groups and talking and laughing. Every time Draco passed them, Draco earned cold looks.
As he had imagined, a pack of witches came running towards him just before he turned the corner to his street. They must have come from Diagon Alley, because they had bags that Harry immediately recognized as Madam Malkin's.
As soon as Harry heard what he had said, he cleared his perfectly empty throat and corrected himself: "I mean to us."
Potter started moaning and Draco moved faster. He slapped Potter again, what made him groan even louder. Draco stopped.
"Um..." He replied confused. Draco never asked for how his friends felt. He wanted to be asked and when he was, he didn't want to answer because Draco didn't like to talk about his feelings.
Draco took a breath, and then he surged forward and swiped his tongue into Potter's mouth, curling his hand around the back of Potter's neck, into his hair. Draco felt heat shooting through his body like ink through water. Potter grabbed him by the shirt and grunted softly, and the sound ached in him, squeezing him simultaneously in the chest and the groin.
The music in the background supported the deep voice of Blaise and the high voice of Pansy singing "Or a man who makes potions in a traveling show."
Harry looked down at his hands that were currently fumbling with his own shirt. "I don't want you to feel bad or anything. I just... I'm sick of fighting."
Malfoy rolled his eyes, but started walking. Following Malfoy, Harry couldn't stop staring at his back. The shirt was so tight, that Harry could see Malfoy's well-toned muscles every time he moved his arms. This was- how- why? Why did Harry notice this? And why couldn't he just take his eyes off him? Was it the kiss they had before? On second thought, Harry was sure it was the kiss. It had been amazing and Harry didn't even dare to deny it.
"I don't want you to do this with anyone else.", Potter said, his voice sounded throaty and it made Draco's stomach clench with arousal.
After half an hour of flying around and enjoying the feeling - Hermione didn't - they touched back down on the ground in the middle of London. The pub that Hermione and Ron have rented was already filled with people, but just crowded enough for Harry to be comfortable.
Before he could decide what would be the best to do now, he heard someone punching against the wall inside the room. He peeked inside again.
"You're being very rude again. Sneaking into my bed to molest me.", Draco accused, even as he rubbed his nose against Potter's. The nose was cold, too.
It was always difficult for him to start this conversation, but someone needs to start. Malfoy shook his head and Harry understood that Malfoy didn't want to talk tonight. He hadn't talked every night when they sat together, sometimes just Harry spoke.
This time neither Hermione nor Ron said a word. They just looked at each other, but Harry knew they thought it was very mature of him and he also knew that Hermione was secretly very proud of him. Harry raised his lemonade up to his mouth to hide his smile.
Harry nodded slowly. He wasn't sure if he wanted to do something with Malfoy if he would have to get rid of Ron every time, just to they wouldn't fight. But on the other hand, Harry too had been like that not long ago.
Malfoy didn't answer and shook his head. Harry saw Malfoy looking at him for a second, but before Harry could look back, Malfoy's glance was back at Ron.
As the weeks of November crept past them, Harry felt more and more like Malfoy was there to stay. He really got along with Ron and Teddy and as Luna has been here a lot, he got along with her as well - Luna got along with practically everyone, that was the beauty of her. In the middle of November it started to get very cold and they had to take out their winter coats. Harry and Ron were getting more and more excited with every week closer to the holidays.
And the story began with this song, and the story ended with this song. Harry never felt more comfortable than in Draco's arms while they were dancing. And so, Harry had the happiest birthday ever.
"Um- I... Do you want to go to the ball with me?", Harry asked, taking a breath between every single word.
Harry and Teddy took the lift to Level 2, Teddy was allowed to press the button. On the way to his cubicle, Harry was greeted by a lot of fellow Ministry workers and some Aurors. Kingsley wasn't in his cubicle at the time, so Harry went straight to his and grabbed the stack of papers on his desk. He sat Teddy on the desk while he packed the papers into his bag and they left the Aurors headquarters again. As they already were on Level 2, Harry decided to drop by Mr Weasley's office and say a quick hello.
"Malfoy," Potter said softly. Draco looked at him, their faces were very close, so that their noses almost touched. "I don't want to freak you out."
nice, even after all that we went through. You are the most amazing person I know and I'm not even kidding. I love you. And all I would have to go through is worth it. I would take a thousand Stunning Spells to my chest."
But Harry insisted, so Malfoy gave in and accepted a pair of Harry's very own socks. Harry knew Malfoy could have just used a drying spell, but it seemed as though Malfoy didn't have such a problem with having to wear Harry's socks. And he had to admit, Malfoy looked really cute in Harry's red woollen socks that were a little too big for him. They sat on the couch in the living room as the sun slowly set. Harry turned on the lights and suggested they could watch a movie, but Malfoy didn't like the idea.
Draco knew he just wanted to help, but somehow all Draco felt was pure jealously. He knew that Potter loved him and didn't like Weaselette anymore, but some part of his brain always screamed the opposite. He sighed.
"It was you.", he said. Potter looked him in the eyes, didn't blink, didn't breathe... didn't leave.
"Of course I will.", he said happily and Draco was pleased to see his eyes lighting like that. He kissed Potter on his cheek.
But he didn't finish the sentence. And he didn't take another step. He stood completely still as if he was frozen. Potter didn't ask what was wrong, he looked up and spotted the boy Draco grew to hate over night.
He pulled out his mobile phone from his jacket and walked back to the table where he sat down next to Malfoy so they can both look at the phone.
"So am I, Harry.", Hermione said, "You got the dragon by nerve, but I'm not sure if that's going to be enough this time."
Neville was just glad he hadn't seen Malfoy during breakfast or lunch or dinner or anytime else. If he would see Malfoy, he would just punch the living hell out of him. Neville knew since the war he sometimes couldn't hold himself back - especially not when someone attacked Harry. No one, really
Feeling light on their feet, Harry and Ron made their way through London's streets, not bothered by the little rain. They stopped by Weasley's Wizards Wheezes on their way home and checked in with George as the rain outside intensified. Harry and Ron ran back to their house and shook their hair like dogs when they came inside.
"Pansy is coming right out." Hermione said when Malfoy looked through the crowd nervously. "She was right behind me."
Harry looked at him. What was going on here? He waited a long time, until he touched Malfoy carefully at his shoulders.
Draco woke up early this morning. Potter was still asleep, so Draco grabbed his school robes and tip-toed into the bathroom.
It was a Broomstick Servicing Kit and high-quality Quidditch gloves. This must have cost a fortune. Harry hugged Draco tightly. He got Malfoy a stack of
Potter bit his lips and Draco looked back up to the green eyes, that weren't looking at his own eyes anymore, Potter was also checking Draco out. His eyes darted from Draco's lips to his neatly combed and geled hair to his hands with the thin, long fingers, to Draco's...
"Nothing about making our lives miserable at school? Nothing about allowing Death Eaters to kill Dumbledore? Nothing about our families?
When the champions and their partners reached the table, Harry looked at Draco. They smiled at each other and once again, Harry got this strange feeling in his stomach.
Harry and Ron laughed and rolled their eyes. Hermione hugged both of them and then asked them to do the dishes. Both of them obeyed with laughter.
"Because you actually think that I will let you get into something more comfortable," Potter answered grinning.
"I come along on my own, thanks.", Draco answered annoyed. He lifted his shirt a bit to see where the curse had hit him.
"No," Harry cut Hermione off and tried to keep his voice down so he wouldn't wake Teddy, "If he wants to make amends he has to do it right. Not just showing up after weeks only because it suits him. And not storming away furiously when he hears Ginny would be a pleasant start, too."
Minerva was on her way to the hospital wing to visit Harry Potter. It was very important to her to come in twice a week to see if Potter was alright. When Minerva opened the doors, Madame Pomfrey immediately came running to her.
"As a matter of fact, I do. You might not believe it, but I was hated too, you know? By the whole school, and not only the Slytherins. In my second year everyone assumed I was the heir of Slytherin and went around petrifying people."
It was strange. During the war, Draco had used to talk to himself sometimes, so he didn't feel all alone, but every now and then it just came back. Although, Draco still felt alone.
"I love you, Potter, because you make me feel strong. I thought I wouldn't have anyone anymore, but despite all of the things we went through, you were there for me and loved me anyway. You are the most generous person I have ever known, you are kind, loving and honest. You make me want to be a better person. I vow to support you in everything you do, I vow to honor you and care for you and I vow to be true and faithful till our last day. We wasted so many years, but I don't want to waist another minute."
Harry grinned. Seamus - an openly gay man - danced with Goyle (who slimmed down a lot). Harry pulled Draco closer again and they kept dancing.
As Draco got two staples of food, he marched up to the hospital. Potter was still laying on his bed as he had done the last day.
Draco smiled. He rolled to his back again and closed his eyes. Harry watched Draco with a smile on his face. Draco was the most beautiful person on this earth. In the dim green light, that came from outside through the curtains, Draco looked like a prince. A strand of his silvery hair fell over his cheek, his pale skin was clean and so soft.
Harry suddenly felt like he had a panic attack. He breathed heavily and his mind was racing. How should he say this? No matter what words he will use, Malfoy will say no. What will happen if he says no? Even more important, what if he says
Harry happily did so. He filled his plate with everything available. Harry was amazed by the delicious food his two friends had prepared. Even the guacamole Harry usually didn't like was absolutely delicious.
They waited in the entrance hall for the others. After a while, Dean and Seamus joined them, holding hands and laughing.
Malfoy laughed. It was an amazing sound, even though it sounded as though he didn't laugh very often.
Malfoy nodded and drank from his lemonade. This was weird. This was a very weird situation. The two of them - Harry Potter and Draco Malfoy - sitting together in a pub and talking like they haven't hated each other for seven years. And completely sober at that.
"Malfoy!" Someone shouted from the hall to the boy's dormitories. "Malfoy!" Draco recognized the voice to be Longbottom's.
Hours passed. Harry was deep in conversation with Malfoy. Every now and then neither one knew what to say, so they just sipped their drinks and stared out the window. But the times they
Potter's chest was bare, and he closed his eyes and moaned as Draco's fingers skimmed over his stomach.
Harry couldn't speak. He was suddenly frozen, his eyes fixed on Malfoy. Malfoy had his hands in his pockets and Harry guessed he was probably fumbling with a pack of cigarettes.
Harry's face got red and his cheeks started burning. In anger, he turned around and slammed his fists against the wall. He heard Malfoy breathing heavily. Harry turned around.
Draco seemed so scared of the thought that Harry could die in every task, that's laying ahead. Harry smiled encouragingly and lay his hand on Draco's cheek.
Harry smiled. He pulled Malfoy's face down to his and kissed him. "You are amazing," he said and smiled, Malfoy smiled as well.
Harry let his legs slide down against Draco's, as if he was just getting comfortable, but Draco let out a small sound and shifted on the bed, so that their hips brushed together for a moment. Harry's heart was jittering in his chest, but his erection was rock solid. He had no idea what he was going to do. He looked at Draco, who looked as nervous as Harry felt.
The sun was already shining brightly and the birds outside were singing loudly. Harry took a deep, satisfied breath and closed his eyes again for a moment - just to let this beautiful moment sink in before it would end. And it would end, because Harry shifted slightly, so he could look at Malfoy without turning his head in an uncomfortable position. Malfoy made a sleepy grunting noise and slightly rubbed his head against Harry's shoulder, so Harry could feel the soft blond hair against his cheek. And then Malfoy finally opened his eyes - at first very slowly and tiredly. Then Malfoy closed his eyes again and when he tried to rub them with his hand, he opened them again widely and stared at his one hand in Harry's and his other hand gripping Harry's arm.
"I'm going to be with Ron in the common room. When you've come to your senses, come and sit with us," Hermione said.
"I'll see you soon, little buddy." Harry, too, told him and played a little with his hair that turned as black as Harry's.
It was a hot day in July and even though Harry wore only a T-shirt and shorts he immediately started sweating. He pulled out his sunglasses and exchanged them with the glasses already on his nose.
"Only that you're in love with someone. Come on, Harry. I'm your best friend. Don't you think I noticed you walking around like happily ever after? Tell me. Is it Ginny?", she asked excitedly.
Over the next weeks, wedding preparations were in order. Unfortunately, Hermione and the others couldn't be there because school had started again, but they helped all they could through post. Hagrid had been all over the place when Harry had told him about the proposal and promised Harry he would come to the wedding under any circumstances. What Hagrid didn't know was the biggest advantage it had being Harry Potter - they were going to have their wedding at Hogwarts, in the middle of the school year, with everyone attending.
"My hands are cold. I'm trying to warm them up.", Potter said, his face the picture of innocence, complete with a blush. He shrugged.
"The war is over, won by Harry Potter, lost by Voldemort." was the first sentence of this article. Draco thought it was such a development that now the Dark Lord's name is even standing in the newspaper. Voldemort. Draco kept reading.
"Talk with professor McGonnagal?" Hermione asked and Harry knew exactly what was coming next. "Are you in trouble? Why did you have to talk with McGonnagal? What's wrong?"
Draco thought it was very important that he was there, he was Potter's partner now and he was the only one Potter was going to see constantly over the next few days while he would be on bedrest. Maybe Potter's friends thought so too, or maybe they just didn't want to upset Draco because they knew how he could be when he was upset.
He threw the empty glass on the street just before they rounded the corner to Harry's house. Harry groaned loudly.
It had been a little over two months since the end of the war and Harry, Ron and Hermione have moved in together in a small house near Diagon Alley. He quite liked the flat, it was right between their two worlds - the Leaky Cauldron only five minutes by foot and the Muggle world just in front of their doorstep.
awkward. But the fact that Harry laughed seemed to ease Malfoy up, because he put the glass down and didn't go back to rubbing his knees. Harry looked around the room, trying to figure out what they could do.
Harry groaned annoyed, grabbed his bag and left the classroom. Hermione and Ron waited in front of the door for him.
Draco buried his face in Potter's shoulder and smiled. He inhaled the smell of Potter's school robe, in which he looked like a messy little child. His tie was loose, his hair was as ruffled as ever and his robe hung down on one shoulder.
"Yeah. To understand your stupid family better.", Draco answered unimpressed and finally turned around.
Granger stuck her head inside the room. "Can I come in?" She asked and Draco nodded while rolling his eyes. She closed the door behind herself and smiled sadly when she saw Draco sitting all alone on his bed, wand in his hand and crumbs of potato in his lap.
Indeed, he and Draco had already talked about this. Draco hated his home. There were so many childhood memories he just wanted to forget but to keep living in this house wouldn't accelerate that.
"Glorious.", Harry smiled, but Malfoy didn't react as he had thought he would. He barely smiled, but looked rather serious.
Pansy had wanted to persuade Draco to leave as well, but now she accepted it and had stopped arguing. Draco really wanted to stay and finish his N.E.W.T.s. And besides, he didn't want the battle to be the finale goodbye between him and Potter. He wanted to say goodbye properly, because after they leave Hogwarts they will never see each other again.
Harry sighed. He buried his face in his hands. What was happening? The two Slytherins sat down each on one side of Harry.
They danced and sang and danced a little more. Just after Theo had opened a bottle of champagne on the stage, Harry and Draco walked over to him.
They talked for a while until their food came floating through the restaurant and placed itself in front of them. And for a short moment there was silence as everyone ate their first bite. The silence left again and Ron told them a story about Seamus from back at Hogwarts - a story everyone remembered.
"Harry, how's Malfoy when you are in your room?" Dean asked. Harry shrugged. He didn't feel like answering the question.
The last time Harry had been in here was after the Battle - many months ago. Harry kept the door open as he took a long look at the portraits on the walls. Professor Dumbledore, the late Headmaster of Hogwarts, sat on a beautiful chair and smiled at Harry with the familiar smile Harry had missed so much.
Draco stepped out and hoped that Potter wouldn't notice him, but he did. He turned around and opened his mouth to say something, but the second he saw Draco's "clothing", he closed his mouth again.
He had caramel-brown eyes and short brown hair. His uniform was just on point, the tie a bit loose. Harry looked at him for a long time. The boy had full pink lips, that he constantly bit out of nervousness.
They climbed outside and walked down the hallway, where a few students crossed their way. Especially the girls shot Draco dark looks. Harry looked at Draco with a sad look. In front of the Hall, Draco stopped.
They both moaned louder as they felt each others erection pressing into their own, their breathing speed up and body heat engulfing them.
Harry just couldn't believe how much had happened since he had met Malfoy for the first time. Back then Malfoy had been an intimidating little boy offering Harry his friendship. And as the years went by, Harry had grown to hate that boy who made his life and his friends' lives miserable. Until finally, in sixth year, he had disappointed Harry the most.
While the sponge scrubbed the sink, Harry heard the bell ring. He looked at his watch and realised Molly was a few hours early.
At first there was slight resistance from Malfoy, but then Harry felt his lips loosen and his body relaxing and Malfoy slowly opened his lips, allowing Harry's tongue to slip in. Harry's heart was beating fast and the sound of the rain filled his ears. He forgot that he was soaked, because all he cared about was that he was kissing Draco Malfoy and that Draco Malfoy kissed him back!
"Well, can I help you with something here, Matt?" Harry asked and looked at the timetable Matt was holding in his hands. His nails weren't bitten like Harry's, but they were smoothly cut.
"Madame Pomfrey told Hermione that I can leave tomorrow. My condition has improved significantly, to say it with her words.", Harry answered.
Harry's heart stopped, he slowly turned back around and hoped Malfoy wouldn't have his wand at the ready.
"I thought we'd go tomorrow." Hermione said, "Then we have the last two days before your birthday to prepare everything."
"I thought he just hid there. I didn't want him to be dead and I still don't. He was the only family I had left. He was
It was just after nine o'clock when Hermione came back home. She smiled when she saw that Harry and Malfoy were still sitting on the couch.
Malfoy only nodded without saying a word. Harry walked into the living room where Ron and Hermione packed their bags, but Malfoy didn't follow right away. When he stepped into the living room, there was a clear tension between all of them.
"Draco, what does it cost? One thousand Galleons?", Harry asked and Draco looked at the price shield.
"Hermione asked me if I would join her to go to the library and then get some fresh air. Even when I told her I'm going to be with you, she insisted on me coming and said, I could bring you as well.", Harry told Draco.
"What is it?", he asked. Potter couldn't speak. His mouth stood open and he breathed in and out. What was it???
"I just want to say I'm sorry. To all of you. For all that I've done." Malfoy said, "For that hippogriff..." Harry couldn't believe Draco remembered Buckbeak, "for trying to jinx each one of you, for the
"P-", Draco attempted to speak Harry's name, but Harry have him no chance. He kept kissing Draco, wrapped his tongue around Draco's and thrust his fingers in Draco's hair.
Food piled up on the golden plates in front of them and Harry and Ron did as they were told - they dug in deep.
Something was still missing. A small part of his brain screamed Potter, but it was impossible to go back now. Potter would scream at Draco and Draco would start crying like he did before.
Harry carefully got up, Teddy still in his arms. They all sat down at the table and ate while Harry still slowly rocked Teddy back and forth.
"Well they almost broke up, that's what happened," Potter answered and Draco could hear the anger in his voice.
"Neither Draco nor Dobby said something. I was surprised myself.", Harry added, as Hermione and Ron looked at each other with surprised faces.
"I've never been here before but I've heard from a couple of witches that it's very good." Mrs Malfoy said and opened the doors.
Granger put the letter down and briefly looked at the others, then at Draco who held his breath excitedly.
After that, the hours strolled past them like nothing. Malfoy didn't say a single word when his mother didn't talk to him directly. And he just pretended he hadn't heard Harry talking to him even though Harry could see in his eyes he had heard Harry very clearly. After they had finished dessert and after Narcissa had paid, they stood up and left the restaurant. It was already dark outside.
When he pulled away, he smiled, a smile that made his eyes lighten up and Draco fell safe. Safe and loved.
He had a beautiful handwriting. Draco wrote, that he missed his mother and thanked her for these nice words. He didn't address his father specifically. He wrote, that he was sorry to tell his mother, but he wasn't coming home over summer, because he had found someone better, who would like to have him in company. As he wrote these words, Harry smiled. At the end, he wrote:
Neville noticed him staggering and Malfoy stumbled. "I'm so sorry!" Malfoy cried out and Neville could hear how hard it was for him to lift and control his tongue.
Hermione just laughed and waved off. Harry rolled his eyes and sighed. He felt like he could fall asleep right there and then, but he was going to keep himself awake for Ron and Hermione's sake, even though his eyes were repeatedly falling shut. Hermione shoved the plate with Harry's toast towards him and as he looked up, he saw her begging eyes. He slightly shook his head, but Hermione's gaze remained firm.
"See you in twenty minutes, right here.", Draco said, before the Slytherins set off for the dungeons.
Since his friends weren't here anymore and since everyone hated him, Draco liked it to sit alone. He didn't really love it, but it was still better than sitting with some idiot. Speaking of idiot, Potter entered the classroom, his eyes hushed in Draco's direction and he sat down next to his stupid two friends.
"And because of that I had dreams about Voldemort and Malfoy, Bellatrix Lestrange and you, Hermione." Harry paused shortly to see Hermione's reaction - she, too, put down her fork and looked at him with sad eyes. "And Sirius."
Malfoy's eyes glistened in the colorful light in the pub. He smiled handsomely and Harry felt like he could drown in those steel grey eyes.
"So, I've finished. I guess I'll be going home, then." Malfoy said and clapped his hands together with a satisfied look.
"Mate, you're not busy are you?", Ron asked and stormed into the room without knocking or announcing himself. Harry laughed as Hermione slapped Ron's shoulder.
"Dear child, the original book is in the office of the headmistress." The woman told Hermione and her eyes immediately lit up.
Harry and Hermione put their snacks into the kitchen where Mrs Weasley's stew was already cooking on the stove. When they came back, the room silenced immediately. Harry excused himself and went to the toilet. Before he could stop it, hot tears streamed down his face. Not because he was sad, but because he was frustrated. It made him so mad that he didn't have a clue what was going on with everyone. Harry slapped himself on the cheek, quickly washed his face and went back out.
They followed Mrs Weasley into the living room, where the other members of the family sat. Bill, the eldest of the Weasley-children, must have cut his flaming red hair since the war, because it didn't seem to have grown any longer at all, while his wife Fleur was as beautiful as ever. George sat with his girlfriend Anglina in an armchair and got up to hug Harry and Ron. Sure, all of them were still mourning Fred's death, but it was clear that George took it hardest - after all, Fred has been his better half. That was why Harry hugged George very tight every time they saw each other, this time as well. George smiled at Harry as they let go of each other again - a thankful yet sad smile. Harry greeted Angelina, Bill and Fleur as well, when Mrs Weasley came back to tell Ginny she should help her in the kitchen.
The sudden look on Potter's face hurt Draco so bad. He looked betrayed and hurt and guilty. "Why?" He asked and Draco noticed his fingers were trembling as he took them away from the doorknob.
And they took their suitcases and left as fast as their little legs could carry them. The whole wagon was laughing now and everyone made their way back to their own compartments. Blaise and Draco sat down and Blaise was still laughing.
"Harry is helping us and your father and you will do well to be grateful." Narcissa told him sternly.
Harry grinned and grabbed Draco's hand. They walked out of the Hall and Harry dragged Draco up to Gryffindor tower. Draco smiled nervously, as Harry named the password and the portrait hole opened. Harry climbed inside, followed by Draco. The common room was empty, only illuminated by a few single torches. Draco looked around.
He was going to eat in the kitchen. What does it matter when he wondered where Malfoy was? He had been so strange this morning already and Harry was only curious. He opened the door to the kitchens and stepped in.
The librarian looked at him with a frown on her face and then went back to her notebook. Draco shook his head and walked over to the books about Muggles.
Harry sat down on the armchair next to the one Mr Malfoy sat on before. Draco's father grabbed the glass of wine, that stood on the black piano and took a sip. He sat down next to Harry and looked at him with a dangerous look in his eyes.
"Not much," Draco said and wanted to end the conversation with this, but then he thought that maybe it wouldn't hurt to talk a bit. "I've been studying a lot lately, haven't done much else," Draco added. He wanted to tell Blaise more, but he didn't want the others to know more. They sat there, staring curiously at Draco.
Harry laughed too. He wanted to talk about Draco with them, but he knew that Draco wouldn't like it. And to be honest, there was nothing to talk about. He and Draco weren't in a relationship or something and you
With this, Draco walked away and left the three boys sitting around the fire, one more confused than the other.
Harry noticed that Malfoy was fumbling with the hem of his shirt and thought this might be a sign of nervousness. When Malfoy didn't talk, Harry decided he should break the ice.
Harry tangled his fingers into Draco's wonderful soft hair and pulled him closer. Harry's heart was beating so fast and loud, he thought Draco could feel, or even hear it. They broke away from each other.
Again, Weasley furrowed his brow, but he didn't say anything. Granger looked like she already knew where this was going. She had a corner of a smile on her face and her cheeks reddened.
He looked at the Muggles curiously and Harry found it highly amusing to see his boyfriend like this. He was like a little child that went for the first time to the zoo.
Potter nodded understanding and Draco smiled. "What are you smiling at?" Potter asked and furrowed his brow.
They went upstairs where an old damaged bed and an old couch stood. Potter sat down on the couch. Draco sat down next to him.
"Mother, we don't need Potter's help. At least he was the one who even made sure that father got locked up."
"Yeah you just keep telling yourself that." Theo stepped closer and pulled out the same pullover Draco had held before. "That's fine." Theo said, "Throw in a watch and some good shoes and you're good to go."
Harry looked after him, rounding a corner and vanishing out of sight. Harry didn't need his pillow no to scream into.
The attempts had went on, what made Draco very uncomfortable. He didn't feel the need to tell Potter why he was angry at him because if Potter couldn't find out himself he was just not worth it.
Ron was right. Things with Malfoy were definitely moving into that direction where Harry would eventually have to face his mother.
Mrs. Baker was about forty years old and Harry thought she always dressed nicely. Her husband, Mr. Baker, was a few years older than her but didn't look like it. They didn't have children, so they were pretty happy when they'd found that Harry, Ron and Hermione moved in next to them. The neighbors had a quite good relationship, after all they shared a fence.
He saw Malfoy's lips stretch into a smile as well and Harry hugged Draco really tight. Harry closed his eyes now as well, but when he felt Draco shifting next to him, he opened them again. Draco whispered "
"Harry, look at that!" She said loudly and looked like a little child who had just dropped its ice cream.
He had the complete wrong idea of what Draco was going to do. Draco grabbed both of Potter's wrists with his right hand and pinned them against the wall above Potter's head. Potter was struggling to get out of Draco's grip.
Someone tapped on Draco's shoulder and Draco froze. He slowly turned his head around to see Potter staring at him with piercing green eyes. Potter furrowed his brow as Draco stood back up from where he had crouched.
Hermione must have noticed Malfoy's helpless look, so she asked smiling. Malfoy then found the courage to nod and get up. He whipped out his wand in the kitchen just like Hermione and Harry did, and together they sliced fruit and bread with magic and Hermione set the table outside.
Harry saw the chance and kissed him softly on his collar bone. Harry pressed his body against Draco's and their cocks were drifting together. Harry sucked at the pale skin at Draco's collar bone and bit gently. Draco moaned loudly, Harry didn't know whether it was because of his sucking or because of the incredible feeling of their groins rubbing together.
Harry looked around, watched a few healers wandering from one room to another with clipboards in their hands. Some witches and wizards were brought in and some out, some in wheelchairs, some on stretchers and some by foot. One wizard had a horrible rash on his left arm and as he left the room a few minutes later, the rash had already gone back for maybe around fifty percent. After all these years Harry still was amazed by the power the wizarding world had.
After a few minutes, Draco stood up and walked over to the three new first years. He looked down at them.
It was short before midnight and Draco pulled on his slippers. He closed the door to their room behind himself and sneaked downstairs.
Harry stood up and walked the way back to the room, while Narcissa went downstairs again. Harry sat down on the soft bed with green silky blankets. On the wall hung a banner of Slytherin. Draco's closet was made of dark wood and looked very nobel. Harry hesitated, then stood up. He opened the doors of the closed and was a bit surprised. There were only black suits, shirts and jeans in there, but one colourful clothing. It was Draco's Quidditch robe. Harry closed the doors again and looked around. Behind the slightly green curtains were two glass doors and Harry opened them. Draco had a
Harry put his pyjama on the cupboard and took his clothes out of Malfoy's hands. Harry stepped closer. He couldn't believe what was about to happen, but he felt strong and confident. He wanted to make Draco feel as safe as he did, so he cupped Draco's face with both his hands and smiled. Malfoy's eyes fluttered shut as Harry bent closer and kissed him. Sparks flew inside his stomach and his lips felt electrified. The kiss got very intense very quickly. Harry had to catch a breath every now and then, but Draco almost wouldn't let him. They stumbled towards the door and Harry felt something in his pants when Draco pinned him against the door and pushed against him with his body.
It was quiet for a while, then Lucius stood up. Harry pulled his head back hastily, hoping not to be seen. As Mr Malfoy spoke again, he looked in.
"Oh nothing, nothing," Blaise answered nonchalantly and gasped, "Just something one of the Hufflepuff's told me. It was hilarious!" And Blaise started laughing again. Draco smiled a convulsive and sad smile and leaned his head on his arm.
So Draco tried to lift his arm from Potter's torso as carefully as possible so he wouldn't wake him up. Potter's lip twitched and Draco froze, but the Gryffindor stayed sound asleep. Draco breathed out relieved and slowly sat up, while watching Potter's face. When Draco got on his feet and Potter still hadn't woken up, Draco sneaked behind the curtain, lit up his wand and was ready to leave the hospital wing. Madame Pomfrey shot up when she heard Draco walking by, but when the light of his wand illuminated his face, she breathed out, nodded and sent him on. Draco had to be careful he didn't get caught, because students weren't allowed out of bed at this time. Luckily, he made it to the common room without crossing anyone's path.
