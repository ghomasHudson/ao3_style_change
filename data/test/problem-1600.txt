This was the most frightened he had been since he was seventeen, and he truly hadn’t realised there were still people with this amount of venom in their hearts.
Draco held onto Harry fiercely, hiding his face on his chest and crying, crying until his voice got hoarse and his eyes sting. He didn't know what to do with his life now, and he really didn't want to make a decision.
Feeling full and happy, she turned to Harry, fingers still a little bit sticky.
The next thing that happened came as a complete surprise to Draco. Harry crawled down over his body, and gently sucked the head of Draco’s cock into his mouth.
“Just my hand,” Harry agreed, stroking his fingertips all over Draco’s warm thighs. She felt wonderful, plush and sexy and Harry felt incredibly turned on.
Harry resisted the urge to kiss Draco, not wanting to transfer even the smallest amount of aftershave onto him.
“Ummm... This is lovely, Draco.” Harry whispered. “We should do this more often, just us together.”
Harry gave Draco’s nipple a quick, tight little squeeze and moved his hand down to his husband’s belly. Harry loved that it was softer, that he could actually feel how much Draco had loved Venice.
It was a nice feeling, Harry's hand on Draco's shoulder. Physical comfort wasn't something Draco was accustomed to but very much craved. Draco just simply nodded and drank some more of his whiskey, downing the glass and pouring himself another. Many emotions swirled through his mind, he'd hoped some things wouldn't return but they had. He pushed them away and tried to enjoy his evening.
Draco nodded and mumbled something about being somewhere else before walking away. Harry smiled and tried his best not to start laughing again before he made his way into his rooms to get started on his lesson plan.
*********
Draco rushed over and snatched his journal from his desk, throwing it in the general direction of his bedroom "Excuse you, that's private" he hissed.
Typical, that card always made an appearance when Luna read about Harry's past. Harry made a face and Luna chuckled, giving his hand a squeeze "I don't need to tell you again how you need to stop repressing your problems and acting impulsively to distract yourself" she said.
By the time dinner came around Harry felt ten tonnes lighter, he wasn't in this alone and he was far more prepared than he had been yesterday. Being a professor was much less intimidating when he had a mentor. If you had told him 6 years ago that he would be thinking of Severus Snape as a mentor he would have thought you were insane.
Draco bit his lip, Merlin that didn't help make things less confusing. "Wait, I actually... I need some help with a part of the N.E.W.Ts that I'm having trouble understanding. Would you mind helping me?" he asked, Harry knew he should say no but... He couldn't, he did want to spend time with Draco.
(Harry's POV)
Silence filled the sitting room as Luna took in everything Harry had said. She placed her empty cup down on her table and leaned forward "So that's why you were so strange at breakfast" she concluded.
Harry shook his head "Don't try and change the subject, Draco" he almost purred. Flustering this man was far more fun than anything he'd done in a long time.
(Harry's POV)
Harry nodded "Well I ended up joining him on the bench and I could barely fight my urge to hold his hand, I craved his touch. Luckily I caught myself before I did anything stupid and swiftly left but it was too close. I had no idea what I was doing or feeling and it freaked me out" He explained. His chest tightened a little when he remembered what else happened that night. "In the middle of the night I was woken up by a loud crash coming from Draco's room so my instincts kicked in and I rushed over - wand in hand - when I finally got into his rooms he just stood there looking at me like I was crazy" Harry swallowed hard "Turns out the crash was all in my head, so I could no longer trust my ears as well as my eyes and mind" he said quietly.
Draco shook his head "That's not your decision to make, it never has been. All those people, and one very brave, courageous elf, didn't die because of you or even for you. They all had something to believe in and something to die for" he said gently stroking Harry's hair "Your godson's parents died so that he could grow up in a world without fear, he would have been killed before he even had a chance to live" he said.
He leaned forward a little "If I ask you something will you answer honestly" he asked.
Draco frowned, he had many questions running through his head, such as why he was here, why he said "Mischief Managed", what was he hiding. But he just settled with shaking his head and closing his eyes again enjoying the warmth and light breeze "Quite alright Potter" he said before looking at him "Sorry, Harry" he corrected.
He looked back up at Draco and smiled, he really was very attractive. And kind, much more thoughtful than Harry had even believed he could be. Draco cleared his throat and looked away, taking another sip of his drink, Harry took a breath and tried to control his thoughts.
Draco shook his head quickly and stepped forward a little more "No no absolutely not your reaction was completely understandable, I should have been more considerate" he said. He wouldn't let Harry take the blame for any of it. He'd only tried to protect him, Draco was the one in the wrong and he knew it.
Luna nodded "I think you should tell him. Tell him you're afraid, tell him you don't want to fight, just tell him" she suggested before stretching like a cat "Whatever you do just try not to self destruct" she added.
Draco smiled at him "For you, I will try to be" he said, before pressing a loving kiss on his forehead.
Draco stiffened beside him "Because I'm a death eater?" He asked, voice tight.
~~~~~~
Draco frowned "I'm sorry. I was a right arse last night" he said, rubbing the back of his neck "I get you we're just trying to help, I shouldn't have acted that way and I'm sorry" he emphasised. He wanted this apology to be sincere.
Harry walked back into the room and raised his eyebrows in surprise "We'll need some glasses and sugar cubes" Draco simply stated, sitting down on the loveseat and setting everything up.
"Of course he's always been devastatingly gorgeous, but in that moment he was glowing. He looked like an angel" he said, Harry didn't really care about being embarrassed anymore. It felt good to finally tell the truth about how he felt. To Luna and to himself. "If I'm being honest, I've always been attracted to him. Of course I never acted on it before as he was an insufferable git but now? He's different. Or maybe he's not, maybe this is the Draco Malfoy I could never see but was always there beneath the prejudice and fear" he theorised.
Merlin he looked good, his hair was just a tad messier than normal, he wore a light robe open to show a deep green button up shirt, black waistcoat and black suit trousers. Harry shook his head and regained his composure just before the blonde looked over at him.
Death - Upright
After a few minutes Harry transfigured something into a chair and sat in front of Draco. Not that he was paying attention.
Snape raised an eyebrow at Harry, he'd never heard the Gryffindor say Draco's first name before. He ignored it for now and examined his fingernails like they were far more fascinating than this conversation "I had them move me when I heard you were going to be the new Defence Against the Dark Arts professor. Someone has to make sure you don't ruin the next generation of witches and wizards" he said simply.
Harry's cheeks flushed and he bit his lip, looking back at the glass in his hand. That was stupid and impulsive, Harry definitely did not need to be drunk in front of Draco "Yes perhaps you were right" he said, placing the glass down on the table. He wasn't very intoxicated so now was probably a good stopping point.
Harry settled and Draco yawned, he walked back into his front room and curled up on the couch, using the cushion Harry had been closest to as a pillow. It smelled like him. Just as Draco was drifting off he heard sniffling and groaning from his bedroom. What the hell?
Draco choked then, on air apparently, he sputtered and struggled for words "Y-you're crazy" he stuttered, taking an uncharacteristically large swig of his absinthe, draining the rest of his glass.
Harry was soon asleep again and this time Draco stayed awake until he was sure Harry was okay. He held the man he'd become completely enthralled with and kept to his word, not leaving him for a second all night.
Harry grabbed his lesson plan on his way out and made his way to the Grand Hall for breakfast. He held back a smirk when he saw Draco already sat at the table watching Harry as he walked in.
Luna crouched next to Harry and gently wrapped her arms around him "Lets go and read the cards" she said, knowing as much as Harry denied it, he felt better when he had his tarot read. Harry had introduced Luna to the practice when he learned of her new Divination position.
Draco smiled and put his hand on Harry's cheek "Ignorant ponce" he said just as softly.
"The next day during breakfast I noticed he reacted strangely when we would call each other dear or when you'd kiss my cheek, I thought it was just because he wasn't used to affection. Then on my way back to my rooms after I helped search for your shoes I almost crashed into him and he..." Harry smiled looking down at his empty cup "He was so upset, he was jealous. I've never had someone act like that about me, it felt kinda nice" he admitted honestly. The tea had taken affect.
Luna grabbed Harry's empty tea cup and refilled it, adding another sugar cube. At the sight of the sweet shape Harry's mind instinctively went back to the feeling of Draco's arms around him, his lips on his. Merlin he wanted it. He shook his head and gathered his thoughts once more, accepting the cup and draining it easily. Luna did the same and urged Harry to continue.
He closed the door behind him and slid down the wall "What in Merlin's name am I doing?" he asked himself. He rested his head in his hands and took a few deep breaths before pulling himself together and getting up. He got into the shower and put his not so new newfound fondness for Harry down to the alcohol and the heat of the moment. Deciding that's definitely the reason he climbed into bed and put the night to an end.
Harry chuckled and shook his head "Luna what is it? What's wonderful?" he asked utterly befuddled.
Harry shook his head and waved his hand dismissively "No need, I'm of perfectly sound mind" He said, sounding completely serious.
All throughout breakfast Harry continued to talk to Neville and Hannah as usual, no one besides Luna would be able to detect a thing off about him. She didn't say anything thankfully. He snuck a glance over at Draco as everyone was discussing the upcoming term, Harry's stomach twisted at the sight of the usually glowing Slytherin. Draco looked dull, everything that made him a Malfoy had drained out of him. He was slouching and pushing his food around on his plate, he hadn't seemed to eat a thing. Maybe he was so disgusted with what Harry had done that it made him lose his apatite, he could also be hungover. Though Draco didn't seem to drink that much last night... maybe he had a low tolerance to the strange green liquor?
Draco's heart broke seeing Harry in so much pain and how much he blamed himself for everything that happened.
He felt Harry shift next to him and couldn't help but look over, Harry's eyes met his instantly, they were enchanting. So green you could swear his irises were alive. Draco swallowed hard, risky.
Harry let a sad smile spread across his face as he stared intently at the drinks in front of him "To trust you" he said, Draco fought not to flinch.
Harry allowed himself a few more minutes of his breakdown before he re-enforced his emotional walls, vigorously scrubbed himself clean - trying to be rid of the disgustingly wonderful memory of Draco's hands on him - and got himself presentable for breakfast.
Draco awoke with a start as he heard his front door slamming shut, he sat up quickly and looked around. Harry, he was gone. Did he just leave? Was he upset?
He and Ginny never had such a connection, he had thought he loved her but he'd been lying to himself, he just wanted to keep one person who loved him. He knew it was selfish and even potentially dangerous so he let her go before they got married. Harry did envy those in love but never wanted to be that vulnerable again.
Was this real?
Malfoy smiled warmly and nodded "Thank you, that is all we'll be needing" he said with an air of genuine gratitude. Harry looked at him with raised eyebrows as the house elf dissappeared with a quiet pop.
Draco nodded in agreement "Did you actually want to kiss me last night or were you just drunk?" He asked, the main question that had been burning a hole through his mind.
Draco put his now empty glass on the table and crossed his arms "You're full of it, it's not polite to joke about such things" he said.
Harry looked over, his heart ached when he realised what he'd said. He smiled apologetically and instinctively leaned a little closer to the man he'd just hurt "No Draco, you were never a death eater. Nor were you a bad person really. It's a lot to ask because you're a human. Humans are unpredictable and unstable. Trust isn't a natural instinct for a reason" he explained.
"I'm not, my tolerance to things is regretfully high" He interrupted.
Draco smirked a little "What's that look for?" He asked curiously as he handed one of the mugs to Harry.
He groaned at the sheer act of having to stand up and stumbled over to the front door. He swung it open, somehow still managing to be graceful "Can I help you?" He asked irritated before he realised who was standing in front of him. "Harry" he breathed, the name was both bitter and sweet on his tongue.
He didn't even know why he cared.
Luna crossed her legs in her chair and sipped at her own cup of tea "Everything, everything" she answered without hesitation.
Draco shook his head and took a step towards him "Why? Tell me why" he demanded, it was his turn to feel angry.
Harry hummed "Fight harder" he said simply before pulling away and grabbing the fork from the tray "Now, you have to eat" he said sternly.
Draco let out a sound from deep in his throat and wrapped his arms around Harry's waist. Harry pulled away from the kiss just a few millimetres to gasp in some air.
Luna nodded and sighed "I'm afraid they have stolen my shoes once more" she said.
Luna leaned forward eagerly "Go on" she urged.
Luna shuffled the cards, hands moving almost too quickly to see, and placed the deck face down on the coffee table. She held out one of her hands and Harry instinctively intertwined their fingers. Luna took the top card from the deck and placed it face up on the table.
Harry looked Draco in the eye and now he could see how raw Harry's pain was "Everyone I love either dies or worse. I'm a curse, a plague, leaving death and destruction in my wake" he said tears streaming down his cheeks "I'm not the saviour, I couldn't save anyone I cared about. Not my parents, not Sirius, not Cedric, or Dumbledore, or Fred, not Dobby, or Lupin, or Tonks. How am I supposed to tell my godson that his parents are dead because of me? I couldn't even save Snape" he said letting out a soft sob "Ron lost his brother, Hermione lost her parents and was tortured. I broke Ginny's heart. So many people have died and lost and been hurt because of me. I can't let that happen again" he said tears streaming down his face in steady rivers at this point.
They both broke out in laughter "Even if I did believe that, that's not what I meant. I just meant well... You look really rough Harry" He said, surprisingly candidly.
After a few minutes Harry pulled away and rested his forehead against Draco's "I have to go. I need to think" he said quietly.
Harry opened his eyes and was about to ask why when he remembered what she had said yesterday "I have to be the one to discover it" He quoted.
"Good morning everyone, today's topic of training is N.E.W.T.S and O.W.L.S. Training will start at 2pm sharp right here, in the mean time you are free to get reacquainted with the castle and start on this terms lesson plans" Minerva said. After she dismissed everyone Luna took Harry's hand and lead him out of the hall to begin looking for her shoes. Harry snickered seeing Draco react the same way when he saw Luna hold Harry's hand.
Draco flinched back from the door, what? They were on good terms weren't they? Did something happen while Draco was asleep?
When Harry saw Draco sat in the courtyard eyes closed and moonlight shining off all the harsh angles of his face Harry was awestruck at how beautiful Draco really was. Admittedly Harry had always thought Draco was an attractive man, as he matured he never lost the angelic glow he has when he smiles. He suspected that's why he got away with whatever he wanted, but he'd never seen Draco like this, completely at peace and serene. He felt incredibly ridiculous that he'd been worried. The war was over, he wasn't an auror anymore, not everything was a threat.
Draco chuckled and kissed Harry's forehead "Bring it on Potter" he said.
Harry nodded and sat down next to Draco on the bench. He couldn't deny that being this close to Harry made his hair stand on end and goosebumps raise along his skin. There was always this static electricity between the two of them, Draco had always tried to tell himself it was because of his "intense hatred" for Harry but he always knew there was a far deeper meaning to it. He and Harry have always had a strange connection, like magnets. He never let himself think on it too much before, due to fear, but it was always there.
"Stop it" a male voice echoed through the room, or through Harry's head. Perhaps both.
Harry glared at him a little more intensely before beginning to walk away broom in hand.
Draco rolled his eyes at the behaviour, his mother would be appalled, gentlemen opened the door for a visitor. He opened the door to see Harry sat on a plush dark green love seat in the front room staring into the fire. Draco cleared his throat and took a small step inside
(Harry's POV)
Harry's heart dropped when the full reality of the situation fell on him. He jumped away from Draco as if his touch burned him "Sorry" he mumbled. He wanted to keep holding him, he wanted Draco to hold him too. He wanted Draco to kiss him and love him and make everything better.
He shoved Harry away from himself and moved back to touch his back to the headboard. In one swift move, he held the elastic of his pants and took it off.
Starting with the soft licks to the nipples, Harry then experimented using his teeth in small nipping bites. He squeezed them just a touch, for despite Draco’s words he didn’t want to hurt him.
"Let me be honest here, Harry. I never scented someone so compatible with me as you. I never dreamed about someone as I dream about you. And I've met plenty hot alphas. It's
Grabbing Draco by the hands, he placed the ends of his fingers on his dark brown nipples, onto the solid muscle of his hard chest.
It didn’t surprise him really. Harry loved Narcissa, and how much she had always cared for Draco. But she was a terribly standoffish lady sometimes, and everything she ate was the size of a knut.
daughter off that woman too... And yes, I did need space tonight, because
“I’ll stop you now before you moan about my inferior healing skills. I know you were hurting and too proud to say so.”
Although Draco was all about showing the Muggle world to Jasmine, since she was a half-blood's child after all, she decided to bring her to a magical park that day. It was pretty much just like a Muggle park, but the parents didn't have to hide their wands if a kid scrapped their knee or if they wanted to protect them a little better on the swings.
“Going to come Draco... Can’t wait any longer... Can I come on you, mess up your perfect hot fucking body?”
And wasn’t hard to worship Draco. He was so slick and ready; Harry had no question that he’d knot Draco if they were to have sex. It was a startlingly intimate act, but Harry really felt the urge...
Of course they were everywhere. The press wouldn't stop talking about them. Rita Skeeter would write about how amazing Harry was for forgiving a
The reception was perfect, which Harry knew was entirely his husbands doing, and the afternoon seemed to pass in a daze of congratulations, wonderful music and dancing. At the end of the evening he held his beloved in his arms, he hands curled round Draco’s hips, his fingers straying to rest on the curve of his pert backside.
Then, he took off his shoes, socks and his trousers. Now, he was only wearing his laced lingerie, a delicate necklace with a tear shaped diamond between his clavicles.
Harry felt like his soul was dissolving, and like his whole body was on fire. He knew that he’d  never be able to describe this moment properly; never truly be able to explain the way his blood was coursing through his body and his pheromones were sparking under his skin.
In this chapter, Draco will question their gender identity and come to terms of who they are.
Taking Draco’s swollen nub in his mouth, Harry bit lightly, rolling Draco’s dark nipple on his tongue. Hard and pebbled, it filled Harry’s mouth beautifully and he sighed around it, moaning joyfully.
I woke up in a hospital bed. I looked around frantically before realizing i was in the infirmary of hogwarts.
" because, ron asked for you." I took off my cloak and had it in my hands now.
" of course. SOMEONE needs to be the mature parent." She rolled her eyes at ron. As they had a mini argument in the train station, Harry's mind wandered.
" cormac." I let out before i could even think what i was saying.
" but-"
She hugged harry tighter than anybody had before and wouldnt let go.
" shouldn't we get up?" Harry asked.
—————-
Harry hummed suspiciously.
She and hermione left the room and just left me and harry. I rubbed harrys back and brought the bucket over.
I took a shower and grabbed my best robes. I knew ronald might not have something to wear tonight so i just grabbed all my options. Before i left I remembered what he said, to bring draco. So on the way i popped into dracos house, grabbed him, and we left. We arrived at grimmauld place around 6:30.
" if only you knew how much you mattered to me."
" i always am."
" good night.... fiancé." I say before waving goodbye.
He brought his hand up and caressed my face. I closed my eyes as he traced the areas under my eyes. I noticed the bandages on his arms and my heart ached.
" pathetic. The boy who lived, lost to a couple of flowers."
My attention was brought to the quiet voice above me. Draco looked down, his book forgotten next to him. I shrugged and smiled.
It felt like my lungs collapsed.
I run around to find Draco and harry. No doubt they are together. I turn a corner on the second floor to see them making out. I try my best to hold in my laugh. I walk over , about 6 feet away from them. I clear my throat and they immediately throw themselves off each other. They look at me, hair disheveled and lips swollen. I click my tongue.
" okay okay fine. At least im smarter than you." Hermione huffed and crossed her arms.
" of course weasel is here. You never leave your little boy friend behind." He let go of me and sat down on my other side.
I stormed out the infirmary, slamming the doors. In tears, i ran to the Slytherin common room, locking myself in my room.
" i know, but then i wouldnt have been able to show off that i know that spell." Harry said triumphantly. Hermione scoffed and turned away.
We sat there solemnly.
" i love you harry potter. I always have, and i always will."
" fine.but I cant just stand here and watch you give up on yourself."
It was almost at the end of the year, just 3 more months left. And i, harry potter, savior of the wizarding world, the chosen one, had fallen madly in love witb Draco Bloody Malfoy. The hanahaki didn't start until that blasted day. The day he rejected me.
" no really, its nothing. I just dont get why you wont tell me what you two were talking about but its fine."
" i suggest you shut your mouth before you do something you regret. Be glad you are in a bloody hospital." With a huff cormac left the room, slamming the door behind him. Blaise sighed and sat back down, shaking his head.
" if you're jealous, just tell me."
" its saturday."
" no. But Neville has 0- blood type." Hermione informed. Pomfrey nodded in understanding, knotting her eyebrows.
" what?" Draco was caught off guard.
I memorized the infirmary like my own house and i weaved through all the curtains to find harry's.
Ron POV
I ran out the library and into the nearest bathroom. I choked out the petals and after an extremely unpleasant 5 minutes, all the flowers were gone. I wiped away the blood from my lips and rinsed out my mouth.
" did you just mouth ' i win'?" He asked.
" hey whats up" harry walked over to the couch to sit down. I raise an eyebrow at ron.
We land in Grimmauld place. The living room is just as we left it hours ago. I assume that Hermione and Harry are asleep. I look over at ron who looked a little still. I thought it was a side affect of apparating as it has happened to me too. I let go of his hand and walk over to the couch to grab the robes i left when i hear a thud behind me.
" im not jealous!"
" yeah. Me too. Its not like you really had a choice tho."
" shove off."
" i feel bad for leaving Draco with Harry." I shuffle a little and adjust my scarf as we walk up to the house.
" blaise , Lavender and Cormac are here." Ron shouts over the voices surrounding them.
" but i am not getting married yet. In 5 years. Harry made me promise him 5 years." I looked down at my lap. She hummed and tapped her nails on the table.
" of course we knew. You two are terrible at keeping secrets." Hermione scoffed.
" harry!" Hermione went to hug him but he winced at her touch. The bandages and cuts still very fresh.
I felt rons arms encircle me, then i blacked out.
I smiled fondly at him and continued wiping his face.
" i-"
I roll my eyes and take my wool gryffindor scarf off. I wrapped it around dracos neck and saw him immediately relax. The scarf had heating charms on it and it was a gift from Mrs.Weasley for Christmas.
He stared at me. He wasn't sad or angry, but instead he was..... overjoyed?
" how the fuck can you lay there and tell us that? I am not fucking giving up on you! You asshole, i will find that motherfucker and i will make him love you even if its the last thing i do!"
" also the most in love."
" what?" Draco asked.
" okay take a swig of this."  Hermione handed draco the flask. It was a mix of veritaserum and whiskey to block out the taste. Draco took a swig and set it down, now under the effects of veritaserum.
" why is he here?" I asked rather bluntly. Blaise rolled his eyes and Kingsley sighed.
" yeah."
" yeah, best trio in the world. But anyway we need forces from both the Golden and slytherin trios to defeat the trio of old pasts. Okay? So stop shoving your tongues down each others throats and come help us not die." I wave them over to follow me. They fix themselves on the way, making sure they look presentable.
" wha- hey!" Ron begrudgingly walked out with blaise. Draco snickered and closed his eyes again.
" yeah, his name is Adam." He says. I let out a sigh and look back at the table.
Ron was head of the aurors defense team, pansy an unspeakable in his department, and blaise was head healer in the pediatric division in St.Mungos. He was often brought to draco's hospital for consultation. Pansy and hermione started dating a year after graduation and got engaged a year later. Yep, they moved quickly. Blaise and ron got engaged last month and draco was still waiting. Until February, when he can finally propose. February 26th, the day they officially started dating, and the day harry almost died. It will be their 5 year anniversary on that day and draco can finally propose.
" hey." Ron looks up at me and motions me to sit next to him. I nod and take a seat.
" thats true. But still. Marrying you doesnt seem as bad anymore tho, since marrying someone i really care about. Now those two, they are just idiots." He points at draco who was discussing fabrics with a store clerk and harry who was looking at him dreamily. I stifle a laugh.
Blaise offered his hand and i took it. He pulled me up and i stood next to ron and him. I turned to him fully and hugged him tight.
" no" he pointed angrily at me.
" whats yours?"
" What? Nooooo Adam is here!" Blaise yells back. He turns away and puts his head in his hands.
As healers and doctors ran around trying to get the bleeding to stop, we watched in the waiting room. Finally Pansy announced that he has been taken to surgery, and that he is going to make it. I jump up and hug her tightly.
When he watched Potter dissappear into his rooms he couldn't help but just stare, seeing him again brought up a lot of emotions from their early days. Draco always had a secret fondness for Harry though he'd hardly admit it, not even to himself, seeing him again and knowing they were going to be working and living so close filled Draco with both dread and childish giddiness.
"If I have to fight, then fight I shall" he said to himself, now that he was given a sliver of a chance he was going to fight with everything he had to win Harry's heart.
It wasn't an unpleasant feeling - the atmosphere around them - it was a nice warm feeling in the pit of his stomach, like a cup of hot coco on a cold winter day. Draco smiled and closed his eyes again relaxing into the bench. All remaining tension melting from him.
He could easily just take a shower and have an early night but he was too wound up to sleep yet. Draco still couldn't believe he'd lost his composure like that this morning, it was very unlike him. Instead of relentlessly cursing himself he decided since curfew didn't apply to him anymore he'd take a stroll through the halls of Hogwarts.
Draco shook his head "That's bollocks Harry! Tell me why" he demanded again taking another step into his front room and closing the door behind him "I'm not leaving till I get the answers I deserve" he said.
Harry cursed himself when Malfoy heard him close the map, damn man has hearing like a bat. And when he sat beside him he couldn't help but watch Draco. His white hair silver in the moonlight, and porcelain skin practically glowing. He hadn't felt anything like this in years. He almost held his hand.
Harry smiled back, still studying the blonde's features "I'm sure we can, you're not nearly as insufferable as I thought you were" he said before chuckling "you know, in another life we could have been best friends from the start" he admitted, what would his life have been like if he'd chosen that path instead?
Draco shook his head and closed the gap between them, hugging Harry tightly "Because I've been infatuated with you since the day we met Harry. I never hated you, I may have been a dumb kid and acted like a stubborn spoiled brat but I have always cared for you. Our rivalry was the only way I knew that I could keep you in my life" he said hugging him tighter when Harry tried to pull away.
Harry relaxed slightly and nodded "I'm fine, if that is all I must go over some notes" he said going to shut the door.
"Huh, you don't seem-" Draco started. Drunk? If only.
Harry stirred a little and began mumbling in his sleep "Are you an angel?" He slurred, still unconscious.
Draco looked up at him and instantly wished he didn't, Merlin those eyes. Harry was looking at him as if looking at someone you cared about, suffering. Of course that was all in Draco's head.
When Harry was young - just a first year - he'd heard many of his classmates say how frightening Hogwarts was, however while at first intimidating Hogwarts quickly became a warm and welcoming home for the famous wizard. It was the one place besides the Burrow that actually felt like home. Despite its troubling history with Potter and the awful things he experienced there, it was still a fond home to him and he was elated to be returning.
Draco swallowed and bit his lip, keep control Draco. "Not even once" he lied. You're a Slytherin for Merlin's sake, get your act together. Draco thought to himself.
Draco smiled a little, well he wasn't avoiding him clearly so that at least meant they were still talking. "Is everything alright?" He asked softly, running a hand through his hair in attempt to make it look less messy.
Harry landed in the astronomy tower and fell to his knees hyperventilating and feeling a panic attack coming on. He closed his eyes and held his chest tightly trying to take deep breaths and calm down. His lungs were burning and he couldn't catch his breath. What the hell?! What triggered this?!
Draco wiped his eyes "I can't do that Harry. I've wanted this for so long, I can't just let it go" he admitted, he was planning on being so much more cunning and not revealing his weakness but Harry was his weakness. Hearing these things from him hurt worse than he ever could have imagined. He was completely exposed, he'd never felt this vulnerable.
Draco then smirked, is Harry trying to make him jealous? Merlin that would be the dream. It wasn't the case however, Harry was straight and as far as Draco was concerned and was in no hurry to be interested in anyone. Draco sighed and looked up at the sky, he frowned seeing a flash of black zoom across his peripheral vision. He stood up and tried to get a better look at the flying object.
Harry shook his head "Don't try and change the subject, Draco" he almost purred. Draco shuddered, this side of Harry was far more intoxicating than the absinthe. Dangerously addictive too.
Draco smiled to himself as he watched the small light of Harry's wand disappear "Dear oh dear, Harry you're not making anything easy" he said softly, rubbing his forehead with his hands.
Harry smirked and raised an eyebrow at Draco "Charming as always, I told you I'm fine" he lied, taking the empty bottle into the kitchen. He took a deep breath and leaned against his counter top for a moment, Merlin what am I doing? He asked himself.
He took a deep breath and shook his head before unlocking his door and making his way into his rooms to begin decorating them. After everything was in its place and Draco was happy with the decor he grabbed his bottle of fire whiskey and made his way next door.
Harry lifted his head slowly and frowned at the Slytherin "What makes you think I'm joking?" He asked.
Malfoy smiled another charming smile and nodded "It would be my honour" he said, Harry had to stop himself from rolling his eyes. Admittedly that would be quite a juvenile thing to do but old grudges die hard. It was difficult not to find everything Malfoy did irritating.
Draco let out a sound from deep in his throat and wrapped his arms around Harry's waist. God do that more, Harry thought as he kissed the man more, after a moment he pulled away from the kiss - just a few millimetres to gasp in some air.
He got up as quickly as possible and hid his face praying to Merlin that Draco couldn't see the blush on Harry's cheeks. An actual blush. Harry hadn't blushed in a decade.
Draco froze for a second before kissing him back, placing one of his hands on Harry's cheek. This was wrong, Harry didn't know what he was doing, he's tired, he's been drinking. But Draco was only human, he wanted this more than he could express. Harry smiled against Draco's lips and moved to sit in his lap.
Snape looked pleased "Finally you've learned some manners, there may be hope for you yet Potter" he said, uncharacteristically warm. Harry smiled at him and Snape once again caught himself and rolled his eyes "Go on then! Scamper off and get the plan I want to make sure you're not teaching them dribble" he snapped.
Harry laughed a little "All I'm saying is it could have been a possibility, you're a very handsome man Draco and if you hadn't been a total git in school I might have been interested" he said, his level of candour shook Draco to his core.
Snape's mouth twitched, the corners turning up in a small smile. He quickly corrected himself and shrugged "I suppose that's good, I will be observing all your lessons from now on" he said.
Draco groaned internally, why did he have to be so cute? So wonderful? So perfect? Draco shook the thoughts from his mind and nodded "Yes well I'm glad, it looked like it's been a rough day" he said. He needed more of his drink to deal with all these thoughts and emotions but he also didn't trust what he might say without any inhibitions.
(Harry's POV)
Draco focused from Harry's face to what was in his hands, it was a tray of food - Draco's favourite in fact. How did he know? Draco's stomach twisted as did his heart, he didn't want to fall in love with this man. This is why he started drinking in the first place. Draco shook his head and stepped away from the door, only slightly swaying.
Draco smiled at him and looked down at his own mug of tea, Harry thought he was brilliant. "Thank you" he said quietly. He took a sip and regained his composure "Alright herbology isn't really my speciality but if you'd prefer it to potions I can grab one of my books or something" he began suggesting.
The man sneered "I will not have you wallowing in self-pity. It changes the atmosphere in the room and I don't like change" Snape said.
Luna hummed "I'd like to think so" she said quietly.
"Huh, you don't seem-" Draco started.
Just as he expected, Luna had a gift with the cards. She was always right.
The next morning Harry showered got dressed, making sure he looked really good without looking like he tried to hard, he wanted to make a "last night didn't effect me" impression, but mostly he wanted to piss Draco off. Harry's casual affection with Luna seemed to bother him before so Harry decided to use that to his advantage.
Draco barked one short laugh "Please! You and Luna were all over each other at breakfast, it was highly inappropriate" he said sharply.
Harry rubbed the back of his neck and looked down. Draco smiled at him, Harry was cute when he was being bashful, it almost made up for his arrogance. He would never have told anyone however but safely in his mind he could admit that there was a lot to admire about Harry.
That did it, tears fell from Draco's eyes as he leaned forward - closing the gap between them - and pressed his lips against Harry's.
Harry flinched a little and shook his head "I thought I heard a crash. I thought you were in danger" he said softly rubbing his scar out of habit.
Harry wouldn't look at him anymore "Please just leave Draco" he said softer, anger draining from him just as quickly as it had came on.
A small, sad smile appeared on Harry's lips "This new, likeable Draco is weird. Go back to being an arse so I can go back to hating you and things would be less confusing" he said, shaking his head.
Harry looked at her feigning innocence "I don't know what you're talking about" he said standing up and offering Luna his hand.
Last night was the first time in a very long time that Harry actually had a nice relaxed time laughing and smiling. He hadn't been that comfortable and content in a long time. And to think it was all spent with Draco Malfoy. Harry woke up not really getting much rest, not that he usually did because of his nightmares. He yawned and rubbed his eyes as he got up and made his way to the bathroom to take a much needed shower as his pajamas were soaked through with night sweats. He smiled as he remembered last night, he would never have expected it but Malfoy was actually quite pleasant company when he wasn't wearing that infuriating dumb smirk and he was gracious enough to avoid subjects Harry seemed too uncomfortable to talk about.
Harry grinned like an idiot, he never thought he'd be so glad to see the man before him but he was. "Why are you in here? Why not in Minerva's office with the other portraits? Or even in the potions classroom with Draco?" He asked.
Draco felt his face heat up, no doubt he was blushing, and shook his head "You're drunk" he said, pushing away the fluttering in his chest.
Harry whined then, Merlin the sound was delicious "Shut up and kiss me Malfoy" he said before finally closing the space between them and pressing his lips against Draco's.
Draco froze remembering the trials. He was so certain he was going to Azkaban, he stumbled into the courtroom in loose fitting prisoners clothes and stood before the members of the ministry. He looked worse than he ever had before, he was skinny and pale with paper white skin that looked just as thin and fragile. He didn't bother looking up as the members began speaking, it was only when they asked for Harry's statement that he looked up and locked eyes with the saviour himself. His green eyes filled with so much sadness and hurt, he shook his head "Draco Malfoy and his mother Narcissa Malfoy are both innocent. Their crimes against the wizarding world in the war were those of wizards trying to stay alive under the thumb of Voldemort" he said and stood "Draco Malfoy saved my life when he was asked to identify me when snatchers caught Ron, Hermione and I. Draco recognised me and risked his own life to save mine. Narcissa also saw that I was still alive after Voldemort cursed me, she lied to him and saved us all" he said before looking directly into Draco's eyes "Without him and his mother a lot of us wouldn't be here today" he said.
Draco scoffed "Mighty brave of you to subject yourself to more fuel for the Daily Prophet" he sneered.
Harry shook his head and waved his hand dismissively "No need, I'm of perfectly sound mind" He said seriously before actually hearing himself. He and Draco both started laughing.
Admittedly that was easier said than done. Gryffindors, especially Harry, tended to be very stubborn. Not to mention from the looks of it, Harry had been shutting people and things out for a while now, there was an invisible wall around him that would be hard to knock down. Draco had to try and go about this in true Slytherin fashion, using his cunning wit to manoeuvre his way under Harry's skin.
Draco scoffed and shook his head "Well my hero, the saviour strikes again" he said sarcastically.
Draco felt his heart beat a mile a minute, nothing else mattered in that moment. This was real. He leaned forward again and kissed Harry softly. He felt the man relax again and kiss him back.
Draco retracted his hand ignoring the painful sting in his chest "I'm sorry, instinct. Are you alright?" he asked softly.
--------
"Shhh Harry we've been over this. It doesn't mean what you think it does. This card symbolises change" Luna said, soothing Harry with her feather soft words.
Draco composed himself, swallowing the sudden flush of fear that began creeping in, before knocking on Potter's door "It's open!" called Harry from within.
Harry's cheeks flushed and he bit his lip, looking back at the glass in his hand "Yes perhaps you were right" he said, placing the glass down on the table. Probably a wise move.
Draco blushed and obeyed. When Harry was done feeding Draco they just sat there for a moment, in tense silence.
Finally when he looked as if nothing at all happened yesterday, Harry had decided on his game plan. He's going to act as if nothing did happen yesterday. If Draco didn't bring it up that meant either he'd been too drunk to remember or he didn't want to acknowledge it, both worked for Harry.
Once they were inside, Luna conjured her cards and a bottle of some home brewed liquor her father made from her rooms. Harry focused on controlling his breathing as Luna fetched some shot glasses. It was a little early for drinking but this particular liquor enhanced Harry's readings.
Luna smiled and shook her head fondly as she took his hand and stood up "All is fair in love and war" she said before walking away.
That hurt, like a knife to the gut. Was he really that terrible? Was he so untrustworthy? "Because I'm a death eater?" Draco asked, voice tight and devoid of emotion.
Draco's face softened and he instinctively reached out to him. Harry flinched away from his hand, fear colouring his face "Don't touch me" he spat.
Harry looked up in shock and his eyes landed on a portrait he hadn't noticed before. The man in the painting looked down at the Gryffindor in disgust and he suddenly felt like a child again.
Once everyone had discussed their training and when Minerva wanted their lesson plans, they ate and were lead to their rooms by the house elves. Soon everyone had split off and it was just Harry and Malfoy left. The house elf stopped and handed them their keys "These rooms are yours master Potter and these are yours master Malfoy" he said. Of course they had to have rooms right next to each other. It's not as if they were in a huge castle and rooms were limited.
Harry took a deep breath and placed his cup back down on the table before wrapping his arms around his knees "After I'd done all of my crying I heard a knock on the door, the identification charm told me it was Draco, I probably looked in a right state so I told him to go away but... He asked me to let him in, I don't know what it was about the way he said it but I just couldn't deny him..."
Harry turned to him and yanked his wrist away "What the bloody hell do you want you ungrateful insensitive git?" he spat angrily.
Leave. Leave before my resolve breaks.
Harry then turned to look at him for the first time since he opened the door and smiled a little "It's been quite a day, a glass of fire whiskey and light conversation sounds pleasant" he said softly.
Draco took a deep breath and leaned back, putting distance between the two of them "You're intoxicated and not in control of what you're saying. I doubt you'll even remember this in the morning" he said.
Harry took the other and clinked it with Luna's "Praeteritum" they said in unison before drinking the shots.
Draco had only ever been this vulnerable in front of his mother and Blaze, to be like this in front of Harry? It was unbearable.
"Draco!?" he asked worriedly, when there was no answer Harry stepped back "Alohomora" he cast and opened the door "Draco are you okay!?" he asked looking around and finding Draco looking at the half naked Harry standing in the doorway.
Finally he caught a glimpse of Harry's face when he slowed and began to fly back down to the ground. Draco found himself walking over to where Harry had landed and was met by a glare.
Harry finished cleaning himself and climbed out of the shower, after breakfast he'd have to get a start on his lesson plans before training later that day. He got dressed in his teaching robes, he'd taken a little more pride in his appearance since his time at the ministry, they provided very nice robes for their employees and Harry had become comfortable with the more expensive and formal attire. He still enjoyed wearing his muggle clothes, just not as often. He fixed his hair so it wasn't so messy and made his way out of his rooms, towards the Grand Hall for breakfast with the rest of the staff. Harry was one of the last to join them and took great pride in seeing Malfoy... No Draco's reaction to his well dressed manor, man he'd have to get used to calling Draco by his first name. It was very fun however to keep catching the man off guard, breaking through the Malfoy facade just for a moment. He fought back a confident smirk and sat down next to Neville who turned from his conversation with his wife to greet Harry.
Harry smiled a little "Your eyes are pretty" he said quietly.
Satisfied with his decision he stood up, walked out of his front door and knocked on Harry's "Go away Draco!" Harry yelled.
Luna tilted her head a little to look directly into Harry's eyes. She stared for a moment before a bright wide smile spread across her face "Oh Harry this is wonderful!" she exclaimed doing a little happy twirl.
Draco chuckled and shook his head "This is absinthe, it'll help, trust me" He said, setting up two glasses. He watched the water begin dripping over the sugar cubes and sat back.
Draco put his foot in the way and opening the door again "A mistake?" he asked unable to hide the hurt in his voice.
Harry pushed open the door and walked into the room, much to his expectation, his mind was bombarded with memories and reminders of three people he'd lost.
Harry shrugged and decided to play along, Draco had been embarrassed enough and Harry had gotten a good laugh in "The nargles stole them" he said casually after he'd calmed down.
Once he was in the clear open ground he paused and enjoyed the wind washing over him before taking a deep breath and kicking off the ground.
Harry shook his head "I'm terrified but I don't think I have the strength to resist him" he admitted.
And just like that Harry left and Draco was alone, the events of the last 24hrs weighed on him like a house, he was exhausted in every sense of the word. He stripped his clothes off and hopped into some pyjamas before crawling into bed.
Harry sat in the shower, hot water pelting down on him like searing knives. What the hell had he done? Did that really happen last night? Harry felt disgusted, he had practically forced himself on Draco. It started out as a joke, it really had, it was fun to watch Draco squirm. However nothing he said was anything he hadn't thought about before, and the more Harry looked into his piercing eyes... The way Draco looked back at him... he shuddered and hugged his knees tighter to his chest.
Draco shook his head "I'm serious Harry, what is this?" He asked, using his hand to gesture to the two of them.
Way to go Draco.
Harry took a step away and shook his head "Merlin you lost your father because of me, how can you even look at me after that?" he asked voice cracking.
Luna placed her other hand on Harry's "I can't tell you that" She said solemnly.
Draco shook his head "No, I don't believe you. I deserve to know why you're pushing me away and telling me it was a mistake because it sure didn't feel like one" he said determined.
Harry opened the door angrily and glared daggers at the blonde man "Everything. Everything that's happened between us. It was  all a mistake" he spat, beginning to close the door.
Draco kissed the side of Harry's head "My father was a selfish man who saw me as a pawn to get more power rather than his son" he said.
Harry nodded slowly and regained his breathing "What is he telling you?" He asked hesitantly.
Draco smiled at him "I hope we can become friends someday" he admitted.
Harry shrugged "Perhaps a little, but it's true and you're right. This definitely helps" he said twisting so he was facing Draco. Harry rested his head on the back of the sofa and smiled absently.
Draco's heart jumped a little "Confusing?" He repeated, confusing how? What was confusing? Did Harry feel something?
Draco shifted a little, that hadn't been intentional, he quickly regained his composure and nodded wearing his regular smirk "Why yes Harry, we're coworkers now and it's only appropriate that we refer to each other on a first name basis" he said taking another sip of his drink. Quick save, classic Slytherin.
Draco's eyes drifted to Harry's lips "H-how much did you have to drink earlier?" Draco stuttered, finally the reaction Harry wanted.
Draco's anger deflated like a balloon and he looked sheepishly down at his feet "So why were you looking for her shoes?" he asked pretending he hadn't just reacted like a jealous teenager.
Draco growled in frustration and sat down by the lake, he was so angry, mostly at himself for being so upset about Harry being close with Luna. Sure Harry said she has a fiancé but why did he have to touch her so much and call her dear and look so damn good. Its like he's trying to make Draco jealous.
He was so worked up because he kissed Draco last night and he wanted more.
Harry paused before breaking out in hysterical laughter, which only enraged Draco more. By the time Harry finally caught his breath, Draco was visibly twitching with anger. He was jealous! Oh this is too good!
He began to hum softly as he finished brewing the tea, adding a little raw honey for sweetness. Honey was always better than sugar when it came to camomile. When he was done he walked over to Harry to find him already watching the Slytherin intently.
Harry sighed and slumped in his chair "I don't know" he admitted, it wasn't exactly the answer Draco wanted but at least it was an answer.
Draco seemed to struggle before nodding "Yes well I'm glad, it looked like it's been a rough day" he said.
Harry looked over at Draco and for the first time in a very long time actually smiled like he used to. A warm and genuine smile, a whisper of youth returning to his eyes "It's good to see you back to your regular self" he said softly "I wasn't very fond of the Draco I remembered from the war and I in all honesty hated seeing you the way you were at the trial" Harry said.
Harry let out a light chuckle, it was nice, Draco couldn't remember the last time he'd heard Harry laugh or even smile genuinely for that matter. Harry sat back next to him and put the glasses on the coffee table in front of them "Well you see, while I do enjoy my - garish and obnoxious - house colours. Green happens to be my favourite colour" he said taking the bottle of whiskey from Draco and pouring them each a glass.
"Drink up and tell me everything that happened" she said gently.
Harry chuckled and pulled Draco into a soft sweet kiss, slowly wrapping his arms around Draco's neck.
Harry chuckled and shook his head "Right away professor" he said out of habit, even though it hadn't been a habit in many years.
Draco choked then, he sputtered and struggled for words "Y-you're crazy" he stuttered, taking a large swig of his drink, draining the rest of his glass.
Harry was looking at something on the desk, what was he looking at? Draco waited but Harry still didn't turn. Suddenly he remembered.
Harry shrugged again looking away, as if picturing them "Nasty little creatures, terribly mischievous thieves and they infest mistletoe" he said "Although it's strange to find them out and about this time of year" he added thoughtfully.
Harry relaxed into the Slytherin and kissed him back. Nothing else happened that night, just kind kisses and two men holding each other together. It was nice, terrifying and dangerous but nice.
He leaned closer once more, he was now only a few inches from Draco's face "You see, I'm having a little trouble believing that" he almost whispered. His voice was low and a little gravely. It was painfully apparent that he was... Excited.
Luna hummed, focusing on the card, her lips began to move wordlessly and the entire room got a little blurry. As if Harry and Luna were now in a separate state. Finally Luna looked back up, light dancing behind her eyes in amusement. "I knew it" she said, almost giggling as she did.
Harry hummed and leaned towards Draco slightly "So you mean to say you've never thought about it? Never thought about the possibility?" He asked, voice low and cautious.
Harry left his room and Draco leaned against the wall sighing. He hated the hurt look on Harry's face, and he hated even more that he was the cause. He didn't know Harry would be so offended by it and he definitely didn't mean to hurt him.
Draco had to admit in any other circumstance a half naked Harry Potter in his room would be very welcome but he looked genuinely worried. What struck Draco more was that Harry was actually worried about him. And Draco had to go and deflect the genuine emotion with a cold sarcastic remark.
Draco stood there frozen, he wanted to go after him but was that really a good idea? He sighed and rubbed his forehead. He knew Harry was going to be freaked out, but it hurt. Draco could swear he saw a hopeful yearning in Harry's eyes but that couldn't be real. It was impossible. But Merlin did Draco want it to be real.
Draco chuckled and shook his head "This is absinthe, it'll help, trust me" He said, pouring some bright green liquid into the two glasses. He then placed each of them under a spout on the silver contraption, put a spoon looking thing atop the glasses and placed a sugar cube atop that. Finally he turned the spout and watched the water begin dripping over the sugar cubes.
He fell into one of the chairs beside him and held his aching head in his hands.
Draco's heart raced, what in the world was happening right now? Control Malfoy, never reveal your cards. Draco shrugged trying to look as if he didn't care "Maybe in passing, like if one were to contemplate the existence of mythical creatures" he said, voice staying surprisingly even.
--------
Draco put his now empty glass on the table and crossed his arms "You're full of it, it's not polite to joke about such things" he said. Merlin did he want it to be real, for there to be even a chance, even if it was in a whole other hypothetical world.
He groaned and laid down on the couch "I can't do this. I can't" he scolded himself, closing his eyes.
"I'm not, my tolerance to things is regretfully high" He interrupted.
Draco was surprised at first but happily wrapped an arm around the man next to him. "Thank you, I feel much better" Harry said before yawning.
"Everything, everything? Or just what happened today?" Harry asked, relaxing back into the couch.
To say that Draco's first day back at Hogwarts was strange was a very large understatement. First of all seeing Potter making his way over to the gates of Hogwarts was enough to make him do a double take. He hadn't seen Potter since the trials and he looked very different from then. Now he was cold and distant, he had a hard expression and a sad empty air around him. It almost made Draco pity him, if it weren't for the act of pity being a great insult to a Malfoy he probably would have.
Draco's eyes burned as tears filled them "Promises of a better life, a life I've always wanted but could never have, it's cruel and painful" he said, so quietly that Harry probably wouldn't have heard him if he weren't so close.
Draco couldn't help but burst into laughter "I did warn you" he said, taking another sip from his glass.
Luna shook her head "You definitely aren't going to like it. Though he told me to draw the next card before I tell you" she said before pouring the last two shots.
She smiled at him "This tastes better, besides there's no way Draco would let me take that from his store cupboard without reason" she explained.
The corner of Harry's lips twitched up into a smile as he walked into the room. Draco closed the front door and made his way over to the open kitchenette on the other side of the room. Harry walked straight over to the couch and pulled his wand out of his pocket, lighting the fireplace with a simple flick of his wrist.
He groaned and ran his hands through his hair, he had to know him. He had to at least be friends. Yeah that was good, friends. That had to be good enough, he'd get Harry to be his friend. Even though that didn't work out well the first time, they we're adults now and Harry didn't seem to hate Draco anymore. Draco decided that he was worth any risk. He had waited 15 years for even a splinter of a chance and he wasn't about to let Harry escape from him now. He had to know his options.
Harry just nodded, still confused and retrieved the requested items from the kitchen. "I thought you needed help with the N.E.W.T.s not a guinea pig for new potion" He grumbled warily as he set the glasses and bowl of sugar cubes down on the table in front of Draco.
(Harry's POV)
He felt Luna's hand on his then "It's not your fault you have scars Harry, you've made such amazing progress with your PTSD and you are doing so well" she said softly, giving his hand a supportive squeeze.
He smiled and looked back down at his plate. Once everyone had eaten their breakfast Minerva stood.
Draco pulled away only slightly, eyes still closed "What if the life I want isn't mine to fight for?" He asked hesitantly, slowly opening his eyes.
Luna squeezed his hand tightly, dragging Harry back into reality "Dear Harry its time. Trust me, trust the cards. Change is coming whether you like it or not. Just please don't shut yourself away when they try to love you" She said.
