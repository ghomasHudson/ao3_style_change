“Of course not,” Draco said, his tone derisive.  “But I discovered something else.”  Carefully, he stacked one slide on top of another.  “Shagging blokes isn’t as good as I thought it would be.”  His eyes flicked up, taking in Harry’s expression.  “It’s
“Yeah,” Harry agreed, “but it’s Malfoy. He wouldn’t—he reads a lot. And studies all the time. He just wouldn’t give me something that—I mean, even if he was doing something to himself, he wouldn’t do it to me. Something questionable, I mean. He would—he’s careful. About—about those kinds of things.”
Rombe Pickle was in the midst of an orchard; the apples were not quite ripe but would be in a few weeks, still hard and green now in their twisted branches. The stone house was on top of a little slope, at the bottom of which stood a knot of other stone houses and hundreds of apple trees all readying for autumn.
“Come off it, Malfoy,” Harry said, pulling Malfoy back around to face him.  “I know it’s got lye; I need to know something in it that would help me identify the brewer.  I know you can do it.”
“Sometimes you do,” Draco said gently.  “But not often.  Harry.”  Draco finally turned back around.  “We must . . . remain in character from here on out.  Possibly we may be able to avoid talking to anyone else altogether, but you must . . . remember to call me Potter, and you mustn’t say things like . . .”
Harry didn’t bother to bring up the fact that Pillwickle had contradicted that idea not a moment ago. “The Order of the Phoenix—Teddy Lupin, Regina Fairchild, and Astoria
Malfoy leapt off the broom, graceful since childhood but also from the too many years of Defensive Flying Baggot had forced him to repeat. He whirled to face Harry, eyes blazing. “What do you mean by that?”
“Oh God.”  Taking off his glasses, Harry rubbed his eyes.  Then his face.  His whole jaw itched, with the beard.  He should shave it off.  Fuck.  He did not want to go down this road.  He did not want to argue with Draco about every single thing that had happened at Hogwarts.  It would make them hate each other again.  It would destroy the distance they had come; it wasn’t fair.  Christ.  It wasn’t fair.
Talking to those non-magical people had been good practice, but it could never prepare him for the variety of reactions any human being would have upon learning about a whole world of magic that had been hidden from them. As Harry talked to them—people who were afraid, people who were hopeful, people who were fascinated; people who thought wizards would cure cancer; people who thought witches were the devil; people who thought the apocalypse was upon them; people who thought gods had come to earth—he tried to remember what he himself had thought, when he had learned of the magical world, but he could not remember.
Harry rubbed the back of his hand. “I just mean . . . maybe we can have something better than what we’ve got. The Ministry didn’t help us when we were kids.”
The Ministry held its holiday gala in early December so as many people as possible could attend before they began overseas Apparating for holiday travel, but the Auror holiday party was always close to Christmas. Harry was still invited to the Ministry gala; technically, his position as an Auror instructor made him adjunct to the Ministry, but he had stopped going years ago, despising the number of reporters and pure-blood “philanthropists” who thought he was there for their personal show.
Harry grabbed his arm, and Malfoy stopped. Just stopped, standing there, and Harry could feel the velvet of the robe—scarlet today, as though Malfoy was playing Auror dress-up. Harry could hear Malfoy’s breathing go noisy, then remembered Malfoy was scared of him. Harry let him go. “I’m going to help you,” Harry said.
Malfoy wasn’t decent, but he wasn’t the same prat Harry had known in school.  Harry wasn’t the same person either, and the wizarding world as an adult wasn’t what Harry had expected when he was a child.  With a loud crack, Harry Disapparated.
Harry almost felt chuffed—but didn’t, since it was Malfoy. Malfoy added a drop of Wood-Eye Lye to the mixture, then added another to the berries mixed with seaweed and dragon pus, and then yet another drop to the black powder and bones.
“The current Minister for Magic wishes to embrace non-magical people as our sisters and brothers,” said a booming, steady voice, cutting through the small chaos. “By joining the rest of the world and being a part of it, instead of holding ourselves separate and aloof, we can better understand our neighbours. And perhaps prevent war in the future.”
Harry had once tried to kill himself. He hadn’t done it in the best way possible. Or maybe he had, given that it hadn’t worked. Casting Avada Kedavra on yourself was always tricky; you had to mean it.
“Some boys do,” Harry said steadily.  “I know a boy who’s got tattoos all over, and at least five piercings, and he always wears a braid on one side, and it’s always got something in it—twine or beads or a ribbon.  He’s got the biggest muscles you’ve ever seen.”
The night of the NDE meeting, Harry sat at a desk with the Whisper Wire, while Robards and the four other Aurors who would Apparate to the meeting stood arrayed around the IC:WUT/UC. Robards had insisted on being one of the Aurors in on the action, claiming that Harry Potter could “steal the glory” and Shacklebolt could “seize control,” but no one would stop him from doing his sworn duty. Pretty much everyone knew that Robards wanted his name in the headlines, and that the only way to get it there if Harry Potter was involved would be to finally step out from behind a desk and do something worthwhile.
He’d forget it again.  Harry knew for a fact that he would, that Malfoy letting Death Eaters into Hogwarts didn’t have anything to do with why he’d stopped Malfoy from going further.  He’d forgiven Malfoy for that long ago, and anyway, even if that was who Malfoy once had been, it wasn’t who Malfoy was now.  The only reason Harry had stopped Malfoy had been because they were under compulsion of the powder.  Harry would never do anything like that when someone wasn’t free to make their own choices.  Without the powder, Harry wasn’t even sure what he would choose.
“You want to suck on something, don’t you, Harry?” Draco asked, his voice gentle. “You need something in your mouth. Something to fill you up.”
Clouds moved in the sky, patient and white, as though nothing was going on beneath them.  The absence of life was strange after a while, without the sound of birds, without even insects to crawl among the stones.  Harry thought about doing a spell to make the grass grow.  He couldn’t decide if it would make Malfoy feel any better.
Draco had said that same thing about the fox, but Harry didn’t see why it couldn’t be true.  Tentatively, he petted Heloise’s head again.  She closed her eyes, head pressing down into her neck.  Harry guessed that meant she liked getting petted.
“I meant,” Harry said, also trying not to sound helpless or disappointed or any of the things that he was feeling, “I could read to you.”
Harry thought about that.  “It doesn’t seem very likely,” he said after a moment—but magic was a different story.  It explained a lot of things, actually.
Harry went to his hearth, opened the pot on the mantel, took out the Floo powder, and threw it in the hearth. “Granger-Weasleys,” he told the green flame, then put his face into it.
“Sometimes I wasn’t nice,” Harry said, after a long moment.  “There are times when you shouldn’t be.”
“Were they?” Kavika said, cleaning out the bowl that held the grounds, putting the teapot away. “Offensive?”
, but Harry didn’t know how to explain that he thought it was terrible that Narcissa and Lucius had encouraged Draco to hide himself.  The worst part of it was, Narcissa and Lucius had wanted to protect Draco, and that was understandable.  They’d even been trying to make Draco get along with people better, and in some ways that went hand-in-hand with being a good person—but it wasn’t the same.  Harry didn’t know how to say all that, so what he said was, “I’d say you’ve been indecorous.  Yeah.”
The Dark Mark couldn’t be a Horcrux, however. For Voldemort to split his soul into that many pieces would have been impossible; he would have become too unstable. The binding spells wouldn’t be able to hold on to such small slivers. Harry thought of what he would do, if he was Voldemort.
When he looked up, Liang and Abbott had stopped and were arguing. Liang needed to practice her holds, but Malfoy and Nyala had just finished a bout, and Malfoy said something to Liang. Both Liang and Vigil turned, and Malfoy went over to them, which was perfect. Malfoy already knew everything anyway. Harry went back to McDevitt.
“It was a kiss, not the end of the world.”  Harry knew Malfoy had just been being defensive.  He knew it, but goddamn.  Dredging up the Gryffindor thing just seemed like so much effort, like maybe Malfoy hadn’t changed so much after, like maybe he still thought of Harry as some sort of enemy, even after everything—though maybe it was the kissing in particular that had set Malfoy off.  Now that Harry thought about it, probably Malfoy had a homophobic streak about a mile wide.  Malfoy had been raised a pure-blood, so it was understandable, just—Harry had sort of thought Malfoy had got over the way he was raised, his petty prejudices.  Hearing Malfoy act this way after everything was—
He never finished, cutting himself off to turn toward the pub, which had grown silent, except for the buzz of the wireless. “—it up,” came a voice from inside, and the volume increased. Slipping out his wand, Malfoy cast a spell, and the voice on the wireless suddenly become audible outside on the pavement.
“Newborn baby tears,” Malfoy said, his tone almost bored.  “They taste delicious.  Potter, you better give me that potion before puppies die and the blood of innocents is awash in the streets.”  Not even looking at him, Malfoy held out his hand.
Harry moaned, partly from Draco’s words, partly because he really thought he could come, just from getting fucked on both ends, just from
He was like grown Malfoy in miniature, with his neat little trousers and his neat little dress shirt—his little
“I don’t feel fine, is the problem,” Harry said, playing with the crystal puzzle, frustrated with it already. He set it down with a clunk on one of Doctor Yin’s crowded shelves. “I don’t want to not know what I want. I want to know what I want.”
,” Harry murmured. As soon as Harry began the spell, a green mist began to seep out around them, a malevolent force that sank down toward the floor, slithering around their legs.
Harry turned, but Teddy was slipping out the door, and Harry didn’t know what to say. Did this mean that Teddy would join the terrorist tearing down the wards? Did it mean he was going to quit Academy and go help Hermione win the Deal? Were he and Malfoy going to start a band? You never knew, with Teddy.
“Oh,” Harry said. “Yeah. I mean, I haven’t thought about it much. I’m just glad Malfoy isn’t into me anymore.”
Harry shrugged.  “Okay, I guess.  Aunt Petunia has me chop the things that don’t need to be very small.”
Harry took a breath. “Actually . . . I’m not sure . . . ‘exercises’ really work for me. Kavika and I—we usually just talked.”
“Malfoy.”  Harry took another step.  He was standing very close to Malfoy, now.  “I think you could do anything you wanted, if you put your mind to it.”
“Are you comfortable, Andromeda?” Malfoy said, hovering, even though he had cast maybe a dozen little breezes for her and filled her glass maybe fifty times, even when it didn’t need filling. Andromeda had eventually tucked it away behind some of the tulle, possibly afraid that Malfoy might make it overflow.
Fairchild was a Level Two trainee who had brought her non-magical date to the holiday party, and it had caused quite the scandal, on top of several other scandals of the evening—one of which had been Harry chatting with Vinicius, since the wizard press had immediately begun ‘shipping’ the two of them.
“He was the love of her life.  That’s why she went mad in Azkaban—she couldn’t stand the thought of him being on his own.  Without her.”
“All right!” Sibanyoni’s eyes widened, the tone climbing now to a note of success, of revelation. “Okay! Bad things. Bad things at Hogwarts, in your childhood. We don’t have to go there. Leave it behind. Talk about it, but leave it behind. I have other exercises, plenty of other exercises; we can go through; you can say what you like, what sparks your interest. You don’t have to do anything you don’t like, nothing too new; that’s all right.”
“But.”  Draco’s eyes searched his.  “But we . . .”  He bit his lip.  “I must help you,” he said, settling back against Harry.  “I help you in school, don’t I?  I’m the one that reads to you.  Do you like it, Harry?  Do you like it when I read to you?”
“I’ve just got a job at Slug and Jiggers—you know, the potions shop on Diagon?  I wanted Mr. Mulpepper’s, but she wouldn’t take me.  No one wants to hire ex-Death Eaters.”  Draco looked around the lab again.  “But this is all right, actually.  It’s quite good, in fact.  Better than I expected.  Did you want to look at the Ward Record memories?”
“Immaculo,” Draco told the dildo, and it was immediately stripped clean. Then he pointed the wand at Harry’s face.
“Draco.” Harry put his hands on Draco’s shoulders, pulling him away, pushing him back on the bed. “Draco.” Harry moved down the bed, opening Draco’s shirt again. He put his mouth on one of the scars.
Today, however, wasn’t a normal session, and he wasn’t sure what to expect. In a normal session, he would’ve probably talked about Orientation. It was always a bit rough, with the trainees’ questions—though this year, for the third time, Malfoy had been there. He’d left coffee on Harry’s desk before the day had started, and he had been wearing what appeared to be a woman’s blouse. This had managed to distract most of the trainees rather thoroughly, much to Harry’s convenience, and instead of trainees asking Harry whether he had PTSD and was a murderer, they wanted to know from Malfoy what it was like to be a gay disowned spy whose father owned a quarter of Diagon.
That was after one of the first ward-drops, back when unification with the Non-Magical World was only a glimmer in Hermione’s eye, the Reveal referendum not even a thing yet dreamed. Chaos had followed the ward-drop, as chaos usually did, so cleverly finding its way into the cracks and crevices of culture. The non-mags had been shocked by the drop, suddenly witnessing the Wizarding World in all its glory. Some non-mags had reacted with fear, trying to run away, but instead running deeper into the mayhem.
Once the potions had been taken care of for the night, Harry and Draco almost always went to the sitting room in front of the fire.  There they had hot chocolate, and Draco taught Harry spells, or read to him from the fairy tale book, or played more Exploding Snap with him.  When Harry asked to look at more photos, they looked at the rest of the album, but after that Draco said he hadn’t any more.
“This?” Yin looked around too, as though another smoothie might materialize. “I’m sure there is. Glass!” they barked, which was how they Accio’d. Another jar floated into their hand, and they stood. “Never Accio a smoothie,” they added, digging through the detritus on the sidebar to find the old blender. “I learned that the hard way.”
“Pity,” Draco said, dropping Harry’s hand.  “It’s a pity you didn’t learn your lesson.  I wish she’d have done it over your whole body.”
“You’re cute.”  Savage had sat on the edge of Proudfoot’s desk and turned to look at Proudfoot, the only other Auror who had worked there as long as she had.  “He’s cute.”
“What are you . . . ”  Mister Malfoy frowned.  “Look, Potter.  You’re not switching places.  Ten-year-old-you is already there.  In the past.”
“I’m interested in how you know this,” Kavika said. “You believe what Malfoy said in May, about knowing you?”
Harry knew Draco was only saying it so they could pretend like nothing had happened earlier, except Harry wasn’t sure why Draco would want to pretend that, other than that Draco did want to forget it.  And that almost made sense, because Draco was so kind and talented—he was a genius, really, with magic—except Harry had yelled at him.  He should be sent to the cupboard for several hours for that at least.  “Why are you . . .?” Harry began, but he couldn’t quite figure out what he wanted to ask.
“Look at me when I’m talking to you,” Malfoy said, then ripped the parchment out of Harry’s hand.  “What is this?”
“Understand what?” Harry asked, his head still hanging over the side.  He felt stupid for wishing Draco would touch him again.
“All right,” Harry said, smiling and unable to resist. “What are all the dirty secrets you’ve learned?”
“I’m there,” Harry said, pointing to the luggage rack, then explaining how he had snuck into the train compartment behind Blaise Zabini after the first meeting of the Slug Club on the train in sixth year. Malfoy, Parkinson, and Zabini all continued talking. Harry could see that underneath Malfoy’s veneer of indifference, he was angry he hadn’t been invited to Slug Club. Harry wasn’t sure whether he had understood at the time that this anger was a result of hurt feelings, but he probably had. Harry hadn’t ever misunderstood Malfoy, not really. He’d known from the beginning that Malfoy was insecure, jealous and vulnerable. Meanwhile,
“A constellation.  I forgot—most Muggles don’t pay attention to stars the way wizards do.”  Pointing his wand upward again, Draco made silver sparks come out of it.  They drifted upward, tracing lines between the stars.  “This is Ursa Major,” he said, moving closer to Harry and pointing.  “Do you see?  It looks like a bear.”
“I’m still the control,” Harry said, still amused.  “The test is for whether you’ve had the Wood-Eye Lye, not whether the Veritaserum is working.  Besides, I have to actively fight Veritaserum for it not to work.  You go first,” Harry said, nudging the shot glass with the indicator solution in it toward Malfoy.  “I want to see what colour your thumb changes.”
Harry Summoned a glass of water, then made it cold, because that was nice. “Here,” he said, holding it out to Malfoy, but Malfoy didn’t drink it. Harry Summoned chocolate next, because they were nice as well, but Malfoy took it and didn’t eat that either. “What can I do?” Harry said, squatting next to the chair, so he could be closer to eye level.
Potter’s hair,” Malfoy said, holding up his hand.  The whole mess of hair came flying into Malfoy’s palm.  Malfoy’s eyes widened as he looked at it.  “Heavens, Potter, why did you—”  Malfoy cut himself off, having accidentally looked up.
“Right.  We’ve already established I become a tasteless idiot, also known as Hufflepuff.  But I shouldn’t have to put up with your salads
Term opened on a cold day in September, when the leaves on the Timothy Tree were half bleeding into a vibrant scarlet. It started a day earlier for Level One, orientation consisting of tours of Bickford-Buckley and Leck, an overview of policies, and an introduction to the instructors and their courses. Today reporters crowded around Pallas Arch, attempting to capture photographs, perhaps, of Draco Malfoy attempting to climb the Timothy Tree. Legend said the tree would know whether the heart of a disciple was true, only allowing the most virtuous trainee to scale its branches. Few had ever done it.
The first spells were exactly what Harry had taught, a standard exchange of attempts to disarm or disable, blocked by typical shield spells and counter-attacks. Then Harry got an Expelliarmus in, and remembered that this was why he still had control of the Elder Wand. That was enough distraction for Malfoy to use the hand-to-hand trick Harry had taught them well—Malfoy grabbing Harry’s wrist and jerking forward, turning as he did it, so that his body slid along Harry’s and behind.
“Asking for a friend,” Malfoy said, in his light, quick way. “Just for instance, if I bound a plant’s life magic to me, instead of a mark on me, then killed the plant—would that make me live just a little longer?”
This was boring. And a trifle embarrassing. Harry strained to see if he could see the figure he had seen earlier, when Parkinson said, “Because you’re a
“No, it’s perfect; I love people speaking snake at me; it never reminds me of a megalomaniac serial killer living in my childhood house. Not at—” Cutting himself off, Malfoy fell into abrupt silence. His hand still covered the blank space on his arm. He was staring at the floor.
“Yes, I thought—I thought that might be the case.  Anyway,” Draco went on, his cheeks a bit pink, “using surnames is convenient, isn’t it?  Harry.  That way you know which family everyone is from, which is important.  Imagine being a ‘Smith’.”
“You were right,” Harry said.  “About there being a threat.  You shouldn’t—don’t leave your flat without changing your features.  And don’t mess with the wards.  And I’m leaving my Patronus.”
Ron had a point. Harry didn’t know what the point was yet, but Ron definitely had one, a very solid point.
“I could enlarge them,” Harry said.  “Or we could find other ones, since you think they’re hideous.”
A trace of a grimace passed over Malfoy’s face, then was gone, but he stayed behind. The last of the trainees filed out, and then they were alone. “You told me you were going to make an effort in my classes,” Harry said.
“Sweetheart.” Draco adjusted the weight of his upper body so that he could kiss him. “My darling.” He kissed him again. “My beloved.” Again. “My precious boy.” Again. “My sweet, beautiful boy, mine, I’ll take care of you; I’ll take care of you.”
“If you want to call it that.” Malfoy popped out of existence and then back in, beside Harry now instead of in front of him, too fast to anticipate or predict. “Expelliarmus,” Malfoy said in his ear.
“For your problems sleeping,” Harry explained. “I found out about it a while ago. Most people just take Dreamless, but I found this makes me feel better the next morning.”
“No.” Harry looked at him carefully, but Malfoy seemed so perfectly sincere. At the end of last year, Harry had concluded Malfoy hadn’t known that the Board had been lobbying Harry to change Malfoy’s scores, but the idea that he hadn’t found out—that he hadn’t heard the rumours, at the very least—hadn’t occurred to Harry. Either Malfoy had become a much better liar than he used to be, or he didn’t know. “You honestly don’t think there are people who want you to be an Auror?”
“If it is,” Harry said, “I don’t think Malfoy got it. He was terrible in hand-to-hand the first year he took it.”
Possibly it did mean something; Malfoy’s eyes were bright, as though he might cry. Maybe he was already crying, angling his face away, so Harry could only see the angle of Malfoy’s jaw, the white line of Malfoy’s throat, the lacing of Malfoy’s elegant wizard frock coat, up to the throat.
“You won’t be either,” Draco said.  “I’m sure you’ll find a very beautiful wife and have plenty of very handsome babies.”  Slowly, his stack finally in order, Draco played another card.
Harry floated between then and now: Robards, who saw crimes only when they threatened his status quo; Proudfoot, who ardently believed the protection of non-magical people meant forgetting they existed. Ron, who still thought he could be an Auror and do the right thing; Hermione, who still thought that she could be in the Ministry and do the right thing. Shacklebolt, who still thought that he could form a coalition; Greengrass, who was waiting to see which way the wind blew; Lucius Malfoy, who thought he could act like he had no position while secretly working to fund the opposition. Teddy, who still thought he could be a hero in this world.
“Oh, no.” Kavika stood up, heading over to her side table. “I hear about this every day from my husband. Do you think I wanted more?”
Harry and Kavika talked pleasantries for a little while; Kavika had been to see her first granddaughter. Kingsley had only been able to come for a few days now and then, but Kavika had spent almost six weeks with her. Harry teased that Molly was already at seven grandchildren and never seemed tired a whit; Kavika replied she had no ambitions to be Molly Weasley. Kavika asked how the hols had been, and Harry told her.
Tapping on the ledger with his wand, Harry cast the reading spell.  Draco’s adult voice read him the ingredients and notes all over again, though Harry had to recast it after the first page because he’d stopped listening to the content and had started just listening to the voice.  Draco’s child voice was high and sweet, but Draco’s adult-voice made Harry ache, like Harry was an instrument somehow tuned to respond to the same frequency as Draco’s tenor.  Harry loved it.  He was ashamed of how much he loved it; it was stupid.
After chewing a bit more, Harry finally managed to swallow.  “I thought you said old-me said he couldn’t trust people there.”
“We’ll see,” Harry said, but then was terrified that he was flirting in front of the whole class. Would keeping Malfoy after class be inappropriate, when Harry felt this way? Especially if they were to talk about extra credit—
“Oh,” said Kavika. “I thought you said you’d have them removed if they spoke of your years at school. During the war.”
On the pale muscle of Malfoy’s forearm was some kind of mark, maybe a series of scratches. Harry couldn’t see it from across the room. When Malfoy spoke, his voice was calm and careless. “
Malfoy’s eyes were very open, his expression blank. “When did you find out about this?” He hefted the little bottle.
Harry rolled over, putting himself over Draco now, Draco on the bed beneath him, eyes wide with surprise, cheeks pink. Pulling Draco’s hand away from his dick, Harry pinned it on the bed. “What else did you imagine?”
“What the outside world is doing?” Spragg turned on her. “It’s what the magical world has always done, isn’t it? Worry about ourselves.”
“You don’t have to put Dementors in the sky to write out the fact that you weren’t into it.  You can just say you weren’t into it, and that’s fine.  Do you think I’d hold a grudge against you?”
Leaning in, Draco kissed Harry’s forehead after all; then his lips moved to Harry’s ear.  “I’m sorry,” he whispered.
Harry watched, strangely compelled.  He’d seen Malfoy do magic before.  He’d seen plenty of people do magic before, but Harry hadn’t seen Malfoy do it since school.  Malfoy hadn’t
“Ah.”  Moving away, Draco began to sweep up the clothes strewn about the room.  “I don’t think that would be such a good idea.”
“No. I mean she’s a good soul. With a good heart. One of the best people I’ve ever known.” Malfoy rocked his heels thoughtfully on the kerb, toes hanging over the edge, then decided to add something else. “She challenges me.”
Teddy frowned at him, the long eyebrows he had on today slanting down, the soft mouth pursed.  Usually Teddy didn’t change his mouth, unless he really wanted to look like someone else.  He said that was the hardest part.  “Ye-es?” he said, with some hesitation.  “Are you—is something wrong?”
“Just for a moment,” Harry soothed. “I’m going to touch your shoulders. Here,” he said, gently putting his hands on Malfoy’s mostly bare shoulders. “They’re up near your ears. See if you can relax enough to drop them.”
Harry’s grown-up body wasn’t short.  It wasn’t taller than Draco either, but it was wider, the shoulders and chest broader.  It wasn’t big like Arnold Schwarzenegger was big—Uncle Vernon thought Arnold Schwarzenegger was tops—but he sort of looked like someone who could beat you up, if he wanted to.  That wasn’t the awful part, though.  The awful part was he looked like he
Harry finished cutting himself the skinny slice.  Mister Malfoy cut his own slice after that, and Harry finally took a bite.  It was delicious, and it definitely did not taste like bread.
Harry looked at it as well—Draco’s white hand on Harry’s red cock, the black hair at the base. It was a striking picture, but not quite striking enough for Harry to be as awed by it as Draco was, especially since Draco’s hand was so gentle and slow. “Draco,” Harry said, because Draco had been staring at it a while.
Harry had never been all that punctual, and his thoughts while flying plus the change of clothes meant that he was most likely late—a fact that was supported by the entire class turning to look at him when he flung open the classroom door. “Sorry,” he said, half for the tardiness and half for the bang of the door. “You could have started without me,” he added. “I can make you better at wandless combat, but I can’t actually warm up anyone else but myself.”
“You’re not getting this at all,” Draco said.  “It’s probably because you don’t have a dad—I guess it’s good you had a mum, then, who made you famous.  It doesn’t matter whether people are
At last finding what he was looking for, Draco took a pinch of the powder and threw it in the hearth.  Green flames erupted in the dark fireplace, and Draco bent his head into them.  “Malfoy Manor!”
Draco turned to look at him then, his face so pale in the dark.  His hand came up, hesitated, then brushed aside the fringe over Harry’s forehead, revealing the scar.
Harry demonstrated the rest of the holds with Fuentes, then stopped Malfoy before he left for his next class. “See me during office hours,” Harry told Malfoy.
Draco was going on, “I always thought that—that I could stop.  But I never could.  And now . . . she’s in hospital, and I just . . . she’s not even going to know, if I’m careful, if people don’t find out.  I thought—if I was discreet enough—” Harry winced—“I could make her be happy, and I could have what I need as well.”
“No,” Draco said, snatching the phial, but then he had it in his hand and he was lying flat on his back, an impossible angle to drink the potion.
“Harry Potter.  Is he okay?”  The man reached for his back pocket, and Harry saw that Mister Malfoy tensed, but the man only brought out a piece of paper and unfolded it.  “I got this by owl, see,” the man said, “but there was nothing else on it.”
Just outside the anti-Apparition wards, Crowley Stott Library was an archive for the Ministry as well as a resource for the Academy. The central corridor of the massive stone building was lit only by the reading room at the top of the main staircase at the end of the hall, making the large space cool and cavernous. The Memory Wing, however, featured floor-to-ceiling cathedral windows, spilling morning light into a clean, spacious room, the shelves of memories in their glass vials reflecting that light until the whole room felt shining with silver memory and golden sun. The Pensieves stood on pedestals, one in front of each window, with partitions between the windows in case the viewings needed to be private. Velvet curtains could be drawn to close the booths off completely.
“Do you?” Closing his eyes, Harry leaned back against the tree. “I used to think I knew what people were capable of. What was good or just or right. I tried my hardest. I gave up—everything, to do what I thought was right. I think that I did well.”
he cared about something, he wouldn’t have such a problem casting a Patronus, and then he wouldn’t be failing. Anyway, Malfoy’s failed exam was absolutely the least of Harry’s concerns just now.
Fairchild believed that first non-magborn witches and wizards should come out to their non-mag families and friends, which would ease the way for the broader revelation of the Wizarding World. Wan argued this would put non-magborn witches and wizards at risk—non-mags had armies, weapons, and reasons to fear magic. Achar argued that Reveal should begin with dropping wards in a single small wizarding town, such as Hogsmeade, again allowing a smaller reveal before wider exposure. The bald woman pointed out that the problem was the same: Hogsmeade would be vulnerable to non-mags who feared magic.
is ridiculously biased.  If I have to read one more think-piece in which someone slobbers all over that Mudblood Granger, I’ll seriously consider self-Crucio as a better life choice.”
Travers looked rather smug at this, his slit of a mouth slipping into a smirk, his eyes reflecting the shining light from the ballroom. “I think you’ll find us quite sophisticated.”
Malfoy stopped, turned, looked at him with that still gaze, the silver one that Harry felt went right through him. “Instructor Potter?”
“Oh!” Penelope’s face immediately broke into an expression of concern. “Of course! Are you sick? Do you want me to call Gareth? We could—”
“If you must know,” Malfoy said, even though no one had said anything to him, “I’m failing half my classes.” Malfoy was walking around the crowd toward Harry, but no one seemed to pay him any mind.
“That’s my good boy.” Draco went down again, and Harry cried out—whether from the hotness of those words or the hotness of Draco’s mouth, Harry couldn’t tell. Draco popped off again. “That’s it, Harry. I’m going to take you in and I want you to use it. Use it, Harry. Just fuck it like hot, wet, pussy that really needs to be fucked.”
Apparition with Ward Bores had to be precise. If the Aurors didn’t Apparate to the exact location of the holes created by the Bores, they could splinch themselves within the Anti-Apparition wards, which would certainly compromise the mission. Therefore, in order to Apparate, the Aurors had to physically see the Ward Bores. That meant that Malfoy had to place the five Bores in such a way that he would be able to look at all five at once. Furthermore, each Ward Bore was a different colour, each colour assigned to a different Auror, so no two Aurors would Apparate to the same spot.
Hermione’s scowl faded, but her eyes were still sharp, appraising. These were her politician eyes, not her friendly Hermione eyes. Harry loved them just as much. “Okay,” she said slowly.
As though sensing their gazes, Malfoy turned toward them. Waving, he turned back to Rune, touching Rune’s arm, then leaning in for a quick kiss.
“I had Ron and Hermione.” Then, even though Harry knew it was cruel, he added, “And your parents did leave you.”
“Potentially,” Draco said, taking out some green moss.  “Would you sort this, Harry?  Take out all the brown bits, and then try to make it flat.”  Harry took the moss, and Draco went on spelling jars over to the workbench.  “Ideally, we’d like to grow you to the age you should be, right here in this present moment.  That way, you remember everything that happened right up to the moment the potion fell on you, as well as what happened after it.”
September passed in a blaze of bright blue skies full of leaf stars, bursting into supernovae of yellow, red, and orange. Harry’s new therapist was an American woman named Alexis Milligan, who had moved to the UK to be with her husband three years prior. A tall, thin woman with blond hair and brown eyes, Doctor Milligan seemed to Harry very American, with her very large earrings and very large voice.
Malfoy could be lying, of course, but he really didn’t seem as though he thought anyone else might have tried to support his passing Level One into Level Two. Harry, however, was a little too distracted to be relieved about it. “Stop that,” he said, pulling the Veritascope out of Malfoy’s hand. “Why are you always—poking things?”
“The powder.”  Harry really should have extracted himself from Malfoy’s arms, which were still around him, but he couldn’t find the wherewithal to do it.  It must have been the powder.  “It’s an aphrodisiac.  A love potion.  Something like that.”
Harry turned. Malfoy’s hand was on the door knob, his expression knit with some inner conflict. At last, it seemed to smooth out. “You know you saved the world, right?” Malfoy said. “I mean, not just the one time. Over and over.”
Harry entered, something settling inside him as he took in the familiar surroundings: the overstuffed chair, Kavika’s table with her coffee instruments, the window with its tree. “I’m sorry,” Harry said, turning back to Kavika. “Is there anything I can do?”
He could touch Draco’s thighs—Draco’s lean, hard long thighs—so Harry did it, settling his hands on Draco’s trousers and stroking up to Draco’s arse, then again. Harry tried to remember the last time someone had straddled him like this; he couldn’t. He tried to remember the last time someone’s thighs had made him feel this way—Ginny. He wanted to do things to them. He wanted to fuck them.
“Turn over,” Draco said, yanking on Harry’s hip. Harry turned over, and Draco grabbed the toy. “Get that thing away,” he said, tossing it on the floor, where it continued to thrust. Fumbling, Draco found his wand, then Banished it. Then he Banished his clothes. All of them.
Harry wanted to tell Draco that he didn’t hate him.  He wanted—he wanted Draco to hug him again.  Harry wondered whether he should try hugging him himself.  He wondered whether he would have hugged his dad.
Draco must have misinterpreted the expression, because as Harry watched, Draco’s face began to contort with its old rage.  Suddenly, he sat up straight.
Kavika pressed her lips together, her steady mouth, her steady eyes, her steady smile. “And you don’t think that uncertainty could ever cause anxiety?”
“Don’t . . .”  Malfoy shuddered, then took several shallow breaths, not looking at him.  “Don’t say those things.  With your voice.  Those things you—don’t do words.”
“Yes.” Harry tried scraping his teeth a bit along Draco’s throat. “I’ll do anything. Anything you want me to.”
The bag didn’t have mouse ears at all, and Harry realized Draco was teasing him.  The teasing didn’t feel mean, however, and when Harry went over the with the treats, Heloise took a bit of dried meat out of Harry’s hand quickly, without touching him with her beak at all.  Glancing back at Draco, Harry reached out his hand toward Heloise’s head.  “Can I?”
Twenty minutes later, the wards alerted Harry that something was moving through them.  Harry had to call back the owl and take away the notes Draco had written.  “Goyle is in Azkaban,” Harry explained to Draco.  Goyle had got off in the post-war trials with a magical restriction, just like Draco, but he’d broken it two years in and been arrested.  After he’d been released he’d done it again and been arrested again.  “Crabbe is dead.”
“I hope I’ve at least got fucked by then.  Wouldn’t it be sad to go through all this, and still be a virgin.”
“Ameles. Use sparingly, never more than once per month. More effective when the moon is waning. Unlike Sweet Dreams, does not take hours to work; will drop you instantly, but do beware that, rather like Dreamless, the sleep is not of high quality. Unlike Dreamless, allows precision in timing—one drop equals approximately fifteen minutes of slumber. Also unlike Dreamless, you do not feel forced awake when wears off; if still sleepy, one may sleep another good eight hours with Ameles only fuelling the first fifteen minutes. Do beware of—”
When Draco stood, however, Harry watched, making sure Draco moved all right, that no other lasting damage had been done.  Draco appeared to have healed as he should, walking without trouble, and Harry looked away again, waiting until Draco had grabbed the clothes, gone into the loo, and started the tap.
“For fuck’s sake, Malfoy,” Harry said, angrier than he had thought he could be at Malfoy’s homophobia and his obvious memory of that stupid fucking kiss.  “I’m not going to molest you.”
Harry wished he’d been made for him. He wanted to be nothing other than this moment, this moment in which he was loved and adored with this warm person on top of him who liked him well enough to say such a thing. Squeezing Draco’s arse again, Harry said hoarsely, “Say it again.”
Harry wanted to tell Draco he shouldn’t have to keep reading books a secret.  He wanted to make this version of Draco feel that way adult-Draco had made Harry feel, when Harry was a child, when Draco had hugged him and said,
Mister Malfoy smiled a bit without looking like he wanted to smile at all, and Harry guessed he probably shouldn’t have said that.  “You always told the truth in school,” Mister Malfoy said.  “Even when no one believed you.  Even when—when people hurt you for it.  You always told the truth.”
“Yes.”  For the first time, Andromeda’s voice gentled.  “You must understand, Harry; he was very young.  His parents both were Death Eaters, and he wasn’t given a lot of options.”
A wave of fresh air brushed Harry’s face, and suddenly Harry could feel space on either side of him. When he looked to his left, Adebayo was still sitting there. He hadn’t moved, and yet now there was an inch between them in the booth. He was still talking, as though he hadn’t even noticed. The fresh air puffed over Harry again, as though through an open door or window, and Harry looked up to find it.
Harry moved behind Draco’s ear now, along his hairline, down below his ear and against his throat. “I like it when you’re worked up,” he murmured. Hand looser now around Draco’s dick, Harry stroked it slowly—an agonizing speed he would never have wanted for himself.
Andromeda stared at him.  “I’ll make a pot of tea.”  Spinning on her heel, she went off down the hall, her white nightgown twirling away.
“Suit yourself,” Sibanyoni said, taking a biscuit for himself before shuffling over to a great big chair full of cushions. Sibanyoni was a small man, his head gone bald, his nose large, his little goatee quite silver. He seemed older than Kavika, but Harry thought he couldn’t be that much older, given that they had gone to school together. Sibanyoni had a way of moving that was slow and just a little laboured, and a twinkle in his eye that reminded Harry of Dumbledore—what Harry remembered of Dumbledore, after all this time. Somehow the portrait didn’t capture that particular sparkle. “I did a five-kilometre run this morning,” Sibanyoni said, abruptly shattering every impression Harry had had of him up to that very second. “I need to get back calories.”
“Thirty-two years old.  And that scar.  Merlin’s beard!”  Malfoy snapped his fingers.  “You’re Harry Potter!”
Draco turned back to him again.  “And do you . . .” He hesitated, licking his lips.  “Do other people know?  That I’m a swot, I mean.  I don’t go around—reading, do I?”
Malfoy pulled the dressing gown tighter about himself, concealing the offending pyjamas.  “Did you have a potion for me to ID, or did you come to admire me in my nightclothes?”
“I don’t want her to know I resorted to shagging Muggles, because I needed cock just that badly?  Not particularly.”  Draco reached for another slide, and Harry was beginning to think the microscope was just an excuse, so Draco wouldn’t have to look at him.  “I told you not to sound disappointed,” he went on.  “I tried something.  It didn’t work.”
Harry rolled his eyes.  “Stop fussing, Malfoy.  You’re the only one making a big deal out of it.  Just pretend it never happened.”
The trainees began to move—Bennet and Wan forming a pair, Moskowitz and Fairchild, Achar and Fuentes, all the expected pairs—except for Malfoy, who was still just standing about. He looked like he might not have moved since Harry had told him to warm-up. His eyes were still fixed on Harry.
“Yes, Harry.” Draco let go of Harry’s bollocks immediately, warm hand once more wrapping around Harry’s cock, but the fingernail was back, scraping directly over his slit.
For the final exam, each trainee was to break a high-level curse from an object. Usually these objects were obtained by Harry from the Department of Ministries, though if trainees were able to identify dark objects that had not yet been collected and aid the Ministry in the collection, they could get extra credit for breaking the curse. This only counted if the dark object had existed significantly before the trainee had enrolled in the Academy, as Harry certainly didn’t want anyone to create dark objects just to pass his class.
“He’s growing up! Spreading his wings! Leaving the nest!” she had told Harry, when Harry had come for a Sunday brunch and she hadn’t been able to say where Teddy was.
“Oh, dear,” said Doctor Yin, observing that no surface was unoccupied, much less any chairs. Taking out their wand, they Banished a pile of parchment, a vase of fish, and a skull out of a bowl chair. “You can sit there,” they said, then somehow made their way beside the leopard, around what must be a table under piles and piles of scrolls, to another chair. This chair had a big mullioned window behind it, half covered with a fringed tapestry curtain. Doctor Yin sank into it. “I’m sorry. You’re thinking, ‘what kind of therapist is this’? That’s what I think, most days.”
Harry thought about A-bombs and Lucius Malfoy’s repression—presented to his son as a kindness—and the fact that Draco apparently despised his younger self.  Alarmed, Harry tried to remember whether Draco had said any of those awful things in the ledger—but no, they’d only been in the letter.  “What does?”
Second year.  Harry remembered fighting a basilisk, brewing Polyjuice, attending a party of ghosts.  He remembered meeting Dobby, Dumbledore getting kicked out, Colin Creevey turning to stone.  Harry tried to remember Draco.  There was a Quidditch match, trying to figure out whether Malfoy was Slytherin’s heir.  Draco calling Hermione a Mudblood.
“I best get back,” said the terrier, because talking through a Patronus split concentration, and Ron undoubtedly had others to check on.
Then the next person must have stepped up, because the room was bright again, and a dozen or so rats were scurrying about the room.
“I don’t know why the Board is willing to look the other way,” Harry said. “Maybe they’re trying to hide the problem so that funding from mixed blood and non-magicalborns doesn’t get withdrawn.” Harry went on, putting his mouth close to the mic again, creating the ugly reverb. “Or maybe, they’re signalling to Old Blood that blood purists are welcome here.”
Harry wanted to cast his Patronus again, but he had to make sure Nyala was okay. “Your parents aren’t lifting the wards?”
“Her name is Heloise,” the man said, as though having an owl on his shoulder was a perfectly normal thing.  “Would you like to pet her?”
“How dare you?” Fudge fumed, then Greengrass retorted. Bickford tried to calm them, and Pillwickle said something about Malfoy, and Harry couldn’t hear.
“Yes.  But father . . .”  Draco shifted, as though to relieve the pressure on his arm, but he still didn’t put it around Harry.  Disappointed, Harry stopped pressing in.  “He didn’t like Dumbledore.”
Harry waited in the lab outside the bedroom for five minutes, then ten.  “Draco?” he called, knocking on the door.
The view in the IC:WUT/UC tipped down to look at the unconscious man. “Do they always do this?” Malfoy asked.
“No,” Harry said quickly.  “The Dark Lord didn’t kill her.  She—it was . . .”  But then Harry didn’t know what to say, because the
Harry struggled to remember whether Malfoy had ever talked about what he had wanted to be when he grew up but could not recall.  At Hogwarts Malfoy had always been talking.  He’d said a lot of things, but Harry had learned early on not to listen.
Harry wondered whether he should tell Mister Malfoy about the chocolate streaked on his face.  Probably he could feel it.  Pointing his wand at a puddle of hot chocolate, Harry tried the cleaning spell.  The chocolate sucked into his wand too, but when Harry checked it, it didn’t drip or anything.  “
Harry didn’t know this spell, but it came and made space inside him, stretching him not with pressure but with emptiness. It was almost shocking, how empty he felt, the muscles of his rim suddenly too lax, the tightness inside too loose. He felt as though he’d already been fingered, and the fingers had just been swiftly removed. “Oh,” Harry heard himself say, and his voice was small.
His face had gone livid, just after Harry had been thinking that his face wasn’t as pasty as it had been.  It had filled out a bit since that first time Harry had seen him here, and even if it was still thin and yes, pale, he still had the same features he’d had in school.  Where Harry hadn’t realized he was good-looking.  Twisted with anger as it was now, Malfoy’s face didn’t look so good.  Harry forgot what he’d been about to say.
“He’s afraid of your Patronus?” one of the trainees asked, but Harry ignored it, busying himself with Accio’ing the boggart and putting it in its trunk, so no one would have to see how red his face had got.
to force you to leave. But maybe it’s time you took a moment and thought about what you really want. Maybe you’ll find you—”
“Yes,” Draco said, waggling the wand toward Harry’s face.  “But my wand is your friend, and mine’s already Lumos’ed, so you don’t have to cast one.  My Lumos is really good.”
“They don’t want to see me,” Harry had said at the time, but eventually he’d found that the reason he felt that way was he thought they couldn’t want to see him. Then he’d found that he thought he wasn’t worth seeing, for reasons unknown to himself, for reasons that had to do with being an orphan, maybe, or the fact that Mum, Dad, Sirius, and Lupin had all died.
“And how are we?” she said brightly as Harry sat down in a very sleek chair in front of a very sleek desk, where Doctor Milligan was tapping her wand over again at a long paper on her desk.
Before Harry could formulate a reply, Malfoy left the room, leaving Harry alone with his cool window and his thoughts.
“No,” said Kavika, “we won’t. If that tree was a symbol of this institution, does not the fact that a person was trapped inside of it for a millennia suggest that something is deeply troubled within the institution itself? The tree should not be replanted; the rot of it should be remembered and honoured.”
, Harry thought, like a bubble popping in his brain. Somehow, Harry had almost forgot—maybe because the thought didn’t embarrass him as keenly as it had at first. Malfoy had stopped flirting, after the Patronus, and he’d begun trying harder in class. With the hols, Harry had had time to get over it. Maybe Malfoy would too. New year, new leaf, and all that.
The memory was so nice Harry sort of wanted to fall asleep that way again, but that was weird.  People didn’t hold you in their arms when you were as old as Harry was; only babies needed to be held, and that was because they couldn’t walk.  And Uncle Vernon was always saying to Dudley that big boys didn’t need to get cuddled either—even though Petunia was cuddling Dudley all the time, but that was because Petunia was annoying, and Dudley was horribly spoiled.  It was weird to want someone to touch you, but Harry couldn’t help wishing Draco had made the chair a sofa.  Then he could just sit
Harry couldn’t hear. He could hear, but no one was saying anything. He couldn’t see, but he could. The light was entering his eyes and giving him the pictures. He couldn’t
Taking the wand, the man seemed to look it over.  “Harry Potter’s got his eye on you,” he said, handing the wand back to Harry.  “Don’t even think about causing trouble.”
Draco waved his wand again, extinguishing the fire.  “Mum used to do this spell for me at night,” Draco said, looking up at the stars.  Their light made his face look pale in the dark room.  “Her side of the family all has celestial names.”
With all of his moping about the house, Harry should have been happy to get back to Academy, and he was, mostly, but the weather was cold and rainy, and he didn’t like mornings, and his coffee was burnt, and three different instructors stopped him on the way in, and one of them was Spragg.
“Er,” Harry said, since he wasn’t sure if it was a compliment.  Draco’s voice didn’t exactly sound like it was, but it didn’t sound like it wasn’t either.  “Thanks.”
have voted Conceal.” Vinicius was about to rant, and this had always been fun. Despising everything Robards stood for was something they had always both had in common, even if Vinicius
“Living homeless, snatching crusts of bread from rubbish bins, that sort of thing.”  Draco went on idly doodling over the book, which was slowly repairing itself.
The woman’s eyes snapped down to Harry, then she took a swift step toward him.  “What—” she stopped as quickly as she had begun.  “That’s not Teddy.”
“Harry,” Draco said again.  Reaching out, he brushed aside Harry’s fringe again.  He’d done that before, as though to see his scar.  Harry thought it was nice, because his scar was cool even though Petunia said it was so ugly, but he didn’t know why Draco wanted to see it all the time, and just now it made him uncomfortable.  “Harry,” Draco said again.  “Nothing you do is wrong.”
“Petrificus Totalus!” The spell missed, and Harry whirled back to Teddy, who was gone. After a moment, Harry spied him in front of Gringotts. Disapparating, Harry caught up to him. “Teddy!”
Malfoy’s wand slashed across Harry’s vision, ending the amplification spell on the wireless inside the pub. Abruptly focusing, Harry met Malfoy’s eyes.
“The comparison to Grindelwald was uncalled for,” said Pillwickle, “but it’s true we put Vulnerables at risk by exposing our world to them.”
As he did so, Harry caught sight of a slender box on the bedside table.  It seemed like it had to be electronic, seeing as how a cord was coming out of it, attached to something behind the table.  It was the first electronic thing Harry had seen in the house, besides maybe the hand mixer.  “What is it?” Harry asked, pressing the button on the front.  A picture filled the black space on the top of the box—a brown-haired girl and a red-haired man.
After a while, Harry came back upstairs.  Draco was in the burned chair, a book on his lap.  “Give me back my wand,” he said, as Harry crossed through the sitting-room.
“I—what?”  Draco’s attitude of nonchalance dropped right off, which made Harry smile.  Sometimes, when they were both older, Harry could see cracks in the façade Draco seemed to show to the world, but at eleven Draco was so completely obvious.  His eyes were large, as though hungry to hear of something clever he had done.
Mister Malfoy shouldn’t get to avoid the subject.  After all, he had brought it up, so Harry just shrugged.  “Not really.”
“I’m just sorry I didn’t figure it out before Vance got to me,” Ron said.  “That Imperius potion was some powerful stuff.”
to be in charge. They’re meant to have the power to change things, but they don’t want to change anything. Nothing ever changes, even if—don’t you think it should have been different? When Kingsley was Head Auror? And now he’s Minister for Magic, and that should be it, isn’t it? Someone like him, someone who fought in the war, someone who was in the Order of the Phoenix. It should be enough to end blood purism. But it’s not. We’re almost as divided as when Voldemort took the Ministry.”
“Then don’t be in our bubble.” Malfoy ate another chip. “Have you had anything to eat, Instructor Potter?”
expectations.”  Draco put his nose up, even though the rest of him was slumped against the side of the couch.
.  You were right; it can be—fun.  But it’s not the be-all, end-all of my existence.  In fact, I’ve discovered, it’s farther down on the list than I thought.”
“Go away.”  Malfoy’s back was still turned, but every part of him radiated displeasure, from the set of his shoulders to the fist by his thigh.
But whatever, Draco had got Harry a present.  Even though books were boring, Harry had had very few presents before, and the idea that Draco had got it for him made him feel a bit overwhelmed.  “I haven’t got one for you.”
Harry’s smile ventured into a real one, but he looked back down at his hand again, reading the words Umbridge had made him etch there with her quill. “Something happened.”
“If you played with an advantage,” Draco went on, “we could be more even.  Let’s try it this way.  You can cast offensive spells on me, but I can’t on you.  I know plenty of good ones; I’ll teach them to you.”
“I just meant,” Harry went on, “that after the war . . . it didn’t matter so much if people thought non-mags were helpless idiots. Even if the Death Eaters didn’t get what they deserved, all of them knew it was a very bad idea to go about massacring or enslaving or touting any Grinde-mort type theories. But now with Reveal . . . It was what Grindelwald wanted, right? His whole thing was he wanted to end the Statute.”
Shit.  Harry didn’t know what had happened to Goyle’s house, or Crabbe’s, but Draco was already rattling off other names.
Draco wouldn’t even have got the idea, Harry realized, if Harry hadn’t given it to him.  Knowingly entering into a dangerous situation had never been child-Draco’s idea of fun.  It hadn’t been Harry’s either, exactly, only it had never once deterred him.
“He won’t help you,” Harry said.  “You tormented him for two years.  He’s had seven to think about getting back at you.  You know how smart he is, how creative.  You know what he could do to you.”
Draco looked as if his aversion to suffering was warring with his arrogance.  “What about Severus?” he said finally.  “Did I talk to him?”
Harry turned to Penelope, who so far, hadn’t joined in the argument. He could tell she was about to, so he took her arm, his voice low, urgent. “Did you say the Board was meeting right now?”
Taking another sip of juice to wash down the rest of the scone, Harry swallowed again.  “Like a witch?”
Draco cleaned Harry’s plate with a tap of his wand, then charmed a large slice of the tart onto it.  Then he cast a spell on it that Harry didn’t know and added a scoop of cream.  When Harry tried it, the tart was warm, the cream was cold, and if he hadn’t decided it before, he would have decided then and there that magic was really wonderful, and so was Draco.
,” Draco said, sinking against the shelves.  “I’m not a poof.”  Then he was on the ground, knees up with his arms wrapped around them.  His wand was still clenched tightly in his hand.  Heloise fluffed her feathers, unsettled, then opened up her great wings to make the awkward flaps that closed the distance between her and Draco.
“Why do you care, Potter?” Greengrass’s voice was a whisper, the insidious mist that crept inside your bones on a winter’s morning. “What is he to you?”
This story was written for buildyourwalls, who donated an incredible sum to charity for it to be written. This story would not exist without her. Buildyourwalls, I'm only sorry it's taken me over two years to complete this monstrosity. Thank you for your patience and your generosity.
“You already did.” It was the only thing Malfoy had said the whole class that was not a spell. He kept on walking back to his seat.
Above them, the sky lit in a burst of gold firecracker, filling the sky with a glowing light that shone on Hermione’s face, tilted up, and in Ron’s hair, blazing just like fire.
“I should imagine so.”  Mister Malfoy smiled faintly again.  He still didn’t look happy about it, but it was a better smile than before.  “I always admired how honest you were.  I . . . never told you that before.”
Teddy slowly nodded, but then even as he was still nodding, he said, “Don’t we always have a choice?”
Once Harry was closer, he could see that Malfoy had gone pale, but for the point of colour high on either cheeks. His eyes were bright, but he was trembling, ill-contained by the straight set of his shoulders. Harry wanted to hold him; he wanted to soothe him. He wanted to kiss him until Malfoy saw stars, until Malfoy couldn’t think straight. He wanted to feel Malfoy’s hands, his body, his tongue, his teeth, his hips, his cock, his back, his thighs.
In response to demands of the press and large sector of the wizarding population, the Board had agreed to expel Travers for his harassment of Fairchild, but so far they had neglected to press any criminal charges. Fairchild herself had been looking into the possibility of doing so, but wizarding law surrounding crimes of Aurors was complicated, and currently the Auror Department was claiming that as a trainee, Travers should be considered an Auror for all intents and purposes.
Draco’s face went a bit pale, his eyes beginning to flash, and now Harry recognized Draco’s anger when he saw it.  “That whole bit about being friends—that was a lie as well?  You didn’t tell me about my
“Ten years before you. There are four witch-wizards in the world, Harry. Don’t forget.” Yin sipped their smoothie.
“Which is why I can’t risk you,” Harry said.  “If you were hurt when you’re eleven, I won’t have thirty-two-year-old you to help me anymore.”
Thank you to icmezzo and seraphcelene for writing with me. Thank you to siemejay. Readers, you have siemejay in particular to thank for all the best bits of this chapter. Her frank assessment really helped me when I was struggling, and I ended up rewriting vast portions of it to make it what it is now, which is better than it was before. Thank you for everything you did for me on this story, siemejay.
“You think I’m focusing on Bennet instead of my—my own problems. But sometimes it benefits me. I don’t always want to think about—about . . .”
“Mini beef wellingtons and spring salad,” Draco said, taking a blanket out of the basket and spreading it out with his wand.  Glancing at Harry as he spelled more items out of the basket, he smiled.  “No need to look so disappointed.  You don’t have to eat the salad, and I brought treacle tart for afters.”
Malfoy wasn’t full on crying, but Harry thought if maybe Malfoy did return some of his feelings—or maybe was just remembering them, how intense they had been—maybe this would hurt a lot, or feel unkind. Harry regretted that, but he didn’t regret telling Malfoy. It took a certain kind of courage, he realized, to tell someone you loved them without expecting that they would love you back, but there was a freedom in it too. You could love enough that you could love any choice that other person made, and feel some solace in it as long as they were happy.
flannel,” Harry said, setting the dittany aside.  Casting a quick wetting spell, Harry began cleaning the blood that had already come out, keeping his eye on Draco’s arm.  The scabs faded in colour—brown, then tan, then the pale colour of Draco’s skin.  Then they were scars.
Harry sighed.  “Yes, your highness?” he said, because he was too tired to deal with Malfoy acting like a twat.
“I don’t like it at all, Harry.  I wish I could take it off, but—it’s a part of my body, now, and so a part of me.”
If Teddy hadn’t asked, Harry probably would have spent the night alone, despite the significance of the occasion. Hermione was in session for the vote, and Ron was in audience as one of the few special guests allowed. Vinicius was at the Leaky with most of the rest of the Force, though obviously, a few of the Aurors had come to the Higgledy Piggledy.
For a minute Harry was lost in it, the mindless fucking, hungry sucking; he just wanted to suck and suck while the toy pounded his arse like an insatiable cock using him for its pleasure. He was only just noticing his jaw becoming tired, his insides so close to orgasm but not achieving it that he was beginning to ache in not a good way, when suddenly the toy slowed—still fucking him, but gentler now, shallower. Immediately Harry missed that hard fucking, whining at the lost of it. A warm hand cupped his cheek. “That’s enough now, Harry,” Draco murmured.
“Don’t have a choice. He leaves them on my desk. The first one, I didn’t know it was him. The second one—I poured it out. But after that.” Harry gave her a speaking look. “I can’t go about pouring out coffees. It isn’t right.”
Getting off the bed, Draco went over to the clothes, picking up the dress shirt with two fingers, as though it were covered in slime.  “Hideous.  Exactly what I’d expect from you.  Well—are you going to watch me change, or what?”
Harry didn’t want to talk about Reveal. The whole thing made him anxious, but it was obviously important, and suddenly he noticed how tired Hermione looked. For a moment, Harry felt guilty—he shouldn’t have been so focused on his own problems, but then he remembered he hadn’t. He’d practiced flying with Rose and made a potion (badly) with Hugo and helped make supper, and only after the kids were put to bed and Hermione and Ron had asked about work had Harry told them about Malfoy. Hermione and Ron wanted to know, he reminded himself. Harry wasn’t bothering them with his problems—they had asked.
“No,” Harry said again, his impatience growing. “I mean, I don’t think there’s just one person out there that can—I loved Ginny. She was—everything to me, and I was to her, but—but it was fucked up. I mean, what if she’s ‘the one?’ What would be the point?”
Harry kissed him again. “I love you.” He put his hand in Malfoy’s. “I’ll come with you. Let’s go save the world.”
Hermione pressed her lips together in the teasing, clever little smile she gave just to him and Ron. “Don’t want to talk about how Malfoy is in love with you?”
Draco beamed.  “I said, no ‘laughing!’  From now on, only serious spells!”  Then he pointed his wand at himself again.  “
“You have a good heart, Harry.  That’s what matters.  When I know you, you want to help people.  You want to help everyone, all the time, and you don’t stop.  You never stop caring about people, and trying to help, even though not—not enough people have cared for you.”
“You want to know why I broke up with Rune? You want to know why I can’t have other romantic relationships? You want to know why my Pensieve is full of you and why I can’t sleep at night and why half of the time won’t come near you and why just a look from you, just a word, is something I live on for hours, days, weeks, why summer is torture and I don’t
Malfoy extracted his hand, going a little pink. Maybe he was embarrassed by fitting in with pure-bloods, or maybe Malfoy was just pleased by anyone saying he had done well, which was interesting. Harry had assumed it was only his own praise that made Malfoy blush.
“Whatever,” Draco said, sounding more like he had when he was thirteen than he did when he was thirty-two.  “I’ve nothing better to do.”
“Are you sure?” Harry remembered a time he had attempted a demonstration of hand-to-hand with Malfoy, and Malfoy had been nothing but uncomfortable.
Draco smiled, again making the face seem almost nice.  “I have no doubt of that, Harry.  Let’s go, shall we?”
“That means it’s working.  Stop squirming.”  Mister Malfoy did a little swirl with the stick.  The tingling stopped, and Mister Malfoy turned to make another note.
“Hullo, Travers,” Harry said, trying not to sound like he hated the idea of having to talk to anyone.
Something exactly like the Academy, which had a course on Magical Ethics, but didn’t even have Non-Magical Studies.
“I’m not a very nice person,” Draco said, taking the metal bowl over to one of the black pots hanging on the bar over one of the hearths.  The rim of the bowl lined up with the rim of the pot so that when Draco set the bowl on top, the bowl balanced perfectly on top of the pot and didn’t fall in.
Not finished with breakfast yet, Harry was still stuffing toast with jam in his mouth.  “Where?” he said, his mouth full of crust.
Harry rubbed his scar some more. Realized he was doing it, stopped. Then started again. “I keep thinking about . . . I’m not sure anymore.  About the Academy.”
“What really happened to my parents?” Harry asked.  He’d been wondering about it since Draco had kept asking him about them the night before, and talking about their families reminded him.
“But what . . .”  The woman—Andromeda—took another step forward.  Harry had heard the name before, somewhere.
Draco rolled his eyes.  “Naturally, she sent me chocolates.  It’s my favourite—I just mean, she stopped dressing me up like her little doll.” He added quickly, “Not that she ever—she didn’t
Vance was also responsible for Imperiusing Savage.  Though Savage had ignored some of the hints that various illegal brews cases were connected, when evidence was shoved directly under her nose, she’d gone to Robards.  Robards had passed the evidence onto Mysteries, but Savage hadn’t dropped the case, and that was when Vance had begun to use the Imperius potion on her as well.  When Harry had been out for a week following the transfer of Lorica Ludville out of Azkaban, Vance had grown worried that Harry had figured something out.  He had sent Savage to the Auror Office to search Harry’s files to find out when he knew, which was when Draco Polyjuiced as Harry and Harry Polyjuiced as Draco had encountered her.
He had dressed posh for his advancement to Level Two, Harry realized. “I thought using spells to undress was rude,” he said instead.
Harry was loud, louder than he’d ever been from touching himself, and the orgasm felt like it ripped through him forever. He kept catching glimpses of Draco’s rising prick, and it made him come harder, and then the dildo eased inside again, and he thrust back into it.
“He deserved to die.”  Andromeda put her cup down.  “Do you know how many innocent people Voldemort and his Death Eaters slaughtered?  We can pretend to be nice and claim that there are two sides to everything, that everyone deserves mercy and forgiveness, or we can face the reality that sometimes it’s necessary to make tough choices to bring about a better world.”
“Potter,” Malfoy said.  “Fuck, Potter.”  And then Malfoy’s lips were softly pulling on Harry’s lower lip, drawing it into Malfoy’s mouth—hot and wet and soft and oh.
Harry stumbled over his own feet, gripping the cabinet for balance, knocking over one of the bottles inside.
Inexplicably, Harry felt hope brimming up inside him. Doctor Yin seemed like they might finally be the one.
Harry looked up at her again, her round face, gorgeous skin, her dark eyes wreathed by her dark lashes. “Like I had done something terrible.”
Now Draco wanted him.  Harry could feel that Draco wanted him, because Draco’s lips were sucking his, then his teeth were nipping Harry’s bottom lip, causing Harry to gasp in surprise.  Then Draco’s tongue was darting in, slipping along the underside of Harry’s upper lip, then pulling away, teasing, as Draco’s mouth closed over Harry’s and apparently had its way with him.  Harry was not at all a talented kisser, just a very dedicated one, but Draco was good at it—unexpected and surprising, causing Harry to gasp and fall back and then lean forward, trying to catch the flash of tongue he’d missed.  Fuck.
Malfoy had five Bores, which would allow five Aurors to infiltrate the NDE meeting at Windermere Hall. They would only Apparate, however, once evidence of criminal activity had been secured, either through Malfoy’s Insight Contacts or Hearing Raid. Malfoy was also wearing a Whisper Wire, which was a small ring inside his ear, charmed with a spell that linked it to a separate Wire in the Auror Department. This separate Wire was Harry’s. When he spoke into it, Malfoy would hear Harry’s voice in his ear. The Insight Contacts, shaped like contacts and fitting over the eyes, were magically linked to a large glass dome, called the Insight Contact: Wizard Unifying Transmitter/Uber Conductor—IC:WUT/UC for short—which would show them what Malfoy saw. The Hearing Raid was an Extendable Ear Spello-taped under Malfoy’s shirt. The other half of the Extendable Ear was linked to a gramophone horn in the Auror Department, so everyone could hear what Malfoy heard.
“No, you’re right.” Ron had a hip on the edge of his own desk, fiddling with the quills. “Don’t suppose him fancying you would make a difference. You always feel responsible for everyone regardless.”
So far, Kavika and Kingsley had centred the work of the Order around helping non-magborn magical people reveal the magical world to their non-magical families. The hope was that this work would ease the way for Reveal, as all the conversations about non-magborns coming out as magical to their families had been integral to the Deal. Kingsley had demanded protections for non-magborns, as they stood to be most vulnerable as a result of Reveal, but the other side had argued the non-magborns had more protection than most, as they already had non-magical families that loved them. This argument conveniently ignored the fact that many non-magborns never told their families about their powers, or were forced to Obliviate family members to maintain the Statute.
“Robards is having him process the paperwork for the whole department,” Harry had explained, trying to be patient.
“Who knows what he would do?” Harry asked, turning back to look at Ron. “He got his friends to dress up with him like Dementors just to scare me. He spent half of fourth year making badges about my—my personal odour.”
“No,” Harry said steadily.  “I said my mum defeated him.  And then he came back again—on the back of Quirrell’s head.  Then he came back again and opened the Chamber of Secrets.  And then he came back for real fourth year.”
Harry thought Draco might kiss his scar again, but he didn’t.  Instead, he stood up, picking up the potion bottle.  “We best get to it, Harry.”
“Yes.  Yes, of course.”  Turning, Draco pointed his wand at the jar broken on the floor, murmuring the incantation to repair it.  Gathering itself together, the glass cracked back into shape, though the lovely clear insect wings were still all over the ground.  Pointing his wand at those, too, Draco spelled them into the jar, then put the jar back on the bench.  After picking up the beaker of muddy slime, he turned back to Harry.  “I’ve laid out clothes for you on the bed.  Remember to change into them first.  Then you can add this,” Draco said, showing Harry a single golden hair, “and drink up.”
Draco opened the door, looking gorgeous and miserable all at once.  His skin was pale, lips chapped, eye rimmed with red, as though he had been crying—but his size was good.  He was no longer gaunt at all, similar in shape to the Draco that Harry remembered, except that he wasn’t.  Harry knew what age this was.  “Your mum,” he said.
“We haven’t talked about Draco Malfoy very much,” said Kavika. She was a wide woman with greying black hair, which she usually kept tied in a messy knot at the nape of her neck.
One by one, Harry coiled out the spirit of the sacrifices Voldemort had made, and one by one, Harry put them to rest, casting the spells used to protect graveyards and corpses. By the end, Malfoy was breathing hard, but he hadn’t made a sound. “Shh,” Harry told him, needlessly. His concentration was all for the Mark. “You’re doing so well. Only a little more.”
Ron was still on the force, which was one of the main reasons Harry still wanted to come. Molly, Arthur, and Andromeda usually spent the evening with the kids, but Teddy was at a different party, and Harry saw Hermione and Ron so rarely without the children. While Harry loved Hugo and Rose, the conversation with adults was different, and sometimes he still missed the days when it was just the three of them against the world.
Greengrass drew himself up. “You will cease all contact with my daughter. I can see to it you do not graduate Academy.”
He took the dressing-gown with him.  Adult-Draco had given it to him; despite the almost two weeks Harry had spent in Draco’s flat, it was the only thing there that really belong to Harry.
“A façade,” said Sibanyoni, “of quiet mornings. A façade. Of coffee. The walls we build around our inner pain. Around our suffering. Harry Potter has known pain. Harry Potter has known death. Did you share your struggle with death, with pain?”
But Draco’s lip wasn’t curling at Alby, Harry saw after a moment.  Draco was making a face at the slugs on the floor, stepping carefully around them until he was beside Harry.  “Can you un-silence him,” Draco said, more like a demand than a question.
“Nothing.”  Harry felt like he was struggling for air.  “Nothing’s wrong.  Draco.”  Making himself take a breath, he wound the magic tight inside himself, electric wire wrapped over and over again so tightly that the wire cut, and what was beneath could not be seen.  “Draco,” Harry said hoarsely.  “Come sit with me.”
Fudge’s green head shook sadly in its own hearth. “I’m afraid we really can’t set a precedent by passing a failing trainee, just because he is a momentary wizarding media sensation.”
“The headmaster of the school we went to.”  Mechanically, Mister Malfoy took a sip of coffee.  “Hogwarts School for Witchcraft and Wizardry.”
“For what?”  Embarrassed, Harry pushed past him, looking in one of the boxes.  Draco had said they needed a clue.  The box was full of papers in folders, like old files.  Harry moved on to the next one.
“I’m already playing with one, as I have years and years of experience, and you’re what—four years old?  Five?”
Malfoy’s eyes were back on the Dementors, whose black, shadowy heads were turning, almost as one, to the poor body-bound non-mag behind the trunk. They pooled like a swarm around the figure of the man; then one Dementor head leaned in for the Kiss. The view in the IC:WUT/UC was almost desperate as it swung back toward the door and marbles.
Hermione shook her head, her cloud of brown hair falling a little bit into her face. She brushed it back. “Fudge has deep pockets, and deeper influence. I wouldn’t be surprised if he’s the next Minister.”
They were at the desk the quill must have come from now, and Harry wanted to look at it, but he guessed with the woman there, it might look odd for Draco—who wasn’t Harry’s friend—to seem too interested.  The desk was pretty messy, with papers scattered on it, an old coffee cup, three balloons, a bucket labelled ‘kidneys,’ and what looked like a pile of dead moths.  Draco was looking through the papers while the woman stood there looking on.
The flying field at the Academy was state of the art, complete with broom and carpet courses as well as Bludger pitchers and Snitch dispensers. Though the field was meant for trainee practice and the Defensive Riding course, Harry often flew there before teaching. Flying calmed him, clearing his mind so he was ready to face his students. They were not a particularly challenging cohort this year. As Harry had told Kavika, not even Malfoy was a problem, though he had fallen behind the other trainees.
Harry couldn’t really imagine a pair of people who were entirely dedicated to making you happy.  It seemed like more than you would need, only Petunia always seemed to want to make Dudley happy, but he never seemed to be.  “Were you?” Harry asked.  “Happy, I mean.”
“Right,” Harry agreed.  “But they seem to be moulding you into who they want you to be, rather than who you want to be.”
Harry wasn’t sure what he was looking for—maybe cerulean paint.  Maybe cerulean paint disguised to look like indicator solution.  Maybe indicator solution not disguised to look like anything, so Harry could make himself believe that Ron wasn’t in on whatever Savage had been up to—because Ron wasn’t.  He couldn’t be.  Instead, Harry found a pair of diamond earrings.  Two seconds later, Ron found Harry.
A sudden crack filled the big room—like the sound they made whenever they pushed through cold darkness into another place.
“If you’re going to ask about the cream,” Malfoy said, “it’s better to neutralize something like that completely rather than risk it getting spread somewhere else.  It’s all rather complicated for your tiny brain, Potter.  I’ll write up handling instructions for it, so you can take care of this and any other samples you encounter.”
“Well.” Malfoy seemed mollified. “I suppose if Mister Parkinson is involved, one should expect no less.”
“Ah,” Draco said in that quiet way he had.  “You don’t think I did it because I wanted you to fuck me.”
For a moment, Harry felt himself be still, hands and heart and breath. He’d been so distracted by the slurs and harassment at the Academy—
“Granger,” Mister Malfoy said.  His voice was low just like it had been earlier, but also nothing like it.  Then it had been warm.  Now it was arctic.
“I think maybe I should read this letter,” Harry said, watching as Malfoy moved along the bench to poke at a bag of powder.
“You’ve missed the plot, Bernard,” Greengrass said, bored. “Everything with these radical anti-Statute one-Worlders is about Reveal. Beans on toast is about Reveal. They want to suggest that anyone who abides by any perfectly reasonable wizarding traditions—such as, oh,
Self-sufficient meant you could do everything for yourself.  Harry had always thought being self-sufficient sounded great, but Draco hexing Dudley sounded pretty great as well, and Harry couldn’t tell which he preferred.  Maybe it was best to be self-sufficient and also have a protector like Draco, who would help if you needed it.  Harry looked up at Draco again, the gold light playing on his face.  Harry wanted to sit closer to him, but he was already as close as possible.  If he leaned some, though, more of Harry could be touching him.  Thinking Draco might not notice, Harry tried it.
“Oh,” Harry said again.  Thinking that sounded sort of sad, he played another card.  Maybe if Draco won the game, he would be happier.  Or at least less distracted.
Harry waited for Draco to suggest something for Harry to do, like chop ingredients or stir a pot, but Draco didn’t say anything.  In fact, he seemed to sort of forget that Harry was there, becoming completely absorbed in writing.  That was okay.  Usually Draco paid attention to him, but Harry had noticed that sometimes Draco got really distracted, especially by potions.
Draco was casting the spell again, while he fucked; Harry  twisted to look over his shoulder, the green dildo coming with him. Draco was still fucking him, but he had reached around Harry’s hip to point his wand at Harry’s cock.
them? Potter, there’s not some secret cabal, covertly cheering me on, installing people like me in the Ministry. I’m here to
“You had to figure out which part of the sigil had the force of feeling and use the opposite feeling to remove that part. Remove the blood with its sticking charm; then you can remove the mud, no problem. How did you know there was blood in the mud?”
“Ah,” said Andromeda, sounding so much like adult-Draco in that moment that Harry shook his head.  “How was young Draco, then?”
Swallowing a sigh, Harry turned away, leaving Malfoy to his reading, his tree, his scent of cinnamon. Malfoy didn’t deserve Harry’s forgiveness, but everyone deserved to be quiet and contemplative for the space of an hour. Everyone deserved some peace, even if not everyone got to have it.
“No, Harry.”  Without his glasses, Harry could only see a whitish blob as Draco’s face, lit by the moonlight streaming through the window by the bunk beds.  “They were different.  I put the old ones in the wash.”
Now Draco was talking about it, and Harry wondered whether having lost the war, lost his parents, and lost everything else, Draco felt he was finally allowed to be himself.  More had to be repressed in Draco than simply liking blokes, and Harry felt like maybe this had been the key all along; all of this had had to happen for Draco to finally grow up to be the person Harry had grown to love.  Holding onto Draco tighter, Harry touched Draco’s hair, those short hairs in back, and willed for him to be okay.
“She likes you,” Draco said softly, and Harry’s chest went tight.  Pointing his wand about the room, Draco extinguished the candles one by one.  At last the room was lit only by the fire in front of them and the soft glow of the Patronus, and then Draco pointed his wand at the ceiling.  “
“Secondly.”  Draco’s eyes darted down to Harry’s hand, and then he snatched it up, as though Harry would take his hand away.  “Secondly,” Draco repeated, “I’ve never told you this, but I’ve always admired how honest you are.  There were times when—I always wished I could be as honest.”  He squeezed Harry’s hand, hard, Draco’s thumb pressing into the scar.  “Thirdly,” Draco went on.
“But it’s not the land’s fault,” Draco added, more lightly.  “It used to be a beautiful place—the most beautiful place in the whole world.  I think—I think the land would like to know that there are boys on it, flying and playing Quidditch and having a good time.  That—that used to happen a lot, here.”
“Unduly influence trainees to become people who can help integrate magical people into the larger world, and educate non-magical people about the civilization about to join them?” Spragg asked. “That kind of influence?”
Concentration broken, Harry snapped back into the orchard, where the crowd had separated him from Nyala. Weaving amidst the crowd, Harry made his way back to her side as non-magicals shouted questions.
Harry thought he should recognize her, but the only thing he was sure of was that she had no connection to Parkinson.  Parkinson’s father had gone to Azkaban; Harry had no idea what had happened to her or her mother or sisters.
Malfoy wasn’t trying to, but this reminder of Harry’s role and position made Harry confused about whether he should demand to remove the mark from Malfoy there and then. Would he demand it of another student? Or was it because he felt this way?
me, just because I—all because of me.  You—it sounds like I dragged you off to wherever we got to anyway, when the potion fell on me, so you shouldn’t have to.  That’s all.”
Draco looked at him quickly, then back at the scar. “He didn’t hurt you enough? He had to go and do this as well?”
“Pity . . .” Harry shook his head. “I don’t care if he changed; he tortured us, in school. I mean—what did Hermione say—he was part of a racist murder death cult. His parents were as well, and what did they get? Rich. And after the war, they got richer still, and they never—they were always—they got to be a family. They live on an estate, for chrissake.”
He was forgetting the kiss, Narcissa’s death, Cecil Vance; he forgot Wood-Eye Lye and Savage and Aurors, the academy, uni, Hogwarts, Hermione, Ron.  Then Harry forgot Malfoy, and he was a boy in too-big clothes holding a stick.
Draco looked down at him, a strange look in his eyes that Harry couldn’t interpret.  When he spoke, his tone was light, but his hand squeezed Harry’s tightly.  “All right, Harry.  I promise.”
, Harry wanted to say, because he had always wanted that. It had nearly killed him several times, and Kavika had been the one to help him see that he didn’t need to die to save the world. Not again, anyway. She’d helped him to understand that his own happiness was important. The problem was, sometimes when he thought of happiness, now, he thought of Draco Malfoy, and yet thinking of him made him remember all the misery of those early years, everything that had been wrong with that world, what was still wrong today.
Draco played another card, then another.  “You were there as well, apparently.  So you see, Harry.  He wasn’t alone in the end.  Snap!”  The cards exploded, and Draco swept them up into his pile.  “I think that’s probably the way he would have looked at it, anyway,” Draco said as he shuffled.  “He always did have an odd way of seeing things.”
me.  Except when I was a baby.  I mean, that would be weird.  But we used to—well, never bother.  I’ve got my hair cut, and Malkin’s going to be making me a whole new wardrobe as well as my school robes—you know Malkin, of course?”
Harry looked down at him, and he loved this too. He didn’t know why. Something about seeing Draco this mortified made him feel like he was falling in love all over again. “I think I’ve made it clear how much I like holding your dick,” Harry said finally.
“No, I get that.” Harry’s hand moved over his fist. “I just meant—I don’t know why I can’t . . . meet someone and feel that thing you’re meant to feel.”
“No—” Harry began, but when he turned back to look, someone had moved, revealing the person Rune was talking to.
“Oh, who?” Harry said, pretending he didn’t know. Ron got this bit of a dopey smile a lot of the time when Hermione was doing something he thought impressive—leading a committee hearing. Proposing legislation. Washing Hugo’s face. Eating beans on toast.
Malfoy stared back. Dusk was falling on the weedy garden, and his eyes were luminous in the fading light. “You mean because you encouraged me to turn my memory in to the Ministry.”
On the IC:WUT/UC, a blue marble lay in the green carpet. Malfoy had dropped one by the empty chair, then he moved to sit beside Rodolphus. There, he dropped a purple marble, a little behind the chair so as not to be seen by those sitting beside him. Only the green marble was left, which Malfoy had likely saved because it would be harder to see on the green carpet. Good thinking.
“You didn’t even want to come here in the first place,” Harry said, exasperated now as well as worried.
“What are you doing?” Draco was standing directly in front of him, hands on his hips as he looked down at Harry on the sofa.  “Why are you looking at that?  Why aren’t you paying attention to me?”
Draco’s face changed colour in big blotches.  “I’m going in there,” he blurted, darting into Weasley’s Wizard Wheezes.
Apparently, Malfoy was going to have to do something to the potion in order to identify the ‘key ingredient,’ which Harry supposed wasn’t that odd if the very make-up of the potion was meant to disguise its contents.  Hermione had said fully distilling the potion would take a long time, but Malfoy probably wouldn’t be slamming things about like this if it was a week-long project.  Harry decided to help.
Harry’s fist moved up and down Draco’s shaft. He wanted to kiss Draco while doing it, feel that warm soft reassurance of Draco’s lips, his clever tongue, but when Harry leaned down Draco’s mouth was already open, connecting with Harry’s inside a little moan. Harry swirled his thumb around the tip of Draco’s cock to spread the wetness around, and Draco moaned again, arching, his tongue swiping between Harry’s lips to lick Harry’s tongue and then slipping back out again, so that Harry was swallowing Draco’s little cry.
“But you shouldn’t.”  Harry meant to say it passionately, because he cared about Draco having to close his shop, but it just sounded aggressive.  He poked the remaining bacon on his plate with his fork.  “You shouldn’t have to close it or spend all night working on potions or—or
“I’m almost finished,” Harry said, guiding the skin smoother, and smoother, and smoother. Malfoy’s skin was almost surprising, here—a softer, more vulnerable white on the underside than on the tops of his arms. Though Malfoy was still lean, now that Harry had been looking at the forearm a while, the muscle seemed almost thick—long and ropy, corded over with veins. The powder-white skin looked deceptively soft over that lean strength. Maybe this was the kind of thing that Fleur thought was well-made.
Harry felt the brush of fabric and realized through his haze of lust that Draco still hadn’t taken off his clothes, only just opened his trousers, and for some reason the thought made Harry wild. He wanted to see himself: the red, aching arse, the thick, achingly erect prick, the naked, kneeling man, with the pale, slender and aristocratic figure of Draco in his posh clothes, absolutely destroying Harry’s arse with his pink cock.
Books were spread out everywhere.  Harry could see some of the ones that had been burned, laid out carefully, as though for a project.  “I never saw you when we were nineteen,” Harry said.  “Or when we were twenty.”
“You are different than you were, Harry.” Yin’s voice was soft. “I’m different than I used to be. We can grow and change, and still remember the hurts we have felt.”
“You don’t have to forgive Draco Malfoy,” Kavika said again, spelling coffee into her own cup, then returning to her seat facing his. “You only have to deal with him. If I had had my way,” she added, taking a sip, “you wouldn’t have to do that either.”
“But it’s not,” Harry said. “I mean, it is, but it’s never—he never even looks at me, when he does it. Not anymore. I mean, he used to, but now it’s just . . . it’s just like he wants things to be a certain way for me, and I thought it was okay, but it’s not.”
“Naturally. As Damien explained, we’ve learned to control them. Now,” Rodolphus went on, twisting one of the sconces on the wall. “Behind this wall, is a Muggle.”
He certainly hadn’t ever thought before about kissing another trainee until every injury was forgotten. He hadn’t thought before about cornering them and getting them alone and touching them everywhere just to make sure they were okay, and Harry had to stop this train of thought before it became even more inappropriate. He coughed. “Good presentation,” was all he said.
“Don’t cry,” Draco murmured, drawing him in again.  “Hasn’t there been enough crying?  I thought there was going to be snogging.  I feel that you deserve snogging, Harry, after all that you’ve done.”
Kavika went on. “They deliberate,” she said. “Perhaps they will take their time. Perhaps a week, perhaps longer. Say a fortnight. After that time, you get a Floo. They’ve agreed to grant your request. Draco Malfoy is removed. The next day you go to class. Draco isn’t there. How do you feel?”
“Right, because so many other Death Eaters are clamouring to join the force,” Malfoy said. “It’s against everything they ever stood for.”
“Mm,” Harry said, voice muffled by cock. “Mm-hm.” He needed it so bad that he finally released the cock in his mouth. “Please. Please, I need . . .” He arched his back, fucking back onto a cock that sadly, wasn’t there.
Malfoy’s eyes darted to Harry’s throat again. His own throat bobbed, but then he looked about. “The pub. The street. That tree.”
“Whoa,” Harry said, putting his hand on the table.  “You’ll make the whole table fly up with that one,” he said, even though he could already see the spell wasn’t going to work.
Somehow it was even worse than Harry had remembered, the sound that Draco made when it happened.  Harry had remembered screaming, but that had been Moaning Myrtle.  Draco just made a low soft gasp, and Harry had also forgot the way the blood had spattered.  It sprayed out into Harry’s face, his hand, his chest, soaking both of them, and Draco’s hand yanked out of Harry’s, scrambling across Draco’s chest.
dark magic on your grounds. The truth of it is, someone trapped someone else named Timothy in a tree on this property a millennia ago, and it’s only just now—after generations and generations and generations of Aurors, who are
“Oh, the Ludville case,” Ron said.  “Don’t worry about that.  Mysteries has it under control.  I’m sure it will all get cleared up in the end.”
“No,” Harry said, then thought about it. “Maybe. I know that’s what would make Teddy back off, and I could . . . I could tell Malfoy didn’t want to make things worse for me. Malfoy—I can read him. I’ve always been able to. I’ve always known—” Cutting himself off, Harry pulled his hands apart, placing them on the arms of the chair. “That sounds intimate,” he said. “It’s not. Malfoy is an open book. He’s always been.”
Over twenty years ago, Harry had saved Malfoy from the Fiendfyre just like this, and they were different now. They had grown. The past would always haunt them, but it didn’t own Harry now, not the way it once had. Despite everything that had changed—the whole wizarding world crashing down around them—Harry thought Malfoy had changed even more than all the rest of it, and that, more than anything, made Harry feel that he himself could be different. He himself could grow up. He could move on.
“Tell me if you don’t like it, Harry,” Draco whispered, still without touching him, forcing Harry’s insides to perform for him. “Just say the word.”
The potion had fallen on Harry; he was the one who was the wrong age.  And old-him was meant to be the policeman, only he obviously hadn’t caught the bad guy.  And old-him had furthermore dragged Draco along to that warehouse.  Draco probably hadn’t even wanted to be there in the first place, seeing as how they weren’t friends.
“I was just getting—ingredients for my potions!”  Alby looked excited about this explanation.  “For my little shop!  How do you think I get ingredients for my little shop?  They’re in that warehouse!”
“Well.” Teddy’s voice was thoughtful. “I think I’d prefer ice cream that tastes like live cat over ice cream that tastes like dead cat.”
“I wouldn’t mind,” Draco began, then swallowed.  “I mean.  It’s terribly dodgy, isn’t it, the Leaky?  They let Muggles in.  But I saw someone eating fish and chips there, through a window, once, and it seemed very—well, I suppose I could . . . I could stomach it.  If forced.”
“That’s what it’s really all about, isn’t it,” Draco went on, driven by some invisible force.  His words came as though he’d been pushed down a rapid on a river and couldn’t stop, spilling from him in a tirade.  “You want to fuck her.  You want to make babies with her.  You want to marry her and do everything you’re supposed to do, except guess what,
Draco had said, and he’d sounded angry about it.  He’d sounded really angry about it, but not at Harry, and something about that felt almost nice.  Even though Draco really wished Harry was thirty-one, it still felt nice.  Budging closer to Draco on the couch, Harry pretended to look at the book Draco had brought, thinking that perhaps Draco would put his arm around him again.  “What’s that?” Harry said.
“What?” Harry began, but even as he was saying it the houses began to shift, another house bulging in between two in the middle, like a bubble forming in mud.  Then the house finally snapped into place, straightening out and standing to attention just as though it had been there all along.  “Whoa,” Harry breathed.
Thank you to icmezzo and seraphcelene. Thank you to siemejay, who read this over, encouraged me, and made it far better than it was the first time. You are the best!
“Don’t be a git,” Draco said, yanking on his hair. “What am I talking about? You were born a git.” Then Draco sat up—fuck, his abdominal muscles—then hauled Harry up, pushing him down, twisting until Draco was on top and Harry was under him.
“I can assure you,” said Alby, smugness turning to alarm, “I don’t know anything about criminal activities.  I am merely his employer!”
“You know how to use a Floo,” Harry said, taking off into the air, sailing over the heads of the reporters through the Pallas Arch to the safety of the Academy grounds. Behind him, the reporters who had turned to watch him go joined their colleagues, who were all talking to Malfoy now, and Malfoy seemed to be loving the attention.
Kavika’s face softened, then, as though she had not expected this, her expression turning rueful. “Of course,” she had said, quietly. “I meant, are you their guardian?”
Malfoy rambled on for a while. Harry should have been listening, but he couldn’t, because Malfoy looked so, so good, his lashes long, his thin lips making lovely shapes, his eyes bright.
“You may have to live with your mistakes,” Harry told him. “You may have to live with scars. But you shouldn’t have to live with Voldemort’s enslavement on your skin, not if you don’t have to.”
At its base, on the bench, sat Draco Malfoy, leaning against the trunk, a book in his lap, dull blond hair bent to peer at the pages as though he belonged there, under Harry’s tree. In fact, Malfoy looked almost peaceful there, like some kind of pastoral ideal of a student, reading on the green, the arched cloisters rising behind him. He looked like he belonged, and Harry felt resentment rise hard and strong in his chest, a clawing anger.
Putting his head back on his pillow, Harry closed his eyes.  The pyjamas Draco had transfigured for Harry were much nicer, different than the white and blue striped ones he’d had before.  These were green and silver, and felt a little slippery, like silk.  They were the most comfortable things Harry had ever worn.  “Draco,” Harry said, putting his head over the side again.
milk and sugar,” Mister Malfoy said, pointing through the door again.  “Did you want to contact your cousin?” he asked.
The faint smile came back.  “Yes.  You used to fly all the time for a sport we played in school.  It’s called Quidditch.  Even when you were very young you were quite good.  The best in our year, by far.”
Harry thought it was a rather neat way for Draco to get out of the question he’d been asked, but Harry was distracted by the prospect of feeding the owl.  Owls ate rodents, Harry had learned in school.  “Do you mean the mouse ears?”
“Besides,” Draco said.  “They’ve got to do well, haven’t they?  Us pure-bloods have to stick together, or mongrels will take over the earth.”
“And what about all your toys?” Mister Malfoy asked, his voice amused as well.  “Would they fit in there?”
“You’re right on that.”  Harry looked around at Draco’s sitting room.  The poor floral-print chair was sagging in the middle, over-stretched from too many enlargement spells, the little table beside it.  Not wanting to ruin the chair completely, Harry cast a Summoning spell for a sofa to come over from Grimmauld Place to use instead.  “Let’s have somewhere to sit, shall we?”
“Thank you,” Malfoy told the waiter. The bubble closed, and Malfoy turned back to the table at large. “Have we no hope for Proudfoot, then?”
“What else did your parents do?  Did they teach you magic?  Did you play Exploding Snap with them?  Did you . . .” Harry tried to think of other things that wizards did.  “Duel?”
“There’s a potion called Polyjuice,” Draco said.  “It allows you to temporarily change form to look like someone else.  All I need is some part of your body from you at the correct age.”
“It’s a spell book,” Draco said, as though Harry couldn’t read, when the problem was that he was bored by it.  “I thought you could learn some more magic while I work on the potion.”  He held out Harry’s wand.
says.’ Does all blood do that for you? Or just pure blood? Or is it bigot blood? Have you tried it with mine?”
“Maybe we shouldn’t produce too much excitement,” said Teddy. “There’s going to be a lot of it going around.”
Harry swallowed, putting the square of parchment into his pocket so he would remember to think about it later. “Thanks for your help,” he said, “with Nyala. She was all right?”
“We did fight the good fight!” Savage thundered, and Harry saw her anyway: Professor Burbage, suspended over the table. Harry closed his eyes.
“Harry.”  There was a pause, and Harry realized he’d closed his eyes again.  “You know lying is bad, don’t you?”
“Stupefy,” Malfoy added. The witch’s wand floated into Harry’s hand as the witch fell over. “Where is Teddy?” Malfoy demanded.
Malfoy’s eyes finally met his then, wide with surprise. “Oh,” he whispered, then began to tremble. “I’m—oh, Potter. I . . .”
“He’s a blood supremacist,” Harry said simply. “He won’t tell you he is, but that’s because he lies. He lies about everything. He lied to my face about why one of my trainees wasn’t advancing to Level Two last year, and he knows he can get away with it.”
Ron was right—not about always thinking Malfoy was plotting something, but about Harry’s intuition. It had always been right about Malfoy—or, well. It had been right most of the time. Harry bit his lip. “I don’t know.”
Harry looked around, noting the bright patches of colour that dotted the countryside.  It all looked so fresh and innocent, just like a painting.  Paintings didn’t have insects either.
It reminded him of the way Malfoy had always been sweeping or scrubbing or stocking shelves when Harry had first seen him again at Slug and Jiggers—when Malfoy had looked just like a skeleton, and Alby was always saying awful things to him.  It reminded Harry of dark spaces and spiders and an ache in his stomach that wouldn’t go away.  Harry didn’t like to think of it.
“Oh . . .” Timothy’s voice was equally soft. He turned back, looking first at Malfoy, then Harry. Then he looked up. “Will I see my . . . mother . . . ”
“I know.”  Draco started petting his hand, just like Hermione had done.  “I know that now, but—I didn’t then.  I was—I was—it hurt so
“All right.”  Harry began to gather the supplies he’d brought back into the bowl.  “I’m going to change my clothes.  I don’t think we should change yours, since that will require moving you, but I’ll bring you a clean towel.  And you need to drink something.”
For once, Malfoy wasn’t stirring a tincture or measuring powder out into spoons.  Instead, he was sat in the floral-print chair, which had been drawn up near the hearth.  Books rested around him, scrolls spread out in all directions.  Harry could tell Malfoy was working—he had a quill in hand even with a book in his lap, and notes were scribbled on a parchment beside his elbow in fresh-looking ink.  That Malfoy was apparently a swot wasn’t what gave Harry pause.
It felt so warm and good that Harry wanted to get even closer, which was stupid.  It was so stupid, because Petunia was always cuddling Dudley, but that was because Dudley was a big baby.  Harry didn’t want to be a baby, so he stayed where he was.
Malfoy looked him up and down.  “Well?  What’s happened?  Why am I in these clothes?  You’re an Auror, aren’t you?”
“Let me tell you what I’d expect.”  Andromeda had eyes that always made him feel like she was looking at a part of him that he didn’t know he had.  “I didn’t get to meet my nephew until after she was sentenced, but I knew Cissy.”  Harry realized she meant Narcissa.  “She was the quiet one.  Even when Bella and I were screaming at each other, Cissy was placid and lovely and polite.  She did everything Mum and Dad ever told her to, except for when she married Lou.  Every emotion she ever had she wound inside herself so tight she never looked like anything except the prettiest little picture you ever saw.”
“It’s disturbing how many kids have bought into it,” said Penelope. “I understand Granger’s case about going slow and getting a plan in place before we do the Reveal, but I’m beginning to think whoever’s destroying the secrecy wards has got the right idea. Just theoretically, of course. Why not just rip the wards off? Like a bandage. At least then Concealers don’t get their way.”
” Parkinson sneered. “You know that Potter and Shackleshit and all his little Revealer friends are trying to suggest there’s blood supremacy in the Ministry, when we all
“Oh, I’m good, thanks.” Malfoy always had this light, quick tone that made him sound as though he thought everything was a great big joke.
They’d done a bit of shopping in Diagon Alley, Draco looking like Gilderoy Lockhart and Harry looking again like Draco, just because he could.  Draco had eased up some, only saying 'Why are you like this' three or four more times, and only saying 'Go to hell' once.  He’d dragged his feet a lot though and looked like he wished he had a pillow to throw over his face.  Harry felt like he should have known that thirteen-year-old Draco was a drama queen, but somehow, he’d missed it.  Harry didn’t suppose anybody else would go to the trouble of dressing up as a Dementor just to scare someone they liked to torment.
Draco made a horrible noise, sort of like a sob, but without tears.  “H-hold me,” he said.  “Hold me until I—until I forget her.”
“The Statute of Secrecy was built on this hidden world, this dark world, as much as it was built on any premise of protecting ourselves, or protecting non-magicals. Our schools, our institutions, are built on a foundation of hatred, distrust, on Killing Curses and Obliviates meant to drive us further and further apart, until we no longer recognize each other as brethren and only see our enemies.
The biggest issue, claimed the non-magical members of Teddy’s Order of the Phoenix, was going to be crowd control.
Harry opened his mouth to say, but of course, that was what he had just told Yin. It was true, he realized. About the sleep remedies. Harry trusted him.
many cushions, and finding that his hand sought his other hand to find the scar. “It’s not. I have to work on—what you said. Being honest about my feelings.”
Doctor Grace Yin was his fifth therapist after Kavika, and after having zero therapy for most of the past year, he was rather desperate to make this work. “Come in,” said Doctor Yin, opening the door wider. “Don’t mind the mess,” they added, already turning their back to him to head down the corridor. “We’re just getting settled in.”
Draco was spread out every which way on the bed at angles that couldn’t possibly be comfortable.  His hair was spread out too, his pyjama shirt riding up on his narrow waist.
“Right,” Draco said, sounding confused, “but I’ve got three over there.  And six there.”  He pointed to the piles near the floral chair.
For some reason, Harry kept thinking about Malfoy at the holiday party, impeccably dressed in dove grey and a deep green, the way he had looked after Gardenia Greengrass had announced his betrothal. Malfoy had become so pale, strained about the mouth. The man was too bony. Last summer, when he had been telling Harry he would love him forever, Malfoy had had colour in his cheeks. He had looked vital, alive.
Harry suddenly became aware of his hands. He wanted to fidget but resisted; Teddy knowing about the way that Malfoy felt shouldn’t be embarrassing.
, Harry wanted to tell him, but Malfoy was already grabbing his robe, rushing for his satchel, and it was a lie. Malfoy must have known that Harry thought Malfoy’s sultry teasing was a joke; he must have counted on Harry not to take it seriously. And of course, Malfoy hadn’t been able to cast a Patronus before now.
Ron was currently dancing with his wife, and the entire wizarding world knew he was infatuated with her. “You can try,” Harry said drily.
When the Polyjuice potion had hit his system, Harry’s skin had stretched out, growing in all directions to accommodate longer limbs, a bigger torso, a large head.  Harry felt a little like that now, only it was only happening inside his mind—that stretching out feeling, as though his mind was separating from his body and the chair and Andromeda, sitting there with her tea.  “What’s a Death Eater?” was all he asked.
Malfoy’s sleeve was still undone, but instead of a spell to fold it up, he proceeded to do it manually. Great. Didn’t he remember the folding spell? Watching Malfoy do that, revealing his nakedly muscled forearm piece by piece in silence, felt like porn.
“Sorry!” Doctor Yin yelled, and the grinding stopped. Picking up the pitcher, they poured the grey-looking smoothie into a jar, then came back to their seat. “You have an orientation, right? Is it weird to meet the new trainees?”
Harry was alone in Grimmauld Place when Heloise came.  Harry used to take work home with him just because there was nothing else to do if he was stuck by himself besides eat and listen to the wireless.  Sometimes he’d go out flying.  Sometimes he’d visit Dumbledore’s grave.  That was about the extent of his evening activities if he wasn’t with friends.
Then Harry was coming—all over Draco’s face, but then Draco was catching Harry’s cock in his mouth and Harry was coming on Draco’s tongue, and then Draco was holding him down and opening his throat once more so that the final, dry humps were into Draco’s neck, feeding it directly to him.
At last, Malfoy’s head swung toward him, his gaze intense and unblinking, just as it always was. “Come on, then,” Malfoy said, his voice unexpectedly soft. “Let’s have it.”
“What?” Harry looked up quickly. “No. He made it better. I mean—sometimes. He didn’t always, though. Do anything. He just—I don’t know. He brings me coffee.”
“Draco Malfoy is a former Death Eater!” Alby said loudly, coming out from behind Malfoy.  “How dare you defend him against—”
At last, Harry pulled away. “What were you thinking?” he asked, before realizing Malfoy had said the exact same thing.
“It’s fucked up.” Harry put his hands in his hair. He wanted to yank it all out. “I know it’s fucked up.”
Good riddance, Harry thought, and yet he was plagued by the knowledge that Malfoy had diverted attention not just because he wanted it. Malfoy had emerged from the Pallas Arch, which meant he had already been through it that morning; he would have seen the reporters. That meant he had gone inside and come back out again with his broom just to give it to Harry, just to give the reporters someone else to bother.
I just want to thank everyone who has been so kind about the long delay in updates, particularly buildyourwalls.
Malfoy was standing so close, and tears were running down his face, arms wrapped tight about himself.  Harry tried not to even breathe, lest his breath get on Malfoy, and then Malfoy would remember that Harry’s way of saying 'sorry your mum died' had been to bring him a job to do.
“But.”  Draco bit his lip, and Harry could tell that he was conflicted.  Harry remembered being angry at his older self for not being better friends with Draco.  This Draco was worried about the opposite.
“Fuck,” Harry muttered, making himself go back to Draco’s buttons. He had to get his shirt open. He had to see him, because Draco was so beautiful and Harry wanted to touch him; he wanted to touch him all over.
Opening the ledger the older Draco had left on the lab bench, Harry checked to make sure all the instructions were there.  The first page had a list of ingredients in Draco’s meticulous hand, the second a description of the potion he had made for the cure, the third an explanation of how the cure would work, the fourth a summary of how he’d traded their ages, using a potion he’d developed called Age Exchange.  Harry skimmed the second and third pages, making sure he understood the instructions and could do what Draco was saying.
Harry thought he’d probably been kissed before.  His parents must have done it.  Bringing his hand up, he touched the scar.  It didn’t feel any different.  The kiss hadn’t felt good or special or anything like that, mostly just confusing, but Draco had kissed him.  Draco had wanted to kiss him—because he liked him, the way Aunt Petunia was always kissing Dudley.  Because she liked him.
“I only read books to people who are my friends.”  For a while, Draco watched the fire, the dancing flames making odd shadows on the floor.  “How did Vince die?”
“Harry.”  Mister Malfoy hesitated again, and Harry tried to figure out what he had done wrong this time.  Whatever it was, Mister Malfoy seemed to forget about it, because he leaned in toward the fire to cast a spell on it that made some of the orange flames blue, and when he spoke to Harry his voice was much lighter.  “You needn’t call me sir,” he said.
“Yeah,” Harry said. “I’m going to kill her.” But he didn’t see her anywhere, and Malfoy had pulled back from Teddy, his hand still at the back of Teddy’s neck, a tender look on his face.
“Get on the bed,” Draco said, pulling Harry away from the wall, turning him around. He gave Harry a push on his chest.
“So all that about—about wanting to stop Death Eaters, and hatred, and violence—here you have a chance to do
“I needed to figure out the final ingredient,” said Draco.  “I needed to track down Vance to do it.  It was dangerous to—”
look past the war. I look straight past it into the thousands of Galleons you’re pouring to the Council and Wizengamot and Diagon Association to sabotage the Deal, and why? Because there’s no profit in Reveal, and that’s all you care about. It’s all you’ve ever cared about.”
Harry flicked his wand again, an invisible collar slowly drawing Alby up on his toes, rising and tightening around his neck.  “Who else?”
Malfoy’s eyes heated up. He licked his lips. “Maybe you could do it with your shirt off. What?” he added, when Harry laughed at him. “It would inspire many people, I’m certain.”
Harry lay there for a moment a little bit stunned, because people didn’t do that to him—drag him around and climb on top of him. He was the Chosen One; his magic was powerful. He was over six feet tall and his shoulders had got broad; they couldn’t. But Draco was lithe and wiry and strong and here he was manhandling Harry, climbing on top of him and having his way with him, and Harry couldn’t remember the last time he wanted to be fucked this badly. Maybe he never had.
“Just freshening spells.”  Draco took Harry’s glasses, focusing on folding them and putting them aside as he said.  “My mum used to do it for me.  As you can imagine, she had to do them—rather frequently.”
“You can’t kick me out,” Malfoy said, his voice still quick. “I was admitted. My application was approved.”
“But Father’s right; don’t you see?  I’m not ever going to love a girl the way that Dad loves Mum.  I know I never will.”
“No.”  Pressing his lips together, Draco shook his head, backing up until he was bumping into the wall of books.  Heloise gave a concerned little hoot.  “I
“The only one I needed studying for was yours,” Malfoy said, not looking up from his diagrams. “Look how well that turned out.”
Savage went pale.  “I shouldn’t be surprised,” she’d said, after a moment.  “Should have known all Vance’s sticking-to-protocol bullshit was just to cover something up.”
Draco took a deep gasping breath. Then another one. On the third one, he finally let go, letting Harry’s hand squeeze his cock instead.
Finding a small, hidden space in a cabinet between two potion bottles, Harry set up a Seeing-eye Ball, which would allow him to see anything going in the lab remotely.  Next, he used the sickle in his pocket to make a Portkey linked to the location, knowing he would have to come back.
Harry shook his head. “Malfoy was a child. I should have known he could change. I should have known. Maybe we could even get along. Maybe we could be best friends. I shouldn’t—”
For some reason, Harry’s mouth went dry, and he wanted Malfoy. He wanted Malfoy like he had rarely wanted anything, like he wanted Ron and Hermione when he  was alone and needed someone he could trust, like he had wanted Ginny physically. The two desires married together felt so intense that Harry felt consumed by it, flames licking up his throat, burning his tongue; he couldn’t speak.
“I’m sorry, Harry.”  Draco’s voice sounded strained, but Harry couldn’t see his face.  He was staring down at the papers, not looking at him.  “You did.”
Draco pushed Harry’s shirt farther up, revealing his chest. Sucking in a breath, Draco just looked at it for a moment—Harry’s lightly muscled chest, the dusting of black hair. “What’s this, then?” Draco asked, his finger gently tracing the scar from the locket.
“Then can you tell me about your mum and dad?” Harry asked, budging closer on the sofa.  Usually if he did that, Draco would put his arm around him, so it didn’t get squashed, but Draco didn’t do it this time.
Harry snatched his hand away, jerking back from the table.  His chair knocked back, clattering onto the floor.  The sudden sound made him start and look down.  “Sorry,” he said, not sure how the chair had got that way.
Harry licked the come off of him, but he couldn’t find much of it—Draco had done it everywhere; it could be on the walls, the ceiling, with the way Draco had shot off, and Draco kept carding his hands through Harry’s hair saying, “Harry. Harry.” At last Draco tugged and Harry went, Draco manhandling him again, arranging him into a position—Harry on his side, Draco behind him curled against him, Draco’s leg over both of Harry’s, tugging them against Draco’s other leg possessively, Draco’s arm over Harry’s waist, hand on Harry’s chest. No one had ever spooned Harry like this before; he was fairly large. He’d always done it the other way; it had just seemed natural.
“Do you want that, Harry? Do you want a nice, thick prick to suck on, fill that greedy mouth?” When Harry moaned again, Draco thrust particularly hard. “Use your words, darling.”
He cut himself off when Harry came toward him, and the problem was that in all of Harry’s fantasies, Malfoy was the one beating
“Right. Just to be clear, I don’t actually want to discover the dark secrets of how He Who Must Not Be—You Know—stayed alive. It was probably something sick and twisted, knowing him. It’s for my final exam.”
“I wanted it to be black and white,” Teddy went on. “Find some Death Eaters. Stop them from hurting people.”
“Oh,” Malfoy said, glancing down at the bottle as if he’d forgot it was in his hand.  He set it down on the lab bench.  “I’ll probably cast a containment field and look at it in a bubble.”
“Let me ask you again,” Mister Malfoy said in that low, gentle voice.  “Has anyone ever hurt you when something—odd happened around you?  Something that might have been you doing magic accidentally?”
Magic roiled inside of Harry, and this was why he didn’t like to feel anything.  Sadness always felt like rage, something difficult to control; tears pricked behind his eyes at the same time as his fingertips crackled over his heart.
let people climb it, and if it hadn’t let Malfoy—well, Malfoy had failed enough as it was. He deserved to win, and Harry ignored the way he was once again reminded of Malfoy besting him in the sparring match, and how hot it made him.
Sighing, Harry grabbed Draco’s arm as it flung out from the bed.  “Like this.”  With one hand, Harry loosened Draco’s tense fingers on the wand.  With his other, Harry helped Draco make the snatching gesture for Accio.  “
“I’m preparing my curses,” Harry said, opening the satchel to grab one of the parchments.  A biro floated over to him, and Harry grabbed it.  “Okay, I’m ready for the number.”
“Harry.  I’d—” Draco cut himself off, then swallowed.  After a long moment, he turned back to the fire.  “I’d hex your cousin if you needed me to—but I doubt you’d need it.  You’re pretty self-sufficient.”
“I’ll go as slow as you want me to,” Harry said, keeping his voice slow just for good measure. Then he put his lips by Draco’s ear. “But if you want to come fast that just means I’ll get to make you come more. Over and over.”
“It’s still my office, Malfoy,” Harry said, finally beginning to be impatient. “Tell me what you want, or—”
Sighing, Harry got up to get more Firewhiskey, then poured them each another shot.  “Probably,” he said, putting the cap on the bottle, “if Robards doesn’t get in my way.”
Malfoy had never skipped a single class, and Harry thought Malfoy might get his wish of falling under suspicion after all.
I also can't express the amount of time, patience, and enthusiasm siemejay has given this story, from cheerleading to editing to honest opinions to thoughtful, in-depth comments to compassionate understanding and sympathy. I am overwhelmed by the debt of gratitude that I am so glad to owe you.
He couldn’t do something to help, though, because he was stuck in this house.  It wasn’t even in London.  Draco had said they were in Dorset, last night when they were lying on the bunk beds.  Draco had also told him he should get some sleep, but Harry had kept having questions, and Draco had answered all of them.  Or most of them, except now Harry didn’t even know if Draco had told him the truth.  And Harry had no idea where Draco had gone.
“And, if you would care to look at the record, provided by Lee Jordan of RevealRadio, you would know that Draco Malfoy executed a
Malfoy shrugged. “Mother wants me to complete my education, but personally, I don’t see it as that important these days. I mean, think about it. . . . When the Dark Lord takes over, is he going to care how many O.W.L.s or N.E.W.T.s anyone’s got? Of course he isn’t. . . . It’s going to be all about the kind of service he received, the level of devotion he was shown.”
Because all of the Aurors were occupied preparing for a Reveal that might not occur, graduation was a small affair without alumni. Of the Board of Regents, only Bernard Bickford stayed for the entire ceremony, mainly to loudly lament the absence of the Timothy Tree and the rushed nature of the proceedings, which he found did not suit the majesty and tradition of the Academy.
“It can be a veil,” Teddy was saying in his flat, toneless voice, putting the tulle on his head. “It can be shade. It can be a shroud.”
Tonight saw a similar crowd: Penelope, Gareth, Savage, Penelope’s husband, Savage’s wife—still on the Force—a few of her Auror friends, Teddy, Nyala, a few other Level Ones and Twos. Baggot and Povey were there, not necessarily sitting with anyone. Harry sat with Teddy and Nyala, glad that on such an eventful night, Teddy had asked to spend it with him, rather than disappearing to “hang about with friends,” as he kept saying.
The little silver bumblebee was hovering around Harry’s left shoulder. “Oh,” Harry said, only half paying attention, because Malfoy and Teddy were coming over to them. “It’s Malfoy’s.”
“Do you need more?” Draco said, his wand returning to stroke lines from Harry’s legs up to his cock, down from Harry’s belly to his cock, making everything in Harry strain toward his cock, feeding it, making it grow. “Do you want to come really hard for me?” Draco murmured. “Do you want to get all greedy, get your cock so nice and hard you come the second I’m inside you?”
“Think of it, Harry,” Draco breathed, close to Harry’s ear, though fucking too hard to really stay there. “Think of something nice and thick in your mouth. Think of something hard brushing those lovely lips of yours. Think of something hard fucking against that lovely tongue.”
this is a joke, right?  You’re playing jokes?  This is a joke,” Draco said frantically, beginning to pace about.  “It’s all a joke; you’re going to Pensieve it for all your friends; you’re going to laugh at me for believing that I would—well, I
“I wish I’d known how much you’d thought about that kind of thing at this age,” Harry said, reaching for another piece of tape.  “Things might have turned out differently.”
“You can keep it in your mouth.” Draco’s voice was soft. “I just want to make sure you hear this. Do you understand?”
“Cinderella is fantastic,” said Draco, which was even more disappointing, because Cinderella was dead boring.  The idea that you could find out you had a magic godparent had always seemed so utterly unrealistic that Harry thought it was stupid.  Draco went on, “I really like the part where the crows peck out the sisters’ eyes.”
Harry had been wondering whether he might manage to read the elder Draco’s letter while the younger one babbled, but he looked up at Malfoy’s change in tone.
“Of course,” said Rodolphus, fluidly standing to go to the trunk by the back wall. “In this trunk are three Dementors.”
Harry thought about saying, because these were the things Malfoy would have once used to say that they were similarly scarred. They weren’t similarly scarred. They didn’t need to be different sides of a same coin to work together; they could be different coins. Different coins could work together. Harry didn’t know how to say all that. Not with Malfoy still his student, anyway. For instance, he could kiss Malfoy right here, set Malfoy on his desk, spread his legs, stand between them, snog him silly—
“I . . . don’t know exactly,” Draco said, frowning.  A frown on old-Harry’s face looked fierce, but it didn’t bother Harry as much anymore.  “I’ll have to go through those papers.  Would you like lunch?” he added, moving toward the stairs.
“Sure.”  At last, Harry found the book and pulled it out of the shelves.  “But I thought maybe we could read together.  How about this one?”
“Do I talk to you a lot?” Harry asked, trying not to sound eager.  He just had trouble imagining what it was like, knowing Draco and not being friends.
“Draco!”  Whirling around, Harry found Draco sitting up and looking at him blankly.  Turning back to the chair, Harry drew his wand.  “
“Of course, you would stand by a Shacklebolt,” said Pillwickle. “Is it an aid to your mental health?”
Harry thought about the Chamber of Fires, the members of the Board who had wanted Harry to pass Malfoy. They weren’t dark wizards, however—purists, maybe, but not about to cut off pieces of their souls or stage a military coup. They were just a bunch of old rich pure-bloods, upset the world was changing. “I’d think I’d know if Malfoy was going to join a murder cult,” was all Harry said. “I knew it the last time.”
Draco wasn’t having fresh-squeezed orange juice, like Harry.  Instead, he was drinking out of a mug that had a curl of steam coming from it.  From the smell of it, Harry guessed it was coffee.  Draco had had two cups of it already and now started pouring a third.  “I thought we might go out again today,” he said.
“The ledger said the radius would be increasing with my years.  It also said the interval between my steps in age would be increasing, which we’ve seen.  You’ve heavily implied that whatever caused this accident poses some kind of threat, and the ledger said you’d have Auror business.  Hadn’t you better go take care of that?”
Savage knew Harry would never willingly neglect a case—not when a brew was on the streets getting people killed.  Swallowing a sigh, Harry added the file to the growing stack on his desk.  That was how he became the go-to person for illegal potion cases, and how Draco Malfoy became the unofficial potions consultant for the entire Auror Department.
, and—and.”  Draco stopped, his eyes shining with tears.  Each time Draco cried himself raw, he went unconscious again and aged a year, then looked as if he hadn’t cried at all.
, Malfoy was going to say. Harry could practically taste the word from behind Malfoy, along Malfoy’s jaw, in Malfoy’s chest, but Malfoy was breathing too hard to say it. Harry let him go.
Moving toward the Timothy Tree, Harry took advantage of the fact that this also put space between him and Malfoy. “No harm in trying it, then,” Harry said, gesturing toward the Timothy Tree. “Do you want to say goodbye?”
Harry wanted to say, but he ignored Malfoy, instead turning to the class. “I’m going to demonstrate a series of holds,” he said, “and then we’ll work on how to get someone into those holds. That way, you know where you want to get at the end of each bout. Okay, Malfoy,” Harry said, turning back to him. “Keep your body nice and loose for this.”
Malfoy stared at him.  He stared at him so long that Harry began to imagine a coffin with what he felt for Malfoy inside of it, nails being hammered all around the rim of it to fasten a cover on, one after another.  Christ.  It still hurt, that Harry cared this much.
“Where?” Harry asked suspiciously.  Draco might be taking him to see Dudley again.  Or worse, maybe he had found Uncle Vernon and Aunt Petunia.  For the first time, it occurred to Harry that they would be really old by now.  Or maybe dead.
During the trials, magical investigators had found that evil magic still lingered around Malfoy Manor, and the manor had been destroyed as a result.  Narcissa had been released five years ago—almost a year before the first time Harry had seen Malfoy at Slug and Jiggers.  As far as Harry knew, she’d been in the Janus Thickey Ward ever since.
While there was nothing Harry wanted to talk about less than Draco Malfoy’s sexuality, he merely said, “No.”
Meanwhile, Harry couldn’t take his eyes away. He’d dreamed of Draco often since that incident with the siren tongue powder. He’d dreamed of Draco kissing him, touching him, even fucking him—and yet with all of that, he hadn’t thought too much about Draco’s cock, not explicitly. He hadn’t pictured what it would look like; he’d just pictured Draco using it on him, making Harry come, using his clever mouth, his clever hands.
Harry thought, horrified, but Malfoy wasn’t crying. He was standing in his sticky shirt, looking down at the bottle of pink liquid. Harry had been going to update Malfoy on his thoughts about the Dark Mark, but with Malfoy acting like this, Harry wasn’t sure he wanted to. Harry was still experimenting, and it could be cruel to give Malfoy hope if Harry’s ideas weren’t going to work. Best to wait a little while.
“Thank you for your gift of the Sweet Dreams. I did not adequately express my gratitude for your thoughtfulness, as I was distracted by a myriad of considerations. One such is the thought that I have known about Sweet Dreams since I was fifteen, and it seems you have not. I found myself wishing, once more, most keenly, that I had sought to know you better then, when I was fifteen; that I had sought to help you, rather than hinder you and hurt you and humiliate you. Would that I had been a better person for your sake, if not my own.
Harry wondered whether the man had knocked him out.  He didn’t remember, but the fact remained that he didn’t know where he was, and he didn’t know the man.  Harry wasn’t quite sure he had been kidnapped, as kidnapping on the telly was nothing like this at all.  Whatever was happening, Uncle Vernon wouldn’t like it, which meant Harry was going to be in trouble.  He had to get out.  Fast.
Fairly certain Draco was going to try to make him read, Harry warily sat on the edge of the couch Draco had made, feeling nervous and annoyed.  But Draco just put the large, fancy-covered book in his lap and opened to a page in the middle.  Out of the corner of his eye, Harry could see the page was full of moving pictures, which made him feel even worse.  Draco thought he couldn’t read at all.
“I never said that,” Malfoy said quickly. “Did I say that? Now who’s being wilfully ignorant? For once in your life,
After glancing at the powder under his little microscope, Malfoy had begun doing things with potions ingredients, mixing and stirring and mashing things.  “How much do you—”
“All right.” Thinking about it, Harry frowned. “Actually, it might be better if no one sees you at the Ministry either. I’ve a Portkey to the Auror Department; if you Floo directly to my house, we can go from there.”
“He should get to,” Harry said, shaking his head again. “Even if he should have been punished more than he was—even if all of them should have. Everyone should get a chance to change.”
Sorry for the wait. I have 7 more chapters. Yes, I did say there would only be 8 chapters total. I'm having a rough time with writing.
“With the UK leaving the EU,” Rune was saying, “some of the international wizarding community is hoping to isolate the UK entirely, so that Reveal wouldn’t affect the rest of the wizarding world. This would be extremely difficult for the non-magical people, obviously, as it would require isolating the UK more than it already plans to isolate itself. It would need to become another Atlantis, and I’m sure you know the last time wizards disappeared a whole island, it was four thousand years ago. There’s a reason we haven’t done it since.”
Not expecting this at all, considering where his thoughts had been, Harry rocked back on his heels a bit.
“Yes,” Harry said, realizing he must look like an idiot.  His muscles were stiff as he forced his arms down, but inside he felt shaky.
“All right,” Sibanyoni said easily. “Okay.” He snapped his fingers, and the alpaca disappeared. “It’s not for everyone. First try.” He took another sip of Coke. “How do you feel about Legilimens, then? The dream state? The sharing of the mind?”
While the faculty remained divided on how to handle the harassment of one of their trainees, Harry conducted an investigation of his own. Though the person leaving the purist messages hadn’t directly threatened her, Fairchild was understandably afraid to attend her classes at Academy. One day in March, Fairchild found her knapsack, which she had left in the cloakroom during a class, filled with mud. Harry had set up Seeing Eyes in the cloakroom, but apparently, he hadn’t got the angle right. The map Harry had made of Academy, which was modelled after the Marauders’ Map, didn’t keep a record of where people went, only showing people in present time.
He meant the fire spell, and Harry had spent enough time with Teddy and Rose and Hugo to know the answer to that question.  “No,” he said, and put his wand away.
“Sure,” Harry said, “when you had a psychopath who wanted to kill her. But who was he before Voldemort tried to murder me? Who was he, for love of my mum? Who did he decide to be?”
Harry ate the second slice of cake, then reached for a third.  The pause between eating lasted long enough for Harry to realize that his stomach ached, it was so full.  Trying to finish the third slice anyway, Harry really struggled to get the last bites in.  “Can I have more cake?” Harry asked, directly after he had finished.
“No, you need to be there,” Draco said.  “I’m not sure Auror security will allow me through, but the wards will recognize you, even if you’re young.”
Early autumn yellows bled into bright mid-autumn orange, the sky still sometimes startlingly blue against leaves the colour of fire, the scent on the air crisp with apples and the earth wet with dying leaves. Classes at Academy were not very much different than they had been the year before, but Harry felt different, less at ease with Teddy there, nervous for him in ways that even Kavika could not help him fully understand.
“He was beloved by many people,” Draco said.  “Our Headmaster.  And he loved many people in return.”
, Harry wanted to say, but didn’t.  Instead he put down the salve and opened the bottle with the orange liquid in it.  “Drink this.”
“I don’t get sick,” Harry said, because he didn’t.  He just felt bad from time to time, but not like other people.  He’d never even been sick when he was a kid—not like Dudley, helpless and crying and getting his bogies everywhere.  That just never happened to Harry.
Malfoy said nothing more, and the door only made a soft click to signify he had gone. Harry could think of nothing he wanted more than a shower, as if hot water could make his exhaustion slip away, and stop him from remembering Hogwarts—how it felt to quarrel with Malfoy in the corridors. The blood dripping down the stones, students turned to stones as well, the Inquisition Squad on patrol, the sickly stench of Snape’s classroom, the warmth of Dumbledore’s office. Dumbledore and death, so many dead.
“The Force drove me crazy because of the politics,” Harry tried to explain. “The way you could never get anywhere. I saw things—really horrible things, and I felt like . . . like I couldn’t stop it, like what I was doing wouldn’t stop it. But that’s partly why I wanted to train Aurors. New Aurors. Different Aurors. It was never . . . I didn’t think of the Force as a supremacist organization.”
“A lot of boys like her,” said Pansy Parkinson. She was stroking Malfoy’s hair as Malfoy lay across two seats of the train, his head in her lap. Crabbe, Goyle, and Zabini all looked on. “Even you think she’s good-looking, don’t you, Blaise, and we all know how hard you are to please.”
Leck Hall was so old that no panes filled the window, the cold February air blocked by ancient spells rather than glass. The day was dismal, the courtyard the brown of winter with only a few tufts the muted grey-green of England. The Timothy Tree stood barren at the centre of the courtyard, its tall, reaching branches like a bouquet of bones.
Shoving his fists in his pockets, Malfoy looked off down the street. He had on denims, which was new and different as the makeup. “Sandwich here and there is a small repayment. You saved my life several times, if I recall.”
“Oh God.” Harry gulped, relieved Draco had let him go because he was overwhelmed; it was overwhelming; no one had ever done this to him before. He didn’t even know whether he liked it, except that he did—he did like it; the way Draco was touching him made him want more and more and more of him, the way his kisses did, the way everything about Draco made him want more.
“Therefore, you have to help me,” Mister Malfoy said.  “You have to tell me if you want or need anything.  Anything you want or need, I’ll give it to you.  Do you understand?”
Andromeda’s eyes widened.  They were a deep brown, Harry saw, and then she looked back up at Draco.  “What happened?”
“Yes.” Sitting up again, Malfoy gave an arrogant little roll of his shoulders. “I bet you’d like to know where.”
“We did the sexy part.” Draco leaned in and kissed him again, and after a moment Harry realized that from this position he could touch Draco easily.
“I have no idea what you’re talking about,” Alby said, “but Aurors paying upstanding shopkeepers under the table sounds a lot like bribery, and bribery is something I would certainly report to Head Auror—”
“I bet you like the really kinky kind,” Malfoy was saying. “The kind with tentacles. And Animagi. And—”
After Apparating back to Tailored Tinctures, Harry took off the Invisibility Cloak, and Draco came running down the stairs, his wand held high in his fist.  The silver fox streaked behind him.  “Who is it?  Who’s there?  I know Incendio!”
Fairchild and Mark were part of the little army. Harry also recognized Bennet, Achar, Fuentes, Adebayo, and Wan, who had graduated last year. Fuentes was working the Mysteries, but the rest had become Aurors, which perhaps explained the cheering from the Aurors and instructors in the room. A few more Level Twos and another Level One streamed in, but Harry didn’t recognize the woman on Malfoy’s arm, who was dressed in the height of non-mag fashion and had a shaved head.
The rain continued its monotone of thipping, tenderly curving against an invisible line of air encasing Harry’s form. Eventually the warming spell bled away, and Harry ate the chocolate.
Harry thought about trying to leave again anyway, but the man was standing right there, and Harry didn’t fancy getting grabbed again.  The man hadn’t wrenched Harry’s arm or anything, but it seemed likely a grown man who was unhappy would end up hurting him somehow.  Besides, the man had already proven himself a kidnapper.  “What are you going to do with me?” Harry asked instead, holding his belt with one hand so he could push up his glasses.
“Oh!  We need to trade?  Hold on.”  Rushing back to the bedroom, Harry got his wand and glasses.  As he held out his wand to Draco, he said, “Does this mean I get to—”  But Draco was already handing Harry his own wand, which was slightly shorter and lighter coloured.  Once Harry had it in hand, he didn’t feel the big surge he’d felt holding the dark-coloured one, but there was still a little something—not unpleasant.  Still, Harry felt a bit disappointed; he had assumed Draco’s wand must be really cool.  “Will it work for me?”
friend,” Draco said, while Harry struggled to remember anybody having a girlfriend second year.  If anyone had, he supposed, it would have been Zabini.  “Why am I even talking to you about Zabini?”  The pillow muffled his voice.  “I don’t want to talk to you about
Heloise was meant to find Dudley, and Mister Malfoy had said once she found Dudley they would visit him, but Dudley wasn’t in an estate.  He was at Number Four Privet Drive, and even if Mister Malfoy had let Harry pet an owl, nothing about this seemed right.
A moan of relief opened Harry’s mouth, and he took the cock in, letting it chafe his lips on the way, letting it rest heavy on his tongue. At last, he had something to fill his mouth, to work all that wetness on. He tightened his lips and sucked, literally drooling around Draco’s cock.
Malfoy’s other arm came up around Harry’s neck, the hand still holding Harry’s wrist twisting to make Harry lose his grip on the two wands—which succeeded, since the pressure on Harry’s windpipe meant he couldn’t speak. The wand was useless; he had to focus on getting out of the hold—which he did, crouching down and using the leverage to flip Malfoy over him. Malfoy rolled out of the throw gracefully, reaching for one of the wands as he did so.
Malfoy stared at it, as though he had not just been snogging Harry silly several moments ago. Then slid off the desk and grabbed Harry’s hand. “Unto the breech,” he said.
“I don’t know, Harry,” Draco cut him off, sounding testy.  “You’ll have to tell me all about it when you grow up.”
to change, even though in some ways, he couldn’t. It was a starting place at least. “Well,” Harry said. “He’s taller.”
“No need to get political,” Pillwickle said, his voice silky. “We were speaking of the Malfoy heir.”
Harry’s stomach felt much better after having dumped a portion of its contents into the toilet, but he felt all the wrong temperatures—cold but sweaty, a little light-headed.  His mouth tasted terrible, and yet he couldn’t really think about it, because Mister Malfoy wasn’t angry.  He wasn’t annoyed or telling him to hurry up, and for once, getting sick had been entirely Harry’s fault.  Harry didn’t understand, and the worst part was the way Mister Malfoy kept running his fingers through Harry’s hair, because it felt nice.
Mister Malfoy was still clearing the table, so Harry couldn’t see the expression on his face.  Once all the jars were out of the way, he’d laid out a parchment with a quill beside it.  Finally turning back, he said, “I’m going to do a little magic on you, Harry.  It might tingle, but it shouldn’t hurt.”
Fingers slid down the crease, down to the waiting hole, wet and soiled with come. Fingers pressed against the opening, teasing muscle of the rim with light pressure as the fingers pressed some of the come back in.
“Oh,” Harry said, realizing it slowly. Like Draco’s other spells, this one had done nothing to incur desire. It had only forced his body to respond in a way it sometimes might when experiencing desire, activating salivatory glands to fill his mouth with wetness. He had to swallow to keep it in his mouth. He was almost drooling.
Malfoy turned from the window to face him. “I’m in love with you,” he said. “I don’t know why. I’ve never known why. You’re—you’re bloody impossible, and I’m—I’m—well, look at me. I was a Death Eater and I tried to kill your friends and I—well. All number of other things you’re probably too righteous to forgive.”
“I’m . . .” Harry didn’t really want the smoothie, but he liked it in his hands. Yin had added ice, so it was cold—like Malfoy’s glasses of water. Harry set the smoothie on the crowded table to his right. “I had this dream.”
Malfoy’s lips pressed together, his eyes a little too large in comparison to the vitriol that had been spilling out of his mouth not moments ago.
“Good point,” Harry said. The tree, which had always been such a point of calm for him, seemed sinister when he considered what it might symbolize. Had the founders sacrificed a non-magical just to keep the tree alive? Just to have something pretty on the green? Or was it meant to mean more—a symbol of everything Aurors should be and keep alive? Harry thought of the Chamber of Secrets, blood purism in the very foundations of what should have been a safe place for children.
Oh God. Warmth pooled in Harry’s gut. If he let himself keep looking, he was going to start thinking about how Malfoy had looked when they had sparred. He was going to start thinking about the warmth of Malfoy’s body as they had danced. He was going to start thinking about fucking him, and he wasn’t going to stop. He was going to kiss him.
He was drifting slowly, like a feather, and Draco was there, strong and warm.  “Harry,” Draco said, setting him on his feet—on the ground, but not splattered like a bug at all.  Perfectly normal.  “Harry,” Draco said again, sounding frantic.  He was touching Harry’s shoulders, his face, his hair.  “Are you okay?  Did you hurt anything?”
Kavika’s brows went up. “I’m the last person who would accuse your of being intimate with Draco,” she said, quite gently.
“Well, I . . . and you . . .” Draco scrubbed his face.  “I hang about with you, so don’t I . . . don’t we . . . ?”
“You don’t understand.”  Draco looked like he wanted to put a pillow over his face.  “Foxes are loner animals.  Not pack animals.  Not like a wolf.  Not like a dragon.”
“Why?” Harry asked.  They were in what seemed to be an office.  A desk stood in one corner by a window, while the opposite side had shelves full of weird odds and ends—bottles and phials, like in Draco’s laboratory, but also equipment, things that looked like microscopes and a hand mixer and possibly a nut cracker.
After Sectumsempra, Harry had had to have detention with Snape.  He’d missed the final Quidditch match, but Gryffindor had won anyway.  Harry had gone into the common room and they’d all been celebrating; Ginny had rushed to him with her eyes lit up. Harry had kissed her.
As far as Harry knew, Narcissa didn’t live with Draco after Azkaban.  As far as Harry knew, she was admitted straight to Janus Thickey.  Harry swallowed hard, wondering how much Draco knew at this point, wondering how much Harry should tell him.  “I thought she liked your hair?  Wasn’t she the one who—” Harry stopped himself, thinking perhaps he shouldn’t remind Draco that he knew about the ribbons.  “I thought your dad was the one who made you get it cut?”
“Sorry,” Teddy added, then put his arms around Harry. Behind them, Ron seemed to be talking to Malfoy.
Harry still couldn’t help feeling amused.  “Let’s look at those memories from the Ward Record, shall we?” he asked, going back over to his Pensieve.
“I thought . . .” Malfoy licked his lips. Actually, he did that a lot, and his lips weren’t the bad part of his face. Neither were his eyes. Nor his nose, even; it was just the sum of the pieces that wasn’t quite good-looking. “I thought I would have to bear it. The Mark. Given—what I’ve done.”
He’d never seen her in his life, and he didn’t know her name, but Harry knew who she was.  She was Dudley’s wife.  She was holding Dudley’s child, and standing there beside her—that was Dudley.  He didn’t look or sound like Dudley, and yet the cadence of his speech was the same, the flavour of his movements.  The scowl on his face was heart-stoppingly familiar, and Harry couldn’t get over the fact that the man—the old man, with a wife, with a child, with thinning hair—he was Dudley.
“Yes,” Harry said. “Last year, my—what I said about the Auror Department upset him.” Realizing that this comment was predicated on Duggins having knowledge of that press conference, Harry didn’t wait for a question, explaining how last year after the incident with Travers’s hate speech, he had told the press blood prejudice was a problem on the Auror Force.
Teddy had chosen to be bald today. That should’ve made him look older, but it didn’t; it made him look younger than his eighteen years. When he didn’t change it, Teddy had a wide brow and a narrow chin, giving his whole face a sharp, lean look that Harry thought shouldn’t remind him of a wolf. Nothing about Lupin’s lycanthropy had been hereditary, but the look was still lupine anyway. Teddy’s eyes were green today, bright and burning, flicking down to Harry’s hand, which was touching the scar on the back of his other hand.
“The fuck are you talking about, Potter.”  Draco stood up, his voice so flat that the words didn’t sound like a question.
“In an uncontrolled situation,” Parkinson was saying, “one Dementor might feast upon this unappetizing meal.” He gestured at the non-mag man. “The others, however, would see a crowded room of powerful, pure wizards, and see more souls to be taken. You’ll note in this experiment, however, that all three Dementors only evince interest in the Muggle. Not unless we go between the Dementor and its prey will the dark spirit even notice us.”
“Use it?” Hanging onto Malfoy’s hand, Robards looked over his shoulder at the other Aurors. “Of course, we can use it. You did a good job making those pure-bloods think you were on their side, too.”
“No,” Harry said, because he didn’t want Mister Malfoy to get the idea to punish him.  “I’ve never done it before,” he added quickly.
Draco was quoting again.  “Magic shouldn’t hurt people,” was all Harry could think to say.  The catch in his voice made it hard to go on.
“Thank you, Harry.”  Using his wand, Draco lit a fire underneath the pot, then started back over to his bench.
He looked down at the top of his hand—blank, smooth skin. Slowly, a laceration appeared, a straight line, followed by two curves, then another curve, then a shape like a snake.
Kavika had said, and there was no way to be a part of it without these people. There was no escaping them, not unless Harry made like Aberforth and went off to raise goats in Scotland. Sometimes Harry did want to raise goats in Scotland, and yet in the end he could never bring himself to do it. He wanted to be a part of the world.
Draco’s eyes darted to Alby, so Harry looked as well.  Alby’s face, which had been red, had lost its colour, slowly going grey.
At least some of these had to be the potions responsible for controlling Ron and Hermione.  Others were likely potions involved in other cases, all of them tied together somehow through the mysterious supplier that was trading in illegal substances from Central America and the Southern U.S.  Here might even be the big new ingredient that Ludville had said would bring Vance so much money, except Harry would never be able to identify it.  He didn’t know enough about potions.
“I don’t think you’re terrible,” Harry said, coming over to the desk.  Draco said they had to look for clues.
“Let’s try something different.  I’ll hold you until it doesn’t hurt to remember.”  Wrapping his arms around Draco tight, Harry Apparated them both upstairs, sitting down on the sofa with Draco.  “
“Don’t worry,” Draco said, his voice swift and rough. “I’ll get it properly filled. You’ll still be nice and tight once I’m in. Tell me if you want me to undo it.” Then he pointed his wand back at Harry’s belly and drew down a line to flick along the curve of Harry’s cock, which had wilted just a little without the encouragement.
Harry been holding onto the book and wand until Draco asked for them back.  “Um,” Harry said.  “I can’t see.  I took off my glasses.”
“Er,” Harry heard himself say, though even speech made him feel even more ill.  His mouth already tasted like bile.  “Can I—where’s the loo?”
“Yes, thank you.  As you can see, I’m fine here,” Draco said, gesturing around the room, “so maybe you should go.”
“Keep this straight,” Shacklebolt said. “Your world contains Death Eaters, Neo-Death Eaters, and blood supremacists. By rooting out this element, you’re not saving your world. You’re changing your world. Is that something you want?”
“I wasn’t,” said Harry, who tried to be nice to people, but hadn’t had enough coffee and felt like Spragg was a little too much like Umbridge to deserve his respect.
When Draco was twenty-one, Harry knocked on the door to Draco’s sitting-room.  Draco opened the door looking more beautiful than ever, his hair even longer.  Harry could only tell from the wisps spilling down, but Draco’s hair was long enough for him to have tied it back in a
When Draco had gone unconscious this last time, Harry hadn’t dismissed his Patronus.  Casting it in this state was difficult anyway, and having the fox around was comforting.  The fox was lingering by the couch where Draco was, looking a bit ragged.
“I’ll show you, if you’ll let me,” Harry said.  “But right now, you don’t—you don’t know me the way that I know you.  It isn’t fair to you.  And it isn’t fair to me.”
Malfoy stared at him, long and unblinking, and Harry was a little surprised at how intense that was, considering Malfoy wasn’t an adversary or anything else he apparently aspired to. “My mistake,” Malfoy said suddenly, breaking the strange spell. “Must’ve been something I drank. The cold weather. Touch of the Whoop-whoop.”
Eyes glued in horror to the chocolate splattering around the kitchen, Harry had thought Mister Malfoy was casting the spell, but the table didn’t stop dancing.  Chocolate continued to spray everywhere.
“I’m surviving. Besides, who doesn’t want to talk to Harry Potter?” But Malfoy was looking at Rune, his eyes warmer and his face softer than Harry had ever seen it. “I just wanted to see if I could bring you anything. Food? Champagne? Embarrassing stories about Hogwarts?” Malfoy waved his fingers at Harry, exactly as though they had been somehow schoolboy rivals, instead of a bully and his victim.
“I did?”  Malfoy did that thing where he got excited and then pretended he didn’t care.  “I mean, obviously I did.  I was Slytherin, wasn’t I?”
“No!”  Malfoy held onto the parchment, which pulled him up on tip-toe as it strained toward Harry’s hand.  “What is it?  What’s going on?  Where are my mum and d—”
Harry didn’t know many phone numbers.  Mrs. Figg’s was written down somewhere in a drawer at Number Four, Privet Drive, just in case, for emergencies.  Other than that, Harry knew the number for Number Four and 9-9-9.  He’d never really needed to call that many people.  Sucking in a breath, Harry went ahead and tried touching the numbers for Number Four.  As he touched them, they appeared at the top of the screen as though the device could feel which numbers he touched, just as it had felt the swipe.
Harry frowned in incomprehension.  “Malfoy,” he started to say, but Malfoy was already moving away.  Harry grabbed his arm.
“Look, I can’t explain the interior workings of Draco bloody Malfoy,” Harry said, turning away. He was agitated. He needed to pace, except Ron and Hermione’s house was small and cluttered and had children’s books and Hermione’s scrolls everywhere. When they were in school, Harry would never have supposed she would be the messy one. “He terrorized us when we were children,” Harry went on. “Can you explain half of what he did?”
“It’s my job,” said Harry, snagging them mini-sausages rolls off a passing tray, then walking with Ron to be against a wall.
“What I’d like is to believe you don’t think you were wrong just because you lost. Can’t you see that that ‘way of life’ is the reason we got into it with Voldemort in the first place?”
