For a second they both stared at each other. Malfoy didn’t look quite so stark when he wasn’t in a prison uniform, but he was still as thin. He was taller, too, and had a few inches on Harry. He was wearing a plain white shirt which was obviously too large for him and a pair of plain grey trousers. Everything he wore looked expensive and soft and his feet were entirely bare. Harry stared at them. His toes looked strangely vulnerable.
The fire caught on the pale hue of Draco’s hair, masking it and turning it almost orange. From his position, Harry could see that he was slightly red in the face and Harry remembered that they had taken the charm off to prevent people feeling the heat of the fire. He watched Draco for a moment, barely noticing the rise and fall of his conversation with Narcissa. Instead, he just watched him.
“Stop talking about me like I’m not here!”
“We didn’t think you’d clatter in here looking like something had attached itself to your face,” Ron interrupted. He met Harry’s eye, looking calmer than Harry had expected. They stared at each other for a moment and Harry felt like they were having a whole conversation. A conversation which mostly said
“No,” Harry said, shaking his head. “Listen, okay? I just want you to — I’ve heard you say you regret stuff, I guess. I just wanted you to say you wanted to keep changing. That’s it. That’s all. It’s not a lot. It
Harry blinked into Draco Malfoy’s face, mouth opening into an ‘o’ of surprise.
Harry was staring at it as he walked further into the room and it was only when he heard a noise that he turned his head and saw Malfoy clutching a bottle of firewhiskey. He then saw Malfoy’s bed, a gigantic four poster. He
Harry felt, for sure, that Malfoy had never mentioned that he owned the fanciest fucking piano that had ever existed.
There was an exhale and Draco turned onto his side, still holding onto Harry’s hand. “Did you get it?” he asked, voice low.
It was the tone of Malfoy’s voice, the way his eyebrows had raised just slightly and the exasperated tilt to his mouth that made Harry laugh, a clear, bell-like sound which rang across the kitchen. Malfoy looked startled at first, though it quickly faded away, replaced by a grin that was small and pleased.
Malfoy gestured at his notes as if that explained anything. Harry stared blankly at him until he sighed. “Some of us aren’t going to have the good fortune to be loved and admired throughout the entire wizarding world forever and ever, so I’m trying to get a head start on making a name for myself.”
This was definitely helped along by the fact that Malfoy never once mentioned it. Harry had known before that Malfoy was capricious and mercurial, flashing in and out of moods. It had been obvious at school; it was even more obvious now. Harry wasn’t sure if it was worse, either, and did not want to ask. It felt too intimate. Instead, he learned Malfoy, memorised the topography of his face: he learned the curve of his mouth which meant he was amused and hiding it, the tightness of his jaw which spoke to an anger Harry himself had not caused. He learned the way Malfoy moved: languid and graceful only when he was aware that others were watching, becoming erratic and even
He thought about what Narcissa had said and heard himself ask, “Do you think you’re losing your life here?”
Although Harry felt his explanation was perfectly sound, Malfoy very obviously and violently disagreed. He made a noise of disgust, glared at Harry and then turned as if he was going to stalk down the stairs. At the last moment, he appeared to think better of it and twirled back around. Harry noticed the shirt billowed out around him. It really was very piratey.
Blinking himself back into the present, Harry realised that both Ron and Hermione were looking at him. “You’re writing to him a lot?”
Narcissa frowned. “I admit I haven’t heard precisely that.”
“Well I appreciate it,” Ginny said, her eyes twinkling, her smile illuminating her face. “I’m happier, too. It’s not because you’re not around me, either. It’s just because I’m doing what I want and I’m trying to be who I want to be.”
“He was always so full of life,” Narcissa said finally, with a movement that almost looked like a shrug. His expression must have done something because she quickly added, “He’s fine! I just — I rather worry.”
“I like it. You should think about it more.”
Harry hated that question and, frankly, he wasn’t sure that Narcissa Malfoy would like the answer. The truth was that he’d spent weeks upon weeks attending funerals and memorials and wakes, he’d sat with the Weasley’s while their grief was still fresh and unwieldy and Molly Weasley had cleaned and banked and cooked like her life depended on it. He’d visited the Creevey family, the pit in his stomach huge and gaping and sickening, as Bobby Creevey had shown him pictures of himself in Colin’s album. He had spent more time than he cared for apologising to people and sitting with their grief and when he wasn’t doing that, he was finding friends to disappear with. The day trips to Oxford and the nights in the pub, or that time he’d desperately searched out Seamus and they had ended up accidentally exploding the wreck of a car in a scrapyard. None of it sounded overly compelling or like things he should share.
The owl came a few days later, nipping into Harry’s room and out again. Harry grinned and stared down at the familiar handwriting, shoving a gingerbread cookie into his mouth as he opened it.
He kissed him again, this time with more force behind it, and pressed Draco down until he was lying on the floor in front of the fire. Harry trailed kisses down his neck, nipping at it, his hands searching for skin and finding it but somehow it wasn’t enough. It wasn’t going to be enough. Harry tilted his head and pressed a kiss to Draco’s collarbone (somehow his shirt was off). “I want you to be naked,” he said.
Harry, clutching his mug of tea like a lifeline, nodded as if that was a perfectly normal thing. He supposed it could be, for some people. Maybe George had always secretly liked fishing. Maybe it was something that Fred and George had done. It was hard to know, so he just accepted it, and waited for Ron to come back.
Harry couldn’t say no with a threat like that. He replied still grinning, his feet firmly in the present, his heart thrumming with glee.
Harry rolled his eyes and walked across the kitchen until he was standing closer to him. Malfoy had a veritable library spread out around him, books propped open in a semi-circle and piles of parchment everywhere. He had an array of quills laid out too, all with different coloured feathers. Harry knew he couldn’t have been that frustrated yet because none of them were crushed. He picked up one of the quills and gently ran its feathers along Malfoy’s jawline, lightly tickling him. Malfoy swatted him away.
Malfoy’s head snapped round. “I’ve become very good at applying myself to things, Potter,” he said, harshly, as if Harry had said anything to the contrary. “It rather depends on occasion, but I could be a lazy child and I don’t believe that’s who I am anymore.”
“But you’d be wanking over younger me,” Harry said. “That’d be perverted.”
“I’ve been keeping myself busy,” he said, after a brief, awkward silence. “We had a lot of funerals and then, well, I’ve been visiting a lot.” Narcissa Malfoy did not need to know about depression afternoon maps either.
“What if they don’t remember?”
Harry frowned deeply. “What does that mean?”
“Are you sure you wouldn’t like to take more buns? Draco and I would hardly eat all of them.”
“Avoid. I didn’t get in touch with you.”
He liked moving around. He liked being outside and having things to do with his time, but it had been nice to spend the last few months walking peoples dogs, helping them with their pets. It had been nice and made him feel full in a way he wasn’t used to. Harry had always wanted to be an Auror but maybe that dream had died when his body had, the first time. It felt like it belonged to a different part of him, a version of himself that the past had swallowed. The him that stared back at him from the mirror didn’t want that life anymore. The him that Harry was becoming acquainted with wanted to help and liked animals.
“Ah, yes.” Malfoy nodded. “All of my misdeeds up until this point have been so clever and untraceable. They’ll be shocked at this break with tradition.”
” Malfoy clearly wasn’t actually going to respond to the questions that Harry was actually asking. Malfoy clearly had other things in mind. “You’re so self-righteous. How can you actually stand there and ask me that? How do you need things spelled out for you, every second of every day? How are you this stupid? It’s a
He knocked again.
Harry paused in his chopping and turned his head slightly to look at Malfoy, studying him as best he could from the awkward angle. Malfoy looked stiff, still, and cool, the way he tended to when he was trying not to betray what he felt. He thought about Malfoy in the corridor throwing a candlestick and talking about his house arrest. A decision made before he really thought about it, Harry knocked Malfoy with his elbow and said, “I’ll take you after you get out, sure. It was fun.”
Harry let himself fall back into the rhythm, question, answer, trying not to look at Malfoy more than he had to. It went on for longer than Narcissa’s had — much longer, actually, but he supposed the mark on Malfoy’s arm had to do with that. When Harry finally stood, dismissed by the Wizengamot, he could have demolished another one of Ron’s sandwiches. As he slunk bank into his seat, he lifted his head to look at Malfoy.
Malfoy sniffed. “I answered it, didn’t I?”
Cheeks reddening, Harry said, “I’m not worried. I was just wondering.”
“Don’t call me an idiot. Of the two of us, you’re clearly the idiot.”
Harry looked down at himself. He had dressed quickly, with little regard to what he was wearing. It hadn’t occurred to him that it would matter: they were only the Malfoy’s and Harry didn’t care about impressing either of them. His t-shirt had been lifted from the end of his bed, an eye-searingly bright yellow with a huge pelican in baby blue across the chest, something he had picked up at a gig Hermone and he had gone to. It was hideous but he had loved it. Harry shrugged. “I thought it would brighten up your day.”
made him feel like he was crumbling, a little: he’d known Malfoy so long, seen him so many different ways, and yet he couldn’t help but be taken aback by how he looked now.
Ron came up behind Hermione and looped his arm around her waist, leaning over her to look at breakfast. “I quite agree, Hermionicus.”
, Potter, there are candlesticks everywhere.” Malfoy spoke distantly, as if he was barely interested in the words he was saying. He dropped his hands from his face and looked at Harry instead with an intensity which left Harry feeling breathless and somehow unprotected. His lungs were tight; the hall was too small; he wanted to go outside again. Instead he blinked up at Malfoy and pulled a face. Malfoy’s mouth quirked into a smile but it was fleeting, disappearing quickly. He was still staring at Harry too much. “Potter, I don’t need you to witness every terrible moment of my life.”
Harry frowned, straightening up from his slouch. “I am not brooding,” he snapped.
Harry stared at Malfoy’s back before quickly realising he needed to hurry if he wanted to know where he was going. He pulled his trainers off and kicked them by the side of the door, running after Malfoy. His socked feet slipped against the tiles and after the second time he nearly went skidding he shouted out, “Malfoy, are you not going to slow down?”
“Hermione, you’re wonderful,” Harry said immediately. “You’re the best.”
to them now, a deference that made the back of his neck itch and which existed even amongst the Wizengamot. When he’d mentioned how uncomfortable this made him to Ginny, almost whispered it into her hair, she’d smiled and touched his neck and said, “You should try to brazen it out.”
Glancing around, Harry tried to square his shoulders and remind himself of her advice. Her voice had been rich, smooth, carelessly casual. He could be rich, smooth, carelessly casual and brazen. He could meet all their eyes and push through the odd gleam. Harry smiled at a few he recognised, tilting his head in acknowledgement at the others. Several smiled, but he could tell from looking at them that they weren’t quite sure what to make of his presence.
Malfoy wavered. His back was curved but felt like steel under Harry’s hand. Malfoy lifted one hand to the side of Harry’s face, fingers dragging through the short hair by his ear. “Potter, you look like something that crawled out of the grave,” Malfoy said. He was practically whispering the words, pressing them into Harry’s skin. “I’m not going to do this with you right now. I think you’d regret it.”
Harry stared at her, unsure of what to say. He wasn’t good at this stuff. Being reassuring had never come naturally to him, not when there was a tangle of ugly emotions underneath, not when he could feel his
Harry smiled. “I mean, maybe, but you don’t look very chained up to me.”
“This is too nice for you to push me into mud.”
It was chilly but not particularly cold. Harry felt the wind hit his cheeks and knew he would be red-cheeked, but he didn’t feel the need for any sort of warming charm. There was something about the winter air that made him feel alive. Ginny dropped down to sit on the steps leading down from the back door and Harry followed her a minute afterwards.
Harry decided to get all of them a glass of wine, deliberately disappearing into the utility room for a few minutes to give them some privacy.
The question sat uncomfortably in the air, the sharp tang of it invading Harry’s senses. It made his stomach turn but he couldn’t let Hermione know that. She’d been there for him so much; he was going to be there for her. Moving onto his knees properly, he shuffled closer to the fire and said, “You’re going to, Hermione. I promise. I bet you’ve already done more than you think you have, because you always downplay that, and I know you’re going to get them back.”
“What are you going to do?” Harry asked, turning towards Ron.
you to visit. Don’t be so absurd.” He quickened his pace just slightly. “I told you that Blighter was threatening poison and I’m trying this new thing called radical honesty.”
“Who do you think you are? Who do you think he is? Of
“We’ll ask them to move it,” Harry said. “We’ll explain what’s happening and they’ll have to move it.”
you’re here, Potter. I can’t help but know.” Malfoy did not sound particularly pleased about it. In fact, it sounded like it pained him to know that Harry was there. He looked ill and sharp, looking at Harry with the kind of expression he couldn’t interpret. He propped his elbows onto the lid of the piano and buried his face in his hands. His shoulders didn’t slump despite the position. He looked tired but he still held himself like he was in a fight that he wasn’t prepared to lose.
“No,” Harry said slowly. “I’m very sure I would have remembered you bringing it up properly. It seems like something I’d pay attention to.”
“That’s — well that’s horrific, I hate that.”
life. It didn’t make any sense.
“All right,” he said finally. He felt some of the tension leave Malfoy’s body. “I’m going to shower now. You can leave.”
He woke up one Sunday, in the dying days of August, and over breakfast received three owls: one from Kingsley; one from Ginny; one from the Malfoy’s.
Ginny scrunched her nose. “Why are all the Malfoy’s so weird?” she asked. “
“Maybe. There’s not much else to do.” His voice had slipped back into bitterness.
Harry bit back his first retort and then his second, trying to will away any urge to hit Malfoy, yell at him, or chuck the cup of tea around him. He thought about doing it for a blissful moment and then said, like someone who was trying to be a grown up, “Malfoy, it’d be nice if you weren’t a prick for like twenty minutes.”
“I don’t care what you want,” Malfoy said, cheerfully. “In fact, I am making it my mission in life to do the opposite of what you want.”
“What are you doing?” Harry asked.
Malfoy’s nostrils flared. “So there’s something wrong with me?”
Harry laughed and reached for one of the remaining cupcakes, coffee and walnut, and began to pull it apart as he watched Ron wolf down the rest of his cupcake. “Merlin it’s just so good,” Ron said again, shaking his head. “I wonder if she makes them herself.”
There was a beat, the prosecutor pausing as he glanced towards the members of the Wizengamot, obviously debating with himself about what he was going to do next. Finally, he nodded and said, “Of course, Mr Potter. Thank you very much. Now, if you don’t mind, I’d like to go over the night you say Mr Malfoy refused to identify you.”
One of the best things about the man that Ron was becoming was how rarely he seemed truly surprised by questions. He blinked at Harry only once and then made a noise which was almost swallowed by the roar of the kettle. “Like Charlie?”
Still, it made Harry feel better.
“What do you want?”
It was finally time to leave and Harry stood when Narcissa did. Malfoy remained seated.
He stood, walking past Herbert (
good at, so instead he had thrown himself into things he thought he was good at. He took Mrs Ormsby’s dogs out for walks and runs; he fed them; he played with them. He liked it so much he started offering dogwalking services in the local area, walking the estates and making friends with people and their pets alike.
“What’s the right way?” Harry reached into the shower and turned it on. Malfoy’s gaze flicked between the shower and Harry and the door.
Harry laughed then nodded solemnly, as Hermione dug her elbow into Ron’s ribs. “I completely understand. I’ll even let you break my glasses, if you want.”
Harry stared at Malfoy, lifting a hand to rub to nervously rub at the back of his neck. “I thought maybe we could go for a walk.”
Harry didn’t know how he had got so lucky to have all these people in his life who loved him, who wanted him to be happy, who knew him or were coming to but he was so full of hope and love and joy that he could choke. He reached out and wrapped an arm around Ginny and they sat there, talking in low voices for half an hour before George came out to drag them inside.
“To my boredom, yes.” Malfoy looked over at his pile of papers. “I’m doing a long distance course. One of the institutes in France agreed to it.”
It just somehow felt even less possible when there was no villain to beat. Harry hated that. He wanted something concrete that he could destroy, an enemy to pursue rather than the tangled web of the memory that he didn’t understand. He squeezed his eyes shut and shuffled closer to Ron and wished, momentarily and fiercely, for a normal life, with normal problems.
Draco shrugged. Harry’s head moved with it. “A long time. Nearly too long. I woke up and I,” for a moment he trailed off, clearly not wanting to mention the note, voice faltering before he said, “I wasn’t awake for very long. The alarm you set woke me up so thanks.”
Harry watched him for a moment, flipping through one of the books he’d pilfered from the library, a smile playing at the corners of his mouth. “Yeah,” he said, softly. “Yeah, I’d really like that.”
“All right,” Harry said. He stepped away, putting the piano between them. Harry didn’t know what had gripped him, what drove him to his feet, but there was a panic at the bottom of his stomach and a gaping hole in his chest. “Malfoy, if that’s the way it is then I don’t see the point in...whatever this is.” He flapped a hand between his torso and Malfoy, the gesture so huge that he nearly hit the top of the piano.
Harry swallowed and said, “You can sit down too. You don’t need to stand there.”
“Oh, did you?” Harry asked. “When did I tell you that again?”
“I’m committing this to memory,” Draco said. “I’m committing you to memory. I don’t think this is real.”
Ron nodded, slowly. “So are you thinking about it now?”
The smoothly related truth startled Harry. His fingers twitched around the teacup and some of the tea sloshed over the side onto his hand. Harry looked at it morosely, knowing he couldn’t lick it away. Instead he grabbed for a napkin, dabbing at his hand and looking at the floor in the hopes he hadn’t spilled any. “You aren’t getting on?”
“Yeah, maybe.” Ron fell quiet and Harry followed suit. Neither of them spoke again until they were out in the fresh October air, which had brought with it a fresh October downpour. Harry put up his hood and Ron wrinkled his nose, casting a charm to keep the worst of the rain off him. “You know, she asked me to mind the neighbour’s dogs? You know Mrs Ormsby? Apparently she asked Hermione to do it while she’s off visiting her son in Nicaragua or something.”
Malfoy’s mouth twisted into a shape that Harry couldn’t comprehend and he leaned backwards in his chair, tipping it onto its back legs. “I heard that you never regret something if you follow your heart.”
“You definitely are, Potter. Blighter’s already very kindly informed you that we were busy.” Malfoy’s frown was deep enough that Harry could see it from the bottom of the stairs. Also, he hated standing at the bottom of the stairs while Malfoy lounged at the top. He put his foot on the bottom stair.
Ginny let out a bark of laughter which did not sound amused in the slightest. “I don’t think I ever will be a hundred percent sure, you know? I think a part of me still wants to stay here and look after everyone and spend time with you.”
“I’m going to walk him out.”
Draco shut it. He was almost silent as Harry told him about his week, as he doled out tales of the different animals he had seen and everything he could remember Patrick say. Draco moved his head to watch Harry talk and Harry knew he had his full attention, could tell how deeply he was listening. Draco’s eyes followed every single one of Harry’s hand movements and eventually he reached out, catching hold of Harry’s hand,  and turning it over to trace the lines of his palm. Harry shuddered, a spark of pleasure going up his spine, but he kept talking and talking until he felt like he’d talked too much.
“Nothing like — we’ve never really talked. It’s not our thing.” Harry shrugged, letting his shoulders stay up against the cold.
“We should go in,” she said eventually and, as one, the three of them stood. Hermione looked between Ron and Harry and then nodded to herself, taking a step back. “I’m going to get us a seat.”
“You’re so passionate,” he said.
“Don’t be a dick.” Harry was very proud of himself for how neutral his tone was, something he knew from years of experience he wasn’t good at around Malfoy.
As he scribbled off his note, he thought that maybe he could get his own after.
Draco barked out a laugh. “Well, she thinks I
By the time they were finished it was well into the afternoon. Harry barely would have noticed. He ate better now, but the years at the Dursley’s and the year on the run had changed his appetite, made it easier for him to ignore when he was hungry. Draco flew up to him at one point, his face wild and alive and gleeful, and said, “Come on, Potter. We’ve left lunch so late that it’s practically dinner.”
When he pushed open the door, he thought maybe it didn’t matter if it wasn’t. He would find one. He would find somewhere he loved and he would be okay.
Harry trailed after Draco to his room and then pressed him against the bedroom door and took off his clothes as easy as breathing. When he slid down his body and dropped to his knees, Draco mewled and twisted his hands in Harry’s hair. He looked down at him, eyes glittering with something Harry wouldn’t, couldn’t name.
“You don’t think something else could be afoot?”
Harry blinked wondrously and walked up the llane. As he walked, he thought about firelight on Draco’s pale hair and how cold his hands got and how easily he flushed. He pictured Malfoy’s eyes and thought about his hands in Harry’s hair and how their hips fit together.
Narcissa blinked at him, ice itself, and inclined her head. Harry stared at her and reached for Draco as he passed by, fingers open. He didn’t grab for his hand. He didn’t know what stopped him but he couldn’t make himself and his fingers brushed ineffectually against the side of Draco’s hip. Harry thought his movements stuttered for a moment but it could have been his imagination because he was out of the library before Harry could collect himself to speak again.
Because he couldn’t do anything else, Harry followed.
Harry headed towards her. “Good morning,” he said and she smiled and greeted him back. “What’s up?”
When he arrived, two days later, he looked tired and drawn, like he hadn’t had much sleep. Standing in the doorway to the kitchen, he lifted a hand in a wave and slunk across the tiles. “Hey, Harry,” he said, as he reached for Hermione and pulled her into him, mouth descending into her curls. Harry tried not to look too closely as Ron’s eyes fluttered closed and Hermione's body curved towards him, her arms reaching to wrap around Ron’s waist. They swayed together, in the middle of the kitchen, Ron breathing into Hermione’s hair.
Harry looked at her and nodded, slowly. “Honestly, I figured as much. What is it?”
“Maybe.” Ron frowned. “I kind of borrowed them with an end date.”
He did not tell her how Ginny had dumped him but conversation was slightly less stilted afterwards and Harry felt moderately better when he stood to leave.
“Yes,” Malfoy said. “I’ve noticed that.”
“No,” Harry admitted. He made a considering noise. “It’s more like stalking. You’re right.”
“The wine won’t help with that,” Hermione said.
He was deliberately trying not to focus on that this time.
Harry reached out and nudged Ron. “I don’t think Hermione’s going to want a tea towel, to be honest with you. She might be a bit put out by it.”
to. He knew exactly what the invitation had said. Glancing at his watch again, he lifted his hand and banged the knocker several times against the door.
“You asked me something you should
“Malfoy, believe it or not, I’m not here to see you. I’m here to see your mother.”
“No. No. Look, it’s called justice. I — I’m trapped here because I tried to ruin a lot of other people’s lives. I tried to ruin yours too, once. I’ve had a lot of time with it and I think I get it. It’s only fair that I lose some of mine.” Draco still looked stern and hard, but there was a deep melancholy in his voice that Harry hated. He hated it, which was strange, because at the same time he was fiercely proud of Draco. “Of course I’m losing some of my life though. It’s the whole point.”
Ron snorted. It was a loud sound, clear enough that it drew the momentary attention of the young mother and her son. Harry laughed into his hand, delighted with the small wave Ron aimed at them. “Harry,” Ron said gravely, “I think I’d figured that out for myself. You’ve never really hung around with people you don't like. Now, don’t get me wrong, I don’t understand it one bit and I think you should also be doing something else, but if you’re not letting depression naps take over your life then I reckon we’ll deal with it.”
“You spent far too much time with Dumbledore.” Malfoy’s voice sounded faint, as if he was sitting further away than he was. When Harry returned with their refilled glasses Malfoy looked as if he had suffered under a horrible thought and was not best pleased about it. He gratefully took the glass from Harry and downed it in two gulps. Harry watched the line of his neck in surprise. When he drained the glass, he looked at Harry with a challenge in his eyes. “Well, Potter, hurry up. You don’t want to be so far behind. There are terrible consequences.”
“Do you think we should just send her these?” he asked finally, after he’d picked up another one and found little that made much sense to him.
Ron beamed even more. “It’s all those chess games you let me trounce you in.”
“I’m not
“Of course we do, Harry,” Ron said, stretching the arm that was wrapped around Hermione out to pat awkwardly at Harry’s knee. “You’re family.”
Harry laughed. He didn’t mean to but he did and then he had to slam his hand over his mouth, eyes wide. An apology rushed out of him and then he said, “I just think — with everything that’s happened, I don’t know if he needs protection as much as care, you know?”
Harry was still immediately and both Harry and Blighter turned, looking up at Malfoy.
Malfoy was conspicuously and notably absent the next time Harry arrived at Malfoy Manor, only four days later. For a moment during the visit, Narcissa looked as if she wanted to say something, her mouth open and head tilted to the side in a gesture Harry realised he recognised from Malfoy. It seemed to pass quickly enough, however, and the whole visit would have been entirely unremarkable if Blighter did not inform him at the door, “Master Draco has asked me to tell you there is a gift in with the cupcakes Mistress Narcissa has sent this time.”
“But,” Draco started then stopped. He was still on the ground and he tilted his head back to stare at Harry. He looked more than a little confused and a lot lost. They looked at each other for a long moment and then Draco reached his hand out towards Harry. Harry moved forward to grab it and let himself be tugged down onto the ground.
“Yeah, you are.” She had not let go of his hand. Instead, she was gripping it with an intensity only matched by the weight of her gaze “I don’t think you realise that. You’re asking everyone to wait on you right now. I know Kingsley spoke to Ron and you about the Auror training. I know McGonagall talked to you about exams. I
Harry shook his head. “That’s not — I spend Christmas with you. If you want me there. If your mum wants me there.”
Malfoy, looking for all the world as if he had no earthly idea how this was his life, scowled even deeper. “You’re not meant to
They had both stopped, staring at each other, Harry’s heart in his mouth. Harry could not remember what he had said or done but he had been in his bed ten minutes later so he supposed that it must have been enough for no one to have an argument. He hadn’t written to Malfoy since. He wasn’t quite sure what to say. He didn’t know how to pick apart the dense forest of emotions somehow contained within his body, a thing he was emphatically
“Yeah,” Harry said. “It is obvious.” He didn’t say anything else for a long moment, instead staring straight into Draco’s face, clocking every change in his expression. He did look better, much more rested. The bags under his eyes were still there but Harry suspected it would take more than one night’s sleep to eradicate them. His hair was neat and he had clearly taken great care in choosing his outfit. Harry smiled into his face.
“Oh,” Harry said again, but it was different this time. He thought he got it now. He ran his thumb up Draco’s and moved closer to him, chasing his body heat. Pressing a kiss to the hinge of Draco’s jaw he said, “I think you’ve got a great life ahead of you. I’m really proud of you.”
Draco sighed loudly. He set his quill down and folded his hands in front of him. It was very prim, which was hilarious. Harry tried not to smile. “For your information,” Draco said, “it wasn’t at all for a laugh. As you know, I have a mandatory meeting once a week with one of the therapists that the Ministry approved. She suggested that I write out everything that I had done. She suggested I try to make amends.”
Harry desperately tried to will the right words to come out of his mouth. “You’re not shit at it,” he murmured. “You’re not. You can do anything you want.”
He caught Malfoy’s eye at one point and saw them widen, shock passing over him, followed by a long, slow reddening of his face.
“I’m not telling you that.”
Grinning, he said hello to Blighter and allowed himself to be led to the study yet again. It wasn’t quite as bad this time and, when he left, he was sent off with two boxes of cupcakes and without seeing Malfoy again.
Harry thought about it. “I don’t know. I don’t think so. Maybe.”
people that part of you has changed. You have to make them believe you. You have to try to be a better version of yourself. I don’t reckon it’ll be easy for you at all, actually, because you were such an unbearable arse for the last eighteen years of your life, so it’ll probably be a slog. And maybe things will be hard, because they usually are, but I don’t think you’ll be imprisoned forever by the ‘chains of your past.’”
They were so very clothed. They were so very clothed and here, grinding against each other in the middle of Malfoy’s kitchen, with Malfoy’s schoolwork spread behind Harry. Harry clutched at Malfoy, pressed his face against his shoulder and then said to his skin, “I’m going to do something.”
Harry came home at the start of April to the sound of Hermione crying. Dropping his backpack, his heart seized, his chest constricted with fear and Harry’s legs pumped, carrying him through the house. The back door was open and Hermione was sitting on the back step, bent over. Harry shouted her name and she turned.
but he doesn’t know you. You can do whatever you want to do.”
Harry rolled his eyes and decided he wasn’t going to pay attention to Ron, who clearly didn’t deserve it because he was trying to interrupt Harry’s precious time with his Shreddies. Spooning some into his mouth, he shrugged and said, “I’ve stuff to do today.”
“Don’t be a dick, Malfoy.”
“Hmm interesting,” Hermione said, stroking at her non-existent beard. Harry waved a spatula at them but neither Ron nor Hermione cracked a smile. “I can see how that would scare away predators — it’s quite a cacophonous sound.”
Harry grinned lopsidedly. It sounded like the exact kind of polite invitation he expected — something that Narcissa didn’t mean, but felt that she had to say. What else would she be able say after having tea with someone who had testified for her? Harry wondered if she would be relieved if he told her that he had no intentions of coming back, then decided not to. If she was going to be polite, he could be too. “Thanks,” he said instead.
“To the garden.”
Harry nodded, slowly. The movement was awkward, considering he was still cradling his chin. He kind of wished he hadn’t done it. Ginny turned her face so she was looking directly at him, but she hadn’t yet sat up. Harry searched for an answer and said, “So you’re going somewhere then?”
Harry jumped and his head shot up. Malfoy stood a few feet in front of him, head tilted to one side, peering at Harry like an exotic bird. Harry couldn’t tell if Malfoy was wearing one of his too-large pirate shirts again. “What?” he asked, dumbly.
“Fine!” Harry said, throwing his hands in the air. “Fine! You don’t want me near you! But can you just listen to me? You’re going off on one and not listening to me.”
“Yeah, I was.” Harry squeezed Hermione’s hand, hard, and she looked at him. He made a face at her and saw her visibly relax, just a little. “I was excited, but I don’t know if she’s wrong either. I haven’t really thought about it and Ginny obviously has. She just kept asking me what I wanted and I realised I didn’t know. I didn’t really know and I hadn’t been thinking about it at all.”
“Mate,” Ron said, gently.
He looked away to maintain that it was a casual offer, a normal thing that he could or would have done at any time. Malfoy’s eyes were hot on the side of  Harry’s face, but Harry kept methodically chopping and did not look at him.
Draco had been insistent that there was no point decorating for Christmas. He rolled his eyes whenever Harry mentioned it and flapped his hand through the air as if dispelling the very suggestion. He shook his head and refused and said “I don’t much care for Christmas” and turned bright red when Harry laughed at him and tried to recreate the expressions he’d seen on younger Draco’s face that told him that he was now a filthy, rotten liar. Harry hadn’t pressed it but somehow, a few days ago, he had found himself with an armful of decorations, following Draco around the house.
“A list of the things you think you’re stuck over. Then we can work on it.” Hermione was practically beaming now. “It’ll be a new project!”
He wasn’t sure if that was good but it still made him feel lighter.
The laughter carried on for long enough that Harry had time to sip at his own drink as Ginny regained her composure, face almost as red as her hair, dashing tears of laughter out of her eyes. “I’m so sorry,” she gasped out. “It was just your
“I suppose it wouldn’t be,” Hermione said, propping her chin onto her first. She looked around the kitchen. “The Wizengamot took a lot from the Malfoy’s and it’s hardly as if the Death Eaters left Malfoy Manor all neat and tidy.”
“Yes. I think it may have been Peregrine, the fool.” Noticing Harry’s look, Narcissa said, “Most of the old wizarding home’s have ghosts, Harry. Malfoy Manor has been here a very long time and undergone a period of extreme upheaval in the recent months.”
That startled a laugh out of Harry. He looked at her, slightly bewildered, eyes round and searching. There was no other way. He didn’t have it in him to come up with a plausible excuse, not when he’d slept so little and spent so long replaying one argument for the past twenty-four hours. “Malfoy told me not to come back. I mean, your son. Draco.” Harry frowned. “You know what your son’s name is.”
The questions were mostly a blur, backwards and forwards and Harry frowning deeply at the prosecutor.
Harry’s face was red and he scowled at Draco, trying to press the urge to laugh with him away. “Okay so I’m not great but —”
“Shoes off, Potter, and follow me.”
Harry tilted his head to the side. He turned his gaze away from Ginny and looked out at the Weasley's garden. The sun had long since set and it was dark now but he knew this garden, knew where everything was, knew what every shape was even if it was far off and barely discernible in the night. He squinted at his favourite tree in the distance and thought about it. “I think I’m getting there,” he said, finally. “I’m still not sure who that is all the time, but I’m getting closer to who I want to be.”
“Yes,” Malfoy said, trying for airy and sounding oddly stiff. “I suppose I did.” Silence sat between them again, sharp as a thorn Harry found himself reluctant to prick himself on. Malfoy did not have the same compunctions. After a minute, he sighed. “Potter, if you tell someone you’re debating your future it’s only polite to share how. Are you weighing up the pros and cons of tell-alls to each publication? My advice is to go for the one which pays the most.”
“I wouldn’t have,” Draco said, churlishly. “I was — it’s not important. The important thing is that I know she loves me, but I — I let her down a lot. Because I wanted something stupid.”
“Yeah but you weren’t, were you? You’re here. You’re very you. You’re very uniquely yourself and whatever happened — that’s not you now. You’ve told me that and I believe you.” Harry stepped closer, nearly treading on the toes of Draco’s shoes. “You are yourself. You’re still here. She didn’t mean that.”
“I’m sorry,” Draco said quietly, realising that he had never said those words to the man in front of him. Then he cast a sobriety charm.
Encouraged Draco ploughed on.
Harry doesn’t seem to notice and keeps praising Draco and touching him in ways that make Draco feel filthy and used.
Potter slammed Draco back into the wall for a second time, pinning his wrists beside his head. Draco’s skin chafed as it came into contact with the rough fabric of the wallpaper and he was sure that Potter’s strong grip would leave bruises on his pale skin.
“What was that?”
“Have a seat, I’ll just fetch the lenses and then some frames I thought you might enjoy trying on.” With that Potter left. Was it just Draco’s imagination or did he seem slightly nervous.
“Stop that,” Pansy said, “you’ll crease the fabric.”
“I asked first.”
Somebody – probably Harry – must have cast a spell, because the front door flew open with a bang, revealing two figures almost collapsing in helpless bouts of giggles.
“Come on, we have to hurry, we can’t let that little Death Eater scum get away!” one of the men called and Harry suddenly felt cold. They were talking about Malfoy, they were going to drug him and abduct him and Merlin, they had intended to rape him. Harry was so caught up in his realisation that it took him a moment to notice that Malfoy was rubbing himself against Harry’s thigh. A sharp pain on the skin of his neck told Harry that Malfoy had just given him a hickey.
Potter began to fidget on the other side of the lift, threading his fingers into each other and getting more and more restless by the minute, glancing anywhere but at Draco. Potter was staring into the corners as if expecting or maybe hoping for some kind of monster to manifest to give them something to talk about. Then again, maybe Potter was claustrophobic. Draco decided to take pity on him.
“Essentially, yes. Not just underreported though, just not reported at all. I’m not sure how high this goes, but you probably know more about that than I do.”
“Malfoy! I was right then, it was your watch!” The man said jovially. He cleaned his hands on an already dirty piece of cloth and advanced on Draco hand outstretched in greeting. Draco could not believe his eyes.
“Shh, it’s fine, it’s all going to be ok.” Harry rocks them back and forth until Draco has calmed down enough to be open to reason.
The shout startled them both. And Harry barely avoided whacking Draco in the face with the back of his head as they both flailed about trying to figure out what was going on.
“Fuck!”
“Malfoy? What are you still doing here?”
He’d once made the mistake of actually showing up with everyone else and had been forced to realize that nothing had changed. He’d been shoved, cursed “Death Eater scum”, had been spit on and somebody had even set his cloak on fire. In the end he had to flee into the tiny space of one of the men’s rooms, jamming his shoulder against the door while quickly applying a locking charm to escape his tormentors.
The all too familiar challenge and its riposte lightened the mood considerably. Harry and Draco crossed their forks like blades, and then both dug in simultaneously. Draco ended up being the one who couldn’t finish his half of the cake, because the chilli was too hot for him and he could feel his mouth go numb. Harry only mocked him gently for it claiming the rest of Draco’s half as his price and demolished it with gusto.
Draco’s laughter was loud and carefree and Harry couldn’t help but join in. They laughed until their bellies hurt and each time they looked at each other they started all over again. When they finally managed to calm down Draco was half hanging over Harry’s back, trying to keep himself and Harry upright. Their faces were close to touching, Harry would only need to lean forward a few inches to close the distance and taste. He held Draco’s gaze and leant in slightly only to have Draco blush furiously and disentangle himself quickly.
“But he doesn’t like me.”
“Harry?”
He tried to sit up to look around properly, but the minute he did, blinding pain stabbed through his skull. He groaned and reached for his forehead as if that would cause the pain to go away. His fingers came away warm and wet and weirdly sticky. When Draco opened his eyes again, he could see something glistening on his fingertips in the dim light, something else he could finally make out was Sophia sitting on his chest and clawing and biting at him in distress.
Come back to me, please, please come back to me.
Harry took a careful step forward, not wanting to startle the man in front of him, racking his brain for why he might have wanted to come here.
“Yes, here, look.”
Harry was surprised at the wave of relief he felt at Malfoy’s words. He watched the other man stride through the field for a little while longer, before he let his feet carry him back to the lighthouse.
are from.”
“Are you alright?”
He was trying to move on, he really was. He’d declined Draco’s last invitation to visit him at the Manor and hadn’t replied to the last two letters he had sent. Despite that, he still hadn’t been ready to let go entirely, and he’d only realised that when nothing of Draco remained in his life. Harry hid all this from his friends – but especially from Ginny.
The bird was looking down at him curiously, as if he was trying to decide whether Draco was going to die soon enough to be worth its time. If he hadn’t known better, he would have thought he was looking at an animagus.
“Gin, please, just go with the others, I’ll catch up!”
The intruding cold finally ended Draco’s reverie, he shivered and pulled his cloak tighter around himself. After one last regretful look he let the phial slide back into his pocket and got up.
“Do what?”
Taking a sip of his tea gives Harry time to mull over what he has just heard.
“I…no, of course not. I, sorry.” Harry said and then blushed prettily under Draco’s scrutiny. Hardly a trace was left of the self-assured physician who had so deliciously tortured Draco only a week ago. “It wasn’t very professional of me, I know, but somebody told me you might be interested and I just couldn’t let the chance pass me by.” The words left Harry’s mouth in a rush, making it hard to understand him properly. “And you are special, you always have been… I thought you knew that…”  with that he became silent, looking anywhere but at Draco and trying but failing to hide the evidence of his embarrassment behind his paper coffee cup.
“Isn’t it beautiful?”
Draco doesn’t know whether this is a memory or one of those moments he always hoped to experience. There have been many of those intermingled between the ones he has been able to identify as actual memories. This one feels different though, hazy and dangerous. Draco knows that it involves Harry, it feels like a memory, but it is not a familiar one. This never happened.
Draco stops moving and Harry’s fingers encounter the damaged skin in the centre of his cheek. It is warm and sticky, nothing like what Harry remembers from their youth. Harry is afraid of hurting Draco, but it seems like Harry’s touch is actually soothing the ache somehow.
This voice was different, filled with accusation, hatred almost, hatred directed at him he realised, before it too faded away.
His heart was still racing by the time Harry was slowly climbing down the stairs to the kitchen to make himself a cup of tea. The task seemed almost impossible with how much his hands were shaking. In the end, Harry took his wand and simply set things in motion. While the ritual of making tea usually calmed him down, today was not that day.
Harry walked up to the bar and ordered a cider and the first type of pub grub on the menu. He didn’t really mind what he got, as long as it was warm and he didn’t have to make it himself. Looking through the pub revealed several of the men in the room to be fishermen, discussing today’s catch and complaining about the strong currents that appeared every autumn, making the navigation of the passage out to the open sea treacherous and nerve-wracking. Feeling was slowly returning to his limbs, the low beamed ceiling keeping in the heat and the beer warming him from inside. When the food arrived it turned out to be some local variation of a cottage pie with a side order of chips and a sad looking salad consisting of three tomato slices, half a carrot and a limp piece of lettuce. Despite its appearance the food was delicious and it wasn’t long before Harry put his cutlery to the side, ordering another beer.
“What if it matters to me?”
going?” Harry asked making air quotation marks when inventing a name for what Draco supposedly did with his time.
The anticipation was beginning to become unbearable. Draco grabbed his wand after glancing at his reflection one last time – this would have to do – and apparated to Diagon Alley.
“Is this a star map of some kind?” Harry asked, still completely in awe.
to him and he couldn’t help but smile. It was going to be a beautiful day and going back to bed suddenly felt like a sacrilege. Draco decided to take a shower and get dressed instead. When he was done, he had Holly serve him a large mug of coffee with three sugars and no milk. The tiny house elf somehow managed to look at his lack of manners with disdain without apparently having to iron her ears for it, as she watched Draco dip his croissant into his drink. Her expression didn’t change as he disappeared into the Manor without sitting down for a proper breakfast.
He knew she was right of course; he would regret this, but not because of the reasons she anticipated. He would regret the strain this break-up would put on his relationship with Ron and the Weasleys in general. Ginny would probably manage to convince at least Molly that he was seeing someone else. Molly would lean on Ron to get Harry to abandon this way of living, getting Hermione on his case in the process. Constant nagging would become a fixture in his life for the next few months, but at least he wouldn’t have to put up with Ginny’s temper tantrums anymore.
Draco! Draco would be looking for him. But what if he was too late or worse, what if the creature caught him as well? What if it already had?
“I was just wondering…” he gasped as Harry nibbled at his earlobe, “because I was thinking of taking a flat in London, Wiltshire is too far away.”
“I am going to conjure a series of letters that will start out big at the top and get smaller and smaller the further down they go. Please read out any letters you can make out, starting at the upper left-hand corner.”
“Merlin, will you lighten up a bit, it’s not like this is a date or something.”
“Well, face it, karma is a bitch! What do you expect me to do Potter? To just forgive and forget because you’ve been down on your luck?”
“Oh, the doctor said not to use magic and I like the cool evening air. The mosquitoes, however, not so much.” The lie fell easily from his lips. Because on top of sitting in the cool evening air, he also enjoyed being able to look outside at the stars, but telling revealing that to Harry felt much too intimate.
“Any specific age group?”
In his mind it was hard to decide where he ended and Draco began. He couldn’t remember anymore why being apart was a good idea. It felt like he was two people – one who rejoiced in the logical choice of getting married, having children with the woman he loved and sharing an uncomplicated family-oriented life with her, and the other person discarded logic and was all passion and need. Even remembering touching Draco’s skin would make his hand twitch in response, as if it was unconsciously trying to re-enact the moment.
Looking around in the dim light of the Lumos, with the storm beginning to rage outside, Harry finally spotted the fireplace. As he approached the hearth lit itself with a loud whoosh, slowly filling the space with warmth and light. Harry slid his wand back into the sheath attached to his wrist and pulled an old armchair closer to the flames, stretching his feet as close to it as possible. It didn’t take long for him to fall asleep.
“So, you are saying the first thing you did, after breaking up with her was seek me out to mend fences?”
Draco knew he was being petty, but the Aurors hadn’t done him any favours since the war was over and while he had been a bully during his time at Hogwarts he found that he didn’t much enjoy being bullied himself in return. Draco grew frustrated as he cast a series of different spells that were supposed to help him locate the diary, but any spell that was intended towards the book itself seemed to die on him before it had even reached half of its potential.
Harry raised his wand threateningly.
“I’m hiding from the insanity out there,” he said, gesturing at the people trying to force their way inside without success. Their shouts were muffled through the glass. “Do you happen to know what that was all about? I know people have been talking about retaliation against Death Eaters being on the rise, but that out there is ridiculous. Why they’d bother you of all people about it is completely beyond me.”
“I thought you would come and find me after your review and not hide away from the world in a ministry bathroom of all places. That doesn’t befit a Malfoy, you know?”
Shaking with terror, Draco crawls to the edge of the water and the moment he touches it, the entire pond lights up and Ligeia lunges for him, pulling him into the water with her, at the same time that a tentacle like arm closes over empty air, where Draco’s ankle had been only a moment ago.
“If Sir would only explain.”
“What…?”
No one is more surprised than Harry, when he doesn’t splice himself and ends up in his living room without much ado. He sinks into his favourite armchair and falls promptly asleep in his clothes and shoes.
“Excuse me, Gorgeous, did you lose something?” a familiar voice asked pleasantly.
Just as he was about to speak, the She-Weasel rushed down the broad flight of stairs closely followed by the rest of the Golden Trio and shook Potter’s shoulder.
“I’m sure I don’t know what you mean.”
He needed to get to Ron. They might be off duty but this was not something they could just let happen, no matter who it was. According to what he had overheard, the man had already been drugged and it was only a matter of time before the men would abduct their victim.
“I can’t believe you just said that.”
“Father, are you coming? I don’t want to miss the train.”
“You are trespassing, please return to the areas designated for public use,” Draco says, his voice void of emotion.
“No, he’s not here, Mr Potter, you must leave now.”
Potter’s gaze was intense and Draco barely kept himself from shuddering and trying to shrink to appear even smaller under such scrutiny. He nodded again.
“You’re shaking,” Harry whispered. “It’s alright, we’ll get through this. I’ve still got some of the powder I brought along that helped me get rid of the conch shell.”
An expression of such intense hatred crossed Weasley’s features for a second that Draco was convinced the man would kill him then and there, consequences be damned. Weasley gave Draco’s hands another hard squeeze, making sure the artificially sharpened edges of the toothbrush’s handle bit into the tender skin of Draco’s palm before speaking again.
Cogs, springs and wheels click and whiz and whirr in the dark. Hands chase each other around in a never-ending, never-varying succession of infinite labs, passing a dozen never-altering numerals over and over again. The ticking patient and constant in the dark, the steady sound of the unchanging unstoppable heartbeat of the manmade universe, giving it shape and forcing upon it the limitation of following a path that will only ever allow one direction.
They kissed some more, because after all, what else was there to do. But eventually they both grew tired. Draco climbed out of Harry’s lap, leaned against the wall and beckoned for Harry to lie down in the V of his open legs, his back pressed against Draco’s chest. Harry complied and moved Draco’s arms around his waist, covering them with his own. It wasn’t long before they fell asleep like that.
“Alright Ginny, let’s talk, but not here and not now.” Harry said. “Come on, let’s go and have some coffee in the waiting area. I could do with one and I really don’t want to wake him.”
“Oy, Harry, stop wanking and unlock the bloody door. My lunch break is over and I need to get back to work!”
Malfoy looked torn for a moment, until he eventually nodded.
Someone nearby cleared their throat and Draco realised we was staring, staring at Potter, who still had his hands on Draco’s lapels but was withdrawing them quickly at the noise. Potter was grinning at him, as if he knew what Draco had been thinking about.
- Fin-
Why did Potter have to be here now, why not during lunch hour, when Draco could have hidden in the vast dusty recesses of the library? As if called by his thoughts, Draco could hear steps coming up behind him. He stopped abruptly and turned around. Potter almost bumped into him, startled by Draco’s sudden lack of motion most likely. If Draco hadn’t taken a step back the same time Potter realized Draco had stopped, he probably would have walked straight into him.
I miss you, God how I miss you
“If I could just…” Draco interrupted. All eyes turned to him. “Dobby, it’s true that I don’t like you.” Dobby tried to interrupt turning to Harry as if to say “I told you so”. “No, let me finish. It’s not because you’re a house elf, or because you’ve truly known Harry for longer than I have. It’s because you always try to embarrass me in front of him, as if you’re trying to wake him from a dream. You always made me feel like I could never be good enough for him and let me tell you, I’m very aware of that on my own. I don’t need your help for that.”
“That means yes, doesn’t it?” Malfoy said and motioned to the bartender to bring them new drinks. Harry felt like he should remember something, but somehow having drinks with Malfoy seemed to have taken precedence and he didn’t even know how that happened.
Harry signed off and smiled at his letter. His eyes traveled to the photo frame sitting on his desk, it  was a house warming gift from Hermione and Ron, it was a picture that they had taken the summer after the war when they had finally taken some down time to just relax. His smile widened and he got up to finish sealing his letter, cast some final protection charms on the envelope and headed to bed for some much needed relaxation in his new and comfy bed.
“Um, well I don't know,” Rosetta stammered. Harry ignored them and walked towards the patient, he already knew who it was.
Harry smiled wider at the two of them, he’d always wanted someone like that to bicker and banter with, his eyes drifted to the pale hand still in his grasp,
Hermione’s eyebrows came together in a concerned expression, “have you been sleeping? Are the nightmares back?”
“Would you mind if I spoke to Draco, it’d only take a minute.” Potter said, sounding hopeful. The guard nodded, smiling at Potter and stepped a few paces away, shooting threatening glances at Draco.
“Mate what do you expect us to do, they don’t allow visitors in there unless you’re really far up in the Aurors.” Ron said, looking disappointedly at his bowl of mac and cheese.
disposition, they had sent him to work in Azkaban, preparing food. Kreacher came back on the weekends to make sure Mr Potter wasn't tarnishing his Mistress’ house anymore than he was by simply being there. It was then that Harry had asked Kreacher, very sweetly, if he would pass the letter to Draco Malfoy. Kreacher’s ears had pricked up at that, a Black descendant, in Azkaban, of course Kreacher would pass on the letter, muttering to himself about the nobility of the Black Family.
Kreacher shrugged, he wasn't a part of that department. Harry set down his toasted cheese and went into the living room, leaning down to floo Hermione. Hermione had Fridays off from the ministry internship programme.
Harry smiled up at them, “Thanks guys, but…” he trailed off looking at Draco.
“And this here is the Infirmary where prisoners or guards are treated if they are injured for any reason, this is also where prisoners have their first check ups when they arrive.”
Harry was seated in the chair next to the bed holding Draco’s hand when the blonde’s eyes opened and seemed to dart around the room before they landed on Harry. A smile spread across Harry’s face as the blonde's eyes slid shut once more and fell back asleep. This occurred twice over the next 3 hours each time Draco would only still once he found Harry.
Hermione’s eyes were wide and Ron looked concerned, “Someone’s been abusing Malfoy in Azkaban.”
A cold chuckle was heard from the passage outside his cell and then the sound of footsteps walking away. Draco sighed and slumped down against the wall, hanging his head.
“Don’t worry, we can talk about it later, rest now.” He told him as Draco settled back down into the bed.
Harry shook his head, and carefully extracted his hand out of the sleeping man's grasp. He then took the bag from Hermione and gave them both a hug before setting off to find the showers.
“Hermione mentioned you were starting this stuff, I think you’re bloody mental to do it all yourself, there are wizards who do this sort of thing.”
“Now, because I know that this young man does not have any available family, you three are now his stand-in family, understand? And well, we have to have an auror because of the severity of this case.” Myrle said and all nodded.
“And I brought some food for you, it’s not much but I have a feeling you haven't eaten since yesterday lunchtime.” Ron piped up, setting the food down on the side table.
“I’ll be fine, you know he won't attack me, and if anything goes wrong, I will tell you immediately.” Harry said to the couple as he turned back to face the door.
It was silent for a beat.
Ron turned back to Harry, “Moine and I’ll stay here and let you know if anything goes wrong, I wouldn't be surprised if the ponce decides to sleep for a good 10 hours.” he said with a smirk.
He’d hand the letter to Kreacher just before he leaves in the morning, he thought as he snuggled down under his duvet.
Harry lay on the floor of his study, or well he had claimed it as his study, he had yet to make any changes to the place. But it had a desk, a comfy chair and a bookshelf, all the makings of  a good study, or so he hoped. A painting hung on the far wall, of a gruesome battle he had no idea when had taken place. Because it was a magical painting, the poor victims were slain over and over by a dark hooded man on a black horse. He really should get rid of that painting, he thought to himself as he winced, watching the people under horsefoot getting trodden on.
Harry looked at Draco once more, he looked so peaceful in his sleep. His face had regained some of its colour and his hair was no longer bloody. Harry reached for his hand and held on to him. He then moved forward and put his head on the bed. And before he knew it, he was once again asleep, holding his ex-arch nemesis' hand.
Hermione's eyes lit up, “oh harry! Redoing Grimmauld Place would be amazing! I'll send along some catalogs and DIY books! Oh this is exciting!”
He thought, trying his best to keep a smile on his face.
“Well, we have to get going, are you ready?” Harry asked, taking a hold of Draco’s left hand and delighting in the feeling of a ring on his finger. They had been hesitant to get married. Neither one saw much point in it since they had already gone through so much together but then Draco picked up one of Hermione’s old wedding magazines and all he could hear was wedding bells. They'd gotten engaged a short while after but had yet to plan the wedding.
“What do you want me to do?” Harry whispered back, “You’re the smart one!”
“No Hermione, I’m okay, just resting.” He responded.
“I just don’t understand why I shouldn’t wear my dress robes, it is important that I make a good impression.” Draco said, walking out of their ensuite in his ‘fancy’ black jeans and a suit jacket while running his fingers through his hair. It had been years since he had even attempted to slick his hair back. Nowadays he just let it fall how it wanted to, all he did was style it slightly in the mornings.
Kingsley took one look at Malfoy in the bed then turned to another Auror, “Cornus, summon St Mungo’s, we need one medi-witch to help us take our patient through.” Cornus nodded and made his way outside. “Harry, you’ll go with them.” Kingsley said looking at the two’s joined hands, he then nodded at Harry then took Olive’s arm and guided them over to Hermione, engaging the two in an intense discussion.
Ron laughed, “Oh I can hear the headline now,
“He’ll be coming home with me.” Harry supplied and Myrle nodded, hiding a smile.
“Draco Malfoy was a scared child who was born on the wrong side of the war, he was heavily influenced by his father and he had Voldemort-” a series of gasps rang through the crowd, Potter continued louder, “Voldermort living in his home for years and Draco was forced to do a series of things in order to keep his family safe, and for that can you really blame him? We have all lost someone in the war, some more than others, but what good is it taking away this young man's future by forcing him into a cell at Azkaban for the rest of eternity?
And that is how the letter found its way underneath Draco Malfoy’s slop, with a waterproofing charm on it.
‘Alright,’ thought Harry, ‘you win this round.’ And into the kitchen he went, where he had placed all the shrunken furniture from the living room on the kitchen table. He set down the book he had brought from the living room and his plans for how he wanted said room to look. Contrary to popular belief, Hermione wasn't the only one who planned. He opened one of the furniture catalogues and started paging through, bookmarking items he liked.
Draco’s entire body bristled with fear as he heard footsteps approaching his cell door. certain guards had not been happy about his short sentence and had taken it into their own hands to deliver some type of justice. A whispered spell was heard before Draco was knocked back off his small cot and into the wall on the other side of the small room.
Harry looked back down at Draco who was still shaking.
“Harry?” Hermione’s voice cut through his thoughts, “are you sure you’re okay?”
“We managed to stabilise him, we cleaned up all of his cuts and healed 2 broken ribs and a shattered femur, we did find quite a substantial amount of curse damage and he might have trouble casting any spells for a while, but it will come back and heal overtime. He is under a stasis charm just to help his body heal. I will be providing a detailed report to the Aurors with a list of charms that we can sense has been used on him.” Myrle finished, looking towards Cornus.
It read:
Harry turned his head away from the painting and looked up at the ceiling, his mind drifting to a certain blonde-haired git. He had gone to visit Narcissa in the week, using his ‘celebrity status’ as Ron called it to get into places he normally shouldn't. She had looked well, as regal as ever, even though she was on house-arrest for the next 3 years. She had told him about Draco as a child, it seemed like an easy topic for the woman to talk about. Narcissa spoke about him in such a loving, delicate way, it was clear to anyone that she loved her son.
“Sir, I am going to have to ask you to please take a seat next to the screaming woman, I have already contacted my colleagues.” Olive said, calmly as they walked over to Harry, “Hermione, cast a muffliato please.”
“Before I fully explain you have to promise not to be mad with me.” Harry said, sheepishly. He knew full well that an angry Hermione would bypass his anger.
2 hours after they arrived at St Mungo’s, the medi-witch came out of the ward and made a bee-line for Harry. Hermione had joined him about an hour after he had arrived at the hospital and Ron had shown up about 15 minutes later, bringing along some hot coffee and baked goods from Mrs Weasley. As the witch approached, Cornus joined the trio to hear the news.
“I’m just checking in, Molly wants to invite you to supper by the Burrow on Friday evening.” she said.
The cell was hardly a room, it was barely 2 and a half meters across and 3 metres wide.  As you entered the door, the ‘bed’, although it was more of an army cot, was on your right and on the left in the far corner was a simple toilet and handbasin. There was a tiny window opposite the door that had some sort of charm on it that prevented any rain from coming in. But didn't keep the cold out.
He drifted off to sleep wondering what the wizarding equivalent of ‘suing’ someone was, promising himself to ask Hermione about it.
“Harry?” Draco croaked out.
Harry felt a smile creep onto his face, “thank you Hermione, I’ll pop in at Flourish and Botts too.” but Hermione had not heard him, she was already muttering to herself and a quill which was taking quick notes next to her, then her head disappeared from the fireplace altogether and the call ended.Harry smiled to himself, he knew how Hermione could get, he better send a note to Ron, apologizing for getting his girlfriend stuck on another task.
“He can't stay here, he needs to go to St Mungo’s now.” Hermione whispered to Harry, paying no mind to the secretary who stammered out a protest but fell silent when Harry looked at her.
“Hey Malfoy, I’m sorry I couldn't get them to reduce your sentence more, but 18 months is better than 15 years…” Potter trailed off and Draco couldn’t help but just stare at him. Eventually Draco nodded, offering up a weak smile.
Draco sighed and rolled his head, feeling barely any twinges of pain. He sat on his cot and lifted a forkful of today’s mystery slop to his mouth, swallowing it down quickly. On his third forkful, he noticed something gleaming at the bottom of his dish, putting his fork down and expertly balancing his dish on his hands he pulled out another envelope titled ‘Malfoy’ in a messy script. His heart warmed and a sensation settled in his stomach, but Draco was quick to blame that on the food.
Harry looked away from the fireplace, “they don't keep me up that much…” just then a thought came to him, “does the wizarding world have like a furniture store? Or like a DIY store?”
“It makes sense, I was the one to get him out of there and my house is secure.” Harry said tersely.
It had been less than 5 minutes since they’d been shoved out the room when Kingsley came strolling down the passage. “Hello Harry, Ron, Hermione,” he greeted them all, “Just came to see our patient and deliver an update. How is he?”
Potter has a friend in here? In Azkaban, a guard? Could it be the guard that seems to have an affinity for harming Draco? No, surely not…
Harry stood up and walked towards the painting on the wall and took it down. Progress, he thought. Turning around slowly, Harry headed over to his desk and took a seat whilst pushing his hair out of his eyes, his mind wandering to how Malfoy was. He picked up his quill and began writing a quick note to Ron and sent it off with a barn owl named Rocky which was a gift from Hagrid, who had sobbed upon hearing the news about Hedwig, before starting yet another letter to his supposed ex-arch nemesis.
Harry smiled, feeling all sorts of awkward, “Um, Rosetta is a beautiful name, it clearly suits you.” Harry said, reading her name tag.
Harry’s heart dropped, “My letter? The one for Malfoy?”
“You have a patient in here and no one monitering their vitals? Have they even seen a doctor?” Hermione questioned, her autoriatina voice taking over.
A warm feeling bloomed in Harry’s chest, “I’m here Draco.”
“He can stay with me.”
He heard the elf gasp at the sight of it and knew there must have been a large gash. He then heard the elf whisper something and a hot then very cold sensation ran down his neck to his spine and he knew it was healed.
It was nearing the 6th hour since Mediwitch Myrle had placed Draco in a peaceful sleep when the blonde started to awaken. Ron and Hermione had left about 2 hours prior, since they insisted on sticking around an hour longer to make sure everything was okay. But finally, both of them dead on their feet, they headed home.
Instead it swung open and Ron collided with him.
“Right! That's it, I really ought to be getting him away now Mr Potter.” the guard, Barnaby says. Potter nods, letting go of Draco’s hand and thanking the guard. Potter flashed one last smile at Draco before he was pulled away towards the fireplaces.
Myrle looked at him and sighed, “He’s still under a stasis charm, his bones have grown back already and most of his injuries are healed.”
“Hermione, who is the head of Azkaban?” Harry asked as calmly as he could.
“My lips are sealed” Harry smiled as Hermione got up and elbowed him in the ribs once their tour guide had turned her back.
is Hermione Granger, it wouldn't hurt to show you the guards room and the Infirmary, but you cannot tell anyone I did this.”
“Harry! You can't do that! Have you been caught, is this why you called asking about Levert?” Hermione sounded indignant.
“Kreacher had said to Master Harry that young Master Malfoy descendant of the most noble house of Black was attacked by one of the guards, Bipsey had told Kreacher that Bipsey had to cast episkey on a blonde prisoner last week and that Bipsey had seen him in the infirmary ward and Colkey in the Infirmary had said that he was very badly injured.” Kreacher recounted.
“Well, he’s doing a lot better, but I’ve put him to sleep so that his core will heal faster, he’ll be under for the next 5 hours at least, I suggest you use that time to let a variety of people know and ready your home for his transit.” Myrle said with a nod to Harry. She then picked up Draco’s file and left the room with a nod to the others.
“Oi mate!” a voice jolted Harry out of his deep interior design thoughts. Ron was leaning against the door of his kitchen, “I’ve been standing here for a while, where’ve you been?” he said in a joking manner.
Harry, not knowing what to do, looked back at Hermione who , who raised her eyebrows at him and looked towards the door leading into the prison, “Could I ask you a small favour,” Harry asked, turning back to the girl, “could my partner and I have a small tour? See we really want to be a part of the DMLE and this could really help us once we start solving cases..”
Rosetta’s eyes widened and she looked out towards her boss’ office, “I’m not really supposed to allow non-staff into that area but…” she trailed off and Harry did his best to smile warmly at her, it must have worked because she blushed again, “I guess since you
