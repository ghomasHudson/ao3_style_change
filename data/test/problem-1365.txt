Harry looked suitably uncomfortable, so Draco went on. "This way, she has no proof we're sleeping together at the moment, but if she tries to confront you, she'll have to come find us and deal with me too."
Biello is an old pureblood lineage. They are Italian, and they are fiercely proud of the purity of their blood, even more so than most British pureblood families. There are many old Italian wizarding families, but the Biellos deem nearly all to be contaminated to some degree and are thus extremely intermarried. Centuries of this practice have culminated in a family that is almost entirely insane - few escape their biological curse, and those that do are usually illegitimate children. Miss Biello must have kidnapped my son in one of her fits of insanity. Rest assured, they shall never step foot in Britain again.
He wondered what the brunet had planned for tomorrow. Draco was almost apprehensive; he didn't know what Harry's idea of an incredible date was, but he was almost sure it would not match up with his standards. He was so endearingly clueless and hopeless at all things romantic. His relationship with the female Weasley had unequivocally ended, at least partly because of the idiot's inability to identify the needs and desires of his partner. Sexuality aside, they never would have lasted longer than a year. Draco would give Harry a chance to prove himself, though, because he really, really liked Harry. Maybe the prat would exceed all expectations as he tended to do, quite infuriatingly so.
Pansy looked up at Potter, sighed heavily, and shoved a forkful of spaghetti into Draco's mouth, effectively shutting him up. Blaise sighed in relief.
"You are not stalking him again this year, Harry! Leave Malfoy alone. You have more important things to think about." Ginny Weasley's voice scolded him as she slid into the seat next to Harry. He gave her a warm smile.
When they finally reached the common room, Ron and Hermione hung back, letting them advance to their dorm alone. They made eye contact once more, sharing a strange tension before Harry opened the door, stopping short just inside.
He held out hope, though, and left the Great Hall at exactly quarter to ten. As the minutes passed by, he grew more anxious until just before the clock chimed the hour, he was tapping his foot, arms crossed.
Draco gazed at him, making some assessment of his features. He must have seen something there because he nodded, reaching for Harry's hand. Heart filling with warmth, he took it, squeezing it gently and leading the other boy towards the doors.
"I had to reshape them," Harry rambled on. "Yours was a shard and had lots of sharp edges, so I made it safer. Mine was much bigger, so I cut it to look like yours. Do you mind?" He asked abruptly, eyes manifesting his sudden concern. "I don't want to overstep; I just wanted to make sure we had a backup plan in case-"
"You know," Harry started bemusedly, "I expected people to be at least a bit surprised that Draco and I are dating."
"I know, sweetie. But you can't keep doing this. If you can't even sleep at night because of him, then it's a problem. You need to get him off your mind. Why don't you try dating someone else? Maybe you'll find that you like them better?"
Wait—the owls. Hogwarts was Unplottable, and so were countless magical structures, and the owls always managed to find them. If he sent a letter to Draco, the owl would undoubtedly reach him since the place wasn't under the Fidelius Charm. He scrambled up and rushed out of the room but then stopped. What if Draco couldn't respond? He racked his brains for a moment before coming up with another genius plan - what if he followed the owl?
"Do you think I have a chance with him?" He asked, sounding vulnerable. Pansy hesitated, knowing her answer could do a lot of damage if she wasn't careful. Either he would feel unworthy, or he would get his hopes up, only to have them possible crushed. Pansy had to be careful to make sure neither happened.
"Draco, darling. Stop staring at Potter so much. The usual amount of staring is okay, but now you're making him nervous."
Draco turned and eyed him scornfully. "Like you are any better. You would be on your knees begging in a heartbeat if that's what it took to date Longbottom, Merlin knows why." Blaise grinned unrepentantly. "I would be on my knees for him for other reasons too." He said under his breath. Pansy and Draco both ignored him.
Harry smiled uncomfortably. "Yeah. Thanks, I guess. I'll try to get over it quickly. You shouldn't have to suffer for my problems. I just...need some space for a bit. Just give me some time." Draco looked slightly disappointed but agreed. Just as Harry was about to leave, Draco said in a small voice, "Harry? We'll be okay, right?"
"Why, my theory that you could have been spending your years at Hogwarts quite a bit more productively! These youngsters have you beat!" Hermione exclamed, clearly having the time of her life.
Harry was having a great time. He and Ginny, whom he hadn't seen for ages, had hugged and then started talking about anything and everything. He missed her. She was one of his closest friends. He knew he could tell Gin anything, and she wouldn't judge him for it.
Sooner than Draco would have liked, they drew near the castle. The train stopped at the station, and Draco, Pansy, and Blaise got up to leave. As Draco stepped off, he heard a familiar voice.
"Teachers can't take points from us, Harry," was Hermione's immediate reply. "Since we no longer belong to a house, there's no way to take points from us."
"And now you wonder if you might possibly be attracted to males." It was more of a statement than a question, but Harry nodded anyways. Ginny sighed. "I don't know, Harry. One dream doesn't prove anything. You might be, or you might not be. There are other ways to know, but I don't think you can tell just from one dream."
What could he be doing at - Draco blearily cast a Tempus - eight in the morning? They didn't have to meet for another two hours. That was plenty of time to change and eat breakfast. Speaking of such matters, Draco needed to get out of bed. His outfit wouldn't pick itself.
Malfoy was sitting up in the bed next to his, watching him. A tray with various foods was sitting in his lap, and a fork with pasta on it was hovering midair. Harry blinked at him.
Harry got up quickly to disguise his surprise at Malfoy playing along. He had expected him to snap or tell him to quit goofing off. He found that he quite liked how laid back this new Malfoy was.
Pansy followed through on her offer, handling her roommates with surprising skill. They spent the rest of the evening gossiping about nearly everyone (except Potter, he was a forbidden topic), and looking through various magazines, pointing out different articles and clothes for the others to look at. They stayed together quite late until Bulstrode poked her head in and said that she wouldn't be able to keep Granger away for much longer. Draco reluctantly left his friends, heading down the hall to his own dorm.
"I didn't know if I would see you again," Harry mumbled into his neck. Draco kissed the side of his head soothingly.
They shared a look that was filled with more meaning than words could ever convey. Draco knew what Harry meant.
Malfoy snickered. "Come here, Potter. This is far too much for one person to eat, and your stomach might eat itself if you have to wait any longer." Harry shook his head, but after more insisting on Malfoy's part and another embarrassingly loud rumble from his stomach, he gave in. He pulled a chair up to Malfoy's bed and sat next to him, stealing the untouched beef stew. He was right, the pasta, stew, and fried chicken all together was far too much for any one person to eat.
It was only after both boys had settled down in their beds that Harry realized Draco had never told him why he was wandering the castle in the middle of the night.
He glanced at the title: Crown Prince Still Missing: Nationwide Search Goes On. Draco scoffed. The matters of muggles were nothing to him. He faintly recalled, however, that there was no crown prince; the royal family only had daughters. Maybe he was remembering it wrong. In any case, it didn't matter to him.
Malfoy gave him a questioning look but thankfully didn't seem too angry. "What do you mean, Potter? They said quite a few truthful things."
Draco walked up to Harry, who was staring blankly into the distance. "Hey," he said, eliciting no reaction. He frowned. "What did she say to you?" He demanded.
Realizing that he was getting nowhere with questioning the woman, Wilson gave up and ordered four of the Aurors to take her to the Ministry to deal with later. Eventually, Harry got up and joined the others in searching for clues. He went to the room that he had broken into first, hoping Draco might have left something behind.
McGonagall sighed. "Mr. Potter," she began, "while logical, your idea is a bit far fetched. Self-studying to become an animagus is uniquely challenging, and while I have no doubt Mr. Malfoy is capable of it, that's an unlikely series of events. If you are correct," she surveyed him over he glasses, "then he will most likely return to Hogwarts at his earliest convenience, and we must wait for that to happen. It's more likely that Miss Biello sent him somewhere and refused to tell us where."
Hermione turned back to Harry. "He might not want you to defend him, because it'll hurt his pride, and you know how Malfoy is when his pride is insulted. You have to be careful, Harry. You have to convince him it's not for his sake. But don't be mean. Or insensitive. And I don't want to be rude, Harry, but you can be quite thick sometimes, so do try and understand what he's going through." She said, and as always, Harry was grateful for her advice. This time though, he was also a bit insulted. "I'm not thick," he protested weakly. But even he knew he could be a bit oblivious at times, so he dropped it.
Their Charms class went by exceedingly slowly. Flitwick was trying to teach them Charm theory, which was highly complex and challenging to master. Draco understood why it might help improve their casting - knowing why something worked always helped him do it better - but a small part of him also thought that waving their wands wildly around without having a clue as to what that did had never yet failed them.
Harry walked into the common room. Thankfully, Draco wasn't there. He nodded to Ron and Hermione and continued to his dorm.  He pushed open the door, only to see Malfoy pulling his robes over his head. He was wearing pants underneath, but they honestly didn't cover much except what was absolutely necessary. And of course, his torso was bare.
On the other side of Malfoy, Zabini scooted closer to him. Malfoy moved to give him more space, causing his arm to press against Harry's. Little shocks of electricity went up and down his arm, and he jumped. "Sorry," muttered Malfoy. Seriously, what was with all the Slytherins recently?
All six of them made their way down to the feast together, however awkward. Granger wasn't all that bad to talk to. She was still a bit annoying, but at least she could hold an intellectual conversation. Granger and Pansy seemed to get along quite well, too. The Weasel and Blaise even had an awkward, short exchange.
He stopped when he was half a meter away from Harry, unwilling to cross the other boy's boundaries of personal space. Hesitantly, he reached out to touch his face, making sure that Harry had plenty of time to voice discomfort. He sensed this was a situation that needed to be handled delicately.
Draco muttered the new password (simul fortes) and slipped into the common room. Thankfully, he made it to his dorm and into bed without incident.
"You could have told us! We were worried!" Pansy pouted, put out. Draco gave her an appeasing look. "I know, Pans. But I didn't know I was going to stay until I was up here, and there was no way to contact either of you." Draco reasoned. Pansy nodded reluctantly. "I'll let it go this time, but I expect that next time you will tell one of us. Alright, darling?" Draco nodded, rolling his eyes. "Yes, mother."
" Goodbye, mother," Draco whispered in his mother's ear. His throat was closing up, so he refrained from saying more. "Goodbye, my love," his mother said, smiling softly. "Please be happy this year, Draco. Be free. Do not worry about anything this time. This is your year to do simply as you wish. Please find your happiness, my dear, so I may be at peace."
Harry desperately wanted to wrap Draco in his arms, but he couldn't move. He gave Draco a weak smile instead. "Yeah, Draco. We'll be fine."
Harry proved to be very inattentive when Draco was concerned. He only just managed to catch the Snitch a few times, but not enough to be ahead of Draco. He couldn't help but watch as Draco flew effortlessly, eyes shining brightly with delight. He pulled himself out of his stupor, and flew around, determined to get the Snitch this time. He saw it, a glimmer of gold near the forest, and turned, speeding off after it. Draco was close behind him.
Harry, the Headmistress, and the Aurors moved into position. They waited a minute to allow the others to reach the spots, and then, Wilson raised his wand and performed a complicated series of motions. At the end of it, a trilling birdcall disrupted the peaceful atmosphere.
"How shocking," Malfoy snickered at him. Harry rolled his eyes and continued. "I was thinking that I, for one, would appreciate it if this kind of thing never happened again. The fighting, I mean. So I was wondering....would you like to maybe, possibly, be friends?" He rushed the last part out. Then he sat there nervously as Malfoy just gaped at him. After a silence that was far too long for Harry's liking, he cleared his throat. "I mean, if you don't want to, it's fine. I just thought that you might want to stop all this arguing and-"
The petite yet incredibly scary woman hurried out of her office, immediately spotting Potter lying on the bed. "What happened?" She asked as if unconscious patients were brought in every day, which they probably were. Draco described how he had bumped into Potter, making sure to tell the woman he had apologized and backed off. She looked skeptical but allowed him to continue. As he finished telling her about Potter's sudden attack, she ran diagnostic spells on the boy.
"Harry," Draco murmured into the other boy's mouth. Their fifth kiss was chaste, sweet even. They were taking the time to just explore and feel, to experience but not get lost in the sensations.
Draco felt shame rise up in him. How selfish he had been, to ignore his mother's entirely reasonable request for him to write once a week. There was no excuse for his lapse in thought. With that in mind, he hurried to the library to write a response the moment he finished eating.
"Yes, I'm fine, Potter. Is that all you wanted? Because if so-" Harry interrupted him, saying, "No, Malfoy, that's not what I wanted to talk to you about." Malfoy still didn't look at him, so he barreled on.
Harry really, absolutely despised waiting. He was famously impatient, and Harry hated not knowing things, creating a volatile combination that was likely to erupt into a fierce outburst of rage at any moment.
All the 8th years looked at each other, and then there was a mad dash for the fireplace. Every student was jostling to see who they would be rooming with.
"Did you listen at all, Potter? Snape said to read the instructions before starting! Honestly, it's like giving instructions to a deaf man."
Harry didn't know what to say to that, but Draco helpfully shoved the piece of toast in his face, so he took the chance to avoid replying and bit into it.
"I'm not going to explode!" Harry erupted. The twins smirked. "Too late!" They chorused. Harry just scowled more. Then he gestured vaguely to the front of the shop, saying, "Would you please take that down? I don't much want even more people after me to offer their gratitude. And really, cheeses? If you were going to put me in a rhyme, you could have done so much better." He shook his head in mock disappointment.
The man raised an eyebrow, unimpressed. "I want nothing, Your Highness. Your father, on the other hand, wishes you to return. His Majesty believes it is high time you, ah, reconsidered your resolution to leave."
"So, you did have a crush on a guy at the beginning of the term?" Harry exclaimed. Draco leaned back in shock. Only seconds later, though, he huffed with exasperation. "Yes, of course. You."
Hmmm. Whatever it was, it was something embarrassing. That was the only thing that explained his strange behavior until then. He turned fully to face Draco, who was now avoiding his gaze.
The house elf appeared with a muffled crack. "Is the sirs needing something from Miffy?" she asked politely.
While Harry was distracted, Draco owled Pansy a certain emerald bracelet that may or may not have been the catalyst for this whole adventure. Who knows? Maybe this path was inevitable.
Hermione was practically bouncing in her seat as McGonagall came around with the timetables. When she passed Harry his, he quickly scanned it. Today was potions (cue pained groan), then Herbology, Defense, and finally Transfiguration. All the 8th years had their classes together, so they all had the same timetables unless you were a genius like Hermione and were taking a bunch of extra classes.
Nearly half an hour had passed when a noise interrupted Draco's mental recitation of old Latin poetry. He stood, all traces of the dead language gone from his mind as he prepared to face his kidnapper.
Draco almost smiled. Because, now he knew that this wasn't just a very good dream, it was his reality.
After breakfast, the trio made a quick detour to their dorms to grab their books, then walked the short distance to Snape's classroom.
He tore the flap, a bit hysterical with the number of letters that were still pouring in. The moment he touched the letter inside, he felt the room lurch sickeningly and spin in a twister of color, depositing him in a dank, pitch-black room.
Draco looked like he was having an information overload. Harry, on the other hand, was finding that telling the blond all these secrets festering inside him was quite cathartic.
A harsh figure stood in front of a large window, carving a severe silhouette from the weak light streaming in. Though his back was turned, Draco saw his father in the unnatural stiffness of his posture, the hands clasped behind his back, and the familiar white-blond hair. He knew, even before the king turned around, that this man was somehow, impossibly, Lucius Malfoy, even with the unfamiliar, yet somehow strangely fitting, crown upon his head.
Harry quickly slipped into one of the elevators frequently used by Ministry employees. Luckily, the people he came across had enough sense to refrain from accosting him and demanding an autograph. He got out at the Department of Mysteries because as luck would have it, the Malfoys were being tried in Courtroom Ten, the same place he was tried when he was attacked by dementors. As he approached, he saw two guards standing at the entry to the room. He knew the moment they recognized him. "Harry Potter," one of them murmured respectfully, inclining his head. Harry nodded back. He recited his carefully thought out excuse. "Excuse me, kind gentlemen, but would you be so kind as to let me in? I was supposed to be here as a witness ages ago, at the start of Mrs. Malfoy's trial, but I got held up." He shook his head and clucked his tongue for dramatic effect. "The crowds and reporters wouldn't let me pass, and I didn't wish to tell them my business, as you can imagine. But if you would be so kind, I need to get in so I may testify." It was true enough, even if he lied about some bits. Though he hated to do it, he hoped reminding them of his fame would help convince them.
Draco's eyes shut instinctively, bracing for impact, but he forced his body to keep going, and with a blast of cold air, he was outside. Finally, he was free. Blind with exhilaration, he didn't notice the dark-haired boy beneath him, nor the owl winging its way to the window he had just left, even with his special heat-vision. Draco simply flew as far and fast as he could on his unsteady, new wings, intent on getting back to Hogwarts, where he thought Harry was.
Harry nodded, clenching his fists and digging his nails into his palms to channel his rising anger into something else. He opened his mouth to respond, but Hermione stopped him.
"I have to go do something. I'll meet you guys in Charms class, alright?" Without waiting for an answer, Harry got up and hurried out of the Great Hall, making sure not to lose Malfoy. He followed the blonde head down a corridor and up some stairs. The Slytherin went around a corner and-
"And where the fuck do you think you're going?" A very familiar and very pissed off voice rang shrilly through the hall. Draco winced and turned around to face his best friend since childhood. She was standing there, her hands on her hips, the door to the compartment behind her half ajar.
"Good news, darling, very good news," she said, and Draco shot up. "What did you find out?" He asked eagerly.
Draco still looked sleepy, his eyelids drooping, and his posture just the wrong side of perfect. Even his hair was far from the immaculate style he now preferred - it was dangerously close to Harry's level of messiness. Harry loved this Draco because it was his Draco. It was Draco stripped bare from all the pureblooded standards and ceaseless manners. It was Draco when he didn't have to pretend or try to be some perfect version of himself. It was the Draco he rarely got to see, the one that existed only in the fleeting moments between sleep and coffee, between daydreams and attentiveness, before going to bed and after a long snogging session. No one but Harry truly understood how precious and valuable these seconds were.
"You mean other than the one you just asked?" Draco raised an eyebrow inquisitively. "Alright, but I reserve the right not to answer." Harry rolled his eyes and muttered something that sounded like "Slytherins."
Warm hands slid around his waist, and he gasped in surprise. "I look forward to it," Harry murmured from behind in his left ear, before slipping away once more. Draco growled but resigned himself to walking up to the castle with an uncomfortable hard-on. "Insufferable prat," he muttered to himself.
"Hello?" she said. "Yes, I am looking straight at a dragon right now. No, this is not a prank - I'm staring at it right now. It doesn't look like any animal I've seen before. Yes, I took a picture. Of course. Yeah, could you come as soon as possible? It doesn't look dangerous, but who knows. Yeah. Thanks." She said her goodbyes and brought the box back down.
Harry sighed, but said, "Fine. I'll take him." Blaise nodded in thanks, and said, "You'd better go quickly, last I saw he was threatening to start dancing on the tabletop." Draco cringed. He had no desire to see that.
Harry cleared his throat. "Never mind that. I, er, I have something to tell you guys." Hermione, bless her, immediately guessed that it was something private. She nodded firmly. "Pansy owes me for last time she wanted to talk to Malfoy. We can go to my room."
Draco stopped. The battle was over. He had lost. It was time to go, and he needed to get home. The other Death Eaters were ahead, and it was every man for himself. He needed to get to the Manor if only so he could spend a few hours with his parents before their inevitable capture. But that voice, that unfortunately familiar voice, was enough to make him halt.
Evidently not. And yet, Harry found himself wanting to smile at Malfoy's insult, almost like it was a joke between them.
Draco almost stumbled at the news. Was Potter worried about him? Shaking it off, he continued their argument. "And you listened to him? You know I can't be late to potions, my godfather will murder me!" Pansy shook her head. "If Snape has a soft spot for anyone, it's you." She informed him. "I bet if you told him you weren't feeling well, he would let you skip."
From far off, there was the sound of ten loud bongs. Draco waited through all of them, foot finally stilling. Then he waited five more minutes because Harry was always late. Just as he was about to leave, heart sinking in despair, a familiar mop of unruly black hair barrelled around the corner. Draco stopped, watching as the hurtling body tried to run, put on a coat, and keep hold of a small, cream-colored box all at once. To the amazement of everyone who stopped to stare at the Idiot Who Lived, he managed to get his coat on the moment he stopped in front of Draco, still carrying the box.
Perhaps seeing his face edge towards despair, the reporter backed off a bit, thanking him for his time. Harry liked him all the more for it, and bid him goodbye.
Draco pulled back and, seeing Harry's still but mutinous face, grinned triumphantly. After another moment, he shut his eyes.
Draco shifted in discomfort at the casual way Potter mentioned his death and noticed several others do the same. He was proving himself to be more and more Slytherin by the minute. He nonchalantly reminded them of the debt they all owed to Potter for saving the world. And by remarking on how he came back to life and defeated the Dark Lord, Potter subtly reminded them that he was, in fact, the most powerful wizard of their time and that it would be quite unwise to cross him. Draco was impressed, very impressed. He couldn't have conducted this better. He reminded himself to confront his mother about this later, though. He glanced at his mother again, and her face was impassive, not a hint of anything that could have disproved Potter's words showed itself.
Hermione looked alarmed. "Have you ever slept once without having a nightmare?" She asked. Harry started to shake his head, then stopped. "Actually, earlier today. I didn't have a nightmare this afternoon, when I was taking a nap with-" he stopped himself because he hadn't told Hermione about falling asleep with Draco. But Hermione was far too sharp for him. "With Draco?" She asked gently. Harry nodded reluctantly.
"Well? I don't have all bloody day!" Draco finally snapped at him. Potter seemed to come back to himself then and reached into his pocket, pulling out his wand. He handed it to him and finally spoke. "Here. I couldn't have killed him without it, so you have my thanks." Draco looked at him with confusion in his face before looking down at Potter's wand. His eyes widened. "This is my wand," he said in wonder, before slowly reaching out to take it. Potter looked sheepish. "Yeah. Sorry about that. My wand...broke. And anyway, I wouldn't have been able to defeat Voldemort with my old wand. So thank you for letting me use it. It was strangely...compliant." Draco chose to ignore that last comment and focused on what he had said before that. "I didn't 'let' you use it. You stole it, you twat. And what do you mean your wand wouldn't have worked? You always fought him with it before, and it seemed to work out well enough for you." Potter's eyes became unfocused like he was remembering something. "Yes, I did. But he was never able to kill me with his wand, so naturally, I couldn't have done the same with mine." Draco was positive he was hiding something. "But why...never mind, I don't need to know. What I do need to know, Potter, is why you have delayed me from getting back to the Manor, where I can spend my last few free hours with my family without a psychotic monster breathing down our necks." Draco drawled.
Harry nodded. "I think we should. I've already started trying to call you Draco in my head. And besides-" Harry looked slyly at his companion. "You've called me Harry a few times already." Draco looked startled at this news. "I have?" He asked bewilderedly. Harry nodded at him. "When you got drunk yesterday, you had no trouble calling me by my first name," he told the other boy smugly. Draco looked embarrassed.
Draco gave her a look and chewed the spaghetti as fast as his mannered upbringing would allow. When he finally swallowed the last bits, he started whining again. "I can't just ignore him! I can feel him looking at me-"
Malfoy stumbled and crashed face-first on the bed. Unfortunately, he grabbed Harry's arm in the process, dragging him down with him. Harry landed on top of Malfoy, arms on either side of his body.
"Distract me, more likely," Draco muttered, and Harry smirked before giving him a heated kiss that set his entire body on fire, only proving his point. Draco groaned into Harry's mouth, then found himself bereft as a laughing Harry disappeared into thin air. "Nothing wrong with a bit of snogging, Draco," came the smooth voice from somewhere to his left.
Malfoy shook his head. "I don't, Potter. It could have happened to anyone." Potter leaped up and began to pace, ignoring the twinge of pain he felt. "But it didn't! No one else was dumb enough to disregard the instructions as I did."
"So," he began, then didn't know how to continue. After a couple of seconds, Hermione looked at him softly.
Outside the room, the two Weasleys were waiting. Draco nodded to Ron, then faced Charlie and said, "Thanks, Weasley. It's relieving to know at least one of you lot is capable of performing your job." Charlie grinned.
"Go on," she said. "It's better if I send you myself instead of finding out a couple of hours later that you broke into the Ministry."
"Someone called you a nasty Death Eater?" Harry asked angrily. Draco was touched by his concern, even so early in their friendship thing. Had they even been friends at that point? Past-Draco was talking again. "It's okay. I am a nasty Death Eater. I should've gone to jail. Why didn't you let me go to Azkaban, Harry?"  Merlin. Draco was so done with alcohol. They bickered a bit about whether Draco had deserved to go to jail, with the end result of Harry winning, Draco smiling sappily at him, and Harry looking a little bit besotted.
Ron goggled at her, obviously surprised that she had agreed with him. He cleared his throat. "How long have you been standing there, 'Mione?" He asked. "Long enough," was her reply.
Harry skipped the trick step he knew was there. One learned such intricacies of the castle after sneaking around it so long. However, the trick step was not where it should have been. His foot went through the stair below the one he stepped over, and he nearly lost his balance. He would have fallen quite far if Draco hadn't been there, but he managed to catch him just in time.
Thankfully, a loud group of Ravenclaws came in, chattering excitedly. Since Pansy was busy with helping Granger, he played the part of the host, graciously welcoming the group and directing them to the food. About ten minutes later, nearly their whole year was there, along with a few of the 7th years who had been specially invited. People filled the room, lounging around on the seating area provided. Whenever the chairs and beanbags got full, more popped up out of thin air, thanks to the room's magic.
Seeing that he wasn't going to answer, Harry moved closer. "And why in the forest in the middle of the night? If you talk to McGonagall, I'm sure she would let you attempt it. Supervised, of course, but she might help you. You wouldn't have to do it alone, or stay up so late you look like death itself in the mornings." Harry pried. He would never admit it, but he hated seeing Draco so clearly unhealthy. It felt wrong - like there was something fundamentally incorrect in the universe if Draco didn't look one hundred percent perfect.
Thank goodness Malfoy was left-handed, otherwise, his arm would constantly be brushing against Harry's as he sipped his drink. Harry almost shifted away, but he didn't want to give away the fact that such a small thing was making him so uncomfortable. Zabini scooted closer to Malfoy again, and this time he snapped at him. "Move away, Blaise, or I'll end up in Potter's lap." Harry flushed.
Draco awoke quite suddenly. He had no recollection of the previous night's dream, but he knew it must have been something out of the ordinary if he had woken up that way. He lay in bed for a couple of minutes, listening to the sound of his dorm mates' breathing. As his mind grew less foggy and more aware, he realized there was less snoring than usual.
The moment Harry entered the common room, Hermione knew. She stood while offering platitudes to Ron to prevent him from joining them - Harry or Hermione would always fill him in later, but Ron was never the best at the actual calming Harry down bit. Ron was one of the best friends Harry could ask for, and he knew he would always have Ron's support, but they all knew where each of their strengths lay in their friendship, and they were comfortable with their respective roles.
"You...cannot just...burst out of...your room...looking like...that...and then just...leave!" She hissed between panting in breaths of air. Pansy leaned against the table for a moment, steadying her breathing before she glared and continued as if there were no interruptions.
Potter fell silent, evidently finished. The jury was talking quietly amongst themselves, shocked by the information they had just received. The Chief Warlock stood up. "With that," he said, clearly shaken, "let us vote. All in favor of declaring the defendant, Narcissa Malfoy née Black, guilty, raise your hands."
"Draco?" Harry said uncertainty. The other boy didn't respond. Draco's breath was coming out in short pants, and his arms constricted around Harry, pulling him impossibly close. "Draco? Draco, I'm sorry, I didn't mean to do that. Please, everything is alright. You're fine. He's gone. I killed him, remember?" Harry spoke more urgently. Draco seemed to be calming down.
After a moment of recovery, Draco reached for his wand and vanished the mess. He pulled his pajamas back on from where they clung to his thighs. It didn't take long for him to drift off into sleep.
"Well, I think this only confirms your bisexuality," Hermione said, smiling. Harry opened his mouth. "But I ran away. Knowing his...thing was right there made me feel weird." Hermione shook her head. "As you said, you simply weren't ready. You thought you were straight for most of your life, so it's no surprise this feels weird to you. Honestly, I think you were just caught off guard. Girls don't have penises, so you've never had to deal with that before. Give it time. The more you do things with guys, the less awkward it will become. It should start to feel as natural as being with a girl."
It was all Draco could do to drag his eyes away from Potter's admittedly deliciously lean, muscled body to his eyes, heated with anger. Draco smirked and leaned against the doorframe. He allowed himself one more look at Potter's body, disguised as a dismissive glance. Desire pooled in his gut, but he forced it down so it wouldn't show in his eyes.
Draco hugged his mother. They were finally free from the monster. This was a moment he would cherish for the rest of his life. But first...
Ron straightened up, still chuckling. "Mate, you've nearly died so many times that the novelty of it has worn off. Besides, it rather sounded like you were enjoying that dream." Ron was far too amused about this for his own good. In fact, if he kept it up, Harry just might strangle him.
Draco rolled his eyes and pulled Pansy away. When they were in a somewhat secluded area of the common room, she gave him a searching look and asked quietly, "Will you be alright?"
"I want to say it, even if it is hard. I love you, Harry, more than words can express," he said reverently. Harry laughed, and it was a joyous, free sound.
"You know that Sirius was innocent. Wormtail was the one who betrayed my parents and killed all those muggles, which is why Sirius tried to kill him. Unfortunately, he escaped down the sewers as a rat and somehow survived long enough to help Voldemort return. Right under our noses, even."
They loitered around in the Great Hall, waiting for McGonagall to lead them to their new quarters. After wrapping up a conversation with Flitwick, she turned towards the 8th years and clapped once to gain their attention. "Follow me, if you please." She led them out of the Hall and down one of the stairs. As they moved along, Harry had a sneaking suspicion of where they were going. Sure enough, they stopped at a corridor in the dungeons, halfway from the Slytherin common room to Snape's classroom. McGonagall said the password (unity) to a very haughty looking portrait of an old man in formal robes, and they filed in.
Harry looked away. "I mean...er, yeah, I am. And I guess I always was bisexual, but I only realized it just after you-" Harry stopped suddenly. He wondered why he had been given the gift of speech if it was just going to go and ruin his life like that. "After I what?" Draco asked shrewdly.
"It was never haunted," he informed the blond, much to his surprise if the small noise he made was any indication. Harry finally turned to face him. "It was Lupin the entire time. He would come here to transform during the full moons." Harry smiled softly. "My dad and godfather would keep him company and restrain him when needed. They came through a tunnel underneath the Whomping Willow; Wormtail was always the one to deactivate the tree. They spent hours with Lupin every month..." he trailed off into silence.
When he opened the door again, he was relieved to see that Malfoy's curtains were shut. He walked over to his own bed and clambered in, closing the curtains and rolling over, punching his pillow into a more comfortable shape. Sleep followed quickly, thank Merlin.
Draco studied him for a moment. "And one might say you're being quite Slytherin right now. Manipulating me, so I'll do what you want. You should know," Draco leaned in closer to murmur in Harry's ear, "you can't manipulate the master manipulator. That's why I'm the prince of Slytherin, and you're Gryffindor's Golden Boy, Harry." Draco didn't miss the way the boy's breath hitched as he whispered.
"Jack!" the woman cried. "He's a cold-hearted man, and you know he gives me the creeps! He'll probably dissect it or do something equally horrific. Oh, Paul, please don't take it to Jack."
Then, Malfoy's tongue was gliding across his lips, and Harry gasped, allowing Malfoy to claim his mouth. Fire engulfed his every nerve, and the kiss became a million times more intense. "Harry," Malfoy whispered into his mouth, and Harry shuddered in response. Malfoy's hand was trailing down his chest, the other reaching up to tangle itself in Harry's hair. He tugged it gently, and Harry moaned into the kiss. "Harry," Malfoy whispered again. "Harry. Harry. Har-"
Draco reluctantly turned to face forwards, adding this to the mental list he had made consisting of things to confront Potter about. He listened, bored, as Snape repeated some of the information from last week's class. When it was time to get to work, Draco retrieved their potion from where they had stored it for safekeeping.
Robards stood and held his hand out, and Harry took it, not wanting to be rude. The other man was introduced as Auror Wilson, and then they launched right into an explanation.
"Malfoy?" He called. There was no answer. "Malfoy?" He tried again. He twisted around one more time, but now he could see a figure walking towards him. It grew closer and closer until Harry saw the platinum blonde hair and familiar gray gaze. "Harry," said Malfoy in a smooth, silky voice. Why was Malfoy calling him by his first name? That wasn't normal. "Malfoy? What's wrong?" He asked. Malfoy sighed.
The other person stumbled back and said in a nasty tone, "Watch where you're- oh, it's you, Potter. I should have known. No one else is idiotic enough to walk around without looking where they're going." Malfoy said, rolling his eyes, but it was more of a joke than an insult. Normally, Harry might have smiled or even laughed, but all he felt was a strong wave of rage. Malfoy's face dropped at the expression of anger on Harry's face.
Seamus laughed. "Harry, mate, everyone suspected ages ago. Especially since you very publicly went out with Malfoy yesterday."
Harry grabbed his cloak and map, muttering the words he knew would activate the clever spell his father and his friends had wrought on the parchment. As the lines of ink smoothly appeared, he hurried through the hall and empty common room, slipping out with a familiarity born of routine.
Hermione let out a very girly noise. "Oh, that's perfect! About time! Have you asked him on a date yet?" She gushed.
Draco stood still, at a loss for what to do next. He couldn't call the muggle police - they wouldn't find any evidence if it were a wizard, not to mention the fact that he wouldn't be able to explain everything about his missing object. Nor could he call the Aurors, because that was just asking for trouble. It was no use trying to find the thief himself either - Draco had limited access to magic and knew very little about tracking spells anyway. He scowled. He loved that potion kit. It was one of the few things he still enjoyed doing. There was nothing for it, he would have to get a new one.
"Show me what you do in your free time," Harry suggested. "Surely you can't spend all your time lazing about staring at the ceiling, refusing to talk about me with your mother."
"Go," Wilson whispered, and they rushed to the door. Disregarding magic, two of the Aurors barged their shoulders against the door in an incredibly synchronized move, bypassing any possible locking charms. The six of them swarmed inside, wands aloft. They heard the sound of a back door being broken into and the subsequent footsteps of the other Auror duo.
"My love?" His mother's voice interrupted his father's tirade, and Draco turned around. "I heard-" she stopped when she saw her son.
Draco shook his head. "I very clearly remember you asking for space. But who am I to complain? Though we should get up soon, it's nearly time for the feast." Draco said, a bit unwillingly. Harry nodded. "You're right, we should probably move before Nott or Goldstein comes in and sees us." Draco disentangled his arms from around Harry, and they moved apart, getting off the bed. Harry headed for his trunk to find some clothes, while Draco went to the bathroom to freshen up.
"Would you...never mind." Harry sounded subdued. Draco looked up to see him chewing on his lip and looking frustrated.
"I mean earlier," Draco elaborated. "You manage to get information out of me with just a look." He sounded put out by that fact.
The fifth and final thing he noticed was Draco Malfoy. He was sleeping very peacefully, his face for once devoid of all emotion. Harry took the time to appreciate the ethereal features of the pale, blonde boy. He was painfully beautiful, all angles and aristocratic bone structure. His eyelashes were incredibly long, and his hair fell over one side of his face, covering his ear. Harry spent far too long just ogling Draco. He was, in a word, perfect.
"You're welcome," he muttered under his breath and checked the time. Realizing he would be late if he didn't head to class, he took off in the same direction as Malfoy. Nevertheless, he arrived a minute late, sliding into his seat next to Hermione, panting and out of breath. Flitwick gave him a baleful look but continued his lecture, and Hermione gave him a concerned glance. He could tell she wanted to know where he had been, but he looked forwards and feigned interest in the lecture. It was something about the theories of charming something for perpetual motion, and it didn't sound very interesting to Harry. He turned his thoughts back to the fight.
"Ron, I would watch out if I were you. Draco's Slytherin's prince, after all. He didn't earn that position for nothing." Harry warned his mate without taking his eyes off of Draco, whose face had twisted into that of mock outrage that couldn't quite disguise his pride at his title.
Draco stared at him for a moment. "And one might say you're being quite Slytherin right now. Manipulating me, so I'll do what you want. You should know," Draco leaned in closer to murmur in Harry's ear, "you can't manipulate the master manipulator. That's why I'm the prince of Slytherin, and you're Gryffindor's Golden Boy, Harry." Harry felt his eyes grow wide, and his breath hitched at Draco's proximity, as well as the onset of memories prompted by his whispered name.
Harry raised a shaking hand to point at the scars. "I did that to you." His voice was trembling, eyes wide with horror and shame. Draco recoiled, then determinedly crossed the room to stand in front of Harry.
McGonagall was sitting behind the desk, two men in Auror robes in front of her. One was a stranger, while the other Harry recognized as Head Auror Robards, who he had worked with briefly over the summer to capture the remaining Death Eaters.
Ron finally surfaced with a pained grin. "Of course not, mate. We'll always support you." He croaked out. Hermione gave him a proud look.
"Mione," Ron finally interrupted. "Please let us eat. I promise I'll pay attention next lesson." Hermione looked a bit upset at being cut off but was placated by Ron's promise. They began to eat, listening to the conversations around them. Neville and Dean were having a discussion about some new plant that apparently ate birds, Lavender was telling Parvati and a very bored Seamus all about the latest and greatest in fashion, and Ginny was talking to some of her fellow 7th years about lessons. Ron looked a bit ill at that.
Now that I'm all caught up posting chapters, they'll be once every few weeks and posted after I put them on Wattpad.
"Because," he said gently, "I want to take this slow. You're not some little fling or passing dalliance. I want to prove to you how much this means to me. I'm not in it for the sex."
Harry nearly dropped the toenails. He hadn't expected Malfoy to actually listen. Had Malfoy really changed?
Suddenly, Draco exclaimed, "I've done it!" He opened his eyes and smiled smugly. "An exact replica," he noted with satisfaction. He leaned forward and kissed Harry once more, a short peck, before excitedly turning back to his book. He flipped to the next page and got lost in the words almost instantaneously.
Pansy gave him an incredulous look. "As if Granger could be a model with that hair! And Bulstrode, with her horrid nose and awful eyebrows. Abbott has a chance, maybe. But I refuse to get near a girl that positively exudes hufflepuffiness."
No one came busting in to save him, so he assumed everything was fine. There was no need for any other privacy charms, considering everyone else was asleep.
Nearly half an hour later, they strolled up to the Shrieking Shack together. They stood in silence for a moment before Harry spoke softly. "Remember third year?" He asked, still gazing at the decrepit building. Draco turned to narrow his eyes at him. "When you were invisible and assaulted me quite unfairly?" He returned snarkily. Harry grinned, still not moving his eyes. "You thought the place was haunted, didn't you?" The lack of a response was enough of an answer for him.
"It was around the time they saw you do all those things, Harry," Hermione informed him. "Every student witnessed you forgiving Draco and befriending him when it would have been well within your rights to hex him six ways to Sunday. You have suffered more than anyone else from these wars, and yet, you can still look past the Dark Mark to see the person underneath. Once everyone else started doing that too, they found children who had been just as terrified and who had lost just as much if not more. After that, it was significantly easier to forgive, though never forget."
Potter started. Then, interestingly enough, a blush stained his cheeks, turning them a dark red. Draco looked at him suspiciously.
"I'm not immune to you either," Harry protested. "If you wanted me to do something, do you think I could refuse?"
He rushed through his morning routine and hurried up to the Great Hall. Just outside, he spotted a shock of white-blond hair exactly where they agreed to meet. He hurried up to Draco and asked breathlessly, "Are you ready?"
"I feel strange. I'm going for a walk, see you guys in Herbology." He told Hermione and Ron. Hermione gave him a worried look.
"I just wanted to protect you, Potter!" Draco exploded. "Merlin's sake, you make it so damn difficult! I get that you're our indomitable savior, the Boy Who Lived to Help Us All, but can't you let others take care of you for a change? I don't think you're a ninny or a child for being inexperienced! Salazar, everyone with half a brain would realize you never had a moment to yourself to think, let alone gallivant about shagging everyone in sight. For once, Harry, I don't want you to have to rush about like your life is going to end the next day! The Dark Lord is gone, you did your duty, and now you can relax and enjoy life! You took care of the entire Wizarding World, can't you let me take care of you, just in this regard?"
Harry rolled his eyes. "If you don't mind, Malfoy, I would quite like my hand back." It was Malfoy's turn to blush, and he let go of Harry's wrist like it had burned him. Harry went back to his book.
"Don't you 'Pans' me! Where the fuck have you been all summer? We had to read about the result of your trial in the papers! And we didn't hear shit from you the rest of the summer, even though you were clearly fine! And now you come in here, acting like everything is perfectly alright and we didn't spend the entirety of three months worrying our asses off! What do you have to say for yourself?"
Now Draco understood what this was all about. "I'll never stop needing you, Pans. Sure I've always wanted to go out with Harry, but you've been my best friend since we were children. You're far more important. Who else will call me out on my bullshit? Who else will go shopping with me? Surely not Harry, not with his fashion sense. I do need you, Pans. Always," Draco assured her.
Draco immediately stepped closer. Now that they were in a relationship, Harry was his concern, his to take care of. It was his duty - and his pleasure - to ensure that Harry received all the affection and attention he could provide.
Malfoy was giving him an odd look and said in a strange voice, "No, Potter, that's not what I think. I simply meant that you focus far too much on the good in people. I am truly thankful for what you did for Mother, but I'm not sure I deserved the same kindness."
The Chief Warlock cleared his throat. "Mr. Potter, I am not sure if you are aware, but you are not allowed to be in this room. The trial has already started." Potter looked up at him and nodded. " I know, sir, but I have some very important information regarding the actions of Mrs. Malfoy. I apologize for not being here on time, but I was stalled." The Chief Warlock looked surprised, but said, "That may be so, Mr. Potter, but it would be remiss of me to break the rules to allow you to testify."
"It is not fascinating!" He snapped. "I am not dating anyone, neither a he nor a she!" But by not denying an attraction to males, he realized that he had given himself away. Parkinson smirked. "Thanks for the intel, Potter. See you around." And with that, she sauntered off, not giving Harry a chance to deny anything. He slumped backward, far too exhausted to think about how he could fix this. He would have to tell Hermione and Ron before they found out from someone else.
The bartender did a double-take when he saw Draco, and that did nothing to improve his mood. Why did everyone suddenly recognize him? It wasn't like he had been front-page news!
"I almost killed you. And I've ruined you forever. Please, never forgive me." He said, unable to look at the scars any longer.
Finally, the girl smiled at him. "Oh, all right, darling. Tell me everything." And Draco knew she had forgiven him.
Harry shrugged. "I don't know, and I never really thought to ask. It took them a lot of work, obviously. Several years, in fact. But they were determined, and they had a good reason, so they kept at it and eventually figured it out. They didn't tell anyone, though I suspect Dumbledore always knew." Draco didn't look satisfied with this answer, but he didn't ask any more questions, either. With the help of the map, which Draco still occasionally glanced at, they made it back to the common room without incident.
Harry's head was spinning. This couldn't be real, could it? He felt a warm hand touch his face, and suddenly everything stopped spinning. Malfoy was looking deeply into his eyes. "Harry," he said plainly. The hand moved to cup his cheek, and Harry sighed in contentment. This is what he wanted. This felt right. He closed his eyes in bliss. Suddenly, a pair of soft, warm lips caressed his own, and blazing heat shot through him. Forget what he had said a moment ago because now everything felt right with the world. Harry was floating, exhilarated. Because he was kissing Malfoy. And he loved it.
Harry turned around because he could not stand to look at Draco any longer. He still wasn't fully awake; drowsiness weighed heavily on his mind. He felt no desire to get up, especially since Draco would likely be awoken by movement. Harry wanted him to stay asleep if only so they could remain like this a while longer.
He, his father, and his mother would all be tried in a row. They couldn't be tried at the same time, for they were being accused of different crimes, but the Wizengamot had evidently decided they wanted to be done with all the Malfoys in one go. His father would go first, then his mother, and finally him. He didn't know what to make of that.
Draco began to panic. He was going to fall; he was sure of it. He flapped his wings in alarm, naturally trying to stop his downward motion. His muscles strained to keep him upright, and suddenly he was flying. His elation was short-lived, however, realizing that he had about five seconds to learn how to turn before he crashed into the wall. Draco dipped one wing and raised the other, as he imagined a bird would do, and his tail naturally moved to prevent him from wobbling as much.
Potter. Of course. Draco arched his eyebrow at the boy, who was looking at him with a resigned expression. Draco held back a sigh of frustration and strode over to the Gryffindor. The universe truly hated him.
He turned to Draco. "We're idiots for not thinking of that," he stated. Draco glared at him, a smudge of jam on his lip. "You're the idiot," he countered. "It was your plan. Actually, now that I'm not half-asleep, it was entirely your fault Peeves saw us. You had your cloak, you dimwit, and you didn't even think to-"
Draco didn't look at Harry. Instead, he focussed all his attention on the paragraph Harry had written. He had to read it a few times to comprehend it, but at least it gave him a chance to settle down.
"Really, Draco? Transformation Magick for the Transfiguration Master? You hardly qualify as a Transfiguration Master."
"Why not?" Harry asked, confused. He was indignant that Kingsley thought he would be there to gloat, but he let it go in favor of the more urgent matter. "No one is allowed to enter once the trial has begun unless it is an emergency. I'm afraid that you will not be able to enter." He hesitated, then said, "Harry, if that is all you are here for, then I must ask you to leave. But, you are always welcome to visit me, and should you ever wish to join us, the Department of Magical Law Enforcement will always have a spot for you."
"You don't have to apologize, Harry. I'm sorry, I should have known about today. I'll tell our professors you're sick, but I'm still bringing you breakfast and lunch. You need to eat, Harry. They would have wanted you to be healthy. And happy. But sometimes, happy just isn't feasible, and that's alright too. But please, you have to eat." Draco was nearly begging, and he kind of wanted to hit himself over the head for being so pathetic.
Malfoy snorted. "Sure, Potter, sure. Please, can we just pretend this never happened? I would like to eat my lunch without further disturbance." Harry had no intention of forgetting this, but he nodded so Malfoy could get back to his food. On cue, his own stomach growled.
"Harry!" Draco exclaimed happily. "How are you here?" He gracefully slid off the bed and approached Harry, kissing him chastely in welcome.
Pansy did not look very surprised. She did not even seem all that excited. "Is that all?" She asked, not impressed. "You've kissed before, you kissed again, big deal." Draco frowned. "Really? I think it was a big deal. We also spoke this morning, and he said he wanted to be in a relationship with me. Or, at least, he said he wanted there to be an 'us,'" Draco said, unsure.
"A few things, and I don't think he suspects anything either." She sat on top of one of the desks. "I told him I just wanted to know so I would have something to gossip about. He seemed to believe it." At Draco's impatient look, she got on with her story. "Anyways, I asked him if he was dating any girls, then I not so subtly hinted that I thought he might prefer boys. He only said that wasn't dating anyone. He didn't even deny an attraction to boys, which I think is very telling. If he was fully straight, I'm sure that would have been the first thing he focused on." Draco suddenly felt hopeful.
Draco only vaguely heard him somewhere in the back of his mind. He eyed the muscled torso appreciatively, and when it was covered, he made a sound of disappointment.
"Wow," a voice said from the door. Draco spun around to see Potter and the Weasel, looking around at the decorations in awe. Draco had to admit, Pansy had really gone all out. Tasteful streamers hung from the ceiling in black and silver, the lights were dimmed to a more cosy setting, and beanbags and armchairs were placed carefully around the room. Tables were set up along the left wall, covered in all kinds of snacks and drinks, including the Firewhiskey. It was definitely going to be a memorable party.
The next morning, Draco awoke in a fairly decent mood, made only better by the fact that it was Friday. While he got dressed, Nott and Goldstein also woke up and left at varying times. When he walked out of the bathroom, he saw Harry still fast asleep. He rolled his eyes and approached the bed.
That night, Harry rushed to get ready for bed so he wouldn't have to face Draco. He had a strong feeling that it would be awkward with what he had said earlier, and he had long ago learned to trust his instincts. He brushed his teeth and changed into pajamas at top speed, clambering into bed and shutting the curtains firmly.
Harry just turned to Ron and Hermione, still stunned into silence. Ron shrugged and grinned. "I wouldn't be all that surprised after this morning, mate." Hermione turned to him and looked him up and down.
Malfoy was watching him intently, grey eyes boring into his own. As Harry stared back at him, Malfoy raised a slightly shaking hand to touch Harry's cheek.
Harry bit his lip. There was a battle raging inside him. On the one hand, he felt that he owed it to Draco and Narcissa, to tell the truth about how they had saved him. On the other hand...
Harry popped up. "So, I'm not attracted to him?" He asked, hopefully. Hermione gave him a scrutinizing look. "I think that's something you'll have to figure out for yourself, Harry," she told him firmly.
"Harry," a voice whispered. It was dark. Harry turned about, trying to see where the voice was coming from, but he couldn't see a thing. "Harry," it whispered again, more insistently. The voice was familiar. Harry kept looking around in vain. "Potter," it said this time, and now Harry recognized it.
"Fine!" Harry snapped. Then, pinching the bridge of his nose between his fingers, he softened his voice so Malfoy wouldn't get bitchy. "I wanted to ask if what those idiots said was true."
Unfortunately, he had one small issue: he didn't know how to transform back into a human. Draco assumed that it would be similar to turning into an animal, just in reverse, but what if he was wrong? That would land him in a situation that would be even worse than the one he was currently in. Draco had never seen the point of reading ahead to that step; he had never anticipated that he would achieve the animagus form under circumstances in which he would not have access to his book, or even Professor McGonagall if things were serious.
Harry shook his head slightly, but Draco's hands restricted his movement. "Those are opinions," he pointed out. Draco grinned. "See? I'm useless."
Draco sat on the edge of the bed. "Harry? Are you alright?" He asked, slightly concerned now. Harry still didn't answer. Draco shook him. "Harry?"
Potter looked a bit taken aback by that comment. Then he looked at him with a calculating gaze. "You might not get sentenced to Azkaban, Malfoy. Your father might not be able to worm his way out of punishment, but you and your mother...you could probably come up with a defense good enough to keep you out of prison. Isn't that what Malfoys are good at?" Draco blinked, and then he was furious. "Of course you would think that, Oh Mighty Savior, but the rest of the world doesn't think so! They'll want to see us pay, and they won't settle for anything less than a life sentence. And I didn't expect you of all people to start defending Death Eaters when they have killed everyone you've ever loved, including your worthless parents and your good-for-nothing, reckless godfather." He sneered at him. "But I shouldn't be surprised. The Boy Who Won't Die has a hero complex, of course, and you are bloody addicted to it! Well, I don't want you to save me, and neither does my mother for that matter. And besides," he said, losing steam and dropping his eyes to the ground, his voice lowering to a whisper. "It's not as if we don't deserve it." Draco was horrified to find that his eyes were prickling, and he furiously blinked to stop them from leaking.
"Harry," he insisted, firmer this time. Harry pulled back, a confused expression on his otherwise sinfully sexy face. He looked thoroughly debauched, and Draco delighted in wondering what he would look like post-sex.
Ron grinned at him. "Good news, mate. Charlie just sent me a patronus from the Ministry, and he said Draco's with him. He's completely safe - they're just questioning him to find out what happened."
When everyone had filtered into the Great Hall, the Sorting began. The hat sang some nonsense about unity and acceptance before the first years were called up one by one to be sorted. Draco smiled widely every time one of them was placed in Slytherin, though he noticed no one from the other houses looked pleased. Once every first year had been sorted, and the students had settled down, Professor - no, Headmistress McGonagall rose and began her speech.
"Potter!" past-Draco said unnecessarily loudly, clinging to Harry, who managed to extricate himself. Past-Draco nattered on about random things. Draco was never drinking again, for fucks sake. Merlin, the things he said. Past-Draco was being singularly embarrassing, talking about someone who had told him to leave for being a Death Eater.
Suddenly, without warning, Draco thrust his hips forward into Harry's, giving him a very clear sign of just how aroused he was. Harry broke the kiss, surprised. Draco's lips were swollen, his eyes hooded with lust. It should be illegal to look that desirable, Harry thought before he pulled away. Draco looked confused.
Draco ignored him, wondering what the question would be. Harry coughed. "It's embarrassing," he admitted. "A couple of weeks...months?...ago, I overheard you say something..." he trailed off. Draco sighed with impatience. "If you want me to confirm it, you'll have to tell me what you heard."
"Potter," said Blaise, inclining his head. "If you wouldn't mind terribly, could you do me a favor?" Harry looked startled, but he nodded, and Blaise looked relieved.
Harry was watching Malfoy. When their eyes met, Malfoy raised his eyebrow, so Harry smirked at him. He wanted Malfoy to know Harry was onto him. Harry was delighted when Malfoy looked pained. Suddenly, the main courses disappeared, and the usual desserts took their places. Harry was promptly distracted by the treacle tarts.
"Thanks, Pans," he said and walked out of the room. Draco would listen to Pansy. She had good instincts when it came to matters like this.
She rolled her eyes. "Why is he on your mind right now? He's not even here! Oh wait, maybe that's why; it because you're wondering why he's not at lunch yet, and you want to know where he could be..." she trailed off, brain moving too fast for her mouth to keep up.
He stomped into a small, but chic bar near his flat. It would not do to be found far from home without his wand, especially by a wizard. He would have a drink, settle his nerves, and return to his apartment with a level head to look for his wand. Then, he would dig out some old apothecary catalogs and find himself a new brewing set.
Draco scoffed. "Not that the idea of pranking the Gryffindors isn't appealing, but I'm almost positive we're still terrifying Slytherins in the eyes of all the other houses." Just then, a gaggle of 3rd-year girls walked by, whispering. When Draco glanced over at them, they broke into a fit of giggles, then ran away, glancing back at him every so often. Draco turned back to Blaise. "So what's the plan?"
Harry turned her out. He ignored Ron's questioning and slightly indignant look. He was far too busy trying to forget where his mind had wandered to during class. As they made their way down to lunch, Hermione prattled on about the importance of studying and how the information they learned now was going to be important later on and the like. Harry and Ron had found that when Hermione was like this, it was better to just nod along and tune her out, so she didn't get upset. Hermione was still talking as they settled down to eat.
Draco leaned back and was pleased to see Harry very flushed, pupils dilated, and mouth slightly parted. Draco's eyes fell on the red lips and the hint of the hot mouth that lay beyond them.
Harry deliberated. His careful avoidance only made him more curious. He scooted closer to the other boy, intent on finding out what had been bothering him. "Please tell me, Draco. It doesn't matter what it is; I promise I won't say anything," he prodded.
And Draco moved further back into the dark forest until he felt that he was past the wards, and then with a loud crack, the Forbidden Forest was once more empty, save for the creatures that called it home.
"Fine!" Pansy snapped. She turned to glare at Potter. After a few seconds, he looked away. Pansy turned back to Draco. "See? Problem solved. Now shut up and eat."
Rubbing his hip, which he had landed on, Draco walked over to the wardrobe. He flung it open to reveal about two dozen robes. As he rifled through them, he frowned, seeing that they were all his size. The nightstand's drawers were empty, and there was absolutely nothing else of note in the room. Draco knew it was likely a vain hope, but he tried the door, confirming that it was locked.
Draco whipped his head around to glare at Blaise. "We most certainly not have been eye-fucking since we met! We've never eye-fucked! Not once! Our staring is completely limited to hatred and mutual dislike. And what on earth do you mean about 6th year?" he hissed, careful to make sure he wasn't too loud.
Draco was having a bloody fantastic morning. Sitting with Gryffindors was proving to be very enlightening, and he should have done it earlier. Everyone knows Gryffindors have the best gossip.
Plonking his bag onto an empty table - the table - he fished out a quill and some spare parchment. Dipping the tip into his Everlasting Ink, he hesitated before beginning.
Draco smirked. "I guess you'll just have to wait and see. I mean, you've already seen me shirtless, but you must not have been paying attention."
When Harry asked him to read over the paragraph he had just written, Draco casually rested his arm on the back of Harry's chair and scooted closer, all under the pretense of trying to see what he had written. As he leaned forwards, Harry's breath ghosted over his face, and he suddenly found that the other boy's lips were far too close. Draco's breath caught as he turned, eyes immediately drawn to Harry's. They were greener than any forest he'd ever seen, but the iris was mostly hidden by his dilated pupils. Harry was staring right back at Draco, and Draco's heart raced. Almost without conscious thought, his eyes dropped to stare at those perfectly shaped pink lips. His eyes flickered back up to see that Harry was looking at his lips too. Draco swallowed hard.
After they demolished the meal together, Madam Pomfrey came out of her office. She checked them with spells, then dismissed both of them to their common room. Class had ended only moments ago if the loud footsteps and chatter of students was anything to go by.
"Do you know how many times I've been late to class because I had to stop and pick up all my stuff? Do you know how many people have laughed at me while I stood there like an idiot? DO YOU KNOW JUST HOW ANNOYING YOUR LITTLE TRICK WAS?" Harry was panting and Draco's face was slowly turning red. Harry slightly lessened the force he was using so the blonde could breathe. Draco coughed then said, "Harry, if you're going to yell at me, can you do it without being so bloody close?"
Malfoy mumbled something and buried his face into his pillow. Harry got the inexplicable urge to walk back in there and dump a pitcher of cold water on the git. But he refrained, if only because he knew Malfoy would get him back worse later on. And Harry did not fancy having a raging Slytherin plotting his demise, as Malfoy would undoubtedly do if Harry ruined his hair like that.
Harry realized with a start that if Malfoy went back to find that Harry's bed was empty, he would quickly be able to figure out that Harry had slipped out sometime during his conversation with Pansy. Harry hurried back to the dorm as quietly as possible, slipping in and throwing the cloak and map back into his trunk. He tried to lay down in a similar position to the one he woke up in. He was still, heart racing, as he heard the door open and shut quietly. He heard rustling as Malfoy went back to his bed, then the sounds of the curtain being shut, and finally only the sound of breathing. Harry lay in bed, relieved, thinking about what he had heard.
That was his best bet, Draco decided. As long as he did it carefully, no one would be the wiser. He groped around his bedside table for his wand, then pointed it at his closed drapes, muttering "Silencio." He opened his mouth, paused, feeling slightly ridiculous, and then yelled.
"IkindofgotmadatdracoandthenIpinnedhimagainstthewallandwekindofkissed." He rushed out. Hermione raised an eyebrow. "Now again, in English, please." So Harry told them the whole story of how he had kissed Draco and then run away. Ron looked gobsmacked.
"I only meant...I mean....you look friendlier when you smile. Last night you were smiling a lot. You looked happy. Carefree." Potter mumbled.
Draco nodded. "Let me just finish the letter then, and I'll send it off home. If I wait any longer, Mother will have my head."
He carefully shut the door behind him and walked down the hall. He very nearly made it out of the common room.
Having decided, he stopped to unfold the map. Draco halted with him and watched curiously as Harry opened the parchment to its full size. He sucked in a breath in astonishment. "Is that..." he trailed off, wonder in his tone.
Harry jerked his hand back in surprise. He turned to face Draco. The blond was looking at him blankly, eyes wild and slightly unfocused.
Wilson turned to him. "Harry? I would ask you to stay out of harm's way, but you're of age now, and you've proven yourself to be just as capable as any one of us."
"Only the Golden Boy of Gryffindor would say such things," Draco accused him, eyes sparkling with mischief. Harry's heart skipped a beat, but he ignored it for all he was worth. "Takes one to know one," he retorted sweetly.
"It is time for us to return," McGonagall said as if reading his mind. "We can await Mr. Malfoy there if you are right; otherwise, we will let the Aurors find him. Put your mind at rest, Mr. Potter, he is no longer in immediate danger."
"He's staring again," Harry hissed to Hermione. She continued spooning mashed potatoes into her plate calmly.
Just then, the door banged open, making them both jump and drowning out whatever else Draco had been planning to say. Goldstein stood at the door, looking sheepish.
"Ron! I could have broken these!" Harry said crossly. "What about Draco?" he continued, not daring to hope.
Lastly, magpies are best known for their thievery of shiny objects. They covet valuables - gold, silver, jewelry - and only the brightest things capture their attention.
Thankfully, they made it to class on time. Draco slid into his seat next to Potter, who was staring off into space. He hadn't even noticed Draco's arrival. Draco cleared his throat, amused when Potter jumped and looked around for the source of the disruption.
Exhausted, Harry swayed in place, barely feeling the arms keeping him upright. His vision swam and clouded with darkness, and then he was gone too.
As he came out a couple of minutes later, feeling somewhat better, the change to his room suddenly made itself obvious. His most prized possession and his favorite pastime, his ridiculously expensive professional brewing kit, was not in its place. And considering just how heavy and unwieldy the thing was, it was very unlikely that someone had moved it just for amusement. Besides that, no one had visited him in days.
"Nightmares?" Draco asked him. Harry nodded. "Well," Draco adopted a thoughtful expression. "I could always share your bed if that'll help," Draco smirked and fluttered his eyelashes flirtatiously, causing Harry to have a coughing fit.
"I think that's Hypnos," Harry corrected. "But Hyperion is a great name, isn't it?" he addressed the last part to the crup, kissing it softly on the nose. Draco snorted.
Harry pulled at his hair in frustration. "How can you just forgive me like that? It's my fault I didn't pay close enough attention to you and Snape. You should hate me for this."
"Wonderful," Pansy drawled dryly. "You're both as sickeningly sappy as the other. No wonder you two make a perfect pair."
"Malfoy?" Harry probed. He was aware this could go down in flames any moment, but as long as their conversation remained civil, he was going to try to make the most of it.
"Okay, Potter, I'm going to make this quick, before Dray comes over here and murders me." She scowled at him with the force of a million stampeding erumpets. "You better make this date good. He'll never admit it, but he's a romantic type, and he cares about these things. If this is boring, he'll wait until you're married with kids and tell them you were a terrible boyfriend and they shouldn't listen to any of your advice. He'll bring it up in arguments and use it as leverage. He's petty like that, we all are." She looked over his shoulder at Draco, eyes softening, then back at Harry. "Be good to him, and he'll repay you a million times over. He cares about you, Potter, so make sure you deserve it." With that, she flounced off, pushing past him.
Since the Plan to Make Their Relationship Public, as they were calling it, Draco and Harry, and occasionally their friends, had taken to sitting at each other's tables during mealtimes. Today, it was Gryffindor.
"My apologies, father. Next time I'll be sure to run away with greater success," Draco drawled, unable to bring himself to regret his impertinence.
"Don't be boring," Draco chided him from across the chessboard, where he was playing a rather spectacular match against Ron. Harry reminded himself to thank his best mate for making an effort. Harry raised his head just enough to glare at the smug Slytherin.
Draco found it hard to decide whether he should take the risk or keep flying. It could mean getting home faster, but encountering a group of muggles would be strange and possibly dangerous. Finding a group of wizards could be even more so. So, Draco flew on.
Potter snorted, and it sounded remarkably like the reindeer from only moments ago. "You mean almost fly. It was kind of majestic until you fell on your face. And besides, how do you know about muggle carols?" Potter asked curiously. Draco shrugged. "Malfoys are naturally majestic, Potter. And it's kind of hard not to with all the muggleborns walking around singing them all the time during the winter hols." Potter smiled. "You don't call them mudbloods anymore," he observed.
He turned slowly, dreading what that voice would say to him now. He opened his eyes, staring into the famous green gaze of one Harry Potter. The Boy Who Lived to Make Draco Suffer was watching him intently. All the other Death Eaters, including his mother and father, had already disappeared into the forest behind him, no doubt apparating away as soon as they crossed the apparition wards. He should have been with them. But now, he was going to get caught and thrown into Azkaban, all because he couldn't resist the bloody Chosen Git's call.
"I should have known, Harry. Who else would be skulking about, invisible, no less, at this time of night?" Draco asked exasperatedly. "But why, may I ask, have you accosted me-" Harry slapped his hand over Draco's mouth quickly and shook his head frantically. The blond glared at him but thankfully remained silent. Only seconds later, they could hear Peeves approaching, singing a song at the top of his lungs, and occasionally cackling. By what they could make out of it, it was quite a sexual little ditty. The off-key voice grew louder and louder before finally fading away.
"Could you help Draco over to your dorm? He's a bit more drunk than he usually gets. Could you just help guide him to your room, make sure he lies down? It would be a huge help." Blaise gave him a pleading look, laying it on a bit thick. Damn, Draco would have to get Blaise a fucking fruit basket for that. Though, to be honest, Blaise probably had less than benevolent intentions, Draco thought, eyeing Longbottom.
Harry huffed in annoyance. His eyes landed on the book. "Really, Draco? Transformation Magick for the Transfiguration Master? You hardly qualify as a Transfiguration Master." Draco scowled at him.
Draco yelped and scrambled back, but the railing of the balcony prevented him from moving anywhere. He sluggishly threw up his arms to protect his face, accidentally flinging the glass off the balcony, but the magpie had a different target. Though he couldn't see it through his hands, he felt the sharp claws pierce his shirt and the skin over his heart, leaving four shallow but painful puncture wounds.
"Don't worry, Harry, your face is fine. And it doesn't seem like he's staring any more than usual." Hermione was clearly not as concerned about this as she should have been.
"I asked her for a book that taught me how to become an animagus, did the steps, and transformed into a dragon. I knew that would be my form since we brewed the potion in Professor Snape's class. Then, I flew out the window until I found a village," Draco answered in a monotone voice.
Well, that explained it. Harry skimmed over the next few instructions, and seeing nothing else of import, turned to Malfoy, raising an eyebrow. "May I get the ingredients now, your highness? I promise I won't get the werewolf hairs until your majesty demands it of me." He gave Malfoy a fake pleading look, even batting his eyelashes for dramatic effect.
Recalling the student's words, he wondered what had prompted him to say them. Surely Malfoy was too haughty and proud to believe that his actions deserved punishment. It would be kind of like apologizing, and Merlin knew Malfoys never did that. But just then, Harry was suddenly accosted by a memory, words whispering through his mind.
Harry smiled at her. "You are a genius, Hermione. Maybe I'll try that. But for tonight I'll just walk around the castle a bit like I usually do. 'Night." He said, then walked off to exit the room.
Thankfully, Potter did as he was told for once and held the Horgwallow down, prying open its mouth at the same time. But just as Draco had picked up one of the slimy worms and was about to lower it into the small mouth, the creature gave a violent jerk and squirmed out of Potter's grip, splattering Draco with the mysterious goo in the process. Draco shrieked and spluttered.
Draco sighed. He kind of wanted to try growing wings. But he wasn't some reckless Gryffindor with a blatant disregard for instructions. Maybe he would try talons. He closed his eyes again and allowed his mind to zoom in on the talons. They were black, wicked, and menacingly sharp. He grinned in excitement, and his eyes fell on the book once more.
"I want to be with you," Draco said firmly. "Now, should I tell Mother, or would you rather wait?" He asked as if he didn't particularly care either way. Harry thought for a second.
He took a deep breath. Hermione gave him an encouraging look. She had figured out that something was wrong, while Ron still just looked confused. Harry opened his mouth, then closed it again. Hermione smiled gently. "You can tell us, Harry. Don't worry. Whatever it is, we can figure it out." Harry fidgeted with his sleeve.
Harry watched the blond warily, but something far more intense stirred inside his body at the innocent question. "Only if you want it to be, Malfoy." He returned, holding his breath in anticipation.
He slid down the bars that kept him from falling, looping his arms around his knees and hugging them to his chest, wine glass still loosely grasped. Draco smiled when the bird followed, landing gracefully in front of him. But, wait- was the bird- was it changing? It was! The feathers were becoming longer, blacker, almost pearlescent, like an oil slick on the pavement. Some of the plumes turned white instead, especially those near the wings. The tail elongated until it was nearly twice as long as the bird itself. Its eyes were still amber, but now they were covetous and calculating.
Draco ultimately decided to put the rest of the memories aside and enjoy them later, since they took quite a bit of time to get through. Anyway, he was excited for Harry to open his present.
The next day, Harry decided he would ask Draco out on a date, to make it official. He didn't want to do it publicly - that would be asking for trouble - so he had to wait until no one else was around. Unfortunately, that did not happen as often as one might think for such a large castle. Every time Harry glanced over at the blond, he seemed to be with someone or another. Slytherins, Ravenclaws, Hufflepuffs, even Gryffindors were always hanging around him, chattering about one thing or another. He supposed he could ask to talk to Draco alone, but he was already so nervous. It would be like seeking out a potential disaster.
A small child was clapping and pointing at him. The mother looked flabbergasted. "Oh my, it really is a dragon," she breathed. The woman pulled out a flat rectangular box sort of thing, tapped at it a bit, and suddenly, a bright light briefly blinded him. Then, she tapped it a bit more and held it to her ear.
"Hey Dray, Potter," she greeted. Harry glanced sideways at the blond at the nickname, but Draco ignored him, glowering at Parkinson instead.
"Welcome. And to our returning students, welcome back. Last year was a troubling time, as many of you know, and we must begin to look towards our considerably brighter future. It is time to come together, as witches and wizards. No longer must we fear a name and no longer must we live in terror, wondering if we will be next. We must come together to prevent such dangers from ever facing our world again. It is in this time that we must put aside our differences and learn to accept one another, for it is the outcasts of society that hold the largest grudges against those that oppress them. In this time, we must put aside our house differences and come together as students of one school, united, as the Sorting Hat has advised." She paused, letting her words sink in. "And with that in mind, we will look towards the eldest among us as an example. Our first and only 8th years must be our guides. They will show you what it means to be united. Among the 8th years, there will be no houses. There will only be students. To aid them in this endeavor, they will all reside in a tower of their own, unseparated by house lines. I hope the rest of you will look to them and follow their example. Houses were never meant to divide, but to bring together similar people that can bring out the best traits in their peers. We must put ourselves back on that path, for we have strayed far. I sincerely hope that this will be a step in the right direction." She sat down, to absolute silence. Then, from the Gryffindor table, loud clapping broke out, and soon the entire hall was cheering for their new headmistress.
"Then come here, you prat, so you can properly enjoy it this time." Draco's eyes lit up, and he did exactly that.
The next morning, Harry woke up entirely exhausted. The nightmares were really too much. He didn't know how much longer he could survive them. Harry resolved to stay in bed until at least lunch.
"Ginny," he began hesitantly. She shot him a bright smile. "Yes, Harry?" Harry opened his mouth, but nothing came out. Ginny immediately turned to face him fully. "What's wrong, Harry?" She asked, concern evident on her face.
Narcissa's reply arrived promptly that evening. It was almost impressive how fast the owl must've had to fly to make it there and back so quickly. Harry, eager for a break from his incessant studies, tore open the envelope and began to read.
Draco was embarrassingly drunk, of course, and crashed face-first on the bed, somehow dragging Harry down with him. Past-Harry landed on top of past-Draco, arms bracketing his head.
Harry glanced at the Prophet for the seventh time in the last few hours. All the Prophets had been the same since the war had ended - they either praised him for his defeat of Voldemort, mourned for those who had been killed, talked about the nonexistent changes in the Ministry, or reported on the status of the nationwide Death Eater roundup. This particular issue was headlined: "MALFOYS CAPTURED AND AWAITING TRIAL TO TAKE PLACE ON THE 11TH OF JUNE. IS THIS TO BE THEIR REDEMPTION OR THEIR DOWNFALL?"
After what felt like an age, he felt the final snares of magic dissipate into the air, freeing the door to be opened. Harry practically slumped against it, desperately trying to push it open. With the Auror's help, he managed it, and the door swung open.
Licking and sucking and biting his way down Draco's neck, Harry made sure to linger in all the most tortuous places, then retraced his path back up the pale stretch of skin. By the time he got to Draco's jaw, Draco was extremely aroused, almost painfully so.
Pansy grinned at him. "We were talking about having a party. Possibly even with the other houses. I was asking if you thought it was a good plan, but obviously, you're too infatuated with Potter to listen to us plain, old Slytherins. I mean, I get we didn't save the world or anything, but-" Draco interrupted her.
Unfortunately for him, Potter was there, struggling to take his robes off. (Un)Fortunately, Potter was wearing his muggle clothes underneath. Draco stared as Potter finally extracted his head, hair messier than usual. Potter looked startled to see him. Draco leaned back against the door, crossing his arms and raising his eyebrow.
They walked into the Great Hall all together. Many of the students started whispering, but McGonagall looked quite proud. They separated to their tables, then began to dig in. There was a large spread of delightful foods, and Ron looked gleeful. Harry spent the time chatting away amicably with the other Gryffindors and occasionally glancing at Draco. Sometimes their eyes would meet, and they would share a smile.
Might as well give it a go. Draco stayed back after class, ignoring the questioning look from Harry. He waited until everyone else left, then approached McGonagall's desk. "Professor," he started, "I was wondering if I could ask for some clarification." She gave him a curious glance, then went back to her papers, but signaled for him to continue.
Draco was pants at wandless magic, but he could manage a simple Lumos. It was weaker than what he usually achieved with his wand, but it was something. Whatever these dampeners were, they only affected wand magic.
Draco glared. "You promised you wouldn't laugh," he accused indignantly. Harry smiled even more at that. "I'm not laughing at you," he assured Draco through his grin. "I'm just happy."
"That's not a good start," Harry muttered, spreading the article on the table before them so they could both read it.
"Ouch!" Harry yelped, yanking his hand back quickly. "Did you just bite me?" He asked incredulously. Draco stared him down. "Yes, and it was well deserved. Do you really, honestly think I would kiss you, let alone say all the ridiculously soppy things that just came out of my mouth, risking everything of what's left of my already greatly diminished reputation, if I didn't feel something for you? Merlin, Harry, you are an idiot."
"You're right; they would be delighted," Draco lied. "I don't need anything at the moment, thanks, but I'll tell you if I think of something." He would think of something eventually - before she took him to Italy. And if he didn't, well, he would never again make fun of Harry's hero complex if it saved him.
Draco shook his head irritatedly. "I already know that I'm being overly sensitive; I don't need you to tell me that." He sighed. "It's nothing. It's not something Potter did; it's more something he didn't do."
"The mark of a murderer reminds you that I'm not a bad person?" He asked skeptically. Harry shook his head. "No, it's- it's difficult to explain. It just...it reminds me of everything you've done, but also everything you didn't do. You could have been so much worse, you know? But you fought against it, even when your life was at stake. You never embraced the darkness like so many others could and would have done. Despite everything else, you never embraced him." Harry tried to reason. Draco still didn't seem to buy it.
Draco ignored him and Pansy and looked away, his arms crossed. Why had he been angry in the first place? Potter didn't owe him anything. In fact, it was Draco that owed Potter. So why was he so angry that Potter didn't want to talk to him? It was entirely understandable that the Chosen One didn't want to talk to a Death Eater. And yet the thought made him feel queasy. Their ride went on in silence until they reached the castle. When he finally looked at his friends, they were still watching him, except now they had identical smirks. Draco huffed and hurried into the Great Hall, sitting down at the Slytherin table as far away from everyone else as possible. Pansy and Blaise followed him, unperturbed.
"I don't want McGonagall to know," Draco said shortly. Harry cocked his head to the side. "Why not? It would be easier and safer. Not to mention legal."
Harry watched as confusion, apprehension, and surprise battled each other across Draco's face before his expression finally settled into one of annoyed realization. The taller boy leaned back to make some space. The maneuver wasn't all that successful, considering the size of the closet, but Draco still managed a couple of inches, then grasped blindly in front of him and tugged, successfully ridding Harry of his cloak. Harry grinned at him sheepishly.
"Draco, darling," Pansy's much too loud and cheerful voice sang out. He raised his head so he could properly glare at her. She shoved a foaming blue potion in his face. Recognizing it immediately, he snatched it and guzzled the contents, sighing in relief as the Hangover potion took effect right away. He blinked hard as everything went back to normal.
A couple of days later, it was Saturday, and the 8th years were particularly excited. McGonagall had given them special permission to go out to Hogsmeade every weekend, and everyone intended to take full advantage of it. Harry, Hermione, and Ron were trudging down to the village. Ron was excited to see his brothers, who had recently bought Zonko's and turned it into a branch of their flourishing business.
It was the mudblo- Granger. He would have to get used to that. He quickly looked around for that god-awful hair, because if Granger was there, then the Weasel and Potter would be there too. Draco told himself he only wanted to see Potter to thank him for the trial. Not to confirm that what Pansy had said was true. He almost convinced himself. Almost.
Once they arrived, they set about finding an empty table. The library was surprisingly quite full, even though it was only the beginning of the year. Draco spotted Theo and Granger at different tables, but he wanted to be alone with Harry.
Harry just scowled at both of them, not even fazed by their confusing manner of speech. The twins glanced at each other.
"Parkinson?" Harry asked. Wow, Harry really didn't want to look after Draco. He was slightly offended. Blaise became annoyed on his behalf. "She's tending the bar and can't leave." He proceeded to list the whereabouts of literally everyone else.
"What view?" Harry asked. "I'm nothing to look at." He tried to laugh it off as a joke, but Draco heard the self-consciousness underlying his tone. His eyes snapped up to meet the iconic green ones, and immediately he knew something was off.
Unwilling to give himself false hope until he had more to go off of, Harry looked about desperately for any other evidence that might corroborate his theory. A glint of light caught his eye.
What Pansy told you is true, Harry and I have indeed become friends. It has not been easy by any means, but it is not something I intend to give up on without a fight. He has been good to me, far better than I could ever expect or deserve.
"Don't. If you're apologizing because of what Pansy said earlier, then I would rather you didn't. I am fine." Draco interrupted him rather huffily.
"I'm quite proud, to be honest. And it's Potter-Malfoy, not Potter. I'd never have finished that book without my husband's help and occasional coercion." There. The press loved it when he talked about their question and Draco in the same statement.
Draco stood in a rush. He threw down some muggle money - he did not care to count out his change at the moment - and strode out of the bar at a fast clip.
"Maybe, Draco. But you won't know until you ask." Draco looked horrified at that suggestion. Pansy snickered at him. "Since I'm such a wonderful friend, I might consider going and figuring it out for you. For a price, of course. There was a beautiful emerald bracelet in Witch Weekly, and I think it would look quite nice on my wrist. And you know how much I love green, darling." Draco nodded emphatically. "Consider it your Christmas present," he promised her, and she gave him a Slytherin grin. "Just leave it to me, sweetie."
Harry was having a really bad morning. His nightmares had kept him awake through the night. When he finally got to sleep, he was shaken awake only hours later by Ron, whom he had subsequently yelled at. Ron was bewildered by his awful attitude and had left him alone to go to breakfast. Harry had felt bad about it immediately after, but it wasn't enough to snap him out of his mood.
Despite his patrician upbringing, Draco's mouth fell open. Under the other man's scrutiny, he hastily shut it. "I am Draco Malfoy, but I am most certainly not the prince, nor royalty of any kind."
Draco took a deep breath. Facing his father - real or scarily accurate alternate version of him - would always be an ordeal. If this man were anything like Lucius, as he seemed to be thus far, Draco was in for one hell of a tongue-lashing.
"See," he said exaggeratedly like he was speaking to a child, "this is a mirror. And those-" he pointed at Harry's defined torso in the mirror "-are called abdominal muscles. Abs. Say it with me. Aaabs."
"Harry," Draco greeted him. His eyes slid over the witch and wizard beside him. "Granger, Weasley," he added cordially. Then he turned back to Harry. "Could I borrow you for a moment? I need to talk to you about something." Harry glanced at his friends as if asking permission. Granger looked faintly amused and knowing, while Weasley rolled his eyes. The brunet turned back to him and nodded, waiting quietly with Draco as everyone else filed out of the room. When the place was empty, Draco opened his mouth to speak, but Harry beat him to it.
Harry sat on the ground beside him. "Is it helping any?" Draco looked frustrated. "No. It tells me I need to clear my mind, which I've no trouble with, but then it says I must practice imagining something with enough detail to be accurate but not so much that I lose sight of the whole picture."
"It was the party," Draco told him. Harry looked a bit self-conscious but overall extremely proud of himself. "And?" he asked.
"See, Maria? I told you this thing was dangerous! Stay behind me," Paul said with false bravado. "Maybe I better call Jack here. He's better equipped to deal with situations like this."
After their uneventful lesson, they rushed to Transfiguration. McGonagall tested the limits of their skills and memory when she asked them to transfigure a fish into a bird of their choice. By the end of the lesson, Harry had a sparrow with a dorsal fin, Ron had a flamingo with gills, and Hermione had a perfectly beautiful finch. Malfoy was sitting with a proud eagle owl on his shoulder, also without fault.
After checking the time, Draco determined that the last class was still in progress, and they had a couple of hours before the feast. He began his work, even though it was due the following week. It was better to stay on top of things than to rush the assignment at the last minute.
Draco nearly fell off the bench. The court broke out in whispers again. Harry Potter, Golden Boy and champion of the light, defending known Death Eaters? It was unheard of. Resentment burned in him. Hadn't he told Potter that he and his mother didn't need nor want saving? It was just like the git to go ahead and do what he wanted and ignore his wishes. Bloody savior.
"We've been over this, Malfoy. You don't deserve to go to jail. I'm not the only one who thinks that - the jury were the ones to let you go." Harry tried to reason with him. Malfoy just shook his head. "It's okay, Harry. You don't have to try to make me feel better. I was a bad boy, and I should have been punished." Harry was once again struck by how innocent Malfoy sounded. He truly sounded like a child at that moment. Harry sighed. "No, Malfoy. You had your reasons. Decent ones, too. I'm glad you weren't sent to jail." Harry figured it was okay to tell him that. After all, it was in the interest of getting Malfoy to calm down, and it was even a tiny bit true. Okay, more than a tiny bit true.
Draco groaned. His head was throbbing, an immediate and intense reprimand for his poor choices. When he opened his eyes, the blinding rays of the sun seared through his brain, making everything so much worse. He sat there for at least fifteen minutes, allowing his eyes to adjust to the bright afternoon light, then struggling to get to his feet, his body swaying precariously.
Let sit and boil for 30 seconds exactly, then add in 17 Toenails of an Ogre. Wait five seconds, then stir twice, first clockwise, then counter-clockwise.
Draco scanned the room for his friends, but none of them were in sight. As he turned, his gaze was snagged by Potter, who was hugging the Weaslette. Jealousy flared inside Draco, and he struggled with the urge to go rip the girl away from Potter. He successfully tamped it down but decided that if there was any time for a drink, it was then. He approached the tables, where he spotted Pansy acting as bartender. He sat in front of the bar-like area and waited for her to give him her attention. When she turned to him, she broke out in a smile.
Harry paced in front of the gargoyles that lined the Headmaster's - Headmistress' - office. This was taking far too long. Who knows what was happening to Draco in the meanwhile.
"Thanks, Harry. But actually, I just remembered something you said at the trial. You said Dumbledore and Snape had planned it all ahead. Is that true?" Draco asked curiously.
"Did something happen between you two, Draco? While you were all alone together in your dorm, no one around to stop you..." she trailed off suggestively. Draco spluttered. "Of course not, we didn't do anything of the sort!" She raised an eyebrow sardonically. "So you spent hours doing absolutely nothing? Don't lie, Draco, it's boring."
That evening, Draco headed for the common room while Harry left to study in their dorm. He lounged in his favorite armchair, a grey not unlike the color of his eyes, and stared absently into the flickering fire. The ever-changing colors and leaping tongues of flame captured his attention like nothing else, leaving his mind blissfully empty of complicated thought. Suddenly, he had an epiphany, and he launched himself out of the chair and hurried to his room. Gracefully, of course.
That all ended when Pansy, followed closely by Granger, burst into their room. Blaise and the Weasel trailed behind the girls. "Where were you two?" Pansy shrieked at them. Draco and Harry shared a glance.
"Well?" Pansy said, hands on her hips, foot tapping the ground. Draco sighed. "Harry didn't want to leave because... because of reasons that I cannot and will not reveal. So I brought him breakfast, but then he asked me not to leave, so I didn't. He needed me, Pans, I honestly couldn't leave him like that." Pansy looked a bit miffed.
Harry blinked. This was not anything like what he had expected. He thought he had forgotten to do something important or anything else along those lines. It was oddly...cute. He smiled widely, catching the Slytherin off guard.
Harry blushed and looked back down at the book. Then he realized Malfoy was still holding his wrist. He looked over to him.
Harry looked sheepish. "Okay...erm, I had a nightmare one night, and I was trying to get out of our dorm when I- er- happened to hear you talking to Parkinson in the common room. I didn't mean to eavesdrop," he emphasized. "I was only trying to pass through. But, I couldn't help but listen to what you were saying."
Draco blushed at the compliment but groaned. "I can't deal with this now, or quite frankly, ever. Why, Merlin, why did I have to be attracted to someone so incredibly stupid?" Harry laughed at that.
In the meanwhile, Potter had gone to get the remaining ingredients. They silently fell into their previous routine of Draco asking for ingredients and Potter handing them over. Obviously, Draco was the one to actually make the potion. He turned to Potter.
Once his mind was blissfully blank, he recalled his dragon form. Though small and short-lived, Draco had loved being a dragon. He felt so free and so powerful - like nothing was out of his reach. He smiled as the elegant creature filled his mind. But this was only the easy part. This is what he had done in Step 2. Now, it was time to go further. He opened his eyes to read the next bit.
Harry ran his hands up Draco's arms soothingly. "Hey," he spoke softly. "It'll be fine. Besides, this is all just a formality. Even if they stand up and start booing, it won't change how I feel about you. In fact, if they do that, I'll hex every last one of them."
She sniffed. "I see. Owls are more important than friends now, I suppose. Who cares that Pansy had to walk down by herself to lunch when you could spend some quality time with stinky birds?" Draco tried very hard not to smile. It would not endear himself to the angry girl. "Oh Pans, you know it's not like that. I thought you were with Blaise; otherwise, I would have kept you company. Gentlemanly manners and all that." He bit into a small chunk of fish.
"Harry, what in Merlin's name were you thinking? You could have been seriously hurt! Honestly, if you were going to be this distracted the whole bloody time, I wouldn't have agreed to this." Draco huffed angrily. Harry tried to look apologetic but was very distracted by Draco's lean body stretched out on top of his. Draco continued his rant, scowling at Harry the entire time.
Harry sighed again because he knew he couldn't stop there. "And he kissed me this morning. I also told him I wanted us to be together. And so now we're dating?" He said the last part as a question because he genuinely had no clue.
It didn't take long for Draco to formulate a plan. Alina came in close to an hour later with some lunch, which was actually quite delicious, and he asked her for a book. A very specific book.
Harry sighed. "Yes, yes, not a lot, and they are." He said, trying to answer every question while still facing the door. He heard a rustling noise, and Hermione walked up to him. She pulled him around and into one of her incredibly comforting hugs. It was like she knew the best way to give a hug in any scenario. She'd probably read a book on the techniques of hugging if Harry was being honest.
Hagrid dismissed the class, and Draco turned to find Potter so he could needle him about the blushing, only to find the boy back with his friends and heading up to the castle. Draco gazed after him, but just shook himself after a minute and hurried to catch up with Pansy and Blaise.
Harry was worn out. He collapsed into one of the sofas in the common room, Ron not far behind him. Hermione bustled in, arms full of books and parchment.
Pansy and Blaise had asked what Potter had wanted as soon as Draco exited the room, much to his chagrin. He hadn't told them about his attackers, and he had hoped he wouldn't have to. But he didn't see any way of getting out of it without lying, so he reluctantly told them about the events that had taken place before class. Pansy and Blaise were appropriately outraged.
"For now," Ron muttered beside him, in between stuffing his mouth full of chicken and turkey. Harry smacked him upside the head and glanced around furtively, but no one had heard. Everyone had heard Harry's comment, though, and they were all looking at him in surprise, aside from Hermione and Ron. "What?" He asked. Dean spoke up. "Never thought I'd see the day when you and Malfoy decided to become buddies." Harry rolled his eyes. "He's not all that bad anymore. And we're dorm mates, we have to get along, or we'd be too preoccupied to sleep."
Pansy rolled her eyes. "Is that because you want to finish the potion or because Potter is your potions partner?" Draco shot her a glare as they rushed into the Great Hall, which was almost empty.
Harry ignored the questions. He felt bad for it, but he resorted to elbowing people to make headway through the crush. He had barely made it a few meters before a warm, strong hand latched onto his shoulder and guided him out of the crowd. He looked up to see Kingsley Shacklebolt. Shacklebolt expertly made way through, and soon enough, they found themselves in a quiet hallway.
The corners of McGonagall's lips nearly lifted into a smile. "Perhaps, Mr. Malfoy, but something tells me you already have a project in mind. Heaven knows there would be no way for me to stop you, so the only way I can make sure you don't get yourself killed is to offer my help. If it's focus you're after, I insist you retrieve this book from the library." She scribbled something on a sheet of parchment and handed it to Draco. "And please, Mr. Malfoy, if I could ask a favor from you?" Draco nodded obligingly for her to continue. "You may use any of the old classrooms on the fourth floor for your project. But no more sneaking out at night, you'll fall sick or get killed by one of those horrific creatures in the forest."
Kissing was fine, he decided. Better than fine, actually. He desperately wanted to kiss Draco again, as many times as he could get away with. And this, the cuddling, was wonderful as well. And he thought that just maybe, he might be ready to go a little bit further. He still wasn't ready to go all the way and do the biggest thing, but he could handle some fooling around. Probably. He would handle it because he was an adult now, and adults didn't run away from physical intimacy like cowards.
"Thanks," he grumbled out. "I think I need a new bag, this one's getting old." Draco rolled his eyes at him. "Really, Harry. You need to stop keeping all your old stuff. I cannot believe you wear the same pajamas you wore in first year, it's disgraceful for our savior to be in such drab clothing." Normally, Harry would have recognized the joking tone and shot a playful insult back, but today he was just not in the mood.
In fact, the thing he hated, despised, absolutely detested about the voice was what it made him feel.
Draco let out a bark of laughter. "I truly love it when you go all Slytherin on me, Harry. But-" the blond leaned closer again. This time, his lips brushed Harry's lobe as he spoke. "-what did we say about calling me Malfoy?" Draco felt rather than saw the shudder that went through Harry's body as he was reminded of the broom closet incident. The other boy's breaths were coming quicker now.
"So what? It's not like you don't enjoy it. You love having his attention. It's why you keep annoying him." Blaise didn't even look at Draco.
Harry was pissed. Didn't he deserve to spend one year, just one, in peace? He was annoyed with McGonagall. Couldn't he have at least been with at least one Gryffindor? He understood and admired her push for unity, but he felt much less gracious when it meant he had to sleep in the same room as Draco Malfoy.
Please write back soon, my love. You know how I worry. Please tell me you have listened to what I told you at the beginning of the year. Your happiness is all I wish for anymore.
Harry could tell she had more to say, but Draco swept into the seat beside him at that exact moment, and they exchanged a glance and decided to save the topic for later.
It didn't have to be an innuendo. Maybe Draco meant that he liked eating food more than he liked vomiting it out. That would be a perfectly reasonable interpretation of the statement. Unfortunately, Harry was a teenager, not all that innocent, and very prone to thinking about these kinds of things around Draco. Heat practically radiated off his face when his mind decided to conjure up images. Images where Draco just happened to be on his knees in front of Harry, putting things into his mouth. Curse his imagination.
"Draco, you've been staring at Potter since our very first meal in the Great Hall. And he stares right back. You've been eye-fucking each other almost since you met. And don't get me started on 6th year."
He paused there, quill suspended in the air, ink dripping gently. Maybe he should find Harry, so he could tell his mother what his reaction was to the note. He also wondered if he should tell her about their involvement with each other, and desperately wanted Harry's opinion on the matter. Decided, he resolved to find the boy as soon as they finished Charms class.
They were still standing in the middle of the hallway. Harry touched Draco's arm. "Draco? Are you alright?" Draco stared at him blankly. "Why doesn't the rest of the world know any of this?" He asked bluntly.
But Malfoy did, and he whipped it out and screamed, "Impedimenta!" Harry was thrown back onto the floor, and Malfoy quickly shot a stunning spell at him. The last thought he had was of overwhelming, all-encompassing regret.
He very quickly made a decision. Harry ran to the end of the hall and sharply turned right, nearly bowling Draco over. He grasped his slim wrist and tugged him through the nearest door, which happened to lead to a broom closet. A very small broom closet.
Slowly, he tentatively brought his lips closer to Draco's. He felt the other boy's breath on his lips, and then finally their lips were touching. Draco sighed into the kiss and his other hand reached up to tangle itself into the raven black hair. They moved slowly, trying to memorize how the other's lips felt. Then, Harry felt a hot tongue licking at his bottom lip and he gasped, allowing Draco to enter his mouth. Draco was thorough, exploring every inch of his mouth with his tongue. Their kiss was hot, searing, as Harry took over and pushed his tongue into Draco's mouth. Harry's arms had wound themselves around Draco's neck and they were kissing passionately. Draco tugged on Harry's hair, rougher than he had in his dream. But Harry still gave a delighted moan, spurring their kiss into new heights of intensity.
Harry waited patiently, perfectly content to take the chance to let his eyes roam over Draco's gorgeous face.
The small group of six houses - huts, really - certainly did not seem to qualify. Built in a somewhat circular shape, the little gathering more resembled a camping trip, or even a small cult if he was being really imaginative. Draco didn't know what to expect from them, and he didn't know if they were wizards or not.
I wonder if Draco has told you about his mission? He has decided to become an animagus. He has this idea that his animagus form - a dragon - is so ideally suited to him that he has to be able to show it off at a moment's notice. He's been working tirelessly for many nights to bring his goal to fruition, and my theory is that he managed to do it while he was imprisoned, and he escaped out the window.
Draco, still not seeing any sign of Harry, was beginning to worry. Surely he would make it back from whatever he was doing on time to go on their date? If not...well, then, it would be safe to say Harry had ditched him.
Did Malfoy really- was he really-? Harry tried to imagine Malfoy with another bloke. Kissing another bloke. That same feeling he had felt in the common room shot through him again. At least he knew now that Malfoy wasn't dating Parkinson. But why did that knowledge soothe the angry feeling in his chest? And why did the thought of Malfoy being with some random bloke only make it worse? This was far too much for his sleep-deprived brain to handle. He drifted off, thoughts of Malfoy and this newest realization filling his head.
He tried to scream and cry and curse Voldemort for all he was worth, but the only thing that came out was a high, cold laugh.
"Are you alright, Harry?" She asked. Harry nodded. "Just a bit queasy. It'll pass, but I think walking around might help." Harry waved at the two and left them alone, walking into the dungeon corridors. He began wandering about aimlessly, then decided he may as well start walking in the general direction of the greenhouses. He ambled along, turning a corner and-
"Potter," Draco grinned, biting into the apple. Potter's eyes widened, and he didn't say anything back. Draco cocked his head and swallowed. "I suppose I should thank you, Potter. I have a very vague memory of Blaise saying he would ask you to take me back to our room. Judging by the fact I woke up in my own bed, I presume he found you?" Draco asked, raising an eyebrow in question. Potter nodded, gaining an apprehensive look.
"So, Potter, in the interest of regaining my title, I just have to know. Are you dating anyone else? Is she an 8th year, a 7th year? Younger?" Then it seemed like Parkinson was looking directly into his soul. "Or could it be that the person you're dating is not a she, but a he?"
I sincerely apologize for not writing sooner. I know you will not like to hear it, but a great many things have come up. Still, I should not have waited so long to write to you.
"Harry," Draco whispered again. Harry's eyes fluttered closed but snapped open again when the blonde whispered again. "Kiss me." Harry searched the gray eyes for any hint of amusement or insincerity that would indicate that he was joking. But he found none.
Draco cleared his throat. "Both of you know Harry, my boyfriend." He stumbled over the word boyfriend, which Harry found utterly endearing. Draco spoke to him while spreading some jam on a piece of toast, "And, Harry, you know Blaise and Pansy, my sometimes friends."
He stormed out into the hall, locking his flat behind him. Draco went down the stairs, pulling up his hood as he exited into the rain. He scowled, cursing Potter and every witch and wizard that had voted to restrain his magic. It was too flaky now; magic was already fickle and limiting his control over it did not help in the slightest.
Draco sighed. It wasn't that big of a deal. He could live with Harry avoiding him for a while longer. He had lived with being his nemesis for years, so this wasn't all that much, comparatively. But at least he had been able to see Harry then. Now, he barely saw the beautiful green eyes, the messy black hair, and gorgeous golden skin. He only saw flashes of Harry out of the corner of his eye, unless they were in class. He missed him. It was almost too cruel that Draco had finally become friends with Harry only to mess up and ask him to kiss him. At least this was better than if the Gryffindor had refused. Salazar, that would have been awkward.
"You wish, Potter. Give me a moment to grab my broom, and we'll see who's the better Seeker." He leaped off the bed, gracefully. About ten minutes later, they were walking out onto the Quidditch pitch, laughing and insulting each other playfully. Harry grabbed a spare practice Snitch reserved for Seeker's games, and, after a look at Draco, released it. They counted to five together, then took off at almost the same time.
He nearly sprinted to the forest, but his patrician upbringing simply would not allow something as undignified as running. He speedwalked. Gracefully, of course.
"-and so I came here to talk to you because I have no idea what to do." Hermione didn't look the least bit surprised. "Well, did you enjoy it? Or were you uncomfortable?"
"Well, Potter? Shall we get started?" Draco asked coolly. Potter turned and walked to the nearest unclaimed box, Draco close behind him.
"And you're friends now? You call him Harry?" Draco rolled his eyes. Pansy was being particularly slow today. "Yes, Pans. We're friends." Pansy gave him a sly look. "Not more than friends? Not boyfriends? I'm disappointed, Draco. I thought you would have found a way to slither in Potter's pants by now."
Malfoys do not feel. And once it might have been true. Not for Draco, though, not since 4th year, when he realized just how nervous he was for the boy with the messy black hair and green eyes. Especially when that boy had to face a dragon, and when he had nearly drowned in the Black Lake, and when he had come out of that maze screaming about Diggory and the return of the Dark Lord. And now the voice that stirred up those dreaded feelings was saying his name.
The question might have sounded rude if it were anyone else. But, Harry knew Draco had lost people too, knew that he understood how impossible it was to mention the deceased. Harry smiled comfortingly.
Merlin, sometimes he hated magic with a passion. Sure, it was a tool of great use, but was it worth the never-ending iterations of Dark Lords they would have to face? Before Lord Voldemort, there was Grindelwald. Before him, there were others, and so too would there be more after. Things would be so different if magic didn't exist. But would it be better or worse? Draco honestly had no clue. He had never once had to live without magic. All he knew was that everything certainly would be less complicated.
Draco was having a thoroughly uninteresting morning. He had finally managed to sleep, resulting in him waking up early and leaving the dorm to go find Pansy and Blaise. He had barged into Blaise's dorm, waking all of the occupants in the process, apart from Blaise. The Weasel had grumbled and then left to go find Potter, Longbottom had tripped and fallen back into his bed again, and Macmillan had walked into the bathroom, shooting Draco dark looks.
"Dragons are my area of expertise, you know. That's why they called me in - that and I was in the area checking out a possible dragon egg confiscated from a black market trader. I didn't think there was a baby dragon out in the middle of Britain, so I wasn't all that surprised to find an animagus," Charlie nattered on cheerfully. "You have those distinctive markings that you wouldn't find on any real dragon. I bet you got stuck; that's why they have all those rules about registering before you try. You caused a lot of trouble, you know. The Ministry had to send out their entire team of Obliviators to deal with this mess. They're stretched thin at the mo - a student vanished right out of Hogwarts, and the Aurors have had no luck finding him. Poor Harry..." the Weasel trailed off, more talking to himself. Draco could have hexed him for withholding news about Harry.
At nearly two in the morning, he slipped out once more. He was being reckless, but he no longer cared. Draco wanted this like nothing ever before.
It was Draco's turn to roll his eyes. "Do you need an answer? I quite forgot you had asked me something; the answer was so clear." Harry's heart leaped as he was awarded a dazzling smile. "Saturday. If you forget, you're dead to me."
His mother gave his arm a squeeze, almost like she had heard his thoughts, and was giving him comfort. He looked down at her and smiled. If not for his mother's urging, he would have been back at the Manor, lounging around and wasting the days away. But now he was here, and it was too late to turn back.
Draco Malfoy stood there, looking at him. More specifically, his body. Harry didn't like it when people looked at his body. He hated seeing the pity in their eyes when they realized how skinny and underfed he was. So he fell back to his natural defense mechanism. Anger.
Pansy gave him a soft look. "He's too noble for that. And don't worry, Gryffindorks are far too prudish to walk around half-naked, however delightful it would be."
"You know, it's been far too long since we played a prank on the Gryffindors," Blaise said casually. "We're losing our Slytherin reputation. All the other houses think we've gone soft. Even the Hufflepuffs look down on us."
Their second kiss was even better. Their third was by far the best. And their fourth made Draco rethink his previous sentiment.
Harry and the three Aurors dashed up the stairs, quickly spreading out to check the doors. He ran, allowing his magic to seep out and around, searching. He skidded to a halt when it encountered a heavily warded door, his heart thudding. Harry threw himself into undoing the curses, discarding his wand in favor of using raw magic to untangle the threads of power keeping the door firmly shut.
"Stop!" Parkinson snarled at him. He froze, then slowly turned to face her. She was livid, her eyes lighting up in anger and an ugly scowl resting on her face. "Is that all you have to say, Potter? After what you did?" For one horror-filled moment, he thought Parkinson was blaming him for the kiss and wondered if Draco had really told her. "You've been avoiding Draco for weeks, and 'sorry' is all you can come up with?" She screeched.
"Go to sleep, Malfoy," he told him softly. Then he left the boy, retreating to the bathroom in the hopes he would be unconscious when he came out.
"I really am sorry, Draco. It's just- it's Halloween. My parents...they died on Halloween. Voldemort tried to kill me, the first time, on this very day eleven years ago. Before, it wasn't so hard, but after I saw them again...this day just makes me depressed. But still, I shouldn't have been rude to you." Harry said, hesitating but offering Draco a pained smile. Draco pulled Harry into a hug. The other boy was stiff for a few seconds, but eventually relaxed and put his arms around Draco too.
Harry broke. "I blush because of a dream I had," he confessed. A spark of interest lit up the steely eyes. "A dream?" Draco prodded.
"I just don't get how we're meant to accomplish the Transfiguration. I understand the concept of it, but the execution seems nearly impossible with all the variables we have to keep track of. Is there something we could do to help improve our focus and multitasking abilities?"
The Weasley twins cheerfully ignored his protests and began to show all three of them around their new shop. And of course, they told Harry he could get whatever he liked, free of cost. Harry insisted on paying, though, and they walked out of the shop with pockets bulging with things Filch would most definitely screech at them for if he saw.
Walters wished him luck and left him to the lion's den. Or, perhaps, a more apt expression would be that he had fallen into a pit of snakes.
Draco looked away. "I'm not sure about that one." Harry halted in the middle of flipping through pages. He turned to Draco. "Draco Malfoy, you have saved my life in a few different ways, and we have been over this. You didn't kill him. Snape did." Harry scolded him. Draco still refused to meet his eyes. "But he had to because of me. He made the vow because my mother wanted to protect me. It's my fault."
I am glad you two did not endeavor to hide your relationship from me, and I appreciate the sentiment behind wanting to wait. I take no offense from your actions; they were entirely reasonable.
"You touched it? Why would you want to touch it? It's vile, horrid, and a reminder of everything that went wrong in my life." Draco said, bringing his arm up to his face so he could look at the mark with unadulterated disgust.
"You're right," Draco said apologetically. "The school was pretty wretched. Are we in Italy? And may I ask why you are the one who is rescuing me?"
"Of course," Draco immediately assured her. "It's nothing like that. I happen to find magical theory fascinating, and I was in the process of reading that particular book. I would quite like to be able to finish it," he said, reciting his cover story.
Draco quickly guzzled down a glass of pumpkin juice and shoved some bacon into his mouth. He grabbed an apple to eat on the way to class. Pansy had clearly already eaten because she didn't take anything, just watched him in disgust.
The two boys made their way to the famed sweet shop, which was incredibly full - it happened to be a Hogsmeade weekend for all the lower years too. Together, they pushed through the crowd to the anticipated new treats, managing to snatch a few of them. Quickly, they dashed to pay and left before they could get stolen, laughing the whole way. Harry led Draco to a secluded bench halfway to the Shrieking Shack, and they gobbled up their hard-won prizes, chocolate melting on their hands and in their mouths. Draco stole the last one, and Harry, knowing all about the blond's infamous sweet-tooth, wisely let him. He preferred treacle tarts anyway. And when Draco had finished eating it, Harry kissed him thoroughly, savoring the taste of the rich chocolate on both their tongues.
This was why Harry was confused. And as he did when faced with a particularly challenging problem, he paced. Back and forth and back and forth, he walked. Ron watched him like he was a quaffle being passed from one chaser to another. "Mate," Ron said. Harry ignored him. "Mate," Ron tried again. "Harry. Harry Potter. The Chosen One. The Boy Who Lived Twice. Savior of the Wiz-." "What do you want?" Harry interrupted him. "Knew you would respond to one of those. Didn't know you were so conceited, mate." Ron grinned at him. Harry glared. "I didn't know you knew what 'conceited' meant, Ron." Harry shot back. Ron's smile grew wider.
The moment he stumbled out of the floo at the Ministry, he knew it was a mistake. He should have brought his invisibility cloak. The whole entrance hall was silent for a moment, then it exploded.
"Sod off, Malfoy," he growled. Draco looked taken aback. "Fine, Potter, I was only trying to help. I apologize if I offended your delicate sensibilities." Draco sounded slightly hurt, but Harry couldn't bring himself to care. He finished stuffing the last of his things into his repaired bag, then stalked off to class.
The Chief Warlock looked embarrassed but cleared his throat again. "Very well, Mr. Potter.  The prosecution has already laid out their case, but you may go ahead and begin your testimony." Potter looked confused, then comprehension flitted across his face, followed by anger. "I think you are mistaken, sir. I wish to be a witness for the defense," Potter declared.
"Oh, don't be a prat, Draco. I can tell when you're upset, you know. And I'm not apologizing because of Pansy, though she was right. What I meant is that I was avoiding you, but it wasn't because of anything you did. Well, it was, but- Merlin, I'm bad at this." Harry took a breath and rushed on to make sure Draco heard everything he had to say. "I was avoiding you because of certain things that are entirely my own issues, and no part of it was through any fault of your own. Please, don't blame yourself. It's not your fault I'm having a bisexual crisis." Harry flushed darkly when he realized that he had just outed himself. Draco suddenly looked terribly interested. "You're bisexual? Really? Since when?"
What felt like seconds later, he was waking up from an already-forgotten dream. Harry heard voices around him, shouting and demanding, and he groaned with pain and fatigue.
Since lessons were starting in ten minutes, he stuffed the letter into his bag and hurried off to Flitwick's classroom.
Harry stopped. That voice belonged to Parkinson, he was sure of it. He tiptoed closer until he could see the common room. Malfoy was lying with his head in Parkinson's lap, her fingers threading through his platinum blonde hair. Harry felt a stab of something go through him. It unsettled him. He shouldn't feel a stab of anything except disgust when confronted with such a sight.
Harry, stunned, looked towards his friends. Ron was wearing a similar expression, while Hermione just looked a bit smug. He shook his head in utter confusion, and together they went into the Great Hall.
"Good. Your room assignments are next to the fireplace. No switching." And with that, she swept out of the room.
Draco lowered his eyes to the letter sitting innocently by his plate, the Malfoy family seal plainly visible. With shaking hands, he opened the letter. He could only be glad it wasn't a flaming red howler. His mother was too classy for that.
He turned to Pansy. She was smirking at him. He knew exactly what she was so pleased about, but he gave her a look that plainly said, not here. So instead, he asked her, "Who are you with?"
Next, Draco turned both of his arms into wings. They weren't large enough to support flight while the rest of him was human, and flapping them would be very awkward, especially since humans didn't have the right muscles for it. Nevertheless, it served the purpose of Step 4. Finally, he redid Step 5, once again noting the strangeness of heightened and additional senses.
When his awful lawyer had finished, Potter stood up again. Draco stared at him blankly. Was it time for Potter to leave? Was there somewhere he needed to be? Or maybe this trial was so pathetic that Potter could no longer stand to watch. The Chief Warlock gave Potter a resigned look and allowed him to walk over to the stand. Wait, the stand? What was Potter thinking?
"Yeah," Harry responded, pulling his leg out of the space and back onto solid ground. "My hero," he said affectionately to Draco, swooping in to give him a thank-you kiss.
And then, it was time. Draco couldn't afford to try this more than three or four times - it was magically draining, not to mention mentally exhausting and quite frankly dangerous.
Harry blushed, and Ron, overhearing the comment, laughed loudly. "You should've heard him a couple of weeks ago, Malfoy," he snickered. "He was giving us a detailed description of what you eat and how it changes spending on your mood. Harry insisted it wasn't weird at all. It was quite funny. Definitely strange at the time, but it makes a lot more sense now. Obviously, he fancied you all those years," Ron noted wisely, punctuating it with a confident nod.
Potter stood at the door with a sheepish look on his face, but his visage quickly morphed to one of determination. He strode forward, intent clear on his face. Whispers broke out amongst the court, but they quieted down with a look from the Chief Warlock.
With that, they cast disillusionment charms upon themselves and moved to follow Wilson's orders. Harry, McGonagall, Wilson, and the three Aurors he had named previously all moved together towards the house, while the others split off. It was a small house, a cottage, really, but it was rather well kept for a place so far out in the middle of nowhere. The walls were clean and white, the trimming, roof, and door in pristine condition. The cottage was quaint and looked like it had been lifted right out of the rural French countryside. It certainly didn't look like the place to hold someone prisoner.
As Harry stepped under the steaming water, he felt his muscles loosen. He sighed in contentment. He took far longer than necessary, but he felt like he deserved to be a little selfish. When he turned the water off, he walked out of the shower only to realize he had forgotten to bring a change of clothes. Damn. Harry wrapped his towel around his waist and poked his head out of the en-suite bathroom. He was surprised to see that the room was still empty. Feeling much less uncomfortable, he walked out and over to his trunk. But as he was about to lean down to grab some pajamas, he felt a draft of cold air on his still-damp skin. Harry turned, startled.
"I turned you gay!" Draco exclaimed proudly. "Not gay. Bisexual," he corrected, but he smiled at Draco's enthusiasm. "Now shut up, you great big ponce. You owe me a kiss." He leaned in to collect his reward, and Draco gladly obliged.
Draco smirked, and Harry winced and blushed at his wording. "I didn't mean it like that. I intended to say that you should try visualizing me since I'm right here. You can look at my face or something, then try to recreate it in your mind, and you can see whether you were right or not."
Harry awoke to the unfortunately familiar ceiling of the Hospital Wing. He blinked, trying to remember the series of events that had led him here. He stiffened as he remembered the alien rage he had felt, and nearly gagged when he recalled how he had acted towards Malfoy, who had been wholly undeserving of it. He sat up slowly, wincing, and wondered why he had been so angry. It was not Malfoy's fault; Harry had overreacted on a large scale. He needed to find Malfoy and apologize right away. He whipped the covers off his bed and swung his legs around, so his feet rested on the floor. He froze.
"Everything, Harry. Nothing is right when you're not with me." Harry's heart skipped a beat. Did Malfoy like him? He couldn't believe it. "What do you mean, Malfoy? Do you-" He was cut off by Malfoy, who impatiently said, "You know exactly what I mean, Harry."
"We all know Harry fancied Wood for a bit there," Draco was saying, and to Harry's utter horror, people were nodding along. "I did not fancy Wood!" He whisper-shouted. "I did not like a single male until Draco!" Harry flushed as he spoke the words, not having intended to reveal that fact, even though he was sure most people already knew. Though, maybe not if he considered this whole Wood business.
Both Pansy and Blaise, who were the only people within hearing distance of him, snorted. Blaise leaned forward, resting his chin on his hand.
It was Harry's turn to be surprised. "Me?" He repeated in confusion. "You...you had a crush on me?" He blinked in utter bewilderment. Draco snorted. "Who else would it be? Honestly, Harry, you're shockingly oblivious. Is there anyone else in our entire school besides Pansy and Blaise that I talk to more than you?"
"And we could have been studying this- Harry, are you even listening to me?" Draco asked, stopping in the middle of his tirade. Harry smiled sheepishly. "No." Draco looked scandalized. "So, you didn't hear a thing I said?" Harry shook his head. Draco let his head fall back onto Harry's chest in frustration. Harry shifted uncomfortably.
That was enough to make Draco pause and chew properly. Once he had swallowed the bacon, he glared at Pansy and said, "No one could ever possible mistake me for that ill-mannered ginger idiot. He is far beneath me." Draco scrunched his nose in disgust. Pansy just snickered.
"Yes?" Harry asked, sounding very uninterested in holding a conversation. Not that Draco wanted to either, after knowing what that mouth was capable of.
Paul was a man of medium height with medium-length, stringy, brown hair, and a nervous expression that gained a hint of fear when he saw that Draco was "awake."
Draco deliberately yawned and let loose a small jet of fire. The woman gasped, and her daughter laughed with delight. He looked straight at the pair nonchalantly, then ambled over to a corner as if he cared as much about them as a hippogriff cares about a human. He stretched and curled up like a cat, silently congratulating himself on being such a skilled actor.
He finally looked at her, nodding. "I'll be fine. It's no big deal. The worst thing will be if he decides to walk around shirtless."
Luckily, it seemed that Draco had either forgotten or had chosen to ignore the incident in the library. Harry was still shaken. He had wanted to kiss Draco so badly right then. It almost seemed like Draco had wanted to kiss him too, but then Harry remembered that Pansy had told Draco to find another guy to help get rid of his crush. He felt sick. Was Draco just using him to get over someone else? He was suddenly glad that Madam Pince had yelled at those 4th years because it had stopped Harry from kissing Draco. It had to have been Harry that was leaning in because Draco would never have tried to kiss Harry first.
All too soon, the doorbell rang, and he heard Draco greeting his friends. Harry finished just as they were sitting down, and he had the pleasure of serving piping hot food.
Yes, his inner voice was right. Just because Malfoy acted strangely this one time, didn't mean it would be a recurring event. Harry made sure to lower any expectations he had. He retrieved the ingredients, except for the werewolf hair, and dumped them on the desk he shared with Malfoy. Malfoy had already started to heat up their cauldron, and he quickly snatched up the Dragon's blood and measured it out before pouring it into the cauldron. After a minute, Malfoy held out his hand, palm up, and said, "Circe's Desire."
When they got to the common room, Hermione turned and asked, "Harry, are you alright?" Apparently, he hadn't been as inconspicuous with his discomfort as he had previously thought. He shrugged. "I'm fine, 'Mione. I think the ferret might have fleas, though. My arm felt weird the whole time." Hermione and Ron shared a look but didn't elaborate. Harry had gotten used to this when he had gone through his moody phase in 5th year, so he wasn't too bothered about it. Hermione sighed but moved off of the topic to something else of interest to her. "Have either of you started the Transfiguration essay?" Ron and Harry glanced at each other, then simultaneously shook their heads. Hermione sighed. "I told you, didn't I? Now go write your essays. If you finish them quickly, I might even look them over for you." Harry and Ron rushed to do their work. Hermione's "read overs" had gotten them through most of their classes each and every year before. They knew not to pass up a chance like this.
"Calm down, Potter. It was merely a joke. No need to get upset." Harry was nearly vibrating with fury, even as a small part of his brain wondered why on earth he was getting so upset. Malfoy backed away. "Look, Potter. I'm sorry, I didn't mean to-"
"Whatever are you talking about?" Draco asked him. Harry gave him a funny look. "You know," he slowly said as if Draco were stupid. "Hogsmeade. Tomorrow. Saturday. Together? Is any of this ringing a bell?" He asked facetiously.
Draco pulled on his robes, smoothing out the nonexistent wrinkles, and checked his reflection once more to be sure.
Draco tried not to think about it, he really did. Pushing all thoughts of Potter's abs far back in his head, he gave Pansy a stern look. "Yes, it really would be so bad. Imagine if he found out, I'd be the laughingstock of the entire school!"
Draco bowed his head. Regret crashed into him. He had done each and every one of those things. There was no chance of him walking free. The prosecution began, and he mindlessly answered questions about the war, his conversations with the Dark Lord, and his mission to kill Dumbledore. He spoke in a monotone voice, his brain had stopped functioning, and it was all he could do to give them the answers they sought. When the prosecutor was finished, he had a smug smile on his face as if he knew he had won. Draco knew it too. His case was hopeless. He would do any punishment they gave him willingly. It would be his penance, his apology to Dumbledore, and every student he had ever hurt. Because he knew he deserved it.
Harry was walking to class now, head throbbing in time with his footsteps. He was seriously considering skiving off classes and going back to sleep. He decided against it, desperately reminding himself of the benefits of going to class. Hermione would have been so proud.
"What could be so bad? You told me already how trivial a matter it is, so why can't you tell me? I won't judge or laugh at you," he pleaded. He begged no longer out of curiosity, but a desire to see whether Draco could be open and honest with him. It was the first test of their soon-to-be relationship — a small one, but an important one nonetheless.
The next morning, Harry woke up a bit later than they had agreed on, but he counted that as Draco's fault. He should've woken him up.
"I said, thank you!" Malfoy snapped. Then he turned to walk away. Harry was stunned. This was the second time in two days Malfoy had been polite to him. He wondered if the world was going to end, then decided that he hadn't defeated an evil mastermind only for the world to die just months later. Malfoy reached the end of the hallway and turned the corner, leaving Harry standing there alone.
He returned about twenty minutes later with a plate full of food. Harry was sitting on his bed with his knees pulled up to his chest. He was staring into space and didn't react when Draco came in. Draco sat next to Harry, then touched his shoulder to get his attention. He silently handed over the plate of food. Harry just stared at it blankly.
Harry stepped in straight away, loudly enunciating "Ministry of Magic." As he was whisked away, he heard Ron ask McGonagall to send Hermione too.
"What are you doing up, Mione? It's nearly four in the morning." Hermione gave him a sharp look. "I could ask the same, Harry. I was trying to run an experiment," she gestured at the papers and notebooks surrounding her, "but what's your excuse?" She asked him.
He didn't have to hesitate. He just pulled Harry into a tight hug. Tilting his head down to whisper in his ear, Draco told him softly, "Harry, the only one who should have to worry about this is me. I have nothing to lose and everything to gain. But for you, Harry, it's the opposite. No one will ever accept this; you will always face criticism for being with me. I will never stop wanting you, do not underestimate me in that. As long as you want me, I'll be here. I cannot comprehend how you could ever think this a good idea, but as long as you are experiencing this bout of insanity, I won't complain." He pulled back to gaze at Harry, eyes flickering between his astonishingly green ones. Harry rolled his eyes and smiled at Draco, and that was enough to take his breath away.
"One's Slytherin and the other's Gryffindor, of course," his wife continued. "But Rosie told us something funny the other day. Reminded me of some people I know, to be sure..."
Draco was not happy at this turn of events. But, he was not altogether surprised. How could he be, when he had tormented Potter for years now and had given the boy every reason to hate him? He would not hold a grudge against Potter for this, not when he so clearly deserved it. He was more disappointed that Potter would take their rivalry so far that he had to condemn his mother too. But they deserved it, so Draco understood.
In his kitchen, sitting with his best friends and husband, his crup snoozing under the table, and having finally spread the word of Sirius' innocence, Harry finally felt at peace. He had done it, at last.
Harry gave the tall blond an answering smile. He felt like a weight had been taken off his shoulders. Even though a promise, or at least a non-magical one, could easily be broken, Harry trusted Draco to be honorable, if nothing else.
Harry adopted a thoughtful expression. "Well, yes, but they're much more infrequent than they used to be. It's only every three of four days as opposed to nearly every night."
They walked in strained silence for a couple of seconds. Then, Parkinson said, "So what has Potter done this time?" Harry started at the use of his name and listened harder to see if he had done something to make Draco like this.
Draco snorted. "How can you blame yourself for that? You fought for your life. And really, Harry, you can't take the blame for everything. It's selfish." Harry sighed. "Whatever. My point is that this isn't your fault. There are so many people you can blame, but you were a victim, merely a pawn in Voldemort's game. You did what you could, sabotaging your own plans, and only doing what was necessary." Harry turned back to his book.
"You found Mr. Malfoy?" Headmistress McGonagall asked as soon as she was within earshot. Harry nodded fervently, wishing to get on with it as soon as possible. Draco was so close, and Harry had waited patiently for hours.
Harry woke up in a cold sweat, breathing hard. He sat up and buried his face into his hands, close to tears. He had never cried from a dream before, and this was the closest he would ever allow himself to get. If he cried, the nightmares would be given more power—the power to break him beyond repair.
Visualize your animagus form, the instructions read. Allow it to fill your mind until you think of nothing else.
Halloween was tomorrow, and the whole school was abuzz with preparation. Hagrid brought in over a dozen incredibly large pumpkins, which were carved using spells to depicts various scenes. The Great Hall was spectacularly decorated in orange and black, bats occasionally flying around. Peeves took great delight in becoming invisible and sneaking up behind students to whisper "boo" in their ears. And occasionally, when a student was walking alone, they swore they heard mysterious cackling and whispering. Thus, everyone had begun to travel as groups, which led to quite a lot of traffic in the corridors.
Harry flushed immediately and looked away. Draco gave a fake sigh of disappointment. "I think it would be in your favor to just tell me. Otherwise, I might think it's something worse than it is. Or better, depending on how you look at it." Draco warned him. Harry chewed on his lip. The other boy had a point, but also Harry would never admit that he had eavesdropped on him, then dreamt of kissing him, then almost actually kissed him...yeah, it was much better to let Draco believe whatever he could come up with. Harry shook his head, determinedly. Draco pouted, and Harry wanted to kiss him again because it was absolutely adorable. Thankfully he was already blushing. Merlin, he never thought he'd say that.
"But that's okay, because then I saw you! And I ran over and here I am." Past-Draco laughed delightedly. The worst part was, he has absolutely no ulterior motives to mentioning the incident. It would've been okay if he meant to stir sympathy. Maybe it was okay, though, especially with the way Harry was staring at him when he laughed.
After class, Harry hurriedly packed his things and rushed out of the room, barely stopping to wait for Ron and Hermione. Hermione gave him a delighted look. "Harry, I noticed you were taking notes today. I'm so happy you're finally taking an interest in your studies." She turned to Ron and gave him an appraising look. "Now, if only you would start paying attention. Honestly, Ronald, this stuff is important! You ought to listen to him; you never know when this stuff will come up again..."
Harry had the opposite philosophy, of course. He was just starting the eighteen-inch essay due the next day. They worked on their own, but occasionally Harry would throw out a question, and Draco would answer him succinctly. It was quite relaxing.
Draco was waiting just outside the doors, but Harry grabbed his wrist and pulled him further along a hallway. He glanced both directions, then pulled Draco into the closest empty classroom. He let go of his wrist, turning to face an impassive Draco. "What is it, Potter?" He asked coolly.
"There you are. I'd begun to think you were finally clever enough to outsmart our security, but evidently, I was wrong." Draco winced internally. His father was as sharp-tongued as ever, and just as quick to criticize Draco.
The next morning, Draco awoke feeling groggy and cranky. He snapped at Theo when he asked him if they wanted to go breakfast together and spent nearly an hour in the bathroom trying to make himself look decent. Draco had stopped using product, but that didn't mean he let his hair run wild either. He carefully brushed and combed his hair into sexy perfection, taking care to put every strand in its place. He was almost jealous of Potter, who pulled off his messy bird's nest far too well for it to be fair.
"We know, Draco. You've only told us about a million times." Blaise was clearly not aware of the depths of his hatred for Potter. If he had been, he would not be treating this so lightly.
"Okay, everyone," he said, all-business. "We're going to form a perimeter around the house - disillusionment charms are necessary since there's little cover. Smith, Johnson, Miller, come with me. We'll go in through the front. Harris, Murphy, you go around the back and see if there's another exit. Ivanov, Joseph, you stay outside and make sure the kidnapper doesn't escape. Professor, would you like to stay outside or come with us?"
Draco turned back to the conversation, smirking, only to see everyone staring at him. "What?" He asked.
"Didn't want to scare me off?" Harry asked bitingly, irritation bleeding through. Draco shook his head more emphatically. The boy was beginning to try his patience, which he did not have a lot of to begin with. "No, Harry, I-"
Draco was beginning to feel as if he'd gone stark, raving mad. And maybe he had, sitting in his flat for days on end without even the slightest bit of company. He couldn't reconcile the man before him with his father - it was like...well, like Potter. Draco couldn't see the man in the newspapers as the same boy who had refused his friendship and nearly killed him in Hogwarts. His eyes told him they were the same, but his mind insisted they were not.
Emotion welled up in Draco, and he tamped it down. He had not seen his father in months, not since his self-induced estrangement from him the last time they had talked. That had been a terrific fight, and the hardest one of his life, even considering the Battle of Hogwarts. They had both walked away furious, Draco's mother left as the hopeless intermediary between them.
"Why do you blush when I whisper your name?" He asked triumphantly. "Not that one," Harry refused immediately. "Anything but that."
Draco very nearly blushed, but his extensive control over his every bodily function prevented that, thank Merlin. He nodded, pretending like he was just another over-eager student who wanted to learn as much as they possibly could. Channeling his inner Granger, Draco straightened his already ramrod-straight back and said in an innocent voice, "Of course, professor, I would love to try something more complex. I think a task to challenge my focus would be very beneficial. Do you have any suggestions for me?"
"No, you may go," his father replied, sounding pleased, and Draco extricated himself from his mother, striding out into the corridor.
"I think I should know," Harry insisted. "So that I don't do it again by accident." Draco shook his head slightly, a hint of a scowl twisting his features. "No need. It's something I need to work on, not you."
Ron shook his head. "Just how much do you know about Malfoy's eating habits, Harry?" Harry looked between him and Hermione, confused. "Not much. He likes to eat eggs and toast for breakfast, with fruit and pumpkin juice. He usually eats some type of sandwich for lunch or soup. When he's mad, he picks at his food a lot. When he's smug or happy, he eats sweeter foods. When he's planning something, he eats more fruit and fewer grains. Really, I'm surprised that neither of you know this." They were gaping at him now.
A dragon? He did not tell me anything about becoming an animagus. Magical creature animagi do tend to run in our family with quite a bit more frequency than many other families. Still, I should have liked to know, and I long to see it. He would make a magnificent dragon, no? I thought so too when I named him for that particular constellation. I wish he had not stayed up quite so many nights, though if that is what saved him, I shall most assuredly not complain. Please do let me know the moment you see him, and I thank you once more for your consideration.
Harry was frozen. He didn't say anything, only blinked at Draco for a couple of seconds, then stared at the ground. Just when Draco thought he might have gone too far, Harry, gazing up at him from under his eyelashes, biting his lip, asked softly, "Do you truly mean that?"
After Pansy had ranted for a while about going off on his own, he finally cut her off. "Harry and I had a fight. I stunned him and took him to the Hospital Wing. We fell asleep for a while and talked, and now we're friends." He made to walk past her to his dorm, but she blocked him.
If he wanted to remain sane, he couldn't dwell on "what ifs" and "maybes." That was a short path to regret and insecurity that Harry had no intention of following. Any timeline that had him and Draco together was enough for Harry.
Draco rolled his eyes in annoyance. "Of course not. It would reflect badly on me as your potions partner if I let you turn in this monstrosity. Try again." Harry gave him a grateful smile and went back to work. It wasn't long before Harry started to get the hang of it. Now that he didn't have to be watching for mistakes so much, Draco was free to let his mind wander. He suddenly remembered something. Flirting.
"I...wanted to...er...ask you...about...about something," he said awkwardly. Draco just gave him a contemptuous look. Harry sighed in defeat.
This was much harder than Step 3, Draco found. It was incredibly difficult to imagine various parts of his body changing at the same time, in detail. He could do one or the other, but never both. He always focused too hard on one part, or couldn't quite visualize the intricate details. Draco needed to focus, to quell his excitement, and reach a state of detached determination.
Suddenly, a voice called, "Wait up, you two!" Trying to turn around without separating was difficult, and they nearly fell over, but they eventually managed and saw Pansy Parkinson striding over towards them.
"How about we go back to my dorm, darling? I'm sure I can convince Granger that she should do her work out in the common room. Millie will understand, and I know we can bully Abbott into leaving us alone for a while. What do you think?" Pansy offered. Blaise gave her an incredulous look. "Since when has Bulstrode been Millie?" He asked, and Draco found himself laughing at the ridiculousness of it.
"I thought I was being quiet. You didn't notice when I stepped on that branch earlier. Bloody forest." Harry grumbled. Draco rolled his eyes at him, like usual. "Yes, Harry, but there are quite a lot of things in this forest that could have stepped on that branch. There are far fewer things in here that are invisible. And only one that would risk coming so close to a wizard just to sit there and breathe." Harry resisted the urge to scowl at Draco. Sod him for being so logical.
Draco was surprised. Harry was brighter than he had ever guessed. In Granger's shadow, he had only ever appeared mediocre. Draco could only hope to find out the true depths of his wisdom someday.
Harry managed to reach the front of the group, Ron beside him. Ron groaned. "Bloody fantastic. I'm with Zabini and Macmillan. At least Neville will be there to keep me sane. And alive." Harry was too busy looking for his own name to listen to Ron. He scanned the list and finally spotted his name. Next to it was:
Draco had been watching him intently. "I did do something," he accused when he saw Harry's complicated expression. The guilty look that followed was enough to ensure Draco that he was correct. Draco groaned, letting his head fall back. "What did I do? Please tell me!" He begged Harry.
"What was that?" Harry asked, slightly annoyed. He was beginning to wonder why he had helped Malfoy.
Pansy was still fuming. She tapped her spiky, black heels on the floor impatiently. Draco sighed again.
"I...oh sod it. Fuck space." Harry couldn't wait a moment longer. His tipped forwards, and his lips crashed into Draco's, and suddenly Harry found himself kissing Draco Malfoy for the second time ever. Third, if you counted his dream.
Harry turned back to their friends, who were having one loud discussion about Hogsmeade and whether or not Honeydukes was planning to buy the store next door so they could expand. He smiled and listened quietly, content to sit there and let the conversation flow around him.
Magpies are said to predict the future; the number in which they appear is the variable that decides whether that fortune will be good or bad. One magpie is said to be a bad omen, while in any other number they are usually good.
Once out into the draft corridors, Harry activated the map, wondering where he should go. Almost immediately, he saw a familiar name and smiled, changing the direction of his feet onto a new course.
"Harry," came Hermione's reproachful voice. Harry jumped in surprise. He hadn't even noticed his friend in one of the armchairs by the fire. And with her hair, that was saying something about Harry's observational skills that he didn't like.
Harry was too agitated to be surprised at Malfoy's begging. "I'm sorry, Malfoy, but I can't. I hurt you, and you didn't do a thing to warrant it. I don't deserve your forgiveness."
The trio made their way to Honeydukes, where they stocked up on an assortment of goodies. Harry paid for all of them, assuring Ron that he could pay for their butterbeers later. Then they went up to the Shrieking Shack, where they stood silently, paying their respects to the Mauraders (though not Pettigrew.) After a while, when Harry no longer felt like crying, they made their way back down the hill and walked into the Three Broomsticks, ready to enjoy a nice, warm butterbeer. Ron ordered for them, giving him a chance to make eyes at Rosmerta without Hermione seeing. When he returned with their drinks, they sat chatting amiably and sipping the warm liquid.
"Would you please tell me what's bothering you?" He pleaded quietly. That green gaze flashed towards him before moving away again.
My beloved son, I hope you are doing well. You must be very busy if you cannot spare the time to send me a letter informing me of your well-being.
Next, add in 10 Werewolf hairs. It is vital you do not remain exposed to them for more than 5 seconds; otherwise you may be subject to aggressive feelings directed at the nearest individual. Effects may not surface for several hours. It is recommended you wait until the last possible minute to get this ingredient, as it will reduce the chances of accidental exposure. Let sit and boil for five minutes.
When Harry smiled, Draco cupped his face in his hand and leaned in. "You are beautiful," he said gravely. "But it doesn't matter what I think. You are the only one who can decide. All I can do for you is to tell you the facts. Like: you're fit as hell, your smile could charm a rock, and your eyes are uniquely amazing," he proclaimed.
Draco turned fully towards his mother and leaned down, hugging her tightly. He had done this goodbye every year since he was eleven, but now it felt different. It had been just him and his mother since their trial, and they had grown impossibly close. He felt like he would be leaving a part of himself behind when he boarded the train.
Harry stopped, and all his good intentions deserted him. Malfoy had a crush? And on a bloke? Was Malfoy- was he-? Harry couldn't bring himself to even think it. The perfect pureblood Slytherin prince, attracted to males? The possibility had never crossed Harry's mind. But now he wanted to know. Who did Malfoy have a crush on?
He pulled back, watching Harry intently. "Someday, you're going to tell me what it is with me whispering your name that makes you blush so magnificently." Right on cue, Harry's face reddened. The brunet shook his head. "Never," he insisted. Draco smirked. "Is that a challenge, Potter?"
"But my mark...it burned. It only burns when he..." Draco trailed off. Harry felt regret flood through him. "I'm sorry, that was my fault. I touched it, but I didn't think it would burn like that." Draco looked at him in shock.
He suddenly exploded, his back arching and toes curling, spraying the shower wall. He gasped, eyes fluttering open as he rode out the waves of pleasure, mind filled with grey eyes staring into his own.
Harry carefully stowed the vials of the silvery, incandescent substance in his trunk where he hoped no one would discover them. It had been difficult deciding what memories he was going to use, but he had finally gotten a combination with which he was happy. Now all that was left was-
Potter looked slightly remorseful. "Sorry, Malfoy, I forgot. But it's fine. I haven't touched them at all." He gave Draco a sheepish grin. Draco rolled his eyes at Potter's idiocy.
Potter and the Weasel walked further into the room. The ginger immediately made a beeline for the food, Granger heading over to intercept him. Potter just stood kind of close to Draco, making his heart start to beat faster. Draco looked at everything but Potter.
"Argh!" Draco yelped as he felt the block of ice wrap around his unfortunate appendage. He leveled a positively menacing glare at Harry, but the latter did not care one bit. Grumbling, Draco allowed Harry's hand to remain in his pocket and even held it tight so it would warm up faster. In such a manner, they awkwardly walked and occasionally stumbled through the village. They didn't have any destination in mind, but their teenage stomachs were leading them vaguely in the direction of Honeydukes.
