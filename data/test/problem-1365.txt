Oh, was it a ravishing sight seeing Draco Malfoy squirm in his place, clearly bashful of the stunt he just pulled. A part of Harry wanted to go and embrace him tightly, a part wanted to laugh in his face and another part.. Well, it's better left undiscovered.. for now. Malfoy's plan that consisted of making Harry's time at Hogwarts harder than it should be was completely botched because of his daftness.
"What was Harry bleeding Potter doing in your room, Draco?" asked Pansy, Blaise being to shut off to ask any questions.
As he was spacing out, he realised his gaze stopped right onto Draco Malfoy, the latter observing this fact quite late, because Harry rapidly averted his gaze towards his own hands, placed in his lap like they were made of glass. Draco felt as if someone was watching him, the feeling coming from Harry's area, but he just brushed it off seeing as his eyes were glued to his lap.
"Wha.. Who.. Who is Jesus Christ? Are you running a fever, mate?"
"Okay, Draco, calm down, this is just.. just because you have sensitive ears, yes. Harry Potter did not, and I repeat, did not make you feel tingly." whispered the blonde to himself quietly, arriving in his room.
After the ceremony, everybody started eating, while Harry left the dinning hall, feeling as if he was suffocating. He just couldn't stay there anymore, so he got up, without telling his mates where he was going, and he went outside, sitting on a bench near a tree, inhaling and exhaling rapidly. Just as it was getting serene, he noticed someone else was with him, just behind the tree.. Crying?
"You plonker-"
The girl sighed. She has been doing this quite often, seeing as she was the only person who could stand and understand Draco. Pansy started playing with his hair in a motherly like nature, smiling to herself, the boy's muttering calming her. Just as she was about to speak up, a slender figures appears in her point of view, Draco not noticing their presence, too busy crying on the inside. The "party-popper" was scratching the back of his head, visibly anxious, trying to form a sentence.
The boy with glasses blinked, confused as to what just happened, and couldn't help but laugh at the way Malfoy ran away from him. He felt a bit bad for laughing at his actions, but he couldn't help it. Oh, was this year going to be.. Something else.
acquaintances! I regret everything that I've did to you.. But you also have been tormenting me since the first day!"
'Oh' was what the both of them thought, shocked.
"A week? It feels like a century.." said the blonde boy, drifting off to whatever lovey-dovey daydream he was displaying in his head, while laying on her lap.
❝ɪ'ᴅ ᴄʀᴀᴡʟ ᴀ ᴍɪʟᴇ ɪɴ ᴀ ᴅᴇꜱᴏʟᴀᴛᴇ ᴘʟᴀᴄᴇ ᴡɪᴛʜ ᴛʜᴇ ꜱɴᴀᴋᴇꜱ, ᴊᴜꜱᴛ ꜰᴏʀ ʏᴏᴜ❞
The platinum boy just nodded sheepishly, not wanting to elucidate his embarrassing encounter with the boy he had been fancying since the first time he saw him.
"You're such a fucking annoyance sometimes, with your oblivious arse." said Blaise, knocking some food in front of the blonde male, who seemed to have forgotten all about eating since the subject of their conversation was Potter.
“Fuck, you’re so tight, babe.”
Harry turned to the fireplace and to the cursebreaker whom Bill considered the very best in the whole of England.
Draco then began babbling about work as Harry’s hands drifted up and down his calves on his left side, complaining about the work-load they both received from Kingsley right before the Holidays.
“As much as I am enjoying your clear bewilderment of my gramophone, I think you’d best get back to work so we can be done with this sooner rather than later.”
Malfoy snorted.
Potter blinked, seemingly coming back to the present. And snorted.
Harry just figured pub night was a ploy of Ron to get him to take his earbuds out for longer than half an hour and actually interact with society.
"There is no changing some people or things when it comes to old magic. Maybe you should concentrate your energy on something else. I would hurry you, but I'm getting paid for my time and watching you get flustered is turning out to be much more entertaining than Zabini's party promised."
"Do you fancy him?"
“Ah, right.”
Harry’s toes curled at the image that brought into his head, and bit his bottom lip until he tasted blood at the feeling of Malfoy pressing his cock inside him,
Potter was attempting to thrust up into the feeling again, moaning low in his throat, and Draco almost wanted to see him come like this.
"Are you bloody insane, Potter? What are you-"
"What- What do you mean what? Are you going to keep me glued to the pillar all day?"
"Mate, mate, wait up! You didn't answer any of my questions, this isn't fair!"
He cursed himself for having a voice crack. He really didn't know how to communicate, huh?
He gruffly got up, his eyes widening instantly at the other's presence. Draco quickly got onto his feet, dabbing away all the dust, while also fixing his hair. He was trying to find a position in which to seat, sighing, realizing he had just made a fool of himself again.
"He's not humiliating me, Ron! Did you forget that he has always failed in bullying me, huh? Why do you think is that?"
"Prat." huffed out Draco, bringing his hands to his chest in a defensive way, something he did whenever he felt especially ashamed in that specific moment.
"I'm sorry, alright! Now can we-"
Draco just shook his head in disagreement, muttering something about 'bleeding Potter, always causing trouble', getting back to his potion. After a few minutes, he noticed the room was getting hotter by the minute, all the cauldrons being used and the potions nearly done. He skimmed his eyes across the room, seeing Harry take off his robe and roll up his sleeves, puffing out, clearly feeling the hotness of the room too. But oh, was that a bad move. The platinum blonde bloke stared, a rosy brush creeping up onto his cheeks, causing him to clear his throat quite loudly, earning him a few confused stares. And also Potter's attention. They seemed to just stare at each other for a while, Draco's eyes shifting up and down constantly at the other's arms, the brown haired boy noticing his slippery attitude, glancing down at.. his hands? Harry looked curiously at his hands, Draco cursing himself for getting caught, and turned his gaze away.
"Can you get Hermione to come? I think I-"
When he got to the hospital wing, the tenderhearted woman was sitting at her desk, yawning loudly, champing her mouth tiredly. He felt kind of bad for bothering the woman this early in the morning, but his head kept on getting worse; it was dreadful, really.
It was a good question. Really; what was that? He should've known better and perceive the fact that he was in Potions class for Merlin's sake, of course it was a love potion that made the whole room smell like Harry (for him). "I really don't know, I was trying-"
She heard about what happened last night in the chambers, but she didn't really think much of it. By the time she heard about everything, the whole school found out that Harry Potter, The Boy Who Lived, was getting freaky with somebody in the Gryffindor dorm.
Once Harry starts talking, he just never stops. His voice was trembling with anger, pupils dilatating constantly, his arms shaking against his sides. Draco was completely bewildered by this situation, his eyes darting to every part of Harry's face and arms.
"Oh, no, 'mione, we aren't going there-" started Ron, a look of fear washing over his eyes.
"Bloody hell, what's wrong with you today Harry?" murmurs the boy, looking worriedly, but also confused as the culprit who disturbed the class.
It seems that somebody was listening, since a coughing noise was heard right after Draco finished his sentence. Everybody turns towards the spot where the sound was coming from, seeing Harry choke on literal air, while Ron tries to pat his back, panicked.
"Silence you three!"
"It's quite obvious, isn't it?"
Instantly, with shaky breaths, the blonde male pushed the other off him, Harry stumbling back, completely disoriented by everything that just happened. "Don't you ever come near me again, Potter!" yelled Draco, tripping over literal air, dashing towards the Slytherin common room, leaving Harry to process the entirety of the passed moment.
"-The Astronomy Tower, yes, I know, you've been wailing like this for a week!" groaned the brown haired girl, sitting down next to her friend.
i dont know if i should write more mature things or just leave them out? even though i want to idk i think im tired from all the writing hahaha
"He came back to the dinning hall grinning.. I don't know why, I thought you two made up, what happened actually?" asked the girl, trying to gather Draco's attention.
"Well, if you would just listen to me and my advices, you wouldn't be in so much pain!" spoke the girl under her breath, through gritted teeth. "Really, 'Ray, I feel like a porcelain doll, sitting around, waiting for you to want to 'play' with me."
Draco stood proudly in his door, eyeing him up and down, after a while he sighed and let Harry come into his room, feeling a bit ashamed after the incident that happened today.. And oh sweet Merlin, Harry Potter stepped into his room!
"Ooh, was the lover boy watching your arse? How about you turn around so he can see it better?"
"Oh, for fuck's sake- What's the- Merlin's sake, fine.."
The boy with glasses rolled his eyes, sitting next to Fred and George, who were exchanging knowing looks, but not saying anything.
The other boy nodded, not wanting to question him any longer and watched as Harry made his way towards the exit of the common room.
"You think?" asked the chosen boy, making both of them stifle out a laugh.
"You're not helping, Harry! Dear Merlin, this wasn't supposed to happen! I think I added too much liquid.." exclaimed Neville, pacing around the room breathlessly.
Technically, yes. Draco's stomach has been going up and down with how many emotions he has been feeling in the past 5 minutes, but he couldn't just give himself away, oh, Merlin, no. If he did.. No, he shouldn't.
Harry stepped back, earning a low whine from the boy. "What's the magical word?" asked the brown haired boy, smirking.
"Shit.." whispered Draco to himself, realising that he didn't get to hide his, uh, stuff.
im sorry i havent posted in a while, i havent been feeling it these past few weeks and it has been harder writing for me than it has ever been :(
The talking person stopped abruptly, freezing upon further notice of the two bodies who were heavily making out. Both of the boys' eyes widened, Harry trying to hide the mop of blond hair, not wanting to reveal the figure to anybody, afraid he might disperse. Everything went silent for a few moments, even the clock on the wall decided it was better to just stop ticking.
They never looked at each other again. In that class, at least; Draco Malfoy wasn't going to expect this.
"I mean, are you bloody mental, Harry? What is it to you? Are you a masochist? Do you enjoy him literally humiliating you every chance he gets?"
The consequences might be.. deadly exhilarating. Pain and pleasure, paper and quill; you can't have one of these things without the other. A palpable sense of fear washed over Draco's thoughts, making him stop thrusting against Harry for a second, his lips hanging loosely in the air. His lips were getting cold just like the blood in his veins.
"Harry bleeding Potter, you're driving me nuts."
The golden boy decided to advance to his seat, plonking next to Hermione, who has an eyebrow raised, muddled.
Harry smiled bashfully, kissing Draco fiercely, while the other fumbled with his buttons. In the heat of the moment, while they were roaming their hands around every piece of skin they could get their fingertips on, they didn't notice the room door open, amused voices being heard all throughout the Chamber.
"Look.. I don't care if you suddenly realized that you like blokes, let's get this straight, alright, mate?" started the boy, clasping his hands together. "But.." continued, his face changing 5 expressions in a blink of a second, "Why him, Harry? He despises people like me and Hermione."
Blaise's eyes softened and he hugged the other tightly, comfortingly, knowing damn well how much Draco not only cared about what Potter thought of him, but about Potter in general. Draco just melted into his touch, feeling the need of affection after overthinking for the whole day. They sat in a comfortable silence for a few, the silence being disrupted by another being entering the room, both of the males knowing who made their appearance after a while.
Potter didn't hesitate one bit in fulfilling Malfoy's request, his hands tightening slowly around his neck. Draco's grip on Harry's tie loosened and he let a small mewl get past his rosy lips, his eyes shut tight. This was all new for the boys. For the both of them it was like venturing blindly into a stormy sea, while galloping carelessly with their feet into the ashy sand. But it didn't matter that they were getting dirty and risking everything they got, all that it mattered was who they were getting dirty with.
"I think this is our cue to leave."
"Let's make one then! Move, move!" yelled Ron, pushing everyone out of the room, cursing himself for replaying the scene he just witnessed in his head.
Harry just nodded, not interested in the new students at all. Really. He felt as if he didn't belong there. Well, he fought in a war and all and he has nowhere to go except the Weasleys' house, but he felt as if he was intruding. Hogwarts was not home. So what was he supposed to do? The brown haired boy sighed loudly, gathering the attention of his two friends, and Neville who just arrived, with worried looks in their eyes.
"I don't want to hear any words coming from your filthy goddamn mouth, Potter. If you don't know, I have classes right now so let me-" the blonde was cut off.
Soon enough, Draco was getting impatient and started squirming, making Harry snap.
Harry was eyeing the marvelous piece of art in front of him, a tad frightened, but also intrigued to continue. Draco got closer to his face, his orbs going up and down, from his eyes to his lips, frantically.
hello, hello, as you can see, i'm not dead!! applause!! ok, but fr, i had a tough week and all i wanted was to curl up and die in a ditch sooo, yeah
Draco's cheeks heated up rather instantly, his mouth opening and closing, trying to come back with a snarky remark about his nails digging into his skin, but oh, was he in Heaven. His infatuation with the boy wasn't for nothing. It wasn't unrequited. So, in conclusion, his reaction was a strong 'mmhmm', his throat slightly vibrating against the other's touch. Harry scoffed, seemingly not believing the reaction he got, and threw himself at the blonde boy, kissing every part of him enthusiastically. He was layering his kisses, from time to time biting the pale skin, earning a few whines in protest.
Oh, was Malfoy screwed. He couldn't believe the fact that he let himself get caught crying, by Harry Potter. Harry bleeding Potter. It wasn't his brightest moment, that's true, but he couldn't help but day dream about Potter, even after the incident.
"I already know that, he found me crying." said Draco, ashamed, while looking at his pillow that was grasped tightly by his hands. "I chickened and ran away." continued the male, a big sigh leaving his lips.
Blaise rolled his eyes, tugging at his arm like a rat, making Draco groan again, but louder, turning around to send him a death glare.
Harry got up, trying to see who the owner of the crying was, only to be met by two grey, cold, brimmed with tears eyes, who were possessed by none other than Draco Malfoy. The slytherin's face showed a lot of emotions in that moment, dread, sadness, but at the end, all he got to see was trepidation, as the blonde scurried away rather elegantly.
The boy didn't get to finish his sentence, as the plant in front of him just.. Exploded. Was that supposed to happen? Harry's eyes widened at the sight, and he bursted out laughing for the 10th time in the last hour he has spent with Neville.
"Harry? Harry? Haaaarrrryyy?"
"What do you mean you had no choice? You had one! Be on our side!"
The boys knew that they should probably sneak themselves out of the Gryffindor common room, but they couldn't help stealing a few kisses from each other, while leaving dark marks on their bodies, even though Draco was still adamant about not tainting his pale, clean skin with bruises. He liked them even though he never showed it.
Oh, how he wished he could just cup those pretty little cheeks of his and kiss his lips, and oh- Harry appeared to wait for a response from Draco, who was lost in his fantasies like a sailor in the night. Draco licked his lips slowly, trying to think of a reaction, of something, but it was hard to have anything in your head other than Potter's mesmerizing array. So he just cocked his head up, in a way to greet him, earning him a gleaming grin from ear to ear, Harry waving with his.. good looking hands.
"I just think it would be good if we.. Talked?"
The slytherin was lying in his bed, like a dead body, while thinking about everything and nothing at the same time. He suddenly heard a knock at the door, and he just yelled a 'Not now Pansy!' thinking it was just Pansy trying to get him to eat something. The knocking continued, making him groan annoyed, while getting up, not even bothering to check how he's looking.
"Potter? Got anything to say for yourself-"
Harry nodded, watching Ron wrap his arm around Hermione, the both of them leaving. Hermione looked back, a little dejected, waved and then turned around to kiss the ginger's cheek. The boy let out a breath he didn't know he was holding and he just stared at the food in front of him, not knowing what to do. He should just go back to ignoring Malfoy, maybe the both of them will never talk again and he would just focus on being an Auror and hang out with Hermione and Ron.. He was still skeptical about Draco's intentions, even after he basically went to his dorm and tried to form a friendship with him. It must be his younger self not being used to him talking and thinking about Malfoy in such a way. It was tiring him this situation, so he decided to just ignore the male after all.
"Excuse us, Professor." replied almost instantly Pansy, batting her eyelashes innocently, the man turning around still skeptical about them.
"I also wanted to talk to you since there seems to be a.. Lot of tension between us."
❝ᴅᴏ ʏᴏᴜ ꜱᴇᴇ ᴀɴʏᴏɴᴇ ᴏᴛʜᴇʀ ᴛʜᴀɴ ᴍᴇ? ʙᴀʙʏ, ᴘʟᴇᴀꜱᴇ❞
"Why is he dangerous? Voldemort is dead and, besides, he cried in front of me, twice already!" shouted the boy, his mouth closing suddenly, realizing what mess he just got himself into.
Heartbeat increasing. Breath hitching. Is this how Heaven tastes like? What is Heaven even? Blissful ignorance? Spoiled truth? What was the jeopardized boy supposed to believe in? His gut, that told him to erase everything from the past and focus on the future? Or his cerebrum, who seemed to bring his wit out, not convinced at all by the small confession?
❝ꜰᴀʟʟ ᴛᴏ ᴍʏ ᴋɴᴇᴇꜱ❞
They both waited in anticipation for something to happen, and just when Neville started thinking that it would blow up again, the plant started growing into a beautiful, pink, tree with flowers. The tree wasn't that big, it was like a baby tree, but it held a ton of pretty blossoms.
"What am I even thinking..?" whispered the blondie, pinching his skin heavily, trying to remind himself that his paranoid thoughts didn't define reality.
At that point, the boy who lived got up from his seat, facing the red head eye to eye, almost angrily, but you could see that he did not want to fight with his friend. He never intended to. He wasn't even sure for the things he was feeling for Merlin's sake!
❝ᴏʜ, ɪ'ᴍ ᴀɴ ᴀɴɪᴍᴀʟ, ʜᴀɴᴅ ᴍᴇ ᴀ ᴛʀᴀᴍᴀᴅᴏʟ, ɢɪᴍᴍᴇ ᴛʜᴇ ᴊᴜɪᴄᴇ❞
It's not the first time Draco thought that Harry should just wrap his hands around his neck, and certainly not the last.
"We aren't teenagers anymore.. Are you sure we should be doing.. this? Whatever this absurdity is." said the blonde male, sitting on his bum, worriedly picking at his nails.
In the next moment, Harry was sprinting towards Draco, making him step back a bit, only to get his arm taken in between his fingers firmly, his back pressed on the pillar of Harry's bed. The blonde's head hit the pillar, quite roughly, making him wince in pain.
The platinum haired boy scoffed, his eyes piercing through Harry's soul. Even though he liked the fellow, he couldn't just get over everything.
"Matter of factly," started Fred talking, who appeared out of nowhere by his side, "While you were busy bitching and moaning about Harry not acting like himself," continued George, sitting in between the two lovers, "We investigated the occurence and we found out.."
"Harry.."
"It's the truth, Ron. Plus, Harry isn't even sure if he actually likes him, it might only be a physical attraction, seeing as, let's be honest, he wasn't the most experimental bloke in our school, now, was he, Ron?"
❝ɪ ᴅᴏɴ'ᴛ ʟɪᴋᴇ ᴀɴʏᴏɴᴇ ʙᴇᴛᴛᴇʀ ᴛʜᴀɴ ʏᴏᴜ, ɪᴛ'ꜱ ᴛʀᴜᴇ❞
No, he was.. What's that look in his eyes?
"This is the thing: you hid that person like your life depended on it, so they were more than a nobody! I'm not a twat!" continued the red haired boy, slapping his hands onto the table next to Hermione, who just sighed.
"Tighten your fist." said the male, in between the kisses.
"Why don't you tell me, huh?" bit back the simple boy, his chest rising up in a defensive manner.
"O-Of course I was picking on you! I knew it was Amortentia, obviously, I'm not a dimwitted bloke, unlike you who clearly didn't get the joke." stuttered the blondie, trying not to look into his eyes, afraid of his attitude shattering, it was already spilling all on the floor, along with Draco's facade.
Draco could only laugh at himself bitterly, his fingers making their way to his head, pulling at his hair severely. In the cold, dim-lit room, the only sound heard was the boy sobbing loudly, his shoulders shaking sharply. He felt hopeless because of a dumb, young admiration he used to hold for the golden boy when he first met him. In the first year, he watched him secretly, desperately hoping he would come to him and suggest to be his friend. In second year, his admiration turned into pure hatred for the boy who lived. Draco felt as if he could vanish castles in his way whenever he heard his voice and saw his face. In the third year? He started questioning his hatred, his stomach making flips and turns whenever Potter was around. The rest of his years were spent fantasizing with an aching, pounding heart. It was extremely hard for the boy to just get a rest from his anguished thoughts, especially when his parents proudly announced to him that he would have to become a Death Eater. He no longer could feel the surging happiness other people felt whenever they got a good grade. He no longer felt close to his parents. The pain he felt was suffocating him second by second, and his time was running out.
"Not even with Ginny."
"Whaa- Ahem, what do you want, Potter?"
The two slytherins rolled their eyes, Pansy letting go of the male, smirking to herself. "Well, let's finish our potion, shall we?" When Draco heard the question, he wanted to laugh at her and himself at the same time. "What? You don't want to smell it in your.. free time?" laughed the girl, wiggling her eyebrows, with a significant meaning.
"May we know why you just stared at the whole room all expectantly like you were looking for somebody?" asked the girl, while rolling her eyes at her boyfriend who just kept on eating and eating and eating. "For Merlin's sake, Ron, do you ever stop eating?"
"Well, Potter left the room shortly after you did-"
"This.. Is what you have been trying to make?" asked Harry, not knowing if he should be amazed or disappointed.
"What are you standing there for? Come on now, go to your partner." said the professor, interrupting the boys' wild thoughts, making both of them jump slightly.
A lie. He never told them how he wanted to peace it out with the said boy, because he knew how they would react. Why did he even try in the first place? He should just.. Oh, he's looking his way! The boy with the glasses observed Malfoy's body language (entirely for research reasons, of course), expectantly, Draco greeting him with a head bounce. Harry smiled, waving friendly.
"Pansy, I swear to Merlin that if you say another word about Potter I will shove your head in the toilet, in the bathroom where Moaning Myrtle is at." sneered the male, brewing the potion, not being in the mood of Pansy's teasing.
"You were doing something! Staring at bloody Malfoy with those doe eyes!"
Hermione slapped the book in her hands over the table, dragging Ron with her, angry muttering something about 'being the only one who has brains, for Merlin's sake'.
"Morning, Madame Pomfrey, I was wondering if you can help me with this annoying migraine, it's killing me." said Harry, cheesed off.
Hermione looked at him firmly, only then to burst into a fit of giggles, kissing the top of his head lovingly. The ginger head smiled brightly, reaching out for her head, placing a strand of hair behind her ear, only to then take her hand and kiss it, making sure to look up at her fondly. The brown haired girl blushed. Harry only managed to gag loudly, making a disgusted face while muttering 'gross' under his breath.
The blondie groaned, throwing himself on his bed, in the Slytherin common room. He shared the room with Blaise, somehow, even though his father was not around anymore to arrange where he would stay.
With accelerated footsteps and heavy breaths, the blonde male entered the classroom, an apologetic expression drawn on his face. Soon, that expression changed into confusion as he sniffed the area, realizing it smelt quite.. odd. "Why does the room smell like Potter? Are we brewing a potion to make us smell like total git?" asked Draco in a mocking tone, laughing loudly.
Hermione only sighed, bringing a hand to her forehead, watching Ron freak out over the fact that their best friend somehow was.. attracted? No, better said charmed by their enemy.
The brown haired boy raised his hand and gave the blonde the flowers, Draco accepting them a little bit jumbled. Harry really didn't know what to say anymore, so he thought that maybe.. maybe, some flower will do the trick for him. Oh, if it would be that easy. In that exact bit, Draco threw the flowers onto the ground, stepping on them without mercy.
Harry looked down at his feet, seemingly dejected of the situation at hand, and made his way towards the door with a sorrowful expression on his face. On his beautiful face.
The slytherin went to wash his face, running a hand through his hair who was tormented a few moments ago. Draco watched himself in the mirror, not recognizing the person looking back at him at all. He felt like a stranger. An odd, atypical figure watched him back, making him scoff, punching the mirror angrily. He eyed the broken frames on the ground, stepping on them, only to leave the restroom, his knuckles red and bloodied.
"You used sectumsempra on me! Bloody sectumsempra!"
"What? I wasn't doing anything!"
Ron was leaning in, all ears, to all appearances intrigued as hell. "That Harry developed a little 'crush' for none other than.. Draco Malfoy!" cheered the twins, bumping their elbows into the chosen one's sides, making him jump, alarmed.
"What, George?"
Harry turned around confused at the boy, raising a brow at him. Draco waved him off, motioning for him to continue walking.
"Mate, you missed the whole ceremony, especially the part where Ha- Why do you look like shit?"
Both, guarded up, slytherins turned to the male, cocking their eyebrows up in hesitancy. "What? It's a muggle joke! Oh, sweet Merlin, you guys are no fun."
He sighed relieved that nobody was in the common room, letting himself fall down onto the floor, completely baffled. He did not just make a fool out of himself twice this day, all because of bleeding Potter.  "Potter, Potter and Potter, will I ever be able to let go of this arsehole?"
Draco couldn't believe his ears. Did he really not know? "You make it sound so easy! I wish it was that easy to just decline Voldemort's request, oh, enlighten me golden boy!"
"What?"
Harry pretended to think for a bit, making the slytherin huff in annoyance. "Maybe. Why?"
The Slytherin went next to Pansy, who had an unreadable expression on her face. Once she observed that the professor was no longer paying attention to Draco, she pulled on his tie forcefully, bringing his face closer to hers. "What was that, Malfoy?" asked the girl, articulating every word fiercely, nearly biting the tip of his nose off.
"Oi, where have you been, mate?" asked Ron, patting Harry's back friendly.
The slytherin shut the door, his eyes going back to the flowers he stepped on, feeling bad for them, but also for Potter; it was for the best, he kept on telling himself, but he knew that maybe if his language wasn't so spiteful, the outcome of Harry's arrival would've been different. So, he did what anybody else in his position would do: he threw himself on the bed, and right in that moment, Pansy and Blaise stormed in, pure irritation written on their faces.
The boy wanted to reply with a snarky remark, only to remain gawping at the enchanting, sapped, blonde male. He watched as he went to his friends, their eyes meeting for a split second, only for the other to move their gaze towards the Slytherin table.
The next day, Harry arrived at the dining hall later than usual, a distraught Ron following behind his steps, gesturing with his hands like a mad man.
"He's looking this way! Look, look! Draco Lucius Malfoy, look at him!" nudged the girl in a thrilled voice to the other, trying to get him to just make a move.
"I should've done this sooner, so I would've got to see this blissful face you're making quicker." said the boy who lived, a wide grin painting his face.
"You are incredibly correct. Lovely day."
"We should've locked the door." said Draco after a while, playing with Harry's hair.
Draco scoffed, making his way towards the door, opening it fast and wide, so that Potter will leave before he started crying. He was such a cry baby, nobody would think that Draco Malfoy cries himself to sleep every night, nightmares clouding his thoughts and every part of his body. He shook his head at the concept, trying to get the golden boy to leave before it was too late.
They both signaled for him to continue. "..neat." They sighed, frustrated.
"Not cool, dude, not cool."
His grey orbs eyed the boy who seemed to always occupy his head, seeing him look eerie perturbed. Harry has been peering over his shoulder ever since Draco took a seat at his usual place, shockingly concerned and anxious about the other's arrival. The Slytherin has been wishing for Potter to look at him like that. He wanted him to worry about him, to just inhabit his skull, almost hauntingly. Is this why Draco chose not to heal himself? He was seeking his attention, in any way that he can, it was pitiful, really.
"Whatever it is, figure it out, because Malfoy is dangerous, no matter which way you put it-"
When they arrived in the dining hall, where the opening was being held, Draco went straight to his usual place at the Slytherin table, sitting right next to Pansy who smiled warmly. This action made Draco smile back, and his day a little brighter.
Harry has no doubt they might be forced to Apparate to safety more than a few times in the process, so having Apparition points to return to will be critical. Otherwise they risk

Hermione keeps giving him Looks and Ron’s starting to look kind of constipated whenever he looks at Harry now—well, when Harry’s thinking about Malfoy at least, but that sort of is all the time so...
She hasn't said that to Draco, though. She has no doubt he'd get angry if she did.
“Marry me?” Harry murmurs, stepping fully into Draco’s line of vision.
She's heard the descriptions, and she's certain he's most handsome! She's seen some paintings and depictions of him, and if it wasn't so silly, she'd fancy herself in love with him.
Depression? Draco doesn't have depression. That's absurd.
Ron scrunched his nose up. "Well, Ginny'll be disappointed." He shrugs his shoulders.
"Draco! Draco, Draco, Draco..." The God of the Sun murmurs the name as if he were reciting a prayer, holding Draco as close to him as he possibly could.

It will be fun to hold the fact that Draco probably saved his life over his head forever though. No less than he deserves, really.
If she'd at least taught them properly, it would have made her seem more… what's the word? Trustworthy, that's it.
Draco lets out a small noise and wrinkles his nose in his sleep.
Harry would probably call that cowardly and think it’s more important for them to stand their ground and face everyone head on, but Draco would consider it a strategic retreat. Isn’t it much better to let everyone get over their first rush of anger and disbelief before you have to deal with them?
To be reminded of it constantly, through the lack of colour around him, is dreadful.
Draco continues to plan the wedding he won't live long enough to have. They set the date for July 3rd, just between their respective birthdays, and Draco's diagnosis says he won't live past the middle of May. But he continues to plan, continues to rope Harry into making decisions regarding their wedding, and continues to make the traditional scrapbook containing all the details. It's something his family has done for centuries, and though he won't live to see it realised, he still wants this connection to his family line. Still wants to leave this as a legacy, as his ancestors before him. Something he will never pass down to the children he'll never have.
He can hope, can't he?
"Muh... Muh... Mah.." He struggles with the word, his tongue feels as heavy and leaden as the other times he's tried to speak a new word, say a name he has not already struggled through.
Draco must have misheard him. He cannot possibly have said that he asked Draco’s
"Gimme your name and take a seat again, and I'll go ask the boss."
Harry doesn’t think he’s ever been happier about his Seeker reflexes in his life. He had promised he wouldn’t ever use this mirror, but it’s his only choice now. Because if Malfoy is telling the truth...
he? He’s probably here to make sure that Harry doesn’t make it to the Ministry in time to save Sirius. Maybe Harry should just hex the bastard and keep going.
Nausea climbs up his throat. Potter’s going to twist everyone against him, make everyone turn against him. Maybe that’s… that was the plan all along? Maybe it was all about turning everyone in Draco’s life against him?
what that means: Draco can’t go on for much longer.
He feels too tired to get out of bed, his limbs sluggish and aching... So heavy he can barely bear to lift them at all. He barely even rolls over in bed, and rather than going to the bathroom, he just casts a few spells usually used for coma patients to deal with it.
Last Harry said, he was still living with Weasley and Granger and he hasn’t mentioned any renovation plans of Grimmauld Place at all. This must be a mistake, Draco must be misunderstanding something.
"So, the attacker was a potions master then?" Aunt Andromeda asks, leaning forward in her chair.

Absolutely
He can hear Draco muttering to himself, so he's clearly working as fast as he can, but Harry still wants him to work faster. Still wishes that things went way quicker than they are. He's afraid. Even more so for Draco than for himself.
“What makes you say that, Neville?” Hermione says. “Not that I would put it past him, but is there a specific reason you say that?”
“Harry!” Draco’s gasping moan is like a shower of ice-cold water along Harry’s spine. He
“Your
Harry feels on edge, nervous beyond belief. Even though Draco has sworn up and down that his parents locked the Manor up and warded against intruders, when they hid themselves away after choosing not to rejoin Voldemort, Harry still can't help but fear that the Death Eaters have somehow gotten inside. They could be lying in wait, ready to catch them off-guard.
Forcing down the sudden re-emergence of an urge to cry, Draco finally enters the Villa as the large doors open up for him.
He can only hope it’s not some sort of temporary thing. That his father was only safe from Azkaban as long as Draco himself was in… Well, the state he was in. Though he doesn’t understand why the Wizengamot would have cared about that at all.
“Now?!” Harry’s eyes are huge.

does what he does. Understanding someone else seems infinitely more complicated and difficult.
Harry stares at him for a long time, trying to parse what the hell Draco just said, before he realizes that Draco's right. If the diary was a Horcrux—and Harry is sure that it was— then the Basilisk venom was what destroyed it. After all, Harry used the fang of the dead Basilisk to pierce the diary and that was when the ghost of Tom Riddle disappeared.
He’s kept this whole thing secret from his friends and now they don’t know and he needs their support but he… He doesn’t want to admit what’s happened. It’s just too embarrassing to admit that he was tricked by Harry Bloody Potter of all people. That he was the side-piece. That he was stupid enough to keep it secret because he thought it sounded logical at the time…
"How... how can you find hope in such a story?" he asked after she finished. "The God of the Sun lost his beloved, and the God of the Stars lost
If he can just put enough distance between them and him and Draco, then he can Side-Along Draco to somewhere safe.
“What? So?” Harry doesn’t give a shit about Malfoy and his pureblood lineage.
the stupid posh arsehole Malfoy has always been peeking out again, hurling insults at Ron as always. If Harry had thought for even a second that maybe Malfoy was actually out to help them, here’s the solid proof he was delusional to even consider it.
Draco’s aware that these people have no idea how much he’s been helping them over the past months, but he still finds it quite annoying how they don’t trust a word out of his mouth. Though perhaps that is his own fault all things considered.
He hates it when Harry has to leave, hates that Harry can’t stay because no one knows about them. As much as he loves their cosy evenings together, he hates that they have to end. Hates that Harry can’t stay the night… or that Draco can’t stay the night in Harry’s apartment.
that potion the healer gave him?
Why would Potter even be glad to see Draco in the first place? And to have it confirmed that they
Draco whips around so quickly Harry's almost certain that it's magic. No human has reflexes like that, surely.
Something shoots past them, Harry hears his friends scream, and something hits him in the back. His head spins, he staggers, and then he’s yanked to the side. He slams into a wall, his head cracking against it harshly—making the spinning and disorientation even worse.
what is happening…
“So, what do we do now?” Draco says and looks at Harry. They're eating a quick meal from one of the Manor's pantries, and Draco has stuffed some more food that will keep in Hermione's bag. At least Hermione didn't take that with her.
Well, it seems farther away than it ever has before.
Of course, the assailant hadn’t known about the automatic ledgers, so he probably thought that he was home free with nothing to trace him back to what had happened at all.
He was the side-piece.
They might be able to take them out one by one.

Malfoy just quirks an eyebrow and gives Harry the most condescending look he's ever seen in his life.
It becomes background noise to the point that he stops even hearing it, and instead starts to slowly fall back asleep. There's no real reason for why he's so tired today, but he gets these spells occasionally.

The Herders yell among each other, so it's hard for Harry to hear exactly what they're saying. But soon four of them rush out of the building, leaving only a single person behind by the crystal.
Well,
Still, things don’t improve much from there. Draco continues to work on the wedding, and together with Harry, he puts the finishing touches on the planning—the only thing that hasn’t been done is
They snuck around the building, they placed some bits and bobs around outside on nearby buildings. And then Harry turned them into bombs that he'll set up when the time is right. They've made sure that the bombs are far enough from the building that they won't affect the walls. They don't want to risk blowing up a hole in a wall and allow the Inferi to swarm inside.
"So if we get rid of the crystal, they should stop being infectious then? Regular Inferi aren't infectious, they don't spread their state to other people, so that must be the crystal too." Harry wishes he didn't know as much about Inferi as he does, but there's nothing he can do about it.

Someone will interrupt his walk and take him to... He thinks it's the dining hall. But it looks so different from what it once was. The furniture is different, the rugs, the curtains, the look of the fireplace.

Father sighs in relief. “Excellent.”
This whole thing would have been far more difficult if they didn't have magic, limited though it is right now.
At the very least... he’d wanted to see if there ever could be anything between them.
"How about... Draco? Like the Spoken Name of the God of the Stars?" She glances at Hana. "Seems appropriate, doesn't it?"
He hears Pansy mutter something to herself, most likely something unflattering knowing her.
“She probably didn’t want to give you a chance to back out, now that I won’t die before the big day.”
Sometimes they walk with him, the noise of their voices washing over him as he carries the small furry creature with him. Its tongue is raspy, almost hurts when it licks his jaw. The sensation, so different from everything else, is welcome.

It would have been made to be a natural end to their relationship, no matter how sudden and shocking it would have felt to Draco. In the end, Draco would be left thinking that Harry got together with his ex after their relationship ended, and Miss Weasley would never know anything. Would never know that she’d been cheated at all.
Because the green eyed boy…
"You okay, Harry? You look kinda out of it," Ron says, face scrunched up in a frown.
"So since our lease was nearing renewal, we started looking into something bigger where we could all fit, especially since Ginny also wanted to bring Luna. Her father's in St Mungo's and she wants to live closer to the hospital and also not be alone so…" He shrugs. "That's about when I decided that maybe I should just renovate the very large wizarding house I own…"
But he wants his parents. He wants Cassiopeia.
Harry can feel his heart pound against his ribcage, so loud he fears the Inferi or the Herders might hear it.
rather typical of Harry, isn’t it?
Because why not.
Clearly he's still annoyed that he didn't get to come along to the Ministry, and that they instead had to send a message his way so he could come to them afterwards.

Of course, if there’s anyone who can come to the bottom of that sort of thing and fix it… It would be those three, wouldn’t it?

coming up with clever charms—even if he usually just used them to mock Potter—and brew potions. Now he’s stuck doing mostly what he did before he came out of his Occlumency coma: walking around the Manor and the gardens with Cassiopeia—and sometimes Aquilla—though now he also spends some time reading.
Cassiopeia lets out a loud yowl then, prompting Draco into motion again. No point in standing around here like someone hiding in his own home.
The Herder turns at the corner and starts to head their way down the corridor. There isn't much light—there never is when it's night time—but what little there is causes deep shadows in the Herder’s hood.
Adriana feels trapped, uncertain of what she should do. Before she can make any decision, however...
The strangers with the razor sharp magic come back, he sees them talking with his parents in the big room with the sofas a lot. Sometimes his parents bring him in there and the strangers’ horrible magic washes over him anew.
Friends don't do that anyway.

break up with Ginny before all of this. So he doesn't really have anything to be apologetic about, especially since it's just that he thinks Draco is pretty, right?
It hurts so much, as if his chest is trying to tear itself apart.
The puce colour her toad-like face is turning as she stares in horror at the newspaper in front of her reminds Harry a lot of Uncle Vernon.
Still, he once more comes into the sitting room to find Potter and his friends in there with his parents.
In the corner of his eyes, the places where everything is so foggy, he can see movement. He thinks his parents are moving, but he doesn't move his gaze from the small furry creature.
He takes to walking with his eyes closed, to navigating his way through life without opening his eyes. Feeling his way forward, letting Cassiopeia guide him…
Draco snorts loudly. "Yes, they are rather famous for that. Rare and controlled substances too, for

had your wand, and he was willing to return it to you.” Father looks conflicted, and Draco can only assume it’s because his feelings towards Potter are conflicted.
Harry sits slumped on their bed, staring at the gleaming ring in its little box. Maybe something’s trying to tell him to give it up, that he shouldn’t do this after all.
Has the world changed so much since the end of the war? More so than Draco could ever hope to even dream of?
And another.
He wonders if it would have been easier to die in the autumn, or perhaps during winter, when everything else is dying too. He wonders if hearing the birds sing and watching the flowers bloom makes it harder to accept the fact that he's going to die soon. That while everything else is growing and full of life, he's slowly being drained of his.

Cassiopeia starts making a very loud rumbling noise.
“No.” He can’t. He’ll break down again if he does, he knows he will. He needs to seem strong now, even though Potter has somehow convinced Draco’s parents to not only tell him where Draco is, but also let him gain access to their private property. Something that should absolutely have been impossible.
“Draco! I have our drinks!” Pansy’s loud call pulls Draco out of his thoughts and he forces a smile on his face. He can’t tell her; he can’t let her see that he’s disturbed in the least.
He… He knows that he used to be.

it feels like. And
“W R U…” As he reads it out loud, some of it becomes clear to Harry. “Wait, the last two could be ‘are you’, but what about the W?”
Draco feels like he should know that, considering his relationship with Harry… But Harry honestly doesn’t talk about her much. He talks far more about Weasley and Granger, and then the rest of the Weasleys as a monolith.
He opens and takes out the two chocolatey treats he ordered from the closest fancy bakery—they were really accommodating about the ring; Harry thinks they must get that a lot—and smiles. They look really good, and considering Draco’s sweet tooth…

Again.
“I will need to find a new bikini, and a new pair of sunglasses, and maybe a sunhat,” Pansy murmurs, deep in thought.
"Cah... Cah... Cas..." He chokes on the sounds. Tries to articulate something his brain isn't even properly thinking.
Potter even straight up told him they should keep the whole thing secret and Draco just went along with it. Thought it made perfect sense. And of course it does, for a cheater who’s trying to ensure no one finds out about the fact that he’s having an affair.

but someday.” Harry scratches his cheek and shrugs, but he’s still frowning slightly.
“Then it sounds like what we should be looking into is the concept of Others,” Granger says. “Is there anything about that in your library, Mr and Mrs Malfoy?”
“Hey now, girl, be careful,” Harry murmurs and scratches her again.
a reasonable explanation for that whole thing. Maybe Draco just… misunderstood something?
Okay, maybe he does just a little bit.
“Maybe we should give up,” Harry mutters to himself.
The look he gives Draco then is anguished and filled with shame, as if he's failed Draco anew.
It's a ridiculous thing to even consider. There is simply no way that Potter will come back.
A burst of sound almost startles them, and a whole swarm of butterflies take to the skies with multicolored wings. Draco gasps and snaps some photos with the magical camera they brought with them.
If things go wrong, and Draco dies, Harry doesn't know if he'll go on. He might just let the inferi take him.. No. No he won't. If he does, then he's going to be a problem for his friends at a later point, probably. He couldn't put them through that. Couldn't possibly risk that.
Draco is many things—dramatic, occasionally anxious, attention-seeking—but he’s not stupid. He can put two-and-two together for something as simple as this.
At least he hasn’t been doing it in public, and people haven’t known about any but his first attempt. If he’d told everyone, he’d be both frustrated
“And when were you planning to take me kneazle shopping?”
It’s all been too reminiscent of his childhood, of having all the people around him believe his Aunt and Uncle’s lies about what a terrible troublemaker he is, even though he never actually causes any trouble. It’s been like a festering wound ripped open, and it’s made him angry and snappy.
Harry swallows harshly, and cannot understate how glad he is but he dragged the body away in between machinery. If he had left it out in the open…
Draco looks at him, face completely blank. He crosses his arms over his chest and snorts inelegantly before he rolls his eyes.
The terror of this weapon caused some gods to bend before the God Wisher's will, unwilling to lose their lives to his mad rampage across the heavens.
for it."
"It was, yeah. But in the Great Hall, I found Malfoy. But he just turned around and sneered at me. That's when I woke up."
Sod this, he's not getting up before 6 am. Absolutely not.
“Draco, are you home? I just want to talk.”
He can barely believe that, just weeks ago, he didn’t think he’d live to see this. He

He’s earned it, though.
"Draco," he says again, before his strength leaves him, just like last time.
“Right,” Harry says and squints at Draco. “So you're saying the Sword of Gryffindor was made by goblins? I kind of assumed that Godric Gryffindor made it himself…”
The footsteps come closer, and the herders are arguing loudly amongst themselves. Harry and Draco draw part, this is not the time. They have to be prepared, though this is likely to get very ugly very fast.
He releases the powder, and the effect isInstantaneous.

“They're both fine; Narcissa and Lucius have been helping Draco with Teddy now that Draco has become more busy healing people.”
Harry feels lighter than he has in a long while. One more horcrux gone, and now Ron and Hermione might be coming back. And he's gotten to snog Draco and he's probably going to get to do that more going forward.
“Listen, Malfoy. I don’t have
Ron turns on his heel, running back the way they came, his face feeling hot enough to fry an egg on. He hears the door close behind him, and then Zabini lets out a loud laugh.
Harry stares at him in disbelief. What the hell does Malfoy think he’s playing at? As if Harry’s just going to stay still and do nothing when Sirius…
They match each other, and if Adriana had any doubts that Draco was the real God of the Stars, well...
Soon, he’s lying down again and someone is stroking his hair as magic washes over him in waves. He lets it happen and keeps his eyes closed, rests through the occasional stings of sharp magic coursing through him.
"For me, please, promise you'll try..." It's so selfish of him, Draco thinks, to make Harry promise, but he doesn't think he'll be able to rest easy if he doesn't. And if Draco became a ghost... He's quite sure that would be even worse for everyone involved.
he would be upset at the idea of Draco telling his friends. If Draco told others then their secret relationship would no longer be a secret between the two of them, and Harry would risk having his duplicity found out. The more people who know, the higher the risk of the "wrong people", in this case, Harry's friends, finding out.
“For my boyfriend to stop being an arse and let me explain everything so we don’t break up over a misunderstanding?”
“Maître Draco!” she squeaks, and then she’s off in rapid-fire French.
Adriana laughs. "Well, actually, they fell in love even as they competed against each other... And the God of the Stars withdrew from the competition. No one's sure
of the thought of sitting down to let Potter talk to him about this.
“No, I… I understand.” Harry gives him a wan smile, and pulls a galleon out of his pocket. He puts his wand to it, and Draco can only assume it’s one of the coins Granger used the protean charm on back in fifth year for their little battle club.
The walk back downstairs to the foyer feels like an eternity, as if time is slowing down around him as he moves, or perhaps as if he's moving towards his doom.
How is it even possible that Potter is doing so well? Shouldn't he be the one who's the most traumatised from the war, out of all of them? It’s unfair.
With a shriek she pulls her scarf on and runs out of her room, down the rickety stairs and out of the house. She hurries down the cobblestone street at full speed, hoping she won't run into anyone—they would no doubt scold her and then she really
Not to mention that it's almost the end of term and they're all heading home soon. There's no reason to worry about Potter now. No more danger for the time being, at least non for Draco to deal with. Potter will be fine, surely.
Draco shakes his head. “No, but we should still probably be careful just in case. Let's not take any chances. If we don't, we might be able to actually sleep inside after we get the poison and destroy the locket.”
“But… They failed.” Draco has no idea what to make of that.
Ron shrugs.
He closes his eyes.
He cannot feel his magic anymore.
One day, his mother brings in a new creature. He hasn't seen if before, he does not know what it is, but she places it in his arms, and it is soft. It has fur. Pale and bright fur. And as he holds it, it presses its nose against his cheek—small and cold and wet—and he can feel it vibrating against his chest, in his ears.
Draco shuts their voices out and turns his attention back to Pansy.
“Are we… okay? I mean, uhm… Are we broken up or…?” Harry says as the silence has lasted for a short while.
It made sense that Harry would be upset when he thought Draco had told his friends that they were in a relationship, they’d mutually agreed to keep it secret until they both felt ready to share the news. It’s not up to either one of them alone to decide when the time to tell everyone has come, it's a joint decision they will need to reach together, as a couple.
and magic won’t put it out!
It’s not.
“Mr Malfoy?” she gasps, seemingly shocked and appalled at this apparent betrayal.
As she drags Harry off farther into the store, Draco remains frozen in place, desperately trying to quell his sudden urge to throw up.
Draco’s hands shake as they clutch the vial of Basilisk venom. When Harry turns his gaze to Draco's face instead, he looks close to tears.
The world is still grey—it always will be, because Draco’s Other is gone—and now he’s alone. He doesn’t have anyone at his side… Perhaps his parents finally got tired of him?
“Oh Draco.” Father has never been as free with pet names as Mother, but Draco has always been able to hear “darling” and “mon petit chou” and everything in between in the way he says Draco’s names at times. The knowledge that even Father wants Draco to do this…
Somehow.
“Hey, what's going on with the crystal?” It's the first Herder again.
just fine.
Draco frowns. That… that must have been the people with the magic that hurt. He vaguely remembers them coming, casting spell after spell and then they all seemed to give up and stopped coming.
“It’s rather common to have two people who have spent most of their lives together one way or another—as friends or lovers—until one passes and the one who still lives loses colour vision and only then do they know that they were each other’s Other.” Father sounds tightly controlled, but Draco knows that it’s just because otherwise he’d sound dreamy. He’s always found the concept of Others very special, he’s told Draco as much on numerous occasions as he was growing up.
Harry doesn't answer, he only cries harder and pulls Draco into his arms, burying his wet face in Draco's hair.
Will they leave him? Will it just be him and Cassiopeia?
He seems... content, but not happy. Perhaps she shouldn't be surprised, considering that he's missing almost all of his memories, but it still makes her sad and worried for him. It would be far better if he could make his peace and decide to make new memories, rather than long for those he lost.
for no damn reason. And that’s… He can’t handle that. It’s too stupid, too embarrassing, to even
Harry stares at the locket, and then to the vial in Draco's hand.
He glances up towards the teacher’s table. Professor Dumbledore’s eyes are twinkling with mirth—it’s
Still, Draco was doing well before Potter and his earnest ways had snuck their way into his heart, and then left him broken and despairing when Potter decided he had enough.
The day when he stops longing for those lovely days when Potter was around cannot come fast enough. He longs for them with a fervour that's almost startling.
t ha—Oh.” She cuts herself off mid-word, which is not something Draco thinks he’s ever heard her do before.
They'll be spending a few days resting and preparing before they head out again, so Harry
And maybe…
If that's true...
He just needs to keep it together for another day, and then he’ll be home free. He’d almost popped the question during breakfast just because Draco looked so beautiful in the morning light, almost snorting with laughter at Harry’s not-actually-that-good joke.
His father and Hermione, though they’ve never so much as spent an hour alone together before, throw themselves into research of what kind of potion could have caused such a terrible disease and any possible antidotes. Hermione even goes so far as to contact Headmistress McGonagall to get access to the Hogwarts library to compare and contrast with Malfoy Manor’s possibly even older collection.
They don't know quite yet what they're heading into, and they don't know quite yet how they will be able to stop Voldemort. But they're going to do it, one way or another.
lips are, and Ron’s complained about that more than a few times. Not that he really thinks about Ron's lips a lot. Or ever.
"I'm sure you will be happy to hear that I have... Come across, shall we say, some information that will aid our cause immensely."
The days grow darker. He watches raindrops run like small rivers down the glass of the window as night falls earlier and earlier.
“Draco!” Potter sounds upset as he yells. “Please tell me you haven't been robbed, or hurt.”
Draco is sure that he'll stop missing Potter one day. He's already started to miss him less, after all.
If later ever comes.
before Harry even got anywhere with the question).
Harry should have stayed hidden, he should have stayed a bit further away still looking around the room instead of stepping into the middle to stand next to Draco. At least Draco’s beneath the invisibility cloak.
He struggles with that thought for days, more awake and aware than he has been since... Since... For as long as his memory stretches. Not that that is especially far, considering how it all blurs together into a smudge of days that look the same, only changing after the small furry creature came into his life.
, considering the constant barrages of angry demands Malfoy is yelling at him, increasingly out of breath, as they run to grab Sirius’s mirror.
She hopes the man didn't see her stare.
It is slow going, but at least Draco doesn't think about him constantly anymore. Thoughts of Potter are not the only things that weigh on his mind anymore, he even thinks about other people and other relationships he's had.
“Yeah, I just… tripped.” He shrugs and scratches his head, only barely refraining from screaming in frustration.
It seems Father managed to ensure that Aunt Andromeda’s daughter only lost her husband and an arm, rather than losing her life. Went quite a ways to mend things between his mother and his aunt, according to Father, anyway.
"Cassiopeia..." he whispers, desperate to remember how to shape it with his mouth.
Harry frowns. “Why? I mean… I already told everyone… Which, I mean, I guess if you want to talk about that, since I didn’t ask first, then we could but, uhm…”
Just in time for a loud moan to filter out into the hall.
“I want children.”
Harry kisses Draco’s forehead, and breathes in the ash and dust of the air around them.
This is a home-that-isn't-a-home, but a place to rest in between mad dashes across the country to try and make sense of what is going on.
“It is indeed heavily warded," Lucius says as he strokes his chin. “So heavily warded, in fact, that only someone of the Malfoy line can step on those lands on their own. Narcissa has married into it, so she can do it, however... When it comes to bringing someone else onto the grounds... Well. It's not enough to be part of the line through marriage, you have to be of the blood itself."
Draco frowns. Well, he doesn’t exactly know if it’s in a row, does he? He’s hardly up to date with Ginny Weasley’s romantic history. And why would he? He may be dating her ex, but that doesn’t mean he knows her or anything about her, really.
,” Potter says, and shivers. “I… I had a vision and…”
He falls to his knees by his trunk and starts to dig through it.
Draco sighs loudly and doesn't move at all. Whoever it is will get fed up soon enough and leave him alone. He doesn't even know who it might be, it's not like he's really given his Floo address to anyone.
“Certainly, sir! Under what name?” She looks genuinely excited at the prospect.
Draco’s better than being anyone’s side-piece, even the Boy Who Lived’s.
"I didn't need or want to know about Malfoy's arse!"
One of the King of the Gods's closest friends, the
Draco suddenly stops and holds up his free hand. Harry stops, and waits.
Heroes tend to draw in that sort of crowd, from what Draco’s seen and heard growing up.
“How did it know that I'm not an intruder?”
Draco just laughs.
The other strangers, those who try to talk to him, they still come. With their words he cannot understand and their razor sharp magic. They talk and they talk, sometimes with him, and sometimes with his parents.
“No, nothing’s wrong. It was just unexpected. Don’t worry about it. I’ll send an owl and maybe I can Floo over on Monday?”
“Er… No.”
In fact, in both France and Monaco, the two places Draco actually has personal experience with, no one even so much as bats an eye at his last name. Instead, it’s… well respected. Like it once was in Britain before the war.
He doesn’t answer Harry, instead dropping his pastry right into his own lap—something Draco would
He remembers the war, he remembers the
Adriana has heard the story a hundred times, surely, at this point, but she never gets tired of hearing it anew. No one tells it as well as her mother, she's sure of it.
and no other could know love better than she. The God of the Sun did not falter with his loss, did not diminish at having his lover ripped from him; instead he burned ever brighter. He became more determined than ever, and ever more fierce in his desire to end the God Wisher's mad rampage.
When Draco came to, he gazed down at Harry with a look of pure awe and other emotions swirling in his eyes that Harry had no idea how to process.
One, in particular, caught his eye, a slender body bobbing in the water, straddling a green surfboard as he waited for the perfect wave to start up.
“Well, like before when it hovered between Ron and me. It knew we wanted to kiss each other, so it made it happen. Er - so uh -”
"You celebrated Christmas here?" Harry imagined little Draco, blond and posh in a velvet dress like Little Lord Fauntleroy. "With a tree and garlands and twinkling stars in the windows and all?"
Harry really did try to come up with any excuse he could think of that would prevent Malfoy's hands from touching him. Not that he was that put out on the idea, quite the opposite if he was honest. But anyone's hands on him at this point would do.
Harry hummed in response as he scanned one book that went over old names from centuries ago pertaining to Italian descendants in the wizarding world, with no luck finding a Typhon listed thus far.
Draco groaned. “Fuck Potter. If you don’t start speaking English in the next three seconds, I am going to apparate us both out of here faster than you can blink.”
He sighed under his breath, watching him fit his unruly hair under the eyesore, silently thankful for him at the same time.
By some magic, he was able to keep a hold of himself above Harry as he finished, biting down on the tender flesh of Harry’s bruised neck, and he slowly lowered himself to lay down atop his sated and sticky boyfriend.
"Uh-hm," Malfoy replied with an uncharacteristic lack of words. He seemed focused on a patch of dust on an old rug. Harry could see nothing wrong with it, just a stretch of an Oriental rug, a flowery pattern in sombre colours.
Not that he wasn’t keen on pulling; it was just that the sight of Potter made things a tad more complicated than he would have liked.
He made sure to slam the door on his way out, casting a cleverly aimed and discreet anti-erection charm at Jakob before the door closed completely.
Harry had been in the middle of downing the rest of his unknown dragon drink when Luna piped up again, coughing and sputtering all over the place.
As quickly as his last expression disappeared, a new, more frightening look overcame Draco’s face then, and Harry swallowed dryly.
"I guess so," Harry said thoughtfully. Paying this particular bill might require a personal visit to Malfoy's office at Gringotts. Next year. Very early in the next year. But now it was time for – "Let's get the turkey ready for... Christmas dinner!"
Who also apparently dabbled in kinky shit in the shower from time to time.
Sadly he had school and finicky friends (Hermione) that got in his way.
A few more seconds passed then, and the clock rang midnight, a few people cheering outside even who probably had too much eggnog spiked tequila.
Potter groaned in the kiss and began his perfectly timed thrusts against Draco’s own now weeping erection.
“This Friday. My dorm. Seven o’clock.”
Well, that wasn’t exactly how he was planning on starting the conversation, but here they were.
The bartender seemed charmed by him, so he supposed not all was lost. He sat his mixing cups down and stuck a hand out for him to shake. "Rodrick, nice to meet you."
, that was impossible, Harry reminded himself as he caught his breath.
“Oh? "He told you to come begging for forgiveness, did he?" Draco growled, not wanting to speak on the man he so despised.
Blaise kept his thunderous eyes to him as she spoke, and Harry gulped, looking back to her.
Ah yes, he thinks, Hermione did know what she was doing, sending him here.
“Oh yeah, heard that alright. Draco’s always one for the dramatics, though, isn’t he?” Rodrick was wiping the sand off the bar top but watching Harry with an air of amusement, but there was still a suspicious look to him as he looked over at Harry. “He mentioned you after you walked off yesterday. He wouldn’t want me telling you that. I best stop there.”
So he got up from his bed, took off his nightwear, and put on his uniform, making sure to leave a button loose, to attract someone's attention. He felt a devilish grin crawl up on his face, only for it to descend, as he remembered the encounter the two of them had yesterday. Draco just shook his head at the memory and he left the room, not waiting for Blaise, knowing how much the guy favored his beauty sleep. He didn't go to the dining hall for the breakfast though, no, not yet. He made his way towards the willow tree with his hands in his pockets, yawning loudly, making sure he got his wand in his robe pocket.
All these years, of bickering and fighting, and threatening each other with hexes and such, Malfoy tried to keep a low profile, because in reality.. He really admired Potter. Not only for his actions, but because of his.. Stupid smile and stupid, stupid, stupid mesmerizing eyes.
"Yeah, well, it's not that big of a deal. He's just-"
"You came right on time, Headmistress Mcgonagall is about to place the new students in their houses!" exclaimed Hermione, turning her head from the Gryffindor table.
"Uh, hi, may I come in?" asked the golden boy, scratching the back of his neck.
Draco looked back at Pansy who was gesturing to him to go, aggravated. He nodded, a little bit bashful, turning back to Harry. "Well, lead the way, Potter."
"What? What? Bloody hell, Malfoy, he literally greeted you with his oh so lovely green eyes!" declared Pansy, earning a few glares from the other slytherins who were trying to eat in peace.
He was trapped.
When they got to Harry's dorm, he opened the door, letting Draco decide if he wanted to enter or back away and never talk to him again. He stepped in. Harry breathed out, relieved. The chosen boy entered after him, closing the door behind him, Draco eyeing everything in the room attentive. After a while, he turned around, waving his hands around.
A week passed by, and the two damaged boys haven't talked with each other since their last encounter. For Harry? It was the most boring week ever; no drama, no Malfoy to screw with his head, no nothing. Ron eventually got off his back after hearing everything that has happened between the two and he decided to just ignore the slytherin, since he was doing the same. For Draco, though? It was the most sorrowful week ever. He was always whining about wanting to jump off the Astronomy Tower, making Pansy and Blaise seriously worried about him, even if Blaise sometimes shrugged it off as a joke.
Harry turned around, confused, but he just brushed it off when Draco coughed awkwardly. Draco signed for him to take a sit on the couch, putting his hands into his pockets, trying to act cool and all; note to self: he did not feel cool at all.
Once the class was declared over, Malfoy stormed out, crimson cheeks still painting his face. He walked furiously, trying to get to his room, but right when he turned the corner, in the most unpopulated, dark hallways, he was up against a wall, a shadowy figure looming over him. The Slytherin looked up, pure shock written on his face. An arm was put against his left side, basically letting him escape the other way, when the person put his other arm on the wall.
"What? What did I miss, Zabini?" asked the slytherin.
Harry nodded, leading the way, from time to time turning back awkwardly, probably making sure that Draco didn't ditch him and ran away. When they got to the Gryffindor painting, he used the password, even though Fat Lady didn't particularly like the fact that a slytherin was entering the Gryffindor grounds. Draco wasn't saying anything at all, a little intimidated by the whole seat. I mean, if Harry wanted him dead, the Gryffindor wing would be the best for a quick murder, wouldn't it?
Fred and George looked at each other for a few seconds, forgetting all about the confused male who was only now paying attention to his surroundings. "Well, Freddie?"
"You okay, 'ray? You spaced out a little." asked the brunette, smiling coyly.
On his way, he noticed a lock of blonde, platinum hair heading outside of the academy, the boy with glasses sensed that something wasn't well, but he decided against his thoughts and just followed his gut that kept on telling him to disregard the matter and get to Madam Pomfrey already. So he did. He turned on his heels as soon as possible and continued his little "journey" to get his head to stop aching.
"Yes! I want to give them to.. Well.. S-Someone!" declared the brunette, a blush forming on his cheeks. "You can take some too, if you'd like! F-For Ginny... Maybe.."
Harry’s heart is pounding in his chest as he runs down the halls.
Adriana would call it.
He sleeps.
And with its discovery, she transcended mortal flesh and took her place in the pantheon of the gods. She is remembered and praised for her perseverance, for proving that humans too can become gods, and that there is no single predetermined fate for anyone. Within the dark curls that adorn her head she now carries the knowledge of the universe.
He watches Malfoy during the days, as covertly as he can. He wants to know how accurate his dreams are.
Harry feels tears well up in his eyes as he's forcing them open, almost afraid to so much as blink. He swallows again and forces himself to remain calm as he blinks rapidly. If his eyes dry out, it might make him blink at the wrong time and it might affect him in the upcoming fight. He can’t let panic take over.
He’s stupidly been considering talking with Harry about possibly telling everyone that they’re in a relationship. Finally bringing it out of the shadows and into the light, now that he was sure that they were good enough together to handle the pressure. Now that he was sure that what they could have was

flares up in Draco's chest, and in a panic he turns to the closest shop—oh bloody hell it's a furniture store—and ducks inside to hide. It's completely undignified, but he just can't deal with it. Not at all. Not now.
"He's been working a lot," Hermione says, wringing her hands and unable to look Draco in the eyes. "We'll call him when… when the time comes."
It doesn’t take him long to start sobbing in earnest, his whole frame shaking with the force of his grief and sadness, the loud sound of his crying almost echoing in the empty room. He pays it no mind,
. He’s not used to thinking in emergencies anymore.
If his parents go away... will the rest of the world go away too? Will Draco be alone, without anyone else except for Cassiopeia, until the day it... or he... dies? He shudders, trembles... He collapses in a small heap on the floor in the middle of one of the long sprawling corridors.
He chases the thought away with the image of Draco's peacefully sleeping face, and falls into his dreams with Draco on his mind.
“My, what a lovely bow you’re wearing. What is…” Draco trails off as he catches sight of the ring box hanging from Cassiopeia’s ribbon. Harry watches as Draco’s eyes grow huge and he moves forward slowly, his hands shaking as he gently undoes the ribbon.
“Give me the damn thing!” Draco yells and holds his hand out.
Adriana never goes to bed that night.
Sometimes he sleeps the days away, unwilling to leave his bed for anything. It's as if there is nothing outside of his covers that's worth anything anymore.
Unable to kill him unless he wished to lose his only chance against the God of the Sun, the God Wisher did the next best thing: he ripped the knowledge of the God of the Stars's own Ancient Name out of his mind, and with it his powers and memories.
“What fits?” Harry blinks at him, looking so charmingly confused.
“Darling…” Pansy’s voice is soft. “Blaise and I have refused to let Potter explain anything—though believe me, you and I will be having words regarding the whole ‘relationship with Potter’ thing later—but… If you want to hear him out, we can be there for you.”
Then… Then they must be… Must be…
Lucius doesn't so much as blink, but the sheer glee the Dark Lord describes Potter's dreams with, as if he's
Draco stares at the ceiling.
“I… I feel…” Draco stumbles over the words, his mind reeling. It can’t be… Can it?
“They just had their nice little bubble of denial burst,” Neville says suddenly, voice grim.
fine, indeed.
He doesn't even want to consider what the NMO would have done to him otherwise. Possibly used him in a trap, tortured him for information, or even killed him as an example. All because he's married to Harry.
time being reckless, have they?
She gives Crookshanks a pat on the head as they stand up and tells him to stay in the compartment and wait for them. Like all cats everywhere, Crookshanks doesn't reply. He
They have their back to Harry, but he would know that frame, would recognise that shade of blond, anywhere at any time.
Healer Binns nods. “Indeed. You managed to properly reconnect with your core, but it sent you into shock after so long that you ended up here in our tender care. There was a brief moment when we feared you might not make it, but you pulled through in the end.”
They curl together like small children, crying their hearts out for the future they'll never have, the future that was
Zabini laughs. "Oh unclench, Weasley! I happen to know that Draco has a small mole on the top of his left buttock and that's not because I've gone
Looking around, Adriana realises that the town is gathering. More and more of the people come, murmurs start up, and then even Old Tobias is there.
They need to understand how much his parents are sacrificing, what big a target they’re painting on their own backs right now.
“Mr Malfoy!”
"So, he stole it from an apothecary?" Harry frowns. "Considering how careful he's been overall, that makes sense. He wouldn't want anyone to be able to figure out he'd bought these ingredients at all."
“One never knows, of course. You-Know-Who

right, Blaise. I’m simply dying for a drink.”
Draco rubs at his eyes.
He swallows convulsively.
Did Draco just expect him to be that good a person? To not only forgive the horrible things he did to try and save himself and his parents, but also all the unnecessary antagonising and the ways they hurt each other during Hogwarts?
Adriana stares at the man. A pale, handsome man with amnesia? She can only think of a single name that could fit such a man—though she knows some would laugh at her for it.
Harry frowned, not liking that idea at all, his heart beating sporadically in his chest at the thought of speaking with Typhon with actual words. He much preferred the song lyrics they had going at the moment.
He looked around. The tree must have snagged her frame and took the painting down with it. Kreacher was always moving her around to different spots in the house, ignoring Harry’s complaints each time he did so. “Mistress would like to see the Christmas decorations. Kreacher will move her every day, so she stays in the Christmas spirit", Kreacher had just explained to Harry yesterday.
I would ever be infatuated with the Chosen One! Don’t make me vomit. I only forced you to come up to my dorm because I didn’t want to face being around your filth in your Merlin knows how disgusting room!”
No relation to the news, mind you.
Harry twitched in his seat as he watched Malfoy sit back down at his booth, grey eyes catching his own for a split second before Harry quickly glanced down at the empty glasses at their table.
if I ever see that shit for brains ever again, I will kill him. How dare he treat you like that - you never ever apologize for anything you understand -”
Malfoy’s eyes widened slightly before catching himself and relaxing in his usual impassive expression. Harry couldn’t help but notice the pink blush that traveled slowly up his pale neck. Harry had a strong urge to just grab Malfoy by the neck and lick…
And ridiculously hot to boot.
Draco ran a careful finger down Potter’s neck, and the bound man reacted beautifully. His whole body tensed up, his neck twisting in an attempt to give him as much room as possible for Draco’s ministrations.
Harry reached down to massage his balls and deeply regretted, not bringing any lube with him.
He wasn’t even sure why Kingsley invited a third of the Auror department in on this meeting, himself included. But he knew the Minister has been endeavoring to bring together the departments in new ways over the last several years. Harry couldn’t help but commend him for it.
"Young Master and the Mud– er, and Young Master's guest may want to stop defiling Mistress's precious tea service and see what happened to the Yule tree." He vanished, without even waiting for Harry's answer.
He noticed the man’s cock was at full attention, and Draco could almost see it bounce in anticipation from where he stood. It didn’t look like he was coming anytime soon, however, as there looked to be some sort of metal cock ring wrapped all the way around the poor sod’s prick, preventing him from coming.
“It won’t allow you to leave or touch anyone until the two chosen participants kiss,” Luna affirmed.
The image of him stuck in this bloody fleshlight and Malfoy coming to check on him hours from now entered his mind, and he had to stop himself from laughing hysterically at that.
He didn’t need anyone to bring joy to his dull life. He could figure out how to bring happiness into it without anyone else’s help. And without Draco in it.
“Roddy is hosting a party tomorrow night for Christmas if you want to stop by.” He stared at the ceiling as he said this, and Harry rolled his eyes, scooting even closer to the man in question.
Draco looked around the classroom, and everyone seemed to be minding their own business, too absorbed in their readings or on a different plane of existence entirely, not privy to the random sounds coming from the man sitting in front of him. Which made Draco wonder if he was as making this shit up; maybe he was the one losing his mind….
Classes did seem to drag on worse than usual that day, and when 11:50 PM hit, he hightailed it to his spot, making sure to get there with time to spare.
He sat atop his face, and Harry closed his eyes immediately, breathing in deeply as if this was the last time he would get to have this.
“Hop up onto the stage and make a complete arse of yourself?” Theo added from behind him, oh so helpfully.
“Yes! Please move; I want you to fuck me
But when Harry asked her about them, she was always very…
She had only sighed at him in her usual put out way anytime he brought up Malfoy, which Harry only ignored every time.
“Erm, Harry, mate, you alright? Need some gillyweed? I know Neville has some stuffed in his dress robes if you -”
Suddenly, he was immensely grateful for his insightfulness to take off a layer, as he already started to sweat at the thought of Potter being here.
Not that he wasn’t sure in his sexuality, that wasn’t a question in his mind, as far as he was concerned. He knew he fancied men and women.
Harry’s brows drew together in confusion. “What’s that?”
She grabbed her boyfriend by the collar to leave, but Ron was able to lean in close to his friend before she pulled him away completely. “Come on, mate, just give it a go. You never know what could happen; it’s the holidays after all!”
“Pina colada. Extra shot of your 8 year Bacardi on the top. Not too much ice. Ta.”
That seemed to calm the other man down quite a bit at that.
are we? You make me come once, and you think it’s your turn to come so quick, too?”
Draco’s own under him. Harry groaned into the other’s mouth at the feeling of his long erection under him.
His usually pointy and pale face was - well, still sharp as ever -but his cheeks were adorned with pink spots, and his eyes were a mix of mischievous and tipsy as he laughed infectiously.
Draco blinked once, and once again as he took in the pitiful man beside him, and started to chuckle lowly in his throat before it broke through his pursed lips and became a full guffawing laugh at Harry’s expense.
“That color, and - your
Harry wondered how it would feel, receiving that treatment from him. He was a few inches shorter than Malfoy, and he figured they would fit well together. He could easily imagine himself standing in front of him, Malfoy massaging his ridiculously expensive hair products into his wet hair, fingertips grazing his neck.
But he had other plans in mind for today—plans he had just concocted in his brilliant brain.
“Come then. Now.” He gritted out, and Harry wailed, his cock spurting out copious amounts of come all over the bedsheets, his mouth open as his screams turned into soft croons. From behind his eyes, he could have sworn he saw a purple light, but he didn't have his wits about him to check or really care for that matter, his orgasm taking everything out of him.
Not that it couldn’t be others; there were plenty of students who would do whatever necessary to send the savior of the wizarding world a few love songs. But the thought of Typhon being some random lonely Second Year girl made Harry extremely uncomfortable.
. Harry only shrugged. He could feel his cock dripping as Draco continued to rim him, his tongue slipping into him with ease as his body opened up eagerly to the ministrations.
Draco just breathed out a long sigh before unclenching his jaw.
“Fuck!” he angrily whispered as he blinked the stars out of his eyes.
At some point in his research and fervent listening to all the songs, Harry knew it all came down to this, and he was going to find his person tonight.
“You are a brilliant singer too. I uh - just wanted you to know. I didn’t mean, erm, the other day I mean -”
He bit a spot right above Draco’s collarbone, and the man in question threw his head back with a louder groan. Potter whined into his neck, his tongue swirling the spot.
The Gryffindor grunted in response.
Their feet were almost touching.
He had hoped it would be a bit longer before Draco had to be in Potter’s company once again, but here they were. He carefully watched the crowds shuffling around, no sign of him or his comrades anywhere.
Finally unpacking a bit (or at least, throwing his luggage somewhere on the floor), Harry lay on his bed and finally felt as though he could breathe in a full breath of air for the first time in months.
And he did just that. He leaned down, sucking the bottom lip between his own teeth, dragging it out, wanting to leave Potter just as breathless as he left him at the end of Potions. With that in mind, Draco straddled the man, making sure to rub himself against him, delighted with how hard Potter was under him already.
being pushed on the bed by Potter, the opposite in fact.
“It does bring up quite a mental picture, though, doesn’t it?”
Not that he expected anything different in this situation…but just having Draco standing here vehemently trying to get out of a little kiss was affecting him more than he thought it would.
else, besides the smooth and surprisingly soft touches coming from the man behind him.
To his absolute delight, Malfoy seemed not to be one to wear pants to bed, as he pulled up the pajama bottoms with nothing underneath.
After making his way over, shoes echoing in the mostly silent room, Draco stopped beside the man and looked down at him, attempting an air of indifference, as he took him in, ignoring the way his breath caught in his throat as he gazed down at the bound man below him.
It’s better this way.
His mother enters the room and bends down to give him a kiss on his forehead. Her mouth twitches in the corners as he turns his attention to her, instead of staring at Cassiopeia's tail.
“It took us a few weeks to sort out what, exactly, was causing your more or less catatonic state. When we did, we brought in expert Legilimens to sort you out.”
have allowed the kneazle to stay as they requested,” Healer Binns mutters. “Likely would have saved our patient some stress and agony, judging by his reaction to waking up alone.”
to stay in this dreadful forest, then I know precisely what we should be doing. We should go to Malfoy Manor,” Draco says, as if that wasn't the craziest thing Harry has heard all week. All year even.
He feels her muscles tense under his hands as he holds on to her, as she takes in Draco’s rather bad summary of his and Potter’s relationship.

Harry winces, when Draco looks up at him in horror.
Harry...?
Harry.
“So you’re not planning on continuing your mad rampage and head to the Ministry anymore, yes?” Draco cuts in, absolutely done with this whole situation. He needs to talk to his father!
though Draco knows that’s only his imagination. He hurries down the corridors—as quiet as can be—listening carefully for Potter and his cronies.
The man suddenly looks uncomfortable, and the smallest of blushes starts to spread on his cheeks—adding a dash of colour to his pale skin.
Draco cannot
Not when Potter has already all but destroyed him.
“But we're lucky that we at least have Hogwarts, considering that the NMO managed to lock down all of St. Mungo's and kidnap most of the healers.” Harry can't really describe how relieved he is that on just that day, Draco had gone home early and thus escaped capture.
sometimes.
He greets Aquilla, stroking his feathers gently as Cassiopeia lounges across his shoulders, purring in his ears. His two companions seem to get along at least; Draco likes that. He doesn't know what he would have done with himself if they were at odds or incompatible.
The scrapbook is lovely, Draco thinks as he gently strokes his fingers against its cover. He may not be able to leave it to his children, but he will be able to at least leave it to his parents.
“Well! If we don't actually
He drifts.
He doesn’t want to risk missing it. It’s just too important.
Who knows what the future will bring?
"Hey, Hermione," Ron mutters as a realisation pops into his head, "Looks like Parkinson has lost Malfoy. You don't think he and Harry bumped into each other and got into a fight, do you?"
"Are you sure I cannot tempt you to stay?" he whispers, just barely letting his lips brush Harry's.
Parkinson gives her a look, but nods, and they all set off together. Hermione and Parkinson head up the front, while Zabini falls back on step with Ron.
“No,” Harry says immediately. “Both that and the Sorting Hat have stayed safe in Dumbeldore’s office.”
smells like lavender.
The Dark Lord laughs. It's not a happy nor an especially pleasant laugh.
“Well! Thank you very much, Mrs Malfoy.” Granger sounds genuinely thrilled, and Draco can only assume that she’s smiling. Possibly at the thought of having the run of Malfoy Manor’s library. He doesn’t think anyone who went to Hogwarts at the same time she did has missed how much she enjoys books.
Of course, as soon as he releases Draco from his magic, Draco returns the favor and soon they're both far above the Herders. In relative safety.
And then...
that it would unmake them, should the God Wisher use it on them.
“Your attacker.” Harry presses another kiss to Draco’s knuckles. “He found the person who attacked you, and he found the recipe for the poison and… St. Mungo’s figured out an antidote, a cure.”
“McGonagall's got Hogwarts on lockdown, and the NMO can't get in. She's on our side, and the students are well aware of it. She's locked down all forms of outside communication, and only trusted house elves are allowed to leave the grounds at all at this point. Hogwarts is essentially another safe place for us to go, if we absolutely need it.”
"Draco?" He fights to keep his voice steady, his appearance calm and unbothered. "What can he do?"
Adriana flinches. A handsome man who appears to be glowing, who's called
The strangers, those who ignore him, have stopped coming to the Manor. The Manor that now looks completely different from what it once was. At least, he thinks so. It has changed as he's walked these halls, so it must be different now. That is what change means, isn't it? He nearly wonders who they were, the strangers, but it doesn't matter. Nothing matters, does it?
Finally Malfoy relents, panting harshly from exertion and glaring at Harry.
"You've cooked! I
He wonders if he will know more names, more than just that of the small furry creature. He wonders if, perhaps, he will remember his name, or his parents' names, or the Manor's name... Or perhaps even the names of the strangers he once thought might be his friends.
“We have no time to lose. I doubt they can find us here, but I just used a bunch of magic and I don't
He’s gone from sleeping so much to suddenly not sleeping at all.
No. No, they’ve never been like that. It would make far more sense for Weasley or Granger to be Potter’s Other.
"I was so worried. They almost
“Like an extension of your self. The other side of your coin. Someone you share a strong bond with, be it platonic or romantic. Someone with whom you have complimentary magic.” Mother’s voice is calm. “Not everyone has an Other, and there’s no sure way to tell who your Other
Draco flounces past them. As much as he’s playing up his annoyance, he’s glad for it. If nothing else, his friends are
On the topic of forgiving Potter, however... well. Draco will leave that for now. Maybe he should have been more receptive to talking about his feelings back then, but he’d just been a bit down on occasion! There was nothing to talk about! He’d just wanted Potter to stop prying, not break up with him.
“There you go, girl. Take that box to Draco for me, will you?” Harry gives her a kiss on the head and puts her down on the floor, watching as she starts to elegantly make her way towards Draco, her tail high in the air like a plume.
There’s a slapping noise.
He feels cold.
“Hey,” Harry murmurs as he takes a seat next to Draco’s bed. “How are you feeling?”
"You've been crying." Pansy looks at him with huge doe eyes then. "Don't think we haven't noticed. You've refused to take off your sunglasses for most of the time, and I
“Well, congratulations,” Draco mutters bitterly, “I forgot to change my Floo settings when I moved.”
"Not sure I like the idea of them running around with Kreacher, but I suppose it's the lesser of two evils right now." Black's voice sounds wry.
He wanders.
Harry doesn't know what to think about the fact that somehow, some way, Andromeda Tonks is here. She just... came by. Or, well, not exactly. She found someone she knew was part of the rebellion, and convinced them that she needed to speak with their leaders.
stick.
Kissing Cho was... not great. Not at all like he imagined it in fourth year, before... before everything. She cried in the middle of it and that hadn't exactly felt great for Harry in any way.
So, they’ve gone on secret dates, mostly in the muggle world but also wearing glamours sometimes. It’s a bit of a trade-off, Draco finds. He enjoys magical restaurants far more, possibly because it’s what he’s used to and because he enjoys being able to blithely use his magic as he pleases, but he also wants to be looking at
Draco rolls his eyes. “Because, for me, ‘in it for the long haul’, as you put it, means at the very least an
He still feels so tired though. The thought of actually getting out of bed is suddenly extremely daunting, even though he's decided to do it. And if he gets out of bed, then he will need to look at the mess in his apartment.
Draco focuses on drinking his tea and avoids looking at anyone else in the room. He’s too embarrassed to really… Merlin, this whole situation is hateful. And the worst part is that he absolutely sort of created it himself, even if Harry is
He wakes up instantly, and stares at the panel above his own four-poster—much smaller than the one he'd seen in his dream—as his heart hammers away in his chest.
“Enchanted mirror…?” Harry murmurs, and the thought strikes him like lightning from clear skies.
Harry doesn't cook often, even though he's found that he likes it a lot more now, in adulthood, when he does it for himself and people he loves rather than being forced to do it for other people who he doesn't like and who definitely don't like him.
Harry was afraid that he would say that. He had hoped that Draco would say something much more cheerful, have some better news. He knew better than to hope for that but... Hope springs eternal.
“I need to head off now,” Harry murmurs. “I’ve got an early morning, and Ron and Hermione will be wondering where I am.”
He doesn’t think there’s any chance of him actually falling asleep tonight, not when… not when…
swimming places. A few lakes, certainly, but Draco’s parents would never have taught him to swim in them.
That sounds like absolute heaven, and Harry is not going to argue about how they shouldn't because it might be dangerous. He thinks he deserves to have at least
There are five Herders inside the factory, as far as they've been able to tell. Now they just have to hope that most of them will leave for the explosions, so that they can take care of whoever stays behind easily enough. The element of surprise should allow them to succeed.
She waves her wand, no doubt making some sort of note, and Draco flees the shop as soon as he can.
A loud crack, and suddenly the resident house elf stands before them.
it’s the only explanation. He must have misheard it because it’s bloody well insane.
Laughing, Harry opens the door and yells something down the hallway. Draco can't even begin to fight the smile that the sudden stampede of footsteps brings to his lips.
“Goblin made? I thought they were bankers…” Harry stares at Draco, confused. He has to admit that he didn't listen too well in Binns's lessons regarding the Goblin Wars, but it's still kind of weird. He feels like he should have at least remembered
Draco smiles and raises an only slightly shaking hand to gently stroke Harry's cheek.
“Are you sure?” Father’s voice is low and serious, but Draco cannot think of why. It’s not like Father to care much about Potter’s situation in general, though Draco supposes things have changed a lot since the Battle of Hogwarts, all things considered.
Right on time, as always, Draco steps inside their apartment.
They're discussing the situation in the wider tactical group, not just the core leader group. They need more people to discuss this before they make a decision after all. That's when Neville brings up a plan but Harry wouldn't have thought of in a million years.
“You! How
He shakes his head to stop focusing on the negative. They have a chance to find something that should be able to destroy the locket and that is something to celebrate. He also feels better, now that he doesn't have the locket hanging around his neck every now and again. He's still worried that they will lose it, but Draco hasn't allowed him to have it back since he put it in the bag so... Harry's just going to have to trust that Draco is taking care of it.
He moves his hands over Malfoy's chest, skims over a pink nipple and startles at the moaning sound Malfoy lets out at the contact.
“I don’t care what you think about my parents, Potter, but they’re both very accomplished, and they’re
“Oh!” Harry looks genuinely surprised. “Yeah, that’s true. I guess… I guess I just assumed that we were in it for the long-haul, you know?”
"I promise," Harry sobs, the words muffled against Draco's skull.
After all, accidental magic usually does some rather
“You're right. We'll have to use the amulets to make sure everyone gets the information. So they all know what we're doing too.” Draco’s face is resolute, though Harry can see how his hands tremble.
Draco supposes that it's just something he needs to accept.
Blaise lets out a loud cough, but he doesn’t say anything. Judging from his facial expression he’s struggling a
It's when they're lying in bed, Draco's naked body pressed against Harry's, and Harry closes his eyes, that he can pretend that nothing has changed—that everything is like it was before the NMO gained traction and started causing tragedy across Wizarding Britain.
“Just come back safe,” Draco whispers, voice so low that Harry almost doesn't hear it. “Both of you. Please, just come back safe.”
So odd, in fact, that Draco nearly opens his eyes. He catches himself at the last minute, he has no interest in looking at them. Last he saw Potter…
have plans for it, then maybe Draco should take his friends somewhere else. Perhaps the Monaco Villa instead. It’s very close, so they could easily get together with his parents if that’s the case.
"If we managed to reverse the effects instead, I think that's when we have a chance of saving people who have been turned. But that is going to be way riskier and have a far larger risk of us dying rather than succeeding."
If not for the fact that Ginny helped Harry make sure everything would be Just Right, he would probably be even more nervous right now. If that’s even possible. He’s got a plate of his favourite French food he can’t pronounce in front of him, and he can barely eat it. That really says it all.
He falls asleep then, still choking back tears and trying to drown his angry thoughts. Amidst all of it, there is at least one single glimmer of hope: he didn’t get his friends killed. He was stopped before anything truly bad could happen.
"Where
have lived to see it if not for the effort of his friends and family. Draco is going to make the absolute most of his life from now on. He nearly lost his life, nearly died before his twenty-third birthday. But now… Now, he’s been given back the time that was almost stolen from him, so he’s not about to waste it.
They're skin against skin, pressed together.
“What does it say Neville?” Ginny’s voice sounds excited, but it’s hard to tell among the screaming and raised voices in the Great Hall.
As long as Kreacher doesn’t find out—he’ll be in a bad mood forever if he finds out he wasn’t consulted for the food meant for a proposal to someone of Black blood—that’s just fine with Harry.
