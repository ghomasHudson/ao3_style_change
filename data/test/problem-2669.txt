“I don’t understand,” Harry says next to Draco. “Everything was fine. He’s still sick all the time.” Draco can hear the tears in his words, knows Harry’s heart is breaking. Harry’s free hand strokes some of Draco’s hairs out of his face, and then his thumb slides over Draco’s cheek.

“Dad,” Neville starts.
Harry James Potter
Harry nods and they continue to walk in silence. When they get back to the common room, they sit down by Ron and Hermione as if nothing happened. Harry takes out a piece of parchment and a quill and starts to think. What would be a good place for a rat to hide, and how will they be able to get him out of his little hole?
Silent tears fall from Harry’s eyes. Whenever he closes them, he sees the horror in Draco’s eyes. Harry should look him up and tell him he’s sorry. He needs to make sure that Draco knows that Harry won’t ever try anything like that again. And then he needs to beg him to stay Harry’s friend. Harry just wants to still be his friend.
Harry shakes his head. “Who gives a fuck about Cedric?” Harry says. As soon as the words are out of his mouth he knows he made a mistake. He’s supposed to be crushing on Cho, was so only a couple of weeks ago. She was good on a broom. Harry can’t help he has a soft spot for seekers. But she’s nothing compared to Cedric, or Malfoy. Malfoy knows how to handle his broom, how to make Harry work for his win. It’s a shame there is no Quidditch this year, no excuse to go look at Malfoy showing off his skills.
It was the week before exams would start when Draco figured it out. I had told him that I had heard a voice saying it was going to kill before all of the attacks. And he knows that Hermione was carrying around a mirror when she got petrified. The monster of Slytherin was a Basilisk. That was why I could only hear the voice. I’m the only one we know in this school that understands Parseltongue. A Basilisk kills you instantly with the stare of his eyes, but none of the victims had looked it straight in the eye. Hermione had used the mirror, Colin saw it through his camera, Justin was looking through Nearly Headless Nick and Mrs Norris had only seen the Basilisk reflection in the water that had been on the floor. That’s why none of them had died.
Harry snaps his head to Neville for a second. He stands with his chest out and his shoulders pulled back. “What about me?” he says. “Scared yet of the boy who destroyed your lord?”
* * *
I love you and miss you so much right now.
“Okay, well I’m off to inform the family. Wish me luck,” Ron says, and then he’s gone.
Draco shakes his head and then takes Harry’s hand back in his. They walk through the train until they find an empty compartment. Draco closes the door and then continues to lock it with his wand.
Professor Snape dragged us to the headmaster’s office when Draco told him that I had a dream again that hurt my scar. (it was funny to hear that the password for the headmaster’s office is Cockroach Cluster). When we reached the big oak door we could hear voices on the other side. The headmaster was having a conversation with the minister of Magic and Professor Moody. Snape shook his head and motioned to us to be quiet. It was a bit strange, listening in on a conversation because Professor Snape wanted to eavesdrop.
“Please don’t leave me,” Draco stutters. “Please make it stop. Make it all stop. I just want it all to be over. I want to die.”
A huge smile forms on Harry’s face. “I can see,” Harry signs back. His heart hammers in his chest and he’s glad he doesn’t have to speak. “You stopped him,” Harry signs.
“Just like you hated him?” Hermione asks.
The blush is back on Draco’s cheeks. A real tear slowly makes its way down his cheek. Harry reaches out and gently wipes it away with his thumb. Then he leans in and places a kiss on Draco’s lips. “I love you,” he whispers when he rests his forehead against Draco’s forehead. Draco’s hands play with Harry’s hair for a little and then he pushes Harry away. His hands move and Harry’s heart skips a beat when he sees Draco’s fist turn in front of his chest and then point his finger at Harry.
“No, I won’t. I won’t fall for that lie,” Hermione says.
Mrs Prince looks up and takes the letter. Harry points to where the list of books starts. He bounces around on his feet as Mrs Prince scans the list. She keeps shaking her head and Harry is afraid that none of the books will be here. Not that it would be the end of the world. Sirius already promised to send them all to Harry if needs be. But if they are here, it will be quicker. And Harry just wants to show Draco some of the books. Draco loves to read. It’s the way he learns.
“Sorry, ‘Mione,” Harry says without looking at her. “I need to see this.”
Sunday we had to get back to studying, because or exams have started since Tuesday. Hermione was in a panic on Sunday, afraid she wouldn’t do any good because she had missed so much while being petrified. Draco told her not to worry, that he had no problem with taking over her number one position. She hit him with a book after that and Daphne and I just laughed at them. Greg tried to cheer Hermione up by saying she would still do better than him and that just made her determent to tutor Greg for the rest of the Sunday afternoon.
Harry shakes his head. “It’s nothing,” he says.
But today is different. Harry is here on a mission. And if it means that he actually has to study to get Malfoy to talk to him, then that is what Harry is going to do. Harry walks past the first set of tables, quickly scanning for Malfoy. He’s not here. Harry didn’t expect him to be. It’s mostly first and second years that stay at the front of the library. And Malfoy prefers the spot at the back of the library. Most older years do. Mrs Prince is less likely to hear you speak and kick you out. Not that Harry thinks Malfoy would ever get kicked out of the library. He doesn’t talk. And Harry doesn’t think Malfoy is one for eating in the library. He always seems to take good care of his books. They all look brand new when he reads them in class. Harry thinks they are Malfoy’s most precious possessions.
“Come along, Ron,” Hermione says behind Harry.
The nightmares are getting worse, by the way. The ones with Draco disappearing. They wake me up almost every night now. And I just have to get up and check that Draco is still in his bed. It just feels so real, the dreams. They scare me, dad. Do you think it’s a bad omen? Should I be worried, or is it just because I’ve lost him? Am I dreaming him disappearing because he doesn’t like me anymore? Because he hates me now?
“I should have talked to him first,” Harry says. He understands now. He’s been making choices for Malfoy, deciding what is best for him, without asking or considering Malfoy’s feelings. He’s been a fool. And Malfoy will hate him for going behind his back.
Draco lays in bed. He stares at the ceiling. A small tear tracks over his face, slowly making its way down to drop to the pillow below Draco’s head. Last year, on this day, he lost his baby. A whole year has passed, and nothing has changed. Draco is still not pregnant again. Draco wishes he knew what is wrong with him. The only thing he can think of that this is his punishment for all the wrongs he did during the war. All the lives he ruined in the name of blood purity and insanity. Why else would he still be childless? Hermione and Ron had forgotten protection once with New Years, and now Hermione is getting huge with the baby growing inside her. Pansy only needed a one night stand to get pregnant, the bitch. And she expects Draco to feel sorry for her. To tell her how horrible her life has become now that she needs to be responsible. Fuck her and her stupid stunts. Doesn’t she get that she has the one thing that Draco wants more than anything? Doesn’t she see that if Draco can’t get pregnant, he’s going to lose the love of his life?
Monday 16 November 1992
Draco laughs. “Nothing? Are you sure of that?” He lets his hand slide over Harry’s neck and lets his fingers burrow into the soft hairs at the back of his neck.
On his tiptoes, Harry sneaks out of the dormitory. Down the stairs and into the empty common room. The fire is still going. Fresh wood lays beside it. All the junk has been cleaned away. It seems the house-elves have already done their job.
“You killed the boy,” the Dark Lord says. “Unintentional.” He laughs. Draco shivers from the sound. “Isn’t that poetic. I’ve tried for years, and always failed. But you, you didn’t plan to, didn’t even want to, and you succeeded.”
“Draco can’t fly,” Hermione says. “Not that he’s missing out. I hate being on a broom.”
“Don’t be a fool, Neville,” Hermione says. She doesn’t look up from the paper but skims through the article about Pettigrew.
Harry puts his book down and strokes his hand over Draco's back. He leans over and places a kiss on Draco's neck, just below his hairline. Draco used to love it when Harry would do that before sex became a necessary evil. Now it’s just a reminder of how big a failure Draco has become. He doesn’t want this to last. He just wants Harry to dump his sperm inside him. What does it matter if Draco enjoys it or not?
Harry knows this. He wants to have fun. But it’s hard. He just misses Draco so much. And not hearing from him. Harry gets that his parents don’t want Draco to visit Harry. But sure he’s allowed to send letters. There is nothing wrong with letters, is there?
“No, that’s not it,” Harry says. “It’s worse, or maybe better. Depends on how you look at it.”
I think that’s all for now. I still need to finish some homework for our lessons tomorrow, so I better start working on that.
“Oh,” both Greg and Vincent say in unison. It all makes sense to them now and they focus on their breakfast again. Draco looks at his own plate. Still empty. The coffee he poured sits untouched in its cup. If it wasn’t for the standard warming spells on the cups it would have turned cold by now.
“Hermione is always right,” Harry answers.
Harry wants to smack Ginny. Sometimes she’s a pain in the arse. But she’s Ron’s little sister, and good on a broom. Harry loves playing Quidditch with her on their days off. She will surely get a place on the team when there are openings next year. But she should know not to judge people by their cover. Luna is weird, and looks the part, but she’s a lovely person. Ginny is her friend, she knows that appearances aren’t all that reliable.
“Yes, I have,” Harry sneers. He clenches his hands for a second and then he changes his position again.
Draco doesn’t know what to say. He knows Harry means well, tries to comfort him. But it hurts. Harry should hate him. It’s all his fault that they lost their baby, that they still don’t have a child of their own.
It got worse after that. We were paired up by the professors and against complaints from both of us Professor Snape paired me with Draco, saying it was time we tried to work out or differences, so Draco could start helping me with my Potions homework again. Professor Snape was tired of reading my horrible work. Hermione was forced to partner with Millicent, a girl in my house that is I think dating Vincent at the moment.
That night we also had Astronomy at midnight. And then on Wednesday, we had History of Magic and Herbology. And this morning started with our Defence Against the Dark Arts exam, where we had to take an obstacle course that contained a Grindylow, Red Caps, a Hinkypunk and a Boggart. Draco was allowed to skip the Boggart. I think Professor Lupin was afraid of a repeat of the lesson we had at the beginning of the year when Draco’s Boggart turned into my dead body.
Professor Snape had told Nott to use a spell called Serpensortia. The end of his wand exploded and a long black snake shot out of it. The snake landed in front of me, ready to attack. Professor Snape was just about to get rid of it, seeing I was frozen in place when Professor Lockhart stepped in and managed to only make it fly through the air. The snake was now hissing furiously at Justin Finch-Fletchley. And I don’t know why I did it, I can’t even remember deciding to do it, but I walked towards the snake and told him to leave him alone. And the snake slumped to the floor, and I knew it wouldn’t hurt anyone now. I looked up at Justin expecting him to be grateful, but he was angry and scared. He screamed: ‘What do you think you’re playing at?’ and stormed out of the hall. Everyone was muttering around me and Professor Snape looked at me with a shrewd and calculating look.
Harry James Potter.
Remus laughs and Harry gives him an angry look. “It’s not funny. I thought she died,” Harry says.
“Not guilty,” he whispers.
But the good memories get clouded by the horrible ones. He remembers all the times he yelled at Vincent when he did something wrong in Draco’s eyes. And how he ignored his friends in sixth year because he didn’t think he could trust them, that they wouldn’t have understood that he had to do it, to save his mother. And the fire. Draco will never be able to forget the fire. Or the sight of horror on Vincent’s face when he slipped from Draco’s hand and fell into the flames.
“We need to find a way to help him,” Harry tells Ron, Hermione and Neville.
Nott, Crabbe and Goyle laugh. “Don’t worry, Professor Lupin,” Nott says. “Malfoy is a bit of a drama queen and he will get over himself soon enough.”
“You and Harry having any luck on the baby front?” Blaise asks when he sits down next to Draco.
The only problem is that the traps are always empty. Even regular rats don’t seem to get trapped in them.
“He won’t,” Hermione says. She places her hand on top of Harry’s. It forces him to stop fidgeting with his sleeve.
“You need to blow on it,” Teddy informs him. “Just like this.” Teddy puts Harry’s mug down and takes his own in both his hands. He lifts it to his mouth and blows softly. “Don’t blow too hard, or you’ll spill it, and then grandma will get angry.”
Remus laughs. “Yes, I guess it does. It’s not very friendly either.”
The notebook. Draco’s notebook. I looked at where Riddle was nodding towards and I could see the little diary Draco had been writing in all year. About his fears and heartbreak. He had told me. And now Riddle was telling me that he had charmed Draco into trusting him, that it had been boring to listen to the silly little troubles of a twelve-year-old boy. But he had written back, had been sympathetic and kind, making Draco pour his soul into the diary, so Riddle could grow stronger. So strong that he became more powerful than Draco, and started pouring his soul into him. Riddle had made Draco open up the chamber of Secrets, had him strangle the roosters and had him write threatening messages on the walls.
And then there is the extra homework we’ve gotten from the Ministry of Magic. Draco and I passed all the tests with flying colours and it’s official now. We are bonded by the Corpora Anima Una bond. We’ve gotten all these extra books we need to read to understand what it all means. It also means we get special treatment in the case of injuries and stuff because it will affect both of us. I wondered if it could also mean that we have to take all our exams together, that would help me loads with potions. Hermione told me not to be silly and Draco told me I should just study harder. I need to go find me a new best friend and boyfriend that aren’t so against cheating. But well, that’s never going to happen because I love them both too much to let them go.
So Draco hasn’t said a word about what happened up in the sky, or about the promises before the match even started.
“Yes, and the first thing I did was make you believe you’ve been sleeping with me for the last two years, so I could have sex whenever I want to,” Dean jokes.
“Drop your wand, or he dies,” Pettigrew says with a chuckle.
At that point, one of the Dementors came for me. It raised both its rotting hands and lowered its hood. It was terrifying to see. Where its eyes should be there was only grey scabbed skin, stretched blankly over empty sockets. But it had a mouth, a gaping, shapeless hole, sucking the air with the sound of a death rattle. The Dementor’s hand were strong around my neck, it forced my face upward, I could feel its breath. I closed my eyes and for one second I gave in to the fact that I was going to die. And then I heard your voice again, mom. Screaming and begging for Voldemort to let me live. You sacrificed yourself to save me and I would not let it be for nothing. I was going to fight. I started to think of all the amazing memories I’d made with Draco. I thought about the first time he kissed me, and the first time he told me he loved me. I thought about Christmas and how we did a little more than just kiss for the first time in our lives. I thought about how good it felt to come with Draco’s mouth on me and of how he told me he loved me over and over again when I returned the favour. All the memories together worked, I did it. A silver dragon shot from my wand and I could see it chase the Dementors away. It’s the last thing I remember from that moment. I think I fainted on top of Draco after that.
I don’t know what happened next with the fight because Hermione had taken my arm and had pulled me out of the shop. She took me for some ice-cream and tried to cheer me up. When I was not close to tears anymore we went back to Flourish and Blotts where we found the Weasleys, Hagrid and Hermione’s parents standing outside. Mr Weasley and Mrs Weasley were having an argument and Hermione’s parents looked scared and were happy when they could take Hermione back home. She screamed she would write as soon as she was home. Ron wouldn’t look at me and Ginny was still crying. George was trying to calm her down. Fred gave me a fist bud on the shoulder and said it was okay, that their older brother Charlie was also bent and that it was nothing to be ashamed about. I just nodded and was glad that we were going back to the Borrow after all that.
Quirrell continued his little speech and said it had all been a waste of time from Snape because he was going to kill me that night. He snapped his fingers and ropes sprang out of thin air wrapping themselves tightly around me.
"So you and he aren't going to join us for dinner," Ron says. "And you need me to tell mom because you're scared shitless of what she'll say."
The Dark Lord chuckles and Draco turns his head so he can see the man. He twirls his wand in his hand. His tongue licks over his upper lip. The right side of his mouth is lifted in a grin and his eyes twinkle as if he’s just got a new toy from Santa.
Granger looks at Draco likes he’s a fool. “I’m not his girlfriend,” she says.
“I guess that’s a no,” Blaise continues.
“Why don’t you go take a bath, relax and wash your hair. You’ll feel better afterwards,” Harry says.
It’s a fun afternoon, and Teddy is excited when he opens his presents. The new broom is a big success, and it doesn’t take long before Harry pulls out Draco’s and his brooms so they can go flying with Teddy. But Teddy only wants to fly with Ginny, saying she’s the best. So Ginny takes Draco’s broom, and she and Harry take off with Teddy to the backyard to fly around.
And then we talked about Black. I asked him if he had known him too as they had both been friends with my father. He said he did. He didn’t really want to talk about it. He looked at the picture on his desk and then looked out of his window. He told me they had been friends for so long, that he still can’t really believe that he did what he did, kill all those people. I think Professor Lupin was close to tears. His voice was trembling and I just couldn’t tell him what I had overheard, that I now know that Black was my godfather, your best friend and that he betrayed you, dad.
“Careful, Teddy, we don’t want you to fall,” Harry says. His steps are secure and robust on the stairs. Draco takes another breath and wipes the tears from his eyes. He can’t have them find him like this in the bathroom, Teddy would just get upset, and that is the last thing Draco wants. He steps into the bedroom just when Teddy opens the door.
The Dark Lord waves Rookwood away. Rookwood stands up and finds another seat further along the table. The Dark Lord’s eyes find Draco. He pats the seat beside him. Draco nods and takes his new place. He’s been promoted. Draco knows this will save his mother, they both won’t die tonight. But it will also mean that his faith is sealed. Before Easter break is over he will wear the mark on his arm. He’ll be one of the Death Eaters, and his betrayal will be complete.
Is Draco even going home during Easter? Or will he be alone at the castle this time around? No, not alone. A lot of students from higher years stay at the castle during Easter. To study for their exams and stuff like that. Draco won’t be alone. But will there be anyone he can communicate with? Harry wishes he could talk to Draco, to at least make sure he will be fine during break. Harry just wants him to be fine and happy.
“I’m not going to be a big brother now,” Teddy says out of nowhere. Draco looks up at him and shakes his head.
“I’ll help you,” Draco says. He doesn’t know where the words come from. He shouldn’t say these things out loud. It could mean the end of him. Of his mother and father. When the Dark Lord finds out.
One small spot of the campsite was covered in shamrocks and was filled with Irish people. Seamus Finnigan and his best friend Dean Thomas among them. We had a little chat with them, Seamus was sure that Ireland was going to win, no matter what. We agreed and then moved on so we could talk about Victor Krum, the Bulgarian Seeker. He looks a bit grumpy most of the time, but he’s an amazing flier. And he’s only eighteen years old. He’s been in Quidditch Weekly a couple of times and his skills are impressive. I wish I could fly like that. (Draco says I should tell you that he thinks I fly even better than Krum)
Harry James Potter
Draco stayed at Hogwarts this Easter holiday. He said I would need him more than his mother would need him. It’s nice to have him around. We are not allowed to go outside the Slytherin common room because of the attacks so we spent most of our time just hanging around in our dormitory, talking and playing with magic. It’s nice. I’ve missed this, just the easy simple time with Draco.
“Slytherin is going to do the same,” Harry says. He rests his head on the back of the sofa. “The games against Hufflepuff are going to be the deciding factors. And Digory knows this. They’ve been training like crazy so they can defeat Slytherin. Nobody wants the cup in the hands of the snakes.”
“Fine, if you want to know so badly,” Harry says. “I love you. That’s what’s going on. I’m in love with you. And I just wondered. I don’t want to assume anything. It’s just, I don’t know if you love me too.”
“I just can’t, Harry. She…” Draco watches as Harry pulls his arms into his jacket, as he picks up the bag on the floor that holds a gift. Not that Draco knows what Harry got for Pansy and her new baby. Fuck he doesn’t even know if it’s a boy or a girl.
Draco gets up with the help of Luna, and he takes a seat in their car. He remembers something about their plans to travel all over Great Britain this year to find rare plants and non-exciting creatures. But why in a Muggle car? Draco has no idea. Luna rattles on and on about all the places they’ve been so far, and Draco tries to listen. But his mind is filled with his stupid actions. Why did he run away? Why can’t he enjoy the party and forget about the biggest failure in life? Why was he angry at Blaise? Draco has no idea anymore. Today is supposed to be about Teddy and his birthday. And Draco has ruined it, just like how he ruins everything else.
“I phoned in sick today,” Harry says from the doorway.
My whole body was in pain and I just couldn’t move anymore. Goyle left then, saying I would have sure learned my lesson by now. But Nott and Crabbe stayed. They walked up to me and started kicking me, first in my stomach and at my back. And after a while I felt Nott’s feet hit my head, breaking my glasses. The glass got stuck in my eye and I screamed from the pain. I passed out after the second kick against my head. I don’t know how long they continued after that. I only know that I woke up hours later in the hospital wing with a bandage on my eye and in a lot of pain.
It’s only since last weekend that everything seems to go wrong. It started last Saturday when I went out to fly my new broom, in the hope it would help me take my mind of Draco. It didn’t. All I could think of was how badly I wanted to fly together with him. He’s so talented on a broom. I’ve been coming to look at most of his Quidditch training. He’s noticed me there. He always looks around the stands until he finds me when he comes on the field and then just tries not to look at me for the entire training. Pansy and Daphne are also always at the training, cheering Draco on. I wish I could cheer with them. Hermione says I should stop going, that it’s not healthy. I should just forget about him and move on. Like it’s that easy. I still have the nightmares, only the situations keep changing. Sometimes we are sitting in the Great Hall having dinner and I look away for a second and then Draco is gone. I then run out of the Great Hall, looking for him, but he has just vanished. Or he’s playing Quidditch and suddenly his broom would be empty. I hate them, the nightmares. What if they are a bad omen? Like my nightmares from last year, that warned me about the danger that was coming? What if Draco really is going to disappear? I don’t think I want to live in a world that doesn’t have Draco in it.
“He hates his son and everything that will make him happy,” Harry says. His voice is soft and he doesn’t lift his hands to speak with him. Sirius will be upset about it, but Harry doesn’t care at this moment. Draco was scared. Harry thought it wouldn’t be all that bad. But now he knows that Draco was right. Draco will have a horrible summer. And that is mostly Harry’s fault.
“How’s Scorpius?” Harry asks.
“Do you think it would have been a boy or a girl?” Harry asks.
"Kind of, you've met your mother," Harry says.
Draco is silent. Harry thinks he hasn't spoken to anyone at all since they arrived. Blaise tried to ask him how he was doing when they had just arrived, but Draco hadn't responded. He stared at his hand, just like now. He watches as his finger scratches open his left forearm again. Harry wants to reach out and stop him from hurting himself.
“How do you?” Harry starts. No other words follow. How does Hermione know this? She hasn’t been in the library. Or did she see Harry there and just first wanted to talk to him alone before ratting him out to their friends?
“Okay,” Harry says as he stops in the middle of the field. He hands Draco a broom and places his own next to him on the ground. “Flying is easy once you get the hang of it. We just need to get you in the air first.”
“No,” Harry says. They walk in silence for some time. Harry is grateful that Hermione doesn’t force him to talk. He doesn’t know if he ever wants to talk again. It’s not like he says what he wants to anyway. And that is the problem, isn’t it? He tried to talk to Malfoy. But instead of saying what he wanted, he blurted out more hateful words. It’s just that Malfoy makes his blood boil. In both a good and a bad way. It messes with Harry’s head and he just can’t get the words out.
But the worsted of the night happened when Hermione and I left the party. We were halfway the hallway towards the stairs to the entrance hall when I heard that voice again. You remember, the one I heard when I had detention with Professor Lockhart. It said it was hungry and that it was time to kill. It was moving upwards and I ran after the sound, up the stairs, into the entrance hall, and then up to the first floor. Hermione followed me and it became clear quickly that she couldn’t hear the voice. I told her it was going to kill someone. It was saying it smelled blood and I was afraid I would be too late to stop it. I ran after it, turning corners until I arrived into a deserted passage. And there it was, written on the wall: The chamber of secrets has been opened. Enemies of the heir, beware. And Filch cat Mrs Norris was hanging underneath it, stiff as a board, her eyes wide and staring. I wanted to help, but Hermione said we needed to get out of there.
Don’t be ridiculous, you could never afford it with your allowance.
“And what if it is because I died during the war? What if it’s because I once housed a part of Voldemort’s soul inside my body? Who knows how that fucked me up,” Harry says.
I thought of Draco, far away at the Hogwarts grounds. He would feel the pain and despair I’d lived through during the second tasks. He would be incomplete for the rest of his life. And I would do that to him. Tears fell from my eyes, knowing I would hurt him more than anyone could ever do. He would be alone and broken. I wished I could have held him one last time, kissed his lips goodbye and watch him sleep next to me.
Harry James Potter.
“Well,” Harry starts. “There’s something I want all of you to know. Something that’s been on my mind lately.”
Draco opens his eyes again. Harry has turned around on the bed, so he’s facing Draco. He looks excited as if he found the answer to all their questions.
‘Which idiot thought it was a smart idea to make please and thank you the same?’ Malfoy writes down.
And that is how he ends up chasing towards the snitch in heavy rain. And how Harry speeds up from the other side of the pitch. They both reach for the snitch at the same time, both of them unable to stop the collision that follows. Harry’s broom breaks and falls to the ground. Draco lets go of the snitch and grabs Harry’s arm, slides of his broom and ends up hanging underneath it with Harry’s arm in his other hand.
Harry shakes his head. He knows that Iris will be fine. She’s an independent girl. And too smart for her own good. But this year is different. There is a real treat now. It’s not the same as first year when the enemy was close but unable to touch them. And it’s different from last year when the Basilisk terrorised the school. No, this year, Neville, Harry and Iris are the targets. The reason why the enemy is here. And no matter how smart or clever Iris is, she is an idiot when it comes to understanding the danger she’s in.
Blaise’s eyes stay on Draco, and Harry feels grateful knowing he's not the only one concerned about Draco's wellbeing. And it’s a legitimate question. One Harry has been asking himself for weeks now.
Oh, I also need to tell you about something weird. Professor Snape thinks that Draco and I stole the Gillyweed and Boomslang skin from his office. I tried to explain that Dobby stole the Gillyweed, that he gave it to me. But that didn’t convince Professor Snape. He said he would have no other choice but to report us if we would brake into his office again.
Harry slams his book shut. “Couldn’t even if I wanted to.”
Draco took it upon himself to inform his father about his success in potions. He was top of his class for this subject, he made sure the Mudblood wouldn’t beat him there. His father praised his good grades, but he didn’t invite Draco to join him in his dungeon. It was a disappointment and Draco sulked in his room for hours.
She lay utterly still, her eyes open and glassy. It was like she was carved out of stone. Professor Snape said she was found near the library and I think he wanted to say more, but I couldn’t stay there. She’s petrified. I’m all alone now. So I ran, down the stairs, out the oak doors and over the grass, until I tripped. I didn’t want to get up. Not now I had lost my best and only friend.
Harry looks up at him and shakes his head. “Don’t. Please don’t. This is not your fault.”
Harry nods and then puts his hand on hers. “He’s not going to hurt any of us,” he says. “We won’t let him.”
Harry pushes his shoulder against Draco. “I’m glad I didn’t,” he says. “And your father is wrong. You can talk. We’re having a conversation right now. And you see things, notice things that others don’t. You hear with your eyes and that is amazing.”
“Yes, Harry, we’re going to the Quidditch World Cup final,” James says. He’s got a massive grin on his face.
When we stepped over the threshold into the next room a purple fire sprang up behind us and black flames shot up in the doorway leading onward. We were trapped. In the middle of the room was a table with seven differently shaped bottles. There was a riddle on a piece of parchment next to the bottles. Hermione figured it out. She said it wasn’t magical, but logical, like a puzzle. She figured out which bottle held the potion to get us through the black fire and which one would be able to take us back. The one for the black fire only had enough potion left for one person, so I made Hermione go back. That way she could take Ron on one of the broomsticks out of the trapdoor and past Fluffy. I told her to go to the owlery and send Hedwig to headmaster Dumbledore. Hermione dashed at me and threw her arms around me and then she took the potion and walked straight through the purple fire.
“Cool gift,” Neville says. He turns another page and continues to find his mysterious snake.
* * *
“So, he is?” Hermione asks. “He is a.” She looks around them. There are too many people here to say it out loud. “You know what I mean,” she finishes.
“Yeah, of course, you didn’t mean too,” Draco cuts in. “You never mean any off it. You don’t mean to be rude to Harry, you don’t mean to tease Teddy to the point where he doesn’t like you, and you don’t mean to be the biggest slut I know. And you never mean to hurt me, but you do it anyway,” Draco shouts.
“You know this,” Harry says. “They’re not Pettigrew. They’re our Sirius and Remus.”
Voldemort wanted to prove to his followers that I was no match for him, so he ordered Wormtail to set me free and give me my wand. It hurt like hell when I had to stand on my broken leg again. I don’t know how I managed it, but I did. Not that it mattered. I knew I was no match for someone like Voldemort. He hit me again and again with the Cruciatus curse. The pain was unbearable. And the feelings I felt through my connection with Draco made it even worse. He was hurting too because of this. He could feel my pain and be unable to stop it.
Draco will be lonely in the Slytherin dungeon. He only has friends in Gryffindor. It’s unfair that he can’t stay with them, just because some stupid hat made him go to Slytherin. Which is a mystery on its own. Draco is more Ravenclaw and Gryffindor than Slytherin. The house doesn’t seem to fit Draco at all. But still, he got sorted into that house.
I’ve survived my first week and weekend at Hogwarts. After that first Monday, I made sure I woke up every morning before my classmates to shower and have breakfast in peace. And then I would hide out in an alcove until it was time to go to class. But it was hard to avoid Malfoy and Nott during class. On Tuesday Malfoy made sure he was sitting next to me during Charms and History of Magic. In Charms, he kept pushing my feather that we are using to learn the levitation charm off my table. And during History of Magic, he was shoving his elbow against me all the time, so it was hard to take notes.
Harry laughs out loud until he spots Mrs Prince on the other side of the clearing with tables. He pushes his hand in front of his mouth and hopes that Mrs Prince will leave them be. She shakes her head and then walks away without saying a word.
Draco watches as the confusions on Harry’s face slowly fades and how his eyes light up and sparkle behind his glasses. “You’re pregnant?” Harry asks in a small voice. Draco nods in confirmation. “We’re going to have a baby?” Harry continues and Draco nods again. It’s a treat to see the pure joy on Harry’s face and to see him inch forwards to catch Draco’s lips in a kiss.
Hermione shouted at Lupin, she was livid. She screamed that she didn’t tell anyone, that she covered for him. And Draco chipped in, that he too had kept his mouth shut because he knew it would hurt me if he would have told anyone that Professor Lupin was a werewolf. They had a whole discussion about when they both had found out and that Dumbledore and the staff already know that he’s a werewolf. In the end, Lupin said that Dumbledore had to work very hard to convince some staff members that he’s trustworthy and I shouted at him that Dumbledore was wrong. That Lupin had been helping Black all the time.
When the show is over, the others move back into the house. Harry takes Draco’s hand and leads him further away from the house. He smiles and lets his free hand brush the leaves of some bushes they pass.
"Fine, I'll tell her. And what about Teddy? He's staying at yours, isn't he?" Ron asks.
Harry laughs out loud, and Draco chuckles without a sound. Harry sees a sparkle in Malfoy’s eyes and Harry’s stomach flips a little when he spots it. He closes his eyes briefly and shakes his head. He can’t get a proper crush on Malfoy. He’s supposed to help him, not scare him away. He focuses on the parchment between them and changes the subject.
Dear mom and dad,
-x-x-x-x-x-
Harry isn’t sure if that is a good idea. Getting them both killed is not the best way to deal with heartache. But it will get their minds off it all. And Pettigrew needs to be found. They can see if they can figure out where he’s hiding. And then tell their dad. They won’t go after him but just look for him. That way they won’t technically break their promise.
Draco looks at the wine glass that Pansy had put down. There is no lipstick stain on it. “You’re not drinking your wine,” Draco whispers. No alcohol and confiding in Blaise first, Draco can only come up with one reason why Pansy would do both at the same time.
“He’s great. He started primary school this year and he loves it. I can’t believe he’s already five. And he’s growing. He’ll be taller than me before he even goes to Hogwarts if he keeps growing the way he does now,” Malfoy says as he sits down. “Now, where is my coffee?”
Neville nods his head. He knows. Harry blinks away a tear. Neville is willing to die if it means saving Draco. The fool is just as selfless as his parents were. He will protect the ones he loves above all. And because Draco is the person Harry loves, he’s become a part of the small circle for who Neville will give his life.
Love you,
“Is he dead?” Draco repeats. A little louder this time. He can deal with all the hateful words, take all of them. As long as Harry is still alive. That is all that matters. Granger can believe all she wants, blame Draco for all, if only she would tell him that Harry is still with them.
Ginny shrugs half-heartedly and then bumps her arm against Harry’s. “Luna says Iris is fitting in great, by the way,” she says.
Draco and Hermione have started researching again to help Hagrid with his case. I wish I could help them more, but Miss Davis is giving me more and more homework for therapy. Even though I tell her time and time again that I’m fine and that I don’t need her anymore. She seems to think that having Black around is making me more unstable. It really sucks. I don’t want to go and do all the work she’s giving me. I want to help Draco and Hermione so we can save Buckbeak.
And I must be honest; at that moment I didn’t believe I could be a wizard. If I had defeated a powerful wizard as a baby, then why had Dudley always been able to kick me around like a football? But Hagrid asked me if I ever made strange things happen and I remembered all the time's odd things had happened, like me talking to snakes and ending up on the roof of the school, and I knew he was telling the trued.
Neville sits down next to Harry. He places the latest issue of the Daily Prophet on Harry’s homework. The headline is clear. Pettigrew has been spotted in Hogsmeade again. The article doesn’t include much. Some local had spotted the man at the edge of the village. It was close to sundown, and it was hard to see, but the person is sure that it was Pettigrew. Harry believes the man. It’s clear that Pettigrew is close by. He’s been close for months. So why has nothing happened until now? And why is he here? Does he want to kill Neville or Sirius? Harry wishes he knew.
“I know,” Draco answers. “I didn’t want to get your hopes up for if I was wrong.” Draco knows how important a family is to Harry, how he wishes to have multiple children one day to love and cherish. He would have been so disappointed if it had just been a silly flu that made Draco so sick and tired.
“Harry, what happened? Are you okay?” Neville asks as he catches up with Harry.
After that things became a bit scary. Riddle asked me how I had defeated him before. He tried to keep me talking, but I knew that the longer it would all take, the more life was slipping from Draco’s body into Riddle. So I told him he was useless, that my muggle-born mother had saved me. Riddles concluded out of that that there was nothing special about me and send for the Basilisk. It came sliding out of the mouth of the statue that had opened wide to make a huge black hole. I shut my eyes and I could feel Fawkes take flight. I was going to die, I was sure of it. If Fawkes would take of what did I have to defend myself with?
“The most beautiful girl on the world,” Ron says from beside Draco.
Harry rubs his fist over his chest. “I’m sorry,” he says. And then he pulls the parchment to him again. ‘I’ve done something behind your back that I should have talked to you about first,’ he writes.
“I’m sorry, mom,” he whispers. It’s getting hard to keep his eyes open. So he closes them and lets the darkness take him.
* * *
Ron and Hermione shake their heads. They don’t agree with this newfound plan to find Pettigrew. Harry doesn’t care. It has helped him to keep his mind busy when he’s alone.
Harry lets go of Malfoy and Malfoy rests his fist on Harry’s chest again. Softer this time. It seems he’s given up. Malfoy shudders and large tears fall from his eyes. Harry doesn’t think and just wraps his arms around Malfoy’s body and pulls him against his chest.
And the article, you wouldn’t believe it if you read it. The only problem is, that most people do believe it. The article only focusses on me, it hardly on the TriWizard tournament. And Cedric isn’t even in it like he isn’t competing at all. Off course this pisses off everyone that isn’t a Slytherin. She made up most of it, quoting me on things I’ve never even said. Like how I get my strength from my parents and that I still cry about how you died. And she outed me and Draco to the entire wizarding world. I don’t know how she found out, but it was in the article how I was in a relationship with the young Mr Malfoy.
During the train ride, I bought a lot of candy from the trolley witch. I know I had said I wouldn’t spend all your money on useless things, but I was very hungry and I wanted to try out all the new strange candies. I shared my candy with Ron. He only had corned beef sandwiches and he doesn’t like corned beef. I liked the chocolate frogs the best, one they are chocolate and two they have cards of famous wizards. I now have cards of Albus Dumbledore, Morgana, Hengist of Woodcroft, Alberic Grunnion, Circe, Paracelsus, Merlin and Druidess Cliodna. I think I’m going to try to collect a lot of them. They will be able to keep me company when I feel alone.
“But that is not what you are concerned about, is it?” Remus asks.
“But Draco also needs to want to be yours for that to work,” Remus says. “And I’m sure that if he’s not your Sirius, there will be someone else for you.” Harry knows his uncle means well, but right now, Harry doesn’t even want to think of someone else. And truth be told, Harry doesn’t think he will ever want anyone else than Draco. The way he feels about him is the same as how James feels about Lily. Harry knows. Draco is the one for him. And if he can’t have Draco, he will have nobody.
“We’re in the lead. Go and find that Snitch before Warrington does real damage to Angelina,” he continues.
Harry shakes his head. The more he learns about Draco’s father, the more he hates the man. Does he truly expect all that from Draco? And it’s not even true. Draco is so capable of doing extraordinary magic. “Your grades are improving,” Harry signs. “And you did amazing magic tonight. Your father should be proud.”
"We won't, that's the whole point. It's destroying us, trying so hard. I want to have sex with you because we both want to, because we love each other. Not because we have to." Harry sounds so sure, so confident. Draco wants to say yes, he wants to find his way back to the time where they couldn’t keep their hands off each other. But that time is gone, and he knows it will never come back. Not until Draco can give Harry what he wants, what he needs. A child of his own.
“Shorten it, you mean?” Draco signs. He’s been able to keep up with conversations with more ease ever since Hermione started to get the hang of BSL. Ron’s signs are still horrible, but at least he tries.
-x-x-x-x-x-
“Yes, fuck, of course, I’m angry. I was told our baby will never get born, and then they tell us we have to sit around for another week just so that they can cover their asses. So yes, I’m angry,” Harry screams.
“Father will be upset,” Draco signs. “And I’ll have nobody to help me at home. None of the other elves are like Dobby.”
Harry, Ron, Neville and Hermione eat and joke around. Ron complains about his little sister and how she keeps interfering with his life. Harry ignores Lavender’s advances and Hermione is excited about all the subjects she’s taking this year. Before they even know it the meal has come to a close, Dumbledore has given his final warnings and they are off towards Gryffindor tower.
Malfoy stares at his hands for a second. He blinks with his eyes which start to water. Is Malfoy going to cry? Was Dobby that important to Malfoy?
If it hadn’t been for Myrtle showing up and showing me the way, I think I would have stayed on that spot and died there as soon as the Gillyweed stopped working. She led me almost all the way into the Mer-people’s village but had to turn around just before because she and the Merpeople don’t like each other. I continued by myself until I found Draco. He was tied to a statue of a Merman, and I sped towards him. I took his lulling face in my hands and just wished for a sign he was still alive. I hugged him and told him I was sorry, only no sound came from my mouth, just bubbles. I cried into Draco’s shoulder. I had found him, but he was still gone, the whole inside me was still there.
* * *
“That makes two of us, Malfoy.”
I did see him again a couple of times in the maze. The first time was when he jumped out of a corridor where he had encountered Hagrid’s Blast-Ended-Skrewts. He said they were enormous. This was around the same time I was wondering what the deal was, as I hadn’t run into any obstacles yet. I just felt like someone was watching me all the time. It was creepy.
“Yeah, that sucks,” James says. He pulls Harry against his side and squeezes his shoulder. “Still going to be an amazing birthday party. All your other friends will be there. I know it’s hard to believe, but the entire world doesn’t revolve around Draco. You are allowed to have fun without him.”
Harry sits up a little straighter. “What kind of theories?” he asks.
Harry puts his diary away and looks at his friends. They sit in the Great Hall, finishing up some homework before dinner starts. It started with just Harry, Draco, Neville, Hermione and Ron. But just a few minutes ago Ginny and Luna joined them. It’s still more than half an hour until dinner, but it seems the Great Hall is already filling up. Ever since the Christmas decorations went up last weekend it’s the favourite spot for most students to do their homework.
“Shut up, Ginny,” Neville tells her. “Just hold on a second.”
They left me alone during Herbology since Ron had pulled me to their side of the greenhouse. He said he wished I was in Gryffindor with him. But we didn’t have a lot of time to catch up, because professor Sprout gave a lecture about Herbology safety. After class, I walked with the Gryffindor’s to our last lesson of the day, Transfiguration. This is taught by Professor McGonagall. She’s a strict and clever teacher. This class I was able to sit down next to Zabini. Like I told you before, he’s the only Slytherin boy that doesn’t bully me. We had to take a lot of notes and at the end of class, we tried to turn a match into a needle. Only the smart Gryffindor girl had made any progress. Her match was silver and pointy.
“You’re good?” he asks when Harry closes the door behind him.
When we (Hermione, Ron, Neville and I) got to Hagrid’s hut all the curtains were closed and Hagrid even asked who it was before he let us in. I asked him about the stone and if he knew what else was guarding it, but Hagrid didn’t know. He only told us, after Hermione flattered him, that some professor’s helped with the guarding. Most of them are fine professors, but Snape was one of them. And I’m still sure he wants to steal the stone. And if he helped with the guarding, he might even know how to get past the other spells and protections in place. But Hagrid promised us that only he and Dumbledore know how to get past Fluffy, so I think the stone is safe for now.
The answer is simple. Draco signs: “Dad.” And then he looks away and out of the window. Harry follows his gaze. The sky is black and the lights reflect in the window.
Draco looks at his arm. The mark faded over the years to just some red lines on his pale skin. Draco remembers when Voldemort burned it into his skin, how it flared black before turning red. Aunt Bella had given Draco some pain potions before the act, said it would make things easier. It had still been painful but bearable. It was the start of the slide down. The potions had helped then. Helped him sleep, helped him forget, helped him to stop feeling anything at all.
“What is Uncle Sirius up to at work?” Harry asks. “I’ve never seen him this busy.”
I was panicking. I could run and no one would ever know I had been there. But I also couldn’t just leave them there. I had to get help. But who would believe I didn’t do it? I was so lost. What was I supposed to do? And then Peeves came by and saw the bodies next to me. He started screaming: ATTACK! Attack! No mortal or ghost is safe, run for your lives. And of course that made every door in the hallway crash open and students were coming in from all directions. It wasn’t until Professor McGonagall came on the scene and she had ordered everyone back into class that I dared to move. Professor McGonagall looked at me and told me to follow her. I tried to tell her that I hadn’t done it, but she said it was out of her hands. And then she took me to headmasters Dumbledore’s office.
The trip down to the potion lap is short. Harry stops in front of the door. Maybe Malfoy isn’t in yet. Maybe Harry can go in and see Malfoy has the day off and then he will have him as a friend for one more day.
Together they leave the common room and walk down the stairs. They go outside and walk towards the lake without exchanging a word.
“You’re not a prat,” Neville says.
“Yes, he possessed Ginny and made her open the Chamber of Secrets. He almost killed her to come back to life,” Harry says.
And I don’t know why Draco is doing this, but it hurts. I feel so sad all the time now. Did I do something wrong? Had he expected me to do something while still on the train home last July, or was I supposed to send him a letter straight away to tell him I also like him? Or was it all just a joke? A nice way of bullying silly Harry some more? Was he never really my friend, but just pretending?
Neville shakes his head. “I would have saved her even when I wasn’t the Chosen One.”
But back to my birthday. We had breakfast and then Draco and I just hanged out in the garden. The family Tonks and Professor Lupin, who keeps insisting I call him Remus or Moony, joined us. Mrs Tonks had baked a cake for my party and prepared all these crazy dishes for lunch. It was nice to see Sirius light up with Remus around.
“I’m scared too,” Harry says. “Scared of what is expected of me, scared of losing my friends, of putting the people I care about in danger. But most of all I’m scared of losing you.”
By this time Draco was studying the withered hand on the cushion. Mr Borgin said it is a Hand of Glory, a best friend of thieves and plunderers. He also complimented Mr Malfoy on his son’s fine taste. Mr Malfoy answered that his son’s taste needed improving, just like his grades. Malfoy turned to the window and I think he almost started to cry there in the shop. He let out a small ‘I’m sorry, father’ and I felt sorry for him when his father told him it was a disgrace that a girl of no wizard family beat him in every exam.
The next room smelled disgusting because it housed a gigantic troll, one even bigger than the one we defeated last Halloween. It was already out cold and we were both glad we didn’t need to fight it.
I know I like it when he holds my hand. And I know that kiss made my heart pound in my throat. And I miss him really bad. I want to talk to him, see him. I want to stroke my hand through his blond hairs when they fall in front of his face. I even dream about him. Does this all mean that I like him? And that I’m a poof? Because I’ve been kind of thinking about what it would be like if he would really kiss me, on the lips, not just on my cheek. And I think I would like it. I think I really do like him. I really like him, as in I want him to be my boyfriend like him.
“Yes, I do,” Harry says. “I have the hots for Draco Malfoy. You’re happy now?” he snaps. Harry drops his head backwards and looks at the sky. Some clouds have hidden the sun that was shining this morning. It’s a shame. Draco’s hair always lights up so beautifully in the sunlight.
Only Draco doesn’t look up. His shoulders shudder. And Harry can’t have that. He steps off his bed and walks to the other side of the room. He stops in front of Draco’s bed. Draco cries and Harry wants to hug him. Harry lifts his arm and reaches out. Softly he ticks on Draco’s shoulder.
Black then told me that he would never betray the two of you and I believed him. I couldn’t speak, my whole world had been turned upside down again so I just nodded. Pettigrew fell down on his knees after that and started to beg Black to remember that they are friends, and he pleaded with Lupin to believe him. At the same time, Black and Lupin looked at each other. Black said he was sorry for never telling Lupin that he wasn’t the secret keeper, and Lupin said he was sorry for ever believing Black was capable of betraying you. And then they decided they would kill him together. They threw Pettigrew onto the floor and asked him if he had sold you out to Voldemort. Pettigrew started crying and he confessed he did it. Black and Lupin raised their wand and I knew they were going to kill him. But if they did, nobody would ever believe that Black was innocent.
“No clue, just a piece of fabric,” Harry answers.
I told them how you helped me get away. I was able to escape because of you. I told them about Cedric’s final request, and then I just couldn’t continue. It was all too much. Sirius put his arm around me and hugged me as best he could, without disturbing Draco. And then headmaster Dumbledore let Madam Pomfrey heal my leg and give me some dreamless sleep. Before I fell asleep, Professor Snape told me he would inform my friends that I was okay and that they could wait till morning before visiting me.
Harry turns around to continue his track down the carriage to look for Iris. He only makes it two steps before a force hits him in the chest. Platinum blond hair and angry grey eyes are in front of Harry’s face. Malfoy’s fists slam against Harry’s chest, over and over. Harry tries to get a hold of Malfoy’s hands to stop the assault.
I want it to stop. I want it all to stop. It’s a good thing most children are going home for Christmas tomorrow because I can’t do it any longer. There is not a single person in this school that doesn’t think I’m the one causing the attacks now. Another boy has been petrified, together with Nearly Headless Nick. I would never hurt Nick, he’s a friendly ghost. He even helped me at the beginning of the year when Filch was trying to give me detention because he had left mud on the floor. And he was so nice to invite me to his party. Why would I hurt him? But nobody seems to care about that. No, they only see the boy who can talk to snakes and has been spotted at the scene of the crime, twice. And I was missing for the other one, so it must be me. But I’m not doing this. I promise mom, I’m not.
After that, Draco and I danced some more and then we went for a walk outside to have some privacy so we could kiss. On our way to a private spot, we overheard Karkaroff talk to Professor Snape. It turns out that he was extremely insulted by the fact that Hogwarts would let two boys dance together. Professor Snape told him to start living in the now instead of in the past and let us be, that he had no idea what he was talking about. We both duck out of the way and hid behind a bush when they passed us. I think Professor Snape did see us, but after the conversation he’d just had, I think he thought it was wise not to point us out and duck points for kissing in the yard.
And so, the plan is formed. It’s not enough, Harry knows this, but it’s a start. And once Malfoy realises that he needs Harry’s help, Harry can start and teach him how to communicate with others. They’ll become friends and Malfoy won’t be lonely anymore. Harry lays down in the grass and stares at the blue sky. Maybe this year is not going to suck after all.
I told Lupin to proof to us that Scabbers was Peter. Lupin pointed his wand towards Scabbers and after a flash of blue-white light, Scabbers body started twisting madly in Ron’s hand. Ron dropped him and after another flash of light, Scabbers turned into a man. Peter started to beg for Lupin to believe him that Sirius was there to kill him and that he should help him. That he’d been scared for twelve years, afraid Black would come after him and kill him for real. But Sirius interrupted him, said he wasn’t afraid of him but of the supporters of Voldemort who think Peter double-crossed them.
Lucius stops and turns around. He doesn’t face Lily head-on, but stays at an angle, ready to continue his walk away from them all. “No, you may not,” he sneers. “We want nothing to do with blood traitors like you.”
Thanks for all the Kudos and comments! I just saw that I have a hundred kudos on this story already and I just love it, so thanks everyone for reading, leaving kudos and commenting.
“I know,” Harry says. He looks at his hand held by his father’s. “It’s something I’ve known for a while now. I just never said it out loud.”
Hi everyone, sorry it took so long since my last upload. Our internet provider decided to break a cable somewhere and we have been without internet for over more than a week. :( We're back online now, and you get rewarded with the longest letter as to date.
“That’s just sick,” Neville says. “Remus, why are they letting those creatures on a train filled with teenagers?”
Hagrid caught up with us and we told him what we had seen. I asked him what it was, but Hagrid didn’t’ know. Draco said it must have been weak, to drink unicorn blood, because it would keep it alive but that it would also curse it. That the creature must be very afraid to die. Hermione had joined us and said something that made me think. She said that it would be bad unless you only needed to stay alive long enough to drink something else that will make sure you can never die. She was talking about the sorcerer’s stone, I’m sure. It makes the elixir of life. But who would be so weak they would need unicorn blood to stay alive?
Ginny is okay now, George told me she is just sad that I don’t fancy her, but that she will get over it. I hope she does, I never mend to hurt her. He and Fred also assured me that Ron will come around, probably very quickly because my new broom is scheduled to arrive tomorrow. I’m glad the twins don’t treat me any differently than before. They are asleep now, it’s already very late, but I just can’t sleep. I keep thinking about how Draco didn’t say one word to me. I want him to talk to me. I don’t want to have to share a dorm room with him this year and not be able to fall down on his bed to complain about Hermione her study schedules. Or not get his help with Potions, he’s been the only one who has been able to make that subject make sense for me. And I want to see him smile at me, I want him to hold my hand during breakfast and dinner. And I want to hear him complain about headmaster Dumbledore and Professor McGonagall and how they always seem to favour Gryffindor students. But it looks like I won’t have all that this year and now I don’t know if I want to go back to Hogwarts. Because it’s just going to hurt, seeing him without being able to hang out with him. I’m afraid it’s going to be worse than just missing him.
‘Maybe not for you,’ Draco writes.
Our house won the house cup. Mainly because of how good we did with Quidditch and Draco and I got treads from a lot of housemates during the end of year feast. Marcus even thank us for making his dream come true to go out as a winning Quidditch captain. Adrian and Miles laughed like two lunatics when that happened. We also had a vote as a team to pick our new captain and Draco won that easily. He’s up in the clouds about that, still can’t believe it half of the time, asking me if it’s really true. I’m really proud of him. He deserves the position, he’s the best player on our team.
“You really should try harder to be nice to him, Pansy,” Draco tells her.
‘Doing my homework. And you?’ Harry writes. With a grin, he pushes the note back to Malfoy.
“You won’t, Harry. But you have to be firm. You have to tell him to get help. You know just as well as us that this can’t continue. It’s not healthy, Harry,” Hermione tells him.
Someone is pulling on Harry’s sleeve. He must have fallen asleep last night. He slowly opens his eyes to see Dobby standing bend over him.
James snorts. “Oh my,” he says. “So you’re in love with a boy who wants to date girls, and Neville is falling for a girl who wants to date girls. What did I do wrong? Where did I fail as your parent?”
“It’s okay, Hermione,” Harry says. He’s ready to take whatever punishment they want to give him. It’s not like he has anything left to live for.
“You’ll be fine,” Harry tells him.
Iris smiles, gets up and walks over to the Ravenclaw table. She waves towards Harry and Neville and then sits down between her new housemates. Harry slumps in his seat and stares at the Ravenclaw table. “She can’t be,” he whispers.
“I know it’s none of my business, but shouldn’t that boy be in bed by now?” Pansy asks. She nods her head towards the other side of the room where Teddy sits with his tong halfway out of his mouth, a crayon in his hand and his favourite colouring book of the moment in front of him.
Iris just shakes her head and then stares at Harry again. Her eyebrows are raised. “Neville, what’s wrong with Harry? He’s too happy,” she says.
Charlie was willing to take the dragon and even had a plan to get it to Romania. Some friends of him would come this Saturday night to the tallest tower of Hogwarts to take him away when it was still dark. Hermione sends an answer right away since Ron couldn’t write because of the bite to his hand. They were just wondering how we would get the dragon up to the tower without anyone seeing us. I knew we could use the invisibility cloak, but that mend I had to tell them about it. And I trust them, Hermione the most, but it was my secret. A secret only Draco knew about.
Things are a little better than they were the last time I wrote to you. After I had been locked up for three days I woke up from a horrible dream to find Ron Weasley outside my window. I was so happy to see his freckled-face, his red hair and long nose. I hurried to the window and opened it so we could talk. My mouth fell open when I saw that he was hanging out of the back window of an old turquoise car, which was parked in mid-air. Ron’s twin brothers Fred and George were grinning at me from the front seats.
“He never saw it coming,” the Dark Lord comments. “Brilliant. And not a single spell was fired. So clever.”
“Nobody,” Neville says. His cheeks turn red and Harry shakes his head. He signs ‘Ginny’ and Neville nods.
“Why?” Draco asks.
The topic of conversation switches back to Ron’s holiday to Egypt after that. Wood stops by at some point to tell Harry Quidditch practice starts this Saturday at eleven since their first game will be against Slytherin. There will be no time to relax into the season, and Harry is fine with that. The amount of Quidditch he gets to play is the best part of being at school.
Of course, Draco was really surprised to see me sneak into his room yesterday, but he didn’t hesitate for one moment, he just lifted his blanket and let me crawl into bed with him. He asked me if he was dreaming. I told him I was really here. Then he asked me why I was at his house and I told him that I had run away and that I was afraid that I won’t be going back to Hogwarts because I did magic. Draco said it would be okay, that the Ministry would understand that it was an accident and that I shouldn’t worry. He kissed me then and that made my worries ebb away. I fell asleep in his arm and woke up with him staring at me. It was really nice.
“I’m scared,” Draco signs. He looks at his hands as if he’s surprised he’d just told them.
Tuesday 18 May 1993
Charlie opens the door when they reach it. Teddy asks about the dragons in Romania and throws his jacket and scarf towards Harry so he can follow Charlie into the living room to hear the story of how Charlie has gotten his latest scar. The friendly noise of people flows into the hallway from the living room. Harry shakes his head with a smile on his face while he places Teddy’s jacket on the pile of coats already in the hallway.
The next day I spent a lot of time on braiding Draco’s hair. I was so nervous that the hair kept slipping through my shaking fingers. When it was finally done we went down to the Great Hall as a team. The Slytherin table applauded us on our entrance. It was nice to see how the entire house was supporting us, especially because the Ravenclaws and Hufflepuffs had cheered for the Gryffindor team when they walked in. Only Luna had touched up her outfit with the Slytherin colours. She smiled at us when we left the Great Hall.
“What am I doing wrong?” Ron asks.
Your Harry James Potter.
“Today we welcome a new member in our midst. One who did us all a great favour,” the Dark Lord says. “He’s still young. Only fifteen, and already a devoted follower.” The Dark Lord pauses. He walks through the room. Draco stays where he is. He watches as the others follow the Dark Lords steps. If Draco was as strong as Harry thought he was, he would now take out his wand and cast the killing curse. He would destroy the Dark Lord and stop this war before it even begins. Only, Draco is no hero. He’s a coward and just stands there and waits for the inevitable.
Harry pushes Neville to the side. “Don’t be an ass,” he says. “Just because I’ve got a crush doesn’t make him gay.”
Draco opens the bottle of champagne and fills their glasses. He hands the bottle off to Pansy, who claims she won’t part with it anymore until she’s off to her other party, the one with all the handsome single men before Draco turns to Harry. “I love that table too much to give it up,” he tells Harry.
Harry knows he’s not dead. He can hear Iris' soft cries and Hermione telling her everything will be all right. Ron complains that he’ll be late for dinner. If this was heaven, they all wouldn’t be here. And his body hurts too much for it to be dead. His back aches and his head is pounding. Maybe if Ron would just shut up about dinner.
Harry looks up. James has circles under his eyes and his eyebrows are drawn together. “I’m okay, Dad,” Harry says. He wants to wipe the worried look from his father’s face, but he knows how bad his fall was. He thought himself that he was going to die when he was racing towards the ground.
“What do you mean of course?” Ron asks. “Don’t you think you already have enough on your plate with all the subjects you’re taking this year?”
‘What does it feel like to fly?’ he asks.
“Ron already thinks I’m seeing someone,” Harry says without looking at Hermione. “I don’t want him to get the wrong idea. He’ll just make fun of it.”
“And one day you will be,” Andromeda says. “Now who wants one of those delicious cookies Harry has baked for us?”
Harry blushes even more. “It’s complicated.”
Remus sighs. “You know I will.”
Harry scratches the back of his neck as a soft smile forms on his face. “I miss you,” he signs.
“Oh, don’t get me wrong. I will miss the little bugger. But it’s better for him. I’m getting too old for this. I won’t be able to play with him as you and Harry can. And he will still be here every other week. It’s not like I have to give him up completely.”
It had been beautiful. Harry wishes he had recorded it so he could listen to it one last time, the song Draco wrote just for him. Instead, the piano disappears and Harry falls on his knees on the empty spot.
“Anything interesting in the bushes?” Harry asks.
* * *
“She’s so beautiful,” Draco whispers.
Draco pulls back and drops his hands. He looks broken. Harry can’t have him be broken. He needs to get his body to work. He needs to do something. Anything. Draco just kissed him. And now he’s pulling back, afraid he’s done something wrong. Harry needs to let him know it’s good. It was perfect. He snaps out of it, grabs the front of Draco’s nightshirt and pulls him towards him. Their lips brush again. And this time Harry makes sure that Draco knows that Harry wants this. More than anything he’s ever wanted before. Their mouths melt together and the world is perfect.
Don’t get mad, but I’ve gotten myself in trouble and have to serve detention sometime soon. I promise it was for a good reason. We had to save Hagrid’s dragon, but we got caught by Professor McGonagall.
They walk by Remus and Sirius’ home on the way to the park. A small basket is set next to the gate. Harry lets go of Draco’s hand and picks it up. Draco smiles at Harry and signs: “Are we having a picnic?”
“Oh, look the gays are sticking up for each other,” the Auror says.
“I thought,” Harry mutters. “I thought Neville was dead.”
I made up a silly lie when Quirrell asked me what I had seen and he started staring into the mirror again himself. I tried to walk away, but the voice was back, screaming I lied. And then it said it wanted to speak to me. I was rooted to my spot while Quirrell reached up and unwrapped his turban and turned around. I couldn’t make a sound, I was so scared. There, on the back of Quirrell’s head was a face, the most terrible face I’ve ever seen. It was chalk white with glaring red eyes and slits for nostrils, like a snake. It whispered my name. I tried to take a step backwards, but my legs wouldn’t move. The face started talking, telling me how it had stayed alive and then told me to give him the stone that was inside my pocket.
"Fuck it, Draco. I'm just trying to get in the mood," Harry snaps. He turns away from Draco and stares at the ceiling. Draco signs and puts his hand on Harry’s chest.
Hi Mom & Dad,
On the evening before the task, we still hadn’t found a way for me to breath underwater. Hermione, Draco and I were buried between books that all seemed useless. And even if we would find a spell, I would still need to learn it overnight. If it wasn’t for the fact that I had no choice but to go into that water I would have given up. Especial when Greg and Daphne stopped by, saying that Professor Snape wanted to see Draco in his office. Draco kissed me and told me to take as many books with me to the dormitory, that we would look the entire night if have to. And then he left, leaving just me and Hermione. Until Fred and George Weasley told Hermione that Professor McGonagall wanted to see her. I kept looking until Madam Pince kicked me out of the library. I took as many books with me that I could carry and settled at a table in the common room to try and find an answer to the most pressing question of the day.
Harry laughs. “I didn’t think you were a drama queen, Hermione,” he says.
“We’ve got the champagne,” Seamus shouts as he follows Draco into the living room. He starts to hand out glasses and rushes everyone to gather. Harry slips his arm around Draco’s waist while he holds out his glass for Draco to fill with the champagne.
The first night I spend back in my own bed I woke up again from one of my nightmares. The once with Draco disappearing all the time. Draco read some of my letters to you and knew what was going on, so he climbed into my bed and hugged me until I stopped crying and had fallen back to sleep. Ever since then he just crawls into my bed in the evening and his presence, warm and safe against my back, with his arm around my stomach, it helps me sleep through the night.
Monday 29 June 1992
“I missed you too, Teddy. Did you have a good time with your grandma Andromeda?”
“What the bloody hell,” Harry shouts. “What the fuck is wrong with you?”
Harry drops his bag and shakes his head. “You didn’t. The miscarriage wasn’t your fault. I never blamed you for it, nobody did.”
“I know what I’m going to tell you in a moment isn’t going to sound like good news, but I have to stress that it is, in fact, good news,” she tells them.
Sometime later, more familiar footsteps make their way towards them. Harry is on his feet before Ron is even in view. And when they look at each other, they share massive grins. Draco bites his lip not to say something mean. He wants to hurt Ron, make him less happy. He wants Harry to feel pain.
They fall silent. It’s twisted. But isn’t it the same as what Harry did? Draco never gave any sign of being gay, and still, Harry hit on him. Tried to kiss him even. Of course, Draco doesn’t want to have anything to do with Harry anymore. Just as Harry doesn’t want to hang out with Lavender and Parvati. He’s been such a fool. It all makes sense now. If only it would hurt less now that it does. But the pain in Harry’s heart doesn’t seem to go away. Or leave him alone. It’s all he can think about.
‘But we do know,’ he writes. ‘Nothing to change about that now.’
It’s the last straw. Harry stands up and walks towards the man, his wand already in his hand.
Professor Moody didn’t deny it. He took credit for his handy work. He wanted to know if Voldemort forgave the other Death Eaters, the ones that never went to Azkaban, or even searched for their lord. He was the one who concurred the Dark Mark in the sky during the Quidditch World Cup. And he made sure I would win the Tournament. He manipulated me all year and he is the one who used the Imperius curse on Viktor during the final task. Viktor didn’t attack Cedric because he wanted to win that badly, he wasn’t in control.
“Albus, I told you this was insane. Malfoy has nothing to do with Potter. I don’t see why he should risk anything for him,” Professor Snape says. Dumbledore answers something, Draco is sure, but his eyes are fixed on Granger. She refuses to look at Draco. Draco is sure she knows why he would be the person that Potter will miss the most. If only Draco would be able to talk to her for a second. Because it can’t be that he likes Draco, can it? That would be insane.
“They say she kissed Luna Lovegood,” Harry says.
I’ll keep you informed of how my holiday is going and will let you know as soon as I know how Draco is doing.
Your Harry James Potter.
Finally, after another corner, I came to a solid wall on which two entwined serpents were carved. I told them in Parseltongue to open. The serpents parted as the wall cracked open, the halves sliding smoothly out of sight and I walked inside. By then I was shaking and terrified of what I would find.
I’m sitting in the Quidditch stands by the way. Today are the tryouts for the Slytherin team and Draco is one of the candidates. He saw me sitting here, I know he did, even though he pretends like I don’t exist. It’s nice to see him fly. He is a lot better than the other kids trying out and I think he can be sure that he will get a spot on the team. I hope he does, it was something he really wanted last year. I hope he will hang back afterwards and maybe talk to me. We’ll see.
“If I go see a mind healer, will you stay. Will you stay with me?” Draco asks.
Sirius gave me the sex talk. It was awkward, he stumbled over his words and I just wanted the ground below me to open up and swallow me whole. He said you would have given me the talk too if you were still alive dad, and Sirius wanted to make sure I was safe and protected. He asked me if Draco and I had already done anything more than kiss and I didn’t know what to say. He took my silence as a yes and said he knows forbidding me to do anything while Draco is here is useless, that he was young once too. So instead he thought me how to cast a strong silencing charm and gave me a book that explains spells that can help when penetrating each other.
Harry scrapes his throat and that puts a stop to the snugging. But they still stare at each other. Is this truly what it looks like when people are in love? Is that how Harry looks at Malfoy? Harry hopes it isn’t. That would make everything even worse.
Malfoy presses his lips together and his eyes narrow. The grey in them darkens and Harry swallows at the sight. Malfoy pulls the parchment away from Harry and pushes his quill onto it. When Harry gets the parchment back the writing is bolder than before. The words ‘you didn’t’ hit home. Harry wants to reach out and touch Malfoy, to let him know that Harry never meant to make it worse.
With a shock, the train stops. Harry turns his head just in time to see Malfoy fall towards him. Harry catches him and helps him back on his feet. “Are you okay?” he signs again, already shaking his head when he’s only halfway through the sentence. “I know, you don’t understand. Can you at least smile at me to let me know you’re okay?” Harry asks.
“Who are you and what did you do to my best friend?” Ron asks.
‘Is this about Dobby?’ Harry writes with dread. Dobby wanted to be a free elf. Harry made sure he got that freedom. But at what cost came that freedom?
Apart from the Patronus lessons, I also have a lot of Quidditch practice. Gryffindor has won their game against Ravenclaw and Marcus has scheduled in even more practice. We now train four nights a week. And I also still have my therapy sessions with Ms Davis. It’s hard to find time to do my homework. I have no time at all to help Draco with his research for Buckbeak’s trial. I ask Ms Davis how long I still need to go to therapy, that I was doing great and wasn’t sad anymore and all. But she still thinks I need to come by, to talk about everything that has happened to me in my short life. Draco says I should talk to Professor Snape about it, see what he thinks. And I think I will do that soon. I hate having so little free time.
You remember me telling you that Malfoy and Nott had started using jinxes on me, like the tripping jinx and the leg-locker curse. Well, Malfoy stopped that after our fight at the Quidditch game, but Nott only tried harder to get me to trip or fall over because my legs would get locked together. And when nobody else was around he would give me a good kick before he would move on. Until it became more than just making me trip. One evening I was walking from the library to the dungeon and Nott, Crabbe and Goyle were waiting for me in an empty hallway. They locked my legs together and pulled me into an empty classroom. There they released me, stole my wand from me and started using the knockback jinx on me, making me fall back all the time. They just laughed while I was falling into tables and chairs and onto the floor. It really hurt and I begged them to stop. Only they didn’t, they just kept going. I tried getting up all the time to make a run for the door, but they were firing the curse in turns, so I was knocked down before I could even start running.
We decided to move further into the woods and slowly the world around us became quieter. We picked a spot and sat down to wait for Sirius to return. I was worried about them all, fighting the death eaters. I only just got to live with Sirius, I didn’t want to go back to the Dursleys if anything bad happened now.
“So you want to take the potion to induce the miscarriage?” Burke asks.
Harry shrugs. The big word is out there. And Neville already knows, and Hermione suspects. It’s only fair, to be honest about this too. “Maybe,” he says.
They practice for a little while and then Harry gets it. He likes the feeling of Draco’s name on his hands. He wants to sign it all the time now.
“I had a good holiday,” Draco signs.
“Why not?” Draco spits out. “Just because I said I love you, doesn’t mean I agree with your worldview.”
“You didn’t steal him. You already had him before I even realised I loved him,” Pansy tells Harry. “I’m sorry it took me so long to realise that I shouldn’t take it out on you and Teddy. It wasn’t your fault that he didn’t love me. I just wish I didn’t have to lose him as a friend too before I realised that.”
“I don’t want to be alone,” Draco stutters.
“Ron already knows I like him. We’re all friends, remember,” Hermione says.
Draco just stands in the middle of the hallway. His wand still points towards Neville. With delicate steps, Harry moves towards him. Draco must have tried to stop Neville from going after Pettigrew. Draco, who seems to notice that the students in front of him are talking to someone behind him because he slowly turns around. His wide eyes lock with Harry’s. His hands drop to his sides and his wand rolls out of his grip.
Neville and Harry look at each other. “We have no clue,” Neville says. “That’s the whole problem.”
“Are you going to stand in front of that door all day, or are you coming in and offer me a decent cup of coffee,” Malfoy says as he walks up to Harry.
Hermione had gone to the girls’ bathroom and was crying in one of the stalls. I didn’t follow her in at first, because it was the girls’ bathroom and I’m not supposed to go in there. It just made me feel like a bad friend, waiting for her in the corridor. Another Gryffindor girl went in and I asked her to check on Hermione. She reluctantly agreed and when she came back out she told me that Hermione was crying. She said nobody else was in there and that I should go in to help my friend since Hermione had no-one else but me. I thanked Patil and sneaked into the bathroom. Hermione had locked herself inside one of the stalls and I just sat down in front of it, telling her I’m sorry that they are mean to her. I felt really bad because I felt like it was my fault she hasn’t any other friends but me and on the other side, I was glad that she is my friend because I’ve no one else. I started to cry to and then Hermione unlocked the stall and came out. We sat there together on the floor, crying and telling each other we will stick together no matter what. I’m really fortunate to have a friend like her.
Harry knows he should be happy he found a date. One that even looks good if he should believe Ron and Neville. Someone who won’t embarrass him on the dance floor when he’s forced to dance in front of the whole school. Really, Parvati is great. And that she convinced her sister to take Ron to the ball, shows that she’s kind too. Or maybe just after Harry for his fame, as Hermione said. But who cares. It’s not like Harry likes her. If it had been up to him, he’d be here with Clo.
“You do know that vampires can imprint themselves in your memories. It could be any of us and we wouldn’t know”, Ron says.
A newspaper follows, and then a fake Auror badge, a book about healing charms (the first thing that is actually useful) and finally a feather of a snowy owl. Harry looks at the feather with tears in his eyes. He misses Hedwig. His first friend and trusted pet ripped away too soon like so many others.
‘I would,’ Malfoy answers. Harry wants to jump from his seat and dance around. He doesn’t. Malfoy might change his mind when he sees how stupid Harry can act from time to time. He does spot the clock at the end of the room and curses. He quickly writes down that he needs to hurry off to dinner because he has an extra Quidditch practise this evening.
Things have become worse again. I still have nightmares and Malfoy has been making fun of that fact whenever he can. I told Hermione about the nightmares and the mirror I found. I didn’t tell her about your cloak, dad. I don’t know why, but I want to keep that just between you and me for now. Hermione was horrified about the fact that I had been out of bed at night, saying Filch could have caught me. She doesn’t know what to do about the nightmares; her advice was to think about happy thoughts before I go to sleep. I don’t think she understands how hard that is when you have an entire dormitory that wants to beat you up if you’re not careful.
“Maybe,” Harry says. “But right now, I don’t want him to know.”
‘Yeah, he doesn’t feel all that bad about that,’ Harry writes down. ‘Always says it’s the best thing that ever happened to him.’
“He was,” Harry answers.
Dear mom and dad,
Harry can’t disagree there. They don’t turn that often, and Harry has only seen it a handful of times. But it’s impressive to see the large stag that his father turns into. The animal is beautiful.
“You so would,” Ginny agrees as she again messes up Harry’s hair.
Harry signs and sits down next to Draco. “Are you okay?” he asks. His hand reaches out and takes one of Draco’s in his. Draco smiles at the linked hands.
“Let me go,” he spits at Harry.
“We brought you a little gift,” Harry tells her. Draco holds the wrapped packages he’d been holding up for Hermione to see.
“Don’t eat too much, you might fall off your broom again,” Parkinson jokes. The people around her laugh. Harry just shakes his head and continues his breakfast.
“I don’t know, Harry. It could ruin everything.” Hermione looks away and Harry feels sorry for her.
Adrian glides his broom down to the ground. Draco doesn't say a word to him. He tries to hold his tears inside, tries not to show how broken he’s on the inside. When they reach the ground Draco doesn’t dare to look at the group of people in the middle of the field. He knows what they're looking at and he can't see it. The idea of seeing Harry's broken body, his lifeless form. It will be unbearable. There’s no way Draco can look at that and not crumble apart. It’s already a struggle as it is.
“What did he say?” Ron asks.
“I’ll always save you,” Harry says.
Dear mom and dad,
“Okay,” Remus says. “Just know we’re all here for you when you need us.”
“Leave him, honey,” the pregnant man’s partner says. “It’s clear that man is short-sighted and an idiot. Nothing we can do about it.”
Harry pushes his hand through his hair. “I’ll try,” he says. “Not sure if Malfoy wants me to be his friend.” And that is the whole problem. Harry wants to help him, wants to be close to him. But he has no idea how.
Harry grins and takes his quill. ‘You don’t want Gryffindor to win?’ Harry writes. He’s laughing as he slides the parchment back to Malfoy who just rolls his eyes and points to his tie.
Draco closes his eyes and lets his hands rest on the counter. He can’t stop the thoughts from taking over. The hateful remarks people make, the howlers that still come sometimes, to remind him of the scum he is and that Harry deserves better. Like Draco doesn’t know this. He is the reason their saviour is unhappy, still childless, and all Harry ever wanted was to have a big family.
But he wasn’t the greatest sorcerer in the world and I told him so. I told him that headmaster Dumbledore was the greatest wizard in the world. That everyone says so and that Voldemort was still afraid of Dumbledore now, where ever he was hiding these days.
“Has he only just turned deaf?” Remus asks.
“Yes, I did,” Hermione says. She looks at Malfoy for a second and then places a piece of parchment on her lap. “Now, let’s get this show on the road,” she says. She grabs the quill that’s stuck behind her ear and starts to write on the parchment. Harry looks over and smiles as he reads the words.
Harry shakes his head. “Can we please just drop it?” he asks.
I love you,
“No, I won’t,” Draco repeats.
-x-x-x-x-
Harry jumps from his seat and hugs his dad. “Thank you, thank you,” he shouts. He can’t stay still. He lets go of his dad and walks up and down next to the bench. “We’re really going?” he asks.
“I’m not,” Draco answers. His eyes are getting moist, and he blinks. He promised himself he won’t cry today and he’s not planning to start now.
The red light slams into an invisible shield in front of Harry. Draco sits on the floor, Harry’s wand in his hand. He smiles at Harry and then he turns around. He faces Pettigrew. He’s going to stop him. Helpless Draco, the boy Harry thought he had to protect and save. He’s going to be the one that saves the day. The one that captures Pettigrew. It’s so unlikely, and so amazing at the same time. Harry wants to kiss him again. He knows he can’t. And he won’t. But he wants to, so badly.
“You still hate me, for stealing him from you?” Harry asks.
Love you and miss you terribly,
“I won’t. And neither will Teddy,” Harry says.
“I know,” Harry says. “It’s still wrong.”
Harry takes Draco’s head in his hands and forces Draco to look at his bloodshot eyes. Harry places a gentle kiss on Draco’s lips. “You are my dream,” he says. “I’m not lying. I don’t want any children if it isn’t with you. I love you, and I know you are worth everything.”
I hope others will start listing to him soon because I hate how everyone looks at me like I’m some dangerous person.
