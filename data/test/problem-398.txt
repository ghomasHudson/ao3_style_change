She muttered an incantation and with a swish of her wand the coat had transfigured into a blanket.
Harry looked at Ron, shocked.
“But I am happy” Draco said “I have a loving family, amazing friends, a wonderful girlfriend and a pet bunny!”
“So have I and I’m glad you enjoyed yourself” he said truthfully.
“I will not tolerate bullying. If you wish to behave like a group of eight year olds then you can go do that at another school. If I ever see or even hear about you bullying another student you can kiss your positions in Slytherin AND Hogwarts goodbye. Am I clear?” Professor Snape threatened.
“So I have to take something?” he asked after a minute.
“You’re great... I can see why Draco likes you so much” he muttered, breathing quite fast. She chuckled.
“So... uhm.... could you give me a tour of the castle?” she asked him.
The only sweet Draco himself asked to buy was a Blood-flavored Lollypop...out of curiosity.
Kate worriedly patted his back and rubbed it gently when he finally managed to stop a few minutes later.
Meanwhile Draco and Kate...
Draco still hadn’t woken up. Cedric at least had showed signs that he was waking up lately but Harry didn’t care.
Draco simply nodded with a tight smile.
“Well basically I set my own timing and studied-” he was cut off.
Draco smiled.
————————————————————————————
“Glad to be back” Draco smiled.
They spent a few moments simply staring at each other in silence, both not wanting for the night to end.
He closed his eyes and breathed in the smell of her coconut fragranced shampoo.
Lily sighed.
“Yeah?”
“Merlin, I was so worried...” Sev said as he hugged the blond.
As Draco turned around to walk away Harry’s mind caught up with everything.
Why had Dumbledore brought him here just to show him his own reflection?
He tried to speak but his vocal cords wouldn’t work so he simply nodded. His throat was really sore and he had a massive headache.
————————————————————————————
“I’ll have his arms if you don’t mind, Potter” Severus said darkly and for the first time in years the two childhood rivals actually agreed on something.
As Draco woke up he quickly became aware of the soft warm body against his neck and shoulder.
Even though blinding pain cursed though him, Cedric managed to take this chance and cast a ‘Reducto’ directly at its eyes, not only blinding it, but effectively killing it.
“Sorry” he didn’t know what to say. He certainly couldn’t explain of how he had been musing on his little crush.
“What happened?” he asked quietly as he placed a hand on Draco’s shoulder. He knew what had happened as Harry had told him, but he wanted to know what Draco had seen exactly.
He talked to Cedric and tried to convince him to give up entering the Triwizard Tournament but to no avail: his friend was set on placing his name in the flaming cup.
“Sorry-What?”
Kate blushed at the compliment.
As he opened the door to their bedroom he saw something very strange: a sealed envelope was laying on the bed.
————————————————————————————
It was fairly plain with only a few pieces of furniture and a big window. It was cloudy outside.
Draco stared at Ron in shock.
“Cherrywood, precisely 10 inches, reasonably pliable” he said.
Immediately his eyes fell on the black haired boy with round glasses and green eyes that was smiling at him.
He set his book on a book stand and started brewing.
Harry.
“Hi!” the girls and Ron said while Harry simply muttered “Hello”.
As he turned he was stunned, his eyes widening slightly.
He glared at his friend who simply started laughing.
Suddenly a loud whistle sounded and the two competing champions immediately jumped into the water.
James returned to sit by the boy’s bed the very next day after he got off work.
“Darling, you may feel happy but I promise you that your current eating habits are not enough to sustain a growing young man and soon you’ll be feeling anything but” she said.
“Harry?”
“I know, the chocolate was for me. You can have vanilla or whatever...” she said with a dismissive wave of her hand. This time he actually laughed.
“Draco! Do you need help with something?” Sev asked him sounding surprised.
“But if I try now I’ll just go back to eating like before by the time it’s Christmas” he said quietly as he looked at the floor.
As Seventh Year began Draco was happy yet nervous to be back.
“I think you don’t. And that’s why you feel the need to take out your frustrations on people you deem ‘weaker than you’. You felt threatened by me the moment I stepped into the Great Hall to be sorted didn’t you? Malfoys have always been in Slytherin and you thought that because of my presence you suddenly wouldn’t be top dog anymore. Do you really believe that by insulting me you’re establishing ‘dominance’ in front of the other Slytherins?
I enjoyed reading all your comments and all the ideas and theories you came up with. Some of them really inspired me and kept me going.
“Of course, but this is the second one this week and it’s only Thursday!” Draco said.
“Of course! You can’t not go to school! You’ve already missed two years, so I’m afraid you’ll have to catch up, however I have faith in your capabilities. By September next year you’ll be ready to go to school.
“I’m gay” he said.
“I don’t mind. It’s enough for me to know they care” he said and it was true. He didn’t need gifts or people there with him to express how sorry they felt for him.
He could recognize that handwriting anywhere. Harry...
“I am not discussing my sex life with you, Blaise Zabini” Draco shook his head stubbornly.
Draco wanted to gasp but managed to contain himself. Professor Snape was his... godfather?
Since he was still far away he couldn’t make out who the two people were but he could tell they were students by their robes.
“Draco, you’ve only been eating one meal per day, dinner to be exact; may I ask why? Do you feel unworthy of food? Does food repulse you? Do you see food only as a form of fat?” Dr. Susan Dirwin asked him. She was a muggle lady and Draco’s impression of her was one of a very kind person who had a sweet voice.
“Well, what if they became a couple?” Ron asked.
“Mhh... not really into the mood for that... what do you recommend as a light meal?” she asked him.
“I really like you, Draco” she said after a while.
The tenth day he and his parents rode back to Hogwarts on the Hogwarts Express since his parents didn’t want him alone for such a long period of time.
(Harry couldn’t remember when he had started referring to the blond as ‘his’ but he found it felt right to call him that)
“Harry, stop fangirling over him!” Seamus smirked at his friend.
“If you want, I can go and beat him up for you, Darling. Show that Gryffindor idiot that you don’t mess with us Slytherins” Pansy suggested after a moment of silence, eliciting a small smile from Draco.
Harry’s lips were slightly rougher than Draco’s soft ones but it didn’t matter; as the blond wrapped his arms around Harry’s neck, the brunette put his hands on Draco’s waist and pulled him flush against his body.
Their break up had been announced and splashed all over the papers, bringing attention to them once more. Harry cared little for the public’s gossiping so he generally didn’t pay that much attention to them.
Well, it seemed like her husband wasn’t going to make the same mistake twice...
Lily walked behind them and sighed while shaking her head when she saw her husband practically show Draco everything the shop had in display. Secretly she knew her husband had always desperately wanted to be the one who introduced their child to Quidditch. Instead Harry had received his first broom as a gift from his godfather, Sirius Black, effectively robbing James of his chance to explain every single little detail of the sport to him because Harry, being only seven years old, had wanted Uncle Sirius to explain everything to him.
He silently watched as James and Lily quietly discussed something. Finally James seemed to have his way again as he jumped in delight, kissed his wife on the cheek and announced they were going to Quality Quidditch Supplies.
“What a sickening sight: Malfoy’s got a girlfriend” a cold voice said from behind them.
“But I only wanted to have some fun...” he said quietly.
“You were great, Cedric. I’m glad you weren’t hurt” Draco said once they were left alone.
Harry stayed silent for an excruciating twenty seconds.
Harry immediately jumped up in panic.
He couldn’t give up now.
“We’ll see you later at the Gryffindor table!” Harry said.
He had informed his friends about Sev and surprisingly they hadn’t caused too much of a fuss: Ron had been to only one to protest that Sev was ‘evil’ however as he received no backup from his friends he begrudgingly agreed to give the man a chance.
Draco let his eyes linger on the other boy.
A romantic stroll in the moonlight!
After what happened, Elizabeth hadn’t been speaking to him; he didn’t know if out of spite or because she was shy, it didn’t matter to Draco. All that mattered was that he would be leaving Hogwarts and starting his life as a young adult.
“It’s fine, Cedric. I’ll be here if you decide to come back later, but right now you look ready to fall asleep while standing” he said in a scratchy voice.
Lily’s expression worried even more.
“We can’t know for sure now, Mr. Potter. Cedric’s life now is in Mr. Malfoy’s hands” the matron said as she went through the Hospital Wing’s doors. He was left alone in the corridor, worried out of his mind for Draco.
Too many unanswered questions!
He did find slightly stressful dividing the time he had between his studies, his girlfriend, his pet and his friends but it didn’t matter.
Draco could feel he was laying on something hard and uncomfortable.
“Very well done, Draco! You’ve made quite a lot of progress since the last time I saw you! I believe that in a couple of months you’ll have regular eating habits!” the lady said to him and smiled.
“This wand has been waiting for you and only you for thousands of years: it chose you for a reason, and that is an encouraging thought. Wand laws are not set in stone since every person’s bond with their wand is unique. It is old magic: trust its instinct”
‘Why not?’ he thought to himself ‘I’ll just grab a drink’
It was only when the Beauxbaton students started settling down at the Ravenclaw table that Draco shook his head and quickly focused on what Dumbledore was saying: he was introducing their guests.
The cream colored paper had two words written on it: Draco Malfoy.
He didn’t tell anyone what he had discovered.
One night, four days after the Third Task, Harry snuck out from Gryffindor Tower with his Invisibility Cloak his dad had secretly given him just to check on Draco.
He groaned out loud and smacked his head against a pillow.
So Harry took him ice skating, they baked cookies with Lily, they decorated the tree together as a family, had hot chocolate with marshmallows by the fire.
“Oh God, I’m so sorry! I see I’ve arrived at a wrong time! You-You... uhh... yeah! I’m just going to leave this here and get out of your hair, alright? Okay sounds good. Bye!” she practically ran out of the apartment from the embarrassment at having caught Draco and Astoria during a private moment, as it was clear what they had been doing that involved being naked before Hermione’s arrival.
“Then let’s ‘adopt’ him as a foster family”
“I guess you’ll just have to find out what they took during the task then... let’s hope you find this object!” Draco said and Cedric nodded absentmindedly, still trying to think about what sort of object he would retrieve.
“Come on boys, let’s go!” James said, sounding exited just as much as Harry.
He hadn’t appreciated the prank. Not. One. Bit.
Unfortunately by telling his friends Sev was his godfather the news, just like he had predicted, spread quite fast and in only a week basically everyone found out.
The smoke stopped and the bunny calmed down again.
“It’s okay, mate. We get it” one of the brunette boys said.
“Welcome back everyone to another year at Hogwarts: School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. As always the Forbidden Forest is forbidden to all students. This year’s Head Girl and Head Boy are: Elizabeth Swart and Draco Malfoy!”
As he was walking down a corridor he thought he heard someone behind him but when he turned he didn’t see anyone.
The only useful thing about his condition was that the Dark Mark could be used as a compass or a map, internally pulling him towards people with the same mark. The Ministry had put it to good use.
“Harry,” Malfoy whispered.
Potter shook his head, his inky black hair shaking as he moved. Draco felt a quick stab of jealousy (and something more, something he shouldn’t want), and looked away from the other man.
“Who are we hunting down again?” Potter asked.
“You also called me Draco.”
Draco wasn’t fast enough to dodge it.
“Well, the Dark Lord is in us now. So I think so. And why wouldn’t he want us to feast on some Muggle girl’s flesh? We’re superior to them.”
Draco blinked. “W-What?”
“No–” Malfoy looked up at him, his eyes full of torment. “It was just a comparison– will you just kill me?”
But he had been fighting for so long, and Draco couldn’t fight anymore.
He felt irrationally relieved when Malfoy’s shaky voice muttered, “Don’t dump the whole thing, you idiot, just find the blue.”
And he always kept it in his pockets.
“I’m gay,” Malfoy said, his voice grating and almost amused, like it was a painful inside joke to himself that Harry had no chance of understanding.
That didn’t stop Draco from wishing. Wishing that a certain green-eyed boy was his true love, wishing that he could save him like he had saved everyone else.
Potter looked adorably confused, like he couldn’t fathom why he could ever think that way. “What d’you mean?”
He waited behind the tree anxiously as the two Eaten talked about what they would do to her, what parts they would eat, how much they worshipped Voldemort. His empty stomach rolled. How could he have ever thought they were right? How could he have ever befriended them?
“No!” Harry said frustratedly, “At least tell me who it is and I can help you–”
Harry blinked. “Was planning to, yeah. Since you– you want me around, don’t you?”
Potter still wasn’t looking at him, but there was no one else who he could have asked that question too.
, so to speak, as he fumbled around in Malfoy’s robes, trying to locate the correct pocket.
.” He pulled open his shirt further, off of his shoulders, so it slipped off of his arms and pooled around his waist, showing the terrible, winding black veins all the way up left arm, spilling like spiderwebs over his shoulder, reaching their long, dark fingers towards his heart. It was so terribly, wrongly
Potter shrugged. “I don’t know. Maybe alone. To take some time for myself.”
The control, the clarity.
His breathing scratched raggedly in his throat as he ran to Malfoy’s side– Malfoy’s hair was streaked with black– dirt or ash Harry couldn’t tell– and blood trickled from a cut on the side of his head, staining his blond hair. Harry’s hands flew to the source of the blood automatically; it seemed shallow, and an irrationally strong wave of relief threatened to make him go boneless.
“Of course I would” Harry smiled.
“Hello Mr. Potter. I’m terribly sorry to barge in on you unannounced but I needed to speak with you urgently” she said while entering the apartment.
“Everyone out!” Madam Pomfrey said in a loud voce when she got a more thorough look at her unconscious patient.
“I like your dress by the way... it matches your eyes” he noticed and watched as her pale cheeks blushed crimson.
~ The End ~
He saw his pain potions had been left on his nightstand and in one gulp he downed them both: instantly he began to feel better.
“These are called ‘pancakes’; they’re really good especially when covered in maple syrup or soft butter” Harry said.
“Nothing. Harry’s grown a bit since Easter but you haven’t and also you’re still as skinny as always” she pointed out. Her son didn’t seem to have put on any weight since he had been home for Eater and Christmas and to her this was a cause of concern.
“Done already?”
The pair had been having a rocky period lately, with bad fights erupting mainly over Draco’s demanding work and how much time he spent at the office.
“Can’t you just take a two week vacation like normal people do?”
He picked up Snoodle and closed the curtains to his bed, casting a ‘Muffiliato’
“Yes?” his Godfather looked up from his papers.
“That must be painful... let me help you” he quietly said.
At the mention of Draco’s ex, jealousy flared up in Harry’s chest.
Suddenly everything disappeared as he sat up in bed, panting. Looking to his right he saw Harry’s sleeping figure was laying next to him.
Draco sat there silently as people patted him on the back and congratulated him.
Could this mean the Triwizard Tournament is easy enough for young wizards of the age of fourteen!? After all, Mr. Diggory did say it was Mr. Malfoy who devised his winning strategy...
A photograph of Draco and a mystery woman dancing and smiling together.
“I hate chocolate” he said and watched her smirk at him.
“Yeah, I’ve been flirting with him since I’ve met him and he never even acknowledged me so I figured he must not be interested in girls” she said.
Immediately the door opened as Sev appeared.
Draco smiled softly.
“No. Shouldn’t he be here?” Ron asked as everyone shook their heads.
After he made sure the boy was breathing too, he quickly cast a patronus charm and instructed his stag to go and get help.
“You’re leaving without me?” Harry asked him in a strangely low voice.
Draco never let them get to him, simply got up and continued his way.
“You can send it to Astoria’s apartment. He’s definitely going to receive it there!” she pointed out.
She would be everywhere. Literally.
“Wait! Where are you going?” he asked Draco.
“It’s so nice outside...” Draco whispered as he breathed in the fresh air and closed his eyes.
A tall and bulky looking ministry man lifted Draco and started carrying him towards the castle. Professor Snape and Professor Dumbledore followed them.
For that they gave him a special potion designed for expelling liquids so he spent part of the afternoon throwing up dirty lake water in a self cleaning bucket. His already sore throat felt like it was on fire after that and even swallowing his own saliva had become painful.
Here follows the speech he gave in merit to his sensational discovery:
The two of them had gotten really close and he would sorely miss her when she returned to France.
I find it very suspicious that the young Malfoy joined Hogwarts only in his third year. Why not earlier? As for now we have no other proof of him ever attending any other school, which is dubious as well.
I’m sorry to have to say this, but being with you lately has just been emotionally exhausting.
“Where are Dean and Seamus?” he asked.
He had actually chosen his job over him! How could he?!
As the three of them got into position to start, Cedric looked for Draco in the crowd and found his friend’s blond head in the very front row, sitting next to his father, Amos Diggory, and talking with him.
The MRI revealed something horrible: Draco had a pin lodged in his head that was hitting the central pain system, causing all the pain Draco was currently feeling.
“It’s okay” he said as Sev let him go.
He looked around pointlessly trying to ease his nerves and noticed the crowd had gone completely silent and the only noises that could he heard were the ones of Madam Pomfrey who talked as she worked on Draco and Cedric.
Harry moved away slightly, knowing this would  help Draco, but still he held the blond’s hand in his tightly as the mediwitch worked.
“I have very good news: you and I will be going to the graduation ball together!” she said happily as she latched herself to his side and gripped his arm. Harry tried to keep his jealousy in check and barely stifled a groan.
“CONGRATULATIONS!!” his friends screamed as he left the Headmaster’s office with Elizabeth.
“Potter”
“Don’t worry, Draco, I’m sure Snoodle still loves you even though you haven’t been spending a lot of time with him like you used to before you had all of this responsibilities. Besides, screw Elizabeth! If she doesn’t like Snoodle than who cares? I think he’s adorable and I couldn’t be more grateful that you have such an amazing pet in your life”
Harry’s left eye twitched slightly.
“This morning at Astoria Grengrass’ apartment.”
“I’m Dean!”
The pair spent some time talking and when Draco left he could have sworn there was a hint of a smile lighting his uncle’s face.
As they flooed home, Draco couldn’t help but notice how unusually quiet his foster parents were.
Ten minutes later he felt her free hand make its way up from his stomach to his shoulder and heard Kate breathe softly.
“It’s fine” she batted her eyelashes.
Twenty minutes later the family was enjoying herself on the skating rink.
Fortunately Draco’s health had improved a lot by the time Christmas had come and he had been completely healed; his eating habits however were a bit more slow going and he still couldn’t manage to have three full meals a day. He could keep down pretty much anything as long as he didn’t have too much.
Draco didn’t know. He hated not knowing.
He was in a hospital bed surrounded by people: his parents, Harry, Cedric and Kate.
After his little conversation with Elizabeth, the Head Girl had decided she couldn’t even look at him without blushing, leaving him and Harry loads of time to explore their blooming relationship. Their friends and parents knew and approved of them. Even Severus had voiced his approval.
“Well, uhm... I better go” Draco said eventually. For some reason all of a sudden he was feeling slightly nervous.
“Oh...” Draco tried to hide his disappointment. He had wanted to go with Harry.
As he was feeling particularly blue, he had a quick dinner and went to bed early with Snoodle already sleeping against his chest.
“I’ll come too!” Elizabeth immediately said with fake cheeriness.
His eating disorder had finally been cured after his final appointment with Dr. Dirwin a few months ago. Now only one thing remained that needed to be dealt with.
“What are you doing up this early?” his mother asked him in astonishment as she knelt before him. He wasn’t really an early riser.
As the two exhausted guys fell asleep naked in bed, Harry couldn’t help but feel guilt rise up in him.
“There is Hufflepuff which is yellow and black and for Ravenclaw blue and bronze“ Harry explained.
Now we can only wonder whether they took this trip together as couple or not!
Harry rushed to his room in excitement and ran outside.
“Uhm...I don’t know...” he said.
Walking into Draco and Astoria had been tough, as she hadn’t been expecting for the blond to be there as well.
“Go change into something warm. I’m afraid it’s quite cold outside today” he said.
And on the other side of the bottle he added:
“You know I’m alright, right? I’ll be fine” he said as gently as he could.
He then started thinking about how he could make the bunny swallow the red Healing potion, which had to be drunk for it to work.
To be sure it worked, Draco had tested it numerous times before concluding it was safe to use on people.
“Left handed... mhh... not very common... interesting...” he said as he handed him another wand.
“How do they even understand each other! Draco doesn’t speak french!” Harry said in frustration.
“Then if you’re okay with this you can go with Hermione as friends” Draco said hopefully, trying to help Harry.
Lily turned around and noticed her childhood friend.
The adults shooed the two teenagers to have some fun while they prepared dinner as it was already getting late.
The position they were in left little to no space between them but Draco found he didn’t mind.
“Anyone will do” he replied quietly. It really didn’t matter since all houses seemed good enough for him.
“No, we don’t know what or who did this as the Ministry swore them to secrecy and Draco doesn’t remember anything because he was hit from behind. A Professor did explain it was necessary for them to knock my son out the physical way because magic would have had interfered with his magical sleep down in the lake”
“Couldn’t you ask to speak with him for a moment?”
He looked up into those dark eyes and offered a small smile.
“Isn’t it great!? WE get to be Head Students!” she said excitedly. He smiled at her.
“That’s Shepherd’s Pie: it’s a ground meat pie with a layer of mashed potatoes on top. It’s good but I also find it kind of heavy” he said surprisingly in a non-shy way.
Snoodle had grown a bit and now was the size of the palm of his ‘dad’s’ hand. He still was very small and weighed only 1.3 pounds (600 grams). Since it had gotten colder Draco and his furry friend spent their days inside their room, studying, and as a result Draco had eagerly finished the First Year’s Hogwarts Curriculum and was ready to move on to the Second Year one. Since it was his first Christmas, he decided he wouldn’t study as much during the Holidays but would spend more time with his new family: his ‘dad’ would be home from work and Harry would be coming home from school.
By Felicity Logginers”
He smiled reassuringly at her.
He quickly walked to the Dungeons and knocked on his godfather’s door.
Gently he picked it up and opened it. As soon as he saw the parchment inside he closed it.
The cold had also done a lot of damage to his body so he was placed in a magical chamber with warming charms for a few hours to get the cold out from his bones.
Draco simply nodded. All of this was his? Well... that was... uhm... something...
“Oh please, as if you weren’t imagining what it would be like to be Draco’s girlfriend when you were trying to seduce him!” Harry said jealously. He didn’t like the idea of other people fantasizing about his Draco.
“Apparently it is” Kate said in an amused voice as she watched the boy walk away angrily.
Harry gaped at him. Draco had never asked him to go flying.
Since he didn’t know the list of books he would be needing next year at school he and Lily had gone out and bought a few books they found helpful.
“Can’t a bloke give his friend a gift?” Harry asked as he grinned.
Currently he and Harry were in the living room, studying Astronomy. Snoodle was on Draco’s chest as the blond laid on the couch, book in his left hand while the right stroked his bunny’s soft fur.
Malfoy’s name ripped out of Harry like a force of nature crashing through his entire body.
“Yes, I do.” Malfoy gestured to Harry’s wand pocket. “Just kill me.”
. He crumpled to the forest floor.
Malfoy watched him cry for a long moment, silent.  Harry sat on the bed, pulling his knees to his chest. Nothing but Harry’s gasping sobs sounded through the tent for a long moment.
Harry thought… Harry thought maybe he
The longer Malfoy was weak like this, the farther the black veins would climb in the absence of Malfoy’s capacity to resist. Malfoy had explained it many times.
Malfoy’s eyes opened, sharper and brighter this time, his breathing coming easier. “Haha.”
He itched to run out of the shadows, to kill the two monsters. But Potter hadn’t done anything, and if he could control himself, Draco could too.
Harry drew back and looked at him– his pale chest, now with normal coloured veins, unhealthily thin; his scraggly blond hair and red-rimmed grey eyes, the tired, jerky way he moved to sit back against the wall. His wrist had faded.
“And you’ll stick around? No more talks of killing you?”
“That checks out.” Malfoy laughed, shaky and humorlessly. Almost resigned. He sat up straighter, scooting a little so Harry could join him on the cot, facing him. His black veined chest rose and fell, his mouth a tight line.
Harry released a sharp breath. “That’s not funny.” It wasn’t, but he was smiling anyway– Malfoy looked better already, and his voice was strong now, steady.
Malfoy stirred.
“Draco.” Harry met his eyes and held them, knowing, somehow, that whatever it was Malfoy wanted to say was infinitely important.
Harry stilled.
“You’re making it seem like we’re going to die or something,” he said. If Draco had his way, one of them would.
and his
something,” Malfoy said forcefully, “It’s impossible. It’s one of those crazy cures like eating a dragon heart. It might work, but I can’t actually–”
“How could you ever think it was impossible?” He could see the black veins creeping away from Draco’s heart on Draco’s back, fading away. Rolling back, receding as if retreating from a force infinitely more powerful. Love. “Of course I love you. How could I not?”
Something was very wrong.
That was before the ex-Death Eaters started turning into monsters.
“Because they don’t love me!”
Harry made a sound in his throat as Malfoy traced his Dark Mark with shaking fingers. “You won’t.”
Still, he ignored it and pushed forward. He had monsters to kill.
“I know who my True Love is,” Malfoy cut him off tonelessly. “I love him enough to know.”
him, as if he’d already thought this all through and decided it wasn’t worth it. How could it not be worth it? It was his
there’s a cure! I can’t
“No,” Draco said, shooting off another stunner. Dolohov danced out of the way. “I won’t.”
“I know what you did in your past,” he said. “I happened to be there. But you changed, and you’re working with the Ministry to hunt down your former friends. And everyone deserves a second chance. Even you, Malfoy.”
But he had adapted, and Potter was fast and strong. He was the strongest person Draco knew. So they had survived until now.
He wasn’t going to become one of them. He wasn’t.
” The bolts of light shot out of his wand, a few hitting the Eaten, but not doing much damage.
Malfoy hummed a reluctant consent.
Pain filled his body; black filled his vision as his eyes fluttered shut.
, Draco.”
Malfoy swallowed and looked away.
That was why they were making the bonfire. Because they planned to eat the Muggle girl.
He was going against Dolohov, and Potter was going against Yates.
Harry located the little bag, pulling open the drawstring loop and then dumping the entire contents onto the floor, a ticking clock pounding in his chest as Malfoy’s eyes fluttered shut again. It turned out to be a veritable
“It’s…” Malfoy looked at him, and then away again. “It’s True Love.” He opened his mouth to take a shaky breath, staring at his hands as Harry waited, his heartbeat pounding in his throat, hope rising in his chest like the sun. “Love has always been… a counteraction to Dark Magic. The myth– it’s, it’s only a myth– but the myth is that if you know that your True Love loves you… it’s like a panacea. A bezoar stone, but for soul magic.” He laughed mirthlessly. “It’s nothing.”
of bottled potions, many of them glowing in the dim magical lighting of their tent, which had a nice, small chandelier, courtesy of Malfoy’s high wizarding-tent standards.
. “We’ll see if some bloke can catch–”
How could he possibly have thought it impossible? It was so
to his heart, with black, black veins.
“Sod off. Just  . . . I don’t know. We’ve gotten closer. And after this, we might never see each other again. I feel like we should enjoy the time we have left.”
“No more talks of killing me,” Draco said into his chest. “I promise.”
Hard, sharp rocks dug painfully into Harry’s knees as he knelt by Malfoy, dry leaves snapping under him as if to remind him of the fragility of life, his heart racing as he held a hand under Malfoy’s nose and pressed two fingers roughly to the juncture of Malfoy’s neck.
“I thought you wouldn’t want to know anything about me,” Draco blurted out. Fuck. Curse him and his big mouth and his obsession with Harry Potter.
Malfoy swallowed hard and reached into his pocket, pulling out his wand. He dropped it unceremoniously onto the floor with a clatter that was startlingly loud in the silence of their tent.
It took barely a moment to set the tent, scooping Malfoy up in his arms and carrying him in. His heart cracked as he felt the cold of Malfoy’s skin, the light weight of his body, so frail and weak, fighting so desperately against the curse of a soul not his, against a kind of dark magic they’d never seen before– not even Harry, though he’d lived with Voldemort’s soul in him for his entire life up until a year ago that seemed a lifetime away.
He turned to leave, but a hand on his arm stopped him. Potter had darted behind his tree to stop him. Of course he did.
If only Draco’s sixteen-year-old self could see him now. On the way to kill the Eaten with Harry bloody Potter, working for the Ministry with him. He could barely recognize his life.
” Harry was standing now.
Malfoy’s eyes opened, slowly, the swirling, magnetic grey that Harry saw in his dreams. His hand fluttered weakly in Harry’s.
It spread as he’d never seen a curse do, like a shock wave, and the last of the Eaten exploded into ash from his spell with a horrific scream. Black hovered in the air for a moment, as if the piece of Voldemort’s soul that had been preserved in that once-man’s Dark Mark was searching for a new place to go before fading into nothing.
He reached for Harry, his hands clutching– frail, bony, and tight as a noose– at Harry’s own. “Tell me you understand.”
“Just tell me what it is. And if it’s impossible…” Harry trailed off. He didn’t know what to say– he wouldn’t promise he wouldn’t try, not when if there was even the slightest chance, he knew he’d go for it. Even if there wasn’t the slightest chance, he’d go for it. Draco Malfoy could not die. Harry couldn’t live with it.
If anyone deserved time for himself, it was Harry Potter.
They had arrived at a lake in the middle of the forest, and they were standing on a very small cliff above it. The two of them ducked behind trees, their movements smooth and practised, and he leaned against it. If there was anything he was proud of these days, it was how synchronized he and Potter had gotten before and in battle.
He looked over at Potter, who looked like he had just noticed her too. He put his hand up, their sign for wait, and pointed at the Eaten.
No. He couldn’t mean that.
. “We can go all over the world. Meet as many people as we can, and maybe some girl will catch your eye–”
Malfoy always carried around a small pouch with many more potions than should fit in it, and he was insufferably proud of the charmwork he’d put into the bag, as well as the potions, which he’d invented himself to replenish his energy. They’d become increasingly useful over the past few months, when he began to get worse and worse.
“No.” Malfoy didn’t even seem affected by this entire conversation, this conversation that could
Harry stood there, his chest heaving, staring at the blank, semi-ashen ground on which the last of the Voldemort corrupted Eaten had stood moments before.
He looked around– this was hardly the place to put up a tent, but he’d have to find a place close by, so he could Levitate Malfoy that far, or carry him, if he could find a place really close. It felt safer to carry Malfoy, simply because of the control of it, because of the palpable weight of Malfoy’s solid body in Harry’s arms, a reminder that the boy Harry couldn’t help but ache for was not yet lost.
He swiped at his eyes, but the tears kept coming.
Draco almost dropped his wand.
“Besides, we’ll find a cure.” He sounded so determined it hurt to hear.
“Oh thank
, at least for the moment.
“Harry,” Malfoy’s voice broke, “Please. I don’t want to become
“I noticed.”
They were the same age, but Draco looked older. Last time he looked in a mirror– he loathed to admit he had begun looking in them less– his hair had hung limply on his head, his eyes were dull, the flush in his cheeks looked feverish instead of natural. His skin, an unhealthy pale, stretched strangely over his bones. And that wasn’t even mentioning his arm, or his veins.
“Yes I
,” he shouted, almost without thinking, lashing out with his wand every which way towards the Eaten still standing, but they ducked, laughing loudly.
They were going to eat her.
The black veins up his arms were climbing far higher, Harry knew, like twisting, cruel vines against Malfoy’s skin, the contrast even stronger than usual because of Malfoy’s ever-deteriorating health, and his feverish skin. Harry looked at him now and thought he looked nearly transparent, the blue veins up the underside of his jaw a vivid cry of fragility.
“We’re the last ones,” the thing that used to be Dolohov said. “We might as well go out with a bang!”
Harry didn’t laugh, but Draco could tell he was amused.
“No!”
’ usually with no small amount of mockery. The way he said it now…
Draco looked a little closer and noticed that they both had their wands out.
He nodded. It was a good plan, even better considering he wouldn’t have to leap down from somewhere to fight. Draco wasn’t sure he could do that anymore.
“Whatever, Malfoy.”
One day, Draco would become one of those. He had fought it for a year, but there was no cure, and that day grew closer by the second. The day he would turn into a monster.
“It must’ve been the Stunner,” he whispered, his throat tight, his chest empty and hollow. He couldn’t breathe. “The Eaten are
He smiled a little.
“What, do you think that there will be a cure? That you won’t be the last Death Eater, the last Eaten?” He flung a Cruciatus Curse that he barely missed. “The only cure is something that you’ll never have! No one could ever love you, Draco Malfoy! No one!”
“You? Settle down? At nineteen?”
“I’m going to put up the tent and fix you up.” He didn’t know why he felt compelled to talk to unconscious Malfoy, but it gave him clarity of mind over the swirling relief that Malfoy wasn’t dead and the everpresent terror that he might, at any moment, die or cross the point of no return.
A wave of magic rose to his skin, the sheer feel of its power drowning out the unwanted word and rushing through him so forcefully it hurt.
“It could be something,” Harry said desperately, hoping he wasn’t grasping at straws– how could he know if he was grasping at straws if Malfoy wouldn’t tell him what it was? If anything could even offer a
His perfect mouth dropped open at Draco’s words. “Do you seriously think I care about that?” Potter demanded.
he whispered, his voice shaking as hard as his wand-hand, gripping his wand tight and pointing it at the pale boy on the cot as he watched Malfoy’s chest rise and fall shallowly. “Please wake up, Draco, please.”
“You’re one of us,” he growled, sounding angry and ridiculously happy at the same time. It reminded him a bit of his aunt. “Someday, you will look just like me!”
“If you don’t, we can…” It
. “Just because he’s my True Love doesn’t mean I’m his. He doesn’t
“Hi,” Harry whispered, his chest tight, “You’re okay. You’re safe, I’ve got you.” He ran a hand through Malfoy’s hair, pushing it off his forehead, suppressing the urge to kiss him there, lightly.
Harry smiled, winding his arms around Draco’s waist and rising up to pull Draco in, holding him close. He could feel Draco relaxing into him, their chests pressing together, Draco’s arms slowly moving to hold him back.
the possibility in the still air. “Do you have any idea who your True Love might be?”
and you don’t trust me, and you
Draco could understand why he said that now. Just in case he died, his dream wouldn’t go down with him.
The spell hit him straight in the chest, and a strangled noise fell from his lips. It blasted him backwards, and he hit a tree with a
He crept through the trees, trying not to make any noise, before he was directly behind the two Eaten. They were building the bonfire, laughing and crowing in a way that was definitely not human.
She was even younger than he was. They had put the Body-Bind curse on her, and she looked bloody terrified.
Draco glanced out from behind the tree. The Eaten were standing on the shore of the lake, near what looked like the makings of a bonfire. They looked Muggle, looked human, until you looked closer. At their swollen black veins, at their too-large teeth, at the crazed, hateful look in their eyes.
He could feel Draco breath against him, the warmth of his breath on Harry’s neck, the rise of his chest pushing against Harry’s own.
Malfoy didn’t seem worried about himself, and that alone was worrying enough to nearly break Harry in itself, but Malfoy opened his mouth, and Harry, with a shaking hand, poured the syrupy blue liquid into Malfoy’s mouth, holding the cold bottle steady with both hands.
“I was thinking about . . . becoming the Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher,” Potter said slowly, like he was testing the waters by saying the words. “After this.”
“We’ve spent a lot of time together over the past year, Malfoy,” he said.
“Well, we might,” Potter joked, before getting serious again. “I just don’t want to end this without knowing anything about you. It feels wrong.”
It seemed to happen in slow motion and inconceivably quickly all at once– Harry watched Malfoy fall with his heart in his throat for what seemed like minutes– and yet Malfoy fell so quickly Harry couldn’t have moved by the time Malfoy hit the ground, clearly unconscious.
“I did tell you that you’re stupid,” Harry said.
Malfoy threw his hands up. “
Potter looked good. He had always looked good really, even at eleven, which he thought was particularly unfair, but that wasn’t what he was focusing on. He looked healthy, healthy and young, every inch of the nineteen-year-old he was. His hair was black and thick, his eyes the emerald green of Draco’s house colours. He still had a healthy flush in his cheeks.
Harry’s heart leapt in his chest, soaring, and Malfoy–
Harry kissed the top of Draco’s head. “I think I made it pretty clear I don’t want you to die.”
, like the sweeping grace of an enemy’s sword.
That was the only thing they could agree on.
Harry inched closer. “I don’t understand.”
” Dolohov yelled, grinning like a madman, showing those unnatural teeth.
“He said there was a cure. Dolohov, he mentioned–” He faltered when Malfoy shut his eyes, a pained look crossing his face, something so aching that Harry’s heart cried out in harmony. “You know what it is.”
They rose early on Saturday, eating quickly and bundling up before heading to the quidditch mound. It was a clear day and though it was cold the conditions were right for a seeker’s game. They didn’t keep track of the score and only quit when their hands were so cold it became hard to hold their brooms. After lunch, Seamus suggested a snowball fight. Most of the eighth years and some seventh years headed outside, but Harry still felt cold from before and opted to stay in front of the fireplace falling asleep while Draco read.
Draco laughed as he rolled on top of him, settling himself between Harry’s legs and holding himself barely above him. “You know what would make me feel really good?” his lips barely brushing Harry’s skin as he spoke.
“Well, I won’t be joining you,” Ron said around a sausage. Swallowing, he added, “Since we have the option of going to Hogsmeade whenever we like, I’m going to go for a bit. I need to restock a few things.”
Draco chuckled, “I can fix that.” He grabbed Harry’s wand and did a few quick cleaning spells so that they were clean along with the sheets. He pulled Harry into his chest and kissed his forehead. “Can I tell you something?”
“Can I help you, St. Potty,” Malfoy sneered, managing to look down at him even though he was the one sitting.
“Yea,” Harry was surprised to see him, but he didn’t think that was why his heart was beating faster. Draco climbed over him and took the empty spot in the bed before pulling his jumper over his head and getting comfortable. He tugged at Harry, pulling him to lay his head on his chest. His skin felt clammy and his heart was beating faster than Harry’s. “Nightmares?” Harry asked quietly.
“Yea, but stay where I can see you,” he grinned as he spoke to him. “And be nice to the other kids,” he practically shouted as Teddy ran over to the slides. “I hope the park is alright. Andromeda had an appointment so I have Teddy for the afternoon,” he said as he sat next to Draco.
“Yes,” Harry ground out begrudgingly. “You were less annoying when we were fighting.”
“Slow down a bit and I won’t have to hang on so tightly.”
“If you have a moment, I need to speak with you.” He looked at the surrounding Slytherins and added, “Privately.”
“Yea. Of course you can.”
By the time the weekend arrived, Harry was exceedingly frustrated. Draco insisted on touching him and kissing his cheek, holding his hand. He wasn’t used to this much attention and it was a bit overwhelming. He was also actively avoiding answering any questions about his new boyfriend. Everyone either had something to say or a question to ask and Harry had quickly grown tired of it.
----------------------------------------------
As Harry showered, Draco adjusted the blankets, pulling them down and fluffing the pillows. He smiled as he thought about Harry cuddling up to him in his sleep and decided that he would ask him if it was alright to hold him like that before they fell asleep. It would be nice to do it on purpose and he wanted to enjoy the time they had away from Hogwart’s.
“Didn’t we just talk about this?” Ron asked, throwing his arms up dramatically.
“Well, come on then,” Pansy rushed him. “Don’t keep me waiting.”
“Who asked you?” Ron asked, his eyes full of suspicion.
Malfoy rolled his eyes and flopped onto his side next to Harry. “Sex, Potter,” he chuckled. “The fact that you didn’t know what I meant tells me that you’re not ready.”
“Well, yea,” Potter shrugged. He looked at Draco like the answer was obvious. “Ron’s not in dueling because his grades aren’t high enough. Hermione thinks it’s silly to waste time on swordplay when I could be studying instead. You’re the only one of my friends that’s good enough to help me figure this out.”
“Yea, I would,” he nodded. “Thank you for asking me.”
“What?” Harry seemed a bit taken aback. He looked confused for a moment and then a little hurt as he stepped away from Draco. “What did Ron say to you exactly? Because I never implied to him that we were a couple. I never wanted to push you into anything just because of my feelings.” He stopped talking as he saw the surprise on Draco’s face.
When Ron woke the next morning, he decided to leave Harry to sleep. It wasn’t often that he slept late and he didn’t want to disturb him. He dressed quickly and went to the common room, hoping to catch Hermione before breakfast. He found her sitting with Pansy, his cheeks heating when the Slytherin girl beamed up at him.
“Not particularly,” he shrugged. “I know exactly where I’m going though. I already have his scent.”
---------------------------
Harry chuckled, “Yea, that sounds like him. Hermione will be harder to convince though.”
Draco took a bite of the fluffy eggs and hummed in appreciation. “This is delicious,” he said before eating a piece of crispy bacon. “Have you ever considered inviting friends over so you don’t have leftovers?”
They were about to ascend to the third floor when Draco noticed a fifth door at the end of the hallway and pointed it out, “What’s in there?”
“Not hurt,” Draco groaned, grabbing Harry’s hips to hold him in place. “Definitely not hurt.”
“Yea, I was,” he agreed.
By the time they reached the weekend, Harry was tired of studying. Draco insisted that they get their homework in the evenings, after dinner. Harry wanted to protest, but the idea of spending an entire weekend free of schoolwork was tempting so he didn’t argue.
“Completely understandable,” Draco agreed. He stood and stretched, yawning as he did. “Do you mind sharing the bed or would you prefer the sofa?”
“You’re actually letting her go in all the shops,” Blaise gasped, looking at Ron like he was crazy.
Several days later, Malfoy approached Harry in the hall on their way to the dungeons for Potions. “Harry, I’ve been looking for you,” he said as he wrapped his arm around Harry’s shoulders. He leaned his head close and added in a rushed whisper, “I’ve decided on my favor. I need you to be my boyfriend. Just for a little while. My mother is insisting that I take her friend’s daughter on a date during the next Hogsmeade weekend so I told her that I was escorting you. She has to think it’s serious enough to stop trying to set me up on dates.”
“I don’t know. I owe you a favor,” Harry shrugged.
“Oh, I can get mine,” Harry shrugged.
“I’m not sure what the two of you are up to and I don’t particularly care, mind you,” Blaise said when Draco had left, “But he’s one of my only friends and you’d best not hurt him.”
“Yes,” he huffed in response. “I’ve noticed. In case you haven’t noticed, my trunk isn’t here which means that I have no clothing.”
“They’ve been in there for hours,” Hermione practically shouted even though she was trying to whisper. “What if they’ve gotten into a fight and knocked each other out?” She dragged Ron up the hall mentally preparing herself for the sight of Harry and Malfoy beaten, battered, and knocked out. She was not prepared for what she saw when they opened the door. Harry was cuddled up against Malfoy’s chest and they were both sleeping peacefully.
“Hold on!” Ron bellowed. “I’m getting there. Keep your knickers on!”
“Yes,” Malfoy said, stepping aside. His voice dripped with sarcasm as he added, “Please, by all means, make yourself comfortable. We’re thrilled to have you.” Harry rolled his eyes as Malfoy sat on the sofa and picked up his coffee. “Not like we were busy,” he mumbled to himself. He looked at Hermione over his cup, “It’s a bit early for a social call, don’t you think?”
Looking around his new dorm, he realized that there were only two beds. He was about to go look for Ron to ask him about it when Malfoy entered the room.
“As if you need to ask,” scoffed Draco.
“I did,” Potter nodded and grinned at the boy. “You were on top of the world for a moment.”
Potter just grinned at him as he grabbed the ripped bed hangings from the floor. “I’ll go rinse these. I can use them to dust the Muggle way,” he spoke over his shoulder as he left the room.
‘I must have used up all my luck,’ Harry thought as he heard someone following him. He thought that maybe if he could at least get to the water in the tunnels, it would cover his scent, but he didn’t make it that far.
“Shh,” Draco spoke softly and held his hands up. “I don’t want to hurt you, Harry. Will you let me use some healing spells?”
“If Harry’s up to it, we might go later,” Draco shrugged. “I need to get him something for Christmas and it’ll be good to be seen out together.”
Harry laughed at that, letting Draco pull him up out of bed, “I imagine it won’t take long.”
“Understandable,” Draco agreed. He took the bottle from Potter and put it away. Turning he pulled his desk chair out and gestured for Potter to have a seat. “I’d tell you to relax, but it doesn’t look like you’ll ever be relaxed again.”
Harry couldn’t stop grinning, especially as the light caught the ring on his finger. He’d have to tell Ron that he had been right. They hadn’t picked the wedding colors yet, but there was plenty of time for little details. In the end, it didn’t matter as long as they had each other.
“I had heard stories, but you never know what’s true and what isn’t,” Narcissa said. “Alright, darling,” she kissed his cheek. “You get some sleep. I’ll see you in the morning.”
“Then why are you fighting to keep me close, Potter,” he leaned forward until their lips were almost touching and stopped. Harry’s breath caught in his throat and he held completely still, waiting to see what would happen. “I think you like having me this close.”
“You should have warned me,” Harry huffed.
“Do you really want to help?” Draco asked, a bit of the spark returning to his eyes.
“Longbottom,” Draco shrugged. “And please don’t ask me what he was right about.”
“Or ask Granger,” Draco shrugged. “If it’s in a library book, I’m sure she’s read it.”
As they descended the stairs, Potter said over his shoulder, “You’re welcome to pick any room you like. They all need about the same amount of work with the exception of the master bedroom. If I had known for certain you’d take the job, I would have cleaned one out for you.”
Since Harry didn’t react to Pansy or Neville when he finally presented as omega, Hermione said he might be a beta like she was. Ron and Pansy(who was now a permanent fixture on Ron’s arm) were concerned he might be omega.
“Oh, ok. Good,” she said softly. “I wanted to ask you if we should invite Harry’s family to dinner tomorrow. I know he’s close with the Weasley family, but he didn’t say anything about the Muggles that raised him.”
“Yes, I do,” he grinned. “But we both know what you enjoy.” His grin grew wider as Harry’s cheeks tinged pink.
“Completely understandable,” Ron added.
“Nothing happened so calm down,” Harry rolled his eyes. “He had a nightmare so I let him stay. We both know what it’s like.”
“You would do that?” Draco looked surprised. “He was right.”
“Yes,” Harry moaned, not ready for him to stop. His finger slipped into the tight ring of muscle just as he sucked one of Harry’s balls into his mouth. He turned his attention back the his shaft as he slowly pumped his finger in and out. He soon added another finger, slowly working them into Harry and scissoring them to stretch him further. Harry cried out, about to cum when Draco stopped sucking and pulled away from his prick. He groaned in frustration and flexed his hips trying to gain friction. Draco added a third finger, causing Harry to moan and whine as cum leaked from his prick.
Harry stuffed his hands in his pockets to keep from smacking the back of Ron’s head. He didn’t need to be worried, Malfoy would never say yes.
Harry’s heart beat wildly in his chest and he uncorked the container. “Okay, just– can you open your mouth?”
He was still
Harry’s eyes prickled hotly, tears threatening to spill. “Well I’m
Draco’s smile lit up the whole tent. “Yeah. I do.”
had monsters to kill.
No. He doubted that.
Malfoy finally cleared his throat, speaking so softly, Harry had to suppress his tears to hear.
He tried again, channelling every ounce of magic pushing at his skin. “
Malfoy shifted, the cot creaking warningly under them as Harry leaned forward, hopelessly hopeful and trembling with it.
Black, cold, roiling dread rushed through Harry like a whip-quick rope, tightening around him like a noose.
Draco recognized the two as Dolohov and Yates, and he scowled. Of course they would be the last ones. They had been very loyal followers of Voldemort.
Finally, after what felt like hours, they spelled the Muggle girl free. They dropped their wands at the same time.
“Thank you,” he found himself whispering, which was frankly ridiculous, because it was Malfoy at risk, after all. And yet that wasn’t quite true either, because if Malfoy didn’t pull through, Harry was sure he couldn’t either. He didn’t want to imagine a world without Malfoy in it.
He couldn’t Apparate with Malfoy this weak, but he still had the shrunken wizarding tent they’d been using for months as they tracked the Eaten down.
That one felt better, the desperation in his body unleashed in a wave of magic.
, open your eyes–”
“Is it eating a dragon heart?” Harry shifted, grasping for his wand. “I’ll kill a dragon, Draco,
He didn’t have much time left.
“Maybe. A peaceful life would be nice.”
And then the duel began.
Harry opened his mouth to retort, but nothing came out. It didn’t matter, because Malfoy wasn’t waiting on him for one anyway, not anymore– they were both looking at Malfoy’s chest, pale, skinny enough that you could count his ribs because these days he sometimes had trouble keeping his food down.
“It’s pretty obvious, don’t you think?” He pointed at him. “You’re Harry Potter, the Chosen One, the Vanquisher of Voldemort.” He pointed at himself. “And I’m Draco Malfoy, Death Eater. Somewhere in there, the Ministry might send you after me.”
Malfoy was silent. He stared at their hands and said nothing, the light catching in his blond hair and the shadow covering his eyes.
Malfoy shook his head, his hands tightening on Harry’s. “It’s nothing,” he said.
“No.”
Holding Draco felt like home.
That he could fall in love so quickly for someone he had detested for so long.
When Voldemort died, everyone thought the War was over. They celebrated, laughed and danced, thanking Harry Potter for saving the Wizarding World. He had gotten ready for trial.
Might be–
The thought of true love, something the other Eaten had never taunted him with, slowed him down. It was small, by a fraction, but it obviously meant something.
“Hmmm,” said Draco, something flickering brightly in his eyes. “You’re sticking around, then?”
If anyone was kind enough to give him a second chance, it was Potter.
Or that Draco Malfoy could change so quickly, so
Harry Potter was beautiful. It was a fact, one Draco wished he could stay more objective on.
The Eaten had said something about a cure. Harry remembered, suddenly, and the memory pierced through his thoughts, a ray of light straight to his heart.
Harry knew people didn’t like Malfoy, and for good reason. But anyone who’d seen him for the past year– determined to change, eager to learn, grimly set on ridding the world of the Eaten– Harry knew he was impossible not to fall for. “You don’t know that.”
“Why are you telling me this?” Draco asked. He wasn’t sure why he was asking. Maybe it was because it was their last job together, and he was feeling nostalgic. Maybe he was curious.
Huh. Potter as a teacher.
Draco flushed and smiled, cradling one of Harry’s hands and looking down at it again. Harry flipped him the bird and Draco snickered. Harry’s heart fluttered– there it was, that smile.
He had a heartbeat.
“I thought you called me clever,” Draco gasped against him as Harry moved off of Draco and lay down beside him.
Harry stopped short. Malfoy knew? If he knew, everything was suddenly so much easier, so incredibly
“I know. You said.”
The last thing he heard before succumbing to the darkness was someone screaming his name.
Duelling the Eaten wasn’t like duelling regular wizards and witches. They were faster, stronger. They showed no mercy.
“What?” he asked.
There was only one thing that might be able to cure him. True love. The knowledge that your true love loved you.
Harry’s heart ached. “I’m not trying to be. I’m not joking, Draco,
And lined,
The theory was that Voldemort’s broken soul entered their bodies through the marks, corrupting them. The Eaten’s spells were stronger, their veins black as night. They could blend in with Muggles, which was the most dangerous thing about them.
Maybe he was hoping for a miracle.
” Malfoy hissed, the corners of his eyes sparkling with tears. “You know I will, and you’ll have to put me out too. I don’t want that for me. I want to go out on my own terms, do you understand?”
“You’re clever,” he murmured, bringing Draco’s hand to his lips. He kissed Draco’s knuckles, the black-lined veins trailing down his fingers. “You’re funny, caring. You’re so determined to change, and you’ve changed so much, you’ve survived a year without becoming one of the Eaten. You’re so, so strong.”

Draco Malfoy was going to die soon.
“I meant it’s you. You’re my–” his voice cracked. “You’re not the

“I don’t want you to die.”
“Left pocket,” Malfoy murmured faintly, his fingers twitching as if he was itching to correct Harry, or slap his hands away and do it himself. Harry never thought he’d see the day where he wished Malfoy would.
“I love you,” Harry whispered against Draco’s heart. He could feel Draco’s heart beating out of his chest, wild and fast. He could see the hope filling Draco’s grey eyes, Draco’s lips parting, his eyes locked on Harry as if he couldn’t look away.
Yates laughed, a chilling sound. “Do you think the Dark Lord would have wanted us to do this?”
Harry’s heart ached in his chest, so strong he could barely speak around it. He found Malfoy’s cold hand and held it so tightly he thought he might break it. “It’s not nothing.” He could almost

Harry didn’t have to ask which other thing.
He couldn’t be, not when that Eaten had just mentioned a cure– he couldn’t be–
Then his eyes darted to the right, and he froze.
to. “Tell me, please. Does it work?”
His legs ached as he walked, and Draco mentally prepared himself for the battle that would ensue when they found the Eaten. It would tire his already exhausted body out. It took a lot out of him to keep himself from turning into one of the Eaten, and he had gotten more and more ill over the last few months. It was impressive that he could still walk. “Who would you even settle down with? You broke up with Weasley.”
The conversation died down a bit as they ate. The little bit that continued was mostly Pansy and Hermione with Blaise chiming in occasionally. Harry couldn’t help but to smile as he watched his friends, old and new. It was hard not to like Draco’s friends and he hoped that they’d get along when all this was over.
When Harry’s marriage started to fall apart, Draco stepped in to help his friend in much the same way. Taking the children so that they wouldn’t hear the arguing. Making sure that Harry ate because he forgot to sometimes. And when things fell completely apart, he opened the doors of his home to Harry and his children. The renovations weren’t complete in Grimmauld Place and it was no place for children. Draco had insisted they stay with him.
Potter moved just enough to call his bluff. He pulled a second pillow out from under his head and flipped the blanket down on the empty side of his full bed. “You think you’re clever do you?” Draco muttered. He pulled his cloak off and placed it on Potter’s trunk before kicking his shoes off and climbing over Potter to lay next to him. Potter just stared at him for a moment, eyes wide with shock. “So why are you hiding out here? I mean, your bed is alright, but not the best. If you’re hiding from your chatty friends then I completely understand.”
Potter scowled at him. “Yea, because I totally did it on purpose. You’re taller than me, maybe you could have helped,” he huffed, stepping into Draco’s personal space.
“Oh,” Harry’s cheeks turned a bit pink. “It was just a nightmare. I’m sorry that I woke you. I usually close the bed hangings and use a Silencing charm.”
“Same to you.”
“I don’t think so,” Harry shook his head. He was struggling to stay upright. His limbs were growing heavier and he felt nauseous. His back hit the corridor wall just as the most delicious scent washed over him. He instantly felt better. The nausea went away, he didn’t feel so tired. He looked at Malfoy, shaking his head as he realized that the amazing scent was coming from him.
“I dare you to do a striptease for Potter,” Blaise’s grin grew even wider as he waited for Draco’s response.
“You put the ad in the paper?” Draco asked, his voice filled with disbelief.
“I need to learn to be more specific,” Harry said as he removed his glasses and massaged the bridge of his nose. “Fine, yea. Whatever.” He started walking again, shaking his head as his hand was grabbed and held in a firm grip. “Not so tight. I’m not your prisoner, you know.”
“Aren’t you looking for him?” Neville asked.
“It’s ok to enjoy a kiss, Harry,” she gave him a soft smile. “Honestly, I think he likes you more than he wants you to know. Maybe don’t think too much about it and just enjoy it.”
“Come on, Harry!” Ron exclaimed, his tone sounding just a bit whiny as he gestured to the chessboard he had set up near the fireplace. “There’s nothing else to do anyways.”
Draco panicked slightly and grabbed shirt, pulling him harder than he meant to so that Harry ended up laying completely on top of him. “I like you as more than a friend,” he whispered urgently and pressed his lips to Harry’s.
Harry was right, it didn’t take long. When they entered the common room, Ron refused to look at either of them, his face and neck turning a bright red. “What took you so long?” Hermione asked as they sat on the sofa across from her and Pansy. Blaise was sitting with some other Slytherins across the room and Greg wasn’t in sight. Ron was in an armchair that he had dragged over next to the sofas.
“I think you’re an asshole,” Harry growled.
“Now is as good as ever,” Draco grinned.
“You’ve been having tea with my mother every Sunday since the trials?”
“If you’re looking for coffee, I have a cup keeping warm for you on the table,” Malfoy said against the shell of his ear. He turned Harry around slowly and leaned in close. “Although, I do expect a proper thank you for being so thoughtful.”
Draco quickly dusted him off again, smirking as he said, “We’ll be finished sooner if you can manage to stay clean for a few minutes.”
“Lucky for you, if they can’t beat Harry, they won’t have the right to challenge for him,” Ron shrugged. “And he’s stronger than he looks.”
“I didn’t see anything. Nothing at all. I have nothing to talk about,” Ron’s words came out in a rush as his face grew impossibly redder.
As soon as his knot went down, Draco slid gently out of Harry and used some cleaning charms before helping him dress. His only thought was that Harry was tired and needed to rest. Dressing quickly, he picked Harry up easily and carried him out of the clearing. As they passed Ginny, she was awake and fighting to get free. Her muffled screams followed them until they passed Harry’s fake barrier.
“So when should we start acting like we’re together?” Harry asked as he turned and leaned against the windowsill.
Draco was just about to quit when he heard his name. He looked to see who had addressed him. Blaise was grinning at him in a way that was distinctly unsettling while glancing between him and Potter. “Dare,” Draco said before he could think, quickly realising that he should have said truth.
“Oh, I almost forgot,” Potter said. Draco followed him and was truly surprised to see a library that was larger than expected. “I present to you the Black family library. Or I suppose the Potter family library now,” he shrugged.
Harry looked a bit sad, which surprised Draco until he said, “So, you like being close to me just because we’re friends?” He sounded so disappointed that it made Draco’s heart clench. He pushed away and started to get up.
“Yea,” Ron agreed. “And it’s pretty late. “I’m sure I'll see you all in the morning.”
“I’ve come to collect Harry,” Draco said, his drawling voice snide and annoyed. “I can’t believe the two of you were still sleeping.”
On the third floor Draco was shocked to see the condition of the master bedroom. Potter explained that Sirius had kept Buckbeak in there as a way to defy his mother since it had been her room. “I thought it was funny at the time, but now as the one that has to clean it up,” he shook his head. “It’s not so funny anymore.”
“I don’t think that he would,” Blaise said, his tone less harsh than before.
“He’s not,” Draco scowled. “He’s into me.” He slid a bit closer to Harry.
“You look good enough to eat, my darling,” he practically purred in Harry’s ear before kissing his neck. “I see the ladies are making us wait,” he said to the others.
“Oh,” Neville muttered, clearly at a loss for words. Harry stepped quietly back up the hall to his room, not wanting them to know he’d overheard.
“That’s actually not a bad idea,” Hermione surprised Harry by saying. “I don’t think anyone would believe that you were actually interested in one of the Slytherin girls though.”
“I’m ready,” Harry said softly and started to remove his clothing. He blushed as Draco took in his naked body for a moment before taking off his own clothing. Kneeling under the tree, he presented himself to his alpha.
“Well, what would you suggest?” Harry raised an eyebrow. “My dearest?”
They stepped into the common room to wait for everyone else. Harry was surprised to see Greg waiting patiently by one of the fireplaces. His traditional formal robes straining across his broad shoulders. “You look nice, Greg,” Harry said as they walked over.
Draco laughed and felt touched by the sentiment. “I’ll come see you first chance I have. I promise.” He hugged her just as tightly. “I don’t want to wake Greg since he works tonight, but will you tell him for me?”
The day of the Yule Ball was a bit hectic. Pansy and Hermione disappeared after breakfast, refusing to allow anyone but Harry in and they kicked him out after he brought them lunch. It then became Harry’s job to calm Ron, who had decided at the last minute to wear a Muggle style suit instead of traditional wizards robes. Harry kept assuring him that he looked great, but it was to no avail.
“I don’t see why you’re all so calm,” Harry huffed. “I can’t stand reporters.”
“Never apologize for a job well done, Potter.”
“You’re not wrong,” Draco agreed. “Alright, then. I accept your offer.” He stood and followed Harry to his room. He pretended to ignore Harry’s glances as he stripped to his boxers and climbed into bed. When Harry crawled in next to him, he acted on impulse and pulled him closer, cuddling up against his back. “Is this alright?”
“So take someone that doesn’t like you,” Ron shrugged. “If you have a date, even if they don’t like you, it’ll get everyone else to leave you alone.”
Draco was about to agree when Minister Shacklebolt stepped into the clearing at the edge of the hunting grounds. A quick Sonorous charm amplified his voice for the gathered crowd. “I would like to thank each of you for coming today. Everyone that is not participating in the hunt should head up to the observation area so that you’ll be able to see any couples that emerge from the hunting grounds.
“Glad I could help,” Hermione laughed.
A few hours later, Draco stared at the ceiling of his room. His fingers gently running through Harry’s hair as he snored against his chest. It had taken them a long time to get to this moment, but Draco knew that it would be worth the wait.
If you made it this far, I hope you enjoyed it. Thank you for sticking around. This is officially my longest fic and I hope it didn't get to rushed towards the end because I wanted to get it finished. I have a bad habit of starting fics and leaving them in the wip pile. Thank you all for the lovely comments and kudos. They mean more than you know.
“Who was right?” Harry asked.
“Your hair was tickling my nose,” Draco said as he stood up from the bed. “You were the one using me as a pillow, if I decide to pet you I should be allowed,” he laughed.
“I suppose that’s alright,” Harry said, calming down quickly. “I guess I’ll have the stew. It’s always good.”
“You did?”
Harry caved in and gave him a small laugh. “Fine, Malfoy. You win. I’ll trust you for now.”
“We have to give them a little or they’ll hang us out to dry,” Draco shrugged. “Think of all the bad press you’ve gotten. If you had taken the time to give them just a little bit of the truth, they wouldn’t have been able to lie so much about you. Always give them just a bit. Just enough to keep them back.”
“I don’t have a preference,” Harry said as he moved to pull back the covers.
“Well, if you wanted different things you wouldn’t have been happy together after a while,” Potter mumbled. Draco gave him a look and he seemed to realise what he had said. “I guess it’s not so much a heartbreak as me mourning a future that never really existed then.”
He had a glint in his eyes that made Harry nervous. “Let me up, Draco.”
“Yea, well don’t be whining to us if he hexes you,” Weasley huffed.
“I’m here, Hermione,” Harry called out. “Come on in.”
“Scared, Potter,” Draco stood, towering over him. The little git barely came up to Draco’s shoulder.
After a quick breakfast, Draco suggested they head to the kitchen before going to Hagrid’s. Harry agreed that it made more sense to bring Hagrid cakes the elves had made instead of having to turn down his own cooking. The elves happily obliged and packed a large basket full of tea cakes, biscuits, and other sweets.
Pansy stared at Ron in expectation until he blurted out, “You’re so hot.” This seemed to be enough to satisfy her since she took his arm and started leading him out of the room.
“Shall we?” he asked Draco.
“I am,” Neville scowled. “His scent is really strong this way.”
“Oy, mate,” Ron said, looking very seriously at Harry. “You’ve messed up. Now you have Hermione and Malfoy making you study.” He cracked up laughing and flinched sideways, watching Hermione’s elbow.
Malfoy followed her eyes and grinned, shaking his head. “It was tiresome to keep up the facade. We’re both too busy to keep trying to schedule time together.”
Draco’s heart warmed a bit and it felt like his stomach did a little flip. He grinned down at Harry, “When do we start?”
He had seen what could happen to someone that presented as omega first hand when Pansy had presented in Herbology. She was the first to present omega. They’d had several alphas already, but most students were betas. She had stood up, telling Professor Sprout that she felt faint and feverish. Before she could leave the greenhouse, her scent had washed over everyone. Harry thought she smelled nice, like someone he wanted to take care of, but apparently she smelled of something else to the alphas. Ron had flown into a rage, fighting three other students before pulling her into a storage shed. Hermione had been worried for Pansy, but she had been more than willing to go with him from what Harry had seen.
When the bedroom was finally clean to Draco’s standards, he insisted that Potter use the shower first. He was fairly certain he only won that argument because he insisted that he had to unpack his trunk first. It was a large relief to be able to put his things away. Having space for his clothing was a luxury he had taken for granted. He looked around the room when he was finished and smiled at his favorite books and photos now sitting on the bureau. He didn’t know how long this room would be his, but he planned to enjoy it.
His entire career at Hogwart’s, Draco had thought Muggle studies was a waste of time. At first, thanks to his father, he thought he was above it. He thought wizards were better than Muggles. After returning to Hogwart’s, he had thought it was a waste because he felt that his time was better spent on things that would actually help him get a job. After experiencing his first class with the new professor, he had changed his mind.
“There’s studying to do,” Hermione remarked from behind the pile of books she had stacked on a nearby table.
“Sounds good, love,” Draco agreed. They ushered Molly out of the kitchen and returned their focus to the party.
Everyone settled in to pass out presents, Molly teared up when she unwrapped a lovely green scarf from Narcissa. “I didn’t have time to do more shopping so I hope these are alright,” she said passing lumpy packages to Narcissa, Draco, Pansy, and Blaise. “I didn’t want anyone to feel left out. Thankfully, Hermione was able to help or I wouldn’t have finished them on time.”
Draco was quiet for a moment as he looked down at his mother. After he had thought about it, he said, “I don’t know what it means to like him as more than a friend. I’ve never liked being around anyone this much.  I like spending time with him and he makes me laugh.”
Draco and Harry share a kiss and help decorate for the festivities.
“Take it easy on him,” Draco shrugged. “Ron beat the hell out of him already and he might not realise what he almost missed by going in there.”
“I’m not certain that I’m not dreaming myself,” Draco chuckled. “Everything seems perfect.”
Malfoy chuckled, but didn’t pull away. “And I think you want me to kiss you. You want me to do it so that you can pretend that you didn’t want it. But if you want me, you have to come to me.” He licked his lips, his tongue lightly touching Harry’s lip as he did. He started to pull away slowly, shrugging as he did, “Goodnight, Harry.”
Potter chuckled in disbelief, “We literally spend everyday together. I talk to you more than I talk to Ron and Hermione. Of course we’re friends, you pratt.”
“Sounds good to me,” he nodded. “I’ll help you get it cleaned up. It shouldn’t take too long.”
The first class had been a bit awkward with Draco being paired with Potter, but when he made a joke about Granger not being able to punch him so easily now Potter had actually laughed. It lightened up the atmosphere and the two were able to work well together.
Harry’s laughter at Ron’s situation died in his throat as Draco stepped into the room. He was also wearing a Muggle style suit that was dark blue with grey accents and a grey vest. His stormy eyes flashed with heat when he saw Harry. A wolfish grin spread across his face as he stalked across the room to his date.
“Oh, I see now,” Draco nodded his head. “I used to think that I’d end up married to Pansy. She was always there. She was familiar and reliable. It was easy to let myself believe that we were meant to be together. But we’ve both grown. I want children eventually, but I want to make something of myself first. I need to prove to myself that I can make it in the world as Draco. Not just as a Malfoy. Pansy doesn’t understand that. She’s perfectly happy to continue on as a little princess and let someone else take care of her.” He moved his hand up and started running his fingers through Potter’s hair. It was softer than he’d expected. “It took us both some time to accept that we just weren’t meant to be.”
Harry stood slowly and stretched, his cheeks heating as he noticed Malfoy watching him again. “When did you get so bossy?” he muttered as he headed to the bedroom.
Harry sighed and smiled at his best friend. “That’s the problem, Hermione. I do like it. He kissed me.” He looked at her and shook his head. “And it was really nice. Like better than anyone else.”
Narcissa pulled hers on over her dress and grinned. “It’s lovely, Molly. Thank you.”
Draco pulled Harry onto the dance floor, dipping him quickly and making him laugh. They soon lost track of time as they enjoyed the music, dancing together and with their friends. Harry danced mostly with Draco, but a few times with Hermione and Pansy, and several times just all of them in a big circle. It was the most fun he’d had in a very long time.
Harry woke up slowly, his head fuzzy as remnants of his usual nightmares lingered. He wondered briefly if they’d ever go away. Poking his head out of his curtains, he saw that it was still quite dark. As he considered the merits of going back to sleep, he heard the door click open and shut. “Ron,” he spoke softly.
Draco knelt behind him, kissing his neck and holding him close for a moment. “Thank you, Harry,” he whispered against his skin. He lightly pushed Harry forward onto his hands and used his free hand to grip his ass. When Harry was bent all the way forward, Draco rubbed his puffy hole, smiling as slick coated his finger. He pressed his finger into Harry gently, pumping it in and out for a few strokes before easily adding a second. He scissored his two fingers, stretching Harry as quickly as he dared without hurting him. Adding a third finger had Harry pressing back against him, whining for more. Removing his fingers, he lined himself up and asked softly, “Is this what you want?”
As people arrived at the party, Harry calmed down a bit. He had too much to do to be nervous. The turnout was bigger than he had expected with most of their friends and Hermione’s colleagues showing up along with the Weasley’s. Harry was happy that he hadn’t caved in to Molly about having the party at the Burrow. There wouldn’t have been room for everyone. There was barely room for everyone here at Grimmauld. People were in the parlour, the dining room, and the garden. He had even found a few people leaving the kitchen after Kreacher had chased them out.
Macmillan just stared at him for a moment before grinning with mischief in his eyes, “Are you into girls or blokes?”
Harry sighed as he entered his new dormitory. McGonagall had decided to sort the seventh years and returning eighth years, putting Hermione into Hufflepuff and Harry and Ron into Slytherin. Several other students changed houses, as well, but most remained the same.
“I am happy, mother,” Draco said. He smiled when he realised that he meant it.
As he crawled into the bed, he heard Malfoy call out, “Since you started listening.”
“It’s time to get up,” Draco spoke clearly as he hit Harry with a pillow. “No lazing about when we have work to do.”
“Yea, I know, Mione,” Weasley agreed. I just don’t know what to do about him. I’ve tried talking to him and he told me that I wouldn’t understand because I’ve never had my heart broken.” He shook his head slightly, “And Ginny isn’t helping at all because she keeps asking me if he’s alright. I told her to bugger off.”
Ron gave him a cheeky grin before yelling across the common room, “Oi! Malfoy! You wanna play chess with me?”
“Is chicken alright?” Potter asked. “If not, we can have something else.”
When Harry was finished showering, Draco showed him where his things were and headed to the bathroom himself. He took care of his necessities and took a quick shower. He usually took a little longer, but he was tired and wanted to be rested for practice tomorrow. When he stepped out of the bathroom, Harry was sitting on the end of his bed with a book. He looked up at him and grinned.
“If you knew it was me, why bother meeting for an interview?” Draco asked, feeling annoyed at having come out for nothing. “We both know you won’t hire me. You hate me and rightly so.”
“I didn’t say anything,” Harry said, still grinning as he pulled a shirt over his head. Draco rolled his eyes and found his slippers, taking Harry’s hand as they left the room and headed to the drawing room to find his mother.
When potions was over, Draco insisted on holding Harry’s hand and walking him to his next class. Harry was going to argue with him about it until he saw a Slytherin girl glaring at them. “Is she the reason for this?” he whispered.
“It’s Draco, darling and yes. I am quite serious.” He shrugged his shoulders, “You didn’t specify the duration or type of favor.”
“You can call me Harry too,” he grinned. “That is my name after all.” He shrugged, the smile never leaving his face. “She wrote to me after the trials thanking me for speaking on your behalf and invited me for tea. We had a really nice chat and she invited me back. Now I go every Sunday.”
Hagrid was visibly surprised to see Draco with Harry, but he welcomed him in and gave them both tea. He was quick to dig into the sweets even though he told them that they shouldn’t have brought them. They had a nice visit and shortly before lunch, Hagrid remembered that he was supposed to help Professor Flitwick with the Christmas trees so he sent them off while he looked for his coak.
“Why should I?” she huffed. “He’s my best friend and I’ve been worried sick.” She pulled her arm free and ran to Harry. Malfoy just rolled his eyes and let her hug Harry.
“Potter.”
“Harry, I’ve been looking for you everywhere,” Draco said, his voice laced with worry as he pulled him against his chest. “I’ve got you. We’ll be alright.”
“You don’t think he’s with Harry?” Hermione asked, her eyes going wide.
“I don’t want to go out with a fan, Ron,” Harry shook his head. “They only like me because I’m in the papers.”
He shrugged again, “Yea. She’s really nice.”
“Yea, I’d love to have a big family to fill up this big house,” he said. “I’ve spent a lot of time with the Weasley’s and their house is so warm and full of love. That’s what I want. What about you? Any plans for a future generation of little Malfoys?”
“That might work, but I don’t really know of anyone that doesn’t like me,” Harry sighed, slumping back in his chair.
Harry picked up a dainty cup and examined it. “Those are narcissus flowers,” Draco smiled as he showed Harry the matching teapot. “This is exactly what I was looking for. Did you find anything good?”
He smiled as Malfoy told him a story that his mother used to tell him when he had nightmares as a child, falling into a gentle sleep as he listened to the smooth cadence of his voice. When he woke the next morning, Malfoy was still beside him, holding his hand as he slept. He looked softer in his sleep, less pointy than Harry remembered. As he watched his chest rise and fall, Harry found himself missing the Gryffindor tower just a little less than yesterday.
“Yea, that would be nice,” he said softly before kicking off his shoes and climbing into Harry’s bed.
“I told you I want to be alone,” Potter mumbled from his bed, his voice muffled. His back was to the door and Draco assumed that he had a pillow against his head.
“Are you alright?” Draco asked, offering a hand.
“You can’t sleep on the sofa,” Harry protested. “It’ll be murder on your back.”
Potter nodded his head as if he understood. “I’ve never liked feeling like that,” he agreed.  He was quiet for a moment and then added, “I’ll be here for a bit while Teddy plays. Do you want to go get your stuff and I’ll wait for you?”
“What’s so funny?” Hermione asked, looking confused. Pansy rolled her eyes, ignoring them both.
“Can I ask you guys a question?” Pansy looked between them. “If you can’t answer it, I understand.”
When the final guests were either in bed or gone, Harry felt exhausted and was ready for bed himself. “What are you doing?” he asked when he saw Draco stretching out on the sofa.
“But I didn’t have an alpha and I was getting sick,” Harry pushed. “Neville didn’t get sick.”
Draco smiled slowly, feeling powerful as he watched Potter’s reaction to him. He loosened his belt and pulled it free slowly. He had a brief moment where he just stared at Potter while trying to decide what to remove next. He decided to go ahead with his socks. There was absolutely no way to look sexy removing socks so he pulled them off quickly, thankful that he didn’t fall while doing so.
“I think you’re both worried over nothing,” Hermione chimed in. “Yes it seems fast, but we’ve all known each other for years now. There’s a very thin line between love and hate. If they’re both happy, leave them be. We’ve all had to grow up entirely too quickly. Let them have this.”
Harry relaxed against him, feeling content as he drifted off to sleep. He could definitely get used to this.
“Good point.” Harry let Draco pull him in for another hug. Grinning against his chest, he realized that this could actually work.
He caught a faint hint of Harry’s scent as he headed the other direction, but it seemed to be coming from behind an exterior barrier. That was odd, they shouldn’t be able to go beyond the barriers. Before he could think too much about it, he saw movement near the corner of his eye. He braced himself, quickly grabbing his wand he managed to use a Protego in time to deflect the curse aimed at him.
“I suppose we should get a bite to eat,” Draco suggested.
Harry’s cheeks turned a bit pink as he retorted, “I’m not sure there’s room at this table for the three of us.” When Draco gave him a questioning look, he added, “You, me, and your ego.”
Harry writhed beneath him as he moved lower, hooking his thumbs in the waist of Harry’s pajamas. “Yes?” he asked, starting to slide them lower.
Harry tried to wrestle his pillow away while trying to squirm out from under Draco. “Shove off, you pratt,” Harry groaned.
“Ugh, yea. I guess that’s alright,” Ron said, looking confused.
“It will look better if we stay back,” Malfoy shrugged. “Just trust me. I’m better at these things than you.”
“I think I’d like that,” Harry said sleepily as he cuddled closer to Draco.
“Oh, it’s you,” Ron muttered. “What do you want this early?”
The drawing room was the best, in his opinion. Swags and candles graced the mantle where his mother had put stockings for the three of them. A large tree, trimmed in red and silver, sat in the corner by the window, the fairy lights twinkling and reflecting off of the glass. His mother had tasked the house elves with gathering the gifts they had gotten for their friends and placing them under the tree. Festive pillows were on the sofas with fuzzy blankets in a basket near the hearth. Draco felt excited for Christmas for the first time in years and when he saw the joy on Harry’s face, he knew this would be a Christmas worth remembering.
The day after Christmas wasn’t quite as laid back with Draco and Harry resuming their practice. They started after breakfast and only stopped for lunch because Narcissa made them. “I’ve been doing some reading in the library,” she informed them as they ate. “I think that the methods you’re using were once much more common. There are depictions of wizards with swords and other weapons predating Hogwart’s.”
When his focus returned to Potter, he was mildly surprised to find him standing just a few steps away. “Is everything alright, Potter?” he asked when the other man just stared at him.
“Glad to hear you have a plan,” she said, her tone approving. “I suppose I’ll let you get back to your studies. Behave yourselves.”
“I’m happy you’re here,” Harry grinned up at him before turning back to check that his food didn’t burn.
“I’m sure I’ll manage,” Draco said coolly as he stood from the sofa. He strode away from the pair and down the corridor that led to the dorms. He knocked briefly on Potter’s door before entering and shutting the door behind him.
“Is everything alright,” Harry asked, wondering how much he’d tell him.
Draco looked at the pizza that Pansy had placed on the counter, scrunching his nose in disgust. It wasn’t that he didn’t like pizza, it’s just that they had eaten pizza almost daily for the last four weeks. He supposed he should be thankful that they had anything to eat at all. Money was tight and the pizza place where Pansy worked let her keep anything left over at the end of her shift. He was thankful, but he missed having house elves.
“You’re not interrupting anything, Mother,” Draco sighed, his cheeks flushing. “Harry’s just gotten in the shower.”
“Ugh!” Ron grumbled. “I think I’m gonna be sick.”
“In me,” Harry said, his now sensitive prick rubbing the bed, leaving a trail of cum.
“Harry, are you alright?” she asked.
“Oh, I see you have good taste,” the woman said. “That’s enchanted so that it will always fit the wearer and the stone flips open like a locket so that you can hide a little note inside. Would you like it? We offer discreet delivery,” she added, looking over his shoulder at Draco.
Today's prompt was ward. I hope you enjoy.
“Is her cooking that bad?” Potter asked, grinning over his shoulder at Draco.
“Do you have any conditions for me?”
Harry inhaled the steam coming from the mug and sighed, “It’s perfect. Thank you.” He sipped it slowly, the steam fogging his glasses. The tea really was perfect. Not too sweet with just a small splash of cream, just how he liked it.
By the time Molly and Arthur left, everyone had started drinking a bit heavier. Draco had taken Hermione to his room to sleep after she’d had a few too many fire whiskeys and had started singing at the top of her lungs. Several of their friends were sleeping in spare bedrooms and everyone else was heading home.
“I didn’t know you could play,” Potter said as he dusted himself off. “Hermione can play, but she said it needs to be tuned.”
“Do you want to talk about it?” Harry asked as he climbed into bed next to him.
Harry moaned and hissed, lapsing into Parseltongue as Draco bobbed his head up and down, sucking him in before sliding off to the tip. He wrapped his tongue around the head like it was a delicious treat before sucking him in again. He pulled away briefly, reaching through the curtains to grab Harry’s wand from the nightstand. He muttered a quick spell and pressed a lubed finger against Harry’s asshole as he started to suck him off again. “Yes?” he asked, his lips against Harry’s prick and his finger circling his tight hole.
As they started to eat breakfast, Narcissa began excitedly, “So, I have had a busy morning while the two of you were sleeping in.” She ignored the blushing and kept going. “As it is Christmas Eve, I think you two should take a break from your practice to enjoy the holiday. I have sent invitations to your friends to come over this evening for a small dinner party and they’ve all accepted.” She was smiling broadly and seemed quite pleased with herself. “Honestly, Harry, I wasn’t certain your Weasley friends would accept, but I’m quite happy that they did.” She continued to fill them in on the plans for the evening as they ate and then enlisted them to help finish decorating the dining room and drawing room.
“You’re my best mate,” he groaned. “You have to say I look nice.”
“I hope I’m not interrupting,” she winced. “I know you’re of age and all and I don’t want to pry.”
“It’s fine. I get them, too,” Malfoy admitted. He seemed to be looking through Harry for a moment before coming back to himself. “Do you want to talk about it? It helps sometimes.”
“And what happens in six months or a year when he gets bored and kicks you out. Where would you go then?” Draco asked. “And besides, Blaise can be a little crazy. If I ever became desperate enough to sell myself, it wouldn’t be to him.”
Once they were in Harry’s bed with the hangings closed, Harry turned to look at Draco. “Tonight was amazing,” he grinned. “I wish it could last longer though.”
As they left the Great Hall, Pansy pulled Hermione to the side. “Is it alright that I’m going to Hogsmeade with Weasley?” she asked. At Hermione’s confused look, she added, “Since we’re trying to get along, I wanted to make sure. I tend to flirt, but if we’re to be friends then I know he’s off limits.”
When the music finally died down and everyone started to filter out, they snuck to the kitchens for snacks before heading back to the common room. Hermione didn’t complain about Greg sweeping her into his arms and carrying her this time. Her shoes were in her hand and she just melted against him. Harry couldn’t blame her. If Draco had tried to carry him, he would have let him.
“Yea, I’m just grabbing my stuff,” he said.
“You’ll feel better if you socialize,” she had pleaded. “And tomorrow’s Saturday so you can read alone in your room all day if you want.”
“Actually, we helped,” Harry spoke up and Hermione elbowed Ron in the ribs. “We worked really hard, but it was fun. I’ve never gotten to decorate a tree before.”
“If you leave it to me, I’ll have you there tonight so we can start first thing in the morning,” Potter chuckled.
“Why are you always so stubborn, Potter?” Malfoy wiped a hand over his face. “Just admit that you felt better when I was closer. It’s honestly that simple.” He rolled his eyes when he saw Potter slumping down the wall. “Damn it, you stubborn little git.” He walked over and pulled him to his feet. “I’m starting to think that the Prophet was right and you do have a death wish,” he grumbled as he pulled him against his chest.
“Afternoon, Malfoy,” he called out as he approached the bench. “Teddy,” he said as he put the boy on the ground, “Say hello to Draco.”
“Thank you, let's dig in,” Potter said as he handed Draco some silverware. Before he sat down, he picked up a metal plate from the corner and put food on it. He set it inside what looked to be a cupboard before coming back to take the seat across from Draco. When he saw the look on Draco’s face, he shrugged and explained, “Kreacher won’t eat in here so I put his food in his cupboard. And it has to be on that certain plate that his mistress gave him or he won’t eat at all.” He rolled his eyes. “Hermione thinks that I should free him, but he’s old and if I don’t take care of him who will.”
“Yea, or I wouldn’t have asked,” Harry rolled his eyes.
He turned when Harry entered the room, completely stopping for a moment as he stared at him. Harry felt his cheeks heat under his intense gaze, not completely certain as to why. The whistling of a tea kettle startled them both and drew Malfoy’s attention. “Sit,” he said over his shoulder.
At Pansy’s surprised look, he shrugged, “I’m not going to hurt a beta on purpose. I’m not a monster.”
“So why are you attacking me?”
As he focused on his attacker, he was surprised to see Neville. “I thought you were going for Blaise?” he asked, confused as he tried to make sure no one else was coming.
“I did, but don’t ask me what because I don’t want to tell you.”
“Almost?”
He blinked slowly, trying to sit up. He finally recognized Malfoy above him, realizing that he must be very close for Harry to be able to see him so clearly without his glasses. “What’s wrong?”
Malfoy propped himself up on his elbow and looked down at Harry, “You’ll know when you’re ready. It will just feel right. My guess is that you’re tired and feeling unsettled so you’re just looking for something to make you feel better.”
Draco hated attending Ministry functions. He always had. Ever since he was small and had to attend with his parents. They were boring and stuffy. There was nothing fun about networking with these dodgy old politicians. Nothing at all.
Harry ran as fast as he could through the empty corridors. If he could get to the Room of Requirement, he’d be safe. He had to hide until he could figure out how to get away from everyone altogether.
“She’s got a point mate,” Ron agreed.
“Not even a little,” Draco sighed.
“Lucky for you, you caught me in a moment of true and utter boredom,” Malfoy said as he stood. Now that he was actually looking down at Harry, he smirked, “Please feel free to lead the way.”
“Yes, barely,” Draco rolled his eyes and plucked two drinks from a passing waiter, offering one to the Weasel. “I hate these things, but if I don’t show my handsome face they’ll think I’ve reverted to my dastardly ways.”
“Yea,” Harry muttered. “I just want to be done with this. Hermione was right. I shouldn’t have done it. When the horn went off, everyone came straight for me. I knew there’d be several, but I didn’t expect that many.” He shook his head slowly. “I just want to leave, but I can’t get to any of the exits alone.”
Harry toyed with the buttons on his shirt as he read. He felt completely at ease as he listened to the timbre of Draco’s voice, the sound of his heart beating relaxing him further. He lost track of time as they lay together, only realising how much time had passed when his stomach rumbled. Before he could consider being embarrassed, Draco’s stomach grumbled and he chuckled.
Draco stopped him before he went into his room, pulling him close and kissing his neck. “Don’t forget what happens if you keep me waiting,” he whispered against Harry’s skin. He smiled down at him before going to his own room.
The two other bedrooms on this floor were much the same as the ones below. Four poster beds with tattered hangings, lofty ceilings, sturdy detailed furniture that was covered in dust. Draco was surprised to see a bathroom on this floor, as well.
“Oh, you’ve finally remembered that I’m here, have you?” Myrtle whined as he headed to the sinks.
“It’s relatively new and we didn’t want the focus to be on us today,” Harry shrugged. “I think it’s close to time for Hermione’s cake. I think the garden has the most space so everyone can see it.”
“I’m sorry it took me so long to find you,” he whispered against Harry’s neck.
“Good,” Draco scoffed. “I’m bloody great.” He gave Harry a look that made him wonder if he was still talking about potions.
“Yes,” Harry sighed, surprised that he had answered honestly.
“Yes, Potter,” Draco sighed against his neck. “It’s ok and we are fine.” He pushed Harry up so he could look at him, “Do you want to kiss some more or go to sleep?”
“Yea, I can manage that,” Potter said and started pulling them free from the posts. The last corner seemed to be stuck and instead of using his wand or asking for help, he tugged at it as hard as he could, toppling over when it ripped.
Draco stared into the fire, watching the logs pop and crackle. All he wanted was some small semblance of peace, but Potter’s friends insisted on ruining it with their idle chatter. They all had a tentative truce since returning to Hogwart’s and he was doing his best to keep his mouth shut because he didn’t want to break first. However, it was becoming increasingly difficult to ignore them. He finally gave up, deciding that eavesdropping would be better than being irritated.
“I don’t particularly care what you want, Potter,” Draco stated as he moved to stand next to the bed.
“People change. You shouldn’t judge someone based on decisions they made when they were young and had no choices,” Harry rolled his eyes.
Draco rolled his eyes. “I can’t believe she didn’t tell me. She did say to tell you hello. I guess I’ll be joining you both for Sunday tea.” He walked over to the piano and started siphoning the dust off as he muttered, “I can’t believe he had a standing tea invitation and she didn’t even tell me. She didn’t even invite me.”
“Thanks,” Harry grinned. He spoke quietly, telling Malfoy about the nightmare.
“For you, Potter,” Draco smirked, “I’ve got five.”
“And I just want some quiet in the common room, but your little friends won’t stop whining with concern about you,” he watched Potter for a moment waiting for him to do something, but he just lay there. All these years of taunting and fighting and he wouldn’t even look back at Draco. This simply wouldn’t do at all. “Listen, Potter, your friends are driving me mad. If you don’t get up, I’m coming in there with you.”
“I’m not sure,” Harry whispered. When Malfoy shrugged and rolled onto his back, Harry wondered if that was something that he wanted. “No one’s ever held me like that. At least, not that I remember.”
“Here’s a bit of information you won’t find in any textbook, Potter,” Malfoy sneered as he stepped into Harry’s personal space, “If an omega doesn’t maintain a certain proximity to their alpha, they can become deathly ill. This only happens in fated mates. You were meant for me and no one else.”
“They usually do,” Hermione grinned as she pulled the beanie off her head and smoothed her curls. “If not, maybe we can push two together.”
“Yea, sorry about that,” Malfoy grinned as he found his trousers and pulled his wand from his pocket. “This should help until we can get you to a shower,” he said before Harry felt the tingle of magic. The cleaning charm felt cool against his heated skin. “Here,” he added, handing Harry his clothing.
------------------------------
“You’re being an ass again,” Harry muttered.
Potter laughed and shook his head, “I’m just happy to have someone here to eat some of it. I can’t seem to figure out how to cook for just me. There’s always leftovers.”
Harry tried not to feel too disappointed when he woke up in bed alone the next morning. As he crawled out of the large bed, he was thankful to see that his trunk had been brought in. He quickly pulled on socks and changed into his favorite jeans, but he debated about changing his shirt. Malfoy’s jumper was warm and soft and he didn’t think that he was quite ready to relinquish his hold on it just yet. He’d wait and just wear it for now.
“I got the job. You’ll never guess who I’ll be working for,” Draco shook his head, not quite believing it himself.
Draco gave him that wolfish grin and rose from the bed, stalking towards him and making him feel small. “I did not. Are you saying that you find me attractive, darling?” He reached out to caress Harry’s face, carefully as if he was afraid Harry would run.
“Yea,” Draco nodded and stood. “That would be fine.”
“Well best of luck to you,” Ron said, nodding his head towards Draco.
He wasted no more time on Cornfoot. Jumping to his feet he bolted, running as fast as he could into the hunting grounds. He saw Cormac McLaggen standing at a forked path, sniffing both directions. Draco slammed into him, sending him rolling into a tree. He hit his head and tried to stand, but seemed to be a bit unsteady. Draco kicked him square in the chest, knocking the wind out of him.
“Not that I could find,” Narcissa said. “You might want to check the school library or talk to your professor about it. If she doesn’t know, she may know where to look.”
“I accidentally channeled magic through my sword like a wand,” Potter beamed up at him. “I didn’t think that something like that could happen, but it did. I think if we practice, we could learn to do it on purpose.”
“This is so much more than I expected,” he mumbled into Draco’s shoulder. When he pulled away, his eyes were slightly damp, but he was beaming from ear to ear. “I didn’t even know that I had a family crest.”
“Let’s get to the library,” Draco said, shaking his head. He stood and held out a hand for Harry.
When they reached the main entrance, Hermione was pacing with Pansy and Ron trying to calm her down. When she saw Harry, she tried to run to him, but Pansy grabbed her arm. “Ask Draco before you approach him,” Pansy warned.
When he finally finished the tea, Malfoy took his cup, “Go to bed. I’ll be there shortly.”
Harry couldn’t help but to smile a little. He shook his head when Malfoy finally stopped laughing. “Listen, I know it sounds completely mad, but it makes sense.” He paused to make sure he had Malfoy’s attention. “I don’t want to go with anyone that only likes me because I’m The Harry Potter.”
“Yea, alright,” Harry nodded, smiling. “Thank you, Cissa.”
“Of course I am,” Malfoy actually smiled at him. “Now that it benefits me, I think it’s brilliant.”
They agreed that it would be best to work on casting a Protego first. It took a few tries, but within an hour both of them could cast a solid Protego from the hilt of their sword. It took another hour to be able to maintain the Protego while fighting. They took their time and continued to strengthen their shield charms and expand them. They both agreed that the stronger the shield the better.
He leaned back, grabbing Harry’s hair and pulling him up to his knees. Harry’s legs shook as Draco licked a hot stripe up his neck before biting the junction of his neck and shoulder. As blood filled his mouth, his knot grew larger making it difficult to continue sliding in and out of Harry. He thrust deep, his knot catching as he spilled his seed inside his new mate. Harry’s prick jerked, cum shooting in an arch in front of him as he came with Draco.
“Thanks,” he grinned, blushing a little. “You both look good.”
Potter just shrugged and rolled his eyes. “Both,” he said, surprising everyone other than Granger and Weasley.
“Darling, do calm down,” Draco spoke quickly, interrupting Harry before he could continue to yell at the reporter. “Listen, Mr. Wilkes,” Draco snarled his nose as if the name tasted bad in his mouth. “If you had approached politely and requested an interview, we would have scheduled a time to oblige, but considering that you were quite rude I believe we’ll be going on our way.” He put his hand on Harry’s back and led him up the street towards Honeydukes.
He rolled his eyes, but headed into the bathroom anyway. He turned the shower on and quickly undressed. He groaned as the warm water hit him, practically melting against the wall. He took his time, wanting to be completely warm before he left the shower. When he finally emerged and wrapped himself in a towel, he realized that he had forgotten something very important.
“I usually do.”
“How observant of you, Potter,” Malfoy sneered. As Harry turned to look at him, he stood in a fluid movement and strode across the small room. “I was here first. I’ll not be sleeping on the sofa.”
“That’s the beauty of it, Potter. We already are.” When Harry looked at Malfoy in confusion, he continued, “What do you think people are going to say when word spreads that you invited me to your room? And if they find out you locked the door and put up a Silencing spell.” He shrugged and walked over to stand in front of Harry.
As they reached the pub, they spotted Ron and Pansy headed in their direction. Pansy had her arm looped through Ron’s and was practically dragging him up the street. “You have perfect timing,” she said as they drew closer. “I’m absolutely starving. Usually Blaise makes me take a break, but Ron let me look as much as I wanted. We still have two shops to go through.”
“Do you want some bread or rolls?” Draco asked. When Harry nodded, he left the table with Ron and Greg to order their food.
“I doubt it,” Ron muttered.
Potter laughed at that, his eyes lighting up in a way that made Draco smile. “I’m going to start dinner. Would you like to come see the kitchen?”
“This looks exactly like what I expected,” Harry chuckled while looking at the clean lines of the black furniture with silver and green accents. “A room fit for the Slytherin prince.”
“I don’t mind. I do like to be on the side by the door though.”
A large gust of wind swept by just as they stepped onto the road and Draco shivered, nodding his head, “Yes. I believe you’re right. Let’s get to it then.” He pulled Harry close, wrapping an arm around his shoulder and they started the walk back to the castle. “That damned Wilkes doesn’t give up easily does he?” Draco mentioned after they had walked for several minutes. He leaned over and kissed Harry briefly on the lips, smiling as he continued walking. They mostly ignored him as they continued on to the castle, occasionally whispering to each other about nothing and stealing small kisses to the sound of the camera clicking.
