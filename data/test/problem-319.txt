away from his reach, it pains Draco to even glance at his face when they pass each other by in the halls. Yet despite Draco’s avoidance and silence, he’s still here, following him at three o’clock in the morning like it’s Sixth Year all over again, like he’s afraid that Draco might inevitably tumble down some rabbit hole of dark magic, rendering his sincere testimony before Wizengamot a blatant lie, making him regret the decision to save him.
Draco could tell from the cautiousness in his voice that Potter probably has a vague idea of what the answer might be. He could lie, of course, but at this point it’s rather useless. Besides, between the two of them, there have been more than enough lies.
“Mr. Malfoy,” Draco looks up to find those blue eyes glinting mischievously at him, “You’re standing in what used to be my residence at Hogwarts.”
“I could just hire you, then.”
“Wait, Grimmauld? In London?” Draco raises an eyebrow at him in surprise. “Isn’t that the Black ancestral home?”
“Potter.” He interrupts him coldly, clenching his teeth at the sinking feeling in his stomach and starts pulling down the fabric bunched around his elbow. “I don’t need your pity.”
“Would you tell me?” The musing tone in his voice fades, and Draco finally turns to look at him. “Would you tell me if people actually target you for it?”
“Yeah, those do exist, but this is much more than your everyday
“Do you ever wonder,” They listen to the song in silence for a few moments before Potter whispers, all too quiet that it almost gets drowned out by the drumline, “if things could’ve been different, if I had shaken your hand on that first day?”
Harry pulled off his third set of robes and tossed them towards the end of his bed, just like he had with the previous two sets. They weren't even a year old, but a summer of Molly’s cooking together with 3 months of Hogwarts feasting and he had quickly grown out of them. He wasn't as tall as Ron was and never would be, but at the rate he was packing in weight and muscle he would have to buy a whole new wardrobe soon.
Kingsley stared at them both almost dispassionately before sighing and nodding to the aurors holding the couple. As they walked out Harry found himself walking automatically with them. The air outside was still hazy with smoke. Harry tried not to look around at the destroyed castle, he kept his head down and his eyes trained on the red of Kingsley’s robes.
“You did Draco a huge bloody service killing that thing Nev. By the end of it he was tall enough where that bitch could comfortably wrap around him seven times.”
takes place directly after chapter 1's Dron story.
“I didn't know. I didn't know you all spent time with him. I was just so mad and he was being so obstinate about coming here and he said that I didn't see past myself and I just got so mad.” Harry said miserably. No wonder Draco had looked so hurt by that.
“Harry, you do know that that is Draco’s school right? That he funded the schools first years? He went out and found muggle teachers who knew about the wizarding world or squibs who taught in the muggle world and had them work with pureblood wizarding tutors to create a curriculum that was beneficial to both. Tonight was the reunion for his first graduates. The first class to go to Hogwarts was going to be coming back to the school to talk about their experience and share their thoughts and ideas for improvements.” Hermione spoke softly but her words created a shockwave through Harry’s system.
“That bloody animal I swear.” Neville said beneath his breath.
Harry spun around surprised at his interruption. He snarled and drew wand at the man’s words, before realizing he was carrying Snape in his manacled arms. The sight saved him from a nasty hex but Harry wasn't going to let him get away with bringing up Sirius.
“We must hurry.” said Mr. Malfoy. He looked scared and gaunt once again, his worry beginning to break through the arrogant facade he showed earlier.
The look Malfoy gave him was all hurt and maybe even some pity but determined.
“I came as soon as you called, just like I always do.” Ron replied, one hand sliding through Draco’s hair. The other ran soothing circles around the protective cocoon holding children.
But when Harry eventually managed to pluck up his Gryffindor courage and finally kiss Malfoy’s sweet lips he decided he didn't care what Malfoy called him. So long as Harry could be the only one to taste the candied flavor of Malfoy’s mouth it didn't matter. So he drank down the sugared taste on Malfoy’s tongue until he knew every flavor it had to offer, not breaking the kiss until the need to breath overpowered the need to savor everything Malfoy was giving him.
“Of course,” he scoffed halfheartedly “how could it not?”
His mum drew in a shaky breath and reached out a hand towards red tinged blonde heads.
“I hate him. Bloody Perfect Potter my arse. Savior of the Wizarding World but only if he believes you deserve it! He-he saw me. Crying there in that bathroom. Almost like you did. And all he bloody did was make me bear his mark, just as painfully as the ones that noseless bitch burned into me! I hate them! I hate them both!”
“Well for tea of course” she answered as she engorgio’d the gift box nearly stumbling under its weight once it was full sized again.
Lost in thoughts of red headed, grey eyed babies Ron was surprised by the patronus that burst to life in front of him.
“Right, cuz that's the problem here. Malfoy, oi Malfoy.”
He led them to a table in a corner of the bar. It was small and out of the way and Harry might have cast a small muggle repelling charm when he got there to make sure it would be available for them. He cancelled the charm as they got closer and signalled a nearby waitress. She nodded back in acknowledgment.
Neville ignored him, moving towards the door, surprised to see they really were Snape’s sleeping quarters and not his office after all.
Draco coughed and cleared his throat again.
He stood next to his parents and watched as the dog illuminated the car enough to make out Draco and Blaise. It dissipated once the message had been delivered, only to be replaced by a small ferret he knew to be Blaise’s Patronus. The sight never failed to make him snicker.
im not crazy about my Draco in this one, but Snape calling him Draconis is my favorite thing ever!
Malfoy closed his eyes and Harry could tell he was silently counting in his head.
Malfoy’s eyes flashed angrily before the silvery blue orbs were wiped of all emotion.
“This is more than just saying something Draco! He put his hands on you when you told him how sorry you were for how you treated them!”
Seamus shoved him back looking at Dean expectantly.
It was far too soon to try and manhandle Malfoy across the street to the room he had decided to book for the night when he was feeling optimistic as to how the whole deal would play out. Staring at Malfoys thin waist and the tight curve of his arse, usually lost in big billowing robes he couldn't help but feel he made the right choice.
Merlin, Draco missed her every day.
Harry sighed and began his walk back up to the castle. He was tired and Draco needed a bed. As he walked he felt the vial in his pocket and wondered what kind of memories a loving godfather left their beloved godson.
Still mostly asleep he crawled into the bed and nuzzled his face into the pillow. Weasley’s shampoo was a wonderful mix of wood smoke and citrus and Draco loved it. He laid out his lovey over the pillow and laid his cheek on the cool fabric with a smile, already drifting back into sleep.
“Oh are we done already?” he asked, confusedly rising from his chair.
“Dementors are not born exactly. They're more. . . . ..brought into being.” he said.  His eyes were still trained on the boat house, switching between the door and the dementor hovering above it.
“They’re born from a soul” he repeated rather dubiously.
He only had eyes for Draco.
“And Malfoy, Draco Malfoy felt enough grief over Professor Snape to create a dementor?” he asked skeptically.
“See sweetheart this is why I'm saying you need to come. I don't want them to have another reason not to like you.” Harry reached for his hands but Mafoy stepped away from him. He frowned at him. “What now Draco? We need to get ready to go. You’ll have to change, it's a formal anniversary party tonight so we’ll need your dress robes. I'm sure whatever you had planned on wearing to the gala will be ok.”
Mrs. Malfoy had made it into the boat house, not even glancing at the spectre above her head. Her handler let her go in alone, clearly unwilling to pass beneath it. Following her lead Mr. Malfoy was also unhanded and marched inside, though Harry could see the tension in his shoulders as he made to pass.
“Ah sorry, what was that?” Harry asked. He could feel his cheeks heating up at being caught staring. Malfoy made a face.
They were having twins, and of course Ron knew his brother could never be replaced and maybe he hadn't talked to any of his other brothers, or any of his family really, in the 10 years Draco and he had been married but just having that small part of them with him meant so much. A pair of Weasley twins just for Ron and Draco was more than he could have ever imagined at the beginning of his eighth year when he and Harry had been made to room with the Slytherin.
Harry only blinked at him. He had no idea what to even begin to think about that. Truthfully it sounded more like a fairy tale than anything else, but he had the Elder wand in his hand and the Invisibility cloak in his pocket so who was he to say it wasn't true.
“He’s looking for someone.” Harry realized. The group in front of him stopped and turned to look at him, apparently surprised by his company.
That was it.
“You want me Malfoy, don't even try to deny it. I've seen the way you look at me, trust me i'm looking back the same way believe me. I want to touch every inch of you. Please baby, let me.” he begged.
"I suggest you move your pointy toes then" Harry said listlessly. He hadn't been feeling good that morning, Draco knew, perhaps he was still under the weather.
“Umm Harry?” he hesitated “ i thought you wanted to leave?”
“Yes, i suppose that’s all you’ll be able to do.”  she turned and nodded to Kingsley and held her hands out to her auror who still had Draco in his arms.
Harry heard a scream pierce the air.
One by one they each promised safety, until Ginny surprised him with a hug, whispering her promise in his ear.
Harry frowned.
pre-relationship, but you can bet Draco wakes up in bed next to Harry and Harry is a great shoulder to cry on.
“Please, just let us find him and we will all go with you.” Narcissa Malfoy pleaded with Kingsley who looked put out, but not unsympathetic.
Draco whimpered slightly but nodded. Neville nodded back and sent a patronus to Madame Pomfrey to let her know to expect them before helping Malfoy up. He heard Neville open the door, but the arm around him squeezed so tightly around his broken ribs his vision darkened and he was sure he was going to be sick. He didn't even register the reason until he heard Granger speak.
“It’s the droopy eyelids for me.”
lots of Dean Thomas. honestly this could almost be read as Draco/Dean if you wanted to.
“I had no idea if it was a lot of blood or if the water made it look worse.” his tongue trailed down the puckered flesh to where it bisected a pectoral, barely missing the dusky nipple. Neville made sure to give it attention while he was in the vicinity.
Draco narrowed his eyes at Harry and dug his toes into the leg under him.
“Thank you, yes ok, yes of course. I'm going. Maybe call Sasha? He was ready to take over the class until the end of the year for me. Right you knew that. Ok yes. I-I-I’ll go now.” Ron rambled as he pulled off his quodpot leathers wrinkling his nose at the sweat tacky clothes underneath.
He saw Mrs. Malfoy suck in a breath and tears welled in her eyes, her shoulders slumped and it seemed Harry wasn't the only one freed by the statement. He could still feel her breath in his ear asking after her only child. Next to her Lucius was nodding imperiously, as if he wasn't shackled and bleeding.
“They’re twins.”  she said, eyes flitting back and forth between identical sleeping features.
“Let go of me! I won’t be going anywhere without my son!” Lucius Malfoy yelled at the Auror who grabbed his arm.
“Well actually the boys won’t be the only set of twins pretty soon.”
i did literally ZERO editing on this so sorry for any and all mistakes. thanks for reading though!
Ron laughed letting go of some of the tension he held. He shook his head and pulled out the emergency portkey the healers had provided for both him and Draco for just these purposes. Gripping the small charm  hanging by a cord around his neck, he activated it and his vision turned dark before the bright lights of the small wizarding hospital came into view. His stomach turned as the sensation of forced apparition settled, and then he was off at a run towards the maternity ward.
Malfoy went pale, his hands clenched into fists at his side and his breathing became rapid. “It is not a pureblood school. The school is for Muggle born children to be able to learn and integrate into the magical world. To be able to better understand themselves so they won't feel so alone and freakish growing up. So they know that there are other people out there experiencing the same thing.”
The cry was loud, and high pitched, and full of so much anguish. Harry felt the grief and hopelessness of it as if it was own. He felt his chest crack open right between his ribs, the pain so real he reached up with hand to rub at the spot.
All of them turned to her, but Ron was the only one to gasp at her appearance. His mum had always been robust, with frazzled red hair and a permanent blush on her cheeks. The woman in front of him had bright white hair to rival Draco’s platinum white locks, and  her face was sallow sunken in. she was smaller, frailer than he had ever seen her. Her body was thin, bordering on emaciated. But she still stood strong, even with his fathers arm around her waist. She looked sick, but she could never look weak.
“What? Your saying that git saved you some torture?” Ron spluttered.
“If those are your reflexes, Potter then I'm not  surprised you left the aurors. Relax, I'm not going to hex you. I'm also not going to work with you any longer. I suggest you find another place of employment Potter. I'm not leaving Hogwarts and you are not staying. Understood?”
“He’s gone.” he said, surprised, until he noticed the direction Draco had been moving in.
“Maybe we should have told him we were staying in today?”
this is also kind of a sickfic though theres nothing too graphic, just an unsympathetic Draco making fun of a sick Harry.
She cleared her throat slightly and Redding  began to fidget before looking at Harry and crossing over to him.  He barely had time to shove the letter and memories into his pocket before he found himself with an armful of unconscious long limbs and pale skin. Harry looked down at Draco and then up at Mrs. Malfoy. She smiled serenely at him then with a nod from her Redding activated the portkey and they were gone.
“Oh! Actually, no I can't. The battery was fried when I texted him from inside the burrow earlier.” she grimaced.
Harry only stood, stunned at what he had learned. He knew Snape had favored his Slytherin’s. He had been especially lenient towards Malfoy, but he had no idea their relationship had run so deep. He wondered how he could have missed it for 6 years. He remembered the viciousness in Snape’s glare the night Dumbledore died when Harry chased them. And the desperate worry in his eye in Myrtle’s bathroom before he fell to his knees to heal Draco from Harry’s attack.
“Draco, if anything was going to make me see you as ugly I think it would have been the whole poisoning Ron thing, this? This is like a roadmap I get to follow.” Neville told him with a smile. At his stupid boyfriends confused look Neville couldn't help but smirk. He leaned in for a kiss that was eagerly returned. Lowering himself to his knees on the floor, he sat Draco up, moving the blanket off him completely so he could get as close as he could between his thighs. When Neville finally broke the kiss he leaned his forehead against Draco’s.
Most of the deatheaters had been stunned watching their lord crumble to ash before them. A few had gotten away, but those not quick enough had been handled easily by the aurors who had shown only seconds too late.
“What exactly have they done for me Harry? Not that I don't appreciate their acceptance but they didnt DO anything for me. I worked hard for myself. I lobbied the Wizengamot for the opportunity to complete my mastery on my own. I completed my studies at the top of my class years before anyone. I clawed my way up to my position in the Council of Magical Law alone. I took myself to therapy. I taught myself all about the muggle world in order to learn past my prejudices. I rewrote the laws that allowed muggle born children the opportunity to learn about the magical world before hogwarts. I campaigned for a greater inclusion for werewolves on my own. I dragged myself out of the mud my parents dragged me into YEARS before you or any weasley showed up, so tell me, What. Exactly. Did. They. Do. For. Me. That would excuse me not going to when I had this planned for months now?”
“I’m saying every time he refused to hurt us they punished him instead. Nagini was a great big snake did you know? She could squeeze the life out of a man. Watched her do it a couple of times actually.” Dean said watching Malfoy carefully.
******************
“Bloody hell Potter, no one is asking you to. Except maybe your dick.” Malfoy spat.
“Umm yeah? Like,you and me? It was a good date? I thought? I felt like we were on the same page anyways.” Harry felt more than a little foolish. He was wrong for having presumed of course but he pushed on. Had no desire to have his first date end on a bad note.
Harry was entranced by the flush still staining Malfoys cheeks. He took his hand once he had righted his clothing and led them both outside and around the corner to the pub. When they got there Malfoy pulled his hand from Harry’s.  Confused Harry turned around to look at him. Malfoy looked confused and agitated.
“No it’s definitely the snotty nose for me.”
Ron nodded, he knew how specialized wards had to be in order to allow electronics and he wasn't surprised his parents never had theirs updated.
"My toes are not pointy, you just don't have enough meat on your bones to protect you from them."
“You’ll take care of him won’t you Mr. Potter?” she asked, her soft, posh voice so much closer to Draco’s cadence than his fathers.
“Dammit Draco not everything is about you! We can't just not show up, and we can't cancel with only an hour's notice. How dare you even think that after everything they've done for you?”
“Do you want me to cast a patronus to get rid of it?” Harry blurted out suddenly, startling the man slightly. He sighed.
It felt like Draco was screaming directly next to him. Right into his ear and across every nerve ending Harry had.
Harry groaned out loud “what now? I thought we were done fighting.” he was done anyways. Harry might not always listen to whatever Malfoy had to say about his work but most nights they spent together he was either tired from a long day or not exactly in a talking mood.
“You know Potter, had you left the Weaselette and confessed some sort of reciprocated feelings for me afterwards, I would have been ecstatic. But that you thought I would be the kind of person to be actively complicit in this kind of thing makes me wonder who exactly  you think you have feelings for. Because it can't be me. If you knew me even a little bit you would know what family means to me and what lengths I would go to to keep them together.”
Mrs. Malfoy moved away from him, not bothering to wipe at the black tear tracks marring her face. She did straighten her shoulders and take a step forward, then another larger one, dragging her handler forward with her.
“Harry” he breathed out softly.
Harry wasn't too sure what to think about the few number of them to actually be present for the battle. Tonks and Moody had been outliers on the force, morally good and not just able to follow orders. He knew if he was going to go ahead with his plans he would have to do something about that. But for now he was ok to sit between Tonks and Remus and grieve for what was lost.
“A dementor is born from the pained scream of a soul. That’s what we heard back there.” Kingsley said motioning behind them. Harry looked back for the first time since leaving through the double doors, he was surprised to see a crowd of people hovering about and watching them. They were too far for Harry, even with his glasses, to see who they were.
It was over.
Next to him, Blaise shifted his hold on Caesar to mirror Ron’s.
Kingsley stared at them both almost dispassionately before sighing and nodding to the aurors holding the couple. As they walked out Harry found himself walking automatically with them. The air outside was still hazy with smoke. Harry tried not to look around at the destroyed castle, he kept his head down and his eyes trained on the red of Kingsley’s robes.
“Someone spotted him outside by the lake a few minutes ago” they said.
mentions of torture.
Draco shifted next to him, pulling his hand away. He looked like he wanted to say something, and Ron smiled encouragingly.
Harry had only laughed at him and let him know where they could meet. He had chosen a bigger town a ways away from Hogsmead. A small muggle pub he had never brought any of the Weasleys to. Malfoy had mentioned it once when he told Harry about hiding from angry classmates during eighth year.
Harry stared at her in confusion “why would you be seeing him on Wednesday?”
But Potter had started the year off by offering him a hand and a smile in the middle of the great hall. He made it known that he and Draco were rooming together and had put their boyhood animosity behind them. The Weasel had stood behind him with an awkward smile, while Granger looked like a proud mother. Potter then proceeded to almost never be in the room. He was either with his she-weasel, or getting back into quidditch shape along with Weasley. The two were constantly flying and practicing in preparation for the tryouts with the professional teams next off season, leaving Draco alone in the room most of the time.
Ron cast his patronus, bringing up his favorite image of a topless Draco sitting on their bed with two red haired infants between his legs making funny faces at them. The look on Draco’s face when they laughed for the first time never failed to bring forth a blindingly bright, giant bullmastiff. The large dog  bounded down the lane to Draco.
“Okaaaaay” Malfoy trailed off warily, pulling away from Harry and pulling on his jacket.
“Dementor” he whispered “is that a dementor”
oh man this one turned out long! that's what I get for saying my Drarry's were too short. to be fair this is very firmly pre-relationship. So canonical Major Character death here and a lot of playing fast and loose with canon elements. hope you like!
Harry was stunned. He had never given much thought to where dementors “came from” before and he wasn't sure he wanted to know.
Harry suppressed a smile thinking about Malfoy’s face when he had asked him if he wanted to grab a couple of drinks after work. The way his eyes had widened and his brows had furrowed before he shook his head and agreed.
“If your saying that Draco just encountered the dead body of Severus Snape, then yes Potter, that is more than likely a new dementor.” Mr. Malfoy said coldly. Harry scowled at him. It was almost good to know that the man was still an arse.
But Harry didn't have one pet name. Malfoy seemed to cycle through an unending list of things to call Harry, but never stuck with one. He didn't use his sneering voice to spit out Potter anymore but he never seemed to land on one specific endearment for him. Harry loved them all of course. He knew if they were not as close as they were he would be relegated to Potter again but he couldn't help the sting of jealousy when he heard him speak to any of the others.
“We don't need your boy, just the two of you. We saw where his allegiance lay and who’s wand defeated your lord. I don't think for a minute anything he did wrong here was his idea.” he said with a glare towards Malfoy Sr.
Harry was stunned. Everyone knew Lucius Malfoy had escaped Azkaban in the first war by claiming to be under the Imperius. That he would allow his son to claim the same under his own hand to guarantee his safety was completely unexpected from the man Harry thought he was. The older Malfoy he had seen through Voldemort's visions had been a broken shell of a man. Even the man Harry had seen only minutes before, still cowering behind his lord, seemed ages away from the desperate father in front of him. That Mrs. Malfoy loved her son was obvious from the first, but he had never realized that Mr. Malfoy might love him as well.
“Yeah” Harry breathed “ fuck yeah, i do”
The Boat House.
“I forget you're so young sometimes. And so unaware of so many things. I’m sure Miss Granger would know already.” he said it was a teasing lilt to his voice but Harry rather thought it was a tad insulting. He could feel his ears heating up in embarrassment.
Ron had argued the first time Malfoy had had a screaming fit in the middle of the night after waking up wrapped tightly in his quilts, that he was faking it for attention. Seamus and Neville had also looked dubious and though they hadn’t outright agreed with Ron, they also had not moved to help Malfoy, who was still writhing on the floor crying.
When they drew up Harry moved to pull out Malfoys chair, but he had already moved around to the other side of the table and pulled out his own seat. Harry kicked himself for not moving sooner. He took off his jacket casting a subtle look at Malfoy, smiling when he saw the man sweep his gaze over his the way his shirt stretched over his chest and shoulders.
Most of the deatheaters had been stunned watching their lord crumble to ash before them. A few had gotten away, but those not quick enough had been handled easily by the aurors who had shown only seconds too late.
Neville looked furious.
“What is it? Are you still hurt? I went to Pomfrey first but she hadn't seen you. Do you need to see her?”
Before he could think of a loving Malfoy family dynamic, another younger auror stepped into the great hall.
Draco sat with Harry in the living room, reading while Harry dozed on and off. Harry was wearing one of his Christmas jumpers and still wrapped in a heavy blanket.
“Draco! Draco, baby shhh its ok I know, I know. If I could take you away from all of this i would. You know I would. But you wont leave your family anymore than i will. It's why I love you.” Neville told him  while running his hands through white blonde hair.
Neville wasn't sure what he had expected, but Draco snapping out of his thousand yard stare to pin him with a look that looked so lost and confused wasn't it. Him bursting into a fresh round of tears was even more shocking. Without thinking Neville scooted himself across to the blonde and wrapped his arms around him, only mildly surprised to feel long spindly arms wrap around his shoulders in return.
"You bloody well are, and also you're starting to sound like a Weasley there Malfoy. Should Hermione and I rescind pub privileges from you and Ron?"
“Goodbye Harry. Please have my things ready tomorrow. I will not want to speak with you. And since you don't listen to anything i say you shouldn't want to speak with me either.”
Mrs. Malfoy turned away first. Harry had been too busy fidgeting under their looks to notice Draco had slipped out of sight.
Harry frowned.
“Hmm? Oh yes,he comes for tea every other Wednesday with me. Has been for at least 3 months now. Did you not know that Harry dear? He said he had told you.” she looked at him questioningly.
“Oh Neville! I didn't realize you would be here. Um, Malfoy we came to apologize.” she said, but Draco only heard it as if it was far away, still trying to catch his breath.
“I looked for you everywhere I could think of, anywhere I remembered you mention.” he felt Draco’s stomach muscles tighten as he dropped kisses in a perfect line across his abdomen.
Before he could run through the double doors leading into the ward though, one of the medi-wix managed to grab a hold of him and thankfully cast a healer grade disinfecting charm at him. It settled over him with the astringent scent of too clean that always hung around a hospital. Ron scrunched his nose at it and imagined he could hear the squeaky clean.
Harry kept his mouth shut.
Hermione gasped and clutched Ron’s hand to her chest.
Malfoy said something to the bartender but whatever it was Harry couldn't hear it past the roaring in his ears. Malfoy looked incredible and he was heere for Harry. He had dressed up looking like a wet dream Harry didn't even know he had and all Harry could hear was the rushing of his blood as it all gathered in his groin.
He locked eyes with Malfoy and let all his desire show in his eyes as he swept them over the blonde's body. He saw Malfoys breath hitch and watched the pink nipples that had been distracting him all night tighten into points that stabbed against the tight white shirt.
A commotion near the main doors drew the attention of him and a few others. Hermione who had been hovering nearby stepped closer to him.
“He said he hurt Draco and ran away like a coward, had no idea if Draco even lived, he said. I can't protect that.”
The Malfoy’s and their auror guard both turned to look at the crowd they had gathered. Mrs. Malfoy looked shocked for a moment but covered it quickly. Mr Malfoy though, looked at Dean and Luna with regret and grudging admiration, nodding once in acceptance.
Harry opened his eyes and saw the others still in front of him, clutching themselves with their hands over their ears. Mrs. Malfoy was openly crying and leaned heavily into her husband's arms. Kingsley had his hands to his head but his eyes were open, looking soberly at the boat house through squinted eyes.
“I don’t care how anxious they are to come out, there will be no pushing until their sorry excuse of sire arrives!” he screamed.
“No i don't believe we need that just yet.” he said
“My baby.” she whispered, the night so silent around them the soft sound sounded like a shout that Ron felt stitching up the small broken pieces of his heart he had gathered and put into a box the last time he had left the Burrow, apparating heartbroken and sobbing directly into Malfoy’s flat.
He could feel himself getting defensive, but he wouldn't let anyone degrade his family, or his name. And Malfoy was his name now and he was certainly proud to use it. Ron felt Hermione dig her nails into his arm pulling him back towards her. He hadn't even noticed he had moved towards his siblings until she did. He looked over at her wide, pleading eyes and sighed. He knew he needed to at least try, for his mum’s sake if not his own. But there was only so much he was willing to subject his children to.
“You can have more, if you want.” he offered once the apple was nothing more than core.
They sat there until Draco pulled himself back together and stood up. Even after the whole display, Neville had been pleasantly surprised when he reached a hand down to help him up as well. He had smiled nervously down at Draco who looked surprised to be looking up at him instead of down.
“What do you mean what am I doing? I thought we were having a good time and frankly i'm not looking to end the night yet.”
scar worship! with Neville and Draco!  because harry/draco was just too easy with this one. they can make an appearance next time.
another Drarry. also another Pre-slash !
“Do you want me to cast a patronus to get rid of it?” Harry blurted out suddenly, startling the man slightly. He sighed.
Ron wanted to laugh but all he could do was stare at her wondering again if it was the right thing to do. As much as he loved his mum and dad, Draco and the boys and the baby came first.
He wondered, not for the first time how things would have gone had he shaken Malfoy's hand all those years ago.
What kind of idiot used an unknown spell on another student? Neville loved Harry but sometimes he couldn't help but agree with Draco that the boy was truly an idiot with nothing but luck to get him by.
And he was properly affectionate.
“Sorry, sorry.” he blew softly against the skin to ease the sting, watching the cut stitch itself together.
When he was free Dean moved them onto the floor and Parkinson yanked the pillows and blankets to the floor making them a nest. Dean sat outside the blankets until Malfoy settled into her arms and then he moved away, heading to where Harry and the rest of them stood still watching the scene.
“Oh Harry he had already told me he wouldn't be coming. But how could you not know? About the school? It's so important to him. He said if children could only learn about each other's worlds then the fear and jealousy that fueled him and his family would never have been allowed to happen. He worked so hard on that on top of his job at the ministry. You really had no idea?” asked Mrs Weasley quietly.
“I should go see what they need help with.” he mused.
Draco didn't particularly care. He was over playing a sport he barely liked just to fail at one upping Potter, and it was the greatest amount of precious alone time he had ever gotten in the dorms.
Mrs. Malfoy turned away first. Harry had been too busy fidgeting under their looks to notice Draco had slipped out of sight.
“Please” Mrs. Malfoy asked again, pride all but broken by this point.
The returning slytherins, strangely, seemed to be the most heavily affected.
“Mr. Longbottom, if there is nothing you need from me I have another Gryffindor to hang and quarter.” Professor Snape said in front of him.
“Can’t rightly be the regular git right about now Longbottom, come see me in an hour perhaps i can be a bitch to you about you eating in the lady’s lav.” he said.
And while Harry loved that they had all come so far since the end of the war and were proper friends nowadays, he couldn't help but be a little resentful of the fact that apparently everyone was privy to Malfoy’s affection.
He wore a fitted jean jacket rolled up  on his arms that showed off stark black and white tattoos Harry always wanted to see more of. Only the bottom few buttons were done up leaving only a perfunctory view of a white shirt underneath. His pants were black and stretched obscenely over tight muscled thighs. Malfoy held on to his seekers body long past his own hogwarts days. He had a gleaming silver chain looped around his waist, hanging low to one side, drawing Harry's eyes to the miniscule sliver of pale skin showing above the low riding pants. The chunky black boots he wore added about an inch of height to his already over 6 foot frame. When he stopped in front of Harry, Harry’s eyes were even to his mouth and he wanted to lean up and bite at them. Malfoys blonde hair was hidden under a dark colored beanie and there was a small earring dangling from his ear in the shape of a dagger.
“If your saying that Draco just encountered the dead body of Severus Snape, then yes Potter, that is more than likely a new dementor.” Mr. Malfoy said coldly. Harry scowled at him. It was almost good to know that the man was still an arse.
Ron hesitated. He really hadn't thought about what to do if he wasn't able to see his mum right away.
“Oh I don't have to tell Ginevra a thing. All i have to do is tell the hogwarts board of governors about the sexual harassment i experienced tonight. Those hearings are done behind closed doors and their rulings are not made public unless it directly relates to a student.” Malfoy explained breezily. He sneered at Harry one last time before he turned and apparated away leaving Harry alone in the alley.
Harry wouldn't actually believe that it was over. Voldemort was dead. Most of  his deatheaters were in custody. And it was over.
Harry let out a low laugh.
Ron was frozen in place looking at her. He had no idea what to do. Part of him wanted to run back down the hill and throw himself into the back seat of the rented car and hold his boys to his chest while resting his head on the swell of Draco’s belly. Another part though, wanted nothing but to run to his mum and fall to his knees, lamenting so many lost years. His heart lurched suddenly and Ron realized with a jolt that his boys would only ever know this person in front of him as their grandmother. No amount of stories he had told them over the last 10 years would be able to capture Molly Weasley in all her glory and now it was too late for more than a few days at most.
The sudden silence was almost as painful as the screaming had been. It felt like it had gone on for hours, but Harry knew it had only been seconds.
Maybe it was because he also called Pansy Parkinson love.
So when he had seen the state of the bathroom, Neville had immediately panicked. Has someone seen them? Caught on that Draco regretted being marked and was as desperate to get out as he was to complete his mission from the Dark Lord? He had no idea, and his desperate search of most of his boyfriends regular haunts didn't turn anything up. He had been a mess by the time he trudged into his dorm and flopped onto his bed, only to shoot up minutes later at Harry’s admission of hexing Draco with an unknown spell.
“You said ‘dat’ on purpose.”
“Well, yes?” Harry ventured “I like you Malfoy, and I'm pretty sure you like me. I thought you knew i was asking you on a date tonight when i asked you out.”
He could see Draco’s outline becoming clearer in the light from the house. His frame deceptively slim with the glamor over him. Next to him Blaise looked bigger, but misshapen. Ron didn't see his anyone else and realized with a start what Blaise meant. Hermione must have noticed as well.
A little angsty Dreville fic for everyone to enjoy hopefully!
Then Narcissa Malfoy showed up to the train station over Easter hols, calling Malfoy Baby, and Sweetness, and Precious, and My Littlest Love while running her hands over his face and his hair, clutching him to her chest and wrapping her arms around him, pressing kisses to his cheeks and forehead and everything made sense.
“If that was true” Harry spat coldly “then i’d never even have gotten together with you given how much they dont even like you after everything you did to them.”
“Scorpius Hyperion Malfoy -”
"Your blanket is on my toes" Draco told him. He wiggled them against Harry's side for emphasis.
(See the end of the chapter for
The sudden silence was almost as painful as the screaming had been. It felt like it had gone on for hours, but Harry knew it had only been seconds.
“What?”
“Were you ever going to let me know that I had another parent? Or that Albus had another grandfather?”
“Well you should! This kind of violence was just uncalled for. What if you get brain damage from this and had a concussion and die from haemorrhage and–“
One night, a couple months into the start of the year, Harry found himself restlessly pacing on top of the Astronomy Tower sometime just past midnight. He was tired yet his mind would not stop turning, the hum and thrum of battle would not quiet in his ears and his legs would not stop twitching, as if begging him to run. There, as he paced the floor like a caged tiger, the door creaked open and Pansy Parkinson came into view. Parkinson had largely slipped from his mind even though he knew that she was back at Hogwarts. Now, properly seeing her for the first time after many months, she looked as different as could be to the girl who used to antagonise them. In a way she was like many other Hogwarts students, older, weary and drained. But, when her eyes met his, he could see a familiar rage, as if the end of the War had done nothing to sweeten his image in her eyes. The old hostility felt oddly comforting and he waited for a familiar insult to come. Yet that never came.
“It’s a terrible idea.”
In the middle of the night, Harry once again found her crying in the nursery-to-be. The next morning, Ginny looked at him in the eyes and said, “We can try again”, more like to convince herself. Harry nodded and she finally let out a relieved smile.
Years later, he would track down the twin of
“I don't know what it is that James told you about them, but these, urgh, 'memories' that he gave me, are all bunch of bollocks! Clearly it was just another pathetic trick by Malfoy to get at me, I can't believe that he still aims to do that after his death, the bastard! You know how much rivalry was involved with us back in Hog-”
Which meant, there was a very high chance that Draco would soon meet his end. And call it morbid curiosity, but he wanted to know how his demise would come to be. The suspense of waiting back at Grimmauld’s Place was killing him anyway, so he might as well made the most of the time left. And so, when Mother was momentarily distracted by all the coming and going Order members, Draco sneaked away and Flooed to the Hogwarts Headmaster’s Office. The first voice he heard when he emerged on the other side, funnily enough, was Pansy, apparently yelling at their old Head of House, demanding access to his Floo network to talk to him. Pansy’s voice was cut off mid-sentence as the two of them watched him stumbling out of the fireplace with a sheepish face.
“Well, that's a very interesting story. You see, your mother and I were very much in love. Because we loved each other so much, one day mum was gifted with you. You stayed in mum's warm belly and nine months later a little James was born out of love.”
They managed to destroy the Diadem, but was not fast enough to save Vincent and Greg. Then, as they headed towards the Castle entrance, passing by Nagini’s dead remains, Voldermort’s voice booming in their ears, Draco saw the look on Harry’s face.
“Lucius, Draco is still here.”
, is his grandmother.”
“What is it, James?”
Then, on a summer night shortly after Draco’s fourth birthday, Father and Mother set him down on the stiff lounge in Father’s study and told him a secret. This was the first thing that Father’s said: “You are meant to die for Harry Potter.”
Months passed with little news. Every now and then, he would catch the tail-end of someone’s conversations, or would get a bit of gossips between Mother and Aunt Andromeda, or would stumble across someone’s Firecall. From this, he could vaguely sketch out the Trio’s adventures, their trip to Godric’s Hollows, their capture to the Manor, their heist at Gringotts. From the increasingly excited chatters of the Order, he knew that something big was about to take place at Hogwarts, that perhaps it was the showdown for the Fate of the Magic world. If nothing else, he knew that Harry was meant to face the Dark Lord there.
Draco.
He never did anything to encourage the rumours about himself, but he also never dissuaded any tales that were being weaved about him. Being called the Ice Prince of Slytherin did have its advantages at times, especially when he wanted to claim a sunnily lit spot in the Library or to get some quiet time on his broom. Most of the time though, he minded his own business and kept away from interhouse rivalries. He was careful never to start anything, not out of a sense of righteousness, but more because he felt it too ironic to antagonise Potter and his crew. Yet, it soon became apparent to him that if you were called the Prince of Slytherin and you were seen in the midst of a group of Slytherins trading hexes with Gryffindors, people naturally came to the conclusion that you were the head instigator of the fight, regardless of the fact that you only casted spells to shield yourself. It also did not help that the Golden Trio seemed to despise your very being, when all you had ever really done to them were a couple of childish insults way back before they even set foot in Hogwarts.
Only then did Ginny finally break. She let out a small gasp, as if letting go of her final anchor, as she hugged her body with her own arms and let out a loud cry like a wounded child. She had completely forgotten her husband sitting in the next seat until calloused palms stroked her hair and her tears soaked through the cloak on his chest. Ginny had tucked her head into the crook of his neck and sobbed into his shirt without knowing, all the while Harry himself was crying into her hair, unrestrained.
“Absolutely terrible.”
“Harry?”
Malfoy who had tormented Harry and his friends for years in Hogwarts. Malfoy who had wanted to kill Dumbledore. Malfoy who had led Death Eaters into Hogwarts. Malfoy who had lived with the Dark Lord for the entire summer. Malfoy who looked like a kicked puppy when attending his own trial. Malfoy who had lost both parents to The Kiss. Malfoy who had been pining after Harry for Merlin knows how long. Malfoy who had clawed at Harry's back the first night they were together. Malfoy who did not object to the secrecy of their affair. Malfoy who had a small baby laying in an uterus he was not supposed to have. Malfoy who did not deserve a child of his own, the insufferable bastard he was. Malfoy who was carrying their child; not Harry and Malfoy's, but Harry and Ginny's.
“Right, and where in the world would we find a man who is willing to have a baby with me yet will never talk about it?”
What inside was an old nursery. Soft toys on shelves and in opened trunks. Charmed magical animals running on colourfully painted walls. Soft blue carpet underneath his feet. A wide window looking out to the Manor grounds, facing a small lake and the forest afar. A cupboard full of baby things, clothing and napkins and potions. A few books on an old rocking chair. A cot in the middle of the room, green and white and looking untouched.
“You know the Potions Master Head of the Forensic Department? Tall, platinum blond, I think his name is Malfoy?”
“Isn't that because
“Completely incomprehensible.”
They never told anyone about the truth of James' birth, not even to the Weasley family. The media had no trouble believing Ginny's made-up story, how she was under Healer's order to stay inside all through her pregnancy due to poor health, how she went into labour in late December and gave birth to a beautiful baby boy. The Weasleys, satisfied with the idea of a secret surrogacy, were understanding of tight-lipped the couple were, given the many failures that preceeded. As far as they were aware, James Sirius Potter was the son of Harry and Ginny Potter.
And Harry nodded, yes he did know. He had been the father of someone related to Malfoy for twenty-two years.
James' wedding was on a beautiful April Sunday, in the homey Weasley backyard. The new bride's family was extremely scandalised when the couple first announced the wedding location. The Warringtons were just about to denounce the wedding when the bride herself, black-haired Diane with her Veela-like smile, blackmailed her own family into acquiescence. Needless to say, she became an instant favourite among the Weasleys despite her being an obvious Slytherin. On the wedding day itself, the girl shocked both families by wearing red and green streaks in her hair, looking audaciously contrasting to her traditional pure white dress. The red streaks would hiss like a snake now and then, while the green ones bounded themselves into a braid that roared on the hour. After the hiss and the roar accidentally sounded off in the middle of the vow and successfully stunned the entire audience for several seconds, James and Diane burst into uncontrollable laughter that was soon joined by the rest of the guests, saving the bride's flushing parents who glared at Harry for long minutes as if he was the one corrupting their daughter. Harry honestly could not care less and vowed solemnly at the reception that 17
“I can’t believe you didn’t just hex him right back! How could you just let him, Draco?”, Pansy shrieked as she poked at the lump on his head.
“But all of this... You've done some research on this beforehand, haven't you?”
Malfoys have always been patrons of the arts. Father was partial to the intricacies of porcelains and enamel of both Eastern and European origins, having recently added the Royal Danish Faberge to the family private collection, while mother adored paintings of Greek and Arthurian myths, like those of Rubens and Waterhouse. Losing themselves in the sophisticated details of a miniaturised sculpture, or elaborate engravings, or precise paint strokes was their way of escaping reality. From a young age, Draco had been encouraged to appreciate the classic arts.
, one with 'how could you accept something from a no-good Death Eater scumbag?' and another 'how could you accept the vaults of the prestigious Malfoy without telling us?'. None of the Howlers, however, was remotely comparable to the furious Harry Potter stomping through their Floo. Their father was enraged, loudly voicing his opinions on their sudden decision. He sounded much betrayed when he questioned them, was it not worth discussing with their families beforehand and preventing everyone of a heart attack in the form of a
The moment the front door opened and Harry came face to face with James, he knew that there was something terribly wrong. James, with his golden hair and intense green eyes, stared at his father's face with an almost suffocating concentration, as if he was interrogating him with his gaze. For once, Harry could not recognise the emotions swirling in his son's eyes. James' feelings had always been easy to read, at least to his father. It was always a decent mixture of adoration, respect and sympathy. The occasional rows they had mostly in his younger days were always coupled with an incredibly short-lived anger, which was shocking, considering the fierce and stubborn nature that was identical in both father and son. Harry, having not witnessed such anger in a long time, was all the more suprised when he saw such fury in his son's eyes. It made him feel like there was a hole being drilled at his skull, all the while give him a nagging reminder somewhere in his head as he tried to recall the familiarity in those eyes.
Weeks after that, when the fervour of the crowd had died down and people no longer swarmed the cemetery wanting a last look at the hero, an old woman came to visit. She had bulbs of lilies and narcissus with her, which she planted around the grave with care.
“Yes James?”
For one moment, Harry felt like laughing.
A long silence ensued. The Malfoys turned to stare at him, their mouths hanging as if cut off mid-motion, their face full of disbelief. Was this just a terrible joke, Harry furiously thought to himself. Then Narcissa turned back to her husband and whispered, tears heavy in her eyes:
They started to see a private Healer who had been sworn to secrecy. Malfoy started taking fertility potions and Harry started to make a habit of fucking him in the parchment-packed Archives room where no one ever frequented in addition to their usual evening rendezvouses. Never once did Malfoy asked after Harry's intention to Ginny or questioned Harry's want for a child. It was as if he knew.
When he was five, he saw a Van Gogh painting for the first time.
“And what is this so-called evidence you're talking of?” Harry, amused by the little play between the young parents, decided that it was his time to join in.
When Harry walked into the small room, Malfoy was sitting on the narrow bed, his back propped up against a couple of pillows and his arms heavy with a small squirming bundle. At the sound of the door, Malfoy looked up from the bundle and rested his eyes on him, granting him a tired smile. His smile widened as Harry walked approached the bed and sat down a nearby chair, all the while gazing in fascination at the baby boy whose undivided attention was still on Malfoy. The blond man slowly propped the baby upright, and Harry gasped at the mop of dark hair and shiny green eyes staring at him curiously. Unable to restrain himself, Harry raised out a hand towards his new son, tentatively touching his soft cheek as if the child was going to break. The baby did not flinch at the touch, he seemed almost relaxed like he knew who the man was. Just then, Harry broke into a wide grin, the happiest he had looked ever since they first got together, and Malfoy gave a soft sigh, letting his head drop back to the pillow and smiling lazily at the father and child.
“Yes.”
“… Daddy?”
Harry opened the door to the Forensic Department and came to a still.
than just announcing his son’s eventual demise. His ramble was long and convoluted and regularly interrupted as he tried to hide the pained expression on his face, or when Mother eventually succumbed to her tears; plus, Draco was too young at the time to remember every exact words. But years later, after he had trimmed down all of the simple analogies used for the benefit of a four-year old, it came down to something like this:
James did not tell him when he was hexed with an Unforgivable during one of his stake-outs and had to stay in St. Mungo's for nearly a month.
Five years went by in a blur.
When the healer came into the room with the test result in his hand, his face unreadable, they could not help but hold their breath.
Despite all the hoohas about their soul bond, in reality it was much less dramatic than it sounded. The bond did not really affect his life in general, if one just ignored the Sword of Damocles hanging over his head.
The events that followed were exactly according to plan.
Harry thought it was the worst day of his life, far exceeding the days of the Final Battle, when he saw Ginny broke down into tears in the cold and impersonal room of St. Mungo's. The way Ginny kept her back straight as she tried to hold back her sobs yet could not stop her tears made an even more heart-wrenching picture. The way Ginny looked straight at her Healer's sympathetic but professional face as he explained her condition, how untreatable it was even with the combination of magical and Muggle methods, how she would not be able to live pass thirty, how her health would deteriorate at an unpredictable rate. How she would never be able to carry a baby.
, and with Draco’s mind fixated on Greg and Vincent and not on keeping up his Slytherin reputation, he was no longer in the midst of interhouse conflicts and thus had barely been in close proximity to Potter. If his mind was not so occupied, he might have seen the suspicion in Potter’s eyes and taken some sort of precaution. In his defence though, he was not prepared to be cornered in Myrtle’s bathroom and cursed within an inch of his life. He was only trying to coax Myrtle into spying on Greg and Vincent for him with a bit of crocodile’s tears that had always worked so well on Pansy. Potter, who barged in midway through his dramatic sobbing, must have thought that it was Draco who was plotting the demise of Hogwarts and started to throw accusations and curses at him.
Two years later, when James walked out of the hospital room carrying a small bundle in his arm, Harry broke out into a huge grin when he saw the black mop on the baby's tiny head. He cradled the boy in his arms and rocked him carefully, grandfatherly pride obviously sparkled in his eyes.
“Just because you've known him since he was eleven doesn't mean you
“You’re dating him.”
“I’m not that desperate to see you that you have to come all the way here, Draco. You know, I would really prefer to have you back with your mum than running around active combat zone like this.”
And so he did, enthusiastically plunging into his research, reading whatever he could get his hands on on the painting and the man that drew it. He learned of the artist’s name and history, and his many many paintings. Then he started pestering his parents to take him to faraway lands where he could see the paintings in person. He could see that his parents did not quite improve of his taste, that they did not quite understand the appeal. Yet, he knew that they had a hard time saying no to him, and thus that set the course of their subsequent travels. From France to the Netherlands, from one side of the New World to another, they found themselves mingling among jeans-cladded Muggles taking photos of themselves posing with framed paintings, squeezing their way into the crowd as they followed their young son in his mindless quest to find the paintings of his dreams. And found them he find. Some paintings were like an explosion of joy, with broad strokes of bright yellow, orange and green. Others were more muted, peasant, like their subjects, charcoal sketched and haphazardly coloured. Yet some others, his more personal favourites, carried a heavy darkness, as if being patronised by a tormented soul.
“Would I have ever been able to, Pansy? Would I?”
There was no more Friday dinner invitations. His owls were never replied no matter how many letters he wrote to his son. Only Diane sent back curt replies when it was something urgent, while Albus answered him in his careless childish manner that was poor substitution to his son. Godric's Hollow was blocked from Malfoy Manor's Floo network and the only attempt Harry made to come visit via The Burrow's Floo, the Manor's ward howled like a siren at the intrusion and James only nearly missed hexing his father as Harry hastily retreated.
"No, Harry, we cannot go through a normal male surrogate for this!"
With that, she abruptly stood up and walked briskly to the door as if could no longer bear to be in the same room with him. Lucius, the least composed that he had ever seen him, ran a hand down his face. “Perhaps it’s best that you hear from Dumbledore, Mr Potter,” he said with a heavy sigh, then excused himself and followed his wife to the door, leaving him confused and angry on the couch.
“Are you sure that there is no other way?”
“Maybe I’m not the one who's going to regret his decision”, he said, done with keeping up the charade and suddenly feeling so tired, “Seriously, I only want to help. What have you got yourselves into?”
For a long moment, Harry thought that he had died. Then he heard a voice saying,
, Harry agreed with a smile. His fingers traced the hawthorn wand hidden in the crevice of the couch.
Harry went back to Hogwarts for 8th year and found the student body missing half of its familiar faces, but no absence was more obvious to him than a green tie and a pair of grey eyes. The House of Slytherin had always had fewer students than others, but now the small group was even more shrunken and more heavily shunned by the rest of the student body. Despite that, everything else seemed to be almost normal. Schoolwork was still a bitch and everyone groaned about upcoming exams, as if the War was just a long distant memory. It was the same for Harry, who floated through the days with only thoughts of the NEWTs on his mind, wanting nothing more than to finish the school year and go on with his life. He did however find that his Potions skill had miraculously improved, which helped him sail through exams and propelled him into Auror training without a hitch. He also developed a taste for Blood Quills, which had Ron scrunching up his nose in disgust.
Then, he flinched again and felt as if someone was ripping his heart out when he saw tears trickling down James' angled face. His son was crying.
So, against the rage of the families and the inferno in his father's eyes, James signed the papers and moved into the Malfoy Manor in December. It was two days before the death anniversary of Draco Malfoy.
Harry stopped for longer to stare at the colourful toys, this time with a smile on his lips.
Since the start of the year, Draco had known that there was something up with Greg and Vincent. Granted, they had never been close friends despite sharing a dorm room with them and having them following him around the school for all previous years. Perhaps he should have made an effort to know them better, but with an I-will-sooner-or-later-sacrifice-my-life-for-a-speccy-git mentality, he did not really care to make nice with those without the stubborness to steamroll him over like Pansy. Still, that did not mean he was unaware of them sneaking out of the dorm at odd hours and their anxious whisperings to each other when he was not looking. At the beginning, Draco supposed it really was no business of his, what ridiculous scheme Greg and Vincent had got themselves into. But then, he walked into the bathroom one day just as Vincent was stepping out and saw through the blanket of dissipating steam the blackened outline of the Dark Mark on Vincent’s arm. Greg and Vincent might not know it, but their business was now very much his as well, in the sense that our-bondmate-and-master-are-gonna-duke-it-out-at-some-point-and-I-will-most-likely-be-collateral-damage.
Then, the Trio discovered a destroyed Horcrux and began plans to seek out the rest, all of which Harry truthfully whispered to him late at night as they folded into the ratty couch in the living room, a thin blanket draped over their cooling perspiring bodies. For a hot second when he found out about the plan, Draco thought about joining them. He and Granger had built a tentative sort of truce over their shared interests in reading materials, and he and Weasley could even play a game of chess together as long as neither of them looked at each other. He knew that they, not knowing that he must be kept hidden, would reluctantly let him come along, and if nothing else they could make good use of his knowledge of Dark Magic and his connections with other Pureblood families for their cause. Selfishly, that meant he could also be by Harry’s side. From the hopeful tone in Harry’s voice, he knew that Harry also wished for him to join them.
Which was why it was such a shock to see Lucius and Narcissa Malfoy on the other side of the door on a Sunday morning. Both of them were in expensive robes, their coffers obviously untouched by the war, and they looked as if they wanted to be anywhere but here. The words when they spoke, however, were sincere.
The only thought that came into mind when he first saw the boy in real life was a quiet
“Yes Scorp?”
“Hey, I'm not, pipsqueak!”
“What are you talking about? Is Draco not staying with you?”
“Sorry to cut in again Harry, but I do know the details of your conversation.”
“Well, this should solve your problem, Miss Parkinson.”
"Where else would I be?”
“...Actually, why don't you just come through? It'll be easier.”
“I do not appreciate my son being close to a liar.”
“Like he was overwhelmed when he saw me. You know, like seeing the person you've always wanted to meet?”
Sometimes, he wondered whether his not-relationship with Potter was a by-product of the bond. A Stockholm’s Syndrome sort of situation, in which the life of one party was under the (subconscious) control to another without said party’s consent. Why else would Draco agree to this pointless secret affair with him? Potter was an idiot who took unnecessary risks, a hot-headed fool that got provoked into the dumbest things, not to mention the whole nemesis-of-the-Dark-Lord thing. But, he was also unbearably kind, and his jokes were surprisingly witty, and he always brought Draco those Blood Quills that he liked so much. "You’re like a vampire", he would say with his nose wrinkled up as he watched Draco enthusiastically demolish the Quills with gusto, yet at their next rendezvous he would still find a Quill hidden in one of Potter’s pockets.
For the first few years of Draco’s life, he had a relatively normal childhood, or as normal as it could be for an only child of a wealthy Pureblood family. He was doted on and spoiled and lacked for nothing. He had plenty of toys and plenty of hugs and got his first Blood Quill when he conjured one up from a book illustration as his first manifestation of magic. He chased the family peafowls in the garden and hid his crumb-dotted hands behind his back when he got lectured by his elf nanny. Father let him climb on his lap to peer at his parchments even when he was busy working, Mother let him interrupt her conversation with visiting friends just so he could show her his clumsy stick-like drawings. Most importantly, both of them always kissed his forehead and wished him good night before bed.
That night, when they were finally back home and cuddling up in bed, Ginny told her husband that she wanted him him to have a child. At Harry's shocked expression, she looked up into his darkened eyes, mustered the rest of her courage and repeated the words in all seriousness. She knew how much Harry loved children and was looking forward to having their own when they got married. She had seen how Harry cheered up when they visited Teddy and the Weasley kids. She had seen how Harry sometimes stared at the window of a toy store in a daze, as if pondering at a gift for his own child. Ginny had seen all of that and she wanted the same. Both of them desired a child and they both deserved it. It would be impossible to have a biological child from both of them, seeing that Ginny's eggs were all degenerated before the illness was discovered. Thus, she reasoned, Harry would just have to have a child with someone else.
On the night after Malfoy's first Healer's appointment, Harry called Ginny right away after he was sure Malfoy was asleep. Ginny had sounded so full of life when she lapped up details of the baby, how long ago it was conceived, how big it was then, the estimated due date, if it was all healthy, if Harry brought back a scan photo for her. For a moment, Harry forgot that he was standing in the hallway of the Malfoy Manor and was instead cuddling up to his wife on their bed, discussing happily after
, Draco thought as he ducked behind a column, away from one of Potter’s hexes.
The first time Draco kissed Potter was after the final Quiddich match of Fifth Year. They did not talk about it.
, he thought to himself. Then,
“We speculate that by the time Albus was brought to shore, Mr. Malfoy was already exhausted from the current strength and the cold water. Apparently there was a fallen log travelling downstream aiming at his direction, but we don't think he was in any mind to pay attention to it. According to witnesses, it hit him at the back of his head right after the child was out of the water. It is likely that the impact killed him immediately.”
“Daddy, is that where you got my middle name?”
“… Yes, he is. But Albus, you've already met him once when he was still alive. Remember that time when you fell into a river and almost drowned?”
“Please, this might be the last time that I can say it, I just want to tell you–“
“Really, Pansy, what are the odds that that I would sit still and wait?”
“None of your business, Malfoy.”
“But Daddy, I want to hear Grandpa's story of the Chamber of Secrets!”, Albus pouted and snuggled up to Harry, confident that his childish act would gain him what he wanted. James, like Harry, was hardly a strict parent and had always yielded easily.
At one point, James' difficult face on the sofa morphed into Malfoy's, who used to sit on the very same sofa decades ago. The blond hair, the posture, the furrowed eyebrows were suddenly all so familiar. Somehow, the clock chiming pulled Harry out of the memory like a Portkey and he blinked, not sure if James had said anything during his daydream. By the look of the stiff posture, that seemed not to be the case. Still, the atmosphere was wearing Harry down, and since his son did not seem to plan to talk any time soon, he finally spoke, the sound seemed to break the fragile glass case surrounding them both.
James' voice was surprisingly normal and unlike his eyes, did nothing to betray his feelings. His welcoming Harry into the Manor was warm as always, same were his greetings and small talks as they walked down the corridor to the sitting room.
The moment Harry saw Ginny's beaming face at the little baby, the last thread of guilt in his heart melted away. He looked fondly at the sight of Ginny, with radiant smile and gentle hands, cooed at the dark-haired child in the crook of her arms. Ginny, who sent him a smile full of gratitude when he handed her the boy for the first time. Ginny, whose nightingale-like voice whispered the name of their newborn with such love it made one's heart ache. Ginny, with footsteps light as feathers, walked to the bassinet and tucked the baby in tenderly. Ginny, whose entire being yearned and ached to be a mother.
Diane looked at the panicked face of her father-in-law floating in the green flames with blank eyes. “No, he's not back yet.”
He got a punch to his nose for his trouble.
“The Malfoy house elves were quite willing to talk too, what's with them being bound to the Malfoy lineage and cannot lie to the mansion's master. It probably helped as well that they recognised me as father's heir the moment we returned to the ancestral house. And we both know that those Pensieve memories were not altered.”
Somehow it slipped both of their minds to inform their families about the inheritance. Unsurprisingly, both were subjected to Howlers first thing in the morning from their respective families on the day the announcement was made on the
April.
“... All right, Dad.”
“Wow, cool! So my secret grandpa actually saved me?”
“Damn it, Ginny!”
“You don’t even regret it, do you?”
“Let's have a baby.”
“Regardless of what you claim to believe, it does not mean any of us should forgive him for all his wrongdoing, you know that.”
"Yes, Harry, I do remember that you had a talk with James.”
“That's not fair! How come Al got to meet him and I didn't? I wanna meet my secret grandpa too!”
article so early in the morning? Harry as good as destroyed half of their sitting room with his wild magic before barely calming down in the presence of a frightened Albus. James was not surprised by his father's reaction, but was mildly concerned by its extend: it was more extreme than anything he had ever seen, one that could not be explained by school rivalry alone. He knew that his father was horribly displeased with his decision and it would be so much easier to follow his will. However, strangely enough, James wanted the inheritance, not for its many gold vaults nor endless estates nor invaluable heirlooms, but just pure want, like a child wishing for his first cycling lesson. Somewhere deep in his mind told him that he deserved it, for what reasons he could not tell.
The rest of his last year went by without further drama but for this one odd incident.
say that about him! And I know who Malfoy was, dad. I know what he did in school, how his family's belief led him to prejudice against you and our family. I know how he could not kill Dumbledore in the end. I know that he despised Voldermort and being his slave, but had no choice if he wanted to save his parents. I know how much he desired you, but never acted on it because he knew you were deeply committed to mother.”
“I know, Pansy.”
The rest of the afternoon was spent in the strangest of fashion. Malfoy, still in his unusually quiet whisper, talked James through his work as he went about testing suspects' samples and trace of curses. Sometimes, he would stop in the middle of his sentence and look up at the child with what seemed to be pure shock, as if he had forgotten about James' presence, his hands would tremble and reach out halfway towards the boy like he wished to touch him, but the hands always dropped midway. James, oblivious to all this, appeared to hang on the man's words like prophecies, nodding enthusiastically at times despite his lack of knowledge on the subject. By the end of the day, James appeared to have soaked up the Potions vault of knowledge of his lifetime. Harry took it as a good excuse to leave, he scooped up the boy in his arms, nodded to Malfoy and made a beeline towards the door. He did not hear Malfoy saying goodbye.
.” Potter spits out, irritated. “The war is over. What’s the point of winning if we’re just going to keep fighting?”
“Mother just sent it to me from Paris. She got you something, too.” He tosses the box to Harry, and he catches it easily.
“What?” Draco blinks, lowering his wand.
“Great-aunt Walburga? She wasn’t too bad. Got quite a temper, though.”
“King Arthur’s castle.”
When Draco scrambles to pull his left sleeve back down it’s already too late. Potter’s staring at his left forearm, at the remnant of the Dark Mark now covered in long, thin scars.
Staring at the portrait, Harry feels a sense of déjà vu surging through him. It’s as if he’s been in a very similar situation before, but when, exactly?
“That wasn’t your fault.” He manages to say, his throat tight.
“Let me guess, you’ve never stepped foot in here before.”
“I was thinking about going to Hogsmeade. I, uh — need to buy some broom polish.”
Draco rolls his eyes. He doesn’t tell him that it isn’t something that needs making up for.
Potter lets go of his wrist, and moves over to brush a thumb over the longest scar on his forearm, the one that splits the skull in half, tracing it gingerly, leaving a warm tingling sensation that lights up the nerve endings under his skin. At that moment, somewhere beneath those scars, the still raw, open wound finally starts to heal, and his shattered world is made anew.
Draco raises a quizzical eyebrow. Oh, right. Harry hasn’t had the opportunity to tell him that Molly had already owled him back with an enthusiastic welcome.
“Nothing. Staying here.” Draco takes a bite of his apple. “Not like I can go to France right now.”
Alright, so Potter might not be that big of an idiot after all.
Harry doesn’t realize that he’s staring until Draco coughs lightly, a suspicious blush on his cheeks. He quickly backs up a bit to let the other boy close his door, and they walk down the narrow spiral staircase side by side.
When he gathers up his belongings and bids Merlin goodnight, Draco’s still a little dazed from the rather incredible discoveries he’s made over the course of their long conversation. He’s not even sure which one he finds the most shocking, whether it’s history’s drastic alteration and fabrication of Merlin’s story, his firm belief in his destiny to serve Arthur, or the fact that he essentially recreated a piece of Camelot for himself with this room. What Draco is absolutely certain about though, is something Merlin didn’t have to spell out for him. Slytherins simply do not risk their lives for just anyone. To Merlin, Arthur must’ve been his everything and more.
. It’s built into the Room’s structure, so it’s on a much larger scale in terms of complexity and durability, and powerful enough to — withstand a Fiendfyre.”
“Fine, he might’ve been a git at first, I’ll admit.”
“So now they will.”
“Tell you what?”
“Thank Merlin,” Draco deadpans.
“I was an accomplice, Potter. Nothing can ever change that.”
“I was never Arthur’s court sorcerer. There was no such thing.”
The mention of Granger pulls Draco back into reality. They’re reaching the end of the hall now, the warm glow of the lamps hanging by the portrait entrance comes into view, and his heart sinks involuntarily at the thought of their first proper conversation ending before it’s even started. An unusually impulsive idea occurs to him then, and he gives himself no time to hesitate before blurting it out.
Draco can’t help thinking that they might have some things in common, after all.
Speak of the devil.
“I’m what?!”
“Bloody hell, Potter!”
“Hang out?” Draco sputters.
Draco’s already walking toward the door when his foggy brain recalls that Potter might still be outside. He doesn’t get the opportunity to ponder over his options, because as soon as he opens the door, he finds Potter sitting on the floor with his back against the wall. The other boy startles at the sound of the door and jumps to his feet, but soon drops his defense at the sight of him.
Their gaze lock for an agonizing moment before Draco breaks away abruptly, turning to open the door that leads to the Black family library.
?” Pansy eyes him with suspicion, though she seems hesitant to determine whether he's lying. “So you’re friends, then.”
“But I doubt she has to tamper with her radio to listen to those, so where did you learn to do this?”
Yet it is, somehow. Across from him, Potter’s hair is still a hopeless mess. A few unruly strands fall on his forehead, casting a shadow over the famous scar. They’re sitting ridiculously close to each other, their knees almost touching, and the heat radiating off of Potter’s body is just about the realest thing Draco has ever felt. On the radio, the man’s still singing, desperate yet hopeful, and it sounds like redemption.
The door shudders like a new life has been poured into it. And when Draco reaches his right hand to pull at the handle, the door creaks open.
Curiously, Hermione doesn’t ask where they’re headed, nor does she tell them off for breaking (the not really enforced) curfew, just casts Draco an amused look before closing her book and heading upstairs. Harry wonders what she’s seeing but isn’t telling him.
“I’ll owl them and ask, alright?”
“I’m not a Legilimens, Potter.”
“Yes, in the end.”
Also I can’t figure out Grimmauld Place’s layout for the life of me, so forgive me for being handwavy.
“About Camelot.” The look on the great wizard’s face is the most somber Draco has ever seen. “About Arthur.”
, Draco snorts.
“Here, ” he sighs, pulling off the cork on the vial. “Where is it, let me take a look.”
. Bloody hell, that must’ve been the stupidest thing I’ve ever said in my life.”
“I’d be happy to guide you in fixing it, if you’d like.” The wizard in the portrait says, and Draco’s eyes widen in surprise.
Draco gapes.
himself created the Room of Requirement?”
Archive’s email notification is still being weird, so sorry I’ve not be replying to comments, but I’ve read all of them now. Thank you all for reading and leaving your thoughts!
“That’s not why, you know.”
Merlin’s quiet for a long moment. And when Draco turns to look at the portrait wizard again, he’s staring at him with a frown, as if he’s seeing another person through Draco.
Harry has just finished reading the letter in the living room when he hears Draco calling his name as he practically stomps down the stairs. He turns to find Draco at the bottom of the staircase, holding up a large book titled
“When you stop Potter-ing me in public. New scarf?”
“If we’re going to discuss Potter, I need something stronger than tea.”
“I do, although I had expected it to be severely damaged. That doesn’t seem to be the case anymore.” Draco looks down at his feet, trying to find traces of the fire on the impeccably clean stone floor.
“No, never heard of it. Is it perhaps some old, obscure magic not in use anymore?”
A pause. “I can shake off an Imperius, though.”
Draco feigns a scoff, but takes the bottle from him, drinks, savoring the pleasant burn as the alcohol hits the back of his throat, and listens to the song anyway. The lead singer’s voice is raspy but gentle, strangely comforting in the middle of the night. It’s still a rock song, but not so loud and clamorous as some of the other ones he’s heard. It’s not a bad one, he admits to himself with a shrug. He fails to catch any of the lyrics, though, because he soon gets a little distracted by his former nemesis. Potter’s eyes are closed and his head’s leaned back, exposing his slender neck and his Adam’s apple. He’s singing along to the song softly, appearing more relaxed than Draco has ever seen.
He’s standing in what looks like a medieval-style bedchamber. The room is in pristine conditions, decorated in red and gold, brightly lit with floating candles. Walking past the ornate wooden dining table and then through another doorway, a large four-poster bed sits at the center of the room, with gold-embroidered red velvet hanging on the sides. There’s a work desk by the windows, which open toward the lake, and the cold winter air seeping through the seams between the delicate glass panes reminds Draco that this is all very much real. He looks around the room in search of any signs of damage from the fire—burnt down walls, destroyed furniture, anything—yet found absolutely none, as if the place was only furnished yesterday.
“Oh, it is. The room is capable of physical self-repair, but the transfiguration magic is damaged nonetheless.”
“Yeah, they are happy to have us over for Christmas.”
“Potter.” He jumps out of bed and shoves the dark-haired boy still sprawled on top of the covers. “We’re going to be late.”
gaze flickers up at him then, his emerald eyes filled with amazement and something Draco doesn't dare to define. He thinks maybe he's starting to understand what Pansy said that day, and for once, he doesn’t try to stifle the cautious hope bubbling up in his chest.
Draco turns sharply to stare at him, and it takes him a second to realize what for.
“You should take Draco back to the dorms, Harry.” She suggests, grinning mischievously.
Then Draco’s looking closely at the photo, and he begins to realize why he, at least, didn’t notice the photographer. Potter is smiling at him as he hands over a cup of hot chocolate, and as Draco reaches out, their fingers brush for what is definitely longer than necessary. Unlike Potter, his face is not visible in the photo, but he knows for a fact that he was blushing then at the jolt of electricity coursing through his veins, just like he is now at the memory of it.
“I think it’s time for that story I promised.”
He doesn’t ask him how he knows. Instead, he asks, one day as they head down the hall—
, when the rest of his home was submerged in darkness and reeked of the rusty scent of blood. He turns to meet Potter’s gaze. It's
“Hey, I have great taste in music.” Potter elbows him in the ribs jokingly, in a movement so natural that if Draco doesn’t know better, he’d think that they’ve been doing this for ages. He realizes in a daze that two years ago, something like this could launch them into incessant taunts and perhaps even a full-on fight.
“Why not?”
“Would you at least not lie to me if I ask you about it?”
“I don’t need your protection, Potter.”
He takes the leather-bound journal out of his pocket and mutters a
Draco grabs for the cloak with uncanny precision in the dark, and all but rips it off of him in haste. Harry quickly casts a
Potter seems a bit startled at that, but he smiles triumphantly, then starts tugging Draco toward Three Broomsticks.
for a
“Why are you telling me this?” He asks eventually.
Because Potter should never be able to see through him. Because he should never know that even though Draco didn’t
“How many times has this happened, Draco?”
It occurs to Draco then that he may have just found the Gryffindor equivalent of the Chamber of Secrets, and he hopes to Merlin that there’s not a thousand-year-old dragon or lion hidden in here somewhere. He glances down at the journal in his hand. This isn’t exactly what he had in mind when he set out to repair this room.
“And you decorated your room in Gryffindor colors because — ?” He can’t help but ask.
picked these. Inadvertently, anyway. A few years back they had been in Paris on holiday, his mother had caught him staring at these glasses while she was shopping for jewellery. She had cast a curious glance at him, and innocently asked whether he was having problems with his (perfect) eyesight. Draco had shaken his head and quickly stepped away from the display case.
“You do intend to keep on repairing this room, don’t you?” Merlin eyes him quizzically, and the dragon in his hand turns to him too.
So that's how he ends up sitting cross-legged on Harry Potter’s bed at midnight, fiddling with the buttons on his radio, while Potter sits next to him chewing a licorice stick, his feet dangling off the bed.
“I’ve actually never thought about who might’ve created the room. Though I did once think if it might be another Chamber of Secrets, that sort of thing.”
“How did he react?”
Yeah, okay. She’s not exactly wrong.
Draco barks out a laugh as Potter lands on top of him, surprising even himself. The Hufflepuffs a few feet away are openly gawking now, slack-jawed. They start whispering something surreptitiously amongst themselves, but Draco really can’t care less, because he’s too preoccupied with the feeling of hot breath brushing his cheek. Potter is gazing at him, his green eyes sparkling.
“You die at the Manor in mine.” He admits softly in return, surprising even himself. “It doesn’t help to dwell on hypotheticals, Harry.”
In the middle of fiddling with his newly improved radio, Potter looks up and asks.
Thankfully, Potter doesn’t push. “Ron dropped and broke it when I lent it to him.” He pauses, lowering his gaze. “Want to come with? I thought you might like to — hang out.”
But now. Voldemort is gone. Draco, however, is still the mystery he can’t seem to solve.
“Well, Helga was hoping that I’d change my mind and come back someday, so she wanted to keep my residence. I thought that it might as well benefit some students in my absence.”
“I didn't want you to feel that you were alone.”
“People are going to talk, you know.” Draco protests feebly.
He’s suddenly wide awake.
“My mother always did.” He answers evasively. “She secretly enjoys Celestina Warbeck songs.”
“But what’s your portrait doing in Gryffindor’s secret room? I thought you were a Slytherin?” Draco frowns. This is all too bizarre.
“Ah.” Harry nods, a little abashed like he’s sorry he asked.
“Sorry, sorry.” Potter jumps up and offers a hand out to him. The gesture abruptly reminds him of a very different day, when they were surrounded by fire instead of ice. Potter looks like he’s realized it too, and Draco can see the overwhelming uncertainty on his face, like he isn’t sure if he should retract his hand. But before he can decide, Draco takes it. He thinks perhaps he always will.
Still mostly Drarry because the chapter was getting long, but it leads into some important stuff about Merlin next chapter, promise.
Draco hops off the bed and all but runs out the door before he could change his mind. He could only hope that it doesn’t end in utter disaster, although he doubts that it really can at this point. After all, nothing can be worse than almost killing each other, right?
Turning around, he finds Potter standing only a few meters away from him, staring at his feet intently looking torn. Draco soon gets a vague idea of what he’s talking about, but decides to pretend he doesn’t and puts on his usual look of disdain, hoping that the other boy can’t see past it in the dim firelight.
Merlin rolls his eyes, nodding reluctantly. And when Draco barks out a laugh, he’s smiling too.
“How are you always up so late?”
He stands still in the middle of the empty hallway and listens. Soon enough, he picks up on the familiar heavy breathing, coming from maybe only a few feet away from him.
Potter looks serious, and a little —
Another song is coming up now, a melancholic guitar intro filling the room, and it seems like Potter knows and likes it well.
“What?”
threw vegetables at you when you first met?”
Harry doesn’t seem to think that Draco’s lying. If anything, he appears more intrigued now by the mystery.
A few of them gasp in horror, and Draco definitely has a newfound sense of respect for this woman. A few mumbled apologies later, Lovegood dismisses her younger housemates before turning back to Harry.
“He’s using you, Harry!” One of the girls shouts suddenly. “Can’t you see what’s going on? Surely you don’t want to associate yourself with the wrong sort. ”
“I wouldn’t jump to that conclusion so quickly,” Merlin says eventually, pulling at the fraying edges of his tunic absentmindedly.
“Alright.”
“Are you alright, Draco?” Potter reaches out, and Draco instinctively flinches. He looks a little hurt by that, but withdraws his hand in understanding nonetheless.
“What are you doing for Christmas?” Harry asks him one day while they are sauntering over to Potions. He must say, ever since they became friends, Slughorn has been much nicer to him, which makes Potions much more enjoyable, even with Harry’s unsalvageable brewing skills.
I'm so sorry I left this story the way it was, but I never intended on abandoning it. I still have the entire outline, and hopefully I can finish it in the coming weeks.
Draco tries to process the information.
“Do you know why?”
Potter raises an eyebrow at him. “Someone has been staring over breakfast.”
“Now that you’ve mentioned it, I think I might.”
“Alright, the station’s pretty lousy, I’ll admit.” Potter doesn’t seem to notice his little existential crisis though as he keeps talking, “But there aren’t many to choose from.”
“I do not — ”
— he’s almost scared to finish the thought —
“I didn’t know your mum and Andromeda are talking again,” he mumbles sheepishly.
“I reckon that you know the answer to that already.”
They seem to be saying instead.
They walk back together in tense silence, accompanied only by the monotonous taps of their footsteps echoing in the dark and empty hallway. Eventually, Potter follows him through the portrait entrance. And just as he’s heading up the staircase back to his room, he hears Potter blurt out, like it had taken him all this while to muster up the courage—
Glancing down at the parcel in his lap, he could only guess that his mother sent them each some ridiculously expensive, French-made scarves or gloves. He unties the ribbon and lifts the lid off the box, and inside are two separate parcels, one red and one green, with the green one being quite a bit larger. He picks up the green parcel and opens it.
The light in those deep blue eyes dims at Draco’s words, and although Draco’s slightly too buzzed to really think about what he might’ve said wrong, it doesn’t prevent his shock at what Merlin tells him next.
He sits down at the dining table with a cup of tea, and starts digging through the references he brought, looking for spells that might make the sentient magic last longer. The comfortable silence in the room stretches for what seems like forever, before it’s broken by Merlin’s sudden mention of Potter.
“Because — It’s dangerous, alright?” He sighs and mutters a response quietly. The rum burns pleasantly in his stomach and starts to make him feel warm and fuzzy all over.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Uh, I fail to see how reading about dark magic could be good.”
Draco reaches out and touches the cloak, pinching the silky fabric for a brief moment just to scare the boy under it, before letting it slip through his fingers again. He could picture the face underneath, and it almost makes him laugh.
“No, Potter.” He shakes his head. “If I had to guess, it’ll be along the lines of, ‘former Death Eater using the Saviour to salvage his reputation’ that sort of thing. Some might even say I have you under an Imperius.”
“That underground radio station Lee Jordan started — ”
Draco feels his cheeks grow warm at the casual use of his first name. They could be on first-name basis now, he remembers, beyond amazed, because who would’ve thought? Although, he's not entirely certain if he's ready to say it out loud. He sits back down on the edge of Potter’s bed, hands twitching awkwardly, suddenly not knowing what to do. He wonders briefly if Potter might go back to sleep.
“I did.” He doesn't even hesitate. “I do.”
“Uh, great.” Harry’s eyes widen in surprise before he grins widely, and his eyes glimmer behind those new glasses of his — that
.” Pansy sneers. “
“Then I think I would know if I was dating him.” Draco sighs, exasperated. “How many times do I have to tell you not to believe everything in the gossip mill?”
“He said ‘thank you’,” The older Slytherin looks pained at the memory. A sad smile tugs at the corner of his lips and he shuts his eyes, like he’s trying to stop tears from falling. “He told me to never change.”
“I, well, overheard Parkinson talking about it with Zabini. She hinted at it, that you—” Potter swallows hard but holds his gaze, his eyes the softest Draco has ever seen, “I could always hear you leaving in the middle of the night.”
Draco scoffs. “Of course you can.”
“Why, that’s me.” Says the dark-haired young man in the portrait, his blue eyes piercing.
He had meant it as a joke, of course, but Potter huffs in mock annoyance and gets up, kneels beside his bed to reach for something from underneath. Moments later he’s back on his feet, holding up a bottle of Firewhiskey and waving it in front of Draco.
“Harry, Harry!”
“Because I’d rather have you throwing hexes at me in the halls than walking by like a ghost.” He sighs, his eyes fluttering close, “because no one deserves to suffer more than they already do.”
“You need to listen to this.”
“Don’t ask me about it, then.”
“I thought you said, Merlin.”
“You said you won’t lie to me.”
“I was hiding under my cloak, watching you. You pointed your wand at him, and I was so certain that you were going to go through with it. But then you didn’t, and only after a long time did it occur to me how wrong I was about you. It never was your choice to become one of them, just like it was never my choice to become the Chosen One. We both did what we had to do to save those we love, so who was I to claim the moral high ground?” Potter stares intently at the crisscrossing scars over the faded Dark Mark, examining, sadness and regret lingering in those piercing emerald eyes, “I still think about it sometimes, that day in the lavatory, instead of throwing
“He’s still outside, you know.”
“Have a seat, Draco.” Merlin gestures to the dining table.
“Right, and he made that choice seven years ago.”
“So what if I am?” Surprisingly, Potter simply shrugs and takes a sip, before holding out the bottle towards him, grinning. “Are you saying no?”
“Yeah. You know, the thing that friends do?”
“This room doesn’t only look like Camelot. It
“Potter, you cretin! When will you stop doing that?”
“That’s not due for another two weeks.”
themselves? I would think that’d be a household charm or something.”
“Malfoy.” When he opens up the back cover, revealing the components and colorful wires, Potter pokes a finger at him, “You’re not going to break it, right?”
Draco can feel it, the almost scorching body heat radiating from the nothingness in front of him. Maybe half a step more, his own body could be pressed right up against his. Potter’s breathing noticeably picks up pace, and it makes Draco want to reach out to touch.
Before he knows it, he’s reached the end of the corridor and closed his eyes, requiring the room. The familiar humming noise accompanies the door as it emerges, and a feeling of déjà vu washes over Draco as he remembers, two years back, how he would arrive at this door every night with dread weighing on his chest like a rock. He’s never going to admit it out loud, but his decision to fix the room is purely sentimental—He had made all the wrong choices here. He had died and was reborn here. It means too much for him to allow it to be reduced to ashes and forgotten forever.
Draco soon notices that Potter seems to always know when he goes to the Room of Requirement. He’s there every time Draco is, but on the days that Draco stays in, he could always hear through their shared wall Potter’s radio playing Muggle rock music late into the night.
Harry can’t remember the last time he was this excited and intrigued by a mystery.
The young man in the portrait nods, and Draco’s disbelief only deepens as he takes a closer look at him. The man’s sitting in a plain wooden chair, dressed in medieval peasant clothing that all seems quite ragged and worn. His faded blue tunic looks like it’s been washed too many times.
“Potterwatch.” He interrupts softly, and Draco dares not to guess what he might be thinking, “Why?”
“Don’t you think I at least deserve to know after suffering through seven years of your hopeless pining?”
Hesitating for a moment, Draco does as he’s told, and pulls out a chair facing the portrait.
“Oh, that’s brilliant.” Harry is too busy being genuinely delighted to notice Draco’s slightly pained expression. “Please thank your mum for me.”
He sighs. Although, he probably should’ve seen that response coming. Gryffindors.
TW: Implied self-harm
“Wow.”
“Hermione?”
“Yeah. Sirius left it to me.” He nods. “You’ve been there with your mum before?”
Harry wordlessly casts a
way better than what Salazar Slytherin decided to leave behind in the castle.” Harry muses, glancing around. “Though this looks more like Gryffindor Tower than anything remotely Slytherin.”
“That’s unnecessary, Lovegood. It was just a Stinging hex.” Draco frowns.
“What?”
Potter noticeably pauses for a brief moment as if there’s something else he wants to say, but then changes his mind and looks away.
His voice is shaking, and it probably comes across as a little too desperate. Panic rises in his chest, filling up his lungs and making him a little dizzy. There’s a heavy lump in his throat and he swallows hard, barely breathing. It takes all of his courage (if he even has any to begin with) to turn around to look at Potter, bracing himself for everything from disbelief to mockery.
“Of course he is.” Draco scoffs as he turns the page.
Draco had pictured numerous scenarios where this apology would take place, but this surely isn't one of them. The conversations he had drawn up in his head were awkward at best, often forced, and some even hostile and violent, but they were never like this, never
To Draco’s own astonishment, he laughs and takes the bottle.
"Being who we are, we can’t be friends.” Draco leans back in his chair and looks up at the medieval style chandelier, staring intently at the shadows the flickering flames cast on the ceiling as he feels the alcohol kick in slowly, breaching his defenses. “I should’ve known that from the start. But he—he’s like the sun. Not because of the scar, or the legend, just
Harry laughs and plops down on the bench next to him.
“Yeah, that’s exactly — wait, are you saying that that’s all real?”
“Right, a Muggle prince.” He downs the rest of his drink, “And said
“Half, but I see your point.”
Wow, I truly did not expect the response the last update got. Thank you guys so much for reading. I love this story too much to really let it go, and I'm so sorry I left for so long. Regardless if you're old or new, welcome (back?), and I'm so thrilled that you're here.
“And I think both of us can use someone to talk to, don’t you?” Merlin blinks and gives him a kind smile, and the baby dragon made of flames curls up in his hand and starts snoring softly. “Now, time to say goodnight, Mr. Malfoy.”
Harry has to choke back a laugh at Draco's thinly veiled annoyance. Then with a loud pop, Kreacher appears in front of them, looking more delighted than Harry has ever seen him.
“It felt like — ” He pauses. Suddenly he’s back in that moment, to that flash of emerald green when Potter turned back and looked right at him, straight into his soul. His eyes were the same color as the killing curse, but they made Draco feel so
Draco tries not to flinch at the mention of what happened that night, but the concerned look Potter gives him makes him want to retreat.
Harry reaches out for the fresh wound this time, and Draco doesn’t have the heart to stop him. He pours a few drops of Dittany onto his chest and gently rubs it over the wound. Draco would worry if he could hear his heart hammering in his ribcage, if he weren’t so busy greedily soaking up all the attention that he’s been craving for years.
The same cannot be said for Draco’s friends. It seems that Pansy was not the only one who was aware of his seven-year streak of pining. He’s pretty sure that there is a sizable betting pool on the real nature of their relationship happening behind his back.
“Oh, Draco, you’re hardly the most difficult person to read when you’re not putting on an act.”
Draco stiffens, from shock as well as from the absolute dread of remembering that night on the Astronomy Tower, but Potter’s grip on his wrist doesn’t loosen, and the warmth radiating from his palm stills his trembling hand.
and leans back against the wall to wait, assuming that Draco would have to have some sort of discussion with the mysterious portrait. What he did not expect was that Draco would come back outside in literal seconds.
“Are you going back tonight?”
“Any plans today?” Potter asks after a long moment of silence. There’s a nervous edge to his voice, and Draco’s brows furrow at that.
Reliable as always, Hermione’s response arrives just a little before supper time.
“Let’s go?”
There’s a long, swollen red gash, stretching from near his right collarbone down to his sternum. It is a little worse than usual, but not terribly out of the ordinary — the hex did hit him square on the chest.
“There’s — something in there.” He struggles for an explanation that wouldn’t sound too suspicious. As he expected, Harry looks perplexed by the ambiguous answer. He huffs impatiently. “There’s a portrait of the creator of the room. His identity has remained hidden all this time and — I need to ask him before I could tell you more about it, or let you come in.”
“Draco Lucius Malfoy-Potter.”
Already waiting for him at the hospital lobby was a Mediwitch obviously assigned as his personal escort. Harry wordlessly followed the witch to the Paediatrics Department, where Diane was already pacing restlessly in front of a room, her face pale and teary. Upon seeing Harry, she stopped moving altogether and her beautiful face crumbled in fear. She did not stop crying when Harry embraced her soothingly, nor did she when James rushed in half an hour later. In the mean time, the men kept an intense glare at the generic white door as if they could will it to open. After what felt like hours, a plump smiley Healer emerged and announced that the boy was all fine. She assured the family that while the boy was submerged in the cold river for almost five minutes, he was dragged out of danger before any serious damage could happen, that he was soundly sleeping now but would wake up in just a bit if they wanted to see him. The joy they all felt was too raw and overwhelming and each got a little teary all over again. Harry felt immensely relieved when he saw Albus' eyes fluttered open to the bright light of the room. The boy sent an annoyed frown at the Mediwitches cooing at the door while he had his life squeezed out of him by his three protective parents and grandparent. Harry later caught a small smirk on the boy's face and realised that they had all forgotten to scold the boy for being reckless.
“Of course you're not. Anyway, once there was a man who loved grandpa as much as mum loves me. He loved him so much that one day, he was gifted with a small baby. He carried that baby for nine months in his belly, much like how mum used to carry you two-”
Pity that he would not be around to enjoy it.
Harry looked up from his swirling glass of Firewhiskey to the rather blurry blond head and harsh green eyes. He blinked, not sure if it was yet another of those alcohol-induced dreams that he had been having a lot recently. Even he could tell that he was drinking too much lately although he could not seem to stop himself from doing so. Ginny was the one who used to tell him what he ought  and ought not to do, a task James later took up when she was gone. But Ginny was no longer here, and apparently, neither was James. James had not been to Godric's Hollow for months, hell, he had not even talked to him ever since that disastrous evening. It had been James' punishment to him, Harry knew it. They had never gone on one week without talking to each other no matter how trivial the conversation. The lack of James in his life hurt so much, it was a pain that only alcohol seemed to subdue.
“... As I was saying, the baby was in that man's belly, until one day the baby was big enough, then he gave birth to the baby, and that baby was me.”
So that was what James was so upset about all dinner? Honestly, James could be disapproval at the tiniest thing, a trait not inherited from Harry at all. He chuckled. “They are just silly children's tales, James, nothing for you to be alarmed about-”
“Does it hurt that your own son does not acknowledge you?”
“Where have you two been?”, he asked, casually propped up in his bed like he could care less.
Harry laughed out loud and strolled towards the cot, bending down to pick up the awake boy and presented him to the couple. “What, what could be wrong with this sweet child, who is the perfect proof of the harmonious love between you two? See how his wild black hair and little mouth belongs to a Potter, his sharp nose is definitely of a Warrington, not to mention his blue eye-”
That night, Harry found himself in his living room. For the first time, he looked at the items around the room with full awareness. All the things that he had charted to his evolving interests over time. All the habits that he thought he had picked up from others around him. All the little quirks that frequently puzzled his close friends, all of those now had an explanation, one he could not bear to ponder on.
She heard him groaned pitifully into the flame, agitated that the fact that he had not been able to reach his son for the last three days. He was about to pull out of the fireplace before turning back abruptly, as if just recalling something.
An almost relief sound. “Can you tell me where he got these things?”
"Due to the nature of male pregnancy and the fact that conception has to be natural, the male surrogate is always pre-informed of the father's identity, lest they decide not to go through the process. And if our identities are known to them, there is no telling that they will keep it a secret, or that they will not want to keep the baby for any sort of leverage or fame."
But James was here now. He was in the sitting room of Godric's Hollow once again, standing in front of him in the flesh. When James sat down on the couch opposite of him, Harry almost thought that he was finally forgiven, albeit to a crime he did not commit; after all, there was no crime.
They were not wrong.
On the other hand, it made Pansy even more insufferable than ever before.
They kept to themselves in their cluttered assigned rooms for the next few weeks, only venturing out for food, otherwise quiet as mice while keeping their ears out for stray conversations between Order members as they walked the corridor. From this, they learned that that the Dark Lord had fully returned, unsparingly committing crimes on the Muggle populate and terrorising the Magic community at the same time. They heard debates on the conduct of Scrimgeour and his inability to control the rampant Death Eaters. The longer the days dragged on, the grimmer the conversations. Eventually, Draco woke up one morning to find that the Order was sending his Father into Voldermort’s camp as a spy. True to form, Dumbledore’s instruction guaranteed Draco’s safety but never specified his parents’, thus the Orders saw no qualms in putting him in danger. And true danger it would be, for his Father would to explain why he had not been with them since the beginning, or why his ancestral house was locked up and unavailable for the Dark Lord’s use, or why his wife and heir were nowhere to be found. Yet, he would not be able to refuse, not with his family essentially in the Order’s hands. And so, he left, knowing that it might be the last time the three of them would be united.
So he started to follow them around. The two of them tried to be subtle, they really did, but Draco was good at keeping to the shadows. He knew that they were visiting the Room of Requirement an awful lot, but he did not know why. During his spare time, he took to wandering around on the Seventh Floor, conjuring up different versions of the Room and checking for clues as to whether they were the right ones, but not never pinpoint the correct room. He knew that the two of them were receiving a lot of curse-guarded letters that they said were from family (which might as well be true), but Draco could not really find a way to sneak a peek without tripping on the curses. He thought he could try to divide and conquer, knowing that Greg was more of a follower than Vincent, yet his threats and begging remained unsuccessful. Only once did he confront them outright when he caught them stumbling into bed sometime near dawn, their eyes bloodshot from lack of sleep and their faces stormy with frustration.
“It's a new dementor Harry. A baby if you want. Just born.”
He burst through the door, oblivious to the stares of the Healer and other wixen in the room.
Harry sighed and began his walk back up to the castle. He was tired and Draco needed a bed. As he walked he felt the vial in his pocket and wondered what kind of memories a loving godfather left their beloved godson.
With Malfoy.
“What! Do. You. Want. Boy?” Snape snapped out, making Neville flinch and shake even more than he already was. He had run straight to the infirmary when he heard Harry telling Ron what had happened in Myrtle's bathroom inly to find the boy not there.
“If i'm not here next time, give the bloke a hug would you Harry. That's all the git wants from you.”
“There! Over there! Draco!” she called out to Malfoy’s retreating back. If he heard her he made no sign of it. He kept moving slowly, but purposefully onward, his head swiveling back and forth over the ruined terrain.
“I was near frantic by the time I made it near the dungeons wondering how I was going to break in to find you.” Draco was panting by the time Neville’s mouth made it to the end of the garish new scar right above the jut of one prominent hip bone. He sucked on it, feeling the uneven skin with his tongue and nipping at it with his teeth.
“That’s two heads, Draco.” he breathed.
Neville almost laughed at the scared but still prideful look on Malfoy's face.
“oh love, do be quiet.”
Ron debating apparating the few meters back to the car when he heard a shout up ahead and his vision was taken over by a bright silvery light that coalesced  to form two separate forms. A stag and a doe stood before him, bathing him in light. Throwing a quick glance back to the car, he confirmed the light of the Patronus did not reach the car before casting a quick Finite to dispel the glowing forms.
It also led him to his Sunday afternoon habit of migrating from his bed once the outside sun was shining full force across it, to Weasley’s bed, tucked in the perpetual shadows of the far corner. This particular Sunday was not any different, save for the fact that Draco was TIRED.
“Two girls actually. Would you like to see Mr and Mrs Weasley?” he asked ,moving to hand it over.
None  of the Slytherin’s seemed to think any of it was odd or even out of character. It made Harry wonder if this was how Malfoy always was out of view of everyone else, deep in the halls of the Slytherin dungeons. Hermione had said he finally felt free enough to show affection openly now that he was without any of the pressures Malfoy Sr had imposed on him growing up.
Mrs. Malfoy saw him first.
“Dementors are not born exactly. They're more. . . . ..brought into being.” he said.  His eyes were still trained on the boat house, switching between the door and the dementor hovering above it.
“A room?” Malfoy replied tonelessly “a date you said. You think this is a date.”
“I understand Severus showed his disdain for your openly at any opportunity he had despite his overwhelmingly unrequited love for your mother but in Draco’s eyes that acerbic man was everything. So yes, Harry Potter. Draco’s grief and pain over the loss of his godfather bore him a dementor” Mr. Malfoy hissed. He stood unmoving and unblinking until he curled his lip at Harry and turned away from him, dismissing him.
i actually really liked this one and will be posting it as a one shot as well. i worked really hard on it and it was originally intended for this challenge so i figured i'd just do both. thank you!
Harry opened his eyes and saw the others still in front of him, clutching themselves with their hands over their ears. Mrs. Malfoy was openly crying and leaned heavily into her husband's arms. Kingsley had his hands to his head but his eyes were open, looking soberly at the boat house through squinted eyes.
Ron got out of the car and stood looking at the home he had grown up in looming over him. He spent 18 years living in that house. It had been a safe place for him and anyone else his mother had decided to feed. They had planned a way and fought battles in and around the Burrow for 7 years. Looking at it surrounded by the inky blackness of night Ron could feel his heart break just a little when he thought about the last time he had been there. He spared a quick glance at his children, who were both trying to shove their way into the front seat, and his husband. He took strength from the proud smile on Draco’s face and moved towards the Burrow.
short though, sorry!
Harry answered without thinking.  “Snape’s body” he said absently, still staring at what was looking more and more like a-
Harry didn't miss the fact that every once in a while Mafoys eyes would be fixed on his lips or how he didn't move his leg away from where it was pressed against Harrys from Knee to ankle under the table. The more Malfoy drank the looser his posture was. He leaned forward when he spoke and Harry found himself doing the same, drawn forward like a magnet. Drunk Malfoy had a lazy smile and a permanent blush and Harry wanted to see how far down it went.
“I can't carry both of these Malfoy, come help.” it said in Blaise’s lazy drawl that was so like Draco’s only deeper.
“I spent a lot of time with him in between appropriated torture sessions and sneaking us food and blankets. You know how much he talks right?”
“Uncle please stop tormenting the poor man and let him in, I'd actually like to see my boyfriend and assure the bloody Gryffindork Potty did not manage to shuffle me off this mortal coil, no matter how much he tried.”
Draco rolled his eyes. Ron and he had been circling Ottery St Catchpole for hours now and Ron was becoming more and more insufferable as the night wore on. Coming back to Britain had been Ron’s idea. He had been more than happy to live the rest of his life in Seattle but he would never have deprived Ron of reconciliation with his family. He had known they would be coming the moment he had read Hermione’s email.
“Great observation there Draco, what next? You wanna tell me my eyes are green too?”
Draco/Ron with some Mpreg and mentioned male birth. Nothing graphic. This one can be taken as a prequel to the story in chapter 1.
Finally the noise cut off.
Draco paused looking at him carefully.
How had he not seen it? Had Draco noticed it before today? Draco had gone out of his way to not only come by to make sure the elder Weasleys received their gift but had let them know ahead of time that he would not be able to make it. And Harry had called him selfish, Malfoy had never actually even asked him to go with him tonight, Harry had just assumed that's what he wanted. Because that's what Harry had always expected from him. A convenient plus one with added benefits.
“Don't act like Hermione wasn't there with you on that werewolf rights bill. And we all helped with that campaign! Bill was there with you, and so were the rest of the Weasleys.” he yelled back at him, but Malfoy only scoffed at him.
“I'm not going to the Weasleys, Potter. And i'm not going to some gala. I'm going to a fundraising event for the school. The one you don't care about. Tomorrow I'll be back here to pick up anything i have left here. There shouldn't be much.”
A commotion near the main doors drew the attention of him and a few others. Hermione who had been hovering nearby stepped closer to him.
“Nev, you got away from the Carrow’s and the rest of the Death Eaters whenever you went to bed last year right?” Dean paused, waiting for Neville to confirm “well, the Slytherin’s didn’t.” he told him ominously.
“They’re broken aren't they?” Neville whispered.
“It's far enough away that even the muggleborns didn't want to  go but still close enough to be able to apparate to. I never saw anyone I knew there.” he had explained airily one night while they drank butterbeer on top of the astronomy tower
“Ah, I see you’ve gotten the message? Go on then, I'll take care of the class and cover for your next one.”
(See the end of the chapter for
It had been a relief for a split instant before he heard that Harry had no idea how the blonde actually was. Neville had been a nervous wreck after showing up for his rendezvous with Draco only to find their spot in ruins. There had been porcelain and glass all over and the floor had been covered in pink blood. Neville had been frantic calling out for Draco but he was nowhere to be found and even poor Myrtle had been too distraught to tell him anything.
“Tea?” Harry asked. Why would Malfoy be coming for tea?
“Oh, err, I didn't know they could have uh, babies” he said rather awkwardly. He could see Kingsley smile slightly at his obvious discomfort. More a twitch of the corner of his lip really but Harry figured that was all that was allowed at the moment.
Harry got in bed but didn't close his curtains. He watched Dean whisper to Malfoy behind a silencing charm, introducing him to Seamus it seemed, if the handshake was any indication. Malfoy spoke for a minute and Seamus looked angry for a bit then more resigned than anything before shaking his head and waving Malfoy off with a small smile.
Ron started to agree before remembering the entire reason they were so late to begin with. He could still feel the wary glances of their audience and he wasn't ready to let them know more than necessary. Luckily Bill broke in before he could say anything.
As always, she made the decision for him, moving more swiftly than he would have thought she could, down the stairs and across the yard, pulling him into a fierce hug. Ron was over a head taller than she was but he still buried his face into her neck, breathing in the familiar smell of sugar and bread she always seemed to hold. She pulled away after a few minutes but held his face in her hands taking him in.
“Yes, i suppose that’s all you’ll be able to do.”  she turned and nodded to Kingsley and held her hands out to her auror who still had Draco in his arms.
Before he could think of a loving Malfoy family dynamic, another younger auror stepped into the great hall.
“Someone spotted him outside by the lake a few minutes ago” they said.
“Mum will only be upset if he doesn't stay. Him and Malfoy both.”
“Er yeah. Yeah mate I know.”
Malfoy straightened himself up and drew his wand out of his beanie. Harry tensed waiting for him to throw out a hex, but Malfoy only scoffed.
Harry eyed the small dementor still hovering menacingly, now that he was sure what it was. Mr. Malfoy followed behind her, her long stride keeping her ahead. Harry continued to follow at a slower pace, wary of the wraith. He looked over at KingslEy who had a troubled look on his face, his eyes darting up and away from the dementor periodically.
Harry floundered “I-I don't know if i can leave her. I couldn't do that to the Weasleys.”
Harry was looking at Hermione in shock but he could see that she was just as shocked and confused as he was.
Ron smiled with tears in his eyes, reaching for his phone to text Draco, only to realize it wasn't there. Frowning he turned to Hermione.
“Mum.” Ron whispered.
“This was wonderful wasn't it?” said Mr Weasley.
“Actually,” Draco cleared his throat “twins runs in the bearers' side. Ginevra may have twins one day. Your grandmother was a Black Mrs. Weasley. As was mine.”
Draco sighed and let go of the quilt covering him . it fell to his lap revealing long angry red slashes across his chest from left hip to right shoulder.  He gasped and reached a hand out to touch the darkest one laid right across his ribs.
“A dementor is born from the pained scream of a soul. That’s what we heard back there.” Kingsley said motioning behind them. Harry looked back for the first time since leaving through the double doors, he was surprised to see a crowd of people hovering about and watching them. They were too far for Harry, even with his glasses, to see who they were.
“I don't need to ask for directions! I grew up there, of course i know where it is”
Harry wouldn't actually believe that it was over. Voldemort was dead. Most of  his deatheaters were in custody. And it was over.
Ron took her hands in his own and lowered them between them. He looked at her and his dad behind her. They were both frowning,but he could see shame and understanding in both their eyes. He looked around at his sibling and their significant others. He made eye contact with Hermione who had a small encouraging smile on her face.
“Harry, they get together every other week! And on the other week we go see Ron and Hermione! I know you're not coming with me, whatever that's fine but I am going to go.”
“Why not? And what’s that Malfoy was saying? A new dementor?”
Ron knew everyone was looking at them up ahead but he ignored them in favor of watching his son sleep peacefully. He hoped they would be ok after this. Death had not touched them and as much as he wanted to shield them, they deserved at least a memory or two of a grandmother.
“You can't imagine how terrified i was when i saw the state of poor Myrtle’s bathroom when I got there” he told him, following the new scar with his lips down to Draco’s collarbone.
He drained his champagne and stood, holding out a slip of paper to Harry.
Ron looked over at him and noticed the beautiful woman standing next to him for the first time. Percy cleared his throat when he noticed all eyes had turned towards him. The woman rubbed her hand down his back encouragingly.
The cry was loud, and high pitched, and full of so much anguish. Harry felt the grief and hopelessness of it as if it was own. He felt his chest crack open right between his ribs, the pain so real he reached up with hand to rub at the spot.
Finally the noise cut off.
Harry heard Hermione’s relieved breath next to him and was shocked at the relief he felt at those words. He knew Malfoy was a git of the highest order but every time he saw him ever since sixth year there had been nothing but fear and desperation in his eyes. Harry had been more than ready to speak up for him no matter what it took, but hearing Kingsley say that Draco wasn't going to be arrested was a weight of his shoulders he wasn't even aware he had.
“Sweetheart you know she loves you, but maybe show her with more than food sometimes, yes?”
Harry looked at his shoes to get away from the sad and confused stares everyone was giving him. He heard Mrs.Weasley sigh and heard Mr Weasley murmur that she should go ahead and open her last present. He listened to the rustle of the paper coming off and finally looked back up at the inhale of breath he heard. Looking up he saw Mrs. Weasley with a hand covering her mouth, tears in her eyes. Next to her Mr Weasley wasn't much better. All the weasley siblings got up to look at what she had been given.
Instead they were wrapped firmly around  a Weasley.
“Blimey,” came a voice next to where he and Hermione stood. Harry turned and saw Ron, together with most of the Weasleys, Neville, Luna, and Dean.
“About that night I mean. When Ron left. When you left.” he finished looking Ron in the eye.
“He left me.” Harry said miserably “i'm pretty sure he won't be coming back anytime soon”
Neville felt himself scowl.
“Draco come on just come with me and give it to them yourself. It's still early and you can go to your Gala later. Those things go on forever anyways.” Harry said. He may have been mad at him but Harry did enjoy having company when he was at the Weasleys. Everyone had paired off leaving him to be the lonely single when he didn't have a date.
i had planned on making this porny, then it got away from me so i figured i'd save that for next time!
“Draco!” he cried seeing him laid out on the settee in front of him. He rushed over to him, hands reaching out to pull him into a hug. He pulled back slightly when he felt Draco flinch away from him.
Mrs. Malfoy moved away from him, not bothering to wipe at the black tear tracks marring her face. She did straighten her shoulders and take a step forward, then another larger one, dragging her handler forward with her.
Ron turned around to walk back up to the house, stopping only to lace his fingers with Draco’s over their son’s knee.
“I was told to leave.” Ron said standing to his full height. He refused to take the blame for the way things had ended up.
“I know, fuck I know, I am too. But I’m here.”
“I'm calling Granger and the Weasel. Your no fun when your sick.” Draco threw himself off the couch when Harry threw an old tissue at him scrambling for the floo on his hands and knees. Harry let out a croaking laugh behind him.
“Dat ass”
Harry eyed the small dementor still hovering menacingly, now that he was sure what it was. Mr. Malfoy followed behind her, her long stride keeping her ahead. Harry continued to follow at a slower pace, wary of the wraith. He looked over at KingslEy who had a troubled look on his face, his eyes darting up and away from the dementor periodically.
“You didn't do anything.” Neville told her.
“Na it's dat ass for me.” he said, still laughing.
He knew she understood by the look in her eyes. 20 years and motherhood had not lessened anything about the brightest witch of her age. Hermione nodded, throwing a glance down the hill where both their husbands were at. There were no lights, he and Draco had decided ahead of time not to draw attention to the children before knowing where they stood.
why do my Drarry stories always come out so short?
Harry smiled at the glazed look in Malfoy’s grey eyes when they pulled apart.
“Neville” Draco gasped above him.
Malfoy was attentive whenever Harry talked, asking questions about his plans over the summer break and how his first year of teaching went. He listened to the boring stories of being an auror during peacetime. Neither brought up the war. They didn't talk about their families or the dark year or two that the trails were part of after the war. They never did. Maybe one day they would have to air all of that nastiness out but not that day.
With that, Dean moved over to the nest Pansy had built, careful to keep Malfoy between them and the wall at her back.
Mrs. Malfoy saw him first.
“Of course.” she frowned at him.
“Right, all that inbreeding must have gone and bred out the need for a liver.” Harry shot back halfheartedly.
And that was the best thing Malfoy had ever called him.
It started at Hogwarts, two  redheaded brothers embracing each other and touching their foreheads together. One was missing an ear. The next one was a wedding to a faceless bride. Then him laying a kiss on a rounded stomach and laying his ear against it. Fred Weasley looked radiantly happy. The portraits moved through his life, showing him with a baby,then babies then growing children and with a wife and a home and a life that would never be lived. It cycled through the images slowly enough to catch his face in every frame. The happiness in holding a daughter's hand and the sadness of his son boarding a train. There was pride while watching a quidditch game and even sadness when his daughter got married. All images of Fred living the life the weasleys had always wanted to him.
“There you have it. Draco did nothing wrong under his own choice. But” he paused gritting his teeth “Please-” he ground out “allow me to find my son before we are separated forever.”
“He’s lucky they take after their bearer.” she said under her breath nudging Ron on the back as he headed to meet Blaise and lighten his load.
Harry felt his breath catch in irrational fear. He knew Draco was fine if not just emotionally and physically exhausted like the rest of them but he felt his heart skip a beat, then take off at high speed when he saw the rise and fall of his breathing.
“And who’s fault was that huh?!” he hissed at him through clenched teeth trying and failing to reign in his anger.
Harry sat for a few minutes looking around at the great hall. It was still beautiful, still looked like home to him. But there was so much sadness packed into the grand room. So many dead, fighting for him, with him.
“Yeah, as well as it could have I think.” he answered, not taking his eyes off his precious load as he arranged Scorpius in his arms in a bridal carry, arms under his neck and kneed.
Harry was nervous.
“I told him none of you liked him after what he did to you.” he said hollowly.
Draco could feel his eyes begin to water again. He had held in his sobs as they had walked back to the eighth year dormitory, back ramrod straight as he struggled to keep up with Neville and keep his defenses up against the trio behind him. He had felt stupid to believe that his apology would be accepted and mortified beyond belief that the rejection had stung just as badly as it had in first year. There had been physical blows this time instead of just a verbal lashing, but both had reduced him to tears and made him feel pathetically small.
“I had hoped we would get a set, but none of us have so far.” he said softly.
He saw a shadow move in the corner of his eye and turned to see the dementor move away from them, now fully formed if a bit small. Behind him he heard the rushing sound of a portkey activating, sending Mr. Malfoy with Snape’s body directly to the ministry. The remaining auror finally moved into the boat house now that the path was clear. He came back seconds later with Draco in his arms, much like Mr. Malfoy held Snape.
“It’s ok,” Neville murmured, taking the cloth from Draco and soaking it again. He suppressed a flinch when the dittany met the skin of his lip.
Draco didn't move any faster, every once in a while he would stop and peer at a- peer down Harry corrected himself firmly- Harry could see his shoulders shaking harder and harder each time he moved on.
Harry just goggled at him. Dean rolled his eyes and moved with his armful back over to Malfoy’s side of the room.
“Dementor” he whispered “is that a dementor”
When Draco woke up hours later, his lovey had been replaced under his cheek by a broad chest, and his bear was no longer in his arms.
Kingsley looked at him slightly through the corner of his eye, not breaking pace behind the Malfoys.
After that even Ron, who had been the most wary, had come around and accepted any and all cuddling and name calling as normal behavior.
“If you have no idea what the problem here is, Potter then I'm really not sure what to tell you. If you don't even know what I'm doing tonight or why I'm doing it despite it being all ive been able to talk about for the past month then there’s no need for me to be here anymore.”
“And Malfoy did?” Ginny scoffed, chiming in with a scowl.
Malfoy closed his eyes and let out a long breath before fixing his eyes on Harry, running them over his face as if looking for something. His shoulders slumped and he leaned back against the wall.
“Sure Scarhead, it's been awhile since i've had the chance to indulge.” he had said.
Draco was hot just looking at him.
“We’ll have to be careful with that one,” Kingsley said beside him. He still wasn't smiling but his eyes were a little less dull than before, Harry thought. “She’ll take the palace over if we send her to Azkaban.”
“Will we be safe here?” he asked her quietly.
this one came a little short of the 1k line but I really liked where it ended and didn't feel the need to add anymore.  hope you like it!
Harry could barely breath between laughing and coughing but he still managed to wheeze out a response.
He saw Granger’s eyes widen, with guilt or surprise, but Potter remained impassive staring at the floor and Weasley only continued to sneer.
“Wait, what?” he asked dumbly.
Myrtle was the only “person” who knew about him and Draco. They had been together since the very beginning of sixth year when Neville had come across the crying Slytherin in the very same bathroom Neville sometimes took his lunch in. Neville had been wary at first, but Draco didn't make any moves or cruel remarks, only watched him with red rimmed eyes under disheveled hair. Neville had plucked up every piece of Gryffindor courage he could find and sat across from Draco, pulling out his lunch and rolling an apple over to him.
“Yeah, mate. I am. Come with me if you want. Luna and I spent the summer alternating with him at our place. Pansy came with him most times. She can’t sleep in a bed, so the floor it is.”
She cleared her throat slightly and Redding  began to fidget before looking at Harry and crossing over to him.  He barely had time to shove the letter and memories into his pocket before he found himself with an armful of unconscious long limbs and pale skin. Harry looked down at Draco and then up at Mrs. Malfoy. She smiled serenely at him then with a nod from her Redding activated the portkey and they were gone.
Even at a distance and in the pervasive darkness he could make out most of his siblings. Bill stood the tallest with his slight and slender wife next to him. Ginny, of course, was the only girl, though with her short hair, and seekers figure she was almost easily mistakable for Harry next to her. It seemed Harry never did gain the height or musculature his upbringing deprived him of. Charlie was next to them, shorter and stockier than any of the others his impressive build stood out. Ron wondered idly if Draco would find him attractive. He always loved watching Ron add a few pounds during the summer months when Ron was on break.
“Wait what? At that muggle-magical school? You can't be serious? I told you what they wanted to teach Teddy in that place! It's a good thing he was so much older and had already started school so Andromeda was ok with letting him make his own choice in the matter.”
“Puberty does such nice things to wizards.” he had murmured, causing the blush Neville had been fighting to win and spread rapidly across his cheeks.
Draco didn't move any faster, every once in a while he would stop and peer at a- peer down Harry corrected himself firmly- Harry could see his shoulders shaking harder and harder each time he moved on.
Harry only blinked at him. He had no idea what to even begin to think about that. Truthfully it sounded more like a fairy tale than anything else, but he had the Elder wand in his hand and the Invisibility cloak in his pocket so who was he to say it wasn't true.
He could see the rest of his siblings drawing nearer to get a glimpse. He caught Fred’s eye over his mum’s shoulder. He was crying and Angelina  held him tightly.
Harry had thought it would be perfect. It could be their spot. When he had come the weekend  before to check it out he had noticed the inn across he way from the pub. He hadn't wanted to presume anything but he was also more than ready for everything he could get from Malfoy. They had been working together at Hogwarts for a year and with summer coming up he knew he wouldn't be able to see Malfoy nearly as much as he wanted to. He was already dreading the separation.
“Merlin's balls you really are sick aren't you?” he asked him.
“No,” Draco shook his head. “I mean ‘dat’. You said “dat” on purpose.”
Draco, who was kneeling up on the bed, one arm braced against the wall with the other wrapped protectively around his protruding belly. Ron could see the tension of his shoulders and the fear in his eyes when they landed on Ron. He was by his side in seconds.
“I am ready to go now. I will take the body with me to the ministry and have my lawyers begin burial proceedings according to his will.”
Harry had no idea what to say. Draco worked for the Council of Magical Law. Not for some school. Right?
Ron let his dad have the picture and pulled Draco in for a tight hug, dispelling the glamor he still wore. He heard sounds of shock and congratulations all around him when Draco’s large pregnant belly was exposed. Ron never could have imagined his family cheering for them at hearing their news and the sound of it was almost as wonderful as the beautiful family the man in his arms had given him every day for the last twenty years.
“On my wand.” Bill intoned next, Fluer repeating after him.
“Please, just let us find him and we will all go with you.” Narcissa Malfoy pleaded with Kingsley who looked put out, but not unsympathetic.
“I’m ready when you are auror Redding.” she told him. Redding jumped, jostling Draco only to freeze at the look on Mrs. Malfoy’s face.
Draco reached out a hand to snatch the noise out of the air and found a face on the pillow next to him. His fingertips found the mouth and held them there in case it opened again.
“Please, that was AFTER everything was done! My bill had already passed the Wizengamot, which is the only reason Hermione even heard of it. You helped it be readily accepted by the masses, i'll grant you that, but don't act like you did it out of the goodness of your heart. You did it because it directly affected you with Teddy and William. I certainly didn't see any of you when the magi-muggle primary school opened.”
“I am ready to go now. I will take the body with me to the ministry and have my lawyers begin burial proceedings according to his will.”
“Draco? What is it?”
The scream went on and on, drowning Harry and pulling him down deeper into his despair over the senseless loss of life. It was  like a banshee’s scream or a sirens song, never ending and painful, a death knell and acknowledgment of suffering.
“You two should not be as sappy as you are after so many years.” Blaise said good naturedly walking next to them.
Harry felt his breath catch in irrational fear. He knew Draco was fine if not just emotionally and physically exhausted like the rest of them but he felt his heart skip a beat, then take off at high speed when he saw the rise and fall of his breathing.
“And before you lose your tenuous grip on your temper , I only ask you that to say this: the grief you felt at losing your godfather is nothing -” he hissed, finally losing his Malfoy composure “to the grief Draco is feeling at losing his and being the one to find his mangled body. He has always  been there in Draco’s life, from the moment he slipped from my wife’s body into Severus’ waiting hands until the dark lord called him away on the steps of this school.”
“Er, I uh, I mean, I'll try” Harry told her uncertainty. He could feel his face begin to heat up and rubbed at his neck with his extra hand. Mrs. Malfoy was still looking at him with Draco’s gray blue eyes. Harry wondered how he ever thought Draco looked like his father when all they had in common was their hair. Everything else was from his mother.
“Shh it’s ok love. Calm down. I’ll have to go tomorrow to get a pain potion and some. . .” Draco choked, biting off the end of his statement. When Neville tried to catch his gaze he looked away and pulled the quilt higher up practically to his neck.
Neville smiled a bit at that. “I think I'll pass.” he told him.
Harry was stunned. Everyone knew Lucius Malfoy had escaped Azkaban in the first war by claiming to be under the Imperius. That he would allow his son to claim the same under his own hand to guarantee his safety was completely unexpected from the man Harry thought he was. The older Malfoy he had seen through Voldemort's visions had been a broken shell of a man. Even the man Harry had seen only minutes before, still cowering behind his lord, seemed ages away from the desperate father in front of him. That Mrs. Malfoy loved her son was obvious from the first, but he had never realized that Mr. Malfoy might love him as well.
He paused with his lips at the tip of the long slash at the top of a pale shoulder.
And it was with a man.
“Ugh, never mind” he turned back to the floo and tossed in a handful of powder calling out for Granger. Harry was calming down behind him, but he could hear him murmuring to himself in between coughs.
Draco smiled and tried to infuse some warmth into his eyes, trying to be reassuring. He wasn't sure if it worked but he felt the muscles under his fingertips relax and saw Neville give him a watery smile in return.
“From the scream of a soul. One in unimaginable grief, or pain. It’s said the first dementors were born of the squib bastard of the family Azkaban, who was tortured in their private mansion where the prison now sits. Their torture reached his soul and unleashed the dementor on them and drove them madder than they already were. The boy was an obscurial, used every piece of magic he didn't know he had in him to separate his pain from his soul.”
“Hmm, it's a sweaty face for me.” Draco told him.
Draco laughed and wrapped his arms around him.
“It’s ok” Draco told him again “as long as you know, and as long as I have you, I don't care what Potty has to say to me.”
“I agree with Harry, Sirius, it’s not healthy and that goes for you to Sev” draco said, seeing his own godfather try to slip from the room. “Well I agree with the mutt, it’s my choice and I don’t want to.” Severus said glaring at the omega.
“Well it’s just a little shot into their arm and they drop within 10 minutes, it will also immediately remove blocks or Suppressants in their system. If you ever need to drop them again, like on a omega there’s a spot on there neck that will help them drop but you’ll have to make them feel safe, some little tend to pass out after getting induced it completely normal” The healer explained as she stepped forward to first inject Sirius than Severus “please don’t! Harry please! I don’t wanna be a little!!” Sirius begged Harry as he felt the needle enter his arm he began to cry harder before passing out from the shoot or Exhaustion he didn't know Severus soon followed him in unconsciousness.
“Sirius you're 38 it’s not healthy to have never dropped before! Your body needs it to be healthy!” The alpha said sitting down after trying and failing to make his godfather see reason over the last 4 hours.
Sighing harry quickly diaped, clothed and swaddled the little putting him into his crib, before taking severus from draco and repeating the process
“The boys are asleep, the monitor is on” Draco said to his alpha “is it normal for them to sleep this much?” “Yes alpha, they had a stressful day there naturally going to sleep” “I guess that makes sense my omega” the alpha said finally turning around “let’s take advantage of this quiet time” he said kissing his mates neck and shoulder as the two made there way into their bedroom.
“Hello?” Remus asked, stepping through the floo “In here!” Harry called from the living room “Hello Remus, You made it just in time for lunch” Harry said walking over to the boys play pin.
“Okay sirius, i think it's time for a quick bath than a nice afternoon nap” Harry said picking up his godfather turned little who somehow covered himself in pasta sauce into the bathroom

Walking back out to the kitchen, both littles sleeping in their cribs, baby monitor on his belt loop he sat down across from Remus and next to draco.
“Defeated by a baby potter?” The omega said laughing “watch it!” Harry said with amusement shining in his eyes!
“Draco dear, can you call Mungo’s? I think we’re going to have to induce them” he said, pinching the bridge of his nose. “Okay, do we know what ages they’ll drop too?” Draco asked, walking to the floo
“LET ME GO YOU MANGY MUTT!” The upset little yelled “Severus that’s not an appropriate  thing to say!” Draco said sternly walking over to the boy giving his bottom a few swats before putting him into his own highchair while he was in shock of HIS godson ‘punishing’ him
“Toys? I don’t need toys ``''But they're fun to play with” “No! I’m 38 I’m too old to play with toys!” “But you're not, are you? You're only 11 months old after all ``''NO! I'M NOT”  Sirius thought before breaking out into tears
“But” “no buts” “fine...I’m sorry snape” Sirius reluctantly said “You to sev” Harry said looking at his other little “I’m sorry as well” Harry nodded at both of them approving there apologise, Even though they were both fighting there headspaces, certain behaviors and tendencies stayed the same.
“Okay, what can we do?” Harry asked an air of determination around him.
After the two got the sleeping littles got changed into diapers and footed Pyjamas and all comfy in their separate cribs they retreated to the kitchen of 12 grimmauld place “Draco do you think they will need highchairs?” Harry asked the omega “I think that Sirius will but I’m not sure on Sev, maybe we should just to be safe” he responded getting dinner ready “there going to be pissed when they come out of little space” Draco said thoughtfully “Your right my little omega, but we have a few days of adorable little storms look forward to” Harry said kissing the back of his omegas neck.
“That was such a sappy story. Not interesting at all.”
At twenty, James was as excitable as a child half his age at the train station waiting for his first trip to Hogwarts. It was actually not really far from the truth, Harry mused, since it was the day he first started working at the Ministry. As he listened to the young man animatedly reporting his first day at work, he could almost see the story as words excitedly written in the letter his son had sent home after his first day at school.
One silver lining of this unplanned cohabitation was that it was easier for him and Potter to sneak around together when no one was watching. When Potter sought him out the first time, late at night while he was in the study, it did take him aback. He had half a mind that their tryst earlier this year was nothing but a figment of his imagination and there was no way that this would continue. But Potter was stubborn and persistent, and like with Pansy, he was beaten into submission. What else could he do, really, living half a life hiding away in his mother’s family ancestral home, bounded by secrecy and hostility. It was perhaps inevitable.
“Was he? Me and Scorp were out there this morning. There were lots of fancy gravestones out there, with lots of words on them. But there was this one with just a flower, and another simple one that said, uh, Dra... Dragon... Lucy... Malfoy... Potter?”
“Come,” she breathed, as she bordered the perimeter of the room to a tall opened window. She hoisted herself up the window frame and hooked one leg over the edge, dangling half outside of the window to the tall height beneath and leaning against the vertical beam. She did not ask again. Harry supposed he could have ignored her, or better yet just left and returned to his dorm room. Yet, he found himself approaching her and copying her posture, leaning against the opposite side of the window frame while keeping a large gap between them. For awhile neither of them spoke and just stared out at the heavily clouded sky.
“Follow me.”
“What?”
“… You're right. How about I tell you about that one time when I raced a dragon over the grounds of Hogwarts?...”
The only consoling thought was that Harry was still allowed to see his grandsons. Harry felt like someone had stabbed him when he finally knew of the baby boy's birth and rushed to the hospital just to find out that Diane was about to be checked out. But still, James had allowed him to hold the new baby, albeit grudgingly. They saw each other at Christmas brunch every year at The Burrow. Each time Albus complained loudly that he no longer saw his granddad around any more, James would turn away, face hardened, and Harry would feel like dying a little more.
