The food appeared, one course after another. when even the last slice of gelatine disappeared, dismissed the students, they went to the teachers' table (Hagrid greeted Harry with a big smile). Harry had the chance to see who had returned: many Slytherins, one Hufflepuff, Hannah Abbot, Luna, Neville, Dean, Seamus and the three of them. In a corner, darkened by the shadow of a statue, hid the unique and unmistakable Draco Malfoy. He seemed different... More mature, maybe? Grown-up? However, it was the same guy two inches taller than Harry (or rather, the same ferret).
"Did you pack your bags?" Arthur asked them. They all nodded, so he, looking at the clock, sent them to dress up, because on September 1 there was always a big fuss at the Burrow.
! Please... Look at me" She was still panicking "Weasley! Potter! Someone help me!" She didn't know what to do...
There was another problem. Their M.A.G.O. They had both gotten worse at school and McGonagall kept reminding them.
Harry looked at him eloquently and commented "Really? Do I have to remember you that, when Albus arrived, you were so tired that you gave him your coffee instead of the milk?"
"Walcome back, to those already familiar to Hogwarts, welcome to the others. As you all know well, this has been a place of great suffering, so I ask you to be respectful, but nevertheless I hope it will be for you a place of great goy and redemption. A lot of people fought for Hogwarts, so I expect wizards with potentialities to make them proud. That said, I warn the eighth year students that I want to spend with you two words, after the banquet."
After an hour, since the camp had been booked by the Slytherins, they went to change and went upstairs to celebrate the new team. Halfway, he realized he had forgotten his bag in the locker room and, with a bored puff, went back. Convinced that he was alone, he entered, but then Draco came out of the bathroom.
Harry and Draco spent the most of their free time together. It was good to talk with someone that could understand him, Harry thought, and they also had a lot of things in common. They sat in class, had lunch and studied in the library together, helping each other in Potions or DADA. The professors were very happy that they two were friends, because they both got better. Students watched them in the corridor suspiciously. One day, in the library a fourth year student asked them "So, now you're friends?"
Ron and Hermione were still asleep, hugged, Harry saw. It had been months since he had seen Voldemort’s body lying dead on the ground, as that of Lupin and Tonks and Fred. Mrs Weasley was still having nightmares, especially since the time she found the boggart in Ginny’s closet. However, they were all confident that they could heal those wounds, that they could return to normal life, maybe. Anyway, the ones that were worse were the three of them. They had wounds that couldn't be healed: an abduction, a torture and, well... Harry was just Harry. Ron, every night, woke up to look for his girlfriend next to him, Hermione often had panic attacks and Harry had always this orrible nightmare. He woke up scared, hurted by his own past memories. When he closed his eyes they were there, the bodies of his loved ones, dead. He lost so much in his life, he often wondered how he could wake up every morning. He kept telling himself that he had to be strong, because Ron had Hermione, but he had no one, or at least, no one like that. He and Ginny had broken up at the end of June, agreeing that there was only friendship between them, in fact they were like brother and sister.
He returned to the Common Room, announced he didn't feel very well, apologized to Ron and went to his room. After a few minutes, Malfoy reached him. He put his bag on the floor and sat next to him, on the bad.
What had happened? Maybe he was right, since he kissed him, Harry had only felt pain. Why did he have to continue suffering for a person? It was worth it?
"Yes" Something changed in Draco's eyes. He no longer had that unsettling, cold look. Now he seems more relaxed, as if he had lifted a burden. They stood looking at each other for a while when-
The evening passed quietly: they had fun, ate, drank (Pansy maybe a little too much). At midnight they made a toast and exchanged the gifts, which they would open the next morning. Completely unexpected, Draco handed his gift to Harry. It was a tiny box, covered in green paper, his favorite color.
Hermione, who had stopped to talk to Harry before going up to the room, arrived at the door and frozed. There were bottles of Fire Whisky all around Pansy's bed and such a mess that gave her shivers.
"Great. Now the 'captain' thing. This is my last training as yours. After today, team will be led by Ron. Any questions?" Ron froze. He didn't expect it... He joined Harry and hugged him "Thank you"
"Guys, we know that you are in love and blah blah blah. But please, cast a Muffliato the next time. We heard you." Pansy scolded them. Ron had the ears red, trying to hold back the laughter.
After some minutes Pansy whispered "How can we survive this if we can’t even look each other in the eye? How can we do this alone? Look at us, what’s this damn war done to us? We’re not the same people who eight years ago were waiting to know what house they were gonna be in. Some people have nightmares (Draco and Harry’s eyes met), some panic attacks... some depression. What matters is that we’re here, grown up, alive. I mean, look at Potter and Malfoy. Who remembers them? They couldn’t be in the same room and now they’re... friends? They stay together even at lunch. I’d say it’s time to do what they did, move on."
After a while all the others arrived: Hermione and Ron (with Hugo and Rose), Morag and Blaise, Luna and her husband Rolf Scamander, Justin, Seamus and Dean and, quite late, Theodore, Pansy and Draco, with a new-born baby in his arms.
"I’m not trying to mind your business, I can help you" He patiently explained, and it was true. He couldn’t watch him suffer every night more and do nothing.
"Sorry, I didn't mean to wake you" answered Harry, avoiding her question. Hermione always worried about him, this made him feel 'loved', but sometimes he preferred to take care of himself.
Since that week something seemed to lighten in Harry. The nightmares didn’t disappear, but they seemed more bearable. Harry understood that the burden that shattered his bones every night was his remorse, what he did not admit to himself. He kept reliving the moment he saw Draco shirtless... something reassured him. He didn't know what it was, but it was there. Maybe all he had to do was say what he knew.
Harry panicked. He saw all his scars, that Harry made on their sixth year. He gets sick, his head was spinning, he was sweating cold. He swallowed hardly, put a hand on the wall and ran out of that room, which seemed to be tightening around him. Draco followed him, worried.
It didn’t work out so much better for the others either, judging by the fact that was heard an explosion from the chamber of Seamus and Theodore, the crack of a broken vase (followed by the scream of Neville, of course) and Luna, who was yelling at Hannah because she didn't believe that Nargles were real.
"If I did my job right" Harry said, opening the door. Everyone was there, standing in front of them.
Apparently they were silent, but it was a silence full of thoughts and words, that they couldn't say. They got closer...
"Okay" mumbled Ron, more to himself. He didn't know how he possibly could handle it. Anyway, he laid his trunk and Leo’s cage on his side of the room.
Dark, panic. That's how it starts. It's hot, an overwhelming heat... His bones are breaking... Then appears him. His pale face and those fiery red eyes that for years has been the object of his worst nightmares. He's coming, closer and closer...
Hermione ignored her, even though she was outraged, and started unpacking her books (that were, actually, a lot).
They spent the rest of the night on the Astronomy Tower, looking at the sunset, finally together. When it started to get cold, they decided to return in the common room, holding hands.
Harry pretended to know nothing about it... the thought that Malfoy did it for this made him feel deluded. He hoped, only for a fleeting moment, that he had cared for him because he wanted to and not because he had to for a stupid Life Debt. There was something, deep inside him, that he only had to admit to himself... Maybe he just need to be loved. Like Hermione and Ron... But not like Ginny. A different tipe of love. Harry only had to figure it out...
Harry really don't understand. He tried to help him anyway: he had even offered him help with the DADA's tasks, with which Draco was in clear difficulty, but there was nothing to do.
"It doesn't matter anymore. Probably I would have done the same. You acted instinctively. I have to apoligize to you for what I did all that year... For how I treated you... you know what? The most of the time I was gelous of you. I'm not trying to justify myself, there is no forgiveness for everything I said... To you and your friends... I just want to say, you don't have to apologize for anything" His cheeks turned pink, a pale and graceful pink, barely visible in the soft sunset light. Harry's face brightened, only now he realize that he was still bare-chested. He must have followed him soon after... This made him feel kind of 'loved'. But first he had to make things clear.
"You will no longer suffer because of me, I promise." He kissed him. It was a wet kiss from the tears of the two boys. Harry slipped his hands in his hair, twisting them. How much he missed all that... Draco's passionate kiss, the sound of his voice, his hand on his face and, well, just Draco.
The sun soon rose and his friends started to woke up. He left the room and joined them. He really didn't want to celebrate, but it was Christmas... They all opened their gift: Harry received a Quidditch book from Hermione, a new eagle feather from Ron and... A wonderful violet glass flower from Malfoy. There was a note attached to the package: "In the hope you understand. Sorry. Draco". He was so confused that he decided to not do anything, for now. He would have figured it out when he would be ready. They spent the holidays trying to avoid each other, until it was time to return to Hogwarts. He went back to school and the only thing he had of Draco was that flower, that seemed to have changed its color... It was a more intense purple... It had to be only his imagination.
Outside, the wind was crisp on his skin. Harry’s bag of sherbet lemons carried the zingy perfume into the street. His smile was wide and crooked with indiscreet complicity.
Harry hummed a bit at that, lips buzzing around Draco, and Draco suppressed a wrecked groan. When he looked down at Harry - beautiful, unbelievable Harry, who was so flushed still, surely all sensitive and sweaty under his sorry shirt, and yet on his
- to wear as little clothes as possible. He hadn’t expected Harry to make him wait in the freezing fucking halls.
‘We’re getting a drink,’ he announced, though no one paid much attention amidst the heated discussion, and left Draco to follow him in a hurry.
‘No one’s gonna steal it,’ Harry retorted. His voice, tilted bright and energetic, beckoned Draco’s attention. He was fiddling with his glasses, distractingly endearing in his robes and looking properly warm for once in his damned life. ‘Everyone still thinks the house is haunted.’
The bartender poured it until the dense foam was brimming from the tall glass. Pansy drank heartily, while Draco, who was beginning to feel a pesky headache, took a measured sip, and they both turned ever so slightly to watch the group. Draco’s gaze, as it was wont to, searched Harry: he hadn’t taken Pansy’s seat, planted precisely where Draco had left him, his hand still on Ron’s shoulder and the glass of lobe-blaster near his lips. From that angle, only his profile was visible, but Draco could still easily see how disheveled he was, hair inexcusable and shirt creased - shirt, yes, since the incorrigible bloody fool had already hung his robes on the back of Ron’s chair - and what did that mean but that every other patron at the pub could see the same, and appreciate just how thoroughly fucked out Harry looked, and wonder who had put him in such a state?
Potter just glanced at him, one eyebrow raised high over the edge of his glasses, and then stood up:
And Harry looked at him for a long while, long enough, Draco assumed, to judge the sincerity in his expression - which was pure and obvious and the type of hopelessly in love that’s impossible to distrust - before he smirked a little.
‘Yes, on the ground,’ Harry scoffed, squirming a little as Draco pressed slow kisses down his neck. ‘D’you plan on leaving blood everywhere, mate?’
'Out in a minute,' Draco shouted before he set to fix Harry's clothes. His arousal was a bothersome urge he pushed primly down, trying to will his erection away while Harry came down from his high. 'You alright there, love?'
gaze, since she wasn’t just another pesky Gryffindor with the wonderfully simplistic notion that Malfoy was Malfoy and hence he hated Harry, no, she
‘Here,’ Draco agreed eagerly. ‘Whatever, Potter. Just take your shirt off as well,’ and as he said it he finished on the last of the buttons and yanked the fabric from Harry’s lean arms, discarding it on the floor. Harry’s chest was all pale with flushed patches - and there they were, bringing back a bitter hint of guilt, fading bruises forming patterns over his ribs. Draco traced a few with his fingers, a light touch over the healing blood vessels, following up the ridge of his sternum and to his nipples. They were small and pink and surrounded in sensitive, quivering muscle, and, in Draco’s dreams, they’d always been too flickering a construct to properly appreciate - now, with no shortness of time and the solidity of reality, Draco indulged himself by flicking one, then rubbing the pretty little bud until it hardened.
smile on his lips, and Draco wasted no time in looping an arm around his waist and kissing his cheek warmly. He primly ignored Blaise’s smirk.
The question was curtly accusatory: there was no doubt there, only the frustration of something unconfirmed, and it’d be in his instinct to lie - always was, whenever questions sounded too much like interrogations, because that’s what he’d been
They went down after a couple of minutes, outerwear strategically bunched in front of their crotches and gazes stubborn on the steps. Harry was nursing the bottle of rum they’d left on the vanity. He didn’t actually seem that different from usual - his hair was a rat’s nest, his cheeks a precious shade of pink, but wasn’t that the norm? Draco ought to look much worse, so far from his composed demeanour, so raw with pitiful emotion. But it wasn’t like he could hide it so easily, was it? Because Harry was now all closed walls and angled corners, but a moment ago he’d been kissing him so softly, and telling him they should do it again, making a fucking
Draco rolled his eyes. There it was, the first effect of the veritaserum running see-through in his bloodstream: when he tried for a pitiful ‘No’, his tongue was tied, a spasm of muscle that kept his mouth shut. He laughed, something wry and resigned.
Draco scoffed - and this time, when he spoke, his own voice had raised, his body unfurling tense and aggressive.
‘You’re overthinking something,’ Harry’s voice wavered between a whisper and a shout. ‘Look, can I just-’ he sighed, glanced at the door and caught Draco in a quick kiss, more aggressive than anything, a kiss whose purpose was in itself, a millisecond of pressure before he was pulling away. ‘I
‘Malfoy,’ Harry breathed, a little whine that ended in a moan. The sound made heat pool in Draco’s stomach.
‘You don’t really have to, though,’ said Sue, her voice ragged from the shot she’d downed. ‘The game is just what you think, not what you both agree.’
At that Harry huffed a laugh, though his brow was still furrowed. Pensive. Unsure. His eyes flittered around, only meeting Draco’s fleetingly.
‘It’s an interesting topic,’ Draco dismissed, ‘You haven’t answered my question. Surely you see they aren’t right for each other.’
He left the Great Hall alone. Pansy stayed with Blaise, which truly was quite laughable: not like she'd be able to distract him from the new Ravenclaw he so fancied - and, truly, it really was just impossible to conceive how everyone made friends so
Ron smirked. He straightened his own three shots into a neat line in front of him. ‘It’s some wretched Muggle thing. Absinthe, I think it’s called.’
Draco sighed as he remembered his argument with Ron. All those cold, sharp words, the doubt it’d brought him, how wrong it had made him feel. Like he was poisoning Harry’s skin with his fingers.
Draco tried his best to pry his eyes away from the curve of Harry’s neck, where the skin was flushing from the cold. ‘None.’
But Harry had been proving him wrong all night. Shifting between states since Draco had found him in the moonlit room. Unpredictable only because Draco was too in love and too expectant.
Draco laughed, then watched as Harry took another bite. It was his third one - he didn’t seem intent on slowing down.
'Well,' Draco smirked, and leaned down just a bit, enough to kiss the tip of Harry's cock, to coax a surprised moan, 'I figured they'd be very impure thoughts, for someone as saintly as the Boy Who Lived.'
better if it lasts,' he raised an eyebrow, challenging Potter to argue, but he only stared in silent frustration,
'Don't know where you got that idea,' Harry retorted with another smile, 'Hey, did I see you at Hogsmeade last night?'
Draco nodded, dispirited, settling his hand softly on Harry’s back. What else had he expected? He’d pestered Harry for
He took a deep breath, clenched his teeth until it hurt, a nicely grounding pain, and set out on quickly doing Harry's underwear and jeans up. He wouldn't beg Harry to stay only to see him leave. He'd take care of him, tuck him back in, straighten his clothes - because the Harry inside that stall was still his at least - and then let him go out and forget him.
Sue didn’t answer right away, busy taking a swig of the sickly drink. Draco leaned back against the sofa. Out the corner of his eye he could see Harry and Neville, who were still sitting on the table even though there were now plenty better seats available. It was just idiotic, in all honesty: it was freezing in there, why would they rather the table? What on earth were they talking about - had been talking about since Draco had joined them - that was so private? Really, they should at least exchange a few words with the rest of them. It was rude not to. And not just rude: it was a bit selfish too, wasn’t it? They ought to all cram into the sofa and share body warmth. Or maybe not all of them, they wouldn’t fit - but Longbottom could sit in the armchair, he was too inconsequential to freeze anyway, and Harry could sit besides Draco, their sides flushed together, robes draped over them like blankets in some decadent pretense of domesticity, and they’d be close without the pressure of privacy, and Draco could finally scratch that itch that had been growing ever since he’d walked out the infirmary on Saturday, and everyone would be much warmer from it.
the conversation into this very place, but it still dug some cold, hollow spot in his chest, dark inside his ribcage, and he held onto his glass tightly.
'Thanks,' Harry said, quick though genuine. His mind was clearly elsewhere. Draco's was as well: already tangling in his sheets.
‘He found some instructions for an old version of it. Got excited about it. That’s the test,’ Draco murmured.
It wasn’t entirely true. The Slytherins, at first, had taken quite the placid attitude towards Harry. Hatred took commitment - there were much better things to do. No one liked the Boy Who Lived, the name, the symbol, but the actual boy was small and skittish and unremarkable. Draco had been the one to spur the Slytherins on, because he couldn’t hate Harry, but others could. They’d act as sorry surrogates - in the midst of them,
It was difficult, in all truth. Worse, since Draco's mind kept drifting with the urge to push Harry - Harry, who was standing so obediently, hand still in the crook of his elbow, eyes steady and mouth parted for him - against one of the moth-eaten black curtains, covering his body with his, whispering in his ear just how fucking precious, how fucking irresistible he looked. He did finish, regardless, applying the scarlet just a little beyond the pink curves of Harry's lips to get smoother lines. When he finally inched away to look at his work, he felt hot all over, and Harry's lips looked obscenely plump.
But Harry didn’t seem to agree. Instead, he drew one of those smirks of his, all irresistible darkness and ruthless tease, and asked:
For a minute, it seemed that they’d dozed off like that. Draco pulled one of the dark green covers over them, and they deflated into the warm space, heavy-lidded eyes blinking sluggishly at the dim  lighting. He was drifting off in this state of lightheaded bliss - because everything was so fucking
'You should hurry,' Harry huffed, shifting his own weight to one forearm so he could wrap a hand around his cock.
‘No, but it’d hardly feel private,’ Harry smirked, and then he was raising his head properly to look at him with amusement in his eyes. ‘At least not as private as it’ll be in that flat in London.’
Harry was at his side, and Draco could do little else than glimpse out those windows and picture his past self in the street, desperately in love and bitterly jealous, and feel that the universe, despite its infuriating workings, had truly been impossibly kind.
‘Fruits?’ Nearly Headless Nick asked, his voice high-pitched in confusion. Then, with one very audible click in his mind, his eyes widened and his head slid right off his neck, dangling by sinew.
Draco had seldom felt as much joy as he did in that moment. Maybe when he found out Potter had broken up with that upsettingly beautiful Cho Chang; or the other night, each time he’d seen Harry wearing his coat. In short, it was the type of joy indissociable from Harry; warm and boisterous, dangerous in its intensity, frightening in its hope for future things, for
He slackened his jaw even more, burying his nose in Harry's taut skin, feeling him twitch deep down his throat. He'd relented on his slow rhythm now, figuring Harry deserved to actually come after being so teased. He bobbed his head with purpose, willing his muscles to relax so he could keep as much of the length inside his mouth - and each time he swallowed around him in his insistent pace he was rewarded with Harry's sounds.
'Sorry, Malfoy,' he offered with a crooked smile - those damn smiles Draco was always seeing, that were only directed at him to polish a casual apology.
now, because he’d always had to guess Harry’s preferences in his fantasies, the way he liked things, the spots he liked Draco to kiss and touch, how careful, how rough, what he liked to be called, what he went
'You know, technically, it has to be the best,' he drawled, trying to ignore how unbalanced he felt.
He wanted to talk to him. He’d thought - and thinking really was so often conducive to disappointment - that that odd night in the Three Broomsticks had been some kind of hallmark in their relationship. They’d
Harry laughed. A ghost woman hovered past them in a frenzy, hips swaying in pale static as she neared her friend. He followed her with his gaze, then let it scan the entire hall, the strange formality of it, the decrepit decorations and moth-eaten curtains. When he looked back at Draco, he seemed thoughtful.
It was by pure impulse and panic that Draco leaned to his right, clashing against the end of Harry’s broomstick before he lost him for good -
‘Sod off,’ Harry laughed, a breathless sound as Draco guided them through the dancefloor. For all of Harry’s insecurities, he had quite the delicacy in his stance. Beautiful, a mesmerizing paradox of meek and confident. Draco reckoned they made quite the perfect pair - in dancing as well as everything else.
‘You sure are taking your time, Malfoy,’ came Harry’s voice - and the door closed, and Draco turned to see them both cramped in the narrow space, the dim lightbulb flickering above them.
Harry was four feet from the ground - and Draco was still too far - when he finally regained control of his broom, swerving up so quickly that only the bristles of the broom grazed the grass. He flew up, swirling as he did so, stuttering in an unsteady route - and then, a millisecond later, he was all elegance again, practically laying over his broomstick, cutting intently through the air.
been a stupid question, really - Harry and his friends hadn’t spent a Friday night at Hogwarts since the year had started.
There was only one moment of friction. It came from Ron, since he was by far the most loose-tongued, when Draco was discussing the healing properties of murtlap tentacles with Luna.
In clumsy, haphazard movements, and with a persistent glare, Harry slid his arms into the grey sleeves. It looked too large on him, swallowed him up in fabric, and he looked warm for the first time that night, and Draco was
Digging his nails into his palms, he turned. The Slytherins had swooped down as well, standing a little way off, unsure of what to do. He’d go to them, and tell them to change for class, to pay no mind to what had happened. Nothing
‘You know, it’s not really usual for people to like their first time giving head,’ he went on, circling a bit of the damp cloth over Harry’s sensitive cockhead. ‘You’re just made to suck me off, aren’t you?’
Draco glanced at the elevated platform. He thought he could see, through the buzzing heads of dozens of students, McGonagall’s beady eyes trained on his.
him, he excused himself with a curt nod and headed to the bar. Let Pike fend for himself against those two; Draco wouldn’t spend another second listening to their simple, fluid romance. It made him jealous, simple as that.
Once they’d dismounted, Blaise ushered them inside of Kettle Bottom. The place was cramped as usual. On one of the small tables sat Rowena, her hair in rich brown braids, dripping of classic romanticism. She was the sort of serene one practises in the mirror - Draco suspected Blaise fancied her all the more for it - and, when they ordered their drinks, she got a lean glass of Daisyroot and drank in measured sips.
Draco nodded. His head felt heavy - if from the surrealism of the situation, or the two beers he'd downed so quickly, he didn't know.
There was a beat of silence. Ron stared at the shears; Draco let his own gaze wander back to the greenhouse, searching through the glass panels for his workbench and, further off, for any signs of a raven ash head.
‘Sure,’ Granger’s eyes were narrowed in the same way they’d been when she’d followed Draco across that hall. ‘Never have I ever thrown a bloody helmet into a classroom while drunk.’
There was a retort somewhere that he could have used, something akin to flirtation, if he was bolder. But Potter’s friends were there, Pansy was staring, and Potter’s unfaltering expression, all humour and courage and
They only took a small sip each. It was remarkably flat in flavour and, after it had vanished down his throat, it made him feel no different.
A rushed clash of lips that was entirely too warm, and sudden, and firm as it pressed against his own - and Harry's hand was still on his chest, over his scar, and Harry was fucking kissing him, and Draco had dreamt about this for
Pansy swatted his arm. ‘You, my dear, are awfully dramatic. We’ve survived the Dark Lord, one would think we’ll survive Harry Potter as well. Come now, before breakfast ends. You’ve been out here too long.’
‘Alright,’ Harry slurred the word, looking at Draco like he was some strange, incomprehensible creature. ‘And why the fuck do you want Luna’s lipstick?’
What could Draco even answer to that? What could he say now, as he looked into Harry’s expectant eyes, that wasn’t uncomfortably eternal? What could he ask for now but for a promise? For a future? Be in my life, be in my bed, be at my side until the end - be wherever I am, never leave, never make me endure the loss of you. Honest answers, irrevocable words. And though Draco looked, though he tried with every nerve in his being, though he scanned every atom of Harry’s expression for a
it, he was one for five hushed minutes in the night, he wouldn't explore, he wouldn't tease himself. No, that was Draco's role, and if only he had the
their picture didn't make sense - he knew everyone expected Potter to be mouthing drunkenly at some smitten girl's neck, her pretty frame under his arm, and it was truly, entirely such a
‘I’m not going,’ he murmured, curling in on himself on the plush sofa. He’d never quite made it to the dormitories; he’d taken a seat in the common room with the innocent intention of waiting it out until his head stopped spinning, but his muscles had been too eager and sitting had turned into laying. He’d slept there for the rest of the night, his clothes creasing as he tossed and turned and his tongue still tasting of Harry’s come.
‘Did you really have no suspicion those two were a thing?’ Harry asked, looking at the little red bag in his hands.
The walk to the dungeons was a strange event. He went through the halls in a bleak daze, not paying much attention to his surroundings, descending a set of stairs he’d forgotten existed, and found himself in the Tapestry Hall. He ran out of there with clenched teeth, almost clashing against a rattish, frightened young Ravenclaw. She was the harmless sort of innocence, and he still hated her, hated that damn room, that fucking storage room, his terrible friends for convincing him to go to the Quidditch pitch in the first place.
Guilt was corroding him, yet a sullen, self-righteous part of him recounted every time he’d tried to help nicely, looping it incessantly in his mind, casting in the reflection of his brew the first time Harry had fallen, when Draco had been sure he would hit the ground and bash his head in, and it hissed in a voice that was low and adamant and entirely Slytherin: he hadn’t done the good thing, but he’d done the
That surely explained why Weasley had been so relatively tame towards him. Sometimes, Draco suspected the ginger hated him more than Harry did.
Draco slapped his hand away. ‘None of that if I can’t join in,’ he stated, smirking at Harry’s half-hearted glare. He lifted his head again to shout, ‘We’re here. What do you want?’
‘Draco is,’ Blaise shrugged. ‘I don’t quite know about you. You were with that Weasley girl, weren’t you?’
‘We haven’t discussed it,’ Harry said at last, then took a big sip of firewhiskey. Draco realized they truly hadn’t, and thought it a grave, terrible, incomprehensible mistake.
than his, and he seethed. ‘You know what, have it your fucking way.’ He raised his voice, the wind snapping the collar of his coat up as he searched around the field. ‘Harper! Harper! Where’s- Whitby, tell Harper she’s benched. I’m playing.’
‘I did want to kiss you before,’ Harry went on. His eyes had taken on a reminiscent twinkle. ‘Remember that night with the veritaserum? You left in such a hurry, and I found myself thinking - I should have pushed him against the shelves and kissed him.’
He’d figured that, after he’d kissed him, after he’d blown him for his very first time, he’d conquered the right of being called something less trivial. He hadn’t expected a pet name - no ‘love’, no ‘dear’, he was greedy but not an imbecile -, but ‘mate’ was the same name Harry had for Justin Fletchley, and Draco surely couldn't be on the same level as that colour-washed Hufflepuff. Then again, perhaps he was on a lower level now. He didn’t know what he was; he didn’t know what Harry
Ron had the decency to look somewhat apologetic, at least, and the flush on his face softened to one of embarrassment.
'You haven't come yet,' Harry answered simply, and then he was slipping away from the narrow space between Draco and the sink, his body still shaking a little. Draco turned to watch him, his own back against the sink now.
. A smidge of dark red so stark against pale skin; just like that night in the Shrieking Shack, when they'd kissed and Harry had gotten blood on his lip; or that first time Draco had gone to Hogsmeade with Pansy, so nervous at the mere prospect of seeing Harry, and crimson had dropped from his lips as he downed two shots of firewhiskey. Oh, and he felt drunk now as well, insides churning with each focused swipe of the lipstick, filling in Harry's lips to the rhythm of the symphony rumbling around them, layering red over red, colouring him every inch the Gryffindor he was.
'Fuck, Potter,' he breathed out, and latched on the skin of his jaw, kissing the solid bone there, nibbling with a little too much teeth; Harry moaned, an actual broken sound that felt almost painfully vulnerable, and Draco wanted to be the only person who ever made Harry like this.
Celestina Warbeck's intimate vocals rolled throughout the street as the Hog Head's door was opened. Draco wondered if the couple had gone in, and turned his head to check.
It was a hassle to clean the faint red smudges from his skin. Dizzying as well, since Draco was entirely too aware he’d trailed those lines with his own lips just a few moments ago.
The rest of the journey passed quickly, and then they were again in the familiar, cozy, beautiful Great Hall. The last time Harry saw it was during the battle, but there was a lot of dead bodies on the ground. Now the tables stood out and from the transparent ceiling hung the banners of the four houses. After the Sorting Ceremony, McGonagall made the usual speech of the principal
idly in, so he ignores her and takes the sofa. It's a good lounge, this, reminiscent of the Slytherin common room in many ways, and the black leather sofa's fit for three people at least. Or Draco.
“Didn't say you were,” but he says it so softly it is a weak, token protest at best. Harry folds him just a little closer in his arms.
to decide he wanted to make a family with Sirius, moments – not many – to know that he trusted Remus. There had never been a time when he did not love and respect Dumbledore, almost as a parent, even after he realised everything the man had put him through. One by one they had all abandoned him, just like his parents, time and again he had berated himself for putting his trust in their love, swearing this time was the last. He had only ever been able to turn his heart off when it was never wholly there for the person in the first place; Cho, Ginny – he had shied sharply away from actually falling in love, terrified that his dependence upon anyone, his need for anyone could only ever be a curse on them.
But they're not thirteen any more and when their faces break apart Potter is glaring at him with clenched teeth and hate and confusion, his hand curled in a tight pinch at the back of Draco's neck -
because it is now, it is now, it is and all the things that fucked them up, every manipulative adult who twisted them and used them is dead and gone and the past is a ghost that should not still hurt but then but then but then -
later - ” Pansy says - “Anyway I'm not saying I'm now singing old McGonagall's praises or anything, but she said well –
going to happen. He groans, shoves his hands in his hair, pulling until it hurts his head but still cannot stop it from spinning, realises he is swaying slightly and slides down onto the small square of free floor space with his back against the stack of old gold framed portraits.
It was years ago now. It had been the first time he had told Harry about what happened to their old Muggle studies teacher. He had ended up crying messily into his chest and apologising in a flood, just
“Um – you've seen her? And I mean no, they quite emphatically have not. Wait – how did she know? She hasn't even been here.”
want to talk to Draco at some point, and will, but Fleur's in there and Harry, she suspects from what Hermione has told her, is sulking somewhere and he gives off a bad aura when he sulks. She dithers in the corridor until somebody comes past. It's George Weasley who squints at her -
George looks at him for a searching moment, trying to detect a hint of sarcasm. There isn't any, and he nods.
It occurs to him that this is going to keep happening. That however many times he kisses Draco's scars, tells him how beautiful he is, assures him that he loves him – even if he does it over and over again – there will be a part of Draco that will not – that
“Mrs Tonks.” She sees Andromeda glance at her sister as though seeking a reaction. To her relief Narcissa makes none.
“Delacour-Weasley,” Fleur nods - “It does not sound a good combination? I think? What do you think?”
Draco shrieks in a voice that goes right up to the stands, and storms off across the pitch to prove the point, sitting down on one of the lower benches and glaring across at where Pansy is now talking to Blaise with a hand on his arm. Blaise looks pissed and part of Draco's glad about this but he's also feeling instantly guilty because he knows he's been unnecessarily mean
is perhaps the wrong word for the way he slides into view without appearing to touch anyone. Like Malfoy, Harry cannot help but think that Zabini looks like he was just
wound up even when his insults were subpar – because the urge to hurt him like this has frightened him. It did not occur to him that Draco could
“Oh shut up,” he sighs, and, closing his eyes, takes his cock in his hand, grunting softly to himself at the relief of the sensation.
If he was wiser he would not only recognise that danger signal but have the tact to react to it appropriately. Unfortunately he has too long a history of inability to step down from their arguments.
So. Okay. Processing this, and in light of it, Harry had cut himself off in return as quickly as he could and backed off fast. He loved Draco, there was no getting away from that now, but Draco clearly did not love him and he had promised himself right from the start he would do everything he could to help him. So, helping him, he had gone straight to his room last night and spoken to nobody. He supposed he should have been nicer, friendlier, but the truth was his heart was breaking and he couldn't talk to anyone, just had to do what he had to do that would be for the best. He had just been coming to the decision that he should probably leave Number 12 for a while and go stay maybe at The Burrow or with Neville if he'd have him – anywhere other than be here – when Luna had wandered gently in and turned everything upside down again, as easily as flipping an hour glass.
“I am hearing only good things about you too, of course. Any friend of Luna's -” he smiles benignly, givign Pansy a chance to reply.
“Tough titty. Look. I wanna go back to school, you should hear some of the plans I'm hatching with Peeves. You
““Look Malfoy if you can't think of a better way to insult me I won't apologise for completely effing up last night.””
She stomps off and leaves him with the portrait he has been trying not to look at all this time. Fred comes to the front of the frame and peers out as though it's a camera lens.
still have a place. But haven't the Malfoys always made a place for themselves whatever the world? If that place means doing good rather than harm he'll do it now, even if it's hard, and it will be. For them. He takes a deep breath, takes hold of that memory, gripping onto those two things, the only important things in the world – not him, it's never been about him, he can take that now, only they matter –
“What you have been through, yes, yes nobody else is saying it straight to you because they are all so delicate about the feelings, so English, drinking tea and waiting for the opening up but it does not come because you are all too stiff in the upper lip. I know. I am French, we say things. We see things. And I am seeing you are hating yourself. You are thinking, why am I here with all these stupid people who do not know me and do not understand me? Why are they even caring what I'm feeling when they judge me so harsh? Because your experience of life, of the war, has been from another side, because you are thinking, oh, oh woe is me I am so evil, I have failed at everything, I can never be good again, not moral good, not good at doing things. You are thinking, I am the worst of the worst and I do not deserve to eat, drink and be merry, I do not deserve to sleep without nightmares or be loved by this boy I love -”
Nobody sees her take a deep visible breath in the corridor as she closes the door behind her, nobody sees her close her eyes and gather herself together, but she has to do it outwardly sometimes, just a little. Not as much as other people perhaps; she has been practising this game since she was five and learning how to survive the world. Nobody ever sees her betray an expression if she can help it, nobody could reach into her thoughts however hard they tried. She remembers feeling the Dark Lord probing in there like he probed them all, remembers hiding even her revulsion at the attempts at invasion. She remembers most of all feeling frustration –
the world he had fought for. He is not in the habit of admitting he was in the wrong and he is not one to break a habit. How to pick up the threads of a life when almost every single one of those threads has been cut? He could have been content with death or Azkaban, both of which he had expected far more than this – this curious reprieve, this undeserved leniance. Azkaban the first time round had close to sent him mad; if he had gone back as he should have done he could have taken refuge perhaps in a fuller, more embracing madness, but no, no- he has to hold on here in a terrible weak grasp at sanity alongside all the people he has wronged the most in the knowledge that he is weaker than any of them, his family held together by his wife, the best of him glittering through the cracks his mistakes have made in his son.
Draco pretends not to hear him and continues up. Harry leaps onto the stairway just as it starts to move, taking the stairs at a run and grabbing Draco's shoulder as he reaches the top -
the sobs of not being able to say any of this out loud shake a body so previously unused to suffering that it shudders and hurts his ribs.
He gives Harry the same curious look that Pansy had and drifts off before waiting for an answer. Harry spares half a frown in wondering hat it is they're both looking at when they look at him like that – but not more than half a frown of half a moment of wondering because he cannot tear his eyes, ears or mind away from Draco, how could anyone? He's riding the sky on rainbows, bathing in changing coloured lights. It's a dream, Draco's dream and he is in it. He wonders if the colours he sees are the colours of Draco's thoughts and he's spinning at how beautiful they are and then -
“I can go either way,” Hermione shrugs, looking between Ron and Viktor in a way that makes Harry wonder if she's still talking about music. He feels suddenly like he needs to be elsewhere – or that he needs to give them time without him.
“It's beautiful,” he says. Draco still looks at him suspiciously. “I mean it. You're good. You should play more often.”
I hate you so much, so much that I talk about you all the time and bug the shit out of all my friends wondering what stupid thing you're doing next.””
“Draco Malfoy,” Luna nods “They're very sad and often angry and when he wants to cover up his feelings they go all flinty because he's trying to be hard but he's not – but underneath all that they're very kind eyes, like his mother's only silvery.”
“Succeeding,” Harry grins back, holding him against him by the belt buckle, a silver peacock feather, and honestly Draco's outfit today would have been ridiculous on anyone else, a white tailcoat with a plume of white feathers trailing from the tails. On anyone else it might have appeared preposterous; on Draco it makes him look simply like he only just landed on Earth. In the background, the static of electric guitar sweeps its spaceship parabola through the air and the terrible sound of three happy people singing
“Mrs Wilkins, I – I appreciate this is strange – a complete stranger walking into your house and asking you soemthing like this, but – are you happy in your life?”
When they walk into the first gallery, however, he wants to take his lack of enthusiasm back. The truth is –
Outside and down through the fields, the waves crash gently upon the shingle; somewhere out over the sea the gulls call sleepily in the dark each to each. The wind whispers lovingly through the old stone walls and the blankets are soft, the bed warm and Harry smiles because there is so much to smile about – there was a time he never imagined there could be. In the warm dark of shadow and the gold of the hallway light he nods off halfway to sleep -
He's still sort of walking, sort of backing away from Harry down the corridor, unsure if he wants to be making eye contact or not.
“Look, should I speak to the Parkinsons?” Harry turns to Draco in his own aside - “Maybe it would -”
go back to the House system the way it used to be, actually I've been saying this all summer – even before the lot of us living together proved that we need to embrace our differences – not literally embrace, Luna please put your Weasley down – the system is divisive and unfair and I think especially after everything that happened in the war Slytherins might be specifically at risk -”
“Of course you do,” Draco sighs, a full bodied sigh. “You always do, don't you? That's why we never get anything solved. Oh, what
a little surprised to see Pansy in tentative conversation with Hermione while Luna teaches Viktor some sort of clapping game, Viktor watching and listening intently to try and understand it. Ron says something to him he doesn't hear over the din of chatter.
“Shut up, Malfoy.” Harry gets up, goes over to the little writing desk, smiling. The words are so familiar they cannot help but come out of him almost affectionately. The funny thing is, he does not know when or how, but at some point it seems to him like Draco's sarcasm stopped being a complete pain in his arse and is now quite gently funny. In fact
you doing, eh? Lying in bed watching my feet go round on that daft map of yours then sneaking out in this to join me?”
later. On the other hand, adult now or not, both of them would still more or less always say that the other one started it.
“NO! NO DAD, I'M NOT O- FUCKING KAY! WHY DOES EVERYONE KEEP ASKING ME THAT AS THOUGH I POSSIBLY MIGHT BE?”
“Fft – you are like me, also wanting compliments yes? In truth? You are reminding me of my little sister.”
that person, sometimes he drives Harry bonkers with his arrogant self esteem and poise and perfection and snooty superior preciousness. Sometimes, he thinks he's the best thing that could happen to anybody, like his very bloody presence is doing them a favour just like the brat who offered him his hand on their first day at school. And then sometimes, sometimes he's the worst person who ever lived, alternately useless, pathetic, wretched or evil, appalling and cruel. Harry will never understand how one person can simultaneously be all of those things, however hard he tries.
“Anyway if you lot are quite done with the school reunion -” Flint cuts on in stolidly - “There's no
She pauses a moment again just in front of the shiny red door, straightens her shoulders and lifts up her chin; looking perfect is her weapon. It occurs to her that too much perfection, too much pride could be off putting to these people, but she cannot lower these weapons, especially now, just from habit. She knocks sharply. After a moment that feels all the longer for holding her breath through it, a dark haired woman of around her own age opens the door. Her eyes are keen and clever and familiar but at the same time they look – to Narcissa – quite obviously lost, like she left the house forgetting to turn something off lost.
“I propose a toast,” Draco says, chin jerked up a little pompously, but as Harry looks around the table he sees the others looking at him with faint smiles and little to no animosity and sighs a deep and happy sigh - “To the re-opening of Weasley's Wizard Wheezes, and you can bloody well let me in this time!”
He turns, grinning sheepishly, not actually letting go of Draco, never wanting to – not any more – it seems like he can't ever have enough, like it's the worst drag to ever stop touching him – now that he has finally given in to these sensations, he cannot be so harsh on himself as to deny either of them anything. Still there
“Yeah. Right. I'm real brave. Should have been a bloody Gryffindor. What next? You're going to give me the part about how my parents will miss me? Sing me another one -”
And then, all of a sudden there's a plan for the future – or the imminent future at any rate – he hadn't let himself think about it but now it's there – school and graduation and the lot of them branching off into their own couple groupings and homes. All of a sudden he sort of
“Joy,” Harry wails. “Oh look darling here's where you tried to kill me, here's where my mad Auntie tortured your best friend, and just down here are the dungeons where -”
has of the place either. He never thought his father would accept the two of them at all, and relations have always been tenuous at best and God knows he can understand Harry not having any fond memory of the place. Yes, alright, fine then, he's afraid this visit will upset him and he doesn't want that, though chances of admitting this are practically non – existent. He'll dare his own pain, but he's uncomfortable with daring Harry's. Ugh. When did he get like this?
“Take my hand?” He can feel his fingers shaking, his whole arm shaking. He can see Draco's throat move as he swallows.
been drugged. Or Draco's cursed him. Or he's cursed him to feel drugged – either way it's Draco's doing. Foul play, yeah that makes sense.
room and his chest burst and tightened repeatedly in a flurry of feelings he was not quie sure how to name. The last time he remembers thinking this was about two years ago; he can remember it exactly. Not long after his father had been sent to Azkaban and the Dark Lord appeared in their house as though taking his place. He remembers waking up one morning, as he has just woken now and then, like now, after the first few moments of neutrality, remembering where he was and what was happening in his life. Back then it had been a sick dizzying feeling of unreality, like all of this, this worry, this tension, this sudden new expectation of threat and pain – could not possibly have so suddenly replaced a life which up until then had felt entirely his own. He still remembers that gruesome realisation that all illusion he had ever had that he had any control over what happened to him was false, of knowing there was nothing he could do, no decision he could make that would be the right one.
“Chill Malfoy, I've not been being serious for the past ten minutes. Although seriously yes, my aunt probably
“She actually said that?” Draco sounds incredulous; it raises his vocal levels of posh by at least twenty percent - “Granger. She specifically and actually said
“- worked it out when I was five, yeah. That happens when they assign you the wrong gender at birth and I wouldn't say
He tries not to think about Malfoy, of course; he has spent about ten years trying not to think about Malfoy at these moments, but true to form he's there, in his head, eyes glittering with that silver which
Perhaps he hadn’t drunk that much. That would have been a good thing, wouldn’t it? Perhaps he hadn’t been too bad off, and he’d kissed Draco with some shred of his faculties still in place, and he didn’t regret it. It wasn’t like he’d stayed in bed to wallow with shame at letting
'Well, that can't be helped; he's friends with everybody,' she scorned, picking a new lock to fiddle with.
'What will you wear?' Pansy's voice had startled him. She was lounging in one of the armchairs by the fireplace, fitted in a short black dress. Her eyes were lined gloss black, a green shimmer over her eyelids; her bare legs glistened warm orange from the flames.
It couldn’t have been that much. They’d arrived at Hogsmeade at the same time, after all.Then again, Draco had seen, on the nights where he’d spied the drunk, stumbling group around Hogsmeade, that Potter had the habit of getting too enthusiastic with shots - he’d make a point of drinking one with every friend, a brief special moment with each one, the two leaning close over the bar and whispering and smiling soft smiles before returning to the crowd, and because Potter knew
‘I figured,’ she said simply. She was still not quite looking at him, instead following the busy bartender pouring beers on the other side of the bar. ‘Harry told you to do it, didn’t he?’
‘He’ll live,’ Harry snorted. He finally went down that last step. ‘Come on, before someone interrupts us again.’
‘Kind of the point, Malfoy,’ Harry huffed. He’d thrown all the glitter vials into Alicia’s bag, and was propped up on the sink again, ‘We go to a stupid party, we play stupid games. Not like we had much time to do it before.’
Harry scoffed, but he didn’t offer any retort. Instead, when he answered, his voice was a reluctant sort of resigned.
The air was cold on his skin; the weight of Harry's gaze made him want to squirm. He always wanted to
Because it was funny, wasn’t it? His entire life - the entire ordeal. Being so close to Harry after so long, being allowed to kiss yet not knowing what exactly his role was; this romance, so vague in outlines, so intense in depth - ridiculous, preposterous, fucking
And then he was walking to the Fat Lady, who looked quite affronted by the whole thing, and murmuring some word Draco couldn’t hear over the rushing of blood in his ears, and stepping through the narrow passage uncovered behind the canvas.
No, there was far too much required in bringing the cup to his lips. How pitiful he was. So hungover, and he’d left
Harry huffed. ‘You didn’t apologize to Hermione. You told me you fucking would, Malfoy. I didn’t even think you were coming tonight.’
And in it, against one of the covered walls, Harry and Neville, all close, shoulders bumping, similar, from afar, in their mop of dark hair and vulnerable smile. They held some gold-tinted glass bottle between then, and Harry's neck was stretched in an elegant line, bathed in moonlight, and he was in his slacks and white undershirt - did he
. Everything about it, from the kiss at Honeydukes to lacing his arm over Harry’s shoulders in front of his friends to pinning his hips against that filthy sink.
And she was off through one of the stone archways, no doubt heading to the Great Hall to tell her friends what a beast Draco -
Draco glanced pitifully at the dancefloor - a sea of bright spots under a dozen floating lights, a mess of bodies and movement that left him dizzy just from the sight. There was no possible way he could dance without falling over, and he’d never give Harry, nor any of his friends, that satisfaction.
At least he had this memory. Yes, everything else might come down, but there were no strings to drag this surreal moment into darkness. It would stay untethered to reality, in his mind to cherish.
Perfectly dressed for a night out. Draco was clad in his old school robes, all creased from when he'd fallen asleep while reading in the greenhouse.
‘Fuck if I know. I’ll just… toss it,’ and there was a sharp clatter as he threw the helmet inside the Potions classroom.
Harry swept the hair out of his forehead. When he laughed, it was a frustrated, disbelieving thing. Draco didn’t like it at all. ‘Is that what this is, then? You’ve got your feelings hurt, Malfoy?’
‘Oh, Merlin, you did something to me, didn’t you? Did you hex me, Potter?’ he asked, because there was something shameful in Harry’s eyes, something that told him there was
‘But how are we supposed to know we can cut back on it?’ Harry insisted. Between his fingers, the gillyweed writhed like knotted rat tails. ‘You’d bloody
Harry moved to pull off and answer, a hint of humour in his expression, but Draco stilled him with a tighter grip on his hair.
Draco kissed her cheek, primly ignored the smirk she gave him, and walked to the other table. They were all quite drunk, speaking too loudly, too incoherently, but he still felt unsure as she approached the group. They could look at him, after all, and remember all he’d been. All he still was, that they’d always hated.
In Potions, neither Harry, Hermione nor Ron showed up. Their empty seats weighed dark and grim on Draco’s conscience. Every Gryffindor in attendance was distracted and fidgety; Neville and Finnigan in particular were sending him pointed looks whenever he ventured to the supply storage.
It made him feel twistedly proud, that she and her perfectly decent but unremarkable mouth hadn't been the first to give Harry a blowjob.
An especially high-pitched yell reverberated through the place; Draco glanced down the stairs, but the dim lighting blurred everything out, and he couldn't discern what was happening through the dense, reddened atmosphere. Perhaps, he thought hopefully, it was one of Potter's friends downing her shot; perhaps they'd already finished drinking, and were now busy settling financial matters - because Draco had
George frowns, coming back to the present, remembering and adjusting to the fact that the voice in his head is just his now – only it sounds like someone else. Only someone else sounded just like him. The adjustment is jarring, practically impossible every time. So he thinks about where he is – lurking in the second floor living room, low-key taking note of what the Malfoys are up to. Which is maybe a little shiftier than what Hermione asked him to do, a little more
She's applying to the Harpies, she tells him; it's Quidditch or nothing. Do you remember that game when – by the time she's done, he's actually laughing. They'll have to fly together again some time. Dance together too – remember the Yule Ball? Yes, she went with Fred, but to be honest she lost track of which of them she danced with and when that night. She was fairly sure they were pranking her somehow, and they were, of course they were.
hear you both, you couple of absloute cunts,” Draco sighs, wondering how they ever came to this conclusion about his feelings for Potter – groaning internally because the very fact that he'd just worded it
And here he is now, a relic in a world that does not want him and in which he cannot see a place for himself. He is ready enough to change his ideas, his viewpoints if need be, because in truth he never had any beyond what was instilled into him, what he felt he needed for maximum survival and success. Cissy has told him time and again since they came here how urgently they need to change to fit this new world, but she still has not told him how. She had said, in her sadder moments, so many times, how they have failed the children, what they owe to this generation if they even
Again he doesn't hear what Blaise says next, but he sees Malfoy spin him the finger like he was born to the gesture. He is so busy staring that the Snitch almost hits him right in the face as it zooms past. As he tries to make up for his lack of concentration and heads after it, he hears the choke and scratch of the guitars tuning and the lazy, slightly discordant wail of a cello sliding in alongside it, a rather sickening heart stopping sound which sounds – well – it sounds to Harry rather like the musical rendition of a murder in a bathroom. He is torn as he flies – between the guilt he has never quite got over, and with vowing to murder Malfoy for real as soon as he is back on the ground. As if this wasn't enough, Malfoy's voice chases him through the air next, a knife cutting through the breeze with a clear bright glittering edge and a hot melting hiss in its wake.
- and it doesn't matter how sick the green lighting and the purple music makes Harry feel, his heart breaks a little and he wants to whimper
The first push is verbal, the other pushes back, neither able nor wanting to avoid the bait, even when there's real anger it's usually rather enjoyable; Draco once referred to it as Harry's
“Um -” he says, wincing at himself, half on, half off of Draco, unsure if he is still allowed to proceed, realising in that moment of uncertainty that he wants to, to kiss him, touch him, give him so much more than this aching premature ecstasy – Can I – sorry, that was -”
Draco just looks like he's trying to avoid the paparazzi at every turn, eyes averted or dazzled, meeting nobody in the eye, half frantic, on the verge of tears all the time. Harry hates the way it makes him feel, hates that he finds himself wanting to see the old sneer back, that flash of wicked mischief in the eye that used to itch so (
“Often when I go by the girls are doing this -” Viktor sighs, frowning and shaking his head - “Never have I understood.”
“Pfft -” Draco snorts - “It's no more you than this is me. You know I never looked up to you just for not dying as a baby. We're all boys who lived now.”
They lose to The Harpies pitifully that morning, and it is all, undeniably Harry's fault; what's worse is that everyone absolutely knows that it's Harry's fault, and worse
somewhat to her own surprise – interested in the unfolding Romance in this house – it's like something out of French romance, only both the protagonists are boys and therefore it's all twice as ridiculous as usual.
it is, but since you ask I can't say I haven't always felt like something was missing – I don't know – I've said this to Wendell, he says I'm just being daft but – it's like this life is a bit of a dream, isn't it? Like there's another me – or other me's out there somewhere living different versions of my life, and I don't know how I came into this one – it's like – everything around me could just shift and I'd be someone else – still me, but a me that did a lot of things differently. Maybe – like multiple reality theory, or maybe just everyone feels like this -”
Harry comes swearing, thankful it's only the shower he's making a mess of. It's never taken much, not with Malfoy.
“Hmm. But you don't really know me, do you Potter? Yes, I played, actually I always did – cello, piano, violin, harp – my family has quite the collection – then in those years -” he frowns, how did he start talking about this, how did he dare? He leans with his back to the window and looks down at his hands - “When everything fell apart – when it all changed – we couldn't have music in the house anymore –
“- yes Blaise, because obviously we will be setting fire to the entire Quidditch stadium to celebrate the school's completion, bloody brilliant!”
He tugs his sleeve down to the wrist and holds it there, spins around and marches out the room almost at a run.
He wishes he could talk quicker, that his lungs would allow him air, but he ran too fast, too breathless and Draco's lip twitches and curls -
performance that evening. There hasn't been a feeling in this room, Harry thinks, since the Yule Ball in his fourth year, a million years ago. He never expected it to ever feel like this again and it maks him smile to see the younger students chattering and laughing like he had once given up hope of seeing again at Hogwarts. After the war – after the battle of Hogwarts, after hearing the stories of kids who were first years when it happened – no, he never expected the school could go back to this again, and it makes him feel warm and complicated inside to think that a lot of it tonight is down to Draco. Someone shouts his name and he turns around.
“Yes I suppose she is also – what is the word – insidious? That is maybe not the word. Never mind. No. She is hugging her sister. It is all tres dramatique -” she rolls her eyes, not disapprovingly. An English person could never pull the expression off.
it, whatever it was. She cradles him when he starts to cry messily, but quietly, shaking so fiercely she fears for him; he's so thin these days. She wishes he did not cry so silently, that he never had to learn how, but at least he's crying now, after the past few weeks perhaps it's something.
He stomps off down the corridor at a walk so fast it is almost a run, looking around him for a room that nobody else is in but suddenly it seems as though there are people
“You both went back to Malfoy Manor, didn't you? You had sex and then Draco got arsey about it because he's afraid of how much he loves you and it was too much too fast, too close, too intimate so he lashed out at you to protect his own feelings because he's terrified. He's been being told he's weak and useless for two years. Voldemort Crucioed it right into him after he didn't kill Dumbledore so he can't just
, all yellows and reds and gold, the music and the lights. At the end, just when everyone else is gasping because the flame snake is convincing enough to frighten a lot of the audience, the effect is ruined – at least for Harry and Pansy beside him- by a voice behind them and a hand on each of their shoulders and they both turn to see Blaise who's grinning and nodding -
The way he tells it has Pansy laughing her arse off – always a jarring unpleasant sound, even to those who know and love her, and yet it can be oddly infectious at the same time; even Blaise is smirking which for Blaise is a bloody belly laugh. The way he tells it lets him almost ignore some of the more awkward aspects of what he was feeling at the time – because there's no getting away now from the sight of a damn half naked Potter, with a flushed, slightly glowing post orgasm face – or the reaction in Draco that he thinks he may have stifled quite manfully. He suspects it's a sight he'll be thinking about later, without the hiliarity with which this retelling has been imbued.
He sees Hermione close her books, asking Luna if she's got this now – and Luna has – before hugging Narcissa Malfoy, appraising the others with a nod and going home with her parents, taking Ron with her, introducing him to the family for the first time as he goes to spend time with them; in return, she says, for all the time she has spent at the Burrow. He sees Draco snort a laugh at he expression on his mother's face when the girl hugs her, and he sees the wry smile Narcissa makes when Hermione's back is turned. He sees Hermione shake hands awkwardly with Draco before sighing and just enveloping him and Harry both in one simultaneous hug. She comes back every couple of days now to visit, bringing things for the house and for them all, smiling with a flush in her cheeks for the first time since the war.
idiot,” Draco finishes, and dips in to kiss him, and it feels to Harry like magic, like he has waited all his life to be kissed like this, like it's the fairytale he never ever thought could come true. He feels clumsy in response, clutching back needily; a part of him wants to keep talking now, to actually tell Draco how beautiful he is, how exquisite – how touching him feels like getting his hands on something desperately precious, something he could never possibly deserve. He can't tell him that, not just yet; Draco would be insufferable if he did. Instead he whispers between kisses -
She feels humbled, asking this girl's advice, but it occurs to her that pragmatism suggests she take it. The girl is clever, clear headed – more or less -and she knows Potter. However well she herself is able to appear detached, she is far too biased to consider both boys dispassionately. There are cracks in her heart she can only stitch together with will power and self control, stitches which strain every time her baby shivers and shakes on her with nightmares. She is holding so much of his grief inside her chest there is no room to be as objective as she would like. It occurs to her that this girl, however well balanced she appears, can only be suppressing griefs of her own in whichever way she does it, and it occurs to her like a sudden revelation what griefs the greatest of those must be. She has to test to see if she is correct.
"Thank goodness you noticed it too, he didn't want to believe me". Now they were laughing together. It was nice to laugh, it made Harry feel free.
"Shut up! It's Perfect! The professor said it's Perfect!" He was so happy that he wanted to yell at the whole school. but he told Harry. He was more important than the whole school.
"No, I mean, what do you know about my necessities? Go back to sleep" Harry felt a tone of remorse in his voice... Anyway, he returned to sleep and with him returned the night demons, too.
"Potter! Open your eyes! I'm here, I'm Draco. Please, Potter, breathe with me, it was just a dream!" Harry woke up, but he still was in his nightmare... He still couldn't breathe...
"You know what? I think so. I’ve been a coward for too long. I’ve made the wrong choices for too long. I want to offer freedom to people like me."
"For one thing that I said the first night... She bring every night a different guy" Hermione was near hysteria. She couldn't read in peace... Because of the noise. She couldn't bring Ron, she couldn't stay alone in her room because of the the mess that Pansy made. "Such a messy girl" she hissed.
"It was Pansy" Said Draco "Granger, it's her! Run!" They ran out of the chamber and went to the girls' room. They entered and saw Hermione, shaken by constant chills, in Pansy’s arms. Slowly all the others came. This scene That scene reminded them of memories they hoped they’d buried. Agreeing that they wouldn't have sleep no more that night, they all went to common room, looking at the flame and thinking at their past. How many wounds, how much pain. In the air their suffering was palpable. That pain would have devoured them, if they had let their guard down for even a second...
While they were talking Draco came downstairs "Hi, sorry, I have to go to Theo and Pansy's house, she need my help with the baby, she is so tired"
Draco was almost scared by all that things Harry said. If he only knew... But it wasn't too late. He could still do the right thing.
But Harry didn't hear nothing anymore. He was distracted by him. He had a dark blue dress, wonderful with his complexion. He felt himself blushing, so he immediately lowered his gaze and wishpered "Give me your wrist, I'll help you."
"I knew it! I am so proud of you." He smiled, it made him happy to see Draco, only a part of him was enough.
They laughed and then they went to sleep. 'Yeah', thought Harry, 'How we ended up being friend just now?'.
"Before the selection, I want to warn you about a few things" He started "Quidditch is not an easy game, is a game of strategy, but also dangerous. Above it all is a teamwork. So if you're not interested in any of this, please leave now"
"Potter?" It was Draco's voice. He noticed that he was staring at his bed. Shame flicked over him and he blushed violently. After this, he decided to go to bed.
"we have to represent the union of the houses." finished Hermione, who, as always, had already understand.
"Scorpius, please! You have to choose one shirt! Then you can see Hugo and Rose." Harry begged him "Draco, help your child choose the color of the shirt"
That was Harry's best Christmas, used to having no one but Ron and Hermione. Blaise's home was very beautiful: the entrance was spacious and bright and opened onto a large living room, with elegant colours, enhanced by Christmas decorations. On the right there was a black marble staircase leading to the rooms. Single or double, each one had a dominant color and all overlooked the magnificent garden, the fountain and the many colored flower beds. They spent the days that separated them from Christmas, staying at home, enjoying the beautiful house, or going out, to drink a Butterbeer or, for girls, go shopping. On Christmas Eve, they had lunch early and soon after the girls went to get ready, which caused the shock of the boys, that followed them only 3 hours later.
"Yes, very good at spoiling potions. On the other hand, 'you have come to Howgarts in possession of abilities so formidable that you feel confident enough to not pay attention'." Draco made such a perfect imitation of Snape that Harry relived that moment. If he thought about it now it was nothing, but he had felt so embarrassed that day. he just wanted to disappear under his invisibility cloack.
"Draco?" Called Harry. Because he didn't answered, he tore the book out of his hand. Malfoy, trying to get it back, jumped on him, knocking him off the couch, so they ended up on top of each other.
"Exactly, Miss Granger. The couples are Granger-Parkinson, Abbot-Lovegood, Weasley-Zabini, Finnigan-Nott, Thomas-McDougal, Longbottom-Finch-Fletchley and-"
Evryone now was looking at her. She did what everyone didn't have enough courage to do. She revealed the truth.
"There are so many Nargles in this train" said Luna, worried "I go to clean this coach, we will see at Hogwarts" and she disappeared.
From his voice Harry understood that he couldn’t take it anymore, he was tired, so he tried patiently "It’s not pity, it’s kindness." He was sick of being painted as the "Savior" (which he actually was). "But, do what do you want, take a low grade". Even that didn’t work, so he decided to go to sleep and let it go.
get chosen for something and it turned out to be awful so maybe you should cut him a bit of slack for being a teensy bit reactive after some really good sex. It was probably very emotional too.”
“Seriously -” he sighs, trying not to sound as nervous as he might feel - “You know where his little friends go, Potter's never far behind – I don't -”
that hardness will have to be harshness, that he could only lash out and hurt, be a weapon, a knife's edge, cutting and caustic as he has so often been. It is an easy default away from pain. He knows the moron's contemplating the bloody moral highground or something, and
” Blaise sighs - “Everyone else may have thought you were being edgy and cool when you talked about jumping off the Astronomy tower all those bloody years ago, but some of us know what those thoughts look like. I've got eyes Draco, please be kind – to me if you can't be to yourself.”
is transformed in Harry's head into a crashing rainbow paint splash of colour. And in the middle of all that colour is Draco, the one thing that has always both kept him grounded and made him fly, ivory and gold in the middle of all that colour.
“I haven't told anyone about that,” he adds - “Mother would probably just cry and I've had just about everyone's tears so many times I'll drown if I get any more. Don't tell anyone?” He starts swearing a great long internal stream of bad words – did he just
anyway, is it? He ignores the voice in his head which asks him this. Thankfully the idiot moves in at him and when he falls back on the bed it is breathlessly, his skin drinking in the way Harry's eyes eat him up – and he had been so afraid of being eaten before. He had been afraid to even eat – to taste – but these kisses make him angry, ravenous, reaching for more with teeth and tongue and Harry has him pinned down like prey, pushing against him, Draco's wrists in hands that feel like they could break him any minute. The grip hurts just enough to be good and he snarls and the curl of his own lip feels good as well, Harry's lips chasing down his sneer.
“Do you think not? Alright -” Narcissa nods internally and pulls her resolutions together tightly - “I'm going to tell you something, Miss Granger, and I'd respect your opinion on the matter. You see the truth is that ever since first year, your friend Mr Potter has been just about the only thing my son has talked about. He pretends otherwise of course, but that gives me all the more reason to suspect -”
First they find the bedroom, where Harry lies face down across the bed, wailing with his head in a pillow.
“I think I always have. It was- I mean, I tried not to and I did hate you, I suppose I still do but – well – it was always you, wasn't it? It was always going to be you. You're the only one who makes me feel – like me – just me. Not a saviour. Not the chosen one. Just Harry stupid Potter and I want that. I want
The only thing he had stopped to question the whole time was The Dark Lord's request for him to rejoin them. He hadn't wanted that, he
“Because it's Potter, right? Because you've loved him and hated him since fucking first year and you want this but you're also confused, right?”
been fucking all summer and we should say it. I for one -” he jerks his chin defiantly - “Have been fucking Harry Potter on a frequent basis, and I'm not afraid to say it.”
you prat, I didn't – I was worried about going back – I didn't want to tell you because you weren't -”
he's going this time, for the way he gives Harry the filthiest once-over he might ever have been subjected to, a full head to toe raking that makes him feel like he needn't even have bothered with the towel.
He doesn't mean to snap, it's just the relief of actually being able to talk about it coupled with the awareness that it
“Completely,” he says, then he meets her eye and his lip quivers at the concern he finds there and they're suddenly hugging fiercely.
But he does go. He takes Ron, and somehow or other Draco. Draco used to be banned from the shop on principle and so, he says, sticking his nose in the air in his old way – it's about time, don't you think? The shop is dark when they arrive, and even the three of them casting
“Only – eight years, you wanker. Does that mean -” He half smiles, a wry little twist of the mouth - “Do
And then, somehow it hadn't turned out that way. He hardly knew what had happened, but somehow or other Potter, the
“As opposed to what? Being put up on a stage so I can just stand there and have people behold my glory?”
It's fine, it's almost their love language; he realised long ago that it always had been. More often than not it goes in very pleasing directions or ends up subsiding into low key banter and more or less friendly insult. But sometimes it doesn't, and on those times the usual constant is that Draco lashes out at himself before Harry can lash back at him in a way that would have been far more harmless.
He grins, running across the grass, windswept and elated, to Draco who simply stands there smiling at him and reaching out a hand – his version of outstretched arms.
When it finishes he buries his face self consciously in the back of Potter's neck, he can feel his breathing almost asleep though he smiles and murmurs -
“It was just the place -” he says, realising it finally, even after trying to tell himself so many times already - “Last night – it wasn't me, it was just the place.”
sound that should not have been even faintly sexy but shoots an arrow of pleasure through Draco's chest as Harry comes hard and helpess, grinding down on him until Draco can feel the damp of it seeping through the layers and Harry wriggles out of his clothes in disgust.
“I mean – an air of elegance, and his striking me as easily controlled were not irrelevant points in the decision to actually marry, but in the initial stages -”
led to weakness so often as to be barely sought after. Tenderness, too, had always been his downfall, first with Cissy and then Draco. Draco – if he is honest with himself, and circumstances force him to be – had never been the son he had really hoped for, so carefree and happy as a child, always more mischievous than truly cunning – he had feared for years that the boy wouldn't even make Slytherin, instilling into him – as his father had with him – the disappointment and recriminations that would come if he did not. In truth, the boy was so close to his mother, so hard working in his early studies, so gentle to the peacocks, crying when they pecked his hand too hard when he held it out timorously with seeds – he had been terrified of having spawned a Hufflepuff. And yet – yet he thinks about that boy, that smiling, mercurial, sunshine child so quick to both tears or laughter and something clenches hard inside his chest that he knew he should have long ago stopped from being able to clench.
to me, then I turn round from practise and you're standing under the stage gawping up at me like you're waiting for another Snitch to fly into your mouth, and now you're poorly impersonating a Victorian invalid. I say again, are you quite well?”
“Yeah. Okay. Right Potter. I just came up here for a quiet bloody picnic- now piss off, you're not invited.”
But as he had approached the stand Draco had flashed him a lock of such narrow eyed bitterness that he had stopped still – stopped for long enough for Draco and his father to take off out of the court room without another word while Narcissa alone of the family, inclined her head to him and gave a dignified,
The words are out of him before he can stop them. He feels like he has just thrown up all over Potter's feet. The other boy looks at him almost as though he has. His face goes through a dance of expressions that might have been funny under other circumstances.
He wants to smash his face into the mirror, cut off his arm with shards of glass, break his own wand and forget every unforgiveable curse, give up and see what happens -
“May I speak with you?” It feels awkward and she knows it just comes out snooty. Still, she knew this would not be easy. What is, these days.
people and lets himself sneer, lip curling comfortingly. Staring at nothing is good, turning himself off is good, just like his mother taught him, and aunt Bella;
“It's like drunk only with drugs,” Blaise sighs, watching him with a minute frown from what seems to have become his armchair.
“Draco I swear I – it's always been you, forgive me, I'm sorry, I've been so stupid – nobody's -” he wants to say
for all you seem to think it's easy. He thinks that it's a weakness to love, especially when it's you because he looks up to you so much – I think he kind of wanted to be you, and then he wanted to be your friend and -”
“You still haven't told me what you thought,” Draco turns his head aside, after a long sweet luxurious age of kissing. Harry whines and nudges his face towards him, clutching needily -
“It's – what I do Harry,” she laughs back, kindly, the first time he's ever heard her do that - “Get used to it – go on, piss off!”
“Two years ago -” Luna is saying and he's trying to listen, he really is - “Back when we were all working out what we wanted to do with our lives, because – they have to go on don't they, after everything – Draco started playing violin – piano – cello – they have quite the collection at the Manor, you know – I think he did it to drown the thoughts out really, because – well it's harder to listen to the voices in your head when there's music playing, isn't it? Somehow or other he came to get heard, then when Blaise took over from Pansy as his manager he sort of fell into Wizard – Glam Rock and the image became as much a thing as the music. If you're trying that hard to look like something – well you become it a bit, don't you – everything Draco was trying to forget; it's easier under that much make up and costume.”
we had to get moving sooner,” Pansy grumbles, still dithering by the standing stones, waiting for Draco - “I can see bloody Weasley now and I don't think we can get away – who's that he's with?” she peers against the glare of the sun upwards towards the castle - “Ohhh -” she breathes -
“Good, so I was talking to some people and basically – long story short – Andromeda's bringing Teddy tomorrow, and she's said she'll see you if you'll see her.”
It makes no sense, Potter didn't want him there, probably doesn't want him in his house at all, connot stop looking at him with that murderous look in half black eyes - so why follow him? His nostrils flare and he steps forward, right into Draco's personal space, his fists clench.
for his beauty from that angle, can hardly believe his own fingers as they slip inside of Draco, Draco moaning shamelessly into the cool night air and pushing back and whispering some kind of spell and urging Harry to
Draco, cock screaming at him to be next, trying not to imagine how that hot tightness will feel too much or he fears he might never make it in. He can see Draco's hands clench the sheets, knuckles white, his back arched, head dipped down, every sharp line of him taut with effort and pleasure and pain. A crazy, self destructive urge to tell him he loves him dives into his head so he swears instead, knowing that those words have the power to ruin everything right now.
She throws him a look over her shoulder that makes him wonder if she was speaking literally about this actual current closet or if there was a metaphorical closet hidden somewhere in her implication. He groans, rolls his head back with a crack and walks out into the hall. In the room across he sees Hermione talking quietly to George who looks up as Harry passes with what is becoming the familiar only – half – there look, nodding and murmuring -
If he looks at him like that one second more he is actually going to run away. He can see his lips move and they're going to say something fucking kind, ask him if he's alright (ha), if he can help (ha), even if god help him there's Anything Wrong At Home (ha ha fucking ha). But at the last minute he seems to change his mind, he loosens his grip on Draco's neck and his other hand from his suddenly wildly trembling arm and nods stubbornly, like he has decided (thank god?) to take this as a challenge.
It was a beautiful April morning and, disappointing Hermione who wanted to study, they went out for a walk.
"You were soffocating... Don't you dare do this again, don't die, please" He whispered to him, lying his hand on his cheek, to assure him that he wasn't alone? To make him feel safe? Harry didn't know, but it was working, like he was with Ron or Hermione.
"He’s just acting mature, unlike Parkinson" Hermione had convinced Ron, enough to makw him change the subject "If you say so".
"I have nightmares every night" He was the first with whom he talked to about it in months, sure that he would regret this.
"Who do you think might be back this year?" Ron asked to Neville, the only one there that was returned the previous year.
"Well, I think you have finally understand the subtle science and exact art the dispersion making" He announced.
"I know, mate. Don't warry, I was just thought about when Ginny will found out" He smiled at him. A smile that said 'okay', a smile that allowed Harry to breathe again.
"What do you do on you free time? I mean, when you don't read?" Pansy domanded, pretending to be interested.
Harry closed his eyes and sighed "Yes, it does. Sorry, I have to go" He freed himself from Draco's grip and ran away.
"I'll try" Seeing him still upset, he tried to reassure him "Calm down, I'm alive" He said, though he liked that version of Malfoy.
Hermione look at him and then at Ron. Harry wondered if she already knew something about this. "Harry, I knew it. I mean, not for sure, but I had my suspicions. Anyway, I love you and I'll forever."
By the time, he saw Hannah and Luna: the Ravenclaw girl was about to say something when Hannah preceded her "Let me, Narvles?"
After a few moment they burst out laughing. It was the best time he had shared with his friends, finally free.
"There were a lot of Slytherins, some Ravenclaw and one or two Hufflepuff. I heard that many of them went to Beauxbatons and someone to Durmstrang... So I don't know for sure" he conclused.
Before they went to the common room, Draco looked at him and wishpererd "Do I have sex hair?" with a worried face.
He started run. He couldn't believe how fool he was, how could he forget something SO important? He ran and ran... He lost his breath, but he had to resist, he had to see him (alive or dead wasn't important). Everything was clear now 'In the hope you understand'... Incredibly, Ron was right.
That night Harry was wearing an elegant dark green velvet suit, that highlighted his eyes. When he was ready, he left the room, but instead of going downstairs, he knocked on Draco’s door, because, since that night at Hogwarts, he was avoiding him. That silence was killing him. Hermione gave them suspicious looks, like the rest of the girls, even Luna, the most discreet. He didn't understand why he was so attracted to him. Hermione had suggested that it was the proximity to Draco and that, however, he had to solve these thins alone, because there was no book that could help him. She kept telling him that they wouldn’t care, but Harry’s problem was figuring out what she was talking about (even Ron didn’t seem to understand it, judging by the fact that he looked at her like she was an alien). Was it possible that he liked Draco? 'It must have been the moment', he repeated himself... but there was something...
