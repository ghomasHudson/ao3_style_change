Pansy smirks into her tea. “Blaise and I have come to a bit of an agreement. I like women and he likes women. I’m sure you can figure out the rest.”
He lets Harry check his hands for any stray cuts as Draco settles his head in his lap, but he knows he won’t find anything. Draco made sure to heal everything before he came over. Merlin knows he would have kittens if he had seen the deep puncture wounds the glass left behind.
From the evening darkness, the glowing sign of The Red Lion greets them as they walk towards the building. Draco wrinkles his nose. The logo on the flag outside looks far too much like the Gryffindor emblem for his tastes. Merlin, why did he think to go here of all places?
“The big deal,” Draco spits, “Is that it is a ludicrous question! Why are you asking children these types of questions Potter?”
He’ll just have to switch schools, that’s all. Maybe even switch cities too. He can speak Spanish. Barcelona is looking beautiful this time of year…
Harry’s mouth flies open in rage. “Some bloke didn’t hurt you did he? Tell me his name Malfoy and I swear I’ll—”
He almost cries in relief when Potter appears with his youngest in tow. Albus had a weird way of making grown men nervous with his blunt outspokenness. Draco was used to his son’s softer voice and Charm School manners, not
She isn’t exactly the devilish, emotionless figure from his tainted memories. Nor is she the same, easy-going woman she was those years before Scorpius was born and when she served as the only remedy for Draco’s misdirected anger at the world. They were no longer those people, so he can’t expect her to act like that woman anymore either.
Though whatever the case may be, no one can deny that it had been a blissfully quiet Malfoy-free week at Hogwarts. But of course, like all good things, this too would come to an end. Malfoy may be sour git most of the time, but he did have friends who probably missed him, not to mention what now must be a fat stack of classwork that needed to be completed. So Harry mentally prepared himself for the day that Draco Malfoy would waltz into his life once again.
“You’re probably right, but that still won’t stop me from asking though. I mean it when I say you’re my friend Malfoy. Friends don’t let other friends suffer in silence.”
The Floo roars to life and Blaise’s face appears in the flames. “What?” The question comes out far harsher than he intended.
He takes it with careful fingers, opening up the envelope all rejections and approvals are sealed in.
Draco’s face burns. He hates being laughed at for his irrationalities. In his head, his worries were completely justified.
Sometimes, it feels like he hasn’t got much of his sanity left and Potter’s dangling the little bit he does have in his face with his smirking.
“Are you wanking? Really Potter?” He rolls over on the bed, glancing curiously at the sharp tugs of Harry’s hand under the comforter before turning away, scowling into his pillow. Fucking Gryffindors.
Harry impulsively snatches the half cut orange off of Ron’s plate right when Malfoy’s blood red lips are beginning to wrap around the food.
“Just go with it,” Potter replies through an equally clenched smile. He claps Draco on the shoulder twice as if they were good friends and not childhood nemeses. Good grief did Potter have an arm on him. Draco flexes his shoulder when Potter’s not looking. “Everyone, this Draco Malfoy.”
“So I saw.” She hums appreciatively at the circling figure in the sky. “Malfoy looks good, don’t you think?” Harry turns his head sharp to the side at her observation, wondering if he was having a fever dream. There was no way that Ginny was commenting on how bloody good Malfoy looked.
“Seriously Draco, are you okay there?” Blaise asks again. His face is marked with a serious bout of concern for merely a second before morphing into an upturned smile. “You’re looking a little
Harry’s lips are on Draco’s the minute they return to Gryffindor tower, his hands sneaking up Draco’s waist and clinging to the tips of his hair. Per Harry’s request, Draco left it down for the ball, letting it fall just the way he liked it. If nothing else, he will miss the hair once Draco returns back to his former gender. Maybe he could be persuaded to grow it out. With enough blowjobs and shagging, he’s sure he could manage.
But he’s not too old to pound his foot into the ground when he wasn’t getting his way. Or tug on Harry’s hand until he finally gives in.
He can’t get enough of it, personally. Everything makes sense on this wall; his research, his son’s needs, his life. It was the most brilliant thing he had invented to date and probably the one place that he knows has all of the answers.
He may be right. The most hated statements are usually embedded with truths, his mother says. He may never be as vulnerable or as empathetic or as brave as Harry deserves.
“Good afternoon everyone,” Harry says with that same disarmingly charming smile of his. Draco forces down a grin. Very fit indeed. “As you all know, the school will be holding its annual anti-bullying campaign next week. Areum, why don’t you share the ideas you sent me for the event?”
Malfoy blinks at him, looking surprised, then perplexed as to why Harry felt compelled to offer him any words of encouragement. There’s a moment, where the only sound between them is the whistle of the brisk wind as it cuts through the tree branches.
Harry agrees too because before he even has a chance to bring this up, both Draco and Scorpius each have a dresser of their own.
He jumps in fright, gripping his wand with shaking hands. Harry pulls off the cloak and reveals himself with his hands up. “Easy, I come in peace,” he says, waving his empty palms in the air.
With a flick of his wand, he sends the papers that he and Astoria both signed months ago over to Finley’s lap, not moving an inch from his spot away from the table. He glances over the papers, snapping the documents as he turns it from front to back, his jaw hardening with ire underneath the horrendous white sideburns.
The next week, Draco’s in the middle of his soon-to-be-rejected research presentation when he randomly wonders if he should have just sold it to her in the first place. He tells her this over tea and she laughs until her voice is hoarse, asking him what kind of Slytherin doesn’t think of using those closest to them to get what they want?
Draco narrows his eyes, the weight of repressed childhood memories returning to his mind in an unforgiving rush.
Malfoy rolls his eyes before throwing the thick blanket back over his head, his long silver tresses fanned out on the pillowcases. “I hate her.”
Throughout class, Harry’s eyes continually dart over to Malfoy. The blonde was struggling to keep up, lazily flicking his wand when McGonagall instructs so, but otherwise keeping his head buried in his notes or his arms. He lets out small whimpers of pain every so often and clutches his midsection with a tiny groan.
Draco wills the heat crawling up his cheeks to leave. “Happy is a strong word…” Scorpius looks unconvinced. “It doesn’t matter much does it? Potter’s not interested and I have to respect that. I’m not either by the way.” He adds the last bit quickly, looking away as he does.
Draco waits until he’s seated next to Harry, who looks surprised by his willingness to sit so close to him amongst a sea of open seats. Jaspers doesn’t even look in his direction, his bright eyes focused directly on Draco. He sighs.
Harry digs his foot into the dusty ground, biting the inside of his cheek to avoid speaking. He was itching to do so, Draco could tell. Harry Potter could be blunt to a fault—hiding his feelings was never the greatest skill of his. There was only ten minutes left before the Hogwarts Express shipped James away for the rest of the term and Draco knew Harry was not one to let precious minutes slip by.
“You’ve always loved getting under my skin.” A quip about Harry getting inside his skin is on his lips when strong hands straddle his waist and finally gives him what he’s been aching for ever since Boot interrupted them. “I’ve always hated that about you.”
“Apologies. Like I was saying what I am about to do is mimic the gravitational pull of a Full Moon in this room.” He takes a deep breath, carefully casting the same spell he always does.
“Stay there.” He doesn’t need to tell him. Grabbing the wood self holding ladder, Draco places it up to the hidden fixture in the ceiling. He looks back every so often as he grabs a bottle of wine and a blanket, just to reassure himself that Harry was really there, in his office staring up at his constellation like it was Godric Gryffindor himself.
He pinches his nose to reduce the stinging but it doesn’t help because his entire body feels like someone set him on fire.
Potter laughs, the low rumbling pleasant amidst the soft snores of the tiny humans around them. “Sure,” he repeats drily, sounding as if he doesn’t even feel the need to argue with him over a pointless observation.
But nothing. There’s literally nothing. His mind is making him search for something he can’t find, per usual.
Yet, deep down he knows she wouldn’t say anything. Now if it had been Kacia… Draco may have had to try his hand at Obliviating a Muggle.
He always seems to have losing numbers when it comes to Harry Potter. While everyone sits, listening intently to Potter about the outline for this year’s PTA group, Draco plans a discreet escape from this Potter-led hell. He refuses to be another one of the Savior’s mindless minions.
Ginny comes out first, shaking bits of Floo dust out of her clothes and hair. Followed by her is a carbon copy of a 13 year old Harry so identical, Draco has to blink several times just to make sure he wasn’t going mad.
Albus says something that he can’t hear and Draco shifts a bit closer. He can’t use magic to get a better listen because Scorpius has always been oddly sensitive to magic and could feel it from a kilometer away.
“You know, I was actually scared you were going to be disappointed and that you wouldn’t want me once the spell wore off.” Harry opens his mouth to protest and Draco places a finger over his lips. “Hush, I’m not finished. I thought you wouldn’t want me anymore and I was scared that you would realize that you actually don’t like guys.”
“I know. Still no. James doesn’t need to know that, besides, it’s behind me now and it’ll just end up sounding like an excuse. It
He’s taken aback by the Muggle movie reference. “How do you know—you know what? Never mind. Just, thanks, Parkinson.”
As if reading his thoughts, Potter’s eyes widen and he quickly gulps down the last bit of tea in his cup. “No! Not like that, it’s just… he found out that I’m thinking about assigning a book about constellations and he found out that your name is one. You and Scorpius just have interesting names to him.”
Draco gives him a thin smile, holding up the pink and black rolled food in between his chopsticks. “Sushi,” he agrees.
Malfoy quietly groans and slugs his bag over his shoulder. He shoots Harry an annoyed glance and he suddenly remembers that he was about to interfere in a private conversation. He takes the hint and hastily ducks out of the classroom.
Draco believed that he had matured enough in his 31 years to admit when he was wrong. So he’ll admit that he was very, very wrong about today.
Feeling like a naughty student put on the spot, Draco snaps his back straight and manages to make his way next to Potter on shaking legs.
Draco takes a sniff of Harry’s lemonade. Nothing smelled out of the ordinary, but then again, if George had spiked with Veritaserum, or something similar, there shouldn’t be anything unusual about the drink’s odor. He watches with careful eyes as Molly and Arthur throw blunt words at each other about each other's odor.
His son only rolled his eyes, his shoulders sagging slightly in exasperation. He’s heard this a million times, but it won’t hurt to hear it once more. “I won’t Dad. Bye.” With a pointed look, he turned towards the sea of students only for him to still be connected to Draco’s hand. Scorpius tugs again, nearly falling onto the gravel path when Draco still refuses to let go. He still had more to say goddammit and he wasn’t leaving until he got it all out.
Draco snorts under his breath and gives Albus a secretive wink. “Later,” he promises. Potter’s face screws upwards. He may not have been able to beat him to the Snitch, but he could defy his authority as a parent.
This was her chance, her last one at that. After this, he won’t give her the benefit of the doubt again.
with Malfoy?” Ginny throws her head back and sighs, small huffs of laughter pushing past her cherry blossom pink lips. “You would think after two attempts you wouldn’t be so painfully oblivious to the truth.”
He’s gone to see him each day since he first went to Slytherin. The second day Malfoy gratefully accepted the plate of sweets and homework Harry brought and proceeded to talk his ear off about the empirical imbalances of Knotgrass and how magically unstable the plant was as a potion ingredient. Harry tried his best to follow along, nodding at the right moments and wondering why Malfoy had started talking about this in the first place. He just barely managed not to snicker under his breath when his brain constantly reminded him that Draco Malfoy was, in fact, a massive nerd underneath his obnoxious persona.
Clearing his throat, Draco looks at Harry from the corner of his eye, “Excuse me? Meet?” A group of schoolchildren breezes past them on bicycles, laughing with crinkled eyes. “Harry?”
“As unlovely as this sudden meeting was, I do need to return to work. See to it that your son doesn’t fall from another high structure again.” Potter laughs, his breath fogging the glass of the window.
“Scorpius, what would you think if I did this?” He holds the pamphlet up for him to read, making sure to note if Scorpius has to squint to read the text only a few feet away. For all the time he’s made fun of Potter’s thick-rimmed glasses, his own son seems to need them now. “Answer honestly… and chew your food first.”
The man has been stuck to him like glue ever since he Draco first came into the department to present. Draco doesn’t quite know why either, except for maybe because they’re the only two researchers who have consistently been rejected each time they propose their research to the board. For most people, their trip to the Astrology and Astronomy department is a quick one, but not for them.
So Harry’s more experienced than Draco is, even though he’s spent the last decade with a woman. He doesn’t judge or mock him. When Draco asked for him to show him what he liked, he does, taking his hand and placing it here, nudging him there, petting his hair when he does something he likes and tugging when he doesn’t.
He’s not much interested in them as he is in Harry. Harry, with his simple white cotton t-shirt that looked sinfully delicious against his brown skin and defined biceps. He was talking with his arms again, and it was all Draco could do not to pounce on him from the back of the room. Stupid Potter was doing this on purpose, even winking at him on occasion when he thinks he can get away with it. Kacia sighs a little next to him, but she’s learned her lesson, keeping her thin mouth shut each time it happens.
Satisfied that Draco wasn’t about to pry into the gritty details of his and Pansy’s polygamous sexual endeavors, Blaise sits back in his seat, taking a sip of his glass. “Shoot.”
So when Draco’s lips find themselves pressed against Harry’s, he’s not surprised to find the unyielding urge tamed at once. However, he is surprised to feel the heat coiling in the pit of his stomach burning in a Harry Potter induced scorching inferno. He finds what he’s been needing in Harry’s mouth.
Malfoy stumbles into Transfiguration, five minutes late and uncaring when Professor McGonagall scolds him for his tardiness. He takes the only available seat next to Ron and slumps down into it, his face buried in his arms the moment he takes out the appropriate materials for the day's class from his bag.
“I asked what your research was about,” Hermione asks in an overly patient tone. Bloody fuck she was too good at reading people. “Harry says you’re an astronomer.”
His mother had told him to either do something about Potter or leave him be. So Draco, as the natural enemy of Harry Potter and hater of all people that hail from House Gryffindor, decided simply to best him in everything. That included beating him in ridiculous PTA events like the annual biscuit sale.
Nervous fear flashes past Harry’s face for several moments before he finally says in a single breath, “I want you to have dinner with Ron, Hermione, and I.”
Finley glances at Astoria from the corner of his eye, breaking the stare down they were engaging in. Draco feels his lips curl upwards into a tiny smirk. “Is this true?”
Harry feels bad for him. If he weren’t so high up he would have placed a comforting hand on his shoulder or thigh. “And your crush?”
Potter rolls his eyes. “Well, here’s something that might pique your interest. Look at that.” He points to the winter horizon just as they reach the top of the circular ride.
Harry runs a hair through his hair again, this time tugging at the short ends. Biting the inside of his red cheek, he says, “I never really know what to say to you Draco. Honestly.” Draco’s mouth twitches. That wasn’t what he was expecting to hear. “I tried, I really did, but I’m not the best with words.”
reason—” Then she gasps, her blue eyes widening. Kacia leans forward to them and whispers harshly, “Oh my, you don’t think he’s one of those…” she looks around, “
He begins to softly mouth the incantation under his breath, his unblinking stare focused directly on Burns. Careful not to make the change too noticeable, he goes as slow as he can bear, stopping only when his mission is complete.
If he’s being honest, something about the dark, bruising circles under her eyes and the directionless air about her chills him to the bone. That could be him. If he keeps pushing away everyone’s advice and his options, he would be doomed to dig himself out a hole just like she was.
He lets him guide them along to a massive, circular room with rows of seats. A crowd of what has to be at least two hundred people are already in the room by the time they find their seats.
With that, she disappears into the crowd of leaving family members, leaving behind Draco and his new family.
“For Merlin’s sake Malfoy, can’t you get control of that thing?” Harry hisses, looking around to make sure Snape didn’t hear him.
“Oh and Potter!” Malfoy calls out. Harry looks behind him, using every bit of strength that wasn’t sucked out from the Doxycide to not hex the prat six ways to Sunday. Malfoy gives him a sly smile. “Snape told me to tell you not to leave until there is not a single hint of Doxycide smell in that cauldron.” He wiggles his fingers. “See ya at the game Potter! I’ll make sure to wear my Potter Stinks badge just for you.”
Their bickering comes to halt when McGonagall slams her hand on the table so hard Harry swears he sees dust rise from the wood. The sound rattles around them like the vibrations of a rung bell. “This animosity between you two must come to an end. You are two Eighth Years fighting like Kneazles and Crups.” She turns to Harry, her thin mouth tightened into a small ball. “Mr. Potter, you shall serve detention for the next two weeks with Professor Snape for your carelessness. As you should know by now Potions is a very dangerous subject and must be handled diligently.”
is here,” he leers. He sways side to side as he eyes him. Weird. Potter doesn’t flinch at the title like he used to. “What heroic acts were you planning on committing now Auror Potter?” He spits out the words with acidic vitriol.
He’s in front of the room, somehow making it without tripping over the cramped desk legs and bookbags on the floor. Scorpius pushes his glasses on his nose, smiling and giving him a thumbs up as encouragement.
Weasley and Granger, or he supposes he should just call them Ron and Hermione since they were both technically Weasleys now, are exactly like he imagined that they would be as adults. Still a piggish eater and an annoying encyclopedia of information.
“Of course I have. While I will not be joining you on the bisexual train anytime soon, it was rather enjoyable.” He laughs to himself. “It was the first thing I did after I pounced on you in that corridor.” Twirling a lock of hair in his fingers, he sighs contently. “Bullying you truly does do wonders for my pleasure.”
Malfoy drawled on, unaffected by Harry’s vow to silence. “You know what I hate the most? Besides bullheaded Gryffindors of course.” Harry remains silent, refusing to let his resolve break. “I tell you. Doxies. Nasty, ugly little buggers they are. If I could personally exterminate them all, I absolutely would.”
“I was actually going to say that you look pansexual.” He gives him a goofy sort grin like he always does when he realizes the faults in his predictions. “Who would have known?”
around them just in case, because that boy was growing too clever for his own good with each passing day.
He can’t help it, someone, even if it’s his own son, has to face the wrath of his acerbic wit at least once a day or he is sure that he’ll wither away. And besides, when prompted, Scorpius can dish it right back at him. For a ten year old child, his son was an excellent verbal sparring partner.
“My eyes are up here Potter,” Malfoy snarks. “Merlin, someone tell the Prophet that Boy Wonder is a complete slag for a nice pair of tits.”
Because rationally, he knows he has legal custody of Scorpius. Rationally, he knew that if it ever came down to it, any judge would see that Astoria was not fit to parent. But when rationally gives way to irrationally...
Lily jeers, muffling her giggles behind her hand as she runs away, her little legs carrying as fast as she can up the stairs.
Scorpius nods readily, making sure to swallow his food and wipe his mouth with a napkin before speaking. Chin in the air, Draco puffs up in pride. His ten year old son had more manners than his adult best friends.
“Why don’t you keep her Dad,” Scorpius suggests softly. “I’m sure Princess will love to play with her.”
Areum has never looked so close to wringing someone’s neck before. Honestly, Draco wouldn’t stop her. These past few weeks she’s been chattering nonstop about Harry’s eyes, Harry’s muscles, Harry’s sunny personality ever since Ginny and Luna came to pick Albus and Lily up from school. The minute she saw the two women’s connected hands must have been the single greatest moment in her life because suddenly her entire life revolved around Harry Potter.
“Stop it!” He hissed, moving the Puff away from his wall. Several papers fall to the ground and he sighs, remembering to restick them on the wall once he puts Princess back in his cage.
“Why is everyone always saying that?” Draco grumbled. First Blaise in Fifth Year, now his own son. His black quill snaps and he barely bites back a curse. He liked that quill. Setting down his broken quill and his notebook on the rooftop, he remembers his promise to Scorpius. He wasn’t angry, but children weren’t always equipped to adequately read emotions.
Harry was itching to say it but wisely decided against it. Malfoy, though not exactly the epitome of a reformed citizen, didn’t seem to hold any of the same prejudices as he once did. Saying that would also break the silent vow between them to not mention the war or anything that happened in sixth year. Nearly everyone was aching to leave the past in the past, especially Malfoy. The childish pettiness was exhausting enough as is. There was no reason to unleash all hell and mention the war.
“Sorry girl,” He flips the owl a treat when he’s done tying. She eats it with unblinking eyes before flying off, her talons rudely scratching his window and leaving a long claw mark on the glass. Draco simmers. “Well fuck you too then!”
Potter slows his walking and Draco can sense him contemplating the consequences of his next words carefully. “Malfoy, I think you need to see somebody.”
The real Harry Potter is red faced, his eyes watery as his son suddenly pushes away from the table, causing the dinnerware to clatter against each other. Draco wishes he could Disapparate at this very moment, but Harry looks so pitiful that it's all he can do to hold his hand.
“Have I ever told you that I love these too?” He pulls up his shirt and reveals the long, pale cuts on his chest. The same ones Harry thinks he doesn’t notice how he looks away from. He’s doing it now, his face snapping away so that he doesn’t have to look at them. Draco has to cup his chin in his face to make him look. Not even his Dark Mark produces such a visceral reaction from him.
Taking his eyes off of his best friend, he shakes his head. “Nah, she’ll only assign me another text to read and I’d rather not be guilted into reading a three-hundred paged book again.”
“What do you want?” He really didn’t have time for Malfoy’s dramatics right now. There was a pickup game against Ravenclaw happening in a few hours and he wanted to finish this stupid task before it started.
Satisfied with his response, Draco places his head onto Harry’s stomach, the point of his chin digging into his navel. He sighs, the feeling of cool air on his stomach causing goosebumps to rise on Harry’s midsection. His pale forefinger traces irregular patterns on his skin.
“I called Malfoy hot!” Ron cries again, sounding in physical pain from his mistake. Hermione rolls her eyes yet rubs his back in sympathy.
Speech fails him when he tries to talk, his voice too ragged and sore for him to utter an intelligible word. The urge to hack up a cough is suppressed only by sheer will. If he starts coughing now then he fears that he’ll never stop.
Hermione humphs and stands up, her brown eyes smoldering. “You, Ronald Weasley, are a sexist pig, and I can’t believe I ever dated you.” She stomps off, thoroughly ignoring Ron’s pleads to come back. He stands up to dash after her, but Harry grabs his arm and drags him back down, knowing that the best thing he could do to repair the damage done was to give her space right now. When she’s left the Great Hall for good, he lets his head fall to the wooden table in defeat.
Albus pipes in, “Yeah, remember when I accidentally turned Dad’s teeth blue before his class?” Scorpius nods into Draco’s shirt. Albus snickers deviantly, “Then I did it again on purpose.” Draco smirks when Potter regards him with a cross expression.
“That’s actually the problem,” says Draco. “We recently discovered that Scorpius needs glasses and as you can see he’s not taken too kindly to having them.” His mouth tightens in warning at his son when he hisses under his breath. Scorpius was really testing his patience this morning. “So I just wanted to inform you that he is to wear his glasses at all times unless given special permission to remove them. And furthermore, if there are any behavioral issues as a result, please do not hesitate to contact me.” He smiles charmingly at Ana. “You have my email.”
His Floo roars to life, and the owners of the last two amulets he hastily brewed the previous week arrive in his living room, looking as dazed as they did in the Red Lion.
catches his ears. No, he wasn’t that person anymore, but he’ll be damned if another buggering fool adds on to the miserable night he was already having. He claws for the hawthorn wand strapped to his thigh, ready to show the sniveling git what scum he really was when a hand stops him.
He waves him off. “Yes Potter, I can handle it.” Harry pushes in a bit further, stopping only once Draco clamps down on his braid. “I’m sorry, I was wrong, shite I was so wrong, I’m not as ready for this as I thought. Fuck, can you give me a minute?” Draco's face felt on fire, his stinging eyes blurring his vision until he finally swallows his pride and blinks out the tears collecting in the corners of his eyes.
It’s several days later when the subject of the meeting is brought up again, and Draco wishes he had paid better attention.
“His name is Scorpius. Not Scorpion.” He ought to feel guilty for returning to his schoolboy ways, yet Draco can’t help but to lift his nose in the air and snobbishly announce in his poshest voice, “He is named after a constellation, much like I am.”
Between the four of us at that dinner, I felt like I had more in common with you than with my best friends.”
Draco hardly had a chance to figure out what he was going to say because it was storytime, so that meant that all of the children came rushing forward to sit on the carpet with Sachi, bright-eyed and eager for whatever Potter was playing on doing next. Some of them sat upright with their small legs crossed, but most immediately lied down on the rug, squirming to get comfortable in a tangle of limbs and giggling mouths.
With the Snitch making its twelfth reappearance, Malfoy speeds off for it first, with Harry following close behind him.
“How long have you been eavesdropping?” Draco hisses once the click-clacking of Ana’s heels had faded away. He yanks his shoulder from under his hand, the spot tingling as warmed flesh meets cool air. Potter rolls his sleeves up his arms, the Muggle button up looking annoyingly handsome on his body. He has a strong urge to eavesdrop himself to find out why he was walking around in a tailored Muggle outfit. It wasn’t like Aurors had any Muggles to impress.
Draco sits back in his chair, exhaustion heavy on his shoulders. Maybe this was just his mind telling him to go back to that Mind Healer and to actually take the prescribed potions she gave to him. Maybe, but he’ll still probably let them collect dust in his medicine cabinet instead of actually taking them. Or maybe he’ll find a new place for them under his bottom drawer where he hides everything else he doesn’t want to see.
Malfoy accidentally meets his eyes when he talks to Parkinson across the table. He quickly looks away, his blush deepening. Harry smiles. “Yeah, I will… eventually.”
Wiping a tear from his eyes, Blaise says, “If you want to have sex with Potter, have sex with Potter. It’s literally just that simple.”
She hates him, he can tell from the way she was scrutinizing him up and down like a stray crup with a bad case of mange. He hardly hears Harry introduce him to Molly as they step inside, her eyes penetrating his skin. Spatula in hand, she moves closer, her nose wrinkling disapprovingly.
“I’ve tried to play nice with you Draco.” Finley looms over him, being one of the few people who were taller than him. As intimidating as he tries to be, Draco knows from experience that there are far scarier things then Finley Greengrass. His tea-scented breaths puff out onto his cheek as he snarls, “But clearly, we’re beyond nice at this point.”
“Like I was saying, I am aware that this outcome is undesired. And Mr. Potter, don’t think that this will go unpunished.”
Harry takes a deep breath, reminding himself that he was in a library full of people and he couldn’t afford to cause a scene. “You’re not funny Malfoy,” he hisses.
“Wait!” She leaps out of her seat and holds tightly onto his hand, desperation drumming from the pulse in her fingers to her mouth. “Wait. Scorpius, how is he?”
Must he spell out everything? “It’s an amulet Weasley. To protect you from any negative spirits tomorrow.” The information does nothing to erase the confused look on his face. “It’s a Supermoon tomorrow? March 9th? The Worm Moon?” He shrugs bashfully. Draco groans. Fucking Gryffindors. “Just wear it and don’t take it off until the following day.”
Draco takes a deep breath and nods. “There, that should hold you two until the end of the day.” He pinches the bridge of his nose tiredly. “Just be careful okay? Don’t come back here bruised and bloody or I swear I’ll—”
She gives him a curt nod. “Welcome. Now Draco, what is this mess I hear about you and Astoria?” She plops down in Draco’s leather desk chair, her feet propped up on his desk and dangerously close to his perfectly placed framed photo of Marcéline.
He grits his teeth, annoyed that on such a gorgeous day, with the Quidditch goals gleaming gold in the sunlight, that they were discussing the war and the weeks that followed after Voldemort fell on one the few places that weren’t invaded by ugly memories. The Quidditch pitch was sacred—neither Malfoy or Ginny had the right to ruin that for him.
Percy points approvingly to his sipped glass of lemonade, “This is excellent Mum. What did you add in it?” Harry sips his cup, his expression brightening at the taste. Even James’ stoic expression morphs in pleasure by the drink. Must be nice.
But Harry and Draco? He thinks they have a real shot. However, he doesn’t think sitting in stuffy sushi restaurants and fake smiling at each other was the way to get there.
Draco smacks him lightly on the shoulder, sitting his wine glass to the side and boldly taking his place in the crook of Harry’s outstretched arm. Not prepared for the sudden closeness, Harry startles in surprise before recovering to wrap his arms around him. “Shove it Potter.” The words are supposed to sound far harsher than they do, instead they come out as a content sigh.
Draco shakes his head, managing to find his voice before the two are out of the door. “It’s fine Potter. You two can stay.” He looks down at Scorpius who was still crying softly.
Malfoy reddens and wraps his arms closer around his curved body. “Yeah. I’m gay.” His eyes stay fixed on the ground. “Only a few people know and now you do too. So like, don’t go around telling people alright?”
Knowing that there was no point in trying to tie it back again, he begrudgingly leaves it down, letting Harry run his fingers through the blonde strands as he pleases. Compromises; in a real relationship, there had to be some.
Yet Harry laughs and Draco feels the subtle dent in his cheek under the pad of his thumb. There it was.
“I figured,” he grumbles. Draco smiles. He’ll drill table manners into Harry even if it killed him. “Don’t transform into your Animagus form when the Moon is waning?’ Draco, I’m not an Animagus!” He resists the urge to point out that it was perfectly sound advice if he ever
“Yeah,” Draco agrees, his eyelids suddenly feeling too heavy to keep open. Blinking rapidly, his blurred vision focuses on the half empty glass of brandy Blaise supplied for him. “I need to stop drinking.”
“Oh Potter, there’s no use in denying otherwise. See, unlike me, your male body will betray you each and every time. And right now, it’s being rather
“...And of course, like always, let’s give a proper welcome to our new parent to the group! Draco, come up to the front and introduce yourself!”
He places a hand on her shoulder. Working with children all day must be exhausting. The people who voluntarily do it are truly one of a kind. Except for Potter, of course. He’s just a one-a-kind arsehole. “I talked to him, it was all a simple misunderstanding.”
“Draco,” Finley flashes too-white teeth his way. Glamour doesn’t do him any favors. “It’s been far too long, I’d say.” Draco blinks. He’s not here for pleasantries. “I’m glad you finally decided to move past this,” he waves a wrinkled hand around, shrewdly side-eyeing Astoria, “mishap.”
He shrugs again, solemnly picking at his food with his fork. “I guess most children don’t have parents who are astronauts.”
She reaches past him for something on the counter and shoves a new bag of carrots in his chest, this one heavier than the last. It seems that her idea of forgiveness is shoving bags of vegetables at him. Or maybe this was her idea of revenge. He wasn’t sure.
He waits until they’ve gotten their bearings before jumping back into the last bit of his presentation, explaining the magical theory and Full Moon’s intrinsic influence on magical cores and emotions. They probably don’t hear him, still too rattled to give their full attention, but he continues away. And then, because every good scientist knows that correlation does
They both breathe a sigh of relief when she lets go. He won’t admit it, but her optimism was much needed right now.
He doesn’t think he’s cared what the Prophet has published since he left for Paris. This was embarrassing, yes, but he’ll live.
“You know what I mean,” he snaps. Scrubbing a hand through his hair, he takes three deep breaths, his annoyance dispersing once he does. Draco’s scowl deepens. Why can’t he do that? “Look, I know you aren’t on the best of terms with them—”
at you.” Draco sinks down into the chair Finley once occupied, clenching his fists and pressing them to his throbbing temples. “I would have stayed had you just done more.”
Harry and the Weasleys entertain themselves at dinner, laughing over the enormous plate of food Molly made sure to stack on everyone’s plate. He may be hallucinating because he swore that his food portions were just a bit fuller than everyone else's. He doesn’t know if he can keep his promise to eat two plates when he can hardly get through one.
Harry nodded, paling considerably at the thought of his two friends wanking. Over Malfoy and his perfect body nonetheless. “Noted.”
Malfoy giggles in that stupidly attractive high pitched voice, clasping his hands behind his back innocently. It doesn’t escape his notice that the action conveniently pushes his breasts out even more. Harry narrows his eyes. That sneaky ferret knew
“Like I said, we’re fine,” sneers Draco. “So you and your offspring can scram, we don’t need your charity.”
He feels honored, for being able to be close enough to Harry Potter’s face to fully appreciate his beauty.
Draco scoffs, a bit too loudly to be convincing. A Calming Draught has a tendency to do that. He wonders if he took too much of it. Probably. “Last time I checked my eyes were grey, so of course you would think that. Now hush, I need to concentrate.” For some reason, Draco has a distinct feeling that Harry would be pissed if he found out what he did. A Healer would certainly blow a fit if they found out.
Draco obsessively checks and rechecks the luminosity of the moon that evening, needing to put his energy into some sort of mental activity lest he go stir crazy and
Potter’s storytelling resonated with Draco so much that in the spirit of friendship—regardless of how tenuous that title was—Draco decided to actually give him a gift.
Draco worries the corner of his lip for so long, Harry wonders if he’ll ever respond. “You shouldn’t call yourself a prick, because I don’t think you are one.”
“You don’t need to apologize James, I understand.” James hangs his head. “But thank you,” he adds. “I know this isn’t easy for you. And if it makes you feel any better, I’m sorry too.”
He doesn’t blame her. Draco rubs his head. He needs more alcohol. Rubbing his heart, he tries to rub away that disgusting feeling in his chest he always does after a panic attack. The one that feels violated that his body would turn on him so violently that he couldn’t even breathe.
Draco waves him off, swallowing several times to try to lubricate his dry throat. All of the water in his body has gone to his eyes, his face soaked in tears for no reason other than because he can’t breathe. “No,” he wheezes, “Compromises.”
Draco doesn’t think he can even look at another plastic horse by the time they find an ice cream shop. Whoever invented biscuit sales, playdates, and amusement parks should be hexed mercilessly. And if it was the same person—burned to death.
Fuck, he looks down at his wrinkled clothes. He’s thankful that Potter at least had the good grace to not strip him down to his pants last night. Though they smelled sour and he could definitely use a good bath, there was no way he was taking a shower
Oh no he didn’t. He wasn’t stupid. Draco didn’t care if Ginevra was bleeding out of every orifice, because Harry Potter had some explaining to do.
Unamused by the most unsexy thing walking into the room, Draco silently snarls at the back of Boot’s head when he turns his back to him. He butts Draco out of the way in his quest to get to Harry fucking Potter.
Malfoy looks up at him with those large, light grey eyes and Harry feels a strange fluttering in his chest. “You’ll do that… for me?”
Malfoy’s girlish cackles tickle his ears once Snape’s left to go harass another poor soul. He crosses one smooth leg over the other and flips his hair. “That’s what you get for using big words you don’t know Potter,” he trills in a singsong voice, playing with the curled end of his braid. “I mean seriously.
Wait… if Albus was Potter’s son and if Scorpius said that his teacher was his new friend’s father who was also a wizard, then that means…
Draco nods, taking it in. When he put his heterosexuality aside, Blaise did make an excellent point. Harry, for as fit as he was, could also be the most oblivious person Draco knew. Clearly, subtle hints weren’t doing him any favors. So far it has been Draco who’s initiated everything. Maybe he really was just waiting for Draco’s cue. His very
Her eyes flit to the top of the kitchen cabinet where an array of liquor bottles sit high and out of a child’s reach. “Stop drinking. Nothing about that is real.”
But Harry and James were too far drugged and tense to listen to her. “If we’re being honest,” James says leaning forward, “I haven’t felt a part of this family in months. Somehow, my feelings on the divorce don’t matter.”
Draco’s mouth twists into a contemptuous scowl. “I will puncture your balls with my heels if you tell anyone this Potter.” Harry laughs. “I mean it,” he insists.
If he’s being honest, Draco’s never quite been comfortable discussing his sexuality with anyone other than Pansy. He’s not ashamed of course, just not comfortable. His mother and him have never discussed it head on, but he’s seen some of her unfinished letters to his father detailing how disgusted she was by his fervent disapproval of Draco’s sexual orientation.
Her thumb swipes across his eyebrow and she tsks at him for his apology. “Before you were ever thirty-one,” she said, “you were my son and my son is allowed to cry on my lap.”
is the equivalent of a fluffy Kneazle when he’s mad. Don’t worry I got this.” Harry snorts to himself. There must be another Draco at Hogwarts because the Draco Malfoy he knew was a firestorm when he was angry. She turns to him, wand raised in warning. “This is a one time thing, Potter. If I see you hocking around the dungeons outside of this, you’ll be as ball-less as Draco is.”
“Malfoy!” Stormy eyes drill into him at the sound of his voice. “Malfoy, I’m really sorry, I didn’t mean to—”
Draco cares for her, he actually does. With everything that’s happened, it had never been his intention to make her suffer. But he has to look out for Scorpius first, regardless of her pleas. He won’t risk having Scorpius fall into the cycle of neglect he was in before they left Paris.
“Remember to raise your hand TJ,” Harry chides gently before Draco can respond. Well then, he guesses they’re jumping straight into questions with him. Draco goes with it.
She still looks as if she’ll give up a quid of Muggle money rather than continuing listening to him speak, but at least his voice isn’t wavering.
you always wear your hair in a braid? When we learned about the war in school I saw pictures of your father and he never wore his in a…”
“And can you believe it, they said the Headmaster was fired for misconduct!” The blonde woman in front of him says, looking appalled by whatever situation she was referring to. “I’m glad I had the good sense to send my son here instead of Stonewall. Who knows what sort of mischief he would get up to there!”
Draco makes a sound of approval. “I can’t believe that there are people who actually used to think of you as dim-witted.” He gives an exaggerated cringe. “Oh wait, that was actually me.”
“Draco…” He doesn’t care what Harry had to say. He’s said enough. “Three. You’ve literally just said it yourself Draco.
Draco begins to snort in amusement before remembering that this was Potter he was talking about. His Weasel spawn aren’t cute or adorable, no matter how similar they may act like his own son.
“I swear you do this on purpose,” Harry moans as Draco takes the tip of his cock into his mouth, swirling his tongue around the tip. He sucks harder, faster, going as quickly as he could to get Harry off. Lest he falls asleep with a cock in his mouth, Draco wisely skips his usual bit of teasing. “I’d say you’re a bigger arse now than you were in school.”
Or maybe the book did say something about it and it was at the part where his head was swimming and his vision blurring.
Instinctively his stomach drops and he waits for the inevitable moment that Malfoy will admit that it was all a ruse to trap and embarrass him because he was Harry Potter and that's just how he and Malfoy were to each other.
And he does, the words heating Draco’s skin as he murmurs it along the cut of his cheekbones. England is pink and warm on his rooftop and Harry’s arms feel warmer. The day’s events have drained him and instead of taking his frustration out on some innocent trinkets and burning them, Draco opted to choose a lighter, safer option—letting Harry completely dote on him.
“So one,” he says, “Both on our first date and at that time I was an arse and forced you to stand in front of the PTA group.” At least he admitted it. Draco doesn’t so much as bat an eyelash. “On the date, I thought you were just bored or annoyed by me, but you kept shaking every so often and fidgeting. You’re a bloody fidgeter you know that?”
Harry grabs a fistful of Draco’s loose hair, inspecting with a close eye. “Oh my gosh, is that a caterpillar in your hair?!”
His jaw aches with something morbidly cruel he has stored in the hollow of his cheek, but the charmed potion keeps it there.
Draco has to remember to control his body language and clear his mind of everything but the Manor when he Apparates them. They arrive in front of the pristine Manor with a loud crack though not even the general nausea from apparating can distract him from his returning thoughts.
Today was the last day of school before Winter Break and despite all his attempts to avoid Potter, he was there outside of the school, handing peppermint sweets to excited children as they bounded down the stairs. Trailed by Albus and his son, Potter had personally delivered Draco a sweet, hardly noticing that his fingers, warm and lovely, had brushed against his shoulder, grazing past the base of his braid.
He doesn’t point this out or give in to the burning desire to throw every moment Draco stepped up and parented Scorpius while she acted as if he didn’t exist. This is her chance to come clean about all of her bottled up emotions.
to have such a delectable arse. Harry wondered absentmindedly if Malfoy’s arse always looked like that, before pushing the thought away with a shake of his head. Malfoy shifts ever so slightly on his foot, the action causing his skirt to rise just the barest of inches. A hint of something green flashes briefly and Harry’s throat becomes dry when he wonders what was
It was, in Draco’s humble opinion, a perfectly valid and salient reminder. His name requires the full command of the tongue and he should be proud of that. Not everyone has a name as celestial and highly as Scorpius. Some, he shudders, have
Scorpius throws his head back and whines, sounding all the more like the younger version of himself. It was easy to forget from his witty retorts and polite exterior that Scorpius was only ten and was prone to temper tantrums just like any other ten year old.
Draco bites his lip to keep from laughing prematurely. Whatever Albus said must have been hilarious. He had to give it to him—the kid was supremely funny. “What did he say?”
Blaise could fuck off too because he’s enjoying this far too much for a person whose Draco’s deemed as the most pussy-whipped man of the century. Pansy laughs breathily, “Hun, help me up, I’m going to pee.” She puts a hand on Blaise’s shaking shoulders. Pansy sucks in a breath, her drink-covered hand resting on the top of her stomach. “I’m really going to—”
Harry studies him intently. Though he’s never seen that grin before, he has seen a similar look in his eyes numerous times. Like when he’s flying and his eyes land on the Snitch. Or when he takes that first bite of chocolate. And especially when he knows he’s brewed the perfect potion.
Of all things, Draco’s entranced by the way his fingers move, oddly elegant and sure inside the kitchen. He fidgets a lot, Draco’s noticed, his fingers usually moving erratically about in the air as if he didn’t know just quite what to do with them. But he knows exactly what to do with them in here, his hands moving with practiced confidence around the kitchen.
They’re just finishing up a previous presentation when Draco and Jaspers enter. Galatea’s mouth twisted in contempt, her blue eyes narrowing at the sight of him sitting down patiently in one of the seats. Draco sits up in the same poised manner his Charm School tutors taught him. He wanted to make a good… fifth impression today.
Somewhere, in the deep recesses of his conscience, he is hoping that there wasn’t room. At least he could say he tried, without feeling guilty.
Not bothering to read the note, he jumps straight to the name signed at the bottom of the parchment.
A flock of crows swoops overhead of the school, their presence and the grey sky above not helping to contradict the school’s ominous aura. Sensing his magic, they ferociously caw at him from their place on the roof, reminding Draco that no matter how many books he reads or the type of clothes he wears, he will never truly belong here.
the one who has to prove herself, not you. Say you tell him and she just ends up disappointing him again. Then what?”
Harry thoughtlessly runs his fingers through his hair, musing up the hours worth of work Draco put into trying to tame his unruly locks into something decent enough for Yule. He was going to kill him once he got here.
Though he’s already had enough liquid shoved down his throat for a lifetime, he does as he’s told, the brisk beverage soothing his sore throat better than any potion or spell could have.
He was oddly talented, with Draco probably the most wide-eyed of them all as he listened to his former arch rival pull silly faces and usher the children around him to sleep with his enchanting voice.
“Not a peep,” Harry warns the three children, tugging Draco out of their room and into Harry’s with a startling amount of strength.
“Fuck,” he gasps, gripping onto Harry’s arms. They were definitely going to try that once they had a proper bed underneath them.
Though it’s hardly surprising, Draco is excellent at everything, from waltzing to dipping to simply embodying the elegance the dance calls for. His body is lithe and feline-like, moving with a graceful fluidity that Harry couldn’t acquire no matter how much he practiced.
The bloody bastard smirks. “Hey, Potter.” His voice does that stupid purring thing again, and it occurs to him that his voice may just naturally sound like that. He hopes not. His voice both evokes his most filthy carnal desires to bend him over a desk and the overwhelming need to punch him in his pointed nose. Neither of which are desirable outcomes if he’s intent on keeping his promise to McGonagall.
“I’m over it. Who cares about that when Astoria and Finley want to take Scorpius back to Paris? I can never relax as it is, now I have to worry about them wanting to take my son away from me?” He shakes his head; Harry’s priorities were messed up. “I’m not discussing this fictional mental illness shite anymore, I need to move onto what matters.”
These weren’t the crocodile tears Malfoy shed in front of Hermione. These were real, caused by some unexplainable pain that Harry was determined to get to the bottom of.
Merlin, he hates this house, with it’s dying plants and dusty cabinets. With Finley, who was probably somewhere close by right now, prowling in the shadows and waiting to hex him for being gay and divorced.
He opened his mouth to protest because he was not oblivious when she cut him off with a wave of her hand.
They visibly tense and Draco can feel the pit of his stomach tie into knots after he casts it. Merlin, he hates this feeling. But it’s good, it’s real. Everyone in the room seems to be feeling it too, with the exception of Jaspers, who miraculously is immune to the spells’ effect. Either that or he was just unfairly good at dealing with anxiety.
He’s still wearing those horrific circular framed glasses, but the sight is not as unappealing as it was thirteen years ago. His dark hair looks far better than it did in school, the curled locks brushing just past his ears. What chokes him up most is the groomed beard Potter’s sporting, turning him into the physical reincarnation of Draco’s schoolboy fantasies. Had Potter looked like this when they were sixteen, things would have turned out far differently.
He supposes stranger things have happened. Like kissing the warm lips of a man who had died and came back to life.
Draco quickly gathers his things, shrinking the box so that it fits in his cloak pocket. He bows, glaring at them all, his rejection letter crumpled in his hand. “Thank you for your time.”
No they did not. It would take them at least seven minutes to get back to the original spot they departed at and that’s only if they left at this very moment. “It’s nearly five,” Draco points out, tapping his watch.
Hermione sputters for several seconds before shaking her head in annoyance. “Thank you, Ronald,” she growls sourly. “Now get off of him Harry!”
He doesn’t mind too much, their continued staring giving Draco enough time to set up the bowl of water on its axel and set down his Ministry approved Calming Draughts. He leaves the secure magical stamp of approval on the vials so that no one can accuse the ‘Scary Death Eater’ of trying to poison the Astrology and Astronomy board members. Harry squirms excitedly in his seat, ready to see the people Draco’s complained about for months losing their shite like he did when he has them cast their
“Oh Malfoy,” Hermione murmurs softly. “Come here,” she opens her arms and draws Malfoy into a comforting hug. A
He takes a shuddering breath, forcing the memory of those damned bloody tiles out of his mind. “I’ll apologize to him.” He sets down his broom and heads off towards the way Malfoy scampered off to.
Still, because he did have some Slytherin in him, Harry moved several inches to the right to ensure that he was well away from Malfoy’s claws. Self-preservation was a vital trait when dealing with an irate Draco Malfoy.
Every Friday, Kacia comes in and vents about how her nail polish chipped while driving or how her bratty son refuses to eat his sandwich unless it was cut into triangles—but not squares,
“Fine,” he sighs, “Now if you’ll excuse me, I need to go present.” On quick feet, he manages to side step him and stomps in the direction of his destination.
“For reasonably keeping something this hard to explain to yourself instead of sharing it with me on our first date?” He snorts, “Yeah, apology accepted.”
The next few days after that, Malfoy made it his personal mission to intentionally arouse Harry at the worst possible times. Whether it was when he was sitting at lunch with Ron and Malfoy was doing that idiotic sausage licking thing, in the hallway when he would ‘accidentally’ drop his books, causing him to bend over and giving Harry teasing view up his skirt, or simply as he swayed past the Gryffindor table, his hips and hair moving to an unknown beat.
“Sorry,” he sneers, “my jaw slipped.” Harry really ought to know better than to talk shite to a person who currently had his cock in their mouth.
Hoards of Muggle children and their parents walked into the building, each wearing various levels of excitement or dread on their faces. Some children are already in groups, chatting amicably with their friends. Draco gulped. Scorpius didn’t know anyone. Would anyone be willing to let him join in their friend group? What if he didn’t fit in anywhere? Good Merlin, what if he met another version of Draco when he was their age?
In the corner of his eye, he sees Malfoy stretch, chattering away with Parkinson as he bends to touch his toes, his toned legs making Harry salivate. Merlin, it was as if it was Malfoy’s life goal to eviscerate him into a pile of horny nothingness. Lost in the curves of Malfoy’s defined arse, he doesn’t even notice the dark shadow looming over him until Ginny’s panted greeting meets his ear.
His heart spikes in his chest, the feeling actually painful. Rubbing the spot over his heart, Draco hisses, “What? Never seen a cock before?”
As much as he loved them and would die for them, his friends could be the most annoying pair of bastards in England.
It’s not final. That weekend, Scorpius is cuddled up with Princess, the very male purple Pygmy Puff with a very female name. He’s enamored with the small fuzzy creature and thanks Draco’s ears off afterward. And okay, maybe the thing isn’t that bad. But Draco would rather die before he admits that his heart melted just a tinsy bit when Princess licks his finger with his long tongue.
He decides to take his word for it for once, because regardless of how much he pretends to hate them, Harry was really excellent at surprises.
Harry begins to climb, gripping tightly onto the branches the higher he goes. Merlin, he climbed high. So high that the branches begin to thin and he wisely stops once he gets just below Malfoy. The branches wouldn’t be able to bear his weight as it could for Malfoy’s slim frame.
Draco makes a small sound in disagreement. He and Hermione Granger were further opposites than him and Harry. The only thing they’ve ever been similar in was academics and even
With crossed arms, Draco slumps into his seat, looking over at the sleeping children and feeling his heart do that tugging thing again. “You were good—with the storytelling thing I mean.”
His mouth thins and draws into a ridge, tight line. He cups his jaw again, pinching his chin harder in between his two fingers. “Watching you being unable to breathe is suffering. For you and for me.” He brings his face closer, as though being nose to nose would help drive his point home. “Do you have any idea what it looks like when you hyperventilate like that?”
Potter eyes him, looked thoroughly irritated at his sudden lack of explanation. “You don’t have to pretend like you had the perfect marriage. Trust me, no one does. If you did I doubt you’ll be here right now.”
And not once does she snap at her students, instead deciding to bend down at their level and speak to them with a calming smile on her face.
A cart of people speeds past them on one of those metal contraptions, the sheer force of its velocity settling in his bones. Draco shivers. Harry Potter has brought them to a death trap.
The seventh night, Harry corners him just as he's rolling out of the bed to rearrange the bookshelf in the study. With bleary eyes and a voice rough from sleep he asked, “What are you avoiding Draco?”
A silent scream is trapped in his throat and his left eye begins to twitch. With delicate precision, Draco gently sets his tea down on the coffee table beside him and gives her a pained smile. “And I think that’s my cue to leave. Thanks Pansy—”
“That’s rich coming from a man that eats his bacon with a fork. A fork?!” He shakes his head as if it was the most prosperous idea to have table manners before focusing back down on his plate. “I really don’t understand how Al and Scorpius ever became friends.”
The classroom Ana said to meet at is directly next to hers, so Draco doesn’t have to bother asking the grizzly receptionist any questions. It’s not like she would answer him anyhow. She was sleeping under a book when he walked past her desk.
He hands Harry a glass of wine and part of his thick green blanket. Harry instantly relaxes, the tight button up appearing less constraining around his neck under the moon’s pale rendering and black, starry night.
Draco groans. She was in Singapore with Mrs. Parkinson, visiting the maternal side of Pansy’s family ancestry. Those two and Blaise’s mother had always gotten along beautifully and would frequently take trips together. But why, out of all times, did their mothers think that this would be the perfect time to leave the country? Sometimes he doesn’t understand people.
Potter repeatedly rakes his hands through his hair, his jaw loose from shock. “What the hell was that for?!”
He picks Scorpius up from school, ignoring Potter’s gaze from across the bicycle rack and above the sea of chattering children. He doesn’t have the patience for him today either. By weaving through the crowd of Londoners on his way to the Apparition point, he manages to Apparate them back into the house in under ten minutes.
Draco points his wand at his face, the Latin ready on his tongue if he doesn’t leave him at this very moment. “Not a request.” Another wave of shaking and a fresh wave of tears takes over his body. He doesn’t want to have a panic attack in front of Harry. Regardless of their relationship there were some things he just didn’t want other people to see. This was one of them.
Albus is running around, trying to make sure everyone is in the correct position to greet his oldest brother. Or whatever he deems the correct position at that moment. Draco’s been moved five times in the last ten minutes and has been told by a very stern ten year old to stop scowling more than once.
” Scorpius fires, waving his hands around as if there was a loud explosion. “That’s my Dad’s favorite. He uses it when he’s mad.”
“I can introduce myself,” grumbles Draco. Only, he can’t because Merlin, this was such a large group of Muggles and he seems to temporarily lose the ability of speech. His quip to Potter catches midway in his throat, coiling and constricting around itself.
Draco, in his high heels and black robes. Draco, who had been purring in his ear since Harry had snuck him into Gryffindor earlier in the day. Draco, who at the very moment, was supremely unaware of how difficult it was becoming for Harry to concentrate on not stepping on his feet while making sure his own robes properly cover him.
He presses a quick kiss on his son’s head and lays him down gently onto the bed, promising to return after he speaks with Ana.
“Let me guess,” Harry says once he’s stopped being twirled. “Hermione lent you some books on feminism?”
He should stop feeling desperate. He knows he should. After all, nothing in the universe happens overnight. Except for like, supernovas. God, he knows this, yet he just can’t help but feel that his universe was inherently screwed up. Doesn’t he have the right to be mad?
Draco nods, though his body feels cold all over. This wasn’t about him. This was about Scorpius. And if Scorpius was okay, then he would learn to be as well.
They can do whatever they want. His pain was their entertainment. He’s pissed that he played the fool for them for a year. What joy they must have gotten from seeing him undeservingly fail every week. Passing out approvals in front of his face, taunting him for what he can’t have.
Scorpius takes his hand in his and bounces with it like Draco used to do with his own mother. “C’mon Dad, everyone does it!” His voice was on the thin line between reasoning and begging. Draco hated beggars.
“But don’t you think we can both do better? We clearly both have issues. I’m not saying that I’m perfect in the slightest, but at least I’m not denying it. I know you hated it, but there’s more than one potion available, Draco. There’s even Muggle medicine you can try…”
There's a sharp intake of breath that must have come from him because suddenly his chest is too tight to curse at his clumsiness, too constricted to even yelp when the glass from the dropped teacup cuts into his feet or from the scathing heat of the spilled tea on his skin.
He feels his heart crack at the core. It wasn’t his fault for the divorce, yet Draco can never get him to understand that.
He wants to say something, a witty retort maybe, but his throat is too raw from crying to do anything but whimper pathetically.
She smoothes back a lock of hair and tucks it delicately behind his ear. “What seems to be the problem this time?” As much as his mother loved teasing him for finally understanding what she went through all those years raising him, he was still a shameless mama’s boy. He nuzzles into her hand, sighing at the touch.
What was there to say, anyway? Neither were particularly new to dating, but they were overwhelmingly new to dating
“Biscuits! Buy biscuits!” A sharply dressed man with a briefcase and shiny leather shoes takes one look at the pair and crosses the street to avoid crossing paths with them. Draco wonders how long he would spend in Azkaban for sending a tickling hex to the soles of his posh shoes.
Feeling bold, Draco places his hand in between Harry’s legs and squeezes. He hums in approval. Oh, he has a thing alright. A very
Draco scoffs. As if that was going to stop him. “I’m aware.” He hardly needs to be reminded. He’s been continually casting heating charms since they’ve come to this sodding park. It’s been a pain the arse, but worth it. Draco hated the cold. Eight years sleeping in the Slytherin dungeons would do that to a person.
Renewed with excitement, Draco jumps up, pulling his leather chair out from under the desk and to the center of the room. He pats the back of it. “Sit. You should be in a stable position and at ease when I do this.”
He recoils at her inquisitions. First Harry, now her. “That’s none of your business.” And then, because he can’t help himself he adds, “At least I don’t forget to feed my own child.”
He wants to protest how unfair it all was, but knowing Snape, he’ll probably take 20 points from his house. So he forces himself to shut his mouth and slumps back into his seat with his head bowed. “Yes sir, Professor Snape,” he grumbles under his breath.
His face burns when he realizes that the wheel has stopped and people are slowly being let out one by one from the ride. Something akin to blistering disappointment prickles his skin, though he has no reason to be disappointed. Potter was never his to be disappointed over in the first place.
He looks up at Harry, still in the throes of his nearing orgasm. He shakes his head vigorously. “Nope, nothing.” He no not so subtly pushes his hips forward, rudely shoving his wettened cock in Draco’s face.
“It could be if you let it.” Harry sighs. And Ron chewing with his mouth closed could be his thing too, but it wasn’t going to happen. They step and move together, Harry’s legs uncooperative as he tries to match Draco’s natural grace. Merlin, it felt like fourth year all over again. “You’re resisting too much,” Draco murmurs against his lips. “Trust me.”
Ginny stands up. “Go,” she says, rubbing Harry on the back. “I’ll be upstairs in a moment.” Her face was exploding with color and he could tell that she was only several seconds away from unleashing her pent up fury.
I realized in the middle of writing this that I had named Pansy and Blaise's daughter after the vampire queen on Adventure Time but with a fancy accent. Idk man, I just really like cartoons.
From the outside it seemed like he did the prat a favor; Malfoy was receiving far more attention than he had before, though Harry remembers quite vividly watching Slytherin Pureblood girls throw themselves at him before the potion accident and especially before he became a baby Death Eater.
Draco disagrees. Being tossed around in the air on anything that wasn’t a broom wasn’t his idea of fun. He turned to Scorpius who was nearly shaking in his shoes with excitement. Shite. It seemed to be his son’s idea of fun unfortunately.
He’s at a loss for words. She remembered. She remembered something so important to him and his heritage. She remembered, for
"Draco! Hey!" He hears panting behind him. Internally cursing his rotten luck, he turns to see Jaspers, hands on his knees, and wearing that same goofy grin on his face. “Whew, you’re a fast one eh? Hate to try and race you.”
He really doesn’t know what he should be sorry for except for maybe secretly shagging his father, but Draco’s learned after ten years of parenting that children value apologies more than adults do at times.
Harry waves at him, beckoning him forward with a look that reads almost like relief. “Malfoy, come in.”
Truthfully he’s a bit above average, but Draco isn’t much interested arguing about cock sizes when one was impaling him.
Harry lets him drag him around, listening to Draco geek out about every single star or galaxy they pass, and doing his best not to look as confused as Draco knew he was whenever he spouted random facts. For Harry’s sake, Draco begrudgingly steers them away from the section dedicated to black holes because existential crises were a bitch, and this place was full of them.
Terry Boot, the thick-headed bastard that somehow managed to be sorted into Ravenclaw, gives him a loopy sort of smile. Draco never cared for him; he was a walking oxymoron. “Ah, right. Say, doesn’t your kid go here? Scorpio or Scorpion or something like that?”
The resulting crack of exploding light startles Harry so badly that Draco has to grip him under the arms to keep him from falling out of his seat. Delighted laughter falls out of his mouth in waves. “Brilliant! How do you feel?”
Harry leans in to kiss his cheek and Draco tilts his head away right when his lips graze his cheekbone. “I want to show you something. I promise you, I’m not that much of a loon.”
She glares at him through her tears, looking all the more like her father the longer they hold each other gaze. He prepares for her to strike back about his panic attacks or his smoking habit but she doesn’t. A drowning sound escapes her mouth and a hand flying to her face to muffle it. He tenses, wondering if he somehow went too far until he realizes that she wasn’t sobbing. She was…
“Well,” Harry breathed, his chest rising up and down as if it was being bewitched by the strength of a Full Moon, “this was certainly
“Draco, love, you look fine, I promise. Look, whatever happens today, just know that it can’t be worse than last night,” Harry points out.
“Piss off the fourth years, why don’t you?” Muttered Harry to himself, though he really didn’t care about their feelings at this moment. Not when Draco was looking like
Thankfully, Potter is none the wiser. “You mean you never did?” He sounds shocked. Of course, Potter’s marriage would be filled with heartful sing-alongs and spontaneous dancing. Probably with flowers owled to work desks and good morning kisses. The kind of things you get when your marriage isn't pre-arranged by your parents.
Draco clutches the bouquet to his chest. “No! They’re mine!” They’re his and he wants everyone to know it. He grips them tighter, smiling at the blossoms.
He doesn’t actually care, he was simply messing with Ron’s head. Using his ridiculously curvy body to toy with him. Doing the exact thing Harry was just defending him for.
He really wants to stop seeing his insecurities at the mouth of a bottle. Problem is, he doesn’t know how to quit doing so.
There’s a thud on the window and Harry’s speckled brown owl is sitting on the stoop, her eyes trained on Draco. If he looks closely, Draco swears he sees something akin to hatred in her yellow gaze.
After a moment’s hesitation, Harry joins him. He rolls over, shyly poking his cheek with his forefinger. “Sooo… you’re just going to sleep then?”
and Snape with another one of his dark glares, but Malfoy persists in provoking him with his childish taunts.
Taking the deepest breath he can, Draco focuses on calming his racing heart for the millionth time. He needs to stay away from large crowds of people. And Harry’s friends. And literally anything that makes his nerves burn like this.
Ginevra gives him a wilting look as she tries to staunch some of the blood pouring out of her cheek. “Sorry.” She looks at her bloody hands and curses. “I should probably go.” Long after she’s gone, he can still hear her hisses of pain as she tried to pick glass out of her skin.
Harry’s blood-filled thumb digs into the space between his knuckles. He’s just about to melt from his own fear when she pokes him sharply in the ribs with her spatula.
chocolate? That makes no sense! Good Merlin and why is it so bloody hot?!” He pulls at the two loose strands of his hair, his frustration growing every passing second. “I swear if no one buys these things in the next second I’ll—”
“I don’t remember you being this much a slow learner in school Malfoy. Is it possible that you need your ears checked? I’m fairly certain you heard me right.” That smug, bastardly grin appears on his face again as Draco gapes. “You’re an
He hums softly under his breath, something that he finds himself doing more with Harry around. His fingers trace over the various teas in the cabinet before landing on the Earl Grey he knows Harry prefers. The steam from the tea floats up into his nose, and he adds a touch of honey to thoroughly compensate for his sleep-kicking. He’s just turning to head back upstairs when a silvery cuckoo flutters into the kitchen.
When Windsor’s gruff voice calls him forward to present, Draco wastes no time diving into the findings of his studies about Waxing Gibbous’ and Apparition, trying his best to ignore Jaspers’ enthusiastic thumbs-up and Galatea’s unimpressed scowl. In France, this same theory had been added to the guidelines for Apparition Safety, though from the tired yawns Parcel was letting out, he thinks it’ll be a long time before it’s accepted here.
The fire cracks, Harry’s fingers run over the hairs of his eyebrow, and Draco fails to swallow the truth sitting on his tongue.
Draco kisses the top of his son’s head. “Oh Scorpius. I didn’t have to look to the stars for that. Every day, including this one, has the potential to be good.” He fixes his hair one last time, making sure every blonde strand is smoothed into place. “Now, go make today great.”
Draco bites his lip, willing himself not to make a fool out of himself and come from fingers alone. He won’t be able to look him in the eyes after that.
Harry presses his forehead against Draco’s, the warm heat of his skin reminding him that he was not alone; that they were in this together. “I’ll hold you to it,” he echoes.
The dragon constellation twinkles in response to Harry’s awed whisper. “Did you do this yourself?” His fingers twitch, as if they were ready to reach out and try to grab one of the twinkling faux stars above.
Scorpius’ head pokes out of the stained window, his eyes widening simultaneously with his smile. Their smiles match in a way Draco’s never noticed before, each identical when placed side by side.
The station is packed, another year’s worth of dirt and grime staining the floor as hundreds of witches and wizards say their goodbyes to their children. They’re in the exact spot Draco had mentioned in his letter two weeks ago to Astoria.
Green eyes stare down at him, dancing with mirth as Draco’s hungry gaze devours him. He’s nearly about to bend his head down, or maybe just give in to his insatiable desire to taste him and drop to his knees, but Harry clearly has other ideas. He holds Draco’s head back by the base of his braid, keeping him away from what he wanted most.
“Very drugged,” Harry murmurs against the side of his neck, his hands slipping beneath his waistband and pulling down his trousers. He wastes no time to Vanish his own and
Harry waves them off. “Just here to support my boyfriend.” He wiggles his fingers. “Just forget I’m even here.” He makes his way to the empty seats, shooting Draco an encouraging smile while the board members gawk at him.
himself. Serves him right. Anybody should be ashamed that they dared to string those words together in a sentence.
Draco doesn’t answer him, opening up the door to say goodbye to Scorpius. That next meeting was sure to be hell if his cock had anything to say about it. Which it usually does, since it’s been far too long since he’s last wanked and laughably long since he’s had a good shag.
He immediately reaches out to touch him, coming up short when he remembers his manners. Narcissa Malfoy taught him better than that. “Can I?”
“Pretty good,” he answers, deciding to play along with Harry’s little game while his arse was currently burning in pain. “Cleaned Princess’ cage, calculated some orbital patterns, finally got the average man who I’ve been pining after for sixteen years’ average cock up my arse. Couldn’t have been better.” He runs his hands up Harry’s straining biceps. “And yours?”
Malfoy huffs again, letting out a few quiet giggles. “In all honesty, you fighting me was the closest anyone has been to treating me like the real me. The girls are suddenly sweet to me and the boys—” he shudders. “The boys are constantly hiding their boners from me. Or worse,
His son gasps while Albus laughs himself to bits. “No Princess, no!” Scorpius pulls the purple pygmy puff off of the back of Optimus Prime, though it takes quite a bit of effort to disentangle their connected tongues and connected…
They set off towards the school, hand in hand as they usually do, but this time shrouded in an air of silent uneasiness between them.
Harry shakes his head, amusement shimmering at the surface. “You two clearly don’t hate each other; you’re both just weird.” He runs his hand through his hair. “Watch, when James comes home, you’ll see what I mean. I’m considering having Ginny take his wand from him in case he wants to use me as a practice target for an Unforgivable.”
An animalistic urge seized him to lean over and trace the vein that traveled down his shaft with his tongue, swirl the rough pad of his thumb over the tip of the sensitive, seeping flesh, swallow him whole until the only word Harry could gasp out was his name.
She pushes him back down, ignoring his severed gasps for air and Molly’s fervent admonishing of her actions.
Cracked notes, awful runs, and landing on keys that didn’t exist. That was Harry Potter singing, and Draco would listen to it for the rest of his life if he could.
Draco’s eyes follow a path from his hands, his tanned arms, all the way up to his lips. The same lips that he’s watched smirk at his failures, laugh with Scorpius, command a room with a single word. Green eyes watch him, the hue beautiful and soft around the edges from the aurora of misty grey and yellow light pouring into the kitchen.
Harry’s laughter rings in his ear as he groans exasperatedly, clearly used to her jibing. Swallowing the mountainous lump in his throat, he croaks out a hoarse, “What?”
“Are you okay? Your eyes look a little…I dunno, cloudy?” Harry’s fingers lightly tilts his head towards him. Burns stands in front of the room and starts his threatening warnings about talking or mischief during the presentation.
When he’s done, his efforts are rewarded with a thick, expensive piece of parchment paper handed to him by Crass’ aged dotted fingers. His rejection letter. This one will go nicely with the other four he has collecting dust in his office.
“Potter. My house. Saturday. Come or don’t.” He shrugs. “It was a gift anyway, I don’t see why you’re making such a big deal over it.”
“No, Draco!” Draco recoils at the harshness of his tone, moving away from his lap and curling up on the other side of the couch, watching him with the wariness of a startled cat. Harry sighs, placing his head back onto the couch and rubbing the bridge of his nose tiredly. “I’m sorry, I just…can we
Instead he watches as Harry drops the sushi right before it touches his lips. He bangs a fist on the table. “Fuck!” Several patrons stop their chattering to stare quizzically in their direction. Thankfully, Muggles tended not to stare too long at their oddness and resumed dining as normal.
She gasps, frozen in place. Then she’s standing up, the bottom half of her silk purple dress soaked. “Fuck, Blaise stop laughing! My water broke!”
He thinks he needs to figure out this shite with Astoria lest he finds himself living in an empty home sooner than he expected.
“Astoria?” Her words fade away and she raises a hopeful brow. “Can we please stop talking about this?”
“I said no,” he defiantly crosses his arms over his chest. Malfoy looks murderous. “You’re my friend Malfoy and friends don’t let other friends cry in trees by themselves.” Maybe if he called Malfoy his friend enough times, it may actually become true.
So like always, he reacts, pulling at Malfoy’s hair and dragging them both down to the dry grass below. He’s a good deal lighter than before the accident and tumbles down far harder than Harry intended. After years of fighting with him, Harry had become accustomed to understanding Malfoy’s body and movements far better than he ever intended and he must say that this curvier, smaller version of his arch rival’s frame was far easier to fight against. Using this to his advantage, Harry pins him to the ground and lifts his fist in the air, his blood boiling far too much to remember just how
Both he, James, and Molly look on the verge of crying, but for completely different reasons. “But you loved Mum too! I’ve seen it, you can’t actually believe that you will be happier with him than with her?”
Birthed from the day’s dying sunlight is streaks of a vivid orange-pink that stains the evening sky. Next to him, brown skin turns a burning golden hue in the wake of its afterglow. A sigh quietly climbs up his throat. It’s criminal that Potter has no clue how gorgeous he looks like this.
Snape growls at him and Harry watches in amazement as all of the fight leaves Malfoy’s body. It was nice to see someone with the ability to tame him.
She laughs. “You should be. I listened, only because I was wondering if this person he was telling me about was really Draco Malfoy or some bored Polyjucier. He told me everything, even down to the littlest details, like about how you obsessively check the time on that black Muggle watch Parkinson gifted you because you always stressed the importance of being on time. And I thought, ‘who knew me and Malfoy would ever have something in common?’ You have to admit, it was a bit shocking to consider, that we may actually be alike in some ways. I take punctuality very seriously as well.”
But for some reason, Harry always knew that he would enjoy waking up the feeling of a hot mouth around his cock. Though he’d never known that he would love waking up to the feeling of
“Dad!” Scorpius yells across from the school yard, waving to him with Albus in tow. “You coming?” The finger pointed in Harry’s chest retracts. Right, they were supposed to meet Ron, Hermione, and their kids for lunch. Not have pointless arguments in front of their sons’ school.
It was during one of those face tightening, narrowed eyed staredowns they shared when Scorpius suggested the most ridiculous proposal.
“I was thinking more along the lines of happy, but that works too.” He presses a gentle kiss on his shoulder, distracting him as he
He thinks he can say that he’s never been the most obvious character, but it was easy enough for Blaise and Pansy to figure it out in school. Who’s to say Potter hasn’t either?
had been pressed up against Harry’s body in much the same fashion Ginny’s were before they broke up. But obviously, she wasn’t squeezing the life out his throat whenever she did.
Though to be fair, he and Harry haven’t done anything wrong. Draco knows he’s married and he’s been purposeful in keeping his secret crush on him under wraps.
Panicked, Harry scrambles away from the tree. “No! I swear I wouldn’t do that!” Not unless Malfoy had given him explicit permission to do so of course.
“Maybe I’m just better than you.” Harry narrows his eyes. “It pays to be a snob,” Draco shrugs. It also pays to go to a racially diverse Charm School.
Draco smirks up at the tiled ceiling. “I find that it can help motivate some people.” By some people, he most definitely only means Harry Potter.
'Je t'aime ma bien aimée' roughly translates to 'I love you my beloved' but correct me if I'm wrong. I can barely speak English on good days, much less French. Also, so sorry for the impromptu Pygmy Puff smut lmao. On a personal note, I have finally finished reading the Chamber of Secrets for the first time!
“Cheers,” he throws the shot back, the burn searing as it travels down his throat and stomach. He tips the cup back for Blaise to pour him another one, needing more spirits to ease his ten year virginal pain. Brown liquor will always have a place in his heart and Blaise knows exactly what he likes.
Potter leans in far closer than he needs to, looking around to make sure no one is around. “Can you keep a secret?” Draco backs away, not liking how this was sounding. Potter catches his hand and pulls him before he can scamper out of the room. He winces good-naturedly. “Too much?”
“Oh don’t I know it,” Ana laments with a weary sort of humor, “My husband’s terrible at remembering to lock the car.” In the distance, a child's echoed screams about being shoved grabs her attention and she gives them both an exasperated smile. “I’ll add you down and send you all the information by tonight, Draco.”
Malfoy has his hair in a braid today and Harry wants to do nothing more than set the bloody thing on fire.
He'd almost forgotten about her entirely until she reappears next to him, bending down and holding out a glass of cool water to his cracked lips.
Draco takes Harry’s tie in his fist, using it to lower his lips downward. “I wasn’t laughing at you,” he bites his lip and sniggers softly into Harry's shirt collar. “Okay I was, but it’s not just you, you know.”
Instead of snapping at him for bringing up the eventful morning that caused all of this mess, Draco surprises them both by laughing. Potter sucks in a breath at the sound and his fingers clench around his elbow.
His own breathing stutters at the thought of Draco, all alone in the Slytherin dormitory, touching himself with Harry’s name falling from his panting lips. His voice doesn't sound like his own when he says, “You, Draco Malfoy, are a complete arsehole.”
or something. He goes up a step so that they’re on the same level. “You think you know every fucking thing—”
Draco climbs down the stairs that aren’t really his own, but are beginning to feel like his. With soft footfalls, he finds Harry curled on the couch, reading a Muggle book Pansy had gifted him from her collection.
“I think,” Hermione says after the waitress places their tabs on the table, “If Harry’s managed to move on, then perhaps we can too. Agreed?”
Harry sighs in his ear. “Fine. Just don’t do nothing crazy, alright? Al may not be coming back next year but I will.”
Right, he should have waited several minutes before storming into the school. Apparition was useful but drew unnecessary suspicion in the Muggle world.
It was dreadfully hard trying not to talk about Scorpius, who consumed his life presently. Consequently, they couldn’t talk about the past either, one that was still heavy and tattooed on Draco’s skin and still scarred and evident on Harry’s forehead.
He can hear Harry swallow above him. “Fuck Draco, don’t do that. Stop.” His cock was telling him otherwise as it pressed into his abdomen.
“Hands above the waist Malfoy!” Hisses Ron as he and Hermione dance several feet next to them. Hermione grumbles about minding his own and they harmlessly bicker about the importance of privacy.
He’s been sitting on his roof for what feels like years, trying to best formulate a response to Astoria’s Patronus message. Destructive anger is his first reaction. Not responding is his second. Yet Draco knows that there was no ignoring Finley and Astoria Greengrass.
She cups her cold, dainty hand under his chin, lifting it just enough so that their eyes meet. “Draco dear?”
After years of practice, the spell comes naturally to him. “How do you feel?” He hardly even needs to ask because he can feel Harry’s body tensing under his fingers.
“I think you’re cunning,” he says suddenly. “And funny. And far smarter than me at most things.” Malfoy raises a brow in genuine shock. Harry pushes forward. “You appreciate small gestures. Sometimes you’re actually pretty nice too.” The blonde rolls his eyes, a faint smile on his lips. “And… and I forgive you.” Malfoy looks startled enough for him to leave the rest of what he thinks about him unsaid.
“Let’s maybe try storming away to get shagged when you’re sober, yeah?” Blaise grunts out as he places Draco’s limp body back into his seat.
Once Princess is settled and nestled comfortably in his fuzzy blanket, Draco returns to his office, picking up the papers one by one and putting them back in neat, even rows. He takes several steps back to ensure that each row is orderly. Everything is just how it should be except for one non-Princess touched paper. Unable to let a single paper be out of place, Draco moves to straighten it, the loosen corner revealing his own neat handwriting on the paper it was covering.
He scoots closer to Draco, his arms wrapped around his body; the cold seeping through the fabric of his thin jumper. Draco wraps his arms around him. He presses his nose into his son’s soft, lemon-scented hair. This was okay. He’s never needed anyone, not really. Not Astoria, or his father, or Potter. All he needs is Scorpius. If he was the only gift the universe ever decided to bestow upon him, Draco would gladly live with that.
Classroom or not, he needed Harry. Classroom or not, he was going to indulge in the gorgeous man in front of him like it was his magic-given right.
“Oh bloody fuck!” Tears spring into his eyes and Draco wraps his thick braid around his mouth to avoid shouting more expletives. He hadn’t cast the strongest silencing charms beforehand, his eagerness affecting his spellwork. It didn’t help he did it wandless either.
Harry scratches the back of his head awkwardly, remembering how Goyle was fixing his trousers as he scurried out of the library. “Yeah, I kinda saw that one myself.”
Draco feels his back tense uncomfortably at the question. How could he eloquently tell him that he was starved for sex with a man that would rather discuss Pygmy Puff sperm than bend him over a desk? He groans.
He hisses in pain through his laughter. “Ugh, but my head really does hurt.” He rubs the spot in an attempt to soothe the throbbing. They had to stop degrading themselves by shagging in closets.
His mouth thins into a small, tight line and Draco chews at the inside of his bottom lip, nervous if what he was about to suggest was allowed. “Why don’t you try explaining your P—”
She hadn’t even given him a second glance as she dumped the book on his desk. It’s been sitting there for the past week and a half, collecting dust. He wanted desperately to ask her if she knew something that he didn’t, or if it was merely just a book that she recommended to him without any hidden meaning. But that would require telling her about
He supposes his date tonight was handsome enough, though Draco couldn’t quite get past the obviously bleached blonde hair, cut stylishly around his heart-shaped face. He looked far too much like a young, angry man that Draco once knew. Granted, though his own braided hair was now long enough to touch the curve of his waist, he wasn’t in the business for dating someone who looked like him, despite his family’s propensity for incest.
He’s heard of it. Grans Westforth would probably hex Draco to pieces for his war crimes. Probably not hex. No, he would just shoot Draco on sight with one of those Muggle guns. He probably detested his own magic and the wizarding world more than those sodding relatives of Harry’s. His entire theories involved disproving magical ones and uplifting Muggle science. An incredible researcher in the astrology field but batshite crazy if you ask Draco.
A familiar looking wry grin appears on Scorpius’ face as he twirls his spaghetti noodles into a large circle around his fork. He holds up a forkful and stares at it with an unimpressed expression, very similar to the one he wears whenever he smells red sauce and noodles coming from the kitchen. “Says the dad who only made spaghetti for the past ten days. I think we all have our flaws.”
Draco bursts out into peals of laughter because it was all so ridiculous. The feeling of Harry’s lips is still ghosting along the skin of his pleasantly swollen lips, a distinct tingling feeling that makes his giddy laughter slightly hysterical from the natural high of happiness. It feels good;
Harry jumps, turning around and meets Pansy Parkinson’s knowing green eyes. He fumbles the Potion’s textbook in his hands that he hadn’t put away in his haste on to the floor. He quickly grabs it off the ground and scrubs his pinking face.
Draco’s grin widens and he can tell Harry was thinking the same thing. “Is it just me, or do they seem a little…well, you know.” He raises his brows expectantly.
Scorpius calls every adult ‘sir’ or ‘ma’am’, remembers every one of his Charm School manners to a fault, and steals Molly’s heart when he asks if there’s anything he could help with. Draco couldn’t be prouder. He watches, trying to think of a good gift for him for being so beautifully well behaved.
Harry, who looks far too pleased to be introduced this way, takes Jaspers’ pudgy hand and gives it a hardy shake. “Yes, yes I am.” Draco rolls his eyes, unable to help from smiling softly as Harry continues to puff up with pride.
Harry cups his face with his hands, running his thumbs down his wet cheekbones. “I’m sorry to inform you, but you are stuck with me Draco Malfoy.” White teeth appear from his full grin, “So you can be as depressed or angry or crazy as you want because I’m not going anywhere.”
His first, terrifying thought was that it was Astoria, demanding for him to bring Scorpius back to Paris just so she can neglect him. But the other, more rational part of him remembers that even if she came through the Floo, Scorpius was with his mother, so there was no reason to be scared, even if she tries to hex him. After enduring his Aunt Bellatrix’s version of punishments, Draco learned how to take quite a bit of pain from hexes. Astoria couldn’t do any worse than her.
“It’s no use, Harry. Do you think she hasn’t seen you ogling Malfoy like the rest of us? Blimey mate, you’re probably the worst out of everyone. Always watching him walk out of a room and staring at him. I mean, it’s really no different than before, but once Hermione’s made up her mind about something then, well, you know.”
cauldron.” He slowly brings a black potion cauldron across the floor of the classroom, where it was hidden from view. He
He can practically feel Potter thinking as they finished their respective meals in silence. His brows were screwed together and his eyes had that far off, wandering look to them. He’s tempted to offer a Knut for his thoughts, but he decides to settle with silence instead. Silence can be good too, with the right people. Or person.
Draco rolls his eyes. Whatever. His cooking was low hanging fruit. That hadn’t stung in the slightest…
Harry grips Draco by the shoulders. He shakes him a little, as if trying to shake some sense into that ridiculously gorgeous and brilliantly intelligent head of his. That gorgeous and brilliant head that could befriend Hermione Granger, understand every word that comes out of her mouth and challenge her as an intellectual equal. Surely, Harry wanting to respect his boundaries shouldn’t be too difficult of a concept for him to understand.
“Oh Draco, you actually don’t have to give me one,” Luna says, lowering her collar to show her own pink, glowing amulet. “I have one of my own.”
“I just don’t get it Draco. Everyone knows that he wouldn’t intentionally push Al out of that tree—”
“He did,” Draco says gravelly. “A certain someone is going to have a very unsightly wardrobe malfunction in a few minutes and I’ll need your help to point it out to the rest of the room as loudly as you can. Do you think you can do that?”
Draco’s dressed in his usual posh clothing, though for some reason, the fabrics seemed to cling onto his skin far more than he was used to them doing. Harry looked stiff and uncomfortable in his crisp light blue buttoned-up, with even his hair looking unnaturally overdone from a plethora of hair grooming spells. His shiny new leather shoes squeaked with each movement of his feet and with the thick silence between them, Draco had counted 29 squeaks in total.
“Ice cream?” Fuck, he’s never touching Firewhiskey again. From now on, his only escape from reality will be through smoking gillyweed.
The insatiable urge to point that Draco was not one of those poor, unfortunate souls, is quelled only with the reminder that he had better things to do than argue with some Hufflepuff kid about how he chose to address him.
When Malfoy finally drags himself up off the ground, the cheers from the noblest of Gryffindor students are drowned out by the overwhelming laughter from both houses. Throwing the Snitch down, Harry nearly swallows his tongue at the sight of Malfoy’s dripping arms held tightly across his chest and his normally pale cheeks bursting with color. He looks so startled, so young and vulnerable as he stands trying to cover his soaked chest from the leers and wolf-whistles. Several Gryffindor blokes are openly drooling at him like wild animals while the Slytherins opt for sly smirks and cheeky cackles.
Just five minutes. He’s taken the Calming Draught and he’ll be fine. He’ll get through this, just like everything else.
Harry raises a brow. Okay fine, maybe Malfoy wasn’t always planning some devious plot to take down Hogwarts from the inside. He couldn’t be doing much just sitting in the Library and studying for his N.E.W.T.s. He glances over at the Slytherin, watching as he takes meticulous notes from the History of Potions book.
Just below the shortest skirt Harry had ever seen, Malfoy’s milky-skinned thighs looked soft and supple, exuding femininity as he prowled over to the Slytherin table. He shows off every curve of his lithe body to all four tables before reaching his. When he passes the Gryffindor table, he gives Harry a sly wink and tosses his hair over his shoulder. Harry wanted to do nothing more than wipe that self-assured smirk off of his face. It’s like he was delighted to show off as much of his creamy skin as possible.
Still, because he had a reputation to uphold, he says, “I wish you would have told me that you turn into a sappy Hufflepuff after sex.”
“And me? Should I forgive him? For… for everything?” Broken noses, dead friends, marked arms. There seemed to be too much to forgive Draco Malfoy for.
meant to be ingested by any sane human. But Harry looks so entranced by him suggestively sucking his finger that he finds himself disregarding the taste just to see him look so wonderfully flustered.
“Merlin, must you let everyone know? And to be fair, I was only like seven!” He groans. “I guess my father should have known by then that I’ll never bring home a nice Pureblood witch.”
From the look on Harry’s face, Draco wonders if he should stop speaking before the sushi makes a reappearance. “I think I’m having a… fuck, what are those crises called?”
Most of the research that is presented to the board is meant to be put into practice or taught in Hogwarts. And most of his could be if the Ministry wasn’t so reluctant to take the advice of an ex-Death Eater.
“I…you look…” Harry blinks several times. Takes his glasses off and purposely cleans them before hastily depositing them back onto his nose.
“—And be a sweeter than a treacle tart to every goddamn Weasel that scurries through those doors on Sunday.”
He snorts. “Merlin, I hope not, because I plan on kissing you for as long as you’ll allow me to.” His thumb brushes over his bottom lip, moving back and forth across the smooth expanse.
Her fair features crumpled in weariness. “Okay Draco.” She rubs her bare arm bashfully, letting silence fill the room until she admits in a quiet voice, “I have been. Getting help, that is. It’s not so bad or so shameful once you just do it.”
Harry gapes. “What?! Just because I’m advising you to stop making lewd comments about Malfoy’s body around your
Ron shudders when Harry calls him Draco. It still weirded him out to hear. “Trust me mate, I wanted to—”
He lets her walk him to the Floo in the other room, and he gives her pieces to start to know him again—how he hates spaghetti because he makes it too much and only pretends to like astronomy because he doesn’t want to disappoint him. That Malfoy snarkiness that sometimes reminds Draco too much of himself. His new glasses and his strange fondness for a certain dark-haired child. He doesn’t mention that they were living in Muggle London or about Scorpius’ Muggle schooling. If Finley was still around, Draco might not make it out of France alive.
The liquor sloshes uncomfortably in his stomach at the mention of his best friends’ sex life. “It’s not about that. In fact… I don’t think I would ever want to know anything about that.”
She guffaws. “Funny how I could ask you the same thing Scarhead.” She bites her lip and curses underneath her breath. “Ugh, with the way Draco’s going, I guess I won’t be able to call you that much longer.”
“You hardly have to explain yourself to me. If you don’t want to, we don’t have to. There’s nothing wrong with that.”
“Though have I told you that I love your eyes too? And that little mole in the hollow of your collarbone? And how much you care about Scorpius?”
Following Potter’s pointed finger at least twenty eyes turn to him, catching Draco just as he was lifting to his feet to slip out of this hellish reality. Twenty pairs of eyes freeze him in place.
She hums, closing her eyes in understanding. “Muggle horoscopes are famed for their accuracy and predictability. There are theories that magic can actually convolute a horoscope’s assessment. Haven’t you heard of the Westforth Theory, Draco?”
He can’t help it, Draco bursts out into laughter in the middle of the hallway. More parents filter in, looking at him curiously as he laughs away. “Oh, come on, there’s no harm in that!”
losing to Slytherin.” She leaves like she came to him, red hair glistening in the sun like a fiendfyre and swinging loosely in a ponytail.
It’s rather fascinating to watch, like witnessing the first moments before someone falls or observing the tense seconds before a fight between animals. He can’t tear his eyes away from it. How quickly he forgets that both he and Potter have more in common then they think.
Ginny set her jaw and addressed him with sympathetic eyes. “That’s up to you Harry. Forgiveness isn’t everything. It’s hard and uncomfortable and sometimes painful. But it’s a clean start and trust me, I think you could use one with him. He’s not the only one who has to apologize, you know?”
He just watched Draco Malfoy give fellatio on a sausage and now he was close to coming in his pants.
“Am I not allowed to speak with the Chosen One anymore? You wound me, Potter.” He snickers at Harry’s unamused face. He turns his full attention on scrubbing, reasoning that like a pesky dog, Malfoy was sure to go away once he sees that he won’t offer him any more attention.
Marcéline is much better company anyway, her toothless smile so heartbreakingly adorable that Draco doesn’t even notice Pansy whispering in Harry’s ear.
His hands don’t leave his braid, fingers playing with the smooth, curved tail end of it. Maybe Potter was just naturally a touchy-feely person. Maybe not everything
Harry nods dumbly, still taking it all in. “I see that.” He gingerly touches Draco’s cheek. It was really him, all angular features and pale definition. His fingers trace the path from his temple down to the cut of his cheekbones, to the curve of Cupid’s bow before finally settling on the handsome point of his chin. “Am I the first person who’s seen you like this?” He hopes so. He wants to be the first person to see Draco Malfoy’s handsome face after over a month of living without it.
At the very least, it must be gratifying for her. He’s tortured her relentlessly in school, so maybe this feels like a reward on her end. Though Harry swears that she holds no ill feelings towards him, Draco just can’t seem to believe that anyone not named Luna Lovegood has the ability to be so forgiving.
Potter has him stuck, he can’t move, can’t breathe, can hardly even think. His mind is whirling, the feeling of Potter touching his braid,
He tells Harry this when he makes his way back around to Draco his sixth time since he forced him to mingle with the others. One would think someone just stunned him at the question. “Molly Weasley does
The last and most poignant advice his mother told him: Nothing is off-limits. With that in mind, he goes for the jugular.
Wow I can’t believe this is the last official chapter. It feels like just yesterday I was neglecting my Astronomy homework to write this (pls think twice before taking Astronomy, especially in college, worst shit I’ve ever taken). Thank you all for being such wonderful readers and continually making my day with your comments, kudos, etc. I always had a fear of posting my work online and y’all have exceeded my expectations for this story. And if you’re wondering, yes, there will be an epilogue posted soon :)
Suddenly, it doesn’t seem too far-fetched that Hermione and Malfoy may genuinely be compatible in a friendship. Besides being the two top scoring students in their year for ages now, Hermione’s face almost always lights up like Malfoy’s when Ron gifts her with a new book to read.
Draco grits his teeth. “No.” And he doesn’t want to hear about Potter’s Hogwarts adventures. One, because he doesn’t give a damn, and two because he wasn’t going to sit here and listen to his son idolize Harry fucking Potter.
A manicured hand is placed over his mouth before he could continue speaking, pewter eyes scanning the room nervously as they dance. Everyone else seems too preoccupied with their dancing partner to notice, though several Gryffindors and Slytherins shoot confused looks their way.
Harry slings his arm around his waist, jostling the items in his hands. “Draco, it’s fine. I went through extensive therapy. Not to
Every turn, twirl, tumble is followed with Malfoy following suit. His strategy today seems to be trying to trip Harry up as much as possible by being an annoying little pest. Which is, ironically enough, his usual strategy outside of the Quidditch field.
“No promises,” Draco quipped, though he knew that he had developed an unusually strong stomach from his Hogwarts years. But maybe he
Harry looks as though he had no sodding clue what Draco was babbling about, but he nods anyway in vague understanding, sitting down on his knees next to him in the middle of Muggle London and rubbing his back with soothing strokes.
Potter wipes several tears from his eyes, his body doubled over and nearly choking on his laughter. It would serve him right to choke. “This is brilliant! I thought you had it bad last night when you begged me for ice cream and gillyweed but this is perfect!”
“It’s funny, because it was only when I was about to become the one thing I wanted to be most, I failed.”
Harry gnashes his teeth. “I’m sorry but Malfoy started it! Had he just let me borrow his notes in class I—”
Draco pushes him away, even though his arms feel like noodles as he rams into Potter’s hard chest. “Don’t pretend you care about my son,” he spits. Stumbling away, he finds a nice spot on the ground to sit on, resting his head on what must be the cool glass of a shop window.
Harry stops himself at the last moment from laughing again. Draco, who could go on half hour long soliloquies about how bloody perfect his male genitals were and could make even the most dirty-minded person blush with his thoughts, somehow can’t talk about sex with Harry without using virginal euphemisms like ‘doing it’. It was alarmingly cute.
Hmm...posting every Wednesday seems a bit tedious for a ten chapter fic. Let's shoot for every other day instead.
has to learn how to cook something else), looks at him with intrigued eyes. He chews, pointing his mouth then to the pamphlet, in a silent reiteration of his previous question.
Harry grabs his arm, whipping him around before Draco can shove him away. His scowling, full lips land on his, kissing him with as much vitriol as he did snarking at him. Glasses digging into his skin, he kisses him until he can’t breathe and Draco does the same, not wanting to be the first to lose.
He hardly listens to the rest of the parents as they share their job descriptions. He’s done it. He’s spoken to a large crowd without freaking out. Maybe this was overkill, but Draco thinks he deserves a nice, long shag for today. He smiles at Harry, who gives him a tight-lipped smile in return.
It turns out, it could be very bad indeed. Despite his previous estimation of his luck for the day, Draco’s day is awful, to say the least.
With a flick of his wand, the wallet in his hung cloak pocket comes flying and he dumps a fat wad of Muggle notes onto the table. “Here. Order yourself some of that triangle food.”
“But Merlin was it worth it,” he sighs in awe. “You could go to the peaks of Chile and still not find a sky as clear as this.” No, only his little slice of the sky is this clear and this perfect.
