But yet—this tete a tete with his Mum was horrid. Beyond awful.
“Naturally. Not an utter git, no. I’m perfectly alright. Ace.”
"Working extra hard,” Draco smirked. "And extra long. Silly head."
“R-Right, stop it.” Draco got his head together and ordered Harry, as staunchly as he could manage whilst awkwardly wrestling with the gawping, sniffling idiot intent on simultaneously clinging leech-like and also scrambling frantically to get as far away as possible. It was bloody confusing as fuck and he was flat out of patience. “That’s bloody enough of that, alright?” Merlin, he’d dearly love to snog Harry again but not like this--never like this. He grasped Harry's biceps and gave him a shake instead, scowling. “
Perhaps because it was Malfoy suggesting it, and he'd not once shown any real honest-to-Merlin enthusiasm for a single game the bored Eight Years played every single Friday night like clockwork in the communal Common Room, solely as an excuse to imbibe heavily, snog sloppily and play 'Shag 'N' Swap' as the evening waned. He'd participated, of course. Naturally, as he absolutely hated to lose, and had even won various rounds of the many old chestnuts of group gaming. He was especially skilled at Muggle poker and could deal a mean hand of Hearts. He was rumoured to live up to his reputation as 'Slytherin Sex God', as well, which led to his being rather sought after as a partner for those aforementioned Shag 'N Swaps.
Harry Potter—that's a fucking lie!
“No, no, no. This is nonsense, utter rot. You’re raving. You’ve cracked. The pressure has clearly been too much. Grimmauld sprouting surprise nursery floors, you blathering on about thinking your mad house elf’ was a decent roommate to you? It's too much, Harry.”
“And I,
"Give it to me, Malfoy!" Harry ordered him, hissing the command 'round the edges of their sealed mouths. "Show me!" It was just like Parseltongue, the sod. "Hate me all you like, but!" And Harry knew exactly what effect Parseltongue had on Draco's libido. Rabid wasn't the half of it. "Give me your cock, you contrary bastard!"
Pronunciation – ahn -sooze
Really. It could. And Father…well, Father would get over himself or get stuffed. Mum would ensure it.
He didn't have the faintest idea of what had set Draco off. One moment they'd been snogging comfortably, all wrapped up together in an armchair before the hearth, the next Draco had slipped sinuously down the length of Harry's very relaxed person and ended up on the floor. He'd gone through a little gyrating dance balanced upon his kneecaps, digging through his pockets madly for a little box, and then stared up at Harry as if he—Harry- were something strange—something frightening, and enough to terrify even the most doughty of Wizards.
Harry scowled down at the crinkled eyelids and the shoulder turned toward him. Draco abruptly rolled neatly away, grunting and taking nearly all the quilt with him.
"You—yours! Oh-ahhggh!" Harry's head thumped that stone, the one that lurked viciously beneath every picnic rug in existence, and it hurt. He didn't mind it. "Please—yours—oh, Merlin—Draco!"

“That’s
It was dimmer in Draco’s room but the hallway sconces allowed in an ambient low-level light through the door Harry had left wide open and his eyes had mostly adjusted. Harry had straightened out his silly spectacles, spelling them unsmudged. They could see each other well enough, Draco supposed--not that he particularly wanted to see his flatmate under these trying circumstances. He’d managed to lull himself to sleep without giving in to the indignity of sniveling over their little row and, while it was flattering that the git felt bad about being one, it still wasn’t particular pleasant, being dragged out of lovely REM, sobbed at, strangled, struck and then scolded.
Also, a curious point had been raised in Harry’s mind, at least. If Malfoy’s hair was that…fascinating, what about the rest of him?
"Nrgh-ah! What's—what's—whoo—whoa!" Potter halted in his tracks, gawping, arms akimbo.
"Yes!" Harry exclaimed. He waved a hand down at his pink-cheeked lover. "Yes! Clearly, Hermione!"
"Yes, Mistress." Padma batted her eyelashes seductively. "As you command."
Seamus considered; he must’ve agreed because he shook hands, grinning.
Draco blushed, also rather gobsmacked.
“He’s rather fit, isn’t he? Potter?”
And then
the voice demanded, after a telling pause. Harry detected a distinct sob at the end of it, tacked on like punctuation
"Ready?" he breathed and Harry nodded after a slight pause; he'd had to pry his eyes open to focus on Draco before he could do so.
“…What?”
personally.”
"Harry! It's not as if you know for certain she's a bitch. Be nice," Hermione scolded. "Besides, her parents gave that ring for her coming-of-age, Harry. It's an heirloom—the Greengrass White Emerald It means nothing—she's just being Slytherin, as no one outside of school's seen it. They'll hardly be assuming she's engaged—and the Greengrasses and the Malfoys have been family friends forever and an age. That was a party, Harry. There were other people there, not just Draco."
"Oh?" Draco nodded encouragingly, all ears and eyeballs. "Do tell, Mum. What sort of power, precisely? Because I don't want Harry to be placed in any sort of danger. No nasty surprises, please. We've had more than our fair share of those."
The smile was positively terrifying; what did she know that he didn't? His Mum only blinked at him sweetly.
Then he stopped, stymied.
super, wasn't it?" Dsraco mused, nestling against his sagging boyfriend. "I mean to say, it was absolutely mind-blowing, completely phenomenal and I
—don’t encourage him, Harry! This is my last clean robe till the weekend and the laundry elves are on Hermione’s bloody alternating Friday SPEW holidays, remember? Have a bleeding care, will you? Would hurt to save your shenanigans for Quidditch.”
Nothing could, it seemed, not even Gryffindors. There were hordes of them, just as he'd feared, and they were certainly curious and not at all timid about quizzing Potter as to why he'd chosen Draco Malfoy, of all people, to accompany him to Hogsmeade. There were a few that were furious, as well: the gingers, male and female, and the Granger, who glared at him beady-eyed. But a quiet word from Potter and the chaperone's continual presence seemed to keep any outright aggression under control and Draco wasn't molested—too much—as he strolled along with Potter. It was hardly ideal, and not what he'd really wanted, but still…they had the day before them, and no reason to hide their 'togetherness'.
"Then," the voice snapped grudgingly. "If it means so much to you, make me. Make…me, Potter."
It was…creepy.
“Yes, you git!” Harry replied, and sank his hands into Draco’s trailing robe lapels, hauling him closer by main force. “Now, more—and faster! Quickly, as he’s likely coming!”
And that idea had Harry biting his lips to keep from grinning.
of them will, damn it to Merlin, and his name's Harry Potter! This shall not continue, not on my watch!!”
“Oh, Merlin!” Harry panted, caught up in see-saw sliding. His arse felt so amazingly brilliant, it should be a sin. “Oh—oh—
"Urk!"
"Malfoy," Harry said patiently, "Malfoy, that's exactly the sort of behaviour I want to stop. And my idea will work, I promise. They won't be left a leg to stand on."
It, um, added up, really. In Sixth he'd dogged Malfoy like a beagle, all righteous and suspicious and nasty-feeling inside. Now Malfoy dogged him—though he clearly didn't mean to—and Harry was suffering appropriately.
"Draco."
Draco's shoulders hunched as they turned, presenting his spine and the broad beams of his straight back to Harry as he prepared to march off; the tendons that held his head at that trademark arrogant angle stiffened. Harry knew he'd been heard; surely he'd been heard, but…Draco was a stubborn arse and he couldn't afford not to say it again.
Draco wailed soundlessly.
"Don't play the fool, Harry," Draco muttered, biting at Harry's bared earlobe. His was a dark, nasty growl, one that sent chills straight up Harry's spine. "You know as well as I do what you've gone and done just now. You've changed everything.
The voice was sharp and snappish-rueful.
They were laughing.
"Harry!"
It was hateful, the way his face felt these days, since Harry had left him. He looked years older than the twenty-two birth days he'd celebrated so far. His mirror had advised him he looked downright peaky earlier, cooing with real concern over his dispirited state. Bloody mirror. Decades older, it reported. Likely the exact opposite of the self-confident, boldly successful young Wizard his unexpected but maybe useful guests had seen last (on the evening of the happy occasion of Harry's birthday party, Day 241.) Back then he'd been his usual self: charming, debonair, coolly composed and sharp of tongue, but with a silly party hat stuck on. There'd been champagne and cake in abundance and his own close mates visiting as well as Harry's, all gathering for a do. Like old home week at Hogwarts, but better, lots better. Because back then Harry had still lived in this drab flat, breathing life into it, into
“Oh no! That’s bad luck, Draco,” Hermione exclaimed, sending ‘round drinks and crisps as they settled round the cozy kitchen dining nook in the Granger-Weasley house. She frowned thoughtfully off into the middle distance. “Hmm, I wonder if it’s not an infestation of some kind. Doxys and Imps have been particularly bad this year, for instance. And you both know Ron's been working on--”
mean? Come back here at once!
“Well, then, I will.”
"But, I—"
"DRACO!"
"But?"
"Ronaaaald?" Granger trilled suddenly, her bushy head slewing about to face her seatmate. "Oh….Ronnikins?"
Of course he'd been heard, loud and clear. Harry knew
Particularly to those two gits, the ones watching them-Harry's bloody mates.
"Right, alright.
"Nhgh! Nghhh...! Neep!" Granger was actively hyperventilating, sharp brown gaze glazed over; Draco's nipples were so distended they could poke holes through the worn fabric and the Weasley git was speechless, which was vastly preferable. "Harry?" Granger gasped. "Ma-Malfoy?"
Draco didn't so much as take a breath, didn't exhale. He stayed right where he was, immobilized in Harry's bloody brand new armchair and watched Harry watching his every move intently, with lips just as tight and mostly bloodless, and
"I'm in," Nott perked up, quietly. "Say a fiver to start?"
Of all the possible outcomes imaginable, Harry had not expected this one. Oh, no—
. We've nothing. We're
“Erk! Har—ack!”
“Fuck me,” Draco bit out, snatching up his discarded quill and absently rending off half the fletching in one go. “And we dare call ourselves Aurors, you and me.”
"Er…nothing. Sorry."
"D'youwanttogotoHogsmeadewithmetomorrow?"
"But, I don't know where we're going! That's not fair, Potter!"
Draco shrugged and grinned tensely, showing a bit more teeth than he normally would with his old friend as he turned to face the heath floo. Harry’s prolonged fling with Wood during their latter university days had always annoyed him for some reason. But then again everything annoyed him at the moment, given his lack of sound sleep and his atrociously impertinent mansion, and this deep dive into Harry's past romances wasn't really the fare he'd been expecting, at least not on a first visit. His earlier pleasure at the prospect of dinner together felt all at once faded and dingy.

“Oi, Potter! Wait up!”
“Oh, yeah. Um, oops!” Harry flushed, nodding apologetically at Nev even though he was in no way guilty; that had all been Ron, the demon. Still, Harry hated to rile his dormmate, who was still a bit accident-prone. Why make Nev’s life yet more difficult? He’d enough on his hands, dealing with Ron’s little sister. “Sorry about that, mate. Won’t happen again.”
No. More a treasure trove only he knew of:  a secret garden, like the one in the book Dudders despised so much. A vault only he had the key to. No…
“Ahem, so….Harry?”
“How could you? How could you even sow that horrible thought in his fucking fertile Gryffindor mind, Granger-Weasley? Talk about extreme measures! You

Because he was, of course. Driven off, by Harry himself.
"Mutual?"
Zabini snorted; Parkinson tittered madly and took a huge unladylike slurp from her glass of Firewhiskey.
"My dear boy." Narcissa Malfoy repressed a chuckle over the rather daft expression her usually keen-eyed son had plastered all over his handsome angular features. "There's the one thing, with your Grandme're's ring. Let's say I hope most sincerely you'll not hesitate too long before popping the fateful question? For there is this tiny, a very minor—ah!—let's call it a 'catch', shall we? In any case, you should be made aware of it, dear, before you do anything. Draco, love, that band possesses a certain power, you see, which is why I never wore it after your grandmother passed on."
That rocked Draco back on his heels, but in a good way.
"Ready, Potter? Such excitement."
"Ah." Draco sighed. That wasn't happening quickly, unfortunately. Kneazles had seemingly stolen his tongue, for all the good it doing him. "Hmm."
Go see Pansy? Now?” Harry exclaimed, starting forward again, clearly upset and just as clearly about to come after him, likely with the intention of stopping him.
"Right, yes. So, anyway, I've been fathoms deep in the departmental backlog ever since, actually. Me and ah, the others. Who work here with me, that is. Haven't had a free second to call my own, not since I landed, other than a lightning visit with Teddy and Andromeda and lunch here in the café with Ron and Hermione. Everyone's so busy; I'd rather assumed you must be too. But Draco? What's with all the 'shhh-shing'? Why were you acting so strangely when you came through just now? Hermione told me there's been some rumours of trouble with the Manor but I never heard a word more about it, not even from Andromeda, and I'd've thought she'd have known if there was, because of being sisters with your mum. Is there? What’s it about? Is it a leftover Curse? Have you Owled Bill? I thought you'd have Flooed
"Two."
Draco’s omniculars were the best to be had in the Wizarding world; showed every single solitary detail, right up close. He could actually count Potter’s eyelashes, as the prat was flying goggleless today, the only protection for his uncommon eyes those awful spectacles. And the git’s pickle-toad-bog green eyes actually weren’t too bad to look upon, for a speccy berk. Pity one couldn’t see them all that well, behind those horrid ancient squareish frames and smudged lenses.
"Likely not," Draco agreed, nodding. "But she isn't quite what she used to be, is she?"
“Shut it, I said.
Harry grinned; all was well—in fact, all was fucking fantastic! Couldn't be better, really.
Draco’s poor heart was still racing, though; he felt as though he’d not taken a single breath through all of his rehearsed speech. He’d caught that faint pleased ‘Thanks again, mate!, followed by the ‘Later, Malfoy!’, though, despite owning eardrums that had set up a sudden deafening buzzing in his skull—but that sensation of floundering deaf and blind may’ve resulted from the blasted unreal amount of heat contained in their emptied-out classroom, deserted now but for him.
pined after me, then. Merlin, Potty. I think you've shattered my one rib."
, at least.
"Yes, a dog," she snapped back at him. "Or more like a donkey, maybe. An arse's end, anyway. You're too much, sometimes, Draco. You always overreact. You need to tone it down."
“Sure,” Harry obliged, glaring frostily at Ron. “Can I strangle him first, though? Before I ignore him? ‘Cause I can ignore him better when he’s quiet, Hermione.”
“Whoa, Malfoy!”
He should've done more, but he was so tired, so terribly fatigued by the very thought of it. Likely only because he was actually physically exhausted; he never slept well without Harry. He didn't know what to do, how—when—where?
—and admired his own on the way back to Slytherin, turning it this way and that in the torchlight.
The eyes of both Gryffindors swiveled to exam the bed. Draco noticed Weasley had developed a sudden facial tic and Granger seemed to be swaying, as if caught in a strong wind.
. He lifted a finger absently and spelled the brown mass of Hermione's hair smooth and flat again, and she ran an appreciative hand through her tresses with a small, intimate smile.
should have something—something visible that'll say it for us, right? So people won't be asking after us all the time and making stupid comments—"
"Mmmm-hmmm," Malfoy echoed agreeably, the sound a deep humming purr emanating from the chest Harry had so longed to lay hands upon. He smacked his reddened lips and blinked narrowed, hazy-pewter hued eyes when he finally drew back a scant inch to allow Harry a scant breath: a great feline, terribly pleased with the prey he'd chased down and conquered.
Draco winked. Distinctly, decidedly…purposefully.
! Draco exulted, and then caught himself mid-inner chortle, for Potter was a wanted man, as was he—oh, Salazar, as was
for once, git! Don't be sly! I don't get you! And don't talk about spells and potions when you mean something else entirely—I'm not a brick, you know. I can thnk for myself, thank you!"
He gulped, waiting anxiously for word of his fate. Eyed Harry pleadingly, his hope for a merciful release rising with every blink of those green eyes. But, no. Not that easy.
"Ye-yeah?" he asked, with barely enough breath in his laboring diaphragm to do so. "Promise?"
…And where had all his prior excitement gone?
"Sure, Potter," Draco scoffed. "Give up on the Golden Boy when you have even the slightest chance of bagging him? I don't think so."
Measly burns and tiny scrapes, trailing sleeves caught inconveniently in doorjambs, legs that were apparently permanently Jelly'd when confronted by smooth, flat, easily navigable surfaces—tile and wood and flagstone, it mattered not, Harry could trip somehow and make himself an idiot. Too, there were the accumulated awful and gormless acts of fumbling his wand no less than three times in ten minutes in DADA, and always—and only!—when Malfoy was assigned to be his partner. The embarrassment of stumbling down stairwells he could normally tread blindfolded on a moonless night; the sheer humiliation of repeatedly whacking his shins and his no longer-very-funny funnybone on stray bits of armour and statuary. All of these incidents and more (too minor to dwell on, really, like the tangles in his hair that panged his scalp something fierce when he brushed it) plagued Harry Potter continually. It was as though he'd been cursed, and was left doling out a sulky sort of blame to the oblivious git who was the prime cause of it all. So, yes, he still technically 'disliked' Malfoy for having this horrid effect upon him…but only with a wry, unwilling fond affection, in part fueled by a creeping sense of karmic justice.
"It was working. You loved-
“Leave Ron out of it, Malfoy! And do stop—you’re being ridiculous. Wanker.”
It had been, of course, too good to be true. Draco wasn't meant to feel this sort of enchanted happiness, this level of content. It was too late, as well—he'd never impressed Harry as being particularly worthwhile, before; he'd never succeeded in keeping his attention for all that long a time in all the days they'd spent challenging one another. Why would it be any different now? Materially?
"Draco?"
"Harry! Of course I care. Don't you dare say I don't, fucking Potter," Draco growled out bitterly, furiously pressing in as he bent his elbows, crowding Harry. The scent of him so close by nearly buckled Draco's knees, it had been so long. How many days now? And counting. Always counting. "Shut your mouth. Don't
"Er, d'you mind, Granger? I can pick them up later if you can't lay hands on them now. No hurry, really."
"Ah," Draco replied, with formidable restraint. "Well, are you hungry, then? I've kept some supper for you, git, if you are. Likely gone cold now—that was hours ago."
don't, thanks. Never did. So you, you go play your games with someone in your league because I'm off out. Had quite enough. Have been off out, this last se'enight—or haven't you noticed I'm not living there? I'm so gone. Been gone."
The moment happened to be century, of course. And Draco caught eird snatches of images here and there. Images now populated with a Harry in swift motion, travelling his mental byways and highways, peeking into all his covert spaces, his small joys and greater sorrows.
"Or your favourite brandy, dear—" Draco's Mum continued valiantly. "The Napoleon?"
"I see you," he whispered when Harry at last made another slight noise, like a 'pfft!' or a fond soundless scoff, but ever so softly it was almost nearly inaudible, and there was only disbelief hanging solemn, dark and cloudy, growing fast in the tiny space between their lips. "How can you think I don't? I always see you. I only ever see you—that's the worst bit of this, the utter worst. But, what? What, Harry? What did I do that was so fucking wrong? Why is it I can never--when I've always, always—and you. You, Harry. Harry."
He saw her nod quickly and turned his full gaze towards Ichika-san. She was visibly wobbly, ghastly as a ghost, but her spine remained ramrod straight and her wand pointed yet to supernovae star burning atop Luna’s.
“Pumpkin juice, Harry?” She stuck her hand upon his forehead, all casual-like. “You don’t say.”
Harry leaned closer, till their arms and flanks were pressed tight together. The loveseat they sat upon was starting to live up to its name. "Draco," he said, warning clear in his voice. "Tell me louder—so I can hear you."
What had been annoying, once, was now lovely—startlingly so. Strange what a daily application of come-and-kisses could do to alter a bloke’s perspective, wasn’t it?
"…Er?
he needed to stay, to

gift—his matching bracelet from Draco, the wonder of all wonders—was clasped firmly about his exposed wrist.
was so much rubbish, not worth his while. "Now push off. I hate you. Have I mentioned?"
"Ta, Mills," Harry replied, glancing up and giving her a weary but grateful smile. "That would be brilliant, if it's no trouble."
"Oh, no," he chuckled, when he'd caught his breath, gay and droll in the face of Draco's utter bewilderment. He gasped, stung to the quick. This was not his Harry; this stranger, all cold-eyed and flinching away as much as he could in close quarters. Laughing with no humour. "No, no,
Harry would insist that he
"Potter?" But he was so confused—what was Potter saying here? What did he want of Draco?
"Oh! Oh, fuck you, too, Potter!"
"What?"
Until they simply
Malfoy's tongue tasted quite as brilliant as the git smelt; it was on par with Turkish Delight, or with the first real Feast Harry had ever taken part of, years ago when he'd first arrived at Hogwarts, a half-starved child. It was the best part of every scrumptious dessert he'd ever eaten: the joy bite, the first and last savour of salt-tangy-sweet on his quivering taste buds. All that and more, wet and wild and tangling him up in infernal coils of delight as it twisted within him.
For once, this suggestion was not greeted by universal groans and piteous howls of 'No more bleeding Snap!' and 'Merlin, not Truth or Dare' again!' No one even dared mumble a naysay against 'Spin the Bottle', Parkinson's favourite, or Wizarding Chess, Weasley's.
Harry--who might not be Harry but instead that insufferable jokester Zabini--jumped up and made as if to approach Draco. Draco found himself retreating, backwards, and jabbing an accusatory finger at the arse-end who’d clearly got hold of one of Harry’s hairs and was impersonating him.
“’’Zactly, Hermione,” Harry harrumphed, vindicated. He frowned as he turned his eyes back to the object of his Auror-like observation, not liking her marked lack of enthusiastic agreement particularly much but not willing to waste time quibbling over it. On his other side, Ron continued to chew, eying Harry with high suspicion.
"Really, Potter," Malfoy sneered. "You're laying about like a bleeding gecko on a rug—swotting, alright, I hear you. But—tell me this, then. How can you possibly manage to injure yourself simply doing nothing worthwhile? You're just there and you take a book corner to the temple, Potter? Come on! Pathetic! That makes three times I've seen you harm yourself since breakfast. Are you damaged or what? Mental, maybe? You must be—you're pretty damned clueless, if I do say so myself."
They barely made sense to Harry; took ages to resolve into concepts he could follow.
“I know,” Harry mumbled, unwilling to look up. He dared not, truly, because Draco was very compelling, even when a person hadn’t been struck by a Truth spell. “Me, too. Yours, I mean. I mean, I feel the same way, about you.”
"Uh-huh," Abbot agreed, bobbing her head.
"Shush, Potter," Draco shut him up with a quick slip of whiskied tongue across his parted lips. "Shag N' Swap, later, remember? Meet me in mine, alright?"
"Hah!" he panted triumphantly. "There's another one, besides this," he added breathlessly, biting away at Harry's lips as he chatted. "Wanna know what it is, Harry?"
“…No. I…don’t, normally.” Where had all the oxygen gone? It was missing; Draco felt light-headed. “Why?”
"Wait! What?" Ron protested, but Granger was whispering furiously in his ear as the two of them pulled ahead, and in a minute, she glanced back at Harry and Draco, her smile a shade less tense, though still tentative. "There we go; alright now. An hour or so, okay, Harry? Then we'll meet up?"
"Wear. Mine. Too," Draco got hold of himself and repeated his request, deliberately drawing each short syllable out to its fullest. He pulled back a bit from their messy embrace, just enough to glare down at the stupid git who discombobulated him thoroughly at every turn and stile. "You have to promise to wear mine, too, Potter, or I won't do it. Understand, dimwit?"
“Nah, me neither,” Harry said promptly, reaching a hand out to lay over Draco’s. “I’d been missing so much, being abroad. Living in this flat with you is helping me to pay attention when I should, to you and to me. I suppose I really needed it, learning how to make time for me again. Being aware of someone else on a day-to-day basis, too. It’s been far too long since I did either of those things. I’m out of practice. Luna and I, we work very well together, she’s a dear friend and a fabulous Mage, but...it’s not the same. It never was.”
, you tit!' blowjob in Harry's mate's flat's hall closet—and Harry Potter, naïve git, had fallen into Draco's arms like a ripe plum from the bushes.
“I’m going to hex you both to little tiny pieces, you babbling baboons,” Draco threatened seriously. “You don’t know a good thing when you see it, do you? May I remind you Potter saved your fucking bums not long ago? Can you not show a little appreciation?”
For instance, he and the Weasel rubbed along only because the Weasel was a bloody fixture. If Draco attempted to oust him, Harry would likely drop Draco like a hot roasted tuber…well, perhaps not, but there'd be strong words between them, surely, and they wouldn't be pleasant words, either! Not that Draco would, naturally; Weasel was no threat to him, and neither was La Granger. In fact, he and La Granger managed rather well, mostly. To be horribly, openly brutal (and oh, how Draco hated admitting it, but Harry loved to hear it, the greedy, girly git), he and the Weasel had any number of items in common, now that their mutual 'thing' for Harry (granted, it was a different sort of

throb of their Hygieian. The triangular flight pattern they’d been maintaining all through became visible at last, a strong ribbon of green light springing to life and wrapping their wind-whipped forms together via their core heartlines. “Vires In Numeris--
“Sod off, git,” Nev scowled. “I can do it myself, thanks.”
“Yes, why?” Pansy chimed in, all spritely and sharpish. She folded her shapely legs under the hem of her very short skirt, tugging it down against the wind chill. “Do tell, darling?”
"Oh—no!" Harry gasped, for he was abruptly rendered starkers and it was chilly, out there on the tiny isle in the midst of the lake. "I—w-won't!"
“Wha-wha-wha-wha?”
Draco blinked. He nodded, politely.
"Har—"
love to accept, but he couldn't! Why ever couldn't Harry understand that?
"Stop that," he mumbled aloud, taking random whaps at Draco's chest with limp wrists and floppy fingers. "Grabby. And you didn't, either. You didn't know it at all."
“Malfoy, hey!”
Hermione, at the end, having crawled out to aid Ginny by manning the muffin basket, was practically forced to pour the largest full pitcher of iced pumpkin juice available over both of their heads to bring them to their senses. Or so she stated firmly, later, all giggles gone and firmly put aside…and then they were all three of them late to their various first lectures, as they had to adjourn to change robes and spell their book bags dry and free of breakfast.
Was a bracelet inside, not a ring. He was too afraid to purchase a ring, not knowing what Draco would say to it. Or perhaps it was more that he was terrified of how Draco would look when he opened it: taken aback that Harry had even presumed. Shocked, perhaps, and then…and then probably kindly cautious. Forgiving, even, his real response tucked well below the ingrained civility, the perfect mask.
"Er?" Potter wriggled a bit in Draco's grip, trying to get a decent look at Draco's burning cheeks and perhaps lip-read as well, because that last request of Draco's had come out all at once, without Draco's volition, and gods, but he was so very—
Of all things, why now?
But…Draco's sultry fond murmurings were sending Harry straight off to Nod; with a sigh, he surrendered, barely listening 'cept to know it was good, whatever it was Draco said, and he'd likely like it very much when it happened.
No time to brace, no time to inhale; no time, no time, no time! All was right now and fuck, yes! And Malfoy's brilliant grey eyes, burning into Harry's wide ones, the fingertips of one oily hand nearly poking Harry's eyeball out as his spectacles were ripped away from him and tossed summarily.
It had seemed so satisfactory….till he recalled Draco was wealthy and it would be coals to Newcastle, likely. But still…it wouldn't leave his head, the notion. Muggles looked upon jewelry as being important, as being a worthy gift. And he'd not been much trained up in the art of giving to his lover. Had never before given much of anything to anyone, outside Hermione and the Weasleys.
“Cheers,” Harry replied, shooing her off and trying to quell the light blush that had sprung unbidden to his stubbly cheeks. “I’ll roust you before dinner time, no fear.”
"Yes…" Potter had seemed strangely reluctant to allow Draco his due; his green eyes were quite skeptical. "I think."
"No you don't," Harry snapped back. "Like I said, it's bloody reheated casserole, so I can at least get some nutrition into the both of us, on some sort of regular schedule. And you weren't paying attention at all even just an hour ago yourself, because I sent an Owl off to the Manor and you never responded.” He shook his head, lips pursed, emanating some species of self-righteous disapproval.
"DON'T YOU
r, Potter—I'm just saying you can't simply buy both.
"Ummmm, no…" Harry sighed, fetching up at last before Draco's casually crossed legs. He shuffled a bit in his socked toes, peering at Draco pensively through his floppy fringe, waiting. Waiting for Draco to do as he always did, which was to put aside whatever it was he'd going on and make a comfy place on his lap, specially marked 'Harry'. "Not really, no. Um, Lavender fed me already. We had pad thai."
"Malfoy," Harry repeated, firmly. "We should've known it would happen someday,
“Giving you a bloody hug, what do you think?” Harry replied happily, stifling a small yawn and withdrawing just enough for Draco to be free of his wild hair. “It’s an apology. Luna does them and it's nice. Hmm, you’re warm as anything, you know? Ta for that.” Squirming, he pushed himself closer, snugging up to Draco’s torso, his arms naturally loosening as he relaxed. Another sudden yawn overtook him, which then inevitably prompted Draco to wish to yawn as well. “Merlin, but I’m knackered. Too”--he yawned again, the bugger--"tired to budge. May I sleep here, M’foy?”
The quality of Potter's gaze shifted, becoming a little more careful and several degrees more intense. Draco shivered just bit, under it.
"No," she chirped. "You wouldn't, dear."
“Argghh-gh-gh-gh!” Now Ron really was an alarming shade of blue, just as Hermione had been a few moments prior. But he did nothing useful about it, continuing to flop about like a beached trout. “Ha-Ma-Ha-Mal!”
"Hmm."
Draco closed his eyes, shutting out the flickering images on the telly. It was peaceful. The rug was warm over their legs and the murmur of the telly was soothing. He had his best friend in the world sitting next to him and they’d even managed to have a meal together. Their flat, for all that it had taken the combined powers of Hermione, Pansy, Theo--who was big in Wizarding real estate now--and even Minister Shacklebolt, who’d pulled a few strings for them in the paperwork department--their flat was both spacious and cosy, Wizarding and Modified Muggle, located perfectly, and it felt like a real home to him. More so even than Draco’s beloved Manor did at the moment, despite all its freaky antics. Perhaps especially because of those magical antics!
Harry didn't feel the same as he. Demonstrably. It was only the chill of the night air nearly stunning Draco mid-swoop that stopped the inevitable tears in their tracks.
“Flatterer,” Harry grinned in return, his throat easing as the weight of all those unwanted forced truths began to finally recede. He reset his feet, cocking a hip out, and leaned a little nearer his partner. “Laying it on thick, are you? Thirty seconds.”
Ron moved terribly suddenly, straightening up like a shot, so fast he practically cracked the vertebrae in his neck, nodding as he was fiercely in agreement with Granger: a furious motion, whilst chomping his back teeth down in a nasty sort of snort. His hair wafted and ruffled in result of his motion, a jaunty blaze of colour in a room left soullessly dull.
“Oh, really?”
As he went along he kept an eye out for things to augment his own personal set of Runestones.
"Yes!" Draco growled. "That's what I've been trying to tell you, Potter. For you—all for you—and I didn't spare a Galleon to make it right and proper, either, so make sure to appreciate it, will you? I'd the very devil of a time, Harry, managing this and in such a short time—"
"Bugger off. I'm not that bad!"
, Draco! We're only—you're only—we're not even seventeen yet, for Merlin's Sake! I'm

involve you actively killing anyone. No chasing after villains, no hunting down anything more terrible than the odd academic reference or primary source. Oh, no! It's all about travelling around and sightseeing the living Merlin out of old fucking rocks and pottery shards in very obscure places, Potter, and maybe now and again telling the Aurors they should be on the look out for assorted oddballs fascinated with a certain sort of squiggle in found in cuneiform or hieroglyphics.”
Harry, as Draco recalled with the wee part of his brain not actively melting, had mentioned his best mate had a terribly difficult time with arachnoids.
Of course Potter would say 'no'; Draco knew that. They were hiding behind the Witch for a reason and it wasn't just because she offered one of the better locations for illicit mutual hand jobs.
It was more than a matter of mere moments, cleaning the flat, bathing, digging up clothes that wouldn't highlight the sallowness of his fair skin, the gauntness of his wasted wrists, and that would pass in places either Muggle or Wizard. Shoving down a bowl of stale cereal and possibly off-date milk as a precaution because he'd not eaten much he could remember recently and remaining too long standing produced a wobbly result in the kneecap region. His blood sugar was low; Harry always complained of him driving himself, of being too focused to take 'good care'. Harry had always been there to take care of Draco for him.
"Hermione!" Harry flushed bright red at the very thought of it; laying himself that wide open to a Malfoy broadside? Oh, no! He wasn't that daft! "Oh, fucking
"What else could there be?"
Harry pondered the question, clamping his lips together to prevent additional destruction, nibbling nervously upon the lower one when he forgot, overwhelmed by the sheer horror of awaiting Draco's response.
Ron finished off triumphantly and copped a little swaggering bow, left and right, from his seat.  Several of the Firsties actually clapped, the nervy little twits. The remainder of the Gryffs, well used to a sexed up Weasley, either wisely ignored Ron entirely or rolled their eyes at him in disgust.
“Har—urk! Ack! Rrrhgh!”
“Yes!” she gasped, half-laughing and falling away to sag against a rocky outcropping. “Quite. It’s more properly Me, of course. The One. But of course the feeling of Creation is very strong indeed here. And likely this One was indeed a female-feeling person.”
"We've gone and done everything there is to do already," Draco said. "
All in one breath, it burst out, and Draco, horrified, couldn't seem to do a single thing to prevent it. He'd been possessed, he thought wildly, and blinked rapidly at his own audacity; gasping, rather, at his own total lack of Slytherin finesse—and then he waited, with that same sharp inhalation bated.
“How so?” Millie cocked her sharp chin at him. “You know Eihwaz better than I do, Harry. It’s been cropping up far too often these last few weeks to be ignored as a mere fluke. That’s why I’m asking, seriously.” She frowned, a quick grimace that flitted away as quickly as it came. “I do actually care about your life, you know. At least a little. Stranger things and all that.”
“Oh-my-gods-oh-my-gods! He’s almost got it, Pans! Nott! Potter’s got it!” Draco shouted, hopping from one foot to the other in his excitement. This was more hair-raising than even TriWizard had been! Even with sodding Ravenclaw House practically wilting away on the Pitch—the wankers!  What utter losers they were.
"I do not!"
“Not at all,” Pansy agreed. “Wouldn’t dream of it, darling. Innocent of all wrongdoings, we are.”
"But we'll still see each other, right?"
Which Draco did do, swallowing down his all-consuming and perfectly natural ire, and bringing his knees together.
, you idiot! What you're doing—keep doing it!"
Draco dragged in a deep gasping breath. He scowled—Harry could almost see the full frightening extent of it, even in the dark.
…Except, naturally, Harry had been led on by his own inclinations—but that was a bit of alright, wasn't it? One should, after all, follow one's nose. Worked for pigs and truffles; should work for horny Wizards, too, yeah? Er…make that smitten Wizards. As this wasn't just about getting off, either—far from it.
, naturally, shrieking 'Ah! Ah!
“It’s not sad, Ron!” Harry protested. “And yes, well, I wouldn’t just come out with that—that
"Hold still, Harry," Draco chided, having wrestled him most the way round the tiny round café table, chair legs screeching eldritch across the tiled floor as they came together. He dropped a quick kiss on Harry's ear, murmuring sweet nothings about 'squirmy gits' and 'little fools who wouldn't stay put.'
Because…
“No, really, Nott—he
"Hmm."
. And—the day—after! Day after that, too. Be ready for me, Harry. No mercy."
"You!" Draco yelped abruptly, impelled by a growing sense of urgency and swallowing down what felt like boulders jamming up his windpipe. "You, Harry—you need me, don't you? Y-you want me? I know you do, damn it!" He jerkily got on with what was, hands-down, the absolutely most alarmingly humiliating, most crucial moment of his entire life—the final act of proposing. "I mean I do, Potter, and don't you forget it! Want to—with you, git! Only you. Don't you dare not know that, Harry Potter—don't you dare forget!"
to be coherent, alright? At least for a moment? Use words, Harry. Together—in rows, with punctuation. You'll find they're all very helpful."
He blinked and quickly glanced away from the place where Harry had gone to stand when he'd ripped himself from Draco's hands. He'd stalked off and was planted, feet flat, standing stolid and dour and staid on the familiar old worn down hearthstones, glaring daggers at Draco's puzzlement. Possibly because the floo provided him a quick out if he should want it. Possibly because Draco was daring to exist on the same planet as him; was rude enough to exist in the same damned room. Breathing in Harry's precious personal air, the stuff he didn't seem to care to share anymore, at least not with Draco.
a fucking snog. More like a defensive measure."
There are no sun signs to be found here, no symbols of life or hope or love painted or carved into the landscape. This place lays barren and repellant and Harry absolutely hates it.
“Merlin! Of course I say so! Git’s bloody fantastic!” Draco wasn’t minding them at all—nor the fascinated, vaguely appalled look registering on his two mates’ carefully bland Slytherin features. Potter had once again shot straight up in a tight spiral, and the Snitch was lingering—feinting now left and now right, just between the prat’s gloved fingertips! The crowded stands were in the midst of going positively mental in their overwhelming excitement, hooting and tossing objects into the air, which did nothing at all to hide Draco’s loud shriek of encouragement.
Draco’s head spun dizzily. He felt horrid. Nauseous and weak and much as if he'd been struck by a Stunner.
“Yes, and?” Draco sent a searing glare over at Harry as they reached the landing. “It doesn't matter, does it? The technicalities of who's who and what's what, I mean. What matters is the practical effects, and in practical terms you do have a significantly higher level of sheer brute strength in Magic than I do.  We all witnessed that back in DADA. Flamel wasn't any different. There’s a damn good reason the bloody Ministry types tapped your fine Saviour-y arse to lead Mysteries. Now shut it and come along, because I need you to use it, all you’ve got. It’s either that or I do a fucking bunk this minute and it's my own stupid old Manor and I don't bloody well want to! D'you get it?”
"I," Draco muttered dully, his chin dropping, his formerly overly eager hands clenching uselessly in search of the comfort of the little velvet box that contained the family ring that would've tied Harry to him irrevocably. It was gone—he'd hardly noticed its absence. He didn't care much now. "I…understand. Well…right, then. I am…I am sorry to have troubled you. Trust me when I say I shan't be doing it again, Harry."
“Mngh? Wha?”
Oh, but Brown was loathsome, nasty and vile! A blot upon the brighter side of females! Worse yet was that Draco had practically had to bash Harry over the head with a broomstick to make him pay the slightest heed to the developing (and hairy) situation and the silly, brainless prat still wouldn't buy in! Not a clue, he had, Mister I'm-the-Bloody-Hero, that the sorry excuse for a Witchy woman was desperately seeking some poor hapless sod to latch onto in the sea of her misery-or that he, Golden Potter, had been summarily elected her rock
This was it: proof, then. Q.E.D. So, triumphant, Draco came.
"Pfft," Malfoy tsked and proceeded to calmly turn his gaze to view the Lake, his expression serene. "Obviously, Granger."
“Potter!”
"Right, right—whatever you say, Harry. Well, come on, let's clear up," Draco urged, nodding. "I think we're done here, least for this evening. ake the book along with since we've still time. And we'll nip in first thing in the morning and question Pince, if we absolutely must."
"And that spell for clearing up spots—Hermione, come over here for a half-sec, will you?" Patil was crouched at the knees of the poor beleaguered ex-Gryffindor, staring at him intently, as if he were a rack of beef hanging at a butcher's.
"Why?" The query gave nothing away as to the emotional state of the querent. Harry's only clue concerning Draco's disposition was the sudden sweaty slickness of his smooth skin. It had gone cold and then hot in a matter of seconds, lax and pliant where it lay, but damp and slippery as Harry's own clammy knuckles and palm. Harry held on grimly, nonetheless. "Why not?" Draco pressed, intent.
Harry stands and waits patiently, his shoulder leaned companionably against Millie’s, Luna a warm aura to his other side, well aware that soon enough they will be dancing, all of them. His slippery soled fancy shoes will slide left and then right, then left again, and left and left, leg in, leg out, wand held up straight at waist level in both hands fast-knuckled, and they’ll gain momentum, the lot of them, echoing in dance the engraven spirals, the racketty bob of the Kudu, the otherworldly arc of brilliant spinning diamond lights in the sky.
"Sure, Harry," she replied, after a longish pause. "Come on, Ron." She put a hand on her boyfriend's arm, urging him along a bit faster. "Let's go ahead, a little bit, shall we?"
"Next year," Draco was so warm and hard and hot beside him, their sides and hips pressed together as they eased their way through the maze of tables. "Without fail, Harry. I promise."
Harry would’ve liked to command Draco that; he didn’t. He knew Draco had to go; must go—must. That there was good reason to go and that it was all very prudent-cum-wise-cum-Slytherin and that he’d be a fool-and-worse-than-that if he should stay too long on a school day morning. So Harry didn’t say it aloud, exactly…well, maybe he whispered the word ‘stay’ but only under his breath. Very much so; he hardly heard himself, he was so discreet about it.
"Fine."
"Pardon," Draco winked. "Beg to differ."
It wasn't at all as he'd foolishly thought it was. Harry didn't—Harry wasn't.
Draco paced furiously, gritting his teeth, adjusting knick-knacks and such about their tidy flat, as his hands felt the need of something—anything—to keep themselves busy. Or they'd wrap themselves 'round Harry's lovely throat when he stumbled in and then Draco wouldn't be responsible for the mayhem that ensued!
“No,” Harry replied gruffly, looking about him for another clean mug and grabbing up the carafe the University Elves had kindly left for them. “I’m bloody well not. Hmm." Pouring out, he noticed Luna was alone at the long table. "Oi. Ichika-san alright?”
"Oh, Harry!"
They both drew back, gasping, gurgling, throats working as they swallowed and gulped. Harry’s mouth shaped into a startled ‘O!’ and Draco’s teeth came snapping together so fast he feared for their cracking.
Draco heard, for the conduit went both ways.
, will you? How many times do I have to ask you?"
For they'd been ensconced happily and peacefully in Gryffindor's untasteful-to-the-extreme Common Room, which was thankfully deserted due to the lateness of the hour. Draco had snuck through a window in the Tower, secretively flying up to meet Harry as per their agreed-upon assignation. The ring had been burning a hole in his trouser's pocket for nearly a whole day at that point; Draco couldn't wait a moment longer to get his torment over with and done. He'd a plan. He'd snog Harry into pliability and then execute the Burning Question. And Harry would agree, blinded as he was by both Draco's love and Draco's Veela.
Quidditch, for one—sport, in general. They'd that in common, the two of them—he and Weasley, that was, though naturally also he and Harry, for Quidditch, especially. And mums. Mothers and the nature of their nosiness into one's personal life for another. Narcissa Malfoy and Molly Weasley, as their two vastly different sons had variously discovered, had a great many traits in common, nosiness over one's personal life being the main one! But not to get into that personal bugaboo now—Weasel wasn't the issue, this Brown bitch was, and Draco was sick to death of it. Of
“...Good.”
"You're an idiot, Potter," Draco derided acidly, every inch superiour. "You don't just come out with things like that—did no one ever tell you?"
“Suffering Salazar, Draco!” Harry fell back, defeated. He sighed and it was an enormous one, which gusted out, blowing Malfoy’s trademark fringe right off his pale forehead. “You are
“Idiot. Stop pretending, Malfoy. I can see you, you know.”  Harry’s skin goose-pimpled; all the damned duvet, this morning—every inch of it the bastard had taken!  He shivered; prodded harder, indenting the shoulder, the hollow beneath that intriguing blade of bone where a wing might be if Draco had them. “You’re not fooling anyone.”
have it in his life. He'd die first...really, he would. "Harry."
“Mpph, mmmmphngghfack!”
Two tiny snitches. Exactly the same, he was sure, 'cept his gift had a 'DM' engraved upon it. He wondered…
“...Oh, fuck,” Harry said breathlessly, stepping forward on impulse and tugging Draco along with. “You didn't say there were spiders, Malfoy. And spiderwebs; so pretty! Or constellations. Bloody--er. I quite fancy all those, you know. Feels like home, a little.”
don't
"Yeah, okay," Harry agreed, more than willing. "Um…"
“But how to--I mean, how exactly do that, Pans?” Draco appealed. “Call it a bloody experiment for science? Say we’re giving it a whirl? What? I mean, Teddy! Teddy’s going to wonder what’s going on, Pansy. My mum, and Auntie, too. We can’t just have a fucking affair! There’s consequences!””
A place without honour.
“Kay,” Pansy chirped.
to her dive of an apartment on Pathetique Alley and help her mend her clogged sink. Or anything else she needed fixing up, now that the so-savvy Seamus was fled with his dark paramour to the sunny climes of Barbados and hasty tropical divorces.
"Mum," he said, "perhaps Father needs—"
Draco sighed silently and nibbled upon his lip as she nattered on and on about all her sightseeing and shopping trips, gamely summoning a polite air of enthusiasm. He slumped slowly down on his hearth rug as she related various marvels of her holiday, shoving a tasselled silk bolster against his aching back and shifting about to make himself comfortable as one could be with only a couple of spindly chair legs for support. This news about Harry was startling to say the least. And vaguely worrisome.  Not that Harry wasn't generally at least a little worrisome, at least in Draco's experience.
“No. I’m serious.” He rolled his eyes back in his head and regarded their ceiling with a pout, thumping his back against the cushions. “Really, Draco; listen. Tell me, what does the Ministry have against a proper weekend? I don't think I’ve had even a spare hour to myself since I got called back from Osl--ergh! Um, my last foreign assignment, I meant. You didn't hear me say Oslo, Malfoy. Because, you know, if you had--”
"No, you don't, Harry," Hermione scolded him, "and don't be such a spineless sop. He's civil to you now, isn't he? When he chats with you in class? No more insults—no more brawling? Assigned and regular study partner for NEWTS Potions and DADA and fellow Prefect, right? You talk to Malfoy all the time, Harry; you're managing to be almost matey, the pair of you. Not Ron-level, but still! Amazing; unlikely, yes—but still so damned true. Don't bother to deny it. I have eyes."
"Cor." Harry’s eyes widened as he stared at it. “Blimey!”
Harry frowned. He had? He'd no idea how, then, as he was just being his usual self—an utter fool before Malfoy's eyes. Beside him, he could hear the rustle of paper and Hermione's almost entirely silent snickers. He poked her sharply in the ribs and glared up at the angular face that had already sunk a thousand helpless Harry-ships.
Was it the exact same jeweler he'd consulted—the same box….the same gift?
Harry smiled.
who caused Harry far more trouble now, well after all the hostilities had formally ceased between them, than he'd ever managed in all their long-shared history, how he would laugh his arse silly! Or howl—or snort—or whatever action the sexy git performed when he was truly amused. Harry wouldn't know, naturally; he'd never witnessed that. Never bothered and now Malfoy was quite the serious studious git and didn't laugh. Much. Well…he smirked still, but he wouldn't be Malfoy if he didn't. And not nearly as attractive, either.
, Granger."
Prodding, but gently, at feelings he'd no name for. That other people had to identify for him. Ad teased him for, sometimes, as that was the way of his mates.
A quickly caught breath and a sense of utter stillness in the room was the immediate response—the only response for an entirely too long stretch. The body beside him glinted as its elegant lines fell into a cast of carven marble; Harry could make that much out at least, even in the dearth of reflected, refractive light. It was raining outside: torrents of rain, and the half-drowned gaslights on Diagon Alley were struggling to stay lit. The curtains were drawn and there was nothing but their faintly glowing cast-aside wands on the bedside table to betray either of them.
Before breakfast!
If he was going to blubber--and that unholy prickle at the back of his eyes and the stifling feeling in his throat surely besaged it--he’d much rather do it alone, by himself.
"Ack! No!"
"Er...what now?"
"Here, I meant? For, uh, shagging? It won't get in the way, will it? What I said."
, which was the strangest sensation possible; just enough to make the incantation take hold and continue on unabated: one cock, long and pale and rosy-red at the tip, swathed shiny with copious lube, slotted cleanly into one small pink pucker, also dripping. The other prick—shorter, a little thicker, and with a purpling vein beneath flinching as Harry shuddered helplessly—was
"Oh, but Draco, my dear, why not your Harry?" Narcissa raised an eyebrow in gentle query as she chose another biscuit to nibble. Magical corsetry was a wonderful thing. "I mean to say, darling, simply by examining every humiliating incident you've confided to me before now I'd've instantly deduced he'd be most obvious person alive to claim your affections—had I ever considered it in that light." HIs mother fixed him with a most direct Look. "Which of course I hadn't, given our prior circumstances, nor would've normally thought to, either. But do you not agree, Draco? It stands to reason, darling. You've been gagging after that young man for almost a decade now, one way or another. Ten years it's been, Draco. I see nothing at all surprising about it, dear."
Yes, perhaps best to stop that train of thought right where it was. Full halt.
Harry blushed—or rather, he felt his face burn a little hotter, even as a cool, clean-shaven cheek pressed lightly against his forehead. All the not-quite-stares left him shy. Draco ducked his chin and nosed his beak into the tumble of Harry's mussed hair, seeking the bob of his Adam's apple, distracting him.
Not quite AK level yet, but damned close! Perhaps he could projectile vomit on Ron’s lap  in place of hexing his face to a blubbery heap? That would be enough to ensure he didn’t get any from Hermione for a good long while!
"Bind us…positively, I hope? Mum? No Imperious or Confundums, right?"
“I said, shut it.”
"There's every need!" Draco snapped. "You upstaged me!
"Good," Potter was saying. "Good—me neither, Draco. You understand, then, why I want to do this, right? Why I want you to have—to have, well
, Draco. You didn't—you needn't have—done that."
For Draco had a deep and abiding purpose underlying this particular Sunday afternoon duty visit to his Mum. Tea at the ancestral pile was a perfect excuse to vie for what he needed at the moment: a physical symbol. Because he really rather wanted a present to bestow upon Harry, something special to commemorate the rather amazing fact there was now a bond of sorts developing between the two of them. And not just any old present, no. He wanted jewelry, fine jewelry—Malfoy family riches, centuries old; a piece Harry could wear proudly—an item that fair screamed 'Property of Draco Malfoy. Hands off, all you other wankers!'
“Well, and so do I, little one, but I’m not so sure, now. I could earn a detention of my own if Snape discovers me up your innocent baby bottom. You are still a minor, you know. It’d be such a shame, if someone thinks I’m taking advantage of you.”
! Pot-
He thinks instantly of Draco as he gazes up and up. Draco, who would be ecstatic to be here, where Harry was, standing beneath it and marvelling. No doubt that intriguing mouth would be chattering away of this and of that arcane astronomical aspect, those hands moving swift as swallows in flight, darting to point out this or that constellation. Or p’raps he’d be dead silent instead, biting at his full lower lip contemplatively, pointy chin cocked at an elegant angle and neck craned, taking it all in with a deep and grave attention.
"So?" The shorter man twisted his spine against the brick wall, flinging out an uncaring hand, making as if to lever himself off and away. "What's it to you?" he snarled. "You don't even care, not really. And I can live where I please, thanks. I don't know why you're acting as if
“Oh, my freaking gods! You’re not seriously singing, are you? Are you?”
"Together," Draco added meaningfully. "Unaccompanied."
Draco could be nasty about it—he'd wanted Harry to himself for the space a weekend, sod it; was that too much to ask, really?—or he could be polite. He could, if the fancy struck him, be…considerate.
"I!" Draco gasped at the insinuation; had he been that lousy at demonstrating his undeniable love for his Mum? "But I! The Cabinet Incident, Mum!" Which he regretted deeply, but still! He'd only followed the dastardly Dark Lord's orders in order to save his Mum and his horrid Father!
"Die trying," Draco echoed blankly. "Alright." It seemed a real possibility. With Harry gone.
, just like always. Never mind that, though. Merlin, but I have
"—love you forever, Draco," Potter was saying, a goofy, gooey Gryffindor look in his green eyes. "So, please
“You!” Harry broke free of his momentary stasis, first batting furiously at the inoffensive handkerchief and then all at once whacking Draco on the sternum, open-handed but so forcefully he nearly shattered a mother-of-pearl button on Draco's pajamas. “Stoopid! Bloody! Git!”
haven't any rights—or
"Um, alright," Harry said, waggling his brows and tossing a spare tendril of hair off his forehead. "Be that way, why don't you? Difficult and cryptic. And grabby.
bad, Harry! Come!”
"What?" Harry asked, clearly confused by Draco's crypticism.
“Yeah! Can’t we go now, mate?” Theo piped up, finally showing some form of animation. “Potter will win it, of course. He always does. And Ravenclaw’s such a dead bore. Always strictly regulation.”
"Come on, come on, come on," Harry chanted, not hearing a word. "Come on, then!" His thighs spread as wide as they could go, bones popping with effort. Malfoy grabbed his kneecaps and shoved them higher and farther apart despite that, till they banged Harry's ears in the process with a muffled thump and a ringing sensation. He could care less.
Pansy’s wand, stuffed into the cushion next to her, chimed loudly; once--twice--thrice. She cast down her knitting and took it up, silencing it.
Draco faced Hermione, grey eyes narrowed and accusing.
Draco on the point, preferably right into the forgiving mattress; keep him pinned there forever, so he’d never leave and Harry would know that Draco would always, always be there—to come home to.
"Fuck-fuck

"So, erm…not hungry, then?"
“Kid?” Draco probed, turning dramatically on a heel and pacing over to the door and back again with a decidedly miffed swish of his work robes. “What kid is this, exactly? You didn’t mention any bloody kid earlier, Potter,” he snarled, bearing his teeth at Harry in a sudden gleaming flash. “Fuck. So. There was a minor present when we were Incarcerousing Snarlph and his buffoons, is that what you’re telling me? And this child had the gall to try and hex you, the Great Harry Potter, all unawares? With an age-restricted Truth Charm? Circe!”
“Um. I’ve a bit of free time coming up; likely, I can find it in me to provide a little spot of community service. Bring the Wizarding Wonder Boy up to speed on his cultural heritage; escort you ‘round, show you things. Do the world a service, more like, so you’re not so hopelessly gormless, Gryffling.”
was taller.”
Three fingers, all deep in and searching, reaching for a little bundle of nerve endings Harry knew well from his own explorations; finding it and skillfully manipulating it into a pulse of blinding ecstasy. And all the while tongue—Malfoy's—and also teeth, invading his drop-jawed orifice with passion.
Draco scowled. He could practically hear Potter’s unsaid ‘So there, wanker!’
"Oh, I don't know, Hars." Millie tilted her head at her handful of things wrapped in thin pancake and smiled. "It might be serious this time. You never know. Not with Lovegood."
“You’d have to kill me; yes, I know, Harry,” Draco replied, flipping a casual two fingers. “Right, no, as to that. I don't know why the Ministry is so difficult, really. I’m only just joyous that I’ve never felt the need to work there. But returning to the important things now. Which do you want, then, the Thai or what Kreacher sent? I’ll bring that in if you’d rather; I’m off to the kitchen for a beer anyway.”
, arsehole—watch the battering-ram effect, damn it! That's my poor—"
“Hah! As if!” But Draco let it go, nonetheless. Whatever it was, he was sure he could handle it—in this mood, he could bloody well handle anything life threw at him!
“Gladly,” Draco replied instantly, shutting his eyes and desperately envisioning the safest, most secure place currently available for refuge. “Ah! Molly Weasley’s Kitchen!”
Draco straightened where he perched and stared beseechingly at Harry. But with a bone-deep hauteur, of course, because Malfoys always looked that way: po-faced, starched-up, lemony. A bit too high in the instep, they were. But Draco couldn't help it if his stupid face always sent mixed messages. He couldn't help if he never seemed to work out how to send all the right ones, at the right time, and especially to Harry. But Harry had never objected overmuch to Draco's manner, his usual methods; well, at least not after they shagged that first time. He'd understood, or at least it really seemed he had…until he'd simply not wanted to, one day. And then he'd walked out on Draco and all because of some misunderstanding that Draco still wasn't completely clear on.
"Mmm, we'll see…" Harry murmured, busily scanning the crisscrossed script intently, his eyes narrowed behind his new silver-rimmed specs. "Crikey! You know, there's all sorts of poisons in this particular potion, Draco. It really
"Unlike Malfoy Manor," Draco chimed in, "which has been occupied for the most part, at least, by something like a 'family'. Until recently, of course. Now it's just me rattling around there. The Manor clearly doesn't care for that and it's made it very plain what it wants done to fix it up. Hence, the Nursery."
"Didn't we do that already?" Longbottom wanted to know. He was snuggled up against the oversized stuffed teddy bear Harry had won at the recent Hogsmeade Merchant's First Annual Street Fair, and he had that frighteningly familiar needy look in his soulful eyes, the one that always lead to the knowledgeable Eighth and Seventh Years diving for cover. "Sounds awfully like—"
“Fuck! That’s not necessarily true, Malfoy,” Potter shot back, gripping Draco’s hand a little harder. “Why, just a few months ago, the Unspeakables were heavily involved in that Auror drive to contain those--oh, fuck! I can't tell you that. Why?”
“Do you?” Draco’s voice was light and casual; the careful grasp he had on Harry’s collarbone was anything but. “I wonder, sometimes.”
“Ten, then—and we’ll see about that,” Nott grinned, not minding Draco in the slightest, even though he was right there. “He might surprise you, the twit.”
“No fear, I shall not deny you this simple pleasure,” he smirked. “Merlin knows you don’t get all that many, Potter. Be right back--oh, and please Scourgify that?” He pointed at the table’s surface. “Teddy was here with Andromeda, remember? There was a plethora of that Muggle Playing Dough spread all over it. That shite sticks like the dickens.”
“Grimmauld itself, though? Hmm, how strange,” Draco murmured, following after. Harry gallantly handed him the fancy urn which held the special Unspeakable floo powder. “Ta. Manor’s all wonky and now you say Grimmauld also is. I wonder if it’s a related issue? Blood ties, you know.”
“He's returned, dear. A month ago, is it?" His mother tapped an elegant forefinger against an equally elegant dimple.  "Something like that."
"Excuse me?!" Draco interjected, mildly enraged. "I always pay--"
A silver stag sprung into existence, just on the edge of the circle of mayhem. It pawed the carpet with its spectral hooves, tossing its antlers as Harry's wish to summon Hermione was telegraphed telepathically. Then the deer skittered in a wavery, rather drunken way towards the exit.
His stomach rumbled, quite unexpectedly, a great long growl. Startled, Draco blinked at the telly, shaking off the hazy thrall.
Weasley and any of those bloody Gryffindor types or that Looney Lovegood, either!
want to do it that way again—
personally, same as mine doesn't. In fact, it’s probably been slavering after an opportunity like this for eons, itching for the proper moment to tart it up and bludgeon its owner into coughing up the kiddos. You can’t blame it, really,” he added, turning his head to peep at Harry, who looked suitably dire. Very much as though as he’d been sucking a lemon. "I suppose."
“Potter-Potter-Potter!” chanted like-minded Slytherins all about them—like Draco, they too were entranced and overcome by the rousing display on the part of the Gryffindor Seeker. It helped, too, that he’d saved their many shivering little arses from certain grisly death, recently. “Harrr—reeee!” they shrieked as one, joining all the other Houses in a giant, eardrum-blowing noise. “Rah! Rah! Rah!
Gryffindors, it has been said, adore a good scrap over a morning meal. Wakes them right up; rouses the blood into moving, almost more effectively than caffeine. So, it was beautifully messy for some little while, after Harry tackled Ron flat to the wobbling bench and they both fell in a heap on the floor and what with the remaining grilled bangers gone airborne and Harry attempting to thrash Ron into the cracked flags of the sticky, crumb-ridden floor with the giant institutional toast rack, despite the best efforts of Nev and Seamus preventing him.
"Draco?" Harry's voice and eyes were both concerned. He'd obviously not heard Draco confirm he'd wear this ring—would be proud beyond belief to flaunt it. And Draco couldn't bear to look; he closed his eyes to shut out Potter's searching ones. He couldn't possibly say something like that again—not in public!
“Look here, Potter…”
It was much like, or so Harry observed (he
“Sod it!”
“Hmmm,” Hermione hummed. But she didn’t disagree outright, either. “Hmmm.”
but his own stupid, bleating tongue, curse it.
Ron hacked without warning, gacking bacon bits into the pancake plate. Hermione hissed at him across the institutional toast rack centred before Harry’s place at table, highly displeased by Ron’s lack of proper manners and not afraid to share it.
! I can’t come through--there’s no time for chatting. I need
“Ah…” Hermione gawped at him, open-mouthed.
“Hsst! Potter!”
, is all. It's over, alright? Finally run its course, all we had—all done now, all finished, the fucking, the flat share. And you know? You know what's so funny, Malfoy?"
“No.”
Mutual, huh? Harry liked the sound of that, very much.
, Draco." Was that a trace of unasked-for sympathy buried deep in the habitual smugness? Draco was curious, in a faraway sort of way. He cocked his head at her, waiting, hoping for more. More enlightenment, mayhap. Advice, if she felt so inclined. "It's like this."
"Mnfft." Harry's best mate Ron nodded, reluctantly, slowly, a grudgingly accepting light dawning in the brilliant blue as he glanced from his sensible girlfriend's determined expression to Draco's positively shattered one. "Huh."
convenient. I've had enough. So, um, you should
"Right," he said, steadying them both and taking a deep breath. "This is it, Harry. Ready?"
"Why would you ever say that, git?" he demanded imperiously, and instantly froze as Harry insinuated a wide warm hand between his thighs, flexing continuously under Harry's trim arse. "Hah!" he exclaimed. "Cease attempting to distract me! Rotter! Unfair!"
“But, but, of course I’m not Blaise, Malfoy!” Harry insisted, stopping in his tracks as Draco flapped his hands at him, warding him off. “I’m Harry--just Harry! Come on, Malfoy,” he pleaded. “Be serious.”
Likely it lurked unsuspected even in the more deserted hallways and public rooms, the ones Draco hardly ever had reason to visit, given the pervasive scents of talcum powder and sweetened hot milk which crept from beneath long shut doors and the preponderance of randomly displayed portraits of every single one of all Draco's multitudinous ancestors and relations, portrayed from the days when they were but infants and toddlers.
Appalling, that his own mother could actually make light of what had surely been the most life-altering event he'd ever experienced—even if he'd been convinced it was also the most freakish...at the time. The worst day and night ever, Draco had been certain: having Potter incarcerated in his own bloody basement, covered in boils, the Mu-Granger being tortured right before his very eyes, his own precious wand waltzed off with, and then—and then! The very next morning—courtesy his beloved Grandme're's Veela legacy—he'd awoken to confront a bloody roc-sized wingspan and a bird beak where his usual rather more than good-looking nose should have been!
"I don't think…"
—and I, we've—we, we're
"And I'd like to stop in at Sprintwitches, too, Potter, so really, we should be moving on, all right?" A gift. Yes. But not now, and not from here. And what Draco
"I'll—I'll wear anything you give me, Potter!" he gabbled—swore—and gathered Potter—
!" Shrieks of that sort had even Mum frowning, Draco noted. Eldritch and eerie, they left Draco wondering if some prior Malfoy had mated with a Banshee. "The Press!"
Draco winced, waving off the offer. His stomach roiled at the mere idea. Raw oysters on the half shell and champagne had been his very odd breakfast, courtesy his heir-obsessed house, and tea, he was fairly certain, was for once not the great panacea it was made out to be. Ugh!
"One."
Draco smiled—an evil, evil grimace of plastic joy. Nodded stiffly to express his acquiescence, and felt the vertebrae in his neck crack audibly from stifled tension. Stuck his hand out to sign off on the enormous parchment bill that had popped into existence before him, just above waist level, and then forced himself to smile even more widely. It pained him.
"Oh, aye! Anything you want, babe," Harry promised him fervently. "Anything!"
"Hmph!" Harry muttered, not bothering to glance sideways at the sure to be indignant stare he'd meet. "Bollocks. You're so convinced of it you were just bawling over it, remember? Tell me another, then."
, Harry," Draco urged, his nerves jangling. "Take it, will you?"
"So, ah…thinking aloud here, Harry…maybe, just perhaps, she's already popped off to her quarters, you think? You know how these older witches are: so rigid and hidebound—and you know what else?"
good. Draco. Brilliant. Gods, how I do love you."
"A hopeless case, you are," Ron sighed in ready sympathy, patting his shoulder knowingly when Harry finally unwillingly admitted why he was so very often distracted this term, one evening well after curfew when their mates were fast asleep and snoring. "I feel for you, mate—I do," Ron made that moue he made over the thought of spiders. "Been there, done that—stuck now. T-shirt's not worth it, really. Ruddy pain in the arse, wanting someone. Especially that git. Bet he knows it and he's lapping it up, yeah? You'd better watch out. He's got you going and coming, mate."
“Oh, hey, brilliant! You’re still here!”
, not at all! There'd evidently been a Glamour of sorts cast on the counter case, because a closer look revealed the finest grade of silver wrought with exquisite artisanship, set with jewels as rare and valuable as any of the ones Draco's mother boasted of in her collection.
"Here we are, then. Tea or mead, mate. Unless you prefer a coffee?"
Oh, definitely there was laughter  in Potter's tone, even if it was submerged and mostly subaural. Draco frowned harshly at the idea of being mocked, even fondly, and would've transferred that frown directly to Potter except that he couldn't see the git's face at the moment. Stupid berk hadn't lifted his mouth from its leech-like lock on Draco's neck and his question had tickled at bit when he asked it merely from proximity, which in turn only irrationally increased Draco's sense of ill-usage. It increased the swollen state of his dick, too, but that was also a thing he'd grown accustomed to, thanks to bloody Potter.
“Bloody load of bloody bosh, Malfoy,” Harry snorted, belatedly recalling his nose was running and there was tear stains all over his frowning face. He helped himself to a corner of Draco’s sheet, blithely ignoring the redoubled glare he earned for it. “Fine.” He took a deep breath, closing his eyes, and then opened them. Startling Draco, as always, by sheer complex green of them. “Point,” he allowed. “What was your ‘second’, by the way? Or were you just making up a list in hopes of impressing me?”
“Sheesh,” Pansy sneered. “Anyone would think this was actually of interest, darling—instead of being the most deadly dull sport alive.” Theo nodded his agreement, the little shit.
He admired it, a great deal. It gave his heart wings again, the way Potter flew, like a bloody Cheering Charm, double-dose—or Felix, a whole vial.
“Stay?” Harry asked the quiet of curtains drawn, the flutter of very thin eyelids, veined blue; the mumble-grumble-snort and shift of a bright-banner morning Malfoy, inciting. “Stay, please, for me?”
“Bah!” Humbug, even. Draco harrumphed, a small part of his head occupied with wondering whether Potter had hit the showers yet. Next week at this same time, they’d likely both be in the showers, he and Potter.  He could use the opportunity to covertly spy out Potter’s musculature. Potter was slighter than he, true enough, but thy both had fairly decent shoulders and narrow waists, long limbs and sleek builds.
don't, really, know yours a'tall, Harry, and that's an enormous plus in this instance."
"Go," Harry commanded stonily, caught on an unbroken loop of denial. Cruel as any lash, that. Draco winced, mid-syllable. "Please. Now."
, you twat! Now, look at me, please. I've something to say to you!"
, that Harry. So blind and dumb and honestly unknowing, the blighter. Fucking Dursleys! The damage they'd wrought on Harry's screwed-up emotional interior landscaping would never be fully plumbed!
"Now, Lucius," he heard his mother murmur. "You know the boys are very much in lo—"
It would just be—very—fucking—pleasant—if Harry would recall that blood-based oath they'd made so seriously. Draco hated (despised, abhorred) being made to feel…second-rate. A foregone conclusion.
“Yeah?” Harry left his hair go and turned his head to regard Draco.

"Ngh!" Harry shivered, even as he burnt to shamed ashes. This was awful; he resolved never to love anyone again—certainly never to admit it.
Why ever should he? Love Harry? Harry hadn't meant to, either, but that hadn't stopped him. Why would Draco?
at all. Harry tromped down his urge to leap forward and wipe that smirk off with two lips. Actively snogging ones, too.
"I should hope so," Hermione snapped. "It's the least you can do, Malfoy. At least have the sense to try out the basics first. An apology should've been the first thing off those lips. A real one, Draco. Don't fuck around with your sophistry; don't think you can slide. Because if we have to stop by this pigsty again, I'll—"
“He’s an excellent flyer, is what I
“Oi!”
When, that is, Draco wasn't pointedly ignoring the two of them, as much as was humanly possible in his own flat. He'd not invited them in, they'd just come. Stormed his siege, in the vernacular.
"M'okay. Expecto…erm, patronum. Um."
"Shut up, gits!" Neville yelped. "You're no help at all! Harry!"
again, Malfoy. I mean it."
“Prat!”
"I'm not going there, Potter."
No, of course that would never work, Harry huffed to himself, inflating his cheeks and blowing the air out with a frustrated little puff. Malfoy would catch on immediately (and likely hex Harry to death) and Hermione would giggle her arse off over his ineptitude, later. More than she was already, the twat.
"...Draco. I never-"
"Love you, too—and next time do take a little longer over it?" Draco grumped fondly, wrenching his tired neck and glancing with great effort over his one tooth-marked shoulder. He peeped at his Harry, all scarlet-cheeked and huffing like the express, loud enough to deafen, right there by Draco's very well-licked ear. "I barely had a chance to catch up to you, twat."
“Huh!” Ron scoffed, grinning. “Never! Bite me, boys—you deserved it!”
"If I stay, Draco." Harry swallowed hard, pained bog-green eyes searching glass-grey ones. "Then you already have."
"Surely," Malfoy replied, shifting his weight and casually standing back. "Take your time." His eyes shifted to Harry, who was moaning faintly where he lay splayed, green eyes wide and staring. "Thanks, then. I'll owe you, alright? Oi, Potter. What're
day, dear? Busy? Work alright?"
He bit down upon his lip, nearly sharp enough to draw blood, and shut his eyes reflexively against Draco's pointed stare. This entire situation was really rather humiliating; Draco was correct. They were seasoned Aurors and he never should have allowed it to happen. Especially since Draco was watching him as if he’d grown two heads already and was about to sprout a third.
“Really? I don’t think so.” Harry shrugged. “Huh.”
“Oi! What did’ja do that for, git?” howled Seamus, wrenching himself well away from the flailing Weasley. He’s noticed his besmirched sleeve in passing when Ron fell upon him, squashing him into the waffle platter. “Bastard!” On his other side, various Gryffindors were shoved abruptly together, jostling elbows and banging forks.
“I mean,” Draco continued, smoothing the curt edge off his voice, “how are we two any different from anyone else, Hermione? There’s millions, perhaps billions of people out there in the world who aren’t seeking to make themselves married and pop sprog.”
"No!" Draco wanted to grab Harry, grab him if only to shake some sense into him. Grab him because his fingers actually hurt him, having Harry so near and yet so far, glaring at him. He retrained himself with effort. This was not the way to be penitent and, by all the fucking merciful gods, he was penitent. "I can't--you mustn't!"
It was hard to concentrate. Draco felt himself fading in and fading out. To grey, maybe. It was hard to discern in the watery light tentatively creeping through the unclean windows exactly which expression his visitors wore most often: triumph or annoyance—with him, over him. The flat was a bit of a dump, now. Draco couldn't bring himself to give a rat's arse.
, Malfoy!”
ever will—geezer.”
“It does, indeed,” Harry acquiesced. “A larger convening of our forces, Mills. Would you so kind as to arrange it?”
Gryffindor.
“Ah,” Draco nodded. “If you say so, Potter.”
“Shut up!” Harry burst out, vaguely aggrieved but not dragging his eyes from Malfoy’s interesting hair as of yet. It would take more than Ron’s usual ribbing to distract; already he’d noticed some greenish shades near Malfoy’s part that he’d not seen yesterday evening at supper. “Not that big a deal, Ron. I was tired, alright? Just tired.”
“Well, now, thanks a bunch, Hermione, for your support! Stop him, will you? He’s
"Look, er. Thank you for Flooing me, Father, Mother. Please know that your opinions are always highly valuable to me, as your son and—and I'll be sure to consider them, Father."
Harry was enjoying it, really. The smitten bit. With Draco.
"Malf—"
"No. It's a jeweler's," Harry replied, and snatched Draco's one hand as if it were a Snitch he wanted. "Come on; last one there's buying lunch!"
There were diagrammes, various lists of
And he’d likely employ all his mythical would’ve-been prowess for the sole purpose of forcing Draco to
"Yes. Well…."
Or rather, it was more like:
"Love you, love you."
Harry inhales sharply; there’s a shooting star streaking the sky momentarily and he can almost believe he hears the acid sizzle. Draco would be delighted, he’s certain.
. Just joy, pure and simple.
“Hmmm,” Nott hummed. “Give you a fiver if he finally does something about it. ‘Cause he won’t. Never has yet, the dork.”
"Shite!" Harry yelped and dove, disApparating mid-plunge. "Enough already!"
Potter, he was certain, never felt chilled. The git had hot blood under that mostly calm and increasingly self-assured exterior. He moved more like a man than a boy, these days, and Draco appreciated that with all his heart—and his groin. A pleasant dull ached had settled there, shortly after his successful meeting with Dumbledore and not even his Head's distant sneers could dissipate it.
“No! Of course I'm not in danger. It's my own house, isn't it? And don't be a berk. You and your bloody ‘I’ll have to kill you’ speech, Potter.” Draco shook his head in mock disdain. “So passé. Of course I shan’t say anything about your secret promotion to anyone; I barely leave the Manor. Who would I even tell?” He blinked fast, considering, and then gave a sharp nod. “Ah! Maybe that’s the problem! No one
"…Got it!"
"In a court of law, if need be. Legally—all right and tight, Draco. See?"
Gah! What a fucking disaster that had been!
an arsehole. A ham-fisted, exuberant arsehole with no good sense to his credit. That didn't mean Draco loved him less. It certainly didn't require he abandon his relationship with the knowing little git, either, no matter if his Father did expire of a random fit of apoplexy, right here and right now. That wasn't on. He'd not be forced, as he'd been before—no, not Draco Malfoy. His family would just have to accustom themselves. Certainly his darling Mum had already. She adored Potter, as much as a second son. It was…sweet, really.
"Draco?" Harry prompted again, sounding much calmer. "You were saying?"
Stupid Potter. So fucking spritely, the twat. Grinning blearily at Draco as if he'd not a clue.
Draco smirked, pleased as punch. Harry gasped and shifted uncomfortably, his gaze darting about suspiciously. Of all things, Harry was squeamish Draco's little gestures of his affections; the one fault he truly possessed, if one were to ask his boyfriend.
Draco grinned, staring off vacantly at the tapestries lining the cold marble walls.
Draco snorted softly, waving a careless hand; the annoying issue of his boyfriend's likely highly dangerous future occupation could be sorted later. There were more immediate things to deal with.
It’s simultaneously a bother and an honour, this, being Summoned by a Mage in need, but it happens now and again and there’s no question of not-responding. One goes where one is needed, at least with Runes.
"Shall we do it, then? Or at least get started?" Malfoy glanced about him, seeking support. "I, for one, feel our boy Longbottom here needs someone that's not plush and squeaky for the long term. What say you?"
Draco managed to re-hinge his still-hanging jaw, sufficient to be enable articulation. He blinked, perhaps a bit more rapidly than was normal, and slipped his unoccupied hand down under the table to give himself a good solid pinch on the thigh, straightening up and settling himself into a more business-like posture.
letting you near him, Father—no. That would be a negative."
No, it couldn’t be gainsaid: Potter, the git, was bloody
busy."
He shivered, barely repressing an unmanly giggle. His heart nigh bubbled up his throat, trying to burst out and fly away, like the twinned snitches.
. You're warm and you're hot and nice to me and the way your arse-well, I just can't-"
"Er—ah," Draco blanched. "No, um, actually. House elves, you know? Um…let me think."
And then he and his bewildered mouth were covered firmly by long limbs and wide shoulders, white hands and teeth, and all devoured.
“Er--” Harry flushed hotly, rearing back, and incidentally upsetting his carefully attained equilibrium yet again. His chair rocked and teetered in a threatening manner. “No! Argh! Shite!”
"No." Harry closed his eyes, relieving Draco of a little of his innate intensity. “Listen. I was thinking about what you said, earlier, and I think you’re in the right of it. It's not only me, with you. I think it is interfering with me finding someone to be with, my work. I’m only still...I’m only still me, though. You know? There’s not a lot special about me, other than I suppose the Voldemort years, but they're well past, thank Merlin, and I can't even share the fun parts of what I do for a living with my friends, much less anyone I care to chat up. Makes it a very ineffective, the chatting up part. Telling some fit bloke or bint you’ll have to kill them if you make a stupid slip about how you earn your Galleons puts a bloody damper on the whole process. And I don't know that I care much for just shagging, alright? I like to know a person.”
"Guah, aah...ah!" Harry gurgled, at the bitter edge of coming, and clung with fingertips and teeth to Draco's shoulders, his nose stuffed into a storm of feathers and sweaty muscle moving under smooth alabaster skin. "Mnn-mnngh-mm-narhh!"
Long hot fingers wrapped ‘round his cock, pulling fiercely; a mouth full of steaming tongue stilled Harry’s own. He thrashed—and loved it, hips knocking into his lover’s and likely bruising. Ron would have fits tomorrow—but then, he always did.
“Stop it, Ron. You’re being ridiculous,” he chided. Ron was always jealous of Harry’s interest in Malfoy; hadn’t liked it in Sixth; apparently objected to it now, too. It was stupid. Hair was only hair. Even pretty hair. Like Lake water.  “See what you’ve done? Shut up.”
"Oh, no!" Hermione chuckled. "Not at all, Malfoy. Please," she gestured carelessly, "have at it. Harry," she added, turning to him as she slung her bulgy bag over one shoulder, "do

"I said, shut
Leaving Draco go as abruptly as he'd so tightly hugged him, Potter fell back a pace, grinning like a maniac, and look vastly pleased with life entire.
“Gits.”
Draco winced. His calm, collected old stick of a Papa was pulling a bloody Medusa on him, and he was just a shade stropped in the first place, what with Harry. Always that bedamned Harry!
, bastard!"
you say so, Potter," he allowed, very reluctantly, wrenching his permanently scarred eyeballs away gratefully. So very red, the Weasel was—part of Draco's mind wondered if he might just burst. If so, he hoped his Harry's camera-thingbob would record it; he'd pay to see that again. "Fine. Now…a bath, please? Or at least a decent Scourgify? I have to leave this place before I sick up."
"Of course you are, Draco," Harry smiled. "The
“Yes, yes,” Draco said, leaping up to his feet, already on his way across the room. “I understand completely. Enjoy your afternoon, Pans, and, well,” he swallowed hard, glancing back over his shoulder. “I’ll think about it, what you’ve said. I promise.”
“Right, right. But Potter?” Shaking his head as if to clear it of distraction, Draco impatiently threw down his battered quill a second time. “You’ve

"Fuck off!" Harry scowled. "I can see very well, Draco; never doubt it, dickweed!"
, went Potter.
—a dull grinding throb that gutted Harry, standing. And it happened whenever the git was within any short distance; say maybe less than a yard of Harry, and perhaps in Potions class and reaching blithely for a knife to chop dried purple sage leaves into mince or perhaps politely passing across his meticulously recorded lecture notes from DADA for copying over in the library. Perhaps anywhere a'tall and he was a bloody fool for
He slicked himself expertly, feeling the way his cock angled off a bit to the right—not quite perfect, but respectably long and unblemished, his privates furred with a fine, thin opaque fuzz below the jut of him.
And Potter himself? Not half bad, now that Draco was noticing Potter. Er…noticing Potter more than previously, that is.
“Patience, wee Potter,” Malfoy cautioned. He ran a tickling set of fingertips down Harry’s chest, tweaking the left nipple as he went. “That’s one of the faults of youth, you realize? Always ready to jump into any situation at all, feet first. You adolescent Gryffindor-types never even bother to check first—such a crying shame, that.”
"It does.
"I'm shagging you tomorrow, Harry—got it?" The question was a bark, rough and startling in Harry's buzzing ear, jolting him out of his stupor. "I'm fucking you more stupid than even you are now, git—
"Huh? Ooooh!"
'Unknown'-'Runespoor'-'Demiguise', for example, was approximately the number of days counting from when he'd first departed the shores of his homeland and begun his Journeymanship in earnest till his exhausted but triumphant arrival back at Grimmauld. Two years. That exact same set (familiarly 'Giant Squid'-'Three-Snake'-'Horus-Headed') was--not uncoincidentally--the number of days Harry had dearly felt the absence of his best mate and mainstay at Flamel University, Draco Malfoy. Well, a little more than that, but it would do in a pinch to express an expanse of time that felt both endless and all too short.
“Now, mate, just looking after you. You’re a brother to me, you know that, Harry. I worry.”
Draco hurried after him—was towed after him, actually, like a barge to a tugboat—and tried not to wonder too hard as he raced along the narrow, windy way about Potter wanting suddenly to visit a jewelers' shop. It was far too odd of him, the barmy git; completely not what Draco was expecting, and Draco couldn't help but be curious, really—but it was likely only that Potter wanted to purchased a gift for Granger, perhaps as a reward for being civil.
, thanks. He didn't want the git's far-too-pointy nose stuffed up with gross Bogeys. He'd be the one kissing him, later.
In a way, it was worse than all the years before that, with the Death Eaters after his arse. More continually painful, certainly. Painful in the way being nibbled to death by ducks was.
Harry gasped in surprise, stumbling red-faced and panting through the open door and into their shared office. He huffed a loud breath and hastily dumped an armload of messy files onto the surface of double-sided desk they shared.
guiding the marital broomstick, by Salazar!
my scene at the moment. But they're definitely theirs. More power to them, poor sods.”
Draco sat forward in abrupt movement, alarmed. Harry fidgeted with his wand, twirling it nervously and not quite meeting Draco's eyes, a clear sign from olden days that he was working up to telling Draco something upsetting.
Which was soppy as all get out but gratefully accepted, all the same.
Owned.
Draco cast a nervous glance behind him, always mindful of the childish portraits of his ancestors gazing down from the walls of his study.
Draco's nostrils flared with excitement as he took in Potter's expression—was that pleasure? Interest? A willingness to say 'Yes!' despite who he was and who Potter was and all that had gone on before? Draco's pulse hastened faster (and it was already quite fast, thanks very much, firstly due to Potter's lips, and secondly due to his own brainless blurting out of his wishes. Silly, stupid wishes, Draco thought wildly; always tipping him into hot water!)
“...Potter?" Draco prodded. "You do, don’t you?”
Draco, like the Spider, laid in wait quietly, a curious creature who was subtle and mostly beneficial. Like the Condor, he sailed high in his precious skies, telling over the shapes of the constellations, deriving their meaning, their movements. As with the Tree and the Flower, he--as well as Harry and his mates--had bloomed and come far more into his own being as a person in the safe creche that was uni. They had all not so much ‘redeemed’ themselves, Harry believed, but had simply grown older and wiser and deeper through their experiences there, with their new knowledge freely shared between them and the always-present reliance upon each other.
"Yes?"
And why would he, logically?
"How could you? Son!"
"My friend, Amelida? She's to be racing several of her young mares this year, Draco. They'll use the Grand Prix Circuit, of course, for convenience. Fly right above it, those dashing creatures, from what I'm given to understand, and the dear Muggles shan't see a thing due the Notice-Me-Nots. Quite exciting! I do think you might consider taking a Portkey over; have a little hols of your own. I'm sure she shan't mind another guest coming aboard, darling. Do consider it, will you?"
"Yes, tomorrow. How many times must I repeat that, Potter?" Draco sniped. "Are you having trouble with the concept of time passing? See, today is Friday, all day, and thus tomorrow is Saturday, according to the Gregorian calendar, established as of—
was what we call
the voice berated itself.
The freshly renewed plaster crackled with the force of Harry's back and hips slamming into it. Draco threw all of him into immobilizing Harry, into wiping that nasty mocking expression straight off his face.
“Hsst, Potter!”
Harry happy. He wanted him to be dead-fucking-certain that Draco was the right choice for him…the only choice, the one that endured. For they'd have much to endure, Draco knew.
“Alight, here goes,” Harry nodded, and gave the door a hard nudge with his boot, but carefully, so as not to scuff it. “Stay back, will you?”
Quiet Harry. Hurt Harry. Jealous Harry. Sad Harry.
, I mean! All those extra hours you’ve out at work since you’ve come back? No, no, you’ve clearly lost your mind! You’ve gone wonky inside your stupid head and you’ve twisted all this insane nonsense of 'silly house-wants-kids' shite into your own Unspeakably-induced loneliness--just like me, except mine had gone so far as taking over even the Manor grounds, and dragged me into it, willy-nilly, sticking stupid thoughts of stupid relationships and even stupider heirs in my head like Imperius!" He stopped; caught his breath, will-eyed and panting. "Harry, I wear to Merlin I was just. Fucking. Fine. Until
It couldn't possibly get better than this.
“Ah,” Harry smirked provocatively, taking up his bacon butty and beginning the process of unwrapping the stasis spell that kept it hot, greasy, drippy and delicious. Bless the enterprising Witch who owned the only food stall that did business outside the Ministry on weekday mornings; she was as much a Saviour as he’d ever been. “Him. Yes.”
"Malfoy's right, Nev," Potter nodded. "You never know, do you? Look at us."
Draco assented with alacrity, rising gracefully to his feet and feeling quite pleased and relieved. He smoothed down his robes and smiled kindly at Harry's obvious relief. This plan suited his own requirements to a ‘T’, and much more so than being forced to spill his silly Manor's sordid little secrets here in the inner fastnesses of the Ministry, at Potter's place of business.  No need to cajole Harry away from the Ministry before times, either, nor any cause to make an utter fool of himself describing what was really no more and no less than a temporary aberration in his own living arrangements. And Harry, it seemed, required his old school mate's aid and assistance, something Draco was frightfully chuffed to provide.
, in a way—that word, but only 'in a way'. The helter-skelter marital knot-tying Potter was attempting to force upon them both
"Fuck!" Draco's hands came up to fend Harry off and he made as if to scoot himself out from under Harry's sudden bulk pressing his folded legs into the smooth rocks. "Fuck, Potter—what in Merlin's Arsehole are you doing? Where'd you even come from—?"
It is a place of danger to Wizards and Muggles alike and every little while it is needful to come and strengthen the bounds that contain it. So they do come, all the Rune Mages, their students, their elders, as many as can gather, and rebuild the warding magic handed down over millennia. As they have done, and their forebears before them.
“You fucker!” Potter howled from behind him. “How dare? Are you actually walking away from this? From me? You started it, damn you! And you’re walking away, just like that?”
He smiled hesitantly at Draco and his teeth were pretty and white and his lips were pink and moist. Draco, off-balance by leagues already, was enthralled by the curl of silky hair that tumbled down upon his scarred forehead and the glint of uncertain glee in Potter's green eyes—as if the barmy git would like to laugh but wasn't sure if he should.
“Chaz is in France, Hars,” Mills remarked, the little frown thoughts of her younger sibling dissipating and a set, professional mien settling across her pert features. “He’s reporting back that the Lascaux have been seeing an extraordinarily high level of magical and Muggle visitation. I think that bears investigation.”
"And can bear proper witness—"
“Right,” Theo added.
“Oh,” Pansy nodded. “Now I get it.”
“Sod off, darling,” Draco replied pleasantly. “And close your trap. You’re disturbing my concentration. This is a teachable moment, here; I don’t want to miss it because of you two.”
"Oh, shut it, Malfoy. I'm hardly the slow one here-"
"Absolutely! In fact—" his Mum said firmly, with a winning grin. "You should be off now. Don't waste a moment more with your old mother, Draco. Go find your young man!"
he smelt, all along, and nothing else worth bothering his head about.
Draco could afford it, being a Malfoy. Though those rings were rather stunning in their own right and suitably costly.
But where Harry is currently is where Draco cannot also be, sadly.
“Not for the Manor either," Draco said. A hearty Molly Weasley luncheon and several hours spent in jolly company had done wonders for his nerves. "Wish it were that easy, what? But no. It’s sort of more sadly mundane, is what. Domestic, even. Mum says it does happen with the old homes,” he went on, shifting against the warm weight of Harry pressed up against his side. “They want to be useful, apparently, and ‘useful’ equates to chock o’block with family.” He shrugged philosophically. “It’s what they do, after all--house people. Ancient bloody Magic.”
No—no, he'd erred. He'd committed a grave error, proposing. Failed.
"A little
, read the incised golden script on the top of his gift.
This is a place of great danger.
We need a solution and we need it damn quick. It's late!"
Hate? He'd heard words of hate before, from Potter. And they'd then gone on despite them; had managed to move beyond all that. Had turned a lifetime of angry dislike upside down and inside out and found that it was so much the better for it—all of it, both their lives. They'd had each other, hadn't they? And Draco refused to believe they couldn't, anymore. He stared wonderingly at the dear familiar nose, those lips, that faded scar and those wild locks, battered spectacles framing all of it, every line, and his fingertips twitched forward and longingly, showing his wanting for him.
"But perhaps you're not, if they've handed you all this. Not so shabby, any of it. Clearly you're appreciated. I'm glad, Harry."
“Uh..." Harry hesitated, gulping hard. “Er?”
“It’s not quite all that for me, though,” Draco went on, his tone musing, his wandering hand somehow slipping round Harry’s twitching back to land casually across the hollow between Harry’s hip and rib cage. “I’ve known you for a long time, haven’t I? There’s feelings between us two, stretching way back. Aren’t there?”
“Idiot! You’ll take the whole hour, I just know it!” Harry called after him, but he was definitely laughing. “Just go Muggle, will you? It’s easier by far.”
"You're so wide open and it's a sin, really. Likely I shouldn't take advantage, Potter—but that's not stopping me, alright?" Draco's usual voice had transformed into a weird combination of shaky and determined; it wobbled, which was unheard of. "You've sealed your fate, just now;" it dropped abruptly to a low, gritty rumble, menacing Harry if by implication of dire endings. "I hope you do know
Draco yelped—teeth! The little bastard had deliberately scraped his incisors down Draco's family jewels, just now!—and let his heavy head fall back upon the cushion, squinching his eyelids shut tight against the sight of that black mop of hair, returned to flopping with a will.
"Your wishes, Malfoy?"
me, Harry! Get a goddamn Room of your own, you two! Argh—yuck, my poor
If you are interested, this is a good starting place:
“O..kay? I’m, er, looking. Go on.”
"Hmm-mm," Hermione nodded, having heard this before. "Astoria—and she's much too young for him. And also female. It'll never last. Mark my words."
Harry heard the shout in Draco's head, resounding.
Startled, Draco opened his eyes wide and nearly choked on his swallow, shocked to the core by this unexpected revelation. In the month they’d shared the flat, not once had Potter
Instead, Harry chewed bran-and-currents mixed with teeth that felt as though they might crack with the pressure and ignored his mate with all his might, just as Hermione said. She should know, yeah? And it wasn’t as if he’d not endured torture before, right?
If only Harry would cooperate, the pissy little git.
, Ron," Harry's reply was quiet but the stare he sliced the balmy air with was no less of a threat. "We'll discuss it again later, if
It had been only hours—eight, to his count—since he'd wanked off in the shower, knowing full well he was spending the day at Potter's side, in the company of the enemy, and therefore couldn't afford to be caught out with a stiffie. His precautions apparently made no sodding difference; he could've pulled off ten times in succession and Harry would still make him harder than the famed White Cliffs of Dover just by breathing. Draco plunged and pulled, rocked and twisted, with Potter joining in eagerly as he got used to it, finally ending up urging Draco on at every turn, and it didn't take long at all before he felt that so-familiar pressure in his gut.
Skin! That was Malfoy skin, touching Harry-skin, and it was—it was enthralling! He never wanted it to stop; he could happily expire here, his nose an inch from Malfoy's pointy one, both of them breathing heavily, and tension rife in the humid air.
To tell the brutal truth, all unadorned, he was far beyond mere 'wanting' and well into mindless craving, and generally within the blink of an eye and a reflexive inhalation every single sodding time that doubly-cursed ex-rival of his marched blind (and naturally entirely oblivious of Harry's monstrous hunger) into Harry's bailiwick. Which happened to occur with the stunning regularity of the usual sunrise, naturally, as Hogwarts was by definition a boarding school and all the students lived in. Ergo, it was all Malfoy, Malfoy, Malfoy, all the time; day in and day out, straight on to bleeding infinity—or so it seemed to a hapless, dreadfully smitten Harry Potter.
“Er…what?” Harry asked again, confused. Ron nodded at him eagerly.
Goyle and Abbott, Parkinson and Weasley, Granger and Zabini, Patil and Brown, Finnegan and Thomas, Longbottom and well, erm, anyone available and breathing: those were the other steady couples the group had grown accustomed to, despite or because of the Friday night Shag 'N' Swap thing. This, effectually, had muddied up the categories Percy Weasley so adored, and cast all concerned in Eighth into a state of alcohol-hazed and usually contented 'togetherness'. They might be bored silly continually, stuck in the limbo of not-quite-adult-yet, sod it, but they were family, now.
“Cut line, idiot,” Draco ordered frostily, glaring. “We all know you’re brilliant, and yes, it was likely the most sapient suggestion you’ve ever made in this lifetime, given that Luna’s my own distant cousin and she and Rolf are absolutely bonkers over having babies and they are thus the perfect--what was it Hermione called us; oh yes! ‘Vessels’, she said. Seriously, though. What better place to accomplish their goal than at a house hellbent on producing progeny in its unfortunate occupants?” he asked, somewhat rhetorically, shrugging and studiously ignoring his mate’s stupid smirking and hilarious awkward attempt to pat own back. “All thanks to you, of course. Do stop that, Harry. It's unseemly and you'll probably sprain something.”
He lifted a shoulder; it felt impossibly heavy, like the rest of him. Too heavy to breathe, to eat, to sleep. To care.
A month more had passed since he'd come back to Grimmauld--he grabbed at the next file in the stack and pulled it toward him, reaching for his battered copy of
The third Saturday in May was bright, calm and clear, the only haze lying purple and peaceful on the mountains hovering in the distance. Up close, everything—every leaf, every late-blooming Highlands blossom—was sharply in focus and newly minted. It was mild, and Draco and Harry hadn't bothered to wear their robes, though Draco had worn one of his beloved jerseys, being a bit thin-skinned and not wanting to bother with warming charms should he feel chilled.
“Git!”
"Well, then—can we shag?"
Draco just had to say it. He knew he should have sent an Owl to his parents before now, informing them of his recent romantic entanglement, but he'd been waiting. For…for the time to be right, just as he'd been waiting for Harry to—
: um? R?
care so much about Draco Malfoy, fine; that's your problem, and I sympathize with you—I know what it feels like to be dependent on someone else for my happiness. But!
"I wasn't doing anything in particular—I was angry, okay?" Draco admitted quickly. "I…didn't think he meant it was permanent. When he left, you know?"
"Then."
Very specialized publication; likely you’ve not noticed it, plebe, as Granger does all your reading for you.”
, if you ask me," Draco shot back, rising to his knees upon the table's slippery surface. He peered about him, then and only then noting what amounted to a proper 'textbook disaster', the sort to induce any Librarian to immediate retirement. "
"Wait!"
“Yes, alright,” Draco grudgingly allowed, shutting his eyes in silent supplication to any listening anti-fertility deity and hauling in a hard breath. One way or another, Harry was his last real hope of regaining a normal life. He gritted his teeth, hissing, “Go ahead, then. That’s why we’re here, isn’t it? Get on with your customary heroics, please and thank you.”
Draco paid her no mind, not a jot.
“We shall have to cast, then,” Millie nodded, gathering up her wrapper and her emptied cup though unfortunately leaving the pile of work right where she’d deposited it, square on Harry’s desk. “Some time today, I should think. Though I’m not sure how you’ll fit it in, what with your schedule. Minister’s been sending memos down, asking for an appointment, and Granger’s been banging away at my door daily, wanting to know when you can be freed up again for a long luncheon. I’ve put them all off, just as you’ve asked, Harry, but I can’t for much longer.”
"It's love, alright." He didn't have much experience with the emotion, but nothing else could possibly twist him up like this—no one else alive in the world could induce this sheer panicky feeling that filled him now. Only Draco. Always Draco. "Really, it is."
“Yeah, right,” Theo muttered darkly, “if one actually cared about those things. Which, ahem, I must say
like my O-level, please and thank you. Don't know about
Best by far, his ancestral pile no longer hummed with that horrid invisible tension which had previously stretched Draco’s last nerve to its snapping point. In fact, it seemed to have taken on an air of chipper good cheer and contentment, sated by the unending sex Draco's new tenants were enjoying. So much so that Draco was finally allowed to complete his many tasks in blissful peace and quiet,
“Just jettisoning Peesely altogether, are we?” Draco chuckled, gathering Harry into his arms. “Hmm, such dereliction of duty. However, you were in hospital with Spell Damage recently so I suppose it must be allowed. I’ll put it in your official report tomorrow. Oh, and mine too, if you don’t mind. Meanwhile, I’ve a nice white chilling and supper will be ready and waiting.”
something. "Harry, I."
“Don’t you dare ‘Potter’ me, Draco,” Harry ordered tensely, digging his fingers into those broad shoulders, the same ones he’d been side-eyeing lasciviously for years. “It’s well beyond blasted Malfoy and Potter and you know it! Now, are you teasing me or goading me or exactly what, here? Leading me on, just to drop me like a stone or do you really mean what you seem to say? Do you truly care that much about me? Tell me the fucking truth, for once! I wasn’t lying when I said I was tired, damn it!”
But all good things come to an end, sadly. It did return at last, in fits and starts—the world, that was—and Draco blinked blearily at Madame Pomfrey's white-painted walls and immediately thought first of cold revenge.
Then the git stuffed the sodding
"Draco."
“Ron should be taking note of this, too,” Harry announced. “Malfoy’s hair is clearly the same shade as Lake water. No question. Even a blind man can see that.”
"Oh!" Harry blushed, leaning forward to give his lover's long pale neck and wide shoulders a fleeting embrace. "I'm so sorry, babe. Er…um, shall we, then?"
“Right, no. Cancel that. Grimmauld likely doesn't much care about
And so the natter went, Draco and Potter going on to enjoy a comfortable, chatty meal, even though the meal itself was eerily reminiscent of the fare Draco had been recently subjected to at home in his malfunctioning Manor. It was what came after that was truly shocking.
“Draco, you are an idiot,” Draco’s oldest friend in the universe pronounced in damning judgement. “You and Harry don’t have to do a single thing you don’t want to, and that includes shagging, and marriage, and children! You should both know better by now; I’m downright distraught with you.”
“What, Harry,” Hermione prompted, when he didn’t continue. “What?”
! A little—a little lube there, Draco? Er—
Oh, yes—Harry had to return to that horrid slag's flat tomorrow; so he'd said, vaguely—something about elbowy-shaped drainage bits needed.
He finally snatched his hand back, only to throw his arms up in the air in exasperation, nearly clipping Draco across the side of the head in passing.
"Because—!" Harry shot back immediately, tossing his head furiously. "Because…!" and then stopped, when words failed. Full halt, because how does one person confess to being lost without the other? He didn't know the words, the way the sorry tune went. He only knew the melody of melancholy, slowly transcending all the bright in his heart that had arrived along with Draco. "I—just," he managed to gasp, after a moment spent swallowing. "Draco."
—well, I'm sure you know where I'm going with that, right? So…I say we should invent one. A game, that is."
? I came in to say I was sorry, damn you. Not have a fucking snog!”
Harry thought, not heeding a word Hermione was saying.
“Not my account, love.”
—guttered out altogether and there was the hardy, heady slap of flesh on flesh, muffled by stacks of bound references, shelves of magical books listing against scrolls and pamphlets.
“Yeah.” Somehow, and mayhap due to Harry’s toes tickling away at Draco’s arches, they’d wriggled their way nearer each other in Draco’s bed, such that it wasn't much effort for Draco to reach out and tousle Harry’s hair. Harry flailed and grabbed at his hand, grinning. “Oi! Get off, you. Look, I’m really just sorry we had to hurt each other, learning it.” Seemed it wasn’t any effort at all for Harry to use that captured hand to haul Draco in for a warm, hearty hug. Draco went with it, bemused. “C’mere, do," Harry urged him. "Come on."
"Prick," Harry chortled, all laughing green eyes and teeth. "And how was
"Nope. That's it." The black curly tendrils quivered as Harry gently shook his head. His hair was a shade too long but Draco liked it that way, too. He wished he'd had the chance to observe Harry growing it out. If the world spun the proper way, he would've. He'd never have missed a moment, if he's his druthers. "Sorry, but not, Malfoy. I'm done, finished, through with you. And I'm leaving now. I never should've stopped to even hear you out, you know? I was just here for a break, to get out. And I have the bad luck to run into you. But it's over now. This isn't doing either of us any favours."
"Harry, please. I told you. I don't know what it was he said or
"Just sayin'," mumbled Weasley, subsiding. He shrugged in a half-hearted manner. "Y'know."
wanted to give was something of his own—his family's—to make it known that he and Potter were now—most definitely—
"No," he nodded firmly. "I don't, you great berk. Now," he nodded meaningfully towards his cock, damp with saliva streaks and bobbing urgently, abandoned, "could you please
when that selfsame heap of blazing ginger temper had had the gall to pop up in their Floo at three in the same bloody morning, also weeping cauldrons of foolish tears.
Harry moaned, attempting to impale himself on both intrusions, quivering and gasping fitfully.
Harry casts and casts and casts, saving only the modicum of energy he knows he will require when they all Apparate off away to safety at the close of the ritual.
Draco glared at her suspiciously. One would think one’s own mother would be more sympathetic?
“Best think fast, Draco.” Pansy rose, stuffing her knitting into a little bag tucked next to the sofa. She widened her eyes at him, tilting her pointy little chin in a challenging manner. “He's not a bad catch. I’d hate to see him forced out on the open market--and then there you'd be left behind, darling, moping about in your rut and wondering why life hates you. Let’s avoid that scenario if at all possible, shall we?”
He and Luna made nice with the helpful--and somewhat magically BeDazzled--group of Paleontological researchers who’d been kind enough to provide them access and then made their way to town.   Antillana del Mar was chock-a-bloc with ancient and historical everything, just clotted with the venerable, but it was also awash with tourists and the two Mages happily took refuge in the ever-reliable Los Blasones for a much needed repast.
Potter’s fidgeting  ran directly counter to Draco’s plan to work his way into Potter’s confidence sideways and carefully—and then inform him baldly he admired him. For his, uh, form. Whilst flying. And his skill, which wasn’t either an accident not a prophecy, but a gift. Right. He’d confess that well after there was any chance of being laughed right out of the room by a disbelieving Potter. Naturally.
. And I wasn't truly planning to brew the Amortentia, Harry—that was a placebo we made up, nitwit. Didn't do a fucking thing 'cept stink up my clothes. So you were safe, all along, alright? Don't let them tell you different; this is all
“I was hoping you didn’t have plans," Potter exclaimed, breezing through the open archway leading from their entry foyer to the flat’s much larger kitchen/pantry area. He shed his Ministry robes over the back of a chair as he went, bypassing the closet meant expressly for purpose of storing such garb with nary a glance, and grinned merrily at Draco in his passing, giving him a mately slap on the shoulder. "Slept well, I hope?"
Harry wrenched away as he whispered, ripping his person sideways and back a step, twisting nimbly, so the space grew between them form nearly nothing to what might very well become a whole universe. Till there was only his hands left on Draco's upper chest, splayed out wide and shoving. Draco, panicked, reacted immediately. "Wait—Harry, don't! Don't let go!"
"Fancy!" Draco snorted, shivering under his lover's hands. "Humph!" he sniffed. "That's all very well and I should bloody well hope so, Potter. 'Cause there's no fucking way in Hades I'm ever—ever—doing this again! No. Way. In Hades.
Potter nudged Malfoy hard in the ribs, sloshing the half-gone contents of Draco's tumbler. "Go on with you, git. Stop playing around."
"Mmph?"
—had been lost, and Slytherin House no longer being perceived as a bloody pariah, or its returning occupants either, Draco could confess his admiration freely…when they’d become better acquainted, of course. Potter had set the tone for it and all the Houses had fallen into line, like so many ninepins.
Harry roared, roused beyond bearing—a Gryffindor lion roar, too, deafening at close range when Sonorous’d—and launched his wiry form at his best friend since forever, stray people and foodstuffs flying by the wayside.
“Yes,” Draco nodded, casting his natural caution to the winds, and focusing on the real issue, as he perceived it, at least. “I know. But also--is it really fair to him, Pans? He’s been away for so long, you see, and I don’t want it just to be propinquity and his knowing we’re good in the sack together so maybe we should just make it official or something. That's not good enough. It wasn't then and it's not now, not for me.”
"What, Potter?" Malfoy glanced down at him, smirking. "You're back with us again, then? How pleasant. You might even endeavour to greet me—politely, this time. I prefer that to your usual Neanderthal growl, thanks."
“Nice form there. You think?”
be the same, fuck it."
, Ron,” Harry went on, enunciating. “I hate you now. Right now, this minute, I hate your bloody guts! Now, stop! Shut it, if you know what’s good for you!”
“What’s ‘more’, precisely?”
His face fell. His shoulders slumped. His kneecaps were full of the strangest sensation…and his wings slowed finally:
He blinked stupidly and Potter waved a quick hand before his nose, frowning.
His friends resumed inspecting their fellow mate quite carefully, presumably safe via the small distance they’d made disassociating themselves from him physically, much as one would view a mad Erumphant from the environs of a magic carpet, observing as it rampaged about the Gardens of Magical Zoology.
"Oh! I believe I'll have that one as well, thank you!"
He examined the utterly ancient claviform before him--shaped a bit like the letter ‘P’ but not really--and knew instinctively that Altamira was the
should be in charge of that, Draco! WE. ARE.
"Thank you. Send the bill to Gringott's, please, to my accountant's attention. Goblin Acrimonius Scofflaw the Third, his name is. VIP Wizarding Services, Huge Vaults Division."
“Time,” Harry stated firmly. He tilted his head, the better to peer into his partner’s eyes. “I, um. I have something to tell you.”
“But, Malfoy,” Harry craned his head so he could peer back over his shoulder, though he thankfully kept up the grueling pace as Draco left him go and fell in beside him. “I’m not sure that’s really true. Dumbledore fed me any number of lies and half truths, but he wasn't lying when he told me we were the two most powerful Wizards of our age. I think maybe Hermione’s the third, really, but Dumbledore was an arse like that, sometimes. And power itself isn't always the answer--as well we both know, remember?”
"Positive!"
"Thanks, Harry," she said. But passing gratitude for a friendly favour wasn't sidetracking her. "Still—a wimp and a bit of right tit, too, Harry," she went on, albeit very fondly. "But look here—if you
"Fuck!" Draco echoed faintly. They were, indeed, and Professor Snape would be on the prowl for him, and likely Headmaster Dumbledore, too, as he'd bloody promised his first born in exchange for having Potter returned, safe and sound, by the last fall of twilight. And fuck if the waxing moon wasn't already visible through the grimy window.
"Why?"
. Firm, juicy, delicious! Full of all the good things there ever, ever were, was Harry Potter—and Draco Malfoy knew exactly how to treat such a treasure. No one knew better than he! …With care, and fastidiously, and…and yet also rough and tough and strong. Harry was all man, damn it! Tears only confused him—the Brown bint's needy self-aggrandized agenda to procure a new bloke would only befuddle a congenitally idiotic nit like Harry further!
He walked through that door. Draco watched. In disbelief.
"I am, so shut it—" Harry began, but Draco was so done with the quiet pleading bit. It wasn't working, being meek, letting Harry say these things and not making a real effort to object. So he'd shout if he had to, right? Make a scene, if he had to. But not for people's attention, no. Just for Harry's, and maybe that way Harry would finally hear him?
"You," he addressed it suspiciously, "are very bloody weird—but helpful. I wonder if he meant to…?"
“Oh, yes,” Draco nodded eagerly, in full agreement. “Population. That’s a valid point there, Hermione. Wizarding society was all about increasing the ranks, from the very dawn of our history. Family is incredibly important to us as a society. There’s always been relatively few of us, a tiny fraction as compared to the Muggles, so rather naturally--”
"I," he hissed, chest gone tighter than a drum barrel head, and all the blood that had fled his heart busy pounding in his temples, "will not let you go, I won't. Come back to me, come back home. See bloody reason, for once in your life, Harry. Don't be such a child—and don't sodding lie to me! I won't stand for this, not any longer." He growled deep in his chest, eyes glittering, as he used to do, back in the day where he'd believed menacing was cool. The done thing, the coolest. And knew full well it was stupid to do it at this point, to Harry; that it sounded stupid, but it hurt, his chest, his head, every-bloody-thing—oh, so much, it hurt, having Harry like this, so cold to him. "You can't do this to me. You'll not leave
He could care less if she was Harry's old schoolmate from Gryffindor; he could give a flying pig—or fig—or wig—if she was in the midst of a messy divorce from that Finnegan chappie (up the Irish, mainly for realizing Brown was not all that; besides, Draco was rather pleased to learn Finnegan was breaking up with his horrid wife over that rather fit bloke, Dean Thomas.
Indeed, he hardly noticed the awkward pause going on in his own private little social huddle at all, now that Potter was zooming about in spasmodic up-and-down feints through the close-set hoops on the far end of the pitch, as if he were practicing some brilliant and modernistic form of aerial balletics. Draco hunched his shoulders forward, bringing his omniculars up to peer closely at the Golden One’s zippy acrobatics.
"But--"
! Oi, stop snogging, git—I
“Hey!” Harry looked startled. “How do you know about those, Malfoy? That’s Unspeakable business!”
"Hah!" Ron snorted. "As if anything's actually private, here. Look, Harry, Malfoy—we need you over there at the frigging Council of War the girls have going. Nev's inching his way towards being willing, sort of. I think Pansy's managed to convince him. Or maybe it's Luna—you know how she is. You agree 'cause you can't remember what the question was."
Characteristics
"Potter?"
"Mnnn, yeah. Okay," he mumbled, deftly avoiding Draco's lazy lips and lax tongue on his earlobe. "You win; I'll call her."
"So, er, don't go, alright?"
Harry cared for the little homewrecker, and so he had to ask after her, the wretched, pea-brained, built-like-a-brick-shithole twit. It was the done thing, that. Taking an interest.
"Mmm—oh, Harry—no! No, it's a lot of magical draw but we manage, together," Draco assured him, laying out his long arms along his lover's to keep them still. "I...I think." The nipple twisting was wonderful but horridly distracting. Besides, they'd bigger fish to fry. "No, I'm sure of it, actually." Their fingers curled into and through, twining lovingly. Draco dropped a constellation of kisses across Harry's hairline, encouraging him silently. "In fact, I
“Oh, Potty. Of course it’s alright; it’s not as though I’m not accustomed.”
Malfoy chortled, bucking that rather large part of him that was jammed deep in Harry’s arsehole. The resulting jiggle made Harry catch his breath in an inward puff, and he blinked rapidly.
." It was a hateful word, tumbling from Harry's mouth, all 'esses' and spite, and Draco watched them move around it, fascinated unwillingly. "I won't 'come on', not anywhere, not ever, not with you. I owe you nothing, Malfoy. Nothing. Go. Away!"
There was a moment more of rather noisy (what with everyone's elevated breathing and smacking of various people's lips) voyeurism engaged in. Then...
"Ha-ha-hardly slow, Ha-Har-Harry!" Draco squeaked. "This-this is! Not! Sloooow-ye
"Gods,
"Dad?"
Draco had a temper! He knew Draco was jealous as sin! He
"Boring," pronounced Nott. "I'm dying here." He flopped on the floor like an Inferi running out of steam. "You've gone and slayed me with boredom." He cocked an eye in Malfoy's direction and curled his upper lip scornfully. "Come on, Draco—you can do better than that!"
“Yes. We should likely kip over again, then, tonight,” Harry suggested, pouring out his second mug and feeling sufficiently restored to doctor it up with lashings of table cream and some local honey. He met Luna's weary gaze over the rim of it. “Seriously. Shan’t do anyone much good with the state we’re in now. I don’t much fancy Portkeying to the Netherlands; do you?”
The Weasel suddenly jostled Draco—knocking him hard sideways, so that he stumbled; rough enough to perhaps bruise his shoulder through the thin, fine-gauge wool he wore. Draco scowled in return but refrained from immediate hexing at Harry's matching scowl.
—Ernestine, Harry's Great Horned,
have the time for you. I don't."
odd? You're the one toting out spells from the bloody Dark Ages in DADA, Malfoy—and you're the one who wanted us to brew Amortentia for our Potions project! That's fucking odd, if you ask me! What in the blazes are you planning to do with that? Dose your little Slytherin slut of a fiancée?"
"Mmm'okay," Harry moaned, shifting just enough to escape a stray rock beneath his shoulder blade. For now, though, he wasn't comprehending so much as a single syllable. Bee buzz in his head, those Malfoy tones, and all that mattered was the lax laziness that left him replete and complete: he'd never felt this brilliant. There was nothing to compare.
"Oh no you don't, Harry! Don't touch me--get off!" Draco flinched, dropping his hands to his sides, clenching them tightly.
…And the lack of oxygen available for easy processing, which was causing him to choke on his own saliva, but that last effect—
to you. You won't like what
Harry. Harry being gone, the git. Inexplicably, endlessly, ruthlessly departed. There was nothing, that's all.
"What d'you mean, Malfoy?" Harry demanded suspiciously, his eyes darkening with the beginnings of anger. He might be in love—lust, desire, utter emotional chaos; whatever!—but that didn't mean he'd let Malfoy fuck with his heart. "Say what you
“You see what I mean now?” Draco asked tensely. “It’s that level of insane, Potter. You see how I’m counting on you, really. I don't know what else to do at this point.”
“It’s good, this. Being here. I mean, I was already pretty content with my lot; have been, but this is the improvement I guess I wasn’t aware I needed. Don’t mind it, really, if it’s a year--or longer, even. You?”
would, but still! You could be blabbing any old thing to random passersby and no means of controlling it!”
sufficient to allow that prat to illegally elope with MY SON?
"Oh, love, my love…" Harry whispered sweetly and thrust like the sodding dickens. "You—you're just—I fucking well love you!"
“Hmmm. You will, Malfoy? You’d do that for me?” Harry opened his eyes very wide indeed at the beaky nose level with his own. He earned a feline smirk and glancing kiss for it.
"Yeah?" Harry snapped back, a wee bit miffed. The pants and jeans stopped moving downward at knee-level; Draco frowned at them fretfully. "Well, sod the fuck off, rich boy—prat who shall be jobless when we matriculate. I
Draco regarded him dourly, nodded his grudging 'hullo' and continued to steadfastly sip his tea.
“I mean it, Ron. It’s noticeable. D’you think he’s lifting weights? That might explain it.”
In the dark. Under the covers. Alone, as he evidently really, truly was.
But the theme was by no means contained solely in the one wing of Malfoy Manor. Oh, no. Not a bit of it.
Harry—his Harry—was oblivious, yes. Draco was fully aware of Harry's failings—they'd been together five wonderful years, to date, and he could safely say he knew Harry very well. Far better than anyone else ever would, that was certain! And Brown had been dealt a raw deal, yes, but that was still no excuse to attempt to lay grabby hands on someone else's man! And—all that aside for the moment—La Brown hadn't a hope in the Seven Circles if she believed Harry Potter would ever fall for a damned watering pot with over-large mammaries and a piercing, head-splitting giggle.
Harry clamped his traitorous mouth into a thin anxious line without a second thought. Here it came, he was certain—the death knell.
"That's exactly what I'm saying, Malfoy—
"I know, love," Harry cooed in his ear, leaving Draco's chin go at last…and incidentally leaving dampened, pinkened skin and quite kiss-bitten lips behind him, too. "I do realize, really. Just, er. Just lean forward, alright? Relax, babe. I'll do the work."
"Let's," Harry murmured, and leant even closer, his lips a fraction from Malfoy's ripe ones. "Do just that."
A hand tugged a spare robe over Harry's goose-pimpled shoulders; he was snug and warm and lazy-cozy and tomorrow had never mattered less to Harry. He couldn't even conceive of tomorrow. He'd arrive there when he had to, not before—
…ah! Urrrgh—nnnh—Harrrreee!"
He flung out an accusing forefinger, indicating the giant four-poster bed the Room had kindly provided, situated just out of the more intimate circle created by the two sofas, the oval hearth rug and the low table set cozily between them. "Over yonder? Cause they'll not be able to see much of anything good, dumb arse, not if we're over there. Now, me, I admit I prefer a good, springy mattress—better all 'round, really, coming or going—but it's your call, Potter, so get it in gear, yeah?"
“What? Watch it, will you?”
“Right…fantastic,” Potter chirped. “Um, thanks. I appreciate it but you don’t have to—“
Both Nott
Harry fought back the rising bile. He was, without doubt, an idiot.
"One," Harry echoed, and almost said more.
“What? No! I’m not mad,” Harry had the nerve to deny, and even looked mildly puzzled at Draco’s perfectly reasonable accusation. “Why would you say that?”
"Then what?"
"Very. Exactly what I was thinking, Harry," Draco drawled. "'Interesting', though, is
"Oh, yuck, Seamus!" Brown exclaimed. "Put a stopper in it, will you? That's gross!"
"Um…here, then. We'll do it here," Harry decided abruptly, taking hold of Draco's shoulders and tugging uselessly at them. "Come up and 'round, please. Over the back of the divan, alright? Then they can't see absolutely everything—"
the direct and indirect cause of every single punishment he'd ever been given, both home and at Hogwarts. Potter, who had the most incredibly wiry, flexible body under those shamefully shabby clothes and nondescript robes, whose eyes were literally unmatchable, whose hard-soft mouth and agile, nervous hands delivered pleasure of a kind Draco had not known existed.
All—all he'd ever, ever want, Harry. His Harry.
Likely it was to be nasty anyway.
Struck by another stronger pang of nebulous concern, Draco drifted to a halt.
Hmmm…'dying for a smile'. Did this actually happen, in real life? Harry was of the opinion it might, actually. To him. And it would serve him right, wouldn't it?
"Harry, do you see?"
, Harry."
"What?"
"Yes!"
good.
“No, no, Potter, steady on,” Draco growled, catching Harry by his shoulders and bodily turning the smaller man so that he was facing the archway leading out to the Main Grand Staircase. “This way. It’s nothing Dark, I promise you--and it’s not down here. It’s up there, and it's out of control now.”
“Mmmm’kay.”
, either, Draco—a person can't live like that, always trying to be someone else. I should know, yeah?"
Draco flopped himself down by Harry on the settee and leant across to snatch up the remote himself, manfully not giving into the temptation to rudely jostle his mate's reading material. He flicked on the telly, landing by chance on The Doctor. The Muggles were quite obsessed with The Doctor and Draco did have to admit the story was a bit intriguing. He left it playing out of sheer unwillingness to channel-hop, hoping for some small measure of amusement whilst he waited for Potter to surface and acknowledge his existence. The talking box was generally good for at least that much. But idiot Potter relentlessly read on and on by Draco's side, eyes narrowed into a painful looking squint, scowling and occasionally mumbling beneath his breath. Fucking oblivious to everything, even that amazing Captain Harkness.
Namibia, the west coast of the African continent, close by Twyfelfontein, and he and the more than fifty other Mages are stood about in a loose circle, all under their various DisIllusionment charms. Harry and Luna, Millicent and Meneer De Oude stand in a huddling line, clad still in their various elegant dinner attire, having been pulled away by Chaz’s urgent summons mid-meal, and Harry shivers in the chill. Too, there’s an annoying bloody sandstone pebble already that’s somehow worked into Harry’s one dress shoe, chafing him.  Bollocks!
have. And Ron's tired of it, Harry—I mean to say, he's complaining to Seamus about you and you know it's bad with him when he does that. Besides, you're not really like this, Harry; you're a better man, deep down; you know you are! So, go! Go, gather up all that famous Gryffindor courage of yours and tell him!"
—look at him
He was all at once feeling quite hot-and-humid about the kneecaps and the base of his spine ached oddly, panging. He swallowed with difficulty, mentally flailing for composure. The Healer had warned him of what to expect but Harry had rather been hoping to be done with his part of the waiting paperwork for the case and be well away from Draco's vicinity before any of the patently obvious effects of the spell showed themselves. It only lasted a few hours altogether, Veritas, but he’d not been able to delay his return to their office any longer, as much as he wished he might.
“No. I’m serious; I need your help, really I do," Harry went on. "I’m glad you’re here and not only because it’s been far too long since we’ve had a chance to catch up. I’ve missed the hell out of you--and your bloody braininess. I need all those mental muscles of yours on my side right now. I’m a bit stumped with what’s happened here, alright, and I'm more than a little worried that I
Draco had been left sitting there at his own dinner table, rigid with shame and humiliation, surrounded by hostile Gryffindor forces and his own snickering lot of ex-Slytherins, with egg on his face and an hysterical Ravenclaw swot weeping into the linens!
Harry loved him. Those three little words allowed the sun to rise on better days; they caused his very blood to dance through Draco's veins; they conferred upon him such a great joy he could only articulate a bare tenth of it—and that not clearly. For he'd not ever conceived of such a very—such an incredible—oh, but such an amazing state existing within him! And he a Malfoy, known for the ice water that ran through his veins. A Malfoy to be properly Mated and not in some bloodless Blood-pure arranged marriage! And to Harry, the unlikely object of, well, many a long year of Draco's furtively passionate feelings!
“Oh! Hullo, boys!” Mrs Weasley greeted them cheerily, showing no sign of being at all perturbed by her sudden and unannounced visitors. "Brilliant you've popped in. Perfect timing." A host of Weasley family members and assorted guests murmured happily at them as two more place settings immediately arranged themselves upon the long refectory-style table, spare chairs bedecked with gingham cushions scuttling up with alacrity. “Couldn't have asked for a happier surprise, Harry, Draco, dear. I've a lovely roast joint Arthur's just carved. And Harry's favourite, treacle tart, for pudding after. Ready for luncheon?”
"Yes, Draco," Parkinson added, "have you thought of something new? Please, please, say you have, darling. I'm so fucking bored!"
Harry grinned, which sent his face into a crinkle of merriment. "Ah hah!" he exclaimed. "Thought it was something along those lines, Malfoy. You're so easy to see through, it's not even funny."
Harry shuddered at the resultant noises Ron made, all of them, and kept his eyes steady on Malfoy’s soothing hair. Really, this was disgusting, Harry fumed. Too much fuss! Idiot Ron!
"No, we couldn't," Harry shot back instantly. "Trust me—it wouldn't've been wise."
Besides, Ron was a terrible tease.  Ron was also on a hopelessly perpetual mental high because of all the steady shagging he was getting now that Voldemort was history. Ron, in a word, was a horrid git over it. A demon.
Very addled, actually.
Just like there was no comparison to what had just happened between them.
"They matter," Harry allowed. Their heads were so close together, the contrasting strands were tangling. "But you are tough, Draco. As nails. And Nev's just a baby, really. I'm not going to hurt him, alright? Neither are you and you know it, idiot, even if you won't come right out and say so. That's all there is to it, really."
"Oh, gods!" Longbottom moaned, and threw himself on the mercy of his teddy bear. "You really, really can't mean to do this, guys—I'm begging!"
"Good-oh! Nice to see you finally in a cooperative mood, Malfoy," Potter sneered, "I was thinking that never happened." But he did draw closer, and Draco waved his wand at him and then at himself, banishing their garb to a place that wasn't cobwebby and likely full of spiders.
“You do that, Harry,” Luna chirped, ducking back into the office floo. “I always do feel more relaxed when you’re slogging. But do try and have a little fun with it, all the same. How’s Draco been?”
And then fingertips found his nipples through the thin Infirmary gown Madame must have stuffed him in and twisted
Malfoy appeared very dubious over that idea.
"Huh?" Harry said, shaking his head to clear it. He placed a cool hand on his forehead, where it throbbed, and considered spelling his headache away. But better not; the pain might serve to keep him still and quiet and out from under Malfoy's expensively shod feet, which would be best, rally. He'd have plenty of opportunities to make a fool over himself over bloody Malfoy on the morrow. Besides, Hermione's references were always the most expansive and weighty—they'd make for fine full-body shields if ever she needed to use them as such. "What? Malfoy?" he added, feeling slightly addled. He was entertaining odd thoughts—he should chill. "Could you two maybe stop that, please? It's annoying, alright?"
"Yeah?"
Harry grumbled, but he didn't bother to protest.
"Let's play a game."
a tub and a loofah and at the very least a sodding folding screen 'twixt them and me, d'you hear? Just shut them out, Room—I beg you!
Shaking his head to clear it, Harry settled back down to his work.  A peaceful quiet quickly descended with Millie's exit for the Department of Mysteries was still mostly deserted. Even Unspeakables had to sleep sometimes, Harry knew, and half six in the morning was generally dead quiet. Which was exactly why Harry loved it so much, really.
do me the honour of accepting my hand and name while
And he sneaking glances at Draco in return, whenever he was certain Draco was intent on Dawlish's instructions, or when seated across the table in the canteen. And the passing brush of shoulders budging in the corridors and the exchange of smiles no one caught but they two. No, no one saw. Stealth-and-Tracking had its practical applications, yes.
"Alright. I'll just—"
visceral way, and no amount of distraction seemed to alleviate that feeling.
"Malfoy," Potter interrupted him.
“Oi!” Harry exclaimed, startled. "Watch out!"
More than a fool—criminally
"Hmph! I'll be fine in a moment. Give me a tick to recover."
“Yes, yes of course
"I," Harry squeaked, jumping where he sat, "wasn't—ever—couldn't bear—really,
"Ummm..."
Dry enough so that Harry's insides caught at his dick as he blindly shoved it in, creating a delicious but very nasty friction. The drag eased up instantly as they both shivered and Draco silently murmured the familiar lubrication spell inside his spinning head. Vigorously, he gave his all to pounding upwards into Harry's arsehole, his spine arched upwards in a perfect 'U'. Harry was nearly bucked off Draco's ramping, eager hips altogether, his teeth a'chatter …until they both moaned and groaned out the sweet muffled noises of their completions in glorious unison.
Alive, at last!
"Ansuz
And maybe that should be Harry. He rather owed it to Ron, after this episode. Personally.
“Now?” he jibed back at Harry. “Or in three minutes, when it’s bloody worn off? Which do you really want, Potter? Because I rather think waiting that three minutes is--”
“I’m sorry, I really am, and I will try to do better, I swear, but what I was trying to tell you is that, what with being away from so long, and then being back in familiar spaces again, like Grimmauld, it felt nice. Like having a home, of sorts. And you know, even if it’s only been Kreacher with me at Grimmauld, he’s still a living, breathing, talking being, right? It sort of felt like having a roomie, at least for a little, but you’re totally dead on. This is much better. Waaay better!”
They had somehow drawn closer together, their noses nearly bumping, their lips but mere inches apart. The warmth Harry felt radiating towards him had nothing to do with some little kid’s spell and everything to do with a deliciously tempting man not a palm’s breadth distant.
“Spain? Sunny Madrid, Malfoy? Never been there.”
Nevertheless, he muscled his way back into Harry's space again, sweeping an arm about Harry's back, and rather forcefully wedged Harry’s legs open with the hard bones of his hips and sank that eager dick of his a good two inches deeper—enough to leave Harry purring, almost without volition.
“Whoa!” Draco exclaimed, emitting an appreciative shriek of a whistle through his clamped teeth. “Now that’s—that takes bloody
Fucking Malfoy had forced him to grow up, the sod. Harry wasn't sure he was grateful for it. Oh, for the halcyon days of wondering whether Ginny might take pity on him and give him a free snog, since he was an orphan. He's been so naïve then, but now…now he wasn't, not about a lot of things.
Harry nodded absently, eyes sleepy behind his spec frames. Tugging and tucking away fussily at the rug, Draco could hear the sounds of the leftovers packing themselves away in the coolbox, and a rush of water splashing merrily into the sink. Cutlery clinked about as it was put away and the lid of the rubbish bin thudded shut. It was all very soothing and domestic to his ears--and it was  hugely different from the Manor. If he were still there, he’d have heard nothing of that; the Elves were far too well paid to let such sounds escape the kitchens. He’d likely have been subjected to the irksome piped-in sounds of childish lullabies instead, provided him courtesy the noisomely officious Nursery.
It wasn't as though he’d not had a few thoughts exactly along the same lines as what his friend was saying; it was just that it was difficult to verbalize. A nebulous wish and perhaps not even truly his own?
“Got a manual; from
"They are not!" Weasley started—and shut up when Parkinson pecked his nose. "Er. They're not, that's all."
"Ugh!" he moaned, rocking his hips frantically between the wool tartan and the rigid bones of Malfoy's pelvis, eyelids squinched tight in desperate delight. "Please, Malfoy—do it! I'm asking!"
"…What?" Harry asked, some moments later, when his lungs inflated. He fumbled hopelessly about for his specs, which were absolutely nowhere available, then resigned himself to squinting at the still apparently spinning vaulted ceiling. "Er, Draco?"
”, and oh my, but it was an invitingly whimsical summons, promising all good things in Nature.  Not creepy at all, no.
“What can I say?” Potter laughed, clearly unrepentant, though he did leave off contorting himself and settled comfortably back against the cushions. “Oh, that’s right--I can’t. I’m an Unspeakable.”
"Three fucking lousy little words, Potter, and you do me in, just like that," Draco growled, his boney hips budging insistently at Harry's thighs, forcing them to part. "Fucking derail all my good intentions—turn me bloody inside out. I do hate you for it, Harry—never doubt it. I hate you so, so much—always have."
"Oh, pooh," Harry laughed cheerily. "As if I ever really would. But I am sort of required to say it, at least, Draco, since I'm an--"
"Oh? That, then—that's what you meant?" He couldn't
"Er." Draco, who seldom blushed and especially not before his own parents, eyed his formidable Mum warily. Had his guilty fascination with Potter been that apparent all along? So blatently obvious even his own mother could see it plainly? How—how bloody humiliating! How…lowering. He hung his head, shamed and at a slight loss. He'd rather expected this to be more difficult, his confession. It was disconcerting that it wasn't. "Ah. Ah…hem. R-Right. I s'pose it has, hasn't it? A bit."
but a parental shite-storm, just as Potter had predicted would occur (showing a horrid sneaky Slytherin prescience). The prideful part of Draco planned to murder the knowing little sot simply for being so dreadfully knowing, as soon as his father finished flaying him raw where he knelt, taking the brunt of it.
"I never!" he exclaimed. "I can't even! Just--just stop!" Every little rolling chuckle out of Harry's lips was another quick, sharp knife to his gut. They wounded him, flayed him, peeled him bare and bleeding, they did. He couldn't wait to stop them from happening—he'd say anything, anything. To stop Harry from laughing away all they had, all they could have. "You know I always,
Warnings: Dithering. Scheming. Scant mention of possible mpreg. UST, PWP, parental humiliation tactics; Draco and Harry POVs, alternating. Veela!Draco, Mate!Harry. Top!Draco for those who mind that (but don't be counting on it, folks, cause whose more likely to be laying those Veela eggs? Hmmm?)
"To me it is."
"Directly after breakfast," Draco informed him. "I want to get an early start, before all the Thirdies clutter up the nicer shops. I've things I need—parchment, ink, a book—and we should stop in at Zonko's and Honeydukes—"
This autumn term had been unseasonably warm, true, but no one needed to be taught in a bloody sauna! Funny how he’d not noted it before, the discomfort. Draco would make sure to complain of it, next time. Made it difficult to concentrate, all that steamy warmth. Lack of ventilation, too. Some poor sod could pass out and possibly harm themselves in the midst of repelling a stray curse. It was DADA, damn it!
"'Kay," Harry blinked long and hard, enjoying all the sensations assailing him, not the least of which was anticipation. "Nitwit daredevil. Yes, then. Let's."
. As in shagging, snogging, dating down the village on the weekend; all that nonsense. Besides, we've need of your help, the both of you. I'm fagged with not being able to spend time with my boy—"
even said, for that matter, but I didn't mean it, whatever it was. Not to hurt you. I would never, ever hurt you, not by choice. Not by accident, either! You have to know that by now."
“No, not anymore they aren't,” Draco sighed. He shoved off his heel and began the walk at a fast clip down the plush runner. “If it were only that sort of business I could handle it all on my own, Harry. But, see? It’s this way now--" he waved a hand at the fairytale Arabian Nights accents--"and it’s become its own whole wing now, the fucking entity that's the Malfoy Nursery. It’s spilt over to the outsides too--all over the Gardens, even over to the Home Farm. It’s spreading like some Merlin-forsaken infestation, and it’s trying to entrap me in its foul coils.” He paused for breath, panting, and then let out a wild bark of laughter. “You know what?”
“So?”
Er, what? Harry recalled thinking, vastly surprised. What's going on?
. More than that. Not a place—not a thing, or possession.
"Yes?" Harry asked quickly, lunging upright. He couldn't do this, not curled in a cum-stained heap by his lover's side. Could not lie there, Draco's semen still in him, and await words that would shatter him like so much balsa wood—into splinters of Harry. Horcruxes of Harry, really. Murdered nameless, formless hopes. Foolish daydreams. Thus the prisoner awaited the executioner's axe, he believed. Impatient—eager. Needing closure. "Go on?"
Both cocks were perking up and taking notice, as per the resilient nature of the young and hale. A wave of returning desire swept through Harry; he luxuriated in it, hearing the answering echo in his mate's mind.
His mother nodded again, seemingly quite satisfied with whatever internal conclusions she'd come to concerning the newly revealed Potter-Malfoy misalliance—but, true to her generally reserved nature ,she wasn't being exactly forthcoming. Draco could only surmise what that mysterious nod meant and that left him feeling understandably uneasy. Not for nothing was his Mum a Black by birth, Draco knew. Rather…eerie, those Blacks. Peered into one's head at a drop of a hat, they did. Not at all nice, that.
"..ve. Me… here?" Draco trailed off, staring around at the newly done up front parlour of Grimmauld. "...
That was a valid question, exactly the sort Hermione liked to ask. He supposed he could be arsed to answer it, as he’d actually spent some fair amount of time sorting out why Malfoy’s hair fascinated him so. He pondered it in History of Magic, as Binn’s class basically lent itself to fucking off anyway. Plus Malfoy was in the same class and it gave Harry further opportunities to fine-tune his skills.
Harry scoffed.
Good friends and hard words.
, Potter!
"…likely we should talk this over. Not that I'm good at talking things over—rather pants at it, really, but—"
“Maybe you do, maybe you don’t.” Pansy shrugged, her eyes sparkling, “but someone had to say it, Draco, and Hermione’s not volunteering to do the dirty work. She's already done her part, listening to Harry drone on and on about your stupid houses and waffling over what’s best for you and whether you’d prefer this or want that or t'other. As if we all didn't already know you’re fucking lonely as hell, completely adore the prat and are practically panting after a family of your own to dote over! Now, be off with you. I have two sugar-high, mother-in-law-spoilt-silly toddlers coming home to me in a moment. I'll need all the mental energy I can summon!”
"Well…" Draco sighed and folded his arms across his chest. "I can't speak for you, Granger, but I'm bored shiteless."
Last year he'd not known what to give Draco. Other than his arsehole, his willing body, his furtive kisses, all those. But Draco had those anyway, and Harry thought they might not be enough, quite. He'd settled for calfskin gloves, handmade, lined with Charmed cashmere, and the hope that Draco's hands would warm to match his heart.
“Oh, for Merlin’s sake, Harry!” Wincing, Draco gasped roughly--his mate's grip on his ribcage was really terribly tight--and did the only thing he could think of to shut poor Harry up. He opened his mouth, angled his head and stuck his face upon Harry’s wet one. “Gnnnghh!”
Draco instantly looked away and mumbled. "Sick of him poaching." He brought his bent knees together with a thump. "Annoying."
“Get up, Harry!’ they’d tell him. ‘Get up, mate!’
"The less, um, nasty ones, that is. Not the violent bits. So, erm…I'll speak to you both soon again, shall I? Stay well. Cheers."
“Of course,” Millie smiled back sweetly, a hint of sharpness to the twist of her brightly painted lips. “I’d expect nothing else, Hars. But seriously--what flavour was it whetted your appetite? Blond or brunet? Did you keep a tally, like Luna did?”
"All because you were jealous." Hermione sniffed and bobbed her pretty little chin at her host, as if this was not normal, what Draco felt. As if a completely to be expected interest what one's lover got up to when one wasn't about was a crime against nature or something. "Dog in the manger."
Granger nodded.
Harry jostled him in return—hard.
, I just c-c-can’t m-m-manage--”
, rather, and yes, of course I'm sleeping; Merlin, Harry. I'm not a child! It's just that--that."
"Yes, it is. Naturally. You left me."
won't dare say a word against it. Or over
"No, no," Draco chuckled breathlessly, and fiercely remonstrated himself internally not to spring up and start pacing about Harry's office. "It's not serious, but then again it
"Huh. It's not even hate. Not anymore."
"Um, ahhhh…" His lover collapsed atop him. "So,

"Well, son, I cannot provide you all the ins and outs of it, but rest assured your Grandme're's ring shall bind you and your Harry much more intimately than you can even imagine." Narcissa winked at her son, a sign that the entire world had run mad and frothing. "You'll be all the more connected, Draco, in every possible way. You'll see."
"Quit it, you sneaky little bastard!" Draco snapped. "Stop shoving me about! We could just as easily have put on Glamours and rented a room-by-the-hour at the Hog's Head! If you'd bothered to ask
“Tosh!" he scoffed. "If you did, then I never responded because I’d already gone. I was off picking up Thai for us!” Draco sniffed indignantly. “In Muggle London, where Owls aren’t supposed to go! Because I’d not heard a peep from you--as usual, mind--and I knew you had some hush-hush project going on and I also bloody fucking absolutely knew you’d likely not even had eaten luncheon, much less any supper. Millie as much as said so. So! Pardon me for attempting to keep you stationed on this corporeal plane, Potter. So sorry for trying to help your sorry arse out--
Harry gasped with relief as he launched himself forward, across that intervening space. Like a rocket, like a missile, attuned to one target—the only other soul on the planet whose bloody interior bits matched up to his own so fucking perfectly, so utterly exactly, their fit was seamless.
. You didn't even say
"Bosh. You aren't. It isn't, and it's not the great huge tragedy you're making it out to be, either. It's fine, Draco." He shrugged, lifting his eyebrows quizzically. "You know? Hey, shit happens, yeah? Well, shit happened to
nervous!—armpit.
The wrist Harry had pinioned so fiercely turned counterclockwise in his grip and withdrew, tugging carefully away from Harry's clingy fingers. He'd expected as much and much sooner, really. Hadn't thought he could hold on forever. No one stayed forever, after all.
"Bah! Potter!"
“Shut up, you two!” Draco hissed, eyes narrowing in temper behind the omniculars. “Be quiet! If you can’t appreciate this, at least be still about it—I’m trying to
“A…’natural’, yeah?” Nott murmured at last, his watery blue eyes thin slits of Slytherin guile. “You don’t say, mate?”
One last grab, fingers extended so far Draco could swear they were actually growing inches before his Omnicular-enhanced eyes, and Potter was triumphant at last—and pulling up to a spinning halt, mid-air, his arm well aloft, the Snitch still fluttering feebly. A great happy grin split his bespectacled face and there was much cheering—even from certain Slytherins, one Draco Malfoy included.
“Whose, mate? You don’t mean Dean’s, do you? They’re nothing special, Harry. I mean, he’s alright, I s’pose, but still and all—nothing special. Now, my brother Charlie,
people, staring! Whispering amongst themselves, like thieves and Goblins!
"But?" Potter echoed. "You?"
“I’ll tell you!” Draco rolled his eyes madly. “It was the last straw, is what. I was coming up to my suite this morning after breakfast and it did the usual thing it’s been doing, the Manor, what with realigning itself and sending me off to the Nursery, right? Like I told you. Well, I didn't, but I meant to.”
Lovegood smiled to herself and waved her wand discreetly. The bear jerked just a tiny bit and then patted Nev's back very kindly with a soft plush paw, murmuring sweet things. Longbottom looked very startled all the sudden.
“Because you’re a heathen at heart?" Draco grinned. "No, I don’t know, really, Harry, but I do know what you mean, sadly enough. Oof, but that does feel good,” Draco answered, wiggling his own toes in his Molly-made socks, propped right alongside Harry’s. “Hmm. Bit chill in here, though. The Muggle air cooler machine Theo insisted on having installed must take after you, Potty."
Potter dithered, his green eyes darting everywhere. And every man Jack and Witch Jill was watching them. Draco blanched. He'd engineered it like this, but still…how humiliating!
"Draco." Harry was very seriously set upon this silly notion of his; clearly, as he saved the use of Draco's given name for those occasions when he wanted to wheedle. "Draco, I can't stand it. Dunno how you can, either. Come on, git! I want to be seen with you; I want it known, alright, and to do that we'll need some support. They're my best mates, damn them, and they
"No?" Harry was sliding; squirming his way off Draco's lap, and tearing his shirt over his head in the process, heedless of cuff and collar buttons. One or two pinged as the threads released and they shot off in various directions, striking photo frames and vases. "Mmmm, I beg to disagree, Mister Malfoy. I've a feeling I've tried your patience recently."
"You, Draco Malfoy, let the best thing that ever happened to you walk out that door," Hermione went on in a musing way, squinting at the door in question. Ron nodded eagerly, mute and scowling. "Did nothing to prevent it. Fool. Imbecile."
"Poking your nose in a private conversation, Weasley? Do you never learn?"
Draco drew in sharp, pleased huff; he nodded in a dignified fashion at Potter’s thanks, in acknowledgement of a deed well done.
"Sorry! Not
Yes, they'd been intimate. They'd shagged; they'd conducted themselves just as any of the others of their age group did, sneaking about and snagging opportunities to shag in corners, giggling themselves silly over the secrecy of it—the deliciousness. As if it were some great joke they were pulling on the universe—a palpable hit to the accepted and the usual. And Harry had likely been having some fun, too, which was perfectly natural. He'd never had much of that before and Draco knew that; didn't grudge him a bit of it, either. But that was all.
"Draco!"
"More?"
Draco howled again, arching his throat, sweat-drenched head lolling. He could feel the weight of his lover, hot and as damp with perspiration and musk as he leaning hard against his spine and hips. It was perhaps the best thing in the entire world, all that lovely Pottery sensation, in and above and all about him.
“Oh—my—gods, Malfoy!” Harry burst out. He glared at the wickedly grinning face  bobbing before his narrowed eyes. “You huge prick! You annoying twink! I can’t believe you’re wasting time over teasing me! Now—get on with it, git, or I’ll cut you off!”
"No, Mum, it's not quite like that--of which you are aware, so stop implying things--it's that I have a great deal of work before me and I really cannot just up and leave it at the drop of a broom bristle. Not that it won't be nice to see Potter again, of course."
