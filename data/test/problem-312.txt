Draco hears him, and bony fingers undo the clasp of his cloak, and he shrugs it off his shoulders.
“But it’s the middle of the night, and you never seem to sleep. Come on, Malfoy, why do you hang about here in the middle of the night?”
Good. Harry doesn’t feel like talking to her right now. He still can’t figure out how she had known immediately after the holidays, and it took him months to figure out, but he feels like he won’t know unless he asks her. And he won’t. Not yet.
Harry lets the confession slip past him without meaning to. He had never told anyone that, not even Ron or Hermione, but there’s no quick building panic when he realises what he’s just said.
“The Forest is the same,” Draco quietly voiced his thoughts. “Everything’s just… hollow now.”
Draco is wearing his silk pyjamas and one of his dressing gowns, the sash tied loosely around his waist. His hair is tousled from sleep, and he has his wand stuffed in the waistband of his pyjama bottoms.
Pomfrey is gone, she could be back at Hogwarts, or in the room where Draco had been taken before the door was slammed in his face.
Draco snuggles further into his cloak, shoulders shaking. Harry casts a warming charm.
about me in the forest, you thought I was up to something! You probably thought that I was on some mad quest to bloody resurrect the Dark Lord!”
Harry had never truly been scared of the Dursley’s when he was living with him. Oh, there had been times that he had been frightened, times when he wished he could become invisible or run away, but truthfully, Harry had grown used to the way they treated him. Try as he might, he could not remember his parents when he was small, and even now he only had a few fleeting memories of them, most of them given to him by other people.
“Didn’t see you over Christmas.” Harry tries to make his voice sound casual. “Did you go back with your Mum in the end?”
we could do about it, and I stopped sleeping. Every few nights I get a few hours… but I don’t want to sleep because -.”
” And that was fine by him, because he never had to see any of them again.
Harry shrugs. “I guess. I just wanted… To know if you were alright, that’s all.” He lies.
Draco is seated at the end of the table, in the same position as he was in Transfiguration, except his hair is tucked back behind his ears. Harry assumes it’s so it doesn’t get in his food, but it makes the bruise on his chin stand out starkly on his otherwise pale skin.
Draco takes the trolley from Harry and walks briskly to the end of the aisle, weaving through muggles with polite murmurs. To anyone else he must look like a normal shopper, but Harry can see the stiffness in his legs, and the way his knuckles are white where his long fingers wrap tightly around the trolley handle.
“I’m a wizard without a wand.”
. He defeated the Dark Lord at the tender age of seventeen, and here he was, paralysed by the thought of an uncle he hadn’t seen since he was a teenager.
“Mm,” Draco mumbles.
“You weren’t the only one who lived through a war,” He snaps.
“It was a queer, sultry summer, the summer they electrocuted the Rosenburgs, and I didn’t know what I was doing in New York. I’m stupid about executions. The idea of being electrocuted makes me sick -”
flickers, and so he casts it again. He crawls over to the edge of the bed and lies down in the hot space that Draco left, and puts his arm to the floor and feels around for his glasses.
“Dreamless Sleep, are you sure?”
“Do you want to go? Like, really want to go?” Harry whispers to him. Draco draws himself up to his full height, an inch above Harry, and reminds Harry of a peacock with ruffled feathers when he sneers.
once to relight the fire, and glances at the box of matches on the arm of Malfoy’s chair. Harry hadn’t even thought about it, but of course Malfoy didn’t have a wand to light the fire. He didn’t even want to think about what that must be like for Malfoy; Harry had known a life without magic. Malfoy had made his entire identity of being a wizard and a Malfoy, and then he had lost that. With Malfoy senior in Azkaban, the remaining two Malfoy’s had been disgraced, Draco lost his wand and Narcissa was on house arrest for the foreseeable future.
The last time he had seen the Dursley’s was when they went into hiding, just before he went on the run. Harry didn’t think about them, refused to allow himself to be swallowed by the past. The most he allowed himself was the memory of Dudley’s clammy hand shaking his, and his confession of “
“Dunno. Didn’t read it. It’s still in the kitchen. Funny though, there wasn’t a full address, and it was in the kitchen and not the post box, so he must have delivered it the wizarding way. Which could imply…”
“Draco?” Harry tries again.
Madam Pomfrey rushes out from her office, and despite the situation Harry finds her presence a small comfort.
Harry pats his hand, and rejoices slightly when Draco doesn’t pull away. “You’ll get it back soon, and it’ll be like you always had it.”
“And then I learnt about the stars, and their names and the constellations, and which planets were there and which planet had which moons, and it was nice, knowing that my name meant something important. Did nothing for my ego, though. And then it was a comfort, knowing that whatever happened, the world would still be turning. But now… I feel like I’m going to fall off at any moment.”
He pulls out his wand and kneels down beside him, slowly wrapping his arm around Draco’s shaking shoulders. Draco flinches, but he doesn’t push Harry away, and Harry counts it as a win.
He pulls on the new jumper Molly had knitted him for Christmas, tucks the map under his pillow and then trudges down the cold stone steps. He spots Malfoy immediately, in the small room it was impossible not to.
Draco flinches at the name, and then a full-body shudder passes through him as he wakes properly. He stares at Harry’s wand, still casting
Malfoy sighs resignedly, and takes the proffered hand. His own hand is cold. Harry pulls him up, and then rights him when he nearly stumbles over. It feels like he weighs almost nothing. (For some reason it occurs to Harry that the last time they touched, Malfoy was screaming and holding onto him so tightly it hurt. That seemed like a lifetime away from now).
pace around his room.
Predictably, Malfoy doesn’t answer. He turns away from Harry and lies flat on his back, fingers entwined on his chest, over what Harry knows is scarred flesh. Harry wonders if it still hurts.
Still, Harry practically drags Draco inside. Once they were through the doors Draco became both nervous and unwillingly fascinated with every item, wanting to touch every object on the shelf, though would say that he hated muggle supermarkets if asked, just as he always did. It was the same fascination Harry had seen in Ron. But Draco (who luckily had been less adverse to dabbling in muggle fashion, and so did not look too out of place) is still almost clinging to Harry’s jacket through every aisle, though Harry’s pretending that he’s doing no such thing.
Harry wants to argue that it wasn’t exactly the same, and whereas Harry’s scar had been awful, it hadn’t nearly slashed through his arteries.
“Did… The other muggles, did they know? That’s not… that’s not normal for a muggle to do… is it?”
“Oh, merlin. What happened? I hope you weren’t fighting.” She doesn’t say it particularly accusingly, and Harry spares her a glare, because he supposes it wouldn’t’ve been particularly out of the ordinary in the past.
The laughter from the surrounding tables came as no surprise to the golden trio, even less of a surprise was that the slytherins were the loudest. However what did come as a surprise was that Draco Malfoy wasn’t at the center of it. In fact, this had been the topic of great concern to one Harry Potter and Hermione Granger. They had been rattling on about it since Draco had left the Great Hall. Much to the dismay of the two Weasleys who were with them and could care less.
Hermione smirked, “Hi Ron. Harry, Ginny.”
Draco glared and snipped, “Of course I will, Granger. Have some patience won’t you?”
This needs to be explained or the fact that Slughorn was perfectly fine with Blaise Zabini ditching his class would not make sense. To the members of the Slug Club, Slughorn was extra relaxed when it came to rules. However Blaise ditching, meant that Draco did not have her typical partner. A fact which when pointed out to Slughorn caused Slughorn to change everyone’s typical potions partner.
Weeks passed with the same routine for one Malfoy and one Granger. Breakfast with their friends, go to class, meet in the room of requirement after classes, hang out together until dinner, eat with their respective friends, go to their respective dorms, sleep and repeat.  Of course after the first week, a hufflepuff and ravenclaw saw the two of them leaving the room of requirement together and from then on rumors of their “love affair” had began to spread. Which whenever they were asked, they denied it.
Draco repeated, mumbling, “I’m not a boy.”
“Hermione and I?” Lyra was disgusted by the implication that someone who she felt was like a sister to her as her girlfriend, “Heavens no!”
Hermione looked at Draco, the feeling of concern once again surfaced. She looked at the blonde haired boy in front of her and almost saw the internal conflict going on within him. Of course, she didn’t know that the boy was a girl and that that was the conflict. Hermione was very smart, it would take her only a little while longer to figure out what was going on. She would also need to consult Luna, the local expert on this kind of thing.
Hermione stared at the blonde as she trailed off. A moment passed before Draco said, “I’m a girl. I’m not supposed to be but I am. I don’t know what to do. My parents will kill me.”
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
After ten minutes of pushing food around her plate, Draco stood up. Murmured some half-ass excuse and walked out of the Great Hall. She did have intention to go and drop by McGonagall’s office before her first class. Though as she was walking towards the tower that housed McGonagall’s office, she found her feet moving in a different direction. She moved down the hall towards the dungeon where her common room lived then turned before reaching it and went up a staircase and out a door into a courtyard. She walked over to a bench by a tree and collapsed.
“Don’t know what?” Harry asked, nervously.
Draco shrieked, “I’m not a boy! I’m broken. It’s all your fault! You introduced me to what it's like to be a girl. And- and…”
“So that’s the plan. How do you feel?” Hermione asked. Her, Luna and Lyra were all sitting in the room of requirement.
Her sobs were made of mourning and self disgust. She hated herself for being different, she hated her body for being wrong, she hated the world for having herself be this. She mourned all the relationships she thought she had and knew she’d loss, she mourned the sense of self she had, she mourned the confidence she felt herself losing, she mourned the death of the person she thought she had.
“Oh my god…”
Luna meets Lyra.
“Of course, I wouldn’t tell anyone!” Granger said, “It’s not my secret to tell.”
Sorry for this being updated so much later than it should've been. Thank you so much for the kudos. Enjoy!
The tone and look Draco possesed made all the slytherins drop the subject quickly. Goyle jumped to change the subject, “So that transfiguration quiz was hard right?”
He thought about the Weasley twins and their pranks, Molly Weasley’s delicious mince pies, Ginny. He thought of how he absolutely adored the Weasley family, how they were the family he never had. His eyelids became heavy. Feeling warm and content, he started to doze off.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Hermione stroked Lyra’s hair. Smiling softly, she said, “I genuinely doubt she wouldn’t accept you. Luna’s nice.”
Hermione looked at Lyra and carefully said, “Yes and no, why don’t you introduce yourself?”
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Snape was Draco’s Godfather in connection to his mother, who he went to school with and became good friends with. After the events of the last year and the summer, he had been tasked with keeping an extra close eye on him throughout the school year. That’s why Draco’s absence the afternoon and into the evening the previous day was so concerning to him.
Luna looked at him for the first time since they started talking and Harry stopped himself. He continued, “You know what, that doesn’t matter. I just, I don’t know what to do Luna.”
Draco responded, “Well I guess they could be but I don’t like it regardless.”
Draco looked at the curly haired girl with wide, puffy eyes. She contemplated, it was tempting. Very tempting, she knew that no one in her own house would do this. She wanted somewhere where she could be herself. She might as well since Hermione already knew.
Harry paused for a second thinking before answering, “It can’t be easy, being a part of his family. He must have a lot of pressure to be perfect, I’m sure his parents weren’t happy he didn’t become a member of the slug club.”
She tried to reassure herself that Granger wouldn’t do that. Would she? Draco didn’t know. Draco wouldn’t know. Draco felt herself starting to cry, she COULDN’T cry in public. If anyone in her house heard about her crying in the library she’d be ostracized for sure.
I'm so sorry this took such long time to write. My life has been chaos for the past 5 months or so, I just haven't been able to keep up. Don't worry I will try to update more often.
Though Lyra knew that it was less than a week the first snowfall would come and destroy the beauty of autumn. Lyra knew to enjoy the beauty while it still lasted.
Draco looked him dead in the eye and in poisonous voice said, “I haven’t a clue on what you’re talking about.”
Hermione’s concern increased when she heard a sob emit from the blonde sitting with his back to her. She’d seen him from the window pulling at his hair but she didn’t expect him to be crying. She stood a moment, unsure what to do. She climbed over the bench and in a gentle tone said “Are you ok?”
Crabbe and Goyle shook their heads, saying they hadn’t seen him since breakfast for Goyle and Potions for Crabbe. McGonagall nodded, “Well if he doesn’t have a good reason to miss class, I’m afraid I’ll have to take some house points from Slytherin.”
“It’s just,” Ginny took a breath and looked away, “I don’t know anymore, Harry.”
It was Hermione and Luna’s turn to look at each other. Luna was the one to speak, “You’re right, Harry. It is rather presumptuous, perhaps he is just having a particularly bad year. After all, Lucius Malfoy is in Azkaban. That can’t be easy.”
“Oh yeah, you and Parkinson split up recently,” Harry murmured and laid back.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
This was not a harmonious pairing. The two of them got along dastardly. That is to say they didn’t. The two apparent boys sat next to one another, the air between them thick with uncomfort. The blonde haired one was trying to focus on her notes and book, they had to brew a Pepperup potion. A potion that fell into the must know practicality category. It helped to relieve cold(and other ailments) symptoms, a very practical potion indeed.
Harry noticed that Luna was blushing. That’s odd. Harry then said, “Luna, look at me.”
Draco’s attention was drawn back to her own table when she heard the clank of metal against china. She turned her attention to Pansy sitting next to her, whose mouth was agape and eyes were wide. She turned to look at Crabbe and Goyle, who both had a similar expression. She growled, “What?”
She ran past classrooms, up and down multiple staircases, through the great hall and finally out the castle doors. She ran the grounds towards the forbidden forest, when she saw the groundskeeper/care of magical creatures professor's hut, she turned and ran the opposite direction. She ran past the quidditch pitch.
“Sorry,” Lyra laughed, wiping the tears from her eyes, “It’s just, who would’ve thought that we would be complaining about our exes?”
“I mean, I know a place that we could meet and I could cast the spell and then we could just talk and I could help you get used to being a girl,” Hermione explained.
Draco’s eyes began to water as she choked out, “I’m right.”
Lyra pulled back, she knew she wasn’t hurting Pansy that badly. She knew she needed to be harsh, after all she had a reputation to uphold. She looked away, “I said I think we should break up.”
(See the end of the chapter for
Draco looked at the muggle-born girl, she felt a pang of guilt. Both because she had treated this girl so poorly in the past and because her family would disown her if they knew she was hanging out with a mudblood. Draco internally scolded herself, no purebloods would have offered to help her like this. Well maybe a Weasley would but in a way that’d be much worse than hanging around a muggle-born.
Apparently this was enough to draw Harry and Ginny back to reality from their eye-canoodling. Harry, just now, noticing Hermione greeted her. Hermione continued, “I’m serious Ron. He was too natural, too comfortable. It was almost like the hex was the most magnificent thing to happen to him. It was weird.”
The two girls looked at each other. After a moment, the blonde began to giggle. Soon both girls were giggling with excitement. Draco stood up and spun looking down, giggling. She shouted “Look at me! LOOK AT ME!”
That morning at the Slytherin table, Draco was silent again. Even though she knew she should feel better after yesterday but she didn’t. In fact she felt worse. Snape’s distraction when she woke up was only temporary, she felt horrible when he left. Her fellow Slytherins were laughing and talking all around her.
She began to run as a sob escaped her body. She ran, she didn’t know where she was going, she just ran. She brushed past two people coming into the library. She rushed past a group of first years, knocking one of them over. She couldn’t think she just had to run, she had to get out.
“Is that Draco?” Luna asked pointing at Lyra. Lyra flinched back.
"I can help you find a name!" Hermione said, excited at the prospect.
“Blegh!” Ron stated, simply.
in the mirror. She was amazed by the feeling,
Luna then pulled Lyra into a hug excitedly, saying “We’re sisters!”
Draco pulled the chair next to Hermione out and plopped down. She continued, not making eye contact, “So um that hex you used. Where’d you learn it?”
“Then why don’t I come with you some time?” Luna asked. Hermione paused and thought for a moment. She couldn’t see why not and Luna may help Lyra.
” body.
“I’m trying to ‘Mione. I just,” Lyra took a breath, “I’m just nervous. I mean she’s the first person who’s going to meet me like this. Other than obviously. I’m scared, what if she doesn’t accept me, Minnie?”
As soon as she left, Blaise was the first to brave the subject. “What is going on with him?”
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
“What?” Pansy shrieked, the few students in the common room turned to look at the two of them.
that swelled within her.
Draco's face scrunched for a second in confusion. Then she showed recognition as she responded, "I guess I haven't thought of it."
“Huh?” Lyra breathed.
Lyra looked up when Hermione walked past, she almost missed the paper that Hermione dropped. She picked it up, read the note, and finished eating. Once she’d finished eating she ran to her dormitory quickly to grab some homework to work on with Hermione.
“Curiosity. I’ve never heard of it before,” Draco made eye contact. Hermione doubted that answer, she arched an eyebrow.
One such morning, Harry sat on the shoreline of the lake staring out at nothing. That morning, he had skipped breakfast entirely. It was Saturday and he had no plans. A few couples had come down to the lake for alone time, like him and Ginny had done many times. Seeing these couples be so happy made him sick with anger. The last thing he wanted was a reminder of him and Ginny.
Ginny sighed and looked Harry in the eye, “I think I need a break.”
Lyra burst into the room of requirement. She slid down the door, tears in her eyes. Hermione and Luna stared at her a moment and then ran over to her.
“Then what was that?” Blaise asked.
Lyra’s adorable look of determination made Luna and Hermione smile like proud parents. They waited a few moments in silence before Hermione asked, “Are you gonna g-”
Ron scoffed and began to glare at Hermione. Hermione glared back, daring him to challenge her. Harry and Ginny exchanged a look, concerned. Ginny, after a beat, asked, “Ok, can we just not discuss this at breakfast? We’re all hungry and not thinking straight so just eat.”
Lyra wailed, crying harder, “P-potter.”
A few hours earlier, when Lyra had arrived. Hermione had changed her physiology and then allowed her to change into more comfortable clothes; before asking her if she’d like to introduce herself to Luna.
“Yes, Granger?” Although he had the intent to sound intimidating, his voice as a female was more like a sickly sweet poison.
“Hm?” Draco said, acting innocent, “Oh well perhaps.”
Feeling satisfied, she laid back down. She knew she’d have to face things tomorrow but for now she could just lay there and dream. Dream of the future, the present and the past. She dreamed of being raised as a girl, she dreamed of befriending a certain Potter, she dreamed of her father being content with her and no longer having the pressures of his expectations, she dreamed of he-must-not-be-named never returning, she dreamed of having a normal school life, she dreamed of going to Durmstrang or Beauxbaton instead of Hogwarts, she dreamed of being sorted into the other houses. Anything she could conceive that was light and positive, she dreamed of it. Awake and staring at the ceiling. Even after Crabbe and Goyle came into the room and got ready for bed. Long past the two of them had fallen asleep and started to snore. She dreamed of another world, where she’d been a muggle or muggleborn, where she was the envy of all girls, where she was respected for her kindness instead of feared for her cruelty. She dreamed of power and of lost, she dreamed of love and hate, of respect and fear, of joy and sadness. But over all, she dreamed of living in a world where she was who she was supposed to be. Where she was female.
Hermione asked, “What’s wrong? What happened?”
The blonde interrupted her, “Why would I open up to you? Even if I did have something I wanted to tell someone, you’d be the last person I’d tell.”
Blaise continued the joke, “Or perhaps he enjoyed being a girl very much, I mean I know I would.”
They both heard someone crying inside the room, Harry asked, “Who’s crying?”
Lyra collapsed onto the couch, resting her head in Hermione’s lap. After they had discussed for a long time, she had agreed to meet Luna. Then Hermione sent her otter patronus to Luna, asking her to meet her in the room of requirement a quarter past noon, alone.
Ginny looked pitifully at the boy in front of her. Gently, she muttered, “I don’t know.”
By the time Hermione had gotten back to the Gryffindor common room, the hex had already worn off. She whispered the password to the fat lady, who swung open. In the common room, which was high up in a tower and covered in red and gold, the rowdy and rambunctious gryffindors sat, studied, played, flirted and spoke.
“Part of it?”
While flying around the pitch, Harry spotted Luna walking along the edge of the lake. Suddenly it hit him, Luna! He dove down and landed. He jogged out of the pitch and to where he’d seen Luna.
his body. It finally felt perfect. He was switching between glaring at Hermione and admiring his own “
For anyone else this would have been a relief, but for Draco it only brought discomfort. She looked at herself, now male, in the mirror and only felt dread and disappointment. She hated who she saw, she hated the body, the face, the voice! none of it was right! Now she understood why.
Draco jumped and walked over to the couch. She sat down and smiled at Hermione. Who responded with, “What a room, huh?”
“That’s a star.”
“Interesting? Well I’m sure anything with a female Malfoy would be,” Ron chuckled. Hermione smiled and laughed with him. She instinctively laid her head on his shoulder but only for a second before pulling away. The laughter on her part became awkward but Ron barely noticed. She wasn’t sure what the shot of adrenaline to her stomach was but it startled her.
Snape asked, “Do you think you’ll be able to go to class? If not you’ll have to go to the hospital wing.”
When Draco walked into the damp dungeon that was the Slytherin Common Room, no one was surprised. By that point almost the whole school had heard what happened. Some of the students hid giggles behind hands, quite a few of the guys smirked and catcalled. Draco just glared in their direction.
Hermione snorted, “What? No of course not.”
Luna was surprised to see another girl standing in the room, she had expected to meet Hermione and Draco Malfoy. She looked at the unfamiliar girl up and down, trying to connect the dots.
Harry and Lyra both laugh, they make eye contact. It only made them laugh harder. Both of them were surprised by how comfortable they feel. Lyra sighed.
“Everyone did. Obviously, I’m attractive regardless of sex.” Draco retorted, flipping her hair. Pansy, Draco’s on and off again girlfriend, walked over.
On her way out, Pansy grabbed her by the arm, “Darling? Can we talk?”
Luna put a reassuring hand on her arm, “It’ll be ok Ly. If anyone tries to talk to you just look spacey and walk past them. I do that all of the time. Unintentionally, of course.”
Lyra ventures around the castle as herself for the first time. Harry and Ginny are having issues.
Harry shifted to lean against the couch. He sighed and rubbed his eyes. Scolding himself, he shouldn’t be thinking about Draco in that way, let alone another guy. Hell he shouldn’t be thinking that way about anyone. He’s in a happy relationship, right?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
“A short break or a forever break?” Harry could feel his heart breaking, he was sure that this isn’t what he expected or wanted.
That afternoon after potions, both Hermione and Draco said goodbye to their friends saying they were heading to the library. Both met two staircases away from potions, Hermione grabbed Draco’s hand and started walking up to the 6th floor.
“Yeah, it’s beautiful,” Draco said.
She brushed past him and ran to the castle. Harry called after her, “Wait!”
Harry stammered, “Ginny…”
Hermione said, “Hi Luna.”
“You better not call her that to her face,” Hermione scoffed. Lyra nodded, right as the door opened. Lyra jumped up, eyeing the other girl in the doorway nervously.
Snape spoke, “I leave you to get ready, then.”
Luna said very softly, “Hi.”
Lyra had spent the better half of the morning studying. She had decided to go for a walk along the lake before lunch to clear her mind before returning to her studies in the afternoon. There was something so peaceful about the lake in October. The leaves had turned orange or brown and were falling. The lake's water cooled and the giant squid began to prepare for the frost of winter. The castle looked beautiful during the autumn. More beautiful than in the winter Lyra believed.
Yesterday Draco had been leafing through
And it
“Oh, I thought it would be later,” Harry replies.
“Shh,”
Waiting in that empty white corridor with the white floors and the white walls and the white ceiling, Harry becomes hollowed out. He’s legs are weak, and he doesn’t think he’ll be able to stand even if he tries, and he just stares blankly at nothing.
All Harry can do is just hope that Draco won’t do it again. The thought of him dying is unbearable.
“You… You could try going to Pomfrey, she’d give you some Dreamless Sleep if you asked, she won’t give me any since… She would give you some.”
There are multiple empty chairs dotted around the classroom; the Eighth Year wasn’t as large as the others. Harry can sit anywhere, but there’s only one place where he wants to sit.
“See you.”
“Hm. Say, tell me, Harry, would” Draco lowers his voice to a conspiring whisper, “the
Harry knows where.
When Draco’s tears taper off to the occasional gulp, Harry asks to see his injured hand.
“Thanks.” Draco huffs a laugh, but it’s not genuine.
It’s not like Privet Drive, but a cupboard is a cupboard. It’s enough to let him think. And as he does so he comes to the conclusion that there is absolutely nothing that he can do.
The pieces of the puzzle slotted together into a disturbing picture in Harry’s mind, and it made horrible sense. It explained why he’d been so avoiding when Harry asked about his holidays, why he had snapped when Harry pushed about the dreamless sleep.
Draco shakes his head, looking awkward and out of place in his own bedroom. He wrings his white hands together. “You alright?”
The anger is still there, and he stares back at the Gryffindor, who is beginning to rise to his feet, and he moves for his wand but Draco holds him back.
Madam Pomfrey
Harry can’t think of anything to say either, and for the rest of lunch they lay next to each other with their fingers entwined, and Harry wonders what he’s doing.
Alrod replied, "Gringotts has services for these sorts of things, Lord Potter, as well as St. Mungos and any capable Wizarding Hospital. Of course, it will be quicker here. I would recommend having a cleansing here."
Harry's eyes widen, "He was?"
Harry nodded and asked, “How will we get this to the ministry, Alrod? I assume they need to be informed for Sirius to get his trial.” Alrod inclined his head.
“This leads to your other possible guardians. As you have seen, half were incapacitated while the other half of them did not respond to their roles as your godparents, though they did not reject it, not that they’d be able, as Magic has recognized them so. It is because of this that Dumbledore willfully appointed himself as your Magical Guardian,” Alrod sneers, displeased.
Harry blinks up at him before he snaps out of it and grabs the fallen rucksack from the floor. He nudges around inside, jumping a little when his arm goes deeper than expected. He glances at Corvus questioning.
The Gaunt Lord ring, the one he was most apprehensive of, the one he got from
Harry's worries were put on hold when he saw Remus take a deep breath, only for his head to snap to the other side, right at the corner where Harry sat. The young wizard froze in his seat as his eyes stared back at the werewolf's eyes, almost as if he was looking straight at him. Harry panicked for a minute, thinking that the spells on him had fallen. It couldn't have possibly fallen, right? Alrod said it wouldn't!
Harry cocks his head, “So it’s not a bad thing?”
the Minister and Headmaster.”
Alrod nods, “Yes, they are bound to Hogwarts itself, and, as you own 1/2 of it, they are, in a way, yours. They serve the students there, cooking for them and cleaning their rooms, though they do not answer to them as much as a house-elf that is bound to them. They will answer to you, though, as you are Lord Gryffindor-Slytherin.”
Harry rakes his eyes over himself, young, small and so innocent, trusting the him that was older but still the same person as himself, and Harry decides he should explain some things first.
Turns out, most wizarding places had this sort of nobility or families that are firmly involved in the country's history, politics, or governance. It was nepotism to the highest degree in some places, Britain especially, but Lords and heirs, although involved with politics, were not automatically Ministry Officials, just members of the Wizengamot, and this made learning how to pass laws or not easier as a Lord or guardian could just teach their heir the ins and outs of the Wizengamot.
The guests had started to leave, Amelia Bones being the first one out the door. She had an innocent man to pull out from prison and a retrial to plan (she was currently unaware that there was no trial to
by Marion Fiddlewood,
Corvus glares from his position on Harry's head, though he didn't see from his position, "Hello, Vernon."
Harry huffs and rolls his eyes, moving to go back to the kitchen. Harry got to finish setting up breakfast when uncle Vernon comes in, red-faced, turning purple, and clutching a letter in his beefy hand.
He was just closing the door when he heard the flapping of wings on the other side of the room. Looking up, he saw that Corvus had opened the window and was just letting in his owl, Caligo. Smiling, he walked towards the pair.
He also noticed how he glanced at the professors and how they stared at him in shock. He gave a nod to them, which they numbly returned, and sat on the opposite side of the professors. Harry had no time to wonder why the man sat so far because the next person came in just as he sat down.
“It says here that I own ½ of Hogwarts, but it also says I have 20%. What does that mean?” Harry asks after reading through his test again.
He only felt calmer when his hand was squeezed by Harry. Whatever they'd done, they wouldn't do it again now that he's here. He'll be able to protect him now.
Harry smiled at the thought of being Corvus' ward but frowned at a part of their plan. "What do you mean about the guardian bit?" He asked, cocking his head to the side.
If ya'll have notes on how to make a protective mama bear and an indulgent and willing, affection starved baby bear not seem co-dependent, I would love to hear them (ヾ;￣▽￣)ヾ
"I'll be staying with Harry until Sunday, which is when he'll presumably get picked up by his friend's family," He states, not bothering to ask permission, before ne raises his brow, "Assuming, you'll let him leave without making a fuss, that is?"
"Oh," Harry let out a breath of relief before suddenly perking up. "Does that mean you can use magic whenever you want?" He asks excitedly.
Corvus nodded in acquiescence. "I am Corvus Charlus Potter-DeRose, son of Charlus Abraham and Dorea Winifred Potter, older cousin of Harrison James Potter."
The adults gasped as the Potter Lord ring appeared on Harry's thin finger. The Potter Lord ring, worn by Harry on his little, thin thumb, the thumb of a boy that wasn't even eleven yet.
I'm really trying not to make it seem like Corvus and Harry have this co-dependency thing going on. They don't. They just haven't seen each other in so long and their feelings are a bit overwhelming, as it had been put on pause for almost nine years.
"Harry," he calls to the still crying boy, "Harry, I don't have much more, you must remember my words, Harry. You heed them, alright? You can't let anyone else's words influence you, control you, do you understand? I have to tell you what you have to do, okay, do you understand?"
"I feel I must apologize, Heir Potter. We had sent several missives to your guardian, as we had been informed years ago how he placed mail wards upon you, so we have taken to sending them to him. He has told us you were too busy with your studies or that you were not in the wizarding world during the summers so you would not be available for correspondence or a meeting with us. Even all the letters regarding your vaults, investments, and properties went to him, to be given to you of course, but I see now that you never really received them." Corvus, as he was listening, grew stiff in his seat. Uldrick, seeing this, reassured him.
Severus, Harry would have laughed at if he wasn't so choked up at the sight of his crying godmother and honorary uncle. The man had looked so shocked and almost alarmed. He had leaned back so far on his seat, Harry, and even Lucius, had worried he would fall off. Harry was concerned his second godfather was going through a heart attack. Severus was unaware of this, too shocked that not even his occlumency shields could hide it. James Potter,
The Potter cousins' bubble was popped when Uldrick suddenly let out a string of curses in Gobbledygook. The cousins stare at the cursing goblin with slightly wide eyes—Corvus had forgotten he was there in the short amount of time he was checking Harry and Harry too had forgotten while he was being checked by an overprotective Corvus.
The excessive use of the word childish made Harry pout at his cousin, which prompted him to be whacked at the lips with a quill. It was a soft feather, so it didn't hurt, but it made him sneeze which made Corvus laugh at him, so it wasn't a very nice thing to do, in Harry's opinion.
Severus turned a raised brow at the blond beside him, angling his body slightly to converse better with his friend. "I am surprised to see you here, Lucius. I was not aware you had a relationship with either Potter before they passed, and one so significant if you are mentioned in their will," Severus states, an underlying question hidden beneath the words. Lucius nodded slowly, his eyes slightly unfocused as if in thought.
With a nod, Alrod congratulated him again, “Congratulations, Lord Gryffindor.”
Harry downed the potion, grimacing at the taste.
They were escorted to a grand set of doors and were let into an office with high ceilings, a desk, and armchairs in front of it being in the middle of the huge office, which was otherwise empty. They made their way to the goblin behind the desk. Corvus bowed and gave the same greeting he gave before, Harry bowing beside him somewhat clumsily.
"Mr Potter, are you aware you had just given us a bow that is meant for Lords?" She asked with brows raised, peering down at him. Harry fought down the urge to fidget under her gaze and nodded. Snape held back a snort.
Harry also found out that the Potters were part of these families and Harry was the Potter heir. It absolutely gobsmacked Harry that the Potter family was old enough to be considered Ancient and with a history rich enough to be considered Noble.
“Ah yes, I forgot about that,” Alrod smirked, “The Blacks are very proud of their blood, you see, so someone who isn’t a Black wouldn’t be able to become Heir or Lord.”
Harry receives a letter from an unknown source but is it truly as unknown as he thought?
Harry quickly got on the bed afterwards, Mimsy tucking him in and kissing him on the forehead before leaving him be. Harry closed his eyes to the sensation of being cared for, imagining what it would feel like if his parents were still around. He shook the thought away immediately after. Even if they weren't here, they loved him, and that was the important part of it all. He was not an unloved, unwanted, freak. He was Harrison James Potter and he was loved, wanted, and cared for, even if his parents weren't here anymore.
Vernon splutters, face going red at his nephew's words, so Harry quickly added, "I'm ten, uncle Vernon. I can be kept to the house on my own, most kids do at this age, if it's only for a short hour or two," his uncle pauses, but still hasn't lost that red tinge on his face, so Harry gives the finishing blow, "Kids stop being watched over so much at this age, it's perfectly normal, uncle Vernon."
Harry holds his younger self, equally panicked but sure, ever so sure, that it'll be okay.
Harry watched as the old house-elf faded up to the heavens in glowing lights, like fireflies floating into the sky. It made a glorious sight with the setting sun.
Madame Bones and Dowager Longbottom, as Harry now knows, take their seat in the middle, between the professors and Lord Malfoy, not exactly near to either but not as far as the others. They nod and exchange greetings with the others and they respond in kind.
He places the mail on the counter, and sets about doing the dishes. He ignores the family of three behind him and diligently does his chores.
“Then he’s innocent until proven guilty,” he declares.
Harry doubled over, clutching his stomach as he let out loud guffaws. Corvus, meanwhile, covered his mouth with both hands as he laughed, head down and back leaning on the closed door. A few moments passed just laughing, uncaring if some neighbors' curtains were opened a smidge to peer at them. Let Petunia handle it, she was used to covering up any gossip regarding Harry anyway (though she was usually the one who spread them).
"Oh? Not pretty?" The owl squawks again, "Ah, handsome then." Harry lets out a silent laugh when the owl huffs and puffs his chest out. It seems all owls loved being praised then.
"It is a Horcrux, Lord Potter. The darkest of magics there is—soul magic. It is basically a container of someone else's soul."
"Before we go further, Lord DeRose, Heir Potter," Uldrick explains, "An Inheritance Test shall be required first. One for Lord DeRose's file for the British Bank of Gringotts, and one for Heir Potter's, since he had not been able to when he was born."
“We may not need to, Harry. All names mentioned, even just in passing, will be called for the official Will Reading. One of those names is Madame Amelia Bones, the Head of The Department of Magical Law Enforcement-DMLE, for short. She will, most likely, do that for us. Madame Bones is unlike her other fellow wizards in the Ministry, in which that she is fair and just.”
“There’s nothing that can be done. There’s no point in trying, I don’t even know where he lives.”
Despite his thin frame, Draco soon becomes a dead weight over Harry’s shoulder, and it’s harder to drag him than he thought it’d be. He doesn’t want to cast a lightening charm, because Harry’s certain that with one more spell Draco will be sick.
Harry opens his eyes. A peach-coloured china teacup sits on the desk. He looks to Draco, and in his eyes there’s something like yearning.
.” She puts extra emphasis on it, so Harry knows it must be true. “I’ll get McGonagall, if you want?”
A near-silence settles over the room, the only noise the clink of tea cups and the crackling of the fire. They didn't often bring up the past, but their shared history was something that they had always been conscious of, it was impossible not to be, but this was new. Harry had never spoken of this with anyone, not truly, and if he had not seen Vernon, or any of them again, then he likely never would have. They had been a bitter memory that he had shut inside himself, locked away with countless other moments of his life, until it had been pulled to the surface. Harry longed to drown it again, but he has a feeling in the pit of his stomach that it's not going away any time soon.
“Oh.” Most of the hall has stopped their silent staring by now, but Harry can hear the buzz of a rumour passing along them, and he knows that they are all concocting their own stories as to why such an unlikely pair is sitting together.
Malfoy turns back around, eyes locked on the fire. “Hey.”
The Gryffindor stumbles back at the look on Harry’s face, and then he steps forward, stupidly brave. He pulls out his wand, and Harry hits him.
himself. He never thought he’d miss the spoiled, nasty boy who had a barely-hidden cruel streak, but this quiet, mouse-like Malfoy who looked like a mild wind would knock him over, unsettles something in him.
He just barely wakes when it’s just gone midnight when he feels movement beside him. He blearily opens his eyes, and sees darkness above, but feels wind on his cheeks.
“You can stay, if you want, but I’m not going back to bed. I’ve got this essay for Flitwick that needs to be done as soon as possible.”
Harry nods, not even feigning denial. “I wish you wouldn’t. Everyone’s staring at me and pretending they aren’t. At least Poppy’s honest about why she keeps calling me to her office.”
One of the tables slides across the floor. The Gryffindor laughs with false bravado.
(See the end of the chapter for
But I’m not going to kill myself - that upset my Mother, and I know it would upset you two. But I’m not ever getting my wand back - I know that.”
“Wanna get out of here?”
“Mother wanted me to go back for Christmas. But I can’t. All those ghosts... But then she’s all alone. She’s only in the country for me, she’d be exiled in France otherwise. If I wasn’t here then she’d be able to leave,” Malfoy goes on.
Hermione keeps talking, but her voice is just a noise in the distance. He can’t help but watch Malfoy. This is stalkerish, he knows, but there’s something going on, and he needs to know what. Him and Malfoy have always been weird about each other, it’s only logic.
“Are you alright? Has anything happened? Did you see him?” He asks, hand on his wand holster, clearly worried. Harry shakes his head.
Harry doesn't see Malfoy for the remainder of the Christmas holidays. It isn't like he thinks they're best friends now, or even friends at all, but he finds himself wanting to talk to the other boy. Perhaps it's the strangeness of talking with Malfoy without arguing that makes the prospect so oddly exciting.
Gentle was not a word Harry ever thought he’d use to describe Draco Malfoy, but his touch is soft, and runs his fingers across the scar on the back of Harry’s hand.
“No… Thank you. I have some, um, something that I need to do. Very urgent, sorry.”
Harry wonders a lot about Draco, figuring him out feels like doing a puzzle only he doesn’t know what the end picture is supposed to be and also someone’s nicked half the pieces.
(See the end of the chapter for
Then he wakes to Hermione shaking him vigorously, her hair still bushy from sleep. The copy of
Harry looks away. Draco’s stopped looking at him, and is now staring down at his parchment, idly dragging his quill across it.
“It would be terribly embarrassing.” He goes on calmly.
He tosses his wand on the desk in frustration and leans his head on his hand. It’s hopeless today - he may as well just go back to bed.
Harry tries to follow the words over Draco’s shoulder, but without his glasses the pages and text blur together in a grey mush.
is tucked under her arm.
He thrashes as Harry jumps backwards, hands up in apology, and tumbles from the chair, his shoulder slamming down hard onto the stone hearth, one of his hands touches the burning wood for a moment, and Malfoy jerks, and then seems to know exactly where he is, and where he isn’t.
Malfoy’s stumbling away before he can stop him, and Hagrid’s hand on his shoulder makes Harry let him go.
“See!” Draco exclaims, taking Harry’s silence to mean something else. “Even you can’t imagine me getting my wand back. It’s not even that I’m planning to die on my own terms, I just know that something awful is going to happen to me.”
“I won’t be for long.”
“I’m sorry,” Harry speaks to his chest, apologising for the scars that disfigure the otherwise smooth pale skin.
“No, it’s not. I think that maybe some of my teachers in primary school may have suspected, but they had this perfect middle class family in a suburban paradise image. They told other people that I was just badly behaved, that I was a problem child. I was for them.”
Harry stares between both boys, and then back to Draco, who’s straining against his bonds without making a sound, and Harry says
Draco hesitantly reaches into the darkness of the cupboard and pats Harry’s arm.
One of Draco’s pointy toes nudges Harry’s bare leg. Harry knew the meaning behind it; when Draco was remembering something awful he couldn’t stand to be touched. Harry tugs the hem of Draco’s pyjama bottoms until Draco moves his foot onto Harry’s pillow. He squeezes Draco’s ankle.
“He’s awake, slightly delirious, but you can see him now. Do you want someone to stay with you?”
Draco nods slowly. “I don’t think we should do it again, though.” He turns back to his parchment as disappointment races through Harry’s veins.
As he nears the source of the noise, Harry can make out a small figure behind a tree, either kneeling or crouching. He slowly tip-toes forwards, and clear as day can make out the sound of a familiar sob.
“No, it’s just… I thought you’d know.” Hermione fingers the dust-jacket of the book. Harry glances at it,
Draco shrugs and sits up, keeping his eyes on the dark water. “I don’t know. Any life under the water, I suppose. I never saw the Giant Squid, but in the old common room we would sometimes see Merfolk. But since the war… they’ve gone.”
(A very lewd image of Draco shirtless, his pink lips pouting, and his long fingers beckoning Harry over, suddenly thrusts itself to the forefront of his mind, and in the dark Harry flushes and shoves the image back behind a locked door in his head)
Harry closes his eyes. Someone pulls up something soft and warm over his chest, and the sensation is what he imagines a child would feel being tucked into bed.
Harry didn’t know what Hermione would do if she knew about him and Draco. Sure, Harry was certain she knew that they talked without hurling insults now and maybe she thought they had a tentative friendship, but he was certain she didn’t know about their night-time ritual, or how many times they met in the dark. Even if she found out about that, Harry didn’t want to think about her reaction to Harry and Draco
Harry impulsively makes a decision then, and turns away from the familiarity of the Gryffindor table and strides over to the Slytherins, not pausing to take a breath until he’s flopped onto the bench opposite Draco. Draco jumps at the thump of him hitting the bench, and then his eyes widen in surprise when he sees that it’s Harry. He glances around at the rest of the school, who haven’t noticed yet.
Someone, a Fifth Year Ravenclaw, Harry thinks, started calling him Mental Malfoy, and though as far as Harry knows they didn’t say it to his face, when Harry had heard it he had turned around so quickly that one of the girls she was gossiping with gasped and dropped her textbooks.
Eventually, Draco sniffs, and swallows. He picks up a handkerchief from the bedside cabinet, and dabs at his eyes.
Draco looks awful, but no more awful than usual. He’s alone in his own corner, empty chairs surrounding him, hunched over his parchment, his white fringe falling in a curtain to hide his face. It’s a mirror image to how he is whenever Harry sees him in the Great Hall.
He gently pulls up the duvet to Draco’s alabaster shoulders, and silently slips from the room.
“You’re my friend,” He reiterates, and is relieved when Draco doesn’t push him away like that terrible day in St Mungo’s.
The cupboard under the stairs in Grimmauld Place is different to the cupboard under the stairs in Privet Drive.
Draco fiddles with his blankets some more, and it’s Harry’s turn to get the hint. “If you don’t want me to stay, I can go? You don’t have to invite me in out of politeness.”
“Fuck.” He hauls Draco up, and for once is grateful for Draco’s bird-like appetite, because he hardly weighs a thing.
Unfortunately, whoever was spreading the rumours seemed to always know when Harry was around, and he never got to hear the rumours in full. He only ever manages to hear small snippets, like tiny pieces of a puzzle that were slowly connecting to make an unpleasant picture in his head.
“Wanna go on a date with me?” Draco blurted out. It is more one word than a sentence.
As Draco sat with his mother at her favourite tailor, Lucius Malfoy had managed to talk himself out of it. He really needed to get rid of these things that didn't exist. Poor Draco. No matter how much he loved her, shopping clothes with Narcissa Malfoy was something he wouldn't wish upon his worst enemy... but on his son. Was he a bad father because of that? No, he shook his head, that was called parenting. There needed to be consequences for him after he needed to be called three times until he showed up. Anyway afterwards he would do something Draco wanted to do. Buying him a new book about potions or quidditch. Not even three hours later, the young Malfoy spawn and his mother left the tailor with all the clothes Narcissa firmly believed her son needed.
The weasel seemed to be mentally overwhelmed and his brain had stopped working. Ginny stared at him, shocked to the bones. Hermione giggled happily to herself. “Ehm...” was the highly intellectual answer Harry gave, which also was the starting point for Mr. and Mrs. Malfoy.
“Whatever, next year's going to be the last one and I can't possibly worsen our relationship, can I?” The Slytherin thought with such bravery that everyone around would have agreed to send him to St. Mungos if he said out loud. Luckily, he didn't. Instead he took a step forward, focused the green eyes with his own just to look down on the ground again the next moment. “Malfoy?!” The weasel. Not important. Breathe in. Breathe out. Breathe in again.
“No, Draco darling, that was unacceptable.” His mother tried for a steady voice. “That is no way to ask for a date!” “Eh... what?” Draco was not quite able to follow the conversation. Neither was anyone around him. “Son! You don't even have flowers! That is embarrassing to say the least!” After a short swish with the wand, Draco held a bunch of red roses in his hand. Nearly as red as his face. “I am going to show you and then you are going to try, yes?” Lucius turned to the poor boy-who-lived and looked him lovingly in the eyes. “Harry James Potter, It would fill me with the greatest of joy if you would give me the honor to take you out.” He was pushed aside by his wife. “You do not have to be so stilted up. Most of the time it is enough if you say something along the lines of: Harry, would you like to have a date with me? I know a nice coffee shop and I would like to spend some time with you.” Lucius nodded to his son to try it out himself.
she?) she makes no face of shock or awe, and Harry is so, so grateful.
The Slytherin, along with the Ravenclaw that wasn’t now groaning at Harry’s feet, is nowhere to be seen. Clever lads.
“Get out, get out, shut up shut up! Leave me alone!” Draco cries, loud enough for the Healer with the freckles to burst into the room and grasp Harry’s shoulder.
at him, wide-eyed and frozen in place.
It's exactly a fortnight after classes resumed that Harry speaks to Malfoy again.
Draco looks at Harry oddly. “What were you doing?”
“No! I want you to stay. It’s just… You don’t have to sit over there. You’re tired, we can swap if you want. I was reading, I won’t sleep tonight.”
Malfoy continues staring. “You’re not going to let me say no, are you?”
Malfoy stares at him for a moment more, and then hesitantly holds up the book.
“Nothing - we just wanted to mess with him, that’s all. We cast some stinging hexes at him, that stuff, and then we gave him some dreamless sleep, just so he’d pass out for a bit and would freak out when he woke up. We didn’t do enough to bloody kill him!”
“What are you getting? You liked that mint one last time.”
“I’m not sticking my nose into anything! I was just asking, maybe I was
“Mm. I didn’t think I’d sleep at all.”
Startled, he sits up, and for once the dizziness that accompanies him upon waking isn’t present, and he goes to grab his glasses from his bedside cabinet and his hand bumps against something soft and warm.
It’s a blatant attempt to change the subject as Harry’s ever heard, but he’s suddenly not in the mood to press. Hermione wouldn’t be likely to tell him, and if he badgered her about it she’d only feel guilty about it. Even so, it makes him feel left out, that Hermione’s keeping Malfoy’s secrets.
“I’m going to die.”
“Your father?” Harry prompts.
“I kept your teacup.” Draco says, and it catches Harry so off guard that he just stares at him.
Draco’s plate looks untouched, as if he had only put food on it for show, or like it was plastic food that rich people kept (One of Aunt Petunia's friends had kept plastic food out for show, and Harry still doesn't understand why). Harry wonders, not for the first time, how much Draco actually eats.
out of the corner of his eye.
He shoves his feet into his ratty trainers, yanks one of Mrs Weasley’s jumpers over his head and grabs his wand, and then he’s running, fast as a racehorse.
“I don’t sleep much either,” He confesses. Malfoy sighs, and it sounds suspiciously like a hidden sob. Harry politely looks the other way.
“Because even though you watched him die, you still think that he might be there when you wake up.” Harry finishes for him.
Draco shuts his eyes, and lets his head fall back against the railing. With each exhale a small puff of air slips from his pink lips, no longer tinged with blue like that day in the forest, and Harry watches as it dissolves into the black sky.
Draco shakes his head and holds out a hand as if to stop Harry leaving even though he hasn’t moved. He drops his hand after a moment.
He swipes his arm under the bed in an arc, and the inside of his elbow touches a familiar shape.
Draco comes to a sudden stop in the frozen aisle, his trolley neatly parked next to him. He has his hands on his hips and is staring determinedly down at the tubs of ice cream inside the freezer. What exactly he was determined to do, Harry isn't sure, but he knew that face when he saw it. Harry joins him, and slips his hand into his.
He’s bonier than Harry imagined he would be, likely even worse than he was when they were on the run, but it’s not Draco’s sharp collarbones or his ribs that Harry could count that he stares at, it’s the once-deep, criss-crossing red scars that were laid across Draco’s chest as if put there by a serrated blade.
“What’s dying like?”
He sits up, and realises there’s a blanket tucked around him that wasn’t there last night.
Draco’s eyes are unfocused again, staring past Harry, and he gasps and rolls over, his thin back facing Harry.
Given that so few Eighth Years came back, it was decided that they would be allowed to have their own rooms if they wanted. He knew some students had refused, the Patil twins had insisted on sharing, but the majority of them were enjoying the newfound freedom.
“Sorry,” He gasps breathlessly, his heart beginning to recede now that he wasn't alone. “Did I wake you?”
Something had cracked that Christmas Eve when Harry followed him into the Forest and Draco asked about dying, and something new and precious had begun to form from the ashes of what they had been, like a Phoenix. Yeah, Harry thought, that was another good metaphor, Hermione would be so proud.
“It’s four in the morning,” He says, voice low with sleep.
Harry cracks his fist against it once, twice, thrice, and hopes that Draco isn’t already asleep.
Hermione’s voice sounds more hoarse than usual, and Harry puts it down to giving someone a very long and passionate lecture.
Harry will admit, maybe only to Hermione, that he does have a knack for stalking Malfoy. Perhaps that’s unfair to say, because the map gives him an unfair advantage. He spends nights watching
Even after the war, after he killed the Dark Lord and saved them all, they still wouldn’t tell him what he needed to know. If he had known, he could have -
Harry wakes, cocooned in a nest of warm blankets, and blinks at the darkness that surrounds him. He looks to the wall, certain that he should at least see a slither of pale moonlight, or the gentle flutter of curtains, but he can see even without his glasses that the wall is smooth.
Harry watches him stare listlessly down at his plate as he pushes his food around, and wants to go to him. It’s stupid, they aren’t friends, but Malfoy looks lonely, and Harry knows better than anyone what it’s like to have the world against you.
behind Malfoy asking about dying makes Harry feel ill.
Malfoy huffs a laugh. “Confusing. It’s a children’s book, but the characters aren't normal muggles. I don’t really think it’s helping me understand muggles. It’s not awful, though. It’s… I like it.”
Draco had looked half-dead that day in the forest.
“Harry, I know you ain’t a child anymore, but just… Be careful around Malfoy.”
He’s not wearing a cloak, Harry notices. He’s dressed, but only in a thin pair of robes, with no cloak or coat, or gloves or that ridiculous winter hat he’d had in third year. As if he had dressed in a hurry and paid no mind to his clothes.
Harry learns quickly that Draco’s a fast reader, and he seems fixated on making his way through a muggle library.
Draco curls up smaller, and pulls out a clump of hair from the back of his head. If Harry squints he’s certain there’s a small bald patch. Seeing the small patch of skin makes his chest ache.
Draco makes a small noise, and his face twitches, but then his expression relaxes and Harry knows that he’s gone back to sleep.
“My mother told me...”
is dead.”
“Don’t stop.” A quiet voice whispers into his ear. He turns his head slightly to see Draco’s gaze flickering between his face, his wand and the china doll. “I want to see.”
“There’s a barrier now. If I jumped I’d get caught in it.” Draco says.
When Harry walks into Transfiguration that morning, he immediately notices that Hermione isn’t in her normal seat at the front. A cursory glance around the class tells him that she's not there at all.
(which he had quietly laughed at when he thought Harry was asleep),
“Hey,” Harry says.
He’s certain he remembers reading that it worked by slowing the drinker’s heartbeat and dulling the mind. It had to be carefully administered, because taking too much would slow the heart until it stopped pumping blood.
“They
“It’s stupid. I went down to the common room, and you weren’t there, and so I was going to go back, but it was dark and I kept thinking I was seeing things out of the corners of my eyes and so I hoped you’d be awake to tell me I’m not going mad.” Harry looks at him pleadingly, and after an uncomfortable few seconds Draco gets the hint.
Harry laughs without humour. “It was years ago, and there’s no evidence. Who’d you think would be believed in court, a middle class pensioner that took in his orphaned nephew by marriage, or said nephew who he said was a delinquent and, according to him, was sent to a reform school for problem boys and then just vanished when he was seventeen? There’s no point. It would be dragging it out for nothing.”
“Dudley?” Draco fills in. Harry had told him just a little about him. He was the safest one.
” Harry reads aloud.
Draco slides the match box closed and places it on the bedside cabinet. He turns away from Harry and takes the candle over to the bathroom. Harry thinks Draco must not have heard him.
Pomfrey swears under her breath, and Harry raises his eyebrows, having never heard her speak that like, having never even pictured her speaking like that.
Harry shakes his head, and she holds the door open and then closes it behind him with a soft snick.
He puts it back and picks up another and another, and sure enough Draco is hoarding empty Dreamless Sleep bottles under his bed.
"You—you used magic—you're not—" Harry stutters. Corvus' eyes light up in understanding.
Corvus, though, remains unimpressed. "Then you should have closed and locked the door," he deadpans.
And when he felt his uncle Moony's arm go around his shoulder and squeeze him oh-so-gently to his side, Herry pretended that his eyes were not wet as his chest filled with warmth from the people that were so angry for his behalf. And Remus pretended he did not feel when Harry pressed his face to his side, hiding his teary eyes, or the way his fist clutched at his robes.
He got in line and discreetly watched the people around him. Some were in fancy, silken robes, and stood impeccably well, back straight and signet rings on fingers. Some were more laid back, some wore robes while others didn't, and talking loudly with each other, though a few of the fancy-looking ones gave them subtle stink eyes.
magic. It showed, not the forest view from outside, but a glorious beach ocean view, the water a wonderful cerulean blue upon white sand.
Alrod guides him towards the vault and, once the vault doors were open, Harry’s weak legs went weaker at the sight. Mountains of coins, gold, silver, and bronze; shelves of books, letters, chests, and jewellery; paintings of what Harry assumed were to be ancestors; various artefacts were placed here and there on top of, what seemed to Harry, priceless antique furniture. Harry saw that there were even statues of varying sizes!
Harry opens the little cardboard box with shaking hands, heart pounding in his chest. Inside the box was a smaller, plain ornate box, a few pictures, baby clothes and notebooks.
Alrod gives him a look, "Quietly, if you will, Chief Warlock." Dumbledore only smiles at him benignly, taking a seat right at the very front. Alrod holds back a sigh. This was why the goblins didn't like him. He talks too much, does and says unnecessary things, and never tries harder for the betterment of the people he says he cares for. Albus Dumbledore liked to play god in old, mortal flesh. It was tiring as it was annoying. He was a good man with a power he does not use. Basically, a waste of time. And every goblin worth his knut knew that a waste of time was a waste of gold.
! But it dies on her lips. Right in front of her, lying down on a ratty cot, with messy hair and thin framed circular glasses, is her nephew, awake and staring at her, with eerie, blazing green eyes. Harry stares at her, a calm sort of fury within, shown only with his eyes. He rises and moves to get out, his aunt numbly shuffling backwards. He moves to the kitchen, grabbing his to-do list from his aunt's numb fingers, and sets out to do them.
Harry blinked. “Oh. And the money comes from tuitions, right?”
"We apologize for this, Uldrick," Corvus voiced calmly, patting the back of his hand to Harry's knee comfortingly for a moment, "But there is an explanation for this." Corvus nodded at Harry, letting his cousin explain his situation.
"Extension charm. Makes small spaces bigger inside than it is outside." Harry nods at his answer, realizing it must be what was on his trunk, as it fit in more than it looked it could.
"As well as, I have just recently found out I am an heir to a Noble and Ancient House," Uldrick froze in his seat, so Harry gave one last push, "Just today, in fact."
Harry informs Alrod of this, “So it’s not that it’s evil. It’s just a branch of magic that can be used, and whether it’s hurtful or not depends on the one casting it.”
"I also wish to speak to the Potter Account manager," Corvus stated before the goblin could call out to another goblin. The teller gave him a sharp glance at that, and his sharp stare went to Harry, his gaze flicking to his forehead before flicking back to Corvus.
“Alrod, why is Sirius in prison?” He asks.
Alrod raises a brow but does not comment, instead, choosing a few papers from the stack Harry was reviewing before.
Harry was enchanted.
“Wait, does this mean there are different account managers for each of my family vaults?” Harry asks, incredulously. And wasn’t that a weird thing? Just a while ago, Harry had believed he had nothing to his name and now he’s the Lord of several Houses and the Heir to one. He had multiple vaults filled with millions of gold coins and priceless artefacts—each!
“About my parents’ will…” Harry began saying.
richer families he was now Lord over. Harry did the smart thing to do in situations where one was overwhelmed.
ruined!" He shouts from the other side before locking all 13 locks on the door.
He came across Charing Cross Road and watched in fascination as a building came to light, the buildings beside it moving to make space. He noticed amazed as the others didn't even realize its existence, passing by as if it wasn't there
Harry had the impression of locals and foreigners. It reminded him slightly of uncle Vernon muttering under his breath when he'd see a person of colour, although it kind of seemed backwards in the Wizarding world in a way he couldn't explain yet.
Harry’s stomach settles, then. He was nervous about meeting them, as they were close to 200, but now that he knows he didn’t need to meet with him for now settled his nerves.
There are better times to think of these. Harry shakes his head to dispel the dark thoughts, forcibly pushing them away to deal with later.
Harry stared his cousin in the eyes and said, "Let's head to Gringotts, then."
"I haven't an idea why I could be mentioned, if not only to be called out by Potter—which seems likely, from all the tales you've told me about him." Harry wondered what that meant but again, his musings were interrupted when another man enters the room.
Amidst the large manors, mansions and castle, Harry also had to categorize which one needed more attention than the others, which ones he could imagine living in, and the things he might need should move in.
They discuss the will in particular to Dumbledore and how it was him that had the will sealed so he may have it closed again. It was a debate on whether Dumbledore knew what was written about him or not. So they made a contingency on how to get around Dumbledore possibly sealing it again.
He tells younger him of magic, and of wizards and witches, and of half-giants and
Alrod ignored the brightly coloured wizard as went back behind his desk, retrieving the wills and the globe that would read them. He placed them on the desk before turning to address the guests.
Upon further inspection, Harry notices that the pictures were moving, they were, Harry was sure, of his parents or them with little him, along with some other people. Some of the notebooks—journals—belonged to his mother or father. The baby clothes were his, of course, it also had an old and small, light blue blanket under it. Harry had the fleeting thought that maybe he came to the Dursleys wrapped in this blanket.
They walk for a while before they reach huge double doors. The inside was a large room, with two couches in the very middle, facing each other with a coffee table in the middle. Alrod takes a seat on one couch and gestures for Harry to do the same on the other.
Seeing his health scan, Harry realized just how bad his life a the Dursleys were. They've never struck him but they'd never been gentle with him either. They also never scolded or stopped Dudley when he pushed, kicked, or punched him; in fact, they practically encouraged it. Harry was surprised at the illnesses he had gotten, never knowing it was actually more serious than he had thought.
To Harry, he believed everyone deserved a chance at fairness, even if they were killers or traitors; they deserve some semblance of fairness, even if it was only a trial.
A head with a nest of unkempt raven locks rises, revealing wide and bright green eyes, innocent eyes. Harry Potter, ten turning eleven, stares back at a man with the same shade of green eyes and the same mess of raven black hair. His head cocks to the side and Harry, 20, does the same, unconsciously.
“Harry. Call me Harry. Please.” Gaze still strong, the wizard cuts him off, asking him to call him by his name. Nodding, Alrod continues.
Harry sniffled quietly, rubbing his face on his cousin's shirt, effectively wiping away any errand tears and then let himself be gently pushed back by his cousin.
At the sound, Harry and Corvus glanced at each other, realization dawning on them. A slow grin appeared on Harry's face, Corvus smirking at the sight.
Harry nodded his understanding. "But that's not what happened," he voiced, calmly, if not slightly dejectedly. Uldrick nodded solemnly.
"It takes a while to get used to but you'll manage it in no time!" Corvus said cheerily. Harry groaned and opened his eyes to glare at his cousin.
When Harry first arrived here on the Dursleys' doorstep, Corvus was right next to him in a larger, separate basket. Harry didn't remember his parents, Corvus didn't remember his or much of his aunt and uncle, but they knew each other. When they had no one; Petunia was cold, and mean, her husband cruel, and all the others in Privet Drive believed their lies; they had each other. When everyone in Privet Drive either hated them or didn't care for them, they loved and cared for each other. Corvus protected Harry from Dudley's gang and he protected him from Vernon's wrath. Harry took care of Corvus when he had wounds or bruises given by his own bullies in school, bullies who were bigger and meaner than he.
Harry paled a deathly white as he listened to his cousin, dread pooling in his stomach, bile gathering at his throat. Harry's breath came in quick, harsh pants as the ramifications all but slammed into him.
“The Ancient and Most Noble House of Malfoy has the characteristics of white-blond hair and a certain proficiency in Law and Wards. The Most Ancient and Noble House of Prince have the proficiency of Potion Making and the Mind Arts. The Ancient House of McGonagall has proficiency in Transfiguration. The Most Ancient and Noble House of Black has the proficiency in Human Transfiguration which then evolved to them having Metamorpmagi. The Ancient and Noble House of Potter has the characteristics of having hair that practically has minds of their own and proficiency in Potion Making and/or Defensive Magic.”
Corvus wasn't all that impressed with the entrance being through a pub, thought Harry assured him that Tom the Barkeep would never let kids near the alcohol and kept a vigil watch on the drinking customers when children were present or staying at the inn. That opened a whole lot of questions that Harry would deign answers to once they found a place.
“Yes, that would be the Black Family Magic acting up within you. Since it is less than half, you will not be able to easily control it—
Harry smiles at the goblin, relieved.
Nodding, Harry asked, “You said magical guardian—in my inheritance test, it stated that Dumbledore was an unsanctioned guardian. What does that mean?”
Alrod inclined his head, forcing his expression to be one of mussing and neutrality, instead of reflecting the anger he felt stewing inside. He does not alert the young Potter Lord as the goblin is sure Harry was not aware of what he said. He took a quiet and deep breath before forcing himself back into the discussion.
Little Harry feels it then, the wind that's been building and building since they began talking.
As I was writing this, I noticed something very funny. Sirius' initials literally spell S.O.B.
"Fine! But I expect you to leave as soon as they're here and don't you dare come back, boy. One freak is more than enough, we don't want another one," he spits out viciously. Corvus just snorts and nods in acquiescence.
The child had messy raven locks, aristocratic cheekbones, gold geometric-framed glasses that made emerald green eyes gleam in the light, and a short hooded cape over a simple long-sleeved dress-shirt. The child was small and thin, looking to be 8 or 9 years old. Remus greedily sucked in the image of his cub who he hadn't seen in almost ten years.
Bowing, he tried to imitate the greeting, "Um, and may yours as well?" Harry tried not to grimace at his blotched excuse for a greeting.
Harry nods at this, glad he asked, though he also didn't really believe he had much of any of those. He picked up the knife and swiftly nicked his finger, letting three drops of blood fall on the parchment.
“The Most Ancient and Most Noble House of Peverell, the oldest house of them all, from which the Potters have the most history with—since the 13
"What?" He voiced out, confused. The potion master turned his sneer to him, though he lost the fierce glare in his eyes.
"But it doesn't matter," older him says then. He gazes at little Harry with sad, tired eyes.
Harry takes the letter and paper with shaking hands, absentmindedly closing the door with his hip. He moves over to the kitchen table and only stares at the letter for a moment.
Harry jumped, "But that's not—"
’ it said. What does that mean?”
“How do we open it?” Harry then asks.
It was the sight of Corvus, so calm and yet so angry at the same time, that gave him back the breath that had felt so out of reach, and further calmed him. Harry would get through this, he always did, and this time, Corvus would by his side. Come Sunday this time, Ron and Hermione would be by his side as well, and the twins, Mr and Mrs Weasley, and even Percy too, in his own Percy-like way. This was not the first time life had thrown something at him and life would hardly stop after this. After all, what is life if not waves upon the sands of your existence?
"I am Alrod, the Potter account manager," the goblin sneered at him, "Who are you and what is your business with me?"
spilled a little bit of gravy sauce on his trousers. It was a
"Did you know about this?" The little Lord asked, childish voice gone cold and quiet in his fury. Alrod’s eyes widened at the sight, eyebrows furrowing in agitated confusion.
After a moment, the words stopped and Alrod grabbed the parchment, reading the contents before nodding, satisfied.
For what seemed like the second time in his life, he did not wake up to his aunt's screeching or his cousin's deliberate stomping on the top of the stairs. Instead, he woke up to the gentle rays of sunlight on a warm, soft, clean bed, and a thick blanket that swallowed his skinny form completely. Downstairs, he could hear the sizzling of cooking oil and the soft clanking of pots and pans. After drinking one of his prescribed potions, Harry padded down to see Mimsy cooking.
I wrote this chapter and the next on paper first and I didn't notice until I retyped it all in AO3 that I wrote it down as Chapter 5 and 6...
"You're stalling, Uldrick," Corvus announced softly after a moment of silence. Uldrick did not disagree. Corvus raised a brow, "Who is Harry's magical guardian?" Uldrick was quiet for a few seconds until Corvus started narrowing his eyes, lips pursing. Uldrick glanced at Harry briefly before he sighed.
Alrod, once seeing that Harry was calm enough to proceed, replaced Lily Potter’s will with James Potter’s. A similar flash of light and a mist forming into the shape of James Potter appeared.
"May your gold always flow, Master Goblin," Corvus greeted, giving a short bow with a fist over his heart. The goblin gave the same short bow and replied in kind, "And your coffers never empty."
Minerva had cried. It was such a James thing to say, she couldn't laugh because even though it was his voice and memory, it was not him. She was a godmother and she had failed them both, Lily, James, and little Harry. She refused to be ashamed because she didn't know but she still felt her heart break for what could have been. She wiped her tears with a handkerchief that she brought, accepting the pats Pomona had given her, the Hufflepuff Head also with tears in her eyes. Minerva wouldn't even begin to describe her feelings for poor Sirius.
"We're heading out for lunch," Corvus announced, wrapping an arm around Harry's shoulders which were starting to shake, "No need to wait up. We'll let ourselves in later when we return."
That didn't even count the special events like art contests, poem or story writing, and even rock climbing and obstacle course racing. Those were school events where any student was free to join, regardless of club or association.
Harry sent a small prayer of thanks to whoever was out there that Harry had Corvus and that after all this time, he was back and that he'd get to keep him this time.
"Now," he drawled, "Have you ever heard of apparition?"
Harry jolted upright, a thin blanket falling and pooling on his lap. He raised his hands and stared at it as if he could see the spells on him gone if he stared hard enough. Harry checked himself and realized he felt lighter than he ever has. His shoulders and wrists moving more fluidly than it has before; his mind was clear-headed and he felt fresh like spring. Harry knew then, for certain, that he was free of the binding on his core. He hadn’t even realized how heavy his body felt until now.
Gnarlwolf set off to the left to give Severus, Malfoy, and Dowager Longbottom their parts. Gruffraff went to the right to give similar bags that held their tokens to Remus and Minerva. Once done, they went back to the corner where they were stationed. Alrod nodded at them and then turned back to the beneficiaries.
Harry sighed in relief, following Tom as he led the way to the entrance to Diagon Alley. They came to stand in front of a tall wall and Harry watched the sequence he tapped on the wall intently. Harry really thanked whatever god granted him for easy memorization skills. His jaw dropped as the wall disappeared like a waterfall within his very eyes, showing a crowded street of people.
Again, Alrod congratulated, “Congratulations, Lord Slytherin.”
How many times has Harry longed and been denied something as simple as a chance? To be called a delinquent and a troublemaker, a liar and ungrateful brat, never given a chance to even prove otherwise, people believing what they hear at face value.
"You have to understand, Harry," Corvus began, "What your magical guardian did, it's not just negligence, it was illegal. They practically abandoned you, with no knowledge of who you are in our world, all the while holding some sort of power over you, and, to some point,  your accounts and estates. They also receive a bi-monthly stipend for your care, your needs and wants," he finished with a small frown, reaching out to grab Harry's hand. Harry squeezed back, frowning hard at the table in front of him. The implications were obvious and Corvus didn't need to point it out needlessly. Harry received nothing from that stipend, he received no care, not a penny was spent on or for Harry, not from the Dursleys or his magical guardian.
Step two. For a successful change of one's life, one must get the balls rolling—in other words, shake things up!
Harry hid a wince and tried not to fidget. He quickly thought of a lie and carefully avoided the man's eyes—Older him warned him about eye contact.
Aight, so I have no idea where I'm going with this. Fair warning, updates will be sporadic because this was more of a prompt that got way out of hand, though I already do have plans for chapter two, so...
Harry snorts quietly to himself.
Harry woke up like he had been every day for the past 5-6 years, bright and early.
"No," Harry whispers and he is small and young but still so very alive, with hope and fire and a stubbornness that hasn't been defeated yet, and his older counterpart nods, satisfied, a little bit of light entering his eyes.
Chapter Three is up! The second step to change is to identify what needs to be fixed.
Remus had laughed, a choked sound escaping through his tears. The tears had formed after Lily's will was done and had fallen sometime after James' had started. It felt as if his heart was breaking again, only this time it was slowly being mended at the same time. He couldn't believe James but at the same time, it was such a James thing to do. But mostly he couldn't believe himself. He knew his and Sirius' relationship hadn't been the same since that incident in their sixth year but that it would have let them doubt each other so much like this... Remus wondered if this guilt would ever disappear. He knew he'd not mind if it never did.
Remus truthfully didn't need to be told, he had not gotten up from his seat even after the dismissal and was back to staring at the left corner of the office. Severus raised a brow and held back a sneer. Who knew what went on in flea-infested brains. Instead, he ignored the werewolf and went back to his seat.
Harry thinks this through but then hesitantly asks Alrod, “Would it not be possible for you to take them, Alrod?” Which makes Alrod pause and blink in mild surprise, though he feels as though he shouldn’t be with Harry Potter. Instead, he nods his head, gratefully.
Decided, Mimsy pointed her wooden spatula at the area where the bathroom was. In a gentle but firm voice (Mimsy decided that the young master did not need her 'you listen now or so help me' voice, unlike her previous boys), she told the young lord, "Master be taking a bath. He be relaxing while he waits. Mimsy will be finished by then."
Harry winced. Surely, he didn't have to show it as some sort of verification, did he? Though, he supposed that was easier than showing papers he did not have as proof.
The goblin from before came forward, a small glass vial in his hand. Harry took it and squeezed his finger, letting the vial fill with his blood. The goblin nodded at half full, and Harry took his bleeding finger in his mouth, the wound pulsing at being milked. The unknown goblin flashed his sharp teeth in a smirk before waving his gnarled hand over Harry's and stepping away. Harry popped his finger out, shocked to see the wound gone.
“‘lo Hermione,” Ron said, looking away from the possible train wreck in front of him.
“Malfoy?” She said, testing the waters.
“Why do you want to know?” Hermione scrunched her face up.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
“Are you gay?” Harry asked tentatively. Lyra’s silence gave Harry the answer to that question.
“Do I look like an Ursula?” Draco asked.
A toe headed girl sat next to a curly haired girl with two curved horns sticking out the front of her head. Neither of them spoke, the horned one was busy scratching on a scroll with a quill. While the blonde sat glaring at the other, cross armed.
Finally, Draco stood at the entrance to her common room. She muttered the password and walked in. As she had suspected no one was in the common room, she made her way back to her dorm. She quickly changed into her pyjamas and slipped into her bed.
The boy gryffindor met with another red headed gryffindor boy on their way to transfiguration, another class they had with the slytherins. They walked into the airy classroom. The dark haired one had his eyes peeled for a particular blonde haired slytherin.
Harry watched as Draco Malfoy walked away. He was stunned. Draco Malfoy was gay? Was there a possibility of him being gay for? No, Harry couldn’t think like that. Not when, well everything had happened so soon, how much pain had been so recent.
For that afternoon, they forgot about everything else. They ended up in two beautiful gowns(the blonde in a sleek black gown that hugged her hips, with a halter top, and backless and the brunette in pale blue dress with multiple petticoats, a structured bodice and droopy sleeves), doing their homework until dinner. The magic wore off and they went seperate ways, agreeing to meet again the next day. Draco although hated her current body, she was happy with the prospect of the next day.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
“I don’t know,” Hermione answered.
Draco crawled back over to her bed. Climbing onto it, she pressed her face, that was wrong, into a pillow and cried.
"We didn't have any astronomy homework, did we?" Hermione asked, looking at the large astronomy book on the table.
Hermione stood up, aggressively and loudly causing a wave shushes from the surrounding students. Harry was baffled, “What do mean he’s not he? Why would you need to talk to Luna?”
Draco had been on the look out for Hermione, she had questions she needed to be answered. Draco had walked to her normal table, put down her things and went to look for a particular book she needed for her Charms class. She had walked only a row from where she normally sat when she saw Hermione, who was conveniently sitting near the book she needed. In that moment, she decided she needed answers.
Harry scoffed and started working on assimilating the Bicorn Horn dust into the pot of bubbling troll snot and water. Draco then transferred the cut mandrake root into the mortar and pestle and gently began to grind it in a counter-clockwise direction. Harry looks up at the blonde. Even with the bags under her eyes and her messy composure, hair not brushed and sticking up every which way, clothes wrinkled and in disarray. Despite all that the blonde was beautiful in Harry’s eyes.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
One Sunday morning as Hermione ate by herself. She had woken up earlier than her friends to study for a few hours before her friends wanted to do something. She was reading a book while eating a bowl of oatmeal when a blonde girl sat in front of her.
The next morning, Draco woke up to Professor Snape entering her dorm. Professor Snape was the head of Slytherin and was in control of the punishment of the Slytherin students. Snape came into the dormitory with the intent to punish Draco for missing class but mainly to find out what was going on with him.
Her friends noticed but ignored it. Figuring that she was just upset because of her illness the previous day. They knew the Malfoys had huge expectations for their son. They knew Draco had a hard time coping. Missing a day must have not been good and would surely warrant a howler. They left her be. They had no true idea what was going on in her head or how much of a disappointment she would be to her parents if her secret got out.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Harry scolded himself for thinking that. He wasn’t gay right? I mean there was that fling with Diggory but that didn’t mean he was gay?
“At least I have the reassurance that Ginny wasn’t cheating on me,” Harry smiled, looking at a cloud shaped like a flower.
She stared at herself in the mirror for what must have been hours but it had only felt like a few minutes. A time too short lived, soon her entire body begin to tingle as though waves electricity raced through her. It wasn’t painful necessarily just numbing. She looked at herself in the mirror as her features became sharper, her hair became shorter and her body grew back to fit the uniform.
Lyra slowly approached and held out her hand, “I’m Lyra Malfoy, formerly known as Draco Malfoy.”
Hermione noted how comfortable he looked as a girl, she was sure if it were Ron or Harry they’d exude uncomfort. After much internal debate, Hermione finally decided what to do.
She lay there staring at the ceiling. Soon enough at around half seven, Goyle came into the dorm. She pretended to be asleep, the smell of a beef pasty filling the room.
“Eta?”
Lyra remembered that the next day was Halloween, she had been so distracted with everything going she had forgotten. She was excited for the festivities. During her afternoons with Hermione, she had learned of the muggle traditions. They had even decided to have a costume party of their own the afternoon before the feast. Lyra was looking forward to it.
Draco was pretty infamous at Hogwarts. A slytherin prefect with a reputation of being cruel and merciless. Second in his class, he was cunning and ambitious. His pureblood status made him like a god among his fellow slytherins. He was the picture perfect example of a slytherin. At least that is what the world saw.
Harry decided to not spend the rest of the day laying around, ran up to his dorm to get his quidditch gear and made his way to the quidditch pitch.
A few hours later, Lyra found herself pacing the length of the room. A concerned Hermione watched from the couch that was in front of a large window with a sea view. She soothingly said, “Lyles, please calm down.”
Giggling she went over to the armoire. All thoughts of the war and their issues went away as they lost themselves in satin, silk and cotton in the wardrobe. They’d take turns putting together an outfit and modeling it for the other. It was simple but fun. Even though neither of them were that feminine, it was mindless fun to lose themselves in feminine wiles.
Lyra looked at him, “Believe it or not I do care. You’re not fun to bully when you're depressed.”
Ron responded, “Yes! It may not mean anything though or you could have misinterpreted what was going on.”
Harry laid by the fireplace in the Gryffindor Common Room. He knew he had homework to do but there was a fat chance of him doing it on the same day it was assigned. His mind wandered, as mind’s so often do without entertainment.
Draco shook free of his grip, “I know that. Cutting it into smaller pieces will make it easier to grind it.”
The girl with horns next to him was Hermione Granger. A gryffindor prefect who had saved the school countless times with her two best friends. She was the top of their class and was clever and brave. A brilliant witch, who was definitely going places. She was a muggleborn or as Draco and fellow slytherins would say “a mudblood”.
After Draco had finished eating, she excused herself, “I have some homework I have to finish in the library. I’ll see in transfiguration.”
“It’s almost like you have a crush on him or something,” Ron said, directed more towards Hermione than anything, “Seriously, how obsessed can you be with someone who has done nothing but torment us?”
Draco nodded, smiling. Though the pit in her stomach told her that she had just made either an amazing decision or a disastrous mistake. She really hoped it wasn’t the latter. Hermione began rattling on excitedly and told her to meet her after potions. They agreed and went their separate ways so they could get to their first class without raising suspicion.
“Nope.”
“I can help you out,” Hermione said, “With figuring things out. I know it must be hard and I can always… I dunno hex you? That's weird but you know what I mean.”
Hermione, still not hearing, said, “A little louder, please?”
Draco returns to the Slytherin Common Room, hijinx and self loathing ensues.
“It says we’re supposed to grind it,” He said, gesturing to his book with his other hand.
She stood up and brushed the dirt off her robes. She looked towards the castle, a pit of dread in her stomach. Part of her was tempted to run deep into the forbidden forest and never come back. However, she knew she couldn’t. No matter how much she wanted to, she couldn’t leave her mother. Especially without telling her where she was going. Not after everything that had already happened to their family. Her mother needed her and she knew that better than anyone.
Once again he got distracted by his body. He truly didn’t understand why it meant so much to him but
The school was for the most part very quiet, news of the Weasley Potter break up spread like a wildfire. Within the first week, he had 4 younger girls ask him out. After rejecting all of them people finally got the idea to leave him alone. Ginny seemed to be doing fine. Harry was not.
Draco nodded to herself. She stood up and looked at the curly haired girl.
“Why do you care Malfoy?” Harry growled, looking toward the lake, “I thought unbearable was your thing.”
“Delphine? From Delphinus.”
Hermione, having been working hard on it, had already finished. Although she had lots of pride, she understood when it needed to be put aside to do what needs to be done. Beside this detention was cutting into her valuable study time.
“By God, is being a girl that bad that he cried about it?” Pansy inquired, slightly offended.
She fell out of her bed and onto the floor, she crawled over to the mirror propped against the wall. She sat down in front of it staring at herself. She was amazed by who she saw in the mirror and how for the first time in her life, she saw
Hermione scoffed, “Of course because disgust is amoursley looking at oneself.”
She heard the clink of glass on wood and then heard him walk out the door. She waited until was sure he was gone. She turned over and ravenously ate the pasty, she then slammed the glass of water.
Draco bent over, she whispered, “I’m not a boy.”
Goyle whispered, “Oh you’re asleep. You weren’t at dinner so I grabbed you something to eat in hopes you’d be here. I also got you some water. Oh I don’t know why I’m talking to a sleeping person. You can’t hear me. Well if you can, I’ll leave them on your bedside table.”
A cruel cackle, she hated that. She hated that it was expected of her. She thought about this all the way to the room of requirement. The cruelty that had become synonymous with the name Draco Malfoy. Once she reached the room of requirement, she shook off all these thoughts, reminding herself that she was Lyra Malfoy now, and pushed open the door.
He then turned and left the room. Draco fell back on her pillow. Crabbe and Goyle had woken up at this point.
Ron snorted, “Can’t say I’m surprised, I always knew he was a sissy!” Hermione smacked Ron on the back of his head, he whispered a sorry through bursts of laughter.
The fact that the two of them were in detention came as no surprise to the headmaster, Professor Dumbledore. What had landed them in detention, however, was surprising to him. In Hermione’s own words she had “Kinda, sorta hit Malfoy with a sex transition hex.”
“I won’t tell anyone. I’m just… surprised is all. Is that why you and Hermione are friends?”
his. After so many nights of staring in the mirror, criticizing, hating,
“Well that we can agree on. Why would he be so sad though?” Hermione asked.
As she reached a corridor into the school, she resigned to just going to the dorm and hoping no one would ask her until tomorrow. As she entered, she heard the sound of dinner in the dining hall. She longed to go join them and eat, her stomach was growling at the smell of puff pastry and meat. She could do with a nice glass of pumpkin juice as she was parched. Alas she knew that if dinner was still going on then no one would be in the dorms and she could sneak in and be in bed before anyone even came in.
Hermione scowled at the horrible nickname. Lyra quickly corrected herself, “Sorry, Luna. I guess old habits die hard.”
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Ginny laughed, “Ok, um, so you’ve been a little different?”
Hermione, who was usually with Neville, was with Ron. Neville was now with Seamus, who was usually with Dean. Dean was with Queenie, who was usually with Pansy. Pansy was now with Parvati and Lavender, who were usually partnered anyways. Milinda and Hannah were together, as were Theo and Crabbe. That left Draco and Harry.
Draco smiled and got up. She walked around the room, scanning the bookshelves. Soon, she found what she was looking and grabbed it. When she set it on the table, it was Hermione's turn to be confused.
“I’m sorry?” Hermione asked leaning closer, “I couldn’t hear you.”
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
“I- Nothing.” Hermione stated.
Thank you so much for reading and all your kind words! I hope quarantine is treating you well! I'm having a bit of a hard time but writing this has made me genuinely happy! I'm so happy that you guys like it so much!
Hermione opened the door and held it open for Draco. The blonde hesitated before walking through it. What the room had provided was perfect, the room has high ceilings and the walls were lined with bookshelves that stretched all the way up to the ceiling. On the right side of the room there was a large fireplace with a mirror on top of the mantel.  In front of the fireplace, there was a carved coffee table that was dark wood, a large burgundy armchair and an emerald couch. On the opposite side of the  room there was an armoire of the same wood of the coffee table.
Back in the castle, two gryffindors and a ravenclaw sat in the library. Moments ago a blonde slytherin had ran out holding his hand to his mouth as though he was about to be sick. Though as they had all seen, there were tears in his eyes.
Luna spoke softly, looking down again, “ Why don’t you just talk to her? That’s the only thing you can do.”
“Oh! I’d completely forgotten!” Hermione exclaimed, “Wow. I’m an arse, aren’t I?”
“Aquila is kind of pretty,” Draco said before shaking her head.
“Well- I don’t know. Something is going on with him,” Hermione retorted, “Did you not listen to any of what I said about our detention?”
Draco started to cut the mandrake root into small pieces to make it easier to grind, when Harry grabbed her arm to stop her.
The subject afterwards was dropped. It didn’t truly matter, afterall the question was a random curiosity. Now though it felt important, so important. The name “Lyra” was perfect.
Hermione rolled her eyes, sitting down. Harry continued, “He did seem very sad. In a weird almost… pitiful way.”
When she reached the edge of the lake, her legs out on her. She dropped to the ground and let out a loud sob. She continued to sob curling up on herself. She cried, she cried for hours, she cried for herself, she cried for her reputation.
That was until a week before halloween.
Luna looked at him, making eye contact Harry noticed something. Her eyes weren’t their usual piercing pale blue but rather a stark storm grey. Harry knew those eyes, they didn’t belong to Luna. They didn’t even belong to someone who was a girl. Those eyes were wide and full of fear. Those eyes belonged to a certain slytherin.
Hermione rolled her eyes. Both of them returned their eyes to the book. Draco’s eyes were drawn down to her birthname’s namesake. That’s when a constellation caught her eye. It twinkled brightly on the enchanted page. Lyra.
Hermione grabbed a small scrap of paper out of her bag and a quill. She wrote a quick note asking Lyra to meet her and signed with something subtle that only Lyra would be able to decipher. It was a small caduceus to allude to her name being the female version of Hermes. She then looked across the room to the slytherin table. There she saw Lyra, sitting on her own. She walked by the slytherin table and dropped the piece of paper on the table in front of Lyra.
Harry stood at the end of the corridor, not sure what to do. When Ginny turned the corner.
Draco panics and gets lost. Everyone is concerned
Harry stared at her, Lyra’s eyes widened. Her stomach dropped, her brain repeated a multitude of expletives. How could she have let that slip? What was he going to do? What questions is he going to ask?
Harry set his stuff down, “I don’t know, Hermione. Maybe Ginny’s right, maybe he’s just going through a tough time.”
Luna pulled back, holding Lyra’s hands, “I’m like you. You’re like me! We were both born in the wrong.”
Lyra started laughing. Harry looked over scared, this was the first time he had ever heard Malfoy laugh not cruelly. He stuttered, “What?”
The black haired girl exhaled, “Oh good, I was worried you were going to run off. You’ve been avoiding us for weeks, you were upset for awhile and now you barely spend time with us. With me.
Draco gave a bewildered look. Crabbe added in, “You and GRANGER?”
Snape gave his godson a quizzical look, but decided against questioning the excuse. Rather, he informed Draco, “I guess your story lines up. I did find it odd that you wouldn’t take your stuff with you, wherever you’d gone. Not thinking straight is a rather good explanation.”
“I dunno,” Hermione said before theorizing, “Or perhaps something else entirely.”
Draco walked away after overhearing the conversation that the two Gryffindors were having. She was panicking, Granger had figured her out. Not only that but she was going to go talk to Lovegood about it. What would Lovegood have to do with this? Regardless Lovegood is the last person that Draco wanted to know about this. Due to, that would cause Loony Lovegood to approach Draco and that would not help Draco’s reputation.
Lyra responded with a nervous tinge, “I’m a little anxious, I mean yes we look similar but if people look too closely then they’ll definitely know.”
“Well, uh, thank you.” She said before grabbing the book she needed and returning to her seat. Hermione looked at where the blonde one had once sat and was lost in thought as to what to do. Eventually, after a minute or two, she shook herself back to reality and returned to her work.
She stood from her table, knocking one of the books off. This caused everyone in the library to look towards her. She couldn’t bear it. She felt as though everyone could see through her, that they all knew her secret. Her stomach was turning, her limbs were shaking, her eyes producing tears, her lungs heaving for air. She couldn’t breath. She was going to be sick.
A few days had passed. Draco and Hermione were sitting in the room of requirement, which currently stashed a table. They were studying when suddenly Hermione jerked and gasped in a loud and dramatic way. Draco looked up at her and cocked an eyebrow. Hermione held her face in her hands when she said "I just realized I never asked you your preferred name."
Blaise looked at Pansy with a look of hunger in his eyes and cocked an eyebrow. Pansy pushed his face away while rolling her eyes and laughing.
I talk about boobs so... you have been warned. Also it's a little shorter than typical
Luna stared at Lyra. Lyra held her breath. Hermione watched the two of them carefully.
Draco didn’t arrive before class began, or as class began. Not after five minutes or ten or twenty. Eventually the professor, Professor McGonagall couldn’t ignore the slytherin’s absence any longer.
None of their friends had wanted to know whether or not it was true. Hermione’s friends were wrapped up in the introduction of Ron’s girlfriend Lavender and Harry and Ginny were fighting more and more. For Lyra, Pansy and Blaise were no longer hiding the fact that they had been hooking up for weeks now(Even though Draco and Pansy were still a thing). Since they were all so wrapped up in their own drama no one wanted to figure out whether the two of them were betraying their house loyalties.
At this moment he was glaring at two hufflepuffs standing at a tree near the lake. The blonde of the pair was leaning against the tree and smiling down at the shorter brunette. It made him so angry.
Lyra was wearing a ravenclaw uniform with Luna’s signature radish earrings. The plan was for Hermione and Luna to stay in the room of requirement while Lyra went out and wandered around the grounds while under the guise of being Luna.
Draco walked over to the book shelf and cleared her throat, Hermione looked up then back down. Draco cleared her throat a little louder, Hermione turned to look at her and then back. Draco cleared her throat even louder, Hermione turned and said “Can I help you, Malfoy?”
