She squirmed uncomfortably under his hard gaze, as if rethinking her idea, but it didn’t take long for her to regain her nerve. “The way Defense is going right now, a lot of people won’t know how to defend themselves. I thought, since you spent all summer training, you could teach others Defense. It would have to be in secret, of course, and we’d have to be careful with who we invite, but it would be better then what we have right now.”
“And I repeat,” Umbridge snapped, though she forced an irritated smile. “Are you expecting to be attacked during class?”
Shoving him, Harry turned and started to run. He wasn’t sure where they were, had lost track of the house in their walk, but up ahead, he could see a small alley. If he could get to it, maybe he could hunker down, defend Dudley until Jonathan could come find them. He’d have to try using his patronus, even if he would likely get a strike for it, since his parents weren’t around to dampen the trace. But there wasn’t anything else Harry could do.
Stil, his cousin seemed happy, even if his aunt seemed warry. He was sure that Vernon would have a few choice words. Or… a lot of words. But he didn’t give a damn about what he thought, so why worry?
“No, Aunt Petunia,” Harry said quickly. “We… We just need a moment of your time. To have a quick chat. It’s… It’s kind of about Lily.”
Dudley frown, but nodded. As he did, something drew Harry’s eyes to the sky. It was only maybe an hour past noon, yet… the sky was unusually dark. It was like someone was slowly blocking out the sun. The warm summer breeze was suddenly gone, leaving only a cold stillness to the air. It was as if something had sucked the very life out of the air.
He winced before he could stop himself. Looking down, he fiddled with his hands as Honavi seemed to sense his discomfort and slid forward to coil around his wrist.
As he ate, Harry led the way down towards Hagrid’s hut, where his morning Care of Magical Creatures class would be. He knew that the others wouldn’t take long to join him down there, and he was pretty sure he could see a few of the Hufflepuff’s that he shared the class with already gathered around. Ba’ul was half on top of the hut now, rather then coiled around it. The gathered students seemed to shy away, not willing to get any closer than they already were.
For a moment, Harry wondered if he should tell her about the hearing. It did, after all, involve Dudley… If he had been charged, they would have come to Obliviate them. Still, he didn’t want them worrying about him. To know that he would be fighting this war on more than one front… So he thought of other things to tell them.
Frowning, Harry pursed his lips. “Well, the majority seem to believe the paper. They don’t want to believe that he’s back, so they don’t. Hermione and Ron believe me, of course. So do Ron’s brothers, Fred and George, as well as his sister Ginny. I managed to talk to Cedric Diggory and Cho Chang before hand. While Cho didn’t seem to want to listen, or even understand at first, Cedric did, and was able to convince her I was telling the truth. They said that they would eventually try talking with the other Hufflepuffs and Ravenclaws, but after the article, no one would really listen. Hermione and Ron’s siblings have been having just about as little luck with the Gyfindors, though Neville Longbottom seemed understand.”
Pressing on the blanket, she smoothed it down on his shoulder and smiled. “It’s okay to grieve for them, Harry. It’s okay to take the time you need to come to terms with everything you’ve been through. And, if you want or need it, we can ask Skyla to find someone trustworthy for you to talk to about the things you’ve seen. But today, we’ll take a break. Take a step back from everything, and just do something for you, alright?”
“No thanks,” Harry sighed. “I just want to be able to pass my OWLs without worrying about dying this year. Though, I suppose that’s too much to ask, considering my track record.”
For the first time since learning the spell, a corporeal patronus sprang forth. The large glowing animal charged forward to defend Harry from the darkness of the Dementor, catching it in the chest with its antlers. It threw the Dementor back, like it was nothing, until the Dementor fled.
Once Ron had nodded, Harry stood up and headed for the door. There were still a few hours before dinner, and he wanted to see if he could take the time to sneak into Umbrige’s office, just so he’d know what she was currently planning. But first, he needed to drop off his bag in the common room.
“I said,” Harry grit out. “Yes. I do expect to be attacked while we’re here. Three out of four of our teachers have attacked me, two of which aimed to
Harry floundered, not sure what to say, and reached up to pinch the bridge of his nose in exasperation. “Greg, that doesn’t explain why you were sitting next to my bed. Staring at me. While I was
“Go home,” his father said again, strained as he tried to keep his voice level. “You have to continue your training.”
“What’s this about?” she said, quick and sharp. “Best hurry. I want you gone before Vernon and Dudley get back.”
“I will call you, like everyone else,” his father said, not looking up from where he was sat. “So go home.”
“Vernon,” Petunia said quickly. She stood, reached out in an attempt at a calming gesture. “Vernon, please. He just came to talk.”
“Our headmaster is known for making poor or questionable choices,” Harry admits, “but hiring Professor Snape isn’t one of them. He may be strict, and sometimes he can be rather rough when critiquing a students work, but it’s just due to his high expectations. Though, this will be the last last year we’ll have to take Potions. That is, if we pass out OWL’s and don’t need the NEWT.”
“If it makes you feel any better,” Ron continues, “I would do it, but I can’t go into the Slytherin Common Room, or know when you try to sneak out at night.”
starting political debates in the middle of a first lesson. Because I’m certain that you will not have a response for all the things that have happened in the last two years alone.”
Umbridge scowled, starting to furiously scratch at her clipboard with her quill as she walked quickly out the room. Clearly, just like McGonagall and Trelawney, this ‘inspection’ hadn’t gone the way the toad had expected. Undoubtedly, she’d use this as a reason to stay, if she hadn’t already found one.
As Harry stared, Trelawney carefully handed back his page, readjusted her glasses, and moved to return to her desk. For a moment, Harry couldn’t move. While it wasn’t the same as when she predicted Pettigrew’s return, this was definitely a prediction. But… could he really trust a prediction made by Trelawney with a fake dream?
He knew almost immediately that Ron was lying. Hermione? A bad idea? That was his and Ron’s expertise. Hermione was the one that thought things through and made a coherent and functioning plan once she’d done all the research.
“Expecting?” his mother said. Her eyes widened, and the air grew heavy at the normally wonderful knews. “Russell… Surely you don’t mean…”
“Zinnia,” he breathed, shaking hand reaching out to hers on the bed. Voice thick with worry and agony. The stoic head of the Alistair family dropped to his knees, unable to hold himself up as he desperately held onto his wife's hand. “Zinnia… I… I’m…”
“The Wizengamot has also voted against investigating the Death Eaters that Harrison has named,” his father added. “For the last month, it has been debated. And, even with the fact that he couldn’t possibly have known about some of them, they believe that the endeavor would be a waste of time and resources. In act, it seems that they would rather put said resources into reassuring the public that He Who Must Not Be Named hasn’t returned.” Carefully, his eyes roamed the table, before landing on Harry. “How have the students reacted since the original article?”
Harry wanted to stay. He wanted to stay, to wait with his mother. But he knew that his father was right. He couldn’t sit around. If this really wasn’t a random attack, and she had been targeted by Voldemort, then Harry… Harry was to blame for his mothers injuries. If he had been stronger, had been with her, then he could have protected her. Or, better yet, he could have stopped Voldemort from even rising again.
His vipers were happy to have their home change, if it was only a bit. Even Gift, as grumpy as he was, gave a soft pleased hiss when Harry told them what he was doing. It had been a long time since Harry had the time to add to the garden, or even spend time with the snakes. He’d been so busy last summer, training, that he hadn’t gotten the chance. But he supposed it would be fun to continue this throughout the summer. He could expand his bedroom garden…
Slowly, Harry nodded, reaching up around him to grab onto the edges of the blanket to wrap it as tight around his shoulders as he could. He felt a little prickle in his eyes, and sniffed a bit, but smiled when his mother brought out a pair of plates and forks. The cake box had his treacle tart from Quinn’s.
“Is something wrong, Offi-” The woman cut herself off when her eyes landed on Harry. She stared, a storm of emotions flashing in her eyes, to fast for Harry to see. “You…”
Harry did his best to remain calm. He didn’t snap or roll his eyes. Taking his usually calming breath, he pulled his wand from his pocket, and placed it on the table. Petunia jumped at the sound it made.
Instantly, her lips pursed, brow creased as if she had just sucked a lemon. “Yes… I do. That man… He lived down the street from us, back before Lily even got her letter from that… school. I never really liked him. You said he’s a teacher now? I’m surprised your headmaster would let him around children.”
, by Inigo Imago. Harry picked his copy up, just to see what kind of nonsense they’d be ‘learning’ today. Seemed like they’d be working on dream interpretation…
The words were not meant to be callous, but that’s how they came across. They were a cold chill that washed over Harry’s entire being. His father… didn’t want him here. He wanted Harry to go home. To leave his mother here, and wait for someone to tell him she was okay.
to leave?” Umbridge hissed, standing straighter and seeming to make herself look as imposing as possible. “I am the Inquisitor! You can not make me leave a classroom in the middle of an inspection. This will result in poor marks on-”
His father glanced over. It was probably the most expressive Harry had ever seen him. With eyes filled with worry and his brow no longer creased with concentration, Harry knew that something was definitely wrong.
After class was let out, Harry made his way back down to the Great Hall, hoping to catch Hermione and Ron before dinner. He looked around, eventually heading down towards the dungeons. Ron had double Potions last on Tuesday afternoons, and would likely get out both late and hungry. He was probably on his way to the kitchens, if he wasn’t there already.
The witch glanced at him, but couldn’t seem to meet his eyes. She wet her lips, likely a nervous habit, and looked down at the parchment in her hands. “I… We’re doing everything we can to help her. So, please, be patient.”
“I know you want to trust him,” his mother said as she reached out, taking his hands in hers. “And I want you to be able to, but right now… Until we know for sure…” She shook her head, moving a hand up to smooth his hair back. “We’ll figure it out, alright? Later. For now, why don’t I go have Dizzy make us some tea?”
Reaching up, Harry grabbed at the corner that hung over his right shoulder, feeling the soft white material. As he ran his fingers over it, his thumb felt something on the underside, and he turned it over to look. It was his first name, stitched in the same soft red as the border of the blanket.
The toad faced woman reeled, looking almost like McGonagall had just slapped her. She didn’t speak again, as the professor demonstrated the vanishing spell, giving a few quick instructions to help those that struggled. Harry turned to look down at his snails, which inched around in their box. He felt bad about vanishing something that had done him no wrong, but he was a bit more interested in the conversation between Umbridge and McGonagall.
It was clear that she and Dudley didn’t seem to understand any of what Harry was staying, but he didn’t bother explaining. He was curious if she was actually interested in what he did at school, or if she was just asking to be polite. It seemed it was the latter, as she quickly moved on.
Harry himself could feel his stomach churn and tighten at the sight of the man who beat him and mistreated him throughout most of his child. He had known that Vernon had gotten out of prison, but he had been hoping not to see him. Sure, it had been inevitable. But he rather not have to deal with his uncle. Or his cousin.
“Do you need a lozenge, Miss Umbridge?” McGonagall demanded coldly, turning her furious gaze back on the other witch. “If so, I suggest you go to Madam Pomfrey. However, if you are doing this to gain my attention, I’m beginning to wonder how you expect to gain any idea of my teaching methods. You see, I generally do not allow people to interrupt me when I am speaking, as you should remember.”
She hummed, as if she had to think on that. “Honestly, it will depend entirely on your class and what you remember from your previous lessons. Should you be lacking in an area, we may not be able to move on before I have to leave. But I will endeavour to ensure you are all properly prepared for your OWL’s this spring.”
They said goodbye soon after, so Harry and Derrick could head back to the house in time to welcome their mother home. Well, Derrick was more interested in getting back to his work. But their mother had gone out to take care of something for the Gala, but Harry wasn’t sure what exactly.
defensive spells? I certainly can’t imagine any situation arising in the classroom where you would need to use any spell.”
the very idea. Harry did enjoy his privacy, and having someone always looking over his shoulder was the most unnerving thing Harry had to deal with. He made a mental note to redouble his efforts to shake Greg off his tail later.
“But if we were to be attacked-” Blaised tried, brow furrowed, only to be cut off by Umbridge’s laugh.
When they finally arrived at the room, the Mediwitch carefully sliding the door open for them, Harry could have sworn his heart had stopped.
When Vernon’s eyes landed on him, it was clear that, much like Petunia, he didn’t like the sight of Harry.
With that somber note, they did their best to move on. Freya’s husband Kale spoke up, mentioning how there had been a few strange people around the dragon grounds in Romania. Neva and Emit confess that the near slander to Harry’s name that the Prophet kept putting out was actually the cut down versions. There were hundreds of articles that had been cut for one reason or another.
“Oh,” Harry sighed. “I may have slipped last night about… my godfather? Now Greg’s supposed to follow me around all day because I ‘can’t be trusted alone’.”
Harry didn’t bother bringing up the Chamber and its tunnels, as he knew it would be useless. His mother had told them, of course, and while they agreed that the tunnels could be useful, Voldemort also knew about them. And Draco knew about the tunnels as well. It didn’t matter that Voldemort wouldn’t be able to enter the school grounds, and that made Harry the only one who could open the gates to the Chamber. It was a compromised location to them, and thus, unreliable.
“So far you have had four separate teachers,” Maria continued, adding a note of each teacher to their corresponding year. “Which has led to a bit of a disconnected learning environment. So, to start off, we’ll be running review lessons on each major subject until you have it all perfected. As they say, better to have one sharp sword than a hundred dull ones, yes? Now, before I begin our first review lesson of your Year One course work, are there any questions?”
Hey everybody! I've hit a sort of... wall with my writing, so I'm going to take a break. All ongoing works, including this one, will be on hiatus until further notice. Hopefully, I'll be back in action before the end of July.
They spent the entire morning at the hospital, with Harry’s brothers and sisters, nieces and nephews, trickling in as they heard the news. They sat and waited as long as they could, before they had to go home.
Skyla and Mason had both noticed an unnatural rise of injured muggle borns in the last week alone, though for different reasons. Skyla, as a Mediwitch in training, was treating an odd amount of confused muggleborns who didn’t remember how or when they had gotten hurt. Mason, on the other hand, was finding Auror’s bringing children of suddenly deceased muggleborns to the orphanage. With no muggle relatives that knew of magic, or magical relatives to speak of, they were being sent to Pixie Orphanage. With so many confirmed muggle borns present there, Harry’s father promised to arrange for Mason to have more help, in case Voldemort decided to strike there.
“Listen,” Harry said, keeping his voice calm. “If you wanna hang out sometime, I’m sure we can. But first, there’s something you need to know. About me, and my family.” He paused. “About your aunt, my mother.”
“He won’t be in any trouble if you keep your voice down.” With a heavy sigh, Hermione rang her hands in the strap of her book bag. “Umbridge will do everything she can to stay, and the Minister will allow it. The way things are, we’ll be woefully unprepared. We need more than what Maria-”
“No clue.” Swallowing hard, Ron reached for another pastry. “What do you need her for, anyway? You haven’t fallen for her, have you?” He wiggled the pastry in Harry’s face. “That’s a terrible move, mate. You know she’s dating Krum.”
Harry’s lungs burned as he hurried up the steps to St. Mungo’s hospital alongside Derrick and their father. They had barely had a moment to grab their coats that morning before they had gone sprinting for the Floo fireplace. His father had been so flustered, as they all were, that Derrick had to grab a fist full of powder for him.
Almost immediately, Draco stopped. He slowly lifted his foot, took a step back, and stared down at Harry. Grey eyes peered down at him, as Harry mentally kicked himself. He wasn’t supposed to let his friends and classmates see his Animagus form. If they managed to connect the white marking above his left eye to his scar, the entire point of being an unregistered Animagus would be moot.
“They’ve distanced themselves from me,” Harry eventually said. “Aside from Blaise Zabini and a handful of first and second years, none of them will talk to me outside of class. They’re all in dangerous places right now, with the exception of Blaise. He’s the only one in my year that doesn’t have a relative that is a convicted or ‘accused’ Death Eater.”
Harry couldn’t help but feel ashamed. He hadn’t meant to make Draco feel that way, he just hadn’t been feeling up to talking to… anyone. There was so much going on, from his mother’s condition to Voldemort being back to Umbridge and the Ministry, that he almost didn’t know what he was doing anymore. He was being pulled in so many directions, it felt like his head was going to explode from the stress, and he had started to notice that he was becoming quick to anger.
“I fell asleep while working on my moonstone potions essay,” he lied easily. “I dreamt that I had made a Drought of Peace, only for it to turn into poison and a moonstone.”
As Harry was frozen in place, his father moved quickly forward, knuckles white from how tightly he was squeezing his cane.
“Then he must belong to Harrison…” With another sigh, Draco made his way to his bed, dropping onto it. “He’s been rather secretive lately, and I understand why, but I would feel better if he would tell me what’s going on. Theo, Blaise, and I all told him we were on his side, but he barely speaks to us. And he just
When they reached Hogsmeade, Quinn was there, waiting to greet them. He kept a smile on, though as they grew closer, Harry noticed how strained it looked, his brothers eyes darting back and forth. When they reached him, Quinn gave his two children a tight hug.
Harry blinked, glancing around in confusion. It took him a moment to look behind him, noticing Greg standing just a step or so behind him, and watching the class and Ron over Harry’s shoulder.
Umbridge’s face went bright red, unable to keep up her charde. “Well, those are isolated instances, and the fault of your previous teachers. The chances of you being attacked here are-”
“I have an idea,” Harry said with a grin. “Actually, I think I may have accidentally made the perfect spot over the last two years.”
“Hem, hem,” Umbrige coughed again, this time much louder. Everyone held their breath as McGonagall stopped.
After arriving at the hospital, a mediwitch was quick to lead them to where his mother was being kept. She was trying to tell them something, maybe calm them down, but Harry wasn’t listening. His heart was pounding, practically trying to beat out of his chest, as his ears rang with the rush of blood.
For a moment, Professor Trelawney sputtered. “I… But… W-wait!” She took a deep breath, clearly trying to calm herself and return to her usual misty air, even as her fists shook at her side. “I… I do see something… It’s about you… Why, I sense darkness… A danger lurking…” Raising her hand, Trelawney pointed a finger at Umbridge, hand shaking as the toad simply continued to smile. “You are in grave danger! A great peril awaits you!”
“Alright,” Maria said, stepping forward. She looked almost resigned. “Alright, all of you. It’s time to settle down.” She turned to Umbridge. “Madame, I believe that you have disrupted my class long enough. Perhaps you should be out of the room while I teach.”
“Harrison,” she said, reaching up to massage her temples. “I don’t… I don’t even know why I’m surprised anymore. You do so many dangerous things, and most of the time you don’t even bother to tell us about it. But keeping a
She cut herself off again, her eyes darted towards Jonathan, then back at Harry. And Harry realized something. Petunia and Vernon had most certainly known about magic. Sure, Harry knew that they knew, if only because Snape had talked about them as if they did, but he had never really acknowledged it. That his entire childhood, they had lied to him about
“Probably should,” Harry mused, tilting his head in thought as he looked over the bush to spot out the different snakes. “Honavi and Nikoa were a really big help in the maze, and I could probably use their help again.”
Slowly, Harry’s mother nodded. “We’ll be here for you as much as we can, dear. You’re family, after all.”
“You’ve got a point. But you also had a point earlier. It’s not like we’d be allowed to do this all in the open, and it would be hard to hide that many students.” Ron huffed a sigh of his own. “If we can’t figure out where or how, then we won’t get anywhere.”
Shaking his head, Harry did his best to focus. “Anyway, the reason I came back to talk to Aunt Petunia. See, there’s this… Well, there might be a war coming. And you and your parents could get caught up in it.”
He knew that there was no way to shake Greg once he had his marching orders. The large boy was loyal to Draco, and thus to Harry, and if Draco said that Harry needed watching, then Greg wasn’t going anywhere. As annoying as it was, Harry would have to deal with it. After all the time he’d spent with Draco in the last years, he often forgot that Greg and Vince were right behind them, so he supposed he would soon forget about his new shadow.
Harry didn’t say anything, but he did nod. The bell rang, signaling the end of class, and Harry followed the Slytherin’s up to Transfiguration. He said goodbye to Ron at the entrance hall, as the redhead went up the stairs to his History of Magic class. Harry made sure that his sour mood at the news of Maria’s class didn’t show, though it was quickly forgotten as they reached McGonagall’s class.
As Trelawney finished her lecture, one hand came up to clutch at the edges of her shawl. “To start… Please make a note of your most recent night time vision, whatever you can remember, and consult the Oracle for aid in interpretation.”
Goosebumps ran up Harry’s flesh as the air grew colder, his eyes widening. He knew this feeling… This feeling of dread, of cold unfeeling helplessness, as if all the joy of life had been drained away. But it couldn’t be right… He
So Harry simply sighed, spending a portion of the next week preparing. Though, he had to agree that it was important that he know what he was doing ahead of time. There was an incantation he needed to memorize and repeat at dawn and dusk, a potion he would need to brew, and he’d have to be mentally prepared for the change his body would endure. Not only that, but he found that it was deceptively hard to keep something on the roof of his mouth without accidentally swallowing it.
“Welcome,” she said, voice light and cheery, as she tapped the chalk sharply against the board to dot the i’s in her name. “I am Professor Maria Wright, but please, feel free to call me Madame Maria. I am pleased to be here, at this honorable school, to teach you Defense Against the Dark Arts. As you could probably tell, I am from France, where I taught at Beauxbatons. However, please note that I will be gone for maternity leave starting some time in January.”
Another option would be the Shrieking Shack. It was secluded, not even on school grounds where Umbridge would be able to find them. And with the Shack’s reputation, thanks to Remus, no one would ask questions if strange sounds were coming from it. With all the rooms, they could even split into groups, have Ron help younger students, and Hermione and Harry could focus on the students their age. Still, there was the massive problem of how to get everyone there. They hadn’t started their Hogsmeade weekends yet, and wouldn’t until October. Not to mention, the only way they knew to get there in secret was the Whomping Willow. It was dangerous, and too many students going there at once would be far too suspicious.
From the side of the room, Greg gave a little cough, as if he wasn’t sure if he was supposed to say anything to that. Draco quickly stood, like he’d been snapped out of some kind of daze. Cheeks burning red, the blond cleared his own throat, and set Harry down on his bed.
, was throwing around unforgivables? I mean, really, letting things slide and Death Eaters escape Azkaban is what the Ministry does best nowadays.”
Before Harry could continue, Draco stood, lips still pressed tight. “Alistair,” he said, making Harry wince. He was only Alistair when Draco was mad at him… “If you insist on doing idiotic things, then I’m off to bed. I’ll see you in the morning.”
It was then that Harry realized something else. Something that he and Petunia had in common. They had both been lied to about Lily Potter’s death. Him by Petunia, and Petunia by Dumbledore.
Thankfully, everyone seemed to remember how to do them, though it was a near miss for Vince and Greg. They were struggling, even with simple spells. Someone would definitely need to tutor them… And, Harry supposed, it would have to be him.
Frowning, Harry sat on the couch across from Draco’s chair, pulling out his potions essay. “Four for four? No, it’s only been three. Quirrell in first, Lockhart in second, and Barty Crouch Jr. last year.”
“But I want to stay,” Harry tried, every nerve in his body lighting on fire as worry clouded his mind. “I want to be here for Mum, when she wakes up.”
“Er,” Ron said, reaching up to run a hand through his hair. “Actually, mate, I have… And it’s pretty bad.”
“Yes?” McGonagall said, turning to look at Umbridge with a scowl. Her brow was knit tightly together, lips pressed into a severely displeased line.
“Extraordinary,” Theo said. “Second year we were being attacked by a monster. It took Draco. And third year, Sirius Black escaped from Azkaban, and the Ministry
Anger roiled in his gut again, bubbling and wild. Harry thought Ron was his friend. But if the red head was willing to lie to him, maybe that wasn’t the case…
That sent a soft murmur around the Slytherins. Across the room from him, Harry could hear Blaise and Theo muttering in agitation, before the former thrust his hand into the air.
“Of course it does,” Harry hissed, glowering. “But how are we going to be prepared for a fight, if no one is going to teach us?”
They went up, one by one, to demonstrate the first year spells Maria wrote on the board. It was almost surreal, demonstrating green and red sparks, lumos and fumos, along with flipendo. Such… simple spells that had only been used in practice, or he had used nearly every day since learning it.
The anger dropped from him. Her proposed idea, in theory, wasn’t half bad. After all, if Umbridge was keeping Maria from teaching the class properly, then they’d need to have somewhere Umbridge couldn’t find to train anyway. Bringing others down there to teach them would certainly be a bonus… It could prevent some fatalities.
With a heavy sigh, Harry went to shower and get ready for the day. Thankfully, Greg doesn’t attempt to follow him in and stays out by the door. After coming out, clean and dressed, Harry led the way out of the dungeons to stop by the kitchens. Greg was more than happy to ask the elves for enough food to feed an army, while Harry just got some toast, a small bowl of fruit, and a mug of tea.
After pressing a kiss to his forehead, she got up from the floor and headed to the door. She shot him a smile before she left, and moved down the hallway, leaving Harry to his thoughts. He just wanted to be able to talk to his friends again.
“Sirius wasn’t the Secret Keeper for the Potters,” he started with. “Remember last year, when I mentioned Peter Pettigrew? Well, he was. See, James, Sirius, and Pettigrew were all unregistered Animagi, and Pettigrew escaped Sirius by turning into a rat. That rat was then found by the Weasley’s who named him Scabbers. When Ron was in the paper that summer, with Scabbers on his shoulder, Sirius broke out of Azkaban to kill him before he could betray me or my family again.”
With the first years in bed, Harry moved to his own dorm, finding his dormmates as he did every night. Blaise was laid out in his bed, drowsy and near asleep, while Greg and Vince were already snoring with candy wrappers slowly slipping from his fingers. Theo’s silhouette was visible through the curtains around his bed, wand held slightly aloft as a lumos lit the pages of a book. The only difference was Draco, who had his curtains drawn tightly shut, creating a void in the room with nothing beyond the emerald drapes.
If Petunia hadn’t been tense before, she was especially ridgid now. “Your mother? What could you possibly have to talk to me about her for? Can’t you be asking your-”
She smiled, bittersweet and tired, as her hand weakly held onto her husbands. Turning her head, she caught sight of Harry, gave him that same smile, and closed her eyes. For a moment, Harry’s heart stopped. Was she… Was she dead? Had they arrived too late? Had Harry lost his mother, unable to do anything but stand there like a fool?
Harry couldn’t help it. He laughed, shaking his head. “Yeah. Yeah, I got a wand. How’d you even know wizards use wands? Your dad hates it so much, I thought you wouldn’t know a thing.”
Slowly, Dudley gave a bit of a nod. He shot Harry a look before heading towards the door. Harry, not wanting to run to catch up with him, gave the adults a quick nod before following after him.
“She will be back.” He was keeping his voice carefully calm, or as calm as he could manage. “There is no need to worry.”
“Is Professor Snape not joining us?” his father said, voice calm and soft, but clearly carrying down the table.
“Vernon, sit down. This is more important.” She shot Harry a look, before turning to her son. “Dudder’s… I want you to go for a walk with… with Harrison. He’s… going to tell you something that you might not believe, but it’s true. It’s all true. Alright, Popkin?”
With everyone who had something to say done, Harry looked at the table, losing himself in thought. He thought about what everyone had said, and tried to think of what the next step was. He supposed the only thing he could do was keep training and make sure that everyone who needed to be informed knew what was coming. As Harry thought about who wouldn’t have heard about Voldemort’s return, a few very specific people jumped to mind, who might not even know about magic. And he couldn’t help but wince at the very thought of explaining to them.
Setting down the book, Harry instead pulled out a roll of parchment for ‘notes’ as Trelawney came out to begin the lesson. He was planning on starting on his essay for potions now that he had the free time. He could just ask Greengrass or Davis for the assignment, if he missed what it was, but for now he could focus on making a list of notes for key points in his essay. Others, however, began to whisper softly to others at their tables.
It was hard for Harry to not feel bad for Dudley, looking at him now. Sure, he had been a bully, but that was years ago. They had been children, not even ten. And now, Dudley was just a frustrated boy who didn’t know what to do with his anger. Really, Harry felt bad.
Harry watched him go, not really sure what he’d done this time. A glance around showed the Slytherin’s who had heard him staring with mixed looks of pity and concern. He wasn’t sure what he’d said to earn such looks, but he decided that wasn’t exactly important right now. There were more important things to worry about right now. He had an essay to finish, and he wanted to read the first chapter for his History of Magic class, so he doesn’t have to worry about falling asleep from Binns' dull lectures. Not to mention the horde of first years that needed help.
“Well, he must belong to someone,” Draco hummed, looking around. “Probably someone in our room. Did Theo or Blaise mention getting a cat?”
Alright, so, I'm gonna start reworking older parts tags to be more... specific. If anyone has any recommendations for certain ones, please put them bellow.
It was as Trelawney was going off about the importance of dream interpretation, that the soft and cheery whispers cut out. The trap door that led into the classroom was creaking open, revealing a much unwelcome face. It was Umbridge, a look of irritation on her lips that morphed into one of glee when she caught sight of the silent classroom.
Harry cringed. The Slytherins, while not outright saying they didn’t believe him, also weren’t speaking to him unless they had to. He understood that they were all in dangerous positions, but he missed his friends. And he needed the allies. As many as he could get. There was a war coming, after all.
“Ma’am.” His voice was as sharp as the scrape of his chair on the floor, filling the room and commanding the attention of everyone within. All eyes moved to him, even Umbridge, as he held his head high in defense of his teacher. “You can think whatever you like. Trust me, I don’t always believe in predictions either, but in my years at this school, there is one thing that has always remained true: if Professor Trelawney makes a prediction about danger in your future, you had best heed the warning. When it comes to death and peril, she is seldom wrong.”
Harry turned to watch Maria, as she heaved a sigh. She turned back to the board, flipping it over to write down the first revision subject. They’d be starting with what they learned in first year, all the way back with the first group of spells. It would be a sort of practical pre-test. Just to see if they still remembered. If they did well enough, they could start with a written quiz on Imps, to see if they needed a refresher course on them or could move on to Ghosts.
He meant it as a joke. Really, he had. But Dudley stuffed his hands into his pockets, looking down at the ground as he kicked a rock. He looked unbelievably sad, and so very lonely. And that’s when Harry began to wonder if, after he had left, if Dudley had had anyone his own age around. How long after losing their ‘wealthy’ status had the Dursley’s moved? And would Dudley been able to handle public school alone? Where he couldn’t use wealth to make friends anymore?
With each word, Petunia seemed to grow more and more frightened. A hand came up to cover her mouth, shaking in shock. She stared, horrified, as Harry finished.
After a quick chat with Pucey, Harry was left to get started on his Potions essay on Moonstones. He worked on his bed, glancing up to watch as Honavi slipped around the room, exploring every nook and cranny. And, until dinner, that’s how he spent his afternoon.
A wide smile akin to a sneer spread across the toads face. “Of course. Now… if you could predict something for me then, hm?”
Getting up from where he had been sitting next to Harry’s bed, Greg came around to help Harry up. Or rather, he grabbed Harry from behind, under his arms, and bodily lifted him to his feet. He dusted off Harry’s shoulders, looking rather pleased with himself.
The others were quick to follow Harry through. First Sirius, then Marrissa, Milla, Hester, and Quinn. Together, they made their way into the dining room. Much to Harry’s surprise, Quinn had been right. Everyone had come. His siblings, their children and spouses. Everyone sat at the enlarged table, having tea and cookies like nothing was out of place.
His mother was silent for a moment, frowning slightly. “Ron and Hermione?” she eventually asked. “Or… the others as well?”
Thankfully, no one was there when he arrived, and he was able to set his bag on his bed before transforming. The problem came when he tried to slip out the door to sneak into one of many cat passageways that Crookshanks had taught him to find. It was less of a problem, and more of a surprise.
Harry narrowed his eyes. He didn’t like hearing anyone talk to his family that way, much less a pig of a man like Vernon Dursley. He wanted to snap at the man, to finally be rid of him, but he knew that he couldn’t just sit back and let them get hurt or even die because of him. He didn’t want to have anything else to do with them, and they certainly weren’t going to write.
Turning back to the board, she began to write again, starting a bulleted list of a basic rundown of their teachers for each year.
Sorry for the delay. Been real slow going on OotP, and this took a lot longer to finish than I thought.
“Draco too… She really likes him… Calls him ‘the pretty one’. She likes it when he comes down into the Chamber…”
“Mum said you were gonna tell me the truth. So, like, you can use magic, and make stuff happen? You got a magic wand?”
In the meantime, Harry went to sit with his snakes, using the time to talk about Sila to them, telling them all about the giant sperant that Harry had met two years ago. They were split rather evenly between interested and cautious. Strup and Gift all seemed rather uninterested all togther, but agreed to go anyway. It might have had something to do with Honavi’s excited encouragement.
Harry got up from his moping couch to follow his mother to his room. She didn’t say anything at first, simply leading the way. Once they were there, she set down the cake box, and her basket, and moved to sit on the floor next to the planter box with the bush his snakes lived in. With a smile, she patted the floor in front of her.
It was still hard to talk about the other Slytherin’s. It was killing him, not knowing if he could still trust them or not. He was sure that Blaise would side with him, they were fairly close after all. And Theo got along well with Hermione and had hinted at his dislike of his father. Crabbe and Goyle, while Harry wasn’t close with them personally, knew they would follow whoever was in charge in their year. Which brought him full circle, back to Draco…
“Now, today we will be starting the year with Vanishing spells. They are easier than Conjuring spells, which are NEWT level, but could appear on your OWL test. We will be attempting to vanish snails first. Completely vanishing them will be our goal for the next few lessons. However, should you all manage it sooner, we will move on to mice early.”
As the day turned to evening, and evening into night, Harry started to get worried. His mother still hadn’t returned. When it got to around their usual supper time, Harry went down to check if maybe she had come back, and Harry just hadn’t been informed. He found his father standing in the entrance hall, scowling as he watched the door.
“It could be useful,” his father said, humming. “If you happen to be something that would realistically be in the castle, such as a cat, you can use that form to go to and from places without worry.”
“For the summer,” his father said. “We think it would be best if you were to stay out of the public eye for a while, and if you go out, you’ll need to stay with a chaperone. In the meantime, you will continue your training. In everything.”
Blaise only groaned as they reached their common room. “Everyone’s kissing the Ministry’s ass, because Fudge has them convinced we’ll all die if the Dark Lord is back. I don’t see why he couldn’t, at least, investigate just to be sure. Rather than simply saying it can’t be true. Does the man not have a brain?”
He waited, eyes raking over his two friends to gauge their reactions. Blaise looked like he was going to laugh, like Harry had just made a joke that hadn’t quite landed. Draco, on the other hand, had his face scrunched in worry. His brow knit together so tightly it looked painful, lips pressed into a thin line, as his arms crossed his chest.
As they got closer to Harry’s little corner of the classroom, he flipped through the divination book, finding the sections for moonstones and potions. He jotted them down, just in case, before turning back to his list of things for his essay.
The normally mild mannered professor was instantly tense, her hands clutching at her sides. By now, Harry wasn’t the only one watching the interaction. “The Inner Eye does not see on command!”
“I like parties,” Dudley said, looking almost hopeful. Clearly, his cousin was looking for Harry to extend an invitation, but Harry knew that he couldn’t ask him to come. It would be too dangerous, as they knew that there would definitely be Death Eaters there, who wouldn’t take kindly to a Muggles presence.
The other Slytherins came in around him, as Maria slowed her conversation, just in time for the bell to sound the beginning of class. The French witch smiled, gliding across the room to the chalkboard. As she turned, picking up the chalk to write by hand, Harry saw her wand sticking out of her hair, apparently being used like an ornament to hold it up in a bun.
Swallowing the growing lump in his throat, Harry did his best to not let his voice crack when he spoke. “Where… Where did you get this?”
Welcome back everybody! It's been a while, but I have returned. New chapters will be posted every other Sunday, so keep an eye out for chapter seven
His father nodded slowly. “Yes… It’s understandable. You’ll have to be careful with them, Harrison. I think you can trust Zabini, at least for now, but we can’t know for certain what side the others will be on.” Turning to the rest of the table, his father looked at the others. “Is there any other news that needs to be shared?”
He scoffed, pushing the flaky thing away. “I haven’t fallen in love with Hermione, Ron. I’m not in love with
“Welcome home,” he said, pulling both of them in tight, squeezing. When he let go of his children, he turned and gave Marrissa, and then Harry a hug. “I’m so glad you’re alright, Harry. When I heard about what happened from Mother, and then that paper…”
As students slowly worked on the vanishing spell, McGonagall wandered the room. Umbridge, while not following her, did ask questions whenever McGonagall got to close.
His mothers lips pressed into a line. “Yes… I remember how you recklessly went into a dark underground tunnel where you fought and killed a basilisk.”
By noon, all but Harry and his father had left. Derrick had gone home out of frustration, intending to use their large at home library to look for answers. Arrianna had gone to do the same, though at her own home in Diagon Alley. The others had wanted to help, but… There was likely nothing anyone could really do until she woke up.
There was a soft murmur as, one by one, the others began to stand. They were going clockwise around the table, with Moria standing to speak about the centaurs first. Apparently, they had seen the signs of a coming war, and had started asking Moria about it. She’d explained how Voldemort had returned, but that the Ministry of Magic were refusing to at the very least investigate. The centaurs agreed with Moria, though, and promised that when the time came, they would lend their aid.
Hopping up from the drawer, Harry slipped off the desk and down to the floor. He gave the cat that he came in with a little mewl of acknowledgement before he left. He hadn’t really found any of Umbridge’s plans, but it was to be expected. There just weren’t enough hours in the day to roam the castle in cat form while snooping on a Ministry official, but Harry supposed he hadn't come back with nothing. That quill, at the very least, was suspicious enough to warrant further investigation.
Another note was scratched into the clipboard, but Umbridge was already asking the next question. “You’re the great-great-granddaughter of the renowned Seer, Cassandra Trelawney, correct?”
“The Potter family vault,” she admitted. “When we went to get your things, your first year, I got the key for their vault, where all the things from their house would have gone. I didn’t take anything from it, before today, but after you went to school, I went down there to have a list made of all the things inside. After all, James was the last Potter, and that family once had an impressive collection of magical items.
Once they were outside, Harry just walked next to Dudley for a bit, unsure of where to start. Dudley didn’t know anything about magic, that much was sure. And Harry wasn’t even sure where to start. With his parents death? With how he learned about magic? Or should he just out right tell him ‘Hey, I know this is crazy, but magic is real, and look, this is my wand’?
With another sigh, he reached to grab one of the pastries. “I know. But she can start planning for that Defense group. I started thinking about it, and we might not have a choice anymore. Umbridge can use what I said in Divination to convince Fudge that she needs to stay, meaning Maria won’t be able to teach what she wants without pushback. And then no one will be able to defend themselves when the war gets into full swing.”
Harry glanced around, wondering if maybe someone else would ask. No hands were raised yet, so Harry decided he might as well put his own up. Maria turned, keeping her face carefully calm, as she smiled.
Harry raised a brow at her. “Where would we meet? How would we get a large group of people inside without someone seeing us? How would we even recruit? For now, we just have to wait, and keep our heads down. Think you can do that Hermione?”
“Have you had Defense?” Harry asked instead, keeping carefully calm. “I haven’t been able to see Maria yet, and I don’t have Defense until tomorrow.”
He didn’t sound nearly as convinced as he wanted Harry to believe. Something was definitely wrong. They had dinner without her, the table so tense, with no one really feeling like eating. Still, they hoped for the best. That she had simply gotten caught up in whatever she had been doing, and would be back by morning.
Pressing her lips into a tight line once more, Petunia turned back into the house. While she didn’t exactly invite them in, she did leave the door open, so Harry led the way inside.
“Not exactly the kind of party you’d be into, Big D,” Harry told him instead. “You’d have to get the wizard equivalent of a suit, and learn a ton of wizarding manners beforehand. Not to mention the dancing and all that.” The look of disappointment was clear, and Harry wished he could say yes. “But, uh, if you want, I can see about you coming out to the house sometime anyway? My birthday is soon.”
Once Harry was through the Floo, he was greeted by his mother. She smiled at him, pulling him out, and dusting him off. Dizzy was quick to come and take his trunk from him, welcoming him home, though she didn’t look at all pleased. He hoped it was because of the soot from the Floo, and not because she’d heard about Hermione’s SPEW effort.
When the drawer finally opened, Harry barely caught himself before he tumbled in. The drawer, much to Harry’s destain, was empty, save for one pitch black quill in a clear case. He scowled at the quill, wondering just what it was. It couldn’t be a spare, as he had just knocked the decorative cup that held Umbridge’s quills. Besides, why would a spare quill need a case of its own?
Greg and Vince didn’t bother trying to deny it, and were quickly back out the door. Draco turned to follow, only to pause, and turn back to gently rub between Harry’s ears.
She paused, eyes narrowed in a way Harry had never seen before. Every time Maria had spoken in the past, she had been calm and carefully composed. Never had she gained such a stern tone, an almost imposing air around her. For a moment, Harry wasn’t sure that he was looking at the same woman that had married his brother.
“He a police officer like the other guy?” Dudley asked, reaching to take another biscuit that Petunia had put out.
When Harry finally made it to Defense, his second class that Wednesday morning, he found that Umbridge was already inside, as Maria excitedly told her about her lesson plan. She looked rather enthused, while Umbridge looked begrudgingly pleased. Harry took the chance to sit in the front, simply bringing out the journals that Maria had been sending him over the years.
They ate, talking softly about things Harry wanted to do before he went back to school. Today, they’d be adding some grass and flowers to the bottom of his planter, under the whistling flower bush, but they could try to do something different every other week. After all, he deserved time off just like everyone else.
“No,” the Mediwitch said. “She hasn’t said anything. And… Well, we’re still running tests, but we aren’t sure what exactly is wrong with her. Save for the head injuries, she has strange full body stiffness to the likeness of the Body Bind jinx, but it’s been too long. There’s also strange pupil dilation. We think it might have something to do with her head injury, but they’re oddly large, and we can’t be sure until it’s healed.”
With a shrug, Harry glanced at the clock, finding that it was already time for class to start. Harry downed the rest of his tea, moving towards the door. Freya wasn’t too far behind him.
“Oh, don’t be such babies,” Freya groased, rolling her eyes as Ba’ul dropped to the ground beside her with a loud thump. “This is Ba’ul. And he’s as tame as a dragon can get.” She gently scratched at the softer patch of scales under Ba’ul’s chin. “He’s a bit special, since he’s the only dragon to have any sense of domesticity. This is due to a mix of imprinting and continued dependency after hatching.”
“Well, maybe you can meet some of my friends next time.” Pausing, Harry grinned. “Actually… I know a girl who lives not even a half hour drive from here. She’s the brightest witch of the age, and she could probably tell you a lot more about our history then I could. Then again, you’d probably be a lot more interested in meeting the Weasley’s…”
And just like that, Umbridge began to turn to leave. But Harry… Harry had seen this woman verbally berate two of his beloved teachers, and now a teacher who stood no chance against her bullying. He hated bullies, he hated how they treated those they saw as beneath them. And Harry wasn’t going to just sit back and watch this bully walk away.
Dudley’s face falls again. “Got detention a lot last year… The counselor said that I should try something new, so he made me go to the… dragons and whatever club. To try and put my, uh… anger into something creative.” He looked down again, scuffing his shoe in the dirt. “Left after two sessions, cuz none of ‘em wanted me around.”
Pursing her lips, she had an all too familiar look in her eye. The look she got when she was about to storm off for research. “Of course. Now, if you’ll excuse me, I need to go to the library.”
Returning to his notes on the uses of Moonstone, Harry kept one eye on Umbridge. At first she was scratching notes rather intently as her eyes bore into the professor. It only took her a few minutes to decide that wasn’t enough, and instead stood to begin sweeping around the room, following Trelawney around like a toad shaped shadow. Each table Trelawney went to, Umbridge was there to listen in on every conversation and ask the occasional question.
“If you don’t figure it out by then, I’ll tell you and Hermione tomorrow during lunch. We’ll meet in the usual spot. You think you can tell Hermione?”
“You’re right,” his mother hummed. “But I’m not talking about just Honavi and Nikoa. I’m talking about all of them. As you’re the only one who knows parseltongue at the school, they can be an outstanding help, gathering information for you. Or, if you can show them how to get around the castle, you can send a specific one to Ronald and Hermione to convey a message.”
While the professor did give a quick, if not outright vexed nod, Trelawney did turn back to the class to continue her lecture. Umbridge, meanwhile, was all too happy to pull up a chair and sit as she pulled her clipboard from her bag. Harry narrowed his eyes, and turned to give Trelawney his full attention, just to spite the woman. Who cared if the class was bogus? It was better than giving Umbridge the satisfaction of anything she could use to get Trelawney fired.
There were no rolls of parchment on her desk, so Harry had to work carefully to open one of the drawers. It took a while, but he didn’t want to risk changing back. While the woman was a slimy pink toad, she wasn’t exactly stupid. Harry wouldn’t put it past her to have some sort of alarm in her office if anything other than a cat entered.
He joined Blaise at dinner, with Noah and the other first years gathered around them. They all seemed to need help with something or other, asking Harry questions for every class they had that day. It was a bit concerning, as he couldn't remember his first year being that difficult. Not on the first day at least.
After his talk with his mother, almost a week ago, he had started again on his training with Sirius. They were working on spells that his godfather had thought of as particularly helpful in a duel, though once Harry got back they would move on to the Animagius ritual. They had decided that being an unregistered Animagius had more pros than cons, now that Voldemort was back for sure.
“After what happened at the Ministry, and what you said about… About the dementors and Lily, I thought you could use something of hers. Or that she had made for you. I thought this would be best… After all, it’s been enchanted. Euphemia and Lily’s magics should be imbued in every strand they wove. Their love… It’s an old fashioned style of knit, long before even the times of the Hogwarts founders. That’s what gives it that warm feeling. It’s their magic and love reacting to you.”
She went on to explain several facts about Hungarian Horntails, as well as dragons in general. The class, for the most part, ended up being a lecture. Most didn’t want to get too close to the dragon, and the most student interaction was boiled down to answering questions based on uses of different parts of dragons, like their blood, dung, and hide.
As Harry followed Petunia, he glanced around the room. Rather then an entryway, the front door led straight into the living room, which was also connected quite clearly with the dining room. To Harry’s photos of the Dursley’s hung carefully on the walls. They were all from before Vernon had been sent to jail, and Harry wasn’t in a single one. He guessed some things never changed.
I'm gonna be adding more tags soon, and I was wondering if anyone had any that they thought needed to be added? I'm not sure myself at this point...
“Mrs. Dursley,” Jonathan said, putting on his best officer smile. “Maybe it would be a good idea for us to discuss this in private? Maybe Harrison and your son can go out, take a walk, so everyone can be filled in?”
“Not since I was here last,” he lied. “Not yet anyway. My parents hold a party, at the beginning of August, every year. Mum is busy with the planning. She does most of it herself, before getting help with set up. It’s lots of fun, though. I usually get to invite two of my friends from school, and they stay at the house for a few nights.”
“I was thinking,” he started, going slow. “We need to make sure everyone who could be a target knows what’s going on, right?”
Harry knew, from a letter from his father, that the family would be getting together to discuss the best course of action, but Quinn surely couldn’t mean
“Merlin, no.” He couldn’t help but chuckle. “No, Derrick is a Potions Master. Trained by one of my teachers, the best potioneer in the British wizarding world. You may remember him, Aunt Petunia. Severus Snape?”
Grabbing hold of Dudley’s sleeve, Harry yanked him towards the alley. They dashed inside, and Harry was ecstatic to find that it had an overhang as a makeshift roof. They wouldn’t be dive bombed and ambushed then.
“Mr. Alistair,” McGonagall suddenly called. Harry jerked, looking over at her. “It would be best if you paid attention. Unless you intend to vanish your desk.”
Harry nodded. “This is gonna sound crazy, D, but… Magic is real. I’m a wizard. So were my parents, and so is my family.”
“Maria’s a great teacher,” he said, as if to ease Harry into the bad news. “But she said that we’re only going to be doing review. For now. Hermione was complaining about it this morning, says it might have to do with… You know, the Ministry.”
Harry blinked, thinking for a moment. He supposed they would be a fair bit of help, if they needed to do anything that would get them in trouble. They could also watch out for Harry in the dorms. After all, they still had no idea what Slytherins would be on his side and which would be under Voldemort’s power. And if they needed to meet in secret, he could probably send one to Sila to open a tunnel that led to the Chamber. Though, Draco knew about the Chamber, and could reveal Harry’s secret monstrous allie to Voldemort…
He was vaguely aware of somewhere called the ‘Come-and-Go Room’, but hadn’t ever been there himself. Supposedly, it could become whatever the summoner needed, whether it was a place to relax or a library. It could likely turn into a room where they could practice, but he still didn’t know where it was, or how they’d get so many people in without being seen. There was always the Marauders Map, but it was still a risk. Someone would notice a large number of students disappearing from the same corridor at the same time.
“As you all know,” Harry’s mother said as she folded her hands together on the table, “You Know Who has returned. He used the Triwizard Tournament to get Harrison away from the school, with the help of an escaped and disguised Death Eater. While the Death Eater had been caught, a mistake on Minister Fudge’s part has ended with the death of said Death Eater. Not only that, but the Ministry has outright refused to acknowledge the new and rising danger.”
Next was Dorian. He explained that, after Karkaroff’s abandonment of his students, many of the young witches and wizards returned to Durmstrang with confirmation that what Harry had said was true. It also helped that Viktor was the one leading the charge in distributing that information. However, the Ministries of Magic in that area didn’t seem to agree. They were investigating more then the British Ministry was, but they were more inclined to believe Fudge then they were to believe Harry.
Taking a deep breath, Harry walked up the little path that led to the door. He paused, taking a glance at the curb. There was no car parked there. Would they even be home?
“Blaise Zabini,” he said sharply. “You’re telling me that we won’t be learning how to use any new defense spells until
Harry turned to find the redhead seated at the little table in the kitchens, a plate of pastries in front of him and crumbs stuck to his stuffed cheeks. He couldn’t help but sigh, and moved to sit across from him.
She stepped out, holding a hand high in the air. Ba’ul, familiar with the gesture, crawled across the roof of Hagrid’s hut, the wood creaking dangerously beneath his weight. Everyone instinctively took several steps back, even Greg backed away, more afraid of the head than he had been of the tail. Harry rolled his eyes, moving to stand next to Ron.
A glance showed Trelawney scowling, but hunched into herself, as if trying to retreat and protect herself from the toad like woman. She looked almost offended, though a pause caused her to loosen, just a bit, as if realising the question wasn’t as rude as it had seemed. “Almost Sixteen years…”
Ron eyed Greg, who returned the judging look. “Guessing that blond git is the one that set him on you?” Harry nodded. “You know, for once I kinda agree with the slimy bastard…”
“I’m sure you’ll do just as great as Lily did.” She took a quick drink of her tea, and cleared her throat. “Anything interesting happen recently? I know you’re preparing for this…” For a moment, Petunia trailed off. After a moment, she huffed. “Well, I certainly hope you are taking the time to take care of yourself.”
“What?” Harry snapped, causing a few of the Hufflepuff’s nearby to look back at him. He quickly lowered his voice, practically hissing at his friend. “You can’t be serious. I’m not some kid that doesn’t know what he’s doing. I’ve fought dark wizards, survived a fight with a basilisk, and escaped from Voldemort. I don’t need a
It really didn’t make Harry feel any better. The idea of spending more time with his best friend was… appealing, he didn’t like the idea of anyone following him around all the time. He
The blond was perhaps the one he was closest with in Slytherin. After the events of second year, they had this sort of bond, with Draco confiding in Harry every now and then. It usually wasn’t anything big, save for Draco’s confession about still being afraid of Sila. He was also the only one who that always had faith that Harry wasn’t just a half blood tiny boy that got through things with dumb luck alone, and they always danced together at the Summer Gala.
Daphne Greengrass raised her own hand. “Daphne Greengrass. Miss, I think what Blaise was trying to ask was if we’re going to be attacked, it won’t be in a risk free-”
When they got to Quinn’s, they dropped off Milla and Hester’s trunks, before going to the fireplace. Quinn pulled out the small box of Floo powder, letting Harry go first.
Which, now that he thought about it… He still hadn’t told his parents about that. Sirius sort of knew, after he let it slip while talking to Draco at the last Gala, but he had managed to convince his dogfather to not mention it. Honestly, Harry was pretty sure Sirius forgot, what with the Tournament, and whatever secrets Sirius was keeping.
When class was over, Harry left with Greg and Blaise to head to lunch. He stopped at the entrance hall, spotting Ron and Hermione. Just as they had the last time Harry saw them together, they were arguing, voices slowly rising. He didn’t care what it was about, really, but the constant bickering was getting on his nerves.
For a moment, Dudley stared. Harry almost thought he was going to laugh in his face. But his cousin just nodded. He didn’t laugh, or call Harry a liar. He just nodded.
It was then that it hit Harry. Somewhere that fit nearly every criteria. It was secluded, with many entry points, and enough space for everyone. The only real problem would be the locked entrances. Harry was the only one who could open them, and he couldn’t exactly open them all at once. But, if they staggered arrival times, and started with the youngest groups first… He wouldn’t even have to lead groups in once he’d opened the door, thanks to the work he’d done the last two years.
Deciding to just fully come clean, Harry sighed. He leaned forward, resting his elbows on his knees, and his chin on his hands. “Sirius… is my Godfather. And he’s on our side.”
Hermione lights up, turning her full attention to Harry. Ron, however, rolled his eyes and spoke up first.
“I will. I’m fairly confident in most of my classes. Transfiguration is probably going to be the hardest for me, and maybe Potions. But McGonagal is a great teacher and Derrick has helped me learn a lot of Potions skills that will help me in the exam.”
With a fake smile and a rather condescending hum, Umbridge made a note. “That’s quite some time. And it was Professor Dumbledore that appointed you?”
“Yeah. Nephew, actually. Oldest sisters son.” Harry shook his head. “We didn’t come out here to talk about my family, though. Well, not really.”
To Harry, the question seemed needlessly invasive. Who really cared if others in Trelawney’s family had ‘second sight’. Most of it was hogwash anyway.
Before he could do anything rash, Jonathan finally took a step forward. Placing a reassuring hand of Harry’s shoulder, he gave a bit of a smile, before giving a bit of a nod off to the side. Frowning, Harry turned to follow the look, and his eyes met with Dudley’s. His cousin was staring at him, wide eyed, as if he had seen a ghost.
As a fair bit of the class sucked in sharp breaths, Umbridge simply rose a brow and wrote something down. “Right… Well if that’s the best you can do…”
He scowled at her. “Aunt Petunia.” He paused, then decided that this polite ‘let’s pretend we’re still family’ thing wasn’t working. Harry stood, placing his hands on the table, face set and serious. “Mrs. Dursley, your sister didn’t die in a random scuffle. She was murdered, in cold blood, while trying to protect Muggles like yourself in a war meant to eradicate you. Now, the man that was leading the opposition has been dead for the last thirteen years, but due to certain circumstances, he has
Maria spoke up next. Much like Dorian, she reported that those at Beauxbatons were in agreement. Madam Maxine seemed to have allied herself with Dumbledore. The french school would be preparing the best way it could for the inevitable dangers of the coming war. French Ministry officials were all investigating Harry’s claim, and they seemed to trust Madam Maxine more then they did Fudge.
,” Vernon hissed, his thick fingers balling into fists as his fat face was already turning purple. “What are
“Alright,” Freya called, clapping her hands together to rub them together. “Everybody here? Good. First lesson is on dragons, since I’m not sure when I’ll be leaving.”
“My son is going nowhere with one of your kind!” Vernon snarled. He was shaking now, and slapped a hand on the table. “I want you both out of my house, right this instant, or I swear, I’ll-!”
There was a soft chime from a cat clock on the wall, signalling the half hour mark. He looked up at it, beginning to wonder just where the time went. It was already six-thirty, and if he wanted to make it to dinner without being suspicious, he’d have to leave now.
Harry laughed. “No, no. OWLs are Ordinary Wizarding Levels. They’re where you have to be in core classes to at the very least graduate. NEWTs are… They’re more of a college level final exam, before you move on to finding a job, or looking for a master in a field to teach you. Stands for Nastily Exhausting Wizarding Test.”
would be there. Jonathan was still doing muggle police work in Little Winning last he heard, and Freya’s husband was supposed to be in Romania with Ron’s brother Charlie. Not to mention that Russell was on tour with his band, and his wife Maria was still supposed to be at Beauxbatons in France.
“Oh,” he sighed. “I may have mentioned Sirius yesterday, and now Draco doesn’t think I can be trusted to make good decisions. So he apparently set Greg as my personal guard. Just… Ignore him, and you’ll forget he’s there.”
The following Monday, Harry was once again allowed his free day. He decided that he should take that day to visit Dudley again. Vernon hadn’t been happy to see him and Derrick, who was begrudgingly acting as his guard. After Petunia’s husband had left, Harry sat down for tea with her and Dudley, Derrick sitting beside Harry and jotting down notes in his personal potions book.
“You will not pass an OWL,” she said, the exact second their class began, “without serious dedication to practice and study. There should be no reason everyone in this class shouldn’t achieve an OWL in Transfiguration if they put in the work.
He tried to focus, concentrate, as the Dementor came closer and closer. It’s gray and scabbed hands came up, reaching out towards them. The panic rose in his chest as a rushing noise slowly filled his ears. Harry tried to cast again, hoping his Patronus would work this time, but only another feeble wisp came out of the tip of his wand.
“There is something else,” Harry told her, chewing his lip as he held out a hand, letting Visham coil around his arm. “Remember second year, and the Chamber of Secrets?”
“You shouldn’t use ‘army’ to describe my family,” Harry said instead, keeping his voice low. “The Ministry wouldn’t like that.”
Harry picked up his page of notes, holding it out to her. He’d made something up, having to do with moonstones so he wouldn’t get in trouble for doing his essay. He’d looked up the meaning of moonstones, then peace, and poison since he was in the P section and hadn’t wanted to go looking for the meaning behind love potions.
“It’s just until Umbridge is gone. Just deal with two weeks of review and then we can go back to actually learning defensive spells. Just keep your head down and don’t let the toad goad you into doing something stupid, alright?”
“Harrison,” Draco said, voice thick with worry and somewhat drawn out, as though the blond was speaking to a five year old. “Are you forgetting about Sirius Black? Third year, he broke into the castle and nearly stabbed you and Weasley in your sleep.”
“Do you know where Hermione is? There’s something I need to tell you guys before she hears it from someone else.” For a second, he paused in thought. “Actually… She probably already has, so I suppose it doesn’t matter who told her. She’s going to lecture me either way.”
Clearing his throat, Harry lowered his hand. “If we’re doing only review, then does that mean we won’t be learning any new spells to defend ourselves?”
As Derrick turned to the nurse to demand answers, Harry walked to his mothers side. Had she been left to suffer all night? While they had sat on their hands, wondering when she would return, had she fought for her life? If Harry had gone with her instead of to the Dursley’s, would she even have gotten hurt?
“What happened to her?” Derrick asked. He was probably the only one of the three of them that could speak at the moment. “Was she able to tell you?”
The silvery wisps of vapor shot out from the tip of his wand. The Dementor paused, but only for a second. It continued forward, and Harry saw Dudley give a heavy shudder, wrapping his arms around himself. Harry swallowed, feeling helpless as he used one arm to carefully push Dudley back, the other keeping his wand up.
With a sigh, Harry walked over to his two friends, already feeling a headache coming on. “What are you two arguing about now?”
As he walked quickly, he caught sight of Draco, who was standing in the stairwell to the dungeons with Pansy. The two stopped as he approached, but Harry simply gave them a nod and walked past them. They didn’t say anything, just let him pass, and he reached the kitchens without fanfare.
Dudley perked up at that, and Harry was sure he was thinking about cake. He chuckled, shaking his head. He would likely just have Ron and Hermione over this year. They still didn’t know if they could trust the other Slytherin’s yet, and even if they could, it probably wouldn’t go over well to have them and Dudley in the same room.
His mother also started the Gala planning about that time, as there was only a month left before the event. They would still have the party, half to keep up appearances and half in an attempt to gather information. Harry would still have the mandrake leaf, but the plan was to just have him make a small appearance at the beginning, maybe do a quick dance with Marrissa, before heading back up to his room with Ron and Hermione. It would give his family a chance to convince any Death Eaters present the idea that they didn’t believe Harry, play up the worried parents bit, in an attempt to ease them into a false sense of security and confidence.
“The pain reliever,” she explained, holding tightly to her parchment. “She… Uh… When she came in, she was in a lot of pain. So she was given a few potions to lessen it, along with some dreamless sleep, but it seemed like she was refusing to let her eyes close.”
“I wasn’t aware that Millicent had gotten a new cat,” the blond said, more to himself, rather than Greg and Vince, who had come in behind him.
The sound of Lily Potter’s death slowly filled his ears, growing louder and louder. Voldemort’s laughter soon followed, filling his ears and crushing his soul with darkness. As the stomach churning smell of Dementor’s breath began to fill his lungs, he heard the thump of a body falling to the ground.
With a nod and a smile, she reached into her basket and began to unpack it. First was a small tarp, folded into a tight square, that was set aside. Next came a few small plant trimmers, as well packets of seeds and hand spades. These were put to the side with the tarp, as well as two sets of gloves. Then came the blanket.
Looking back down towards his snail, he found that it had moved out of its spot in the wood, and there was now a lighter and faded spot on his desk. Flushing, Harry put his snail back in place, and focused on his work. The toad could wait until later. After all, he could just sneak into Umbridge's office later tonight and see what she was using this information for.
Ron coughed, looking at Harry with wide eyes. “Harry, you didn’t do anything stupid, right? I mean, you said we should be keeping our heads down. Messing with the toad during class is the
For once, Trelawney didn’t immediately go off about how it meant he would die before the end of the year. Instead, her voice grew rather quiet, misty even, as she spoke. “You are entering a new chapter of your life, a pause in the cycle of inner turmoil and conflict. However, it is just the calm before the storm. A darkness approaches, which will cause you great pain and suffering. If you manage to purge this darkness, you will be graced with wealth and prosperity.”
When Harry reached Divination that afternoon, he let out a heavy sigh and moved to sit in his now regular seat. He was the only Slytherin in his year still in the class, aside from Daphne Greengrass and Tracey Davis. The two girls always sat together in the corner, seeming to take the class period to chat quietly, as it was an easy class to fake your way through. Trewlany would basically accept anything that spelled out Harry’s doom, so it wasn’t too hard to sleep through lessons and still pass with an Acceptable.
