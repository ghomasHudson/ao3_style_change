"It’s okay, Draco, I just need to see the bruises. I won’t do anything to hurt you." Harry whispered as he caressed Draco’s hair with his other hand. "I just want to heal the bruises, you don’t have to be scared little prince."
I would like to thank all of you who are keeping up with my updates. It makes me so happy to know that you guys are reading and enjoying my story.
"Look, I will not force you to tell me anything but I want you to know that I will be there if you need me. I will listen and I won’t judge you." Harry said and maintained eye contact with Draco, who was slightly frowning.
"What are you talking about Hermione?" Harry asked, wrapping both his arms protectively around Draco, who was still unable to catch his breath.
"Please don’t go, don’t leave me Harry," he whispered against his neck and the needy tone Draco used went directly to Harry’s crotch. Draco was placing open mouth kisses down his neck and Harry stifled a moan.
"I trust him." Harry whispered back. "Also I recognize some of it. He is drawing upon his blood’s power, upon his ancestors, using his own magic in only minimal amount. It’s actually very elegant."
Harry knew Lucius Malfoy was a cruel man but he didn't think he would ever turn against his own family, especially against his heir. He was shocked by Draco's words. He kneeled next to Draco and pulled the crying boy into hug. Draco didn't put up any resistance and just continued crying.
"Then let me explain the nature of Draco’s service to Voldemort," she said, looking the Head Warlock Marchbanks straight into eyes. "Draco didn’t really serve Voldemort, he was used by him. Voldemort took liking to Draco and because of that, abused and tortured him terribly, using him to satisfy his sexual needs. Draco Malfoy wasn’t perpetrator of torture, he was a victim," she said and there were many gasps across the courtroom.
"Yes, I was keeping myself pure for the arranged marriage with some witch. Lot of good it brought me. I don’t even like women. I don’t know if it’s ridiculous or sad." He chuckled.
"I care for you little prince. Be good and rest a bit. I’ll be back soon." Harry said and both him and Hermione left.
"Nice to meet you Harry. I was wondering, I don’t know that many of the other first years, would you maybe like to do a bit of shopping together?"
"I don’t think you need to be so worried." Blaise suggests. "Most of our housemates don’t hold him very dear. Partially because of his beliefs, partially because of his blatant favourism of Gryffindor."
"No, I thank you Hermione. It will be huge help. " Harry smiled. "Now, I better go and take Ron out of here. Remind me to erase him from the list of those permitted to the house by floo or apparition." He said as he lifted unconscious Ron from the floor.
"Draco, Hagrid definitely didn’t mean that. If you want to be in Slytherin, then I would like to be there with you too."  Harry says and gives me a big smile.
"Defence would be normally quite useful subject but like this, we won’t learn anything. If you want, the three of us, you, me and Hermione, can try learning by ourselves." I say and he nods.
"Draco…" he whines and clutches my shirt. I don’t remember him being like this in the original timeline. Harry Potter was always strong, or maybe he just had to be, he had nobody to lean on. I hug him tight. I’m supposed to train him to become stronger and I’m not so sure I’m doing very good job but I can’t help myself. He is just a kid.
Their lips met and Draco’s slightly parted to let Harry in. Harry, sliding his fingers into Draco’s whisper soft hair, deepened the kiss and the sweet intrusion of Harry’s tongue made the blond shiver and moan quietly. Their lips and tongues moving against each other felt so good the Draco’s mind blanked for a while in a pleasant way and he was beginning to relax. Harry drew back at last, tracing Draco’s lips with fingers and Draco felt the strongest impulse to take those long fingers into his mouth. But he didn’t, they didn’t know each other that well yet.
"So am I. After all, you made this. You are fucking nineteen years old and you made this." I say and wave the pocket watch in front of her face. It’s the most advanced time travelling machine that the wizarding kind has ever seen. It has it’s limitations though, according to all our calculations, the maximum possible range for me to jump without it killing me is 9 years. The most important difference between ministry approved time turners and this is, that I will not appear in the past as I am now, but my consciousness will travel back to my eleven years old body. Me in this time will stop to exist as well as this whole timeline because it will be rewritten by my actions. Or at least that is our plan.
"I don’t really know which purification ritual you are talking about but what about Luna?" Draco offered his idea.
"But…" Draco started to say something but Harry didn’t wait for him to formulate the thought and interrupted him.
Draco sighed again, they didn’t actually talk that much, which was mostly his fault. Maybe they would manage a longer conversation if he stopped having emotional breakdowns all the time.
"Yeah, exactly. The design will be kinda similar to this one, only more decorative." Harry explained, gently pulled up Draco’s sleeve revealing the Dark Mark and Draco looked away.
"I never thought I would live up to a day when Harry Potter is defending my honor." Draco laughed a bit. It was just a small noise but it filled Harry with warmth. He hoped he could make the blond laugh more in the future.
"Weasley twins. They are capable enough not to get hurt and will only approach Quirrell if there is an audience."
"I know Hermione. And I know the little you will love all the books I will let her borrow from the Malfoy library. You will end up even more clever and knowledgeable than you are now, if it’s possible."
"I’m sure some of them know and can’t act on mere suspicion. But you can. If you would just get his funny turban off, I believe there would be enough proof to get rid of him."
So he carefully peeled of Draco’s pyjamas, revealing his white underwear, long legs and two skinned knees. He smiled, if skinned knees are Draco’s biggest problem then life is good. He healed them in second.
"Wow, can I see your scar?" Weasley asks and I want to slap him. I always thought he was an idiot but asking somebody you just met about scar they got when somebody killed their parents and tried to kill them triumphs every single stupid thing he ever said in front of me until now.
"Please, don’t…. please. " he whimpered. "I can’t… can’t anymore… just kill me, please… make it stop. " Draco sobbed.
"He is so beautiful." Harry whispered. He could hear the windows coming back together and cracks in the walls getting filled but he couldn’t take his eyes of Draco to check.
"Oh, Draco. We are glad that you understand the point of making alliances. Just during this last month, you’ve grown up so much. Lucius, you must see it too. All he did was studying, reading and practising occlumency."
It seemed so long but then it was over, it must have been, because suddenly he could no longer hear the crackling of fire and the silk binding him disappeared. As soon as the restraints were gone he drew his knees up, hugging them, he was shaking, not able to stop. He thought about getting away but couldn't move anymore. The fire was extinguished but he was afraid to open his eyes and fighting an urge to vomit.
"Yes. He called it discipline. Said he will yet make a proper Malfoy out of me." Draco said and dared to glance at Harry, who was clenching his fists, his knuckles getting white.
"Yes, but…" Harry was going to say something but Draco put his fingers on Harry’s lips in indication to be quiet.
My original plan was to cast a cushioning charm and soften the impact when he hits the ground but suddenly I feel like I can’t let the boy fall. He will be traumatized about flying for next few years and that will not do much for his confidence. I imagine how much more useful could confident Neville be.
"Then I will find out a way to get rid of it." Harry said and Draco looked at him disbelievingly. "But I won’t stand anybody calling you names. You didn’t ask for the mark or for your role in the war. You suffered more then enough." Harry said as he touched Draco’s face in a caress. "Voldemort is dead and he has no more power over you."
Just as the last time, he is nervous and jumpy and pushes off hard too early. He rises higher and higher without any control over his broom what so ever.
And he was so gentle, so caring and he didn’t even hate him. He saved him, offered him friendship and protection. Harry was everything Draco ever wanted and more. Maybe if it wasn’t for the last year, Draco might have gathered his courage and confessed his feelings for the Gryffindor even if he didn't believe in favourable outcome. But now he was damaged goods, ugly and dirty.
"She doesn’t hate me. I listened in to her thoughts on a few occasions. They have such a unique pitch they are basically impossible to ignore even when I tried to. But will someone finally tell me what purification ritual am I to undergo? I might need some mental preparation for that, you know?"
"I’m sorry I wasn’t there to protect you Draco. It won’t happen next time, I will take care of you," whispered Harry as he caressed the blond’s back. Harry was so angry at Ron at the moment and he needed to feel Draco breathing and relatively alright in his arms to calm down. If he went to talk to Ron now he might do something he would regret. He felt so protective about the little Slytherin prince. It was like if the blond had talent for landing up in situations where he ends up hurt. Harry continued whispering softly comforting reassurances until Draco’s heart wrenching sobs reduced into quiet hiccups.
At first their lips just brushed against each other but then Harry deepened the kiss and all Draco could think about was Harry. Harry’s warm lips, Harry’s hand pressed into his back  pulling him impossibly closer and the other one tangled in Draco’s hair, Harry’s smell. It was like a sensory overload, all that mattered was Harry surrounding him and exploring his mouth.
He missed the manor but he feared it as well, it was filled with too many painful memories covering up the happy ones of his mother and of playing there with Crabbe and Goyle. Even the memories of running around the mansion with his childhood playmates now had a bittersweet taste because one of them was dead. They were unseperatabe, Crabbe and Goyle, and he couldn’t really imagine one withouth the other. They weren’t that clever and he couldn’t talk with them about everything but they were loyal. And Draco was missing them.
"Lucius Malfoy found out that when Voldemort asked Narcissa to check whether I was alive, she lied. He was angry and killed her. Then tried to kill Draco, that’s when I arrived. Thank god I managed to shield him but Lucius escaped." Harry explained.
"Yes, but the tables have turned. Now you are my adorable little prince." Harry laughed and tightened his hold around Draco’s waist.
"Yeah, he has made himself enemies on both sides. I’m not going to tell anybody Harry. We can just tell everything up to the point of you hiding him, if anybody asks, just tell that after shielding him he apparated away. "
"Let me tell you he is not hiding garlic there to be protected from vampires. I think it’s hiding smell of decomposition." I explain and they stare at me. "Some of my housemates have interesting talents, like being able to feel Dark Magic, close to Quirrell they get nauseous to the point of fainting. It’s quite telling."
I can see that she is remembering not only Harry but also all the others who died and she is about to cry. It breaks my heart to see her like this and I hold her tighter. She is my best friend now. The only other person I was ever this close to was my mother.
He knocked and when nobody replied he opened the door. The room was empty and Harry frowned. Maybe Draco was in a bathroom.
"Good. Then I will go to my room now and let you sleep. Good night, Draco." Harry said as he untangled himself form the blond boy and sat up.
Draco Malfoy was getting used to living at Grimmauld’s place. It was not by any means home, it was a while since he could call any place home. The Malfoy manor used to be one until the Dark Lord and his death eaters poisoned it with their presence. He never had what one could call good relationship with his father but he only started hating him when he allowed their family manor to be desecrated like this.
"I could never hand you over to him, he would have killed you." Draco explained. "He did kill you." His voice cracked and shiver run through his spine at the thought of the Dark Lord hurting Harry.
"Alright then, I'll be back tomorrow night. Be good, stay inside and have a rest." Harry said as he stood up and left.
"Draco, I’m so sorry, I didn’t know Ron would come by. Did he hurt you? Are you in pain?" Harry asked as he gathered the crying blond into hug. Draco was sobbing loudly and didn’t seem able to respond.
When he arrived back at Grimmauld’s place the whole house felt noticeably different, calmer but charged with energy, it’s air cleaner, even Walburga wasn’t shrieking her usual insults. He knew better then to credit Kreacher's house keeping skills for the improvement even though he probably helped. Before Harry died, he never believed the whole thing about pure blooded superiority but the true was old blood and the magic tied to it was indeed special. He could almost feel the house trembling because it was occupied by what it and also the old elf recognized as true heir. Kreacher called Draco Slytherin prince, how fitting .Thinking about Draco as a prince brought a smile to his face. He should go check on him.
"You are new, so you don’t know it, but our house is very loyal to it’s members, we won’t go running to teachers just because you said something controversial," one of the older girls says and smiles at me. "What’s said at the Slytherin table stays at the Slytherin table."
"There is something wrong about the professor teaching Defense." I say, not sure how I could explain I know he has a parasitic evil wizard hiding under his turban.
Harry pulled him against his chest and Draco’s body immediately melted into his. Harry saw that the Slytherin was growing more and more distressed as the time of the ritual was approaching.
The class eventually mounts the brooms and gets ready to take of. I prepare my wand and keep watching Neville, he might be awkward and not very good at magic but in the original timeline he killed Nagini and that counts.
"Me too. I read about both of you and Harry in Modern Magical History and The Rise and Fall of the Dark Arts and Great Wizarding Events of the Twentieth Century. Potters and Malfoys are some of the most influential and famous wizarding families." Hermione says awed.
As soon as he stepped into the ruins of the castle, Hermione rushed to him. "Harry, where have you been? We’ve been worried! We heard you went after Malfoy!"
Besides being headquarters for the order, Hogwarts also became refugee camp for anybody afraid of remaining death eaters coming after them and people who lost their homes in the war. Some of the older students decided to stay and help out taking care of others and rebuilding the school.
Draco, on the other hand, seemed to have become thinner. He seemed delicate and fragile, making Harry feel the urge to protect the Slytherin prince. And this time, in this life, he was going to do just that. There were too many lives in which he failed, too many times his ego didn’t let him get close to Draco, too many times he watched him die and once he even caused his death. Harry remembered it all when he was about to cross to the afterlife.
Comments and kudos keep me writing, this chapter would have came out much later if I didn't get such a kind feedback.
"Now, that really is extraordinary Mr. Potter! So boys, would you be interested in joining the team?"
"It’s almost done, Draco, it’s okay." Harry was calming him down, probably thinking the sound he made was caused by the pain and Draco was thankful for this small misunderstanding. He was also thankful for the fluffy blanket gathered around his waist and hips, masking what would soon be quite obvious erection.
When my head stops spinning I realize I am lying on the floor. It is a nice dark hardwood floor - our floor. I look at my hands and they are small like when I was a child. Check my forearm, the dark mark is gone. It worked, it worked, I am back in the Malfoy mansion and I am eleven years old kid again.
"Yes, yes. Kreacher will help Slytherin prince!" the elf nodded enthusiastically and even jumped a little.
"No, not really. He usually hides it when we are together but when he thinks I’m not looking I can tell he is in pain, he has nightmares, he is hesitant to do even little things,  worried to upset me or you." Harry sighed. "He is different. I’m glad that he doesn’t hide by the asshole façade anymore but he isn’t himself either. I don’t know what exactly happened to him but he is hurt a lot. Not only his body and magic but his soul too." Harry explained quietly.
"Ancestors would be so proud of the Slytherin prince. Kreacher must go tell mistress." Kreacher squeaked happily and disappeared.
Harry kept one hand steadily moving on Draco’s shaft while the other one gently pushed his tights further apart. He reached down, playing with Draco’s balls for a while and then past them, circling the tight opening there with one finger then pushing at it but not quite entering.
Draco wanted to reply something, maybe thank him but his thoughts were already becoming hazy, the potion really was strong. All he needed was to succumb to the comfort of sleep and so he did. Curled up against Harry’s chest, he dropped into nothingness.
"Unfortunately, yes, he has to be awake. Also any mind altering spell would render the ritual useless." Hermione explained, feeling sorry for Draco.
It takes Draco a moment to process what Harry said. If from Harry’s point of view they didn’t see each other for so long then it’s really no wonder that he is over their petty arguments.
Draco’s vision got all black, he couldn’t see at all. He tried to rub his eyes but it didn’t help, his head hurt and he needed to lie down.
Draco’s voice went straight to Harry’s cock, making it twitch in interest but Harry thought, he already took this way too far. By today’s standards Draco’s mindset about the whole relationship was anything but healthy but it still felt so right.
His eyes travelled lower, towards his chest, there were a few bruises beginning to form there, courtesy of the Weasel. Weasel might not be the brightest tool in the shed but he certainly wasn’t blind and he had a good intuition. He saw Draco for what Draco really was. Voldemort’s little bitch… Draco shuddered, did Weasel know how dead centre right he has been with his insults?
She changes her desk into a pig and back again. It is useless but impressive bit of magic. There is the lecture about theory of transfiguration and then we are given matches to try and turn into needles.
"You added a garden? How?" Harry was amazed. "Nevermind, come here. I had no idea you could do magic like that."
"Yes," I say and Harry nods. "I heard there are empty positions of Seeker and Keeper. I myself would be interested in trying out for Keeper’s position and I think, Harry would be an excellent Seeker, he has the reflexes and eyes for that."
"Thank you Kreacher, that’s exactly what we needed to hear. I’m glad my privacy is taken so seriously in this household," Draco said with a smirk and the old elf bowed and disappeared. "And I’m not lying about this, I didn’t get hurt in the battle."
"Show me your needle," she says and I do. She turns it around in her fingers a few times, looking at it from different angles.
"Don’t go." Draco demanded and he caught Harry’s wrist but soon realized he wasn’t in a position to demand anything.
"Here," she levitates a box of matches into my hand. "Try again, I want to see you doing that spell."
"It was damn hard climbing that tree!" Draco laughed as well. He felt lighter now that he shared his secret about having feelings for Harry with somebody.
Harry sighed. There was no use skimming around the topic anymore. "It’s a fire purification ritual," he said simply.
"It was about the issue that later became known as Statute of Secrecy in 1689. The battle broke out during the council where the Statutes were being talked over, the opposing sides only meant to discuss the issue but as more supporters of each side arrived, the atmosphere became more tense and fight broke out. Most of British wizarding community at the time was on the site and the conflict quickly escalated. You were firmly against the Statutes, demanding that the muggles should be educated about wizards and respect them. You and your family were maintaining ties with quite a few influential muggles at the time. I was supporting the Statutes because innocents were getting hurt and dying in the witch trials and I didn’t think muggles could be taught anything." Harry explained.
"It’s okay little prince, it will be better this way, I’m still here with you. You are doing so well."
Harry waited a bit but then pulled out of the hug and guided Draco towards the small wooden platform.
"Are you blind Harry? It’s fucking ferret! Voldemort’s little bitch! He isn’t supposed to be here!" Ron shouted.
Hermione rolled up Michael’s sleeve and fixed his arm to the table with sticking charm and Draco did the same with his, in a way that their fingertips were touching.
"Fuck, Draco, enervate." Harry whispered as he gathered up the blond boy from the ice cold bath. Draco’s eyes slowly fluttered open but he seemed out of it. Harry’s clothes got all wet but he didn’t care. He sank on the bath mat with the blond boy on his lap and summoned another towel to dry him up.
But he couldn’t do that, above all he needed to keep him safe. He didn’t want to trigger any flashbacks. They will take things slowly.
"Well, we can try talking. But I’m going to help even if he doesn’t apologize. Whatever he called me, he didn’t deserve to be tortured by the unforgivable curse and what it caused to him."
"I’m sure Fred wouldn’t mind if you went to pay your respects on a different day. I can explain it to the other Weasleys."
I’m sharing room with Harry, which is just perfect. Our trunks are already there. We each have carved wooden four poster bed, there is another fireplace and nice big window facing the lake.
Harry was awaken by a loud thud. He rubbed his eyes and scrambled out of the bed to look for the cause of the noise. He could hear voices downstairs.
Hermione had already casted all the necessary protective spells on Draco and they were waiting for it to get dark, as the ritual had to be performed on the night of summer solstice to be most potent.
"Draco, I would never hurt you like that. I’m not going to take advantage of you, that is not what this is about, do you understand?" Harry asked.
"No scars at all, your skin is so perfect." Harry said reverently and let his fingers trace across Draco’s collarbones.
They were still kneeling on the floor, Draco shaking and clutching at Harry's shirt, looking around worried.
There are a hundred and forty-two staircases at Hogwarts that keep moving, vanishing and appearing again. Without me, Hermione and Harry wouldn’t have made it to a single lesson on the first week without getting lost.
"For the traces of whoever cursed Draco to be removed he needs to go through purification ritual. Snape thought the best chances would be with fire."
"Alright, but if anything makes you uncomfortable – you stop. Anything scares you – you stop. Understood?" Harry asked.
"Maybe you don’t feel the way I do about you Draco, but you are so worth it. I will find the cure for the cruciatus damage, I promise I will do anything in my power to protect you." Harry said as he trailed fingers through Draco’s hair. "And Destiny can go fuck itself." He added and Draco laughed.
I focus on the matchbox in my palm and transfigure it into cute little red pincushion with sixteen needles stuck in it. McGonagall is delighted.
"Do we have something for Draco for the pain?" Harry asked Hermione, who started rumbling in one of the boxes.
"I’m so sorry Harry, I don’t know why that me in the past did what he did, I didn’t know I had a past life like that." Draco tried to explain.
"He looks like a stuttering idiot but don’t underestimate him, he is dangerous. When you do it, make sure there aren’t any first or second years around, but don’t be alone, he could get aggressive." I frown.
"Oh, Draco. That’s not it. Don’t be scared." Harry only now realized how he scared the blond boy. Draco must have confused Harry’s actions for something sexual.
He could barely hear Harry's voice talking to him, saying, "You’re going to be okay little prince, you’re going to get through. Just a little longer."
"No, my little prince, you didn’t deserve it. And after we heal you with the potion we can get you help in Saint Mungo’s."
Harry asked her if she could make sure Ron doesn’t spread around that Draco is staying at his house because it would put them in danger and Mrs. Weasley promised to do that.
After Harry left the room Draco went to the bathroom to run himself a relaxing steaming bath. He set on the edge of it as he watched it fill up, sometimes checking the temperature with his hand. When there was enough water, he removed his clothes. As he did so, he noticed his reflection in the mirror.
"You are big." Draco whispered, running his fingers up and down the eight inches long member, his touches featherlight and appreciative.
"I don’t think it’s your fault at all Harry." Draco chuckled darkly and Harry frowned. "Didn’t you say yourself that I always die young?"
Harry explained to Hermione everything he knew about Draco’s condition and he could see it affected the Gryffindor girl greatly. She had only been under cruciatus once and it scarred her mentally enough for life.
He was never with a boy like Draco, so delicate and prettier than any girl. He run his hands through his hair and down his spine. Draco was still wearing only unbuttoned shirt, which was falling from his shoulders, but blanket was covering him from the waist down.
"Does it feel okay, Harry?" Draco asked with a uncertain voice, looking up at Harry from under his blond hair.
Harry looked away from Draco onto the intruders and frowned a bit. It was Ginny and Hermione, the former looking beside herself with anger. This wasn’t good.
Harry finished the spell and breathed hard, he could hear all the glass in the house shattering and remotely realized it must be his magic doing that. He was so angry, clutching his fists making his knuckles whiten. He wished Voldemort was still alive and he could torture him for days for what he did to Draco. He knew Draco was hurt but he never imagined him being violated like that.
"Yes, Harry. " Draco agreed eagerly. "You know, I’m not made of porcelain. Get comfortable, I will take my time," he said, pretending to be confident but blushing adorably.
"See you in the past." I say and kiss her cheek. Then I click the button on the side of the golden pocket watch and the world starts spinning.
My mother takes in how malnourished and small Harry looks and how old his clothes are and presses her lips into thin line. I’m bit afraid she will hex the woman and we will have to pay ministry to cover it up like we usually do, for which we don’t really have time at the moment, we have a train to catch. But my mother is an embodiment of self-control like usually.
So he rested and read. He wasn’t able to focus very well though. His thoughts kept going to Harry. He was drunk on finally getting Harry’s attention. The way Harry held him when they slept, the gentle tone of his voice, his warm hands -  it was what Draco always wished for.
Hermione took a deep breath before replying. "Attempted murder of Albus Dumbledore, murder of Narcissa Malfoy and being Death Eater, therefore torturing and killing muggleborns, muggles and serving Voldemort."
"I love you as a little sister, as a family. But I realized I don’t want a romantic relationship with you. I’m sorry. I shouldn’t have kissed you. I’m sorry Ginny." Harry explained softly.
I knew I could mimic my old self to a certain degree and pretend to be a git, but even the idea of doing that makes me nauseous. I can hardly tell my parents I am a time traveller from a future where they are both dead and I’ve already lived nineteen years, so I changed quite a bit. I don’t think I can trust them yet and they might even send me to mind healers in St. Mungo. At the same time, I don’t want to straight out lie to them. Half true and some omission with a bit of fabrication seems like a way to go.
"Make it two coffees please, Kreacher," Harry said to the old elf who murmured something about filthy half bloods but moved on to make those coffees. Harry focused on the blond, who frowned a bit hearing the elf's quiet insults.
"Very good." Harry said and placed one last kiss on Draco’s forehead before he stood up and left the platform.
"No wonder you didn’t want anything to do with me, when you have those two cuties living with you," the guy said and alerted Harry and Draco of his presence. Draco’s body immediately went stiff, and Harry started comfortingly stroking his back. Draco didn’t like strangers.
Now, Harry was in the kitchen, reading Prophet when he heard movement in the bedroom upstairs. He went to see Draco with a small tray of food.
"There isn’t any... My mother asked Snape to do some research to come up with potion that would help and he was working on it but he is dead now, so no luck there. I’m also out of the potion he gave me for managing the pain, I used up the last of it during the battle." Draco explained like if it didn’t really matter to him.
"But I let him do it and sometimes it felt good." Draco cried. He knew he was fucked up well to ever enjoy what was between him and Voldemort. To come when he was being raped.
"Draco, shhh, you did nothing wrong. You aren’t dirty, you aren’t a whore." Harry said softly and caressed Draco’s back.
Harry imagined that Draco was probably put under cruciatus for not being able to terrorize muggles or something like that. But the true was so much worse. Voldemort has made the blond into his sex slave, hurting him for his own gratification.
"I’m not the one that had their heart broken by Harry Potter." Draco chuckled. "At least not yet. " he added much more quietly.
"Ron, there was no time to tell you." Harry sighed. It was quite typical for Ron to focus only about how things affect him. Harry liked Ron, but sometimes it annoyed him how selfish he could be.
"It’s good to be able to joke once again but Draco, seriously, when you get back in there, you need to make us work ourselves to the bone and you have to focus on your talents too. This time around we will have to be stronger. Too much depends on it."
Dear Merlin, Harry wanted him so much, wanted to devour him. Fuck him deep and hard until he forgets that Voldemort ever touched him. And then make sweet love, soft and tender. Make him come over and over again, until he wouldn’t even be able to leave the bed, all limp and blissed out.
"I didn’t." Draco replied, breathing hard. Black spots were starting to appear in front of him and his head was spinning.
"Harry, Draco, this is Michael, he is here for the tattoo." Hermione introduced the boy. They have been looking for a way to erase Draco’s Dark Mark for days without any success until Hermione came up with idea that maybe it could be transferred instead of erased. Only they would need a volunteer.
"We aren’t even friends, Potter. It’s one thing that you don’t hate me anymore but being this kind to me just doesn’t make any sense. Why are you doing this?"
Draco sat on the chair in the middle of the courtroom. Hermione placed her hand on his shoulder and gave him a small smile.
"I’m so sorry for what happened to you Draco, I’m going to do my best to figure this out." Hermione said to Draco who still wasn’t in any state to respond.
"No," the blond replied. "I’m naturally really good at occlumency, so I’ve always blocked all the attempts."
"I should put him to Azkaban personally. See to it that he suffers and gets a Dementor’s kiss." Harry growled. "Since when did he beat you Draco?"
Harry pushed the blanket to Draco’s waist and finally got a good view of Draco’s chest. There were angry purple and blue bruises covering his lower ribs, looking now more severe then yesterday night.
"Thank you Harry," said Draco and expected the other man’s palm to disappear but it continued it’s journey on his chest.
"Yes, thank you," she says and sits next to me. "You see, I’m not from wizarding family so I don’t know anybody on the train. My name is Hermione Granger."
"No…" Draco breathed and his whole body tensed. "No, no, no, no…" he repeated over and over again, letting his hands run into his hair and pulling on it.
"Draco," Harry said and placed one hand on the blond’s shoulder. "There is nothing dirty or disgusting about you."
I'm thankful to any of you who follow up when I post new chapter. Your comments and kudos motivate me tremendously. Please let me know what you think of this chapter ^^.
"You didn’t leave any note and you didn’t tell anybody anything but there wasn’t any sign of anybody else being there, no traces of magic and the wounds were self-inflicted. I was the one to find you."  Harry said, barely audible.
Harry was walking to the kitchen, getting ready to talk to Ron about what had happened. He was angry at the redhead but understood that Ron acted mostly out of surprise and fear that something happened to Harry.
"I just wanted to get clean." Draco whispered and then gasped when Harry’s palm moved over his forearm, sending again this strange warmth, healing him.
Harry nods and Ollivander goes deep into his shop and then comes back with ornate black wooden chest. He opens it and it contains dozen different wands. The atmosphere in the shop changes, air becoming heavier and tingling with long forgotten magic.
Draco knew what was coming, by now, all of the calming draught he had before lost it’s effects. He was sobbing loudly, his hands pressing on his mouth only doing so much to muffle his voice. He was trying to disappear into the chair, shrink himself to nothing.
"H-Harry…" Draco stuttered. He was somehow getting confused whether he was enjoying being touched by Harry like this or whether it was making him uncomfortable. Probably a bit of both.
"It feels absolutely bloody amazing." Harry marvelled and sighed happily. Seeing Draco, kneeling on the ground, touching his feet was making him feel all kinds of things, the situation was strangely intimate yet it felt so right. He thought, not for the first time, how beautiful the blond was.
Hermione pulled Ron away. "Ron, stop! It’s not like that! Harry took him here to protect him. Look, Harry is alright. We were just at Hogwarts to pick up something. Draco didn’t do anything wrong." Hermione said and looked at Harry who was already kneeling down next to Draco and murmuring finite incantatem to get rid of the ropes.
"Maybe you are right. I was really upset when you didn’t take my hand when we were eleven." Draco chuckled. "I think that is why I was so mean to Weasel and Granger. You must not tell her but actually, I was always very impressed by how clever Granger is." Draco said seriously.
"This is not what we agreed on." Harry said and pulled Draco’s face closer, kissing the corner of his mouth. "I like this. But not if you’re only doing it because you think you have to." He said and looked into Draco’s eyes sternly.
"Hermione, I’m hiding Draco at Grimmauld’s place but we can’t tell others about it, you understand, don’t you?"
Draco thought that after the Dark Lord, if he ever managed to get away, he will never be able to have sex again but here he was, quietly burning with need, his breathing heavy, imagining Harry's strong hands taking his clothes off, holding him down, exploring his body with his tongue. Dear Merlin, he was too far gone.
And that is basically how we got to this moment, where I’m about to jump eight years into the past to make sure Voldemort doesn’t come back, Dumbledore doesn’t play us like chess pieces, Snape doesn’t die useless death and actually helps out when needed and if Harry needs to fight, he is ready to actually fight and have a chance of winning, not just throw expelliarmus left and right and hope for the best.
"Not at all. Classifying spells into Dark and Light is a wizard made concept, most of the time there is nothing about the spells themselves that make them so. You can use dark spells for good, for example secare
"Yes, I am perfectly capable of taking care of myself." Draco smirked. "I’ve done so for 17 years and look how well it worked." he chuckled.
Draco was sitting in the bathtub, there were new scratch marks all over his body and he was rubbing at his dark mark in a vain attempt to erase it. It was starting to bleed, making the water in the bath have a pinkish tint.
"He called her… something bad, suggesting that her blood is dirty because her parents aren’t wizards. It’s nonsense of course, muggle born children usually have quite strong magical powers, we say that they were picked by the wild magic itself. Children of pure-blooded families – that’s what we call the lines where there aren’t almost any muggles – tend to favour Slytherin because it respects wizarding traditions the most. On the other hand, muggle born kids usually don’t care much about wizarding traditions, therefore making Slytherin the house with the least muggle born children." I explain and Harry nods in understanding.
Harry was swept with a sudden wave of warmth. Draco, with his childlike neediness and longing, wrapped up in a fluffy blanket was simply precious.
"Yes, the potion instructions are complete!" she said and sat down. "Snape finished quite some time ago, it’s written in such a detail that I don’t worry at all that I can brew it without any mistake."
"Hermione, does he have to be conscious during the ritual?" Harry asked and Draco stiffened a bit in his arms.
Harry was glad to be back at home, he was exhausted and couldn’t wait to fall in bed and sleep but first he wanted to check on Draco.
"I’m alright, elf. No need to wake Harry up, I just slipped a bit. I must have been still half asleep, will you make me a coffee?" Draco asked.
It was agreed that one of the first steps to take would be to push for release of all the unrightfully imprisoned wizards who dared to stand in the way of ministry when it was under Voldemort’s thumb and re-establishing auror forces. Then rehauling the ministry, focusing on hunting down death eaters and the trials. And rebuilding, there was so much rebuilding to do.
"It was sad. Everybody was devastated but George looked like part of his soul was missing, he didn’t talk, didn’t cry, he just was there. Ron ignored me and kept his distance. Molly was crying the whole time and went to lie down a bit early. The rest of us stayed and had a drink."
They sat down on the bed. Harry took Draco’s left hand and rolled up the sleeve to see the dark mark on his forearm. The skin there was red and angry, bleeding a little.
When it was done Kreacher moved to kneel on the opposite side of the circle facing Draco and placed his hands on the outline of the circle. Draco did the same but only with one hand. He took the wand in the other and pointed it towards his neck. He closed his eyes in concentration and started murmuring spell neither Hermione nor Harry recognized.
"What did I say, Potter?" Draco snapped but his eyes looked worried and vulnerable. He reminded Harry of a small scared kitten, trying to look scary when it was itself feeling scared.
"No, Professor McGonagall, I’ve already finished transfiguring my match so I was doing a bit of reading ahead." I say and show her the advanced transfiguration textbook I’ve been hiding under my desk.
so here I'm with another chapter. We didn't get anywhere with the main storyline but get a lot of relationships developement between characters.
Harry only now took in the crying form of the blond boy next to him. Draco’s face was drenched in tears, his arms hugging his thin frame in a vain attempt to stop the tremors running through his body.
"I want to know what it feels like. Besides does it get anymore special then kissing your soulmate? Or… maybe you don’t want to? It would make sense if you didn’t want to kiss someone like me…" Draco said quietly and averted his eyes. He was going to stand up and move away but Harry didn’t let him. Draco could feel one of Harry’s hands holding his waist firmly while the other one moved onto the nape of neck, slowly guiding him closer.
"Okay. Then here is what we will do. I will tie you up and cover your eyes. When the time is up, I will undo the restraints." Harry said and expected refusal or hesitation on Draco’s side but the blond just held Harry tighter and nodded.
"You are doing so well, it’s already almost dark. Now let me cover your eyes. " Harry said and casted another incarcerous.
"I want to try flying. I really do," he practically jumps with excitement. Jeez, little Harry is way too cute.
"You really are totally drunk." Draco sighed and stood up. "It’s late, let’s sleep," he said. He moved to the other side of the bed and slipped under the covers.
"Okay, H-harry," Draco said and blushed. It just seemed really intimate to use Harry’s first name after all those years of calling him Potter.
"But Harry, honestly, why are all the windows broken? I wouldn’t have barged in with Ginny like that if I didn’t think you were under attack." Hermione frowned.
"And why would it be bad to be sorted in Slytherin?" I ask and pierce the half giant with my eyes. He is already putting ideas in Harry’s head and while I’m together with them, I will not let such a thing happen. Besides, I need us to be together and Slytherin is the most likely choice.
Draco responded to the touch curling himself against Harry. Harry liked it, he did well. He let out deep, content sigh and rested his face against Harry’s chest. He felt warm, wanted and safe.
"You have no idea how much self-control it takes not to fuck you into the mattress right now." Harry growled and brushed his fingers down the ridges of Draco’s spine all the way to his perfect ass, cupping and stroking it.
Draco thought it was really nice talking with her. Somehow his worries were pushed aside for a while and he could laugh and joke about things. It would be nice if he and Hermione would really become friends, he thought.
"I got angry and my magic accidently burst out a bit." Harry shrugged his shoulders, trying not to make a big deal out of it, not to remind Draco what made him angry in the first place. Not to think about Voldemort touching what he had no right to…
Harry wanted to hug Draco and hold him till he stops crying but he already felt like he was crossing a line. If Draco wasn't shaken from his mother's death, he would hardly let him this close, allow him to touch him like this. In this last hour, he had touched Draco more than in the last seven years altogether.
"Are you sure you are strong enough to do the spell Draco?" Harry asked worried but Draco looked determined. His back was straight and there was glint in his silver eyes.
"I want to belong to you. I don’t want to be free, I want to be yours." Draco whispered and dared to look at Harry’s face to see his reaction. Harry was looking at him in such a loving way, like if he really was something valuable and precious.
It was strange, to be at Potter’s house… no Harry’s house. It was by no means stylish bright town house, not at all, as soon as they apparated here, he could feel the old magic of the Grimmauld’s place. It was undoubtedly quite dark and powerful, but somehow not harmful and even somehow noble. Compared to the stiffening poisonous atmosphere of the Malfoy manor, this was like a holiday retreat.
Harry shaked him with more strengh by both shoulders. "Wake up Draco, you have to wake up!" and the reaction was almost immediate, Draco’s silver eyes opened, he scrambled up into sitting position and away from Harry, his big eyes scanning the bedroom for any potential intruders. He was breathing fast and his eyes were full of tears. Just looking at him like this was making Harry's heart break.
"Draco, what did you dream about?" Harry asked and Draco looked up at him. Hair was partially covering his face.
There is still a lot of chit chat, they have a lot of issues to go through but at least they do kiss.
"Good Draco, it will start working soon. I’m sorry I wasn’t here. We’ve got Snape’s research, Hermione is going to work on it," Harry whispered as he held the sobbing blond.
"Today, I’m going to become Harry Potter’s friend. We will meet while shopping for Hogwarts supplies. He will be accompanied by the Hogwarts groundskeeper – Hagrid. We need to be polite to him, I want to make good first impression to Harry, so far he will know nothing about this world but what that half-breed  has told him. He needs somebody to guide him."
We continue our lesson and it’s soon quite obvious that me and Harry are the best flyers in our year. Madam Hooch even allows us to separate from our group and have a race around the Black Lake.
"You letting me kiss you like this, letting me bind you, trusting me with the ritual, you don’t know how much it means to me Draco. You don’t know what you do to me." Harry whispered into Draco’s ear and stroked his hair. "How do you feel?"
Part of Harry’s mind was screaming to be careful not to push Draco too far but as the blond’s body melted into his and his hands clutched onto his shirt, Harry knew he didn’t have to worry.
My visions started in my last year at Hogwarts and at first, I didn’t really pay attention to them. We didn’t have any seer in our blood line that I knew of and I thought maybe it was just my mind playing tricks on me because I was stressed. But then they started to come true.
"Some of them probably already have their own guesses but they wouldn’t go against Dumbledore since he is the one who hired Quirell."
In a minute or two the buzzing stopped, and Draco breathed out. He set his wand down and dared to open his eyes to look around himself.
"Are you staying with me tonight?" Draco asked, hoping for a positive answer. He enjoyed sleeping together with Harry, he almost didn’t have any nightmares that way.
So another chapter is here. Harry and Draco are getting a little bit closer and talking a lot. I hope you will like it.
"Madame Head Warlock, you can see that Draco is under considerable stress, may he be excused for the next part?" Hermione tried asking, her eyes pleading with the elderly witch.
"Professors of the Defense very often dabble into Dark Arts themselves and sometimes they get tangled in more than they can handle." I whisper to her. "Harry is sensitive, he can feel magic more than you or I can. Quirell doesn’t look like it, but he is dangerous. And that turban is definitely not normal wizarding fashion and garlic doesn’t work against real vampires."
"It’s okay, you just aren’t letting your broom know clearly what you want, brooms react to our body language and instincts. You give it very confusing directions, it’s scared, it’s not even sure whether to keep you on or shake you off and bolt towards the Forbidden Forest." I explain and he stares at me, his eyes huge and his face all white.
"Yes, I’m sorry, it’s embarrassing really. I used to make fun of you when you were afraid of something and now you are the saviour of the world and I’m this pathetic mess," Draco said and he avoided Harry’s eyes.
"You were punished more then enough for that tree incident. Moody, I mean Barty was horrible to you."
"Yes, Harry Potter can. I have the same memory from him as well as he was watching the whole thing from under his invisibility coat." Hermione said and submitted the memory in a vial.
"I’m sorry, my little prince. I didn’t want us to do anything you would regret later and I triggered that flashback, didn’t I? You are safe with me and I want you and I’m not rejecting you, do you understand?"
"Surely you see what state the house is in. I want to fix it." Draco said and the elf’s eyes widened in understanding. Slytherin prince was going to repair the Most Noble House of Black! Kreacher’s eyes filled with happy tears.
Anyway, History of Magic taught by ghost is perfect environment for a little nap and Hermione is the only one in the whole class who manages to make notes until the end of the lesson, everybody else is either distracted by doing something else or sleeping.
He couldn't help but notice how thin did the blond get, he could count his ribs without any problem if he wanted to. Harry and Draco, they had such a long history. It should feel strange comforting somebody who was supposed to be his enemy for so many years but it didn't feel so. He only felt relief that he managed to shield Draco from that curse, relief that Draco was alive.
Harry looks at me all nervous,  I smile at him and nod in what I think is encouraging manner. He looks back at the wands and puts hand above them, just as I did before. He closes his eyes and lets his hand hover above them for about one minute and then one of the wands jumps into his hand. He smiles and gives it a swish.
His delicate bones were visible, fragile shoulders and ribs to count. Platinum blond hair was partially covering his face, his lips were parted and he was breathing faster, arousal clear in his eyes.
I turn around and see that indeed, the squid is right behind the window, peeking inside curiously with one of her big black eyes.
"There, all done. " Harry said and run his palm across Draco’s skin again, as if admiring his handiwork.
"No, my little prince, he was wrong, he was so wrong in a way he treated you, he was wrong to hurt you, he was wrong to speak to you like that." Harry tried to explain.
"Okay, I’ve been watching you a bit, you focus a lot on the incantation and the wand movement, both of which you do perfectly. But do you visualize it?"
"You have your mother’s eyes, Harry Potter. I remember the wand I sold her. Ten and a quarter inches long, swishy, made of willow. Nice wand for charm work. Your father had a mahagony one, eleven inches, pliable but powerful." Ollivander says as he measures Harry’s wand hand.
It didn’t surprise Harry that Hermione Granger was one of them and he didn’t doubt Ron would also be here, if he wasn’t mourning the death of Fred.
"Yeah, I never dated at school, I was worried my father wouldn’t approve. He was supposed to arrange a marriage for me. That’s how it usually works with pure bloods. But then the Dark Lord chose me to be his whore. So yeah, he was my first and only. First blowjob, first fucking, first everything. Or maybe not everything. He never kissed me." Draco admitted and hated himself for the sadness that crept into his voice.
"Alright then, Harry. Owl us your address, okay? Have a good rest of the holiday and if your relatives change their mind about letting you visit, just send an owl," father tells him in a friendly manner and then we tell each other our goodbyes.
"I never thought about it like that. I guess Slytherin could be nice." Hermione says and smiles at me.
Hermione entered the kitchen with a brown-haired guy trailing behind her, finding Harry with Draco perched on his lap, feeding him apple pie. It wasn’t unusual to find them close like this, most of the time Draco was clinging to Harry, craving the closeness and Harry happily obliged him. At first, she was embarrassed at the sight of Harry holding and petting the blond but she quickly got used to it. Their relationship was very sweet.
Draco sat down and stared at his breakfast. He was hungry and it looked quite appetizing, it were his favourite blueberry pancakes, but Draco knew his manners and since Hermione wasn’t down yet, he decided to wait for the witch. Anyway, the food was put under stasis charm and wouldn’t go cold.
Merlin, he looked terrible, it’s been a while since he made a habit of avoiding looking into mirrors, he used to be so proud of his good looks. But that was before they got him the attention from the Dark Lord. Then he started to hate his face and his body.
"I’m sorry, Harry, I’m so sorry I let you see that. Please, don’t be angry with me. But you had to know  what I am. " Draco whispered and sobbed. " I am a filthy whore. You should just wash your hands clean of me. I don’t deserve your friendship. I will leave."
"It’s not like I had a great childhood either but your father is much bigger piece of shit then I thought." Harry said and took Draco’s hand. "Draco, now listen to me. You didn’t deserve any of it. You didn’t deserve getting beaten by your father or Ron. You didn’t deserve to be treated like that. You are good enough. I see more and more clearly that you never really had a choice. Things will be different now, you are an adult, Voldemort is dead and we will make sure your father is locked in the prison till his death. They have no more power over you. You can start making your own choices. And I will be there with you along the way, because we are friends now." Harry said and squeezed Draco’s hand.
"Well, you will never get sorted in there, you’re a mudblood." Ron mumbles and Hermione freezes. Ah, so she already knows what that word means. She is hurt and looks like she might start crying soon. I remember myself calling her that in the original timeline and I regret it tremendously.
"It’s just a dream, Draco. It’s okay." Harry tried to wake him up but the blond was too much caught up in his dream. He started mumbling from his sleep.
Harry lightly pulled on Draco’s hair, to make him tilt his head a bit more and kissed him. Draco gasped in a surprise but opened his mouth to allow Harry access. Harry loved tasting Draco and he took his time exploring his mouth until Draco was left a trembling and moaning mess and they were both hard again.
"By any means necessary. You are not setting foot inside that house ever again. You are special and they treat you worse than a dog. I will not allow that." I say and he looks at me like I’m the most wonderful being in the whole universe. It flatters me. Taking on a role of his guardian and guide is more satisfying than I expected. He is sweet and naïve and I want to protect him.
"We can't keep kneeling here, let me help you to one of the beds, alright?" Harry said and pulled the blond boy up. It was so easy, Draco lost a lot of weight, he leaned onto Harry as if he didn't have any strength left to carry himself but Harry didn't mind. He helped Draco to the bed and sat himself at the edge of it. The blond was still crying and Harry couldn't get himself to leave the room.
Slytherin prefect, she introduces herself as Gemma Farley, calls and leads us to the dungeons. We reach the entrance covered by intricate stonework.
I sit next to him. "I wish I could do away with you relatives for how they treated you without the threat of legal repercussions, but we have to be smart about this. You are worried, whether you will do alright at school. You will. There are many other first years who haven’t done any spellwork before either. Also, I’m here to help you, okay? We can study together, you will do okay."
"Then just do it, I’m yours." Draco breathed and nibbled on his neck. "You can do anything you want to me," he whispered as he undid the buttons of Harry’s shirt and trailed kisses down his chest and stomach. Gently he took Harry’s hard cock into his hand again and Harry sucked in a breath. Draco looked up to see his face stiff with concentration, muscles tense.
"You are drunk! And you apparated! Do you want to get splinched?" Draco started scolding him. He got out of the bed and was checking Harry for any sign of splinching.
Harry prepared his wand, he knew he will need all the focus and power available and even though he was quite skilled with wandless magic, for this particular spell, he didn’t want to risk it.
Second chapter is here my dear readers, hope you will enjoy it! I will be very thankful for any comments (I'm very interested in your opinions) or kudos.
The meeting with The Order was strange mixture of happy, relieved, and sad. They counted their loses, remembered Lupin, Tonks, Snape, Fred Weasley, Colin Creevey, Lavender Brown but also Dumbledore. Harry helped to clear up the whole story but didn’t share more then he deemed necessary.
"Ron was such an asshole, I will deal up with him later, make sure he apologizes." Harry said and continued caressing Draco’s back.
