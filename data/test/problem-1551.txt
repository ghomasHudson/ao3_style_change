"I don't know how often. He brought you up here, you know.", Hermione answered and pulled a strand of bushy hair behind her ear.
"What had happened?" Harry asked.
"It will work out." Ron said quietly.
"Then why did you come over here?" Potter asked.
"Then tell me, Potter, what do you think you are doing here?"
"I know you don't like to hear this but this isn't about you anymore." Harry said and felt anger boiling up inside him.
The Slyhterin had been in the bathroom for a very long time and suddenly Harry felt he didn't have much time until he was going to pee himself, so he got up and walked to the bathroom door.
Draco looked at Potter, who formed a soft smile with his lips and Draco looked away again. He felt so stupid. Because of everything. And he felt so unbelievably sorry. But he couldn't say it. He just couldn't tell Potter that he was fucking sorry.
. It was so unusual. Malfoy took his hand away again, what made Harry look at him angrily.
"You didn't. You never did," Potter said. His eyes were shining and Draco just couldn't argue with those green eyes.
Draco was tired of it- so tired. He dried his tears and sniffed. Merlin, what was he doing?
"Draco!" Zabini barked.
"It won't be the same without you two in our dorm." Neville had a sad tone in his voice and Harry knew he was the one that would miss them the most.
"You kissed?" Neville asked loudly. Harry shushed him down.
Harry smiled and his heart was racing again. Harry threw himself onto Draco, who laughed and kissed Harry.
Malfoy made an understanding sound and looked around. Harry smiled at how awkward Malfoy felt. They stood in silence for a few minutes, brooms in their hands.
Malfoy seemed like in a trance. He followed Harry with an empty look in his eyes and almost stumbled into two healers on their way, so Harry grabbed him by the shoulders and moved him forward until they reached Narcissa's room. Harry let go of Malfoy and looked at him with a worried look.
a fifteen year old Dudley can it be?", Harry said.
Something was wrong. If it was the kiss or that Harry realized he might be falling for Malfoy. Maybe not exactly
Underage warning! Graphic description!
"Just listen, please," Ron said.
" Theo cut Draco off, "This is ridiculous. Since when are you such a wuss?"
"Just look how I do it, right?", he ordered and after Malfoy nodded, Harry pointed his wand at the wall.
When Draco woke up, the sky outside was already bright. He looked over at Potter's bed, and found Potter still sleeping. Draco rolled his eyes and stood up. He opened his suitcase, took out one of the suits and his underwear and left for the bathroom. Draco got undressed and stepped into the shower. The warm water streamed down his face and chest. Draco shivered. Taking a shower always felt good. It was one of Draco's favourite things - taking a hot shower on a cold September's day. And rolling into a warm blanket and read a book when it was cold outside. And drinking Butterbeer with his friends when it was snowing.
"Feet down, Arthur." Mrs Weasley immediately said.
"But Harry, if you don't want to, you shouldn't. We all know you and Malfoy can easily lash out." Luna said seriously.
"After years of training, Malfoy steps into the footsteps of his late mentor Severus Snape."
"What?" Malfoy snapped and opened his eyes.
Harry noticed that Ron and Hermione shared a weird look and Harry guessed it was because of Malfoy. Sure, it was kind of weird having Malfoy sitting here and having breakfast with them, but he didn't do anything wrong right now, he didn't even say
Harry shook his head carefully, so Malfoy wouldn't wake up. Hermione nodded.
"Okay. Alright.", he said, "If you want me now to leave then-"
Harry heard Malfoy laugh in his head.
are not going anywhere before you are allowed to. I might be going on my own but I'm not sure about that yet."
Weasley didn't answer her, but kept talking to Draco, "See, Malfoy. Without their consent, we can't tell you where Harry is. So I suggest you better get your damn shit together and be nice."
"Shut your mouth!"
Harry shrugged. "I guess my dreams were justified then. Again."
"It isn't! Harry's parents were nice people! They loved their son more than anything on this world! My mother loves me, my father can stand me, but they are not like Harry's! I would give everything just to have a family like Harry had! I didn't even know his parents, but I love them! And my parents are one billion times better than you are!", Draco shouted.
"He is. Now, I need you to go, Potter needs his rest."
This was a joke. Potter was a joke.
"He writes that he and Hermione want to come over tomorrow for dinner.", Potter answered and looked up from the letter.
"What memory did you choose?", he asked interested.
"Hermione! Ron!", he said and hugged them both.
"Tomorrow? For dinner?", Draco asked and Potter nodded. He threw the letter to the couch and walked close to Draco.
Draco looked out of the window. The sky was already dark and snow was falling. He decided to write his parents back before Potter's pack was leaving. So he grabbed quill and paper from the shelf, sat down at the table and started writing.
"Good morning to you too, Potter," Draco answered.
Draco woke up in the middle of the night. Potter was asleep next to him and Draco did his best not to wake him up as well. His mouth felt dry. Draco grabbed his wand in the dark and lit it. There was no water bottle in sight and Draco groaned. He got up carefully, checked that Potter was still asleep, put on his trousers and sneaked out of the room. Draco went downstairs and grabbed a glass in the dark and filled it with water, then leaned against the sink and drank. When Draco heard footsteps, he hoped he hadn't woken Potter, but it was Weasley that switched on the light and came through the door.
Potter just shrugged stupidly and Draco really enjoyed mocking Potter's friends and not even getting shit for it from Potter himself.
Malfoy didn't answer, he just looked at his hands in his lap and shrugged. Harry sighed. How could he deny Malfoy his wishes when he was this sad?
Malfoy shook his head wordlessly. Harry wanted Malfoy to talk, he wanted to know what was going on, he wanted Malfoy to let go.
Harry took hold of Draco's hips and slowly moved them together, crating greater friction.
Potter-
"No," Harry said very softly and kneeled next to Malfoy on the floor, " I won't leave you. Not this time."
She hugged Potter tightly as Weasel trotted after her. Draco watched them with crossed arms in front of his chest. Granger and Potter separated and she looked at Draco. For the first time, she smiled, or tried to smile.
Potter told him to get up the stairs.
"Shh." Harry said quietly as he and Malfoy stumbled into the livingroom.
"You're right.", he said and hot dressed. Harry sighed again and lay away the comb.
Draco was still sleeping, but Harry couldn't bear to see him, lying there, his cheeks flushed and his full pink lips slightly parted and his eyelashes fluttering. Harry couldn't bear it. Draco was so
"I know it happened, believe me. But I don't want it to happen anymore."
"Sure."
"Don't you go embarrassing me, Potter." Malfoy said as he got up.
Malfoy opened his eyes in shock and stared at Harry as if he'd never seen him before. Neither of them said a word, Harry just watched Malfoy concerned. Malfoy smiled tiredly and then put his head on Harry's shoulder and grabbed Harry's hand. Harry stared at both their hands lying in his lap, fingers intertwined. He smiled when he heard Malfoy's breathing was more even and calm, what must mean that he was asleep again.
Harry looked at Draco, who was, to Harry's surprise, not on the edge of tears, but red of anger.
Harry finished reading the
Harry smiled. Hermione and the others watched Harry and Draco with curious looks. Seamus and Dean are kind of a couple, they hold hands secretly, but they never came out over the Daily Prophet and never shared open kisses or something. No one apart from their closest friends knew about them. And not even they knew, if it was something serious between the two of them. So even these two were quite interested in Harry and Draco's relationship. Was Harry supposed to use the word now? Anyways, half of the students in the hall were now looking at the seven Gryffindors and the one Slytherin, standing in the doors of the Hall. Harry smiled at Draco encouragingly and Draco smiled back weakly.
"We'll write, mate.", Ron told him, hugging Harry too.
"Neville asked me if we wanted to join them all and come to this new pub that opened somewhere in London. Why don't we go there and maybe at the end of the night you can decide if you think it's a good idea to invite her."
"Morning." Ron said smiling and closed the
"I can imagine. That's the father sense." Hermione said and Harry laughed.
"She dared to tell you that?" Ron said outraged.
"Thanks.", Draco said. Harry nodded.
Another letter. Draco sighed. It was his mother's handwriting on the paper.
"How was the library?" He asked.
"Nothing. I just wanted to tell you something.", Harry answered.
After a while, Neville and Seamus joined them, neither Harry or Ron talked to them. They put on their pyjamas and slipped under their blankets silently. Ron flicked his wand and the lights extinguished. Harry rolled his eyes and tried to sleep.
Draco looked at him. "I'm- I-" He didn't know what to say.
Harry looked around and sat down on a chair close to the door. He grabbed the outdated edition of
"Well... is wasn't a real talk... She said something about me leaving her and then I told her all the reasons why and she laughed and I said there had been a war and she said I'd use the war and /me being the hero/ as an excuse and then she shouted at me and stood up and left.", Harry told her. Hermione sighed.
Potter didn't answer. He looked at Draco, trying to find out if he thought it had been good or bad, but Draco had trained over all the years to never let his feelings be seen in his eyes. So Potter asked, "What do you think about it?"
"In the kitchens? Why?", Hermione wanted to know. Harry shrugged.
The song ended and so did their dance. Everyone cheered and Harry, Ron and Hermione bowed deeply. They laughed and left the stage to make room for the band that that was starting to play music again. Harry, Ron and Hermione hugged each other and Ron gave Hermione a kiss.
When Draco looked at Potter he realized that he had raised his voice unconsciously. He just couldn't help himself. He'd never talked about this before and now all of his bottled-up emotions came out.
Harry shrugged.
"Hello everyone." He said with a happy face and kissed his wife on the cheek.
"Well that was-"
Harry lay his arm around Draco's shoulder. Draco looked at Harry for a second and then he lay his head on Harry's shoulder. Harry smiled happily and hummed a slow song. Draco looked up.
Harry stepped into sight. "Hi."
"The first.", Narcissa repeated smiling, "Not even his friends were here."
"I'm proud of you, Harry." Hagrid said just before the door opened and everyone in the Hall turned their faces to look at them.
"I know, but McGonnagal-"
"Minister, Mr Lucius Malfoy had been a Death Eater, but he didn't have a choice. He was scared and remains until this day." Potter said.
Harry rolled his eyes. "I picked up something at the Ministry. Where's Ron?"
"I'm sorry."
"No, I'm not going to. You have to learn it or some day you will come out of the shower and haven't locked the bathroom door and I will come in and see your dick hanging around," Potter said.
Again, Harry and Ron exchanged confused looks. How did Hermione know about all of this?
"Okay."
"I'm serious too."
God, his mouth. Draco stared at the soft curve of his lips, the way they parted as Potter let out another moan. Potter was so close, Draco  could see it, he could feel it.
Draco opened the door and stepped into the room. He put his broom next to Theo's and his shoes on the mat, then walked into the living room. Draco rolled his eyes when he found Pansy sitting on the couch biting her nails, while Theo stood in the open kitchen waving his wand while cooking.
"Maybe we can meet up later?"
"Anything planned for today?" Harry asked.
"As you know, my parents were killed when I was one year old. Dumbledore decided to bring me to my aunt's and uncle's, where I should be raised with my older cousin Dudley. My aunt Petunia is my mother's sister and she loathed her. You know as well that my mother was muggleborn, so my aunt was a Muggle. She thought of all wizards as freaks.", Harry laughed weakly.
"Well maybe I know that, but he doesn't."
Harry nodded again. "I do. I would do anything to make him happy." Harry was surprised by the words that came out of his mouth, and Narcissa's raised eyebrows told him that she was too.
It was almost two in the morning and they were still sitting at their table in the pub and talked. Harry figured they had a lot of catching up to do for the last years hating each other.
They all sat down on the long black wooden table, Lucius on the head of the desk, Harry next to Draco.
Harry was surprised to see Oliver Wood standing in front of him, waving sheepishly. Ginny left the two boys alone to catch up and talk. After a few minutes Angelina joined them and gave each of them a glass of beer.
"Why exactly do you want an owl all of a sudden?" Hermione asked.
"Fly safe." Harry said, grabbing his broom.
"Harry? Are you alright?" Granger asked.
"And who is the other boy?"
"What's wrong?", Potter asked and sat down next to him. He lay his hand gently on Draco's back.
"What has gotten into you guys?" Dean asked loudly, "He is bothering Harry while he is in the hospital! Look at Ron, for Heaven's sake!"
throught he would sleep next to
"In you dreams...?", he repeated sleepy.
Suddenly the laughter stopped and nobody talked. Draco turned around. The three friends looked at him and he stood up.
As he lay in bed and pulled his blanket to his chin, he heard knocking on his window. Harry sat up and put his glasses back on to find Malfoy's eagle owl sitting outside on the windowsill, a letter in its beak. Harry got up and opened the window, his heart pounding. The scary-looking bird hopped inside. Harry shivered from the cold coming through the window and closed it again as soon as the owl sat on the armrest of his chair. Harry stroked its head and flunked himself onto his bed, ripping the letter open with as much excitement as available in his tired state of mind.
He led Draco through the house.
He packed away the chocolate and set the meal on the table while Harry went to open the door.
by Malfoy being unfriendly? It seemed like Harry was expecting Malfoy to be nice. Harry turned around and wanted to walk away, but before he could take the first step, Malfoy said, "Hey, Potter."
"Thank you.", Draco said and smiled as well.
"She talked to mine too!" Draco said, "She really doesn't want us to educate ourselves."
"Then I think it's good. The most important thing is that you're happy.", she continued and forced a smile.
- he had muscles all over the place. And most importantly, the bulge in his boxers. Draco walked around the bed and lay next to Potter. At a closer look, Draco could see scars everywhere. As many muscles Potter had, as many scars he had too. On his arm was one big pink scar, that looked like it was the freshest of them all. And on his thigh Potter had another big scar. Adding to that, there were many smaller ones on his arms and one on his collar bone.
"If you don't think I'm capable of looking after Potter then just say so," Draco snapped.
"Okay?" He said and shrugged, "I go first?"
"Are you agreeing?" He asked stupidly.
"It's a little bit funny," they sang, "This feeling inside."
"...after he woke up.", she said.
"I think I want to do this more often," Draco said.
Draco breathed heavily and closed the newspaper. This was even worse. When his father would read that Draco
"Out.", Theodore Nott said sternly.
"What was that?", Potter asked smiling. Draco laughed.
"You'll do great." Harry whispered in her ear just before he let go.
He handed Neville a picture of Harry in third year. Neville gave it to Ron and Ron gave it back to Malfoy.
"What?" Malfoy had an oblivious look on his face.
Draco fell silent. He glared at Potter. Have his eyes always been that green? Not that Draco cared, but his eyes were really green. Most people would say it's only green, but Draco would define it as emerald green. Gemstone green. He completely lost himself in Potter's eyes.
Harry was taken aback.
Harry could see even though the room was dark, that Draco smiled. He kneeled down next to Harry's bed.
"Harry?", Ron's voice came from outside the curtains.
"I'm sleeping elsewhere."
"We'll pick you up before we're going to dinner." Ron assured Harry, who smiled thankfully and left the group.
Harry didn't look up. Malfoy shouldn't see him crying.
Draco took a deep breath.
?", Ginny asked.
"Do you really don't know where Draco is?", Harry asked and hoped for a clue.
Again, silence fell over them. Harry wondered what time it was. It must have been after midnight already but he didn't feel tired, he wanted to know what Draco had to say - if he had anything to say.
"Thank you dear, I've been very fine."
Not when Draco felt like his insides were falling apart. Potter couldn't leave him alone with his troubling thoughts and his so uncomfortable room- maybe the room was just uncomfortable when Draco was alone and reminded of all these horrible things he had heard in this room. And maybe... But Draco was thinking too much again. It was easier to think of other things when Potter was around.
"True.", he said, shrugging, and Harry laughed.
"Wow." Draco breathed, "I didn't realize how horrifying all these years must have been for you."
"Harry!" Draco definitely moaned.
The next seconds flew past Draco's eyes. He had blocked Matt's spell, cast one himself, heard someone scream and lowered his wand.
Draco didn't answer. He rolled his eyes and stared into the darkness. Potter's breathing suddenly fastened a bit.
Draco stood in front of his enormous closet but had absolutely no idea what to wear. He didn't want to overdo it, but he also didn't want to look like he didn't care. Draco sighed frustrated and threw the black pullover he was holding back into the closet.
"That is
Draco shook his head. This was a stupid idea. Draco didn't want to be friends with those weirdos. "No I- I just thought I'd sit with you. May I?" Draco asked. Blaise's chin dropped.
"Two, please.", Harry said.
or about the
He didn't want to open the letter, he couldn't take any more. Draco felt his hands shaking. He hoped his mother would be more kind and understanding, she always was.
Malfoy sat down next to him. "Fine," he said and grabbed in the bag. Harry watched the blond boy pull out two chocolate frogs. Malfoy gave Harry one.
McGonagall nodded. "You are a good person, Harry Potter, and I am very proud of you."
"Draco, if you want to eat you can come out." Theo said.
home. According to him, Grimmauld Place is now his home.
Harry didn't hesitate, he walked up to Draco's bed and kissed him. Draco tried to pull away, but Harry pressed him into the pillow.
"May I have this dance, Mr Potter?" He asked.
"Ugh... okay Potter. Weird."
"Potter." Draco
cute!", he said and smiled.
"Thanks," Draco said without looking up and wiped his mouth with the paper towel.
The girl wanted to curse Draco, but Potter ran between them and the charm had hit himself.
Professor Slughorn was already teaching as Harry entered his classroom.
"Stay here for the night. I'll write Draco back tomorrow." Harry said and opened Bond's cage to take out the small water bowl. He had to talk about this with Ron and Hermione first before he answered Malfoy.
"What?" Draco asked but realized what a stupid question that was.
"Lalalala! I'm not hearing you!", Ron sang loudly and pressed his hands even closer to his both ears.
"Hello, Harry." Hagrid said with the proudest smile Harry had ever seen, "Ready?"
"And you know I don't like it when you're shouting or cursing." She added and Draco nodded again wordless, even though he was wondering why she told him this now.
"Everything." Said Hermione.
Draco shot up. The night was still dark, but Potter talked like it was bright day. Draco crawled out of bed and sneaked in the moonlight over to the other boy's bed.
"Just wanted to check if you're still awake."
"Right," Harry said thoughtfully, "I never thought about that."
Draco didn't want to read page 13. He knew that the interview was full of lies and he had hated Skeeter for writing and publishing such things.
Then, he had an idea. Draco grabbed a quill and a piece of parchment that lay on a shelf and he sat down on the floor and started writing.
Draco followed Harry's gaze and his chin dropped as well. "What the-"
Harry had never been in a store like this. It was clean and open and bright. And everywhere shone the name of the store. Ron looked around curiously and Harry and Seamus watched him with a grin. He looked like a little child with bright eyes, wanting to touch everything. An employee came towards them, a beautiful tall and slender man with short brown hair, who moved his body elegantly. He eyed the three young men standing in front of him.
Harry furrowed his brow. "For what?"
And then, the letter burst into flames and vanished. Draco stood there, looking at the spot where the letter had caught fire and breathed heavily. Harry looked at him, unsure of what to say, to do or to think. Suddenly, Draco turned around and opened the door.
"Don't talk like that. Harry is helping." Just as Draco opened his mouth to argue, she added "No more word from you, young man."
"He tried to defend me.", Draco told her shortly and she raised an eyebrow.
"Stupid.", Draco said.
"Want to get breakfast?" Draco asked and Harry nodded.
Harry felt horrible. He was way too tired to argue right now and didn't want to upset Hermione. He stared into his coffee mug and avoided eye contact with Hermione, but Harry could still feel her and Ron looking at him. They sat on a bench in their garden and enjoyed the morning sun.
"That's my bed. Sit down.", Draco said and pointed at the bed closest to the window through which you could see under the surface of the lake.
"Oh Hermione, dear I'm so sorry. I didn't want to snap at you." The woman said suddenly friendly. "Harry. Ron." She greeted them shortly.
At the table where Harry always sat, sat the one person Harry had been looking for. And now when he wanted to be alone, he found him. Malfoy looked up.
Harry turned around to see Neville and Seamus grinning at him.
"And you didn't tell him you weren't joking?" Longbottom asked again. Draco peeked into the common room and saw Potter and Longbottom sit on the couch and talk. No one else was there.
Draco hestitated, then tip-toed to his bed and held up the blankets carefully, so that he didn't wake Potter. He slipped inside and lay on his side too. He pressed his stomach against Potter's back and put his left arm around his waist.
Before Harry even reached them, the front doors of the Manor swung inward and Draco stood behind them. Even though all of the things Harry was feeling inside were nothing to smile about, he couldn't hold one back as he saw Draco standing there looking like he did.
?" she asked.
"How are you?" Harry decided this was a good way to start the conversation.
Harry and Ron laughed, but Malfoy pulled a face.
Potter's panting breath brushed against Draco's neck and Draco increased the suction, making Potter shudder harder. Parting with the delicious skin reluctantly, Draco looked at the darkening bruise on Potter's neck.
Harry felt something inside him cooking up. How was this woman allowed to keep any information to herself? Draco was hurt!
"Great. You understood what I said." Potter answered and clapped "May I continue?"
Harry felt his cheeks redden. Was he just about to get caught in a lie?
Of course they decided to end the round with a question to Harry. Of course.
"And I think yours is just as obvious." Harry answered, his gaze fixed at Malfoy's dark green shirt.
"What's it look like?", Malfoy raised his glass, "I'm drinking." He slurred the words.
"He only ate one bun, how can he be full already?" Luna asked and they all followed Malfoy with their eyes.
"Ron, I don't even know yet, if-"
They all hugged each other, but Harry was uncertain whether to hug Ginny or not. He smiled at her and as she smiled back, he hugged her too.
Draco looked at him. "Watching me watch the movie to make sure I like it."
"How is your little godson doing?" Mrs Malfoy asked while they were eating their desserts. As soon as she had asked the question, Malfoy's eyes shot up and he looked at Harry curiously.
. So get out of my way and stop staring, you look like idiots. And you don't want people to know, right?"
"How are you?"
"Dunno, I still have to talk to Nott about that I mean he's all alone over there without Draco."
"Ready when you are." Malfoy said with a grin as he mounted his broom.
"I know that we had more and more drinks." Malfoy answered.
"You look good, Harry." Seamus said.
"You would?", he asked in disbelief. Harry nodded.
"You know, Potter, you-"
"Didn't I just hear an owl in your room?" Ron asked suspiciously, "Harry, did you get mail?"
, Malfoy! Ever heard of that? You're so stupid it's unbelievable really!"
nice, even after all that we went through. You are the most amazing person I know and I'm not even kidding. I love you. And all I would have to go through is worth it. I would take a thousand Stunning Spells to my chest."
Draco shrugged sheepishly. "I try."
"Sorry." Potter said and pulled out a small grey thing, flipped it open and started talking to it.
"What's wrong, Potter?", Malfoy asked still smirking.
Draco opened the door and stepped into the office. Professor McGonnagal sat on her desk and read over the rim of her small glasses. She looked up and smiled at Draco.
"You're overreacting.", Potter said.
"No. The day after I'd kissed him, I met with Madame Pomfrey and she said I was alright."
"T, Potter. Failed.", Snape said, a mean smile carving his lips.
Harry chuckled. "No, Hermione tell Ron he doesn't have to kick anyone's ass. I'm just calling to tell you that I'm at the hospital with Malfoy."
"Fuck it, Malfoy! I'm going to tell you something right now. I can't stand you! I can't stand your silky hair! I can't stand your stupid smirk when I mess up my potion! I can't stand your cocky attitude whenever you talk to me! I can't stand your beautiful pale sun hostile skin! I can't stand the smell of your damn expensive cologne! I can't stand the feeling that my heart is about to jump out of its place whenever I see you! I can't stand the way you walk! I can't stand anything about you! And I can't fucking stand it, that I like you that much, okay? I hate it!", Harry said loudly and breathed heavily.
"How drunk were you?" He asked laughing.
Harry stuck his head out the door. He didn't quite believe what he had just heard. "I can?" He asked in disbelief.
"How can you like him?" Ron definitely
"You called me Harry.", Potter whispered. Draco smiled.
He cried out of desperation because he didn't know how he should solve this with Draco. Harry cried. He cried a long time.
"Draco wasn't allowed to talk to Dobby until he was seven. Even then, Draco was only allowed to insult him or to throw things at him. This one was taken when Draco was five. He and Dobby used to sit in one corner of the room and talk."
Harry didn't resist as Draco twisted Harry's hands behind his back, crossing his wrists together and holding them tightly.
Draco wanted to unwrap his towel when he heard something. It sounded like someone was moving beneath a blanket. In shock, Draco turned to look at Potter's bed and found the idiot staring at him.
"What is it, Potter?", Draco asked and furrowed his brow.
Draco immediately knew what Harry was talking about, so did the others. Draco grinned even wider and followed Harry upstairs.
"Wow, Harry, what have you done with him?", Finnegan asked.
"But, Mione, you said we're going the library. You wanted to learn, remeber?", he asked confused and Granger crunched her teeth.
"Everything?" Potter asked and Draco nodded agreeing.
Draco laughed and rubbed his eye with the back of his hand. Harry gently leaned his forehead against Draco's and smiled.
"That could be potentially problematic.", Ron said.
And then something inside Harry clicked. Suddenly it all made sense. Harry realized the look in Malfoy's eyes wasn't resentment for Harry - it was for himself. Harry realized the tone in Malfoy's voice wasn't anger - it was frustration and confusion. Harry breathed heavily and Malfoy stopped arguing to breathe as well.
"Don't you go moving more than you should." Harry grinned.
Harry watched him while he scrubbed his back with the soap. Draco smiled into the mirror as he saw Harry watching him and Harry looked away quickly. Draco laughed.
"So looking forward to it.", he said sarcastically. Potter snickered.
"Draco.", Lucius said and Draco could hear a slight friendly tone.
"I-" Draco stopped to take a deep breath, "I don't know."
bullied
Draco didn't answer for a few minutes.
"I knew I didn't see you come with Hermione." Charlie chuckled.
"Thanks, you prat.", Draco said, but laughed.
Harry put on his pyjama and waited on his bed until Malfoy came out. And when he did, he ignored Harry completely. Harry brushed his teeth and lay down. No word came from the other bed. It seemed like the progress they had made over the last few weeks was vanished.
"And I won once but I think it was sheer luck." Hermione said and again everyone laughed.
"We're so sorry, Harry." Hermione said.
On the morning of Ginny's birthday, Mrs Weasley had prepared her favourite breakfast and the whole family sat down to eat. Then Ginny had opened her presents - five in total - and they had all spent the day together. The evening had been just as fun when a lot of Ginny's friends came to celebrate with her. There have been more presents and more food. Heavy hearted, Ron, Harry and Hermione went back home because there wasn't enough space for them to stay another night at The Burrow. It had started to rain again just after the lot went to bed.
"Then what do you suggest?"
"Should I come back later?" He asked and scratched his wrist.
"Yeah."
"Yes?" Malfoy said and stopped with a worried look on his face that made Harry want to hold him and tell him everything was going to be okay.
"I thought it was kind of interesting," he said.
"As always?", the elf asked.
"I'm... I'm sorry.", Draco said and tears streamed down his cheeks. He closed the door behind himself with a lout
Wishing him a good night, Harry watched Ron leave for his dorm room. The thought of Malfoy and Hermione was stuck in Harry's head. It was ridiculous. Why would Malfoy have a crush on Hermione? He can't stand her.
It would be the easiest if Draco would just stay away from them until their coming-out cooled down a bit.
Hermione watched Harry picking at his food during breakfast. Also Ron noticed that something was wrong. Harry hadn't said a word since he'd come downstairs and he had only taken a bite off his sausage. Finally, he lifted his head to look at his friends.
Harry dropped the soap as the thought ran thought his head. Malfoy had been into it just as much as Harry was. Maybe Malfoy had enjoyed kissing Harry, but just freaked out. That would seem reasonable for Harry, considering how Malfoy had been raised like Hermione had said. Harry shook his head and stepped out of the shower. Harry shouldn't be thinking about this right now, he should focus on his birthday. Ron and Hermione have rented a pub and invited Harry's friends, the rest was a surprise. He wrapped himself into a towel, hurried through the corridor to his room and dressed himself.
"It was a ling time ago." He said.
"You want your Mark tattooed?" He asked in such disbelief that Draco had to grin.
The room was quite cosy. The two beds were opposite of each other, next to each of them was a shelf for their books and a closet. The bathroom was small, compared to the bathroom Harry had used the six years before. There was a shower, a sink and a toilet, that was it. Harry liked their room pretty much, apart from sharing it with Draco sodding Malfoy.
Hermione just threw him a meaningful look, Harry rolled his eyes and both of them sat down and pretended their talk had never happened. Wordlessly, they started eating and everything that was heard was silent chewing and the sound of fork meeting plate.
"I know what this is." She started whining again and Ron rolled his eyes. "It's a brand new edition from
Harry felt really uncomfortable. He wanted to do something with Malfoy but Ron and Hermione wouldn't understand if he would let them down. To Harry's luck, Malfoy had an excuse at the ready.
She sat there with her mouth wide open and a disbelieving look on her face and stared at Harry. Ron and Harry shot themselves a look, which said
Today was the day of the trial. When Draco got up, he had a strange feeling in his stomach. Something was going to happen that day, but he didn't know what and he didn't care to find out. All he wanted was to survive another day and get another day closer to Hogwarts, closer to seeing Potter again. Draco didn't know why he was so desperate to see the idiot again, but somehow Draco missed Potter's green eyes that looked like a toad and his stupid, stupid scar.
hit me with the Killing Curse."
Malfoy didn't answer right away and Harry shifted on his stool uncomfortably.
He found his room deserted, but the shower was running. Harry smirked and slipped out of his clothes. Naked, he opened the door to the bathroom and stepped in.
"Escaped?", Hermione asked curiously.
Mr Malfoy sat in a black armchair and held a glass of red wine in his right hand. Mrs Malfoy stood in front of him and looked at her husband with a stern look.
Harry looked at Ron. He never loathed Ron more than in this moment, and Harry hated himself for that.
Everyone laughed and nodded.
"Mr Harry Potter, you know Lucius Malfoy?" The minister asked and Potter nodded.
After kissing Hermione on the forehead, Ron followed Harry and made their way through the crowd. A lot of people came up to them not to talk, but only to touch Harry, to shake his hand and then run off again.
Draco laughed. Pansy was his best friend and he could tell her everything, but telling her about him and Potter was not the best idea.
"Malfoy!", Granger shouted and he stooped.
"Noo, don't be grumpy," Potter said laughing and touched Draco's shoulder.
"Potter."
He took a deep breath and opened the letter.
"Don't be sorry for everything. I'm an asshole and you know it, so don't be sorry for me doing shit!"
Draco laughed.
"Tell the truth.", he said.
Parkinson, Crabbe, Goyle and Harry looked at Draco, no one said anything. Draco looked at them.
Harry put his pyjama on the cupboard and took his clothes out of Malfoy's hands. Harry stepped closer. He couldn't believe what was about to happen, but he felt strong and confident. He wanted to make Draco feel as safe as he did, so he cupped Draco's face with both his hands and smiled. Malfoy's eyes fluttered shut as Harry bent closer and kissed him. Sparks flew inside his stomach and his lips felt electrified. The kiss got very intense very quickly. Harry had to catch a breath every now and then, but Draco almost wouldn't let him. They stumbled towards the door and Harry felt something in his pants when Draco pinned him against the door and pushed against him with his body.
"I'm not going to answer, you arse.", he said, looking at Draco, who shrugged.
Weasley and Granger fell asleep first and Draco and Potter looked at them with a grin. Potter slid closer to Draco and smiled.
Harry thought he must be dreaming. Malfoy looked... hot. His pale skin looked even paler and his hair looked even shinier in the light that came out of the bathroom. Malfoy had wrapped a towel around his waist and wore nothing else. A strand of wet hair fell into his face. His arms were as skinny as they were muscular. It was kind of weird. Malfoy's arms and his body looked like he was working out but at the same time he was still slim. Harry thought he noticed a slight sixpack on his belly, but it must have been the light. But what Harry definitely noticed was the V-line. These damn hot muscles Malfoy had on his lower abs that were visible over his towel. In a soft movement Malfoy brushed the strand of hair out of his face with his long fingers. Harry thought he was going to faint.
Harry rolled onto his back and slowly opened his eyes. The room was still dark. He put his arm on the pillow beside him. Then, nervously, Harry's eyes widened and he felt the bed. Malfoy wasn't there! Harry sat up quickly and groped for his glasses. /Where was he?/, Harry wondered. He got up and snuck downstairs, trying not to wake Ron. Harry rolled his eyes. They have forgotten to turn off the kitchen light before they have gotten to bed. But before Harry could round the corner to the kitchen, he heard Ron laugh. Harry didn't want to eavesdrop, but if Ron was laughing in the middle of the night in the kitchen, Harry had a right to know why.
"Good." Zabini said nodding to himself, "Good."
Half asleep, Draco answered: "Black haired."
The next message was sent from Harry at nearly midnight.
"Whoa Malfoy what the hell?" Harry heard Dean shouting through the room.
"That's mine.", he whispered.
"Amazing," Harry said when Malfoy turned around after he had finished.
"Oh come on. You really try to get us back together?", he asked and Hermione shrugged.
"He invited me to come to Malfoy Manor after the year.", Harry told Ron.
"I won't let you eat alone.", he said.
They just walked side by side without saying a word and without looking at each other. Harry tried to say something, but it came nothing but hot air. Just before they reached the next classroom, Ron turned to Harry.
"Yeah, you know what, Mione? I'm waiting outside.", he said.
"He gave it to me because he wanted me to call him." Harry explained shortly.
Draco left them alone with Potter. He had a feeling that couldn't mean good.
Ron laughed impressed. "Nice choice."
"Good.", Harry smiled and they went up to Ron's room, which he had to share with an annoying Hufflepuff who desperately wanted to be Ron's friend so he could hang out with Harry and who gave Ron cookies every morning and Ron actually liked him a bit, but only because of the cookies.
It just made Draco feel worse. Potter didn't even know how wrong he was to claim he wanted this.
Draco thought about telling him, he really did. But then Draco remembered that Blaise wasn't talking to him these days and Draco was afraid of telling Blaise something that Blaise would tell his new friends.
"Even Weaselette?", Draco asked.
"This-" Potter started, but didn't finish.
"Okay." Nott said nodding, but Harry saw that he was grinning.
"Someone hit a curse at me and I can't talk out loud. Whenever I try to say a word, my throat gets tied and I can't breathe.", he explained.
"Alright." Ron said, his expression changing, "What's for breakfast?"
Draco felt a horrible pain in his chest. He was going to leave his mother alone for the next few months. She didn't have her husband, she didn't have her sister, she didn't have her son.
"I want to ask your permission for Potter to marry me."
"I won't. I want you to know I know I made a mistake, but I won't ruin anything for him."
"Okay.", he said and scratched the back of his hand.
"But I also think you are right to worry about you two fighting." Hermione pulled Harry out of his thoughts, "Given your history I mean."
"Hermione, are you okay?" He asked and took her hands.
"Ah, yes. You and that stupid red-haired bitch.", Draco answered. Harry rolled his eyes.
Draco bent down to kiss Potter.
Theo left again, closing the door behind himself. Draco could hear him and Blaise talking in the living room. He stared at the black cashmere pullover and then finally decided to just put it on. Looking at himself in the mirror, Draco picked at the pullover - he didn't know if he liked it. He put on a shining silver watch, what made the outfit look a little better.
"Calm down, father.", he said.
"He is," Harry answered shortly.
"I would like that, yes. But I think it would be best if I had only a couple of days, so the others can spend time with him as well," Draco said and was surprised he actually thought of what the lunatics wanted.
"We're no family members." Zabini said mockingly.
"Hey, Harry", Neville pulled Harry out of his thoughts.
"You think I follow your orders?"
"Harry, I... sorry. I didn't know. I just thought... Who else then?", Hermione asked more carefully. Harry sighed.
"I can do that, Potty."
hot right now."
"Thank you- uhm... Harry." Narcissa said.
"Students aren't allowed to go here."
"How are you feeling today, Mr. Potter?" Was one of them. Draco laughed. This little kid behaved like he was an actual adult interviewer, even though he was barely in his fifth year.
"If you keep doing that it will get hotter with every time the spell fades." Theo pointed out.
Harry looked at Hermione as she said it. She had got a point. What about Ginny? It would be weird having her there after their last encounter, but simply not inviting her seemed rude.
"Potter.", Malfoy said and he sounded apologizing. Why didn't he stop torturing Harry and just say no?
This was ridiculous. Draco pulled out his wand and cast his third cooling spell on himself. Usually it works perfectly, but in this heat it lasts for about fifteen minutes and then slowly disappears again.
"That's a horrible shouting and insulting portrait of Mrs Black. We can't remove it because of a sticking charm, so she has to stay.", Potter explained and shrugged.
"Goodnight.", he said and closed the door behind him. Draco looked at his friends.
Harry felt like he had just been slapped in the face. "Malfoy-" he started, but Malfoy cut him off.
"HE'S MY
"Shut it, Malfoy." Harry snapped.
Draco's arms were still wrapped around Potter, holding him close in a firm embrace. Too damn close, which meant Potter had little room for movement. It could have been dealt with easily.
Just like now.
an excu-" the minister didn't came any further, because Potter held up his hand to quiet him.
"Malfoy!" Shouted someone else, followed by a knock on his door.
Harry nodded. Malfoy sighed and ran his fingers through his hair. Sadness rushed through Harry. He could understand that Malfoy didn't want to be seen, but he should know that no one in this house would judge him. But before Harry could say anything, Malfoy opened his mouth to say something. He looked at Harry again and bit his lower lip. Harry drew a sharp breath.
"Sorry about Ron." Harry said carefully.
At first Draco had thought it would have been the alcohol inside of them speaking, but when he had written that letter to Potter if they would meet again, he'd been quite sober. And Draco thought about how hurt Potter had looked when Draco had told him he only wanted to give him back his jacket even though he
"Will you, Harry?", Hermione asked again.
Harry rolled his eyes. "No, dimwit. Here. With everyone."
Another knock on his door.
Draco nodded.
And what was most exhausting was that Draco couldn't even talk to anyone about it. He could most definitely
"Everything.", Ron
"Why not?"
"Ah,right. She was nice and sweet and pretty but not the right one.", he told himself.
"And besides" Harry added while stirring, "With Mac and Cheese you don't have to do a lot."
"And you're my boyfriend in the hospital." Harry argued.
"You're in love with me?", Harry asked and Draco's jaw dropped a bit.
Since when he was a child, his father told him everything Draco had to do and to think. He never created his own opinions and right now, Draco thought his father might wanted him to stay in his damn bed the whole day and sigh but don't cry because crying was for babies, but his father definitely wouldn't want him to go and talk to Potter.
"Um... good.", Ron said, but didn't sound very convinced.
Ron and Hermione sat with Neville and Luna and, to Harry's bad luck, Ginny. He had managed it to avoid her for the last week, but now it was impossible, because he wanted to sit with his friends.
He put his arm around Harry's waist and wanted to walk away, but the people around them gasped as Kyle fought himself free and came after the two boys again, his wand raised. Malfoy turned around and punched him in the face, making him fall and land on his back. Kyle's nose was bleeding, but Draco didn't pay any attention to that. He punched him in the face again and again, then got up.
"You look like a picture-perfect family right now." Ginny answered instead of Hermione.
Harry rolled his eyes. He watched the healer exchanging the pillow behind Draco's head with a swish of her wand. She left the two alone and closed the door behind herself. Harry stepped closer and took Draco's hand and this time he squeezed back.
"I know, but I want to," Harry said smiling, even though he knew Malfoy didn't see it. But he then opened his eyes.
"May I ask", Seamus said, "Who said "I love you" first?"
"Thank you." Harry said.
Draco kissed him even more and pulled himself against Potter. Draco wanted to feel as much of Potter as he could get.
or anything like that. I do not want to be cute" Malfoy stated clearly and Harry nodded.
"Malfoy." Harry whispered and carefully shook Malfoy's shoulder.
Draco didn't know the owl that was knocking with its beak against his window. He opened it and the owl gently hootet and held out its foot where a letter was attached. Draco immediately suspected it was from Potter. And when he read it, he found that he was right. Potter had written that Draco could come over after six p.m. and he had left an address. Draco didn't think he had to write back. He got the message and would do as he was told, even though it wasn't really his way.
Draco finally stood up, walked to his closet and opened it. Beneath his underwear, he took out a second floor and took out a black box. The box with newspapers.
"What?", Harry asked.
"I  actually like to sleep with Parvati," Hermione said and suddenly, Ron and Harry burst out laughing. "In one room!" She added annoyed, but that didn't keep Ron and Harry shut.
"Uh, yes." Harry answered a bit startled by the sudden conversation, "Draco Malfoy is visiting his mother."
"Well, Hermione, I go to see Draco. I haven't seen him since he escaped this morning.", Harry said and smiled.
"Noo! Potter, you idiot! Now I'm wet!", he whined.
"Mr. Potter?"
"I need to go now.", he said and stood up.
They didn't say anything and Draco walked up to his own room, opposite of Potter's.
"Now that you are here, obviously not.", Draco answered, rolling his eyes.
Draco laughed.
"Oh believe me, I can." With these words Potter tucked the wand away and went inside again.
Draco just couldn't believe what came out of Potter's mouth. He switched the light on his bedside table on and looked at Potter.
Reaching the bar, Harry ordered drinks for everyone and as he fumbled for money in his pocket the blonde bartender grabbed his hand.
"But, of course, as you are his friends, you can come and visit him as well... one time."
After a long staring contest, Harry said, "Anyways, I'm really sorry and I just want you to feel better again and I hope you can forgive me and maybe trust me again."
"I don't think I have to ask what your favorite colour is, do I?" Malfoy said, nodding towards Harry's red T-shirt.
"I guess." Ron said and looked at Hermione, who smiled lightly.
"What's wrong, mate?" Ron asked, taking off his shoes and sitting down on the other side of Harry.
Malfoy shrugged. "Not long."
"My sister knows you." The boy kept talking, "She was at Hogwarts with you, one year beneath you."
He and Dean were the perfect entertainers. The whole crowd laughed and shouted names of teachers. The first thought that came into Harry's mind was Snape, but it would be really disrespectful to say something like that - also in front of Malfoy.
"Ron, let me explain.", Harry said nervously. Draco stepped closer to him again and Harry felt brave again.
Harry knew exactly that Malfoy thought these sweaters were ugly and he hated it when Harry wore them, but Harry appreciated the lie. When Ron opened his present from Hermione, he almost broke into tears, what was very uncommon for him. He hugged her and plastered kisses all over her face. Hermione grinned and shoved him away. Draco and Harry have decided beforehand not to buy each other things, but neither of them held their promise.
Harry shrugged, trying not to think of Malfoy.
So Harry told him how they went into Honeydukes and drank hot chocolate.
"Sounds perfect," Malfoy corrected and lay back down.
Harry smirked, took the money and gave both of the cups to Draco. Draco thanked him smiling and walked over to where little Scorpius sat. Draco gave Scorpius his cup and as he placed it in front of his son, he noticed, that today there stood something different. Draco took it and looked at the black, nice handwriting. "Cutest little boy on earth" it said. Draco smiled and placed the cup back in front of Scorpius. Then, Draco looked at his own and his heart jumped. "Cutest man on earth." He smiled like an idiot and started drinking.
"We'll see you!", Hermione said loudly as they stepped out in the darkness. Harry and Draco waved after them- mostly it was Harry who waved- and then closed the door.
"Of course I can," Luna said delightfully. She left in the opposite direction Ron had gone.
"Get away from me!" Ron said and slapped Malfoy's hand away.
"I... okay.", he stammered.
"I...", he started. Hermione's eyes widened and she looked like she'd burst if Harry wouldn't tell her now.
"Don't. Please." Harry said quietly.
"That's a bit complicated to explain. Are you sure you'll understand it?", he asked and Draco nodded hastily. Harry smiled.
"Maybe he's not as bad as you think he is." Hermione said and Ron and Harry looked at her in disbelief.
"What? Oh, no." Hermione kneeled down before the trunk and started to search for something.
"The one with your dad.", Potter said.
"Don't say
Draco nodded. "Exactly. And that cost you so much."
Draco sighed. "Okay, then what are you worried about?"
Harry was a bit startled. He didn't expect that he should go in and search for clothes. And quite frankly he'd rather have Nott do that, because if Harry went in without Malfoy's permission he could get into a lot of trouble.
"You-", he said and walked towards Harry. Harry took a step back.
"Boyfriend." Draco finished Harry's sentence, "I'm his boyfriend."
It was late after bedtime, but Draco simply couldn't sleep. The sky was pitch black and everyone in the castle was probably already sleeping.
"But don't mention it if you're not going to tell me." Draco rolled his eyes.
"Well, follow me then.", Narcissa said smiling.
"Yeah. Looking good, Greg.", Draco said laughing. Gregory smiled weakly.
"Yes, yes. The Slytherin folk.", Hermione said and rolled her eyes.
"Can I come in?"
Theodore just didn't like mudbloods and that was reason enough for him.
Harry grinned. "Malfoy, we said
They lay in Harry's bed the whole day. Owls arrived and brought birthday wishes from Hermione, Ron and the other Weasleys, from Sirius and Remus, from Hagrid, Seamus and Dean, and from Neville.
Harry looked at Draco through narrowed eyes. Did he just say he would help Ron? Voluntarily? That meant Harry hadn't dreamed about them eating pie together in the middle of the night... Harry watched the two of them disappear into the kitchen and furrowed his brow. He sneaked closer to listen even though he felt kind of bad to spy on his friends like this.
Malfoy nodded and Harry could see he was sorry. "I feel stupid."
quite a massive jerk." Harry said with a soft chuckle.
Everyone laughed at that.
" The man answered.
"Yes, in fact you could clean the kitchen," Harry said.
"Only one.", Potter answered.
The air outside was way colder than inside and it took Harry a second to get used to it. It wasn't very windy, but still chilly. Malfoy pulled out a pack of cigarettes from his pocket, just like Harry suspected. The blonde took out his wand and lit his cigarette and put his wand away again. Malfoy held the cigarette elegantly between his fingers. Harry watched him suck at the cigarette with his rosy pink lips and gently blow the smoke into the night.
"What did you just say?" Draco asked even though he clearly understood him.
"Get out of the way," she ordered and the staring people made room for her to get to the inner circle where Draco kneeled on the floor, his hands behind Potter's head.
"None of your damn business." Malfoy said aggressively.
"I'm sorry.", Harry answered.
"Goodbye father.", Draco said and nodded to his father.
"Harry!" Mr Weasley said with a surprised, but smiling face.
stupid. Well, obviously he was.
"Oh.", Draco said and grabbed his fresh clothes.
"You're falling in love, aren't you?" She said, with a smug smile.
Potter smiled at Draco, who have Petunia and Vernon his hand.
"How are you, Harry?", Hermione asked smiling. Then, she looked behind Harry and the smile vanished.
when he was going to talk to Potter later. So Draco opened his closet and leaned back a bit so he could see everything with one look.
Draco pressed his lips together. That little bastard. He was referring to the fact that Draco was going to join his father in Azkaban for three years if he would attack the great Harry Potter. But no one in the whole train apart from him and Potter knew.
"Go on, then. Get dressed and get back in your own bed.", Draco said and smiled. Harry nodded and pulled up his pyjama bottoms and walked over to his bed.
With that, Malfoy left the room. Harry furrowed his brow. Has he said something wrong? With Malfoy it was always a rollercoaster - up and down and up and down. Even though Harry didn't know what Malfoy's problem was, he tried not to find out and be calm. But then Harry realized that Malfoy had never told him who the letters were from and what they had written.
was what Harry had meant by a "big ceremony".
Hermione nodded, so did Ron.
"You know what? I'm hungry.", Draco said. Potter looked at him questioning.
Draco laughed against Harry's neck and kissed him.
"This suits you." Harry said, licking his dry lips.
"What? No, no, we have to be sorry. If you want to surprise us, it's okay. Totally fine by me.", Hermione said smiling. Ron nodded.
"Every time again." Narcissa answered.
"I don't know what I'm doing here. I just wanted to see you after what I said and then I thought I shouldn't go, because of your father, but I already stood in the middle of the hallway, so I decided to walk back and as soon as I had closed the door, I wanted to check if you were alright, so I went back and- you were no pants. Are you aware of that?"
Mrs Weasley wasn't impressed by the suggestion, but her children were. They made teams over the pudding and after dinner, they all ran outside to get their brooms.
"Ah.", Seamus replied and turned back to Dean, who smiled at him and took his hand.
"Look at this!" Harry came into the living room, waving the
"Draco.", he mumbled against Draco's lips.
"I guess I'm just used to doing it myself." Harry shrugged.
Harry looked at Nott and slowly nodded. He didn't either...
"Why?", he asked.
This was tiring. Trying to figure out what Malfoy was wanting to say was really tiring.
But Harry grabbed a piece of paper and scribbled on it:
"What is
"Potter-"
"Yeah." He replied even though he was not really agreeing with what his mother had said.
"Fine.", Draco said and tried to roll over to leave.
"Dear mother.
"You can never be too careful."
"Nothing." Harry lied quickly and Hermione's smile widened.
"A corporal and a non-corporal one." Malfoy nodded understanding.
"After Mrs Black had died, the house was empty for many years. Before it was used as Headquarters for the Order, no one else was there, except Kreacher the house elf and this horrible portrait.", Potter told him.
Hermione answered after a few seconds "
Indeed, Draco recognised her face again. She was so young. And his aunt. Draco somehow missed her.
Draco smiled too and pulled his arm around Potter's shoulder as Potter flipped the page.
He opened the door and stepped inside. On the bed sat a boy. He was less fat than he had been when Potter was eleven years old and wore the same horrified look as his parents.
Harry smiled thanking and sat opposite of Hermione next to Draco.
Harry's insides rumbled and he had this strange feeling in his chest. It was only a name, why was he so happy? And suddenly, Harry couldn't stop saying his name.
Everyone, even Harry, put down their cutlery.
"Now, Harry, who said
When he pulled away, he smiled, a smile that made his eyes lighten up and Draco fell safe. Safe and loved.
George and Ron ignored them and pulled a second cracker, that exploded in a purple smoke.
"I was thinking about tomorrow." He lied quickly and suddenly he was really worried. "What do you think they are going to do with the rooms? And the houses? I mean most of the Slytherins don't come back." He asked Pansy.
?" He asked.
"What?" He asked.
"I never said anything about Malfoy." She said and winked at Harry.
He was annoyed by their constant complaints and made his way back to his room to check if Malfoy was there.
"You won't wait outside. You will go down and behave like nothing happened. You won't tell my father. You won't tell my mother. You won't tell Pansy. Nothing like this ever happened. And you will make sure no one comes in.", Draco said, his voice sounded hypnotising.
Draco's eyes met Potter's and Draco leaned forward gently capturing Potter's lips in his own. He nibbled at Potter's lips, and twirled his tongue against Potter's as their mouths opened.
Hermione smiled at them and then, Ginny, Luna and Neville came.
"Your hair is the sexiest thing on earth."
"Yes, we are going to Malfoy Manor tomorrow. We'll have breakfast and by twelve o'clock we shall be there.", he answered to her question.
"Would I be me if I wouldn't?"
"Sure, I'll ask Malfoy if he has any plans already. If he does, he'll just have to cancel."
Draco had to hold back a smile. On the one hand it was sweet that Potter cared that much, but on the other hand WHAT THE FUCK? THAT'S NONE OF HIS BUSINESS!!!!
They said goodbye to Ginny and Fred and hurried out of the store before even more people could come up to Harry. This life was exhausting. Flattering, but exhausting.
"No, of course not. Remember, people will talk? I said it was uncomfortable to be with all of them again after all that's happened."
That sat in awkward silence and sipped at their hot drinks. Harry looked around every now and then and watched the people coming and leaving.
"My dick doesn't stop working just because I have to share a room with you."
"I mean, I just thought you'd like to try it. If you've never... with anyone else... I don't know."
Harry woke up when he felt Malfoy twitching next to him. The floor was still dark and the other hospital visitors were still sleeping. Harry figured Malfoy must have a nightmare, because his lips and upper body were twitching and he had a frightened look on his face, but his eyes were still closed.
"I'll go and find Granger. You guys get along without me?" She asked.
"You know why Malfoy isn't in Azkaban?" Harry asked, but Ron shook his head.
Draco opened the door to their room carefully. He looked inside and stepped in. Potter lay on his side, his back to Draco.
to have my own owl. Like Hedwig."
Sitting back on his knees and licking his lips, Potter palmed his own erection through his jeans.
To his surprise, Longbottom pulled out the letter Draco had written but not sent yet. He gave it to Looney Lovegood, who passed it around. When the letter reached Granger, the others watched her closely. It seemed like her word was the final one. If she decided Draco wasn't worth it, he wasn't worth it. So Draco hoped she would be kind. He didn't quite know
friends, I know how to talk to them.", said Draco.
Down in the Great Hall all of his friends were already eating. "Where have you been?" Hermione asked with her usual worried look. Harry only waved the question away and sat down. He piled food on his plate, started eating and listened to the talk of his friends.
Harry hadn't realized that Hermione had stopped watering. She looked down at him and smiled.
" She explained.
awkward. The five of them sat there, looking at each other, and no one knew what to say. It was new for all of them, that Harry and Draco sat next to each other and didn't fight, swear or kill each other. The moment took so long, until the portrait hole opened and Dean stepped back in, followed by Seamus.
"Are you still drunk?" Malfoy asked and Harry laughed.
you," he said sternly.
"What do you want, idiot? Use words." Malfoy rolled his eyes and looked down on himself as well to see if he found something.
"He said he'll go! He said he'll go!", Harry sung.
"What a day!" Ron said on their way upstairs to their rooms.
Malfoy's lip twitched. And finally after so many years, Harry saw him smile. It was gone as fast as it had appeared, but it was progress.
Potter took a deep breath.
"Hi Harry."
Vernon laughed.
Harry searched for a black boxershort in his drawer and pulled it out, but Draco looked like he waited for something else.
"P-", Draco attempted to speak Harry's name, but Harry have him no chance. He kept kissing Draco, wrapped his tongue around Draco's and thrust his fingers in Draco's hair.
Finally, Harry have him free, but rested his head only inches away from Draco's face, his fingers still in his hair.
Harry nodded. "In this heat the two don't bother to get outside."
Harry stood in the shower, cold water running down his back. He couldn't help but think about Malfoy's face when he'd stormed out of Harry's house - the image was for ever going to be burned into Harry's mind. Harry thought it was such a shame they have wasted years of hating each other when instead they could have been friends. Turned out they really could get along. They have just started becoming friends and then this stupid thing happened. How did this happen? How could Harry think it was the right thing to do?
She brought two Oreos to the boys on the couch. Harry thanked her and took a bite while Malfoy watched him curiously. Harry could see that he was a bit overwhelmed by Hermione auddnely being nice to him. Maybe he didn't quite process the trauma of her hitting him in the face in third year.
Draco nodded. Harry could see that he was uncomfortable and ashamed, but he needed to tell him.
Malfoy glared at Harry with his intensely grey eyes. Harry smiled gently. As Harry lightly put his hand on Malfoy's, Malfoy let go of his glass and grabbed Harry's hand.
Harry didn't quite know what to answer, after all, Ron was right. Harry really had been sure about Malfoy being a Death Eater and in the end Harry found it to be true, but he completely forgot about that and he didn't like Ron reminding him of it.
"So, Granger, Weasel. It was nice to see you... somehow.", Draco said as they stood at the front door. To Harry's delight, Hermione forced a smile.
"Don't try to act tough," Draco said, "I don't see any of your friends here."
"Sleep well, Lucius.", she said, but her voice didn't sound kind, it sounded dangerous.
He turned to look at Harry and Hermione, who both sat there with shocked looks on their faces.
"Are you okay? Don't move, what are you doing?"
"I need a cup of tea.", she said slowly.
"When it comes from your mummy you can," Potter mocked him.
Draco read the letter again. His father had a very intense use of words and it made Draco feel like a child again - a child that didn't know what to do and everything father said was right. Draco didn't want to be this child anymore, but he couldn't help it. What was he going to do now?
They sat down on the table, next to the other Gryffindors. Where was Draco? Had it something to do with bus friends? What did they talk about? Was Draco just too proud to tell Harry and to ask him for help? Harry sighed, what caught Ginny's attention.
The children looked at each other with scared faces.
"You're really enjoying yourself right now, aren't you?" Potter said and rolled his eyes.
"Potter-" Malfoy started.
"You go." Zabini said, "I see him more than enough."
"HOW DARE YOU? HOW CAN YOU FALL INTO MY BACK JUST LIKE THIS? DON'T YOU UNDERTAND WHAT THE CIRCUMSTANCES ARE? DRACO LUCIUS MALFOY, YOU WILL PAY FOR THIS!"
Harry got so distracted from Draco's smile, he stood on his foot again.
Hermione rolled her eyes and pulled out her wand. Two spells later the drawer opened. Harry smiled and hugged Hermione.
"I'm fine, Draco.", Blaise answered.
"What are you idiots up to?" Draco asked and noticed the stupid red-head rolling his eyes.
As they lay in bed, Harry had an idea.
"I'll take a shower and go right to bed." Ron said and yawned widely.
"Are you going to tell your father?", Harry asked and immediately could have slapped himself.
"Me and Harry will go to this shop... You know, the one with the...", Hermione waved with her hands on the air and Ron raised a questioning eyebrow. Harry snickered.
"Oh, he's doing great, thanks. He's such a sweet guy, I love him so much." Harry answered and smiled.
He grabbed his bag and quickly left the dungeons. He had missed Transfiguration, so Harry hurried to greenhouse two, where his class already waited. Professor Sprout came just right after him.
"That's why you're going home so early?" Harry asked.
"It goes like this the whole day!" Ron said as soon as Harry had closed the door behind himself.
"Three." Answered all four of them and Potter pressed the button with the number "3" and the one with "10".
"Ah, twenty-four hours a day. Great! You never said this to me!"
"To talking to you."
Arousal shot through Harry like wildfire, sending blood to his spent cock, he was trapped in Draco's arms with Draco's scowling face in front of him and nothing about it seemed perilous or wrong. He was surprised to realise that if Draco decided to pull him back down beneath the covers, Harry would have let him do whatever he wished.
Harry nodded smiling. "I think so."
"You were rude earlier today. This rude.", Potter grinned as his hands slid lower, fingers grazing the skin between Draco's arse cheeks.
"So, my dears." Mrs Weasley said after she put the pot on the table and hugged everyone.
Draco had told Potter everything, but this was too much. And Draco wasn't even sure now, so making himself and Potter false hope was only not fair. He closed his eyes amd hoped that he would sleep quickly. And he did.
Harry could see how bad Malfoy felt in this moment. "No, Malfoy, this is
Hermione and Ron came after him, and they walked back to their common room.
"So, tell us what happened." Theo said as Draco joined him and Pansy at the table.
Draco let himself fall down on his bed. He sighed and thought about the day before. It had been nice walking around Diagon Alley, they had even stopped by Knockturn Alley, but most of the shops have been shut down.
Draco nodded and held out his arm. He pulled up the sleeve and Theo widened his eyes even more.
"I know, I know," Ron answered, rolling his eyes.
"Right. This was the first time we ever had close contact with each other." Malfoy said and looked at his wrists, where the two red stains were still visible.
"You're not cooking with magic?" Malfoy asked surprised when Harry didn't leave the stove immediately.
"Dunno." And so did Malfoy.
"I have absolutely no idea. He's a prick, you know that." Harry said.
"I've known Lucius Malfoy for a long time now. I've got to know him in my second year, when he locked Hogarts' gamekeeper Rubeus Hagrid up in Azkaban. When I was there when Voldemort returned, Mr Malfoy was there as well. He told his Lord that he had always been faithful and loyal and did anything to find out about his whereabouts."
"What for?", Draco asked and pulled out his shoes.
"Sea horses!" They both said at the same time.
, Harry told himself,
An owl scratched at the window. Potter and Draco looked at the window and Potter walked over.
"It means that he's getting better.", she said.
As always, Draco stood in the middle of the party, surrounded by people, not talking to anyone, cluthing the drink in his hand. He checked his watched every now and then only to find that several minutes have passed. Draco rolled his eyes. He needed to mingle. So he walked around and started talking to people he barely know until he found Flint, the former Slytherin Quidditch Captain. They talked for quite a while and Draco even forgot to look at the time. Then suddenly, the entire room - and it was a really big one - fell silent. Draco looked around confused. What-
Potter furrowed his brow. "I had to be strong?!" It sounded more like a question than like a statement.
"You had to be strong for so long and now it's my turn to be there for you." Draco said softly.
Malfoy's lips actually twitched a bit and Harry's heart fluttered.
"About the ball...", he said, driving Harry mad with his slow and calm voice.
But Harry and Draco shook their heads. This wasn't the time to hold hands. Besides, Malfoy had never been a fan of display of affection - if it was in public or in private. But Harry was fine with that. He knew Draco loved him and Draco knew it too.
"Harry, what's wrong?"
"Thanks." Malfoy said.
"That's all you have to say?" Harry screamed with all the air in his lungs.
He headed back to his room, which was empty as it had been before. Also Draco's bed was still untouched. Harry walked over to this bed and smelled. He inhaled the wonderful smell and smiled. It almost felt like Draco was there. But Harry knew he wasn't.
"McGonnagal said she had to think about it for a bit but she said she will leave it there for sure." Harry answered.
As Harry shivered and pulled the sleeves of his pullover down to his fingertips, Malfoy stepped closer. Harry didn't really know what to do, so he didn't move and let Malfoy do whatever he wanted to do. Which was putting his arm around Harry's shoulders and rubbing his shoulder so that he wouldn't freeze anymore. Harry smiled and leaned his head against Malfoy's shoulder that was just a little higher than his own. Harry had never realized that Malfoy was taller than him.
Harry groaned annoyed, grabbed his bag and left the classroom. Hermione and Ron waited in front of the door for him.
"Goodbye, son.", he answered nodding.
The witch flung her arms around his neck and pulled his head close, but Draco held it back. His neck started to hurt as she pulled his head in her direction and he tried to force it in the other.
"Alright then, let's go to Diagon Alley." Ron said, "Again."
Theo clapped Draco on his shoulder.
This was about Harry Potter who loved Hogwarts and who loved his friends and family. Draco lay the newspaper away and took out the last one. He stared at the headline for a few seconds.
"Night, Potter.", he said.
Before they all left, Hermione gave Harry a hug and smiled. "See you later," Harry said. She nodded and left with the others.
"I'll leave first," Draco said.
Harry stood up and walked into the bathroom. Draco stood in front of the mirror and combed his silky hair. Harry smiled as Draco groaned because one strand of hair fell down repeatedly.
When Malfoy still looked lost, Harry explained what movies were and who James Bond was.
"I did, but I wanted to grab some papers for at home." Harry said and pointed at his bag.
Harry was overwhelmed with feelings. He didn't know whether to cry or to laugh, but he wanted to do both.
Neville was shocked. He gasped and clapped his hands. Harry felt his cheeks redden. He was really happy he had someone to talk to about this, someone who wasn't going to tell anyone and especially someone who was this excited to hear about it.
"Who said it first? Just answer it.", Dean said.
Harry saw what Ron meant - Draco sat on the couch, a good arms-length away from the girls, and watched them with a look in his eyes Harry had never seen before. Harry sat down and filled the gap between Draco and Hermione.
"Doing what?" Malfoy asked and suddenly wasn't so harsh anymore.
Hermione hugged Harry tightly. "Happy birthday Harry."
"Hey, Potter. Relax.", Malfoy smiled and lay his hand on Harry's.
"Thanks.", Draco smiled satisfied and Potter sat next to him.
What was Potter even thinking? He was so gross and weird. Draco brushed his teeth and stepped back into their dark room. He manoeuvred his way to his bed and lay down. Potter didn't talk, Draco could only hear him breathing.
"You bastard! You bloody bastard! What do you think?", Draco said and slapped Potter on his shoulder. Potter laughed quietly.
"Fine, Potty." Draco groaned, trying do sound as annoyed as possible.
"Hey," Potter said calmly and kissed Draco, "It's alright." He kissed him again.
"Come," Harry said and grabbed Malfoy's hand.
Harry raised a cocky eyebrow and chuckled. He looked Malfoy in the eyes - those glistening grey eyes. But Malfoy turned away and looked at his still slightly shaking hands instead.
"Is it from your father?", Harry asked.
An old elf stood in front of them.
"Get up.", he said and Draco cheered. Potter shook his head laughing.
Harry swallowed, trying to ignore his upside-down stomach. He nodded and let Malfoy inside.
"What?", Draco asked.
"Let's get this party started!" Malfoy said excitedly with a glint in his eye.
"What the hell!" He said.
"Five hundred? Oh, god, Draco. We can't spend so much money on a table."
After Harry had finished the sentence, he was really impressed by himself. How did he manage to lie to his friends just like that? And it made perfect sense. The only thing missing was that they believed him. There was a pause before anyone answered.
Draco read every newspaper until he came to the second last one in the box. "
"What had happened last night?" Harry asked.
Harry grinned because he knew exactly that Hermione was blushing furiously right now. He looked at Malfoy, who nodded and Harry said goodbye to Hermione. After they had ended the call, Harry laid his phone on the table.
"Wake up!", Harry said, "Pomfrey is coming!"
They all thought being close together might be the best way to get better after everything that had happened. Of course Harry was aware of Ron and Hermione's relationship, what made him even more grateful that they had agreed to move in together.
"Yeah..." Potter replied "They made up just before I came into the room."
Everyone laughed again, this time even Malfoy couldn't hold back to snicker.
"Or he is just too young for this." Ron said and rolled his eyes.
Hermione bit her lip and looked around. "I'm going to look for Ginny. You boys have fun."
"Why did you tell Ron?"
Draco nodded and Harry gave her a meaningful look. McGonnagal cleared her throat and continued. They did so, and everyone in the Great Hall applauded as they entered, Fleur and Roger first, then Krum and Hermione, Cedric and Cho were the third and Harry and Draco were fourth and last. As soon as they entered, everyone started whispering hectically and Harry's eyes fell on Ron. His jaw dropped. Yeah, Harry had a
"Alright, I get it. Stop!", she said.
Harry nodded smiling. "We'll put in loads and loads of pictures."
"Nope.", Draco laughed, "I'm your treasure! I'm your treasure!", he kept singing and Harry blushed, while Ron laughed loudly.
Draco took his eyes off Potter and looked at the minister, then glared at Potter and his mother.
"What have we got to do today?" Draco asked.
And then finally he lifted his arm and pointed at Malfoy. "What-" Ron started, "What's
Draco rolled his eyes and scoffed. They lay beneath the covers, facing each other, their noses almost touching.
Once again, Weasley hold him back.
Her bushy hair was into a ponytail. Behind her, Weasley was standing with an expressionless face.
Harry grinned and grabbed Draco's hand. They walked out of the Hall and Harry dragged Draco up to Gryffindor tower. Draco smiled nervously, as Harry named the password and the portrait hole opened. Harry climbed inside, followed by Draco. The common room was empty, only illuminated by a few single torches. Draco looked around.
"You had plenty of time, Draco. While I was in the library for example.", Potter answered.
Harry had thought about going back to Hogwarts all the time and he still did. He was looking forward for his first day just like he did when he had been an eleven year old little boy. And every time he thought about his first day next year, a certain name pops into his head.
Just when he put on a fresh shirt, the doorbell rang. Harry was startled but immediately gathered himself again and hurried downstairs towards the door. He couldn't quite explain the weird feeling in his stomach, but somehow Harry felt like he might throw up. Slowly opening the door Harry peeked outside. Malfoy stood there on the doorstep, broom in his one hand and a pack of cigarettes in the other. Malfoy quickly stuffed them away and looked at Harry, who suddenly forgot how to talk. This was just so weird.
"What?" Harry asked.
before they would go to
"What do you call-" Hermione looked at the owl closely, "him?"
Harry laughed and nodded.
"Listen. None of us are perfect and we all have our doubts sometimes. But Harry loves you, I know it. I see the way he looks at you - it's how I would have wished for him to look at my daughter." Mrs Weasley said.
Malfoy shook his head. "No it's alright, I'll just dry them up."
Harry shook his head in disbelief. He only hoped Malfoy wouldn't see this, and if he would, he shouldn't get mad. Draco should get to learn that being with Harry meant being with everyone else. What was Harry even thinking?
"So, this morning..."
"Romilda Vane."
Mr Weasley laughed. "That's how she is. Well, say Ron hello from me and tell him his mother wants him to answer to her letter."
?", Ron asked and raised en eyebrow.
Malfoy didn't answer, but pulled out a letter.
Harry couldn't help but smile. To hide his stupid grin he drank his Coke and found that Malfoy had the same idea. So they sat there drinking their drinks for a minute or two until either of them could stop smiling.
"It's alright. You see, father, Harry here wanted me to wear my hair like this just once.", Draco answered with a pleasant smile. Mr Malfoy nodded.
Ron crossed his arms in front of his chest. "So what's your deal then?"
Harry and Ron grinned. They all gathered around the table, Mr Weasley and George joined as well. The food was amazing. Mrs Weasley really had a talent for that.
Draco noticed that he picked at his shirt. He looked as nervous as Draco felt.
When Draco came into the kitchen Theo had already finished preparing breakfast. They sat down at the small round table and started eating. Draco swallowed his scrambled egg and gathered his thoughts. Now was the time to talk to Theo - there was no Pansy and no distracting heat.
"Can we sit?" Harry asked sweetly. The boy nodded and so Harry and Neville sat.
"We'll see you, Malfoy.", she said and smiled at Potter.
"I'm-" Draco cleared his throat, "I'm gay."
"Yeah."
"And so does mine.", Potter answered and kissed Draco again.
Harry looked at the Slyhterin and suddenly realised that this was his first ever contact with Muggle technology. Harry grinned.
did he have to be gay? Did Draco actually stand a chance? Not that he was gay, but - was he? Was Draco gay? He had never quite liked girls, not the ones at Hogwarts anyways. He knew Pansy had liked him for a long time, but she'd given up after a while because she, too, figured that Draco didn't have
Harry and Ron looked at each other.
Harry nodded. "I will. Have a nice day, Mr Weasley."
Harry already knew what song it was. "You wouldn't." He said with a light smile.
Harry smiled. They convinced him he should get to eat something, so the three went to the fifth floor and grabbed a bite to eat and a cup of tea. The day went by faster than Harry would have liked. Before he knew it, the sun was setting once again and Nott and Zabini got ready to leave again. Harry walked up and down the corridor in front of Draco's door. Harry pulled out his cellphone and dialed his home number. It was Ron who picked up the phone.
"Dudley, stay where you are, your mad cousin is here!", Vernon shouted.
"Happy birthday, idiot.", he whispered.
Harry laughed and gave him a quick kiss on his cheek and left with the others to the Gryffindor table, leaving Draco standing there for a moment, now all eyes on him, and he set off for his own house table.
Draco breathed out and closed his eyes. He rubbed them and opened them again. This was not normal. This was so not normal. Was this a dream of Potter's? Oh Merlin!
Knowing Dean and Seamus, Harry could be sure that
"Potter! What the hell do you think you're doing here?" He asked outraged.
Draco still stood alone. Every now and then a few girls would come up to him and ask him if he wanted to dance. Draco never wanted to dance, he hated dancing.
Harry looked down at his hands that were currently fumbling with his own shirt. "I don't want you to feel bad or anything. I just... I'm sick of fighting."
"No idea, they won't tell us anything." Nott said.
"Fine." His mother said gently and her voice broke.
"Now there's no daddy that can rescue you.", said the first girl.
else, and stuffed the Daily Prophet into his bag.
"I just came to keep you company," she said as Harry took a book from the shelve. He smiled.
"I think I would love to see France some day. Paris, you know."
Harry took a deep breath. "Ready."
The first day of living with Malfoy was over and Harry already had enough. Why hadn't he locked the door? He was such an arse. Harry put on his pyjama and lay down in his bed. Malfoy was already in his own bed. It was quiet for a long time, until Harry spoke:
"Relax, idiot. I just want to tie this damn thing," Malfoy said calmly. His voice was really nice like this, all soft. He tied Harry's tie, took a step back and smiled satisfied. "There you go," he said nodding, "Someday I will teach you child how to do this."
~ Narcissa"
"And I think when you're there it will be a much stronger feeling." Ron added in agreement, "Now we're just talking about it, but you really being there could trigger something, when only the letter gave you these nightmares."
"I don't want you to do this with anyone else.", Potter said, his voice sounded throaty and it made Draco's stomach clench with arousal.
"Why do you care now? What does it matter to you? You have your friends and your pride and your name and what have I? I have my father, who gives not one fuck about me and my mother who is annoying like hell and I have four friends that are not on my school anymore and one of my best friends is dead. The other students here hate me and no one wants a death eater going to the same school. And I hate myself for the things I have done the last years. Everyone hates me!", Malfoy's voice shouted in Harry's head.
"Are you okay?" He asked and put his hand on Draco's back. This time, he didn't mind.
Harry was obsessed with Draco's hair. It was so wonderfully soft and felt so good gliding though Harry's fingers.
Malfoy gave in after a few minutes of discussion and pulled off his trousers as well, but for some reason he didn't want to take off his pullover. They lay down and Harry had a tingling feeling in his stomach. Malfoy's grey eyes glistened in the low light from the street lamps and Harry had to smile. The storm was raging outside and rain splashed against the window. Harry was about to drift off to sleep when there was a crash of thunder, that woke Teddy up and made him cry. Harry groaned and got up.
"When can you leave?", Ron asked.
Nott and Zabini forced a smile back and Harry thought, maybe they weren't that bad. He walked back to the Gryffindor tower, Neville, Dean and Ron were in the common room.
"Is it true? Is it really true? Kreacher is not being tricked by his own eyes, is he?", he asked and rubbed his eyes. Draco laughed.
he'd just kissed!
Harry felt dizzy and he had to sit down. He looked up at the healer that still stood there, her clipboard clutched to her chest.
"What?", Draco mumbled sleepy.
Draco hurried into the hallway, grabbed shoes and broom and opened the door.
"So...", Potter said. He started every night like that. Draco laughed.
"I would like to go on a date first.", Draco answered mockingly.
Potter smiled and Weasley looked at Draco. His red hair pained Draco's eyes.
He turned around and glared at Harry.
"Um..." He replied confused. Draco never asked for how his friends felt. He wanted to be asked and when he was, he didn't want to answer because Draco didn't like to talk about his feelings.
"Don't call me like that, or I'm cracking.", he said and Draco laughed.
Harry's chin dropped. "Unbelievable."
Now Draco could only wait until Pansy decided she was ready to ruin his evening and go out into the flaming heat and wander around the alley.
"Why so happy?", he asked and Draco shrugged.
"Where to?" Harry heard himself say before he could stop the words coming out of his mouth.
As Draco woke up again, it was one hour later.
Now it was Draco's turn to redden. He took his hand off of Potter's cheek and bushed away his hair. Suddenly, Potter closed his eyes. Draco watched him with a smile until Potter opened his eyes again and Draco saw they were filled with tears.
He had always hated it when his friends would ask about his feelings when he clearly wasn't in the mood.
"Can talk about this later, Hermione?", he asked with a pleading look.
Harry smiled.
"What's on the agenda for today?" Ron asked suddenly.
Two weeks had passed since the "kiss". Neither Draco nor Potter had talked about it, not with each other and especially not with anyone else. Draco's life got quite lonely. Most of the time he stayed in his room and studied, because Blaise was busy with his new friends and Draco didn't bother to find new. Apart from in the evenings before and after dinner and in the mornings before breakfast Draco was alone in the dorm room. Sometimes he left his bed to sit in the common room just so he could be around other people. Draco had never really liked people but now it felt really lonely and Draco somehow hated it.
"Am I allowed to be sorry now?", he asked and laughed.
Ron was talking so loud now that Harry thought Mr and Mrs Baker could hear him by now.
"I'll see you soon, little buddy." Harry, too, told him and played a little with his hair that turned as black as Harry's.
"Bye mate.", Ron said smiling. Harry smiled too.
Reaching level ten, Potter, Draco and Narcissa left the lift and Potter brought them to courtroom number four. He opened the heavy black door and held them open for the two Malfoys. Narcissa nodded thankfully and Draco just walked past him. Potter closed the door behind them and led each of them to their seats - two seats in the first row on the side of the room. In the middle of the courtroom stood a wooden stool, visible for every member of the Wizengamot. Draco knew the look on his mother's face, she was frightened. He was too, but because Potter was here, he tried to be as brave as he could. Draco still didn't understand what the git was even doing here. Did he just come to show them their seats? And that was how the great Harry Potter was helping? Wow, respect.
"What have you done with your hair?", he snarled. Mrs Malfoy boxed her elbow in his ribs and he quietened.
"Not here.", Vernon said hastily, but Potter only laughed.
"Harry is my friend and if he's in trouble it's my responsibility to help him out."
Why did she have to be so childish about that? They could still be friends, but no, Ginny had to make everything as uncomfortable and complicated as it could get.
"True.", Potter laughed and kissed Draco. Draco moaned.
could be the one who ruins your son? Potter seems not as bad as he used to be.", the woman said.
He hurried back to the common room. Harry noticed a few people sitting there, but didn't pay attention and walked past them. He wanted to get to Malfoy as fast as possible.
"Madame Pomfrey told Hermione that I can leave tomorrow. My condition has improved significantly, to say it with her words.", Harry answered.
"Potter?", Draco asked again.
"Just go.", she said and Draco shook his head.
Draco walked through the whole school into the Great Hall, were already a lot of students sat and ate. Draco found Blaise real quick and sat next to him.
"Great Hall.", Weasley panted.
"Okay.", he said. Potter stood up and dressed hinself, then left the room. Draco sighed.
Harry looked at Draco and said he would take him, the way to his house would be easier.
"Huh? Oh, practically, yes." Harry said and put on a polite smile.
"I've been wondering why it took you so long to get yogurt." Theo said with a slight laugh.
"Why not? I don't want that this stupid bitch is stealing the man of my dreams, for God's sake!", Draco answered annoyed.
"What's that?", Draco asked and pointed on red curtain opposite of the front door.
He hugged his mother for the last time and she gave him a quick kiss on the cheek, wiped away the stain of pink and smiled.
"I know, Draco. I know.", Harry answered and walked out of the room.
"Harry?", Hermione asked.
"Ah, Mister Malfoy. Sit down. Why are you still awake?", she asked.
He opened his mouth and slowly sucked the head, twirling his tongue around the sensitive corona. Draco gasped and thrust his hips upwards, threading his fingers through Potter's hair. Potter's head bobbed up and down faster and faster as he took Draco's prick in and out, deeper and deeper into the suction of his mouth.
"I like that this is so amusing to you." Harry said sarcastically, even though he really
"How are you Harry?" She asked smiling.
"Good morning, Harry."
After breakfast, Draco sat down with Teddy at the piano and played a calm melody in the background whil Ron and Harry sat down to open Hermione's letter and answer her.
"I haven't done anything.", Draco snapped at her.
"See you in twenty minutes, right here.", Draco said, before the Slytherins set off for the dungeons.
. Harry hated the idea of living a whole year with him, listening to his insults and look at the slimy git every day, but he didn't like to go to McGonnagal and argue. Just because he was Harry Potter, it didn't mean he could have everything he wanted and he was tired of getting everything he wanted. He wanted to work for it, just as the others did. He wanted to have a normal year. But Harry already knew that this year will definitely not be normal. The younger students were looking at him and whispered something behind their hands when he passed them.
!", Harry said.
"Wow, Potter. In the last minute, you didn't step on my foot.", Draco said mockingly and Harry stuck his tongue out. Draco laughed.
"OK. Well. Maybe I'll let you do it again sometime."
Harry lay down on his bed and put Teddy on his stomach. Harry calmed Teddy down and stoked his soft hair. Draco reached out for Teddy's small hand and took it carefully, looking at Harry with big eyes. Harry had butterflies in his stomach and fog in his head.
The smile on Harry's lips faded and he nodded. Draco could feel his nervosity.
October rushed past them uneventfully. On Saturday the 31st, Andromeda brought over her grandson once again to celebrate Halloween at Harry's house. Because Teddy was still too young for trick-or-treating, they stayed at home and played with him, when he took a nap they ate dinner. In the evening, Ron lit the fire in the living room fireplace.
"How do you plan on spending the next weeks?" Another question was asked. The "interviewer" asked next question as if Draco wasn't right there to hear everything, "What is Malfoy doing here?"
Malfoy nodded. "Theo has a birthday party in three weeks, do you want to come?"
"No problem. Everything to make Harry happy." Ron said.
"Well, then I guess I just have to get as comfortable as I can," Draco said and started unbuttoning his dress shirt.
Draco looked up. He knew Theo just said that to provoke him, but - Draco had to admit - it worked. He shot Theo a questioning look.
Harry threw the letter in his lap and Ron read aloud to Luna:
"Yeah.", Harry said quickly, before he could chicken out.
"So, it's a no.", Potter said and tried to hide his disappointment- in vain.
"By all means, don't let me distract you.", Draco chuckled.
"Don't be silly, Draco. To spend the holidays alone will definitely be horrible and besides, my aunt and uncle won't find it too amusing to have a second wizard in their house. But we still are two wizards against two Muggles.", Harry said and grinned at the thought of uncle Vernon gritting his teeth when Harry and Draco show up on their doorstep. Draco seemed to be thinking about what Harry had said.
Draco grinned.
Malfoy nodded. "It really is."
!", Draco shouted.
He lay awake for a while, thinking about how he got here. Not physically, but mentally. Draco thought about how he smiled at Potter, how he fell asleep next to Potter, how he missed Potter when he wasn't around, how he loved Potter's laugh and how he couldn't stand not talking to Potter. Then Draco realized that tomorrow was the day Potter was allowed to get back to their dorm, what meant that all of his friends were going to come and pick him up. Draco supposed they would get him when they left, but he thought they wouldn't be too happy to find him already being there, sleeping next to their best friend. After all, they weren't too happy when Potter had only
"I dooo!" Malfoy whined and threw his head back.
"Yeah, shush." Nott agreed, "But yeah, I'm fine."
"Oh Merlin, there she goes." Ron whispered to Harry and Harry snickered.
"I...", Harry was going to say that he didn’t know how, but if he didn't even know how to give a hand job, he really was a useless idiot.
They walked back to their room.
"We'll see you, mother.", he said. She nodded.
"Just go."
"Potter.", Draco said, this time, he was the one who kissed Harry.
"What was that?", Potter asked laughing and looked at Draco. Draco shrugged and started eating.
"Did you just call me
"Harry found someone.", Hermione told him, what was a big mistake.
Harry looked at him and tried to get his cheeks back to their normal colour.
"What was the dream about, Harry?" Dumbledore asked calm as usual.
"Dunno.", Harry answered, looking at the floor.
Draco rolled his eyes. "This is stressful, okay?" He said annoyed, "I don't even want to go."
They all stood around the big bonfire, that was bewitched to shine through the snow, and warmed each other. Harry looked into the snowy night, eggnog in one hand and Malfoy in the other, and smiled. Everyone seemed very happy as the evening went on and the quarrel about Fred seemed forgotten. Harry was happy to have Draco by his side.
"Shut up, Weasel." Draco snarled.
Draco laughed ironically and watched Pansy disappear into the crowd.
"But I do. And I won't leave you alone until I talked to him", Draco said.
"Open the fucking door!"
Draco was now in the Great Hall for the first time since the article in the Prophet. Harry noticed, he was quite nervous to sit back with his fellow Slytherins.
"Did you wank the last weeks?", Harry
In the late afternoon, Ron was taking a shower, Hermione was reading a book and Harry zapped through the TV channels. Nothing interesting was on, so he turned it off again and put the remote on the sofa table. When Hermione noticed that Harry had nothing to do, she closed her book and looked at him. Harry hoped she wasn't going to ask again where he'd been last night.
She led Draco behind another red curtain where a chair and a big man waited for him. The man wore rubber gloves and held a strange object in his hand. Theo didn't want to come inside. Draco thought he was being ridiculous, but Theo stood his ground and waited on the other side of the curtain.
"Thanks Ron." Said Harry smiling.
How did this happen? How has it come to this? Had Draco really changed? Was Harry really comfortable with this? He couldn't think about anything else and hardly payed attention to where he was flying, what was not only very dangerous but also embarrassing. Harry wanted to believe that Draco had changed, he really wanted to, but it was just too hard. In the seven years they had spent together, Harry couldn't see Draco ever changing, but now here they were. Harry wondered what his past-self would say if he would see them like this - kissing, being more or less nice to each other, being at the Manor. He would probably say that Harry had gone completely mental and would try to convince him of it, naming all the horrible things Malfoy had done.
Malfoy agreed and Harry typed in her number and called her.
Malfoy looked surprised as well. He opened his mouth to say something, but all that came out was air and so he closed it again. Harry smiled.
"Stop being such a crybaby and follow me, you blithering idiot!"
am unreasonable?" Malfoy laughed, "Yeah right."
"I know.", he said.
"It does not."
"I know how you feel-" Harry started, but stopped as Malfoy jumped up.
He opened his eyes to look at Draco, who was already looking at him.
"Good to see you smiling.", Potter said.
"I can take care of myself." Harry said, "I just need to pick something up. Dont wait for me."
and he knew Malfoy loved it when he called him
"Not strong enough," Harry laughed.
. Draco wasn't used to cozy. He was used to naked grey walls and a simple plain black carpet. Draco wasn't used to walls covered with pictures, especially not pictures of happy people. He was used to one enormous portrait of him and his parents with stern emotionless faces on an even more enormous naked grey wall.
Harry teared up. This was Draco freaking Malfoy who just complimented him and told him he loved him. And he had said it in such a serious and deep voice that made the hairs at the back of Harry's neck stand up. Malfoy was so hot right now, lying there on the bed all beaten up and scarred and grinning and imperfectly perfect. Harry hid his tears by pulling his sweater over his head.
Harry walked faster towards the Entrance Hall. A small part in Harry said he should turn, because it was a trap. Another part screamed Malfoy's name. Harry walked through darkness. The way before him was only illuminated by the light of his wand and the snow at his feet twinkled in the light.
Malfoy didn't say a word. He just nodded courtly and looked at his hands.
Draco stared at the parchment. He didn't know the handwriting and he didn't know the bird. He wasn't going to respond. Draco held the parchment in his hands for a little while longer until his stomach growled loudly. Maybe he should go and eat something. Theo and Pansy had a surprised look on both their faces when Draco entered the living room where they sat on the couch eating Chinese.
"And Pansy", Nott smiled, "Don't worry about her. She's just jealous because now she's sure that Draco could never like her, now that he has you."
"I'm sorry, but don't you come to classes today?", Harry asked. Malfoy opened his eyes immediately and stared at him. His grey eyes reflected the sunlight and looked like melted silver. Harry smiled.
The letter started with a "Dear Draco", what was already way better than Lucius' letter.
?", Draco asked, "
"Hey.", he said, trying very hard to be friendly.
They sat upstairs for quite a long time and barely talked. Some time later, they heard someone walking into the room next door.
Harry shrugged chuckling. He saw that Malfoy was leaving his spot in front of the stage and was walking towards the bar.
"TWO-", Ron said but then calmed down, "Two bloody bottles?"
"Oh drop it, Malfoy, you're a fraud," Ron said annoyed.
"What are you talking about?" Harry asked confused, what made Malfoy look at him again.
Harry grabbed a stone from the ground and began to hack at the robes binding Draco, and after several minutes' hard work, they broke apart. Draco floated, unconscious, a few inches over the lake bottom, drifting a little in the ebb of the water.
Harry pulled Draco away from Ron's bed and pointed at the empty one.
Draco smiled as Potter keeled down next to one elf and talked to him. He looked up and found Draco's gaze. Draco looked away and blushed.
"Yep." Harry bit his lip.
"Who was it?", Potter asked. Draco stood up and stuffed the letter in his bedside table.
Harry raised an eyebrow. "What do you mean?" He felt his heart beat faster in his chest, unprepared for what came next.
"I don't get what you're so upset about," Harry said, but immediately realized what a stupid thing this was to say.
"I can't do one.", Malfoy finally said. Harry looked at him.
!", Draco asked.
"He's not coming." Harry said disappointed to Hermione, who looked at him sadly.
Harry grabbed a sharpie himself - pink - and drew a heart next to the Mark, showing Teddy he was allowed to do that. Teddy played close attention to the movement of Harry's pen, yet couldn't mimic it. He didn't paint a random jumble of lines though - Teddy drew careful circles and several lines that looked like they were supposed to be something, but weren't actually. It was abstract art. Harry drew some flowers and another heart. Teddy looked at him with big eyes and held the sharpie up high. Harry smiled, took it from him and put on the cap. He wasn't sure how Draco would react when he would wake up and find his Dark Mark painted on.
Malfoy shook his head. "Theo tried to hook me up with one, but she wasn't really my type and she was drunk. So she went with Theo and her two friends."
"He said I'm disrespecting my family. I fought for the Dark Lord in the war and now I'm with the one who killed him. And appently I'm
Potter stopped moving and opened his eyes widely while their lips were still attached to each other. "Slower, please." Draco said and gasped for air. Potter raised his eyebrow mockingly and grinned.
Malfoy only shrugged and Harry shook his head with a light smile. He pulled out a box of macaroni and grabbed the rest of the ingredients from the fridge.
Harry heard footsteps in front of his door and after a short pause they distanced again. He figured it must have been Hermione checking if he really went to bed. Harry's new owl Bond hooted softly in the corner, but Harry ignored him and just turned to the side, his eyes still closed.
They got out of the - Draco read a sign that said
"Listen up, Weasley."
"We have strict orders."
"So true.", Dean shook his head.
Harry nodded and rubbed his eyes. When he opened them again, Sirius wasn't Sirius anymore.
"Seems understandable." Harry only said.
"Oh my god, Malfoy!", he said loudly and stormed back out and closed the door behind him. Harry breathed heavily. What the hell was wrong with him? Harry sat down on his bed and waited. He had no idea for what, but he sat there, wordlessly and staring at the bathroom door.
"Yes, you are right, and I still want to punch him in the face.", she answered.
"Yes."
"Mister Harry Potter. You are back. How wonderful. Mister Draco couldn't stand eating without you.", one elf said.
It was time for Harry and Draco to exchange their vows. Harry was so nervous his hands were trembling and all he could hear was his heart hammering against his ribcage. He took Draco's free hand and smiled.
And then it occurred to him:
After breakfast, they went back to the common room, that was crowded with people. Everyone was enjoying their presents and talked. Harry looked at the big wooden grandfather clock.
She didn't.
"Draco, can I talk to you in private for a moment?"
"Good. It is about time."
They have decided to send Hermione packages every Wednesday and Sunday so she can keep track of their week easily. Most of the pictures Harry and Ron had picked out were of them or of Teddy, some of them showed Harry's and Ron's cubicles at the Ministry and on one (that now hung in their living room as well) were Harry and Ron waving with happy smiles on their faces in the middle of the Aurors headquarters on their first day. They wrote a long letter to Hermione, both of them taking turns with the quill and leaving the letter a scribbled mess.
"I'm sorry, I said this. I know I shouldn't- I mean it- it just slipped out.", he stammered.
"Bloody take these off!"
"Yes, Potter. My mother." Draco answered harshly, "Told me the Manor wasn't a place for me anymore. As if it had been a place for me before. It stopped being a place for me when my father invited...
"Not even my hair is straight!", he said annoyed and Draco laughed.
"Yes, you can. How is Draco Malfoy?" Harry asked.
Then, Potter looked up.
Potter's hand held him awkwardly, but then Potter released Draco's cock and re-gripped it more surely, caressing, before his thumb circled over the wet tip and his strokes evened out.
"Yeah, well Granger asked me if I would like to come. And since all of her stupid friends are coming I thought I'd ask you guys." Pansy explained.
In the evening when Teddy was sleeping peacefully in his crib, Harry and Malfoy sat in the living room with Ron and Hermione, Ginny had left just before dinner. They weren't talking much - they didn't have much to talk about - but they played Exploding Snap. They went to bed not long after that, Harry and Malfoy parted ways with Ron and Hermione upstairs in the hallway between their two bedrooms.
"Nice. We're going to the lake.", Granger said, but Weasley shook his head.
Malfoy looked rather pale when Harry let him inside the house the next morning - even paler than usual. He might have looked a little green if they were in a cartoon. Harry was seriously concerned he might throw up.
Of course they knew him. Blaise, Pansy, Theo and Greg had to listen to Draco for seven years to whine about Potter. Lucius served the man who wanted to kill Potter and his mother did so too.
Harry went to the library, but the silence was unbearable.
"Hermione, I'm leaving now.",  Harry said and she nodded without saying a word.
. The Dark Lord. It was terrifying, but I needed to stay strong and my father...", Draco's voice cracked. Potter smiled weakly.
They shouted at each other for a while until something strange happened. Malfoy broke to the floor right in front of Harry, who stood there and didn't really know what to do.
Harry smiled after him and walked with the others to Gryffindor tower.
Harry smiled. This was absolutely crazy. Somehow he didn't feel tired at all and he could sit here and talk for hours, but he had to be home before Hermione came looking for him.
Harry froze at the sound and slowly turned his head to look at Malfoy's face. Wow. His laugh sounded so unfamiliar and yet soft and sweet. Malfoy's face looked cuter than ever when he laughed. He tilted his head back and closed his eyes and when he laughed he showed his flashing white teeth. Harry couldn't look away. To see Malfoy happy wasn't something you see every day, so Harry had to soak up every bit he could.
Harry got annoyed so quickly. He rolled his eyes and balled his fists.
"It's really none of your business.", Harry answered and stood up.
and Harry got himself a new set of Snitches to practice with. It had been nice to see George again even though he didn't have much time to talk since the joke shop was as busy as ever. Teddy was fast asleep upstairs when Harry, Ron and Luna fell down onto the sofa and put their feet on the small table. Ron lit the fire in the fireplace by a flick of his wand and they all shivered. Just when Harry thought everything in his life was going great, an owl flew against the living room window.
The healer looked at him with frightened eyes at first, then took her clipboard and flicked through the papers. "Alright." She sighed, "Mr Malfoy was hit by several stunning spells and was bleeding internally, but that is back to normal and no longer a concern. He has four broken ribs, what could be fixed easily if it wasn't for his partially collapsed lung. He also suffered a minor concussion so we put his head on ice."
Draco just stood next to him and didn't say a word.
"Come on, let's look for some girls."
"It's actually not." Malfoy said, "The flat is so much smaller and shittier than the Manor , I feel like I have to squeeze into every room."
"You know what, Malfoy? Since when do you care where people want you to be and where not? You're your own person and if you want to see Harry, go and see him. You have every right to do so. And I bet he would want you there now that he's awake. And stop being so cranky and rude, someday the others will find out eventually."
"Get in.", he said and lifted the covers. Harry smiled nervously. Draco let out a snort.
"I don't need to be taken care of, Potter." Malfoy protested, sitting on the staircase.
Draco didn't move. Lucius Malfoy looked at Harry with a look of disgust.
"That wasn’t bad, you know. For a first time.", Draco sounded almost friendly. Harry swallowed.
"Potter, from where do you-"
"What did you say?", Draco asked dangerously and if Harry was Nott, he would have been quiet now.
Draco looked at Harry, who nodded and after scowling at Ron, Draco left.
"Just some potatoes and egg." Theo answered.
Draco's eyes widened and he had to have a clue what Harry was going to say.
"I want to say it, I really do, but I'm drunk, so I won't. I don't want you to think I said it just because of the alcohol." He whispered into Harry's ear.
Draco took Harry's hand and pulled him to the desk, Draco sat on the last time he was here. They sat down next to each other and Draco looked Harry deep in the eyes.
Hermione wasn't very approachable that day, her nose was buried in books already, what Ron and Harry couldn't understand at all.
"I'm still in the shower!" Malfoy shouted back.
"Come on, Ron. Be honest.", Harry answered.
"I wanted to ask-", Draco coughed, "where we are going to meet."
"So he didn't leave, did he? Over the Floo or something?", Harry asked worried. McGonnagal shook her head once again.
"What, showing up here with your
Harry felt Draco trembling with fury. He poked his wand harder into Vernon's neck.
"Oh great! New roommates!" Draco said sarcastically.
"Thank you, Draco." Harry said and squeezed Draco's hand.
There were quite a few students that have lost friends or family in the war and with every person, Harry found more confidence and better encouragements. He noticed that there have been only two Slytherins to seek his advice, but he wasn't surprised, given the fact he had one sitting at home with just the same communication issues. A look at the clock told Harry it was getting late and the students should probably go to bed soon, but he didn't want to deny anyone some comforting words.
"Do you see mine as well?"
Harry laughed, although he had no idea why. He was so damn happy right now.
"I guess." Harry said even though he didn't want them to be afraid of him, he wanted them to get along with him.
"I- I don't know."
They stepped in the dining room. Mrs Malfoy and Draco's friends looked at them. Mr Malfoy, on the other hand, glared at Draco.
laughing from the bathroom.
"Yeah I don't know. I mean I like them but it's really complicated. I don't know exactly. Things have been so bad the whole time in the past and I don't know if I can just swallow the old feelings and even if I do maybe they don't and it would be really weird and awkward all the time."
Harry laughed, pressed a kiss to Draco's lips and grabbed his ass for a short moment. He was quite satisfied with himself, as this movement made Draco groan. Harry grinned.
Harry grinned even wider and sat in Draco's lap.
Harry laughed.
Harry's face reddened and George and Ron laughed. It was good to see that Draco could joke about this. They have somehow convinced George that he did need help and spent the day helping out in the shop.
"I don't know, it's just a lot to take in. I mean not too long ago you broke up with my sister, so..."
"You did.", he replied and Draco's cheeks turned into the colour of a tomato.
"But you like me," Potter said, still grinning.
"I have to say sorry.", he said, "So, you really like him?"
"She seems really fine. Wants to talk to you though."
"Draco has overslept, he's going to be a little late," he said.
Harry chuckled. "Yes, he was still asleep when I left. But I have to say, he's been working really hard this week as well, Hermione would be proud to see this."
"What do you want, Potter?", Malfoy asked annoyed.
Someone else laughed and Harry wondered where he had heard that before. When the other person spoke, Harry almost fainted.
"Not really, I like cooking. Some things I don't really have time or lust for, I simply do with magic." Harry shrugged.
"Alright,
Harry looked again at Draco, who nodded.
"What was going on out there?" Malfoy asked, "I heard you shout." He put away his Quidditch magazine.
"Nice to see you again Harry. How have you been?" She asked after releasing him again.
Potter hesitated, then opened the book slowly. On the first page was a picture of a small boy, he was eleven years old, Draco noticed the Hogwarts Express in the background. The boy had shoulder-long black curled hair and was very handsome.
Theo and Pansy laughed. This was exactly what they wanted to hear and Draco didn't dare to tell them about the talk he had had with Potter afterwards.
The table was sent to their home by the employees and Harry took Draco to London where all the Muggles were. Draco stopped many times and stared at the phones.
"Thanks."
Silence.
He didn't move, he didn't blink, he just breathed in and out soundless. Draco sat down on the edge of the bed and took Potter's hand. She was cold and Draco held her so long until she got warm.
"Don't you dare, you loser!", Draco told himself. A house elf gave him a tissue and smiled friendly.
Draco finished, got dressed and went back into their room. Potter sat on his desk, music was playing from some strange box and Potter was humming along with the singer.
In the Great Hall, Draco immediately sat down on the Slytherin table. He knew Slytherins were going to be less popular than in the years before. The students filled the other tables and everyone sat down on their old tables. Potter sat on the table on the other side of the Hall, on the Gryffindor table. Draco realised that the table, where he himself sat at, was only half full. And he was afraid the table wouldn't fill any more. He started to miss Pansy and Goyle and Theo. Draco looked at the teacher's table and missed someone else. The seat of Professor Snape was occupied by Professor Slughorn, who hated Draco and Draco hated him. Professor- Headmistress McGonnagal walked up to the podium where Dumbledore used to give his speeches.
"Ron this isn't Hermione's fault," Neville said and pulled Harry out of his thoughts.
"Um, I wanted to do something with Draco later.", answered Harry.
"And she's not coming?"
"That was
"Merlin, Finnegan. Shove your "why" up your ass and stop being stupid.", he said, looking angry.
"Okay, so... you have trust issues?"
"Well, then let us go upstairs and look for clothes." Narcissa said.
" Harry had written at 10pm.
"I'm fine, thank you. What about you?"
"Where's Teddy?" Malfoy asked in a hoarse voice.
Draco felt like someone had punched him in the gut. He never would have let Weasel talk to him like that, but now it was different. Now Draco felt like he needed to be vulnerable and show how he feels in order to win Weasley over and have a real chance with Potter.
Blaise just shrugged. "There's no point."
"A what?" Draco asked even though he heard him loud and clearly.
"Why didn't you tell me you were going?"
Ginny and Dean nodded courtly and left them. Hermione and Ron slid closer to Harry and Hermione asked:
"And if he doesn't want to listen to you just shout at him and say his boyfriend wants you to tell him he needs him.", Harry laughed.
"Alright, it was before the ball.", Harry answered, rolling his eyes.
"Nothing.", he said, "Everything is alright."
"I wish I were."
"This doesn't help." He said dryly and shook his head.
That was what McGonnagal wanted, wasn't it? Draco rolled his eyes. He slapped himself and screamed into his pillow frustrated.
"You change too." Grunting annoyed, Malfoy closed the door to the library behind himself and Harry grabbed parchment and quill.
"Ron?", Hermione called after him. Ron turned around.
"Beautiful pure-bloods." Theo added bragging.
"Ah. So that's what you really think. Good to know.", she said coldly.
Harry felt weak now. He looked out of the window into the night.
"You regret that you didn't use the chance and touched me this morning, don't you?", he asked happily. Harry smiled.
"Yes, of course he does. I'm gorgeous.", Draco said and chuckled.
"Fuck.", Draco sounded breathless again.
Draco rolled his eyes. Theo and his smartass comments.
"Harry, look at that!" She said loudly and looked like a little child who had just dropped its ice cream.
"The corporal is a lot more difficult, so no blame if you don't do it the first time. It took me several times until I managed it.", Harry smiled.
"Thank you Harry," he said and pulled Harry into a hug.
"Because he's from Slytherin, or what?", Harry asked with a unusual dangerous voice.
"Honestly, Hermione? I thought you'd know better.", Harry shook his head.
When Draco stepped into the classroom, he found Granger looking at him with big eyes. Draco supposed Potter had told her.
"What do you mean? I'm going to put them on." Harry answered.
"All right.", Draco said. He sounded breathless.
and gave it to Ron, who read it himself in silence. They watched the sun rising and sipped their tea as it began to rain outside.
So Harry closed his eyed again, but all he could think about was the loss he suddenly felt in his chest. Sirius. Pictures of Sirius's handsome smile flashed before Harry's eyes, his voice calling Harry's name echoed in his ears. It's been three years since Sirius died, but to Harry it still felt as if it had just happened. He remembered the feeling of hope he'd had when Sirius had asked him to move in together, the hope to finally have a normal family. But little did Harry know that only two years later Sirius would be dead.
It was this unbearably quiet for about half an hour. Draco was sunken into his book and Potter was still working on his essay. Sometimes Draco thought he saw Potter turning around and looking at him, but Draco was sure he had just imagined it since he wasn't even that special to Potter. When Potter had finished his essay, he stuffed everything back into his bag and got up.
"I just want to say I'm sorry. To all of you. For all that I've done." Malfoy said, "For that hippogriff..." Harry couldn't believe Draco remembered Buckbeak, "for trying to jinx each one of you, for the
Harry sighed happily and turned to the classroom door, who swung open and Ron stepped out.
"Harry!", Hermione cried and jumped up.
He rolled over several times, trying to find the perfect position. It was cold in the room and Harry needed the warmth of Draco next to him.
"Your parents? What did they have?", Draco asked interested.
"Malfoy why do you always have to be such an asshole?" Harry shouted.
"They bullied and mocked each other all through our time at Hogwarts and longer," Ron said, "but that day we were at Diagon Alley and Harry told us he saw Draco, his face lit up in a way we haven't seen in quite a long time."
"You can put your stuff here." Malfoy said with a short look at Harry's bag and added "Even though you didn't bring much as I see."
The air inside was warm and smelled of spilled alcohol and sweat. Draco wrinkled his nose as they walked through the crowd to the bar.
Another day of bedrest would have made Draco crazy. It was Thursday, so he was off Potter-duty and went to class. Draco was relieved he could go and know Potter to be in good hands, because he was starting to feel a bit claustrophobic in the dorm room. Going through the common room, Draco noticed the stack of freshly printed newspapers on a small table. He took one and immediately saw the headline "
to live with us!"
Harry laughed, too. "But we never want them too, huh?"
"Harry!" Hermione said and jumped up when she saw him. She sat on the table with Dean, Ron, Neville and Luna.
"Fine.", he said and sounded like he was nothing but untouched by this statement.
. "I'm-" he started.
"Hermione." He spoke.
Ron had went to the Yule Ball with her, not because he had wanted to, but because he had needed a partner and Padma and her sister Parvati had been the only girls left.
"Who said I even want to look for him?" Harry said annoyed. Why couldn't they just let him do his thing?
"Sometimes naked, sometimes not. Depends."
here.", Potter said and stood up, pulling Draco up too.
"Potter, you idiot, are you alright?", Malfoy asked and loosened his arms.
you are, but you're more than just flesh. We never talked much, but the last weeks where we haven't talked
"I want to feel your lips.", Potter whispered smiling, "Against mine. So bad."
Harry and Ron had stopped by McGonagall before they had left the castle and went down to the train in the dark. The Hogwarts Express drove back to London only for them - that was the benefit of being the savior of the Wizarding World. The two boys have fallen asleep during the ride and woke up just before they arrived at platform 9¾. The rest of the drive home was a silent one - only the radio was playing, but neither Harry nor Ron were in the mood to talk. They went straight to bed as they arrived at home, but Harry didn't fall asleep until about two hours later.
"What's so funny?"
"What's the occasion?" Sam asked.
Harry closed the fridge door with an outraged look. "Don't tell me you don't know what Mac and Cheese is!"
"How long were you waiting?" Harry asked, trying to make conversation.
"Because you heard that Potter would be here as well." Theo said as if he knew what he was talking about.
Malfoy had already agreed to come to the Burrow, what Harry had immediately written to Mrs Weasley. Tomorrow, Harry would go to the Ministry and pick up a few papers and drop some off. He knew it was the holidays and he didn't need to do that, but he wanted to do his job right. On Christmas Eve, they were going to the Granger's.
"Mr Malfoy.", he said and held up his hands defensively.
"You are one of the strongest people I know." Harry said, "And you have proven that more than enough."
"You are." Harry laughed.
"It's already late..." Malfoy scratched his head.
"To the kitchens. I thought you were hungry.", Potter answered and before Draco could respond, he marched off. Draco clapped his palm to his forehead and followed Potter.
"Potter. Potter, go get me some tea.", Draco said.
"Let's get out of here.", he said and grabbed Draco's hand.
"And now give me a reason why I should allow you to date my son?"
"Oh you can't stand me? Really? Never occurred to me!"
"Our teacher?", Malfoy asked.
"You look beautiful, mother." Draco said and she smiled.
Until Draco broke the staring contest and his eyes swept over Potter's whole face. It was as beautiful as Draco had had it in his mind. The lighting shaped scar was still clearly visible on his forehead and his hair still looked like a mess, his eyes were just as green as an emerald. Potter's lips - Draco looked at them - were still red and full and haven't faded out the tiniest bit.
"Guess you can imagine what kept me there until three o'clock." Theo winked.
Draco stood up and walked over to Potter's bed. He hoped Potter couldn't see him trembling. Draco stared into Potter's eyes. For a long time. And then Potter slowly licked his lips and grinned.
Draco stood in the bathroom for about five minutes. After he couldn't find a better option he shouted for Potter.
Harry smiled.
His cheeks were getting hot and Ron snickered, until, again, Hermione slapped him. Dean left the common room, so Ginny sat down on the armchair. And then, there was a small awkward moment. Okay, it was not small, but
The bells were beating midnight.
Draco rolled his eyes and pulled his blanket up to his chin.
"Because I'd much rather stay here and read." He finally answered and hoped Pansy would just drop it.
"Stop showering so long!" Potter shouted.
Harry laughed. "Ron, if we're being invited to the feast, I doubt they won't let us eat."
"Sure, we wouldn't dare to miss it." Hermione said happily.
"It is?" Ron and Harry asked simultaneously.
"You're not really sporty, Weasel.", Draco mocked him.
"Potter?"
Harry concentrated on Draco's tongue doing incredible things and Draco's hands holding Harry's wrists. Before anything more happened, Draco pulled away quickly. Harry acted to ask what was wrong, but Draco lay a finger to his lips.
Mrs Dursley out on a horrible horse-like smile and sat down on the couch opposite.
"Ron, tell Hermione and the others I'm going home." He said loudly.
Three idiots like Goyle, Zabaini and Nott couldn't prevent someone like Mr Malfoy from coming upstairs to check if his son and his former enemy were sleeping together.
"So what? He's just a human like the rest of us!", Harry said.
"I do." Draco said.
"Ask whatever you want.", Vernon said with a nasty undertone.
"I really like you, Harry, and if you like him, I can try to understand.", Ron said smiling. Harry smiled too.
Draco laughed and stood up, so did the other boy. They sat down on the floor opposite of each other. Draco smiled again.
"In there?" Malfoy asked and Harry nodded. "Oh you're too cute. Don't tell me you've been doing it like this the whole seven years." Malfoy said and Harry was so annoyed that Malfoy chose to make fun of
"And now stop with that stupid laugh.", Ron ordered, but laughed himself.
"I'm not going to talk to you, idiot.", Draco snarled back and looked at the red haired boy instead.
"What do you want?", he asked, "Why don't you talk to me normal?" Malfoy shook his head.
"Oh.", he said and pulled away slightly, his gaze flickering to Draco's neck.
Malfoy snorted and stormed off. Harry watched him leave for a second, until he realized what was happening. Without looking at Matt, Harry ran after the blonde boy.
"This is the best dream I ever had.", he said.
"Draco, you-"
"Maybe.", Harry answered.
"And he's really trying, you know." Harry continued even though he felt like Malfoy wouldn't want to be defended.
"See you later, Potter.", Draco said, "I'll wait here for you before dinner."
Malfoy followed the healer to Narcissa's room, and Harry watched them vanish inside. He stood in the middle of the hallway and stared at the door. He didn't know if he should be there when Narcissa would get out. Before Harry could make up his mind, the door opened again and Malfoy came back out.
"Do you think your friends are still at the party?" Potter asked.
"Harry!" Ron said when he saw Harry running into the common room.
"Do you know if he was awake long?" Hermione asked quietly.
"The war left Hogwarts in shattered pieces, but strong wizards, including Harry Potter are about to build it up again, brick by brick. Potter recently told in an interview that he was happy to have the opportunity to help his friends and former teachers to build up their home again, because Hogwarts is and will always be his home."
Harry kept knocking hardly.
"You have to be more specific than that."
Potter remained unconvinced and Draco closed his eyes and took a few calming breaths, trying to clear his mind. He opened his eyes again and smiled.
"I'm Harry," Harry said stupidly.
"Let's get presents!"
"What?", he looked at her, "Oh, it's just... Malfoy's not here." Ron grunted.
And then Draco wouldn't come to say a word and his ears would bleed because of her unbearable girlish squealing.
That seemed to have just the effect on Malfoy that Harry had hoped for. He got even redder, what was actually tremendous for his pale skin, and Harry saw that he tried to fight a smile.
"But I-"
His enjoyment was given a cruel edge by the unwelcome thought of Potter being like this with anybody but him.
"Well do that." Mrs Malfoy answered with a slight nod as if they had asked for her permission, "I will go back inside soon."
"So what do you say, truce?" Harry asked and couldn't suppress his hopefulness.
"What? I didn't understand you.", Harry replied smirking and Draco rolled his eyes.
"Me?", Harry scoffed, "I don't think I need to be anything. She was the one who screamed at me."
"How..." Hermione looked away for a second, "How did this happen? I thought you were fighting?"
"Was there an insult in there that I missed?"
The crowd behind them cheered and clapped and stormed towards them. The fireworks went off and built beautiful glittering figures in the air. One of these figures said "Potter & Malfoy". Potter pointed at it and laughed.
Harry tried to sit up, but it didn't work. His arms were too weak to hold him up. He sunk back down and closed his eyes shortly.
Draco's pulse rose with every step he made towards the gates.
"We are not abnormal! I grew up in a bad family, but they never stuffed me in a cupboard, not even as a punishment!", Draco said loudly.
"Malfoy, you don't have to be angry or scared." Harry said smiling.
"No. Not at first. I don't know.", Harry answered.
"Parvati? What?", Harry laughed.
"Such a great idea."
"Do I have to tell you everything? Come!" Draco ordered.
"I know, mother."
Draco nodded slowly.
"Funny, you were so sure about it in sixth year." Ron said.
"I don't know, I guess I saw it coming all along."
Draco shrugged. "I love you, Potter."
Malfoy got up and walked towards the kitchen and watched Harry cook.
The day had passed very quickly and Harry had tried not to ask too many questions about Draco and Ron's new friendship. They all got along really well and even went for a quick fly around the city when the sun was slowly setting and it started to get dark again. When they had gotten back to the house, Malfoy had asked Harry if he could stay the night with such a friendly voice that Harry couldn't say no to.
"Hey, Fred!" Ron shouted across the crowded room. Fred waved and came squeezing through all those people.
Draco sat up.
"You may not be who I had imagined, but I love Draco. I only want the best for him. And over the last few years he didn't get the best." Narcissa's voice wasn't as arrogant as Harry remembered it, but she seemed to get her old glow back with ever word that she spoke, "I suppose you do too?"
Harry was astounded. Malfoy suggested they would see each other again? And not just running into each other. Really seeing each other - meeting.
"Harry, I bought you a pack of Oreos." She said as she put the package into the cupboard.
" It's useless." She said.
"Drink this.", Madame Pomfrey said and gave Harry another glass of potion.
"I'm happy to see you.", Harry answered and shrugged.
"A guy?" Potter asked.
It was easier said than done, but after half an hour or more, Harry felt his eyelids getting heavy. He yawned widely as he put away the album and closed his eyes, clearing his mind.
"Potter.", Narcissa said friendly and hugged Potter.
She hugged Harry and Harry smiled kindly. Malfoy turned away, but his mother slapped him in his head and looked at him with a stern look.
"Look, forget it. It’s not like I care either way.", but Draco sounded like he did care. Harry was getting nervous.
Every now and then, Potter turned tuned to Draco, smiled, Draco fake-smiled too and Potter kissed him, turned back to his friends and kept talking. Draco rolled his eyes.
"Have you been with Harry?", Weasley asked. Draco nodded.
Harry visited Malfoy the first day of the following week. He was glad to see the colour - as much as he had - coming back to his face and he seemed to get stronger as well. It was in the evening when Harry came over and he planned to stay the night. Ron was visited by George, so he wasn't going to be alone, he also basically sent Harry off. Of course, Malfoy's bed was big enough for the both of them plus extra space for each one. It was an impressive bed, Harry hadn't expected it to be this soft when he sat down.
They spent half the day in the common room. Hermione and Ron had had a little fight and everyone else stared at each other awkwardly, but then they had figured it all out and everything was fine. Hermione was studying for the next exam, that was over a week from then. But she said it would be very important to start a week beforehand. Ron didn't agree and Hermione made a snappy comment and then they started fighting again.
?" Hermione repeated surprised when Harry sat back down next to her.
"Good. Well, I don't have a problem with you being Malfoysexual... it's
He wasn't exactly lying, he
"You heard me right, Potter. I said I'll come.", he answered and before Harry asked why, Draco added: "Always time for you, darling."
"Yep," Potter said and quickly looked away, "I'll go get ready too."
"Your friend Nott said to me-", Harry swallowed, "You know, when we left, he said to me that I should keep imagine that you like me, because you don't."
"What thing?", Potter asked.
"Sure. And that way you can spend time with the both of us. I mean he's still a baby."
worried. I'm his best friend."
"I didn't say that.", Harry disagreed.
? How come?", the woman asked.
Potter looked at him.
He showered, this time he didn't lock the door on purpose. He hoped Draco would come in and he did.
"I don't know, Petunia.", Vernon answered.
"Go on," Malfoy answered.
"If you think so.", she said.
"And you know he is a Death Eater?" The minister asked again.
"Hey." Malfoy greeted her back.
"Well, Malfoy does," Hermione mumbled.
"Um... I took a shower and then I unpacked my stuff. I wrote a letter to Pansy and my mother and I've revised some stuff from sixth year. It was quite a busy day for me." Draco lied and Blaise nodded understanding.
!", Draco shouted at Harry. He was walking towards the door. Harry glanced at him.
"I mean, I love how you paint.", Harry said and kissed Draco, "And some rooms are too dark and black, so when you would paint on them, it would be a lot more beautiful."
"I love you, Potter, because you make me feel strong. I thought I wouldn't have anyone anymore, but despite all of the things we went through, you were there for me and loved me anyway. You are the most generous person I have ever known, you are kind, loving and honest. You make me want to be a better person. I vow to support you in everything you do, I vow to honor you and care for you and I vow to be true and faithful till our last day. We wasted so many years, but I don't want to waist another minute."
"Harry, I'm-", Hermione started, but Harry held up a hand to shush her.
"Let's go and find one last outfit and if that doesn't work, we'll go to Lacoste." Harry said.
"I know, okay? I know. But something has changed, don't ask me what. I don't understand it myself!", answered Harry loudly.
"Are you in trouble, Harry?" Hermione asked and Harry heard the worry in her voice.
Hermione smiled. "Thank you, boys."
Harry didn't know what to do. He wanted to believe him, but he didn't know if he could. "You're drunk." Harry said.
"You just put three different things on your face."
. He hurried away before Potter had finished writing his name and he knew Potter would be too nice to just let those two fans hanging while he hurried after Draco Malfoy.
Harry didn't read the rest of the letter, he put it on the couch table and sat down next to Malfoy, putting his arm around him. Harry looked at Malfoy. He had never seen him so broken. Without saying a word, Malfoy got up and walked towards the hallway.
He spoke directly to Potter, ignoring the ugly faces of the two others. Potter did so too. He grabbed his books and joined Draco.
"Hey, are you okay?", he asked and Harry nodded wordless.
"I won't.", he said.
"Let go of me, filth!", Draco said loudly and shook his hand off.
"What's going on here?", Malfoy asked and looked at Harry.
like them?" He asked and Harry shrugged. He thought it was really cool of Neville that he didn't immediately jump to say "her" but "them".
"But they also show that you were attacked. To survive is not to live," Draco said. He was feeling very sensitive right now.
"Ron!" Hermione said in shock, clearly audible for her three friends and two people at another desk.
"Ron?", he asked and walked towards him, but Ron made one step back.
"And then from King's Cross, we will disapparate to Harry," Weasley said and Draco nodded again.
ready. He just hoped the two would have the courtesy to not mention Malfoy.
With that, he just stalked off. Harry looked after him and when he turned his head back, he found everyone still staring at him. So Harry just started walking downstairs, in expectation that everyone followed him. And that they did.
Harry didn't really know what to do. He looked at Malfoy who stood still, looked at the sky and smoked his cigarette. Harry sighed.
Harry placed everything on the floor and started brewing. He had read about this potion in his sixth year in the book Advanced Potion Making.
"I can't do this right now." Harry said as he sat down on the sofa, still cradling Teddy in his arms.
Half an hour after Harry found out about Ron and Hermione's stupid invitation, he still found himself looking through the room, searching for the flash of blonde hair.
"Draco, you too," Molly said and before Malfoy could disagree, she waved and closed the door.
Draco enjoyed the ridiculous play. If this would be in a theatre, he wouldn't even pay two sickles for it. Draco shook his head snorting.
"No need to try to be nice, Potter." Malfoy mumbled from his dark corner.
"Did you fell down, Potty?", he asked and stuck his head out. Harry stuck his tongue out and laughed.
Harry put on his glasses and sat up as well. "It doesn't matter. He's gone."
"What? It's true.", Hermione answered shrugging.
She leaned over the armrest of the couch and stared at Draco. Two days ago he'd been glad to finally talk to Theo, but now Pansy was here again and she was more annoying than before.
"Weasley let me in. Where have you been?" Malfoy asked again.
Draco's fingers skimmed over the head of Harry's cock and Harry forgot how to speak. How to breathe.
"No?", he asked.
else with him. I love Ron. And I hope he still loves me. I can understand why he is mad at me. I should have told him that I was meeting a boy to study with, but I didn't find it necessary and when I talk about school, Ron just shuts his ears and doesn't even listen. Sometimes I feel like I annoy him, so I went to the library almost every evening so he could do something with you and I don't always be his weight to carry around. Harry, I don't know what to do!"
"I love you too, Draco.", he said and bent forward to kiss him.
"What?" Draco asked and sat up.
"I- I don't want to tell you.", he said and Draco's face dropped.
Harry came back to the surface of the water. Draco clutched Harry's arm and panted. He coughed just as much as Harry did.
"Man fuck you, Potter!" Draco said loudly, "You probably had the happiest childhood as the
"I had not the slightest idea what I should answer to Pansy's question about Slughorn.", Draco said and Potter chuckled quietly.
"So." Harry said, wanting to break the silence and awkwardness.
She nodded, put pen and clipboard away and walked into the room, leaving Harry alone put in the hall again. But not for long, because Malfoy came out just seconds later. He didn't even stop to look at Harry, he just walked straight past him.
Malfoy rolled his eyes, but Harry could see that he was trying to hide his smile behind his glass.
Once they were out of Ron's and Hermione's sight, the two boys went back to the Three Broomsticks. To Harry's surprise Malfoy ordered a hot chocolate instead of the famous Butterbeer.
"Harry, will you join us?"
"Really, don't worry."
Everyone cheered and applauded and Harry felt more embarrassed than ever before. Harry saw Malfoy in the first row looking around when everyone started singing. Malfoy looked up at Harry, who smiled back at him with red cheeks, and Malfoy started to sing as well. Harry's smile widened. The few people around Malfoy stared at him and at each other when he started singing and Harry had to laugh.
"Now could you leave? I need to take a shower I feel gross," Draco said and shoved Potter out of the bathroom.
Harry opened the messages and started scrolling.
"What's wrong?", Potter asked and turned around to look at Draco, who shrugged. Potter smiled.
Harry let his legs slide down against Draco's, as if he was just getting comfortable, but Draco let out a small sound and shifted on the bed, so that their hips brushed together for a moment. Harry's heart was jittering in his chest, but his erection was rock solid. He had no idea what he was going to do. He looked at Draco, who looked as nervous as Harry felt.
Harry felt sick today. He slumbed out of the bathroom. Malfoy sat on his bed and stared out of the window.
afraid of him and Malfoy. But every time Harry talked to someone there, whether he knew them or not, they seemed nice to him and not out of fear. But his intoxication could mislead him, who knew?
After his mother had convinced Draco that the Manor wasn't the best place for him anymore, Draco had left her with a heavy heart and moved in with Theo. It still made Draco sad thinking about his mother never leaving the giant house in which she was all by herself. And besides, he hated Theo's small rudimentary flat.
"Guess he got away for good." Harry said and Hermione shot him an outraged look. "What? I'm just saying if you're over forty and get locked up for twenty years-"
Harry laughed at that sentence, but Ron only grunted and shoved Harry's shoulder.
He knocked carefully and peeked inside. The room was empty.
"You know, Hermione, Harry loves him and I think you should respect that. And besides, Malfoy doesn't seem this bad when he had someone he loves.", Ron said and shrugged.
"And here we have our last man! Blaise, how're  you doing?", Draco asked and gave Blaise Zabini a high-five.
Instead of answering, Draco took off his pullover with trembling hands and revealed a pale chest with many scars as well and the slightly faded Dark Mark on his inner left forearm. Harry froze for a moment and had to take a deep breath - it's been so long since he had seen this Mark. But this showed no longer the evil of Draco Malfoy, this showed his survival, as well as each of their scars. Harry smiled slightly, what made Draco breathe out in relief. Harry closed the gap between them again and kissed Malfoy once more before they undressed completely and stepped into the shower.
Harry and Ron looked at each other, nodded and followed Hermione into the classroom. The teacher looked at them.
"So this was used as Headquarters?", Draco asked and Potter nodded.
"Then listen to me!", Weasel replied with rolled eyes.
"Maybe we should get dressed," Draco suggested. Potter agreed and they got up as quietly as possible. His stupid friends knocked once again.
Draco laughed inside. Weasley needed practice in sneering. Of course, if he wouldn't be
"Thanks, Ron.", he said and Ron smiled.
Draco kneeled on the floor in front of his bed. Everything was blurry and he couldn't think straight. Potter has been gone for hours, the day had gone into night and the moon was making the snow glitter. Draco didn't know what to do with himself.
Kissing Harry was one thing, but crying or nearly crying seemed like a whole other level to Harry. Was Malfoy that comfortable with him now? Or was he just too tired to hold it back? Either way, Harry pulled Malfoy close again and put his arms around his waist. Malfoy buried his face in Harry's shoulder and started to shake a little. Harry slowly reached up to the back of Malfoy's head and carefully placed his hand on his hair. Harry felt Malfoy flinch, but he didn't move, so Harry ran his fingers through Malfoy's soft hair.
"What?", Harry asked, although he clearly understood what Draco had said.
"Don't look at him." Potter said "He is too proud to admit it, maybe even to himself. Look at his family."
Draco also froze and they stared at the door, which slowly opened.
Harry let himself fall on the sofa next to Ron and Hermione, who threw each other a strange look as Harry said these words.
"But-" Hermione started.
Malfoy finally got up, put on his trousers and Harry took Teddy again. When they came through the living room door, the other three sat on the sofa and waited for them.
He hurried through the traveling section and crouched behind spell books for beginners. If Theo would see him like this...
"Snape told me in your first year that there was something strange between you two. In your second year, he told me that the two of you wouldn't stop looking at each other, but I wouldn't believe him. I used to say he's mental and that you'd look at each other because you hate each other, but he only shook his head. In your fourth year, he told me about Potter joining the Triwizard Tournament and that you were utterly confused. He suspected, about not knowing who to support- the Durmstang boy, or the boy who you were supposed to hate. I said it wad probably because of something else-
"What's wrong?" Malfoy asked.
"I can't believe it." Ron said, shaking his head, "That git."
But it was Malfoy that came through the living room door. He looked at Harry and crossed his arms in front of his chest. Harry picked up Teddy.
Without saying another word Draco turned around, showing Potter his well-formed butt and hung up his trousers and shirt. Draco whipped around, just quick enough to catch Potter staring at him and then looking at his hands embarrassed.
shouting now, "How can you like a lying and killing Death Eater-bastard like him?"
Harry looked at Draco and then, something came to his mind.
to each other and we're about to take a shower together, I think it's less weird that you wear my underwear afterwards. It's clean, I promise."
He caught speed and ran up the tower, ignored the confused people in the common room and stormed into his dorm. It was empty. But Harry heard the shower and banged against the bathroom door.
Draco didn't hesitate a second. He punched Blaise in his face with his fist. Blaise's nose bleeded and Draco's knuckles hurt. Potter looked at Draco with a confused and shocked look.
"It is.", Potter disagreed, shaking his head.
"I know. Do you get was I meant yesterday?"
"Now I know. Everything went so fast and I had no time of thinking that it would probably be only a joke or not on purpose and-"
"Yeah, I should.", Harry said and stood up.
"I'd like to do that myself.", Harry answered and Ron nodded again.
The sound of Potter's laugh filled Draco's ears. So very unfamiliar and yet somehow beautiful. Draco ordered another whisky and hoped he would be able to find home with this level of drunkenness - or at least not fall off his broom.
"Are you sure you should smoke right now?" Blaise asked.
"Hey."
"You being at your total limit." Malfoy said amused and laughed.
"I'm not going home over summer. No chance.", answered Draco, taking out a piece of parchment and a quill.
