“So it is.” Draco wasn’t particularly hungry, but the berries were plump and sweet. He managed to eat a respectable amount.
Harry shook his head and tossed the paper aside. “Robards is big on time off. He doesn’t like any Auror getting too attached to a particular case and fixating. I have the weekend off, and technically my part of the case is solved. We found where they were growing and caught people involved. Maybe not everyone, but anyone else is probably in hiding at the moment. Better to wait a couple of days anyway.”
Draco kissed him lightly on the cheek. 'You are unbelievably thoughtful,' he said with awe in his voice. 'I always hoped that it meant you felt something more than friendship for me, but I could never be sure.'
She'd been clearing her throat since she'd arrived, but Draco had assumed that was because she'd sprinted in late from her family holiday and was hardly the athletic type. But the occasional coughing had slowly progressed so that Draco was forced to move farther away from her, which unfortunately had meant moving closer to Potter. He didn't want to be near Potter, but he didn't fancy getting coughed on either. Potter was the lesser evil.
So far they had found living together surprisingly easy. Draco seemed to delight in the fry-up Harry made daily for breakfast, and Harry was always pleased to discover a pot of stew simmering on the back burner for lunch. Draco had a talent for the subtle cleaning Charms best used on clothing and linens, and he seemed impressed at Harry’s Scouring Charms in the kitchen and bath.
“You can't come in the field! You're a
of my friends to be there. You
"I guess I should thank you, Malfoy."
Draco took a cautious step into the room.  “I’m sorry,” he repeated.
The shower was surprisingly comfortable.  They cleaned each other as if they'd done it a dozen times and then wrapped themselves in fluffy towels until they were dry.  It was weird to simply hang up the towel without getting dressed, but Harry was glad to have the view of Draco's body restored after the bloody towel hid him away.
“You ready?”  Harry clutched the Floo powder tightly in the hand not on Draco’s shoulder.  His stomach was in loops from all of the Portkey and Floo travel he’d done that day, and this was the final step.  One more Floo and they’d be at the Burrow.  Draco was probably thinking the same thing as he chewed at his lower lip.  Harry squeezed his shoulder again.
Draco let his lip curl up in disgust. He worked with Bill Weasley, who was surprisingly charming and even easy on the eyes—for a ginger—but Draco was a long way from wanting to make nice with the Weasel and Weaslette.
“Why a hotel?”
The thought of being able to stand up the most eligible bachelor in Britain gave Draco a rush of power he hadn't felt in years. He remembered the last time he'd had that feeling—fifth-year on the Inquisitorial Squad—and realised that his fifteen year old self would have made sure to break things off with Potter in the most humiliating and public way possible just to watch him suffer.
* * *
Potter looked at him as if he had grown another head or two. “Please don’t call me Mr Potter. It’s just weird. Harry is good.”
Harry took Draco’s arm.  “Come on, Draco.  Time to go home.”  Draco’s grey eyes were wide and slightly panicked.  If Dave noticed, he didn’t say a word as Harry half dragged Draco from the inn.  They walked across the road and up the stairs in silence.  Once inside their flat, Draco tried to kiss him.
“Kreacher brought sandwiches. I figured you might be sick of soup.” He gave a little smile. A private kind of smile, like one would share with a friend over a secret joke.
got told off in the cold darkness. And why was it so bloody cold in August? It felt like the whole world was against him.
Now, as Harry sat with his friends at the Leaky, Harry was on high alert, checking the door whenever it opened in case he needed to make a quick escape.
“Yes,” he bit out as he waited for the real mocking to begin.  He wondered if Draco would make him move out.  Maybe he would tell Charlie he didn’t feel safe living with Harry anymore.  Harry dropped his eyes to the floor as he imagined the whole team learning about his perversion.
Toby nodded. “Yeah. About Muggle fashion. He works with us a lot at Games and Sports when we’re trying to set up major events. We don’t want a lot of wizards in wonky clothes attracting Muggle attention.” Harry thought back to the Quidditch World Cup and had to agree that wizards could use some help with dressing like Muggles. “He works with the Aurors, too, but probably not Muggle-raised ones like you.”
“Yes. Let’s do more of that. Shagging. Talking. Eating. Stuff without parents.” He nodded emphatically and was relieved when Draco nodded back.
Draco's rising panic was interrupted by a tapping at his window. Cursing, Draco threw off his covers and dragged himself from bed. Damn owl better have a good excuse for interrupting a perfectly good morning-after-freak-out.
A plump woman who instantly put Harry in mind of Mrs Weasley came into view. “She’s got you there, Draco. That’s what I was always told as a girl. ‘Find one the size of your ‘ead.’ And that’s ‘ow I bake ‘em.”
At the edge of the village, leaning against the first building in the western row, was a large shed with the words “Rent-A-Broom” printed on the front. The broom lurched towards it like a horse who'd finally seen his stable.  Beside the shed, a figure stood waving.  As he approached, Harry could see a jolly, red-faced wizard who reminded Harry of Father Christmas.
This was the time to run to the bedroom. This was the time to leave. It wasn’t fatal, just uncomfortable. Potter would be fine on his own.
"Yes. Yes, I do."
Harry was grateful Auror training had included a course on dealing with the press. His instructor had indoctrinated them with several tactics Harry called up to assist him. First was to never answer a yes or no question—or in this case a true or false question—directly. “Use your own words,” the instructor had told them time and again. “If you only use your own words, they might occasionally print them.”
“She’s a Squib, right?”
“Have you decided on a name?” There. Draco would show interest. Be the bigger pers--species.
“Is there any
“Are you talking about me, Draco?” The woman asked, confirming Harry’s suspicion that this must be Aida.
“Of course he’s named after a constellation,” Ron muttered.  “Of all the pretentious . . .”  He suddenly looked up at Harry.  “No offence to Sirius,” he said hastily.  Harry shook it off with a smile; Sirius had been the first to admit his family’s pretensions.
”Will you take it off if I say ’no’?” Harry counters with a half-hearted glare in the blonde’s direction, then sighs again. ”No… I won’t be angry…”
He waits for everyone leave the classroom, then walks up to the front where Professor Snape is arranging his notes.
The whole atmosphere in the room seems different too. More relaxed than before. People are chatting amongst themselves happily, but Crouch looks just as sour as he always does…
He twists around in his seat and grabs a book from the counter behind him and gently slides it across the table. Harry stares at it, his cheeks so hot he can barely feel them at all anymore.
”, Lucius says coldly.
Soft but clear in the dense silence of the lake, he can make out snippets of musical notes — as he continues to swim towards the sound, he begins to recognise the song from the golden egg, except sung by even more voices now and twice as eerie in this underwater setting,
”We believe you”, Remus says immediately, his voice gentle and kind even though his eyes are clearly haunted.
”You know, I seriously despair”, Umbridge says loudly, sweeping her rather manic eyes across the stunned class. ”Of the level of incompetence and recklessness that you…
”I d-don’t know!” Ginny wails. ”I just found it amongst my textbooks and thought mum had got it for me!”
”Yes, my Lord”, Lucius says fiercely, his eyelids fluttering with relief. ”You have no idea…”
”Some adults use a spell for
”He won’t be able to do anything about it”, Blaise murmurs. ”Come on, be realistic… think Dumbledore wanted her here in the first place? The Ministry isn’t in Dumbledore’s pocket anymore, so if they want to interfere with Hogwarts, there’s nothing he’ll be able to do about it.”
Harry shakes his head. He hadn’t been looking at the monster’s feet, after all.
”Right”, Draco says, his voice oddly choked. ”I remember…”
”To be fair”, Ron says. ”No-one even knew if you were going to wake up again, so they were probably just dead worried, you know? My mum is just the same when she worries. She could out-shout banshee…”
Remus shoots his husband a sharp look.
”Mr Malfoy… I wanted to give you something…” Harry pants and thrusts the sock-clad diary into Lucius’ hand.
Remus eyes flicker to a point over Harry’s shoulder and his smile widens. He gives Harry a final, quick peck on the forehead and then takes a step back and raises a hand in greeting. Harry has barely turned all the way round when he’s enveloped in a pair of long, lean arms and pulled against an even leaner body. The scent of coconut and peppermint settles over him and he inhales happily, hugging the other boy back.
”So… what’s—?”
Blinking in the sudden light from the evening sun in his direct eyeline, he releases the breath again slowly, as he looks around. Hundreds of faces are staring down at him from all sides. And at the other end of the small enclosure, the Hungarian Horntail lies crouched protectively over her clutch of eggs, her yellow eyes shining back at him… She draws her furled wings closer to her body and thrashes her spiky tail restlessly over the ground… Harry gulps as he stares at the deep gouge marks left behind as the tail curls back again, before bearing down on the ground once more…
Professor Snape shakes himself from his stupor and steps forward, handing the Headmaster a small glass phial containing a clear liquid.
”Or I can call it, if you prefer?”
like a big deal — and he wants Draco to share it with him.
Harry bristles…
Remus gives Harry his stern look, as if expecting him to protest. But Harry doesn’t really care about going back on the Hogwarts Express. Of course, he might feel differently tomorrow…
Harry thinks.
Professor Snape suddenly springs to his feet and swirls around to stand next to his chair and before Harry has even registered what’s happened, he’s got his wand in his hand. Harry starts, blinking at the wand apprehensively.
putting on a show.”
”Unforgivables… The Imperius…
He’s not the only one though. There’s not a single person in the room who isn’t at least tipsy and most of them are wasted. Pansy has disappeared somewhere, so Draco is now resting quietly against the cushions next to him, his eyelids beginning to droop.
The blonde swallows thickly.
They reach the door and Harry wrenches it open, diving inside and then immediately staggering back as he sees the door in front of them open and another Death Eater bursting through.
Harry follows him excitedly as he walks over to the bed and points to a particular picture pinned to the wall underneath a large poster of a muggle racing car.
”So we’ve been taught Defence by a Death Eater this whole year…” Seamus says. ”That’s rich… Hey, he could have killed you any time. Why didn’t he?”
”Yes, Sir”, Harry mutters impatiently, feeling his mind already threatening to wander away. ”What — sorry, Sir — but, what kind of lessons will you be giving me, exactly?”
The toothless werewolf turns into a massive spider with savagely clicking pincers, that —
Clearly not trusting Harry to be able to keep his focus for long, Professor Snape stalks to the front of the classroom and lowers himself into the seat behind his desk. Harry glances up at him, but quickly returns his focus to grinding the beetle eyes into a fine powder when he receives one of the Potions Master’s deadliest glares in return.
Draco nods. They start walking again, following the tunnel deeper and deeper. It turns, then turns again and then finally they reach what at first appears to be a dead end, except there is a carving on the wall depicting two entwined snakes with emerald eyes… Harry swallows convulsively, trying to dislodge his heart from where it’s hiding just behind his Adam’s apple… He knows what he has to do, and this time he doesn’t have any trouble pretending the snakes are real — looking at one of the emeralds, Harry has the unpleasant feeling that he’s actually staring into a real, live eye —
Remus swallows a sigh, but doesn’t say anything.
And now … now, he’s faced with the possibility, the
Harry fumbles with the blankets and scrambles out of the bed, barely registering the alarmed look on his daddy’s face before he launches himself into his arms. There is a moment of hesitation before Harry feels the man return the embrace, but he’s too upset to think much of it… his daddy must be just as shocked as he is…
The compartment door slides open and a girl with bushy brown hair and quite large front teeth marches inside, followed closely by a tearful-looking chubby boy.
so shrugging to himself, he opens the end of the cardboard tube and shakes out a rolled-up magazine.
”I believe that’s what I said”, Snape mutters. ”The rest of you hurry up, or you’ll be late for Charms…”
”Harry, if you and Draco are finished, why don’t you take Draco into town and have a look at the market? We’ll have your treacle tart for tea instead!”
have a career, you know”, Sirius says with a pointed look. ”Just because he put it on hold so he could focus on home-schooling you—”
He said hello to Millicent at some point in first year, but only recieved a suspiscious glare back and since then he’s avoided the girl as much as possible. Come to think of it, he’s avoided all contact with Crabbe and Goyle as well, ever since the two of them accompanied Draco to his and Ron’s carriage on the Hogwarts Express and tried to pick a fight. Of course, he should have forgiven the two boys for this the minute he forgave Draco, especially considering they were probably just doing what the blonde told them to do, but for some reason Harry has never really felt the same need for a clean slate with Crabbe and Goyle…
okay?”
”Can you speak English”, Harry mutters.
A memory of sitting next to Mad-Eye Moody (or at least he thought it was Moody at the time) on a cold bench, discussing the first task in the Triwizard Tournament, flutters to the front of his mind.
”Mr Lord!” Wormtail gasps, sitting up and cowering slightly, his whole body trembling. ”My Lord, I am — I am so pleased — so pleased and s-sorry!”
”If you don’t tell them by the end of this term, I will have to”, Snape tells him firmly. ”Now. Occlumency.”
”Harry, mate…” Seamus croaks and gives him a pleading look. ”This is all a joke, right? You’re playing a practical joke on us all, yeah?”
”As you can see from my note”, Umbridge ploughs on undeterred. ”Harry has
Harry’s shackles immediately go up and he quickly scans the area for any signs of blood-thirsty beasts but only finds a several wooden crates at Hagrid’s feet and he starts to relax again, until he hears what sounds like a series minor explosions coming from a few of them. Next to him, Draco jumps and takes a couple of cautious steps back.
”Christmas”, Draco repeats drily. ”Hilarious…”
”Ill?” Harry echoes, his heart thudding faster and faster in his chest as his thoughts race through his head,
”Yeah”, Seamus says. ”Yeah, I will, sorry…”
Professor Snape gives the young an unimpressed look as he pockets his wand again.
”Of course”, Dawlish snaps, turning his frown on Sirius instead. ”A young man is
”How many times do I have to tell you”, he mutters.
”Well, yes, one could argue that, I suppose…” the ghost says slowly, peering in astonishment at Granger as though he’s never really seen a student before. ”However, the legend of which you speak is such a very
”I don’t know what to tell you…”
When he feels hot flesh pressing against the tip of his already leaking cock, a wave of fresh arousal runs through him. And when that flesh begins to open up and give way… When it begins to
He blinks the tears from his eyes and frowns as Sirius worried face comes into focus in front of him, just before a hand lands heavily on top of his shoulder.
He rubs the sleep from his eyes and reaches for his glasses on the nightstand. Draco is standing next to the bed, dressed already, and when he bends down to plant a butterfly kiss on Harry’s lips, Harry gets a whiff of his coconut shampoo.
— You are not manipulating this to your advantage, Dumbledore — HE IS JUST A
”—if you can call it a house—!”
In the next moment, he sees the three Weasley brothers take their own seats further up the aisle, confirming Remus’s suspicion that they’d been the last to arrive. He can see Granger sitting in the same row, presumably Ron’s date for the day. Next to her, Mister and Mrs Weasley are sitting along with an old, grumpy-looking witch.
”Okay… then I dare you to… kiss…” Ron says slowly and Blaise snorts, shaking his head in amusement. ”Every person in this room that you’ve had sex with.”
”Okay, I’ve been dying ask”, Blaise says immediately, pinning Draco with an intense look. ”I didn’t want to in front of the girls, in case, I don’t know—”
”Professor Dumbledore”, he says in a loud voice. ”Excuse me, Sir? Can you hear me?
Remus and Sirius nod sympathetically, but they don’t look remotely shocked by anything he says, not even the part about men in masks torturing muggles. Harry frowns. Could his dads really have suspected something like that might happen? Or why aren’t they more surprised?
”Ah, yes, Ron’s the same… it’s all fun and games still… but you’ve got your O.W.Ls this year”, Mr Weasley says knowingly. ”It’s all about to change now…”
”Ehm, I don’t really know how … I haven’t got my license yet and—”
The golden eagle says nothing, just jumps aside to reveal the revolving staircase. Harry takes a deep breath and hops on, letting the staircase take him to the top landing. He steps off lazily and raps on the door, allowing himself another deep breath before turning the doorknob even after Dumbledore’s booming voice calls out for him to enter.
Harry swallows thickly, his fingers twitching slightly with the tension of trying
”And who will listen to a little boy like yourself? No, I think this is just ploy to escape out of the Forest, but I cannot deny my children fresh meat when it wanders so willingly into our midst…”
, it’s not just professors and the odd special guest, but
”It’s important”, Harry tells Diggory firmly.
”I will”, Harry promises, his chest pinching at the thought of the words etched into his hand. ”I promise I’ll stay out of trouble for the rest of the year!”
Also, I know McLaggen tries out for the Keeper position in his seventh year and that he couldn't try out at all in his sixth year. But it's never mentioned if he was on the team before that, so I figured, if the Seeker position was the only available one this year, he might as well have gone for that and with Harry in Slytherin, he would be a good alternative since he's a good flier and has got quick reflexes... So yeah. That was the thought process behind that choice. In case you were wondering.
”There is another power that I believe will help you conquer Lord Voldemort… One that I will be able to supply you with and where these lessons of ours come in…”
Once again, he’s come to kneeling on the uncomfortably hard floor of the Potions Master’s office, after having had his mind poked and prodded while having to endure an onslaught of jumbled memories, most of them from when he was younger but none of them very pleasant — it was all skinned knees, broken bones, nightsmares and Remus telling him off for not doing what he’s told and putting himself in danger at Hogwarts — and then of course, there was the odd embarassing memory as well…
”Do we open them here?” Draco asks.
”Harry says there was a house-elf in his room”, Sirius says, then looks at Harry again. ”It wasn’t Kreacher, was it?”
When Harry floos back home, both his dads are waiting for him in the kitchen, looking slightly apprehensive until Harry beams at them.
”Of course I did”, Draco says dismissively and bounces slightly on the balls of his feet, wringing his hands anxiously as he watches Harry step into his boots. ”Come on, I’m starving!”
”Me too…”
”Just thinking.”
”Harry —!”
”Nothing”, Harry says quickly. ”It’s fine…”
Umbridge continues to terrorise Hogwarts, and the Slytherins are at the end of their rope...
”Lovely… Mr Bagman, I wonder…” she murmurs, still without tearing her eyes away from Harry. ”Could I perhaps have a quick word with Harry before we start? The youngest champion — the fourth champion — you know, to add a splash of colour to the piece?”
”Sirius”, Remus murmurs with a gently warning tone. ”Behave…”
”POTTER!”
And then he ends the letter by saying:
Remus pats him gently on the head, then walks over to the doorway and squeezes past Sirius. The other man backs up slightly against the doorframe to let him pass, then stays like that for a moment, looking between the hallway and Harry’s bedroom floor uncertainly, hands shoved deep in his trouser pockets.
”— and I want you to write ’I must not tell lies’, all right?”
They all kick off the ground again and resume their positions. Harry soars above the rest of the team, warily watching out for the rogue bludger while desperately trying to catch a glimpse of something golden.
Harry lets out a shocked guffaw and whips his head around to stare at Seamus and Draco. The delight on the Irish boy’s face as he claps his hands and laughs uproariously, is enough to tell Harry that he had no idea that was about to happen. Likewise, the proud smirk on Draco’s face tells him that the blonde knew exactly.
Draco frowns at him.
— saying his name really isn’t that big of a deal anymore…
them.”
”I thought we were supposed to be be inconspicuous”, Remus counters kindly and gives the man a tired smile. ”It’s fine, Pads. We’ll be fine. They’re not little boys anymore—”
”Oh… well, I… I don’t know, do I?”
”—But how”, Dumbledore continues. ”I cannot say.”
”But you should have heard her, daddy!” Harry exclaims. ”She was saying nasty things — really awful — about you — she called you horrible things, she said — said — I don’t want to repeat what she said, but it was just awful, evil—”
The redhead frowns.
Blaise and the two girls circle the table and settle down opposite the three of them just in time for Harry and Draco to both answer the question, then give each other a mutinous look when the answers don’t match.
”Yeah, that sounds like a great time”, Sirius says and ruffles Harry’s already windswept hair. ”So are you feeling better about—?”
”Albus told me everything you told him and… And we don’t know if this is an effect of Voldemort possessing you—”
”Yeah, I mean, I don’t have any exams to sit anyway and… well, I don’t really fancy being the school pariah again…”
The blonde nods quickly, lips pinched together and eyes wild with fear, but Harry is proud to see him leaping off the stairs and running out of sight without hesitation. Harry turns around and starts running as well, skidding along the floor as he rounds the corner at the end of the corridor, quickly running past the door of the Defence classroom, hyper-aware that Umbridge might be inside.
”Hear me out—”
He curls his arm around Harry’s shoulders and steers him off the pitch. Draco hurries to keep up with them and stays close to Harry’s side all the way to the Hospital Wing.
”Problem, Mr Potter?”
and their
Flint seems unusually chipper when they gather around him and Harry can only imagine how Ron’s first practise with the Gryffindor team had gone for their Captain to be in such a cheerful mood… but it can’t have been pretty, Harry thinks and he resolutely avoids looking at Draco for the duration of Flint’s pep talk, because he doesn’t want to see the blonde come to the same conclusion, and react to it.
They melt together and make out for what feels like hours, yet no time at all at the same time and Harry could easily stay in the embrace indefinitely, if it wasn’t for the cool breeze from the slightly uneven window panes and the goosebumps on every patch of his skin that doesn’t touch Draco’s. The other boy must have felt him shiver, because his caresses turn from slow and sensual to more of a brisk rubbing and then he breaks the kiss again and steps away. Harry shivers in earnest then.
It’s like the final piece of a jigsaw puzzle slides into place before his eyes, except he doesn’t want it there. But the picture is there now, glaringly clear in front of his face and there is no way to unsee it.  Suddenly it all makes sense. His daddy’s
understand what Draco’s telling him, he just doesn’t want to.
”Oh, Harry… There are none…
”Draco!”
Harry nods his understanding and blows on his tea.
Harry nods in understanding. They’ll need to be very careful…
Harry rugby tackles her and they end of sprawled on the floor together in an undignified pile of flailing limbs.
and — he was all alone, daddy! It’s just not fair—!”
”Nothing”, she shakes her head. ”You’re right. I’m sure they’ll let you stay here until it’s all figured out, I mean… How else is Professer Snape meant to teach you, right?”
Harry just shakes his head, ”Hagrid, you can’t
Seamus —!”
”Nothing.”
”Stop!” Harry gasps and startles awake, twisting in the sheets and then startling once more when he sees a blurry figure towering over him.
”Yeah”, Harry gushes. ”It’s awesome! But am I allowed to be in here?”
LIFE -- is the answer to your question.
”I know you feel bad for him, Harry”, Sirius says. ”And I know you — like him — for some reason I’ll never understand, and I’m trying to come to terms with that — but I will never be able to be friends with Snape, okay? And believe me, that feeling is mutual. There’s just too much history between us, way more than you know and I’m not going to tell you about it now, but — It’s complicated—”
The floor trembles as something heavy hits it.
”There’s nothing wrong with my ability to concentrate!”
”Where are you going?” Draco asks, sounding nearly alarmed at the idea of Harry going anywhere.
He squeezes past the Ex-Auror awkwardly and stops just inside the door. Dumbledore is sitting behind his massive desk and Cornelius Fudge is standing next to him, wearing his pinstriped cloak and fidgeting with his lime green bowler hat.
Harry swallows thickly as he tries to think —
he thinks incredulously.
Sirius squeezes onto the bed next to Harry and slings his arm around him, hugging him into his side and kissing his temple. Remus leans over and kisses him smack on his forehead, before handing him the small pile of presents from the foot of the bed so he can sit there.
”Gerroff—!” Draco snaps, flinching away from him.
in this scenario and bristling at the idea.
Harry thinks, scanning the crowd,
But Harry isn’t even listening anymore, because Draco has stopped in front of the sofa where he and Seamus are sitting and is smirking down at him like they share a secret that no-one else can know — and maybe they do, but whatever it is, Harry can’t possibly think of it now because his brain has gone all funny…
Harry catches Draco glance over at the hufflepuff fifth-year as well and then immediately begin blush.
Remus rolls his eyes, but the smile on his face remains stubbornly in place, even though he tries to smooth it out, ”I swear, you become more and more like your dad every day…”
”Salazar Slytherin was a Parselmouth too. He was famous for it. That’s why we have a serpent as a symbol… and, like I said, it’s a very rare gift, and it’s, you know… hereditary…”
”Er… Yeah…” Harry nods hesitantly.
”Harry, hang on”, Remus says when they exit the shop and grabs his arm gently when he tries to walk off down the street. ”Stop — hey — look at me…”
”What—” Harry begins again, but stutters to a stop when he feels slender fingers push past the waistband of his pyjama bottoms. ”What… what are you doing?”
”Yeeees!” Harry shouts back, pushing himself up to sitting.
”, he hears Blaise murmur behind him just before the door closes.
… Harry can’t see a thing in the darkness inside the closed bed hangings, but he just knows that it’s Draco behind him, embracing him, nuzzling the back of his neck — he can’t put his finger on what it is, if it’s the way their bodies fit together, or how he feels safe and at home, but he just knows that Draco is behind him —
Draco pulls a bucktoothed face behind her back and Pansy and Daphne dissolve in half-muffled giggles.
Sirius says nothing for a long time, but finally shakes his head with a frustrated sigh and rubs at his own eyes rather aggressively.
” he adds hurriedly. ”If he’s right and I
”Is this about what the Malfoy boy said?”
But more immediately, he’s agonising over how they’re to get all their school supplies without visiting Diagon Alley. Sirius, currently the most level-headed of the four of them, has been reassuring him that they’ll be fine, claiming they’ll be safer in the midst of Diagon Alley than they are walking between the cottage and the Three Broomsticks.
”Nothing… everything”, Draco says, chuckling a little and shaking his head. ”I just got to thinking, while I was waiting for you… Umbridge, detentions… even this”, he holds up is hand in a half-hearted wave and Harry’s stomach churns at the sight of the scratched up skin, even if the cut has at least healed over now. ”It’s nothing —
”No need”, the other man says swiftly, avoiding Harry’s eyes as he begins to sort through the different pamphlets on his desk.
… he’s on his stomach in a long, dark, empty corridor, sliding along the stone floor effortlessly, glancing around him surreptitiously…
Hagrid is just as close to cracking, acting even more distracted than normal and even jumpy during lessons, and he’s constantly losing the thread of what he’s saying and answering questions wrongly, his eyes darting between the Dark Forest and Umbridge’s clipboard anxiously.
Harry holds his breath plunges his face into the swirling, silvery substance. He lands in front of a much younger, slimmer and less balding Professor Slughorn. He blinks in surprise and takes a step back. The man is sitting in the same winged armchair that Harry has seen in his quarters now, grasping a wineglass in one hand and picking his way through a box of crystallised pineapple with his other.
of triumph as he realises the book is even divided into sections separating
”Right”, Harry says awkwardly.
”Ah, is this about Draco again”, Sirius says knowingly.
big ask…”
”The difference is barely noticeable! How are we even having this conversation?”
That is, until he gets back to the Common Room and sees Draco, Pansy and Daphne huddled together in the corner and accidentally locks eyes with the blonde boy for a second, before he quickly looks down and frowns at the sketch book in front of him, looking like a kicked puppy… Pansy and Daphne shoot Harry a set of thunderous glares that makes him feel all of three inches tall and he swallows a sigh.
”Come on, Draco”, Pansy says, sitting back down and Vanishing the pumpkin juice from the table top. ”We’re going to find out anyway, and you know it…”
”Draco, for fuck’s —!”
Harry just shakes his head and grins at his boyfriend.
”This is the only vision you’ve had since the one of Mr Weasley?” he asks again.
”No-one needs to know, Harry…”
He sits up and looks around, but it’s pitch black around him so he can’t make out a single thing. Instead he feels around at whatever he’s landed on… It’s some kind of a plant.
”Oh, you know, she’s fine. Well, except for everything that’s happened. She was really broken up about Mrs Norris, even though I told her, we’re all much better off without her, but you know… Ginny loves cats so… I told her not to worry, that the nutter who did will get caught and be out of here in no time!”
Lockhart stares around at his stony-faced colleagues helplessly, but no-one comes to his rescue.
”He always makes me —”
”No, Sir. What is it?”
”They’re making you take another class?
Luna Lovegood is wearing some kind of golden tent and dangling from her ears are a pair of bright purple turnips by the looks of it. Amazingly enough, her outfit looks rather pedestrain next to the colourful display of the man sitting next to her. Harry assumes it must be Luna’s father, Xenophilius Lovegood, the editor of The Quibbler.
Even with the right ingredients and reading each instruction on the board several times to make sure he’s got it right, it’s still by the grace of some miracle that Harry manages to brew a passable potion without causing any obvious accidents or further frustration for Professor Snape. His hands keep shaking and the turmoil of excited butterflies in his belly is making it nearly impossible to focus on anything else.
”Not looking very happy, is she?” Seamus murmurs with relish and Harry nods in agreement.
Remus nods his understanding.
On the morning of the third task, Harry’s nerves finally start to kick in. It’s nowhere near as bad as the panic he’d felt before the first two tasks, more like the butterflies he used to get before a Quidditch game back in Second Year. It’s actually quite a nice feeling, and with adrenaline slowly starting to course through him, Harry is actually excited for this evening!
”Daddy, we’ll wait with you—”
The tension doesn’t ease as they enter Professor Snape’s office either, if anything it gets heavier as they line up in front of the man’s desk, glaring in resentment at the floor in front of them as Moody gives his gruff explanation of why he’s interrupted Snape’s prep time and why two of his Slytherins are standing in front of him like two puppies with their tails between their legs.
”Then go have breakfast”, Sirius counters and stands up. ”I’ll be back with your daddy in twenty minutes, half an hour tops.”
Sirius turns to Remus with a grim look, but the other man just shakes his head.
”Yeah”, Harry mumbles. ”Yeah, I want to try.”
”She wouldn’t sack Professor Snape over a prank…” Seamus says, but he glances around at the others uncertainly.
”I don’t know”, Harry tells her earnestly. ”Guess I’ll find out on Saturday…”
”, Hagrid mutters. ”Ye two go with Fang then, and if ye see anythin’ just send some green sparks up, right?”
Harry raises his eyebrows in surprise when the Gryffindor wizard simply chuckles fondly.
”Sorry, Sir…” Harry mutters.
”What?” Harry half-chuckles nervously.
Draco snorts out chuckle, which sends off a ripple effect of snickers in the group until they’ve all dissolved into peals of laughter.
Harry blinks.
, but everywhere he turns he bumps into someone.
”Yes. The creature that lives in the castle is an ancient one that we spiders fear above all others. As soon as I sensed its presence, I begged Hagrid to let me leave.”
As soon as they reach the dungeons, they slow down their pace.
”No, I’m okay”, Harry says. ”I just want to get inside…”
”What, what is it—?” Harry says, following him.
”Yes, but—”
“Lesson starts, I place the fire whiskey bottle on Slughorn’s desk, then take my seat”, Pansy says in a rush of words and the others quickly follow suit.
Zabini pulls them aside roughly and the other boy swiftly pushes himself back up to sitting and glares back at him.
Harry’s stomach plummets.
”Listen to me, boy…” Moody says quietly and draws his wand. ”I assure you,
”Yeah yeah yeah, but after — after you’ve finished — can you floo them then?”
”Weasley!” Draco exclaims happily. ”Hey, Weasley!”
”Hey, anyone seen Kreacher yet?” one of the twins says suddenly, earning glares from the other three Weasleys.
”ENOUGH! STOP!”
”Cockroach cluster”, the man barks at the stone gargoyle now, and it immediately jumps aside to reveal the revolving staircase behind. ”There… Make sure you tell the Headmaster everything you can remember, Harry. It’s very important.”
Krum gently knocks his shoulder against him. Harry blinks and looks up in confusion.
Harry feels the fingers digging into his shoulder tighten slightly.
”And what makes you think you two will manage to keep it safe if even Dumbledore’s precautions aren’t enough to keep it from getting stolen?”
Harry catches the quick look he exchanges with Adrian Pucey however and thinks the other boy might have had something to do with the Team Captain’s change of heart. He knows better than to comment on it though… Eager to get back out into the Entrance Hall, he wolfs down some scrambled eggs and bacon, barely chewing, just washes it all down with pumpkin juice, much to Draco’s disgust.
”, the man hisses, taking a threatening step closer to Ogden who staggers back another step.
Sirius snorts, ”
A much louder and more enthusiastic round of applause breaks out and Bagman waves happily at them.
”No, you’re not”, Harry mumbles, smiling lazily and blinking his eyes open again.
to let Harry knows it’s okay to join the others for breakfast.
He has no intention of actually approaching Malfoy, but he doesn’t mind getting out of the Common Room, especially if he’s going to be pestered like this…
Harry frowns.
”Hey, I never said—!”
”I love it”, Draco says, his voice a little strangled with emotion.
”See you soon”, Harry says.
Ron laughs and shakes his head slightly, ”Who called Diggory ’dreamy’ then?”
They’re halfway through breakfast — also had in comfortable-ish silence — when Professor Dumbledore shows up for a visit. It’s impossible to tell whether Professor Snape had been expecting him or not, because his face gives nothing away. But he does get up to retrieve a third teacup from the cupboard, so Harry figures he can’t have been expecting him right this minute anyway.
”You know it’s weird, don’t you?” Draco says airly as they make their way towards the third floor after dinner. ”You’re the only Slytherin to socialise with Gryffindors. And it’s not just Slytherin, it’s all the houses. People don’t usually make friends with people from other houses…”
”Someone’s — tampered — with — it”, Bole grunts and hits the bludger with a deafening crunch when it makes yet another attempt on Harry’s life.
”I do know”, Dumbledore confirms calmly. ”Continue, Harry…”
”Okay”, Draco says soothingly, rubbing his arm a few times. ”You want me to go ask Professor Snape for a Pain Potion?”
He bites off a small piece of chocolate and quickly swallows it down. The effect is instantaneous. What can only be described as warmth spreads throughout his body and he immediately regains feeling in his hands and feet. And he hadn’t even realised he’d been nauseous, until now when the sensation subsides and his stomach settles again.
”She’s not allowed to bring her O.W.L. results”, Draco pipes up in a small voice.
”Come on, Moony”, Harry hears Sirius murmurs quietly behind him. ”Try and calm down. We won’t find him by screaming and shouting..”
”Sir…” Harry greets happily.
Harry blinks and turns around. The blonde is grinning smugly and Harry quickly looks down at the paper to see what’s got him in such a good mood…
He swallows thickly and holds his hand out awkwardly for the other man to shake. Remus’s face softens and he grasps Harry’s hand gently in his and simply holds it for a second.
”Whatever”, Harry grouses. ”Let’s just get it over with. What are we meant to be doing, anyway?”
Umbridge scrambles to her feet, both hands still pressed against her face — a face that is rapidly growing red from holding her breath, Harry notices — her bulging eyes desperate and glistening with tears. Just as she reaches the side door another
”Then why can’t he teach him?”
And then he remembers. Diving into Tom Riddle’s memory of when he’d framed Hagrid for the death of Moaning Myrtle, through his diary… He’d been able to walk around inside the memory, but no-one had seen or heard him then either. He’d just been a voyeur inside something that had already happened years and years ago. Something tells him that this is something similar to that. Except he hadn’t dived into a diary this time…
Harry thinks fondly.
He shoves Draco out of the way and staggers to his feet again. He snatches his glasses blindly from the bedside table and puts them on. As soon as Draco comes into focus and Harry can see the hurt look in his eyes, he feels bad.
Sirius curls his hand around his neck and gives it a gentle pull. Remus immediately allows himself to be hugged, burrowing his face into the crook of the other man’s neck.
”Well, we’ve had Professor Sprout, Professor Flitwick and Professor McGonagall, haven’t we? So that leaves Quirrell and Snape — oh, and Dumbledore —”
Harry keeps sinking until he’s slouched so far down his head is almost level with the desk and he feels Professor Snape’s thunderous glare as a pair of bolts of lightening hitting him repeatedly in the head, burrowing deeper and deeper into his mind.
he thinks, his mind flashing back to the last time he was forced to come face to face with the barely human wizard; he shivers thinking about the skeletal, almost serpentine face of his nightmares, with its burning, red eyes…
his friend Seamus, but some weird Gryffindor version of him.
Remus growls something low under his breath, then decides to help himself to another Harry-hug and that seems to finally calm him down.
(See the end of the chapter for
Although Seamus seems awfully comfortable next to Zabini, Harry notices. The two boys are sitting very close, with arms and legs touching unnecessarily, and are happily chattering away. Harry frowns. Could it be that Seamus is better friends with Zabini than him?
”What about… Your Sirius?” he asks him awkwardly. ”Were the two of you—?”
Remus floos first, to check that the coast is clear. Draco stuffs the Invisibility Cloak into his travel robe pocket and then steps into the grate after him. Harry watches his boyfriend begin to spin inside the emerald flames and feels Sirius heavy hand like a comforting weight on the back of his neck.
Harry curls up in his own bed, feeling strangely hollow and heavy at the same time. He presses his eyes shut, but it’s at least an hour before sleep finally takes him.
Harry smiles grimly.
Overcome with excitement, Harry flings himself at his daddy who immediately hugs him back and strokes the back of his head lovingly.
What—
”No”, the ghost whines with a pout. ”I was sitting in the U-bend — thinking about death, you know?”
”Harry!
”Igor Karkaroff”, a cold voice says curtly to Harry’s left and leans forward to see who it is and gasps again, recognising a much younger Barty Crouch, his hair dark and his face less lined. ”You have been brought from Azkaban to give evidence to the Ministry of Magic. You have given us to understand that you have important information for us.”
”Mmm… definitely… I love you.”
”Don’t be sorry”, Remus chides gently. ”Come on… Let’s go get some lunch, and maybe an ice-cream for afters, what do you say?”
he tells himself when the thought flares up,
”It’s only temporary.”
Harry nods, his chest unclenching again.
Harry thinks. That’s the only explanation for his behaviour. Because the man is clearly overcompensating. He keeps brewing hot chocolate and baking treats, all of which he supplies Harry with only to quickly disappear into another room again.
”What?” the blonde murmurs, with a definite smirk on his lips now.
Harry looks over at Draco — the blonde has been unusually quiet for a while — and catches him glaring over at Granger who is now sitting with Ron and Longbottom at the other end of the library.
Harry tries to moan despite Lockhart’s hand squishing his face together, but it comes out as a gurgle.
I’m going to! I
, Harry cautiously edges closer to the wall — but when he realises what the shadow is, he immediately leaps back again, nearly slipping in a puddle of water on the floor and falling over — hanging by her tail from one of the torch’s bracket, is Mrs Norris, caretaker Filch’s cat and deputy, her yellow eyes wide and staring, her body stiff…
”Never mind”, Snape says curtly and turns back to the textbook in front of him on top of teacher’s desk. ”Today we shall discuss…”
”, Professor Snape says immediately. ”He is
You thought he was gorgeous before you knew who it was!”
They all sit together in the living room and wait for Dumbledore and Madam Pomfrey to arrive, sharing a comfortable silence that reminds Harry of his afternoon drinking tea with the other world’s professor Snape. He’s still eager to tell Draco all about that, but he can sense it’s not time yet. There seems to be an unspoken agreement between all of them to not talk about anything that’s happened in the last couple of weeks until after Remus has been reassured by Pomfrey that the space time travel hasn’t left Harry with any permanent damage.
”Harry! Draco! Over here!”
”We were twenty feet above you stopping the other bludger from killing Potter”, Derrick snarls. ”It’s been fixed — it won’t leave him alone, it’s not gone for anyone else all game!”
Several emotions flicker past the older man’s face as he stares down at Harry. Finally he heaves a great sigh and looks away.
McGonagall fumbles frantically for her wand; then with a loud snapping noise, Draco reappears in a trembling heap on the floor, his blonde hair dishevelled and plastered to his pink, sweaty face. Harry’s heart stutters as he watches him push to his feet, wincing in pain.

”Sir down… I’ve just been reading the letter you sent me… My dear boy, I cannot possibly let you stay at school over the summer. Surely you want to go home for the holidays?”
would think? He’s convinced Dumbledore is conspiring against him — this would give him just the excuse he needs!”
Harry beams, letting out a sigh of relief, ”Thank you, Sir…”
The door swings open at his touch and they step into the massive cathedral of a room, it’s high vaulted ceiling arching above their heads and making Harry feel suddenly small, but he pushes the sensation aside. His dad is in trouble, he can’t be small right now —
But then I realised that getting a hold of Slugorn’s memory would be too important for Dumbledore to just give up on that plan, so he would definitely find some other way to persuade him, possibly mentioning casually that he’s just been to Harry’s birthday party and maybe mentioning that he has his mother’s eyes, or something like that…
”Sorry…”
Harry’s stomach flutters as his mind flashes back to dinner in the Great Hall when the blonde had leaned in to whisper in his ear… implying that he wanted — well, wanted
”Yeah. She’s the girl who got killed the last time the Chamber was opened.”
”Yeah, I’ve seen that one”, he comments. ”Remus is awesome…”
”Are you seriously talking about
Then her fingers are digging into Harry’s arm again and before he knows what’s happening, he’s being squeezed from all sides and the woods disappear from around him, his eyes are pushed into his skull and his lunges gripped in a vice… In the next moment, his feet connect with firm ground again and blinking tears from his eyes, Harry looks around and realises he’s standing in the middle of an empty pub. Narcissa lets go of his arm again with such force that he staggers. She gives him a pinched look and points towards a fireplace with some burning embers still left in the grate, and then without so much as a nod in good-bye, she Disapparates again.
”Oh dear… we really are regressing, aren’t we… Let’s try that
”Well, yeah …” Harry says.
Sirius and Remus immediately fall silent as he shuffles over the threshold and Remus shoots up from his seat and hurries over to the stove to pour him some hot chocolate. Even before Harry’s got his hands wrapped around the mug, he feels warmer…
”I am now…” Harry murmurs, his voice involuntarily sinking an octave.
Sirius snorts, and pulls him into a quick one-armed hug.
Harry shakes his head numbly. He could easily glance down at the book and scan the pages for the the answer, and if his daddy was teaching right now he probably would have, but with Professor Snape, that is the best way to earn yourself an acidic insult and Harry doesn’t really feel like being on the receiving end of one of those right now…
They make their way back to the Entrance Hall so they can head outside for Care of Magical Creatures. But before Draco turns the doorhandle of the massive oak doors, Harry reaches out and stops him.
”You’re taking eight N.E.W.T. classes—”
”Oh, yeah, like that innocent act is fooling anyone…
”Of course we will”, Harry says, with a confidence he doesn’t really feel, but the other boy seems to buy it, because his face soften with relief. ”I need to go… I’ll write you—”
”Seriously, what’s up with you?” Pansy hisses, pulling him aside a few days later as they’re all getting ready to the leave the castle for the holidays and pins him with a concerned look. ”Did something happen?”
”What exactly did Mr Crouch say, Harry?” Dumbledore asks as they descend the marble staircase.
”I apologise”, Dumbledore says, inclining his head. ”I wouldn’t normally ask, but I believe it is of utmost importance…”
”What — what-ho, what—?”
”Hermione, let me read your —” Ron says, desperately checking his watch.
”I have two fathers”, Harry says quickly. ”They were best friends with my — well — my real parents, and after they were killed, Sirius and Remus took me in and raised me as their own. They’re really great. I can’t imagine not having them as my parents, actually…”
And sure enough, in a few of the dark windows he can make our faces staring at him. They don’t look at all like any mermaids he’s seen in books or paintings… Their skin is a sickly grey and their long, wild hair a dark green colour which reminds him of the weeds the Grindylows tried to drag him into. Their eyes as well as their broken and uneven teeth are yellow, whereas their fishtails, he notices as a few ventured outside their dwellings to get a better look at him, are silver.
”I would like it if you did”, Harry clarifies.
”I know…” Harry mumbles sleepily.
As if sensing Harry’s eyes on him, Draco looks up and their eyes lock. There is brief moment of surprise in the blonde’s face that makes him look a little less haughty and a little more like the boy Harry fell in love with, but it’s quickly replaced by a thunderous scowl and Harry sighs and looks away again.
”You might as well read the Prophets as well”, Sirius says heavily.
”Draco is all right, though”, Seamus intones seriously and it’s impossible to tell if it’s meant to be a question or a comfort, so Harry just nods again.
The twin gestures towards a small, redhaired girl whom Harry hadn’t even seen at first and he smiles at her. Her face goes beet red within seconds and she quickly looks down, shaking her red hair into her face to hide it.
”Stop pawing at me all the time!” Draco says loudly, his gaze flitting between Harry’s face and the point behind his shoulder — Pansy — getting nearer. ”Weasel over there’s been oogling you ever since we got here, why don’t you go join him if you need someone to hold your hand so badly…”
”Harry, it’s
”What?”
”She did…” Dumbledore says softly. ”And I strongly feel that this was not just some ploy to hired. Her voice changed. Her eyes clouded over. And, more importantly, afterwards she had no memory of making the prediction at all… Which means that I am the only person to have heard the Prophecy in full.”
”Yeah”, Pansy says, lounging back in her seat. ”You know the one… Harry must be the one to defeat He Who Must Not Be Named… You tell him, Harry—”
”Excited to go back to Hogwarts?” Sirius asks.
”Kindly do not interrupt me, Mr Potter. Ever.”
”I quite love cooking”, Harry admits, eager to change the subject back as well. ”It’s even more fun than Potions though, because the worst thing that will happen if I don’t follow the recipe exactly is that it might taste a little differently so there’s really no pressure… Plus you get to taste what you’ve made after you’re done!”
always
”It’s all right, Potter…” Madam Pomfrey says. ”This won’t hurt a bit.”
Harry thinks and relaxes back in his armchair.
”Then what happened, Mr Malfoy?” Dumbledore says gently.
”Good — the fur vanished — the fangs shrank — and he turned back into a man! — simple, yet effective — and another village will remember me forever as the hero who delivered them from the monthly terror of werewolf attacks!”
Harry pulls the memory phial out of his pocket and holds it up for everyone to see. Daphne lets out a small gasp, abandoning the issue of Witch Weekly she’d been flicking through and leans forward for a better look at the swirls of pearly silver memory inside the small container.
”Everything will work out fine, you’ll see…” he murmurs and nuzzles Harry’s hair.
dear!” Umbridge snaps. ”Now, as I was saying, you have been introduced to spells that have been complex, inappropriate to your age group and potentially lethal. You have been frightened into believing that you’re likely to run into Dark wizards every other day, but…” she lets out another tinkle of laughter, except it sounds decidedly strained now. ”How likely is that, really, if you think about it, I mean… who do you imagine would even
Another look passes between the two men.
” Harry gasps, pulling Draco along.
”No I think Seamus is onto something”, Draco says, pulling out of his hug with Blaise to nod in mock seriousness. ”I say keep it up, Seamus. In another six years, she’ll be putty in your hands for sure…”
”How do
”Nothing… I’m tired. I’m going to bed.”
The bundle is moving more and more restlessly at Harry’s feet and Harry feels bile rise in his throat again as the cold, high-pitched voice slithers up from inside the robes, ”
”Sorry guys, I probably know even less than you… I haven’t even been allowed to the house before today…”
”What?” he says.
Harry walks over to the fireplace and looks around for some floo powder and finally finds a box of it on the floor and scoops some up with a shaking hand.
be taught…”
”Speaking of which”, Blaise murmurs. ”You should get going…”
”You okay, cub?”
”Of course”, Remus says calmly. ”But I’m afraid Harry is a little shy. If you wouldn’t mind…”
”This way, Potter”, she says curtly.
The tiny puffs of smoke have now turned into a steady stream of thick smoke that coils in the air, and suddenly the end of it morphs into a serpent’s head that opens its mouth wide, baring its sharp fangs…
Listen to me! Look at me! I am

under her breath to her friend.
But by the time Harry has finished hanging the damp clothes to dry on the washing line outside, there still wasn’t any sign of either of his dads… worry flares up in Harry’s chest as he checks his watch and realises it’s already three o’clock, but he pushes it down firmly and tells himself it’s the first Order meeting in over a week, so they obviously must have a lot to go over, that’s all…
”Then let’s find a way!”
Karkaroff comes over to the Slytherin table, his smarmy smile still in place as he seeks out Krum amongst his students.
Harry feels a weird mix of sadness and excitement. On the one hand, he’s worried about being away from his fathers for so long. He’s never been away from the both of them than a day, and now he won’t see them for months… What if he gets homesick… What if something happens and he feels sad, and Remus won’t be there to comfort him… On the other hand, he is finally going to Hogwarts, something he’s been dreaming about since he was a little kid and Sirius told him stories about his time there.
, wanted to have
”Harry!
Harry startles awake, his scar hurting and hair plastered to his clammy forhead. The damp blanket is clinging to his sweat-soaked skin and Draco’s arms are wrapped tightly around him, one hand caressing his head almost mechanically as he hushes him gently. It’s only then that Harry realises his throat is sore from screaming.
He walks over to the small table where a fresh piece of parchment and the long black quill are laid out for him and plops down on the rickety chair.
Harry falls asleep as soon as his head hits the pillow, but after what feels like merely a second, he’s gently shaken awake again. Blinking the sleep from his eyes, he turns over and peers up at the blurry figure sitting on the side of his bed.
”I said… What are you two talking about?” Draco repeats patiently.
They can hear Flint and Pucey’s voices on the other side of the concealed door and step back from each other just before the wall rearranges itself and reveals the two older boys, still bickering relentlessly.
He lurches forward to burrow into his daddy’s chest and begins to cry softly when strong arms lock around him tightly.
”Chocolate frog, please”, Harry says.
”Why?” Harry whines, really not feeling up for socialising with any Weasley right now. ”Why can’t I just stay here?”
”Harry”, Snape says in surprise.
”What do I care what his name is, he
”All of it… what you said… before in Divination?” the blonde says in a small voice. ”You don’t… you don’t hate me?”
, he thinks furiously.
Skeeter’s eyes are almost the same size as Loony Lovegood’s once it’s out of Harry’s mouth and they flit between him and Draco eagerly. Harry can picture the headlines composing themselves in her head…
”Oh, like I was going to put my name forward”, Harry mutters sarcastically.
Harry feels his face heat up in embarrassment, but keeps smiling.
”I reckon Ron’s onto something, though. That cat is way too smart—”
”But we’ve already been inside”, Malfoy pipes up, then immediately shrinks back with a blush.
”How was the ball?” Remus asks him as they enter the kitchen.
”Because — You and James—!”
As they get to the Quidditch Stadium, the pitch is completely unrecognisable. The nearest hedge now stands at twenty feet tall, with only a small opening in the middle of it — the entrance to the massive maze — and looking through it, Harry shivers slightly at the darkness that lies beyond.
She turns and fixes her pale eyes on him, but her face remains unreadable and she continues to pace back and forth across the path, blocking the way forward.
Harry shuts his mouth again with a snap and hops down from the footstool.
Harry doesn’t know what to say to that, but a simple
”Ah…” Dumbledore says, inclining his head. ”Forgive me, Harry. I did not mean to imply a correlation between your House and Tom Riddle’s… inclinations.”
He remembers the Umbridge of the other world, frazzled and paranoid in the Hospital Wing and Ron Weasley telling him that the other Harry and Granger had lured her into the Dark Forest and got her abducted by the centaurs.
Harry follows them and watches anxiously from the doorway as Sirius lowers his husband onto the sofa, where the other man slumps back against cushions with a weary sigh.
Harry feels like he’s swallowed a heavy weight.
Harry smiles a little. He sits watching the chess game for a moment, but grows bored after a while and being so obviously ignored is making him feel lonely. He looks around forlornly, wishing his friends were here… His heart skips a beat when he spots Seamus across the room, but he quickly reminds himself that this is
”Yeah, that — well, so is flying. So let’s go for a fly!” Harry grins.
The next morning Harry is woken up with the traditional belting out of
, but the girl has already turned away again.
”I’m sorry, Harry…” she murmurs. ”I’m sorry I couldn’t be of more help.”
”You can tell me everything that happened, I can take it…” Draco mumbles. ”I’m not stupid, I know what… I know what they’re like…”
…” Harry gasps, even as he’s waiting for his stomach to settle and it could go either way.
”Yeah, that was her”, Granger nods. ”Anyway, when I didn’t find her on the Animagus registry, I knew she’d studied to become an animagus illegally. So I told her, unless she stopped writing her horrible stories for the

”Yes, you are. You’re safe. I’m here and I won’t let anyone hurt you again, do you hear me?” he says fiercely.
, he adds to himself as he watches the blonde withdraw from the group again and mumble something about going to the library.
”I know what you meant, it’s okay”, Harry says gently. ”Look… Whenever Potter and I manage to swap back, maybe you should give him the benefit of the doubt?”
It’s by far the worst detention yet, and it’s got nothing to do with the cut on the back of Harry’s hand. It starts bleeding freely after only three lines and by the time he’s halfway down the page, his whole hand is throbbing with pain. But Harry barely even notices. The only thing he can think of is Draco sitting next to him.
”Me too”, Remus pipes up happily from behind them and Draco gives the man a surprised, almost pained look. ”Draco? You okay?”
Professor Snape blinks and looks up at him in surprise and Harry feels his stomach jolt. This is the first time his Head of House has looked him in the eyes since he threw him out of this office two weeks ago.
Harry thinks churlishly.
”A little…”
Harry’s heart jumps in his chest and he spins around on his heel, searching the darkness frantically with his eyes. He’d heard something. He could have
Professor Snape swoops round the desk in a flurry of billowing robes, then slowly sinks into the seat opposite Harry and pins him with his dark eyes, and Harry suspects he’s remembering the last time Harry was here, too… he barely resists the temptation to hang his head and resolutely maintains eye contact with his Head of House, whose sharp glare never wavers.
”I’m Harry Potter!” he cries out. ”I am, I’m Harry Potter!”
! Someone was in that bathroom,
”What happened?” Harry says again. ”Why couldn’t we get through?”
Harry doesn’t reply. With another steeling breath, he puts the quill to the parchment and writes.
”I’ll see you in the Common Room”, Harry tells the others, then walks up to the front of the class.
Draco smirks triumphantly.
Harry rolls his eyes.
”—grey, whatever — but he’s standing there in front of you, all
When the blonde finally looks up from the letter again, there is a hard look in his eye. It’s the look of grim resolve that he gets whenever he’s faced with an unpleasant situation that nevertheless needs to be dealt with and decides to deal with it. Harry recognises it well, because he has seen it plenty of times before — has even been the cause of it a couple of times, first when he decided to go after the Philosopher’s Stone and then again when he was determined to rescue Ginny Weasley from the Chamber of Secrets —
Harry hands him the plate of bacon, but flashing back to the many textbooks he’s read on werewolves, he suddenly remembers one of the symptoms of being a werewolf is a taste for raw meat even when you’re not transformed into your wolf form.
turn into something that flies”, Sirius says matter-of-factly once they’re in the garden. ”Just remember, don’t go too high at first because you’ll struggle maintaining the form in the beginning and we don’t want you to break anything. Okay? Ready? Go then!”
I don’t get girls, Harry thinks ruefully and slumps in his seat. Another furtive glance across the room tells him Draco has moved a bookcase closer to them and smirks wryly to himself.
home too, Draco…”
Huge, black eyes staring at him… Eight to each spider…
He remembers most of the events mentioned in the first few questions, but is unsure of the names of some of the goblins and gets his dates mixed up. He’s fairly confident in his take on questions four and five, but skips six altogether and only scribbles a vague answer to question seven since all the names of the concerned parties seem to have been Vanished from his brain since this morning.
”I don’t know, Sir”, Draco says. ”He’s a bit confused…”
even more carefully than he normally would. Next to him Draco has already finished checking the instructions and is on his feet, clutching his own potions book to his chest as he eagerly makes his way to the store cupboard.
”Fine”, Draco concedes glumly. ”But first thing in the morning.”
”Yeah.
”Shut up”, Harry snaps. ”Stop making stuff up! And don’t — don’t check the book first! I know you’re cheating—”
”Wait, did you say… Fifth Year?”
If the Irish victory dance had been chaotic, then the sight that meets Harry now is pure mayhem. A stampede of frightened witches and wizards are fleeing the campsite and heading into the woods, running away from a small group of people in masks, jeering and yelling drunkenly as they move across the field, their wands raised and firing hexes and shooting sparks… and high above them, floating in mid-air, are four figures that Harry realises with a pang are
” Harry snaps. ”What’s it to you anyway!”
”Moony—” Sirius murmurs.
of winning, but without actually winning — that way he would earn the respect of the rest of the school and still please
”I’m not a kid”, Harry protests and grabs it from him.
”There you are!” Draco says and shoves him lightly in the chest as he plops down on the sofa next to him. ”Don’t disappear like that!”
Suddenly the door in the corner opens and a man is dragged inside by two other men — or, are they men? Harry thinks doubtfully as he stares at the dark, cloaked figures — whatever they are, they seem to glide soundlessly over the floor, grasping the man with hands that look half rotted, dragging him towards the chair and depositing him almost ceremoniously into it. Immediately the chains spring to life and coil around his arms and torso, securing him to the chair.
Harry is aware of Pansy in his peripheral as she leans forward to grab her glass of lemonade, swiftly slipping the potion into Slughorn’s glass at the same time before sitting back again.
Professor Snape trickles a few drops of the potion into Trevor’s mouth and everyone watches with bated breath as the toad gulps… Then suddenly, with a small pop, Trevor the tadpole lies wriggling in the palm of Professor Snape’s hand. The Gryffindors cheer and the Slytherins glance at Snape’s sour face with trepidation.
Harry thinks with a obscene sense of calm.
”I appreciate your apprehension about the consequences of Harry participating in these tasks, but have you considered the consequences of
!” Filch wails and points a shaking finger at Harry. ”It’s him that’s done it!”
Remus just gives him a doubtful look and turns back to Harry and asks him if he’s cleaned his room yet. Harry can see the subtle tension of fatigue around his daddy’s eyes now, one of the early signs of the transformation… Around this time tomorrow, Harry knows the man will be weak and poorly.
”What is it with you”, Harry exclaims. ”Seriously, the Granger back home is just the same, always sticking her nose in and her hand up — in lessons”, he exclaims when the girl gives him a confused look. ”To answer the teachers’ questio- you know what, it doesn’t matter! None of this is any of your business, so why are you here?”
He looks extremely uncomfortable and quickly changes the subject.
Lying in his bed one night, unable to sleep, he thinks back to that night in the forest and what the centaur Firenze had tried to tell him…
”The one where dad is an animagus and you guys never told me…”
”Look, Granger is going to start tutoring me starting tomorrow”, the blonde says. ”That means I won’t be alone in the library anymore… Okay?”
”They’ve taken him to St Mungo’s”, she says importantly, before dissolving in a coughing fit.
, so…”
Harry stares, sure he must have misheard.
Draco’s pout twitches a little, ”First-years aren’t allowed to try out for the team, though…”
With a horrified gasp, Harry wrenches his face away from the comfort of his daddy’s shoulder and stares up into his face.
”We’ll see you guys later”, he says. ”Have fun…”
”He says he can do it”, Flint growls.
”So will we, won’t we?”
On either side of him, Karkaroff and Madam Maxime sit up a little straighter, which is slightly more impressive in Madam Maxime’s case since — despite still sitting down — it makes her almost level with Dumbledore.
”And I consider you to be a friend now as well.”
, he thinks darkly.
Draco perches on the side of the bed and watches him with a worried frown, nibbling his lower lip anxiously.
So he dives. Keeping eye contact with the dragon the whole time, Harry plummets towards the ground and just as the beast opens its mouth and lets out a jet of fire, Harry pulls out of the dive and narrowly avoids getting toasted.
It was meant to be quick and chaste, but Draco nestles his fingers in his hair and eagerly deepens it, their lips vibrating against each other as they both moan quietly. Draco gives Harry’s hair a gentle tug that sends a jolt through him and, conscious of their whereabouts, Harry finally breaks the kiss before it gets too heated.
He takes a quick a quick bath and makes a sloppy attempt to tame his damp-yet-still-inexplicably-wild hair, before running out of the bathroom and skidding to a halt inside his bedroom, where he ignores the dress robes his daddy has laid out for him on the bed and dresses instead in a pair of trousers and a casual button down shirt.
A moment later, Professor McGonagall bursts into the room, closely followed by Snape and finally Quirrell, who takes one look at the troll and immediately sinks down on top of a toilet clutching his heart with a whimper.
” Sirius calls from the kitchen.
”Well, well, well—!”
”I barely stand a chance against him, I know that. But if had all the facts, then I
There is a sudden
Harry gives a jerky nod, but refuses to meet the man’s eyes again. The beetle glints in the sunlight. It looks almost tropical with it’s vivid green colouring and strange black markings on its head.
Harry leans back against the wall next to the door and breathes a sigh of relief. Now he just needs to  find his way back to the dungeons before Snape gets there…
”But you can’t go alone”, Ron says, looking slightly awe-struck as he gazes at Harry.
”What? What’s that?” Harry mumbles in confusion.
”Okay!” Harry says brightly.
”I see…”
He snuggles a little closer into Draco’s side and the scent of the other boy overcomes him—
”I’m fine”, he says shortly, climbing through the portrait hole.
”I’m sure we can think of something”, Remus says.
”Er… I… Okay”, Draco mumbles, giving him a weird look. ”I mean, I
”We’ll get her…” Harry murmurs, brushing his lips over the other boy’s cheek.
The words finally become too blurry for Harry to make out and he slams the book shut again, sniffling pitifully as he wipes his sleeve over his eyes…
”What?” Harry snaps thickly.
Harry can see Umbridge’s eyes glint with interest as she leans in a little closer to the other woman and lowers her voice slightly, ”I wonder — the Headmaster has been very vague on the matter — could you tell me what’s causing Hagrid’s extended leave of absence?”
Professor Snape looks extremely uncomfortable at this display of affection, however mild and it makes Harry’s chest pinch, thinking he must not be very used to people showing him kindness…
”How’s that for timing!” Sirius exclaims happily.
”I don’t think there’s any need for that”, Umbridge says, still as sweetly. ”It’s perfectly straight-forward dear.”
”Harry, that’s enough”, Sirius says sternly. ”Your daddy’s not ready and you have to respect that.”
Expecting to feel the wall turn sharply into a corner and the corridor to continue to his right, but the wall just keeps stretching out in front of him for what feels like ages. Then suddenly, both of his hands bump into another wall. Harry frowns, there shouldn’t left turn here — there should be a right turn and
, he thinks bitterly, feeling the familiar prickle of tears sting at the corner of his eyes.
”You just saw him two hours ago”, Sirius says.
”Ehm, yeah, I don’t”, Harry stammers. ”I’m not—”
Draco inches even closer to Harry and clucthes his arm with both hands. When they reach the place where Hagrid has stopped to put the dead cow down on the ground and the Gryffindors have gathered around him, Draco hides slightly behind Harry’s shoulder.
”You want to offer my son up as
”Our lives were not at risk”, Harry mutters. ”Stop being so melodramatic… I’m just saying…”
So, I don’t know if anyone cares, but I was just reflecting on Draco and Pansy’s relationship (which is my new jam)
”It’s okay”, Draco says thickly, then sits up straight as if forcing the sadness out of himself by physically leaving it behind in the cushions. ”I have my own vault at Gringotts — it’s just saved up pocket money, but it will see me through school, until I can get a job — I can get some more art supplies and I’ll make more memories.”
”Professor Dumbledore will accompany you—”
”And yourself, dear?” the witch peers at Harry kindly.
But soon, more
Raising his wand a little higher above his head, he spins around searching for a portrait or a suit of armour, anyone he might ask about directions. But for some strange reason, this particular part of the corridor doesn’t have any paintings at all, and he can’t see anything lining the walls apart from one door. He inches closer to it and carefully tries the handle.
Lucius gives him a taunting smirk to mirror the one that quickly slipped off his face, then strides off before Remus and Sirius come stalking round the corner.
”You scared me”, he mutters, opening his eyes again and giving Harry a half-hearted glare.
The words are out of Harry’s mouth before he’s even aware of them forming in his mind. Malfoy gives him a weird look.
”Well done, Draco…” Harry murmurs.
Harry makes his way back to number twelve when the sun begins to set. His stomach is too knotted for him to get much dinner down, so he excuses himself from the table almost as soon as he’s sat down, much to the Dursley’s relief.
”Oh, little bit of this… little bit of that…” Diggory says airly and winks. ”I really should be going, though. It was great to see you both—”
”Oh come off it”, Ginny protests. ”He’s answered the question!”
Harry unfolds the parchment and quickly reads the short message, the narrow and neat handwriting unfamiliar to him.
”When he’s
”You’re welcome. Now, get going or you’ll be late for…
Harry isn’t sure how much the different Houses see of each other, except when they have shared classes together, but he somehow thinks it’s unlikely that a Gryffindor can be friends with a Slytherin.
Harry nods, sinking down in his seat at the table.
So, if you please, turn to page ten in your copies of Advanced Potion-Making. You have one hour. Off you go!”
”You —”
!” Madam Pomfrey shouts back, her hand still on the door handle.
to make a habit of this!”
”S-Sorry”, the blonde gasps, cupping his own cock as the last few drops of cum spurts out of it and splatters over the back of his hand.
”There you are…” Sirius sleep-gravelly voice says suddenly and Harry turns around in his seat to see his dad leaning against the doorframe behind him. ”Everything alright?”
”I believe…” Dumbledore murmurs, apparently weighing his words carefully. ”This is Harry Potter… But from an alterative reality to ours…”
Bending to pick the book back up with trembling fingers, Harry quickly flicks to the correct page and skims down to where he’d left off…
”You’re beautiful”, he mumbles.
”He… I think he provoked Umbridge on purpose, so that he’d get detention with her as well…”
Harry’s mind flickers between the memory of First Year Malfoy offering him his hand and this world’s Malfoy clutching Lupin’s hand whilst telling them all that he’d been expected to accept the Dark Mark. He stares at the blonde’s arm and swallows the hint of bile climbing up his throat.
”Sir”, Draco pipes up anxiously next to them. ”I-I don’t think Harry is well, he woke up from a nightmare and he seemed really confused a-a-and—”
”Oh…” Harry breathes, and carefully manoevers the little ball of fur into one hand, so that he can use his other to stroke its head. ”Oh, daddy, isn’t it the cutest thing you’ve ever seen?”
”There isn’t time”, Harry says loudly and slowly. ”We can discuss strategies on the way to London, but we need to get moving
”No?” Voldemort says softly. ”I
, but whatever made the blonde tense up must have vanished again because his eyes are soft when Harry staggers back from him and he immediately reaches out to pull him back in.
”It’s nothing”, Draco huffs in annoyance. ”She’s just worried I’m not gaining enough weight.”
”Oh!” she says, her eyebrows going up into her frizzy hair. ”Well… There is some debate about that. Some sources say that, amongst the general population, about ten per cent are either homo- or bisexual, but… that is based on one single study from the seventies that has since been criticised—”
”Little Whinging? Where’s that? Why do I have to stay there for a week?” Harry is aware that he’s more or less whining at this point, but couldn’t reign his frustration and disappointment in even if he tried. ”And after that week, then what? When are we going to resume my lessons?”
”It’s okay”, Draco says quickly, his smile returning just as suddenly as it had flickered away. ”You’re right… but say what you will about Toadface, at least she’s managed to keep Rita Skeeter off the premises…”
”Harry…” Remus sighs. ”We’re not having this discussion every month.”
Sirius returns with both Dumbledore and Madam Pomfrey, who makes a beeline for Harry and begins to fuss over him in her usual non-coddling manner, tutting and humming as she goes. Harry feels the uncomfortable tickle of magic running along the inside of his skin as she performs a diagnotic spell on him and squirms.
Harry nods, relieved.
”Dragons…”
Harry is aware of the small audience they’ve attracted and hears one of the Patil twins mutter something about
”It wouldn’t have made a difference, he doesn’t
No, not that, a voice speaks up at the back of Harry’s mind. That’s private —
Both his dads blink in surprise. Whatever they expected him to ask, it obviously wasn’t that. The two men exchange a look and Harry can tell his dad at least seems to like the idea.
Harry knows the feeling all too well, it’s been stirring inside of him for quite some time now. Along with the sense of purpose and the excitement over the idea of taking charge of his own nightmares, of forcing the past to come full circle, of
”I’ll come with you”, Draco says.
Glancing over at the other beds in the dorm, he can see that the rest of the boys are still asleep as well… Draco is the only one not in his bed, even though it’s already late judging by the torches (that are magicked to burn a bright limegreen in daytime and a dark emerald at night, since the dungeons are below ground and they don’t get any natural light in the dorms, except for the dim underwater light from the lake in the middle of the day.) But then he was the only one of them who went to bed early the night before as well.
Despite having just been dismissed to rescue kittens, Harry couldn't resist a little smile of relief.  When he'd first entered the loo and seen Zabini and Draco together, he'd felt crushed.  Not that Draco showed any interest in him, but it was still terrible to think that he was with someone else, especially a pompous git like Blaise Zabini.  Seeing the other man rudely dismissed allowed Harry to continue to hope that he might someday have a chance.
'Ready?' Draco asked as he took Harry's hand. 'One of the caterers told me about the pastries you ordered, and I don't want to miss all of the éclairs.'
Harry pulled back until only the tip was in his mouth and then laved at the head and underside before plunging back down again. Malfoy staggered and reached out for the wall. His thighs trembled under Harry’s hands and that alone would have made Harry hard if he weren’t already on the verge of coming in his pants.
could be better than having his cock surrounded in the tight, wet,
Malfoy. Suddenly all the watching and the unencouraged attempts at conversation made sense. Rather than panic at realising he fancied his former rival, Harry felt a great relief. He might be mad, but at least he finally understood his own madness. And perhaps he should have been embarrassed at how long it took him to figure out—because surely Hermione knew already—but he never claimed to be brilliant in the romantic feelings department.
Kauko comes that morning like usual, but he has another man with him. Aamu approaches the new man and studies his face. His hair is wild and dark like the boy in her vision, but he looks different with bright green eyes, open but shielded by glasses. She looks into his face and sees the strength and determination burning there. And the healing. In those lips is a gentleness that speaks of helping others.
Draco nodded.  "I just had no idea how …
She allowed the change in topic and called them into the kitchen where she pulled a pie from the oven and set it at the table. "Steak and ale tonight."
“Your hair's soul mate, Potter?”  Potter looked confused for a moment before glancing back at the woman and laughing.
Right. Like that would happen.
Luckily, Claudius didn't seem to know that Draco had forgiven Blaise as soon as Pansy had moved on and they were closer than ever. What's a few death threats between friends?
When they had finally met again, Potter had simply stared at him.  The man had moved his mouth a few times but not spoken.  When Draco told Pansy about it, she had done that snort-laugh that she thought was endearing and he thought made her sound like a pig.  She had then commented that Potter's reaction wasn't surprising given that, “the last time he saw you, you were all skeletal and grey.”
feels great. I’m sold.”
That's Phase Six. If Potter were the shag-at-a-party type, he wouldn't be a virgin, now would he?"
He emerged from his bathroom to find a sleepy Potter sitting up in Draco's bed and smiling at him.  The smile suddenly transformed into a pout.  “You left.  Come back to bed.”
Draco waved that off. Who would want to?
had run an article the very next day on the unexpected heroes of the war. The focus was on Severus, but the article included a quotation from Potter about how Draco's mother had deceived the Dark Lord to save his life. That one act proved enough to keep her free. The article also quoted Potter as saying that Draco had lied to his family to keep Potter safe, but Aurors came for him anyway.
Draco resisted hitting his head against his desk. "We shared a room, not a bed. Nothing happened."
He knew Draco had moved away when the air around him felt empty and cold. It felt like dread, but Harry refused to see it as an omen. He searched the space before him in the growing darkness, but everything was silent and still.
“Finally.” Aida had joined them and she walked up to Draco. “I told you from the beginning, Draco. You can’t hide forever.” She embraced him and he rested his head on her shoulder. Harry had never imagined Draco as the huggy type, but today he seemed to be hugging everyone. Harry hoped he would get a turn as well. Maybe without the audience. He forced his mind to stop before he could continue imagining what he would do if he could get Draco alone and in his arms.
What should he do? Flee to the bedroom and lock himself in? Surely Potter could take his own potions to clear his sinuses and lungs. And if he couldn’t, Kreacher would help him. He didn’t need Draco, and Draco didn’t need his illness.
'Oh, shit! Sorry. Sorry.' Draco sounded breathless and half-mad, but sincere. 'Just felt so good.' He stumbled to the wall and leant against it. 'Here. You can press my hips back.'
“That’s right.”
your mother, well,” Harry shrugged.  “I don’t think Andromeda could hold hard feelings against anyone who Teddy got on with.  Like I said, she wants him to have family.”
At first Harry had thought that meant it was on a nature reserve.  Luna living in a giant natural park had seemed fitting.  But that wasn't what it meant.  The house was part of a little village with the usual amenities one would expect.  There was a pub, a shop, and clusters of houses.  What they didn't have was clothes.  No clothes on Luna.  No clothes on her neighbours.  And if Harry was to visit her, no clothes on Harry.
“I still have to get back to my kitchen to make your cake.” He narrowed his eyes in a haughty manner. “I suppose I should simply invite you along for that, too.”
* * *
No, there was really only one man who was worth Draco's time and virginity.  Only Harry Potter had the power and influence to protect him within the Ministry and improve his standing in the wizarding world in general.  The world was eager to please Harry Potter, and those close to him won favour by proxy.  Even Potter's boy-toy would curry some favour.
“We have a new reservation.”
“Really,” he drawled.  “I've been calling you Potter for years.”
A knock to his shoulder alerted Harry he was staring. Again. Ron looked from Harry to Draco and back before rolling his eyes. “You set that up nicely,” he teased.
Draco took a deep breath and let it out with a weary sigh. "What do you want from me, Harry?"
But that was all beside the point. However Potter looked, Draco’s priority was to ensure he had a pleasant stay at the hotel and would bring good publicity to counteract some of Skeeter’s damage. He ignored the twisting in his gut and put on a friendly but professional demeanour. “Welcome to Hotel Kalmynsi, Mr Potter.”
Draco felt as if he'd been slapped.  Apparently Potter thought no better of him now than he had in sixth-year.  So much for all that bullshit about doing a great job redeeming his name.  "Detaining the Death Eater so he can't go torture Muggles?" he spat. "Is that what you think?"
When Arthur had returned to the Burrow the night of the trial and told them the verdict, Ginny and Harry had embraced in their relief.  It had been the first time they’d touched since their awkward conversation about not getting back together, and it had comforted Harry to know he hadn’t lost her as a friend.  The whole night had felt like healing and moving on.
“You’ve grown, Merryn! How dare you change in my absence?”
“And selfish and moody,” Charlie said casually. “Don’t I know it.” He shrugged as if spending all day training a spoiled brat were no inconvenience. He set his cup back on the garden table and helped himself to one of the biscuits Mrs. Weasley had sent over. “But so are dragons.”
When Draco had hung up the phone, he found himself staring at it and wondering if he’d imagined the whole thing. It was only the chiming of the grandfather clock by the front door which brought him back to himself. It was dinner time, and his great aunt and mother would be expecting him. He walked down the hallway leading to Rosamund’s kitchen but also held the secret entrance to the North Wing, the part of Manerji Kalmynsi not converted into the hotel.
to be talking about Harry leaving the Aurors!  And he was
him. Harry had never felt so adored.
Draco seems to deliberate with himself, and swallows thickly as he scans the spread of food in front him on the table. He then reaches out and grabs the ladle of the nearest pot with a slightly trembling hand and then scoops up a couple of potatoes to add to his plate.
”Harry is really getting the hang of this!” Remus says proudly, ignoring his husband’s question even as he curls his arm around his waist and leans in for a quick kiss.
”I’m ready”, the blonde says again. ”And I really want to try out for the team.”
But no matter many times he reminds himself of that, it still
”The deal”, Harry repeats with a grin. ”With the Weasley twins, right? How much did you pay them?”
Dumbledore nods again, ”Well… I’ll make this short”, he says with a sigh. ”First of all, Harry, I’d like to thank you… You must have shown me real loyalty down in the Chamber, for Fawkes to come to your aid…”
”Harry”, Snape interrupts and finally looks up and meets his eyes again. ”It’s fine.”
”Yes, well”, Remus mutters. ”It’s a weekday, so… We might miss them, if we wait until ten, won’t we… I’ll use the fireplace in the sitting room, you start breakfast…”
”Wiz? The 80s owled, they want their vocabulary back… Also, that boy was a Slytherin.”
is doing here!”
”No! Give me my letters now!
that?” Blaise says, removing his hands from his ears.
”Well, dear…” she says dreamily. ”What did you see?”
Harry thinks happily.
Harry feels the recently hatched monster in his belly begin to stir, coiling into a tight, tense ball…
”Dad.”
”No”, Draco immediately shakes his head. ”I… I really liked it, it — it felt amazing, it — it didn’t hurt at all…”
”Good night…” Harry mutters back and burrows deeper down under the covers.
”Bastard…” Draco mutter and steals another kiss from him.
”Better Hagrid than us”, Draco says quietly, gazing coldly at the gamekeeper. ”If we’re lucky, he’ll even have to get rid of the blasted Skrewts. Win-win.”
He’s painfully aware of the seconds ticking by…
Harry glances between him and Remus, noticing the tension in their faces suddenly.
Harry pauses, halfway out of the chair, eager to leave the Headmaster’s office.
”That would be your O.W.L. results, then”, he comments lightly.
”I no more suspect Madame Maxime, than I suspect Hagrid, Minister”, Dumbledore says, just as quietly and calmly as before. ”I do believe it is you, Cornelius, that is prejudiced…”
After a quick dinner in the Great Hall, Harry and Draco grab their brooms from the dungeons and make their way to the Quidditch pitch along with the other Slytherins hoping to make the team. The team captain Marcus Flint is waiting for them when they get there and instructs them all to line up in front of him. Harry scans the small crowd quickly, counting three other second-years besides himself and Draco, namely Crabbe, Goyle and a girl named Millicent Bulstrode, none of which Harry has ever really bothered to get to know.
to the hard stone floor, his glasses flying off and landing with a clatter in front of his face.
Catching Harry’s subtle eye movement in the direction of the bookcase Malfoy is now hiding behind, Granger follows it discretely. She spots the left side of the blonde’s face through the Invisibility section before she quickly wips her head around again and pins Harry with a disapproving look. He gives her an innocent one in return.
Harry’s gut feeling is telling him that the other boy is telling the truth, but he just can’t see him dropping it so easily either…
”I SAID—!”
The bird lets out a weak caw and suddenly bursts into flames — Harry stumbles backwards with a shocked yell, his heel catching on the edge of the carpet and he loses his balance and sits down heavily on the floor for the third time today, as his painfully throbbing buttock reminds him. He winces and flops around, pushing himself up on his hands and knees.
Sirius stays where he is. His unwavering stare is starting to get under Harry’s skin.
Draco finally abandons his attempt to reach for ant eggs — or rather he abandons the ruse of attempting to, Harry figures because he doesn’t really think Draco ever had any intention of actually getting his hands dirty, not without protective gloves — and he straightens up and glares back at the Gryffindor.
he tells himself firmly. Harry isn’t sure what’s going on, but this Remus Lupin is Harry Potter’s former professor and, possibly, friend — But that is
He cuts himself off suddenly and freezes, his eyes fixed on Harry in amazement and disbelief. Harry catches his eyes do the familiar little journey up to his forehead and swallows a sigh.
and he’s looking at you with his big, blue eyes—”
The matching sets of grins on their faces quickly falls, when Ron blurts out
Once more, he finds himself inside the massive, vaulted room full of shelves stacked with glass spheres. His heart is pounding now…
Wow. This is it, people. Last chapter (and it's a long one too!) - can't believe I did it, crazy!
”I am calm”, Harry retorts. ”All things considered, this is
”Yeah, whatever”, Harry says impatiently. ”Me, what?”
Harry’s head is still fuzzy, still pounding and his scar is stinging, making it difficult to concentrate but he’s keenly aware of everyone acting weird … the more insistently he clutches his daddy’s robes, the tenser the man seems to become; if Harry didn’t know better, he’d think his daddy didn’t want to hold him —
”We all made it, Draco, so give it a rest!” Harry says.
”No? What did you cover instead?”
”Ehm, yeah…” Harry mumbles, looking between the enraged faces of Snape and Remus a couple of times before turning to face the Headmaster once more. ”I was in the Department of Mysteries, like I told you… Someone was chasing me, trying to hex me… I ran through a door and—”
As if hearing Harry’s thoughts, the blonde turns to meet his gaze. His eyes immediately darkening a shade.
The path opens suddenly on to the edge of a large black lake and on the other side, the castle sits perched atop a high hill, its many windows sparkling like some addition to the starry sky. There is a collective ”Ooooh” and some astonished gasps from the students. Harry’s heart seems to leap at the sight. It’s just beautiful.
”Harry, I understand that you made some enquiries pertaining to the whereabouts of Mr Malfoy when you first woke up yesterday…?” Dumbledore says softly.
”Stop! STOP IT!” Harry screams.
Harry suspects his dads are trying to make up for his last birthday, which he celebrated with just the two of them. He’d been in a daze for most of it since he was operating on very little sleep and his nerves were completely shot after countless nightmares and a run-in with a Dementor, so he didn’t exactly get to enjoy his birthday. So he does appreciate his dads making a big deal about it this year.
Harry keeps looking over at Krum, feeling oddly star-struck, and his heart lurches pleasantly when the other boy suddenly looks over and, for one brief second, their eyes lock before the older boy continues to sweep his eyes over the rest of the Slytherin table. Clearly liking what he sees, he starts to make his way over and the rest of the Durmstrang boys quickly follows.
, because it’s too big —
”That’s okay. Thank you”, Sirius says and helps Harry to his feet. ”Come on, runt… Let’s go take a look at that nose, eh?”
”We go to the Ministry”, Draco says, his eyes hard with resolve as he turn to fix Harry with a steady look. ”Like you said.”
Remus’s face crumbles into a look of pure heartbreak and Harry feels it like a punch in his stomach. He wishes there was any way for him to take the words back, but there isn’t.
”Well… Ehm… Because there are so many of us, won’t it get confused as to what shape to take?”
”I was out walking and… something weird happened”, Harry mumbles. ”The sky, it went dark… and it got cold…”
”Who said anything about getting laid?” Draco mumbles, his blush deepening.
He likes the other boy and wishes him well, and genuinely hopes he’ll making friends with Potter. He figures that if he leaves him a message, it will only complicate things for the other boy.
, he decides.
As soon as the wrapping paper is off, not one but two books tumble into his lap and not only that, but a glass phial as well. Harry blinks in surprise and picks it up. It’s half the size of the books and rather flat, which would explain how it managed to stay hidden between the books without Harry realising it was there. The label reads: ’
”I don’t appreciate your face!”
As they leave January behind and enter into February, Harry starts to seriously agonise about Valentine’s Day… He’s not sure if he should give Draco a card or something…
”, Karkaroff snarls, and Harry quickly peers around his cauldron to see him pull up his left-hand sleeve and show Snape something on his inner forearm. ”Well? Do you see? It’s never been this clear before, not since —”
He cuts himself off with a shuddered gasp and swallows down a small sob.
”I’m familiar with the potion”, Professor Snape murmurs, giving him an appraising look.
It doesn’t look quite as bad as yesterday, he surmises. But he could have done without Care of Magical Creatures after lunch, seeing as the rain has yet to let up, if the enchanted ceiling is anything to go by… but at least they have a nice, slow start with Divination first thing in the morning followed by a free period.
”That… that was your mother?” Harry says, staring in shock at the pulled velvet curtains.
”… seems to have forged some kind of connection between the Dark Lord’s mind and your own, allowing your mind to share his thoughts and emotions when you are at your most relaxed and vulnerable — when you are asleep, for instance — and the Headmaster thinks it inadvisable for this continue. In short, he wishes me to teach you how to close your mind to the Dark Lord.”
”I … I …” he trails off uncertainly and just shakes his head.
”Ran…” he gasps.
”Professor Umbridge is a professor and she has a right to dole out detentions as she sees fit—”
”What?” Harry says. ”It’s not
”, Professor Umbridge says, standing up behind her desk. ”That won’t do. I should like you all to please reply ’Good morning, Professor Umbridge’… now, let’s try that again, shall we?
Harry turns around in surprise and barely registers the brown, bushy mane of one Hermione Granger bobbing towards him before he’s enveloped in a massive hug. He staggers back from the sudden impact, then awkwardly pats the Gryffindor girl’s back. She releases him again and grins excitedly, her large front teeth glinting in the dusty sunlight. Harry smiles back.
food. “I know what will settle your stomach.”  She left before he gave any sort of reply.
visit, now that the idea was in his head. Come to think of it, the Burrow wasn’t that far from Malfoy Manor. Harry could Apparate or even fly there. It wasn’t his favourite place in Britain, but surely they could avoid the drawing room and the dungeons. Or maybe he could get Malfoy to the Burrow.
”One moment, Harry…” he says quietly. ”Draco, you can go ahead… Do you need to go to the Hospital Wing, Harry? You’re clearly in pain.”
”Hagrid — what’s
”Was there a language in particular you were looking for?”
”They
So he says nothing, just nods and follows the other boy’s gaze to the dance floor.
”Your memory of that night”, Harry says, nodding. ”Yes please, professor. It’s important.”
”Well, we hear that sort of stuff all the time, of course”, the memory ghost continues dismissively. ”’Oh this was Merlin’s this was, his favourite teapot’ and that sort of nonsense. But when I looked closely at the locket, it did indeed have Sytherin’s mark on it, and a few simple spells was all I needed to confirm the truth… of course, that made the necklace near priceless. She didn’t seem to have any idea of of its worth, though. Happy to get ten Galleons for it. Best bargain we ever made!”
Harry has taken to avoiding the rest of the castle as much as possible, keeping to the dungeons or the courtyard outside whenever he wasn’t in class or having meals in the Great Hall, because wherever he goes, people seem to stare and whisper, and although that’s something he’s become quite used to by now, there’s a slight difference to the looks and whispers now… Before, it was always looks of admiration or curiosity, and the whispers were either excited or awe-struck, but now… Well, let’s just say Harry didn’t exactly feel like a hero anymore…
. Harry nods too and pushes off the wall.
Remus pulls himself up tall in his seat, reminding Harry of Hedwig when she ruffles her feathers in indignation. He quickly covers his mouth with a hand to hide his grin at the image.
” he blurts out hurriedly and then has to sit on his own hand to stomp out the impulse to smack himself in the face.
Snape opens the door to the dormitory carefully and holds it up for Harry who shuffles inside. He pauses in the middle of the room and looks over at his fourposter bed. He can hear the door slide shut again behind him and looks around.
”I know…” Malfoy says quietly. ”I hadn’t expected them to want me to accept the Dark Mark so soon, or without any warning, that’s why I had to run away so suddenly. But that doesn’t mean any of this is a whim. I’ve been thinking about it for a year. I love my mother, and Malfoy Manor, my room, the rose garden… But I love it here too and most of all, more than
”It came out yesterday, so I asked dad to send you a free copy… I expect these—” she gestures towards the remaining owls, growing more and more impatient with Harry. ”Are letters from readers, you know?”
”Yes, but listen — she wouldn’t be allowed to use a Quick-Quote Quill and you would have complete control over what she puts in the article before it gets published—”
”Well, let me see it—” he says, reaching for the paper, but Draco holds it out of reach. ”Draco!”
”He… He was your godfather, Harry…” Remus says warily and nods. ”That’s true, but… He wasn’t your… He was never your
The one glass orb that didn’t smash, slipping in his sweaty grip as he and Draco dove into the room with all the clocks.
”Can you you let me in to my Common Room”, Harry all but shouts back.
”I don’t.”
”But that’s ridiculous —”
”I think whoever killed Mr Crouch is the same person who put my name in the Goblet of Fire… it’s just too much of a coincidence, think about it… plus Crouch mentioned me when he was rambling, he said something about the Dark Lord getting stronger and then he said my name…”
Harry throws the floo powder onto the flames inside the fireplace and waits for them to turn green again, before stepping inside and exclaiming Creirwyn’s Hollow. In the next second, he feels himself begin to spin really fast. The solid sensation of bricks and coal disappears from underneath his feet and he’s shooting through space.
he thinks.
… there will be no need to talk.”
Something stirs at the back of Harry’s mind, a distant childhood memory… It won’t take shape in his mind’s eye, all he remembers is something warm and sticky hitting his tongue and filling his mouth with bitterness that made him instantly gag. There is a vague sensation of one of his dads sighing and shushing soothingly as well, but he can’t quite recollect the acrual situation.
”This way?” he asks Harry over his shoulder.
”Come
”Mr Potter”, the older wizard says finally in a politely neutral tone of voice as he too inclines his head. ”It’s… nice… to see you again.”
”On the count of three… One… Two… Three…
He sweeps a glance over the three of them to assess the damage of their adventure, then wordlessly points towards the tunnel’s exit. They scurry past him quickly and glancing uncomfortably at Dumbledore’s uncharacteristically stoic face, they continue to follow Fawkes through the gloom.
He then glances up towards the top of the smallest branches, scanning for his dad’s face… but he’s not there. Harry frowns, opening his mouth to ask about it, but before the words are out of his mouth, Sirius points to a small, round charred hole in the tapestry.
”Well, I’m here if you want to talk”, he says simply and Harry nods.
”Guess who got offered the head as a birthday gift?” Draco says drily, then adding quickly. ”I said I didn’t want it.”
”No”, Harry says firmly.
Draco nods too, and they make their way back inside together. Harry doesn’t feel like returning to the others, but when he starts moving towards the stairs to the dungeon, Draco gives him a sharp look.
Harry’s stomach plummets again as he slowly turns his head to see a very ashen-faced Ernie point a trembling finger at him.
The notice announcing the dates of the Hogsmeade visits of the term appears on their house noticeboard, stuck rather pointedly on top of the latest Educational Decree so that it’s obscuring Umbridge’s name, and Draco nudges Harry, nodding towards it.
”I’m not”, Harry says firmly. ”I asked someone I like to a dance and they said no. Now I’m going to ask someone else. Because I can’t go to the Ball without a partner, Snape told me so. What else am I supposed to do—?”
Before Draco has a chance to respond to that, they round the corner and come face to face with Ron and Hermione who are waiting for them outside the door to Fluffy’s corridor. Harry leans close to the door and listens for Fluffy’s growls and snuffles, but he doesn’t hear any of that… He hears music… And snoring…
Something glints in his peripheral and, acting on pure instinct, Harry throws himself flat along his broomstick and hurtles forward into a dive… it’s only when he’s halfway across the Stadium that he realises that he’s not in pursuit of the Snitch at all, but his teammate Montague’s wristwatch.
Harry takes his hand when he holds it out and they make the trek through Hogsmeade village in silence. It’s neither comfortable nor uncomfortable, it just is.
Finally the blonde removes the bottle from his mouth and gasps for breath, his chest heaving slightly and his eyes glittering more than ever as he looks defiantly at Ron.
quidditch… It’s not my
”No…”
They eat in mostly comfortable silence, Remus breaking it every so often to ask Draco about his studies and if he’s excited about the World Cup. Draco is always quick to answer politely and sits up a little straighter every time Remus talks to him, Harry notices.
Harry nods quickly and hurries over to a smaller tent. Madam Pomfrey is waiting for him outside, looking anxious.
”Ah, I thought so!” Lockhart says.
”All right”, Professor Snape says in a clearly put upon casual tone of voice, that tells Harry he must feel mortified as well. ”Let’s… Let’s try something different…”
”Don’t apologise!” Sirius grouses, then spins on his heel and turns his back to the tapestry, his hands deep in his pockets as he glares across the drawing room. ”I just hate being back here, that’s all… it gives me the creeps…”
”MISTER POTTER!” Umbridge shouts shrilly.
”Yeah”, he chokes out.
”What d’yeh —?”
”Never mind that”, Draco growls. ”Didn’t you hear what she just said? This Vane tramp is plotting to slip Harry a potion—”
”Right you are m’lad”, the driver says when Harry tells him the address and pulls out onto the main road.
Harry bites down on a curse and quickly slumps back against his pillow, just as the doors to the Hospital Wing fly open and light spills inside. Harry curls up on his side, pretending to sleep, but squints his eyes open slightly, peering at the people entering the wing.
? What the hell is that supposed to mean?”
”I see… tell me about the World Cup…”
, it’s Lucius Malfoy — if Draco were to turn into his father…
”Yeah, you’ll be needing a cauldron”, Remus says. ”Come on…”
”No, I thought of a really good one! But
”Come on, cub… let’s get you out of here…” Remus murmurs into his ear and he nods.
Suddenly, Harry remembers… how could he have forgotten? There’s a Death Eater at Hogwarts! They’re not safe here at all,
”But she’s pretty cool… And funny.”
”You’re bleeding”, Draco counters.
Draco smirks down at him, but says nothing. Harry wriggles a little, pulling his pants and trousers up again. Then flops down on his back with a content sigh and notices for the first time the handful of luminous balloons stuck to the ceiling panel of the four-poster bed, giving the shadows inside the bed hangings a warm glow.
… He hardly thinks the Weasley twins would be too happy about that.
Harry blinks in surprise. Oh, so he didn’t kill him then.
”Really?” she says, a silver blush making her cheeks seem less transparent.
The door opens again and Professor Dumbledore appears above Harry, peering down at him curiously. Harry quickly scrambles up to his feet, barely refraining from rubbing his sore bottom as he straightens up in front of the Headmaster.
The tension between himself and Draco remains unchanged, but Harry does catch the blonde staring a lot more lately which he is happy to store away under ’Progress’ and it makes it just a little bit easier to remain patient about the whole situation. Just a little bit.
Harry is unable to get his conversation with Granger out of his head and he wishes his daddy was there so he could talk to him about it. He figures that the next best thing in the given circumstances, would be this world’s Remus Lupin. So as soon as he’s finished his lunch, he makes his way to the Owleryand sends the man a letter with one of the school owls.
”Would you like to be the second?”
”No, no, we’re coming too”, Remus calls after him.
”Hullo…” Harry says politely and watches as the distrustful look is dialled up a notch. ”Do you have any books on — er — noises?”
”That’s chess”, Ron says sharply. ”You have to make sacrifices! All right — here goes —”
”Oh really?” Sirius says with playful leer, and Harry feels his face heat up. ”Getting noticed by the girls already? Girls in other houses even!”
Remus arms tighten further around him and he whimpers, imagining he felt at least one of his ribs cracking…
”THE SLYTHERIN CHAMPION!” the rest of the students echo enthusiastically.
”Er…”
He’s vaguely aware of the sounds of voices filtering back in, but the Headmaster’s voice keep echoing in his head:
He pushes to his feet and nearly trips over in his haste to approach the blonde. He just has time to register the boy’s subtle flinch before he wraps his arms around him in a massive hug. His heart stutters to a stop and he lurches back again, stammering something about being
”Sorry”, he mutters under his breath.
”I’ll take him to the Hospital Wing, Professor”, Draco says, looping an arm around Harry’s waist before grabbing his bag from the floor. ”Come on…”
Harry gulps down great lungfuls of cold night air and opens his sstreaming eyes to see see an unfamiliar field split in two by a narrow river, hugged by overgrown banks.
…” Draco repeats with a meaningful look.
”Voldemort killed Krum and he almost killed me too”, Harry repeats stubbornly, feeling a grim sense of satisfaction to see the two Aurors flinch again. ”That’s my ’official statement’…”
”Harry—”
As soon as Harry steps over the threshold he is hit by the stench of dust and sour dampness, as well as a third smell that he can’t quite place… as his dads file in behind him and shut the door again, the hallway is instantly shrouded in complete darkness, as the few windows that Harry had seen from the outside are covered in heavy drapes to keep the daylight out.
Sorry it's a bit short! x
Dumbledore watches him kindly over the rim of his halfmoon spectacles, his beard twitching around his smile.
Draco on the other hand couldn’t be more pleased, Harry thinks wryly, watching the blonde eagerly jot down a quick message on a piece of parchment.
After the leprechauns have congregated on the Irish side of the pitch and settled down to watch the match, Ludo Bagman introduce each player on both teams and then finally the referee, who mounts his broom and then kicks open the crate to release the quaffle, the bludgers and the golden Snitch — then with a shrill whistle, the match begins!
Harry’s eyes flit up to his daddy’s face in surprise, hardly daring to hope.
to write it myself, Mister Potter — Harry — may I call you Harry? — I’m not sure if you’re familiar with my work or not, but I’m sure Horace can lend you some of the biographies I’ve written in the past, I think you’ll find they all do their subjects justice — and like I said, Harry, people are craving to hear the full story, the
Seamus makes a face that says
”It won’t do you any good that they can beat a bludger hard enough to break both broom and limbs, if they’re too stupid to aim it
”I know I can be a bit of an idiot”, Harry thinks out loud. ”And I’m not the most sensitive of people.”
Harry says nothing, just stare at his boyfriend in frustration and wills himself
Most of the students have completely abandoned their Bowtruckles by now and are eagerly listeing in on the conversation, curious about the half-giant’s mysterious absence themselves.
”What?”
Riddle frowns and turns to face him properly. Holding the lantern aloft, he scrutinises what little can be seen of the man’s face through his scraggly, dirty hair and beard.
Harry narrows his eyes him. The blonde’s eyes flit back to meet his and his smirk twitches.
”Don’t worry, I’m sure the plan will work”, the girl says, misreading the glum look on his face.
It turns out they’d both been right, because Flint doesn’t even ask Harry and Draco to try out, just tells them what their positions are and then demands they warm up so that they can help try the others out. Harry and Draco exchange a look, but quickly mount their brooms. Harry gives the blonde a subtle wink, before kicking off with a smirk.
”P-Professor!” he gasps. ”I’m so sorry, I didn’t mean to… Sir?…”
That’s good, that’s better than he would have ever hoped for only a few hours ago. Now he knows the other boy had hoped for more, but Harry suspects he’s also happy with this, that it’s still a hundred times better than things have ever been between him and the Potter of this world.
All he knows is that Sirius has allowed them the use of his childhood home in central London as Headquarters and no matter how much Harry has nagged him about it, he refuses to let Harry come along to any of the meetings, saying he doesn’t want Harry to see the place where he grew up or what kind of people his parents were or have to come face to face with his mother, whatever he means by that… both of Sirius parents are dead, after all, so Harry doesn’t understand in what way he’d be forced to face them if he went to the house now…
I’ll believe you if Harry is still in one piece on Wednesday! He doesn’t need to summon a cushion from two metres away, he needs to summon a broomstick from inside a castle about a thousand and two metres away!”
”I knew Wood looked smug!” Flint snarls. ”I’m sure he’s done something to it!”
”Hey…” he murmurs gently. ”Did you manage to get any sleep?”
A chorus of clicking and rustling erupts around them and Harry flinches, half expecting to be suddenly ripped apart from all sides, but nothing happens.
, Harry thinks sullenly.
Harry tells it firmly.
, the boy Ernie says solemnly.
”You’re alright, Draco… You’re…
Not just that, Harry himself was clearly Sorted into Slytherin himself, even though it took the Hat a while to deliberate.
For some reason, the mere mention of the other reality and the other Potter, who had insiduously insinuating his way into Harry’s life and replaced him for weeks, makes something inside Harry’s chest contract painfully.
, we can just have them delivered at the castle — you won’t need them until the 2
Harry feels his breath catch in his throat and somehow Draco must know it, because a wolfish grin breaks out in his face. There is something about the glint in his eyes that reminds Harry of Sanguini and he feels a thrill at the thought. Eagerly roping the tall blonde in with his free hand, he grabs a hold of his hips in a bruising grip, coaxing him to step close enough to him so that he can feel the heat that is now radiating from his body.
But there’s nothing. Just empty shop windows and
”Daddy, stop nagging me!” Harry whines and cradles his coffee mug close to his face and eagerly inhales the nutty, woody scent of the dark roast.
After waving good bye to Sirius, Harry and Draco get started on the list of chores Remus has asked them to help with while he works on his book manuscript in the upstairs study.
”Well, what else is new…” Draco says drily, even as the worry in his eyes grows more and more frantic.
Harry frowns at the parentheses and then glances quickly at the next language listed by the book —
”No, really—”
”Take this to Professor Snape, dear…”
of genuinely relaxing…
is of utmost importance—”
“Yes, thank you, Pans”, Seamus says, then sweeps his eyes over the others excitedly. “Everyone clear on what they’re doing and when? Should we go through it agai—?
He wonders if any of the adventures of his time at Hogwarts have been mirrored in this parallel world or not, and if some of the same adults that he’s encountered have counterparts here that have come through and inflicted the same amount of disasters upon the school and its students. Because if they have, Harry can’t see why anyone with half a brain would still have faith in grown-ups.
The older man squints his eyes a little thoughtfully, his gaze never wavering from Harry’s face.
”It’s okay…” Harry mumbles.
”Dumbledore is saying Harry can’t live”, Draco finally breaks the silence, speaking in a strangled voice. ”Because Voldemort must die — but what if
Harry follows Draco down to the dungeons, feeling an odd thrill at the familiarity. The blonde shoots him a sidelong look and tells him that he’s smiling again.
Pansy had said.
… But, you mustn’t let it get to your head. I covered up for you there with young Mr Creevy, you see if he was photographing me, too, your schoolfellows won’t think you’re setting yourself up so much… But let me just say that handing out signed photographs at this stage in your career isn’t very sensible. It’s looks a tad bigheaded, Harry, to be frank. There may well come a time when, like me, you’ll have to keep a stack handy wherever you go, but —” he gives a little chortle, ”I don’t think you’re
Harry frowns.
for a change…
Sirius gingerly puts the cake down on top of the dresser, then licks some frosting off his hands before he crouches down next to the bed. Harry realises Remus must have stopped the levitation charm on the cake when he saw the state Harry was in and left Sirius to catch it when he rushed over to the bed to make sure Harry was alright. It doesn’t look ruined though, Harry sees. The frosting has some finger-shaped indentations, that’s all.
Draco leans in to give him a quick peck on the lips and gives him a pinched smile in greeting, but Harry immediately spots the tension around his eyes and frowns.
that Sirius helped Harry pick out and pay for — and his wide eyes flit over to Sirius briefly before he turns back to Harry with a warm smile and says
Harry stops reading abruptly and shoves the paper away as well. It’s immediately snatched up Pansy, who bends over it eagerly, Daphne and Blaise both craning their necks to read the article over her shoulders.
”Amusing, weren’t they? Potter and Black, very funny indeed, wouldn’t you say?”
”Someone told me Flitwick was a duelling champion when he was young, maybe it’ll be him”, Granger continues, unaware that Ron is busy returning Harry’s pinched smile.
”Wh-what? Where is he? Is he in the Hospital Wing, or—?”
”It will be okay”, Harry says softly. ”Somehow.”
”Not nothing, you clearly have
then laughs giddily when they’re (presumably) repeated back to him in strings of weird sounds.
A highly dangerous witch or wizard is on the loose and we know they have it in for you, Harry! They put your name in the Goblet of Fire, and that is not a matter that should be taken lightly, just because you’ve done all right in the tournament so far!
Harry accepts the cup from him with a smile, grabbing it with both hands, eager to warm them on the hot porcelain. The sleeves of his pyjama top fall down his arms and the light pink scar tissue on the back of his left hand gleams up at him — the words
He bends down and scoops up some bits of grass-snake and ambles over to one of the Skrewt crates, crouching down next to it warily.
”And are both your parents —?”
”Happy Christmas, what!” Bagman adds jovially, clapping his hands together. ”Get any good presents?”
”Really?” Harry says happily, sitting up a little straighter.
The silence that stretches out between them as they both seem to be holding their breaths is almost deafening. Harry’s heart is halfway out of his chest by the time the blonde finally turns back around to face him. His hair is hanging into his face and for a second Harry is distracted by the realisation how long it’s got, but his grey eyes are clearly visible between the white-blonde strands as he peers over at Harry.
Professor Snape inhales deeply, now glaring at pickled toad on the shelf nearest to him.
” the girl exclaims and Harry winces at her shrill, grating voice. ”Is there something going on that I should know about?”
Whereas in the Nearly Universe, homosexuality is more common and accepted (outside pureblood aristocracy, where it's all about the hypocrisy "do what you want in private, but marry a pureblood of opposite sex and carry on the line") and then there’s Harry as well. So even though Draco and Pansy are basically best friends in the Nearly Universe as well (if you think of Harry as Draco’s boyfriend rather than best friend) they’re not *as* close with each other as they are in Canon (and by extension, Pansy and Daphne are a lot closer in the Nearly Universe, whereas I don't think they're even friends in Canon)
”Quite right”, Slughorn says. ”You recognised it, I suppose, by its distinctive mother-of-pearl sheen, yes?”
And the girls reluctantly stop fawning over Cedric Diggory in public as a show of support to the Slytherin champion, which surprises Harry more than anything. He wonders if Draco has talked to Pansy finally, because the girl is obviously making an effort to be nicer to him and he’s almost disproportionately relieved about that. Mostly because it means that there is at least one place at the school where he can relax besides the dormitory, even if it is the Common Room…
Ducking his head, Harry pretends not to notice and concentrates on finishing his breakfast and by the time he does, the blanket of clouds in the enchanted ceiling is almost black and flashing with sporadic bolts of lightening.
"Harry... What..."
He walks inside the dorm, still holding his hands up in surrender. Draco slumps down on the side of his bed, suddenly looking very young and lost. Harry lets his hands fall to his sides again and sighs.
”I’m… no”, Harry says, having no idea who the man is talking about. ”No, I’m not. I can help—”
Mrs Weasley’s voice is finally overpowered as the rest of the portraits join in with the shrieking and hollering, turning the hallway to one jumbled cacophony of noise.
He holds up his other hand and smiles thinly. Draco’s eyes flicker up to meet his for half a second, before focusing on his hand again, his lips never even twitching. Harry sighs.
Swirling back around, she taps the blackboard once more and the words are quickly replaced with three bullet points:
”, the girl snaps back.
And the moment he got even the slightlest scratch, he would make such a fuss that Professor Sprout would send him to the Hospital Wing just to be rid of him, Harry thinks with a wry smile. He can’t see his boyfriend pursuing a career in anything that would require manual labour, at least not if it’s physically rough labour —
Harry looked up at Malfoy’s scowl. How was he still so handsome when he scowled? Maybe the sharpness of his features allowed him to pull off harsh expressions so well. Malfoy threw his hands up, and Harry tried to keep his mind on charmed jeans.
’s worst.
Drinks in hand, they settled into a corner booth. “I prefer wine,” Draco confessed, “but Tom’s is shit. Better to stick to the Dragon Scale Ale.” He held up his pint in toast and Harry mirrored him. “To a job well done.”
A used teacup and a small plate of crumbs told him that Draco had already had breakfast.  Harry couldn’t remember the last time he’d made them a fry-up in the morning.  Harry Levitated the dirty dishes to the sink, pondering that Draco’s desire to avoid him was apparently stronger than his obsessive cleanliness.  He imagined Draco fleeing the table and the dishes at the first sound of Harry waking.  A glance at the front door showed that Draco had left it ajar in his flight.
“Jowan’s a Squib,” Merryn explained.
“I want you, Draco.  You know I want you.   I can't stand watching you parade around with that tight little arse without sinking my cock into it.”  Draco squirmed, but couldn't break free.  Despite being of similar height, Blaise had several stone of muscle on him; while Draco was long and lean, Blaise was broad and solid.
A knock sounded on the door announcing the end of their captivity. Draco felt a quick pang of disappointment at having their time together end, but then Potter squeezed his hand and didn’t let go.
“From the case notes, you seem confident it's being brewed domestically—not smuggled in from abroad—so I'm fairly certain you're looking at the Highlands.  The shelf life of Euphora is only a couple of weeks, and you have people reporting taking it as recently as late July.  If it's being brewed in Britain in the summer, it would have to be in the Highlands.”
Harry was feeling his orgasm build, hoping his legs would hold him, when Draco looked him straight in the eye.
Crossing the landing, Draco swung open their bedroom door and looked at their bed. 'Oh, how I've always wanted to defile these sheets with you.' He pulled Harry into the room and locked the door behind them.
'You're worth all of this and more to me. I'd give you anything. Anything you'll take from me.'
you."
Well, probably Granger and a bunch of Weasleys did. And Longbottom, obviously. But the general public operated under the belief that the Boy Who Could Have Anyone had surely had
“I’m okay with that,” Harry said, surprised to realise it was true. Malfoy looked surprised as well, and possibly disappointed. “Really, you deserve it, Draco.” He bit his lip not to the laugh at the ridiculous way Malfoy’s eyes widened at the use of his given name. This could be fun.
* * *
Draco found himself in a sizeable and homey kitchen with eight sets of eyes burning into him. The expectation was heavy in the air.
The Dark Lord did not celebrate Christmas, but he did not seem to care that, as Headmaster, Severus had maintained the Hogwarts holiday schedule. Draco had returned on the Hogwarts Express and been met by his mother at the station. She had then spent every day of the holiday making up excuses for them to be away from the Manor. She took Draco to select several different trees to decorate the Manor, to visit her friends and distant family, to buy gifts for every person she could think of, and to select groceries from all over England. Whenever the Dark Lord's followers questioned why she did not send her elves on some errand, she would scoff about the poor judgement of lesser beings. No one dared argue with that.
family again?”
Ron was supposed to work with
Harry rushed forward to press Draco against the door as he kissed him hard and deep. Draco let him in, and Harry’s tongue was enveloped in the sweet, wet heat of Draco’s mouth. Draco wanted to see him again. Draco wanted to show up at a party of their friends as couple! He would have liked to kiss Draco forever, but he needed to accept the offer. "I’d like nothing more," he whispered against Draco’s wet lips.
“It's not unusual , Potter.  It's rare, extraordinary, and unique.  And I am not some trinket to be placed in a cupboard.”
Or maybe the jam was from the Victoria Sponge Cake he saw on the table as he entered the kitchen. At the other end of the kitchen was the friend who had helped him rebuild himself after the war and had given him the best thing in his life: his son. Astoria’s hair was swept up in a messy bun, and there was a bit of flour above her left brow. She looked and smelled like the comforts of home, and he couldn’t wait to hug her.
Draco stared at Weasley blankly.  Was the Weasel actually soliciting his advice?  This was so dangerously close to respect that Draco didn't know what to make of it.  Weasley was looking increasingly impatient.
Draco shrugged.  “Perhaps.”
A warm hopeful feeling bloomed in Draco's chest.
“What?”
Draco rolled his eyes dramatically, and Harry almost missed the twitch of his lip. “Come along, ignoramus. And please do keep quiet and refrain from cuddling the livestock.”
Draco’s other hand wrapped around Harry’s cock, holding him in a firm grip that Harry felt could support him were his legs to fail. And they might just give out from the intensity in Draco’s eyes.
“You’re blushing.” Draco stepped forward and cupped Harry’s cheek with his hand. “Look how beautiful you are when you blush.”
His mother took a long sip of tea that Draco suspected was to hide a smile or drown a comment. He decided he was better off not knowing.
"It's not a big deal—"
With a hand on the front door knob, Draco turned to look back at Harry. "Do you have a date to Hermione’s party?"
He shivered.  How on earth could Pot—Harry—say his name like that?  Unbidden images of the night before rushed through his mind and he felt himself growing hard.  “Enough, you.  You stink of sweat and I'm hungry.  For food!” he clarified at Potter's leer.
Stupid Longbottom moving in and fucking up Draco's social life. Those two were supposed to be an eighth-year fling, not the shacking-up together type. And what kind of Gryffindor shagged on a kitchen table? That wasn't noble or romantic! Weren't satin sheets, rose petals, and poetry required for every lovemaking?
Aamu looks up and sees Suonetar rowing through the sky on her boat. Kauko has called her from the heavens. Aamu smiles, even as she sees Kauko crumple. He has done it. He has found his true strength.
Draco smirked as he rolled off Potter, stood, and began smoothing his robes. "I think that has something to do with night falling."
Draco gazed at Harry, perhaps trying to read his intentions from his face. "My mother watches Scorpius during the week. Perhaps she could keep him one evening."
“Hey, is there somewhere else we can have dessert?” Potter’s cheeks were pink as he looked at him with those intense green eyes of his. “I really want to try the chocolate cake, but I was having more fun before we had an audience.”
Harry blinked and then smiled.  “Like your voice.”
Inside was a single bed against the near wall with a small table next to it. There was a desk and a chest of drawers on the far wall with a large window in between. All of the furniture was wooden—probably pine—and the bed held a stack of pinkish-red blankets. Stepping up to the window, Harry looked out at the jagged mountains cast in purple and orange by the setting sun.
"Touche," Weasley muttered. "Good thing the promotion comes with a raise."
Potter tried apologising on Monday, but then gave up and simply sulked.  Glum Potter was rather annoying, but that wasn't Draco's problem.  They weren't friends.
“They’d pick Malfoy?” Ron whispered in disbelief.
“Thuban.”
"Ginny would do it for me. You could probably even stay in her room." Draco raised an eyebrow to show how unlikely it was that he would be permitted to sleep in the bedroom of the only Weasley girl. "Oh, come one. You're as gay as a pink balloon. You are clearly no threat to her virtue. As for why they'd take you in … you still playing housewife?"
As soon as they were both naked, Harry backed Draco onto the bed.  The sight of his long pale body and silver-blond hair falling back against the crisp white duvet was otherworldly.  He stared for a long moment, committing it to memory and feeling grateful for the existence of Pensieves.  He must have stared too long, because a glance at Draco's face showed a small frown and a furrowed brow.  Harry gave his biggest grin and was glad to see the tension leave the other man's features.
Harry felt Draco turn and shove him back against the wall. “I can hear you thinking, Potter. You are radiating nerves!” He was frowning and sounded rather annoyed. Would he change his mind and leave?
person Potter considered a friend who did not treat Draco like an enemy or victim.
“I wasn't sent by Substances,” he admitted.  Weasley frowned and Draco briefly delighted in being able to squash his mood so easily.  Potter's own little frown was less pleasing.
Draco folded the paper and tossed it aside. 'No. The biggest stories are Oliver Wood's latest conquest and the release of a new Weird Sisters album.'
