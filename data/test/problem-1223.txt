"Was that all?"
If Harry still hadn't been entirely sure about his feelings towards the Slytherin, one evening totally ensured it.
make us friends." He once again returned to his book. "Or anything near that", he added.
"I know", Malfoy said. "But it is a fact that there used to be some sort of inbreeding going on in many of the Pureblood families, and especially in the Black family, my mother's side, so..."
Later that night Harry was sitting alone at the dimly lit common room, staring at the already extinguished fire, drowning in his thoughts. He remembered the disappointment and hurt on Ginny's face when he had told him he couldn't sleep with her. Ginny had done the right thing suggesting for them to take a break. He should have done it himself a lot earlier but he hadn't been a man enough to do it. He had
“It’ll be fun,” Harry told him. “Be nice.”
“Here might be better,” he said with as much dignity as he could muster, glancing at the couch.
After Harry’s tactful suggestion earlier that day, the robes Draco was currently wearing fitted him pretty well, compared to the positively indecent ones he’d tried to wear at first. Not that Harry minded that in the slightest. Would have happily encouraged it, in fact, under normal circumstances. But he knew Draco was nervous about this meal with not one but two of his exes, and those robes probably wouldn’t have helped.
“You saw me yesterday,” his son pointed out.
Theodore barked out a laugh. “One in every room he walks into —”
“You’re gorgeous, Draco. Now stop being so grumpy.”
Truth be told, Harry loved that Draco was getting a little, well,
Draco’s infuriating boyfriend continued, “Well, you’ll look amazing whatever you wear.”
Ten years ago, even five years ago, his life had looked so different from this. Looking forward, his younger self would never have imagined this was where he would end up. Quitting his job as an Auror to focus on raising the kids. Creating a better relationship with Ginny than they’d ever had when they were actually together. Draco sodding Malfoy praising his cooking and giving him kisses in the kitchen and stealing all the blankets in bed.
In a rush, Harry said, “Are those the robes you’re planning to wear tonight?”
Draco glanced at Harry, looking mutinous.
When Harry returned from the vegetable patch at the bottom of the garden with a handful of fresh spinach for the salad, his boyfriend hastily shut the kitchen cupboard he’d been peering into.
He left Draco reclining on the couch, looking lazy and full, one hand rubbing his stomach through his enticingly tight waistcoat.
I've taken on a new project where I'm taking two things one would never put together unless they were me and had no life. Stranger things and Figure skating. While yes this may take some time off of this current project, I want to explore further and see what I can do with this..
Right now I'm mostly trying to set up the world for myself. Hence it can all feel a bit jumpy.
“Who did it.”
It kept surprising him. How well everyone was getting along. The mixed houses truly had done them well and Draco only hoped Hogwarts would take something from this experiment and use it for the following years. The house rivalry was still there. But so much milder and much more in a playful manner. The civility might have to do a lot with everyone here, no matter what side they had been on, going through the same process of mourning and grieving and clamping onto what little sanity some had left.
Sunday training had gotten more intense. But thanks to Potter they seemed to catch up pretty easy. This week they’d change things up seeing as most roommates seemed to have at least an idea on how to work together. Hell. They all got along well enough to study together and help one another with difficult subjects.
“Shoulder straight, follow the rhythm of her walking, relax your hips a little.. there we go.” Harry hummed looking up at Draco with his bright eyes and blinding smile. Nearly making Draco fall of the horse for completely different reasons. He did as told, following the horse. Soon enough he felt relaxed enough to start focusing on finding the leopard he knew they’d never find. Casting some useless finding spells he knew of off the top of his head. “I think we’ll have to try again tomorrow. My spells aren’t coming up with anything.” He said, looking down at harry.
“I want you to know. I am not against you. You can come to me with your troubles. I can tell you are troubled.” The man spoke in his heave accent, placing the band on Draco’s wrist and saying the incantation.. Draco felt the magic wash over him. It was warm, it scared him at first. But soon it was rather soothing. Like a new sort of confidence. It made him stand up straighter, stronger in his shoes.
“You ok there bud?” Harry asked, concern dripping in his voice.
Anyway writers ramble over. See you on the next one <3
“Just wai…” too late the other stormed in, jaw nearly dropping. “Way to ruin the surprise Potter” Draco muttered, stepping away from Hermoine who just beamed.
“Alright. But one scoff and I’m out.” He muttered. Letting Harry drag him to the bar.
“morning…” he muttered, squeezing his blanket slightly. “..I hope you lot know I know nothing more of what happened and I can’t speak on it.”
Instead of attempting to read more he looked out the window of the common room. Seeing Harry Ride down in he Valley. He could just make out who out of the two Was Harry. Mostly because one of the dots had red fiery hair that screamed Ron Weasley.
“How on earth did you manage to make hangover potion taste nice.”
“I suppose I’ll follow your lead.” He muttered.
“But of course. What would mister Blaise like?” she asked, turning her attention to the other finally.
They walked to breakfast together but split up quite soon to sit with their own friends. Overall it was nice. There was some chat about the ball and excitement for class. Mostly Hermoine who was loudly questioning some of the other purebloods about how wizarding cooking was different from muggle cooking.
“Good… we’ll also be holding this.” He took up a twig, a quick tap of his wand turning it into a pole. “You decide the pace today. We’ll work on speeding up later..” he held it out, letting Draco take one end. Who took it rather hesitant.
“Neville have you seen his coat? He can’t go out like this..” Draco wasn’t really following the conversation. He was making an attempt at getting up really. He heard some stuff about him losing his coat before warm fabric was draped over his shoulders.
He took a sip. “No mate you skull it. Toss it back alright.” Seamus grinned, something dangerous about that grin.
Harry laughed softly. “Dumbass.” He whispered.
Harry’s POV
Harry looked at Draco. He seemed determined. Grasping his wand. No pole to drag along this time, they would have to stick together by other means… so he reached out his magic as they ran. Draco looked at him confused for a second but latched on. This way they would stick together even through the thickening mist as they sprinted forward.
“We should try riding her  this week too. how about we try Friday afternoon. No one will be around due to the study group.” Harry said, leading the horse back to the field. Draco looked at him like he’d just told him the moon was made of cheese.
He was shaken out of his thoughts by a steaming mug and a plate full of cookies. “bout time Potter.”
“Oh… Malfoy..” she muttered, being pushed in by Weasley whom was fuming at the mere sight of him. Drawing his wand.
“Sure! If they can keep up with me. We should bring Luna and Ginny too.” Ron smirked at Harry. Whom rolled his eyes.
“A literal tiger Harry.. I’m sorry but what?” he asked. “Explain to me why you think there is a literal tiger in Hogwarts and no one else has seen it.”
“We meditate. So sit on the bed. Feet on the floor. Palms up.” Potter hummed. The git was enjoying this huh. Taking the lead in yet another thing. This was becoming a theme and Draco wasn’t a fan of it.
“You’ll have to learn as we go.” Draco hummed, walking up to him and holding his hand out, acting more confident than he felt.
“They are indeed as comfy as they look.” Draco nodded approvingly. Stepping into Harry’s space for the second time this night and wrapping his arms around his waist. He wasn’t ashamed to admit that maybe he did like drunk and clingy Draco.
“Something like that happened to me” Draco was definitely not expecting that.
Harry only registered the last event. He dropped next to Draco, holding him and looking for his pulse while a blue fire circle appeared around them, making the room fully visible for the first time.
“I think I’ve heard something about them, not good, I’m afraid” Harry confessed, now with the whole picture in front of him.
“I happen to have a lot of pictures of you. I also happen to know how your wand looks like” he kept saying you. He was pretty sure, Harry had to give him that, as much as he disliked the man.
A couple minutes later Harry found it. He had no idea where souls were supposed to be, but his magic had reacted at the base of Draco’s neck. The blond swallowed, he was sweating and had started exhaling through his mouth, but he managed to keep his posture and did not crack his concentration. Harry’s magic embraced the blonde’s soul and the healer started to recite the second part of the incantation.
“Hi” he greeted kneeling in front of the girl “Can I help you with something?” he asked. The girl looked scared, like she was going to get in trouble if she was caught speaking to him.
Draco had gone straight to the coffee stand and Harry had made his way to pick some food for them. He made it as varied as he could without risking a stomach issue and walked back to the table they had chosen. Draco had been acting really odd that morning. Barely speaking to him and flashing him sneaky side looks. Harry had wanted to ask him but the blond would avoid every attempt: he had even started singing when Harry had asked why he had been staring at him when he woke up.
“Nothing bad, a simple soul trial. No one loses, they just get one result or the other, whichever makes them happier” Harry stood up. If Draco was in there, going through some kind of test he was going to help him. He will bring him back “What do you think you are doing, my dear?”
“Fuck, Draco. If you do that I’ll lose it” he warned and it drew a pleased smile in Draco’s face, so, obviously, he did it again and Harry buried his face in his neck while his orgasm took over his body, sending Draco over the edge too.
He took the bottle of ink and his eyes fixed in a strange scar in Harry’s left hand. It looked like someone had carved some kind of sentence in his skin with a knife or something like that.
“Aw, that’s so sweet” she cooed while puffing the pillows to make him more comfortable.
“Draco Malfoy, I’m your fucking healer, open the damn door”
He knew what that was. He knew what it meant that the green strand was cut right before the veil, he knew and he wanted to cry.
He knew the library was on the other side, he just needed to go through the gap on the wall. Would he fit? Yeah, if Harry had fitted he would. He struggled with a string of the sweater that had gone loose and tangled itself in a pointy rock but he finally made it to the other side.
“Relax” Ellias growled and they both made silence. When they entered the bathroom they headed straight to a huge mirror on the wall. Ellias went first, disappearing through it like it was water. Harry looked around but no one seemed to notice anything. Harry went in next and Draco followed close.
“Yes, we did. Well, Harry did. He talked to him about Rasputin and his relationship with his family. He did not know he was a wizard, but I guess that was his intention” Draco went to look at Harry but found out he was no longer in the room.
“No! It’s nothing” she looked suspicious for a moment but eventually relaxed and gave him a sweet kiss on the top of his head.
Many had told him that he had a thing for paranoia, that the war had destroyed more than his reputation and taken away a lot more than just his freedom. He had been cleared from most charges as well as his mother, but the life had become unbearable in England for the whole family. They had lost everything, or at least, everything the ministry thought the possessed, but the Malfoys had always ways to rise up again. They stablished in France, and for the time his father was sane in Azkaban they had managed to live, not survive, for the first time in years. Draco could not say he was happy, but merely content. Ten years had passed since the war, since the last time he had seen his country, since the last time he had to worry for his life, even if things were not what he had imagined when he was a little spoiled boy, they were managing just fine.
“You are finally back” the voice whispered. Draco saw a shadow but he didn’t dare to move. He was confused, he was sure he had never been there, and yet his companion was implying it was not the first time they met “Or should I say, you are finally here?” yeah, that made more sense. He wanted to answer but he couldn’t find his voice. He had the vaguest feeling that talking to that person was not going to bring anything good.
The tray had disappeared as soon as they had finished, leaving only a bowl with fruit behind. Harry was feeding him a grape while Draco commented everything in the movie.
“You’ve been to silent since we arrived here. Do you prefer to go somewhere else?”
He needed to say something. But, was there anything that could compensate his past actions? Anything to make it right, after so long? He was not going to fix anything, he knew it, he had been an idiot, and nothing will change that, but he needed to do it, he had to.
He reached the bottom and continued to walk through the narrowest passage he had ever seen. The RUMMA one had been massive compared to that, but he had to keep going forward. The answers were there, in the library.
“The point is, it was too much to handle and I ended up experimenting on a vice or two. This one stuck up the longest until Teddy caught me and asked me to stop” he crushed the last of the cigarette in his fist, to Draco’s apparent horror, but he relaxed once it was obvious he had vanished it “Pathetic, isn’t it?” silence followed his statement, and he did not dare to look at the blond.
“Sorry. But I do think is a good idea. Do you need to get ready?” he still had the smell of vomit in his nose and he was in urgent need of a bath, but he could manage with a shower.
“I don’t remember nothing like that, but I bet is not a joke, so, please, continue”
He had come closer to the witch a couple of years after the end of the war. She had walked into him one day when he was leaving St. Mungo after a class. From then on, they had made it a tradition to have lunch once a week. Sometime they would mix it up with the Weasleys’, but they never missed one. He had even been one of the healers present when she gave birth to the twins, and that bonded them probably forever.
“What do you mean?” the headmaster turned and locked his eyes on the other wizard for the first time since he showed up, before his skin paled “Impossible” he murmured “You cannot be alive” his hand was trembling “Potter, what have you done?”
“Erase that cocky smile from your face, Harry Potter, or I’ll shove your breakfast up your…”
They woke him up, in the middle off the night. His father told him to get dressed, quickly. He saw his sisters put on the clothes were they had hidden the jewels, he had no idea why.
Ten minutes had passed when Alexei seemed to calm himself enough. Harry stood up and handed him a glass of water from his desk that had been definitely empty, but the boy was not looking, so he filled it up magically.
“Yes…” Harry said in a whisper, not sure if it was the right answer at all.
“Drarling! How are you?” Blaise was there, sharing a cup of coffee with Harry, who had stood up to help him walk without looking at him, for some reason.
“Did you figure something out?” Draco asked, changing the topic, while bending over to retrieve a paper from under the bed, catching Harry’s attention.
(See the end of the chapter for
“I miss you too, Teds. I’m sorry I have been so busy, but I have a friend who is really ill and needs my help. I promise I will try to make some time for us and we will go play Quidditch to that hill you like or do whatever you want. Please, don’t cry”
“What is that thing doing in our room?” Draco asked while Harry moved towards the animal cautiously and reached for the parchment roll. The bird took the document between its claws and stretched its leg. Once Harry took the paper, the crow left the room through the window and disappeared in the sky “Why can’t Russians use a damn owl like every normal person?”
“Oh god. Does everybody call him Harry now?” he protested while the mediwizard accommodated him in his bed and started putting fresh bandages over the injuries.
“You, Draco Malfoy, are a horrible little creature. Here I was, controlling myself to not disturb you and you go and call me out. Ungrateful child” she dramatized while he controlled the laughter.
“I don’t trust you to stay in the house, as soon as I let you down you will run to your workshop and Harry was really specific about that, especially after seeing it” she stated and he rolled his eyes. He was not going to fall to the basement or start nipping himself with every wood splinter.
“Offended?”
At some point it all vanished. Draco couldn’t remember anything else, so he assumed he had fallen asleep in Potter’s bed, beside him, in his arms. Oh, God. He had to relax. He let go the air he hadn’t realized he was holding and took a second to enjoy, I mean, analyze, their position and find a way out of it; but it was the same time it took Harry to wake up, and for some unknown reason Draco found himself pretending to be asleep. He felt Harry tense around him, but instead of letting him go like Draco supposed it would happen, he relaxed once more and even moved his fingers, brushing the blonde’s arm softly. Draco could have sworn he was even closer now, but before he could properly register that information the warm feeling disappeared, the mattress moved and footsteps could be heard in the room right before a door closed.
“Thank you Weasley.” Draco chuckled.
“We did.. but this is just the start isn’t it. Leigh isn’t to be underestimated.”
By the time they came home, just in time before the ministry would be set on his ass, he was drained. Dropping down on the brand new, yellow loveseat the elves had deemed perfect. Groaning softly.
Draco pretended to think for a moment. “Deal. Can you believe this man is not a Slytherin?” he asked, looking at Longbottom. Who burst into laughter.
“You’re the literal devil Harry.”
“You’ll be fine. Come on lets meet with Pansy, Pray she has a better roommate.”
Something was different the next morning. Draco had done his usual get out before dawn and get back into your own bed after a nice shower. Despite yesterday being quite difficult he felt well rested and ready to face today.
500 gr of granulated sugar
“I am? Are you? I haven’t seen you all day.. you even missed lunch!” Pansy pestered him.
Blaise elbowed him. “even the elf knows about you and your sweets addictions. Draco you’re getting out of hand.”
“mmm yeah sure.” Draco slurred god he was drunk, and only now realising how badly.
“No one. Shut up pans. I swear to god.” His eyes darted for a moment across the room towards Harry. Who happened to catch his eyes and flush lightly himself. oh merlin..
He didn’t remember much of last night. He knew he danced with Potter for a bet. Which apparently they won, judging by the almost empty bottle of fire whiskey. He remembered some of the serious talk they had. But not much.
“Rightfully so. Wanna grab breakfast then?”
“we need to talk.” Draco froze, he really didn’t want to talk about it more. He was tired and he felt that if Potter brought it up again he might tear up.
Harry managed to convince him for one more song which was called “wannabe” very hyped up.
“Amour it is.”
He choose instead to go for a nice hot and steamy shower. By the time he got out he was thoroughly steamed through. His cheeks slightly flushed. His hair combed back the way he used to wear it. He got into his uniform for dinner, and made his way to the common room. Picking up his book again while he waited for Pansy and Blaise to pick him up for dinner.
It had been a few weeks since they were pardoned. It wasn’t great.. far from it. His mother had shut down completely. Most of Draco’s days, if he got out of bed that was, were spend looking for his mum and making sure she ate what the house elves had cooked. They seemed to have forgiven them. They were allowed to leave, find a better place. But they took care of their masters.
They walked back in comfortable silence ignoring the glares Draco got for simply walking with Harry. But at their dorm Draco remembered something. “Potter?”
“I did not.” He croaked. Taking a sharp breath ready to be hit with a curse. He felt unable to lie.. veritaserum.. perhaps that was why the water had tasted so good.
Eventually he got a hold of himself. Grabbing his wand with his left arm and casting a tempus. It was nearly 3am. Perfect. Without thinking he transfigured himself into the small snow leopard. The little creature was a little tougher than he was and he managed to use his right arm despite the pain.
He made Harry feel like he had a purpose again. He had to save Draco. If he could do that. He could save himself.
He looked at the want. It looked nothing like his old one. It was longer. He picked it up. it felt uneasy.. he tried to cast a lumos. To which the wand simply flew out of his hand and back into the box. “Not that one then. I must say I am surprised. Unicorn wands are hard to change… lets try this.”
“Wouldn’t dare too.” Draco mumbled, leaning onto him as they walked towards the shrieking shack. “Oh no not there. That place is haunted Harry.” He looked up at the other with big eyes.
They watched Ron walk up to his girlfriend, taking her hand and smiling at her, hermoine flushing lightly and shooting quick glances at Draco and Blaise whom had joined with Pansy at his side. The two of them grinned back. Pansy however was shooting the two of them glares, knowing full well who were responsible for dressing Hermoine Granger like a fancy pureblood.
“Malfoy. Welcome to clubnight. Bottoms up mate.” He gestured for Draco to open the bottle, which he did, hesitantly bringing it to his lips. Smirnoff.. only 4%? Couldn’t be too bad right?
Kneed until the dough is elastic before adding the sunflower seeds. Coat a bowl with olive oil, put the bread in and make sure all sides are covered in a bit of oil. Cover and let rise for an hour. Or use the rising spell pip taught you.
He barely registered what Kingsley Shacklebolt said. Naming the accusations and cases against them. he felt his sleeve being pulled up. revealing that horrible mark on his arm.. it was bleeding again. In his nightmares.. he would scratch it, one time he’d found a bite mark on it and tasted blood. He flinched when whoever was revealing it pushed his finger on it. He heard his mother speak. A yell from his father which made him flinch back before he heard what sounded like a silencing charm.
At this point he was about half way through. His eyes, darting from the pages to look over the common room. Weasley seemed quite calm today. Playing some wizards chess with Granger. Clearly winning. She didn’t seem to get the game. Even after all these years of being conditioned by Weasley.
“The wrackspurts aren’t an excuse Luna. You know this as well as I do.”
The rest of the evening was rather pleasant. Talks of Samhain and the traditions around it. Even a small demonstration on proper waltzing by Pansy and Neville out of all people. It was a pleasant Sunday hangout, definitely something they’d do more often.
“Me neither..” Draco uttered back. Not ready to admit he was growing quite out of breath. Another shot and Blaise and Neville were out. Blaise had slipped and let go of the pole. The only ones matching up to their speed were Finnigan and Thomas.
Draco was sat at one of the desks. Planning around his schedule appropriately. He knew he would have to spend a lot of time in his room. Hexes and jinxes might be forbidden. But he knew there were possible loopholes. After all who would believe him. Who wouldn’t think it was justified to hurt a death eater.
For the 9th time this night Harry walked up. this time with something called snow white and the seven dwarves. Draco groaned as the concept was explained. It was a fairy tale about some princess.
He walked to the field with Hermoine and Ron. Talking about their usual stuff. This year they would be celebrating Samhain with a ball. Ron had an actual suit this time and Hermoine wouldn’t tell them what she would be wearing this time. No matter how much Ron was begging to tell her.
“Do you think I’m happy to be here? Being stared at? Fearing for my life?! Just get it on with then prat. Do it. Show your little friends you’ve got a pair and then leave it.” He lost control of his voice. He was seething with anger. The spell was recast over him and he dropped his head back down. All he could do now was close his eyes and relax his features. Refuse them the satisfaction of seeing any hurt on his face.
“Well Pans. If you want to do more advanced stuff. Why don’t you bring it up? I’m certain no one would have a problem with it.”
“Blaise if he would let you, you’d bring in a new one every day.. several times a day.”
Things were happy the coming week. No one had bothered him much. He’d been called a certain gay slur a few times for dancing with Harry Potter out of all people but.. Potter himself had shut that down quite quickly.
“I’ll move it to the morning. I was thinking of doing that either way.” He said, elbowing her softly.
He got down to the grass. Trotting through the crispy leaves blown from the forrest. Eventually he was sprinting and running, hopping up and down pillars. Each breath and pant clearing his mind. Perhaps his body hadn’t been as tired as he thought it was. Just heavy with worry and bad thoughts.
as always i love reading comments<3
Draco often silently joined them. Granger had proven to be quite forgiving and knowledgeable. He respected her. Though thanks to Pansy she had gotten a bit spicier and no one dared to go against her these days. It was her way or no way.
“Prepare to be blown away. Salt and sweet is honestly the most perfect combination.” Draco hummed, putting a quick charm over the bread that kept it fresh and kept it from being too hot to eat.
Draco deemed her a friend at this point. He had apologized to her a while ago. Instead of accepting it. She had pulled him into a hug. Told him that him showing interest and willingness to learn was enough. She was bright. Truly deserving of her title as brightest witch of their age. She was fair and honest. A bit straightforward at times but.. she was good. Nice to hang out with.
They started with a formfitting dress.. but she looked too uncomfortable. Gorgeous. But not comfortable.
“I’m sorry what? I thought you could handle your drinks.”
He woke up late. Nearly 9am. Potter seemed to have already left. Seemingly the contract didn’t work when one of them didn’t realize the other was right there. He didn’t give himself time to wake up properly. He sped out of the room as fast as he could muster. Making his way, luckily avoiding any students, over to the infirmary where he turned back. Knocking weakly on the door. Turning back had taken a lot of energy and the pain seemed even worse. His vision was spinning again, a concussion he realized by now. The door was opened by Pomfrey. Who called back to someone.
“Nothing to be sorry about potter. You would do the same for me.” He whispered, unable to stop a single tear strolling down his cheek. Fuck it. He hated seeing the guy that had been so strong this whole time, the man that had saved the world, that had saved his life more than once, broken and beaten down like this. He didn’t deserve this. He deserved so much better. He felt privileged to be allowed to help him. To care for him for once and here this stupid motherfucker was apologizing for needing help.
Back to the challenge Seamus had presented him with. He Smirked, raising the bottle and taking a few hefty gulps before handing it back.
“Must’ve been. As long as it stays on your side of the room.” He huffed, gathering his stuff to dress up for sports later.
Wednesday had been great. Absolutely fantastic.
Draco turned to Harry, whom was wearing a big, excited grin. “you cannot be possibly excited to do this Potter.”
Weasley had taken it upon himself to defeat and educate everyone in chess. He was smiling more. Rivers poked fun at him from time to time but it worked. They got along fine. They were masterful thieves too when it came to getting alcohol.
There was some rustling. Potter seemed to have accepted and so did the others as they all got up. Draco managed to hide behind a chair just in time. Nearly yelping at the pain shooting though his right paw. Right.. be careful now.
Harry seemed to flush a little. “I suck at potions?”  if Draco could he would’ve thrown something at him. He settled for a scowl his way before looking ahead of him.
“Mr Malfoy.” He looked up. Were they addressing him?.. they were.
He had made good progress. He was feeling better. Less and less did he have to put up a front of being happy and doing well. He was enjoying himself and finding things to be happy about.
“Yes of course you are. All of us have! It’s a muggle game.” He handed the bottle back to him, noting the others confused expression. “Ah… see in college muggles often join these groups right… and when they are let into one. They have a how do I say this.. ritual of sorts? Sometimes its completing embarrassing challenges, other times its icing. Where other members of the club or group hide a bottle of Smirnoff ice. Multiple actually. And when the challenged finds it. They chug it. We made our own version where every member of the 8th years class chugs one at first. And the rest of the night the others buy their drinks. You drink what’s served. No questions asked. Now chug.” He explained, others had stopped now, watching intently. Pansy was yet again wearing a Satan-like grin. She had set this up.
“If you intend to be talked out of any dress that’ll make you prettier than her.” Draco said.
He hopped into the dorm, crouching when he heard hushed voices. “we searched the entire castle. Something must have happened.” It was Potter.
“Floors getting a little close. To be honest.” He muttered, feeling Harry lift his arm and ducking under it to support him.
Next was the muddy puddle. “Were not gonna make that..” Malfoy exclaimed.
Draco just nodded in reply.
Draco didn’t feel far off from losing his own mind. Their faces.. they kept flashing in front of his eyes. He didn’t know when the last time was he had gotten a decent sleep. He wasn’t in Azkaban yet. But he knew he’d be there soon. He was hoping to go emotionally numb as soon as possible, die shortly after. That was all there was left in him.
Draco nearly chocked on his drink. “Potter. I’m at least as good if not better than you come on now. You were acting out an entire musical over there.” He huffed, puffing out his cheeks.
“Don’t apologize.” Draco managed to blurt out, feeling fairly sober all of a sudden. He turned away. “Don’t. I deserved it.” He crossed his arms over his body, clinging the shirt in front of it.
Next to him Harry hummed. “Absolutely perfect. 10/10 want another slice.” He commented. Closing his eyes as he took another bite.
Either way he did as told. Angry to admit that yes. The meditation had calmed him down significantly. And yes. He was feeling more evened out and perhaps ready to focus on finding his core.
“Ah.. I dreamed something about a cat last night. Must’ve been someone’s pet sensing my nightmares.” Harry shrugged it off. Taking note of how Draco’s expression relaxing.
“Agreed.” They turned to Weasley, who’s mood seemed to have soured. Draco shot him a drunken grin.
“Three broomsticks!” Ron called. Leading the group with Finnigan and Thomas on his heels. The rest of them followed not far behind.
He faintly caught the others spells. The hurt turned into soreness. “I cant do the hemoraging in your eye. I don’t want to blind you.” Blaise uttered, holding Draco’s face in his hands. “You shouldn’t let them do this to you.” he whispered.
Wednesday Draco and Blaise headed into Hogsmeade with some special permission of McGonagall. Hermoine walking in between them. Blaise had taken some effort to style he hair up. nothing too fancy but it would help with the dress picking. “What do you say Blaise? Red? Black?”
He found his paws leading him into his dorm, three of them anyway, the frightened jump from earlier seemed to have shifted his bone somehow and the pain was worse. He limped into the room, dazed eyes looking up at potter who was staring at the door.
“Thank you.” was the stuffed reply he got. He could feel the shirt of his pjs getting damp. He didn’t mind. If anyone deserved a good fucking cry it was Harry. He didn’t comment on it. He didn’t ridicule him.
“Surely. Its been a week and it already rubbing off on you Harry.” Neville snickered.
“You could say that.” Draco sat up, making harry turn to him.
“Too much. I don’t even know how I got back.” Draco snorted at that.
He felt rather satisfied, the uneasiness from earlier had left his body completely by now. He looked at Potter beside him. His eyes darting to the dopey smile on his lips. He certainly liked seeing Harry like this. Satisfied, a bit sweaty, slightly flushed, handsome, a bit messy. Bit like one would expect him to look after a good shag. Not that Draco would want to know or knew what that looked like. That was simply the best way to put it. Really. Trust me.
And so they did. Draco was ready to collapse after the first km. but he pushed on. Harry noticed however. Taking the lead. 1km of running, 500m sprint and 500m walking then another 1km of running. Instead of 10 minutes of stretching he let Draco catch his breath. Then took 20 minutes to explain and do some leg exercises as well as some pushups and its varieties before repeating the running pattern.
“Told you Potter. I can make bread. Though this is where my expertise ends. I haven’t really gone much further in learning to cook.”
“I knew I didn’t dream about you.. what happened to you? did your hunt go wrong?” Potter asked as if he was talking to a small puppy and Draco melted. He wasn’t in the right state of mind. He let out the tiniest mew he could muster.
“Master Draco. You are staring again. The bread will not kneed itself that’s what Pips mother always says.” He gave her a smile.. he didn’t speak much.
“That is for practical and not failing class purposes!”
No library time, as much as that hurt his soul. Perhaps some late night walks?  Early morning wasn’t a possibility without having to wake Potter up. He wasn’t much of a morning person either, so late night it was. He didn’t bother planning in time with his friends. He didn’t want to burden them with seeing him. He was too controversial. Blaise could help raise Pansy’s status and she would be good. Draco just needed to focus on getting as many O’s as he could possibly get. It was only a year. He could get through this. Perhaps if he worked hard enough, he could go and get a healer’s apprenticeship. Though unlikely, he felt confident enough to dream a little.
“So.. what do we do? I usually use one of those packets from the supermarket for bread.” Harry muttered.
He raised a brow when, while walking. Seamus pushed a bottle in his hand.
Losing his train of thought he stared across  the room. Nearly jumping out of his skin when someone plopped down beside him. He cussed under he breath, putting his wand back where he’d swiftly gotten it from. “Pansy what did I tell you about doing that?” he hissed, turning his gaze back to his book.
“About what?” he asked, staring at the melting whipped cream.
“Malfoy I know what a stinging hex feels like. I managed to walk to the dorms through it. But I felt every punch. I passed out 3 hours ago and woke up to my body being incredibly sore. It only cleared when you healed it. So tell me. Who did it.”
“Good to see you awake Mr. Malfoy.” Minerva.. fantastic.
“They’d get me put into Azkaban.. everything is better than that.” Draco chocked, wrapping his arms around his friend. Blaise had been cold up until now… it was nice to have him be there now. “Please heal me Blaise… it fucking hurts..” he muttered against the others chest, tears soaking into his sweater.
Next up were the boys. Which all went relatively smooth. Starting with Blaise. Who whispered something to the professor, possibly trying to pair him and Draco. But the man shook his head. “The bands will choose what is right. No exceptions.”
They stood there for a few minutes until eventually Potter let go to Draco’s dismay.
“alright, I’ll get her into a jog right, just lean against me a little, move with the horse. It is gonna be a bit bumpy.” Harry muttered in his ear. That was it. A shiver ran up his spine. Harry didn’t seem to notice as he sped the horse up a little. He leaned into him grasping the saddle. “Just relax Draco. I’ve got you. you can’t fall.”
The now 15 minute ride felt like an hour and he was thankful when they finally were back at the stables. Getting off right after Harry. Immediately regretting doing it faster than needed. His inner thighs cramping up from the position they had been in. he cursed.
He looked beside him… his father looked how he felt. His mother looked worse. She looked terribly thin, perhaps not as bad as when the dark lord had lived in their home but.. she knew what was coming too.. she was being held back from hugging him. He just curtly nodded at her. Trying to give her a tired smile.
“Even you Draco.”
a.. basic line of respect and perhaps an alliance had been formed between them. Draco didn’t dare call it friendship. He was too afraid of the consequences that would have. He already got nasty looks when they walked to class together.
“Anderson. Do you want help or not.” He sounded rather annoyed.
“Furthermore I would like to introduce a few new teachers this year… Professor Slughorn will continue his position as potions teacher and will be head of Slytherin… Professor Anderson will take on muggle studies and Professor Leigh will take over the Defense of the dark arts and will be the head of Gryffindor. I myself will continue my Charms classes.” She pointed to the two new teachers. Anderson, a tree of a man with long blonde hair braided back. A beard and a pair of piercing, scary blue eyes. Leigh, a short middle aged lady with the biggest grin. Brown curls in a tight ponytail. They looked like they should be teaching the others subject.
“Alright. Let’s go then.”
Draco was having none of that. he couldn’t risk being blamed for an imperius spell.
“Nah nah you earned it. Come on. I’ll protect you.” Somehow those last three words… hit him differently. They made him smile unwillingly.
“She almost worries as much as your mother.”
“Don’t be a git. It’ll be fine.”
Giving Harry a more serious look. “I.. I’m only saying this once Potter. But.. I’d prefer you to stay too. I really do. So please.. Please do..” with that he pulled away. Remembering the Bread and the fact it had to be pulled out. Harry simply smiled at him, nodding. There was something soft about his eyes that Draco couldn’t quite place. He shook it off, saving their bread just in time from being burnt and pulling it from the oven, placing it on the cutting board.
“Lost it I think.” He snickered. “Trust fall potter.” He said, way to loud as he let himself fall backwards from the bench, right into Potters hands. “Caught me, good reflex” he commented, not getting up and leaning against the other.
To be truly honest Draco hadn’t been too invested in the others. But he knew little cliques were starting to form. He usually floated between the study group, fending for himself and playing chess. Perhaps he should try to go to the next Hogsmeade trip with the others. It was Samhain after all and everyone would go dressed up.. perhaps he should.
“Lucky me.” Draco rolled his eyes. Watching the others leave for breakfast. “You really wanna grab breakfast? I’m not exactly thrilled to have to sit with these assholes either.”
“Spoiled git. Want me to add baileys?”
“What’s a supermarket?” Draco asked, taking out a piece of parchment and writing down the steps. He found it easier to write them down so he wouldn’t forget any. He’d found that especially after the war he was a bit confused and forgetful at times.
“Oh yes.. say Potter…”
Their cloaks swissing behind them like the girls dresses were, they should have taken them off before but it was too late now. Soon the others of the school began to join on the dancefloor. It was a custom to do a first waltz at balls like these before doing anything else.
“Potter you do realize I was on house arrest right? I haven’t worked out in quite some time even before..”
Ron had nodded along happily before following Harry’s gaze over to the table Malfoy had been dropped off at.
“Do you want to take it? And take a jar of jam too. it stays good for a long time and it makes a nice gift.” Draco hummed, packing away the jar they had taken Jam from. Harry gladly took the offer, putting the butter in two small jars. It really wasn’t a lot but it was nice enough to not let go to waste.
“You’re awful. I shouldn’t have agreed.” He muttered.
This chapter is rather selfindulgent and fluffy. I've been needing some good vibes.
Monday turned out to be horrible. A full day of classes and teachers who found it a great idea to make their students drown in homework from day one. Potions brought them an essay on the importance of newt eyes in luck potions. Charms class turned into a sobbing hour. Where they all brought up happy memories from the past, but due to no work being done in class they would have to practice visualization charms by themselves, an ocean in a bottle was to be delivered by Friday. Muggle studies, a class that everyone had to take this year, was the only class that seemed fun. Well it was fun unless you had seen the last muggle studies teacher being murdered and eaten right in front of you almost a year back.
“We won’t have to make friends Potter. You’re staying on your side of the room. I’ll stay on mine. We don’t bother one another. You keep out of my business. I’ll keep out of yours. I do not need your pity nor your friendship. I’m certain you have better things to do like being the golden boy.” Draco spat. Great going on being friendly with the man he would have to spend a whole year with. But he wasn’t done yet. Oh no he had a sudden surge of confidence and he best make good use out of it. He opened his mouth to say more. But potter stopped him.
They spend some time together. Talking about useless stuff till deep into the night. Harry was quite open. Talking to him about how he felt lost on what to do after school and how traveling seemed like the only thing that felt right. They spoke of perhaps taking a trip to France with their friends, see the old remnants of wizarding society’s. and to this Disney thing that was supposed to be magic for muggles and everyone else.
“what can I say mate. I’m very convincing when I want something.” Harry hummed, carelessly opening the bottle and bringing it to his lips. Taking a sip before handing it to Draco. “You do have talent for it Draco. You were almost as good as me.”
“It’s fine. They got their kick out of it. I’m sure they’ll be done with it for at least a while now.” Draco averted his eyes.
The Parvati twins had been put together. For twins they had had quite the shouting match before going to sleep.
Potter dramatically walked around him. Pointing at him with the words. Draco just flushed and looked confused. Folding his arms across his chest in embarrassment. At least he was until the words “… but I want it that way..” played, dramatically mouthed by Harry and sung by half the pub.
Potter grabbed the notebook, rustling though the pages. “a few weeks back. I had some bad dreams.. I take note of my dreams, its been a habit since.. It’s been a habit.” Draco couldn’t relax now.. he new exactly which nightmare. “.. I calmed down mid nightmare because of something. Something that’s been getting into our dorm. Last night when you were gone and I was.. panicking about it. It happened again, except I was fully conscious.” He paused for a moment as if thinking on how to word this correctly. He couldn’t seem to find the words. “… I know this is going to sound insane. But a literal tiger has been getting into our dorm. It seems to know when something is up or something. The first time I noticed all over my bed and clothes. But yesterday it came in. someone seemed to have hurt it. It left before I could get it looked at this morning but I believe it’s out there. And I was wondering if you could help me track it. It clearly needed help and it’s helped me…” Potter looked at him with sad puppy eyes and Draco couldn’t help but let out a relieved breath.
He had exchanged letters with his former friends. Theodore Nott had moved far away. His mother had taken him to France and they were starting their life there. Pansy was joining but had let him know she would come to him when she felt ready to talk. He respected her wishes… Goyle.. well Goyle had gone mental and wouldn’t be joining them any time soon.
another late update. I graduated this week so I'll be free all summer!
“Good job. Come on lets go!” Harry called, running forward again. Sprinting to the next obstacle. The climbing wall.
“Man has got to keep his options open doesn’t he.”
Hermoine flushed slightly. “Only if its not too much effort. I would like to impress him.” She whispered, looking past Draco at her Boyfriend.
“Thank you Luna. If you.. you know ever need any help let me know alright? I know I haven’t been a good cousin.. or family at all but I would like to make up.”
He limped over, bumping his nose at the hand. God he felt so weak for giving in but he needed I, he felt touch starved.
“I’m sorry.. I tried to wake you up. are you alright?”
“Fine.” He didn’t dare challenge him to see if that was true. He hurried and got clean and dressed, tying his hair up as he walked out the door with Harry. Immediately going to Blaise who was sat in the common room looking worse for wear. Handing him a vail. “Drink up. How much did you have Blaise.” He scoffed, watching the other throw back the potion.
“It’s a small peace offering. You’re still doing tomorrow with me right? I’ve planned a run out for us. Blaise told me you are best bribed with Hot chocolate and these.” He tossed a small bag of chocolate frogs in into his lap. “I’m also supposed to tell you “I won’t bring up whatever happened to you Sunday evening. It is off limits and you have to respect that.” so I will.” He mocked Blaise slightly, making Draco smile ever so slightly.
By the time they entered said class everyone was excited. They were indeed starting at the basics. Bread. The recipe was slightly different from what Draco usually did. But they were told to use their own recipe’s if they had any. They were also asked to make something to go with the bread. This ranged from eggs to butter to whatever they pleased. There were recipe’s posted for wizards cheese (which took about 40 minutes instead of months to cure).
“I see I might have to string up a deal then.” Blaise snorted.
either way enjoy!
“Well done Potter and Malfoy!” Anderson called. They made it.. first. Potter cheered. Draco couldn’t help let out a cry of joy himself. Panting hard as he accepted the Highfive offered by Potter. “Damn it Potter.. I can’t believe we did that.”
The common room had turned out to be fairly alright. As long as Draco avoided talking to anyone but Blaise and Pansy. Daphne seemed to, just as Blaise get along with most of the others. They had never picked a side and people seemed to be more forgiving towards them.
Draco snorted in return, giving him a mock glare. “Shut up Potter. I’m matching Blaise. Shouldn’t you be off to find your date?”
His eyes widened and his jaw dropped nearly. Standing up as he looked at Hermoine. Harry nudged Draco, leaning in and whispering into his ear. “I think he likes it.”
“I’m not going anywhere. Like I want to face the world like this. I feel safer here.” Harry huffed, leaving his and on the others lower back. It was strangely comforting. He nodded carefully.
Harry followed him. Still laughing at him.
“I think I should take you back Malfoy. You’ve had way too much.”
The next morning they did just that. they got up together, Harry let Draco take his time getting up and by 7:30 they were outside. Snacking on some breads Harry had gotten from the kitchen.
Once on the field. He found their new rather intimidating challenge. The parkour had been changed up. It was now hidden in dark mist.
“Fine.” Draco snickered back. Putting his hands in Harry’s held up ones, lacing their fingers.
“Me neither.” Potter smirked at him.
Excited conversation sparking amongst the group. Draco found his company with Blaise, knowing full well he’d loose the guy as soon as he found something. Not that Draco blamed him. He did however feel his heart sink a little when Blaise left him the second they entered the three broomsticks.
He felt the others magic lap at his. He let it connect. Nothing happened for a moment before his own hands started warming. He felt it. A scream building up, ready to explode. A burst of laughter threatening to leave his throat. A blue flame appeared. It was almost unbearably hot. He looked at Harry with wide eyes, finding him grinning. “Anderson warned me that might happen.. our core’s are the same. Together we create hellfire.”
“I suppose. But cheaper. Here.” Harry held it out to him. Getting himself another one from his bag. Thankful he had bought a 20 pack before leaving to Hogwarts. Draco took it hesitantly, bringing it to his notebook and scribbling something on the side.
“Granger.”
“Evening Lovegood.” He nodded to her. Turning to walk away, but she grabbed his arm. “Sit with us. The nargles will get you if you walk alone.” At least she never lost her weird talk.
He woke up to Harry cussing, struggling in his sleep.
Hogsmeade trip
After an afternoon of shopping and fun they finally turned back, the three of them all satisfied and carrying bags of new outfits and other stuff.
I'm just taking it as I go. Me rewritting every chapter 8 times before im satisfied seems to be a theme. and every time i just upload it out of frustration. I hope no one minds.
Potter seemed to have no shame. Popping on some shorts, above the knee, how sinful. “Ready Potter?” he asked tying his own hair back into a tiny palm tree bun. His hair had been getting a bit long, just passing his chin, but he couldn’t be bothered to cut it.
Justin Finch-Fletchly and Stephen Cornfoot. A Hufflepuff and a Ravenclaw. Justin looked rather tired, a rather horrid look on his face as his roommate grinned at him. The prankster Hufflepuff must’ve been put in his place for once…
“We’ll take it easy. Let’s just go as far as we can.” Potter smiled at him reassuring. Almost making Draco flush a little. It was nice to have someone act normal towards him.
“are you offering any help? I honestly don’t know what to pick for the Samhain ball.. let alone for the yule one.” Hermoine sighed, following his food picks.
Step four:
They got up fine until a swarm of shadowy ravens swooped at them. A protego prevented the birds from clashing into them.
“But of course. Anything for my cousin.” It sounded more like a question.
“You always are. I was asking if you wanted to grab something from the kitchen and get to the charms paper due Tuesday.” Blaise snorted. There was a comment he was wanting to make about what Draco was distracted by.. but even he knew it was best to avoid poking a sleeping dragon.
“Ah.. I…” Potter flushed. “Don’t have one because I forgot and you know it’ll work out we’ll just walk together unless you do have a date with Pansy or something in which case just forget I said anything.” He rambled really quickly, clearly embarrassed.
“Good job Boys. As promised you’re dismissed, the others will have a run down of each part of the parkours.. Malfoy, you should eat something. It’s good you made it through but you look like you’re gonna pass out on me. Potter please see him to Pomphrey’s for a little energy boost… and get that scratch checked out.” Leigh hummed before Making  her way over to the Parvati twins who had also finished.
He opened the window slightly, using the convenient stuck out bricks to get down. He was drunk, but his body knew what to do.
They walked to their dorm in a rather comfortable silence. No one else was back yet and Potter decided he could use Weasleys shower.
“Oh I am. But house unity remember. I wouldn’t want to take an opportunity away from you. but I am willing to compromise. I’ll go with you.” Hermoine hummed, refilling her tea.
“Me neither to be honest.” Draco said, stretching out a little. Reluctantly taking a bite of the food. “But it’s been alright. What’s your progress with Longbottom so far?”
He heard muttering around him… and then the loud slamming of a door. He dared a look to his side. His father was under a silencing charm but the man was screaming at him in panic. His wild eyes making Draco flinch yet again.
“That’s what I’d say. Tell me. Who was it.” Pansy said. This woman was evil. Devils spawn.
“Yes master Draco?”
“Sure potter. Let’s do that.”
another chapter and a lot sooner than expected. This one is bit more of a filler and some bonding for the boys in general.
15 minutes later their station was clean and they were sat on top of their counter with a mug of hot tea. Watching the other teams. There was something oddly domestic about the two of them. cooking together and drinking tea while waiting for the food to finish. It yet again amazed Draco how well they actually worked together. Feelings of doubt yet again filling his brain. If he hadn’t been such a prick.. he could’ve helped Harry instead of bully him all his life. He really didn’t deserve this.. but he was thankful. He knew he shouldn’t be allowed to think this way but.. seeing the other smile and have fun with him now, he wanted to enjoy that while he could. He wanted to salvage every moment he got to enjoy. Because he did in fact enjoy them. a lot.
By the time he came too he had been released from the spell. Everything felt hurt. Everything felt broken. His arm was swollen badly, but Blaise could heal that right? He’d just have to make his way to him..
Draco stared him. “It’s alright. I’ll get through this.” His smile slowly faded again. “Don’t worry… I don’t want to be a burden any more than I’ve already been… what have I missed in class?” he changed the subject rapidly to which Pansy, Blaise and Hermoine began filling him in on everything, including notes and homework.
They hopped the first 5 fences easy. Potter seemed to calculate the jumps up ahead, Draco just had to follow his lead.
“Ah come on Moine, let the lad have some fun. Come with us if you feel like babysitting.” Seamus huffed
“You remember Buckbeak right?”
“Finally I would like to ask those who are in the 8th year class to stay behind after the dinner… now let us eat!”
“Alright.. though you might need to bribe me a little more..”
By the time he had showered and gotten into his sleepwear potter seemed to have gotten the same idea, the curtains closed and what seemed to be a strong shielding charm. As if Draco would dare to hex him.
“So how are we doing Boy’s?” she asked, leaning on the baking island opposite of them.
“Come on. Lets get that bottle I’m thirsty.”
“The.. the what? Malfoy you think that’s what I’m worried about? You looked on the verge of death yesterday..” Harry walked closer. “Don’t go wandering alone again aight mate? I’ll find who’s done this..”
“This year will be hell wont it?” Pansy said, sitting down next to him, softly stroking his hair out of his eyes. “We’ll need all the friends we can get.. I suggest we at least make up.”
Harry greeted him groggily. “You happen to have Hangover potion.” He muttered, wiping his mouth, he looked horrible.
“Hardly.” He looked at her as she walked into the screened off corner he was in.
“Here, try this one. Might be a bit big on you.” he hummed, handing it to Draco who was attempting to climb out of his button up instead of undoing the two buttons he had fastened.
He opened the door. Only to stare into the face of no one other than the savior himself. he froze, averting his eyes. “I’m sorry… there must have been a mistake.” He uttered, turning back to get out of the room. Only to find it blocked off… those bastards…
“Watching counts as a win.”
“Don’t even bring that up!” Ron growled, bawling his fists.
“I’m in Ron. Let’s ask the other 8 years too. it would be good!” Dean hummed, looking around the table.
“That’s not what I meant and you know that.” he tried to will down the blood rushing to his cheeks. “I.. I owe you remember.” He muttered.
“You have to rise the bread twice.. for a whole hour?” he asked looking a little confused over the list.
As promised that Friday he and Blaise spend about two hours getting Hermoine ready, from getting her into her dress, to Draco applying some make up instead of Blaise who was doing her hair up instead. Draco he wasn’t perfect at Make-up but he’d learnt from spending too much time with the likes of Pansy and he knew how to use color. Blaise put her hair up in a gorgeous hairstyle. They finished the black dress up with a grey mink to drape over her shoulders and some gorgeous earrings Blaise seemed to get out of nowhere. Draco would have to ask about that later.
By the time they returned to their dorms it was quite late. Bellies full of food, laughter and alcohol. Draco went a little earlier than the rest of the 8th years whom had settled on having an afterparty despite it being nearly 1:30 am.
He didn’t know when he drifted off. Probably around the time Harry had started lazily talking about wanting to see magic in other places. The others yawning had only made him sleepier.
“Well you two would make a pair of unusual friends. I remember some very specific rants of yours…”
“Cooking.. oh sure. Sounds like fun.”
“So this one is about you right.. Dancing queen. What we do is.. two steps forward. Lean in. shake your shoulders. Two steps back, tilt back and shake em shoulders.” Was all he caught as the song began playing. He just let Harry lead. Laughing his ass off. They even managed a spin. Though he had to be caught, stumbling on his own feet.
Today was Friday. Their first Pagan class. A whole 2 hours. Knowing he’d probably have to sit with his roommate. So without asking he plopped his bag next to Draco.
320 ml of warm water
Harry took the liberty to sit on his bed across from him, clinging to his own drink, he had put a notebook next to himself and boy did Draco hope he was just going over some extra notes or a schedule..
“i.. yeah… fuck.. thank you Draco.” Harry muttered, slowly blinking a few times. “Can I.. Can you get me some more water?” he asked, Draco nodded, moving away to get up and to the bathroom. “don’t leave.” It sounded so fragile, it nearly cracked him. He forced a soft smile back on his face instead of the worried frown I had formed the moment he turned away.
They’d concluded their horse hangout and sporting with a fight over the shower and getting ready for class. The rest of the day being rather uneventful.
For all the girls it was the same. Pansy seemed to find her courage last. Right after Daphne. “I see.. You will meet an unlikely friend ms. Parkinson. Do not be afraid, you won’t have to watch your back as much as you think you should.”
“Poor you Blaise. You should’ve stuck with me.”
He ate the bread. It felt heavy in his stomach. He wasn’t used to eating both lunch and a somewhat of a dinner.
“What notice? I haven’t really looked at the board since you usually do.” He snorted.
“Yet I am. Here’s the plan. You go first on stuff like the hops and climbing wall so I can help you up. we try to match pace as we run. Do this with me and you get to be a pissbaby after. Don’t ruin it.”
I spend like an hour researching waltz and theres this one on yt called waltz nr2 wedding dance out youtube and its honestly what i picture harry and Draco dancing too
He closed his eyes, holding onto he pole… the made it. His shoes were only a little wet. “thank fuck..”
“Wanna check on the bread?” Harry asked impatiently. Tapping his empty mug with his fingers.
Dean Thomas   /	   	Seamus Finnigan	G+G
Draco and Harry’s bread was getting along nicely. It was puffing on well. They experimented by adding more seeds making it quite a rich bread.
“You cannot possibly ask me to gloss this over. I wish to ensure the safety of my students. All of them.”
Draco snorted. “I’ll leave you two to talk on how you’re getting Hermoine to the ball without Weasley spotting her.” He hummed. Snagging his suit and hurrying to the shower before Harry could snag it. He came out 40 minutes later, wearing a deep red suit with a black button up under it and rather tight pants. A dark brown cloak to his knees to match and a chestnut colored mink on his shoulders. He knew the red implicated something else but.. he and Blaise were matching and Red was a color that looked good on them. really good. He popped on a little make up, just to hide the bags under his eyes, a little red under his eyelids, blush to make his cheeks look less pale and a little mascara to darken his lashes, surely no one could blame him for that.
Put it all in a bowl, mix the dry ingredients first before adding the water. Mix by hand or by wand.
“No need to thank me. I’ll take my reward in the form of taking a shower first.”
His eyes met with Potters next. Who gave him a short nod. Draco opened his mouth but the “I owe you my life” never left his lips. Potter seemed to understand and shook his head. Mouthing what seemed to be a “You deserve it.” He seemed to want to say more. But Draco and Narcissa were escorted out of the court. Brought to Malfoy manor.. a horrific and dreadful place.
“The Weasley. He’s got troubles doesn’t he?”
“A gift? Master shouldn’t have.” She said. Her eyes open and wide.
“Just trust me.. I’m going to speed her up now yeah? Three.. two.. one.. Come on Amour.” He clicked his tongue and Amour sped up into a simple trot.
“If it happens again I’m having someone look into it. It could have been a onetime incident.” Good she didn’t know about the other one.
“I thought you hated that “Bloody awful horse of mine”.” Harry teased.
“Oh come on Ron. Leave it.” Potter’s voice came from the door. He looked at them rather sad. “He’s trying to help you. you have to calm down a little. I know you’re upset about the rooming situation. But fighting constantly isn’t going to make it better.” He put a hand on Weasley’s shoulder. Who suddenly looked really tired. “Lets get you cleaned up. 	Oliver.. you can use our shower aight?  Don’t take it to heart.” Rivers shrugged.
If you want to leave any thoughts feel free to leave a comment! I'll be sure to read it.
“Nightmare?”
Blaise had left his side to talk to Weasley about something and Draco found himself in a discussion about Defense and how they should be doing more advanced stuff really.
Apparently “the others pick your drinks” meant “We decide awful combinations and Harry Pays for them”
“Potter don’t overstep yourself here. I bloody hate anything that isn’t human.” Draco chuckled softly. “Let’s get up early though, will you set an alarm for 7am? I don’t want to make whatever this was my new sleeping schedule.”
Draco did as told, a shiver running through him as he did so. The horse seemed rather unfazed. Moving to nuzzle Draco who yelped loudly. His face flushing in embarrassment.
“9. We could make it to breakfast if it’s a good brew.”
Harry chuckled in reply. Leading Draco out to the lake. “so I was thinking about doing 6km interval today. We run 2km, sprint about 300m. rinse and repeat. At the 3km mark we take a 10 min break for some stretching exercises and then continue on. Questions?” Potter hummed. Looking determined. Draco was starting to regret agreeing to this. Well starting. He already regretted it.
“As for Draco Lucius Malfoy…. You will be send back to Hogwarts to retake your NEWTS for the 8th year. If you do come back with at least 3 O’s you will only have 2 years of probation. His wand shall be returned two weeks before his departure to Hogwarts and he will be supervised by Minerva McGonagall as per her suggestion.” There was the slam of a hammer. There was some muttering around the hall.
“Draco”
“Try pressing the button on top will you Malfoy.” He held up his own pen, clicking it. Watching Draco turn red when he realized he had been writing with a closed pen.
“those hooded shirts right? They look comfy, can I sleep in one?” rather a bold question, but it made Harry smile.
“No buts. It’s fine. We get along now and that’s what matters.” Harry whispered, pulling back and rubbing his thumb over the others cheeks, wiping away the tears. “let’s get to the castle and then we’ll talk alright?”
1 vanilla pod
“Oh yeah.. sorry. I was wondering if you er… needed help.”
“You can cook?” Harry asked with a raised brow.
His thought travelled back to the past few weeks. Pansy, Granger, Longbottom and Blaise were getting along great. They each had a strong suit in a certain class and they build each other up in each subject.
He was pulled in by his right arm, right into Harry’s chest. When had the git grown a head taller than him?! He grumbled lightly. That was until, Potter forced him to move his hips. He couldn’t help but burst out in laughter. What the fuck was he doing.
(aren’t I self-indulgent with my redeeming Malfoy. I just need some happy vibes man.)
“It’s alright.” He felt the others hands on his own, squeezing gently. “how about I try to channel it with you? So you can feel what its like?” he sounded gentle. Still with the same low and concentrated voice from earlier.
“Well then.. that’s..” He muttered to himself. making his way to the bar. Awkwardly sitting himself down. “Firewhiskey. Big glass. Don’t bother with shots.” He muttered to the bartender halfheartedly. Paying as he got his glass, of which he threw back half immediately. Swallowing the burning liquor.
He combined the black jeans with a white button up, done up all the way up till pansy had undone all but two in the middle which made him grateful for the overcoat he’d picked. This woman was insane. It was nearly winter for merlins sake.
“Deal Potter.” He sipped his chocolate. “Why are you so focused on winning?” he blurted out. Trying to hide the fact that whatever Potter did to the hot chocolate.. had made it taste like heaven. 10/10 rating, better that Pips even.
That good feeling turned out to be right, she was stunning in the dress. All she needed was a red lipstick and some good make up. Which Blaise offered up to do. Draco offered to look though his closet for a gray mink to drape over her shoulders.
“You were too busy dancing with Potterboy. Even I have never been able to get you to do anything other than waltz. I may have to ask him what he fed you”
“I do expect you to take notes. But not today. Today is focused on finding your core.” He took a deep breath. “Every wizard and witch has a core. A core energy their magic comes from. Let’s find yours out today shall we.”
“I do stand with Malfoy here Harry. You are very dramatic when you hit the dancefloor.” Ron snickered, stealing the bottle from him.
“There you are. Merlin what the fuck happened.. Harry passed out the moment we got back to the dorms after dinner.” Neville started.
“Oh geez buddy.. you’re back? I’m glad to see you’re alright!” Harry whispered loudly. He was reeking of alcohol and clearly worse off than Draco had been.
She carefully placed the bow on her left ear. He fixed it when it was a little crooked. “There you go. It should change color when you put on a different dress. It’ll always match. I wish I could’ve given you something better. But I know you wouldn’t have accepted it.” Pip nodded. She had tears in her eyes. “Thank you master Draco.”
“Will do.” Potter hummed back. Taking his leave. And joining Weasley and Granger with his own mug of chocolate. Perhaps potter was into cooking too. he’d have to ask his recipe as a favor next time.
There was a loud banging in the door. “Draco are you fucking done?? I still need to change and we have like an hour!” harry called, barging in.
He was fast asleep, tail in his mouth, white and grey fur stained with blood from the cuts, his right leg horribly swollen and head resting in Harry’s chest. “That’s not a tiger potter. That’s a snow leopard.. I have no bloody idea how one of those could get into the school or even in the country. It must be a creature as you said. Perhaps you should visit the oaf… I mean Hagrid about it?” he suggested. “I’ll put some tracking spells out. We can look tomorrow? I don’t think I’ll be fit to run but we can go for a walk. Visit the horse and try and see where its hiding out.”
“You want to visit Sarah?”
“We’re not naming her Sarah.”
“I’m glad to hear that Potter.. I’ll give you a hint.. to win him over a bit quicker. He has a horrible sweet tooth. Hot chocolate.. chocolate frogs… cake.. anything of the sort is the best bribe to get Malfoy to even listen to you. help him and you’ll help the others too. I’ll do my part. You do yours.” He handed Harry a bag. “You were planning a run Wednesday right? Talk to him on Tuesday… and don’t bring up what happened. Its off limits. He’ll talk when he’s ready. Now off you go before Longbottom thinks I’ve killed you.”
“You know what.. let’s just do that.” Draco replied tiredly. Sitting up with a little groan and stretching out his arms above his head. only now noticing the hand on his leg. His eyes darted to it and Harry quickly pulled it off.
He didn’t make out most of it. His world was turning to black again. They had gotten him good huh? Oh well.. they had nearly a month to make up for right? He felt his lips curl up and arms wrap around him right after his knees had hit the floor.. time to go again.
“Drink it quick. We’re going to the next pub soon. I hope you can dance. I made a bet with Ron. I get you to dance. He gets me  bottle of Ogdens finest. Work with me and half of it is yours.” Harry whispered.
“Yeah.” Draco replied. Grabbing it from the little cubby in his nightstand. “What time is it?” he asked, handing one over. Did they do talking in the morning now? Apparently.
Fantastic.
He had taken the form of a snow leopard. A rather small member of the big cat family, but powerful enough to take down big prey. Far away enough from lions to satisfy his father.
He felt a kick to the back of his knee, making him drop down. He caught himself on the floor with his hands.
“You’re nice. Did you know that? You’re so nice to me. Always. After everything I’ve done to you you’re so bloody nice…” he mumbled, pulling the coat closer around himself. oh no.. here came emotional overly clingy Draco. He knew that once this started it was hard to get out of.
“Fineeee.” Harry huffed, getting up, holding out a hand to Draco who’s entire body complained already. The other took it gratefully, dusting some sand off of himself, picking up Harry’s hoody and handing it to him.
“Hmm I can’t believe my eyes, you two hanging out and not nearly murdering one another.” Blaise said. Now adding some more veggies to the plate.
“Sod off.”
“Your breathing is too loud potter. I can hear you from over here.” He complained. He always had to complain.
“I’m sure he’d be happy too.” Hermoine smiled at him. “Do I invite pansy along?”
“I’m not sure..” He whispered, mood souring a little. Of course he’d love to go. But he was afraid of an attack.
“We most definitely have to try to avoid them. we cannot be blamed for their mess-ups.” He nodded in agreement.
He let his thoughts run in silence as they went up to their dorm.
He looked around. “Make friends.” That’s what Pansy told him when she had also refused to go. “You’ll lose Blaise. So make friends with the others. You’ll be fine.” He took another sip. Liquid courage right? Making his way over to Neville. Who seemed the most approachable of the bunch. He was talking to Lovegood.. which made him hesitate.
I absolutely love working on this story and it is officially the furthest I've ever gotten with anything but I do realise its bit of a mess with lots of time skips. a lot of what is being written in this story is me trying to figure out how to write certain things. Like Drunk Draco, or dealing with Ptsd as an outsider, falling in love slowly, coming to terms with yourself, knowing you're in love with someone but not being sure if its ok to be. this is mostly a writing practice.
“Mom won’t mind.. the others might need some time too but I’ll warm em up for ya alright?”
“Wasn’t my intention if that’s what you’re wondering. I just tripped over my own feet. The workout must have made me tired. I passed out in an abandoned corridor and Blaise found me.”
He got into bed. This year was going to be miserable. Death was starting to sound a lot better the longer he was here.
“Like they’d leave us a choice.” Draco grinned.
“Who did Pans?” Blaise asked, very carefully, putting a piece of buttered-and-jammed-toast on her plate.
“Ooh yess… its perfect weather for tea.”
“You are a free elf anyway Pip. Go on. Put it on. It’ll look nice with your dress.” He smiled, pointing to the self-made dress she was wearing. It wasn’t particularly well made. But she was proud of it.
“Shut up, don’t listen to him, he knows nothing.” Draco purred, he needed some hugs and Amour was an excellent provider.
“Your face betrays you Malfoy. You look like you’re considering going to Azkaban and skipping this.”
She scoffed. “Do not lie to me boy. Come in. your friends are worried sick.” She pulled him in, or at least tried too. she took his right arm and he yelled out. She paled. “Did they break your arm? Mr Malfoy who did this.”
“no. just a bad dream.”
They hadn’t spoken since.. since she had left the basement at the manor, he froze for a moment, looking down at her. She looked better. No longer frail, still looking just past you as she had always done. Tonight was different, her eyes met his. “Draco?  Care to have a dance with me?” she asked, there was no ice in her tone. There never was. Her voice was childish as ever. Childish and kind, she never lost her spirit. Even with the horrific things they had done….
Dinner was good. But he felt absolutely battered right after. Excusing himself from desert and making his way back to the dorms. He nearly stumbled over his own feat. He couldn’t have caught it in time.. the hex thrown at his back.
“Yes team captain Potter.” He rolled his eyes. But Potter chuckled it off.
As soon as they were in sight of the stables Amour called to them immediately. Popping her head out of her stable. The weather was getting colder and during the night they were being locked away now.
It was a herd of Fjords. Larger than your average fjord horse. They probably were mixed with some other creature.
It was honestly the best he’d made. The crust was nice and hard, but the middle was perfectly fluffy, the seeds added some extra texture the jam was a bit sweet and sour, the butter could’ve used a bit more salt but it was honestly the best he’d made so far.
now enjoy my darlings.
“Sit down mate. Its fine.” He smiled, scooting aside for Draco to join.
Girls:
“I’m getting flashbacks to the last creature I was forced to make friends with and I do not approve.” Draco muttered. Not looking away from the horse that had already approached them.
“I don’t. Not from you. I’ve been a git to you.”
The drink tasted like a regular “Soda” that Hermoine had taken to introducing him to. He liked the think called coca cola, though he did wonder where said coca in this drink was.. it didn’t taste very chocolaty…
the cooking bit was inspired by a harringrove fic I'm currently reading called Lamp-bright rind by nagdabbit which has a lot of cooking in it and I'm honestly dead for the recipies in it. check it out if you're in for some lighthearted romance.
“Pip. She..” be honest Draco. He wants you to trust him. It’ll make him happy. He wanted to make harry happy. “Pip taught me over the summer. Mostly how to make bread an some simple dishes though.” He said earnestly, starting to put away his toiletries. He felt a little embarrassed.
He stood in front of his bed. Groaning loudly when he realised he’d have to get out of these clothes.
“Malfoy? Oh uh..” he sounded confused, letting him go. Draco immediately got up, refusing to turn around, trying to will the heat in his cheeks to go down. He took  deep breath before finally turning around. “I.. I’m going to shower. you feeling better?” he asked
That being sad, he was far better looking than ever before. He’d grown out of his lanky stage a while ago. He was starting to fill out. The tan he’d gotten over summer had stayed, it rather suited him. It did help that Draco had gotten the privilege of getting to know the other better. One might say he was really starting to care for Harry Potter. Not that he could admit that.
“I would. But its your idea Pansy. I wouldn’t want to strike with your honor.” she said slyly.

“Leave? Ah I was talking with Ron about some stuff.. why?”
Dinner was absolutely gorgeous despite some of the treats being rather child themed. The 8th year class indulged in having some good wines with their food.
“Fair enough. We’ll follow your plan chosen one.” He grumbled. He had to add an insult. He couldn’t outright admit that Potter had him figured out AND made a half decent plan.
“Seems like you lot were right.. What happened to you mr Malfoy?” she asked a bit harsher than probably meant. He flinched at his own name.
He let his hand slump. That was true. No one was going to believe him.
“I’m Sorry.”
Unfortunately Olivander didn’t feel like giving up. taking his arm with a gentle smile. “Lets go and try something else then. I am clearly a bit rusty. Go stand over there my boy.” The man had given him several other names to avoid calling him Malfoy. He was fine with it, standing in the middle of the store. “Now I will ask the wands to come towards you. There has to be one to pick you. If not it’ll be material. Now close your eyes. Hands out.”
“Too late. Lets go see her.” Harry was already standing over him, holding out a hand which Draco reluctantly took to be pulled up. letting himself get dragged back to the field of horses. This time the patting part went better, mostly because Amour seemed to be a rather calm horse.
“How did you even manage to wake up so early.”
Harry nodded, a flush spread over his cheeks. “Ill see you at breakfast then?”
“We’ll start easy. Wands on the table. All of you.” he hummed. Watching his students do so.
“Most definitely. Lets see if your gittish cooking has paid off.” He teased, grabbing their spreads.
Draco was silent for a moment. He didn’t have a date.. and he would rather not mind having someone to walk with. Who would want to go on a date with a deatheater. He had planned on stealing a dance with Pansy halfway through because he did really like dances.
It took him a few hits and several “I’m gonna quit I hate it.” Before he got the hang off of it.
Soon enough they put on the saddle, bridle and tightened the girth. Harry handed Draco a helmet but he refused to put it on. “You promised me I won’t fall and I trust you on that. I’m not ruining my hair.” To which he’d been called a git.
“Fucking hell Darling.. why? I know you’re powerful enough to kick them off.”
Proudly they waited for her to walk into Draco’s dorm to look over the final result. They really did out achieve themselves.  She was absolutely looking like the pretty and strong woman she was. She flushed as they complimented her.
“It’s no longer offering. We’re going shopping.” Draco smirked. He had been forced to take styling lessons as a child and to be honest it was one of the few classes he was thankful for. Very useful. “We might need Blaise, he’s an expert too. We’ll make you shine on Samhain and absolutely blinding on Yule. Weasley would be an idiot not to drop at your feet with a ring.” Draco smirked, flopping back down in his previous spot.
It had been a long, rough process. The keeping a leaf in ones mouth for a month had been horrible combined with the fear of failing.
“Morning to you too sunshine.” Harry chuckled. “rough night? You’re usually slightly less of a git when you just wake up.”
For now though, he stood up, pushing Harry down onto his back. His purrs low and deep as he lay down next to him and propped his chin on the others chest, blinking at him the way all cats do when the respect and care for someone. His tail carefully placed over the others legs. He couldn’t speak.. but he tried to project it the best he could.. you’re loved… you’re cared for. Trust me. I’d know.
(See the end of the chapter for
I finally have some plot points to aim for and I'm starting to build into those.
He held up his hands. “Come on.. this can’t be worth getting expelled over.”
“Harry wake up we need to get ready for class.” He hissed, struggling against the others grasp.
“So. Have you picked out a dress yet Hermoine?” he asked casually. “You’ve got someone to impress further. I remember Weasley’s jaw dropping in fourth year. We have to surpass that.” Draco hummed, putting some of the rather nice looking salmon and steamed veggies on his plate.
“Harry? Wake up please.. you’ve had a nightmare.” He whispered softly. Watching the other stir awake. He still looked like shit. But at least he was actually awake. He gasped slightly, grabbing at his throat.
“Did you forget your ink?” the git asked.
“Ah well. Anderson asked me to help you with finding your core. He said your paper was incredible he asked me to perhaps help you find your core.” He put a hand in his hair, combing it out. “Because you know.. I found mine already and were roommates and it would be helpful to know yours too.”
So he dragged him along. He hadn’t drunk too much tonight. Barely any really, too concerned for his roommate who seemed to be always at risk for an attack. He hadn’t lied when he’d told Draco about talking to Ron.. he was more so watching out for him though.
He picked out 3 books that seemed to mention the subject at least. Checking them out and making his way back to the dorm. At least he was making his way there until he was pulled into one of the by now abandoned classrooms. Not again.. not today..
“I’m finished with the horses. Can we go.” Draco huffed, hiding his face behind one of his hands. Harry snorted, spelling a halter and putting it on their horse. “So ours is Red. Keep that in mind when we go visit her.”
“You can ask for my help you know.”
They walked into the great hall like that. t was decorated as per usual, the tables were already pushed to the sides however and instead of the benches there were chairs. Harry led them up to where the others were sitting, even pulling out a chair for him. Draco snorted. “Such a gentleman Harry. I’m truly impressed.” He chuckled lightly. Ignoring the glae he was getting from Weasley. Said glare quickly disappearing as Hermoine appeared in the door. The invisibility cloak shoved in the small purse she’d brought
Draco snickered, drinking the last of the beer before getting up. “Next pub it is.” He hummed, feeling quite tipsy. As they walked to the next pub, Draco found himself walking next to Harry. He turned to him. “Potter. You do know I don’t know how to erm.. you know.. dance? I mean I can waltz properly. Of course. But that also is kind of it.” He muttered, feeling his cheeks flush a little. Thank god for the darkness of the night right?
The girls rooms weren’t set up much better..
“Of course not.” He replied, looking away from the others in the room and taking a small bite. It was still warm thankfully. “It’s fine. I’m fine now.” He ignored the sigh leaving Hermoine.
Thursday had been alright. He’d actually done his homework with some help from Hermoine.
He was rather surprised to find 10 poles standing in the field together with Professor Leigh“Welcome everyone!” she called. She was wearing.. a rather traditional looking outfit. “I want the lot of you to pair up with your roommate and line up over there.” She pointed to a row of wooden poles. “10 seconds or else were doing pushups. 10…9…” her tone was happy and cheerful but something told Draco he didn’t want to mess with her.
“Yeah, m fine.” Draco muttered, rubbing his blurry eyes.
A few hours later. After breakfast they were all gathered on the field. Today they were starting at 10am. Dreadful time for a Sunday.
She scoffed. Draco just stayed silent. Watching them and their bickering as they rode to the castle.
“Did you finally get laid.”
About 15 minutes and several more attacks later. They were through. Panting and slightly panicked. The panic soon turned into laughter however. They made it through. They hadn’t cast anything horrible and.. made their best time yet!
Harry didn’t seem to mind, wrapping his arms around the cat and nuzzling his face into the fur. Draco purred deeply. “I’m glad you’re here.. I was feeling a little lonely again.” Harry muttered, nearly breaking the others heart by how sad and raw he sounded. “Ron and Hermoine are so happy together. I feel like such an intruder to what they have. Hell most people around me have someone to fall back on. I’m not saying I’m mad at them for getting together.. but it used to be the three of us… now it’s the two of them and me, Fuck.. I feel so alone.” He felt the other shaking, the fur of his neck was getting wet.. oh no.. Potter was having a drunken sob.
It had been hard at first. Admitting he was bisexual. He didn’t even know it was a thing until Hermoine had told him and that it was ok to have a thing for guys. Later she had admitted seeing what had been happening between him and Draco and he had ended up crying softly onto her shoulder. He’d just been trying to be friendly with the guy. He knew Draco wasn’t gay.. and even if he was… It could never work right? the world would judge them for being Gay and who they were, they would judge Draco even more and say he was manipulating Harry. Destroy him with words and from all the talks they had had… He didn’t want that for him. all he wanted was for Draco to be happy, with or without him. he would have to settle for just friends as hard as that was starting to seem.
I've been a bit sidetracked from writing.. Mostly because I've been reading a lot, working out my plot for this fic and working on the plot for a personal project that I hope to publish one day.
“I never thought I’d see the day a Malfoy would dance like that. You got him good harry.” Ron snickered. “a truly magnificent sight to see. Worth the money.” He signed a bartender over to get him a bottle of whiskey. Paying for it before handing it over.
You see it was a family secret. All Malfoy’s had to become animagus. They had a talent for it and if he hadn’t been his father’s son he would have probably failed and left to die alone and an abomination in the woods.
“Of ya go Potter.” Harry chuckled. Most of their interactions were like this nowadays. They were friendly. They would still spit insults but.. there was no heat behind them.
Please also note all these chapters are unedited and usually posted as soon as ive finished them. If you notice a mistake feel free to contact me!!
“You think you’ve got a better name then?”
Draco tried his best to look offended but failed miserably, smiling at her.
“Did I not tell you just a while ago to not do that without a warning?” he spat.
Draco stared at him blankly. “fell down a flight of stairs. I lost my balance.” Longbottom seemed taken aback. “Don’t bother asking... Potter.. a word?” he looked at Potter, who hadn’t said anything so far but looked like he was about to give him a rant.
“I wasn’t guarding him. You would like to be left alone too!” Potter said a bit too loud.
“So you di. Who?”
He got into his robes fairly quick. Finding his tie was now bronze and an icy blue with a faint silver line in between the colors. Fantastic. Not even a Slytherin anymore.
“b-but master Draco..”
“I like to pretend I do. You should’ve noticed.” He laughed lazily, fumbling with the buttons of his shirt. He barely registered Potter standing in front of him, slapping his hands away.
He put his wand away, focussing. He could do this. It had been years but he was certain he could pull it off.
“You alright there bud?” Harry asked suddenly, looking at him with a raised eyebrow. Draco blinked at him. Only now realizing that.. what he was doing must have looked like he was checking the other out. He wasn’t of course. He was a Malfoy. He wasn’t gay… Potter just had some nice features he could admire and appreciate.
He felt grateful, having talked to her. He felt a little better after his whole moral debacle on whether it was alright for him to be around Harry as much as he was…
“Potter I’m not going to sit loose.”
He got his potion from a reluctant Pomphrey, Potter got his cut healed and the two of them were scolded out of the hospital wing for dragging a mess in.
“So, as you might’ve noticed I am not from here. I may not be as educated on what you have been through. But I do know how to deal with warriors. And the bunch of ye clearly are. Lets try and make this year the best we can yeah? You will all share a common room. Let’s go up there. I’ll explain how the rooming system will work this year. McGonagall asked me for a very specific reason.” The man sounded a lot more friendly than he looked..
“No thank you Pip.”
Tuesday he’d done as told.
Harry nodded. Understanding so far.
He stepped out, finding Blaise and Pansy in the Common room. “Ready?” he asked, giving them a small smile. Walking to class should be alright.. right?
“Today were gonna start on a little parkour. You are to hold these..” she held up a small pole “… at al times. One hand loose and you’re starting over. First to finish is dismissed earlier. A boys team and girls team, since talents will diverge.”
By the time the song ended they were panting lightly, most of the other 8th years had left when the other years had begun to join. Not that the two of them had noticed, they were seemingly lost in a silent conversation of sorts. Neither of them quite understood, but it seemed important, even after the dance that had lasted near 10 minutes, there were still things that needed to be said. Instead of saying them however, Draco smiled lightly. “I’ll.. want to get something to drink?” he asked to which Harry simply answered with a “I think that’s a good idea..” silently following him to the punch table and pouring them both a glass of what was marked 8th years punch.
“Harry? How did you get this number?”
He kneeled and looked under the tablecloth, not there. Confused, he looked at his mother who, smiling, pointed her skirt.
He opened his eyes to found a snidget-like bird in front of him, flapping its wings and moving around his head gracefully. Draco found himself amazed at how much his mind went back to Potter for protection over and over again. He trusted the savior far too much, more than he had ever imagined he would trust someone. He was not a trusting person. He had faced enough betrayal and deceive in his life to go around putting his secrets or, in this case, his life in anyone’s hands. He had made his way on his own, he had the same few friends he had always had, he hadn’t been in a relationship for years, just because he was not brave enough to trust, he was to scared, to self-preservative. And there he was, ten years after the last time he had seen Harry, since a war were they had different sides and opposite roles and he was naturally using his presence to calm down, his memories to dare; he was being vulnerable, defenseless, because he knew Potter would be there.
“Why am I here? Where is my family? They…” he was shaking again. Harry had no idea what was happening to him. He was obviously scared, but had he hurt Draco’s body? Could he feel the pain from the cut in his hand? He didn’t seem to pay any attention to it. Harry tried to get closer, slowly but Alexei’s…Draco’s…. ugh…whatever, his eyes opened and he started moving until he reached the corner of the room.
“Not tempting enough?” Draco had asked with a playful look when Harry stopped his hands on their way to his belt.
“Kreacher” he called softly, not sure if the elf would answer, but seconds later he felt a pop at his right.
“Well, to sum it up, you are now the Boy-Who-Lived-too” Draco grimaced.
Some of the tags were missing, some were unreadable, some orbs were broken or had been covered with some kind of paint and after an hour, Harry had only covered a third of the room. He was starting to believe that Rasputin had been nothing more than an uncontrolled fool that had gotten too high and it had all gone to his head, when his sight got attracted to a small ball covered in dust, labeled in 1908, and which characters matched the ones written by Alexander with both Rasputin’s and Alexei’s name.
Ellias knocked and the door opened. A big, blond woman was behind a desk. Her hair was like Hermione’s and her office as tidied up as his friend’s. She stopped reading and looked at them.
“Ha-ha, very funny Draco” he said back “I don’t think I have anything useful here, but it was worth the shot” he was checking some kind of list “No, nothing” did he actually had registered every book in his studio? Was this the same man that would forget he had his wand in his hand while looking for it?
He hugged her, letting her cry as much as she needed. He tried to comfort her. He told her that Harry was there, that he would help them, that she had him and her sister now, she was not alone. They would get over it.
Dotted lines appeared in every direction, like dust seen through a sunbeam. They went straight to a mirror before moving to the next one and the next one and the one after that, until it disappeared in front of a particular one. Harry may have been confused had he not entered to Koldovstoretz through a damn mirror. He touched the surface tentatively and when it moved, making waves, like a stone breaking the calmed water, he threw himself inside without a second thought.
“What happened?” he asked to the witch while running the diagnostic spells and getting the basic potions from his bag.
He didn’t…
“Are you sure this is a good idea?” he asked his boyfriend.
“What? Our baby? I think we should talk about it with your mother. She probably has some ideas on the matter” Draco’s lips tighten and he felt the anger built.
“No” he was not. He had never ride one, fuck, he had never seen one up close, but that was not the problem, he trusted Harry not to kill them. The problem was definitely somewhere else.
“Could you please not sound so surprised?” Harry chuckled.
Maybe Harry was in there. He pushed a little and got inside the room that had been locked ever since he arrived to Grimmauld Place for the first time. It was full of boxes of different size, all covered in dust. Harry was not there, but, why had he protected that room so heavily? It was just a regular room with a bunch of boxes and, judging by the movement on his peripheral view, rats.
His mind went back to the memory lane. Harry pointing his wand to the sky instead of the dragon in front of him, Harry emerging out of the Black Lake, Harry pointing it at him just before his chest was cut open, Harry’s disfigured face and unmistakable eyes, waiting for Draco to say his name…
“You know you are” he had managed to say “Maybe too much”
“Draco?” he tried in a soothing voice, but it seemed to trigger something similar to panic in the other wizard instead as he started crawling back “Draco, wait, you’ll fall” Harry tried to reach him but the man let out a frightened scream and fell from the bed on his back with a loud thud. He didn’t stop moving, though.
They were having an amazing night and Harry realized how much he had missed them. His work was important to him, but they were what he cared about the most, they were everything he had; so he made a mental note not to skip any other reunion, no matter how busy or tired he was.
“Yes, Harry and I think that it’s possible that the problem has something to do with your soul, or someone else’s”
He was sat in the window frame, one of his legs close to his chest while the other swung in the outside. When Draco entered the room Harry had a half-consumed cigarette in his hand, the smoke dancing in front of him.
“Shush” what?
waiting to date you” Draco had not missed the word he had used. He took a bite of his pancake and suppressed a moan, he had more important business to attend.
How hadn’t he seen it before?
Two more days passed and Draco kept receiving daily visits from Potter to check on him. Until, all of a sudden, on Wednesday morning, the dark-haired wizard apparated in his bedroom.
“Ah, here we are” she said, returning to the sofa and handing him a piece of paper “This is a guy from the unspeakable’s department that we sent to the Russian Ministry to collaborate with an investigation about some dimensional distortions. He is a really nice person. A bit eccentric but I’m sure he’ll help you accommodate. I’ll talk to him as soon as I get home”
Draco was a powerful wizard. Blood purity was crap most of the times, but it did carry a meaning concerning the amount of magic in the core and Harry knew that. Besides, Malfoy had been one of the best students back at Hogwarts and had made his life around a branch of magic that demanded a deep knowledge and management of various magical capacities. How could something attach itself to his soul and body without him noticing? Without being rejected by his core?
He checked the man every twenty minutes. Nothing made sense, his magic core was fine, there was no reason for his wand to fail him. He would propose to analyze Malfoy’s soul, but that was a delicate procedure and it demanded the person to be strong enough to handle it, so it would have to wait until the blond was recovered. Harry was partially relieved, the treatment had passed the test with flying colors, thanks Merlin, and that had saved Draco, probably, from dying.
“Ah, ah. No sweets until you eat, missy” he said and the girl pouted. Her gray eyes looking right into his own, melting everything they touched.
