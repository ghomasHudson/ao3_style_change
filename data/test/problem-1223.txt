“Of course, it’d be difficult to explain the situation to them, especially at a young age." Theo stated, and Draco leaned over to give his two cents.
“No, but I don’t think that he will spill all his secrets, even if it affects you and Harry, darling.” Narcissa stated.
“I don’t know your father is quite observant, Dray.” She stated as they reached the bottom of the stairs, and Harkin looked up to find the entire crowd of people in the main foyer staring at them and froze, deer in headlights style. Draco smiled, and then he removed his hand from hers and wrapped it around her waist, placing the hand he was holding in his other hand as he guided her farther into the room and over to where he saw his parents.
“Yeah, kiddo, num-nums.” Harry walked down the stairs and down the hall to the lower room where the kitchen and dining room were. Harry set Teddy in his highchair, and walked over to the cabinet, and he started riffling through what he had. He pulled out two different bottles and held them out to Teddy. “You want these num-nums or these num-nums, kiddo?”
“Oh, and Miss Potter, your name is officially Harkin Jamelynn Potter, at least until you marry Draco, and your gender is changed in your records as well to make things easier for everything.”
“No, it’s beautiful. You’re beautiful.” Draco said as he kissed her on the lips pulling her closer. Harry pulled away a little, and looked into Draco’s silver eyes.
Draco groaned in pleasure as he slipped her pajama bottoms off along with her panties, and he pushed her legs farther apart. His fingers playing with her clitoris as she gasped and moaned underneath him. “D-Dray…y-your turn.” Harry stuttered as her one hand slipped down his back and tugged at the waistband of his trousers, and Draco understood. He pulled away reluctantly, and stripped down to nothing, and he climbed back on top of her stripping Harry’s pajama top of buttons leaving her shirt open. Draco went back to ravishing her neck but quickly moved to her collarbone as his fingers found their way back to her clitoris. His erection was pushing against her inner thigh, and Harry’s hand managed to find its way between them to grasp it in her small hands.
She slid her hand down his chest and rested it on the inside of his thigh, her thumb just barely brushing against the budge growing there. She smirked as he tried to buck his hips into the touch, and he released a whimpered moan as he wasn’t satisfied. “If you’re awake you should let me know.” Harry whispered into his ear, and then nipped at his earlobe.
“Just because you’re on top doesn’t mean you can’t get fucked,” Harry retorted as he moved his hands south and pushed a finger into Draco’s entrance. Draco groaned as Harry pushed the finger all the way in and stopped.
“It’s alright, cub. Let’s have some tea.” Remus said as he pulled Harkin over to the table, and he moved her into a seat. Harkin sat down, and Remus kissed her on the top of her head before he walked over to make some tea. When he finished making their tea, he walked back over to Harkin and he placed the cup of tea in front of her before he sat down next to her, and he turned slightly towards her. “So do you want to talk about what brought you here?” Remus asked as he brushed his fingers through her hair, and he tucked it behind her ear.
“You. Don’t find her, Ron; Hermione does.” Luna said. “I would have had Harry do it because everyone likes Harry, but given our predicament, Hermione is the best option. Sorry, Ron, but you just don’t have a very likable personality.”
“Yes, well I know a way you can find her. Your magic is bound together now, Draco. Can you not think of a way to find her?”
“I wouldn’t have come this far not to go the rest of the way, please, Dray.” Harry moaned as she slowly stroked Draco’s length, and Draco captured her lips and thrusted inside her without warning. She gasped into his lips before moaning, and her legs wrapped around Draco as he trusted inside her. Gasps and moans escaped her lips as Draco continued and his lips moved from her lips and down her neck to her collarbone to finally stop at her breast. Harry dug her nails into Draco’s shoulder and slowly dragged them down his back erecting a small scream from Draco as he quickened his pace.
“Well, Granger can’t come in here, and I was coming in anyway, so she asked me to check on you while I was in here. You’ve been in here for most of the feast and it’s now over, so she’s freaking out.” Harry sighed as he tried to get up and leaned into the wall as he couldn’t stand up right.
“I’m sorry.” Harkin whispered as she burst into tears and tried to escape the compartment before Severus caught her and pulled her into his chest. Harkin cried into his chest until she fell asleep, and Severus picked her up and placed her on the bench.
“We get rid of the last piece of the Dark Lord and quickly. My guess is this is a result of the Dark Lord still being inside him and torturing him still. Minerva head up to the seventh floor and help with the search and take as many teachers as you can. Potter is still in danger.”
“Well, did you know that Draco does? He’s always been able to absorb information, and I think you might have somehow gained it from this bond. It would explain how you just explained that to me like you were an expert.”
“Better. I had to force a calming draught down Draco’s throat when he got here, but Harkin and the baby are in surprisingly in good health considering the way you found her.” Mel said as Narcissa watch her son’s sleeping condition. He was lying on the bed next to Harkin not touching her except with his left hand over her stomach.
“Yes, she’s right. So Severus made this experimental potion to rid her of the horcrux. He didn’t have much time because he needed to get her away from the Dark Lord, so he made it so the horcrux can be expelled by bonding two people though that wasn’t his intention. He just wanted the two people’s magic to expel the other soul, resulting in a bond entwining Draco’s magical core with Harkin’s magical core. Only there were two problems: the Dark Lord interrupted them in the middle of the potion taking effect, and that is how he lost his magic; then there was the baby. It wasn’t Draco’s, it was Thaddeus Nott’s, when he raped her after taking her hostage.” Narcissa stated, and Sirius stood up so fast his chair banged to the ground.
“I have to tell everyone all of my movements. I went to see Remus. I can go and see my family, can’t I?” Harkin stated as she tilted her head to the side. “I just needed to get out of this enormous manor, I needed to feel normal, and I needed Remus. Is that alright?”
“Ah, I see that you do not understand my position as High Inquisitor, Headmaster. I am to oversee all event at Hogwarts. I hope to stay informed.” Umbridge stepped closer she caught a glimpse of Harry from behind Draco, and she smiled. “But seeing as the student in question is Harry Potter I understand why you would not inform me of his ‘incident.’ This was probably just him inflicting pain on himself to get attention.” Draco chuckled at that, and stepped closer to Harry. “Is something funny Mr. Malfoy?”
“I can. I don’t know everything, but I do know the gist of what is wrong.” Draco stated. “But you might want to sit down properly, Mother.” Draco insisted, and Narcissa gave Draco a look of shock and pulled the chair from the end of the table and pulled it next to Harkin. Narcissa reached out to hold her hand, and Harkin willingly took her hand.
“You are with Potter?” Lucius questioned as he looked back and forth between Harry and Draco. “Son, are you really going to continue with this blasphemy? I can’t believe you are still on about this blasphemy; it’s disgraceful to this family and the generations of this family to come. It is disgraceful, Draco, whether or not you see it yet or not. Just think about it, Draco. Without you there is no longer a Malfoy line. It will end with you, Draco. Think about that, please,” Lucius expressed.
“Your magic is bonded together. Focus on your magic, and yours will lead you to hers.” Severus stated and Draco could see the irritation in his expression.
“I agree.” Hermione said, and the group did just that. They walked out to where Dumbledore was buried and placed the box on top of the white marble and set the box a blaze.
“It suits you love.” Draco said as he leaned over and kissed the top of her head. “I found Jamelynn. It’s an older name but this is what it says about what it means ‘J
“I just wanted to check in with how you’re doing with all of the life changes in the past couple of months?” Narcissa asked.
“That was amazing.” Draco whispered when he finally pulled away to breath, and he started pulling his clothes on. Harry grabbed his vest and pulled it over her dress, and she slipped her panties into Draco’s trouser pocket and took his hand. The stepped out of the alcove to find Narcissa and Lucius standing at the end of the row. “Mum, Dad.” Draco said as Harry pulled him past them, and then Harry stopped and turned towards them.
“You can call me Narcissa, dear, and no. The Dark Lord was always Lucius’ thing. I had some of the same views, but I changed after Draco was born. But I will support my husband until he comes to the same conclusion. I never wanted Draco to grow up like he did and still is, but he’s changed since your accident. I haven’t seen him, but I can tell from his letters. He seems happier and better, more open with his emotions, which is how I wanted to raise him.” Narcissa whispered and the she opened the door and they walked out of the bathroom. Nagini was curled up waiting for them an as soon as the door to the bedroom opened they were walking down the hall with Nagini leading the way. They went down what felt like three flights of stairs before the entered a huge ball room.
Once the shirt was unbuttoned all the way, Harry pulled the shirt out of Draco’s trousers and ran his fingers across his skin and around to his bare back, pushing Draco’s hips down. Draco gasped as the bulge in his trousers was pushed against another bulge. Draco repeated the motion causing Harry to groan against Draco’s lips.
“I don’t really, but I had a conversation with a very observant young man, and with the information I know I feel the pieces fit together, ma’am.”
“None of this was your fault, Theo. I have forgiven you. You were a slave to your father’s abuse, and I understand that more than anything. I see this as a good thing that came out of a bad experience.” Harkin smiled at him, and he smiled back.
“Say that to the people who let your relatives beat you, and do nothing about it when they knew you were being beaten. What does that say about their government that they can stand by, and know that I child is being mistreated, but sit and do nothing about it. That isn’t how children should be treated. Children are precious and should be cherished. I didn’t want to go after you when you were a child but it was necessary for my survival.”
“Those are interesting observations, Mr. Malfoy, and very good logic, I just hope your mind doesn’t get you in trouble, my boy. And I would most definitely inform you of the date of her extraction. May I ask if your mother knows you are doing this for her?”
“Not a problem. Narcissa is my best friend. Her family is mine.” Melody stated. “Good night.” She said as she walked out of the room.
Narcissa knocked on the door, and the person who opened the door looked almost exactly like Draco’s mother, and she most definitely was not the aunt Harry or Draco were expecting. “Cissy? What are you doing here? I haven’t seen you since I married Ted, and mother disowned me. What do you want?” the woman asked, and then her eyes landed on Draco and Harry clutching Draco’s arm. “Cissy, is this Draco? He grew up nice, and who is this nice young man with you?”
“Let yourself heal a little more and actually be discharged from the hospital before you go running around. Alright?” Draco said as he pulled her back in the bed, and he laid down next to her and covered them up. “Just sleep and heal, love.” Draco whispered as he rubbed circles against her skin. They both eventually drifted off to sleep.
“What is it they’ve done to you?” Harry could feel the tears building up in her eyes, and her bottom lip started to quiver.
“You’ve told me everything that is on your mind, and I appreciate that. I completely understand why you act the way you do around me, it’s understandable to everyone. Do you want to find out why you had to lose your parents, why Dumbledore planted you in that house, why he left you there, and did nothing about it? Do you want answers, Harry? Answers that the old man didn’t and won’t give you until you stumble upon them.”
“No, Mr. Malfoy you are not. Other students just found it strange that you dragged Miss Potter in here the way you did.”
Harry found it funny that an article about the Malfoy’s release somehow ended up talking about him. Harry rolled his eyes, set the paper down, and extinguished his light before falling asleep. Harry woke up three times that night, twice were because Teddy was crying, and the other time was because he heard something and had to check it out. The noise was just Kreacher working on organizing the kitchen cabinets and pantry.
“I’m just going to take her up to our room, so she can sleep comfortably. I’ll come and get you if she asks for you.” Draco stated, and Remus nodded. Draco carried her out of the room and up the stair to their bedroom. He laid her down gently on their bed, and he curled up on the bed, pulling her into his side. He stayed up just watching her sleep, and he brushed his fingers over her cheeks to whip away the tears that stained her cheeks.
Remus nodded and stepped forwards and picked her up off Sirius’ lap and held her to his chest as Harkin cried. Remus just held her in his arms as Sirius disappeared through the doors to the dining room. The room temperature started to drop as Harkin continued to cry, and Remus and Harkin were soon curled together on the floor, when Draco burst into the room. “What happened?” Draco said as he pulled Harkin from Remus’ arms into his own, and the room temperature started to return to normal. Harkin was curled into Draco’s side, her face buried in his shoulder with tears sliding down her face, her arms wrapped around his neck and her fingers entangled in his hair.
“Well, Draco found Jamelynn, which was like my Dad’s name, and I still wanted to represent him. So I kept it, and Harkin was as you said unique, and it means dark red or fiery one, which Draco thought was fitting given my sorting.” Harry explained.
Snape’s chanting stopped, and they all turned as they heard a thump across the room. Snape rushed across the room to find Draco lying on the floor, and he touched his fingers to Draco’s skin and they came back cold. He picked Draco up and carried him over to the settee and laid him next to Harry.
“Ask Hermione for the sword of Gryffindor, it’s imbedded with basilisk venom.” Harry muttered before Draco suspected he fell back asleep. Draco gently rested Harry completely against the bed before he walked out of the room, he closed the door and the next moment he was standing in the dining room.
“You have nothing to be sorry for, Draco. I fell over because I am a klutz, and this hasn’t really improved my balance.” Harkin chuckled as she gestured to her baby bump.
“Yes, dragon, of course he does. Just not the same way he did when we were first married. I’ve changed over the years as has your father, just from the mire circumstances we have been through. After my seventh year, Lucius pulled away from me, which is why we married later than most in our class. Lucius was a year ahead of me in school, you remember that right?”
“Yes, Harry Potter. She is right in here.” Narcissa said as she pushed the door open and escorted Draco inside with Sirius right behind them.
“I underestimated the bond that connects them. Whatever happens to Potter happens to Draco, and vice versa. Their bond is more profound than any bound I have seen or heard of before.” At that moment Narcissa walked back into the room with Luna trailing behind her, and then Narcissa spotted her son.
“But you’re coming back, right?” she whispered, and she heard as the room started to clear out to give the pair some time.
“That was the point, Draco.” Harkin smiled as she slipped her knickers on, lifting her dress up showing Draco everything.
“Yes, I know you don’t like me right now, but you will see it my way soon, Harry Potter. Albus Dumbledore is not as he claims. He is the one who placed you in the home of your relatives and left you there, and I can guarantee that he knew exactly what was going on there and did nothing about it. He left you there to endure the pain. If you honestly think that that man is doing any of the things for you, you are sadly mistaken. That man is only doing any of what he is for his own personal gain.”
“Getting out is futile, my dear. And if you continue with that you will harm your beautiful skin more than you already have.” Harry looked up and saw Draco standing there, and it was his voice, but Harry knew that this wasn’t him. Draco wouldn’t hurt her, and he definitely wouldn’t do this. He’s had plenty of free time to do something like this.
“Not at the point Lily had Harry. By then I defected. Only a few people knew, Dumbledore and Lily. She knew I would take care of Harry, though I didn’t get the chance. When I found Lily I was too upset to do anything for Harry, even though I didn’t know at the time that she appointed me. I didn’t find out until Dumbledore already hid her away. Then I couldn’t do anything to find her.” Severus stated.
“We’re still losing altitude. I don’t understand.” Draco whispered as he tried to pull up and brace their landing. They were inches off the ground, and Draco rolled the broom so he took most of the impact as they skidded across the ground. Draco felt his eyes flutter closed as he felt the pain erupt through him. He looked at Harry quickly, who was unconscious sprawled across his chest before the darkness took him.
“Harry, I need these off now.” Draco said tugging at Harry’s pajama bottoms, and he slipped them off along with Harry’s pants. Harry’s cock springing free as the fabric cleared the tip, and Harry groaned in relief. Harry’s hands slipping to the front of Draco’s trousers quickly taking Draco’s pants with them. As soon as Draco’s erection was released from his pants, Draco kicked his legs free of his trousers and pants, and he went back to straddling Harry’s waist. Their erections sitting right next to each other. “Potter, if I had known that you’re so beautiful I would have fucked you earlier, gay or not.”
Harry struggled out of the dress for the better part of an hour before she walked over to the door to let Narcissa, Lucius, and Snape into the room. “How long did you know we were standing out there?” Snape asked.
“Blaise, is a player. If he wants something he’s going to try and get it, but I had a conversation with Neville Longbottom today after potions and he said that Blaine looked happy about being partnered with Harry in potions. But not like a happy that he gets to be partnered with a friend but more of a devious I have a plan and it’s working happy.”
“I am not going anywhere. I will come back every day if that is what you want but I have to take care of this.”
“Oh course, my Lord.” Snape said as he stood, and the four of them with Nagini following walked up to Harry’s room. When they put two floors between the ball room and themselves, the adults turned towards Harry.
“I had no choice, Ron. I was kidnapped by Voldemort. If I didn’t go he was going to take his anger out on Lucius and Narcissa, and I couldn’t do that. Not to Draco. I couldn’t be the reason he lost his parents. Especially at the hands of Voldemort. Could you do that to Hermione, Ron? Could you do that to anyone be the reason they lost their parents?” Harry asked as she pulled Draco closer to her, and he wrapped his arms around her waist.
“I was afraid you wouldn’t want me anymore, be-because of the potion that changed me into this. Be-because I’m now a girl.”
“This is real, Harry. You aren’t in your head anymore. I promise.” Draco whispered as he rested his forehead against Harry’s.
“You were handling it better than I would have, so I just let you go. Though Ron did look more pissed than if I would have handled it.”
“She’s safe, and Mel is in your room checking them over.” Narcissa barely said in his room before he started moving. “I will speak with you in your study.” Narcissa said before walking out of the room.
“I’ll talk to her be right back.” Draco unfurled himself from Harry and pulled the blanket up over him, and he was out of the room and standing casually next to the portrait of the Fat Lady as Ginny ran crying up to the portrait. “You know neither of us had any choice in this right. I didn’t want to become a vampire, and accidentally feed on Harry and have him for the rest of my undead life. That wasn’t the plan, but it’s the cards I was dealt, and I can guarantee Harry feels the same way. Both of us though, or at least I am going to embrace the new life that I have. I was going to be content in my feeling, and just watch silently as the person I knew I loved married and had children with his wife. I was going to hope that I could grow out of my silly crush on Harry Potter and live my own life. I knew how I felt, and I could deal with the fact that he loved you, Ginny. But now I have him, and I’m not letting him go. I just hope that you can do what I was going to do for you, and just let him be happy. That’s all I want is for him to be happy.” Draco started walking away, and he turned back towards her with his hands in his pockets. “I just hope that that is what you want as well, because if it’s not, I’m taking him away, and you won’t see him again until your funeral. I don’t want him to be unhappy, and I will do everything in my power to make sure he is, even if that means taking him away from all of the people he knows and cares about. I don’t think he would mind traveling, do you?” at that Draco walked away, and back to the Hospital Wing. He found Harry asleep on the bed that he left him on and he curled up next to him and fell asleep as well.
While thinking about Draco, Harry stepped into the flames, and when he opened his eyes he was sitting in a hospital bed with Draco wrapped around him. Harry thought he was dreaming until he shifted and Draco was on top of him. “You’re awake. Are you, you?” He asked and Harry looked up at Draco and their eyes met. “It’s you. I can see it in your eyes there isn’t that darkness there that was there when I looked in them when the Dark Lord was in your head. How did you escape?”
The stone was cracked and in some places the only thing keeping it together was the stone, and Hermione leaned down and picked it up, and she walked out of the room. Everyone slowly following her as she walked, almost practically ran, to the hospital wing. When she pushed open the doors, she found Harry sitting with his legs pulled up to his chest and his arms wrapped around them, and Draco had his entire body wrapped around Harry, slightly rocking Harry to comfort him with his fingers stroking Harry’s hair.
“Lucius…” Harkin barely whispered as she felt a hook behind her navel, and she could feel as the portkey whisked her away.
“I’m not due until summertime, Pansy. They are technically due in September, that would be nine months, but given that they are twins, we are thinking probably June or July. At the latest August.” Harkin stated. “And it is only the start of April, Pansy.” Harkin chuckled, and Draco rolled his eyes again.
“Yes, because you only want me alive now, because I have a piece of your soul latched onto mine. You only care because if I die you are just closer to your own death, and you fear death. I’ll tell you this, just because I prefer not to die, does not mean that I fear it. I will gladly die if it means that I save the ones that I love. Just remember that in you endeavors, and trying to keep me in line. I do expect to go back to school as well. I do need to learn, and you aren’t going to stop me from doing that. I will think on my own and you are going to let me, because I don’t follow the rules, I don’t like them much.” Harry turned on her heels and walked out of the room, but was pulled back into the room, and the door slammed in front of her. She turned and stared at Voldemort.
“Ah, Severus, Lucius, would you mind taking Miss Potter up to her room? I have some business to attend too. Nagini will follow you up.”
“Fortunately I saved him from that fate, and my father is dead no now, so he can’t harm Harry.” Draco answered, and he dropped his arm.
“I don’t know, but I’ll take her to St. Mungos.” Narcissa said as she cast a lightening charm and picked Harry up, and they carried her out of the garden and to the drawing room. Narcissa was grabbing floo powder when Lucius walked in with Severus behind him.
“Mmm, but you took the brunt of the landing, Dray.” She as she dragged her fingernails down his back, and Draco groaned.
The Healer gave Draco every single spell that he performed on Harry, and the list that was also in his chart that some of the nurses cast on him. “Satisfied, Mr. Malfoy?”
The next chapter is where I'm going to bring Harry's female name into play. i had to rewrite this chapter a little to get the set up for it, but I've figured it out. i hope you enjoyed the chapter. i feel like the next couple of chapters are a little rushed, but i didn't know how else to write it and sound alright, so i hope you enjoyed this chapter, and the next ones will be posted when i get a few more chapters written.
“You are growing.” She whispered to him, and they went back to their meal, and eventually everyone else slowly did too. The meal went by rather quickly after that, and then everyone moved to the ballroom, and the Malfoy family started the dance off with a dance. Lucius and Narcissa and Draco and Harkin.
“I think I’m good.” Harkin whispered as she turned in Draco’s lap so she was facing him. “The nausea has passed for now, but I don’t know how long that will last.” She smiled, and Draco kissed her lips, but she pulled away from the kiss.
“Definitely…” Harry wrapped her legs around Draco, and Draco’s lips found their way down to her collarbone and then to her breasts where they started sucking on the skin there. One of Draco’s hands found its way to her other breast and started playing with her nipple and she moaned out loud. “Dray…that’s…amazing.” She panted, and Draco switched, and his free hand slide down between her legs and one finger played with her clitoris before sliding inside her. Her legs fell open away from Draco’s body giving him better access and he pushed another finger inside her. Harry released this gasped moan, and she could feel Draco smirk against her skin. “Dray, please.” She pleaded, and he slipped another finger inside her. “No. No more fingers.” Harry whispered, “I want you inside me…please.” Draco pulled his fingers out of her and placed the slicked up fingers on her hips while he pushed himself inside her, and Harry whimpered as he did it nice and slow for her.
“You look so much like Lily. Honestly, I think this suits you better than when you were an exact replica of James. You’re beautiful, fawn. I’m glad you’re alright, now.” Sirius whispered in her ear, and Harry smiled as Sirius pulled her back to get a better look at her.
I fixed the formatting error, don't know why it did that but i hope that it is a little bit easier to read now. hope you all enjoy and comments are greatly appreciated.
“I can’t answer that yet, but if my calculations are correct he should be completely free by the end of the school year if not before. You may have to testify since you were a witness in your third year to the events in the shrieking shack, but I will push for that to not happen, given by the time they will need you to testify you will be four to six months pregnant. Given the circumstances behind your pregnancy I want it kept secret as long as possible. I have talked to professor Dumbledore, Professor McGonagall, and Severus about you both having access to each other’s common rooms, and Draco getting a private room. Your bond is essential to your lives now, and that is important. I also talked about the school being informed and them not being able to say anything about it to anyone.”
“Nice try, Potter, but do you think I’m that daft? The minute I bring her out of her sleep she is going to send for help.”
“Yes, Mr. Potter you may. I will fetch her now, and bring you some different clothes to change into for now.” McGonagall walked out of the room, and Harry sat there waiting for them to return. When they did, McGonagall handed Harry some of his clothes, and everyone stepped out of the room while he changed. Harry finished and he stepped out of the room to see McGonagall, Hermione, and Madam Pomfrey staring at him.
“No, don’t be. You make it more fun and made me want to work to be better and learn new tricks.” Harkin stated.
“But what about Lucius or Draco, especially since I’m carrying the next generation of the Malfoy line.” Harkin stated.
I am so very sorry I haven't posted in a while. I was stuck with where I wanted to go with this, and I think I have figured it out. Hopefully, anyway. I hope you like it, and I'm hoping now that I've figured out where I want to end this fic that I'll be posting a little more until it is done. Hopefully. I hope you enjoy.
Harry knew who it was as soon as he said that, it could only be one person. Harry’s eyes widened for they were the only part of her body she could move, and she tried to fight the spell, but she still didn’t move. “Harry, calm down, please. I know you know who I am, but until the potion wears off I’m stuck as Draco. I’m going to remove the spell now, and you’re going to stay quiet, got it?” Theodore waved his wand and the spell allowed Harry to move again, and Harry immediately started struggling against the ropes harder.
“I love it when you order me around.” Harry started moving again, thrusting himself in and out of Draco. Draco arched his back and his abdomen and erection pushed against Harry’s abdomen. Harry arched his back into Draco’s erection as his slick cock brushed against Harry’s bare skin. “Dray, I-I think I’m almost there. I’m almost going to-to cum. I’m nearly there, Dray.” Harry started thrusting faster as he came closer and closer to cumming. Harry came after Draco’s cum splattered their abdomens; after Harry came inside of Draco he pulled out, and he laid down beside Draco on his bed.
“The library here at the Manor. There are a lot of interesting books up there, and not knowing anything about how to be a woman let alone a mother, one tends to want to know more about it.” Harkin stated.
The group stepped off the train and towards the carriages, when they bumped into the Weasley’s. “Hey, watch it…” Ron said as Draco ran into him, because he was paying attention to Harkin and not to where he was going. Oh, it’s you. Stealing all of my friends now?” he accused.
“I know, and he can’t hide forever, Dray. He will be found, and he will pay for everything that he has done.” Harkin stated, and Draco nodded.
Harry remember Bill and Fleur’s wedding, he remembered Kingsley’s Patronus crashing the wedding, he remembered running for Ginny and being pushed back. He remembers apparating to where ever they apparated and getting coffee. He remembered Grimmauld Place, Kreacher, and the Ministry. He remembered leaving that Ministry and Ron getting splinched. He remembered Ron leaving and Godric’s Hollow. He remembered getting the sword out of that little pond in Dean’s Forest, and Ron coming back and destroying the horcrux. He remembers going to see Xenophilius Lovegood, and the Death Eaters attacking them. The next thing he remembers is Malfoy Manor, and then things start to get fuzzy.
“You can’t go. Not after…Remi…you can’t leave me, too.” Harkin sobbed, and Remus was kneeling next to her on the floor.
“What did you do?” the man shouted, and Draco watched as the magic around them turned a violent red and through the Dark Lord from the room slamming the door behind him. Draco stared stunned at the door as the magic turned blue then purple then green and finally white before he felt it flood back towards and inside himself and Harry. Draco felt as darkness flooded him and he was asleep on the bed curled around Harry.
“What is it now Mr. Malfoy? A sprained wrist.” Pomfrey stated as she walked out of her office and the she saw Harry dangling from his arms. “Oh, my dear child. Bring her over here and place her on this bed. What happened?”
“Yes, but I didn’t know until your third year.” Severus said as Harry gave him another funny look. “When you left the Dursley’s that night you blew up your aunt, Albus lost track of you. No one could find you until you turned up at the Leaky Cauldron. I went out looking for you, and I started at the Dursley’s.”
“Great, so he won’t even tell us what he did to us, when it’s his fault that this happened, and he knows how to help and explain things.” Draco groaned, and his mother rested her hand on his shoulder.
“Good it is still here. She can’t be far.” Of course Arthur let Dumbledore know she was here. Because without her Dumbledore’s little plan won’t work, but Harry wasn’t having it. She was tired of being his pawn to move around the chess board. Harry looked at Nagini and she slithered off with Harry on her tail. They got behind the men and Harry grabbed the prophecy off the shelf and started heading back the way she came trying to stick to the shadows as much as possible, but then she heard noise behind her and she made the mistake of turning.
“Draco isn’t going to find out. He can’t know; no one can know. Do you understand? No one can find out what he did. Once one person finds out everyone knows, and I can’t deal with people looking at me like that. Promise me you won’t tell anyone what I just said.”
“And I knew you were there. Help me out of this stupid clothing trap.” Harry said with a huff. Narcissa walked up to her and pulled her into the bathroom where she started unzipping the dress. The dress slipped off with ease, and Narcissa went to work on the corset. Finally after a half an hour, the corset was off, and Narcissa could see all the bruises on Harry’s skin.
Eventually, Madam Pomfrey walked back into the room, and she had Professor McGonagall with her. Harry groaned aloud as he placed his face in his hands and his now long hair fell in his face. Harry brushed it behind his ear quickly and looked up at the two women. “I’m stuck, aren’t I?” Harry questioned.
Draco cradled Harkin in his lap, and they waited for her healer to arrive, and soon Melody arrived followed by Madam Pomfrey. “Draco, what happened?” she questioned.
He was standing in the graveyard before Voldemort, and the cup is a portkey, and Harry turns around and Accios the cup before the pain starts because he knows the pain will start. He’s standing in the room with the arch and he watches Sirius fall through the veil as Remus holds him back, and he’s reliving Sirius’ death over and over. Remus’ arms just wrapped around him to make sure he doesn’t try and follow. Harry won’t follow though, he has to get rid of Voldemort he has to make sure he can’t take any more people from him. He’s done with being nice about this to him, he’s taken too much, and then Harry realizes why he’s stuck in his head. Voldemort has trapped him inside his worst fears and memories.
“I’m your family healer, and we went to school together, of course. It’s not even a question, Cissy. Plus her and Draco look beautiful together; I can’t believe she’s Harry Potter, like damn.”
“Of course.” Madam Pomfrey walked out of the room and into her office as Draco sat down in the chair next to her bed. Madam Pomfrey was only gone for a few minutes, but Draco was concerned about the paleness of her skin and the stone imbedded in the scratches on her wrist. Draco slowly pulled her skirt and knickers down just a smidge to see slight bruises forming on her hips and thighs. Draco was trying to keep calm until he heard Madam Pomfrey walk back into the room.
“You have an appointment with our healer at 1 this afternoon. Healer Johnson is amazing and very discrete. She is probably the only one outside of the family that’s seen Draco’s…”
“Miss Potter accidentally dropped a house on herself and my sister. My guess is she didn’t take in the fact of the structure of the house when she forcibly removed the wards that the structure of the house would become unstable. She took my deranged sister out by dropping a house on her rather Wizard of Oz like Miss Potter.”
“Shit,” Harry whispered under her breath, and then she heard footsteps coming towards her and she realized she forgot her invisibility cloak. She pulled out her wand as she backed into one of the nooks next to the library and she held her breath.
“Think about it, put two and two together, and you get…” Draco said with a smirk. Weasley looked at him like his mind was going to explode. “Don’t think about it too hard, Weasley. What do you want I’ll relay the message?”
Harry woke in Draco’s bed with Draco curled around him, and she sighed as she curled deeper into his side. She felt as he shifted, pulling her even closer to him in his sleep, and she smiled as she nuzzles her face into the side of his neck. She started kissing the exposed skin there, and she heard Draco moan in his sleep as she started sucking on the skin right below his ear.
“I’m sorry, Siri, I would have informed you myself, but we were just coming in for a check-up ourselves. Lucius and I just wanted her checked out by our healer since she hadn’t been to one since she fell into our care. Do you want to see her? I’m sure she won’t mind, we’re just heading back in now.” Narcissa stated as she started pulling Draco towards the room that held Harry.
“No, Harry. You aren’t going to implode or anything. You shouldn’t have anymore issues unless it is related to your actual pregnancy. Your families are waiting for you in my office.”
“Yes, we may go, Mother,” Draco responded, and then Narcissa disappeared. They ended up at the Manor, and Harry stumbled as they landed and he stumbled into Draco. Draco wrapped his arms around Harry to help stabilize him a little bit. “Sorry, Harry. I forgot that you’ve never disappeared before. How are you doing?” Harry looked up at Draco, and he just nodded his head.
“Yeah, Harry. You defeated him on May 2nd. You’ve been living at Grimmauld Place with Andromeda and Teddy.” Hermione stopped when she realized what she had said. She just sat up straighter and looked up at Madam Pomfrey. “Can you get Professor McGonagall to get Andromeda here with Teddy, please? I think she would be the best person to explain this to him.”
“Like a balloon. She wasn’t really his aunt she was his uncle’s sister and she kind of deserved it; she was making comments about his parents mostly his mum.”
“Though I would love to sit at the Gryffindor table, I feel that the Slytherins protect their own more and don’t judge as much. Plus, you’re the Ice Prince, they worship you. The Gryffindors haven’t been as excepting as I thought they would about this, and I don’t want to deal with them right now.” Harkin stated, and Draco nodded.
“I don’t think they will have a problem with what happened. If you explained what happened.” Draco stated.
“Sirius, he’s fine. He’s just a little out. You aren’t even supposed to be here. What did Dumbledore say? Stay out of sight, you’re supposed to be dead,” Shouted a voice that was coming near the doorway and in walked a man that Draco knew for sure, Professor R. J. Lupin, their Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher in their third year. “Dora knows what she is doing.”
“Severus, maybe this isn’t the best topic to be talking about in front of Draco. I feel it’s not appropriate.” Narcissa struggled for the words as she walked up to her son and wrapped her arms around him.
“Wait,” Harry said as he pulled back and looked Draco in the eyes as what he said finally sank in. “Your parents already know that your bi, when did you tell them that?” Harry asked as Draco tried to kiss him again, but Harry pushed him away. “Draco, answer me, please. How long have your parents known this?”
“The closet is self-stocking. When we are running low on something it will refill. When the babies move up in diaper sizes the smaller sizes will disappear from the closet.” Draco explained.
“G-go away. I don’t need your pity. Not now…not ever. If you only knew.” Harry whispered, but Snape followed her.
Harry’s fingers grazed across Draco’s now cooled skin, and the door burst open again. In the doorway stood Lucius and Narcissa, and Draco pulled the sheets up farther to make sure Harry was covered. “Draco, what did you do?”
“I don’t know honestly. I was heading to potions when I heard a noise come from the small alcove next to Professor Snape’s storeroom and I went to investigate and found her. She was a little more undressed, but I figured she wouldn’t want to be on display for anyone I might run into on my way up here.”
“Did you get fuck your first time?” Harry asked the second question because he wanted to know more about Draco.
The next morning when Harry woke up, he rolled over, and he found himself buried into Draco’s side. “Well, good morning to you to, Harry.”
“Why would I when you think I’m the product of a mudblood and a blood traitor? That is who I am Draco, and you despise people of that such, so why would you want to be with me. You want to know why I keep questioning why you would want to be with me that is the reason right there.”
“You really do like breaking rule. So much like your father.” Severus drawled as he walked into the room. “Have you discussed her guardianship yet?”
Finally, Severus returned, and he handed two vials to Melody. “Why did you bring two?” Melody asked, and Severus just gave her a look. “Never mind, that was a stupid question. Their cores are combined, so whatever is affecting her is also affecting him just deluded. It’s been a long night so far.” Melody stated, and she forced one potion down Harkin's throat and then the other down Draco's throat. “How long does it take to work usually?”
“Ginny please don’t interfere; I don’t want to hurt you.” Harkin stated, and Ginny actually took a couple steps towards Draco and Severus before running down the stairs completely. “Thank you.” Harkin whispered, and she softened a little. “Ready for a real duel, Ronald. We’ve never dueled before so this will be interesting.” Harkin smirked, and Ron took a shy step in her direction, so they were on level ground. Ron nodded a quick nod before firing off a handful of spells, all of which, Harkin easily deflected and practically absorbed. Ron stared in shock for a moment at the sight, and Harkin smirked, she didn’t know that was a thing. Harkin then did the same, sending of a flourish of non-lethal spells in Ron’s direction; she could send them off just a little quicker than Ron’s skill of being able to deflect, and he fell. Harkin then just turned and started walking back over to Draco, but then felt a small prick in her side. She reached down, and when she pulled her hand back there was a small trail of blood running down her side. “Sev,” she whispered, before she collapsed, and Severus caught her.
“Well, I like to tease when I wake up to find this amazing organ jabbing me in the hip in the morning.” Harkin replied with a smirk. “And maybe I won’t even let you cum after your outburst yesterday.” She smirked wider as she pushed something onto his cock, and she sat up and crawled off the bed and walked over to her wardrobe to pull out one of her dresses to change into and pulled it on, making sure to show Draco that she hadn’t put any knickers on. She walked over to the door, and she turned back to Draco. “Are you coming? Your mother is probably wondering where we are for breakfast.” Harkin smirked before walking out of the room, noticing that Draco realized she put a cock ring on him, and she walked to the dining room where she found Narcissa and Lucius waiting for her.
Harry pulled away to breath and looked him in the eyes. “This is real right. I’m not still inside my head. Right?”
“Oh, don’t get cocky. You didn’t change anything. Voldemort is now out of my life and I don’t have to deal with him, so that takes care of 95% of the weird things that happen at Hogwarts.”
“Better?” Draco nodded and Harry’s free hand slid from Draco’s face and down his abdomen, his fingers wrapping around Draco’s erection, and he started massaging it with his finger. Draco’s head slipped backwards as Draco relaxed on the bed. Harry pulled his fingers out and lubed up his hard erection. “You ready?” Draco nodded again, and Harry positioned himself and pushed his hard on into Draco’s prepped entrance slowly letting Draco adjust to each movement.
Now they were at the summer before their sixth year at Hogwarts, and Harry and Draco were finally together. Though, now Harry had doubts about his relationship with Draco once again. Why couldn’t Draco just act consistent like everyone else? Why did this have to be so difficult?
The door of Draco’s room burst open then and in ran Narcissa. Draco looked up at his mother and was about to say something when she cut him off. “Draco, we have to leave. Your father, I think he’s gone mad. I can’t go on like this anymore. Your father said he was done with this, ever since you brought Harry home for the first time, but he’s dug himself into a hole and I don’t want to be a part of it anymore. Pack your things we are going to go to my sisters and then I am going to take as much gold out of our vault as possible before your father finds out. Quickly please.” Narcissa had never looked so scared in all the time that Harry had known her, and Harry swore he saw small bruises on her arms that she was trying to cover up with long sleeves, but they crept out slightly from under her sleeves.
“Sometimes when you want to keep something hidden from those you love, it only hurts you more. My life has been awful, and most people couldn’t handle everything that has happened to me, but the things that I have told people are the parts that they can handle, the rest, not so much.” Harkin stated. “Now, we should probably get to this lesson, before my emotions get the better of me, because I really have no idea when I will start crying anymore. Merlin, all I can think about is how I’m going to hide this pregnancy, because I can’t keep my emotions in check.” Harkin whispered, and Narcissa pulled the chair next to her out and sat down next to her.
“I’m trusting you, Snape. You better not be lying.” Ron said. “I’m not only trusting you with my life I’m trusting you with Harry’s and Hermione’s and my family and friends.” Ron said. Snape created a portkey to the headmaster’s office, and they all took hold. They felt the tug of the portkey, and they were standing in the headmaster’s office. “It’s weird being back.” Ron whispered.
“Then I am wrong and she heals in the same amount of time as usual. I will have dinner brought up to you. Sleep for now. Get better, my dragon.” Narcissa stated and she stood, kissing the top of Draco’s head and then Harry’s before she left the room. Draco watched as his mother closed the door, and he was left alone with a sleeping Harry and a working house elf. Draco stroked Harry’s hair and listened to the house elf hum as she worked, and Draco could feel as he was slowly pulled into the darkness of sleep.
“I agree, and I’m also glad that my father never finished the contract with the Greengrass’ before he went to Azkaban.” Draco stated.
“Yes, and test me she will use that time, but she also has to teach you about fine dining. More than a three course meal, fine dining, where you have more than one fork and more than one spoon.” Draco stated, and Harkin pulled away from him and stared him right in the eyes.
Harry then handed the note over to Rodolphus and he read it over. He must not have seen anything wrong since he gave it back. Harry then folded the note into a little tent and wrote her name on the side, and then Harry placed it on the night stand. Harry then walked over to Teddy and gave him a kiss on the top of the head. “I’m sorry, little man. I’ve taken way too much from you. I couldn’t take her too. I love you, little man.” Harry left his wand in the hands of Teddy giving Andromeda another clue if the ink didn’t work anymore. Harry turned back to Rodolphus, and he cast a spell to bind Harry.
Harry just laid there, she didn’t know how long she was there, but suddenly the door opened and there stood Mr. Nott. “I’m going to take you on a little trip, and you are going to behave. Understood?” Harry didn’t do anything, but Nott walked up to the bed and pulled out his wand and the ropes disappeared, and Harry could feel as Nott grabbed her ankles and pulled her to the end of the bed. As soon as she was close enough she yanked one of her feet free and kicked Nott in the face and she heard and felt his nose break. He released her and she was up and making a beeline for the door when she tripped. She fell and tried to stop her fall and broke her arm, and she screamed.
“I love you, too.” Draco said, and then he leaned down and kissed her on the lips. “Easter break will be here in less than a month, and we will officially be one, officially be family.” Draco finished after pulling away.
Harry moved so his erection was resting on Draco’s, and he flicked his hips forward, grinding there erections together. Moans escaped both of their lips, and Draco and Harry had locked their lips together, and Harry forced his tongue into Draco’s mouth the minute it opened. Draco pulled Harry’s hips forward over and over again as Harry swirled his tongue around Draco’s mouth, and finally Harry couldn’t take it anymore, and he took Draco’s hands and moved them to the waistband of his pants. Draco received the message and his fingers started working on Harry’s pants, pulling them off as quickly as he could.
“Yes, but what does that do to a person, especially a person who has another person growing inside them.”
“Mom, we swear we didn’t know that anyone else was in the house we thought that everyone left for breakfast. We thought that it would be alright if we just stayed behind and had a little fun. I’m sorry, Mom. We won’t do it too often, we promise, and this isn’t Harry’s fault.” Draco took hold of Harry’s wrists and wrapped them around his own waist.
“She is upstairs sleeping again, Mum.” Draco whispered as he brushed his fingers through his hair, and Narcissa knew that he was worried because his hair was falling into his face and his hands were shaking slightly. Narcissa stepped forwards and wrapped her arms around her son.
“You look really cute together.” Healer Johnson said. “I want to keep you here for a few hours just to make sure everything is alright. I want one hour with you, and one hour without you, and then you can go home.” She said. “I need to get back to some of my other patients, but I’ll be back.” She then walked out of the room, and Draco shifted Harry and crawled in behind her on the bed. Holding her close, Draco watched her as she fell asleep in his arms. Draco slowly fell asleep as well.
“Yes, I will be right back.” Madam Pomfrey walked out of the room, and Hermione looked back at Harry who looked like he was trying to remember something that he was missing.
Sorry i haven't posted in a while. my roommate was in the process of moving out and having my new roommate move in. so it's been a busy couple of weeks. here's the next chapter i hope you enjoy what enfolds in this chapter.
“I’m afraid so, love. Let’s go and grab your wand out of your trunk and we can start trying our magic and training it.” Draco said as he wrapped his arm around her waist.
“You can see it in his eyes and the way that he looks at me. Trust me the way he looks at me is the same way that everyone else who knows looks at me. It’s the same look that the three of you are giving me right now. I’m not as stupid as you make me out to be, Professor.” Harry said as she went to stand up but was stopped by a hand on her shoulder. “If you could kindly leave, I would feel much better. And if you tell anyone, I don’t know what I’ll do.” Harry pushed past Snape and into the bedroom where she crawled onto the big bed and curled into the fetal position in the middle and fell asleep. The three adults looked at each other, and walked out of the room and then the manor. They all gave each other a nod and they disapparated.
“I don’t know for sure. It’s different for each case. Draco will probably bounce back rather quickly given that Harkin was the one that was poisoned.” Severus explained, and then Draco woke up coughing and retching. Severus grabbed Harkin off of his lap and onto the bed next to his, while Draco appeared to retch up black ooze.
“The fact that you said that greatly disappoints me, Albus, because it brings to attention that you already know what I am talking about, and the fact that you let it happen is rather disappointing.”
“They’re in the Room of Requirement right now looking for it. You are going to stay here and recover, and you have no say in that. Especially, after our little escapade.” Draco smirked, and Harry laid back down. McGonagall was staring at the pair with her eyes wide.
“I would never deprive my sister of her first grandchild. She always wanted a little girl.” Bellatrix cooed as she placed her hand on Harkin’s stomach making her flinch. “So, until this baby is out, I won’t hurt you. After that I will cut one piece off you at a time and mail them to my traitorous nephew.” Bellatrix screamed.
“It is alright, dear. I don’t blame you for anything that man made you do. I understand and the only thing that makes it better is the knowledge that you are safe now. Everything is alright.” Arthur whispered, and Harry broke down she just kept muttering I’m sorry over and over again as she cried into his shoulder. Arthur just held her there against his side as she cried, and everyone just watched as Harry released all her grief. Soon she finished crying and Harry climbed off the bed and stepped back over to Draco, and he pulled her into his side.
“I wished to speak to the both of you after class, Miss Potter.” Severus stated and she turned her attention from Draco to the professor standing in front of their desk.
“Potions accident with Longbottom. I heard it’s permanent.” Theo said with his head bowed, suddenly himself and very interested in his shoes.
When Harry woke up the next morning in Draco’s arms, he looked up at him and watched as his features started changing. He could see as Draco was waking up, like he knew that Harry was awake and his body automatically started waking him up to be with Harry. The minute Draco’s silver eyes finally fluttered open, Harry was stroking his fingers up and down Draco’s side.
“Well, as you may know from experience, at a young age it is difficult to keep your hands off your partner. Well, your father wasn’t coming back to school with me, and he was just starting to officially court me. We were both nervous about the other being unfaithful, and the week before I left for school your father invited me to France with him. He told my parents that his father was coming with us, and we were going to be locked on our own rooms. It turned out it was just going to be the two of us. We had a marvelous time, and he brought me back so I could leave for school.”
“What are you doing in here, Harry? You’ve been in here for over an hour. How did I know that you were in here? I know that that was going to be your question. Harry just because I’m not looking at you doesn’t mean that I am not tracking your movements at all times. I know that you cast a locking and silencing charm on this room, because I know that you would be thinking about if this was a great idea or not, so you would want to not be interrupted. Well, too bad, Harry. I’m interrupting you because I want you to know that I’m not going anywhere, I love you, and no matter how much you think it isn’t going to change that. You can convince yourself that I don’t, but I still will Harry. Do you understand this, love?” Draco whispered as his hand found its way down Harry’s chest and between his legs. Harry had to put out his arms and brace himself on the wall of the shower.
“Well, then you don’t get it, Ronald. Draco and I are one you can’t hurt him without hurting me. Got it. I am pregnant with his children, and we are going to get married over Easter break. Draco and I are not easily split able, now, or ever, Ronald; we are forever entwined. Now, if that is the only thing that is preventing us from being friends again, then stop this before you do something you will either regret or can’t come back from, please, Ron.” Harkin pleaded, and she made a mistake in lowering her defences and her wand, which Ron took to his advantage and cast a spell at them. Harkin froze as she wasn’t expecting him to fire on her, she thought she almost got through to him. Soon, Draco was in front of her instead of behind her, only not casting a shielding spell, just shielding her with himself. Her eyes widened in horror as Draco coughed up a little blood in her face. “Draco,” she whispered in shock. “Draco!” she shouted as he crumpled in her arms, taking her down with him, because she doesn’t have the strength to hold him up. “Severus, please. Help!” Harkin screamed, and Severus came running around the corner and some of the students from the Great hall started running in. They started flocking around Draco and Harkin, and Severus started casting healing spells on Draco.
“I think she will do fine. She doesn’t take shit, and I think she will hold her own rather well. We’ll see.” Narcissa stated. “But let’s not think about that right now. I want to talk about the wedding. I am planning for the wedding to be over Easter break. I know you will be just barely showing then, but it won’t be that hard to hide that. We’ll have a small party, and when you are older and out of school, we’ll have a proper wedding ceremony for you.” Narcissa stated, and Harry was about to comment, when Draco cut her off.
“Ronald is just upset over Arthur, Harry, dear. He’ll be fine when the doctors say Arthur’s out of the woods. I don’t blame you dear. Come say hello.” Mrs. Weasley said as she took Harry’s hand and pulled her towards Arthur and away from Draco’s grasp. Draco nearly protested until Harry gave him a look that said to wait, and Draco stopped. Harry walked up to Arthur and he smiled at her.
Harry watched as Malfoy left the room, and he wondered why he felt like he should apologize to him, but Harry could feel Hermione’s eyes examining him. “What is it, Mione?”
Harry felt her eyes well up with tears, but she didn’t let them fall, because she wasn’t giving them that satisfaction. But Nott continued, “I have given your wand to Lucius and he will put it somewhere you will never find it, so if you do escape you will not get far on your own. You are going to do something for the Dark Lord, and then you have one of two choices, one join him or die. I just hope you are smart in your decision, because quite frankly, I think you’re too beautiful to waste.” Nott finished and grabbed a hand full of Harry’s hair and yanked her head back to look at him. Nott’s eyes didn’t leave Harry as he said the next thing. “You are dismissed, Lucius; I’m going to have a little fun with
“You are right. I did originally come to take a bath to go to bed after.” Harkin said as she turned in Draco’s arms, and he picked her up and carried her to their bed. Harkin laughed as Draco spun her around in the air before he placed her on the bed, and he crawled in next to her. Draco curled around her, and they fell asleep in each other’s arms.
When she finished casting her charms, she turned to her son. “I am turning your suite into a master suite, since you and Harry are practically married. I feel that this is the best option for both of you, and she never has to go back to those awful muggles if she doesn’t want to. I have accepted that she will be part of this family no matter what your father and I may have to say about it. Your father is still disappointed, but he will get over it eventually. Especially after he really sees how you and Harry look at each other. I see it, my dragon, and I am happy that you are happy.”
“I can and I will, especially when it comes to this specific case. I know the weapons that were used on Harry. I know exactly what they do and the exact set of spells that can save him. If you give me one spell that doesn’t work with that specific set of spells, the death of the Savior of the Wizarding World will be on you, so give me the bloody spells that you used on Harry, all of them. Don’t leave a single spell out.” Draco ordered, and Draco could see as that realization processed through his head.
“Always, dragon.” Narcissa said as she pulled away. “We should head back inside the hour is almost up.” Draco looked at his mother and them up at the building they walked out of, and Narcissa chuckled. “Come, dragon, let’s get you back to your love.” They started walking inside when they stopped because of yelling that filled the room.
“Well, it’s a pretty basic dream, Dray. It was about the night that Voldemort murdered my parents. I don’t remember the beginning; I never remember the beginning. We were playing that’s all I remember, and then the front door bursts open, and my father rushes out into the front foyer. He shouts, ‘Lily, he’s here. Get Harry out, now.’ My father then rushes out of view, and my mother picks up both of their wands and then she picks me up and runs up the stairs. She runs into my nursery and she slams the door shout and she starts putting up protective spells around the room, but before she is done we heard a thud on the stairs, which could only mean one thing, my father just died at the hands of Voldemort. My mother then drops to the side of my crib and she starts talking to me, but I can never hear what she is saying, so her mouth is moving but no words are coming out of her mouth. Then the door bangs open and a flash of green light and then I bolt upright in my bed, awake.” As Harry talked he curled himself into a tight ball curled into Draco’s side.
“Not so loud.” Harry whispered. “I want to change it to fit my new gender, but it’s actually really similar to my boy name, so it’s not that big of a deal.” Harry smiled hoping that Sirius wouldn’t make a big deal of it right here in the lobby of St. Mungos as Narcissa slipped into the flames.
“What do you mean Mr. Malfoy killed Voldemort six days ago? Why are we still concerned then?” Professor Vector said as she stepped forwards.
“You shouldn’t know that. How do you know that?” Harkin whispered. “We need to talk to Severus.” Harkin stated as she stood up and pulled Draco from the couch.
“Pushing all my magic towards her and the baby, trying to sooth them and make them realize they’re safe.” Draco stated.
“That is best. Severus and I figured out how to reverse the condition she’s in to stabilize her. Both she and the baby are fine. The bond still exists; it’s just stabilized, so she is able to carry the baby. I want to keep a close eye on both of them, every two weeks would be preferable.”
Draco turned back towards the Minister after he watched her storm out of room. “I’m sorry, but can you honestly blame her for her reaction to you?”
“Harry, do you really want to do this here and now?” Draco ran his fingers across Harry’s forehead brushing some of his hair out of his eyes. Draco leaned down and trailed kisses down Harry’s jaw and neck. Harry let out soft whimpers as Draco laid the kisses across his skin.
“In other words you are wasting my time.” Harry turned and continued walking, and he barely noticed the small crowd growing. Harry felt as Malfoy grab her arm, and he pulled her into one of the empty classrooms. “What the hell, Malfoy?” Harry squealed as Malfoy shut the door.
“Alright, well, I’ll put it in terms so everyone can understand since it looks like the Weasley’s have no idea what I’m talking about either. A vampire’s first is a special case. Their transformation isn’t complete until they taste and drain their first victim. When they don’t drain their first victim, they create a bond that is similar to a werewolf’s mate, only way more protective. He is connected to Harry, though every bond is different depending on how close they come to killing their first victim. Most of the time the vampires are stuck with only being able to drink from that one victim for the rest of their existence, and they feel everything that their mate does emotions and pain, if their mate dies they die. Though that doesn’t seem like the case here. You said you nary killed Harry how far did you go? And why did you stop?”
“I will, Professor. Well, I have some homework to do, if you will excuse me.” Draco walked from the hospital wing to the Slytherin common room, and he wrote a letter to one of his mother’s favorite flower shops, and ordered some flowers. He took the letter up to the owlery and sent it off before heading to charms. The rest of his day went by rather quickly and before he knew it was 6pm, and Draco was walking up to the gargoyle to Dumbledore’s office. “Lemon Drops.” Draco guessed and the gargoyle sprung to life, and Draco stepped onto the staircase as it started moving up to Dumbledore’s office.
“Oh, your trousers.” Harry muttered with a smirk. “What would you do if I made you cum in your trousers, Malfoy?” Harry’s fingers circled around the bulge in Malfoy’s trousers, and Malfoy groaned. “Oh, you’re close aren’t you, Malfoy. Getting me off made you so hard, didn’t it?” Harry whispered, and he unbuttoned Malfoy’s trousers, slipping her hand inside and wrapping around Malfoy’s erection. Malfoy moaned as he thrust his hips up into Harry’s hands, and Harry pulled her hand away. Harry tisked at Malfoy as she shook her finger back and forth covered in Malfoy’s precum.
“I was afraid I had lost you. Severus kept pointing out all the bad outcomes and some of the good ones but all I heard where the bad things that could happen to you while you were trapped in your own head. I couldn’t imagine what would happen to me if you were stuck in your own head for the rest of eternity. I think I would go insane.”
Harry rolled over and into Draco’s side. “Draco, it’s alright. I have known your father for a few years now; I think I understand how your father can be, Dray,” Harry stated and then went quiet, and Draco knew the look that he had on his face, like he wanted to say something else but wasn’t sure if it was alright if he said it or not.
Alright, so if anyone has read chapter four, i want to advise you to make sure you read the right chapter for i had a tiny chapter mix up. i have it fixed now though. there will be possible triggers in this chapter. i do have a picture of a dress that Harry wears in this chapter, i felt it would be something Narcissa would pick out for a ball for female Harry.
“Okay, I’ll wake him up.” Narcissa said as she twisted and stared down at Draco. “Dragon, wake up.” Narcissa whispered as she gently shook him awake. Draco’s eyes fluttered open and he sat up and looked at his mother.
“I don’t know I wasn’t there for that meeting. Narcissa was very pregnant ready to give birth at any moment, and she was bed ridden. I tried to be at her side as much as possible.” Lucius said as they reached the gate, and he opened it. Nagini slithered up Harry and draped herself over Harry’s shoulders. Then they disapparated.
“Nagini is also going with you. She is to make sure Harry isn’t injured while inside the Ministry. You are to wait outside for her to come out so you can bring her back here.”
“Now that Lucius is in Azkaban, Draco is the head of the Malfoy family. I have ensured our safety with the Aurors; stating that we weren’t involved with Lucius’ and Bella’s actions. They also are working with my new solicitor in getting all of the Malfoy accounts transferred into your name instead of your father’s, which you and I will be going through and seeing which ones we want to keep. I will also have to go through the house and vaults with the elves help to collect all of the dark objects and turn them over to the Aurors.”
Soon everyone was done with their meal, and Narcissa walked over to Harkin and took her hand before she said, “Want to come help me in the garden, darling.”
“Har, why did you do that love?” Draco questioned as he pulled her face between his hands to get a better look at her face, which was already starting to bruise.
“M-move, p-p-please.” Harkin panted as her finger nails dug into Draco’s forearms, and he groaned as her nails scratched down his arms causing small angry red lines in their path. Draco started thrusting into her at a steady pace, and Harkin’s fingers reached Draco’s hands, Draco took her hands and pinned them above her head as he leaned into his thrusts. Harkin’s legs were digging into Draco’s back, arse, and the back of his thighs. Draco moaned as he moved closer to the table, and his angle changed, and Harkin gasped as he moved just right inside her. “R-right t-t-there.” Harkin moaned as her head slammed into the table as her back arched and she came, and she squeezed around Draco causing him to gasp and cum inside her.
“Alright.” Draco reached over and grabbed his wand and cast a cleaning charm, cleaning himself, Harry, and his bed sheets. Draco then grabbed his bed sheets and pulled the sheets over both of them, and they both slowly drifted off to sleep in each other’s arms.
“Harry, is there something else that you want to say, because I know that look, and it says that you want to say something but aren’t sure if you should say it or not. So just say it, please.”
“We don’t know why they are here yet. Just give Severus a chance to explain.” Draco whispered back, and he pulled her towards the table.
“Oh, that is easy.” Madam Pomfrey pulled out her wand and cast a Patronus and sent it off with a message. Draco then had no choice but to stay, so he sat down and waited for Granger to show up. It didn’t take long as a few minutes later she came running in the hospital wing.
“Yeah, alright. You can come through, and we can talk.” Remus said, and he was gone. Harkin smiled and stepped through the flames, and as the flames engulfed her, she saw Draco standing in the doorway to the drawling room with a look of worry on his face. The next thing she knew she was standing in the kitchen at Grimmauld Place, and Remus was pulling her into his arms.
“Your mother is making a healer appointment for me.” well that saved him the trouble of having to figure out how to bring it up.
“Interesting conclusion.” Melody stated, and then she started casting some spells. “Well, you are half right. It is an influx of magic, but there is nothing natural about it. Someone intentionally did this to her, but the timeline is tricky with the potion that they used, so it is slightly impossible to tell when it was administered.
“I d-don’t kn-know. I-I j-just s-saw h-how ev-everyone is g-getting along so well, and I-I d-don’t know h-how to deal with the fact th-that everything is going s-so well. I know th-that’s a good thing, and th-that I should b-be happy. B-but I-I j-just don’t know how th-this happened. I-I’m not used to p-people caring about me, and I-I definitely d-didn’t expect p-people t-to accept me l-like this. Not as I am.” Harkin sobbed, and Draco pulled her closer.
“I promise, my dear. I won’t tell anyone.” Narcissa sat in shock at Harry’s outburst but wasn’t surprised. People reacted different to certain things. “Well, the party is about to start so I better finish up.” Narcissa said as she continued with Harry’s hair and make-up. When she was done, they stood up and started for the door when Harry stopped her.
“Yeah, that’s fine with me.” Harry placed a plate in front of her, and he sat down across from her, and they started eating. They finished eating quickly, and they got ready to leave. Andromeda took Harry’s trunk in one hand and Harry’s hand in the other, while Harry had Teddy in his other arm. They disapparated. They appeared at King’s Cross station, and they got a trolley for Harry’s trunk. They then headed for platform 9 ¾, and they went through the pillar, and placed their things on the train and waited for everyone else to come.
“Then we’ll just have to get it out of our system.” Harry smirked as she straddled Draco’s lap, and pulled him in for a kiss. Her hips ground forwards into Draco’s erection causing a groan to escape his lips, and his arms wrapped around her bringing her closer to him. She gasped as Draco’s erection slipped beneath her, and Draco smirked this time. Harry wrapped her arms around his neck and rested her forehead against his shoulder as he slipped inside her, and she released a soft gasp from surprise against his ear.
Draco held Harry in his arms and gently rocked him as he whispered sweet nothings to him. Finally, Harry pulled away enough to unwrap his arms from around his legs and wrapped them around Draco’s waist. With the move, Draco leaned back in the bed so he was lying down and the turned to the side so Harry was lying next to him.
“Are you… are we… dating?” Harry whispered the last word like she was afraid of the answer and couldn’t get herself to say it any louder.
“I am courting Harry, Granger. Small words work better for you.” Draco said which got him an elbow in the ribs from Harry. “Sorry.”
“Good morning, Draco, Harkin.” Severus nodded. “Would you mind getting ready for the day, so we can be on our way to breakfast?” Severus questioned, and Draco carefully let Harkin down as to not make her nightgown ride up. Harkin carefully made sure her feet were under her before she started walking towards their closet. Draco stood there and waited for her to come out and head to the bathroom before walking over to the closet himself.
“I know, cub. You’ll figure it out, and we’re here for you if you need to talk to us. I am also sure that Lucius and Narcissa will be willing to talk if you want to talk as well. Now I think it is time that we head in and have dinner.”
“You aren’t going to shower this morning; don’t you always shower in the morning?” Severus questioned as he tried to trying to remember his godson’s habits.
He released her and grabbed her hand before they disapparated, and when they reappeared, they were standing outside a house Harry knew from her dreams the previous year. The Riddle Manor. Harry wanted to run, but Nott held onto her broken arm so tightly that she was surprised she didn’t feel any more pain there. Which was probably not a good thing. Nott pulled her up to the house and knocked on the front door, and they stood there for a few minutes before someone opened the door and Harry gasped. There in the doorway stood Voldemort.
“Yes, you are for now, but how much longer will you be Minister, sir?” Draco questioned as he stared the Minister in the eyes, and the Minister stared right back.
“Harry, you’re safe.” He whispered. “Thank Merlin. Come here, dear.” Arthur said as he held out his hand to Harry, and she took it and gave the man a hug.
“Draco, in me now.” Harry hissed as he gripped Draco’s cock in his hand causing a moan to escape his lips.
“Alright, someone tell me what is going on right now.” That’s when Madam Pomfrey walked back in the room with Andromeda Tonks following behind her with a nine month old baby in her arms. “Teddy? Teddy Remus Lupin.” Harry said without even having to think about it. Today the little boy was a pale blonde, almost the same color of Draco’s hair. The little boy held his arms out in the air between them and Harry did the same. Andromeda placed the little boy in Harry’s arms and Harry pulled the little boy into his arms and snuggled his face into the little boy’s hair. Harry then started crying as the memories of that tragic day of May 2nd came back to him. Remus, Tonks, Fred, Collin Creevey, and many others.
“I know, fawn. That wasn’t what I meant; I meant about the Dursley’s and your living arrangements this summer.”
Draco leaned back down and started kissing his neck again, and he positioned myself over Harry’s erection and guided Harry’s erection into his entrance. Both Harry and Draco moaned as they pushed against each other, and Draco went back to work on Harry’s neck as Harry started thrusting into Draco. Harry arched his back and tilted his head back giving Draco a better angle, and Draco took it. Draco adjusted himself, and Harry adjusted himself to thrust himself into Draco. Draco started thrusting down onto Harry and Harry matches his pace, slowly quickening the pace as he went.
“She insulted Lily!” Sirius said in disbelief. “Apparently, Petunia had never seen Lily’s temper, which you inherited by the way. I wish you luck, Malfoy; James could barely handle her temper and we’ve been dealing with a werewolf almost every month since we were eleven.” Sirius said to Draco, and he was looking up in horror.
In their third year, when Sirius broke out of Azkaban, Draco was furious with him then to; he said that Harry should have never gone after Sirius, and risked his life like that. Even though he found out that Sirius was his godfather, didn’t betray his parents, and he only killed Peter Pettigrew because he was the one that betrayed his parents. Draco still thought it was dangerous to make that trip, plus Harry saved Ron Weasley that year, too. His stupid rat was Peter Pettigrew, the animagus that he was; everyone that knew that were dead or not saying because everyone thought Pettigrew was dead or Sirius was a mass murderer anyway, why wouldn’t he try and get out of a sentence.
“I don’t know, but Potter isn’t a target for death anymore. She’s a Horcrux, Albus, and he knows she’s a Horcrux.” Albus stood and looked between the two men, and bowed his head.
“No, now eat so we can get going. I want to be out of here before Albus tries anything.” Harry started eating, and as she was eating Voldemort tried to bring up conversation with her, but when that didn’t work he tried a different tactics. “So I was thinking, now that you are a fine young girl, you should have a girl name. I will not chose it for you; I will leave that to you, but I will be calling you that from here on out, so pick one you like. I will give you time to think.” Harry thought about the request and idea as she finished eating and she figured she would look for a book with names in it at Malfoy Manor, and she realized she had never been to the Manor. The only thing she was upset about was that Draco wouldn’t be there until Holiday break.
“And more good will come, cub, but first Sirius needs to be exonerated, and to do that he needs to go away for a little while.” Remus stated as he brushed his fingers through her hair to calm her. Draco held her in his arms as Remus brushed his fingers through her long, wavy raven hair, and Harkin just cried. She eventually cried herself to sleep, and Draco stood up with her cradled in his arms.
Draco turned and stunned the snake and then hovered it off the ground and out of the room. Draco took it down to the potions lab in the dungeons and extracted the venom that he needed for his potion; he then sent the snake back up to its master and away from him before it woke up. Draco started on the very complex potion and followed Severus’ directions to a tee and being extremely careful in doing so. After a few hours in the potions lab Draco’s potion was almost complete, and Draco was done. He just needed to make two more potions before he was done, and he needed to make sure he didn’t mix them up.
“We’re talking, Professor. I’m sorry if we were breaking any rules. I did not realize.” Malfoy covered, and Harry was very impressed.
“Oh, of course dear, but we better hurry its getting late and I don’t want visiting hours to end before we get to see him. Are you two ready?”
“I’ve got everything if that’s your question. Tally slipped Harry’s invisibility cloak out of Ron’s bag and that’s why he was throwing a tizzy. He’s upset that he’s lost Harry’s cloak, and he can’t use it for himself. I honestly don’t know why Harry is still friends with him. I mean he’s probably just sticking around because Harry’s famous. I think last year proved that, not to mention how quickly he jumped on the Harry’s guilty train the other day. Seriously, if I wouldn’t have known Ron was Harry’s best friend before that day I would have never believed it with how quickly he rolled on Harry’s loyalties.” Draco said as he stepped towards from Severus with a small smile on his face, like he just realized something.
Draco stopped in the middle of the hallway, and Narcissa stopped behind him as Draco ran his fingers through his hair. “Mum, if she dies, I die. If anything happens to us, I want you to take care of our baby, and I don’t mean how father raised me. I want my baby to be raised properly. The pureblood stuff can stay, but the rest of the bullshit can disappear. I don’t know if you will ever have to trust you with this, but with the bond I can’t not have a plan if something does happen, I need a plan.”
“Alright, next then. First thing. You will be sitting next to Draco, who will be on Lucius’ right, and I will be on Lucius’ left. Lucius will be at the head of the table. Draco will pull your chair out, you will sit down, and Draco will push your chair in. Then you will pick up your napkin and place it on your lap with your ankles crossed to the right. Good so far?”
“Harry, I love you. I know that for certain,” Draco whispered to Harry after he caught his breath. Harry rolled and wrapped his arms around Draco’s waist and Draco wrapped his arm around Harry’s shoulders pulling him closer.
“I will fire call Melody, and see if she will come over and check her out. We won’t let anything happen to her or the baby, Draco. Everything will be alright. I promise.” Narcissa whispered in his ear before she pulled away and hurried from the room to fire call Melody. Draco sat down in one of the chairs, and he placed his face in his hands. A few moments later, Narcissa came back followed by Melody, and Draco practically jumped off his chair and rushed towards them. “She is in your room correct?” Narcissa asked, and Draco nodded. The group then hurried up the stairs to Draco’s room, where Harkin was lying down on the bed fast asleep, and Melody started casting diagnostic charms on her. Some of the spells Draco didn’t even recognize from all the times that he has gotten hurt, and he was starting to panic.
“Yes, but Draco can no longer bare children, he is no longer strictly speaking alive either.” Severus stated.
“Your eyes. No one has eyes as green as you do it’s rather hard to miss. What are you doing here, Harry?” Arthur asked, and Harry hoped her lie was good enough.
“Yes, Mr. Potter. The ring had a curse upon it that would have killed him within a few weeks if I had not contained it and slowed its effects. He wanted to give you the most information that he could before he died, Mr. Potter.”
“Oh, Ronald.” Hermione took Ron’s face in her hands and she kissed him. When she pulled away, Hermione pulled Ron towards his bed and pulled Ron with her. They laid down and curled around one another and fell asleep.
“What’s going on, Gin?” Harkin asked as she glanced at her brother practically hiding behind her, and Ginny laughed a little at the look.
“She told you that you are vulnerable, didn’t she?” Harry turned his head away from Draco and looked to Snape.
“Are you sure that is what you want, love? You don’t look too convinced.” Draco whispered into the shell of her ear, and Harry pulled away suddenly and turned in the water to face Draco.
“Of course, love.” Draco whispered as he buried his face in Harry’s hair. Harry pulled the covers off of him, and he scooted to the edge of the bed. Draco scooped him onto his back and tuned his head to the side. “Hold on.” Harry’s grip tightened and Draco took off running as fast as he could to the dining room, only to quickly turn and make a detour to his mother’s study to collect the horcrux. The next thing he’s standing in the doorway to the dining room, and Harry is laughing in his ear. The entire room turns at the sound, and everyone’s features soften at the sight of Harry’s laughter.
“Not necessarily.” Draco then expected Harry to make sure he’s alright. “You aren’t hurt are you?” Harry could see true concern written throughout Draco’s features, something that he rarely gets with anyone other than Draco, and some time Pansy when she feels like she can use Harry for sex.
“Ignore him.” Narcissa smiled. “He’s just upset that I won’t let him do it, because I know that the two of you will not be getting the lesson done, and I would rather not have my fresh tablecloth dirtied.” Narcissa stated as she glared at her son.
“That is alright, Tally, and thank you for the update. I just had some questions for you, or well Weasley but he needed to see you.” Draco turned towards Ron and said, “Weasley?”
“What? When I first approached you, this is not what I had planned. Yes, I fancied you, but I never expected this to happen. I originally just wanted your help with getting rid of the Dark Lord and making sure Mother and I made it out alive and not in Azkaban. This just kind of happened, and that also doesn’t mean that I wouldn’t have asked you out when you were a guy, because I might have, eventually. I honestly don’t know what would have happened because it didn’t happen this did.” Draco defended himself.
“I am concerned about the baby given the circumstances, so I want to see her every other Saturday. I figured that would be the best day.”
“Eventually, your father came around, obviously. He apologized for his actions after finding out what I had done, and he told me I had done the right thing if it was what I absolutely wanted. I wasn’t his decision, it was mine, and he understood that. I accepted his apology, but I was still afraid of him. Every time he went to touch me, I flinched, and we realized that we would have to start our relationship over from scratch. Your father slowly got me to trust him again, and finally three years after I graduated, we finally got married and soon after that we had you. Two years we waited and tried to get pregnant again, and I was starting to think I gave up my only hope to have children. Your father never gave up hope though, and when I finally got pregnant with you, your father wanted to be there every step of the way. Your father and I fell in love twice, and fell out of love twice. After I had you, there were complications, I almost died, and your father couldn’t see me it was so critical. All he had was this little baby boy that he didn’t know how to raise on his own, and when I finally stabilized, we were informed that I wouldn’t and shouldn’t try to have another child. If I were to somehow end up pregnant, the pregnancy would be terminated for my safety. This decision was made by your father before I woke, and when I found this out I lost trust in your father. Mind you we still loved each other, but not the same as we did before my last year at Hogwarts. All the betrayal pulled us apart.” Narcissa finished.
“Harry, it’s not cold. Severus, what is going on?” Draco asked as he looked up from Harry to his godfather. Snape’s eyes widened.
“He is. I can see and smell the fear on you when I asked that. Harry was your first and you didn’t kill him.”
“What are you doing, Malfoy? You do realize that this potion may wear off or they might find out what’s keeping me this way.” Malfoy started kissing the side of Harry’s neck. “Why now, Malfoy?” Harry panted, and her hands rested on Malfoy’s shoulders. “Merlin why does that feel so good? I’ve never been this sensitive.” Harry moaned, and Malfoy moved his lips up behind Harry’s ear.
“This is Harry Potter, Draco’s best friend. Can we come in, please? I have nowhere else I trust to go to, not with Draco and Harry. Please, can we come in?” Narcissa begged. The woman opened the door all the way and waved her arm as if to allow them into the house. Narcissa grabbed Draco’s hand and pulled the boys into the house and then their trunks. “Thank you. Thank you so much. Draco this is your aunt, Andromeda. I do really appreciate this.” Narcissa didn’t know what to do, or where to stand in the house of her sister that she let her mother disown for marrying a muggleborn. “I’m sorry, Andy.”
"Maybe. Maybe not. That all depends on you, Potter.” A male voice said from the corner of the room. Harry eyes meet the man’s and he pulled Teddy closer to him.
“Nothing. It’s not that hard to calm someone when they feel safe. No one can get to him here unless I say so. Not past the wards or even around the manor. He is safe, and he knows I won’t let anyone past me, unless I am absolutely certain he is safe.”
“We have to place him under the stasis charm now. The Dark Lord’s soul is seeking him out.” He pulled his wand and started chanting a spell. “Draco, you have to move now.” Snape said and then continued his chanting. Draco placed Harry down on the settee, and he whispered into Harry’s ear before moving across the room where he wrapped his fingers around the top of one of the chairs. They could hear the distinctive cracking of the wood as Draco’s knuckles turned white against the dark wood.
“I don’t actually know, but there are both muggle and magical plants. We aren’t all prejudice, Harry. Lucius had an interesting father and childhood; his mother died right before I started Hogwarts, and Abraxas raised Lucius similar to how Lucius tried to raise Draco, if I wasn’t in the picture.” Narcissa said as she pulled Harry into a little nook. There was a window seat that looked over the pitch in the back of the Manor. “I like to read here, and you can use it for whatever you like.” Narcissa said as she sat down in the window seat and looked out the window.
“Oh, darling, they plan themselves. I really just set up a layout for the ballroom. It’s rather easy, really. For Valentine’s Day party I usually do a theme, but other than that the parties are rather simple. Then of course there’s the scared twenty-eight tea parties I told you about.”
“Side effect. He got upset over something Blaise said and locked himself in the bathroom, and I couldn’t coax him out or figure out how to unlock the bloody door, and when I finally did he was cold as ice and he was barely breathing. I really hope he’s not going to have to deal with this the rest of his life because then winters are going to be brutal for him. We’re going to have to move somewhere warmer or otherwise I’m going to be worried all the time about whether or not he’ll freeze to death.”
“Well, suck it up, Potter. I’m going carry you up to the hospital wing.” Harry’s face scrunched up as Draco stood up and leaned down the scoop Harry into his arms. Draco was about walked out of the room, when Harry stopped him.
“Lestrange?” Harry asked as he tried to keep the fear out of his voice. They reached Andromeda’s room and they walked in. Rodolphus placed Andromeda on her bed, and then transfigured the settee in the corner into a crib for Teddy.
“Lucius’ drawing room is the most private room in the Manor other than bedrooms. The house elves won’t bother us there.” Narcissa said as she started moving towards the stairs, and everyone followed. Nagini closely following Harry. They reached the drawing room in complete silence, and when the door was shut Narcissa sat down on one of the couches and Harry moved to sit by her when she was pulled back to one of the chairs across the room. Narcissa looked up in horror as Lucius sat down next to her.
Malfoy grabbed her upper arm and pulled her back into the room. “No, I want to know. How do you know what the Slytherin common room looks like?”
“Understood, Madam Pomfrey.” Draco said as he sat up and pulled Harry with him. Harry smiled at Madam Pomfrey and they walked out of the room only to run into Professor Snape and Professor McGonagall.
“Nothing, though that doesn’t mean that Ron and I weren’t worried. When am I not worried about you?” Hermione asked the minute the door was completely closed. “Where the hell do you go with Malfoy?”
“Why didn’t you say anything? Everyone probably knows now.” Harry was embarrassed as his cheeks flushed.
“Not a problem, Granger. Potter has been through a lot in the past few months, and I’m actually surprised that he decided to come back this year.”
“Yes, now follow it.” Draco heard him say, and he stood up and walked away whispering thank you under his breath as he focused on the magic. He followed it until he was standing in the middle of the Quidditch pitch and he released the magic. Draco turned and looked around, and then up and he found Harry circling above. Draco walked over to the broom shed, and he changed into a practice uniform and grabbed his broom. He walked out of the shed and took flight, and in the process, he almost got clobbered by Harry who was zipping past to catch the snitch.
“Well, you've had three plates, I’m sure you have eaten enough for the both of us.” Harkin stated, and the entire Slytherin table that heard busted up laughing.
There was a simultaneous “Yes.” That erupted through the masses and he dismissed everyone. Everyone left except Lucius and Severus.
“Thank you, Remi. I appreciate your reassurance, but I should still head home.” Harkin smiled as she stood up and walked over to the fireplace, and she grabbed some floo powder.
Draco kept going and slid another finger into Harry’s entrance with the same results, and Harry could barely hold himself together. Harry’s hands were gripping Draco’s shoulders so tight that they were started to leave bruises on his skin. “Dray,” Harry muttered, but he couldn’t finish what he was saying. Draco gathered what Harry was trying to say, and he pulled his fingers out of Harry’s entrance. Harry whimpered as the pressure left his entrance, but was soon followed by a moan as Draco pushed his erection into Harry’s entrance.
“It’s good to see you Seamus, and I am. I’ve kind of been on the run for six months. Harry, Ron and I really haven’t had regular meals like those of you here at Hogwarts. The last real meal I had before Harry got captured was in September.”
“Great, so we won’t know if we’re affected until it happened. Did Uncle Sev explain what he did?” Draco asked.
They tried to stabilize themselves, but they couldn’t, and Draco couldn’t pull his hand away from the snitch and Harry’s hand. Draco looked at Harry, and their eyes met. Harry took her other hand off her broom and swung her leg over and onto Draco’s broom, right in front of him so she was facing him.
“Ah, yes, sir. I’m not certain, but I think I might have an idea about who might have done this to Harry. It’s Blaine Zabini, sir.” Draco stated.
Draco was having a hard time finding all of Harry’s things, he called his personal house elf. “Tally.”
“He has Harry held captive in his own mind, and he’s in there trying to get out.” Draco stated. “I can’t just let him hid in there without doing something about it. He needs me.” Draco said as he looked back at Harry’s face, but the look in his eyes was wrong. There was a fire there that wasn’t Harry, and then there was a flash through his eyes it was brief where he could see Harry in his eyes again, but it was gone as soon as it was there. “Get out of him. Now!” Draco yelled as slammed him into the ground and automatically felt the pain in the back of his head but he pushed it aside. He saw the look in Harry’s eyes and he saw him. He saw Harry there. “I’m going to save you, Harry just keep fighting. We’ll figure something out, I promise.” Draco said and then he watched as Harry slumped in his arms. Draco looked up at Severus and saw his wand drawn. “What did you do?”
“Potter, what did you get out of bed for? You need sleep to regain your energy. Now, you’ve just drained all that you had gained.” Malfoy scooped Harry into his arms, and carried him over to his bed. “Do you not remember anything from last night?”
“I haven’t changed sides I’ve just been beaten and bullied to get her tonight. I will still end you, Tom.” Harry stated, and he gripped her arm tighter and she cried out in pain. Voldemort looked from her eyes to her arm and dragged her to the room she would be staying in and MIPS was standing there waiting for her. “Mipsy, I want you to mend Miss Potter’s arm and then help her into her gown for this evening.” Voldemort turned towards Harry then as Nagini slithered into the room. “Potter, I am tying you to Nagini. You will not be able to be more than 15 feet from her, do not try and escape.” He turned towards his pet, and said, “
Harry walked over to the shower and turned it onto the hottest setting and he stripped down and stepped in, turning the shower down until he could stand the heat. Harry just stood under the shower head letting the water soak through his hair and down his body, and he just let his mind wonder not really thinking about one certain thing, and trying to not think about Draco. If he thought about Draco he wouldn’t be able to concentrate on the one thing that he wanted to think about. How did he get to this point, and did he really want this for himself?
“Oh, my dear. I am so sorry.” Narcissa stated as she pulled Harry in a tight hug. “I didn’t know that Nott had already started punishing you, especially in that way. I’m going to kill him for defiling my future daughter in law. And once Draco finds out…” Narcissa was cut off by Harry pulling free of her embrace.
“Don’t look at me like that, Potter. You and Draco put your hands on this stone here.” He said as he indicated the stone with his wand. Draco took Harry’s hand and they placed them next to each other on the stone. Snape cast a spell and a door opened to them. “All you have to do to gain access is place your hands on the stone and it will open for you. But only you and Draco can gain access this way. Understood?”
“No, but Potter’s bookends are going down. With Potter in the hospital wing, and them being together it won’t be long before they start drifting apart, but that’s not the point. They don’t really like me after the whole offering the chosen one up to the Dark Lord thing.”
“Explaining. You two get dressed and meet us in the dining room you’ll be hungry. Narcissa, Lucius, if you would please follow me.” Severus said and then turned from the room and left. Narcissa and Lucius looked at Draco and Harry before quickly following behind Severus.
“There is such a thing as blankets, Draco.” Pansy stated placing her hands on her hips. Draco just glared at her and turned back to Blaise.
“We better head down before one of them comes back up.” She said and pulled away but kept their hands entwined, and Draco examined the dress a little closer and then looked at his outfit. Draco was wearing a black suit with a white tie and black vest, and he found it a little weird that they matched, but he pushed it out of his mind.
“Well, typically when patients who have been raped or almost raped or abused in the way Harry has, and not remember don’t trust the sex of their abuser. So if the abuser is male they have a tendency to mistrust all males; if the abuser is female they mistrust females. Not the entire sex except one person.”
“Where do you think?” Harry said as he smirked at Draco while still pulling Draco with him. Once Draco realized what Harry was saying, he started pulling Harry at a run. It was for the better, because Harry doesn’t exactly remember where the common room was because he was passed out in Draco’s arms the night before. They reached the door and Draco said the password and pulled Harry through the common room luckily everyone was either in class or not there as Draco headed across the room to the doorway on the right. They headed up a spiral staircase and then down the hall at the top of the stairs.
“My father is in the hospital and you want to trust Harry on a hunch. What if someone else gets hurt or worse, killed.”
“Yeah, I’ll be fine in a little bit. Just give me a second.” Harry rested his head in his hands while he tried to steady himself. Draco just watched Harry closely, and waited for Harry to look back up at him. Harry could feel Draco’s eyes burying into him, and he glanced up at him.
“I’ll take that as a yes.” Harry just laid her head against Draco’s shoulder and closed her eyes. Harry felt as Draco’s arms wrapped around her and his one hand slid down her abdomen and between her legs.
Harry thought as Neville escorted him up to the Hospital Wing as he apologized over and over to Harry. Finally, Harry stopped and placed his slightly smaller hands on Neville’s shoulders. “Neville, please stop apologizing. There was nothing you could have done to stop this from happening. It was a small mistake that might just change my life forever. You grabbed the wrong ingredient and accidently put it in. No one knew this was going to happen. We can’t change it now, but we can hope Madam Pomfrey can. Just please stop apologizing.” Harry stated in his slightly higher voice.
“Someone is still after us?” Draco questioned, slightly furious. “How? Everyone should be locked away by now.”
“Love, I think the only thing you’ll see is concern. They all love you and want to make sure you’re alright.” Draco tried.
“Tell me if it gets too tight.” Draco stated, and Harkin nodded. Draco started lacing up the back of her dress, and when Harkin sucked in a breath, Draco loosened the laces a little and then finished tying it. When he stepped away, she turned around, and Draco gasped. “You look beautiful.” Draco whispered, and Harkin blushed.
“You don’t want to come?” Draco’s voice went flat almost sad, and Harry couldn’t stand to see that look on his best friends face.
“No, usually the calming draught has that affect, but given my power levels, doesn’t make that affect as prominent for me and Harkin.” Draco explained.
“Yeah.” Draco nodded at Neville, and they started slowly going through the potion step by step, and by the end of class. Neville had made the potion without it blowing up, spilling over or a combination of the two. He hadn’t made a perfect potion but it was definitely an improvement.
“I’m just upset that he is still out there as well. He was always good at hiding in plain sight, but I just wish that someone would just catch him already. Him being out there scares me, for both myself and you and the twins. I don’t know what he might possibly do if he found out about them.” Theo stated as his fingers rubbed circles on the small growing bump.
“May I ask where Draco is off to?” Lucius asked, and Harkin knew that her eyes widened as the question was asked, because how does she answer that question without saying that her and Draco just fucked on the dining room table that diner was going to be served tomorrow night to all of their guests for the party. “Do I want to know where Draco is at?” Lucius changed his question, and Harkin just stood there not knowing how to answer the questions he was asking her.
Harry hurried over to the counter where a night dress was waiting for her and she quickly pulled it on. Narcissa hurried over and pulled the material up to look at them, when Harry pulled away. “What are you doing?”
“In trouble.” Hermione said as the door swung open, and they stepped into the common room to find the room full of people all staring at them.
Narcissa also got up and followed the boys out of the room, and when they reached Draco’s room she closed the door behind them. She turned to look at them, and she stated, “I’m sorry, boys. I didn’t know that Lucius was planning this. I didn’t want you boys exposed to this, and Lucius just insisted that he invite them over for dinner. I am so sorry, Draco; you know how stubborn your father can be. I will make it up to the two of you over our holiday, alright?”
Well, I had it in the nice box it was going to be a nice truce kind of thing, because I thought that we should call a truce, I mean we’re grown adults, and we should be able to stop acting like children. Both of us were pawns in a game of chess that we didn’t want to be a part of, but got dragged down with the ship as it sank and got stuck. Harry exhaled and Draco stopped him from finishing.
Draco slipped his tongue into Harry’s mouth, and Draco slipped his hands down Harry’s side and ripped his shirt off. Harry rolled his hips upwards into Draco’s erection. Draco moaned as Harry’s erection grinded against his own. “Harry! My god. Pants… off… now. I can’t stop myself when you do that, Harry. I need you…I need you in me, Harry.” Harry moved his hands down to Draco’s waistband, and undid Draco’s pants. Harry pulled Draco’s pants off and slipped his hand down between Draco’s cheeks and found his way to Draco’s entrance. Harry pushed his fingers into Draco’s entrance, and Draco let out a slight moan as Harry pushed his way into Draco.
“We can fix that. You were innocent; it isn’t fair that you shouldn’t enjoy your freedom. Lucius can go and talk to the minister about it right now if you wish.”
“Yes. Just don’t worry about it too much Harry. Everything will work out somehow, I promise.” Draco rested his forehead against Harry’s. “Are you alright with this, Harry? Because if you aren’t, that’s alright, Harry. Please, just tell me if you aren’t alright with this.”
“It’s not that I don’t trust your ability it’s just I need information from the Healer that you can’t give me, Madam Pomfrey.”
“Yes, fawn. I was innocent the whole time, and they just need to right the wrong. I may not get everything back, but as long as I get my family vaults and residences and you and Remus, I will be a happy man.” Sirius stated as he felt Remus place his hand on his shoulder.
“That is true. Do you want to see the difference?” Draco whispered into Harry ear, and his hands slipped down to remove Harry’s jeans and knickers. Harry gasped as the cold air hit her lower regions. Draco cast a quick warming charm around them. Draco unclasp Harry’s bra and slipped it off. Draco’s lips found their way to one of them and started sucking and nipping as one of his hand slipped down and his fingers started circling her entrance.
“No, he wanted you out of our lives and didn’t care what he had to lose. Including his wife, son, and grandchildren.” Draco stated as Narcissa walked into the compartment with Hermione and Theo.
“Ah, there you two are. Mel is checking Harry’s vitals then she’ll check Draco’s before he can go inside.” Lucius explained.
“Num-nums.” Teddy muttered enthusiastically towards the bottle in Harry’s left hand. “Num-num, num-num.”
“I want you to find and pack Harry’s things for me. I need you to do it as quickly as possible I don’t know if anyone is going to come in here any time soon.”
“Something that I should have done when the Ministry interviewed you 14 years ago.” Narcissa said. “Stupefy.” She shouted.
“Severus, all I see is us.” Draco whispered and he heard as someone rushed toward them, and Draco turned and came face to face with Harry. Draco pounced and pinned him to the ground. “Harry?”
“No, I usually come up here every morning just for a daily stroll and when I’m done I usually do my homework in my private room next to the library.”
“Why would I stop being your friend just because your aunt and uncle treat you like shit, Harry? If anything that would make me want to be your friend more, not less.” Draco could see the confusion slip through Harry’s expression, like that wasn’t the response that he always received from people claiming to be his friends. That’s when it dawned on Draco. “Harry, have you ever had a true friend before? A friend that didn’t leave you to fend off your family when they found out who you were related to?” Harry just looked down at the floor again and shook his head no.
“I know she is, and I know she can. Those qualities are part of the reason why I love her, I loved her when she was a him, and that won’t change, not ever?” Draco stated.
“For always being there for me. I know it’s your job as my mother, but I’ve never been an easy child. I want to apologize for that.”
“Over there.” Draco whispered back as he pointed to the floor over by her wardrobe. Harkin smiled at him, and she leaned forwards and kissed him before she climbed off his lap and off the bed. She walked over to the wardrobe and bent over to pick up her knickers, her dress sliding up a little to show Draco a little more than need be, and Draco groaned, “You are a tease, Harkin Potter.”
The next fear comes to light and Harry is sitting by the lake next to Sirius with all the Dementors attacking them both. Harry can feel as the fear and coldness that comes with the Dementors washes over him. The sadness is slowly draining him and he can’t produce a Patronus. He can’t find his wand. The screaming, his mother’s screaming is all he can hear it’s endless. Why hasn’t he passed out yet?
“Draco, it’s not that I’m doubting that you love me, it’s just…” Draco tugged on Harry’s newly forming erection, cutting off his sentence.
“This makes you uncomfortable. Everyone getting along so well.” Remus stated, and Harkin’s eyes widened.
The group moved to how their break went and casual talk after that, and nothing exceptional happened; Harkin woke up about halfway through the trip, and apologized to everyone. The rest of the ride went smoothly until they pulled into the station at Hogsmeade.
“Yes, is that a problem, because if it is I might have to find another place to keep my family safe? Draco is my son, and if the only way for him to be happy is without his father then so be it.” Narcissa stared her sister down, and she took Draco’s hand and started pulling Draco off the couch.
“No, you taste like my raven.” Draco whispered back and pulled her back in for a kiss, and when their lips met, Harkin didn’t resist, but deepened the kiss. Draco wrapped his arms around her knees and stood up, and Harkin wrapped her legs around his waist, and he placed one arm under her arse and the other around her waist, and he carried her to their room. When they got there, he carried her over to their bed and tucked her in, and he brushed her hair out of her face and behind her ear. “Sleep, raven. I will wake you for lunch.” Draco whispered.
“Yeah, you were friends with Lily, what do you think?” Sirius said as he turned Harry to look at him. Her scold turned into a look of confusion and awe.
“Is this what you do in your free time, Dray? Sit and read your textbooks.” Harkin asked as she looked at the textbook and started reading the text he was reading. “Dray, we haven’t even covered that chapter yet.” Harkin questioned.
“Oh, so you have a whole plan thought out, but you won’t go in and do it. You’re going to send in the child that is precious and should be cherished.”
“Please find it. I will be in my dorm when you find it. Anything necessary to find Harry’s cloak, but try and stay under the radar and not get noticed.”
“Not as long as he apologizes for his involvement in Harry’s kidnapping. Theo has been a great friend, it’s his father I have a problem with.” Draco stated as they heard a crash, and Draco was running towards the nook where the noise came from.
“Not until he harnesses Harry’s power. The minute he turns without someone doing it is the minute he is lost. Take him now. I will fetch Professor McGonagall, and Mr. Weasley and Miss Granger. Go now, Draco. Before he wakes. Then you may want to wipe the blood off your face before McGonagall gets to her office. Go.” Draco picked Harry up and was out of the room and standing in front of McGonagall’s office door and it opened to his touch, and he was inside and shutting the door.
“I know, love; I’m sorry. Just this is getting to me, I guess. Let’s go shower and get ready for the rest of the day. You have an appointment at 1 this afternoon.” Draco said, and he stood up. He scooped Harry into his arms and carried her o the bathroom as her augh rang throughout the house.
Draco started the shower, and he stepped inside then closed the door and set Harry down. Harry switched on the hot water, and she started getting her hair wet. Draco did the same as he stepped behind her, and she chuckled.
“I’m fine, I think. Just got a little dizzy.” Harkin whispered, and Hermione was about to say something, when Harkin collapsed, and Draco barely caught her.
“Hermione, they’re here to help. Somethings up with Harry, and we have to find this thing before we lose him. I don’t want to find out what it is like in a world without Harry. Do you?”
“Dinner will be at 6:30 sharp if you and Remus want to come over, and you are welcome over whenever you want, just let us know ahead of time.” Narcissa said, and Sirius just nodded before walking out of the room.
Ron and Hermione nodded as they turned and walked out of the room and closed the door behind them. Harry walked over to his bed and flopped down and buried her face in her pillows. She doesn’t know when she fell asleep, but the next thing she knows is she’s sitting upright covered in sweat trying to catch her breath. She reached for her wand and cast a tempus charm to find out it’s only three in the morning. She groaned as she flopped backwards onto her bed, and she laid there for another 20 minutes before groaning and climbing out of bed to get dressed. She pulled on her new school uniform and she grabbed her book bag and headed out to the common room to try and get some homework done.
“Love, why don’t you come sit with me?” Draco said, and Harkin turned around and the cold instantly went away as Harkin sprung out of her seat and into Draco’s already outstretched arms.
“Now that is the tricky part, Harry, because there is a record of the prophecy in the Hall of Prophecies in the Department of Mysteries at the Ministry of Magic. Your job is to break into the Ministry and steal the prophecy from its shelf.”
“He said no one would want me after their through with me. He said I’d be the Death Eaters personal…” Harry trailed of as her voice faltered.
“I’ll be right down. I just have to clean up first.” Harkin stated, and Narcissa smiled before she nodded and turned to leave. Harkin walked over to the bed and leaned over to kiss Draco, who reached around and up her dress to grab her arse. Harkin gasped and braced herself against the bed, and she fell against the bed and laughed as Draco pulled her into his arms. “Draco, your mother is expecting me downstairs, and I need my knickers, because if I go down there without them, I am going to be blushing up a storm through that entire lesson, and I will never be able to look at your mother the same again. She knows, Dray. She knows we just had sex, and if I go down there…” Harkin trailed off, and Draco was smirking at her. “Don’t stare at me like that. Now, where are my knickers?” Harkin whispered in his ear as she straddled his waist.
“Hey.” Harkin said as she reached over and grabbed Draco’s chin with her hand, forcing him to look at her. “Just because I am better than you at Quidditch doesn’t mean a thing, and to top it all off I’m just amazing all around.” Harkin smiled
